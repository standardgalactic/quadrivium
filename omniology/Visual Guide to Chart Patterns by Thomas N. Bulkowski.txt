I 
like dealing with the best. Th at is why writing and 
publishing a book is made easy by John Wiley & 
Sons and Pamela van Giessen. Th anks, Pamela.

ometimes before I trade, an inner voice speaks to 
me. Some may call it the voice of experience, but 
I prefer to call it the voice of knowledge and wisdom. 
When I have listened to that voice, it has saved me 
money. One goal of this book is to provide the knowl-
edge so that you can create your own trading voice. 
Whether you are a professional trader, money 
manager, or retired schoolteacher trying to boost the 
inheritance for the grandchildren, this book is for you. 
From the expert to the novice, there is information 
about chart patterns that you do not know or may 
have forgotten. Th is book will provide a visual guide 
to learning about chart patterns in a manner that is 
simple and easy to understand. 
Consider this book an instruction manual for rec-
ognizing chart patterns, discovering why they behave 
as they do, and learning what it means when you see 
one. You will learn to see not squiggles on price charts, 
but footprints of the smart money; not a mountain 
range, but double tops, rectangles, and head-and-
shoulders.
Th e basics come fi rst so that we speak the same 
language. What you learn in this section may surprise 
you. Th e basics provide a foundation for what follows.
Th en we cover the most important and popular 
chart patterns. Th is is where you discover that not 
every peak or valley is a chart pattern. What to look 
for and why they form are in this section.
Completing the book are buy and sell signals. I do 
not off er mechanical trading systems, but visual ones 
that can help make you money or avoid losing it.
When you turn the last page of this book, my hope 
is that you leave with a greater understanding and 
knowledge of chart patterns, knowledge that can 
serve as food for the inner trading voice. Should that 
voice speak to you, listen. It could save you a bundle. 
And if you fi nd yourself arguing with that inner voice 
at the grocery store, then blame me.
Introduction


Visual Guide to
Chart Patterns


Th is section of the book reviews the basics: minor 
highs and lows, trendlines, gaps, throwbacks, pull-
backs, support, and resistance. I provide many exhibits 
so that we agree on terms and techniques. Th e basics 
will become important when we move to identifying 
chart patterns and then using them to signal trades.

Pattern Recognition Made Easy
C H A P T E R1
W
hile working at Tandy Corporation, I hung on 
my oﬃ  ce wall a price chart of the company’s 
stock. I did not know if the head-and-shoulders top 
I found was one or not, but it looked like a person’s 
head in the middle of a pair of shoulders. To the left 
and right of that pattern, price dropped back to earth, 
making it seem like the pattern was a ghost rising 
from a moat.
Th at was my fi rst attempt at fi nding a chart pat-
tern. Since that time, I taught myself to recognize 
chart patterns—a skill almost anyone can learn. Let 
us begin looking at a few charts to see how to recog-
nize patterns.
The Empty Chart
Th e empty chart is not empty at all, is it? Price bars 
form a mountain range that climbs higher until July 
after which a hiker walking on those bars would prob-
ably fall to their death. (See Exhibit 1.1.)
In that brief description, we have learned two 
things: Price rises until July and then dies. If you 
owned this stock, you would be looking for chart pat-
terns that predict the coming decline. Why? Because 
you might want to sell before the tumble or act to pro-
tect your position.
In October, in addition to searching for the remains 
of our dead hiker, you would be looking for signs that 
the downward price trend had reversed. If it had, then 
you might want to buy the stock or buy more to cap-
ture the recovery.
How do you fi nd patterns that predict a decline? 
Begin with peaks.
Finding Peak Patterns
When I look at a price chart, my eyes fi nd peaks that 
stop at or near the same price. At line A, for exam-
ple, several peaks approach or touch the upper red 
line. Th at line represents overhead resistance. 
3
DEFINITION:
Overhead resistance
Overhead resistance, or just 
resistance, occurs when a stock 
stalls in an uptrend or reverses, 
creating a peak, often near the 
same price as it has in the past. 
Resistance is always above price.

4 ■CHAPTER 1  Pattern Recognition Made Easy
When price finally breaks through that ceiling, it sig-
nals a change in trend from moving sideways to up. 
(See Exhibit 1.2.)
After finding the top horizontal red line, look for a 
corresponding line parallel to the top one, but drawn 
along the valleys. I show that as the lower red line. 
The two lines form a rectangle chart pattern. The 
name of the chart pattern is not as important as how 
I found it. Just imagine a horizontal line that touches 
several peaks and another line that touches several 
valleys.
Peaks B and C also exhibit overhead resistance. 
How do I know that? Because they top out near the 
same price. An imaginary ceiling exists above those 
peaks, holding the stock down—for a time. Peak H 
slams its head against that ceiling, too.

Peaks F and G are another pair showing overhead 
resistance. In this case, a downward price trend leads 
to this pair whereas BC and DE appeared in an up-
ward price trend.
Peak pairs BC, DE, and FG show the major ingre-
dient of double top chart patterns, that of two peaks 
fi nding overhead resistance near the same price.
Compare the BCH trio with peaks D and E. 
Th e DE pair form twin tops, but further apart—
larger. Larger patterns tend to be more im-
portant than smaller ones. Price will tend to drop 
further after a large pattern than after a small one. 
In this case, the stock declines more after DE than 
after BC.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Chart patterns tall and wide 
(large patterns) tend to perform 
better than narrow and short 
ones (small patterns).

lines of overhead resistance

Eventually, though, the stock tunnels its way through 
support at E, and plummets like a stone through 
water.
Valley patterns are useful for determining when 
a downward price trend changes to horizontal or 
upward.
Notice the peaks that bump up against line G, 
shown in red. Th e fi rst two poke through the line, but 
Finding Valley Patterns
Exhibit 1.3 highlights price valleys. In a manner simi-
lar to peaks, look for two or more valleys that bottom 
near the same price. Th ose valleys may rest upon a 
fl oor where support is strong enough to launch an-
other move up. One example is CD. 
I highlight this pair because it forms underlying 
support. Price fi nds a fl oor at C and bounces oﬀ  it at D. 
DEFINITION:
Underlying support
Underlying support, or just 
support, occurs when a falling 
stock stalls or reverses, creating 
a valley, often at the same price 
as it has in the past. Support is 
always below price.

Visual Guide to Chart Patterns ■7
Curved Patterns
After fi nding peaks and valleys that align, try imag-
ining price tracing curves. I show two examples in 
Exhibit 1.4. 
Notice that the price bars at A begin rising, fol-
lowing a straight line of trend, but then curve at the 
top. Connecting the underside of price bars in a ris-
ing price trend often shows the curve better than con-
necting the tops. Either way is fi ne.
Pattern A is called an inverted and ascending scal-
lop. Th e chart pattern appears often on the charts, but 
it is not popular or well known. Th e fi shy sounding 
name refers to the bowl shape and not the mollusk. If 
you fi nd one, never eat it.
Th e rounding turn at B forms another curved pat-
tern. Th e B turn would be a rounding bottom, but 
price needs to enter the pattern trending down and 
not up. B is an example of a failed cup with handle 
pattern. Th e handle is at C. Cups have many qualifi ca-
tions, so strictly speaking, this is not one. However, the 
pattern does show the important parts: a rising price 
trend followed by a rounded turn and a short handle.
Diagonal Patterns
Staying with the same chart, look at pattern D on the 
left. What happened to the rectangle bottom identi-
fi ed in an earlier chart? It is still there, of course, but 
the new lines form a diﬀ erent chart pattern. Chart 
patterns can nest (one inside the other) and the same 
pattern can appear as two diﬀ erent types. Th ink of it 
SMART INVESTOR TIP
In a rising price trend, try 
forming curved patterns beneath 
price bars. In a falling price 
trend, curves often appear 
smoother along the tops. Either 
method works.
that is fi ne since rarely will peaks or valleys stop at ex-
actly the same price. Th e line represents a temporary 
barrier to an upward move.
For the moment, ignore the V-bottom at I. Search 
below line G for valleys that bottom near the same 
price. I found them and drew line F. It represents a 
support area connecting bottoms J and H, and extend-
ing to the right with additional touches along the way.
Does the GF trading range mean price is changing 
trend from down to up? Perhaps. It is too early to tell 
for sure.
What about the emergency dive to I? Th at subma-
rine plunge may have been panic selling, forcing the 
stock down to a level low enough that it represented a 
steal to value investors. Th e needle shape of the V bot-
tom supports this theory (that is, price remained at I 
for just one day before dumping its ballast and rising).
Notice pattern HIJ. It is an inverted (upside down) 
head-and-shoulders pattern. H and J represent shoul-
ders and I is the head. K could be a cancerous growth 
on the neck, but lab results have not come back yet. It 
is not important to the survival of the pattern.
Another head-and-shoulders bottom (a synonym 
for an inverted head-and-shoulders) occurs at ABC. 
Th is one is unusual—and rarer—because price trends 
upward into the pattern, not downward.
For now, though, the inbound price trend is not 
important. What is important is to train your eyes to 
fi nd peaks that top out near the same level and fi nd 
valleys that bottom near the same price. When you 
can do that, you can fi nd chart patterns. It is that 
simple.
DEFINITION:
Head-and-shoulders 
pattern
A head-and-shoulders bottom and 
inverted head-and-shoulders are 
synonyms.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Train your eyes to ﬁ nd peaks that 
top out near the same price and 
valleys that bottom near similar 
prices.

8 ■CHAPTER 1 Pattern Recognition Made Easy
Constructing Patterns
When you look at a price chart, train your eyes to 
search for peaks that top out near the same price. 
Th ey may form chart patterns (double tops) that warn 
of a coming trend change from up to down.
Train your eyes to fi nd valleys that bottom near the 
same price (double bottoms). Bottoming patterns can 
as explaining the words “there,” “their,” and “they’re” 
to someone learning English. Th ey sound the same, 
but are diﬀ erent.
Look on the chart where price forms diagonals. I 
show one as a slanting blue trendline above D. Th e line 
touches price three times as marked. Another trend-
line touches the pattern’s bottom, also three times. Th e 
blue pattern is an example of a descending triangle.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Chart patterns can nest—one 
inside the other. The same price 
pattern can also appear as two (or 
more) differently named patterns.
Look for price that moves 
along a straight line (usu-
ally diagonal, not ﬂ at). 
When that happens, there 
is a good chance that the 
line represents one bound-
ary of a chart pattern.

alert you to a stock ready to fly like the model rockets 
I launched as a kid (not the homemade gasoline one 
that ignited a water puddle—sorry about that, Mom).
Patterns that form diagonals (descending triangle, 
for example) or curves (scallops, rounding bottoms, or 
cup with handles) also foretell the direction that price 
may take.
Visually connect peaks, valleys, curves, and diago-
nals to form chart patterns.
Exhibit 1.5 highlights the valid patterns identified 
so far. 
LS means left shoulder and RS means right shoul-
der. A complex head-and-shoulders bottom (low-

10 ■CHAPTER 1  Pattern Recognition Made Easy
A complex head-and-shoulders bottom has mul-
tiple shoulders and multiple heads, but rarely both.
Think of pattern recognition as like trying to  
find the Big Dipper or Cassiopeia in the heavens at 
night.
In the next chapter, I begin to develop a common 
language, starting with minor highs and lows. Do not 
be alarmed. This is not as hard as learning French. 
However, I could be lying because I never learned 
French.

Decide which of the following statements are true or 
false.
1. Overhead resistance occurs when price stalls or 
reverses, and is always below price.
2. Underlying support happens when price stalls at 
the same level as it has in the past. Support is never 
above price.
3. A rectangle forms between underlying resistance 
and overhead support.
4. On the same price scale (daily scale or weekly scale, 
but not mixed), tall chart patterns tend to outper-
form smaller ones.
5. Th e same price pattern can have multiple names.
6. Like an expectant mother, one price pattern can be 
inside another.

inor highs and lows are synonyms for peaks and 
valleys except that they have strict defi nitions 
that can help with pattern recognition. I will use these 
terms throughout this book, so we might as well go 
through the pain of learning what they mean and how 
to recognize them.
A minor high does not refer to an overdose, and 
a minor low is not lingo for a bad trip. Rather, they 
represent the building blocks of pattern recognition. 
If you can program a computer to fi nd them, then 
you can automate pattern recognition. For example, 
a triple top has three minor highs near the same 
price. 
Since you are a human computer, I have created 
defi nitions for minor highs and lows to help you fi nd 
them until your eyes become trained to spot them. 
String them together in your mind and patterns will 
emerge, patterns that repeat, patterns that can make 
you money.
Peaks: Minor Highs
A minor high is a signifi cant peak on the price chart. 
What does signiﬁ cant mean? I had to answer that ques-
tion when I wrote Patternz—free software that auto-
matically fi nds chart patterns. I discovered that peaks 
between three and fi ve days apart led to the best 
pattern recognition (the exact number is pattern 
specifi c). 
Use fi ve days between peaks for minor highs, but 
be fl exible.
Exhibit 2.1 shows each peak highlighted with an 
asterisk that is at least fi ve days away from a higher 
peak. For example, point A is the highest high from at 
least fi ve days before to fi ve days after the peak.
Notice that peak B does not have an asterisk. 
According to my computer, it is not a minor high. 
Why? Because C has a high that is above peak B, and C 
is fi ve days away from B. 
DEFINITION:
Minor highs 
A minor high is a peak separated 
by about ﬁ ve days from a higher 
high. It should represent a 
signiﬁ cant peak.
Minor Highs and Lows

C H A P T E R

14 ■CHAPTER 2 Minor Highs and Lows
Th e same situation occurs at D with a higher high 
occurring three days later. Nevertheless, I consider 
peaks B and D to be minor highs. Grasp the concept 
that a minor high is a signifi cant peak in a price 
trend and worry less about counting days between 
peaks. Once you train your eyes to see minor highs, 
you will not need to count. It also helps if you are 
sober. 
Valleys: Minor Lows
In a manner similar to minor highs, minor lows are 
valleys separated by at least fi ve days from a lower 
low. Th at means fi ve days before to fi ve days after the 
minor low.
Exhibit 2.2 shows an example, with asterisks high-
lighting minor lows. 
DEFINITION:
Minor lows 
A minor low is a valley separated 
by about ﬁ ve days from a lower 
low. It should represent a 
signiﬁ cant bottom.

Candle C is another example of a bottom that is 
not strictly a minor low because it is too close to lower 
candles. However, if this were the left shoulder of a 
head-and-shoulders bottom, then I would probably 
consider it a valid minor low. 
In other words, be flexible when searching for mi-
nor lows. If it looks like price is making a turn, then it 
is a minor low. If you need to count the price bars to be 
sure it is a minor low, then do so.
For example, valley A is below the adjacent price 
bars such that none are lower than it is for at least five 
days on either side. 
Look at B. Notice the absence of an asterisk.  
If you count five candles to the right of B, you will  
see that a price bar is slightly lower than B (it may  
be hard to tell, so just take my word for it). Candle  
B is not strictly a minor low, but I consider it one  
anyway.

The inset shows bottoms with two days of sepa-
ration instead of five, highlighted with asterisks. 
Notice that point E qualifies, but does it look like 
a minor low? No. It appears as part of the upward 
price trend and not a significant turning point. It is 
not a minor low.
In the next chapter, I discuss trendlines, and there 
are three types. Can you name them? 
Need a hint? One is curved, but the others are not 
straight and diagonal. Wait until you read my exercis-
es. You may find it easier to eat a bowling ball than to 
get them right!

rendlines are to technical analysis as hammers 
are to carpentry. Knowing how to use trendlines 
properly can save you money and allow you to enter a 
new trade with confi dence.
At the end of the last chapter, I asked if you could 
name the three types of trendlines. Th ey are internal, 
external, and curved. Before I get to that, let us discuss 
scaling (this is not a fi sh joke).
Exhibit 3.1 shows a chart on the logarithmic price 
scale. Notice that the price divisions at A (lower right) 
are spaced further apart than they are at B (upper 
right). On charts that show price making large moves 
(such as charts using weekly or monthly data), the log 
scale will make chart patterns taller at the lower end 
of the scale so you can see them better.
I drew a line connecting the peaks. Th e line slopes 
downward and touches each peak using a straight line. 
Th e same exhibit on the linear scale looks warped, 
but it could be your eyeglasses. Check for scratches. 
(See Exhibit 3.2.)
A curved line touches the same peaks. Why? Each 
vertical division is the same height whereas in the pri-
or exhibit, price was on the log scale.
Which scale should you use to view chart patterns? 
Hint: I prefer the log scale. Most of the charts in this 
book are on the linear scale.
For an example of why scaling is important, look at 
Intel during the technology bubble of 2000 (monthly, 
linear scale). Exhibit 3.3 shows a price mountain that 
would make Tenzing Norgay pause.
A descending triangle appears in 1998. Notice that 
at the lower price ranges, you cannot see any other 
chart patterns. Th e price looks smooth as if a giant 
stomped on the foothills (until 1995, anyway).
Compare the same chart using a log scale. (See 
Exhibit 3.4.)
Th e rugged terrain becomes apparent. Other chart 
patterns appear, too, such as a rising wedge and a 
second descending triangle. Which scale would you 
rather use?
19
KEY POINT: 
The logarithmic price scale gives 
a clearer view of historical price 
data when the stock makes a large 
vertical move. Chart patterns are 
easier to see on the log scale.

Trendlines

20 ■CHAPTER 3 Trendlines
However, whenever you need to physically mea-
sure the height of a chart pattern (like using a ruler 
held up to a computer screen), use the linear scale. For 
example, measuring one inch on the linear scale may 
mean a $10 rise, but on the log scale, that same one 
inch could measure $50. Height becomes important 
for the measure rule, which I will discuss later in the 
book.
Whichever scale you decide to use, do not go ﬂ ip-
ping from log to linear to log. It will only confuse you. 
Pick one scale and stay with it when searching for 
chart patterns. Only switch when needed.
Uptrend Connections
Price forms trends. Sometimes, you can connect those 
trends with lines, called trendlines. Most often those 
lines will be diagonal and straight, but not always.
When you look at a price chart, look for places 
where price trends. In your mind, connect the 
DEFINITION:

When price trends, a line 
connecting them is called a 
trendline.

valleys with a straight line, highlighting an up-
sloping trend.
For example, Exhibit 3.5 shows price trending at 
blue line A (far left). Th e line works well, meaning it 
follows the minor lows until F, G, and H. Th ose candles 
poke through the line. In fact, H begins a new trend 
downward.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Use the linear/arithmetic scale 
when physically (think inches, 
not price) measuring the height 
of a chart pattern.
Line B shows a horizontal price trend, also drawn 
along the minor lows. Trendlines C and D are about 
the same length as A and at nearly the same slope.
As you experiment with drawing trendlines, you 
may discover that steep, up-sloping trendlines do 
not last long. Why? Because traders take profi ts if the 
stock rises too fast. Th at selling pressure will force the

stock to move sideways or down, piercing the trend-
line—at least temporarily.
Shallower trendlines tend to be powerhouses. 
From them, strong moves are born. In between the 
shallow and vertical trendlines are the also-rans. Th ey 
show breaks in the prevailing short- to intermediate-
term trend only to see a new trend emerge, perhaps at 
a shallower angle.
Look at trendline E, drawn in red. It is the longest 
on the chart, and it is also the most important. Why? 
Because price plunges through it in July, signaling the 
end of the uptrend.
Notice that I have drawn each up-sloping trendline 
along the valleys and not the tops. Why? To signal a 
trend change. Up-sloping trendlines drawn along 
peaks will not do that. 
SMART INVESTOR TIP
In a rising price trend, draw 
trendlines along the valleys to 
detect a change in trend, from up 
to down.

Trendline Types: Internal, 
External, and Curved
Trendline A is (Exhibit 3.5) called an internal trend-
line because it slices through price at F and G (H does 
not count because it ends the trend). 
Th e thinking behind drawing internal trendlines is 
that the line best represents the majority of traders. 
Few will receive a fi ll at the day’s exact high or low, so 
why draw a trendline connecting those outliers? 
DEFINITION:
Internal trendline
An internal trendline slices 
through price.
I have a diﬀ erent view. If I were to place a stop be-
low the trendline, I do not want to be stopped out be-
cause my trendline sliced through price and an outlier 
hit my stop. I prefer to draw my trendlines like line C. 
Th is line follows the price bottoms as it trends. Line 
C is an example of an external trendline. An external 
trendline connects only the price ends; it does not 
slice through price.
Line I represents the third type of trendline: a 
curved trendline. It begins straight, but curves over 
DEFINITION:
External trendline
An external trendline hugs the 
end of price.
DEFINITION:
Curved trendline
A curved trendline also hugs 
price, but it is curved (although a 
curved trendline can be external 
or internal, too).

at the top of the inverted and ascending scallop chart 
pattern. Curved trendlines become important for 
some chart patterns and for parabolic moves (curved 
moves that resemble a biplane ﬂ ying level then going 
vertical). 
Draw trendlines for the best fi t. If a trendline hap-
pens to slice through price, do not get your knickers 
in a twist. If a curved line better represents a trend, 
then use it.
Downtrend Connections
Down trendlines are the same as up trendlines except 
you draw them along peaks. Why? To detect a trend 
change. 
KEY POINT: 
Draw trendlines for the best ﬁ t, 
whether they look curved or slice 
through price.
Steep trendlines stop 
trending sooner than 
shallow ones.

Exhibit 3.6 shows an example of several trendlines 
highlighting a falling stock. Line A is short and steep. 
It is an external trendline that touches the candle tops 
three times.
I originally drew line B from the start in May un-
til point B, but then extended it. It touched another 
candle at the line’s end, forming a chart pattern called 
a bump and run reversal bottom. Th e pattern predicts 
an upward breakout, which is what happened. I used 
to call them bump and run formations but changed it 
because of the acronym (BARF).
Line C, drawn in red, is a major trendline not 
only for its length, but also because it signals a trend 
change. Price not only slices through the line at E, but 
closes above it. A new up trend may be underway. 
Minor low D fi nds support near the trendline, too, 
although price pierced the trendline for a day before 
reversing. Th e E to D move is a throwback, a pattern I 
will discuss in a later chapter.
Notice the two chart patterns outlined in blue on 
the far left of the chart. Th ose are broadening tops. 
A top trendline connects the peaks and a bottom 
trendline connects the valleys, creating a megaphone 
appearance. 
If you know how to draw trendlines, you probably 
could have found these two patterns. Not only do 
trendlines signal a trend change, but they also outline 
pattern boundaries.
On a price chart, look for peaks that align. Draw 
trendlines connecting them to see what they reveal. 
Draw trendlines along valleys and see what they show, 
DEFINITION:

but also outline chart patterns.
too. Th is is especially signifi cant along the hard right 
edge (the right side of the chart) because trends there 
suggest where price is going in the future.
Th e two videos describe a methodology for draw-
ing trendlines and how to detect a trend change.
Trendline Guidelines
Now that we have experimented with drawing trend-
lines, what are the guidelines and tips for their use? 
Here is a nine-item list. 
 1. Trendlines should connect at least two peaks 
(minor highs) or two valleys (minor lows), prefer-
ably three or more.
 2. Like horseshoes and hand grenades, closeness 
counts. Price need not touch the trendline, but it 
should come close.
 3. To detect a trend change, draw trendlines along 
the valleys when price is trending up. Draw trend-
lines along the peaks in a declining stock.

26 ■CHAPTER 3  Trendlines
	 4.	 Trendlines with widely spaced touches are more 
significant than are those with narrow ones (I 
proved this).
	 5.	 In 2006, I wrote in my book Getting Started in Chart 
Patterns, “Trendlines are like diving boards. You 
get a bigger bounce from a longer diving board 
than a shorter one.”
	 6.	 Steep trendlines underperform shallow ones.  
That means larger moves occur after a trend-
line pierce from a shallow trendline than a steep  
one.
	 7.	 Rising volume along an up-sloping trendline 
powers (a larger decline) price downward after a 
trendline break more than does a receding volume 
trend leading to the breakout.  
	 8.	 For downward sloping trendlines, receding vol-
ume leads to better performance after price pierc-
es the trendline, moving up.
	 9.	 Just because price closes above a down-sloping 
trendline or below an up-sloping one is no reason 
to believe that the trend has changed. It is only a 
hint of a trend change, not a guarantee.

The next chapter discusses one of the most im-
portant topics: support and resistance. If you can de-
termine when price is going to reverse, you can make 
a bundle. If you save wisely and invest carefully, you 
can retire at 36 just as I did. Learning about support  
and resistance is a good first step to achieving that goal.

f trendlines are like hammers, then support and re-
sistance (SAR) are like boards. Price stalls or even 
reverses at SAR areas and that makes predicting fu-
ture price trends easier. Fortunately, there are many 
techniques that show SAR, and this chapter discusses 
them.
In the fall of 1987, a friend of mine said that she 
had purchased shares in a mutual fund. Th is was her 
ﬁ rst time investing in the stock market, and she was 
excited! 
On black Monday, October 19, 1987, the Dow Jones 
industrials lost over 22 percent of their value in one 
session. 
She was not excited! In fact, she vowed to sell as 
soon as she got her money back, which she did.
Her behavior is typical of novices. Imagine that 
others acted the same way. Th eir emotional selling 
would force price down. People buying the stock just 
before the drop or as the selling begins also get upset 
as the stock tumbles. Th ey vow to sell when they get 
their money back, too. 
If you were to plot this behavior on a chart, you would 
see the stock peak and then peak again near the same 
price. Th at concerted selling forms a barrier to upward 
movement called overhead resistance. Price will eat 
through that resistance, so it is not made of concrete.
A similar behavior pattern exists for valleys. People 
want to buy a stock at $10, but price gaps higher and 
zooms away from them, rising to $15. Th ey missed 
the move and vow to buy the stock if it ever gets back 
to $10.
When the stock drops to $10, they buy, joining oth-
ers doing the same thing. Th at buying demand builds 
a ﬂ oor underneath the stock, which we call support. 
Th e ﬂ oor is not made of concrete either, so price can 
act as termites do and eat its way through.
Support and resistance is human nature at 
work—a pictorial representation of emotion.
DEFINITION:
Overhead resistance
Overhead resistance occurs 
when selling pressure overcomes 
buying demand, sending price 
lower—at least for a time.
DEFINITION:
Support
Underlying support occurs when 
buying demand overcomes 
selling pressure, putting a 
temporary ﬂ oor beneath the stock.

C H A P T E R4

30 ■CHAPTER 4 Support and Resistance
Support and resistance represent areas or bands
where price is likely (but not guaranteed) to stall or 
reverse. Price can motor through a support zone and 
a week later, it will stop there as if taking a snooze at a 
roadside rest stop.
Trendline SAR
Trendlines highlight and act as SAR areas. For example, 
Exhibit 4.1 shows a trendline connecting the valleys 
beginning at A, touching B, C, D, and E. At F, however, 
price pierces the trendline, heading down. 
Notice that at G, H, and I, price bumps up against 
a ceiling formed by the same trendline. Th e trendline 
that once acted as support now acts as resistance.
Th e blue trendline shows the same principle, but 
not as clearly. Th e trendline acts as support from J to 
M and as overhead resistance at N and O.
After drawing a trendline, imagine what price 
might do in the future. By extending trendline AF,

resistance and resistance areas 
can act as support.

a trader can guess where price might reverse when it 
hits the trendline. 
Trendlines can be powerful prediction tools, but 
they do not always work.
Down-sloping trendlines show the same behavior 
by acting as support or resistance at any time. An 
example of this is trendline PQR. Down-sloping 
trendline PQ acts as overhead resistance at the two 
peaks, and at R it acts as underlying support.
SAR at Gaps
Price gaps when the day’s low remains above the pri-
or day’s high, leaving a bullish gap on the daily chart. A 
bearish gap forms when the day’s high remains below 
the prior day’s low. 
Exhibit 4.2 shows examples of several gaps that act 
as support and resistance. I measured how often gaps 
show SAR (support: 20 percent, resistance: 25 percent) 
DEFINITION:
Price gaps
A price gap is a blank area on the 
chart that shows the high price 
below the prior day’s low, or the 
low price above the prior day’s 
high. Gaps do not work well as 
support or resistance areas.

and found them to be as reliable as a coworker who 
promised to pick me up at the airport and then forgot.
Gap A has diﬃ  culty supporting price at valley B. At 
peak C, it does provide overhead resistance to block 
the upward move.
Gap D shows support at valley E (notice that price 
pierces the gap but soon reverses) and resistance at 
peak F before the eﬀ ect wears oﬀ . 
In February, gap G supports price, but the support 
melts like snow in spring during the strong downtrend 
in March. 
Now look at gaps H, I, J, and K. Th ose gaps do not 
impede price at all. 
In candlestick land, gaps are called windows prob-
ably because traders that depend on gaps climb out 
windows and jump. 
Horizontal Consolidation 
Regions
Unless you have read my other books, you probably 
have never heard of horizontal consolidation regions 
(HCRs), and yet they are some of the most powerful 
SAR areas (they work 41 percent to 55 percent of the 
time). Exhibit 4.3 shows examples.
An HCR is an area on the price chart where the 
stock crawls horizontally. Th e best HCRs have ﬂ at 
tops, ﬂ at bottoms, or both. When an HCR appears in 
the path leading to a chart pattern, any breakout that 
takes price back into the path of the HCR will often 
run into support or resistance. 
DEFINITION:
Horizontal consolidation 
regions (HCRs)
A horizontal consolidation 
region is an area of horizontal 
price movement that has lots of 
price overlap with a ﬂ at bottom, 
ﬂ at top, or both. When price 
bumps against it, the stock often 
reverses direction or stalls. Long 
and tight HCRs (lots of price 
overlap) work better than do short 
or loose ones (meandering price).
To explain this, the inset shows the ideal case. A 
horizontal consolidation region appears as the grey 
box. Price drops out of this area and heads down, 
eventually forming a symmetrical triangle chart pat-
tern. After an upward breakout from the triangle, 
price climbs to the HCR region (the area between the 
red lines) and then reverses.
Th e rest of Exhibit 4.3 shows how HCRs can act. 
For example, at A, price forms an HCR about a month 
long, and I show it bounded by two red lines extended 
into the future. At D, the HCR is a ceiling that acts as 
overhead resistance. At B and C, price stops at a new 
level of overhead resistance. 
Th e area between D and G is a weak HCR because price 
tends to meander. Area E ﬁ nds support in the DG region. 
I drew the blue trendline, starting at F, toward G, 
just to see where it was in relation to the DG horizontal 
consolidation region. Notice that F ﬁ nds support at 
the bottom of the DG area.
Round Number SAR
Support and resistance is a product of fear and greed, 
and round number SAR ﬁ ts into that deﬁ nition as 
snugly as a bug in a rug. 
When novice traders buy a stock, they ask their 
brokers to buy at $10 and not at $9.91. Th ose round 
numbers—numbers that end in a zero—tend to 
show support and resistance. When traders set 
price targets, they choose round numbers at which 
to sell—$50 and not $49.87. When investors pick 

Visual Guide to Chart Patterns ■33
the same round number at which to trade, their 
buying and selling creates overhead resistance or 
underlying support. Exhibit 4.4 shows examples of 
this behavior.
Circled in red are areas that either touch or come 
close to the blue lines. Th e blue lines are round num-
bers like 20, 30, 40, and so on.
A good example of round number SAR is at A in the 
upper middle of the chart. Price bumps up against 80 
from May to December before throwing in the towel 
and giving up.
Since people will be selling at round numbers, get 
in ahead of them. Instead of selling at 80, sell at 79.93. 
Apply the same logic to stop placement. Avoid 
round numbers because that is where many novice 
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Do not place orders to buy and 
sell, or place stop loss orders at 
numbers ending in zero. That is 
where everyone else will place 
their orders, perhaps triggering 
unusual price moves.

triggering more stops, and so on. The selling pres-
sure forces price to tumble in what is called running 
or gunning the stop. If this happens to your stock, do 
not shoot yourself. Aim for something less valuable. 
You can use round numbers to guess where price 
is going to stall, even if it has never reached that high 
before (no apparent overhead resistance). 
For example, if a stock is breaking out to new  
highs at 17, you can guess that it will run into  
overhead resistance at 20. Traders and investors

will use 20 as a sell point, and if enough actually 
sell, price will reverse there. Beat the crowds and sell 
at 19.95.
Day traders can use round numbers, too, as tar-
gets. When price reaches a round number, consider 
selling. 
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Use the next closest round 
number (a number ending with a 
zero) to guess where price is going 
to stall or reverse, even if the 
stock has never climbed that high.

Price closes an exhaustion 
gap (H) 64 percent of the 
time within a week, on 
average, in a bull market.

36 ■CHAPTER 4 Support and Resistance
Starting on the left, an ascending triangle appears 
at G. Th e horizontal consolidation region has a ﬂ at 
top, but it looks loose with price wandering up and 
down between the two red trendlines. Th at region 
should show support or resistance in the future, and 
it does. Th e symmetrical triangle forms in the middle 
of the HCR and point I on the far right also peaks near 
the top of G.
H is an exhaustion gap. Notice that price later 
ﬁ nds support at the bottom of the gap.
Th e symmetrical triangle is a delight because it is 
a perfect example of the chart pattern. Price bounces 
from trendline to trendline, ﬁ lling the pattern with 
movement. Th e tops and bottoms of the pattern touch 
each trendline without leaving whiskers behind for 
your shaver.
Notice that price turns at A, directly above the tri-
angle apex. I will discuss this behavior in a later chap-
ter (see Chapter 26).
Th e apex is also a place of future support and 
resistance (as is the entire triangle, for that matter). 
Although valley B slides below the apex, it does 
reverse within the triangle. 
DEFINITION:
Exhaustion gap
An exhaustion gap appears at the 
end of a trend. Price usually closes 
the gap within a week or two.
Th e horizontal red line joining peaks C and D 
show peak SAR. Price bumps up against a ceiling 
there. During an advance, expect price to reverse at 
the level of a prior peak (it may not, so keep that in 
mind, too).
Th is idea also applies to valleys. Circled in blue is 
a loose horizontal congestion region at E. When price 
attempts to exceed this level at F, it hits the HCR and 
ﬁ nds overhead resistance. 
Finally, price drops to ﬁ nd support at K setup by 
peak J (and the loose congestion area to its left). 
When looking at price trends, imagine where price 
may stall or reverse. Th ose reversals can happen at the 
price level of prior peaks, prior valleys, horizontal con-
gestion regions, gaps, trendlines, chart patterns, and 
round numbers. 
It sounds like I am covering every possible number 
on the price chart, right? Have faith that price will re-
verse at support or resistance and when it fails, squeal 
like a stuck pig.
Th e next chapter discusses four types of gaps. 
Traders love gaps. Why? I have no idea. I prefer 
women. 
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Objects that show support will 
often show resistance in the 
future and vice versa.

here are several types of gaps, but we will cover 
only four of them. Others, like the ex-dividend gap 
and the opening gap, are inconsequential or too ad-
vanced.
Gaps are exciting! Th ose that appear at a chart 
pattern breakout can push a stock like a booster stage 
does to a rocket. For example, breakout day gaps 
in symmetrical triangles (bull markets, up break-
outs) show gains averaging 36 percent compared to 
28 percent for those without gaps.
Sometimes the booster stage fails to ignite as it 
does in ascending triangles. Th ere, gaps hurt perfor-
mance: 29 percent versus 35 percent gain for those 
with and without gaps, respectively. 
Being able to tell the gap type can help traders de-
cipher what will happen with the stock. Will a stock 
begin a new price trend as it does after a breakaway 
gap, or will an exhaustion gap signal the party is over 
faster than champagne left uncorked?
Four Types
I show a bar chart to ﬁ nd examples of the four major gap 
types: area, breakaway, continuation, and exhaustion. 
Th e bar chart makes ﬁ nding gaps easier. (See Exhibit 5.1.)
Look at gap B1, located to the right of the circled 
congestion region. A breakaway gap always leaves 
a congestion area. A congestion area is where price 
moves sideways for a time. It can be just a few days 
wide—or more—like that circled. Th e breakaway gap 
breaks away from the area, hence its name.
Slaloming downhill, we ﬁ nd gap E1. Th is is an ex-
ample of an exhaustion gap. Th e gap exhausts the 
trend, thus its name. After an exhaustion gap, expect 
to see a quick reversal, sometimes a powerful one, but 
also one that does not last long.
Gap A1, on the far left of the chart, is an area gap. 
Th ese little stinkers carry a load in their pants. Th ey look 
like breakaway gaps, but a trend does not develop. Th e 
gap closes quickly by curling around and ﬁ lling the gap.
DEFINITION:
Gap closes
A gap is said to close when future 
price action covers the same price 
level as the gap. Price ﬁ lls the 
gap, closing it.

trend. Continuation gaps are rare, and I found only 
one on the far right of the chart.
Identiﬁ cation Guidelines
What diﬀ erentiates gaps? Th e following table desc-
ribes what to look for.
Th e inset shows an ideal example of the last type 
of gap, a continuation gap. A trend develops with a 
breakaway gap (B) that appears after a congestion re-
gion. Th en a continuation gap appears (Co) during the 
trend. An exhaustion gap (E) ends the trend. 
A continuation gap is also known as a measuring 
gap because it sometimes forms midway in a price 
DEFINITION:
Measuring gap
A continuation, measuring, or 
runaway gap is one that appears 
midway in a price trend. Measure 
from the start of the trend to the 
gap and project from the gap 
onward to determine how far 
price might move.

I studied each gap type and found that area gaps 
close in an average of 3 days. 
Breakaway gaps take an average of 136 days to 
close in a bull market, upward trend, and 168 days in 
a downward trend.
Continuation gaps close in an average of 98 days 
(uptrends) and 77 days (downtrends). 
Exhaustion gaps close in 9 days (uptrends) and 
14 days (downtrends).
Exercise
When I visit my dentist every year, I pull out the 
Highlights magazine and search the drawing for a 
comb, rake, toothbrush, and other utensils hidden on 
the page. Th e exercises that accompany several chap-
ters in this book are just like that search except that 
here you are looking for chart patterns.
Th e next chart tests your knowledge of gaps, based 
on the earlier table and discussion. Try to identify 
each gap. Th e numbers point to the gaps and the asso-
ciated volume. All four gap types appear in Exhibit 5.2.
Exhibit 5.3 shows the answers.
Breakaway gaps exit a congestion area as if it were 
on ﬁ re, so they are easy to spot. Sometimes, however, 
they become area gaps. Continuation gaps are rare 
and will appear only in strong price trends. It took a 
while to ﬁ nd a chart that had them. Exhaustion gaps 
end a trend, so look for a strong trend, and ﬁ nd a gap 
that leads to a consolidation region. 
Gap Type
Discussion
Area, Common, or 
Pattern:
Occurs in areas of congestion (trendless markets) and close rapidly. Volume on the day of the 
gap can be high, but returns to normal in a day or two. No signiﬁ cant highs (in uptrends) or 
lows (in downtrends) occur immediately after the gap. A distinctive curl as the gap closes is a 
key indication of this gap type.
Breakaway:
Identiﬁ es the start of a new trend and occurs on breakout from a consolidation region. Is 
accompanied by high volume on the day of the gap and continuing for several days. The trend 
continues long enough for several new highs (for uptrends) or new lows (downtrends) to 
occur after the gap.
Continuation, 
Measuring, or 
Runaway:
Happens in the midst of a straight-line advance or decline. Price continues making new highs 
or lows without ﬁ lling the gap. Volume is usually high, propelling price in the direction of the 
trend. 
Exhaustion:
Occurs at the end of a trend on high volume. The gap is not followed by new minor highs 
or minor lows and the gap itself may be unusually tall. After the gap, price consolidates. 
Commonly occurs after a continuation gap. The gap closes quickly, usually within a week.

42 ■CHAPTER 5 Gaps
Trading Gaps
If you are a day trader, the only gaps important to you 
are opening gaps. Other intraday gaps that may ap-
pear happen because of low volume. Ignore them.
If you are a swing trader, then gaps are important. 
When a gap forms out of a consolidation region on 
high volume, you know that a trend is underway. It is 
a buy signal (but not one you should necessarily take). 
If a trend fails to appear, then the gap becomes an 
area gap. Th at situation should become clear if the gap 
closes in two or three price bars. If the gap closes, exit 
the trade immediately.
Area gaps show a hook as price curls back to the 
gap. Th at hook should happen within a handful of 
price bars of the gap. If it does not, then it is a break-
away gap. 
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Very large gaps, especially 
well into a trend, are usually 
exhaustion gaps.

When a gap appears in a strong price trend that 
is already underway, it is probably an exhaustion 
gap. It could be a continuation gap, so waiting an-
other price bar or two should provide confirma-
tion, and perhaps a better exit price. If you see lots 
of overlap between one gap bar and the next, then 
it is an exhaustion gap and time to sell. If the trend 
continues with little overlap, then it is a conti- 
nuation gap. 
Since continuation gaps are rare, a gap in a trend 
already underway is most likely an exhaustion gap.
Gap Measure Rule
For continuation gaps, measure from the start of the 
trend to the middle of the gap and project upward 
from the middle of the gap to get a price target. 
For example, in Exhibit 5.3, continuation gap 7 
shows a trend start at A that ends at B. The gap is

about midway in the trend. To put numbers to this, 
the low at A is at 18.95 and the middle of the gap is at 
21.57 for a height of 2.62. Th at gives a target of 21.57 + 
2.62 or 24.19. Th e high at B is at 25.45
Some say that continuation gaps follow breakaway 
gaps (I have not veriﬁ ed this). If the trend is already 
underway, but a breakaway gap did not appear, then 
you are probably looking at an exhaustion gap. Also, 
exhaustion gaps can be very large. If the gap you are 
seeing is tall, then it is probably an exhaustion gap. 
If you do see an exhaustion gap, consider trading 
the new direction. Violent reversals can accompany

amples. Notice that the new trend lasts for about a 
week, so you have to be nimble trading these.

know the diﬀ erence between them, besides spelling?

to football? I have no idea what that means.

hrowbacks and pullbacks are important patterns. 
Why? Because they happen about half the time 
after the breakout from a chart pattern. Not knowing 
about them invites disaster when the stock returns to 
the breakout price and continues lower. You sell for a 
loss only to watch the stock recover.
Exhibit 6.1 provides a typical example of what a 
throwback looks like. 
Imagine that you have a buy stop placed a penny 
above the top of this ascending triangle. Th e order 
triggers at A. Since you are a seasoned pro, you always 
use a stop and decide to place it below the prior minor 
low, at D. 
Price rises for a few days and then the company an-
nounces earnings before the market opens, at C. Th e 
stock opens below the bottom trendline and then plum-
mets far enough to catch your stop and take you out of 
the trade. By day’s end, the stock has closed higher!
Th e injury to your ego continues when the stock 
performs like a killer bee chasing a bird, soaring 
38 percent to B.
Congratulations! You have just been stung by a 
throwback.
Pullbacks
You learn from your mistake and decide that you 
placed the stop too close. In your next trade, you 
are looking to boost income so you select the divi-
dend paying utility stock shown in Exhibit 6.2, and 
buy at A.
Since ascending triangles break out upward 67 per-
cent of the time in a bull market, you feel conﬁ dent 
that this stock will do well. You place a stop loss order 
further away this time, a penny below the bottom of 
the triangle, at B.
DEFINITION:
Throwback
A throwback occurs after an 
upward breakout when price 
returns to the breakout price or 
chart pattern boundary within 
30 days.

Th e day after you buy the stock, it breaks out down-

32 percent above your buy price. Not only did you take 
a loss, but you missed out on all of those dividend 
checks.

50 ■CHAPTER 6  Throwbacks and Pullbacks
Look at Exhibit 6.3, which helps explain the average 
behavior of throwbacks and pullbacks.
The left panel shows a throwback. Buying enthusi-
asm pushes price upward until it explodes out the top 
of any chart pattern. However, that buying demand 
slowly fades in the face of mounting selling pressure. 
In an average of six days, the stock has peaked after 
climbing 8 percent. Then it begins the return trip to 
the chart pattern. 
The return takes only four days to either touch or 
come near the trendline boundary or breakout price, 
for a total of 10 days to make the round trip.
From there, price may continue lower or it may  
rebound immediately. In 65 percent of the cases, price

resumes the upward breakout direction and rises. 
Th e other 35 percent close below the bottom of the chart 
pattern.
Pullbacks show a similar pattern except they apply 
to downward breakouts from any chart pattern. Price 
shoots lower at the breakout when excessive selling 
overpowers weak buying demand. 
In an average of six days, the stock has bottomed 
and buying demand reverses the downtrend. Th e re-
turn journey takes ﬁ ve days for a total of eleven for the 
round trip from breakout to pullback. 
Price may continue rising from there, and in 53 
percent of the cases it does by closing above the top 
of the chart pattern. Th e remaining 47 percent of the 
time, the stock drops.
Exhibit 6.3 shows averages of thousands of chart 
patterns, so each individual case may vary. 
Not all chart patterns will throwback or pullback, 
either. Th e accompanying table shows the throwback 
and pullback rates for popular chart patterns.
Th e highest throwback rate is for rectangle 
tops, and triple tops have the highest pullback rate. 
Descending triangles have the lowest throwback rate 
and rectangle tops have the lowest pullback rate.

N
ow that we are experts at identifying minor highs 
and lows, drawing trendlines, and knowing what 
support and resistance look like, let us begin by fi nd-
ing our fi rst chart pattern: a rectangle. 
Th ink of a rectangle as a sewer pipe snaking through 
a construction site. It has a fl at top and fl at bottom, and 
price is a rattlesnake winding its way through the pipe. 
Exhibit 7.1 shows an example of a rectangle bottom.
After trending downward, the stock bumped up 
against an invisible ceiling of overhead resistance and 
stood on a fl oor of underlying support from October 
to December, forming a rectangle bottom. 
Th at ceiling and fl oor I show as two horizon-
tal trendlines in red. Notice that price touches each 
trendline three times on the top (1–3) and three on the 
bottom (4–6). Also notice that price enters the pattern 
from the top, trending down. 
Th e exit from the chart pattern, called a breakout, 
is downward in this example, but can be in any direc-
tion for rectangles. I highlight the breakout location in 
the exhibit. Price must close below the bottom of the 
rectangle to stage a downward breakout.
Notice the volume trend. Just before the breakout, 
volume recedes to a low level. Many times volume will 
fall off  dramatically a day or two before the breakout 
of most chart patterns (not just rectangles).
Identiﬁ cation Guidelines
Rectangles are rare, so fi nding them is about as com-
mon as seeing a hummingbird in the middle of a 
housing subdivision. Th e following table lists the iden-
tifi cation guidelines.
KEY POINT: 
In a rectangle, price moves 
horizontally between overhead 
resistance and underlying support.

A breakout occurs when price 
closes outside the boundary of a 
chart pattern.

Price Trend
The short-term price trend leading 
to the rectangle is downward for 
bottoms and upward for tops.
Horizontal 
Trendlines
Two horizontal, or nearly so, 
trendlines bound price along the 
top and bottom of the rectangle.

When searching a chart for rectangles, begin look-
ing for a congestion region where price moves hori-
zontally, often for weeks. In fact, the average length of 
1,228 rectangles in a study I did using daily price data 
from 1991 to 2011 was 71 days (about 2 1/2 months). 
Price should bounce between a support zone at the 
bottom and resistance at the top. 
Connect the minor highs with a horizontal or near-
ly horizontal trendline. A similar line drawn below the

Touches
There should be at least two

Volume
For rectangle bottoms: Volume tends 
to follow the breakout direction: 
upward for upward breakouts, and 
downward for downward breakouts. 
For rectangle tops: Volume usually 
recedes until the breakout.

fall off dramatically a 
day or two before the

Visual Guide to Chart Patterns ■57
Volume trends upward during the fi rst half of the 
rectangle and recedes thereafter.
A smaller rectangle appears at E. Th e price trend 
off  the chart to the left shows that this is a rectangle 
bottom because price trends downward into it.
Exhibit 7.3 shows a rectangle bottom on the weekly 
scale. Price trends higher at B, peaks at A, and drops 
into the rectangle bottom. Th ere, price slides be-
tween two horizontal trendlines before breaking out 
upward. 
Notice that the exit trend, C, nearly matches the 
slope of trendline B. In fact, the exit velocity of price 
leading out of a chart pattern nearly matches the ve-
locity going into a pattern. Th at behavior applies not 
only to rectangles, but to all chart pattern varieties. If 
you have limited dollars to spend and fi nd two stocks 
showing chart patterns, choose the one with a higher 
velocity (cents per day).
Notice that volume, D, slopes upward. Th is upward 
slope grows dramatically as price climbs, forming a 
long hill at E that would scare bicyclists like me trying 
to climb it.
I also show price undershoot (F) a few weeks be-
fore the rectangle begins. Ignore it. Undershoot or 
overshoot is a short dip or rise, respectively, before 
the start of a chart pattern. Th e only infl uence they 
have is to confuse novices and give authors like me 
something to write about. 
Th e inbound price trend is downward leading to 
this rectangle bottom (starting from A), not upward 
starting from the undershoot (F).
SMART INVESTOR TIP
The price velocity leading to and 
exiting from a chart pattern are 
often similar even if the direction 
is reversed.
minor lows forms a parallel trendline. Occasionally, 
one of the trendlines will not be horizontal. Th at is 
fi ne providing the slope is not too steep to disturb the 
overall picture. Consider the varying trend lengths. 
At least two touches (but three is better) of each 
trendline are required for a valid rectangle. Th e touch-
es need not alternate from top to bottom, but should 
have at least two clearly defi ned minor highs and two 
minor lows coming close to or touching each trendline. 
In the ideal case, the trendline touches should be 
spaced evenly along the pattern, not bunched together 
on one end only. In other words, the trendline should not 
appear like a diving board, with one end unsupported.
To determine whether the rectangle is a top or 
bottom, look at the price trend leading to the start of 
the rectangle. Rectangle bottoms have price trending 
downward into them, but tops have price trending up-
ward. Ignore any overshoot or undershoot in the price 
bars within a week or so before the start of the rectangle. 
For rectangle bottoms, the volume pattern tends to 
track the breakout direction. For tops, volume often 
recedes over the length of the rectangle. Do not dis-
card a rectangle because the volume pattern is wrong. 
For example, Exhibit 7.2 shows a rectangle top on 
the weekly scale. Price bounces between two horizon-
tal trendlines B and C, touching each plenty of times, 
spread along its length. No diving board here!
Price begins the uptrend at A and although price 
bobbles up and down in early 2004 (before the start 
of the rectangle), it is clear that this rectangle is at the 
top of the trend and not at the bottom. 
DEFINITION:
Trend lengths
A short-term trend lasts up to 
three months. An intermediate-
term or secondary trend lasts 
between three and six months. A 
long-term trend or primary trend 
lasts longer than six months.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Tops have price trending into a 
chart pattern from the bottom, 
and bottoms have price trending 
into a chart pattern from the top.

Since you want to own several hundred thousand 
shares and the stock averages only 16,000 shares 
traded daily, it could take weeks to buy all that you 
want. Why? Because if you hit the market with an or-
der for 450,000 shares, it will likely send price soaring. 
Th at would boost the average cost of ownership.
One tip I learned is that your buying or sell-
ing should not be for more than 1 percent of the 
Rectangle Psychology
Why do rectangles form? Imagine that you run 
a small mutual fund and your fundamental 
and technical analysis says that Friedman In-
dustries is a steal at 5.50. You order the trading 
department to buy the stock at that price. (See 
Exhibit 7.4.)
DEFINITION:
Undershoot or 
overshoot
Both undershoot and overshoot 
occur before a chart pattern 
begins. Undershoot happens 
when price brieﬂ y dips below 
the entrance of a chart pattern. 
Overshoot happens when price 
brieﬂ y soars above it.

Variations

across in your quest to fi nd rectangles. For example, 
KEY POINT: 
A rectangle forms because 
traders want to own the stock at 
two ﬁ xed prices, one low and one 
high, setting limits (for a time) on 
how far price moves.
When price bubbles up to the sell price, the mutual 
fund jumps in and sells as many shares as they can be-
fore forcing the price back down. When it drops to the 
buy price, the other mutual fund begins buying, send-
ing the price higher.
Eventually, one side fulfills their mission to ei-
ther establish a position or liquidate one. The price 
will either drop out of the bottom or rise through 
the top.

Exhibit 7.5 shows an unusual chart pattern, but is it 
a rectangle?
Starting from A, the stock plunges like a bungee 
jumper whose cord breaks, splashing into the wa-
ter, and slowly sinking into the top of the chart pat-
tern. That means this rectangle is a bottom and not 
a top. 
Our jumper surfaces three times near B, touching 
the top trendline. The guidelines say that at least two 
touches are necessary, preferably widely spaced. Does 
this qualify, or is it a diving board? 
Since the chart pattern is so long, the three clus-
tered touches are a problem. However, it helps that C 
is there to hold up the far end of the trendline.

Th is is a rectangle bottom, but not a pretty one. 
If it helps, keep in mind what you are looking 
for—price moving sideways in a horizontal congestion 
region. 
Th e next chart is one that reminds me of an e-mail 
that read as if the sender had overdosed on his medi-
cation. “Is this a fl at base? Is this a rectangle? What 
kind of chart pattern is it? Price gaps up and then goes 
horizontal!” (See Exhibit 7.6.)
Consider redrawing the top trendline parallel at F. 
It will slice through price as an internal trendline, but 
that is fi ne. Draw the line where it best shows over-
head resistance.
Now look at the bottom trendline. How many trend-
line touches do you see? Th e chart shows one at D, but 
the line is drawn incorrectly. Ignore that touch and move 
the line higher until it hugs the price valleys, connecting 
E. If you do that, the support area becomes clearer.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Volume is not an important 
identiﬁ cation feature of most 
chart patterns, including 
rectangles. Volume plays a bigger 
role in performance.

recognize the price pattern as a rectangle bottom, 
that peak ceases to have any significance. Drawing the 
top trendline above peak 1 would make the other top 
touches seem too far away.
The same argument applies to valley 8. Price pokes 
below the red trendline but is not important to the 
overall picture.
The volume trend (F) rises and price breaks out 
upward.
Pattern CED is a rectangle top because price trends 
upward into the chart pattern. Price touches the bot-
tom trendline three times and several times along the 
top. I drew the top trendline through E to show how 
price touches the top trendline better. Also, the first 
bottom touch, B, is part of a straight-line run. It is a 
minor low, but one that is not easy to see without a 
trendline connecting it. This is not a perfect example 
of a rectangle top, but be flexible.
The volume trend (G) is upward even though this 
rectangle breaks out downward. Rectangle tops of-
ten have a receding volume trend, but do not let that 
throw you off. 
Look at pattern J. Did you find this one? The bottom 
trendline touches only one point. I show it redrawn in 
the inset as a V-shaped price trend. This V-shape more 
accurately represents the trend, not a horizontal line. 
The top trendline rests on one peak, H. Point I 
is not a minor high. It is just a price bar on the side 
of a hill, not an individual peak (minor high). Avoid 
counting a trendline touch that is not a minor high or 
minor low. Pattern J is just squiggles on a chart and 
not a rectangle.
One glance at the chart told me all I needed to 
know, but I checked the news anyway. At A, the com-
pany received an offer to merge their operations with 
another company. These types of buyout offers make 
the stock soar and then flatline like a dead animal un-
til the merger completes. 
I do not consider the pattern to the right of A to 
be a rectangle. Why? Because of the news surround-
ing the stock. This is an example of an event pattern—
how a stock behaves after it receives a buyout offer. 
Exercise
This section presents two exercises. Find the rectangles 
on each chart. It will help if you look for minor highs that 
peak near the same price. In your mind, connect those 
peaks with a horizontal trendline. Then look below that 
line for minor lows that bottom near the same price. If 
you find that combination, then you have a rectangle. 
Is it a rectangle top or bottom? Look at the 
short-term price trend leading to the rectangle. Tops 
have price trending upward into the chart pattern and 
bottoms have price trending downward. 
Exhibit 7.7 has at least two rectangles. Find them.
Exhibit 7.8 shows the answer. The pattern high-
lighted in red is a rectangle bottom. Price begins slid-
ing after A, trending down into the chart pattern, just 
as it is supposed to do for a rectangle bottom. Then 
it begins moving horizontally, forming minor highs (1 
through 5) and minor lows (6 through 11). 
The peak at 1 slices through the top trendline, but 
does it matter? No. Why not? Because by the time you

Price trends downward into the chart pattern and

For rectangle top E, the price trend is horizontal 
leading to this pattern but upward before that (sharing 
the same inbound trend as rectangle D). Notice that 
point A is NOT a minor high so it does not qualify as a 
top trendline touch. Be careful about touch counts 
and include only minor highs or minor lows.

Answer the following statements or questions.
1. True or false: A rectangle bottom always has price 
trending down into the chart pattern.
2. True or false: It is fi ne if one of the trendlines bound-
ing the rectangle bottom is almost horizontal.
3. True or false: It is fi ne if both trendlines are not 
horizontal, providing they are not too far from 
level.
4. True or false: A down-sloping volume trend is a key 
factor in determining whether the chart pattern is 
a rectangle bottom.
5. True or false: A breakout occurs when price pierces 
one of the horizontal trendlines.
6. How is a rectangle bottom diff erent from a top 
(pick all that apply)?
A. Rectangle bottoms are shorter in duration.
B. Rectangle bottoms have price entering the chart 
pattern from the bottom, and tops have it entering 
from the top, hence the bottom and top names.
C. Th ey have diff erent names because the volume 
pattern is diff erent.
D. A rectangle bottom is a horizontal consolida-

E. By defi nition, price enters tops from the bottom 
and enters bottoms from the top.

his chapter begins looking at chart patterns not 
bounded by twin horizontal lines. Triangles use a 
more complicated shape: diagonal trendlines. Train-
ing your eye to recognize them is still easy, though, 
because the technique builds on what we have 
learned.
Exhibit 8.1 shows an example of an ascending 
triangle, highlighted by red trendlines.
Price overshoots (A) the entry to this chart pat-
tern, but who cares? Th ere are no ascending triangle 
top and bottom variations to worry about (where 
the inbound price trend is important); there are only 
ascending triangles.
Th e stock breaks out upward at B, which hap-
pens the majority of the time, but this one sees price 
quickly turn down, closing below the bottom of the 
chart pattern at C. When that happens, it busts the 
ascending triangle. 
Th e popularity of ascending triangles stems from 
the belief that price will start a robust uptrend. 
However, I stopped trading most of them because too 
many looked like this chart. Price climbed a few per-
cent and then died, killing my trade as well. 
Some volume disciples will look at the chart and 
say, “Look at volume! It should be well above aver-
age, but it isn’t!” Point D shows the breakout day’s 
volume, and they are right. Volume was well below 
average, but I have seen profi table trends start on 
mediocre volume, too. In fact, I do not even show vol-
ume on my charts. It is as useful to me as asking if fi sh 
like seafood. I am a vegetarian: I eat weeds.
Identiﬁ cation Guidelines
When searching for ascending triangles, look for 
minor highs close together (weeks apart, but usu-
ally not months between tops) that peak near the 
same price. Then look directly below those peaks to 
see if the valleys trend upward following a straight 
line.
KEY POINT:
Ascending triangles are 
wedge-shaped patterns that 
break out most often upward. The 
triangle can act as a reversal or 
continuation of the existing price 
trend.
DEFINITION:
Busts the ascending 
triangle
A busted ascending triangle 
occurs when price breaks out in 
one direction, moves less than 
10 percent before reversing, and 
continues in the new direction to 
close above the top or below the 
bottom of the triangle.

Th e breakout from an ascending triangle can be in 
any direction, but is usually upward.
Th is is another example of a busted ascending 
triangle. Price breaks out downward and does not 
drop far (less than 10 percent) before reversing and 
closing above the top of the triangle. When that hap-
pens, it busts the downward breakout. 
Unfortunately, this bust did not result in a tasty 
move upward. Th at might be because of the extended 
rise leading to the triangle. In fact, the downward 
breakout was a clue to weakness to begin with.
Ascending Triangle 
Psychology
In ascending triangles, price peaks for the same rea-
son it does in rectangles: Traders sell when the stock 
reaches their target price. 
Suppose that Molly runs a mutual fund and 
wants to sell several hundred thousand shares of 
ABC Chewing Gum. Every time the stock reaches 
$35, she sells some. Her selling creates a ceiling on 
the stock.
Harry runs the trading department of a hedge fund, 
and he loves ABC Chewing. When the stock drops to 
30, he buys as many shares as he can, but the stock 
runs away from him and becomes too expensive to 
chase. 
Johnny is a rich swing trader. He watches Mutual 
Fund Molly create overhead resistance at 35 and 
sees Hedge Fund Harry put a ﬂ oor in the stock at 30. 
KEY POINT: 
An ascending triangle forms 
because of increasing demand at 
lower prices matched with selling 
at a constant price.
Price along the top of the ascending triangle 
follows a horizontal or nearly horizontal trendline. 
Along the bottom, the minor lows bounce oﬀ  an up-
sloping trendline drawn connecting them.
Look at Exhibit 8.2.
Minor highs A through D stop near the same price. 
Minor lows E through G touch the bottom trendline. 
Together they form an ascending triangle, only this 
one has a downward breakout. 
Make sure that price crosses the chart pattern 
plenty of times. What you do not want to see is white 
space in the middle of the pattern. I show an example 
of that later in this chapter.
Volume tends to recede over the life of the triangle, 
but that varies from triangle to triangle. Th e chart 
shows volume trending higher in the fi rst half of the 
pattern and then downward leading to the breakout. 
Do not discard an ascending triangle simply because 
of an abnormal volume trend.
KEY POINT: 
When searching for ascending 
triangles, make sure price crosses 
the chart pattern from side to 
side several times. Price should 
not be bunched up near the start 
nor near the end with an empty 
white hole in the middle.
Characteristic
Discussion
Price crossing
Price must cross the pattern from 
side to side, ﬁ lling the triangle with 
movement. Avoid patterns with 
excessive white space in the center 
of the triangle.
Volume
Volume in the pattern recedes 
and can be especially low the day 
before the breakout.
Breakout
Can be in any direction, but is 
upward the majority of the time.

72 ■CHAPTER 8 Ascending Triangles
On the next cycle, Harry has to raise his buy 
price to 31 to stay ahead of the other cannibals. The 
hunt continues until Molly sells all of her shares 
or Harry bags his quota and quits. When one side 
gives up, the other side yells, “Tag! You’re it!” and 
snatches the stock; then a breakout ensues, ending 
the pattern.
When the stock drops to 30.25, he starts buying, 
knowing that he can probably sell when it approaches 
35. “Easy money,” he says and smiles.
Harry sees volume tick up and believes that oth-
ers are buying ahead of him. He raises his buy price 
to 30.50 and starts eating as many shares as he can 
before they disappear from his plate.

but I also think this pattern works as an ascending tri-
angle. It is not perfect, but few chart patterns are. 
You will notice that if I changed the time scale to 
days or intraday, the pattern shape would not change. 
An ascending triangle on the 1-minute scale would 
still have a ﬂ at top and an up-sloping bottom.
Before we move on to the next exhibit, notice the 
head-and-shoulders bottom that appears. Th e pattern 
is a wonderful example of a reversal that signaled the 
turn from bear market to bull. 
Variations
Exhibit 8.3 shows an example of an ascending triangle 
on the weekly scale.
Price touches the top trendline (A) three times at 
three minor highs and the bottom trendline (B) also 
three times, although the individual spikes may be 
hard to see.
Notice the white space at C. I would prefer that A 
slide to the left a bit, fi lling some of that white space,

patterns are, that is fi ne. I just want your eyes to get 
used to seeing a variety of patterns.
Exhibit 8.6 shows the answers, including exam-
ples of how the triangle’s apex aligns with price (see 
Chapter 10).
Compare apex A with turn B, apex E with F, and G 
with H. Above or below each apex is a corresponding 
price turn. Th e turn may not last long or it could start 
a new trend. Th e duration of the turn is unknown, but 
this technique does highlight short-term turns. 
FAST FACTS
The apex of a triangle is where 
price tends to form a short-term 
peak or valley.
Look at pattern C. Price along the bottom of the 
pattern (D) touches the trendline three times (the 
end point does not count since price plunges through 
the pattern there). Along the top, it also touches the 
trendline multiple times, but there is a problem. Th e 
top line is not horizontal.
Does it have to be level? No. Now look at the blue 
inset directly above the triangle. Th is depiction makes 
the top line appear horizontal. Is it an ascending 
triangle or not?

Depending on how you draw the top trend-

I believe that the red image better represents a 
rising wedge and not an ascending triangle.

escending triangles share characteristics of their 
ascending brothers including one horizontal 
trendline and another sloping. 
Exhibit 9.1 shows two examples in red.
Starting in May, the stock drops like a Texas 
hailstone and slams into support at A, bounces sev-
eral times and forms a descending triangle. 
Points A, B, and C highlight valleys that align along 
a horizontal bottom trendline. Along the top, peaks D, 
E, and F touch another line, but this one slopes down-
ward. Th e two trendlines merge at the triangle’s apex.
Volume trends downward (G) until spiking on the 
breakout day, and that behavior is typical of many 
chart patterns.
Be still my heart: Th is is an example of a trad-
ing setup that I love. Price breaks out downward but 
reverses, pushes upward, and closes above the top of 
the triangle. When it does that, it busts the pattern. 
Busted patterns can lead to good performance, as this 
example shows.
I was hesitant to show triangle H because the bot-
tom trendline, although shown fl at, is probably bet-
ter drawn sloping upward. If you redraw it, the pat-
tern becomes a symmetrical triangle, the subject 
of the next chapter. However, the bottoms are close 
enough to the trendline that the pattern qualifi es as a 
descending triangle, too.
Identiﬁ cation Guidelines
Th e following table lists the important characteristics 
that help identify descending triangles.
KEY POINT: 
A descending triangle is a wedge-
shaped chart pattern that breaks 
out downward most often. It can 
act as a reversal or continuation 
of the price trend.

Discussion
Horizontal bottom line
Price along the bottom follows a horizontal trend.
Down-sloping top line
Price along the top slopes downward, following a trendline.
Price crossing
Price must cross the pattern from side to side, ﬁ lling the triangle with 
movement. Avoid patterns with excessive white space in the center of 
the triangle.
Volume
Volume in the pattern recedes and can be especially low the day 
before the breakout.
Breakout
Can be in any direction, but is downward the majority of the time.

SMART INVESTOR TIP
If price touches the bottom 
trendline only twice, it should 
touch the down-sloping trendline 
at least three times. This is not 
a requirement, but ﬁ ve touches 
for many chart patterns works 
well to help avoid selecting 
boneheaded ones.

Visual Guide to Chart Patterns ■83
To help explain the guidelines, look at Exhibit 9.2.
Th e bottom of triangle A shows three touches of a 
horizontal trendline. Th e valleys do not bottom at ex-
actly the same price, but they come close. Th ey look as 
if they belong on the same trendline.
Along the top, B, another trendline connects peaks 
that form at successively lower levels and yet still 
touch the trendline. I look for three touches along the 
diagonal if only two touch the bottom. Th at is a safety 
measure to prevent selecting triangles that are just 
random squiggles on the price chart. 
Price crosses the triangle from side to side, leaving 
no room for white space. Th is is another important 
safety tip to avoid selecting bogus patterns.
Volume typically recedes in the chart pattern, but do 
not discard a descending triangle just because the vol-
ume pattern shows increasing volume. Triangle E has 
U-shaped volume and yet it is a valid descending triangle.
Price can break out of a descending triangle in any 
direction, but most often, it will be downward.
Look at points F through J. Is this a descending tri-
angle? Yes. I dislike only two touches on the top, and 
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Avoid excessive white space 
between the two trendlines when 
selecting descending triangles. 
Price should cross the triangle 
plenty of times to ﬁ ll the area.
Look for at least ﬁ ve 
touches (total) of the 
trendlines to avoid se-
lecting bogus patterns.

research and discover that the stock represents a 
compelling value. I buy too. Together, along with other 
buyers, we send the price moving up.
When the stock hits $6, I dump the turkey, pass Go, 
and collect my $200. Other sellers that view it as over-
valued decide to cash in as well (D).
Th is selling pressure causes price to ease lower and 
eventually trigger more buying at a lower price (B). 
When the stock rises, those that missed selling as the 
stock approached $6 sell now.
Th e cycle of buying and selling continues at E, 
C, F, and G. At G, well into the traditional worst 
performing month of the year (September), selling 
pressure increases, overwhelming buying demand, 
forcing the stock to push through support. Th e stock 
tumbles.
Th e footprint that remains on the chart outlines a 
descending triangle.
Variations
Look at Exhibit 9.4 because it reveals a fl aw in pattern 
identifi cation. 
Price anchors the bottom of the chart pattern 
at A and B with minor low trendline touches at the 
same price. Along the top, price touches the trend-
line multiple times on the way to C. The peak at C 
pokes up through the top of the triangle, staging a 
breakout.
What is wrong with this triangle? It contains too 
much white space in the middle of the pattern. Price

when buyers acquire the stock

of support. Others sell when the 
stock becomes overpriced.
does not cross the triangle from side to side, fi lling the 
chart pattern with price movement. 
If you look at the blue inset, with the triangle 
boundaries removed, you can see that this is nothing 
more than the stock climbing to a peak and withdraw-
ing. It is not a triangle.
Compare pattern ABC with the one in the red inset 
at D. Th e D triangle shows plenty of price crossings as 
well as trendline touches spaced throughout the tri-
angle. Image D is how a descending triangle should 
look.
Exercise
You will likely have diﬃ  culty fi nding a descend-
ing triangle in Exhibit 9.5. Here is a hint: Look for 
the down-sloping trendline fi rst. You should also 
fi nd a double bottom. Another hint? Both are large 
patterns.
Th e next chart (see Exhibit 9.6) reveals the 
descending triangle. It has three touches on the 
top and two on the bottom. Price crosses the pattern 
and fi lls the white space, but because the triangle 
is so large, it may look like too much white space. 
It takes time for price to cross the pattern, so it is 
fi ne.
Notice that the double bottom shares the triangle’s 
space. Both are valid chart patterns.
I think that the next exercise is easy, but then I 
know where to look. You will fi nd a descending tri-
angle, two double tops, one double bottom, and a 
SMART INVESTOR TIP
It is helpful to look at a price chart 
without any trendlines connecting 
the pattern boundaries to make 
sure that what you are seeing is 
really a chart pattern. Can you 
draw each trendline a different 
way, by connecting other nearby 
peaks or valleys? Will others see 
the same pattern as you? If there 
are doubts, then skip the pattern 
and look for another one.

86 ■CHAPTER 9  Descending Triangles
symmetrical triangle. Try to find as many of those as 
you can. (See Exhibit 9.7.)
The descending triangle is at A, in red. Price touch-
es each trendline, forming a beautiful wedge shape. It 
reminds me of the rubber doorstop I use to keep the 
wind from slamming the door shut in summer. (See 
Exhibit 9.8.)
You probably did not select triangle B, and that is 
good because it is not a descending triangle. There is 
too much white space between the trendlines to qual-
ify this as a valid triangle. 
On the right of the chart is a symmetrical triangle. 
It is a more complicated shape, with two converg-
ing trendlines. Unlike ascending and descending tri-
angles, the shape of the pattern does not hint at the 
breakout direction. Symmetrical triangles are as plen-
tiful as fleas on a dog, and can be just as annoying. 
They are the subject of the next chapter.

ymmetrical triangles take pattern recognition to 
a new level. We ditch horizontal trendlines and 
use diagonal ones to outline the pattern. 
Exhibit 10.1 shows a pair of symmetrical triangles 
swimming in a price sea. Th ey remind me of angel-
fi sh I had in my 55-gallon aquarium when I lived near 
Boston.
I like the red triangle at C. Price touches two slop-
ing trendlines that merge at the triangle apex. Directly 
above the apex, in this example, is a price peak. I have 
mentioned this apex and turning behavior before be-
cause it works well and gives traders a clue where the 
trend might shift.
Notice that the blue triangle apex (D) sits beneath 
peak E. It is not as timely (it comes late as price is 
about to slide) as the other triangle’s prediction, but 
it is valuable, too.
Triangle D cuts through price on both trendlines, 
so it is not ideal. Volume trends lower as it does in 
many symmetrical triangles.
Identiﬁ cation Guidelines
Th e following table lists important characteristics 
that help identify symmetrical triangles.

To help explain the guidelines, look at Ex-
hibit 10.2.
Th is is an example of a large symmetrical triangle 
at C, bounded by red trendlines. Price touches each 
trendline three times (twice is a minimum, but I like 
to see three) in distinct minor highs and minor lows. 
As price crosses the chart pattern from side to side, it 
fi lls the white space. Since this is a large example, do 
not expect price to fi ll the entire area. White space will 
be present, but should not look like a cavity too large 
for a dentist to fi ll.
Price turns at the triangle 
apex (DE and BA), but 
the reversal may not last 
long.

Volume recedes, but is often irregular looking. Do 
not discard a symmetrical triangle because the vol-
ume pattern is wrong. 
Th e breakout can be in any direction, including 
horizontal where price oozes out the front of the tri-
angle.
Most symmetrical triangles should be longer than 
three weeks to help distinguish them from pennants. 
Th e exception is when a pennant is missing a fl agpole. 
FAST FACTS
The breakout often occurs 70 to 
75 percent of the way to the tri-
angle’s apex according to a study 
of 1,347 symmetrical triangles.
In that case, the pennant is really a small symmetrical 
triangle.
Symmetrical Triangle 
Psychology
Symmetrical triangles are the epitome of confusion. 
Price does not know which way to trend. Exhibit 10.3 
shows another example of a symmetrical triangle.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Symmetrical triangles should 
be at least three weeks long; 
otherwise they are pennants. 
Pennants always rest upon a 
ﬂ agpole (a straight-line price 
run), so if the pole is missing, the 
pattern is a symmetrical triangle.

Almost as soon as that happens, the bears regroup 
and force price back down, and they keep selling until 
the stock bottoms in August. What remains on the 
chart is a long symmetrical triangle.
Variations
Exhibit 10.4 shows several chart patterns, including some 
that hint of being symmetrical triangles, but are not.
Look at triangle A. What attracts me are the 
three touches of the bottom trendline. Howev-
er, the top shows only two touches. That is not 
optimum.
Triangle B is fl awed because erasing the fi rst touch 
on the bottom makes the line horizontal (but it may 
be diﬃ  cult to see).
Th e top of triangle C is near the middle of the chart pat-
tern instead of the start, making it diﬃ  cult to approve as 
Exhibit 10.4: ASNA US Equity (Ascena Retail Group Inc.)
The widest part of a sym-
metrical triangle should 
be at or near the start, 
not in the middle of the

a valid triangle, too. Nevertheless, all three qualify as sym-
metrical triangles even though none is perfect. 
Now look at pattern D. Along the bottom is an up-
sloping trendline with three touches. Peak D is in the 
middle of the pattern. Using D as the start of the trian-
gle would make it look too lopsided, too unbalanced. 
It is not a symmetrical triangle.
Confused? If any chart pattern looks questionable, 
look for another one. They are as plentiful as ants at 
a picnic.
Pattern E has many touches along the peaks, but 
too much white space on the bottom. It is not a sym-
metrical triangle.
Exhibit 10.5 gives a warning of how not to draw a 
symmetrical triangle.
Price along the bottom touches points A and B, 
widely separated. Along the top are two minor high 
touches.
Look at C. The white space is obvious. This is not 
a symmetrical triangle. It is just a peak with red lines

because it is large with so many trendline 
touches.
Triangle B is harder to spot because the top spike 
upward at the start might not register as a minor 
high touch. Without it, the pattern would resemble 
an ascending triangle.
Triangle C is the hardest to fi nd. It seems buried 
in an area where price is directionless. Th ere are

Exhibit 10.8 has three symmetrical triangles. Also 
look for a descending triangle, head-and-shoulders 
bottom, and Big W, which is a type of double bottom 
with tall sides.
Exhibit 10.9 shows the answers. If you picked A 
as a symmetrical triangle, be careful because candle  
A is not a minor low and should not be used to 
anchor the start of the pattern. However, the pat-
tern does appear wedge shaped. It is a symmetrical 
triangle.
Triangle B is large with plenty of trendline touches 
and should have been easy to spot. 
Point C is the same height as D. That means the 
down-sloping trendline does not quite touch C. Even 
so, I think it is fine as a symmetrical triangle.

to you as well. If you left your hearing aid turned off,

ennants remind me of those pointed streamers 
that line roped-oﬀ  areas at festivals. Th ey are the 
same as fl ags except that the trendlines bounding the 
pattern converge. In fl ags, they are parallel. 
Exhibit 11.1 shows a sprinkling of fl ags and pen-
nants.
Let us start with pennant B. Th is is the kind of pen-
nant that traders dream about. Th e trend begins at 
A in a straight-line run up to the pennant (B). Price 
consolidates, forming a triangle shape (the pennant). 
After that, price resumes a strong move up to C. Th e 
AB move is about the same as BC. Th us, the pennant 
can act as a half-staﬀ  pattern; it can appear midway in 
a price trend. Th e same is true of fl ags and other chart 
patterns, too.
C is another pennant. Unlike B, where price moved 
sideways in the pennant, this one has a more tradi-
tional slope—downward against the trend.
Pennant D, on the far right of the chart, looks like a 
small version of a descending triangle, a pattern that 
has a fl at bottom and down-sloping top.
Flags have parallel trendlines whereas pennants 
converge. Th e fl ags appear in blue, but not because 
they have been holding their breath like a child throw-
ing a tantrum.
Identiﬁ cation Guidelines
Th e following table lists important characteristics to 
help identify fl ags and pennants. For such simple pat-
terns, why does it seem so complicated? 
KEY POINT:
Flags and Pennants
Flags are short chart patterns 
that appear as small rectangles 
in a strong price run. They can 
act as reversals, but are usually 
continuation patterns.
A pennant is a short triangular-
shaped chart pattern. It can act as 
a trend reversal or continuation 
pattern.

Th e easiest way to fi nd a fl ag or pennant is to begin 
with the fl agpole. Look for a straight-line price run. 
Price will consolidate along that run. When it does, it 
can take the shape of a fl ag or pennant. 
To help explain the guidelines, look at Exhibit 11.2.
Th e fl ag pattern begins with the fl agpole, AB. If a 
strong trend (a straight-line price run) does not exist, 
then look elsewhere. Atop the pole, price consolidates 
and forms fl ag BC. After that, price breaks out downward

Flags should form between two parallel or nearly 
parallel trendlines. Th e two lines do not have to be 
exactly parallel. Pennants should form between two 
converging trendlines. For both fl ags and pennants, 
trendline touch count is not important.
Price in the fl ag or pennant can slope in any direc-
tion, including sideways, but is usually against the

prevailing trend. In this case, the trend is up from A to 
B and the fl ag slopes down from B to C.
Volume typically recedes in a fl ag or pennant just 
as it does in many other chart patterns. Th e breakout 
can be in any direction, too, but usually follows the 
trend leading to the fl ag or pennant.
Flags and pennants are short, no longer than three 
weeks. Th is is an arbitrary value. What you are looking 
for is a small knot of congestion in a strong price run. 
Once the knot unties (breaks out), price should con-
tinue on its way.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
A ﬂ ag or pennant can slope in 
any direction, but most often, it 
will lean against the prevailing 
price trend.
Flag F is notable because it rests in the middle of 
the GH move. 
Flag and Pennant Psychology
Exhibit 11.3 highlights one pennant and one fl ag. 
At A, the smart money began buying, believing or 
knowing that a good earnings report was coming.
Two days later, the company announced earnings 
and raised their outlook to the top end of the target 
range while increasing the dividend.

Buying demand propelled the stock higher like an 
overly excited kid gobbling Halloween candy. Th en the 
bears returned to the trading table and started a food 
fi ght with the bulls. Th e fi ght between evenly matched 
opponents pushed price sideways, forming the pennant. 
Th is one had a fl at base and down-sloping top, suggest-
ing a group of investors wanted to buy the stock at a set 
price (49.50) but stopped buying when price climbed too 
high. Th eir buying put a fl oor underneath the stock.
After the bears digested the news and ran for the 
exits, the bulls took over and sent the stock moving 
higher again, rising from C to D. Notice how one good 
earnings report can launch a stock toward the heav-
ens. Or maybe it was the candy.

If the chart pattern does not have 
a ﬂ agpole, then it is not a ﬂ ag or a 
pennant.

Variations
Exhibit 11.4 shows five flags (blue) and two pennants 
(red) with four additional variations in the inset. 
Although the insets show pennants, use your creative 
mind to redraw the pennant trendlines as parallel 
lines for flag variations.
Pennant A forms after a mediocre uptrend. I 
would call it powerful if price broke out of the pen-
nant upward, but it does not. Rather, the pennant 
slopes downward, which is typical, but then price 
continues down, oozing out the end of the pennant 
like caulking. That configuration follows pattern B 
(except for a downward breakout, of course).
Pennant C forms after price gaps lower. The pen-
nant boundary is irregular in shape, but highlights 
a small congestion region where price gathers its 
strength for the coming drop. That drop occurs, com-
pleting the configuration like that shown at D.

In the two insets, I show various pennant shapes 
in up and down trends. Be aware that pennants can 
break out in any direction, so expect that. I show only 
the patterns acting as continuations of the prevailing 
price trend and not reversals.

Exhibit 11.5 has a multitude of fl ags. Try to fi nd as 
many as you can that obey the identifi cation guidelines 
discussed earlier. I found eight and stopped there. 
One is large and may not qualify. Th at is a hint, of 
course.
Exhibit 11.6 shows the answers. I numbered the 
fl ags, making them easier to see. Flag 5 is the likely of-
fender to the three-week rule. It is about a month long. 
Th at would still be fi ne if the fl agpole were long, too. 
Strong and long trends tend to precede extended side-
ways movement. Th is fl ag has the extended sideways 
movement, but the fl agpole height is unexciting.

T
his chapter begins discussing chart patterns not 
bounded by trendlines. How can you fi nd them if 
not looking for straight or diagonal trendlines? You 
fi nd them by looking for two potholes that bottom 
near the same price. 
If I were to ask my brother to fi nd a double bottom 
on a price chart, he might pick AB shown in Exhibit 
12.1. Price from peak C forms a hill fi lled with moguls 
that my brother would love skiing down. At the bottom 
of that hill, the double bottom at AB acts as a reversal.
Is there more to correctly identifying a double bot-
tom than fi nding two valleys? Yes.
Identiﬁ cation Guidelines
Th e following table shows the identifi cation guidelines. 
KEY POINT: 
A double bottom is a twin valley 
pattern with valleys that bottom 
near the same price. The double 
bottom acts as a bullish reversal 
of the downward price trend.

C H A P T E R
Characteristic
Discussion
Downward price trend
The short-term price trend leading to a double bottom is down. 
Two valleys
Look for two valleys that bottom near the same price. Near means within about 5 percent. 
The bottoms should look as if they are at the same price.
Valley separation
The time between bottoms varies, but two to seven weeks results in the best performance.
Peak
The peak between the two bottoms should measure at least 10 percent, but exceptions 
are numerous, making this guideline almost useless.
Volume
Volume is higher on the left bottom than the right, but this is an observation, not a requirement. 
Conﬁ rmation
Price must close above the highest peak between the two bottoms. If price closes below 
the lowest bottom before conﬁ rmation, it invalidates the double bottom.

116 ■CHAPTER 12 Double Bottoms
Th e time between bottoms is about two weeks, but 
after studying thousands of double bottoms, the sepa-
ration is not a concern. 
The peak between the two bottoms, E, is sup-
posed to be at least 10 percent above the lowest 
bottom. I do not even measure this nor do I care. 
What I am looking for is a reversal of the downward 
price trend. 
SMART INVESTOR TIP
The time between bottoms 
and the price variation is less 
important than conﬁ rmation. An 
unconﬁ rmed double bottom is 
just squiggles on a price chart.
Look at Exhibit 12.2 while we discuss identifi cation 
guidelines.
After trending down from the April peak, the 
stock bottoms at A, bounces up to E and down to 
B. Th e two valleys do not bottom at the same price, 
but they are just 17 cents apart (4 percent). On this 
scale, though, it looks as if an earthquake shifted the 
pavement.

The exhibit also shows additional double bot-
toms at GH, IJ, and KL. If you consider AB as one 
bottom (C), then CD is also a double bottom. In 
all cases, the horizontal red line starting from the 
peak between the two bottoms marks confirma-
tion. They point to where the stock closes above 
the peak.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Reversal chart patterns, such 
as double bottoms, must have 
something to reverse. If the price 
trend leading down to the double 
bottom is shallow, do not expect a 
large rise after conﬁ rmation.
Volume is often higher on the left bottom than the 
right, as in this case.
Confi rmation is the key to double bottoms. Price must 
confi rm the chart pattern. By that, I mean price must 
close above the highest peak (E) between the two bot-
toms (AB). If price closes below the lowest bottom fi rst, 
it is not a double bottom. AB is a valid double bottom.

tween the two bottoms.

for income, and decide that when double bottom CD 
confirms, you will buy.
Unfortunately, price hides by tunneling down to A,

Double Bottom Psychology
Why do double bottoms form? Look at Exhibit 12.3

The exhibit shows a stock that I love to own. 
Why? Because it pays a tasty dividend while it 
bounces between the 30s and 50s. I buy below 40

For example, look at the width of Eve at B. Th e two 
vertical red lines at D show how it widens out. Com-
pare that to the Adam bottom at E. Th e lines remain 
narrow.
I often use the width of the bottom in this manner 
to determine whether I am looking at an Eve or Adam 
bottom.
Another way to determine the type is to ask if the 
two bottoms look alike. If so, then you have Adam & 
Adam or Eve & Eve. Otherwise, it is a mix of the two: 
Eve & Adam or Adam & Eve. 
Why the emphasis on Adam and Eve? Because the 
various types perform diﬀ erently.
Exhibit 12.5 shows the last two variations.
An Adam & Eve double bottom appears in Febru-
ary and it has a narrow bottom (three days wide) fol-
lowed by a wide one. Th e chart pattern confi rms as a 
valid double bottom when price closes above the peak 
between the two valleys.
Th e other double bottom variation is probably one 
you have never heard of. I call it an ugly double bot-
tom. Price bottoms at A and then bounces to form 
a higher bottom, B (at least 5 percent higher, by the 
way). When price confi rms the chart pattern by clos-
ing above the peak between the two bottoms, it indi-
cates that the trend has changed from down to up.
Exercise
Find as many valid double bottoms as you can in 
Exhibit 12.6. Do not concern yourself with any of 
SMART INVESTOR TIP
To differentiate between Adam 
and Eve bottoms, ask if the 
two bottoms look the same or 
different. If they look the same, 
then they are either Adam & 
Adam or Eve & Eve. If they look 
different, then they are either 
Adam & Eve or Eve & Adam.
a shock, so you sit paralyzed and just watch it weekly, 
wondering if the slide is over. 
Eventually it bottoms at A, but you wait because 
you are not sure the decline has ended. When you look 
again, the stock has climbed too far to chase, despite 
the power of your hunting rifl e. 
At E, you vow that if the stock ever returns to the 
price level of A, you will bag it. Th e stock cooperates, 
reaching B. You shoot and score some shares!
Others do the same, putting a fl oor on the stock. 
Price rises, eventually confi rming the twin valley pat-
tern as a valid double bottom.
Who actually hunts like that? I do. I bought at 39.72 
on June 3 (B) and sold it at 54 a year later, pocketing a 
5.4 percent dividend along the way.
Variations
Double bottoms have several variations and Exhibit 
12.4 shows three of them.
Pattern A is called an Eve & Eve double bottom. B 
is an Eve & Adam, and C is an Adam & Adam double 
bottom.
The difference between Adam and Eve is the 
shape of the bottom. Adam bottoms are thin, nar-
row price spikes, often composed of a single day 
or two. Eve is wider and more rounded looking. If 
Eve has price spikes, they are more numerous and 
stubby.
Eve bottoms tend to be wide and widen out as price 
climbs. Adam bottoms tend to remain narrow.
DEFINITION:
Eve & Adam
Adam bottoms are narrow, often 
single-day price spikes. Eve is 
wider, more rounded looking. If 
Eve has price spikes, they are 
shorter and more numerous. Adam 
tends to remain narrow vertically 
whereas Eve broadens out.

120 ■CHAPTER 12  Double Bottoms
Exhibit 12.7 shows what I found. First, in the lower 
right of the chart is the only valid double bottom, AB. 
Price confirms it when the stock closes above the top 
of the pattern, at C.
If you marked DE, that would be wrong because it 
does not confirm. 
Bottom FG confirms, but it is not a bottom. Price 
must trend downward into the chart pattern, not rise up 
the identification guideline numbers, such as two 
to seven weeks between bottoms, or 5 percent 
apart, and so on. Just look for two valleys that bot-
tom at or near the same price and confirm as valid 
patterns. Do not look for ugly double bottoms, and 
do not worry about the Adam and Eve variations. 
Also pretend that the long green downward spike in 
May does not exist.

Exhibit 12.8 has multiple double bottoms in it. Find 
as many as you can, but do not look for those narrow-
er than about two weeks and forget about ugly double 
bottoms, too. 
Exhibit 12.9 shows the answers. I drew a line 
connecting the bottoms for your viewing pleasure.  
Bottom A confirms as a valid pattern in a downward 
price trend. If you excluded it because the two valleys 
from the grave. The rule I use is that in-bound price must 
be higher than the peak in the middle of the double bot-
tom to guarantee that it is indeed trending down into the 
chart pattern. That does not occur on the FG bottom. 
Confused? I explain it again in the next chapter.
All of the other potential double bottoms on the 
chart have one or both of those flaws. They do not con-
firm or are located in an uptrend.

Answer true or false to the following statements.
1. A double bottom is just squiggles on a price chart 
until it confi rms.
2. Confi rmation of a double bottom is when price 
rises at least 10 percent above the lowest bottom.
3. Price must trend down into a double bottom.
4. Th e peak between the two bottoms should rise at 
least 10 percent above the lowest bottom, but if it 
does not, who cares?
5. If price closes below the lowest bottom before con-
fi rming the double bottom, it invalidates the chart 
pattern.

N
ow that we have trained ourselves to fi nd two 
bottoms that line up at the same price, let us 
look for triplets: three bottoms in a row. It is as easy 
as it sounds, except that triple bottoms are sometimes 
confused with head-and-shoulders bottoms. Maybe it 
is not so easy . . .
Triple bottoms are considerably rarer than double 
bottoms, but the technique used to fi nd them is the 
same. Find a double bottom and then look to the 
left and right to see if a third bottom exists at the 
same price. 
Exhibit 13.1 shows an example.
Based on what you have learned in this book, which 
of the three patterns are triple bottoms (guess)?
Look at bottom ABC. Price trends downward into 
the chart pattern. If you do not see a downward price 
trend, then it is not a bottom reversal. Th e pattern has 
three price spikes, with A slightly above the other two. 
Price confi rms the pattern by closing above the high-
est peak between the three bottoms. 
It is a triple bottom.
DEF is similar to ABC in that two of three bottoms 
are near the same price. However, F is much higher 
than DE so this would work better as double bottom 
DE with throwback F.
HIJ has a center valley (I) below the other two. Th at 
is a dead giveaway. It is a head-and-shoulders bottom, 
a chart pattern I will be discussing later in the book 
(see Chapter 16).
Identiﬁ cation Guidelines
What is involved in identifying triple bottoms? You 
can probably guess most of them, but the following 
table provides a list.
KEY POINT: 
Triple bottoms are three valleys 
that bottom near the same price. 
The chart pattern acts as a bullish 
reversal of the downward price 
trend. 
KEY POINT: 
Price must trend downward into 
a bottom and upward into a top. 
That trend is what qualiﬁ es the 
chart pattern as a bottom or top, 
respectively. Without the trend, 
then you do not have a reversal 
pattern.

Three bottoms
Three minor lows are involved in a triple bottom. Sometimes they can be one-day price spikes or 
wider, more rounded turns. Each valley tends to look similar to the others.
Same price
Each minor low should bottom near the same price. Rarely will all three bottom at exactly the 
same price, so be ﬂ exible.
Volume
Volume recedes, meaning it is higher on the left than the right, but each bottom can show 
signiﬁ cant volume. Do not exclude a pattern because it has an unusual volume shape.
Conﬁ rmation
Price must conﬁ rm the triple bottom by closing above the highest peak between the three bottoms.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
If the middle peak of an alleged 
triple bottom is signiﬁ cantly below 
the other two, then it is probably a 
head-and-shoulders bottom.

Visual Guide to Chart Patterns ■129
Th e pattern confi rms as a valid triple bottom when 
price closes above the highest peak (E) between the 
three bottoms. Confi rmation happens at F.
Exhibit 13.3 occurs on the weekly scale.
I chose this chart because of its similarity to the 
prior exhibit. Price climbs to D and then tumbles to 
the triple bottom reversal at ABC. 
Th is time, though, the valleys are wider and more 
rounded looking. If you were to ﬂ ip to the daily scale, 
KEY POINT: 
Price must close above the 
highest peak between the three 
bottoms. If it closes below the 
lowest bottom ﬁ rst, then it is not 
a triple bottom.
Exhibit 13.2 shows an example of a triple bottom.
Price climbs a cliﬀ  to D and then turns into a water-
fall, tumbling to the stream below and forming triple 
bottom ABC. Th e D peak is too far away to be an ex-
ample of overshoot.
Th ree valleys appear similar in shape, all of 
them narrow and bottoming near the same price. 
Volume trends upward, which is odd for triple 
bottoms.

Valleys H, I, and J form three bottoms—and you can 
throw in K for another triple (IJK)—but the valleys do not 
bottom at or near the same price. Th ey are better clas-
sifi ed as a symmetrical triangle, shown outlined in blue. 
Triple L, M, and N form three bottoms near the 
same price, but it is not a reversal. Price climbs into 
the start of the chart pattern from the bottom, not 
trends lower as required. However, some may call this 
you would see them expand as if they overdosed on 
potato chips.
Price confi rms the triple bottom at F when it closes 
above peak E. Price must close above the highest peak 
in the pattern, or else it is not a triple bottom.
Look at G, the three brief spikes down in early 2006. 
Th is is also a triple bottom, but due to the weekly 
scale, it is harder to spot.
FAST FACTS
Longer triple bottoms are often 
easier to identify on the weekly 
chart. In a study of 602 triple 
bottoms, the average length was 
between two and three months 
long.

132 ■CHAPTER 13 Triple Bottoms
B shows three spikes near the same price level. 
Everything looks good except for one thing. Price 
closes below the bottom of the pattern fi rst, so it is not 
a triple bottom.
Pattern C looks like a head-and-shoulders bottom 
because the middle red dot is much lower than the 
other two. When pattern A showed a higher middle, 
that was fi ne, but a lower middle often qualifi es the 
chart pattern as a head-and-shoulders. C is not a tri-
ple bottom.
D is also not a triple bottom reversal because price 
rises into the chart pattern (starting at C) instead of 
trending downward. Th e rule I use is that the price 
mountain to the left of the chart pattern must be 
above the highest peak in the triple bottom.
I show what I mean using the two variations in the 
blue inset. Th e blue lines represent price. G has price 
trending downward (H) into the triple bottom from 
above the red line. Th e triple bottom acts as a reversal 
of the downward trend.
I has price rising (from J) into the three bottoms. 
Th e inbound price trend remains below the middle 
peak. Th is triple bottom acts as a continuation pat-
tern, not a reversal. Pattern D resembles scenario I, so 
it is not a triple bottom reversal.
E is a triple bottom even though the right valley is 
lower than the other two. When looking at this on a 
historical basis, which we are, the triple bottom is a 
reversal with price rising above the three valleys on ei-
ther side. It looks like a reversal. It acts like a reversal. 
It even quacks like a reversal. 
FAST FACTS
Tall triple bottoms tend to outper-
form short ones (gains averaging 
39 percent versus 27 percent, re-
spectively), according to a study 
of bull market patterns from mid-
1991 to 2011 using 609 samples.
Th e stock bounced at A and climbed to nearly 43 from 
mid 40 then retreated and formed valley B.
Value investors returned to the market and 
scooped up the stock. Seeing the fi rst valley bottom 
near 40, technical players recognized the support area 
and bought, too. Th at buying demand pushed the 
stock back up to 43, but selling pressure cut it down a 
third time, to C.
Institutional investors bought the stock or added to 
their positions. It is as if they whispered “Buy BAX, but 
do it quietly.” Volume trended lower over the course of 
the three bottoms, higher at bottom A than C.
At C, buying enthusiasm ignited a missile that 
shot upward and confi rmed the triple bottom at D, 
but within a week was parachuting back down in a 
throwback.
Months later, market enthusiasts could look back 
and see the triple bottom for what it was: a reversal 
that marked a signifi cant bottom for the stock.
Variations
Variations in triple bottoms center around the price 
level of the three valleys. Look at Exhibit 13.5, starting 
with A on the far left.
Th is triple bottom has a middle valley (red dot) that 
is well above the other two. Th e triple bottom appears 
in a downward price trend and acts as a reversal. Price 
confi rms the chart pattern as a valid one when it clos-
es above the peak between the three valleys. I consider 
it a valid triple bottom.

patterns on the chart that I want to highlight. Two are 
triple bottoms and two are head-and-shoulders bot-
toms. See if you can find all of them even though we 
have not yet covered the head-and-shoulders.
Exhibit 13.7 shows the answers. 
A and B are the triple bottoms. They exist in a 
downward price trend, form three bottoms near the 
same price, and confirm when price closes above 
Pattern F also has a lower middle valley but if this 
were a person, he would have the nickname “No neck.”  
It is a valid triple bottom and not a head-and-shoulders  
bottom.

Exhibit 13.9 shows the answers. Triple bottom A 
has a right bottom below the other two, but it still acts 
as a reversal of the downward price run. Price on the 
right valley does not sink too far below (just 20 cents) 
the other two to invalidate the triple bottom.
You might quibble with pattern B, and this is 
certainly a hard triple bottom to find. Cover up the ad-
ditional valleys after the right one and it looks like a 
the highest peak between the three valleys in each  
pattern.
The two head-and-shoulders bottoms would be dif-
ficult to confuse as triple bottoms since the heads are 
much lower than the surrounding valleys.
This next exercise (see Exhibit 13.8) is trickier than 
the last one. Look for three triple bottoms and one 
head-and-shoulders bottom.

ouble tops are dual price mountains that peak 
near the same price. Th ey are the same as double 
bottoms except fl ipped upside down. In this chapter, 
we will discuss what to look for when searching for 
double tops.
Exhibit 14.1 shows two examples of double tops on 
the daily scale. At F, price begins the steep march up the 
sides of the double top. It peaks at A, withdraws to G, 
and then forms another peak, B, at a price similar to A. 
When price closes below G, it confi rms the twin 
peaks as a valid double top.
I chose this chart because the long climb up re-
minds me of a trek up K2. Th e double top acts like 
storm clouds, warning of the coming decline.
Look at CDE. Th is is a triple top, but is CD also a 
double top? Yes. CD confi rms as a double top before 
peak E forms. When E appears, the double top also 
becomes a triple top, but only when the trio confi rms. 
What do I mean by confi rmation, and what should 
you look for in double tops? Th at question brings us to 
identifi cation.
Identiﬁ cation Guidelines
Th e following table lists the criteria that double tops 
share.
KEY POINT: 
Double tops are bearish reversals 
of an uptrend formed by twin 
peaks near the same price.

Upward price 
trend
The short-term price trend leading 
to the double top is up. 
Two peaks
Look for two peaks that top out 
near the same price. Near means 
within about 3 percent. The tops 
should look as if they are at the 
same price.

separation
The time between peaks varies, but two to six weeks is typical.
Valley
The valley drop between the two peaks should measure at least 10 percent, but allow exceptions. 
The drop should look proportional to the width of the double top.
Volume
Volume is usually higher on the left top than the right, but this is an observation, not a requirement. 
Conﬁ rmation
Price must close below the lowest valley between the two peaks. If price closes above the 
highest peak before conﬁ rmation, it invalidates the double top.

Visual Guide to Chart Patterns ■141
Consider the double top shown in Exhibit 14.2.
Price begins the upward trend at F, leading to 
the double top. Twin peaks appear as an Adam & Eve 
double top at the cleverly chosen letters A and E. Th e 
double top begins to reverse the FA climb.
Th e time between the two peaks is usually less than 
two months, frequently ranging between two and six 
SMART INVESTOR TIP
A reversal chart pattern must have 
something to reverse. If the rise 
leading to a double top is small, 
then do not expect a big drop. The 
stock might try digging to the 
earth’s core, but do not count on it.
weeks. Th ey can be further apart, especially when us-
ing the weekly or monthly scales, or narrower for day 
traders.
Th e valley between the two peaks sees price drop, 
but the depth should be proportional to the width of 
the peaks. Peaks separated by two weeks probably 
will not see a massive plunge between the two tops.

Usually the drop measures in the 10 to 20 percent 
range, but allow exceptions, especially when using 
other time scales (like intraday).
Volume tends to be higher on formation of the left 
peak than the right, which this example shows.
Th e twin peaks become a valid double top when 
price closes below the valley between the two peaks. 
Th e valley bottom is at B and it confi rms at C when 
the red candle closes below the price of B. A pullback 
to the breakout price at D gives traders another op-
portunity to exit before the decline resumes.
Double Top Psychology
Why do double tops form? Th e answer is the same as 
it is for other chart patterns: fear and greed, some-
times powered by fundamentals. 
Exhibit 14.3 shows an example of a double top 
standing like a castle overlooking a sea of prices.
At C, the company released fi rst quarter earnings 
and announced the completion of a merger with Am-
rep Inc., a chemical supplier. Th e stock went nowhere 
that day. 
Two days later, the institutions fi nished digesting 
the news and decided the stock represented a good 
value. Th eir buying pushed the stock up the price 
mountain to A where traders encountered a group of 
angry bears. Th e bears pushed them oﬀ  the cliﬀ , forc-
ing the stock back down.
Since the bears remained at the top of the cliﬀ , the 
bulls bought the stock at the bottom and their buying

demand made it climb back up a new slope to B, form-
ing a second peak. 
A day later, a brokerage fi rm downgraded the stock.
Th e bulls and bears fought again, tearing into each 
other, but not making or losing much ground. Even so, 
the smart money started selling ahead of the second 
quarter’s earnings announcement.
At E, the company reported earnings and had a 
conference call to discuss them the next day. Th e news 
herded some of the bulls into the slaughterhouse and 
bears pushed the rest over the edge. Th e stock did a 
cliﬀ  diver plunge back to the sea at D.
Variations
I show variations of the basic double top, beginning 
with Exhibit 14.4.
I have already discussed Adam and Eve double bot-
toms, and the top variety is similar to the bottoms. 
Adam peaks are narrow, often one-day price spikes. 
Eve peaks look more rounded. If she has price spikes, 
they are numerous and short.
Th e exhibit shows an Adam & Adam double top 
at AA. Following that, an Eve & Adam top appears. 
Notice how wide Eve appears compared to Adam. An-
other Eve & Adam double top appears about a year 
later.
Exhibit 14.5 shows the two missing varieties of 
Adam and Eve.
An Adam & Eve double top appears in February, 
and you may be scratching your head because the two 
FAST FACTS
Double tops show their best 
performance in bear markets, 
not bull. Adam & Adam performs 
best in a bull market, but worst 
in a bear market.
FAST FACTS
Of the four combinations of 
Adam and Eve double tops in a 
bull market, Adam & Adam show 
the largest average decline after 
conﬁ rmation.

Visual Guide to Chart Patterns ■143
peaks look similar. Th at is the problem with labeling 
the various peaks. Recall that Adam tends to remain 
narrow whereas Eve widens out, which appears to be 
the case here. 
Th e Eve & Eve tops look more rounded, especially 
when you consider the entire top on the left (blue arc) 
as part of the turn.
FAST FACTS
The failure rate can almost dou-
ble from one type of double top to 
another, depending on the Adam 
and Eve combinations compared.
Exercise
Th e Adam and Eve combinations of double tops 
can confuse even the experts, so I am not going to 
test you on them. Look at Exhibit 14.6 to fi nd three 
double tops, four fl ags, and a symmetrical triangle. 
Here is a hint for the fl ags. Look for the fl agpole fi rst

tached to it.
Exhibit 14.7 shows the locations of the chart pat-
terns. A is an Eve & Eve double top. B is an Adam & 
Eve and C is an Eve & Adam. These should have been 
easy to locate, and I hope you found the flags and tri-
angle as well.
This next exercise is more difficult because 
I chose a chart in which you may select some  
bogus patterns. Look for three valid double tops. (See  
Exhibit 14.8.)
Exhibit 14.9 shows the answers. Twin peak A is not 
a double top because it does not confirm (price does 
not close below line B).
C, D, and E are the correct choices for double tops. F, 
however, is an unconfirmed double top (at least so far).
The next chapter extends the twin peak pattern to 
three to create a triple top.

A 
double top can become a triple after growing 
another peak near the same price. Let us take a 
closer look at this medical miracle to see how traders 
recognize it.
Exhibit 15.1 shows two examples of real triple tops 
and one implant.
Th e triple top at A has three peaks near the same 
price after the stock trends upward into the chart pat-
tern. Th e stock becomes a base jumper and confi rms 
the chart pattern on the way down through the hori-
zontal red line.
Th e middle triple top, at B, is also a triple top with 
the same features as A. Th e skydiver pops his chute, 
and the drop ends soon after.
C is not a triple top because it does not con-
fi rm. You can guess what that means, but the next 
section makes the various components of a triple top 
clear.
Identiﬁ cation Guidelines
Th e following table lists guidelines for fi nding triple 
tops.
KEY POINT:
A triple top is a three-peak pattern 
with the three minor highs 
topping out near the same price. 
The pattern acts as a reversal of 
the upward price trend.

Discussion
Upward price 
trend
The short-term price trend leading 
to the triple top is up.
Three peaks
Look for three minor highs. 
Sometimes the peaks can be one-
day price spikes or wider, more 
rounded turns. Each peak tends to 
look similar to the others, but allow 
variations.
Same price
Each minor high should peak near 
the same price. Rarely will all three 
top out at exactly the same price, 
so be ﬂ exible. In fact, the middle 
peak is sometimes lower than the 
other two.

152 ■CHAPTER 15 Triple Tops
Exhibit 15.2 shows another example of a triple top.
I chose this one because the middle peak is depressed 
and needed cheering up. Do not trash a valid triple top be-
cause the middle peak is slightly lower than its neighbors.
Price trends upward from below the chart pattern 
at E. Peaks A and C have more rounded looking turns 
than does needle B, but that is fi ne. 
To confi rm a triple top, price has to close below the 
lowest valley in the chart pattern. Th at happens at D. 
Characteristic
Discussion
Volume
Volume recedes, meaning it is higher 
on the left than the right, but each 
peak can show signiﬁ cant volume. 
Do not exclude a pattern because it 
has an unusual volume shape.
Conﬁ rmation
Price must conﬁ rm the triple top 
by closing below the lowest valley 
between the three peaks.

Imagine that you run a hedge fund that bought the 
stock at 18 in 2009 just after the bear market ended 
(not shown). At A, the stock reached 38 and change, 
more than double what you paid. Based on your anal-
ysis, it is time to sell.
However, since you own a large position, you can-
not just dump your shares on the market all at once. 
Th at would force the stock down into the Hudson 
faster than an airliner striking a fl ock of birds.
FAST FACTS
The average length of a triple top 
on the daily chart is about three 
months in a bull market.
Volume trends downward as the blue line shows. 
Receding volume is typical of triple tops, but do not dis-
card a potential triple top because of unusual volume.
Triple Top Psychology
Exhibit 15.3 shows selling near a fi xed price that halts 
the upward movement in the stock, forming triple top 
ABC. It might play out something like this.
FAST FACTS
When the middle peak has higher 
volume than the last peak in the 
triple top, performance tends to 
be better.

top, you should be able to identify the other 
patterns. 
When searching for a triple top, imagine the out-
line of a mountain range. Th ree of the mountains line 
up at the same height to form a triple top. 
Exhibit 15.6 shows the answers. 
Th e head-and-shoulders top has a head sticking 
above the other two peaks, helping to diﬀ erentiate it 
from a triple top.
Th e triple top at ABC forms three peaks near the 
same price. It confi rms when price closes below the 
lowest valley in the chart pattern.
Th e double top may have given you some trouble 
because the two peaks are not at the same price 
(45 cents diﬀ erence, or less than 1 percent). 
Peak D is not a triple top. I shy away from peaks that 
align like this one does, forming a diagonal trend down-
ward. Often that is a clue to a symmetrical triangle. 
Exhibit 15.7 shows a target-rich environment. In it 
you should fi nd at least two triple tops, two fl ags, a pen-
nant, a double bottom, and a head-and-shoulders top.
Exhibit 15.8 shows where the chart patterns are lo-
cated. Starting on the left, a small head-and-shoulders 
top appears in April. Since the price diﬀ erence be-
tween the fi rst two peaks is just 15 cents, if you want 
to call this a triple top, fi ne.
Next is the large pattern ABC. Although these three 
peaks line up near the same price, the chart pattern 
does not confi rm, so it is not a triple top.
Th e fl ag in July is diffi  cult to spot because it acts as 
a reversal of the uptrend.
a submarine during a crash dive. Momentum grows, 
keeping the stock trending down.
Th e stock reaches a long-term trendline (shown 
in blue) and bobbles up and down along that line for 
months. When the stock recovers to D, you sell more 
shares and fi nish dumping them when the stock 
powers higher at E.
Now that you have sold your position, the stock 
doubles, which really pisses you oﬀ . 
Variations
Only one variation needs to concern you: a head-
and-shoulders top. In the next two chapters, we dis-
cuss head-and-shoulders patterns but until then, just 
avoid picking triple tops in which the center peak 
rises too far above the other two. It should not look 
like a person’s bust.
For example, consider Exhibit 15.4. 
Th e head-and-shoulders has a head above the 
shoulders (LS and RS) far enough to make it look like 
a person’s bust.
Compare that to the triple top ABC. B is slightly 
above A and C, but hardly enough to notice. It looks
like a triple top and not a head-and-shoulders top.
Exercise
The first exercise is easy (see Exhibit 15.5). Find at 
least one triple top, a head-and-shoulders top (guess), 
and a double top. Except for the head-and-shoulders 
FAST FACTS
Triple tops have the same perfor-
mance and failure rate as the best 
performing double top—Adam & 
Adam.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Select three peak patterns in 
which the middle peak is not 
too far above the other two. 
If the pattern resembles a 
human bust, then the pattern is 
better described as a head-and-
shoulders top.

156 ■CHAPTER 15  Triple Tops
In the next chapter, I discuss head-and-shoulders 
bottoms. Just two days ago, I received an e-mail 
asking why I have not discussed the inverted 
head-and-shoulders pattern. I do not call them by that 
name. It has something to do with the federal eyewit-
ness protection program.
The December flag and February pennant follow 
price higher surrounding the holidays.
D is the first triple top. The upward spike that oc-
curs after the third peak also occurs after confirma-
tion. The chart pattern reversal leads to a huge drop 
that sees a double bottom form as another reversal.
Following that is the second triple top, at E.

quad or multiple top pattern.
C. If the four-peak pattern confi rms, it suggests 
price is going down.
D. Overhead resistance is strong.
E. All of the above.
2. True or false: If price trends lower into a three-peak 
pattern, you have a triple top.
3. How close do the peaks have to be from each other 
to qualify as a triple top?

chart pattern. It has an evocative name, but rec-
ognizing a valid one takes an understanding of the 
rules. Let us begin by looking at a few samples. (See 
Exhibit 16.1.)
In this exhibit, I show three head-and-shoulders 
patterns. Pattern A is a head-and-shoulders bottom. 
Th e right shoulder (RS) bottoms at a price above 
the left (LS), but not too far. If this were the bust of 
a real person, yes, they might be in need of medical 
attention. 
Notice that the head is below the adjacent shoul-
ders. Th at is a key feature of a head-and-shoulders 
bottom.
Pattern B is similar to A. Th e two shoulders bot-
tom close to the same price and they are almost sym-
metrical about the head in terms of time. Symmetry is 
important to head-and-shoulders patterns.
C is a good example of a head-and-shoulders top. 
Th at chart pattern is the subject of the next chapter.
Besides a miracle, what does it take to fi nd a valid 
head-and-shoulders bottom? 
Identiﬁ cation Guidelines
Th e following table lists the identifi cation guidelines.
KEY POINT: 
A head-and-shoulders bottom 
is a three-valley chart pattern 
that resembles a person’s bust, 
inverted. The head is below the 
adjacent shoulders, and it acts as 
a reversal of the downward price 
trend.

trend
Look for a short-term price 
trend leading down to the head-
and-shoulders bottom. 
Three valleys
The head-and-shoulders is a 
three valley pattern with the 
middle valley bottoming below 
the other two. The three valleys 
and two armpits (peaks between 
the valleys) should be well-
deﬁ ned minor highs and lows.

164 ■CHAPTER 16 Head-and-Shoulders Bottoms
Exhibit 16.2 shows one valid head-and-shoulders bot-
tom and a wannabe. Let us determine the diﬀ erences.
Pattern AB is a valid head-and-shoulders bot-
tom. From the peak in February, price tumbles down 
a waterfall into the chart pattern and forms the left 
shoulder as a minor low. Following that, a lower valley

appears as the head. After recovering from the head, 
price makes a higher low that becomes the right 
shoulder.
Points A and B are the armpits. Connecting those is 
the neckline, shown in red.
Th e two shoulders are almost the same distance 
from the head, but hardly bottom at the same price. 
It is hard to tell which of the three valleys have higher 
volume.
In other words, the guidelines are just that, guide-
lines, not fi rm rules. Be ﬂ exible when prospecting for 
head-and-shoulders bottoms since wide variations 
are common.
Pattern DEF would seem to be a better example 
of a head-and-shoulders bottom. Th e two shoulders 
are more symmetrical looking both in price level and 
head distance. Th e pattern confi rms when price clos-
es above the neckline. 
What is the ﬂ aw? Answer: Th e left shoulder is not 
a valid minor low. Recall that a minor low should be 
the lowest price from fi ve days before to fi ve days after. 
Th e left shoulder appears to be just a small blip in a 
rising price trend and not a minor low.
Head-and-Shoulders Bottom 
Psychology
Why do head-and-shoulders bottoms form? Th e chart 
pattern represents the struggle to fi nd the lowest price 
at the best value. (See Exhibit 16.3.)
FAST FACTS
On average, when volume is 
highest on formation of the right 
shoulder, performance is worse 
than when volume is higher on 
the left shoulder or head.
Characteristic
Discussion
Symmetry
The entire pattern has a 
symmetrical feel to it. The left 
and right shoulders should 
have similar distances to the 
head; both should bottom at 
or near the same price, and be 
positioned on either side of the 
head.
Volume
Weakest on the right shoulder 
and often highest on the left 
shoulder, but head volume can 
be high, too. Do not exclude 
a head-and-shoulders bottom 
because of an unusual volume 
pattern.
Neckline, 
conﬁ rmation
The neckline is a line drawn 
across the two armpits. A 
close above this line conﬁ rms 
the head-and-shoulders as a 
valid chart pattern. For up-
sloping necklines, use a close 
above the right armpit as the 
conﬁ rmation price.

Visual Guide to Chart Patterns ■165
For example, the chart shows volume spiking 
even as the stock descends, going into the left shoul-
der. Th at higher turnover is a sign of a bottom, but 
one the stock has seen plenty of times as it rolled 
down the hill from the January high. What is diﬀ er-
ent this time?
FAST FACTS
Head-and-shoulders bottoms in 
bull markets with down-sloping 
necklines tend to perform signiﬁ -
cantly better than do those with 
up-sloping necklines.
Buying demand puts a crimp on the downward 
slide and price moves up, but only for about a week. 
Th en, the downtrend resumes, going into the head. 
Volume on formation of the head is less than on the 
left shoulder, but that confi guration is typical for 
head-and-shoulders bottoms.

Th e smart money is accumulating the stock in an-
ticipation of a change in the fundamentals and a ris-
ing price. Th e stock fi nds support and bottoms at the 
head low. Th en the stock begins recovering, taking 
volume with it, signaling the change from bear to bull. 
Price rounds over at the right armpit and drops to 
form the right shoulder. Volume is subdued here as if 
the smart money knows a good value when they see it, 
but are keeping it quiet. Th eir buying sends the stock 
moving higher again, above the neckline, confi rming 
the turn from bear to bull. 
Now fi rmly entrenched in their positions, the smart 
money can sip margaritas while others do the hard 
work of pushing the stock higher.

Variations
I show Exhibit 16.4 because of the right head-and-
shoulders bottom (the one with measles). What is so 
special about this one compared to the others? It has 
multiple shoulders. 
The right shoulder has two small valleys and the 
left has three. I show four of them as red dots. Strictly 
speaking, only two of these five are minor lows be-
cause of the five-day count on either side of the low to 
qualify it as a minor low. 
This variation is called a complex head-and-shoulders 
bottom. Those are chart patterns with multiple shoul-
ders, multiple heads, or both (rarely). As you scan 
for head-and-shoulders bottoms, look to the left and

right and check for additional shoulders or another 
head. Treat the more complex pattern as a simple 
head-and-shoulders bottom.
As for the other two head-and-shoulders bottoms, 
notice the higher left shoulder bottom in each case. 
Irregularities such as these will cause doubt until you 
become accustomed to identifying ﬂ awed patterns.
Exhibit 16.5 shows a chart pattern that you may 
think is a head-and-shoulders bottom, and you would 
be wrong. Th is one has two twists. What are they?
First, price does not trend downward into the chart 
pattern as the blue channel lines show. Price rises in-
stead. Th is head-and-shoulders acts as a continuation 
of the upward price trend and not a reversal.

One might argue that point, saying that price drops 
from the peak in July 2009 and bottoms a year later 
with the middle section being a retrace of that down-
trend. Fine. 
Th e second “ﬂ aw” is that it never confi rms as a 
valid head-and-shoulders bottom. Th at means price 
did not close above the neckline (A) or right arm-
pit high (B) before closing below the bottom of the 
pattern. Th e armpit measure is the correct one to use 
when the neckline slopes upward, as in this case.
Exercise
Th e fi rst exercise shows three head-and-shoulders 
bottoms, but one you may disagree with. See if you 
can fi nd all three. (See Exhibit 16.6.)
SMART INVESTOR TIP
If the neckline slopes upward 
from a head-and-shoulders 
bottom, use a close above the right 
armpit as conﬁ rmation instead of 
a close above the neckline.

Exhibit 16.7 shows the answers. The questionable 
head-and-shoulders bottom is at A. Why? Because 
price trends upward into the chart pattern. It does not 
act as a “bottom” reversal but as a continuation pattern. 
The other two chart patterns are valid head-
and-shoulders bottoms. They reverse the short-term 
downtrend.
Note the horizontal red confirmation line in pat-
terns A and B where the neckline slopes upward.
The next exercise is easier, but just as tricky. There 
is at least one head-and-shoulders bottom in Exhibit 
16.8. See how many you can find.
Exhibit 16.9 shows the answers. Pattern A is not a 
head-and-shoulders bottom. Why? Because it is not

potting tops is easier for me. Perhaps it is the idea 
that preservation of capital is more important 
than profi t. Whatever the reason, let us look at the last 
chart pattern in this section of the book.
Th e head-and-shoulders top appears on the chart 
just as it sounds and Exhibit 17.1 shows examples. In 
both chart patterns, a head towers above the shoul-
ders, making it look like a person’s bust.
Price trends upward into the head-and-shoulders 
reversal. Th en a left shoulder forms (LS), followed by a 
head and right shoulder. When price closes below the 
neckline, it confi rms the chart pattern as valid. Price 
drops like a falling climber whose pitons have released.
Identiﬁ cation Guidelines
Th e following table lists guidelines for identifying 
head-and-shoulders tops. 
KEY POINT: 
A head-and-shoulders top is a 
three-peak reversal pattern with 
a centrally located head priced 
above two adjacent (shoulder) 
peaks. The pattern conﬁ rms as 
a valid chart pattern when price 
closes below the neckline or right 
armpit.

Characteristic
Discussion
Upward price 
trend
Look for an upward price 
trend leading to a head-and-
shoulders top.
Three peaks
The head-and-shoulders top is 
a three-peak pattern with the 
middle peak above the other 
two. The three peaks and two 
armpits (valleys between the 
peaks) should be well-deﬁ ned 
minor highs and lows.
Symmetry
The entire pattern has a 
symmetrical feel to it. The left 
and right shoulders should have 
similar distances from the head; 
both shoulders should top out 
near the same price, and be 
positioned on either side 
of the head.

176 ■CHAPTER 17 Head-and-Shoulders Tops
Exhibit 17.2 shows a head-and-shoulders top on 
the weekly scale. It appears as a three-bump pat-
tern sitting atop a hill as if it were playing King of the 
Mountain.
Notice that the chart pattern on the weekly scale 
appears similar to ones on the daily chart or any other 
scale.
Two shoulders appear at similar distances from 
the head, but not quite at the same price, with a head 
that towers above the shoulders.
Th is head-and-shoulders top has a down-sloping 
neckline in red (A). Th e blue line (B) shows how much 
sooner price validates the pattern when using a close 
below the right armpit instead of the neckline.
Volume is higher on the left shoulder than the right.
FAST FACTS
The head-and-shoulders top, in a 
bull market after a breakout, has 
the best average decline of 21 
chart patterns tested.
Head-and-Shoulders Top 
Psychology
Why do head-and-shoulders tops form? Pretend that 
you represent the smart money—high wealth indi-
viduals, fi nancial institutions, hedge or mutual funds. 
You are searching for a stock to buy and believe that 
Hovnanian, shown in Exhibit 17.3, represents an in-
triguing situation.
You start buying at A, and that buying pressure 
sends the stock exploding out of a loose consolidation 
region that ended in March.
Others join in and buy the stock, sending the price 
into orbit like a shuttle launching.
As stars appear out the shuttle’s window and the 
stock rises above 7, you have made 40 percent in about 
two weeks. Time to sell. 
Your selling causes the stock to halt its upward 
move and begin a retrace, forming the left shoulder.
Sensing weakness, you stop selling but monitor the 
situation. Buy-the-dip players, believing that this is a 
chance to get in on a mission to deep space, buy the 
stock on the retrace. Th e decline halts, and the stock 
begins rising again.
As the stock moves up, momentum players join the 
trend. Once the stock rises above 8, you resume sell-
ing, not heavily at fi rst because you have a large num-
ber of shares to dump. Still, the market players notice 
your selling and the stock heads back down.
You dump your remaining shares as the stock be-
gins tumbling. Volume rises as other players sell their

Volume
Weakest on the right shoulder 
and often highest on the left 
shoulder, but head volume can

Neckline, 
conﬁ rmation
The neckline is a line drawn 
across the two armpits. A 
close below this line conﬁ rms 
the head-and-shoulders as a 
valid chart pattern. For down-
sloping necklines, use a close

shares to unsuspecting buyers. Th e stock continues 
moving down and slides back below 6. Believing the 
stock oversold, demand picks up and sends the price 
moving up again for the last time.
You watch from the sidelines. Th e stock climbs to 
form the right shoulder. Lacking support for a contin-
ued rise, the stock turns down. 
FAST FACTS
When the left shoulder peak is 
above the right one, the average 
head-and-shoulders top tends to 
outperform.
Investors versed in technical analysis see the 
head-and-shoulders top for what it is: a reversal. Th ey 
quietly take profi ts. Others initiate short sales by sell-
ing high and hoping price hits zero.
Th e stock moves lower and forms a pen-
nant before breaking out downward, leading to a

Pattern C has a spike for its head with unevenly 
priced shoulders, but they are close to symmetrical 
about the head. The pattern also confirms when price 
closes below the up-sloping neckline.
Pattern D is the only invalid head-and-shoulders top. 
The left shoulder is much wider than the right one, and 
the two shoulders are not symmetrical about the head. 
Notice that the stock closes above the top of the 
head (E) before price closes below the red confirma-
tion line, invalidating the chart pattern.

180 ■CHAPTER 17 Head-and-Shoulders Tops
When searching for head-and-shoulders tops, I 
have found it benefi cial to ask if the pattern looks
like a person’s bust. If the neck is unusually long or if 
the two shoulders are crooked, then look for another 
head-and-shoulders top.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
If a head-and-shoulders top does 
not resemble a human bust, then 
it is not a head-and-shoulders top.
Exercise
In this exercise, fi nd as many head-and-shoulders 
tops as you can. Also, look for double and triple tops 
and bottoms, ascending and descending triangles.

Th e answers appear in Exhibit 17.6. I show the pat-
terns spread out like peanut butter across bread, but 
there are other patterns that may qualify (like addi-
tional double bottoms or double tops).
Head-and-shoulders tops A, B, and C are all valid. Pat-
tern D confi rms as a head-and-shoulders top, but the 
trend is downward leading to the chart pattern. It is not 
a reversal, but a continuation head-and-shoulders top. 
Notice that since the head-and-shoulders pattern 
appeared at the end of the trend, the downward break-
out did not amount to much. Th at is a trading tip you 
might want to remember.

Chart patterns that form well into

metrical triangle.
After that, we switched to peaks and valleys to 
fi nd double and triple tops and bottoms. Completing 
the group were the head-and-shoulders, a complex 
pattern that is not much diﬀ erent from a triple top or 
bottom.
Now that we know what to look for, we can use 
the patterns as buy signals. Th e next section descri-
bes how.

Answers:  1. D; 2. False; 3.True; 4.True
2. True or false: In a head-and-shoulders top, the 
chart pattern confi rms when price closes below the 
left armpit.
3. True or false: To qualify as a top, price must trend 
upward into the bottom of a chart pattern.
4. True or false: In a triple top, the middle peak can be 
slightly below the other two.


Chart patterns generate trading signals, so I separated 
them into two groups: buy signals and sell signals. 
Th is section looks at chart patterns that signal the 
time to buy.
Th e chapters that follow use bull market data 
based on hundreds of perfect trades, so do not expect 
your results to achieve those described here.
With additional samples, the numbers might 
change anyway, so it is more important that you un-
derstand the ideas presented rather than focusing on 
performance numbers. Th ink in terms of the entire 
picture, from market indices trending, to an industry 
on the move, to a stock consolidating before resuming 
the uptrend.
Th e approaches discussed in the following pages 
are simple ones based on visual techniques. It has 
been my experience that layering on indicators only 
complicates a setup without adding benefi t. 
Th ere is much more to selecting a stock and trad-
ing it—using chart patterns—than I discuss in these 
pages. Use the ideas presented to explore and build 
trading setups that work for you.

his chapter begins looking at chart patterns as 
trading tools. Now that we can identify chart pat-
terns, we can use these tools as signals to help time 
our entry into the markets.
Th e basic setup rules are the same for most of the 
chart patterns we have covered. Here they are.
Setup Rules:
 1. Place a buy stop a penny above the top trendline 
to catch the upward breakout. 
 2. Once into the trade, place a stop a penny below 
the bottom of the chart pattern. 
Notice the absence of moving averages and other 
indicators. Simple is best.
I tested this setup on most of the chart patterns 
in this book and discuss those results later. Here 
are actual trades I made that show how the signals 
work.
Ascending Triangle Buy Signal
When price breaks out upward from an ascending 
triangle, buy. For example, pictured in Exhibit 18.1 is a 
trade I made in one.
In my trading notebook, I wrote, “Oils are hot, and 
I think this stock has room to grow. Plus, it pays a divi-
dend. Book score is –1, but that expects a throwback, 
and I’ll be happy if price comes close to the predicted 
65.91 book score target.”
Th e book score I mention is from my Trading 
Classic Chart Patterns book, which discusses a scor-
ing system to rate the probability of price reaching a 
target. In this case, the target was 65.91, and the sys-
tem suggested that it would be diffi  cult for the stock 
to climb that far before tumbling. It was right. 
Th e day before the breakout, I placed a buy stop at 
52.06, which is a penny above the top of the triangle. It 
fi lled the next day at 52.07, A.

with 55.20. I show that on the chart as D. As the chart 
shows, the stock pretended it was an untethered he-
lium balloon and soared. 
Although I do not show them, I raised the stop 
seven times as price climbed. Th e highest stop was at 
61.15 and it fi lled at 60.90, B, in a late-day sell-oﬀ  that 
popped the balloon and blew through my stop on the 
way down.
I made 17 percent on this trade in 37 days.
Placing a buy order a penny above the top trendline 
is important since additional peaks may stop right at 
the line. 
I placed a stop below the minor low at C, 49.21. If 
the chart pattern is tall, a stop located below the bot-
tom of the chart pattern can entail a signifi cant loss. 
Instead, I located the stop closer.
I used the measure rule, which I will discuss in 
Chapter 24, to calculate a price target and came up 
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Place a buy stop a penny above, 
and stop loss order a penny 
below, the chart pattern so that 
a tie with the chart pattern 
boundary does not trigger a trade.

However, I will not chase a stock. When I looked at 
it after the open, it had climbed to 34 from the prior 
day’s close at 33.46, so I took half of that and placed a 
limit order to buy at 33.78. Th at fi lled.
Th e bottom of the triangle was at 32.50, so I placed 
a stop at 32.46, below the minor low at C. Th e upside

(circled) and a taller band above that, starting at

SMART INVESTOR TIP
Be wary of trading ascending 
triangles. Although the breakout 
is upward 67 percent of the time 
in bull markets (only), the rise 
may not last long.
Descending Triangle Buy Signal
A descending triangle with an upward breakout is one 
of my favorite chart patterns to trade, and Exhibit 18.2 
shows how I do it. 
On May 16, the company announced earnings 
and scheduled a conference call the next morning to 
discuss it. I vowed to buy the stock if it gapped open 
higher. Th at is what happened.

out, then skip the trade.

before dropping seven points in two days. Maybe sell-
ing was a good choice after all.
Double Bottom Buy Signal
Th e basic double bottom setup uses a buy stop a 
penny above the top of the chart pattern to get you 
into the trade in a timely matter. I do not recom-
mend trading unconfi rmed double bottoms. (See 
Exhibit 18.4.)
Double bottom AB appears on the weekly chart 
so I could show you the entire trade. I bought at the 
open the day after the double bottom confi rmed and 
received a fi ll of 5.94 (C).
Th is double bottom has a tall left side, so I also 
called it a Big W chart pattern. Th e uneven bottoms 
(A and B) did not bother me. 
In June 2009, one fi rm rated the stock a strong buy. 
Another said it was a strong sell. Go fi gure. One of 
them was wrong.
A year later, in early July 2010, I was getting worried. 
Th e stock had pierced trendline E (shown in blue). I 
was also predicting a bear market then. I started plac-
ing a stop and raising it as price climbed. However, 
about a week later, Intel said that they had the best 
quarter in a decade, so I fi gured this stock would do 
well, too. I canceled the stop.
In January 2011, I wrote in my notebook, “Th is 
looks like it’s going to drop back to 13 then 12 then 11.” 
On February 16, I placed a stop below a minor low 
at 17.55 and the stock hit it a week later. 
KEY POINT: 
Price fails to conﬁ rm a twin 
bottom chart pattern 44 percent 
of the time. That means you will 
be wrong to buy an unconﬁ rmed 
twin bottom pattern almost half 
the time.
locations where the stock might plow into diffi  culty. 
Th ey would become sell points if I thought price was 
going to reverse.
Price climbed for several days, but my notes 
warned of (1) candles getting shorter, (2) price stalling 
at the gap (E), (3) completion of a Big W pattern (AB), 
and (4) price exceeding my original target. Th e possi-
bility of continued gains decreased, so I decided to sell 
and received an average price of about 36.80. I made 9 
percent in 6 days.
Symmetrical Triangle Buy 
Signal
Symmetrical triangles tend to be prolifi c chart pat-
terns and that means plenty of trading opportunities. 
Here is a long-term trade I made using a large triangle. 
(See Exhibit 18.3.)
I watched the stock for a few months before buying 
at the open the day after it broke out upward (A). Th is 
purchase used a combination of good fundamentals 
and the symmetrical triangle. I received a fi ll at 28 
with a target of 56. Since it was a long-term holding, I 
did not use an initial stop loss order. However, in late 
April, I started using a stop and raised it four times. 
On July 9, the stock looked like it was making a 
head-and-shoulders top. Th at scared me out of the 
position, so I sold it for a 30 percent profi t, at 35.73 
including four dividend payments.
Th e head-and-shoulders never confi rmed, so it was 
a mistake selling. Th e stock climbed to 41.87 in October 
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Do not chase a stock. If you 
cannot buy it within 5 percent of 
the breakout or optimum entry 
price, then skip the trade. Tests 
show that chasing (a late entry) 
causes decreased proﬁ t and 
increased failures.
FAST FACTS
Almost three-quarters (71 per-
cent) of symmetrical triangles 
with upward breakouts in a bull 
market gained at least 10 percent 
after the breakout.

Visual Guide to Chart Patterns ■193
What are the trading rules for this setup?
 1. A head-and-shoulders bottom appears on the 
price chart.
 2. Place a buy stop a penny above the right armpit 
when the neckline slopes upward, or enter the day 
after price closes above a down-sloping neckline.
 3. Once into the trade, place a stop loss order a 
penny below the head. 
SMART INVESTOR TIP
When the neckline slopes upward, 
use the right armpit high as the 
buy or conﬁ rmation price. When 
the neckline slopes downward 
where price closes above the 
neckline signals conﬁ rmation.
I made 194 percent during a hold time of 1 year and 
10 months.
Head-and-Shoulders Bottom 
Buy Signal
Th e setup for head-and-shoulders is a bit diﬀ erent 
from the other chart patterns, so let us discuss it.

194 ■CHAPTER 18 Basic Buy Setups
A small head-and-shoulders bottom appears in 
January. Th e neckline is the blue line at B. When price 
closes above this line, since it slopes downward, it 
confi rms the chart pattern. If the neckline sloped up-
ward, then we would use the high price at the right 
armpit as the confi rmation price.
Placing a stop a penny below the head means the 
trade will be stopped out 16 percent of the time, on 
average. To ﬂ ip that around, the most you will win is 
84 percent of the time, on average.
Th at is the theory, but how does it work in real life?

I looked at the industry and found eight stocks that 
had hit bottom and were turning upward and four 
that were continuing lower. 
The nice solid block of congestion immediately to 
the left of the right shoulder appealed to me (mean-
ing underlying support). Since the general market was 
weak, I expected a throwback.
I measured the rise from the right shoulder low to 
the peak at D and took 38 percent of that down from 
D as a limit price to buy the stock. The 38 percent is 
a Fibonacci number used to calculate how far price 
might retrace. The order filled at 7.06, at A.
Once into the trade, I placed a stop at 6.05, a dime 
below the right shoulder low.

at C, conveniently stopping out traders that placed 
their stop just below the rectangle.
Th e rectangle at D fared better. Price broke out at 
D and made a determined climb to the summit at E. 
Th ereafter, price formed a double top and that signaled 
an exit when price closed below the blue line, at G.
Notice the dip after the last touch, at H. Price 
touched the top trendline and dropped, but did not 
come close to the bottom trendline before reversing 
and staging an upward breakout. 
Th at dip is what I call a partial decline. You must 
have a valid rectangle already in place (meaning at 
least two touches of each trendline, preferably three) 
before looking for a partial decline. A partial decline 
correctly predicts an immediate upward breakout 
89 percent of the time according to two studies I 
did using 69 rectangle bottoms and another with 
170 rectangle tops.
Triple Bottom Buy Signal
Th e following triple bottom trade is one in which I got 
lucky. (See Exhibit 18.7.)
I took a position in the stock on the basis of the 
triple bottom. However, notice that I bought before 
confi rmation. Strictly speaking, that is a no-no. Oddly, 
I felt that the triple bottom would not confi rm and I 
would be stopped out for a loss. But that did not stop 
me from going ahead with the trade anyway.
I received a fi ll at A, 10.78. I placed a stop at 9.89, 
which is below the minor low at C. I set my sights on 
Although my notes do not say this, my guess is I 
probably drew the neckline to slice through the right 
armpit and rest on top of that consolidation area just 
below the letter B. Th at would mean a confi rmed 
head-and-shoulders bottom. 
I also made note of lots of insider buying during the 
month. 
As price climbed, I raised the stop 13 times, rest-
ing at 11.03. Here is what I wrote about the sale. “Sell 
reason: My stop hit, just as I expected even though 
price closed higher. I tightened the stop because of 
the big 5+ percent decline yesterday for unexplained 
reasons (the market was also down big).”
Th e stock fi lled at 11.00 for a gain of 55 percent in 
about three months.
Rectangle Buy Signal
Th e trade I wanted to share was merged out of exis-
tence, so I have no chart. Instead, here are the rules to 
the traditional setup for trading rectangles.
 1. Find a rectangle.
 2. Place a buy order a penny above the top of the 
chart pattern.
 3. If the order fi lls, place a stop a penny below the 
bottom of the chart pattern.
Exhibit 18.6 shows two rectangles with upward 
breakouts.
Th e fi rst one breaks out at A, coasts upward to B, 
and then gets hammered, slowly. Th e stock bottoms

predicts an upward breakout

rectangles.

Did I sell too soon? Looking at the chart, it is easy to 
see that price continued to rise. However, it has been 
my experience that when a stock jumps on news by 
5 to 20 percent or more, it is best to take profi ts. Often, 
the event day or the next price peaks and then drops 
for the rest of the month, sometimes giving back all of 
the gains and more.
14, where the stock peaked in December 2004 and also 
the source of a long-term down-sloping trendline that 
connected the January 2004 high (not shown).
Over the weekend, I raised the stop to 10.17 and 
when takeover rumors surfaced on Monday, I sold the 
stock at 13.49. Th e stock hit my 14 target that day, too.
I made 25 percent in 5 days.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
An inverted dead-cat bounce 
occurs when price jumps by 5 to 
20 percent or more in one session. 
Consider selling the same day 
or the next. Research shows that 
price makes a higher high the day 
after the event and remains lower 
for at least a month.

and placing a stop below the bottom of the chart 
pattern.
How often does the basic setup work? Th e follow-
ing table provides an answer for many of the chart 
patterns discussed in this book. 

Visual Guide to Chart Patterns ■199
Each trade located a stop a penny below the bot-
tom of the chart pattern (the lowest valley), and each 
trade used a buy stop often a penny above the top 
of the chart pattern (as in an ascending triangle) or 
entered when price broke out upward (as in a trend-
line pierce for the symmetrical triangle).
I measured how often price reached a target (5 
to 20 percent) and the percentages below the top 
row shows the result. For example, 83 percent of 
head-and-shoulders bottoms gain at least 10 percent. 
Th is compares to the worst performing of the bunch, 
symmetrical triangles, that show only 71 percent ris-
ing at least 10 percent after the breakout.
To put it another way, you have a 63 percent chance 
of seeing price rise at least 20 percent after the break-
out from a head-and-shoulders bottom. Th e numbers 
do not include commissions or fees. Th is also assumes 
you traded them perfectly.
Th e numbers are slightly above those reported in 
the simulations that follow because of the measure-
ment technique used and round oﬀ .
Simulations
I programmed my computer to test the basic setup. 
I used about a thousand stocks from July 1991 to 
July 2011 but not all stocks covered the entire range. 
Commissions were $10 a trade ($20 round trip).
I used a 10 percent profi t target to exit and a stop a 
penny below the bottom of the chart pattern. I did not 
trail the stop higher. Th e following two tables show 
the results sorted by the win/loss row.

win/loss ratio of 2:1 would give good results, so I set 
the simulation to exit on a 10 percent profi t with a 
fi xed stop loss at 5 percent below the buy price. Th e 
trades using ascending triangles made an average of 
2 percent (down from 6 percent) and only 56 percent 
were profi table (down from 74 percent). However, the 
largest loss dropped from 33 to 14 percent.
Placing a stop below the bottom of the chart pat-
tern is often too far away, meaning the loss can be 
signifi cant. Th e average height of ascending triangles 
was 13 percent (median 11 percent). If you place a 
stop below the bottom of the chart pattern and price 
drops, you will be looking at an average 13 percent 
loss. Th e biggest loss, 38 percent, happened because 
the triangle was that tall. 
Stop Placement
Correct stop placement is an art backed by research. 
I have looked at many types of techniques for stop 
placement and measured their success rates with 
Th e head-and-shoulders bottom is the best per-
forming. Winning trades occurred 82 percent of 
the time, making an average of 7 percent in 40 days. 
During that time, one stock dropped by 53 percent, 
but the average loss was 9 percent. 
Th e worst performing were the triangles, but the 
average loss for descending triangles was -4 percent, 
the lowest of the bunch. 
Keep in mind that once the trade made 10 percent, 
we exited, so the average profi t/loss will be below 10 
percent in all cases (since it includes both winning 
and losing trades).
Additional tests using indicators such as a 50-day 
or 200-day simple moving average and various stop 
locations (5, 10, and 20 percent below the buy price) 
did not change the results signifi cantly. 
Th e results highlight some facts. First, chart 
patterns dislike profi t targets. Why limit gains to 
10 percent when price rises 50 percent or more? 
Second, using a stop will take you out of promis-
ing trades, hurting results. Some may think that a

For a similar method, look at Exhibit 18.8.
Th e idea for this stop placement technique is to 
hide the stop beneath the prior minor low, and raise 
the stop when price closes at a new high.
For example, assume that we have a buy order 
a penny above the top trendline of the ascending 
triangle. When the order fi lls, place a stop a penny or 
two below the prior minor low. Th at is at A.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
When price closes above a prior 
minor high, raise the stop to 
below the prior minor low.
actual trades. One of the simplest and best is the mi-
nor low stop.
Place a stop loss order some distance below the 
nearest minor low (often I use a penny to a dime 
below). Others tuck a stop order below the value of a 
30-week moving average on the date of the minor low. 
Weinstein discusses this method in his book, Stan 
Weinstein’s Secrets for Profi ting in Bull and Bear Markets.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Placing a stop below a minor 
low works well, but market 
professionals may suspect that 
stops are hiding there and try to 
push the stock to hit those stops.

Th is chapter shows what some of those failures 
look like and gives hints on how to avoid them. Th e 
fi rst hint is to buy stocks that only go up. If you can 
do that, then you do not need to read the rest of this 
chapter, and you can retire at 36 as I did. 
Triangle Failures
For the rest of you mere mortals, imagine that you 
have a buy stop a penny above the top of the ascend-
ing triangle shown in Exhibit 19.1. 
Price breaks out upward at A, and you are over-
joyed at getting in on the ground ﬂ oor of an advance.
Th en, just three days later, your mood changes 
when price drops and busts the triangle for the fi rst 
time. Fortunately, the stock remains above the bottom 
of the chart pattern where you have a stop loss order. 
Price climbs above the top of the triangle and you 
are smiling again. Th e smile is brief because price 
drops, busting the pattern for the second time. Th is 
time, the stock drops far enough to hit your stop and 
take you out of the trade for a loss. 
Almost as soon as the stock cashes you out, it turns, 
rises, and busts the triangle for the third time. In fact, 
the busting continues until the stock moves more 
than 10 percent away from the top of the triangle.
Th e exhibit shows what a triple busted ascending 
triangle looks like. Before trading ascending triangles, 
look for as many as you can fi nd in the stocks you 
trade. See how price behaves. If they are as treacherous 
as this one, then look elsewhere.
Another Dud
Too many trades looks like this one. (See Exhibit 19.2.)
Price begins a long uptrend in late August (some 
of the move is not shown) and forms a descending tri-
angle in the spring of 2011. Price breaks out upward at 
A and climbs for a time before reversing and busting

the triangle when it closes below the bottom of the 
chart pattern.
How often does a bust occur? Answer: 22 percent 
of the time. 
One key to this failure and others like it is the 
length of the upward price trend leading to the chart 
pattern. Th e earlier the chart pattern appears in that 
trend, the better.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
The longer the price trend leading 
to the start of a chart pattern, the 
worse the performance.
A check of the numbers confi rms this. Th ose 
chart patterns with a short-term period (less than 
three months) from the start of the trend to the 
chart pattern gain an average of 40 percent after an 
upward breakout. Th ose with an intermediate-term 
trend (three to six months) gain 37 percent, and 
those with a long-term trend (over six months) gain 
just 27 percent.

Double Bottom Failures
When I looked at my spreadsheet of trades, much of 
what I saw was blood from double bottoms that failed 
to produce a profi t. One example of how that can hap-
pen is shown in Exhibit 19.3.
Th e downtrend begins at G on the far left of the 
chart. When the stock bottoms at double bottom AB, 
the stock had tumbled 38 percent. You might think the 
stock would be a buy at that level, especially when a 
double bottom reversal appears.
A chart pattern at the 
end of a long trend may 
signal a trend reversal, 
regardless of the break-
out direction.

If you bought this stock at the breakout B or 
soon after, you may have placed a stop below the 
prior minor low. That would be below the right 
shoulder. 
Th ose traders waiting for a throwback (C) would 
see D as the turn higher or even E and buy. Th ey would 
probably use the low at D or E as the stop, only for 
a ride to the mortuary when their heart stopped as 
price collapsed to F.
If you were a courageous type, you may have placed 
a stop below the head. Th at would have worked in this 
case, but the potential loss was huge, 54 percent below 
the breakout! Th ree hundred joules. Clear!
This head-and-shoulders bottom forecasted the 
turn from bear market to bull. Three days after F, 
the general market turned bullish. The chart shows 
how tasty the recovery can be after a bear market

Rectangle Failures
One failure of a rectangle top to perform up to expec-
tations I show in Exhibit 19.5.
Price launches skyward at A and overshoots the 
start of the chart pattern at B. Th en price moves side-
ways, but notice that the bottoms trend higher (blue 
trendline). Th is pattern is an ascending triangle, but 
the valleys are close enough to the trendline that it is 
fi ne as a rectangle top as well.
I say rectangle top and not a bottom because you 
should ignore overshoot (B) just before the chart

back completed).
Th ose that bought in on candle F had all of a week 
to exit before the stock collapsed into loss territory. 
Th e stock continued down, hitting the stop to cash 
you out for a loss and bottoming at H, 24 percent be-
low the stop and 53 percent below the high at G.
Th e moral of this story is manifold. 
 1. Not having a stop in place can be a bad decision. 
 2. It does not have to be a bear market before a stock 
loses a lot of money.
 3. It can be diﬃ  cult to determine when the market 
(or stock) bottoms.
Head-and-Shoulders Bottom 
Failures
As with any chart pattern, failures occur when price 
fails to trend in the expected direction. Exhibit 19.4 
shows an example.
Let us begin with the measure rule to see what 
it says (I discuss how to use the measure rule in 
Chapter 24). Th e head low is at 5.71 and the neckline 
dot is at 14.38 for a height of 8.67. Added to the break-
out price of 12.50, it says the target should be 21.17. 
Does that make sense? No. Why not? Because the 
rise means a gain of 69 percent. Th at is much too high 
to be realistic. “But the stock reached the target!” I can 
hear you say. My reply: “Don’t confuse the issue with 
facts!”
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Use the measure rule to determine 
how far price might move after 
the breakout from a chart pattern. 
If the percentage change is too 
large or predicts a move below 
zero, then discard the prediction.

Look what happens next. The stock parachutes 
back to earth and lands at D, just above the launch

you ponder that. 
pattern. The price trend is upward leading to the chart 
pattern, not downward from the top of the one-day 
overshoot.
Price breaks out upward from the pattern at C, 
but then runs into trouble. The stock bumps its head 
against resistance at the price level of B and at the 
diamond top in February.

nother setup that some traders prefer is to wait 
for a throwback to complete before buying. T at 
is especially important if you fail to recognize a chart 
pattern before the breakout or if price launches up-
ward in a blastoﬀ  move that sends the stock into orbit 
before you can hit the buy button.
T rowbacks occur when price breaks out upward 
from a chart pattern, but the stock returns to the 
breakout price or trendline boundary within a month. 
A check of the data shows that since 2000, a throw-
back happened 58 percent of the time in 10,305 chart 
patterns of various types. 
T e key to the throwback buy setup is to wait for 
the throwback to complete before taking a position in 
the stock. I have a few ideas on how to do that.
Triangle Throwbacks
Exhibit 20.1 shows an example of a throwback in an 
ascending triangle.
T e chart pattern breaks out upward at B, but within 
a few days, price throws back to the breakout price (A) 
by hitting an air pocket so severe that it would scare 
the living daylights out of most passengers. 
T ose owning the stock chew their ﬁ ngernails as 
the stock gains altitude to G, but then another down-
draft sucks the stock lower, crashing below the bot-
tom of the chart pattern at C and stopping them out 
for a loss.
T is chart is an example of how treacherous throw-
backs can be. What if you waited for the throwback to 
complete before taking a position in the stock?
Statistics show that ascending triangles with 
throwbacks have gains averaging 28 percent. T ose 
without throwbacks average 42 percent (based on per-
fect trades). If you wait for a throwback, you will be 
giving up the best performing trades when price turns 
into a jet airliner and takes oﬀ .
By waiting for a throwback to complete, missing 
big winners is the cost of doing business. T e good 
FAST FACTS
Throwbacks occur 60 percent of 
the time in ascending triangles. 
In 25 percent of the throwback 
cases, price drops below the bot-
tom of the chart pattern.

216 ■CHAPTER 20 The Throwback Buy Setup
news is that you also sidestep 25 percent of the cases 
where the throwback forced price below the bottom 
of the ascending triangle, potentially stopping you out 
for a loss. Waiting means you increase your chance of 
having a winning trade.
Here is the trading setup based on this idea. 
FAST FACTS
When a throwback occurs, per-
formance suffers. Breakouts with 
above average volume are more 
likely to throwback than are those 
with below average volume.
 1. Wait for a throwback.
 2. After the throwback completes, take a position.
A throwback completes when:
Option A: Price closes above the top of the chart 
pattern.
Exhibit 20.1: KALU US Equity (Kaiser Aluminum Corp)
By convention, a throw-
back occurs after an 
upward breakout when 
price returns to the 
breakout price or trend-
line boundary within 30 
days.

Option B: Price forms a higher peak and higher valley.
Option C: Price rises above the highest peak between 
the breakout and throwback low.
Option A. If you wait for price to close above the top 
of the chart pattern again (after a throwback), then 
that is a good way to determine price has recovered 
from the throwback. T at happens at D in Exhibit 20.1.
T is is a good method because the chart pattern 
can act as overhead resistance, so if price drops too 
far during a throwback, it might hit that overhead 
resistance and then turn back down. Waiting for 
it to punch through that resistance removes that 
concern.
Buying at D also gets you into the trade at a good 
price. It is as if you bought near the original breakout 
price. 
Option B. Another way to determine throwback 
completion is to trail a buy stop above a prior minor 
high as price drops during the throwback. For ex-
ample, place an initial buy stop above E. When price 
drops below the blue line (drawn from the low after E, 
to the right), lower the buy stop to G or F. Keep lower-
ing the buy stop as price drops, but remember that the 
chart pattern still poses overhead resistance.
Waiting for price to rise above the lowest peak will 
result in a failed trade if the primary trend switches to 
down. Keep that in mind.
Option C. T e last option is to wait for price to re-
cover completely and begin making new highs. Find 
the highest peak between the breakout (B) and the 
FAST FACTS
Throwbacks that dip too far hurt 
performance. A study of 737 head-
and-shoulders bottoms with 
throwbacks that remained above

ing 41 percent. Those in which the 
stock dropped below the breakout 
price gained just 32 percent.
lowest low during the throwback (C). T at would be E. 
When price closes above E, buy the stock.
A scan of a hundred or so ascending triangles 
shows that waiting for the throwback to clear the 
peak at E often has the best results. Unfortunately, 
this method also gets you into the stock at a high 
price. 
Double Bottom Throwbacks 
Some traders ﬁ nd it smart to wait for a throwback be-
fore trading a chart pattern. T at way, they eliminate 
situations like that shown in Exhibit 20.2.
A and B are the twin valleys of a double bottom 
chart pattern. When price closes above C, it conﬁ rms 
the double bottom as a valid pattern. If you bought 
then and placed a stop loss order below bottom B, 
you would have been stopped out on the throwback 
plunge to D.
By waiting for the throwback to complete, I side-
stepped that calamity and bought the stock when it 
became clear that the uptrend had resumed. 
At the time, the yield on holding the utility stock 
was 5.4 percent. I placed a stop at a split-adjusted 
price of 19, below the buy price of 20.31, and below the 
spike at D. 
Fast forward to March, with interest rates rising; 
I tucked my stop under support at 26.67, which the 
stock hit. During the hold time, I collected three divi-
dend payments and made 35 percent.
FAST FACTS
Double bottoms throwback 
56 percent of the time.

218 ■CHAPTER 20 The Throwback Buy Setup
Pre-Throwback Setup 
for Double Bottoms
T is variation of the throwback setup is for advanced 
traders. Exhibit 20.3 shows a double bottom at AB that 
conﬁ rms at C when the stock gaps upward.
T e idea for this setup is to buy as soon as possible 
and ride the move up to the top, D, where the throw-
back begins. How do you do that?
Setup Rules:
 1. Count the number of higher closes approaching 
what you believe will be a breakout day. If it is less

than three, skip the trade. In other words, look for 
three higher closes in the three days immediately 
before a breakout.
 2. Place a buy stop at the conﬁ rmation price.
 3. After the order triggers, place a stop below the 
prior candle’s low. 
 4. Trail the stop higher by raising it each day as a 
higher low appears. 
It will be rare that price will shoot out of the chart 
pattern as it does in Exhibit 20.3 . However, when it 
does, you will be ready with this setup. 
For the ﬁ rst step, look at the days leading to the 
breakout. If price is making a series of higher closes, 
as it is in this example, expect a strong breakout. 
Research says that the likelihood of a throwback 
drops to 30 percent if price makes three higher closes

Place a stop below the prior candle’s low. I show 
that with the lowest red dot. T e next day, candle F 
appears. Raise the stop to the dot a penny below C. 
With each passing day, raise the stop as the red dots 
show. Eventually, the stop gets hit at D.
If a price bar is unusually tall (intraday, before the 
market closes for the day), say two or three times the 
average height of bars over the prior month (20 price 
bars), then either sell as close to the high as you can 
or raise the stop to a penny below midway on the tall 
bar. Why? Because within a day or so of a tall candle, 
price often reverses. Try to capture as much of that tall 
candle’s gain before selling.
If a straight-line run does not emerge, then look 
back at the throwback statistics and exhibits in 
Chapter 6. Try exiting using time. T e median time 
for price to peak before throwing back is four days. 
T en the return trip starts. You may want to exit on 
day four.
A frequency distribution of the gain from the 
breakout price to the throwback peak shows that the 
stock peaks in the following order: 6, 8, 4, 10 percent, 
and then the other values (at two percentage point 
intervals) in smaller denominations. In other words, 
SMART INVESTOR TIP
In a straight-line run of at least 
three bars long, place a stop 
loss order a penny or two below 
the prior bar’s low to capture as 
much of the run as you can. Trail 
the stop higher each bar, placing 
the stop a penny below the prior 
bar’s low price. Never lower the 
stop. This is especially useful 
for day traders, but only in a 
straight-line run. 
the stock tends to rise 6 percent the most in a throw-
back. In second place, the stock rises 8 percent. T ird 
place is 4 percent and so on. Use those percentages as 
guides to what you can expect when price breaks out 
upward.
If you see a large price overlap, then a reversal could 
be next. Use Bollinger bands and look for a low volatil-
ity day. If the bands narrow considerably, then expect 
a more volatile day (meaning a potential reversal with 
a large price swing as volatility increases).
Play with this setup on paper to see if you can scalp 
some bucks from the breakout.
Pre-Throwback Setup for 
Rectangles
Exhibit 20.4 shows a setup I developed for rectangles 
that capitalizes on price behavior before a throwback.
T e exhibit shows a rectangle bottom with an up-
ward breakout. T e setup buys the breakout and sells 
at either a 5 percent gain or after three price bars. No 
stop is used.
Here are the rules for this setup.
 1. Stocks under $5 excluded.
 2. Place a buy stop a penny above the top of the chart 
pattern.
 3. If the order executes, exit if price rises 5 percent 
above the buy price.
 4. Otherwise, exit at the close three bars later.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
When Bollinger bands narrow 
(called a “squeeze”) considerably, 
expect a large price move (higher 
volatility). Higher volatility 
follows lower volatility.

Visual Guide to Chart Patterns ■221
T e next day, the opening price is 12.62, which 
is more than 5 percent above the target price. T e 
trade exits at that time. If price fails to climb at least 
5 percent, then the trade would exit three price bars 
after entry (on bar four).
T e exhibit shows how the setup works. Entry 
occurs when price gaps above the top of the rectan-
gle, so the buy price is the opening price, $11.98. Five 
percent above this is $12.58. I did not allow an exit on 
the ﬁ rst day, but that is a software coding issue. T e 
earliest exit will occur at the open the next day.
FAST FACTS
Rectangles throw back between 
59 percent (rectangle bottoms) 
and 64 percent (rectangle tops) of 
the time in a bull market.

222 ■CHAPTER 20 The Throwback Buy Setup
How well does this work? I tested 1,001 rectangles 
with upward breakouts and found the following.
When the setup exited because price had climbed 
at least 5 percent, the setup made $583 and exited 
using that method 433 times. T e other 568 exits were 
because time reached the three-bar limit. T e average 
time limited trade made just $1.05. T at suggests a 
search for a more optimum time exit is advisable. 
A check of four days showed that the results were 
worse. T e time exit trades posted an average loss 
of $1.59. At two days, the time-limited trades gained 
$13.17. Shorter is the way to go, especially since it 
cuts the drawdown and market exposure. However, it 
also cuts proﬁ ts. T e average win drops to $283 from 
$312.
Notice that the setup does not use any fancy indi-
cators and yet generates a respectable return over the 
testing period from July 1991 to November 2011. T at 
covers two bear markets and three bull ones.
T e next chapter discusses using the measure rule 
for ﬂ ags and pennants. T ose half-staﬀ  patterns can

his chapter explains how the measure rule applies 
to ﬂ ags and pennants, and how traders can use it 
to predict a trend change.
Traders knowledgeable about ﬂ ags and pennants 
know them as half-staff patterns. T at means they 
can appear midway in a price trend. Let me explain 
using Exhibit 21.1.
T e position of pennant BC is about midway in 
trend AD. Since you know the length of the ﬂ agpole 
(AB), you can project the price where the trend could 
end. It does not always work, of course, but ﬂ ags and 
pennants are handy when you need to determine a 
trend’s lifetime.
The Measure Rule
If BC is the midpoint in the price trend, then we can 
project where the stock will end its run. Here is how 
it is done.
Measure the height of the ﬂ agpole from the start 
of the pole (A) to its end (B). T e end of the pole is the 
highest high at the start of the ﬂ ag or pennant. In this 
case, A is at a low of 57.14 and B is at a high of 64.47 
for a height of 7.33. Add the height to the low price at 
the end of the pennant (the day before the breakout), 
C (62.00), to get a conservative estimate of 69.33. 
I show the target with a horizontal blue line. 
To make this process clear, here are the steps.
 1. Measure the height of the ﬂ agpole from the low 
price at the start of the trend (bottom of the 
ﬂ agpole) to the high price at the end of the trend 
(top of the pole). T e top of the pole is at the start 
of the ﬂ ag or pennant.
 2. Add the height to the low price just before the new 
trend breaks out of the ﬂ ag or pennant. 
 3. T e result is the target price.
Let us run through the next pennant and see what 
the measure rule predicts. T e ﬂ agpole begins at 
DEFINITION:
Half-staff patterns
Flags and pennants can appear 
midway in a price trend, so that 
is why they are known as half-
staff patterns.

SMART INVESTOR TIP
Use the measure rule for ﬂ ags 
and pennants to predict the end 
of a trend. Take the height of the 
ﬂ agpole and add it to the low 
price the day before the ﬂ ag or 
pennant breakout. The result is 
the target price.

G (70.50) for a target of 76.73. Again, price falls short 
of the target.
If you look at the size of ﬂ ag FG in comparison to 
the height of the ﬂ agpole (EF), the price trend bends 
because of the weight. I would use a longer ﬂ agpole 
(CF) to support this ﬂ ag, and lengthen the ﬂ ag to 
include the low at I in the measure rule. T at does 
SMART INVESTOR TIP
The size of the ﬂ ag or pennant 
should be proportional to the 
height of the ﬂ agpole. Distrust 
long ﬂ agpoles and short ﬂ ags or 
unusually long ﬂ ags and squatty-
looking ﬂ agpoles.

of 8.48. Add this to the low at E (68.30) for a target of 
76.78. T e high at H is 76.00, so the measure rule fails 
in this example by 78 cents.
Another example: For the next ﬂ ag, the ﬂ agpole 
begins at E (68.30) and rises to a high of 74.53 at F for 
a height of 6.23. Add this to the bottom of the ﬂ ag at

I used the time from the start to end of the ﬂ agpole 
(in calendar days) and measured from the end of the 
ﬂ ag to the end of the trend. For the percentage, the 
ﬂ agpole height is the same, but I used the low price on 
the breakout day (the day price moves outside of the 
ﬂ ag or pennant) to measure the trend end.
I used only 149 ﬂ ags and 173 pennants, so addi-
tional samples could change the results dramatically. 
According to the table, the ﬂ ag is positioned about 
midway in the trend (15 days versus 19 days and 
22 percent versus 23 percent), both on a time and 
price basis. Pennants do not perform as well.
Be conservative in your target projections, espe-
cially if the ﬂ agpole is unusually long. Look for over-
head resistance where the trend might end and use 
that as a logical stopping place.

the measure rule with overhead 
resistance to determine where 
the trend may end.
nothing to improve the accuracy of the measure rule 
in this example, of course.
Consider the inset that shows a ﬂ ag blown in the 
direction of the price trend. T e measure rule works 
the same way. Take the ﬂ agpole height, JK, and apply 
it to the day before the breakout, L, to get the target M.
Measuring Results
Notice how the lowest pennant in the series reached 
its target, but the other two did not. T at is a good clue 
to performance. If the ﬂ ag or pennant appears well 
into a price trend, then expect a closer target than if 
the trend is just starting.
How often does the measure rule work for ﬂ ags and 
pennants? T e table shows the answer.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
If more than one ﬂ ag or pennant 
appears in the same price trend, 
use the chart pattern closest to 
the trend start for the measure 
rule projection.

usted chart patterns” is a phrase I coined to help 
model the behavior of chart patterns when things 
go wrong. If price breaks out in one direction, quickly 
reverses, and then trends, it busts the breakout. Unfor-
tunately, the busted ride can become a rollercoaster 
when a stock busts and busts again as it struggles to 
determine a trend direction.
Years ago, I was looking at chart patterns that failed 
to perform as expected when I noticed something un-
usual. Ascending triangles, for example, would break 
out downward and then reverse to begin a new trend 
that saw price soar like a glider in a thermal. “I can 
make money from that,” I said.
After researching the post-breakout behavior, I 
found that the busted direction often produced hand-
some returns. Th is idea became the foundation for 
busted chart patterns.
Th is chapter shows examples of busted chart pat-
terns and discusses their performance. Th e charts 
help identify what a busted pattern looks like, and the 
numbers sift through the also-rans. First, though, let us 
discuss what I mean by single, double, and triple busts.
Single, Double, and Triple 
Busts
Refer to Exhibit 22.1, the single bust panel. Imagine 
that you lost your mind and shorted the stock at A 
(price in red) after the breakout from an ascending 
triangle (blue lines). Price drops, but not very far, to 
B and then it reverses. You have a conditional order 
to protect your backside if price closes above the pat-
tern at C. 
Th e chart pattern busts for the fi rst time when 
price closes above the top of the chart pattern at C, 
and stops you out. If the stock continues to climb to 
D, which is more than 10 percent above the top of the 
chart pattern, then the bust counting stops at one. 
Th at is a single bust. Price breaks out (either up 
or down) and moves less than 10 percent before 
“
229
DEFINITION:
Bust counting
Think of busted patterns as 
triggering conditional orders to 
stop you out if price closes on the 
side opposite the breakout. The 
ﬁ rst time that happens is a single 
bust. The second and third times, 
price closes beyond the other side 
of the chart pattern, triggering 
the stop again.

reversing. Then it closes outside the top or bottom 
of the chart pattern in the new direction by at least  
10 percent.
For double busts, the same ABC sequence occurs 
as with a single bust, but instead of price moving more 
than 10 percent above the top of the chart pattern, it 
reverses again and closes below the bottom of the pat-
tern, at D. That busts the pattern for the second time. 
If price continues to E, which is more than 10 percent 
below the bottom of the chart pattern, the bust count-
ing stops at two.
A triple bust occurs when it double busts the pat-
tern at D, but then fails to drop more than 10 percent 
before reversing and closing above the top of the chart 
pattern, at E. This busts the pattern for the third time. 
To stop the bust count at three, the stock has to climb at 
least 10 percent above the top of the chart pattern, to F.
Additional busts can continue if price does not 
climb to F and instead makes additional CDE moves. 
Price has to close above the top or below the bottom 
of the chart pattern and move less than 10 percent be-
fore reversing. The counting ends if price moves more 
than 10 percent above or below the chart pattern.
All of this applies to any chart pattern shape, and 
the initial breakout direction can be up or down. The 
basic idea of busting is to assume a person puts a stop

on the opposite side of the chart pattern and then gets

Busted Ascending Triangles
Exhibit 22.2 shows an example of a single busted as-
cending triangle.
FAST FACTS
Ascending triangles bust 40 per-
cent of the time with 27 percent 
being single busts, 6 percent 
being double busts, and 7 percent 
being triple (or more) busts.
Th is is not an ideal ascending triangle because of 
the white space at A. Price squeezes out the apex of 
the triangle, staging a downward breakout, but price 
does not drop far, to B—less than 10 percent—before 
heading up. 
When price closes above the top of the triangle 
at C, it busts the downward breakout. That would

be the time to buy the stock. In this example, price 
tops out at D, over 40 percent above the breakout 
price.
Here are the rules for trading busted patterns with 
downward breakouts.
 1. Price breaks out downward from a chart pattern.
 2. Th e stock drops 10 percent or less and then re-
verses direction.
 3. Price closes above the top of the chart pattern.
 4. Buy at the open the next day.
How often do ascending triangles bust? Answer: 
40 percent of the time. Th at means 40 percent of the 
time, an ascending triangle with a downward break-
out will see price drop less than 10 percent before 
recovering and closing above the top of the chart 
pattern. 
After that, price rises an average of 26 percent, 
but that includes double and triple busted patterns. 
The number compares to an average rise of 34 
percent for ascending triangles with upward break-
outs. If you compare single busted performance 
only, the gains are larger: 40 percent instead of 
26 percent.
Th e results say that trading upward breakouts is 
best, but when you see a downward breakout that re-
verses quickly, buying it can be as exciting as discover-
ing that the birds have not yet pecked into your ripe 
tomatoes (that is a problem in my garden, but so are 
spider mites).
Busted Descending Triangles
A busted descending triangle means a downward 
breakout followed by price closing above the top of 
the triangle. I show that scenario in Exhibit 22.3.
Two red lines bound the descending triangle 
tighter than a calf at a rodeo roping contest, and the 
stock breaks out downward at A. Price drops less than 
10 percent before reversing direction and closing 
above the top of the chart pattern. Th at happens at B. 
Buy at the open the next day.
At C, the company announces earnings that are as 
exciting to traders as chocolate Easter bunnies are to 
kids (and adults). 
A full 40 percent of descending triangles with 
downward breakouts bust at least once. Th e aver-
age rise after busting above the top of the triangle is 
29 percent.
Th e results are based on perfect trades using 250 
busted descending triangles, so do not expect to 
duplicate the results in actual trading.
Busted Symmetrical Triangles
Until I studied busted chart patterns, I thought that 
symmetrical triangles double busted frequently. I was 
right. In other words, the up and down price action 
that forms the symmetrical triangle can continue 
after the breakout, making it diﬃ  cult to profi t from 
them.
FAST FACTS
Twenty-nine percent of busted 
descending triangles with down-
ward breakouts are single busts, 
6 percent are double busts, and 
6 percent bust at least three times.

Visual Guide to Chart Patterns ■233
Exhibit 22.4 shows an example of a single busted 
symmetrical triangle that leads to a good move.
Price broke out downward from the chart pattern 
at A when price closed below the bottom trendline. 
Th e stock did not drop far before reversing. Price 
busted the triangle when it closed above the top of the 
chart pattern at B. Th e gap, C, was a breakaway gap 
that predicted a strong move up.
Buying at the open at B would have gotten you in 
at 62.44. If you were to exit at peak E, 71.79, you would 
have made 15 percent in about six weeks. Th at repre-
sents a perfect trade, of course. 
FAST FACTS
Busted symmetrical triangles 
gain almost the same as the non-
busted variety, 28 percent versus 
29 percent, respectively.

Busted Double Tops
For the next busted setup, I have to switch to double 
tops, which Exhibit 22.5 shows.
Th e double top is at AB and it confi rms when price 
closes below the red line at C. Price drops to D, which 
is less than 10 percent below the breakout price, be-
fore the stock rebounds.
FAST FACTS
Busted double tops are beat only 
by head-and-shoulders tops for 
the fewest number of double and 
triple busts.
Th e stock climbs to E where it busts the pattern for 
the fi rst time. Price stalls at overhead resistance setup 
by the double top peaks and heads back down. 
When it closes below the bottom of the double top 
at F, it busts the pattern for the second time. It fi n-
ishes busting the double top for the third time when 
it closes above the double top. Only then did price 
trend.

Of course, this is an example of how awful trading 
busted patterns can be. If you had a stop in place 
above the top of the double top, you would have taken 
a loss on the first bust.
Fortunately, double and triple busts are quite rare. 
For double tops, they happen 5 percent of the time, 
each, for double and triple busts. Single busts, by com-
parison, happen 23 percent of the time in a bull market.

	 2.	 Price drops less than 10 percent below the break-
out price before reversing direction.

chart pattern.

You may be wondering why I do not include basic 
indicators like the 50-day or 200-day simple moving 
average (SMA) in my setups. Th e answer is because 
they do not provide any value. 
For example, I tested the above setup with a 50-day 
SMA and found that out of 479 trades, just eight had 
the breakout price below the moving average. Th ose 
eight resulted in gains of 51 percent compared to 31 
percent for those above the SMA.
Th e 200-day SMA showed similar results. Out of 
472 trades, 31 were below the moving average and 
they showed gains of 44 percent. Th ose with break-
outs above the moving average had gains of 30 
percent.
The sample counts of those below the moving 
averages are too small to be reliable, but they hint 
that when busted patterns act as bullish reversals, 
they outperform. In other words, when you test a 
moving average like the 200-day, see if your results 
improve if price is below the moving average and 
not above it.
Busted Rectangles
Exhibit 22.7 shows a busted rectangle top. Price breaks 
out downward and bottoms at A before reversing and 
closing above the top of the chart pattern.
I also show this chart for another reason. Notice 
that the rectangle appears midway in the BC run. 
When trading chart patterns, remember that the pat-
tern could appear halfway in the trend.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Test your setup to see if price, 
when below a moving average, 
gives better results.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Chart patterns can appear 
midway in a price run.
Rectangle bottoms perform better than tops 
with this setup in a bull market, with gains aver-
aging 37 percent versus 30 percent, respectively. 
That is for perfect trades, but it serves as a good 
comparison.
Busted Triple Tops
For the next busted pattern, we have to use triple tops 
to buy an upward move. Exhibit 22.8 shows two exam-
ples of what I mean.
Triple top ABC has a downward breakout that 
bottoms at G. Notice that the drop is less than 10 
percent below the lowest valley in the triple top (the 
red line). 
Price climbs and closes above the top of the triple 
top at H. Th at is when the stock busts for the fi rst 
time. 
Th e second triple top, DEF, shows a similar sce-
nario. Price confi rms the pattern when it closes below 
the red line. Th e stock does not drop far before revers-
ing and closing above the blue line to the right of F. I 
drew that line starting from the highest peak in the 
chart pattern. When price closed above that line at I, 
it busted the downward breakout. 
Th e gap is a breakaway gap, so in this case, that 
would mean buying into this setup at the open a day 
after I. For the ABC pattern, buy at the open a day 
after H.
Place a stop below the bottom of the chart pattern 
and then pray. 
FAST FACTS
Triple tops show the worst perfor-
mance after busting, with just 
64 percent of them showing rises 
of at least 10 percent.

For example, busted descending triangles, those 
with downward breakouts that bust upward, show 
price climbing at least 10 percent above the top of the 
chart pattern 70 percent of the time. By this measure, 
descending triangles are the best performing of the 
bunch. 
What the number means is that if you wait for price 
to bust the triangle, you have a 70 percent chance of 
making at least 10 percent, and a 55 percent chance of 
making at least 20 percent.

Busted How Often?
How often does a chart pattern double or triple 
bust? Th e following table answers that, sorted by the 
double-busted column.
For example, head-and-shoulders tops have the 
fewest single busts of all of the patterns in the table. 
Th ey also double and triple bust less often than their 
peers. When you include round-oﬀ  error in the num-
bers, they bust 28 percent of the time. 
FAST FACTS
Single busted chart pattern per-
formance is as good as or better 
than their non-busted counter-
parts.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Chart patterns made of bumps 
(double and triple tops, head-
and-shoulders tops) bust less 
often than patterns composed 
of trendlines (triangles and 
rectangles).
At the bottom of the table, symmetrical triangles 
single bust 30 percent of the time and double bust the 
most, too. Th ey tie with rectangles for busting the most 
often, 42 percent of the time. Th at is why it can be so dif-
fi cult trading symmetrical triangles. You buy an upward 
breakout only to see the triangle bust, cashing you out 
for a loss and probably raising your blood pressure, too.
Notice that the bump patterns, head-and-shoulders, 
double and triple tops, are at the top of the table and 
those based on trendlines, triangles and rectangles, are 
at the bottom. What does this mean? I have no idea. 
Actually, it gives a hint that for busted and non-
busted chart patterns, stick to those with bumps and 
not trendlines.

If you are lucky enough to pick a busted chart

ter than their non-busted counterparts. For exam-
ple, rectangles that single bust gain an average of 
61 percent compared to 33 percent for their non-
busted sisters.

discusses trading tips and more setups.
bust upward at least once, sorted by the “all busted 
types” column. Th e all busted column includes single, 
double, and triple (or more) busts.
Let us take the case of triple tops and bottoms in 
the middle of the table. A busted triple top, which has a 
downward breakout and busts upward, had gains that 
averaged 29 percent. Triple bottoms, which break out 
upward, gain an average of 32 percent. I used tops and 
bottoms to make an aardvark-to-aardvark comparison.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Rectangles with downward 
breakouts, after busting, show 
the best performance of the chart 
patterns measured.

T
his chapter is potpourri, an eclectic mix of chart 
pattern signals and tips. In simpler terms, I want-
ed to pass along this information, but could not fi nd a 
better place to shove it. Any performance number is 
based on hundreds (or thousands) of perfect trades. 
Use the numbers only for comparison purposes, not 
as a gauge of how well a chart pattern might do.
Th e information that follows can help you decide 
which chart pattern to trade and which to skip. Keep-
ing a trading notebook can help, too. Detail the choic-
es you make and track them to see how they worked. 
Just because a method did not work in three trades is 
no reason to switch to another strategy. 
Perhaps you are buying long in a bear market where 
every stock is dropping like a broken satellite. Perhaps 
you have lost your mind and cannot remember where 
you put it.
Consider these tips as provisions for a long expe-
dition. Th ey may keep your bank account alive long 
enough for you to survive until you can fi nd your way.
Ascending Triangle Tips
Ascending triangles are seductive patterns since they 
break out upward 67 percent of the time, but the path 
to riches is laced with landmines. Th e following tips 
may help defuse some of them.
The Trend Start
Select ascending triangles that appear near the start 
of a trend, not at the end of a long one. What does near
mean?
Th e trend start is the date at which price changes 
trend by at least 20 percent. 
Pretend that you are standing on top of an as-
cending triangle, looking back at historical prices. 
When you look over the edge of the triangle start, price 
drops away from the triangle, down to a V-shaped 
bottom. Beyond that bottom, price rises by at least 
20 percent. Th e bottom of the V is where the trend 
starts.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Plan each trade, follow it, and 
then learn from your mistakes. 
Skip any of those steps and the 
professionals will eat your lunch, 
steal your wallet, and make you 
stand in the corner as portrayed 
in The Blair Witch Project.
243
SMART INVESTOR TIP
For the best performance, select 
ascending triangles near the start 
(within three months) of a trend.

244 ■CHAPTER 23 Trading Setups and Tips
For support, you want it thick and juicy. Th at means 
nearby and strong enough to stop a TOW missile. 
Look for lots of overlap between price bars (tight is 
best versus loose). A pullback begins seeing price turn 
from 4 to 10 percent below the breakout, so match 
those numbers with potential support regions. Th at 
way, should price break out downward, you may have 
a second opportunity to exit before being tackled. 
Trading Tips for Double 
Bottoms
I thought that after a long downtrend, price would be 
ready to reverse and explode upward for a good gain. 
Th e numbers say otherwise. Short-term trends, those 
less than three months long leading to the start of the 
double bottom, see price climb an average of 42% per-
cent in a bull market. Intermediate-term trends (three 
to six months) see price rise by an average of 35 percent. 
Long-term trends have price move up by 30 percent.
Th us, the strongest recoveries from a downward 
price trend are after a short-term setback. Other chart 
patterns may act diﬀ erently, so keep that in mind.
Throwbacks
Double bottoms with throwbacks missing or those in 
which price remains above the breakout price tend to 
outperform. Th e average gain for double bottoms with 
throwbacks is 33 percent, but is 43 percent for those 
without throwbacks.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
A downward price trend of less 
than three months leading to the 
ﬁ rst bottom of a double bottom 
results in the most powerful 
recoveries.
In another example, if price rises above the trian-
gle, forming a mountain as you look back in time, the 
far side of which sees price drop by at least 20 percent, 
the trend start would be the top of that mountain.
A study of ascending triangles showed that if the 
time from the trend start to the chart pattern was less 
than three months, then triangles with upward break-
outs gained an average of 39 percent. Th ose with lon-
ger trend starts gained less than 29 percent.
You can apply this tip to other bullish chart pat-
terns that act as continuation patterns. Th at means 
price trends into them from below and exits upward. 
Triangle Support and Resistance
Th e next tip concerns support and resistance. 
Look for overhead resistance that can stop a trend. 
Th is is especially true of horizontal consolidation re-
gions (HCR). Th ey can be like facing the starting line-
up of the Dallas Cowboys on the football fi eld. Price 
might be able to squeak by, but do not count on it.
Review the chapter on support and resistance (see 
Chapter 4) if you do not recall what an HCR looks like.
Before I make any trades, I look for overhead re-
sistance. That tells me where price could reverse. 
Often, however, price will push through nearby 
resistance (say, 5 percent above the chart pattern) 
or cause a throwback (8 percent away is the aver-
age turning point). Look for resistance further 
away than that and try to gauge how strong that 
resistance is.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Look for overhead resistance set 
up by horizontal consolidation 
regions, prior minor highs or lows, 
round numbers, trendlines, and 
other chart patterns. Those might 
kill the trend emerging from the 
breakout of an ascending triangle.

adjusted price of 88 cents to $44, a return of almost 
5,000 percent. It took 16 years.
If you trade often enough, the percentages described 
here should work to your benefi t. Of course, if you are 
a terrible trader and decide to quit, then maybe they 
will let you return to the bomb disposal squad. 
Seven Trading Clues for Head-
and-Shoulders
Th e head-and-shoulders bottom provides plenty of 
performance clues that help predict how well the 
stock will perform after the breakout. Th e follow-
ing is from a study of 1,600 head-and-shoulders bot-
toms, between mid-1991 and late 2011. Th ey represent 
perfect trades, so do not expect your results to equal 
those discussed here. Use the numbers only for com-
parison purposes.
For the best performance, look for:
 1. A short-term (zero to three months) downtrend 
leading to the left shoulder.
Find the trend start that leads to the left shoulder. 
Th e trend start is the highest high or lowest low before 
which the stock climbed (before the lowest low) or 
dropped (before the highest high) by at least 20 percent. 
If the time between the trend start and the left 
shoulder valley is less than three months, the gains av-
erage 40 percent. Intermediate-term trends (three to 
six months) show gains of 36% and long-term trends 
(over six months) result in gains of 33 percent.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Chart patterns tall and 
wide outperform the other 
combinations of height and width.
In fact, when price curls over and attempts to 
throw back but remains above the breakout price, 
performance improves. Th rowbacks that plunge too 
far result in performance worse than do those with 
shallow plunges.
This makes intuitive sense because a throw-
back robs the stock of upward momentum. Stocks 
with shallow throwbacks retain more upward 
momentum.
Height and Width
Tall double bottoms perform better than short ones, 
with gains averaging 44 percent to 34 percent. What 
is meant by “tall”? Take the height of the chart pat-
tern, from highest peak to lowest valley, and divide 
the height by the breakout price. If the result is above 
15.6 percent (the median value), then it is a tall double 
bottom; otherwise, it is short. 
If you want to add in width, then patterns wider 
than 37 days perform better, too, with gains averaging 
42 percent to 34 percent.
In each tip, the numbers are averages of perfectly 
traded double bottoms. You may fi nd a double bottom 
that is tall and wide, has no throwback, and has a short-
term trend leading down to it. Th en price rises just 
5 percent. Th e next day, the company announces 
earnings worse than expected and sees the stock drop 
67 percent in one session. 
A stock I owned, Michaels Stores, dropped between 
20 percent and 49 percent in one session 18 diﬀ erent 
times. I fought back and rode that stock from a split

Chart patterns with shallow 
throwbacks can give better 
post-breakout performance than 
do stocks with deep throwback

gains averaging 36 percent for volume highest on the 
head and 32 percent for high left shoulder volume).
 6. High breakout day volume.
Th ose head-and-shoulders with breakout day vol-
ume higher than the one-month average have gains 
averaging 40 percent. Th ose with wimpy volume gain 
30 percent.
 7. No throwbacks.
Head-and-shoulders bottoms without throwbacks 
gain 42 percent, on average. Th ose with throwbacks 
gain 33 percent.
Monthly Symmetrical Triangle 
Setup
Tall symmetrical triangles mean better performance. 
I tested this and found it to be true with tall triangles 
showing post breakout gains averaging 39 percent and 
short ones averaging 24 percent (627 samples each). 
Again, those numbers are for perfect trades, so do not 
expect to achieve these results.
What if we use the monthly scale and trade tri-
angles? I used data from 1998 to 2006 on hundreds 
of stocks and looked for symmetrical triangles on the 
monthly chart. Some of these can be funky looking 
and it takes some getting used to. Often you will be 
working with two trendline touches on at least one 
side. One example is shown in Exhibit 23.1.
Th e triangle has two trendline touches on the top 
and three on the bottom (including one near miss). 
 2. Down-sloping neckline.
Patterns with down-sloping necklines gain 40 
percent versus 31 percent for those with up-sloping 
necklines.
 3. Tall patterns.
Tall head-and-shoulders bottoms, measured from 
the highest peak to the lowest valley, outperform short 
ones. Th is is also true of most chart patterns, not just 
head-and-shoulders bottoms. 
In the case of a head-and-shoulders bottom, pat-
terns taller than the median 15 percent, which is the 
height divided by the breakout price, show gains aver-
aging 49 percent. Th ose shorter than the median have 
gains of just 28 percent.
Pattern height is one of the key indicators of 
performance.
 4. Wide patterns.
Head-and-shoulders bottoms wider than the medi-
an 41 days show gains averaging 44 percent compared 
to narrower patterns that show gains of 30 percent. 
Head-and-shoulders both tall and wide show gains 
averaging 51 percent! Check your pulse. Do not get 
too excited. Remember, these numbers are for per-
fect trades, buying at the breakout price and selling at 
the highest peak before price tumbles—and doing it 
hundreds of times.
 5. High right shoulder volume.
When the right shoulder volume is above the left 
shoulder and head, the stocks gain 48 percent (versus

a hard exit to sell at 20 percent down from a peak, you 
would have captured a profit of 45 percent.
The system I used to calculate gains would find 
the ultimate high at B and use that as the exit price. 
It represents a perfect trade. After that, price dropped 
by at least 20 percent, measured from monthly high 
to close. The high to close method is important on the 
monthly scale because it ignores the fluctuations dur-
ing the month. 
It breaks out upward at A, peaks at B, and then falls at 
the start of a bear market. If you draw trendline C be-
neath price as it climbs, you could sell on a trendline 
pierce. A safer mechanism is to wait for a close below 
the trendline and sell at the open the next month. I 
show that at D.
If you bought at A (45.13) and sold at D (57.57), 
you would have made 28 percent. If you sold at peak 
B (81.84), you would have made 81 percent. If you set

248 ■CHAPTER 23 Trading Setups and Tips
Rectangles
Are you a swinger? Swing trader, that is. If so, then 
maybe rectangles are for you. Buy near the bottom 
trendline and sell near the top, sit back and collect 
money. It is not that easy, of course. Exhibit 23.2 shows 
an intra-formation setup for rectangles with upward 
breakouts. 
Price bounces between two horizontal trendlines, 
touching the bottom at AB and the top at CD. Once 
those four touches printed on the chart, then a swing 
trader on the prowl could sell short at D and F, cover 
and go long at E and G, and then exit at H. After that, 
click your heels three times and say, “I did not short at 
H”; otherwise, you may be searching the couch cush-
ions for bus fare back to Kansas.
A swinger late to the party would have fewer trad-
ing opportunities, of course. Th is rectangle is just over 
$2 tall, but bouncing from $5 to $7 a share, the trades 
represent a hefty 40 percent gain for long trades and 
29 percent for the short ones.
Here are the setup rules.
 1. Find a rectangle: two peaks that top out near the 
same price and two valleys that bottom near the 
same price. 
 2. Measure the height between the peaks and valleys. 
Can you make enough money trading between 
them to justify the risk?
 3. Short/sell near the top of the rectangle and cover/
buy near the bottom.
 4. Place stops outside the rectangle far enough to 
avoid being stopped out on normal price action.
DEFINITION:
Intra-formation setup
Intra-formation trading is trading 
within the formation. If the 
rectangle is tall enough, you can 
buy at the bottom trendline and 
sell at the top, then reverse by 
shorting and covering, proﬁ ting in 
the moves between the two lines.
Testing using this method showed that the 
129 monthly symmetrical triangles in bull mar-
kets with upward breakouts gained an average of 
111 percent. Just two gained 8 percent and 9 percent, 
with 81 percent of the triangles gaining more than 
45 percent. 
Here are guidelines that may make trading month-
ly triangles easier. Since this is a buy-and-hold setup, 
no stops are used. 
 1. Use the monthly log scale to fi nd symmetrical 
triangles.
 2. Look for at least two touches of one trendline and 
preferably three or more of the other. 
 3. Place a buy stop a few cents above the top 
trendline.
 4. After getting into the trade, let price run. If it 
trends, draw a trendline beneath price. A close be-
low the trendline is an exit signal. Sell at the open 
the next month.
 5. If price rises well above the trendline, then draw a 
new one to hug price better, or sell if price drops 
20 percent from the highest peak.
 6. If you double your money, then place a stop at a 
gain of 100 percent. Almost half of the triangles 
(47 percent) doubled in price, but it takes an aver-
age of 1 year and 9 months to make those gains.
 7. If price ever closes the month more than 20 per-
cent below the purchase price, sell.
You can use the measure rule (see Chapter 24) in 
the normal manner. Price hit the target 81 percent of 
the time. 
SMART INVESTOR TIP
If you are having difﬁ culty 
making money trading chart 
patterns, try a longer time scale. 
If you are using the daily chart, 
try the weekly. If on the weekly 
chart, use the monthly. If on the 
monthly scale, then give up.

Visual Guide to Chart Patterns ■249
Th e next chapter begins a discussion of selling. It 
does not matter at what price you buy a stock. What 
matters is the selling price. 
Let me oﬀ er this piece of advice. If you just focus 
on technique (planning the trade and trading the 
plan) instead of money, you will make more with less 
stress.
Th e rectangle has to last tall enough to make prof-
itable swings, and fi nding a tradable rectangle to be-
gin with is about as easy as bowling strikes.
My experience says that as soon as you fi nd a re-
peatable pattern, it stops repeating. Tradable rect-
angles, like the one shown in the exhibit, are rare and 
should be attempted only by experienced traders with 
a death wish. 
KEY POINT:
Before placing an intra-formation 
trade, make sure the chart 
pattern is tall enough to be worth 
the risk. If price stops short of the 
target, have a plan to exit.

Answer the following.
1. True or false: On a breakout from a chart pattern, 
price often shoots through nearby (say, within 
5 percent of the breakout price) support and 
resistance. 
2. Which, if any, of the following support or resis-
tance features could impede price movement after 
a chart pattern breakout? 
A. Horizontal consolidation regions
B. Minor highs or lows
C. Trendlines
D. Whole numbers
E. All of the above
3. True or false: Short chart patterns are like con-
centrated energy drinks. Th ey pack a more pow-
erful punch than tall patterns (that is, price tends 
to move farther after the breakout from a short 
pattern).

Deciding when to sell is as hard as making up your 
mind and pulling the trigger. Th at decision-making 
process can be made easier by using chart patterns. 
Th ey off er advantages that other techniques do not.
For example, a confi rmed bearish chart pattern is 
a sell signal, and I will introduce you to seven of them. 
But not all bearish chart patterns mean a substantial 
decline. Th at is when the measure rule helps. 
Use the measure rule to estimate how far price is 
going to fall. If the drop is severe enough, then you 
know to sell now and save losing your shirt for an-
other time.

his chapter takes a brief tour through several chart 
patterns, looking for sell signals. With each one, 
we apply the measure rule to predict how far price will 
tumble, look for underlying support, and determine if 
the move is worth avoiding.
Selling Ascending Triangles
Suppose that you own the stock shown in Exhibit 24.1. 
Should you sell at D?
Th e decision to sell or hold is important because 
you face it on every trade. Let us read this chart to see 
how we can decide.
An ascending triangle appears in red. When price 
closes below the up-sloping trendline, it is a sell signal. 
If we are a day trader or swing trader, then our choice 
is easy: Sell immediately. 
However, if we are a buy-and-hold investor or 
position trader looking for a home run, why would 
we want to sell? We want to hold the stock unless 
price is going to make a dramatic move down-
ward. 
To help determine how far price is going to drop, 
we can use the measure rule. Take the height of most 
chart patterns and add it to the breakout price for up-
ward breakouts or subtract it from the breakout price 
for downward breakouts. Th e result is the target price.
For example, the height of the triangle is A - B or 
1.83. Th at predicts a 4.5 percent drop below the break-
out price (D, 40.97) to 39.14. I show the target as a hori-
zontal red line at E. 
Th e target reaches the support area shown circled 
at F. F is a horizontal consolidation region; although 
price is not horizontal, it does show lots of overlap. 
A drop to G, the launch price, is also possible. A drop 
that far would mean a 9 percent decline. For holding a 
long-term position, I am more worried about visiting 
my dentist (the dentist I had when growing up never 
used Novocain; watch the movie Marathon Man and 
you will understand) than a 9 percent decline. 
DEFINITION:
Position trader
A trader who holds positions from 
weeks to months, seeking to ride 
the trend until it ends, is called a 
position trader.
KEY POINT: 
The measure rule for downward 
breakouts from ascending 
triangles works in a manner 
similar to upward breakouts. Take 
the height of the triangle from the 
highest peak to the lowest valley 
in the chart pattern and subtract 
the height from the breakout price 
to get a target. The breakout price 
is where the stock pierces the up-
sloping trendline. Price hits the 
target 58 percent of the time.

The broadening top in early 2011, which appears as 
a loose congestion area, may act as support and help 
stop the drop. I do not have much faith in loose con-
gestion areas because price has a tendency to stream 
right through them like water draining through a col-
ander. Tight areas work much better.
The big worry is the double top. I show that with 
two blue arcs at A and C. The measure rule says that 
this pattern will see price drop to 31.66 (midway be-
tween H and the rectangle’s bottom). From the low at 
D, that is a painful bite of 23 percent. Ouch!
Exhibit 24.2 shows what happened to the stock and 
it gives two warnings: a bad brokerage buy signal and 
an earnings release.
At B, a brokerage initiated coverage with a buy rec-
ommendation just as price peaked. The smart money

Th e price scale is what makes trading inexpensive 
stocks a challenge, but they are also more volatile. 
Th e stocks move a little and the percentage change is 
huge. What looks like a small drop on the chart can 
mean a signifi cant loss if forced to sell.
Look at area B on the far left of the chart. Th at chan-
nel looks like a tight one, with lots of price overlap 
even though it slopes downward. In part, that overlap 
Look at the exhibit of a small descending triangle. 
It is not as important as the surrounding landscape. 
Th e triangle breaks out downward at A. Should we be 
worried?
Th e height of the triangle is small, 23 cents, but on 
this price scale, that translates into a drop of almost 6 
percent. Th e triangle’s height subtracted from the bot-
tom trendline gives the price target.
KEY POINT: 
Calculate the measure rule for 
descending triangles by taking 
the height of the triangle from 
the highest peak to the bottom 
trendline subtracted from the 
value of the bottom trendline to 
get a target price. Price hits the 
target just 42 percent of the time.

head-and-shoulders is not a pretty pattern because the 
left shoulder (LS) looks weird, but the two shoulders 
have nice time symmetry (distance from the head).
Two descending triangles (shown in blue) broke 
out upward, which is bullish.
Let us make this more personal. If your mother—
retired, fi xed income—owned this stock, would you 
advise her to sell?
Look at the scales. Over the course of 17 months, 
the stock did not move far, either up or down. Does 
that give you comfort, that a big surprise will not 
shake the stock much?
Look at the time scale again. A bear market started 
in October 2007, just as D was forming. When A and B 
appeared, the general market was already off  its peak, 
but not alarmingly so. Exhibit 24.6 shows the carnage.
Th e stock found support at D for about a week. 
Valley E supported price for about two months, but 
then the stock continued lower. It bottomed at 45 and 
change in March 2009 (not shown, but C is close). 
If you sold at the bottom, the loss would have been 
28 percent. 
Th is chart is an example of why bear markets are so 
dangerous. Th ey sneak up on you. Th e decline in this 
stock was mild compared to many that lost 50 to 70 
percent of their value.
If you had the cash to buy when the bear market 
ended, you could have made lots of money. I bought 
Ameren the day after the utility stock bottomed 
(3/13/2009) and another utility stock a week or so lat-
er. How do you spell happy? M-O-N-E-Y! 
At E, the company announced earnings that 
were as exciting to the market as meat to hungry 
piranhas.
If you sold at A, does it matter that price doubled? 
You no longer own the company. FIDO: Forget It. Drive 
On. Focus on technique and not on money. 
Selling Double Tops
Suppose you own the stock shown in Exhibit 24.5. 
Should you sell now?
A confi rmed double top appears at AB. Th at means 
price has closed below the valley between the two 
peaks (the red line), at C. Price is going down, that we 
know, but how far? Th e measure rule provides one 
answer.
To use the rule, fi nd the height of the double top 
and subtract it from the breakout price (the price of 
the lowest valley between the two peaks) to get a price 
target. In this example, the rule suggests a decline to 
60.26, or 5 percent. I show the target with a horizontal 
blue line.
What does the rest of the chart say? Th ere is a con-
gestion region at D, which is close to the target. Th at 
could support price if it drops that far. 
Th e stock could return to its launch price, at E, a 
drop of 13 percent below C. Usually I like to keep loss-
es below 8 to 10 percent, if possible, so 13 percent is 
outside the comfort zone.
Th e measure rule for the large head-and-shoul-
ders top shows that price could drop that far. Th e 
KEY POINT: 
For double tops, compute the 
height using the price from the 
highest peak to the lowest valley 
in the chart pattern and subtract 
it from the price of the lowest 
valley between the two peaks. 
The result is the target price.
FAST FACTS
The measure rule works 44 per-
cent of the time for double tops, 
based on a study of 2,332 double 
tops from mid-1991 to mid-2011. 
Using half the height works 
73 percent of the time.

Visual Guide to Chart Patterns ■259
Selling Head-and-Shoulders 
Tops
A head-and-shoulders top is one of the scarier chart 
patterns to see in a stock you own. Consider Exhibit 
24.7, which shows a handsome one.
Th e squiggles on the chart become a valid head-and-
shoulders top when price closes below the neckline at B. 
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Take the height of a chart pattern 
(the possible measure rule move) 
and divide it by the breakout price. 
Does the percentage represent a 
reasonable value (like 10 or 
15 percent)? If not then disregard 
the measure rule result.
As you look at this, one question should pop into your 
mind. Since the head-and-shoulders is a reversal pattern, 
is there something to reverse? Yes, the move up from C 
where the uptrend began. Price could drop that far.
What does the measure rule say? For head-and-
shoulders tops, the measure rule is diff erent than for 
other chart patterns. Th e measure rule is still based on 
height, but it uses the neckline instead of the full height.

Measure the distance from the peak at the head to 
the neckline directly below. I show the neckline price 
with a small dot at A. In this example, the diff erence be-
tween those two is 17 − 14.47 or 2.53. Subtract the height 
from the breakout price, 15.05, which is the value where 
price crosses the neckline, to get a target of 12.52. I show 
the target as the top horizontal blue line.
Shoveling its way down to the target, the stock 
would have to dig through support formed by the fl ag. 
Th e video “Measure rule for head-and-shoulders” 
explains how to apply the measure rule for both head-
and-shoulders top and bottoms.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
The measure rule for head-
and-shoulders tops works just 
53 percent of the time. Consider 
multiplying the pattern’s height 
by 53 percent and subtracting 
that from the breakout price to 
get a closer price target.

That flag looks tight, suggesting that it could offer much 
to support the stock. Nothing is guaranteed, of course.
The target is also near a small knot of congestion at 
D. Whenever I see the target line up with support, I am 
reassured that the target might be real. 
Below the target is more support, which I show as 
another blue line connecting valley C. This line has 
several touches or near touches extending back al-
most a year. Thus, if D and the target did not reverse 
the decline, I would expect the stock to find support 
at line C. If that happened, it would mean a loss of  
15.05 − 11.40 or 24 percent.
A drop to D would mean a loss of 16 percent and 
the target means a drop of 17 percent.

about a week (lower blue line) before gapping lower

Th e measure rule for a rectangle is the height of the 
pattern subtracted from the downward breakout price. 
Th e breakout price is the value of the bottom trendline.
I do not even have to calculate it to know that the 
target will be above the horizontal support line I have 
drawn in blue. Th is rectangle is a wimpy one with lit-
tle power to force price down. But, as we have seen in 
prior charts, a bear market can come along and suck 
the wind out of any sails, or in this case, the EPA can 
force costly pollution control regulations on the utili-
ties, causing the stocks to tumble.
When looking at the big picture, the stock started 
moving sideways in March. Does it look tired to you, 
like it is ready to fall? After holding the stock for a year, 
you would have pocketed a gain of about 10 percent 
not including dividends.
KEY POINT: 
Rectangle measure rule: Calculate 
it by taking the height between 
the two trendlines and subtracting 
the value from the bottom 
trendline to get the target price. 
This works 55 percent of the time.

The symmetrical triangle confirms with a down-
ward breakout at A, which may be difficult to see on 
this chart.
A large head-and-shoulders top rests on underlying 
support as does the symmetrical triangle. The head-
and-shoulders confirms when price closes below the 
neckline and it suggests a sale. I did not draw the neck-
line but you can guess where the intersection is at B.

Th e support line turns into overhead resistance in 
earlier years.
From the height of both the symmetrical triangle 
and the head-and-shoulders top, it is clear that a ma-
jor downturn in the stock could be in the offi  ng. 
Do you sell or hold on like Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt 
did near the end of the movie Twister? Exhibit 24.12 
shows what happened to the stock.
KEY POINT: 
Calculate the measure rule for 
symmetrical triangles by taking 
the height of the triangle from 
the highest peak to the lowest 
valley and subtracting it from 
the breakout price to get a target. 
Price hits the target 46 percent of 
the time.
Th e stock broke out downward at A, as I said. Almost 
as quickly, the stock zipped up to B then plummeted 
to C. The oscillations continued over the next two 
years. 
Th is is the kind of price action that swing traders 
love . . . if only it did not take so long. You could buy 
at the low of each swing and sell at the high, making 
money if you timed it properly.

Neither the symmetrical triangle nor the head-
and-shoulders top saw price fall far enough to fulfi ll 
the measure rule. On a percentage basis, the predic-
tions seemed too far away (about 20 to 30 percent).
Selling Triple Tops
Exhibit 24.13 shows a triple top. Pretend that you own 
the stock; decide whether it is time to sell. Will price 
continue down?
Peaks ABC form a triple top and even though the 
peaks are not spaced evenly, that is fi ne. Th e pattern con-
fi rms as valid when price closes below the red line, at D. 
An important note is that the company an-
nounced earnings at F, the day before the break-
out. We know the market did not like what it heard 
because the next day price closed lower, forming a 
closing black marubozu candlestick. Those candles 
act as continuation patterns, but only 52 percent 
of the time. That is about random, so price could 
reverse.
Th e measure rule is the height of the pattern ap-
plied to the breakout price. In this example, C is high-
est at 42.40 and the red line is at 38.75 for a height of 
3.65. Subtracting that from the red line gives a target 
of 35.10, or a drop of 9.4 percent, which I show as a 
blue line. Price could drop much further, of course. 
Th e three congestion areas, circled, look mean 
enough to stare down a price decline and support 
price. Between those circles and D, I do not see much 
in the way to catch a falling stock.
KEY POINT: 
Calculate the measure rule for 
triple tops by taking the height 
of the pattern from the highest 
peak to the lowest valley and 
subtracting it from the value of 
the lowest valley to get a target 
price. Price hits the target 
48 percent of the time.
Do you sell the stock? Exhibit 24.14 shows what 
happened.
Th e triple top is at ABC and confi rmation is the red 
line. Price plunged in a V-shaped drop, hitting the tar-
get and continuing a bit lower. Notice that the circled 
areas had no eff ect on slowing the drop at all. Or maybe 
they did because price halted its decline the next day.
If you held onto the stock, a week later it had recov-
ered to the breakout price. If you survived the plunge, 
it means the defi brillator worked. 
Th is chart shows what can happen after an earn-
ings announcement, but this one is unusual. Clearly 
the market disliked what it heard because price tum-
bled in a needle-sharp plunge. But then it recovered 
and went on to post a new high at E. Volume increased 
surrounding D, but it pales in comparison to the 
December spike.
In this example, the measure rule worked quite 
well. Notice how price returned to the launch price, 
too, at F.
Exit Signal
The point I am making in these charts is that bear-
ish chart patterns issue sell signals. Some predict 
disaster. Some do not. Signals that scare you out of 
a stock that then goes on to make a new high can 
give a false sense of security. The next time you face 
a similar situation, you may decide to hold on and 
see the stock get clobbered to the tune of a 50 per-
cent loss.

268 ■CHAPTER 24  Chart Pattern Sell Signals
Keep in mind that if a declining stock does reverse, 
you can always buy back in, and maybe at a lower price.
The next chapter discusses busted chart patterns. 
They remind me of the joke that indestructible toys 
are useful for breaking other toys. Yes, I loved my 
blocks, even if they tasted like plywood.
If you obey each sell signal, you will save yourself 
a lot of money and your broker’s smile will be as wide 
as the Grand Canyon. However, you will also pass up 
opportunities for additional gains when a stock like 
AGL Resources (the last exhibit) recovers in a week 
and eventually posts a new high.

E
very trader or investor makes mistakes in their 
stock selections. Even seasoned pros take their 
eyes off  the ball and strike out. How you handle the 
scenarios that follow can mean the diff erence be-
tween a losing game or one that ends your career.
As you will recall, a busted pattern (for upward 
breakouts) occurs when price breaks out upward, rises 
less than 10 percent, and then tumbles far enough that 
price closes below the bottom of the chart pattern. 
To show that would give away too much of the 
price action. Let us assume that an adverse breakout 
represents a busted chart pattern in the exhibits that 
follow.
Busted Ascending Triangles
Exhibit 25.1 shows an ascending triangle with an up-
ward breakout at A. Let us assume that you bought the 
stock a penny above the top trendline and received a 
fi ll at 42.80.
At B, price has broken out downward and it could 
be on its way to busting the chart pattern. If you 
owned this stock, should you sell now?
Th e top of the chart pattern is at 42.79 and the 
bottom is at 38.39 for a height of 4.40. Th e breakout is 
at 41.48 for a measure rule target of 37.08. Th at is just 
above the launch price, C. A drop to the target means 
a loss of 13 percent below the purchase price. To C 
(35.85), it is 16 percent below the buy price.
I also connected several valleys as a support line 
to show where price may turn in the future. If price 
were to drop to the trendline, it would mean a loss of 
22 percent.
Exhibit 25.2 shows what happened.
Th e stock reached the target and found support 
there and at C for about a month, and then gapped 
lower. At A, the stock dropped over 13 percent after an 
earnings warning from the company and a downgrade. 
Th e stock bottomed at 23.51 for a drop of 45 percent 
below the buy price. I won’t buy that stock again . . .
DEFINITION:
Busted chart pattern
For upward breakouts, a chart 
pattern busts if price rises less 
than 10 percent after the breakout 
before reversing and closing below 
the bottom of the chart pattern.
FAST FACTS
The average drop of 241 busted 
ascending triangles with upward 
breakouts in a bull market was 
11 percent.

FAST FACTS
The measure rule for ascending 
triangles works 72 percent of the 
time for upward breakouts.

Busted Descending Triangles
Exhibit 25.3 shows a descending triangle with an 
upward breakout (A). Price throws back, continues 
down, and closes below the bottom of the chart pat-
tern, busting it (B).
FAST FACTS
The average drop of 134 busted 
descending triangles with upward 
breakouts in a bull market was 
12 percent.
I drew a support line setup by prior valleys. Also 
notice valley C. Th is is at the same price as the bot-
tom of the triangle. In fact, the bottom of the triangle 
is a support area anyway. Of course, all of that does 
not mean much because price has pierced it at B in a 
strong move down.

A check of the company’s website reveals nothing 
significant between A and B.
The height of the triangle is about $1, which would 
bring the measure rule target close to the support 
line. If we assume a buy order at a penny above the top 
trendline, you would own the stock at about 25.85. If 
the stock dropped to the support line, it would mean 
a loss of 6 percent.
The stock at the buy price pays a dividend of 
5.1 percent. Do you sell or hold on to the stock?  
Exhibit 25.4 shows what happened.
A 5 percent yield is a good return even for a util-
ity stock and certainly better than the fractions of a 
percent that money market funds were paying at the 
time. That dividend can cushion a fall almost to the 
blue support line (see Exhibit 25.3), but you have to

hold the stock for a year to capture the four quarterly

As luck would have it, the stock bottomed on 
the day it broke through the lower trendline. Then 
it rebounded and made a nice recovery, gaining  
36 percent so far. If you decided to sell and did not 
jump back in, you would have missed a scrumptious 
gain. That return does not include the dividend, too.
Busted Double  
Bottoms
Exhibit 25.5 shows a double bottom at AB that you 
may not have recognized as one. The peak between 
the two bottoms rises more than 10 percent above the 
lowest bottom and price confirms the pattern as valid 
when it closes above the peak at C.

Visual Guide to Chart Patterns ■275
Th is double bottom appears after price drifted 
lower from the twin peaks at F and G. Th e pattern 
becomes a confi rmed double top at D when the stock 
closes below H. 
If the measure rule for double tops is correct, it 
could mean a 47 percent drop to the bottom of the gap 
in August 2009, at I. Th at is huge and hard to believe, 
especially in a bull market.
Th e stock has (breakaway) gapped lower at D, 
heading toward the blue support line. Th e stock could 
return to the launch price at E or drop even more. Or 
it could decide that busting the double bottom is all 
the move down it needed.
Suppose you bought the stock using a buy stop 
placed a penny above the breakout price. Do you sell 
or hold onto the stock?
DEFINITION:
Busting the double 
bottom
A busted double bottom occurs 
after price has conﬁ rmed a double 
bottom but climbed less than 
1 percent before reversing and 
closing below the lowest valley 
in the chart pattern. The average 
drop of 358 busted double bottoms 
in a bull market was 15 percent.

276 ■CHAPTER 25  Busted Pattern Sell Signals
The measure rule, which is the height of the double 
bottom usually added to the top of the chart pattern, 
can be used to predict the extent of the downward 
move. Subtract the height from the bottom of the 
chart pattern to get a target price. 
Eyeballing this one, it looks as if the measure 
rule suggests the stock would reach the blue sup-
port line. That would mean a drop of 20 percent 
below the buy price. The stock is currently down  
13 percent.
The smart play would have a stop already in place a 
penny below the lowest low. That would have limited 
the loss, but it would still mean a decline of 11 percent.
Exhibit 25.6 shows what happened.
I was worried that this stock would drop back to 
E, but the chart shows it stopped between the two

stock turned in August.
The drop does not look far but on a percentage ba-
sis, it represents a decline of 29 percent. The correct 
answer was to have a stop in place to sell automati-
cally when the pattern busted.
Busted Head-and-Shoulders 
Bottoms
The next chart shows a confirmed head-and-shoulders 
bottom when price closes above the neckline at A. 
This head-and-shoulders looks unusual because of the 
long neck (meaning the head is well below the shoul-
ders). It reminds me of a pacifier that babies suck on.

Price breaks out of a loose congestion region

like a broadening top) to close near B, below the 
right shoulder low and at support line C. (See 
Exhibit 25.7.)
Notice the strong move down from peak D 
(part of an unusual looking double top). Th e 
head-and-shoulders reversal says that the stock is 
oversold and yet it appears the stock has more work 
to do on the downside.
My concern, given that the stock has broken out 
downward, is that price will attempt to form a double 
bottom matching the low of the head. Th at would 
mean a decline of 7 percent.

(not shown) shows additional support at the head low 
and from a descending triangle with a base at 26 in 
early 2010.
This is a utility stock and not some internet flyer, so 
the dividend would help protect a downward move. 
However, the head formed not because short sellers 
sucked too hard on the pacifier, but because the com-
pany cut earnings estimates by 20 percent.
If you own the stock, would you sell or hold on?  
Exhibit 25.8 shows what happened to the stock.
The stock made a V-shaped plunge to find support 
at the descending triangle I mentioned but not shown

just four cents off the day’s low. That meant a yield of

Busted Rectangles
Exhibit 25.9 shows a rectangle bottom that acts as a 
reversal pattern, but only for a few days. Price breaks 
out upward at A, but then busts the triangle when it 
closes below the bottom of it at B. 
Th e height of this rectangle is about $1.50, so a 
drop to 26.90, the measure rule target, would be a loss 
of 10 percent below a buy price of 29.85 (a penny above 
the top of the rectangle).
Th e target is near support at the blue line, C, and 
near a loose congestion area circled in blue. Any of 
these could support price.
If the rectangle acts as a half-staff  pattern, then the 
drop from D to the bottom of the rectangle could mir-
ror the drop below the rectangle. Th at would put the 
target off  the chart, at just below 22.
If we call that the worst case, the decline would be 
27 percent. You should avoid those types of drops. In 
fact, why not just pick stocks that go up? 
If you bought when price broke out upward from 
the rectangle, do you hold on or sell?
Exhibit 25.10 shows what happened.
Ouch. Price fi nds support near the target, C, and 
the loose consolidation region. Th is holds for several 
months. Th e company released earnings at D and 
the next day, E, a broker upgraded the stock. Notice 
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Price reaches or exceeds the 
measure rule target for rectangles 
55 percent of the time. For a closer 
target, multiply the height by 55 
percent before subtracting it from 
the bottom of the rectangle.
how spectacularly bad the upgrade was. At F another 
broker upgraded the stock, and at G, the company an-
nounced earnings that no one liked. Th e stock started 
drilling toward the earth’s core and bottomed at 16.09, 
so far, a drop of 46 percent. Selling would have been 
the right choice.
Busted Symmetrical Triangles
Exhibit 25.11 shows an example of what investors face 
when they go bottom fi shing. Price started a decline 
from C, at 39.50, and bottomed at the symmetrical tri-
angle, at 31.49, a drop of 20 percent. After the upward 
breakout from the triangle (A), was now the time to buy?
Apparently not, since a throwback (B) took price 
below the triangle’s apex. Th e pattern now looked like 
a head-and-shoulders bottom reversal.
A support line begins from the circled area on the 
left and nears or touches several valleys as it extends 
toward the right. If price hits this, it will represent a 
drop of 6 percent below the buy price of 33 (a penny 
above the triangle trendline at the breakout).
Th e measure rule for the triangle, which is its height 
subtracted from the downward breakout price is more 
diﬃ  cult to calculate since price broke out upward. Let 
us use the most recent downward trendline touch just 
before the breakout (32.30) in the calculation. Th e 
height is 2.32 for a target of about 30. From the buy 
price, the target represents a drop of 9 percent.
Do you sell or hold the stock? Exhibit 25.12 shows 
what the stock did.
FAST FACTS
The average drop of 337 busted 
symmetrical triangles with up-
ward breakouts in a bull market 
was 10 percent. That is the worst 
(smallest decline) of the patterns 
studied in this chapter.

Visual Guide to Chart Patterns ■281
Th e stock dropped just 8 percent before fi nding sup-
port and recovering. After that, it became a moon shot.
Busted Triple Bottoms
Exhibit 25.13 shows a situation similar to the last one. 
Price has declined from a peak of 45.63 at F to 27.92 at 
E, a decline of 39 percent. Th e triple bottom represents 
a buying opportunity, so you grab the stock a penny 
above the highest peak, 32.41, at D.
Some joker lets air out of the tires and the stock 
defl ates to E. A stop loss order placed below the bot-
tom of the chart pattern would take you out automati-
cally. However, if you forgot to place that, you would 
be looking at a loss of 14 percent. How far can price be 
expected to drop?
FAST FACTS
The average drop of 140 busted 
triple bottoms in a bull market 
was 15 percent.

Since price is making a multi-year low, there are 
no recent support areas. Let us refer to the measure 
rule. Take the height of the triple bottom and subtract 
it from the bottom of the chart pattern. That gives a 
target of 23.78. From the buy price, that means a loss 
of 27 percent. 
Given that you are already looking at a 14 percent 
hole in your wallet or purse, how much bigger do you 
want it to grow? Of course, the stock could reverse the 
next day and climb higher. After all, the stock is down 
39 percent from F and even more from the April peak. 
How much lower can it go? Perhaps you would like 
to average down, buy more shares at a lower price to 
drop the average cost of purchase. Do you sell, hold 
on, or buy more?
Exhibit 25.14 answers that.

I Lost How Much?!
In each exhibit in this chapter, a sell stop placed a 
penny below the bottom of the chart pattern may have 
cost you plenty, but it would have stopped the decline 
that followed. Bristol-Myers rebounded immediately 
and Cabot Corp did not drop far, but the other stocks 
saw price drop substantially.
Of the seven chart patterns discussed in this  
chapter, two were the hold candidates. I do not have 
any figures to support this, but my guess is that the

ful for swing or day traders, but less useful for others 
that have real jobs.
28 percent win rate in these types of scenarios is close 
to real life.
In other words, if price busts a chart pattern, it of-
ten means a strong move down. Sell.

T
his chapter discusses the triangle apex sell signal, 
a method I have mentioned throughout this book, 
but one I wanted to dedicate some time to.
When any of the three varieties of triangles—as-
cending, descending, or symmetrical—are drawn on a 
chart, their apex can signal a turn in the price move-
ment. Th e apex is the point where the two converging 
trendlines meet. Exhibit 26.1 shows examples.
Look at descending triangle A in the middle of the 
chart. Directly above the apex, I have drawn a blue 
line to A. Notice that the line meets the peak—a short-
term turning point.
Descending triangle B, to the left, is not as success-
ful as A in forecasting the turn. Above its apex is B. Th e 
small minor low is a few days away from the blue line. 
In this example, price did not turn at the apex, but it 
was close.
Ascending triangle C also appears to work well, but 
it is hard to tell in the congested area. Th e apex occurs 
within a day of minor low C.
Testing
I used 500 stocks from July 1991 to July 1996 on the 
three triangle types and found all minor highs and 
lows during that period. Th en I compared them to 
where the triangle apex appeared. 
I found that the average distance from the apex to 
a minor high or low was 3.6 days. 
A benchmark used a month’s worth of data on each 
side of the apex and measured the average distance 
between peaks or valleys. It was 13.1 days. If the apex 
were located between those peaks or valleys, it would 
be half the distance, or 6.55 days.
Th is is like standing between two trees 13 feet 
apart. If you stand in the middle, each one of them 
would be 6.5 feet away. 
Th e apex has to be closer than the average, and it is: 
3.6 days versus the average’s 6.55 days. Using the apex 
as a turning point works better than chance suggests.
In two other tests, I visually compared the trian-
gle’s apex to a minor high or low (within a few days) 
DEFINITION:
Apex
The apex is a point where two 
converging trendlines meet 
in ascending, descending, or 
symmetrical triangles.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
The apex works as a turning 
point between 60 and 75 percent 
of the time. Look for a turn within 
four days of the apex. However, 
it will be rare that the minor high 
or minor low turn is a signiﬁ cant 
one (a trend change).

Trading
Look at Exhibit 26.2 for a trading example.
Symmetrical triangle A forms between two con-
verging trendlines that meet at apex C. Directly above 
the apex is B, a major turning point.
Regardless of the time scale, which could be the 
1-minute scale, or monthly (this one is daily), the 
and counted how often the method worked. One 
test succeeded 75 percent of the time (165 out of 221 
triangles). 
Another test using computer drawn triangles 
(which are less accurate) showed matches 60 percent 
of the time (144 out of 239). Both used data from 
October 2006 to January 2008. In other words, this 
method works at least 60 percent of the time.

triangles shown with their apex turning points to see 
how often this technique works, how well it works, 
and how big the turns tend to be. 
When trading a triangle, look for prior examples 
of triangles in the same stock to see how well the 
technique works.
alignment of the apex with price is a good time to take 
proﬁ ts in this example.
Few triangles will show such dramatic turns. Re-
member that the turn is within four days of the apex, 
on average. If you are a short-term trader, like a swing 
or day trader, this visual technique can help you de-
cide when to sell.

rendlines are wonderful trading tools and some-
times they even work! Th is chapter examines 
up-sloping trendlines as sell signals to see how well 
they behave and how to use them.
I have used trendlines to outline pattern boundar-
ies throughout this book. Th is chapter looks at trend-
lines not as pattern markers, but as selling tools. Th ose 
tools alert us to trend changes and issue exit signals. 
Our task is to judge how important those signals are.
Chapter 3 discussed how to draw trendlines, chart 
scales (log or linear), the three types of trendlines 
(internal, external, and curved), and guidelines for us-
ing them. Refer to Chapter 3 if you need a review.
Exhibit 27.1 shows how eﬀ ective a trendline sell 
signal can be. 
Th is chart is on the daily scale, and it is a scary one. 
Imagine buying the stock at B, seeing it climb to D, and 
then tumbling to the August low, below the purchase 
price. How many of us have invested in such stocks? I 
have. Preventing such situations is where trendlines 
can help.
I started drawing the trendline at B and it slices 
through A because both points seemed to create a 
trendline that hugs price better. 
At C, the company announced earnings. Th e mar-
ket’s reaction to the news was a yawn. Price spiked 
down that day and during the next week, it rounded 
over, but recovered quickly enough. 
At D, the company settled litigation that cost the 
company $39 million over claims related to an acqui-
sition in 2004. Th e announcement pushed the stock 
down, and it could have been the catalyst that started 
the downtrend. 
Price closed below the trendline, which was a sell 
signal, and at E, the company complained of weak de-
mand from the government. Th at began a waterfall 
drop that splashed down at 21.86 in mid-August, a 
drop of 32 percent from the close at E.

Th is chart is on the weekly scale. You may ﬁ nd 
it helpful to switch to a longer period when trad-
ing trendlines. Th at will force you to ignore market 
noise and concentrate on the longer-term trend. For 
example, if you day trade, use the daily chart. If you 
use end-of-day data on the daily chart, switch to the 
weekly and so on. 
SMART INVESTOR TIP
When trading using trendlines, 
try switching to a longer period 
chart than the one normally used.
Even if you were late taking the trendline sell sig-
nal, you could have saved a lot of money by selling.

Look at trendline C. It also issued a sell signal at 
O when price closed below it. Th is time, however, the 
drop did not last long. Another trendline, D, formed. 
Th is one had a steeper slope and that was unusual. A 
close below the line was also a sell signal.
Notice trendlines E, F, and G. See how a very steep 
trendline (E) gives way to a new trend that is not as 
steep (F) and even trendline F yields to G. Trendlines 
with a 45-degree slope or less tend to have staying pow-
er. Steeper than that and they tend to ﬂ ame out quickly.
Trendline B begins at A instead of at H because it 
seemed to ﬁ t price better. Th e line pierces price at I 
and that is the sell signal.
Notice peak K is lower than J and it conﬁ rms 
when price closes below horizontal line L. Valley N 
is below minor low M. Price making lower highs and 
lower lows is another clue to a trend change from up 
to down.
When price closed below I, it was the signal that 
told the smart money to sell.
SMART INVESTOR TIP
Lower peaks and lower valleys 
are a signal of a trend change 
from up to down.

triangle, but I drew it parallel for clarity). When price 
closes below this line, it represents a sell signal. 
Use a stop loss order for the ﬁ rst month or two and 
if price trends, then wait for a close below the trendline 
as a potential sell signal. 
In this example, the buy price is at 3.90 and the 
sell signal is at 5.31 (the opening price the day af-
ter price closes below the trendline. Remember, the

SMART INVESTOR TIP
Extend a triangle’s ascending 
trendline into the future. After a 
month or two of trending prices, 
if the stock closes below the 
trendline, consider selling. This 
works for both ascending and 
symmetrical triangles.
Get into the practice of drawing trendlines beneath 
price in a rising trend. If price closes below the line, it 
is an indication that the trend has weakened. Perhaps, 
just perhaps, it is time to sell.

f you are a swing trader, the swing rule could be bet-
ter for you than going vegetarian, but probably not. 
In up trends, it accurately predicts when price is going 
to peak 80 percent of the time. 
I found out about the swing rule when I read Secrets 
for Proﬁ ting in Bull and Bear Markets (Weinstein, 1988). 
T is chapter discusses the technique and test results.
T e inset of Exhibit 28.1 shows the idea behind the 
swing rule.
In an uptrend, price climbs in a series of rises and 
retraces. T e swing rule helps predict how far price is 
going to rise. T e drop from peak 1 to valley 2 should 
be the same as the rise from 1 to 3. In other words, the 
X and Y heights should be the same.
Look at the price chart to see how this works. Point A 
peaks at 29.17 and B bottoms at 25.02 for a height of 4.15. 
Add the height to A to get the target 33.32. Point C tops 
out at 32.83. It falls short of the target by just 49 cents.
Let us take another example. T e drop from 
C (32.83) to D (23.72) measures 9.11. Adding the height 
to C gives a target of 41.94. Price at E overshoots the 
target by reversing at 44.58. 
Down Trend Swing Rule
Exhibit 28.2 shows how to apply the swing rule to 
down trends. 
Look at the inset. Price rises from 1 to 2 and then 
drops from 2 to 3. T e X and Y heights should be similar. 
For example, the rise from A (45.26) to B (60.44) 
measures 15.18. Subtracting the height from A gives a 
target of 30.08. Valley C reaches a low of 30.24, missing 
the target by just 16 cents. 
Testing Results
How often does the swing rule work? I used data from 
the start of the bear market, March 2000, to May 2011 in 
over 925 stocks and found 32,042 samples in up trends. 
For up trends, the target was within ±5 percent of 
the projected target 80 percent of the time. Declines

For downtrends, I used 24,620 samples and found the 
method worked within ±5 percent of the target 67 per-

than 10 percent) worked 78 percent of the time.

n this book, we started with the basics: trendlines, 
gaps, throwbacks, support and resistance, and a 
few other ﬂ avors to spice up the text. Following that 
was pattern identiﬁ cation of chart patterns formed by 
horizontal lines, diagonal ones, and then bumps such 
as double tops and head-and-shoulders. 
I discussed visual buy and sell signals, and that is 
where chart patterns excel. With each breakout, a trad-
er is given the opportunity to make money in a stock or 
exit a position before it takes an ambulance ride.
Trading chart patterns is easy, but making money 
using them is not. Chart patterns work only when the 
market trends. If the stock moves sideways, the indus-
try decides to speed into a brick wall, or the general 
market drops into a sinkhole, your chances of making 
money using any technique diminish. 
Take what you have learned within the covers of this 
book, shape it to ﬁ t your needs and trading style, and 
then apply it to the markets. Learn from your mistakes 
and your successes. Track your progress and over time, 
you may ﬁ nd that your balance sheet changes from 
bleeding red to throwing oﬀ  green in the color of money.
Before you ﬁ nish this book, let me share a new 
trading setup. 
Trade Entry
Exhibit 29.1 shows two trades I made beginning with 
broadening bottom A. We have not covered broaden-
ing bottoms, but they have nothing to do with weight 
loss. Rather, the pattern sports two diverging trend-
lines. T e top one slopes upward following a series of 
peaks and the bottom one hugs valleys.
Two days after price bounced oﬀ  the lower trend-
line, I turned into a vulture and pounced, buying 
the stock at A. I wrote in my notebook, “T e stock is 
cheap and shows support at this level. Oil prices are 
high, meaning fuel costs will continue to hurt, interest 
rates are rising and expected to move up ¼ point 
next Wednesday at the FOMC (Federal Reserve) 
meeting.”
FAST FACTS
Broadening bottoms break out 
upward 53 percent of the time.

Trade Exit
T e descending triangle is a pattern we discussed. T e 
beast breaks out downward most often, so it worried 
me. T e size of the chart pattern suggested a decline 
of at least 15 percent (the measure rule). 
Here is what I wrote about the sale. “I sold my posi-
tion because the stock has pierced the support base 
DEFINITION:
The measure rule
To compute the measure rule 
for descending triangles with 
downward breakouts, subtract 
the value of the bottom trendline 
(the lowest valley) from the 
value of the highest peak in the 
chart pattern to get the pattern’s 
height. Subtract the height from 
the value of the bottom trendline 
to get a price target. Price reaches 
or exceeds the target 42 percent 
of the time.
I felt the stock was at a good price to add to an exist-
ing position. However, I was worried that the stock could 
tumble through the bottom of the chart pattern, given 
that the general market was trendline lower at the time.
T e winds were favorable and the airline’s stock 
took to the skies and soared like a hawk riding a Texas 
thermal. T en the winds blew in another chart pat-
tern in the shape of a descending triangle.

of a descending triangle. With seasonal performance 
moving up in December and peaking in the spring, I 
missed the high by about $3 per share. Ouch. Oil pric-
es are high, leading to rising fuel costs, and interest 
rates are still high, maybe moving up more. So, it looks 
like the excitement is over although today the stock is 
up almost $1.” 
I made 27 percent on the trade, including a small 
dividend payment.
As the chart shows, the stock ﬂ ew to new highs, but 
I watched from the airport. However, it could just as 
easily have dropped back to my buy price at A, or low-
er. My trading plan said that if the stock closed below 
the bottom of the chart pattern, sell. I did.
The Setup
On its surface, the two trades are nothing remarkable. 
I bought at a bullish chart pattern and sold after the 
breakout from a bearish one. 
How would a trading setup based on that idea per-
form? Load the champagne bucket with ice, chill your 
favorite brew, and then I will tell you a bedtime story 
about how I tested the setup.
I have a database of 500 stocks that spans from 
mid-1991 to mid-1996 which I use to test stock mar-
ket theories. I have pored over the database multiple 
times looking for and cataloging chart patterns. T e 
computer simulation I ran used that database on the 
chart patterns discussed in this book. 
Here are the three rules:
 1. Buy when the stock breaks out upward from a 
chart pattern.
 2. After entry, place a stop loss order a penny below 
the bottom of the chart pattern.
 3. Hold until price breaks out downward from an-
other chart pattern or price hits the stop.
I tested 17 types of chart patterns but removed as-
cending and symmetrical triangles when buying be-
cause they suck as entry signals. However, they were 
used to exit the stock.
T e chart patterns tested were:
I Ascending and symmetrical triangles for exit 
signals only
I Descending triangles
I Four types of Adam and Eve combinations of 
double tops and bottoms (eight patterns total)
I Head-and-shoulders tops and bottoms
I Rectangle tops and bottoms
I Triple tops and bottoms
I did not trail the stop upward. I just let the stock 
move between two chart patterns. 
Results
T e following table shows the results for bull 
markets. T e in-sample column covers July 1991 to 
July 1996. T e out-of-sample and 200 SMA columns

KEY POINT: 
The setup: Buy an upward

place a stop below it, and sell 
after a downward breakout from 
another chart pattern.

Patterns with breakouts above the 200-day SMA per-
formed worse. T at may come as a shock to many of 
you, but I have seen it before. Some traders just assume 
that waiting for price to rise above the 200-day SMA will 
help performance. Test it both ways to be sure.
Closing Position
T is setup shows that buying and selling chart pat-
terns can be proﬁ table over the intermediate and long 
term for investors and position traders. 
Swing traders can beneﬁ t from trading tall rectan-
gles as price ping-pongs between the two trendlines. 
Day traders can use chart patterns as entry signals 
and exit at the measure rule target.

your friends and neighbors, post a customer review at 
Amazon.com, and then put me in your will. 
Trade well.
trades use the most recent close available. Commis-
sions were $10 per trade ($20 round trip).
T e results between the in and out-of-sample pe-
riods were comparable in many areas. T e win/loss 
ratio dropped from 59 to 48 percent, but that could be 
due to more than three times as many out-of-sample 
trades. T e hold time probably changed for the same 
reason.
T e maximum loss of 72 percent relates to a trade 
in Coldwater Creek using a tall double bottom at a low 
price. T e stock price nearly tripled from the buy price 
in 2009, but ran into trouble in recent years, giving 
back its gains and more. I did not log any bearish chart 
patterns after the buy, so price stopped out the trade 
when it slid below the bottom of the chart pattern.
T e table’s far right column shows an additional buy 
rule, that of entering a trade only if the breakout price 
is below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA). I 
used the same out-of-sample data as described earlier. 
FAST FACTS
Price rising above a 200-period 
simple moving average at buy 
time may mean worse perfor-
mance than price below the mov-
ing average. Test both to be sure.
