Okay so a lot of people use PayPal (obviously), and a lot of 
people have been banned in the past and want to get back in, 
or want a 2nd account for their "blackhat" activities. Point is 
I'm gonna try and outline the basics on having a 100% 
anonymous (or close to it) PayPal account, and none of your 
activities being traceable. Sounds impossible? It's not. I've 
used PayPal a lot in the past and I know quite a bit on how 
their system works. A lot of what I say below is pretty basic 
stuff, so I apologise if it's no use to some. But it might help a 
few out, so it's worth it IMHO. 
 
First thing to understand is that the majority of PayPal's 
activities are automated. That means they have security 
algorithms (bots) running 24/7 365. Think about it, PayPal has 
over 70 million active accounts! There is no way humans 
could monitor them all. So yeah, this is basic shit, but it's an 
important point to keep in mind. EVERYTHING you do is 
being monitored by some bot, not a human. Of course if your 
account is limited, or someone makes a direct complaint, a 
human will look into it, but until that point it's automated. 
 
Second thing to understand is that they literally do monitor 
EVERYTHING. From basic things to what IP you log in under, 
to complex stuff like how many seconds you take to do 
certain tasks. Seriously, if you can think of it, most chances 
are PayPal have a bot monitoring it. Now I only know a hand 
full of what they monitor, I'm sure there are 100s of things I 
have no clue about. The main ones you have to worry about 
though in my experience are your IP, how much money you 
pump through your account, and charge backs. If you keep a 
clean IP, keep money transactions reasonable, and get no 
charge backs, chances are PayPal will leave you alone. 
 
The first important step is setting up a clean IP. FORGET 
proxies. Do not even bother going there. They are totally 

useless for accounts that you are logging into more than 
once. The only real solution is a dedicated VPN. This will cost 
you about $15 a month, and there are a shit load of places to 
buy them from. Now if you're really security concious, you 
need to buy the VPN itself anonymously. So find someone 
who accepts WebMoney. Once you have your VPN take note 
of the state it's in. This is where your profile information is 
going to come from. So now simply go to one of the online 
directories (example switchboard.com) and look for someone 
in the area your VPN is located. If your VPN is in Miami, FL, 
go do a search for John Smith in Miami, FL. Simple. Make 
note of the address info and save this to a file. 
 
Go make your PayPal account with those details and be sure 
to enter everything correctly. For email use AOL. It looks 
pretty legit. Gmail or Yahoo are fine also. PayPal know the 
majority of online users either have a Yahoo, AOL, or Gmail 
account, so they don't care too much about that (unless 
you're applying as a business). 
 
Once you've verified your email address now comes the 
important part. We're going to add an anonymous bank 
account to fully verify the account. How we gonna do that? 
No not with one of those shitty online wallet systems, we 
need to go find a prepaid debit card that supports direct 
deposit. This can be really easy, or really hard, depending on 
your location. If you're in the US chances are a local store will 
sell one. If you're outside the US you need to buy one from 
someone else. Assuming you are indeed within America go 
to your local store and look for something called an nFinanSe 
card. These things are awesome for PayPal. Or if you're not 
bothered about getting a personalised card sent to your 
address, you can use another one called Mio Card. They work 
fine too. I'm skipping over quite a few things here, but the 
basic premise is we don't care what address is registered on 
the prepaid card because it doesn't matter. PayPal cannot 
tell. When you withdraw money via ACH the only problem you 
might have is different names on your PayPal account and 
prepaid card, but I've found that most times that doesn't 

matter either. 
 
Assuming you've purchased an nFinanSe card, first thing to 
do is activate it by calling their automated number and 
setting an ATM PIN. The minimum load for this card is $50, so 
you want to get as much of your investment back as 
possible. You should have no problem going straight to an 
ATM and withdrawing $40. So you total investment (out of 
pocket money) will be around 10 bucks. 
 
Once you've done that you need to register the card for direct 
deposit. nFinanSe needs your SSN which you enter online. 
It's instant activation, so no delay or speaking to a human. 
This is where the anonymous point kicks in again. If you want 
to break the law (I am in no way recommending you do), then 
finding SSN info online can be done for a couple of bucks. If 
not and you still want to stay anonymous, then you could ask 
the permission of a friend or family member. Remember, this 
information is never seen by PayPal, so it has no real tie to 
your account. 
 
Either way, once you've registered your card you will be 
given a unique account number and routing code. Go back to 
PayPal, enter this info, and they will send you 2 security 
deposits. In my experience this usually takes 1 or 2 working 
days. Once you have those codes (they will show on your 
online nFinanSe statement), you enter them into PayPal and 
BOOM, fully verified account. Now if you want you can also 
enter a credit/debit card and do a similar sort of thing, but it's 
not necessary. If you do enter a credit/debit card make sure 
it's not one of the mass used ones. PayPal check BINs (bank 
identification numbers) a lot, and using a simon.com gift card 
is gonna through up a red flag on their system. 
 
That's pretty much it. 1 anonymous/untraceable PayPal 
account (or close to it depending on how "blackhat" you 
wanna go). Also small point about ATM withdrawals, you can 
research online the different makes and models of ATM 
machines. Some have cameras, others do not. Again if you 

want to be truly 100% anonymous wear some glasses when 
you withdraw the money, or pay some kid to do it. 
 
If PayPal ever do limit your account, and chances are they 
will, then you need ID and a utility bill ready for the profile 
info you signed up with. One word. Photoshop. Again, not 
gonna go into details but there are plenty of sources online to 
get this done, or you can do it yourself. The people who 
check this at PayPal probably don't know WTF they're doing. 
I bet they take a quick 3 second clance at your image 
attachments and pass it along. 
 
Hope this thread helped. If not then that's cool. Yes a lot of it 
is very basic stuff, but I see some really stupid advice being 
given to people asking PayPal questions, so what I'm saying 
really isn't that bad. 
Also I am in no way suggesting you use PayPal for illegal 
activities. I am just showing a way to use their services 
anonymously.
