Preface
Today’s wireless services have come a long way since the roll out of the
conventional voice-centric cellular systems. The demand for wireless access
in voice and high rate data multi-media applications has been increasing.
New generation wireless communication systems are aimed at accommodating
this demand through better resource management and improved transmission
technologies.
The interest in increasing Spectrum Access and improving Spectrum Eﬃ-
ciency combined with both the introduction of Software Deﬁned Radios and
the realization that machine learning can be applied to radios has created new
intriguing possibilities for wireless radio researchers.
This book is aimed to discuss the cognitive radio, software deﬁned radio
(SDR), and adaptive radio concepts from several perspectives. Cognitive
radio and cognitive networks are investigated from a broad aspect of wireless
communication system enhancement while giving special emphasis on bet-
ter spectrum utilization. Applications of cognitive radio, SDR and cognitive
radio architectures, cognitive networks, spectrum eﬃciency and soft spectrum
usage, adaptive wireless system design, measurements and awareness of var-
ious parameters including interference temperature and geo-location infor-
mation, physical layer access technologies, and cross-layer adaptation related
concepts are some of the important topics that are covered in this book.
Broad Topical Coverage
Following the Introduction (Chapter 1), the structure of the book consists of
basically four parts:
• Fundamental concepts and architectures (Chapters 2–7)
• Awareness, measurements, and sensing (Chapters 8–10)
• Physical layer access technologies (Chapters 11 and 12)
• Applications of cognitive radio and SDR (Chapters 13 and 14)

Preface
In Chapter 1, a broad coverage of cognitive radio concept along with SDR is
provided. A brief history and motivating factors for cognitive radio, including
the economic aspects, are given. In Chapter 2, cognitive network concept is in-
troduced and compared with cognitive radio and cross-layer adaptation. Cog-
nitive network design and the related entities are also provided in this chapter.
The architecture of an ideal cognitive radio, particularly with respect to the
critical machine learning technologies, is described in Chapter 3. The com-
ponents of the cognitive radio architecture and their functions, the cognition
cycle, the inference hierarchy, and how to build cognitive radio architecture
on the top of SDR architecture are all explained in detail in this chapter.
The software deﬁned radio architectures and relations with cognitive radio
are further described in Chapter 4. Ideal and practical SDR architectures are
given. The building blocks of SDR architectures are also described in detail. In
Chapter 5, communications value-chain is discussed and some ways in which
the value-chain can be altered by cognitive radios and cognitive networks are
explored. Dynamic spectrum access in cognitive radio is extremely important
concept as it enhances the spectrum eﬃciency greatly. Therefore, Chapter 6 is
allocated for the discussion of dynamic spectrum access aspect of cognitive ra-
dio from game and coding theoretic perspectives. In Chapter 7, co-existence of
diﬀerent types of cognitive radios is covered, as well as modeling the eﬃciency
of the cognitive radios from the Medium Access Control (MAC) perspectives.
Chapters 8 through 10 discuss the issues related to awareness, sensing,
and measurement in cognitive radio systems. General concepts, various cog-
nitive measurements and awareness functions are provided in Chapter 8.
In Chapter 9, one of the most important awareness in cognitive radio, which
is the spectrum awareness, is discussed in detail. Multi-dimensional spectrum
space is explained, methods and challenges to sense the spectrum space are
given. Another very important awareness, which is location of users, is given in
Chapter 10. Location information management in cognitive wireless network
is discussed from various dimensions.
The physical layer aspects of cognitive radio are discussed in Chapters
11 and 12. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has proved
itself to be the access technology for future generation mobile radio systems.
In Chapter 11, the suitability of OFDM technology for cognitive radio is dis-
cussed. Another very interesting access technology that could potentially be
very useful for cognitive radio for both communication and accurate position-
ing is ultra wideband (UWB). In Chapter 12, UWB and its suitability for
cognitive radio are discussed.
Finally, Chapters 13 and 14 discuss the applications of cognitive radio
and SDR. A generic overview and various application scenarios are given in
Chapter 13. Chapter 14 focuses on the application of cognitive radio from
cross-layer adaptation and optimization perspective.

Audience
This book is intended to be both an introductory technology survey/tutorial
for beginners and an advanced technical overview intended for technical pro-
fessionals in the communications industry, technical managers, and researchers
in both academia and industry. We expect that a reader could skip the
advanced technical treatments of the topics and still beneﬁt greatly from the
book.
A basic background of wireless communications is preferable for a full
understanding of the topics covered by the book.
Course Use
The book provides an organic and harmonized coverage of cognitive radio,
from radio hardware and digital baseband signal processing, all the way to
applications. Within this framework, the book chapters are quite independent
from one another. Therefore, diﬀerent options are possible according to dif-
ferent course structures and lengths, as well as targeted audience background.
The topics are covered in both descriptive and technical manners, and can
therefore cater to diﬀerent readers needs. For each chapter we expect that a
reader may skip the advanced technical description and still greatly beneﬁt
from the book.
The objective of this book is to provide an introduction to the major
research issues and challenges in cognitive radio that are currently occupying
research attention worldwide. As such, the book is primarily intended to serve
as a reference for comprehensive understanding of recent advances in both
theory and practical design of cognitive radio and networks.

Spectrum is the lifeblood of RF Communications1
In the late 1990s, nearly all telecommunications radios were built using
digital signal processor (DSP) processors to implement modulation and signal
processing functions, and a General Purpose Processor (GPP) to implement
operator interface, network signaling, and system overhead functions. This ar-
chitecture is attractive to a manufacturer because the same basic electronics
can be used over and over for each new radio design, thereby reducing en-
gineering development, enabling volume purchasing, and optimizing produc-
tion of a common platform, while retaining the ﬂexibility for sophisticated
waveforms and protocols. A few manufacturers called their radios “Software
Deﬁned Radios” (SDRs), recognizing the power and market attractiveness of
the customer community being able to add additional functionality that is
highly tuned to market speciﬁc applications.
In the early 2000s, a few of these vendors made application layer software
functionality available for additional value added functions to aid the user.
Users could add music, games, or other applications, as long as the radio
waveform functions remained untampered.
Similarly, in the late 2000s, many radios will make the software function-
ality available for various classes of adaptivity and signiﬁcantly extend user
support functionality. This will initiate the generation of “Cognitive Radios”.
Thus, with minimal additional hardware, additional software features will en-
able users, network operators, spectrum owners, and regulators to accomplish
much more than with the ﬁxed application radios of an earlier generation.
To understand this important design trend, we must ﬁrst understand the
background, history, and terminology.

1.1 In the Beginning
The ﬁeld of radio architecture has recently undergone a revolution of de-
sign, signiﬁcantly enabled by Moore’s law of computational evolution, where
suﬃcient computational resources are available in DSPs and GPPs to imple-
ment the modulation and demodulation and all of the signaling protocols of
a radio as a software function. This threshold was crossed in 1992 when the
Department of Defense issued a contract called Speakeasy I and subsequently
Speakeasy II to demonstrate that SDR was feasible. It was demonstrated by
General Dynamics C4 Systems’ Speakeasy II equipment in 1997, and grad-
ually morphed from Speakeasy to Programmable Modular Communication
System (PMCS), to Digital Modular Radio (DMR), to Joint Tactical Radio
System (JTRS).
The SDR Forum industry group2 was formed to guide the industry at
large in standards to make the industry practical. Joe Mitola of Mitre Cor-
poration and Wayne Bonser of Air Force Research Labs were the visionaries
who started this organization and brought the industry together to work these
hard design problems, and to begin establishing the new standards it would
require. During this time, Joe Mitola was performing his Ph.D. research at
the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, University of Stockholm,3 and began
his study of what would be possible once radios were software deﬁned radios
(SDRs). He recognized that it is feasible for a radio to become aware of its
user, aware of its network (choices and features), and aware of its spectral en-
vironment. In fact, it could then be adaptive, and ultimately could have the
software to learn various adaptations to its current environment that are desir-
able support to the user, network, operators, spectrum owners, and regulators.
Dr. Mitola introduced the terms “aware”, “adaptive”, and “ideal Cognitive
Radio” (iCR) to reﬂect the diﬀerent levels of cognitive capability.
Paul Kolodzy of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and
Preston Marshall of the Defense Advanced Research Programs Agency
(DARPA) developed multiple programs to demonstrate the possibilities
and the signiﬁcance of these capabilities. One very signiﬁcant demonstration
is a demonstration of dynamic spectral access (which subsequently spawned
an IEEE conference called DYSPAN) and Interference Avoidance (IA).
The International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the IEEE P1900 study
group, and the European Union End to End Reconﬁgurability Project (E2R)
have subsequently launched several signiﬁcant studies into the technical and
economic issues of cognitive capability.
2 SDR Forum was ﬁrst called Modular Multifunctional Information Transfer Sys-
tem Forum (MMITS Forum) to reﬂect that these systems are capable of being
far more than just a radio, and was initiated by Wayne Bonser of AFRL.

1.1.1 Support for the User
Ultimately, it is the user of the radio who must see incremental value in using
his radio. In fact, there is a yearly upward spiral of utility in the industry.
Each year new functions are recognized as “must-have killer applications”
that nearly all customers will want. Unique musical ring tones were extremely
popular, just so everyone could recognize their own phone from all the other
cell phones. Camera phones, to send your smile to Grandma, came next.
Then Bluetooth wireless and hands-free connections to the earphone became
popular. Every year, these new user support features extend market demand
and fuel growth.
Cognitive Radio envisions that the radio will have suﬃcient ability to
recognize common user activities so that it begins to learn to assist the user
and the network with common tasks. Mitola likens this to Radar O’Reilly,4
who recognizes what tasks the Colonel must perform and is always ready to
support those functions. A radio with suﬃcient ﬂexibility can recognize that
the selection of wireless access methods is a function of location and time, and
can remember locations where cellular service, WiFi service, WiMAX service,
Bluetooth, and other services are available and useful.
Awareness may also be able to help the user locate services when he travels
in a new country (i.e., please help me ﬁnd the: restroom, baggage, car rental,
train, taxi, next ﬂight to . . . , restaurant, tickets to the opera, etc.). Concierge
services are easy for a radio to provide, if the radio has location awareness.
More sophisticated services are readily provided by database servers, each of
which has a narrow but suﬃcient depth to be truly helpful to its subscribers
(Mitola provides the example of airline reservation services). Language trans-
lation is another example of such as a service.
1.1.2 Support for the Network
Radios, just like computer networks, generally have a full protocol stack run-
ning from the physical layer to the application. The ISO standard deﬁnes
seven layers for protocol. Other stack models combine some of these layers
resulting in a four layer model. Of these layers, only the physical and MAC
layers are intimately designed and speciﬁc to radio/wireless protocols. Higher
layers frequently follow protocols that have been developed for the wired world
including Internet Protocols (IP), or telephony protocols (SS7, for example).
Many years of optimization have gone into these wired network layer protocols;
re-optimizing them for wireless networks is a current research topic. Cognitive
radios operate on the principle that by measuring the performance metrics of
each layer, those layers and other layers can be optimized. However, the phys-
ical layer and MAC layer are very speciﬁc to radio/wireless applications, and
4 Radar O’Reilly from the TV series Mash 1973–1982.

Bruce Fette
optimization of these layers as a real time activity based on measurements of
local spectrum is the dominant part of Cognitive Radio research and design
at this time.
Radio systems are often supported by a vast but unseen network. For
example, “the array of towers synonymous with the cellular wireless telephony
network will each be associated with base stations, which must be linked to a
core network infrastructure containing the billing system and through which
connectivity to the terrestrial wireline telephone network is made”.5 Even
taxi and police radio functions usually include transmitter and receiver sites,
interconnect, dispatch operators, terrestrial telephony connections, and a rich
support network. On the university campus, it is common to have a network
of WiFi access points and a wired network to aggregate traﬃc to the internet
service point, to the university computer and database servers.
The network layer of the smart radio can be an important contributor to
the stability and robustness of the network. The radio can select an access
point which has less traﬃc, or where the traﬃc load presented consumes less
total resource, at least in instances where there is more than one access point
available. Similarly, the radio can shape its traﬃc load so that no user expe-
riences unacceptable network performance variations.
The radio can also select the most appropriate network for the service
requests of the user. For example, the radio can select a Bluetooth network
access for a local printer, rather than using the WiFi access point, while using
the WiFi access point for internet database searches. Similarly, voice or video
traﬃc can be provided through the most appropriately resourced network.
1.1.3 Support for the Network Operator
Some network operators have recognized the beneﬁt of convergence of wire-
less services delivered through multiple access networks. Thus, cellular, WiFi,
WiMAX, Bluetooth, broadcast digital audio, and video are bundled so that
the service provider selects which resource is most eﬃciently able to accom-
modate a user’s current needs, and that the transition across diﬀerent net-
work access is both seamless and economical for the user and for the network
operator. This topic is likely to become the diﬀerentiating feature of successful
network operators over the next decade.
1.1.4 Support for the Regulatory Organization(s)
GSM cellular radio access has been harmonized across much of the globe.
However, many other radio technologies have not. Each of the nearly 200 dif-
ferent countries has diﬀerent regulatory rules and procedures for designing
radios, deﬁning spectral mask of each radio application waveform, manufac-
turing radios, and acquiring rights to use various parts of spectrum. Vendors

who sell the radios would like to be able to manufacture a common design,
and must have the ability to adapt the design as required for each country,
where they have the right to utilize the design.
Cognitive radios include a policy engine. The policy engine’s role is to be
aware of the utilization rules for all countries where the equipment is licensed,
and to assure that the radio only operates in those allowed modes in those
geographic regions. The policy engine can also include additional rules that
deﬁne network usage policy, network operator policy, and even manufacturer
policy. For example, if software download is allowed into one of the processors
in the radio, the policy may state the provisions and requirements to enable
the downloaded software. Such a policy may be country speciﬁc, allowed by
the regulators, and the software may need to be exhaustively validated
by the manufacturer as compliant to regulations and non-deleterious under
all network conditions, ranging from innocuous to abnormal.
We assume that the policy and downloaded software will follow security
guidelines, assuring that the software cannot be modiﬁed by unauthorized
sources, and that it is validated and un-tampered as required by all parties.
Generally this involves exhaustive testing and validation, use of standardized
protocols and software sources, cryptographic sealing, signatures, and certiﬁ-
cation authorities, as described in SDR Forum Security literature.
1.1.5 Support for the Spectrum Owner & Users
The physical and MAC layers of wireless are now undergoing signiﬁcant re-
search on real time optimization given the ability to measure the spectral envi-
ronment. Through such measurements, it is possible to minimize interference
while supporting very signiﬁcant increases in traﬃc density. Measurements
suggest that cognitive radio systems should be able to increase traﬃc density
at ratios between 7:1 and over 20:1 (spectrum eﬃciency is often measured
in number of spectrum users supported by measuring bits per second per
square kilometer per MegaHertz of spectrum used). In addition to supporting
signiﬁcant increase in users, use of spectrum awareness and adaptation tech-
niques can also indicate interference properties, multipath properties, signal
strength, and in turn, these real time measurements can guide adaptation of
the transmission waveforms to be more robust, providing the user improved
quality of service in multiple dimensions.
Many organizations are now involved in the issue of dynamic spectrum
allocation, which is unquestionably the ﬁeld where cognitive radio is receiving
the greatest attention. Dynamic spectrum allocation is attracting the same
degree of attention that Internet Protocols and optimization received ten years
ago. Activities range from analysis, to testbeds, to languages for specifying
regulatory policy, and many new activities are now being funded by research
organizations around the world.
All of this now converges in the commercial electronics world, as the
next generation of Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) assimilate cellular

connectivity, WiFi, WiMax, Zigbee, and Bluetooth wireless network access
and wireless protocols. Users will expect these devices to eﬃciently select
amongst these networks to accomplish the user’s most important objective
of the moment, and to do it cost eﬀectively. Cellular connectivity may swap
with WiFi or WiMax connectivity as the user moves about his activities.
Since the availability, range, throughput, and economics are vastly diﬀerent
models, users will come to expect the system to make cost eﬀective and per-
formance sensitive decisions. Eventually users will expect these decisions to
be automatic.
1.2 Economics of Cognitive Radio
Many things are technically possible, but what justiﬁes the time and eﬀort
to advance various degrees of cognitive functionality into the radio network,
either in subscriber equipment or in the network infrastructure is the eco-
nomics. In this section, we will scratch the surface of cognitive applications
and the revenue stream.
Since adaptive spectrum has gained so much attention we will study it
ﬁrst.
1.2.1 Value of Spectrum
Without spectrum, no wireless telecommunications or wireless internet ser-
vices would be possible. The telecommunications industry is now a 1 Trillion
(1012) dollar per year industry,6 and the wireless part is growing very rapidly,
while the wired telecommunication services are experiencing a relatively ﬂat
business. As of 2006, the wired and wireless businesses were approximately
equal in revenue. Spectrum is required to support these wireless businesses.
In the United States, the continuing increase in cellular telephony demand is
supported by increasing density of cellular infrastructure.
However, in some regions of the globe, the cellular infrastructure is at
peak capacity and increased infrastructure density is impractical. In these
early warning hot spots, other means to support continued growth of demand
is necessary to continue serving the market demand. Technologies that enable
continued growth include adaptivity, smart antenna technology, and more
eﬃcient use of existing spectrum. More eﬃcient use of spectrum in these high
demand hot spots translates immediately into continuing to support the grow-
ing revenue stream for the network operators.
There are also regions which are under-served by the wired community,
and the wireless community. In mainly rural regions, where ﬁber or cable

is uneconomical to install, and where there is nearly no spectrum use (for
example, in many rural areas, a single broadcast TV source may be nearly
200 miles away and there is little or no local TV service) there are signiﬁcant
opportunities to provide internet and telecommunication services using this
under-utilized spectrum.
In each of these cases there are ways in which to utilize cognitive radio
principles to make additional spectrum available. These methods are being
thoroughly analyzed, and business cases are being examined.
1.2.2 Spectrum Adaptivity
Current research in selection of waveforms or protocols that provide higher
throughput, and reduce interference to adjacent channels has focused on the
exploitation of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) types of
waveforms. In these waveforms, high data rates are achieved through use of
multiple carriers. Furthermore, the order of modulation may be adaptive so
that the number of bits delivered on each carrier is adapted to the noise ﬂoor
and the propagation performance at each carrier frequency. OFDM is already
in use for Digital Audio Broadcast (DAB) and High Deﬁnition TV (HDTV)
and is a research topic rich with additional opportunity.
1.2.3 Smart Antennas
One way to get enhanced spectral density and user density is with smart anten-
nas. Smart antennas can provide narrow beam patterns for either transmitter
or for receiver or both. In the Industrial Scientiﬁc and Medical (ISM) band fre-
quencies of 2.4 GHz, practical narrow beam antennas can provide 9 dB of gain,
and reduce interference to other communication activity oﬀthe sidelobes of
the antenna beam patterns. Even more signiﬁcantly, smart antennas can also
be used for interference nulling, and can provide up to 30 dB of null depth. Ei-
ther of these strategies signiﬁcantly increases the feasible user density. Smart
antenna techniques may be economically costly for certain applications, and
may be impractical for certain form factors, but much research attention must
be focused on this topic, as it provides the greatest opportunities for increased
user density.
1.2.4 MIMO
Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) is a communication technique in which
the multipath properties of the channel are utilized to support greater data
throughput. In a MIMO system, the transmitter transmits multiple channels
of data traﬃc through multiple antennas; the receiver learns the channel be-
havior between the transmitter’s multiple antennas and the receiver’s multiple
antennas, and uses signal processing to compute what waveform was trans-
mitted by each transmitting antenna, and the corresponding data stream.

8
Bruce Fette
In this way, the same frequency is reused in the same geographic region to
deliver greater amounts of data traﬃc than could be expected from a single
transmitting and receiving antenna (SISO) system. Some MIMO systems also
have the ability to learn to suppress interference from unrelated transmitters,
further enhancing network performance. These MIMO techniques are practi-
cal when suﬃcient space for mounting antennas on the radio or platform are
available.
1.2.5 Spectrum Subleasing, Sharing
In dense urban applications, there is opportunity to sublease spectrum from
spectrum owners whose loading is temporarily light. Such owners can deﬁne
access rules, and economics of such transactions, as well as rules to take back
spectrum should demand or emergency arise. SDR Forum, IEEE, and others
are working to establish standardized protocols to enable such transactions.
For lightly loaded system, spectrum owners may be able to recover up to 60%
of the cost of spectrum ownership in this fashion. In the public safety market,
there have been discussions that some organizations might pay for new public
safety infrastructure in exchange for shared spectrum access on a guaranteed
non-interfering basis. This clearly shows just how valuable the spectrum is.
In rural applications, there has been discussion of using the relatively
unused rural UHF TV broadcast bands for adhoc/mesh networks to de-
liver internet and other data services. Protocols to assure non-interference
are currently under evaluation. However, concern from TV broadcasters that
such techniques will eventually cause interference to broadcast TV, at the
rural–suburban boundaries where such wireless networks will fail to recognize
presence of the TV signal, or where local area networks may deliver spotty
performance. Given that much of rural areas are served by S Band satellite
TV, it is not clear what long range outcome of this debate will be.
Policy Assurance of Behavior to the Economic Stakeholders
Several signiﬁcant studies have been performed on the economics of dynami-
cally adaptive spectrum.7 However, this work has also generated a great deal
of concern, on the part of regulators, network operators, and spectrum owners.
It is therefore important to understand the basic architecture of a cognitive
radio. As shown in Fig. 1.1, a cognitive radio must include a variety of sensors,
many of which support the user, a learning capability (possibly accomplished
remotely), and a set of rules based on a policy engine which allow and disal-
low actions. It is the job of the policy engine, to deﬁne inviolable rules and
behaviors of each stakeholder. Each stakeholder’s rules will be expressed as
7 “Software Radio: Implications for Wireless Services, Industry Structure, and
Public Policy,” W. Lehr, S. Gillett, F. Merino, Communications and Strategies,

Fig. 1.1. Architecture of a cognitive radio. Figure 1.1 includes a cognitive
function to analyze existing spectrum users, and measure properties of its own com-
munication channels, and a set of rules expressed through a policy engine which
deﬁne what the radio is allowed to do, and what it is not allowed to do.8
policies: policies for the regulator, for the spectrum owner, for the network
operator, for the manufacturer, and for the user.
While policy engine languages are now a subject of R&D development
throughout the industry, and in SDR Forum in particular, notionally, each
policy engine must perform an analysis of actions proposed by the radio’s
cognitive engine, and must determine that the proposed action is allowed
by at least one rule, and that the action is not disallowed by any rules. All
actions which are allowed by the policy engine may then be compared and
contrasted for spectrum eﬃciency, interference, quality of service and battery
drain considerations, and the best choices applied. For example, if the cogni-
tive engine were to propose that idle spectrum is available for a telephone call
at 107.9 MHz, using a CDMA waveform, and a Universal Mobile Telecommu-
nications System (UMTS) protocol, transmitting to close a link over 5 km, in
Alamogordo, New Mexico, at 0.5 W, the policy engine will examine whether
the user is entitled to perform that function at that frequency with that wave-
form, at that location and that power level. There must be one rule that allows
it, and no rules that disallow it before the radio can implement the proposed
adaptation. In this example, we assume that a regulatory policy would disal-
low use of an FM broadcast frequency within the continental U.S. for telecom-
munications applications, but it might be allowable in countries where there
is no FM band broadcast activity. Thus the policy engines will disallow all
8 Cognitive Radio Technologies, Chapter 7, Rondeau & Bostian, edited by B. Fette,
Newnes 2006.

10
Bruce Fette
behaviors not in keeping with all stakeholders. Similarly, the network opera-
tor, spectrum owner, and user may all have various policy expressions, and
each must approve before the radio would execute the mode.
A policy engine is an eﬃcient encoding of these rules, but most impor-
tantly, an eﬃcient method for managing radio functionality across the entire
globe. If the location of the radio changes, then the radio can look up the
rules for its new location. If the rules in a certain country change in order to
allow a new capability, then an update of the policy database can allow the
radio to perform new capabilities. Therefore, a cognitive radio will not learn
or perform unacceptable behaviors, because those behaviors will be disallowed
by the policy engine.
A very important consideration is that changes of policy must be pre-
validated to assure reliable and stable performance under both reasonable
and unreasonable conditions and must be administered by those trusted to
distribute policies. Thus, the stakeholders must place their trust in the policy
engines to enforce the rules of behavior, etiquette, and protocol to assure their
participation in the revenue stream.
Value of Spectrum to the Stakeholders
“Spectrum is the lifeblood of communication systems.”9 Without spectrum,
there is no electromagnetic communications. Many signiﬁcant papers have ad-
dressed the value of spectrum. Each country has deﬁned diﬀerent mechanisms
to assess and manage spectrum, radio production and use of spectrum, and
the associated revenue. Some countries have recognized spectrum as publicly
owned, and a value to be shared by all. In such a regulatory environment,
spectrum should be used for the greatest public value. As such the primary
issue is to prioritize current needs and grant access to spectrum best matched
to most valued public need (higher frequencies to shorter range applications,
etc.).
In the United States, and in many other countries, spectrum access is a
source of federal government revenue. However, costs of spectrum auction are
passed on to users as an increase in cost of services with incremental overheads
of all participants in the value chain. In the United States it is assumed that
the free market forces will assure that spectrum access, as a result of spectrum
auction, will result in greatest cost eﬀectiveness use of valuable spectrum.
Since July 1994, the FCC has conducted 33 spectrum auctions raising
over $40 billion.10 European auctions conducted in 2000 raised nearly $100
billion. Clearly the value of a spectrum license depends on many dimensions,
including:

1. amount of bandwidth in MHz (directly related to the ability to service as
many subscribers as possible, number of subscribers within the service
region;
2. demand within the service region;
3. duration of the contract;
4. opportunity for growth of services within the service region and:
5. cost of installing and providing service. As a calibration, auctions of 2×10
MHz (paired spectrum) +5 MHz (unpaired Spectrum) range from $2.60
per subscriber per year to $107.20 per subscriber per year.
Network operators provide a rough guideline of cost of spectrum access
versus cost of subscriber equipment. In the United States, one network oper-
ator reported that the subscriber pays approximately twice as much per year
for the subscriber equipment as he pays for the spectrum. In Europe, one
operator indicated that the subscriber pays approximately twice as much for
the spectrum, as he pays for the subscriber equipment. While such numbers
are not published, we can consider spectrum access to range between 50% and
200% of the cost of subscriber equipment as a guideline.
In Fig. 1.2, Forward Concepts presents the 2006 handset revenue by wave-
form/protocol type. It is clear that the global telecommunications market
uses more than 11 protocols, and that the total subscriber hardware market
is $130B (1.3 × 1011). So we can project that spectrum access ranges between
$65B and $260B in yearly cost to subscribers. So very clearly, the subscriber
and the network operator have much to gain in lowering spectrum access costs.
We can also conclude that one radio design capable of supporting 11 proto-
cols, knowing which country to use them in, and how to register for access
would support global requirements.
This shows a clear and signiﬁcant value of spectrum to enable valuable
applications. It also reﬂects a cost to the user, which will be paid with interest
over the lifetime of the license, and a future revenue stream opportunity to
the operator that acquires the spectrum.
Spectrum owners consist of many communities, each with diﬀerent inter-
ests such as AM, FM, and TV broadcast operators, Federal State and Local
public services (police, ﬁre, FAA, FBI, etc.), Telecommunications network op-
erators (cellular phone providers), the Department of Defense (Army, Navy
Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, others), and dispatch service providers (taxi,
UPS, FED X, etc.). There are also spectrum users which are authorized by
a license passed through the manufacturer to private citizens to use or as a
public commons (Citizens band, Family Radio Service, WiFi, UWB, etc.).
Existing spectrum owners are understandably reluctant to give up spectrum
regardless of whether it is used or unused for public good, while advocates
of cognitive radio argue that unused spectrum can be put to productive use
without impacting primary existing users.
Much has been published about the distribution of spectral activity. How-
ever, there is a very clear trend. Between 1% and 15% of the spectrum is busy,

depending on what location the measurement is made in, what frequency the
measurement is made at, and over how much time, frequency and geographic
space the averaging is performed.11 The implication is that while spectrum
owners have paid dearly to own these time–frequency–space spectrum blocks,
it is not put to 100% utilization. Nor would we necessarily want it to be fully
utilized. In order to accommodate peak needs, and instant access, we must
retain reserve capacity somehow. How much reserve capacity should be re-
tained to accommodate peaking? This is a function of localized statistics,

1.2.6 Local Statistics
The Bell Telephone Company did extensive studies of call capacity and block-
ing probability on circuit switched telephony in the 1940s and 1950s, deﬁning
a unit of call bandwidth as an Erlang. In this work, the probability of dropped,
lost, or blocked call decreases as the ratio of capacity to average demand in-
creases. Their goal was to keep call blocking probability under 1% across each
management region. In this case, the only resort beyond use of the full capac-
ity of all existing trunk lines was to install more trunk lines – an unacceptably
long access latency for unexpected peak capacity requirements. In these sys-
tems, normal daily peak utilization is about 30% of peak capacity (Mother’s
Day peak utilization usually exceeds capacity).
In today’s modern age, cellular telephony operates with a somewhat higher
ratio of average daily peak utilization to peak capacity. However, cellular
systems have interesting local statistics. Airports have very high capacity
requirements, and experience huge peaks as a consequence of delayed ﬂights.
Sports stadiums have extremes of peak to average traﬃc ratio, with the end
of game resulting in very high peaks in traﬃc. Finally, traﬃc jams are also a
source of high peak to average call ratios.
1.2.7 Peaking Support
Capacity to support a demand peak can be provided in many diﬀerent ways.
In the context of cellular telephony, additional demand can be supported by
other nearby base stations until all channel capacity of all nearby base sta-
tions has also been consumed. In the context of laptop computers performing
internet data access, additional demand is supported by reducing the avail-
able throughput support to all subscribers. In the case of FM broadcast, new
capacity is being added as FM broadcasters add DAB subcarriers thereby of-
fering new audio and data services. Where do police, ﬁre, and other emergency
departments get additional capacity? Within urban jurisdictions, they plan
additional capacity for likely peak events such as emergencies. However, if the
scope of an emergency exceeds the planned peak capacity, there is generally
not any method to access additional spectrum. This occurred in both New
York City and Washington D.C. on September 11, 2001. In remote regions,
peaking capacity for emergencies (such as in rural Montana, rural Arizona,
and rural Texas) is often supplied by cellular telephony if available, or by
satellite transponder. It usually takes a few days to lease, deliver, and install
the satellite transponder base station equipment.
1.2.8 Spectrum Leasing
Spectrum leasing is a way to support demand peaking, such that the ratio
of the average utilization to peak capacity can be higher. In this scenario,

14
Bruce Fette
multiple services either sublease from a spectrum owner for a time-frequency-
spatial block, or owners cross license their current unused capacity to each
other giving each the opportunity to support demand peak, or to prioritize
access to spectrum depending on greatest public need.
At least one serious business proposal has been made to set up a spectrum
leasing business. However, as of this time, no cellular subscriber equipment has
the ﬂexibility of frequency, waveform and protocol to accommodate varying
spectral assignment, nor have industry accepted protocols been adopted to
perform these transactions.
1.2.9 Spectrum Awareness Databases
Many radios can capture their local view of spectrum activity, position, and
time. That information can be directly shared. It can also be aggregated into a
regional database, that provides for awareness of local emitters, local policies,
and knowledge of areas where signal dropouts are likely, resulting in radio
performance predictions. One such data structure, developed by Zhao and
Le is called a Radio Environment Map (REM). Such a database can be a
signiﬁcant aid to cognitive radios both in time to locate and allocate unused
spectrum to a speciﬁc purpose, and time to acquire the policies of network
access for local services.
1.2.10 Value of Concierge Services
Densely populated and popular urban areas lend themselves to concierge ser-
vices. Tourists and business travellers can create signiﬁcant demand because
they are unfamiliar with local services. This is why major hotels have concierge
desks to provide assistance with local arrangements. Concierge desks are of-
ten required to function around the clock. However, visitors may be unwilling
or unable to use the local concierge service because of language barriers or
unavailability of the identiﬁed need.
One company has been successfully selling concierge services as an inter-
net service, and reports $77M/year revenues.12 Another reports combining
concierge services with telematics, location, and vehicle tracking as a suc-
cessful business.13 A third company reports the global concierge Ecommerce
business as $12B/year with a 30% compound annual growth rate, and have
established a monthly fee structure to test the market.14 Frost and Sullivan has
a market report focused speciﬁcally on telematics (concierge services focused
speciﬁcally on luxury car owners). Their report, in short, indicates that of
250M cars on the road in the US, 30M are telematics capable, and 10M
actually use the service. That service is reported as a $1.3B/year market.

With attention to convergence of voice and data services, this could easily
grow from 30% market acceptance to a far larger market.
From this we conclude that making the radio suﬃciently location and
position aware to be able to assist in concierge services for the radio user
has a signiﬁcant international value to the users, and to the value added
service providers, and is a cognitive radio market immediately serviceable
with existing technology.
1.2.11 Cognition
Learning is a signiﬁcant part of cognitive radio research. Rondeau and Bostian
have studied the use of Genetic Algorithm (GA) to learn how a radio might
best respond to a spectral environment given a set of objective metrics. They
have developed prototypes that show that a radio can successfully learn proper
adaptions to a spectral environment that optimize for the objective metrics.
Neel and Reed have studied how to apply game theory to a radio as a member
of a cognitive network. With game theory they were able to analyze protocols
to determine whether cognitive radio behavior could result in stable network
behavior, and they conclude that it can. Mitola, Kokar, and Kovarik have
independently studied knowledge representation (Ontology) that a cognitive
radio would need to perform reasoning functions. Mitola proposes that a radio
should be able to reason about the owner’s voice and visual characteristics,
should be able to take verbal commands, should be able to visually recognize
locations and conditions. Kovarik describes the diﬃculty of building a suﬃ-
ciently large information database that a radio would be usefully intelligent
to be able to reason over any but the narrowest range of topics. Mitola con-
cludes that narrow ﬁelds of human activity can be captured with suﬃcient
depth of knowledge representation to be useful. Thus niche markets will de-
velop by creating a deep representation of requirements for speciﬁc services.
Where these can be brought forward as an economically successful business,
we will see new products and services oﬀered even before general cognition is
practical in a radio.
Radios that have learned or adapted to local spectrum, channel, waveform,
or protocol conditions can share their learning with other radios that have
not yet learned these local optimizations. This learning can be infused to
other radios via a network database which provides local optimization, or it
can be shared directly from radio to radio. Since network operators correctly
worry that the network behavior be stable, and predictable, and within FCC
guidelines, it is most appropriate that learned behaviors be shared from a
database, where they can be checked, and validated as producing a net beneﬁt
to the network before being used. It seems that the Radio Environment Map
is an example of a method for providing such services.
Thus we conclude that cognition can be local to the radio, or can be
served as a download of knowledge structures (or software) from other radios
which have performed the learning and now make it available. Market studies

16
Bruce Fette
have not yet characterized the value of cognitive radio learning technology.
However, if learning to use spectrum wisely is an example, it will be very
valuable.
1.3 Summary
In summary, we conclude that Cognitive Radio technology is a way in which
one radio or even a network of radios are able to learn a useful degree of
adaptivity, that aids the user, the network, and/or the spectrum owner. There
are powerful economic incentives to provide new capabilities, through exist-
ing telecommunications infrastructure, and cognitive radios will provide those
capabilities. As new services are oﬀered, more spectrum will be needed and
cognitive radios will provide the means for radios to communicate with greater
spectrum eﬃciency.

2.1 Introduction
Current data networking technology limits a network’s ability to adapt, of-
ten resulting in sub-optimal performance. Limited in state, scope, and re-
sponse mechanisms, the network elements (consisting of nodes, protocol layers,
policies, and behaviors) are unable to make intelligent adaptations. Communi-
cation of network state information is stiﬂed by the layered protocol architec-
ture, making individual elements unaware of the network status experienced
by other elements. Any response that an element may make to network stimuli
can only be made in the context of its limited scope. The adaptations that are
performed are typically reactive, taking place after a problem has occurred.
In this chapter, we advance the idea of cognitive networks, which have the
promise to remove these limitations by allowing networks to observe, act, and
learn in order to optimize their performance.
Cognitive networks are motivated by complexity. Particularly in wireless
networks, there has been a trend towards increasingly complex, heterogeneous,
and dynamic environments. While wired networks can also take on any of
these characteristics (and are not excluded from potential cognitive network
applications) wireless networks are a natural target because of their inter-node
interactions and the size of their system state space. Previous research into
cognitive radio and cross-layer design have addressed some of these issues but
have shortcomings from the network perspective. Cognitive networks represent
a new scope and approach to dealing with this complexity.
This chapter provides the reader with a primer on the cognitive network
concept, as envisioned by the authors. It begins by explaining the need for
cognitive networks, how they are deﬁned, and possible applications for the
technology. Then the chapter examines how cognitive networks are related

to, but distinct from, previous work in cognitive radios and cross-layer de-
sign. A practical discussion of the implementation of a cognitive network and
important areas of future work close the chapter.
2.1.1 Deﬁnition
Cognitive networks were ﬁrst described by us in [1] as
. . . a network with a cognitive process that can perceive current net-
work conditions, and then plan, decide and act on those conditions.
The network can learn from these adaptations and use them to make
future decisions, all while taking into account end-to-end goals.
The cognitive aspect of this deﬁnition is similar to that used to describe
cognitive radio and broadly encompasses many simple models of cognition
and learning. More critical to the deﬁnition are the network and end-to-end
aspects. Without the network and end-to-end scope, the system is perhaps
a cognitive radio or layer, but not a cognitive network. Here, end-to-end de-
notes all the network elements involved in the transmission of a data ﬂow.
For a unicast transmission, this might include such elements as subnets,
routers, switches, virtual connections, encryption schemes, mediums, inter-
faces, and waveforms. The end-to-end goals are what give a cognitive network
its network-wide scope, separating it from other adaptation approaches, which
have only a local, single element scope.
2.1.2 Motivation and Requirements
The overall goal of any technology is that it meet some need in the best way
possible for the least cost. With the ﬁrst half of this goal in mind, a cognitive
network should provide, over an extended period of time, better end-to-end
performance than a non-cognitive network. Cognition can be used to improve
such end-to-end objectives as resource management, Quality of Service (QoS),
security, access control, or throughput. Cognitive networks are only limited in
application by the adaptability of the underlying network elements and the
ﬂexibility of the cognitive process.
In examining the second half of the goal, the cost must justify the per-
formance. Cognitive network costs are measured in terms of communications
and processing overhead, architecture roll-out and maintenance expenses, and
operational complexity. These costs must be outweighed by the performance
improvement the cognitive network provides. For certain environments, such
as static wired networks with predictable behavior, it may not make sense
to convert to cognitive operation. Other environments, such as heterogeneous
wireless networks, may be ideal candidates for cognition.
Cognitive networks should use observations (or proxy observations) of
network performance as input to a decision making process and then pro-
vide output in the form of a set of actions that can be implemented in the

2 Cognitive Networks
19
modiﬁable elements of the networks. Ideally, a cognitive network should be
forward-looking, rather than reactive, and attempt to adjust to problems be-
fore they occur. Additionally, the architecture of a cognitive network should
be extensible and ﬂexible, supporting future improvements, network elements,
and goals.
Cognitive networks require a Software Adaptable Network (SAN) to im-
plement the actual network functionality and allow the cognitive process to
adapt the network. Similarly to cognitive radio, which depends on a Software
Deﬁne Radio (SDR) to modify aspects of radio operation (e.g. time, frequency,
bandwidth, code, spatiality, waveform), a SAN depends on a network that has
one or more modiﬁable elements. Practically, this means that a network must
be able to modify one or several layers of the network stack in its member
nodes. A simple example of a SAN could be a wireless network with direc-
tional antennas (antennas with the ability to direct their maximum receive or
transmit gain to various points of rotation). A more complex example would
incorporate more modiﬁable aspects at various layers of the protocol stack,
such as Medium Access Control (MAC) algorithms or routing control.
2.1.3 A Simple Example
As an example of the need for end-to-end rather than just link adaptations,
consider an ad-hoc data session between a source node, S1, and a destina-
tion node, D1, as shown in Figure 2.1. The source node must route traﬃc
through intermediate nodes R1 and R2 acting as regenerative relays. Node
S1 performs a link adaptation by choosing the relay node based on the set of
minimum hop routes to D1 and the probability of link outage. For this simple
network, nodes R1 and R2 are both in the set of minimum hop relays on routes
to D1. Therefore, node S1 selects the link on which to transmit by observing
the outage probabilities on the links to R1 and R2 and selecting the link with
the lower outage probability. From the standpoint of the link layer in node S1,
this guarantees that the transmitted packets have the highest probability of

arriving correctly at the relay node. However, it does not guarantee anything
about the end-to-end performance, i.e. the total outage probability from S1
to D1.
In contrast to the link adaptation, the cognitive network uses observations
from all nodes to compute the total path outage probabilities from S1 to
D1 through R1 and R2. This shows the beneﬁt of a more global view as
well as another advantage to the cognitive network, the learning capability.
Suppose that the learning mechanism measures throughput from the source
to its destination in order to judge the eﬀectiveness of previous decisions,
and suppose that nodes S1 and S2 are both routing their traﬃc through R2
because this satisﬁes the minimum outage probability objective.
Now suppose that R2 becomes congested because of a large volume of
traﬃc coming from S2. This becomes apparent to the cognitive process in
the throughput reported by S1 and S2, though the cognitive process is not
explicitly aware of the congestion. Nevertheless, it is able to infer from the
reduced throughput and its past experiences that there may be a problem.
The cognitive process is then able to respond to the congestion, perhaps by
routing traﬃc through R1 and/or R3. This example illustrates the potential of
cognitive networks in optimizing end-to-end performance as well as reacting
to unforeseen circumstances. The cognitive network goes beyond the purely
algorithmic approach of the underlying routing protocol and ﬁnds eﬃcient
operating points even when unexpected events occur.
2.2 Foundations and Related Work
Having deﬁned a cognitive network, it is helpful to review some existing
research areas that are related to the cognitive network concept. We take
a look at two areas in particular, cognitive radio and cross-layer design.
2.2.1 Cognitive Radio
Shared Attributes with Cognitive Networks
The 50% correlation in nomenclature would itself imply some degree of com-
monality, and it can certainly be argued that research in cognitive radio has
sparked the formulation of the cognitive network concept. What cognitive ra-
dios and cognitive networks do share is the cognitive process that is the heart
of the performance optimizations. An essential part of the cognitive process
is the capability to learn from past decisions and use this learning to inﬂu-
ence future behavior. Both are goal-driven and rely on observations paired
with knowledge of node capabilities to reach decisions. Knowledge in cogni-
tive radio is contained within a modeling language such as Radio Knowledge

2 Cognitive Networks
21
Representation Language (RKRL) [2]. A network-level equivalent must exist
for the cognitive network to be goal oriented and achieve context awareness,
two attributes that it shares with a cognitive radio.
A cognitive radio requires tunable parameters which deﬁne the optimiza-
tion space of the cognitive process. These tunable parameters are ideally pro-
vided by an SDR. The concept of the SAN is the cognitive network analog of
SDR. Therefore, both technologies employ a software tunable platform that
is controlled by the cognitive process.
Diﬀerences from Cognitive Networks
Cognitive networks are clearly delineated from cognitive radios by the scope
of the controlling goals. Goals in a cognitive network are based on end-to-end
network performance, whereas cognitive radio goals are localized only to the
radio’s user. These end-to-end goals are derived at run-time from operators,
users, applications, and resource requirements in addition to any design-time
goals. This diﬀerence in goal scope from local to end-to-end enables the cog-
nitive network to operate more easily across all layers of the protocol stack.
Current research in cognitive radio emphasizes interactions with the physical
layer, which limits the direct impact of changes made by the cognitive process
to the radio itself and other radios to which it is directly linked or with which
it may interfere. Agreement with other radios on parameters that must match
for successful link communication is reached through a process of negotiation.
Since changes in protocol layers above the physical layer tend to impact more
nodes in the network, the cognitive radio negotiation process would have to be
expanded to include all nodes impacted by the change. However, because the
negotiation process is unable to assign precedence to radios’ desires without
goals of a broader scope, achieving agreement among multiple nodes may be a
slow process. For the same reason, the compromise can be expected to result
in sub-optimal network performance. In contrast, whether the network com-
ponents are acting in a cooperative or selﬁsh manner, all cognitive network
actions are referenced back to the end-to-end network goals.
Another signiﬁcant diﬀerence between cognitive radios and cognitive net-
works is the degree of heterogeneity that is supported. Cognitive networks
are applicable to both wired and wireless networks whereas cognitive radios
are only used in wireless networks. Since the cognitive network may span
wired and wireless mediums, it is useful for optimizing performance for these
heterogeneous types of networks, which are generally diﬃcult to integrate.
The fact that a cognitive network is composed of multiple nodes also adds
a degree of freedom in how the cognitive processing is performed compared
to cognitive radio. A cognitive network has the option to implement a fully
distributed, partially distributed, or centralized cognitive process.

22
Ryan W. Thomas et al.
2.2.2 Cross-layer Design
Shared Attributes with Cross-layer Design
Designs that violate the traditional layered approach by direct communica-
tion between non-adjacent layers or sharing of internal information between
layers are called cross-layer designs [3]. Cognitive networks indirectly share in-
formation that is not available externally in the strictly layered architecture.
Therefore, cognitive networks do implement cross-layer designs.
The common theme between these two concepts is that in both,
observations are made available for adaptations at layers other than the
layer providing the observation. In a cognitive network, protocol layers pro-
vide observations of current conditions to the cognitive process. The cognitive
process then determines what is optimal for the network and changes the
conﬁgurations of network elements’ protocol stacks.
Diﬀerences from Cross-layer Design
Despite similarities, cognitive networks reach far beyond the scope of cross-
layer designs. The cognitive network can support trade-oﬀs between multiple
goals and in order to do so performs Multiple Objective Optimization (MOO),
whereas cross-layer designs typically perform single objective optimizations.
Cross-layer designs perform independent optimizations that do not account
for the network-wide performance goals. Trying to achieve each goal indepen-
dently is likely to be sub-optimal, and as the number of cross-layer designs
within a node grows, conﬂicts between the independent adaptations may lead
to adaptation loops [4]. This pitfall is avoided in a cognitive network by jointly
considering all goals in the optimization process.
The ability to learn is another signiﬁcant diﬀerence. The cognitive network
learns from prior decisions and applies the learning to future decisions. Cross-
layer designs are memoryless adaptations that will respond the same way
when presented with the same set of inputs, regardless of how poorly the
adaptation may have performed in the past. The ability to learn from past
behavior is particularly important in light of the fact that our understanding
of the interaction between layers is limited.
Finally, like cognitive radio, the scope of the goals and observations sets
cognitive networks apart from cross-layer design. The observations used by
the cognitive process span multiple nodes and the optimization is performed
with the goals of all nodes in mind, whereas cross-layer design is node-centric.
This global information allows the cognitive process to adapt in ways that
simply are not possible when nodes have limited visibility into the state of
other nodes in the network, as is the case with cross-layer design.
2.2.3 Recent Work
The concept of a cognitive networks is an emerging research ﬁeld. The idea
of adding cognition to a network has in the past been reserved for individual

2 Cognitive Networks
23
aspects of the network, such as “smart” antennas or “smart” packets. All this
changed with the introduction of the cognitive radio by Mitola in [2]. His
concept of putting intelligence into radio operation caught the imagination
and attention of the research community. Eventually the concept worked its
way from radios into the larger network.
Recent research can be divided into two categories: cognitive radio net-
works and cognitive networks. In the ﬁrst category, we begin with work from
Mitola and his original thesis on cognitive radio. Here, he mentions how
cognitive radios could interact within the system-level scope of a cognitive
network [2]. Neel continues this line of thinking in [5], where he investigates
modeling networks of cognitive radios as a large, multiplayer game to deter-
mine convergent conditions. This kind of thinking is also observed in Haykin’s
paper on cognitive radio [6], where he examines multiuser networks of cogni-
tive radios as a game.
The focus of cognitive radio networks, as with cognitive radios, is primar-
ily on MAC and physical (PHY) layer issues, but now operating with some
end-to-end objective. In a cognitive radio network, the individual radios still
make most of the cognitive decisions, although they may act in a cooperative
manner. Currently suggested applications for cognitive radio networks include
cooperative spectrum sensing [7,8] and emergency radio networks [9]. From a
more general perspective, Raychaudhuri et al. [10] present an architecture for
cognitive radio networks.
Perhaps the ﬁrst mention of a cognitive network rather than a cognitive
radio network comes from Clark et al. [11]. Clark proposes a network that can
assemble itself given high level instructions, reassemble itself as
requirements change, automatically discover when something goes
wrong, and automatically ﬁx a detected problem or explain why it
cannot do so.
According to Clark, this would be accomplished with the use of a Knowl-
edge Plane (KP) that transcends layers and domains to make cognitive
decisions about the network. The KP will add intelligence and weight to
the edges of the network, and context sensitivity to its core. Saracco also
observed these trends in his investigation into the future of information tech-
nology [12], postulating that the change from network intelligence control-
ling resources to having context sensitivity will help “ﬂatten” the network by
moving network intelligence into the core and control further out to the edges
of the network.
Cognitive networks diﬀer from cognitive radio networks in that the
action space of the former extends beyond the MAC and PHY layers and
the network may consist of more than just wireless devices. Furthermore,
cognitive networks may be less autonomous than a cognitive radio network,
with the network elements cooperating to achieve goals, using a centralized
cognitive process or a parallelized process that runs across several of the net-
work elements. However, despite these diﬀerences, the deﬁnition of cognitive

24
Ryan W. Thomas et al.
networks given in Section 2.1.1 encompasses both cognitive radio networks
and cognitive entworks.
More recently, M¨ah¨onen discusses cognitive networks in the context of
future Internet Protocol (IP) networks and cognitive trends in a series of
papers. In his earliest paper, he discusses cognitive networks with respect
to future mobile IP networks, arguing that the context sensitivity of these
networks could have as interesting an application as cognitive radios [13]. He
then examines cognitive networks as part of a larger paper on cognitive trends
[14]. He discusses how cognitive radios may be just a logical subset of cognitive
networks. He also brings up the idea of a Network Knowledge Representation
Language (NKRL) to express and communicate high-level goals and policies.
Several research groups have proposed cognitive network-like architectures.
These architectures can be categorized into two objectives: the ﬁrst centers on
using cognition to aid in the operation and maintenance of the network, while
the second centers on cognition to solve “hard” problems, problems that do
not have a feasible solution other than the use of cognition.
Falling into the ﬁrst category, the End-to-End Reconﬁgurability Project II
(E2R II) [15] is designing an architecture that will allow the seamless recon-
ﬁguration of a network in order to allow for universal end-to-end connectivity.
Although E2R II is an ambitious project with many facets, the overarching
goal is one of maintaining connectivity to the user. This is similar to the
goal of the m@ANGEL platform [16], which attempts to provide an cogni-
tive network-like architecture for mobility management in a heterogeneous
network. Both of these architectures are focused on the operation and main-
tenance of 4G cellular and wireless networks.
In contrast, the Center for Telecommunications Value-Chain Research
(CTVR) at Trinity College [17] has presented a proposal for a cognitive net-
work platform that consists of reconﬁgurable wireless nodes. Although focused
on wireless operation, these nodes are able to solve a variety of problems by
modifying or changing the network stack based on observed network behav-
iors. The possible objectives of these networks can extend beyond mobility
management and connectivity. Similar to the CTVR work but less depen-
dent on the wireless focus, M¨ah¨onen proposes a general architecture utilizing
a collaborative Cognitive Resource Manager (CRM) that provides cognitive
behavior from a toolbox of machine learning tools such as neural networks,
clustering, coloring, genetic algorithms, and simulated annealing. The work in
this chapter describes also falls under this objective, attempting to provide a
general cognitive architecture capable of solving a variety of hard problems,
rather than being tied to network operation issues.
2.3 Implementation
In order to synthesize the preceding concepts and components into an
actual cognitive network, we investigate how a cognitive network should

2 Cognitive Networks
25
be implemented. We construct a framework for the cognitive process and
identify the critical features of this architecture.
A common model of cognition is the three-level theory [18]. The model is
often summarized as consisting of behavioral, functional, and physical layers.
The behavioral level determines what observable actions the system produces,
the functional layer determines how the system processes the information
provided to it, and the physical layer comprises the neuro-physiology of the
system.
From this concept, we draw a three-layer framework, with each layer
roughly corresponding to the layers in the model described above. At the
top layer are the goals of the system and elements in the network that deﬁne
the behavior of the system. These goals feed into the cognitive process, which
computes the actions the system takes. The SAN is the physical control of the
system, providing the action space for the cognitive process. This framework
is illustrated in Figure 2.2.
In our framework, we consider a cognitive process which consists of one or
more cognitive elements, operating in some degree between selﬁsh autonomy
and full cooperation. If there is a single cognitive element, it may still be
physically distributed over one or more nodes in the network. If there are
multiple elements, they may be distributed over a subset of the nodes in the
network, on every node in the network, or several cognitive elements may
reside on a single node. In this respect, the cognitive elements operate in a
manner similar to software agents.

2.3.1 User/Application/Resource Requirements
The top-level component of the cognitive network framework includes the
end-to-end goals, Cognitive Speciﬁcation Language (CSL) and cognitive
element goals. Without end-to-end goals guiding network behavior, undesired
consequences may arise. For instance, optimizing a network element without
an end-to-end scope can cause a negative eﬀect on the performance elsewhere
in the network or node. This is a problem with many cross-layer designs
and is explored in some depth in [4], which illustrates unintended end-to-end
interactions in a MAC/PHY cross-layer design.
Like most engineering problems, there is likely to be a trade-oﬀfor every
goal optimized on. When a cognitive network has multiple objectives it will
not be able to optimize all metrics indeﬁnitely, eventually reaching a point at
which one metric cannot be improved without adversely aﬀecting another. In
order to determine this Pareto optimal front (the set of actions from which
no goal can be improved without worsening another), each cognitive element
must have an understanding of all end-to-end goals and their constraints.
To connect the goals of the top-level users of the network to the cognitive
process, an interface layer must be developed. In a cognitive network, this role
is performed by the CSL, providing behavioral guidance to the elements by
translating the end-to-end goals to local element goals. Less like the RKRL
proposed by Mitola for cognitive radio and more like a QoS speciﬁcation lan-
guage [19], the CSL maps end-to-end requirements to underlying mechanisms.
Unlike a QoS speciﬁcation language, the mechanisms are adaptive to the net-
work capabilities, as opposed to ﬁxed. Furthermore, a CSL must be able to
adapt to new network elements, applications, and goals, some of which may
not even be imagined yet. Other requirements may include support for distrib-
uted or centralized operation, including the sharing of data between multiple
cognitive elements.
The scope of the cognitive network is broader than that of the individ-
ual network elements; it operates within the scope of a data ﬂow, which may
include many network elements. For a distributed cognitive process, the cog-
nitive elements associated with each ﬂow or network element may act selﬁshly
and independently (in the context of the entire network) to achieve local goals,
or act in an altruistic manner to achieve network-wide goals. The job of con-
verting the end-to-end goals to these local element goals is often a diﬃcult
problem.
2.3.2 Cognitive Process
There does not seem to be a common, accepted deﬁnition of what cognition
means when applied to communication technologies. The term cognitive, as
used by this chapter, follows closely in the footsteps of the deﬁnition used by

2 Cognitive Networks
27
Mitola in [2] and the even broader deﬁnition of the FCC. The former incorpo-
rates a spectrum of cognitive behaviors, from goal-based decisions to proac-
tive adaptation. Here, we associate cognition with machine learning, which
is broadly deﬁned in [20] as any algorithm that “improves its performance
through experience gained over a period of time without complete informa-
tion about the environment in which it operates.” Underneath this deﬁnition,
many diﬀerent kinds of artiﬁcial intelligence, decision making, and adaptive
algorithms can be placed, giving cognitive networks a wide scope of possible
mechanisms to use for learning.
Learning serves to complement the objective optimization part of the cog-
nitive process by retaining the eﬀectiveness of past decisions under a given
set of conditions. Determining the eﬀectiveness of past decisions requires a
feedback loop to measure the success of the chosen solution in meeting the
objectives deﬁned. This is retained in memory so that when similar circum-
stances are encountered in the future, the cognitive process will have some
idea of where to start or what to avoid.
The eﬀect of a cognitive process’s decisions on the network performance
depends on the amount of network state information available to it. In order
for a cognitive network to make a decision based on end-to-end goals, the
cognitive elements must have some knowledge of the network’s current state
and other cognitive element states. If a cognitive network has knowledge of
the entire network’s state, decisions at the cognitive element level should be at
least as good, if not better (in terms of the cognitive element goals) than those
made in ignorance. For a large, complex system such as a computer network,
it is unlikely that the cognitive network would know the total system state.
There is often a high cost to communicate this information beyond those
network elements requiring it, meaning a cognitive network will have to work
with less than a full picture of the network status.
Filtering and abstraction may be used to further reduce the amount of in-
formation that must be exchanged and to avoid unnecessary triggering of the
cognitive process. Filtering means that observations made by the node may be
held back from the cognitive process if they are deemed irrelevant. Thus, the
nodes themselves make some determination of what is important to the cog-
nitive process. Filtering rules may be identiﬁed at design time with additional
rules speciﬁed in real-time as the cognitive process determines its sensitivity
to various types of observations and disseminates ﬁltering rules accordingly.
The goal of abstraction is to reduce the number of bits required to represent
an observation. Observations or collections of observations made by a node are
reported to the cognitive process at a higher level of abstraction than what is
available within the node. Abstractions may also be speciﬁed at design time
with real-time adaptations by the cognitive process. The reductionism result-
ing from ﬁltering and abstraction carries risk because it may mask information
that the cognitive process needs to operate correctly. Therefore, care should
be taken in deﬁning the abstractions or ﬁltering.

2.3.3 Software Adaptable Network
The SAN consists of the Application Programming Interface (API), modiﬁable
network elements, and network status sensors. The SAN is really a separate
research area, just as the design of the SDR is separate from the development
of the cognitive radio, but at a minimum the cognitive process needs to be
aware of the API and the interface it presents to the modiﬁable elements.
Just like the other aspects of the framework, the API should be ﬂexible and
extensible. Continuing the analogy with SDKs, an existing system that is
analogous to the API is the Software Communications Architecture (SCA)
used in the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS).
Another responsibility of the SAN is to notify the cognitive process of the
status of the network (to what level and detail is a function of the ﬁltering
and abstraction being applied). The status of the network is the source of
the feedback used by the cognitive process, and is composed of status sen-
sor observations and communication with other cognitive elements. Possible
observations may be local, such as bit error rate, battery life or data rate,
non-local, such as end-to-end delay and clique size, or compilations of diﬀer-
ent local observations.
The modiﬁable elements can include any object or element used in a net-
work, although it is unlikely that all elements in a SAN would be modiﬁable.
Each modiﬁable element should have public and private interfaces to the API,
allowing it to be manipulated by both the SAN and the cognitive process.
Modiﬁable elements are assumed to have a set of states that they can operate
in, and a “solution” for a cognitive process consists of a set of these states
that, when taken together, meet the end-to-end requirements of the system.
At any given instant the set of all possible combinations of states S can be par-
titioned into two subsets. The ﬁrst, S′, contains all possible combinations of
sets that meet the end-to-end requirements and the second, ¯S′, consists of all
combinations that do not meet these requirements. Of those in S′, some may
meet the requirements better than others, making them preferred solutions.
A cognitive network attempts to reach a set of states S′. This means
that, should the network be in a state in ¯S′, or some sub-optimal state in
S′, the cognitive process attempts to move the system state to an optimal
solution. With cognitive control over every element, the cognitive process can
potentially set the system to any state; an ideal cognitive process could set the
state to the optimal solution. If the system has only a few points of cognitive
control, or chooses not to exercise all its control, then the cognitive process
has to use the functionality and interactions of the non-cognitive aspects of
the network to set the system state. Like the hole at the bottom of a funnel,
certain system states will be basins of attraction, pulling the system towards
them from a variety of starting states. If a system has several attractors and
some are more optimal than others, then a few points of cognitive control may
be enough to draw the system out of one attractor and into another. This is

analogous to a watershed, in which moving the source of water a few miles
may be enough to change what river the water will ﬁnally ﬂow into.
2.4 A Cognitive Network for Multicast Lifetime
To illustrate the eﬀect of these critical design decisions on a network, we
present a cognitive network approach to maximizing a multicast ﬂow’s life-
time. By investigating even a simple cognitive network for a real-world prob-
lem, some of the subtleties of the design process can be explored. In this
manner, the following cognitive network problem should be viewed as an
illustrative case study.
Many factors may aﬀect the expected lifetime of a network connection in a
wireless network. For instance, traﬃc congestion can cause timeouts in upper
layer protocols, interference can cause loss of connectivity at the PHY layer,
and mobility can cause unexpected disconnections in traﬃc routing. However,
for mobile and portable devices, one of the chief factors in determining the
lifetime of a connection is the energy remaining in the batteries of the mobile
nodes.
This example focuses on a cognitive network with control over the trans-
mission power, antenna directionality, and routing tables of the network nodes.
This is not the ﬁrst investigation into lifetime routing in wireless networks; a
large body of work on power-eﬃcient routing exists in the literature. Gupta’s
survey [21] provides an excellent comparison of several power-eﬃcient mul-
ticast algorithms for omnidirectional antennas. Weiselthier et al. [22] have
examined this problem using directional antennas. A complete review of the
related literature and an investigation using Mixed Integer Linear Program
(MILPs) for determining the optimal lifetimes can be found in [23]. Although
primarily designed to illustrate the cognitive network concept, this work is
the ﬁrst to provide a distributed, cognitive network approach to multicast
lifetime routing that incorporates energy eﬃciency considerations, directional
antennas, and a Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) suﬃciency
requirement.
2.4.1 Problem Description
A wireless network is made up of a collection of network elements with vary-
ing energy capacity. Some elements may be battery powered, with limited
capacity, while others may be less mobile, with large, high capacity batter-
ies. The lifetime of a data path, however, is limited by the radio utilizing the
largest fraction of its battery capacity. By minimizing the utilization of this
bottleneck radio, the lifetime of the path can be maximized. Furthermore, we
consider a network where radios are equipped with directional antennas, which
are useful to reduce interference, improve spatial multiplexing, and increase
range.

30
Ryan W. Thomas et al.
We model a network consisting of a set of radios N = {1, 2, . . . , n}, in
which the objective is to create a maximum lifetime multicast tree between
source S and destination set D. As described earlier, the cognitive network
controls three modiﬁable network parameters: the radio transmission power
(contained in the elements of vector pt), the antenna directionality (angles are
contained in the elements of vector φ), and element routing tables (contained
in each node of the multicast tree T). The states of the modiﬁable elements
are part of the action set A, of which the action vector a contains the current
state of each modiﬁable element.
In the model used here, the lifetime of a radio is inversely proportional to
the utilization of the radio’s battery,
µi = pti
cai
(2.1)
where pti is radio i’s transmission power and cai is the remaining energy
capacity of its battery. The lifetime of a data path is limited by the radio
utilizing the largest fraction of its battery capacity, so over the entire multicast
tree T, the lifetime will be inversely proportional to the utilization of the max-
utilization radio
µT = max
j∈T {µj}
(2.2)
The network consists of radios with fully directional antennas in receive
mode2 (each element transmits omnidirectionally and receives directionally)
with a ﬁxed beamwidth θ that can take on a boresight angle φ ∈[0, 2π).
Figure 2.3 illustrates the operation of an ad-hoc network with directional
antennas in receive mode.
When radio i transmits, the signal experiences gain factor gb within the
main beam of the antenna [25]

31
gb = 2π
θ
(2.3)
Some energy leaks outside the main beam in sidelobes. The fraction that ends
up in the beam is pct ∈(0, 1) and the fraction outside the beam is (1 −pct).
We also consider a path loss attenuation factor, proportional to
gpij =
1
d(i, j)α
(2.4)
where d(i, j) is the euclidean distance between source i and destination j and
α is the path loss exponent. Combining these gains and attenuations, the
overall gain from a transmission by radio i received at radio j is
gij(φj) =

gb · gpij · pct
φj ∈a(i, j) ± θ
2
gpij · (1 −pct)
otherwise
(2.5)
where a(i, j) is the angular function between radios i and j.
A radio j can correctly receive information from radio i if the power re-
ceived from the desired transmitter is greater than all other power and noise
received by some SINR factor. We deﬁne the vector pr to be the power re-
ceived at every radio in the tree from their parent radio,
prj(pti, φj) = pti · gij(φj)
(2.6)
There is an entry in this vector for every radio in the tree, with the exception
of the source radio (|pr| = |T| −1). We then deﬁne vector no to be the
minimum required power to overcome the interference and noise received at
every element,
noj(pt, φj, T) =
⎛
⎝
k̸=i
prk(pti, φj) + σj
⎞
⎠γj
(2.7)
where σj is the thermal noise and γj is the SINR requirement for a particular
radio. The vectors pr and no combine to give the network constraint,
pr −no ≥0
(2.8)
2.4.2 Cognitive Network Design
The cognitive network framework encompasses a wide spectrum of possible
implementations and solutions. This approach allows the framework to be a
method for approaching problems in complex networks, rather than a speciﬁc
solution. The framework sits on top of existing network layers, processes, and
protocols, adjusting elements of the SAN to achieve an end-to-end goal. In this
section, we show how a cognitive network that solves the multicast lifetime

into the framework.
problem ﬁts into the framework. We examine each layer, showing how the
requirements layer provides goals to the cognitive elements, how the cognitive
process performs the feedback loop, and identify the functionality of the SAN.
The ideas in this section are illustrated in Figure 2.4.
The cognitive process consists of three cognitive elements that distribute
the operation of the cognitive process both functionally and spatially: Power-
Control, DirectionControl, and RoutingControl. PowerControl adjusts the PHY
transmission power (pti), DirectionControl adjusts the MAC spatial operation
(φi), and RoutingControl adjusts the network layer’s routing functionality (T).
The SAN network status sensors provide each cognitive element with the
knowledge of each radio’s battery utilization in its k-hop neighborhood. The
k-hop neighborhood of a radio is deﬁned to be every radio reachable in the
routing tree via at most k hops, following the routing tree both up and down
branches.
Requirements Layer
The cognitive network investigated here is associated with a single objective
optimization as its end-to-end goal. As such, the performance of an action
vector is only dependent on the life-span of the multicast ﬂow. The end-to-
end objective is deﬁned in Equation 2.9 as a cost function, where the lifetime
of a ﬂow is increased as C(a) is minimized.

2 Cognitive Networks
33
C(pt, φ, T) =

µT
pr −no ≥0
∞
otherwise
(2.9)
Each of the modiﬁable elements aﬀects the calculation of this cost: transmis-
sion power aﬀects the lifetime directly; antenna orientation and routing table
inﬂuence the lifetime indirectly by aﬀecting the required transmission power.
The requirements layer transforms the end-to-end objective into a goal
for each cognitive element through the CSL. Although these objectives are
localized (each element only adapts a single modiﬁable element) the state of
all modiﬁable elements aﬀects the cognitive element’s performance.
PowerControl’s objective is to minimize the transmission power on every
radio subject to the system constraint. This means that a radio will attempt to
transmit at the minimum power that connects it to all of its children through
the local control of pti. The objective can be represented by the utility function
uPC

(pt) = −

j∈Ci

(2.10)
which is maximized when the transmitting radio has exactly the power needed
to reach the child radio with the greatest noise and least gain factor. Ci is the
set of child radios that receive from radio i in the multicast tree.
The objective of DirectionControl is to maximize the receiving radio’s SINR
by controlling the directional angle of the antenna beam φi locally at every
antenna. One form that the utility can take is
uDC
i
(pt, φi) = pri −noi
(2.11)
By rotating the directional antenna, the radio can increase the gain from the
parent radio, while attenuating interfering signals.
The objective of RoutingControl is to minimize each radio’s battery uti-
lization by manipulating the routing tree (T) used by the network. The utility
can be expressed as
uRC
i
(pti) = 1
µi
(2.12)
By manipulating the children radios that it has to transmit to, a radio can
reduce its transmission power and battery utilization.
Cognitive Process
The cognitive process consists of the three cognitive elements described above,
each operating on every radio in the network. In this section, we discuss the
strategies utilized by these elements to achieve the above objective goals and
identify the critical design decisions used by each cognitive element.

PowerControl The PowerControl cognitive element uses a strategy called Re-
lax. Relax moves the transmission power of the elements of a tree to a
minimum but suﬃcient power state (referred to as ˆpt) for a given tree struc-
ture. Nodes do this by increasing or decreasing transmission power until it
just meets the SINR suﬃciency requirements of all their children. This means
that parent node i will iteratively increase or decrease its transmission power
according to the amount of interference and noise observed by the child j with
the maximum amount of noise and interference. Algorithm 1 describes this
process more formally.
Relax is similar to the asynchronous iterative power control algorithm
presented by Yates [26]. That paper proved, for a cellular network consisting
of multiple handsets communicating with a base-station, if Equation 2.8 is
feasible (meaning that there exists a solution), Relax will ﬁnd the optimal
ˆpt. Yates’ work is for the reverse of the problem we consider – a cellular
network is comprised of many nodes transmitting to a single base station. In
contrast, our work considers a multicast wireless network with a set of parent
nodes transmitting to many children. However, it is easy to show Yate’s results
still hold.
DirectionControl The second cognitive element’s behavior is DirectionCon-
trol. DirectionControl moves the directional antenna to the orientation that
maximizes the received SINR from a node’s parent node. There are several
direction-ﬁnding algorithms in the literature [27] and DirectionControl can im-
plement one of these. If a node is a part of the multicast routing tree, it directs
its antenna such that the power received from the parent is maximized with
respect to the amount of interference and noise. If a node is not part of the
multicast tree, it directs the antenna towards any source from which it can
receive with the greatest SINR. For clarity, we will delineate these two tree
structures: the ﬁrst, called the functional tree, consists of just elements in
the multicast routing tree and the second, called the structural tree, includes
every element in the system that can receive a signal that meets the SINR
requirement.
RoutingControl RoutingControl attempts to minimize the utilization of the
radio batteries by approximating a Steiner tree for the utilization metric.
RoutingControl uses the ChildSwitch strategy described in Algorithm 2.
ChildSwitch begins by determining if it is operating on the max-utilization
radio (the radio with maximum battery utilization) of its k-hop neighborhood,

16:

by comparing its battery utilization against every k-hop neighbor’s battery
utilization. If it is, the radio becomes the control-radio and takes control over
the routing tables of every element in the k-hop neighborhood. It then iden-
tiﬁes which of the children radios in the functional tree requires the greatest
amount of power to reach (the max-power child). The control-radio then at-
tempts to detach the max-power child from itself and re-attach it as the child
of another radio (by changing the routing table of a k-hop neighbor so that it
becomes the new parent) in the k-hop neighborhood, in order to reduce the
k-hop neighborhood’s maximum utilization.
Valid choices for a new parent for the max-power child include all radios in
the k-hop neighborhood of the structural tree, except for children of the max-
power child. By using the structural tree rather than the functional tree, new
radios in the network can be brought sensibly into the functional tree. After
assignment, ChildSwitch waits until Relax converges and DirectionControl
selects the correct beam angle. When Relax converges, ChildSwitch on the
control-radio compares the utilization of all radios in the k-hop neighborhood
against its initial utilization. The process is then repeated for the remaining
valid radios, with the control-radio remembering the best (minimum) max-
utilization conﬁguration, and upon completion setting the routing table to
this conﬁguration.
This process repeats indeﬁnitely until the max-utilization control-radios
are no longer able to move their max-power children to conﬁgurations that
lower the max-utilization radio of their k-hop neighborhood. In a syn-
chronous network, in which only one RoutingControl control-radio performs
ChildSwitch at a time, the network will (except in rare cases) converge to
a single set of max-utilization radios.

Software Adaptable Network
The SAN provides an interface to the three modiﬁable network elements and
the status of the network. The reported status is the local noise, maximum
transmission power required to reach its children, k-hop battery utilization
and k-hop routing tree.
The required transmission power, battery utilization of child radios, and
routing tree status can be discovered and reported via a variable power hand-
shaking scheme. In a synchronous manner, radios one by one send a Hello
message addressed to all children. The children each responded with an Ack
message to the parent. The parent then decreases its transmission power and
sends a new Hello message until it fails to receive an Ack from some child.
The parent radio then stops decreasing its power and returns to the previous
power level, which is the maximum transmission power required to reach all
its children. These Hello and Ack messages can also transfer information
about each radio’s battery utilization and the routing tree within the k-hop
neighborhood. In contrast to these non-local measurements, the amount of
local noise can be calculated through the local SINR measurement.
2.4.3 Results
To determine the eﬀectiveness of this cognitive network, we developed a sim-
ulation of the cognitive network. The simulation was written in Matlab, and
consisted of nodes placed with a uniform random distribution in a square 2-D
map with density 0.1 nodes/unit2. There is a single source node and a variable
number of receivers. The beam width θ is 30◦, the path loss exponent α is 2,
and 30% of the transmitted power is assumed to leak out through sidelobes
(1−pct). Each wireless node was given a battery with a random capacity (cai)
uniformly distributed between 0 and 300 units of energy. The SINR suﬃciency
requirement is set to 1, meaning that the received power must be greater than
the noise and interference to satisfy Equation 2.8.
The normalized lifetime of a path is calculated as the ratio of the lifetime
obtained by the cognitive network to the optimal lifetime for the same set
of source/destinations, capacities, and node positions. The optimal lifetime
was determined using Wood’s MILP [24]. Knowing the optimal solution is
useful, since it allows a true “apples-to-apples” comparison between diﬀerent
scenarios, resulting in an accurate gauge of how eﬀective the cognitive network
is.
Underlying the cognitive network, one of two diﬀerent generic multicast
routing algorithms was used. The ﬁrst, Greedy, uses a greedy algorithm
to create the multicast tree. Greedy forms the multicast tree from the
source node, adding minimum utilization nodes until a spanning tree has
been formed. Utilization is estimated for every pair of nodes as the ratio of
the (non-interference) transmission power required to reach each node to the

node’s battery capacity. Greedy then prunes oﬀbranches until it has the
minimum tree required to reach every destination. The other multicast algo-
rithm used is Star, which implements a 1-hop broadcast star from the source
to every destination.
For a given scenario (consisting of node count, location, and battery capac-
ity) both Greedy or Star were run, individually. The resultant tree topology
and parent/child information from each algorithm were handed to Relax and
DirectionControl, which determine pti and φi, maximizing the lifetime for this
route. The full cognitive process, including RoutingControl was then run on
the route determined by Greedy and Star until it converged to a single set
of max-utilization nodes. The lifetime of the resultant tree was then calcu-
lated. Finally, both the non-cognitive and cognitive lifetimes for a scenario
were compared against the optimal lifetime obtained from the MILP, provid-
ing a normalized lifetime in (0, 1), where 1 represents an optimal lifetime for
that particular scenario.

These results show that the simplicity of Star leads to sub-optimal per-
formance, with at worst case less than 40% of the average lifetime of Greedy.
However, it also conﬁrms that the cognitive network can make a signiﬁcant

improvement on the average lifetime of the ﬂow by using a 1-hop neighbor-
hood – over 125% improvement in the Star case. The Greedy algorithm
alone achieves much longer lifetimes, but the cognitive network is still able to
improve it by 5–15%. In both routing algorithms, lifetimes remained steady
or decreased as the number of multicast receivers increased. The cognitive
network was able to improve the lifetime of the connection for all receiver
counts and neighborhood sizes.
2.5 Future Questions and Research Areas
The previous sections make a case for the “what, why, and how” of cognitive
networks. We now examine major issues that need to be addressed in order
to move from concept to reality.
There is an implicit assumption in this chapter that the cognitive network
implements conﬁguration changes synchronously. The details of actually mak-
ing this happen with high reliability are likely to be complex. The implications
of nodes’ switching conﬁguration at diﬀerent times may be worse than if no
adaptation had been performed at all. Also, the varying topology of the net-
work means that not all nodes will receive notiﬁcation of conﬁguration changes
at the same time. A possible approach is to require nodes to be synchronized
to some common time reference and to issue conﬁguration changes with re-
spect to the time reference. However, this adds complexity to the nodes and
still does not guarantee that messages will not be lost, resulting in stranded
nodes. It also forces the network to delay its adaptation to the conditions that
spawned the conﬁguration change.
Due to the autonomy of each, there is potential conﬂict between what a
cognitive radio and a cognitive network each control if there is not an inte-
grated architecture. One approach is to turn all control over to the cognitive

2 Cognitive Networks
39
network, but this is probably unwise. The reason is that the cognitive net-
work has to limit its observations as much as possible just to make cognitive
processing for a network feasible. This leaves much detailed local information
out of the cognitive network picture. This detailed local information may be
used by the cognitive radio to further optimize its performance outside the
bounds of what is controlled by the cognitive network. To do this, the cogni-
tive radio must know what it is allowed to change and what is in the hands of
the cognitive network. A potential solution is to allow the cognitive network to
establish regulatory policy for the cognitive radio in real-time, leaving the cog-
nitive radio to perform further optimization under the constraints established
by the cognitive network policy.
2.6 Conclusion
This chapter laid the groundwork for the concept of a cognitive network and
proposed a deﬁnition for the term. Additionally, the cognitive network concept
was compared against both cognitive radio and cross-layer design. Finally,
a framework for cognitive networks was presented, and critical themes and
issues were identiﬁed in the design and implementation of a cognitive network.
While a signiﬁcant amount of work remains to be done to make cognitive
networks a reality, the rising complexity of networks and the need to manage
this complexity makes the concept timely and attractive.
Although computer networks are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, the
ability to manage and operate them is not becoming increasingly easier. Cogni-
tive networks, with their promise to self-adapt to meet end-to-end objectives,
are an emerging technology that will deal with this increasing complexity.
This chapter presented three critical properties that designers need to trade
oﬀwhen architecting a cognitive network. These critical properties will pro-
vide design guidelines for future research into and implementation of cognitive
networks.

3.1 Introduction
Cognitive radio has evolved to include a wide range of technologies for making
wireless systems more ﬂexible via more ﬂexible transceiver platforms and en-
hanced computational intelligence. Dynamic spectrum access networks [1, 2]
evolved rapidly from regulatory rulings of the past few years [7]. In addition,
research towards context-aware services has resulted in interdisciplinary in-
tegration of complementary but somewhat isolated technologies: perception,
planning and machine learning technologies from artiﬁcial intelligence on the
one hand, and on the other hand software radio technologies that had come to
include self-description in the extensible markup language, Radio XML [3–5].
The ﬁrst signiﬁcant radio-domain application for such smarter radios was the
autonomous sharing of pooled spectrum [6], which the US Federal Communi-
cations Commission (FCC) endorsed relatively soon thereafter to encourage
the development of secondary spectrum markets [7]. The original visionary for-
mulation of the ideal Cognitive Radio (iCR) remains in development. iCR was
formulated as an autonomous agent that perceives the user’s situation (shop-
ping or in distress) to proactively assist the user with wireless information ser-
vices, particularly if the user is too busy or otherwise occupied to go through
the tedium of using the cell phone, such as when in personal distress [8]. At
the 2004 Dagstuhl workshop [9], cognitive radio was extended to Cognitive
Wireless Networks (CWN), which has become a research area with its own
conference on cognitive radio oriented wireless networks, CrownCom [10].

This chapter summarizes the architecture of the ideal cognitive radio (iCR)
that is more fully developed in the foundation text [11], particularly with
respect to the critical machine learning technologies. The iCR architecture
includes both isolated radio devices acting on behalf of a user and Cog-
nitive Wireless Networks (CWN), both of which may incorporate machine
perception – vision, speech, and other language skills – to ground the user
continuously in a <Scene/>2 that includes signiﬁcant physical (space–time),
social, and Radio Frequency (RF) aspects. Thus grounded, the iCR’s em-
bedded intelligent agent can respond more accurately to the user’s current
situation, interpreting location awareness signals (e.g. GPS) more astutely
and focusing radio resources on the user’s speciﬁc information needs.
Modern radio resources include not just dynamic radio spectrum [12] and
air interface channels, but also increasingly ﬁne-grained three-dimensional
space–time resources created by directional antennas with and without Multi-
Input Multi-Output (MIMO) processing [13]. The move to higher bandwidths
for hot spot technologies signals an industry trend. The resulting <RF/> envi-
ronments increasingly take on the characteristics of complex adaptive systems
(CAS) of cooperating radio devices and networks rapidly evolving to more ef-
fectively manage the RF environment to address the user’s needs for Quality
of Information (QoI) given the social setting in which the user and device
happen to be situated.
3.1.1 Ideal CRs Know Radio Like TellMe R
⃝Knows 800 Numbers
Long distance directory assistance in the US generally is answered by an
interactive speech understanding system, an algorithm that may say “Toll
Free Directory Assistance powered by TellMe R
⃝” [14]. “Please say the name
of the listing you want.” If you travel like I do, it may say “OK, United
Airlines. If that is not what you wanted press 9, otherwise wait while I look
up the number.” Ninety-nine point nine percent of the time TellMe gets it
right, replacing thousands of directory assistance operators of yore. TellMe,
a speech-understanding system, achieves such a high degree of success by its
focus on just one task: ﬁnding a toll-free telephone number. Narrow task focus
is one of the keys to such a successful computationally intelligent user interface
application.
The Cognitive Radio Architecture (CRA) of this chapter frames the func-
tions, components, and design rules of Cognitive Wireless Networks (CWNs),
in some sense the conceptual oﬀspring of TellMe. CWNs are emerging in
research settings as real-time, focused applications of radio and computa-
tional intelligence technologies. CWNs diﬀer from the more general Artiﬁcial
Intelligence (AI) based services like intelligent agents, computer speech, and
computer vision in degree of focus. Like TellMe, CWNs focus on very narrow

45
tasks. Broader than TellMe, the task is to adapt radio-enabled information
services to the speciﬁc needs of a speciﬁc user to achieve high QoI. TellMe,
a network service, requires substantial network computing resources to serve
thousands of users at once. CWNs, on the other hand, may start with a Cog-
nitive Radio (CR) in your purse or on your belt, a cell phone on steroids,
focused on the narrow task of creating from the myriad available wireless in-
formation networks and resources just what is needed by just one user, you.
TellMe interacts with anybody, but each CR is self-aware and owner-aware
via sensory perception and Autonomous Machine Learning (AML) technolo-
gies, earning the term “cognitive.” Each CR fanatically serves the needs and
protects the personal information of just one owner via the CRA using its
audio and visual sensory perception and AML.
TellMe is here and now, while CWNs are emerging in global wireless
research centers and industry forums like the Software-Deﬁned Radio (SDR)
Forum and Wireless World Research Forum (WWRF). This chapter sum-
marizes CRA systems architecture challenges and approaches, emphasizing
CR as a technology enabler for rapidly emerging commercial CWN services
and generation-after-next military communications, based on the foundation
technologies computer vision, computer speech, AML, and SDR.
3.1.2 CRs See What You See, Discovering RF Uses, Needs,
and Preferences
In 2002, GRACE (Graduate Robot Attending Conference) [15], an auto-
nomous mobile robot with a CRT for a face entered the International Joint
Conference on Artiﬁcial Intelligence (IJCAI). It completed the mobile robot
challenge by ﬁnding the registration desk; registering by talking to the recep-
tionist; following the signs that said “ROBOTS” this way and “HUMANS”
the other way; when called on giving a ﬁve-minute talk about herself; and then
answering questions. She was the ﬁrst to complete this challenge ﬁrst articu-
lated in the 1980s. There were no joysticks and no man behind the curtain:
just a robot that can autonomously see, hear, and interact with the people
and the environment to accomplish a speciﬁc task.
Compared to GRACE, the standard cell phone is not too bright. Although
the common cell phone has a camera, it lacks GRACE’s vision algorithms so
it does not know what it is seeing. It can send a video clip, but it has no per-
ception of the visual scene in the clip. If it had GRACE-like vision algorithms,
it could perceive the visual scene. It could tell if it were at home, in the car, at
work, shopping, or driving up the driveway on the way home. If GRACE-like
vision algorithms show it that you are entering your driveway in your car, a
Cognitive SDR could learn to open the garage door for you wirelessly. Thus,
you would not need to ﬁsh for the garage door opener, yet another wireless
gadget. In fact, you do not need a garage door opener anymore, once CRs
enter the market. To open the car door, you will not need a key fob either.

46
Joseph Mitola III
As you approach your car, your personal CR perceives the common scene and,
as trained, synthesizes the fob RF transmission and opens the car door for you.
Your CR perceives visual scenes continuously searching visual–RF corre-
lations, cues to your needs for wireless services. A CR radio learns to open
your garage door when you arrive home from your use of the garage door
opener. When ﬁrst you open the garage door with the wireless garage-door
opener, your CR correlates the visual and RF scenes: owner’s hand on device,
then RF signal in the ISM band, and then the garage door opens. The next
time, your CR veriﬁes through reinforcement learning that your hand on the
button, the RF signal, and the opening of the garage door form a sequential
script, a use-case. The third time, your cognitive radio detects the approach
to the garage door and oﬀers to complete the RF use case for you, saying, “I
see we are approaching the garage. Would you like me to open the door for
us?” Thereafter, it will open the garage door when you drive up the driveway
unless you tell it not to. It has transformed one of your patterns of RF usage,
opening the garage door; into a cognitive (self-user perceptive) service, oﬀ-
loading one of your daily tasks. Since the CR has learned to open the garage
door, you may un-clutter your car by just one widget, that door opener.
Since your CR learned to open the garage door by observing your use of
the radio via AML, you did not pay the cell phone company, and you did
not endure pop-up advertising to get this personalized wireless service. As
you enter the house with arms full of packages, your CR closes the garage
door and locks it for you, having learned that from you as well. For the CR
vision system to see what you see, today’s Bluetooth earpieces evolve to CR
Bluetooth glasses, complete with GRACE-like vision.
CRs do not attempt everything. They learn about your radio use patterns
because they know a lot about radio and about generic users and legitimate
uses of radio. CRs have the a priori knowledge needed to detect opportuni-
ties to assist you with your use of the radio spectrum accurately, delivering
that assistance with minimum intrusion. TellMe is not a generic speech un-
derstanding system and CR is not a generic AI service in a radio.
Products realizing the visual perception of this vignette are realizable on
laptop computers today. Reinforcement learning (RL) and Case-based Rea-
soning (CBR) are mature AML technologies with radio network applications
now being demonstrated in academic and industrial research settings as tech-
nology pathﬁnders for CR [5] and CWN [16]. Two or three Moore’s law cycles
or three to ﬁve years from now, these vision and learning algorithms will ﬁt in
your cell phone. In the interim, CWNs will begin to oﬀer such services, oﬀering
consumers new tradeoﬀs between privacy and ultra-personalized convenience.
3.1.3 Cognitive Radios Hear What you Hear, Augmenting
your Personal Skills
Compared to GRACE, the cell phone on your waist is deaf. Although your
cell phone has a miCRophone, it lacks GRACE’s speech understanding tech-

nology, so it does not perceive what it hears. It can let you talk to your
daughter, but it has no perception of your daughter, nor of the content of
your conversation. If it had GRACE’s speech understanding technology, it
could perceive your speech dialog. It could detect that you and your daughter
are talking about common subjects like homework, or your favorite song. With
CR, GRACE-like speech algorithms would detect your daughter saying that
your favorite song is now playing on WDUV. As an SDR, not just a cell phone,
your CR tunes to FM 105.5 so that you can hear “The Rose.” With your CR,
you no longer need a transistor radio. Your CR eliminates from your pocket,
purse or backpack yet another RF gadget. In fact, you may not need iPOD R
⃝,
GameBoy R
⃝and similar products as high-end CR’s enter the market. Your
CR will learn your radio listening and information use patterns, accessing the
songs, downloading games, snipping broadcast news, sports, stock quotes as
you like as the CR re-programs its internal SDR to better serve your needs
and preferences. Combining vision and speech perception, as you approach
your car your CR perceives this common scene and, as you had the morning
before, tunes your car radio to WTOP to your favorite “Traﬃc and weather
together on the eights.” With GRACE’s speech understanding algorithms,
your CR recognizes such regularly repeated catch phrases, turning up the vol-
ume for the traﬃc report and then turning it down or oﬀafter the weather
report, avoiding annoying commercials and selecting relevant ones. If you ac-
tually need a tax deduction, it will record those radio commercials for your
listening pleasure at tax time when you need them.
For AML, CRs need to save speech, RF, and visual cues, all of which may
be recalled by the user, expanding the user’s ability to remember details of con-
versations and snapshots of scenes, augmenting the skills of the <Owner/>.3
Because of the brittleness of speech and vision technologies, CRs try to “re-
member everything” like a continuously running camcorder. Since CRs detect
content such as speakers’ names, and keywords like “radio” and “song,” they
can retrieve some content asked for by the user, expanding the user’s memory
in a sense. CRs thus could enhance the personal skills of their users such as
memory for detail.
3 Semantic Web: Researchers may formulate iCR as suﬃciently speech-capable to
answer questions about <Self/> and the <Self/> use of <Radio/> in support
of its <Owner/>. When an ordinary concept like “owner” has been translated
into a comprehensive ontological structure of computational primitives, e.g. via
Semantic Web technology [3], the concept becomes a computational primitive for
autonomous reasoning and information exchange. Radio XML, an emerging CR
derivative of the eXtensible Markup Language, XML, oﬀers to standardize such
radio-scene perception primitives. They are highlighted in this brief treatment by
<Angle-brackets/>. All iCR know of a <Self/>, a <Name/>, and an <Owner/>.
The <Self/> has capabilities like <GSM/> and <SDR/>, a self-referential com-
puting architecture, which is guaranteed to crash unless its computing ability is
limited to real-time response tasks [3]; this is appropriate for CR but may be
inappropriate for general purpose computing.

48
Joseph Mitola III
High performance dialog and audio–video retrieval technologies are
cutting-edge but not out of reach for suitably narrow domains like TellMe and
customization of wireless services. Casual dialog typically contains anaphora
and ellipsis, using words like “this” and “that” to refer to anonymous events
like playing a favorite song. Although innovative, speech research systems
already achieve similar dialogs in limited domains [17]. When the user says,
“How did you do that?” the domain of discourse is limited to the <Self/>
and its contemporaneous actions. Since CR can do only one or two things at
once, the question, “How did you do that?” has only one primary semantic
referent, playing the song. Reasoning using analogy, also cutting edge, is
no longer beyond the pale for tightly limited domains like CR and thus is
envisioned in the CRA.
3.1.4 CRs Learn to Diﬀerentiate Speakers to Reduce Confusion
To further limit combinatorial explosion in speech, CR may form speaker
models, statistical summaries of the speech patterns of speakers, particu-
larly of the <Owner/>. Speaker modeling is particularly reliable when the
<Owner/> uses the CR as a cell phone to place a phone call. Contempo-
rary speaker recognition algorithms diﬀerentiate male from female speakers
with high (>95%) probability. With a few diﬀerent speakers to be recognized
(e.g. fewer than 10 in a family) and with reliable side information like the
speaker’s telephone number, today’s algorithms recognize individual speak-
ers with 80 to 90% probability. Speaker models can become contaminated,
such as erroneously including both <Owner/> and <Daughter/> speech in
the <Owner/> model. Insightful product engineering could circumvent such
problems, rendering <Owner/> interactions as reliable as TellMe R
⃝over the
next few years.
Over time, each CR learns the speech patterns of its <Owner/> in order
to learn from the <Owner/> and not be confused by other speakers. CR thus
leverages experience incrementally to achieve increasingly sophisticated dia-
log. Directional miCRophones are rapidly improving to Service Video Tele-
Conference (VTC) markets. Embedding these VTC miCRophones into CR
“glasses” would enable CR to diﬀerentiate user speech from backgrounds like
radio and TV. Today, a 3 GHz laptop supports this level of speech under-
standing and dialog synthesis in real time, making it likely available in a cell
phone in three to ﬁve years.
Today, few consumers train the speech recognition systems embedded in
most laptop computers. Its too much work and the algorithms do not take
dictation well enough. Thus, although speech recognition technology exists, it
is not as eﬀective at the general task of converting speech to text as TellMe
is in ﬁnding an 800 number. The CR value proposition, overcomes this limit
by embedding machine learning so your CR continually learns about you by
analyzing your voice, speech patterns, visual scene, and related use of the
RF spectrum from garage door openers to NOAA weather, from cell phone

and walkie-talkie to wireless home computer network. Do you want to know
if your child’s plane is in the air? Ask your CR and it could ﬁnd “NiftyAir
122 Heavy cleared for takeoﬀby Dulles Tower.” Again, in order to customize
services for you, the <Owner/>, the CR must both know a lot about radio
and learn a lot about you, the <Owner/>, recording and analyzing personal
information and thus placing a premium on trustable privacy technologies.
Increased autonomous (and thus free) customization of wireless service include
secondary use of broadcast spectrum. The CRA therefore incorporates speech
recognition.
3.1.5 More Flexible Secondary Use of Radio Spectrum
Consider a vignette with Lynne’ the <Owner/> and Barb, the <Daughter/>.
Barb drives to Lynne’s house in her car. Coincidentally, Lynne’ asks Genie,
the CR <Self/> “Can you call Barb for me?”
Genie: “Sure. She is nearby so I can use the TV band for a free video call if
you like.”
Lynne’: “Is that why your phone icon has a blue TV behind it?”
Genie: “Yes. I can connect you to her using unused TV channel 43 instead of
spending your cell phone minutes. The TV icon shows that you are using free
airtime as a secondary user of TV spectrum. I sent a probe to her cognitive
radio to be sure it could do this.”
Lynne’: “OK, thanks for saving cell time for me. Let me talk to her.” Barb’s
face appears on the screen.
Barb: “Wow, where did you come from?” Barb had never seen her cell phone
display her Mom in a small TV picture in real time before, only in video clips.
Lynne’: “Isn’t this groovy. Genie, my new cognitive radio, hooked us up on a
TV channel. It says you are nearby. Oh, I see you are out front and need help
with the groceries. Here I come.”
In 2004, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a
Report and Order that radio spectrum allocated to TV, but unused in a
particular broadcast market could be used by CR as secondary users under
Part 15 rules for low power devices, e.g. to create ad hoc networks. SDR Forum
member companies have demonstrated CR products with these elementary
spectrum-perception and use capabilities. Wireless products – military and
commercial – realizing the FCC vignettes already exist. Complete visual and
speech perception capabilities are not many years distant. Productization is
underway. Thus, the CRA emphasizes CR spectrum agility, but in a context
of enhanced perception technologies, a long-term growth path.
3.1.6 SDR Technology Underlies Cognitive Radio
To conclude the overview, take a closer look at the enabling radio technology,
SDR. Samuel F B Morse’s code revolutionized telegraphy in the late 1830s,
becoming the standard for “telegraph” by the late 1800s. Thus when Marconi

50
Joseph Mitola III
and Tesla brought forward wireless technology in 1902, Morse code was al-
ready a standard language for HF communication. Today as then, a radio
includes an antenna, a RF power ampliﬁer to transmit, and RF conversion
to receive; along with a modulator/demodulator (modem) to impart the code
to and from the RF channel; and a coder–decoder (codec) to translate infor-
mation from human-readable form to a form coded for eﬃcient radio trans-
mission. Today as then, RF conversion depended on capacitors and inductors
to set the radio frequency, but then some devices were the size of a refrigera-
tor, while today they can be chip-scale devices. Then, the modulator consisted
of the proverbial telegraph key, a switch to open and close the transmission
circuit for on-oﬀ-keyed (OOK) data encoding. Morse code, a series of short
(dits) or long marks (dahs) and spaces – sounds and silence – is still the
simplest, cheapest way to communicate across a continent, and Morse code
over HF radio still is used today in remote regions from the Australian out-
back to Africa and Siberia. Then and now, the “coder” was the person who
had memorized the Morse code, manually converting dit-dit-dah-dit from and
to the letters of the alphabet. Radio engineers almost never abandon an RF
band (HF) or mode (Morse code). Instead, the use morphs from mainstream
to a niche market like sports, amateur radio, remote regions, or developing
economies. Today there are nice user interfaces and digital networking, but ra-
dio engineering has not taken anything away. At the relatively low data rates
of mobile radio (<1 Mbps), networking (routing and switching) is readily
accomplished in software, unlike wired networks where data rates reach giga-
bits per second and dedicated hardware is needed for high speed switching.
The essential functional blocks of radio have not changed for a century
and are not likely to change either because the laws of physics deﬁne them:
antenna, RF conversion, power ampliﬁcation, modem, and codec. Today, how-
ever, miCRoelectronics technologies enable one to pack low power RF, modem,
and codecs into single-chip packages while antennas ﬁt neatly into the palm of
your hand. Today, there are a myriad of modems evolved from the single RF
of Morse to the sharing of RF bands in frequency, time, and code-space. The
manual codec has evolved to include communications security (COMSEC)
coding, authentication, and multi-layered digital protocol stacks. Cognitive
radio embraces all the broad classes of modulation, each with unique modems,
codecs and most importantly content, the reason people use the radio,
after all.
The SDR Forum and Object Management Group (OMG) have standard-
ized software architecture for wireless plug and play of the myriad band-mode
combinations: the Software Communications Architecture (SCA) and Soft-
ware Radio Architecture (SRA), respectively. But, the real enabler for SDR is
the increasingly programmable analog RF of SDR: antennas, RF conversion,
and ampliﬁers. Historically, the analog RF had ﬁxed frequency and band-
width, optimized for a small RF band such as 88 to 108 MHz for FM broadcast,
850–950 MHz for cell phones and 1.7 to 1.8 GHz for Personal Communications

3 Cognitive Radio Architecture
51
Systems (PCS), a third generation cellular band. Today’s cellular radios typ-
ically include three chip-sets, one optimized for ﬁrst-generation “roaming”
where infrastructure is not well built out, one for second generation digital
service such as GSM, and one for PCS or NexTel R
⃝.
Each of these chip-sets accesses only the narrow band needed for the ser-
vice, so today’s cell phones can’t open the garage door, not without another
(expensive) chip set. In 1990–95, DARPA demonstrated SPEAKeasy II, the
ﬁrst SDR with continuous RF from 2 MHz to 2 GHz in just three analog RF
bands: HF (2–30 MHz), mid-band (30–500 MHz) and high band (0.5–2 GHz).
MiCRo Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology makes it possible
to reprogram analog RF components digitally, so a cell phone could some day
synthesize the garage door opener as the new digitally controlled analog RF
MEMS technology emerges. RF MEMS digitally controls analog RF devices
[18]. In some RF MEMS devices, a controller commands a micro-scale motor
to move the interdigitated ﬁngers of a capacitor, changing its analog value
and hence changing the RF center frequency of the analog radio circuit. As
the ﬁngers move in and out by a few microns, the RF resonant frequency
changes up and down by MHz. As this technology matures and enters service,
RF chipsets will be reconﬁgurable across radio bands and modes, realizing
aﬀordable nearly ideal SDRs. FM, and TV/Broadcasts inform large markets
with news, sports, weather, music, and the like. From boom box to weather
radio, people around the world still depend on AM, FM and TV broadcasts for
such information. In the past, you had to buy a specialized radio receiver and
tune it manually to the station you like. With RF MEMS SDR, you tell the
CR what you want to hear and it ﬁnds it for you. Your approval or disapproval
constitutes training of the AML algorithms that tuned the MEMS SDR for
your user-speciﬁc content preferences.
RF MEMS have been demonstrated to reduce the size, weight, and power
of analog RF subsystems by two to three orders of magnitude, and by over
1000:1 in some cases, but they have been slow to enter markets because of
lower than necessary reliability, a focus of both academic and commercial RF
MEMS research and development. To facilitate the insertion of RF MEMS
and other enabling technologies, the CRA embraces hardware abstraction.
3.1.7 Privacy is Paramount
A CR that remembers all your conversations for several years needs only a
few hundred gigabytes of data memory, readily achieved in wearable CR-PDA
even today. Many such conversations will be private, and some will include
credit card numbers, social security numbers, bank account information, and
the like. When my laptop was stolen with ﬁve years of tax returns, the process
of dealing with identity theft was daunting and not foolproof. How can one
trust a CR with all that personal information? Why would it need to remember
all that stuﬀanyway?

52
Joseph Mitola III
One value proposition of CWNs is the reduction of tedium. Thus, asking
the new owner to program the CR or to train it for an hour in the way that
one is supposed to train the speech recognition system in a new laptop would
be to increase tedium, not to decrease it. CR therefore aggregates experience,
reprocessing the raw speech, vision, and RF data during sleep cycles so that
it learns from experience with minimum tedious training interactions with
the user. Although based solidly on contemporary RL and CBR technology,
task-focused introspective learning for nearly unsupervised dialog acquisition,
e.g. via text mining tools [19] is on the cutting edge of autonomous product
development while the more general problem of minimally supervised dialog
acquisition in general is at the cutting edge of language research. Thus, CR
products will always “cheat” the way TellMe cheats; CR products pick a
small, workable set of tasks that consumers will pay for and use, mini-killer
apps. The resulting revenue streams build technology for increasingly capable
tasks, evolving towards the vision-RF-dialog skills of the previous vignettes.
However, to learn this way, CR really must remember all the raw data – all
your keystrokes, emails, and conversations, to learn your use patterns and
preferences autonomously, thus capturing private personal data.
If CR must remember your private personal data, then it must protect
that information. Finger print readers are not perfect, as is any single In-
formation Assurance (IA) measure, so CR may use a mix of IA measures.
Candidate IA measures include soft biometrics like face and voice recognition
along with more obtrusive measures like iris recognition. Layers of Public Key
Infrastructure (PKI), GSM-like randomized challenges and signed responses
with network validation of identity, and battery backup of IA protection skills,
e.g. that erase all user data when the CR detects that it is being physically
compromised, e.g. by the unexplained removal of screws of its case. Privacy is
paramount, and practical products must protect personal information, iden-
tity, medical information, and the like with high reliability. Thus, a mix of soft
biometrics likes face and voice recognition coupled with selective hard bio-
metrics like a ﬁngerprint reader, PKI, and other encryption methods. Given
the limits of speech and visual perception technologies, CRs employ a large
fraction of their sensory perception resources recognizing the face, voice, and
daily habits of the <Owner/>. Some robots accumulate stimuli in a way
that simulate human emotion, e.g.: happiness or distress. If the robot detects
its <Owner’s> voice and face, then it knows what to expect based on having
learned the owners’ patterns. If the voice and face are not recognized, then the
CR might become defensive, protecting the owner’s data and potentially eras-
ing it rather than divulge personal data to someone the <Owner/> has not
previously authorized. Embedding a backup battery deep within the mother-
board and embedding sensors in screws in the motherboard might dissuade all
but the most sophisticated criminals from stealing such CRs. Therefore, CRA
explicitly includes hardware and software facilities to implement trustable
protection of privacy.

3.1.8 Military Applications Abound
Military applications of CR in CWNs abound. It is easy to imagine realistic
vignettes where radios relay the commander’s change to an operations order
in his own words, “Coalition partners are now located at grid square 76-11, so
hold your ﬁre. Rendezvous at Checkpoint Charlie at 1700.” There might be
little doubt about the authenticity of an order if it can be recalled and distrib-
uted digitally, authenticated and suitably protected to military standards, of
course. Tactical military radio communications are notoriously noisy. Thus, a
radio that conveys such critical information error-free and in the voice of the
commander could reduce the fog of war, potentially saving lives.
With autonomous machine learning skills, military iCRs would learn coali-
tion RF use patterns. Autonomously re-programming of their SDR trans-
ceivers, coalition CRs could learn to connect commanders directly with each
other, avoiding the need for dedicated military radio operators per se and
either reducing the size of a squad from ten to nine or enhancing the squad’s
capabilities by the 10% no longer needed to just operate the radio. Although
one can never completely replace the ﬂexibility and insight of skilled people,
as iCRs oﬄoad mundane radio operation tasks from the radio operator, the
team’s eﬀectiveness will increase, beneﬁcial in the short run even if it takes
decades to realize “Radar O’Reilly” in software.
Although the Phraselator [20] experiment showed the promise of real-time
language translation in a handheld device for coalition operations, a Phrase-
lator is yet another widget like the garage door opener. Envisioned iCR oﬀer a
ﬂexible hardware platform in which to embed Phraselator algorithms invoked
by language identiﬁcation algorithms that detect non-native language and
hence the need for real-time translation. Since iCR is about enhancing the
eﬀectiveness of communications, language translation embedded in CR to
translate when and where needed certainly has the potential to enhance com-
munications among coalition partners who speak diﬀerent languages, again
reducing the fog of war and improving the likelihood of success.
The CRA is not speciﬁcally designed for military applications, but its
open and evolutionary nature enable a wide range of commercial and military
applications.
3.1.9 Quality of Information (QoI) Metric
QoI concerns the information that meets a speciﬁc user’s need at a speciﬁc
time, place, physical location and social setting. If information is available,
then the quality, quantity, timeliness and suitability may be measured. One
expression for QoI [11] is given in Equation 1:
QoI = Quantity ∗Timeliness ∗Validity ∗Relevance ∗Accuracy ∗Detail
Equation 1 QoI metric

54
Joseph Mitola III
If there is no information, then Quantity = 0 as does QoI. If all the
required information is present, then Quantity = 1.0. Since diﬀerent users re-
quire diﬀerent information to be fully satisﬁed, this user-dependent parameter
is at best diﬃcult to measure.
Timeliness must be deﬁned in terms of the iCR user’s time line along
which the information would be used. If the information is needed imme-
diately, then the quality may be characterized as inversely proportional to
excessive time delay. To avoid division by zero, one may consider timeliness
to be 1.0 if the information is available before a minimum delivery time:
Tmin (time, place, social-setting, topic)
For simplicity, let’s adopt the convention that a situation is a speciﬁable
subspace of time, place, and social-setting. The concept of a social setting
must be deﬁned in terms that the user accepts, such as “shopping” or “get-
ting mugged.” Suppose the shortest time delay in such a setting is ε so the
maximum contribution of timeliness to QoI would be 1/ε. If timeliness is
normalized by ε, then maximum timeliness would be 1.0.
If validity is +1 if true and −1.0 if false, with the possibility of fuzzy set
membership, then the validity value is an element of [−1, 1], and QoI may be
positive or negative. Information that is known to be or that winds up being
false has a qualitatively diﬀerent kind of value than information the validity of
which is unknown (validity = 0). Information of unknown validity may safely
be ignored, so the QoI value of zero seems appropriate. Information that turns
out to be false may in fact be misleading, yielding negative results because the
user behaved in accordance with the falsehood. This is the sense of negative
QoI.
Relevance is the degree to which the information corresponds to the need,
measured in terms of precision and recall. In information retrieval, recall is
the fraction of relevant documents retrieved from a corpus by a query and
precision is the fraction of documents actually retrieved that turn out to be
relevant. Recall of 1.0 indicates that all relevant documents are retrieved, while
precision of 1.0 indicates that no irrelevant documents have been retrieved.
Adapting this well known metric to QoI, one may deﬁne relevance as the
product of precision and recall. This metric may not be ideal for information
retrieval purposes, but it suﬃces in its role as a QoI metric that can be used
to give an iCR feedback from its user by observing user behavior (e.g. asking
for more or apparently not using items retrieved).
Accuracy refers to the quantitative aspects of the information. Quanti-
tative errors include factual correctness (e.g. spell the President’s name right)
and numerical errors. Numerical accuracy reﬂects numerical error of the infor-
mation represented with arbitrary precision, while QoI precision reﬂects the
least error that it is possible to represent in a given numerical string. These
could be diﬀerentiated, but for simplicity, one may measure whether the pre-
cision in which the number is expressed supports the required accuracy. If
the accuracy required by the user is met, the value of the accuracy metric is
1.0. The rate of degradation of the accuracy metric from 1.0 may be linear,

3 Cognitive Radio Architecture
55
quadratic, exponential, fractal, or deﬁned by table look-up, provided it falls
in the range (0,1].
Finally if suﬃcient detail is provided to justify the information delivered,
then Detail = 1.0, gradually dropping to zero if no elaborating detail is pro-
vided.
Consider the following example:
<Query>Name of the largest state in the USA </Query>
<Quantity>name</Quantity><Timeliness> in the next few
seconds</Timeliness ><Validity>Must be true</Validity >
<Accuracy>Name must be spelled correctly</Accuracy ><Detail/>
</Query>
Equation 2 Illustrative information query
Since <Detail/> is null, the user is not asking for any special support-
ing information. In response to this query, the name “Texas” was valid until
“Alaska” became a state. The user didn’t specify a time frame so <Present/>
may be assumed, but if the <User/> happens to be interested in history, such
an assumption would not adequately reﬂect the user’s QoI needs. In addi-
tion, Texas remains the largest state in the contiguous lower 48 states, so the
geospatial scope might render Texas as accurate. A high QoI response from a
CWN might provide name both Alaska and Texas with the associated valid-
ity. If such a complete answer were provided quickly and were spelled right,
then QoI = 1.0. If the query were met an hour later because the iCR couldn’t
reach the cell phone network or WLAN for that length of time, then the QoI
is less than 1.0. The amount of degradation from 1.0 depends on the urgency
of the need. If the user were playing Trivial Pursuit with a few friends, then
the penalty for time delay might not be great. If the user were playing “Who
Wants to be a Millionaire?” on TV and asked the iCR for help as a phone-in,
then even a few minutes of delay could yield unacceptably low QoI.
Given a working deﬁnition of QoI, the iCR could automatically manipulate
the parameters of the air interface (s) as a function of the user’s speciﬁc needs
for QoI.
3.1.10 Architecture
Architecture is a comprehensive, consistent set of design rules by which a
speciﬁed set of components achieves a speciﬁed set of functions in prod-
ucts and services that evolve through multiple design points over time [9].
This section introduces the fundamental design rules by which SDR, sensors,
perception, and AML may be integrated to create Aware, Adaptive, and Cog-
nitive Radios (iCR’s) with better Quality of Information (QoI) through capa-
bilities to Observe (sense, perceive), Orient, Plan, Decide, Act and Learn (the
OOPDAL loop) in RF and user domains, transitioning from merely adaptive
to demonstrably cognitive radio, CR.

56
Joseph Mitola III
This section develops ﬁve complementary perspectives of architecture
called CRA I through CRA V. CRA I deﬁnes six functional components,
black boxes to which are ascribed a ﬁrst level decomposition of iCR func-
tions and among which important interfaces are deﬁned. One of these boxes
is SDR, a proper subset of iCR. One of these boxes performs cognition via the
<Self/>, a self-referential subsystem that strictly embodies ﬁnite computing
(e.g. no while or until loops) avoiding the G¨odel–Turing paradox.
CRA II examines the ﬂow of inference through a cognition cycle that
arranges the core capabilities of ideal CR (iCR) in temporal sequence for
a logical ﬂow and circadian rhythm for the CRA. CRA III examines the
related levels of abstraction for iCR to sense elementary sensory stimuli and to
perceive Quality of Service (QoS)-relevant aspects of a <Scene/> consisting
of the <User/> in an <Environment/> that includes <RF/>. CRA IV of the
foundation text [11] examines the mathematical structure of this architecture,
identifying mappings among topological spaces represented and manipulated
to preserve set-theoretic properties. Finally, CRA V of the foundation text [11]
reviews SDR architecture, sketching an evolutionary path from the SCA/SRA
to the CRA. The CRA <Self/> provided in CRA Self .xml of that text exp-
resses in Radio XML (RXML) the CRA introduced in this chapter along with
a priori knowledge for autonomous machine learning.
3.2 CRA I: Functions, Components and Design Rules
The functions of iCR exceed those of SDR. Reformulating the iCR <Self/>
as a peer of its own <User/> establishes the need for added functions by
which the <Self/> accurately perceives the local scene including the <User/>
and autonomously learns to tailor the information services to the speciﬁc
<User/> in the current RF and physical <Scene/>.
3.2.1 iCR Functional Component Architecture
The SDR components and the related cognitive components of iCR appear in
Figure 3.1. The cognition components describe the SDR in Radio XML so that
the <Self/> can know that it is a radio and that its goal is to achieve high QoI
tailored to its own users. RXML intelligence includes a priori radio background
and user stereotypes as well as knowledge of RF and space–time <Scenes/>
perceived and experienced. This includes both structured reasoning with iCR
peers and CWNs, and ad hoc reasoning with users, all the while learning from
experience.
The detailed allocation of functions to components with interfaces among
the components requires closer consideration of the SDR component as the
foundation of CRA.

3.2.2 SDR Components
SDRs include a hardware platform with RF access and computational
resources, plus at least one software-deﬁned personality. The SDR Forum
has deﬁned its Software Communications Architecture (SCA) and the Object
Management Group (OMG) has deﬁned its Software Radio Architecture
(SRA), similar ﬁne-grain architecture constructs enabling reduced cost wire-
less connectivity with next-generation plug and play. These SDR architectures
are deﬁned in Uniﬁed Modeling Language (UML) object models [21], CORBA
Interface Design Language (IDL) [22], and XML descriptions of the UML
models. The SDR Forum’s SCA [23] and OMG SRA [24] standards describe
the technical details of SDR both for radio engineering and for an initial
level of wireless air interface (“waveform”) plug and play. The SCA/SRA was
sketched in 1996 at the ﬁrst DoD-inspired MMITS Forum, developed by the
US DoD in the 1990s and the architecture is now in production for the US
military [25]. This architecture emphasizes plug-and-play wireless personali-
ties on computationally capable mobile nodes where network connectivity is
often intermittent at best.
The commercial wireless community [26], on the other hand, led by cell
phone giants Motorola, Ericsson and Nokia envisions a much simpler archi-
tecture for mobile wireless devices, consisting of two APIs, one for the service
provider and another for the network operator. They deﬁne a knowledge plane
in the future intelligent wireless networks that is not dissimilar from a distrib-
uted CWN. That forum promotes the business model of the user –> service
provider –> network operator –> large manufacturer –> device, where the
user buys mobile devices consistent with services from a service provider,

58
Joseph Mitola III
and the technical emphasis is on intelligence in the network. This per-
spective no doubt will yield computationally intelligent networks in the near-
to mid-term.
The CRA developed in this text, however, envisions the compu-
tational intelligence to create ad hoc and ﬂexible networks with the
intelligence in the mobile device. This technical perspective enables
the business model of user –> device –> heterogeneous networks, typical of
the Internet model where the user buys a device (e.g. a wireless laptop) that
can connect to the Internet via any available Internet Service Provider (ISP).
The CRA builds on both the SCA/SRA and the commercial API model but
integrates Semantic Web intelligence in Radio XML for mobile devices to
enable more of an Internet business model to advance. This chapter describes
how SDR, iCR, and iCR form a continuum facilitated by RXML.
3.2.3 iCR Node Functional Components
The simplest CRA is the minimalist set of functional components of
Figure 3.2. A functional component is a black box to which functions have
been allocated, but for which implementing components do not exist. Thus,
while the Applications component is likely to be primarily software, the
nature of those software components is yet to be determined. User Interface
functions, on the other hand, may include optimized hardware, e.g. for com-
puting video ﬂow vectors in real time to assist scene perception. At the level
of abstraction of the ﬁgure, the components are functional, not physical.
These functional components are
1. The user sensory perception (User SP) interface includes haptic,
acoustic, and video sensing and perception functions,
2. The local environment sensors (location, temperature, accelerometer,
compass, etc.),
3. The system applications (media independent services like playing a
network game),
4. The SDR functions (which include RF sensing and SDR radio applica-
tions),

5. The cognition functions (symbol grounding for system control, planning,
learning) and
6. The local eﬀector functions (speech synthesis, text, graphics, and mul-
timedia displays).
These functional components are embodied on an iCR-Platform, a hardware
realization of the six functions. In order to support the capabilities described
in the prior chapters, these components go beyond SDR in critical ways. First,
the user interface goes well beyond buttons and displays. The traditional user
interface has been partitioned into a substantial user sensory subsystem and
a set of local eﬀectors. The user sensory interface includes buttons (the haptic
interface) and miCRophones (the audio interface) to include acoustic sensing
that is directional, capable of handling multiple speakers simultaneously and
to include full motion video with visual scene perception. In addition, the au-
dio subsystem does not just encode audio for (possible) transmission; it also
parses and interprets the audio from designated speakers such as the <User/>
for a high performance spoken natural language interface. Similarly, the text
subsystem parses and interprets the language to track the user’s information
states, detecting plans and potential communications and information needs
unobtrusively as the user conducts normal activities. The local eﬀectors syn-
thesize speech along with traditional text, graphics, and multimedia displays.
Systems applications are those information services that deﬁne value for
the user. Historically, voice communications with a phone book, text mes-
saging, and the exchange of images or video clips comprised the core value
proposition of systems applications for SDR. These applications were gener-
ally integral to the SDR application, such as data services via GPRS, which is
really a wireless SDR personality more than an information service. iCR sys-
tems applications break the service out of the SDR waveform so that the user
need not deal with details of wireless connectivity unless that is of particular
interest. Should the user care whether he plays the distributed video game via
802.11 or Bluetooth over the last 3 m? Probably not. The typical user might
care if the iCR wants to switch to 3G at $5 per minute, but a particularly
aﬄuent user might not care and would leave all that up to the iCR.
The Cognition component provides all the cognition functions from the
semantic grounding of entities from the perception system to controlling the
overall system through planning and initiating actions, learning user prefer-
ences and RF situations in the process.
Each of these subsystems contains its own processing, local memory, inte-
gral power conversion, built-in-test (BIT) and related technical features.
3.2.4 The Ontological <Self/>
iCR may consist of the six functional components User SP, Environment,
Eﬀectors, SDR, Sys Apps, and Cognition. Equation 3 describes those compo-
nents of the <Self/>, enables external communications and internal reasoning
about the <Self/>, using the RXML syntax.

Equation 3 The iCR <Self/> is deﬁned to be an ideal cognitive radio (iCR)
Platform, consisting of six functional components using the RXML syntax
Given the top-level outline of these functional components along with
the requirement that they be embodied in physical hardware and software
(the “Platform”), the six functional components are deﬁned ontologically
in Equation 3. In part, this equation states that the hardware–software
platform and the functional components of the iCR are independent. Platform-
independent computer languages like Java are well understood. This ontolog-
ical perspective envisions platform-independence as an architecture design
principle for iCR. In other words, the burden is on the (software) func-
tional components to adapt to whatever RF-hardware-OS platform might be
available.
3.2.5 Design Rules Include Functional Component Interfaces
These functional components of Table 3.1 imply associated functional inter-
faces. In architecture, design rules may include a list of the quantities and
types of components as well as the interfaces among those components. This
section addresses the interfaces among the six functional components.
The iCR N-Squared Diagram of Table 3.1 characterizes iCR interfaces.
These constitute and initial set of iCR Applications Programmer Interfaces
– iCR API’s. In some ways these API’s augment the established SDR APIs.
For example, the Cognition API brings a planning capability to SDR. This
is entirely new and much needed in order for basic ACAR’s to accommodate
even the basic ideas of XG.
In other ways, these API’s supersede the existing SDR APIs. In particular,
the SDR user interface becomes the User Sensory and Eﬀector API. User
Sensory API’s include acoustics, voice, and video, while the eﬀectors include
speech synthesis to give the iCR <Self/> its own voice. In addition, wireless
applications are growing rapidly. Voice and short message service become an
ability to exchange images and video clips with ontological tags among wireless
users. The distinctions between cell phone, PDA, and game box continue to
disappear.
These interface changes enable the iCR to sense the situation represented
in the environment, to interact with the user and to access radio networks on
behalf of the user in a situation-aware way.

Interface Notes follow the numbers of the table :
# Interface Note
1. User SP–User SP Cross-media correlation interfaces (video-acoustic,
haptic-speech, etc.) to limit search and reduce uncertainty (e.g. if video
indicates user is not talking, acoustics may be ignored or processed less
aggressively for command inputs than if user is speaking)
2. Environment–User SP Environment sensors parameterize user sensor-
perception. Temperature below freezing may limit video;
3. Sys Apps–User SP Systems Applications may focus scene perception by
identifying entities, range, expected sounds for video, audio, and spatial
perception processing
4. SDR–User SP SDR applications may provide expectations of user input
to the perception system to improve probability of detection and correct
classiﬁcation of perceived inputs
5. Cognition–User SP This is the primary control eﬀerent path from
cognition to the control of the user sensory perception subsystem, control-
ling speech recognition, acoustic signal processing, video processing, and
related sensory perception. Plans from Cognition may set expectations for
user scene perception, improving perception.
6. Eﬀectors–User SP Eﬀectors may supply a replica of the eﬀect to user
perception so that self-generated eﬀects (e.g. synthesized speech) may be
accurately attributed to the <Self/>, validated as having been expressed,
and/or cancelled from the scene perception to limit search.
7. User SP–Environment Perception of rain, buildings, indoor/outdoor
can set GPS integration parameters
8. Environment–Environment Environment sensors would consist of lo-
cation sensing such as GPS or Glonass; temperature of the ambient; light

level to detect inside versus outside locations; possibly smell sensors to
detect spoiled food, ﬁre, etc. There seems to be little beneﬁt to enabling
interfaces among these elements directly.
9. Sys Apps–Environment Data from the systems applications to envi-
ronment sensors would also be minimal.
10. SDR–Environment Data from the SDR personalities to the environ-
ment sensors would be minimal.
11. Cognition–Environment (Primary Control Path) Data from the cog-
nition system to the environment sensors controls those sensors, turning
them on and oﬀ, setting control parameters, and establishing internal
paths from the environment sensors.
12. Eﬀectors–Environment Data from eﬀectors directly to environment
sensors would be minimal.
13. User SP–Sys Apps Data from the user sensory perception system to
systems applications is a primary aﬀerent path for multimedia streams
and entity states that eﬀect information services implemented as systems
applications. Speech, images, and video to be transmitted move along
this path for delivery by the relevant systems application or information
service to the relevant wired or SDR communications path. Sys Apps
overcomes the limitations of individual paths by maintaining continuity
of conversations, data integrity, and application coherence, e.g. for mul-
timedia games. While the cognition function sets up, tears down, and
orchestrates the systems applications, the primary API between the user
scene and the information service consist of this interface and its com-
panions, the environment aﬀerent path; the eﬀector eﬀerent path; and the
SDR aﬀerent and eﬀerent paths.
14. Environment–Sys Apps Data on this path assists systems applications
in providing location-awareness to services.
15. Sys Apps–Sys Apps Diﬀerent information services interoperate by pass-
ing control information through the cognition interfaces and by passing
domain multimedia ﬂows through this interface. The cognition system sets
up and tears down these interfaces.
16. SDR–Sys Apps This is the primary aﬀerent path from external com-
munications to the iCR. It includes control and multimedia information
ﬂows for all the information services. Following the SDR Forum’s SCA,
this path embraces wired as well as wireless interfaces.
17. Cognition–Sys Apps Through this path the iCR <Self/> exerts control
over the information services provided to the <User/>.
18. Eﬀectors–Sys Apps Eﬀectors may provide incidental feedback to in-
formation services through this aﬀerent path, but the use of this path
is deprecated. Information services are supposed to control and obtain
feedback through the mediation of the cognition subsystem.
19. User SP–SDR Although the sensory perception system may send data
directly to the SDR subsystem, e.g. in order to satisfy security rules
that user biometrics must be provided directly to the wireless security

3 Cognitive Radio Architecture
63
subsystem, the use of this path is deprecated. Perception subsystem in-
formation is supposed to be interpreted by the cognition system so that
accurate information can be conveyed to other subsystems, not raw data.
20. Environment–SDR Environment sensors like GPS historically have ac-
cessed SDR waveforms directly, such as providing timing data for air in-
terface signal generation. The cognition system may establish such paths
in cases where cognition provides little or no value added, such as provid-
ing a precise timing reference from GPS to an SDR waveform. The use of
this path is deprecated because all of the environment sensors including
GPS are unreliable. Cognition has the capability to de-glitch GPS, e.g.
recognizing from video that the <Self/> is in an urban canyon and there-
fore not allowing GPS to report directly, but reporting on behalf of GPS
to the GPS subscribers location estimates based perhaps on landmark
correlation, dead reckoning, etc.
21. Sys Apps–SDR This is the primary eﬀerent path from information ser-
vices to SDR through the services API.
22. SDR–SDR The linking of diﬀerent wireless services directly to each other
is deprecated. If an incoming voice service needs to be connected to an
outgoing voice service, then there should be a bridging service in Sys Apps
through which the SDR waveforms communicate with each other. That
service should be set up and taken down by the Cognition system.
23. Cognition–SDR This is the primary control interface, replacing the con-
trol interface of the SDR SCA and the OMG SRA.
24. Eﬀectors–SDR Eﬀectors such as speech synthesis and displays should
not need to provide state information directly to SDR waveforms, but if
needed, the cognition function should set up and tear down these inter-
faces.
25. User SP–Cognition This is the primary aﬀerent ﬂow for the results from
acoustics, speech, images, video, video ﬂow and other sensor-perception
subsystems. The primary results passed across this interface should be the
speciﬁc states of <Entities/> in the scene, which would include scene char-
acteristics such as the recognition of landmarks, known vehicles, furniture
and the like. In other words, this is the interface by which the presence of
<Entities/> in the local scene is established and their characteristics are
made known to the Cognition system.
26. Environment–Cognition This is the primary aﬀerent ﬂow for environ-
ment sensors.
27. Sys Apps–Cognition This is the interface through which information
services request services and receive support from the iCR platform. This
is also the control interface by which Cognition sets up, monitors, and
tears down information services.
28. SDR–Cognition This is the primary aﬀerent interface by which the
state of waveforms, including a distinguished RF-sensor waveform is made
known to the Cognition system. The cognition system can establish pri-
mary and backup waveforms for information services enabling the services

64
Joseph Mitola III
to select paths in real time for low latency services. Those paths are set
up, monitored for quality and validity (e.g. obeying XG rules) by the
cognition system, however.
29. Cognition–Cognition The cognition system as deﬁned in this six com-
ponent architecture entails (1) orienting to information from <RF/> sen-
sors in the SDR subsystem and from scene sensors in the user sensory
perception and environment sensors, (2) planning, (3) making decisions,
and (4) initiating actions, including the control over all of the resources
of the <Self/>. The <User/> may directly control any of the elements
of the systems via paths through the cognition system that enable it to
monitor what the user is doing in order to learn from a user’s direct ac-
tions, such as manually tuning in the user’s favorite radio station when
the <Self/> either failed to do so properly or was not asked.
30. Eﬀectors–Cognition This is the primary aﬀerent ﬂow for status infor-
mation from the eﬀector subsystem, including speech synthesis, displays,
and the like.
31. User SP–Eﬀectors In general, the user sensory-perception system
should not interface directly to the eﬀectors, but should be routed through
the cognition system for observation.
32. Environment–Eﬀectors The environment system should not interface
directly to the eﬀectors. This path is deprecated.
33. Sys Apps–Eﬀectors Systems applications may display streams, gener-
ate speech, and otherwise directly control any eﬀectors once the paths and
constraints have been established by the cognition subsystem.
34. SDR–Eﬀectors This path may be used if the cognition system estab-
lishes a path, such as from an SDR’s voice track to a speaker. Generally,
however, the SDR should provide streams to the information services of
the Sys Apps. This path may be necessary for legacy compatibility during
the migration from SDR through iCR to iCR but is deprecated.
35. Cognition–Eﬀectors This is the primary eﬀerent path for the control
of eﬀectors. Information services provide the streams to the eﬀectors, but
cognition sets them up, establishes paths, and monitors the information
ﬂows for support to the user’s <Need/> or intent.
36. Eﬀectors–Eﬀectors These paths are deprecated, but may be needed for
legacy compatibility.
The above information ﬂows aggregated into an initial set of iCR APIs
deﬁne an Information Services API by which an information service accesses
the other ﬁve components (ISAPI consisting of interfaces 13–18, 21, 27, and
33). They would also deﬁne a Cognition API by which the cognition system
obtains status and exerts control over the rest of the system (CAPI consisting
of interfaces 25–30, 5, 11, 23, and 35). Although the constituent interfaces of
these APIs are suggested in the table, it would be premature to deﬁne these
APIs without ﬁrst developing detailed information ﬂows and interdependen-
cies, which are deﬁned in this chapter and analyzed in the remainder of this

3 Cognitive Radio Architecture
65
chapter. It would also be premature to develop such APIs without a clear
idea of the kinds of RF and User domain knowledge and performance that
are expected of the iCR architecture over time. These aspects are developed
in the balance of the text, enabling one to draw some conclusions about these
API’s in the ﬁnal chapters.
A fully deﬁned set of interfaces and APIs would be circumscribed in
RXML. For the moment, any of the interfaces of the N-squared diagram may
be used as needed.
3.2.6 Near Term Implementations
One way to implement this set of functions is to embed into an SDR a rea-
soning engine such as a rule base with an associated inference engine as the
Cognition Function. If the Eﬀector Functions control parts of the radio, then
we have the simplest iCR based on the simple six component architecture of
Figure 3.1. Such an approach may be suﬃcient to expand the control para-
digm from today’s state machines with limited ﬂexibility to tomorrow’s iCR
control based on reasoning over more complex RF states and user situations.
Such simple approaches may well be the next practical steps in iCR evolution
from SDR towards iCR.
This incremental step doesn’t suggest how to mediate the interfaces bet-
ween multi-sensory perception and situation-sensitive prior experience and
a priori knowledge to achieve situation-dependent radio control that enables
the more sophisticated information services of the use cases. In addition, such
a simple architecture does not pro-actively allocate machine learning func-
tions to fully understood components. For example, will autonomous machine
learning require an embedded radio propagation modeling tool? If so, then
what is the division of function between a rule base that knows about radio
propagation and a propagation tool that can predict values like RSSI? Simi-
larly, in the user domain, some aspects of user behavior may be modeled in
detail based on physics, such as movement by foot and in vehicles. Will move-
ment modeling be a separate subsystem based on physics and GPS? How will
that work inside of buildings? How is the knowledge and skill in tracking user
movements divided between physics-based computational modeling and the
symbolic inference of a rule base or set of Horn clauses [34] with a Prolog
engine? For that matter, how will the learning architecture accommodate a
variety of learning methods like neural networks, PROLOG, forward chaining,
SVM if learning occurs entirely in a cognition subsystem?
While hiding such details may be a good thing for iCR in the near term,
it may severely limit the mass customization needed for iCRs to learn user
patterns and thus to deliver RF services dramatically better than mere SDRs.
Thus, we need to go “inside” the cognition and perception subsystems further
to establish more of a ﬁne-grained architecture. This enables one to structure
the data sets and functions that mediate multi-sensory domain perception
of complex scenes and related learning technologies that can autonomously

66
Joseph Mitola III
adapt to user needs and preferences. The sequel thus pro-actively addresses the
embedding of Machine Learning (ML) technology into the radio architecture.
Next, consider the networks. Network-independent SDRs retain multiple
personalities in local storage, while network-dependent SDRs receive alter-
nate personalities from a supporting network infrastructure – CWNs. High-
end SDRs both retain alternate personalities locally and have the ability to
validate and accept personalities by download from trusted sources. What-
ever architecture emerges must be consistent with the distribution of RXML
knowledge aggregated in a variety of networks from a tightly-coupled CWN
to the Internet, with a degree of <Authority/> and trust reﬂecting the prag-
matics of such diﬀerent repositories.
The ﬁrst two sections of this chapter therefore set the stage for the deve-
lopment of CRA. The next three sections address the cognition cycle, the
inference hierarchies, and the SDR architecture embedded both into the CRA
with the knowledge structures of the CRA.
3.2.7 The Cognition Components
Figure 3.1 above, shows three computational-intelligence aspects of CR:
1. Radio Knowledge – RXML:RF
2. User Knowledge – RXML:User
3. The Capacity to Learn
The minimalist architecture of Figure 3.2, and the functional interfaces of the
subsequent table do not assist the radio engineer in structuring knowledge, nor
does it assist much in integrating machine learning into the system. The ﬁne-
grained architecture developed in this chapter, on the other hand, is derived
from the functional requirements to fully develop these three core capabilities.
3.2.8 Radio Knowledge in the Architecture
Radio knowledge has to be translated from the classroom and engineering
teams into a body of computationally accessible, structured technical knowl-
edge about radio. Radio XML is the primary enabler and product of this foray
into formalization of radio knowledge. This text starts a process of RXML deﬁ-
nition and development that can only be brought to fruition by industry over
time. This process is similar to the evolution of the Software Communications
Architecture (SCA) of the SDR Forum [23]. The SCA structures the technical
knowledge of the radio components into UML and XML. RXML will enable
the structuring of suﬃcient RF and user world knowledge to build advanced
wireless-enabled or enhanced information services. Thus while the SRA and
SCA focus on building radios, RXML focuses on using radios.
The World Wide Web is now sprouting with computational ontologies
some of which are non-technical but include radio, such as the open CYC

3 Cognitive Radio Architecture
67
ontology [27]. They bring the radio domain into the Semantic Web, which
helps people know about radio. This informal knowledge lacks the technical
scope, precision and accuracy of authoritative radio references such as the
ETSI documents deﬁning GSM and ITU deﬁnitions, e.g. of 3GPP.
Not only must radio knowledge be precise, it must be stated at a useful
level of abstraction, yet with the level of detail appropriate to the use-case.
Thus, ETSI GSM in most cases would over-kill the level of detail without pro-
viding suﬃcient knowledge of the user-centric functionality of GSM. In addi-
tion, iCR is multi-band, multi-mode radio (MBMMR), so the knowledge must
be comprehensive, addressing the majority of radio bands and modes avail-
able to a MBMMR. Therefore, in the development of CR technology below,
this text captures radio knowledge needed for competent CR in the MBMMR
bands from HF through millimeter wave. This knowledge is formalized with
precision that should be acceptable to ETSI, the ITU and Regulatory Autho-
rities (RAs) yet at a level of abstraction appropriate to internal reasoning,
formal dialog with a CWN or informal dialog with users.
This kind of knowledge is to be captured in RXML:RF.
The capabilities required for an iCR node to be a cognitive entity are to
sense, perceive, orient, plan, decide, act, and learn. To relate ITU standards to
these required capabilities is a process of extracting content from highly for-
malized knowledge bases that exist in a unique place and that bear substantial
authority, encapsulating that knowledge in less complete and therefore some-
what approximate form that can be reasoned with on the iCR node and in
real time to support RF-related use cases. Table 3.2 illustrates this process.
The table is illustrative and not comprehensive, but it characterizes the
technical issues that drive an information-oriented iCR node architecture.
Where ITU, ETSI . . . (meaning other regional and local standards bodies)
and CWN supply source knowledge, the CWN is the repository for authorita-
tive knowledge derived from the standards bodies and Regulatory Authorities
(RAs), the <Authorities/>. A user-oriented iCR may note diﬀerences in the
interpretation of source knowledge from <Authorities/> between alternate
CWNs, precipitating further knowledge exchanges.
3.2.9 User Knowledge in the Architecture
Next, user knowledge is formalized at the level of abstraction and degree of
detail necessary to give the CR the ability to acquire from its Owner and
other designated users, the user-knowledge relevant to information services
incrementally. Incremental knowledge acquisition was motivated in the intro-
duction to AML by describing how frequent occurrences with similar activity
sequences identiﬁes learning opportunities. AML machines may recog-
nize these opportunities for learning through joint probability statistics
<Histogram/>. Eﬀective use-cases clearly identify the classes of user and the
speciﬁc knowledge learned to customize envisioned services. Use cases may

This knowledge is deﬁned in RXML:User. As with RF knowledge, the
capabilities required for an iCR node to be a cognitive entity are to observe
(sense, perceive), orient, plan, decide, act, and learn. To relate a use case to
these capabilities, one extracts speciﬁc and easily recognizable <Anchors/>
for stereotypical situations observable in diverse times, places, and situations.
One expresses the anchor knowledge in using RXML for use on the iCR node.
3.2.10 Cross-domain Grounding for Flexible Information Services
The knowledge about radio and about user needs for wireless services must
be expressed internally in a consistent form so that information services rela-
tionships may be autonomously discovered and maintained by the <Self/> on
behalf of the <User/>. Relationships among user and RF domains are shown
in Figure 3.3).

Figure c⃝Dr. Joseph Mitola III, used with permission
Fig. 3.3. Discovering and maintaining services.
Staying better connected requires the normalization of knowledge between
<User> and <RF> domains. If, for example, the <User/> says “What’s on
one oh seven – seven,” near the Washington, DC area, then the dynamic
<User/> ontology should enable the CR to infer that the user is talking
about the current FM radio broadcast, the units are in MHz and the user
wants to know what is on WTOP. If it can’t infer this, then it should ask
the user or discover by ﬁrst dialing a reasonable default, such as 107.7 FM,
a broadcast radio station and asking “Is this the radio station you want?”
Steps 4, 5, and 6 in the ﬁgure all beneﬁt from agreement across domains
on how to refer to radio services. Optimizing behavior to best support the
user requires continually adapting the <User> ontology with repeated re-
grounding of terms in the <User/> domain to conceptual primitives and
actions in the <RF/> domain.
The CRA facilitates this by seeding the speech recognition subsystem with
the most likely expressions a particular <User/> employs when referring to
information services. These would be acquired from the speciﬁc users via text
and speech recognition, with dialogs oriented towards continual grounding
by posing yes/no questions, either verbally or in displays or both, obtaining
reinforcement verbally or via haptic interaction or both. The required degree
of mutual grounding would beneﬁt from speciﬁc grounding-oriented features
in the iCR information architecture, developed below.
The process of linking user expressions of interest to the appropriate radio
technical operations sometimes may be extremely diﬃcult. Military radios,
for example, have many technical parameters. For example, a “channel” in
SINCGARS consists of de-hopped digital voice in one context (voice commu-
nications) or a 25 kHz band of spectrum in another context (and that may be

70
Joseph Mitola III
either an FM channel into which its frequency hop waveform has hopped or an
FDMA channel when in single channel mode). If the user says “Give me the
Commander’s Channel” the SINCGARS user is talking about a “de-hopped
CVSD voice stream.” If the same user a few seconds later says “This sounds
awful. Who else is in this channel?” the user is referring to interference with
a collection of hop sets. If the CR observes “There is strong interference in
almost half of your assigned channels,” then the CR is referring to a related
set of 25 kHz channels. If the user then says “OK, notch the strongest 3
interference channels” he is talking about a diﬀerent subset of the channels.
If in the next breath the user says “Is anything on our emergency channel?”
then the user has switched from SINCGARS context to <Self/> context, ask-
ing about one of the cognitive military radio’s physical RF access channels.
The complexity of such exchanges demands cross-domain grounding; and the
necessity of communicating accurately under stress motivates a structured
Natural Language (NL) and rich radio ontology aspects of the architecture
developed further below.
Thus, both commercial and military information services entail cross-
domain grounding with ontology oriented to NL in the <User> domain and
oriented to RXML formalized a priori knowledge in the <RF> domain. Spe-
ciﬁc methods of cross-domain grounding with associated architectural features
include:
1. <RF> to <User> Shaping dialog to express precise <RF> con-
cepts to non-expert users in an intuitive way, such as
a. Grounding: “If you move the speaker box a little bit, it can make a big
diﬀerence in how well the remote speaker is connected to the wireless
transmitter on the TV.”
b. iCR Information Architecture: Include facility for rich set of syn-
onyms to mediate cognition-NL-synthesis interface (<Antenna>∼=
<Wireless-remote-speaker>∼= “Speaker box”).
2. <RF> to <User> Learning jargon to express <RF> connectivity
opportunities in <User> terms.
a. Grounding: “tee oh pee” for “WTOP,” “Hot ninety two” for FM 97.7,
“Guppy” for “E2C Echo Grand on 422.1 MHz.”
b. iCR Information Architecture: NL-visual facility for single-instance
update of user jargon.
3. <User> to <RF> Relating values to actions: Relate <User> ex-
pression of values (“low cost”) to features of situations (“normal”) that are
computable (<NOT> (<CONTAINS><Situation><Unusual/>)) and
that relate directly to <RF> domain decisions
a. Grounding: Normally wait for free WLAN for big attachment; if situ-
ation is <unusual>, ask if user wants to pay for 3G.
b. iCR Information Architecture: Associative inference hierarchy that
relates observable features of a <Scene> to user sensitivities, such
as <Late-for-work>=><Unusual>; “The President of the company

3 Cognitive Radio Architecture
71
needs this” =><Unusual> because “President” =><VIP> and
<VIP> is not in most scenes.
3.2.11 Self-Referential Components
The Cognition component must assess, manage, and control all of its own
resources, including validating downloads. Thus, in addition to <RF> and
<User> domains, RXML must describe the <Self/>, deﬁning the iCR archi-
tecture to the iCR itself in RXML.
3.2.12 Self-Referential Inconsistency
This class of self-referential reasoning is well known in the theory of com-
puting to be a potential black hole for computational resources. Speciﬁcally,
any Turing-Capable (TC) computational entity that reasons about itself can
encounter unexpected G¨odel–Turing situations from which it cannot recover.
Thus TC systems are known to be “partial” – only partially deﬁned because
the result obtained when attempting to execute certain classes of procedure
are not deﬁnable because the computing procedure will never terminate.
To avoid this paradox, CR architecture mandates the use of only “to-
tal” functions, typically restricted to bounded-minimalization [28]. Watch-
dog “step-counting” functions [29] or timers must be in place in all its self-
referential reasoning and radio functions. The timer and related computation-
ally indivisible control construct is equivalent to the computer-theoretic con-
struct of a step-counting function over “ﬁnite minimalization.” It has been
proven that computations that are limited with certain classes of reliable
watchdog timers on ﬁnite computing resources can avoid the G¨odel–Turing
paradox or at least reduce it to the reliability of the timer. This proof is the
fundamental theorem for practical self-modifying systems.
Brieﬂy: If a system can compute in advance the amount of time or the
number of instructions that any given computation should take, then if that
time or step-count is exceeded, the procedure returns a ﬁxed result such as
“Unreachable in Time T.” As long as the algorithm does not explicitly or im-
plicitly re-start itself on the same problem, then with the associated invocation
of a tightly time- and computationally-constrained alternative tantamount to
giving up, it
(a) is not Turing capable, but
(b) is suﬃciently computationally capable to perform real-time communica-
tions tasks such as transmitting and receiving data as well as bounded
user interface functions, and
(c) is not susceptible to the Turing–G¨odel incompleteness dilemma and thus
(d) will not crash because of consuming unbounded or unpredictable resources
in unpredictable self-referential loops.

72
Joseph Mitola III
This is not a general result. This is a highly radio domain-speciﬁc result
that has been established only for isochronous communications domains in
which
(a) Processes are deﬁned in terms of a priori tightly bounded time epochs
such as CDMA frames and SS7 time-outs and
(b) For every situation, there is a default action that has been identiﬁed in
advance that consumes O(1) resources, and
(c) The watchdog timer or step-counting function is reliable.
Since radio air interfaces transmit and receive data, there are always defaults
such as “repeat the last packed” or “clear the buﬀer” that may degrade the
performance of the overall communications system. A default has O (1) com-
plexity and the layers of the protocol stack can implement the default without
using unbounded computing resources.
3.2.13 Watchdog Timer
Without the reliable watchdog timer in the architecture and without this proof
to establish the rules for acceptable computing constructs on cognitive radios,
engineers and computer programmers would build CRs that would crash in
extremely unpredictable ways as their adaptation algorithms get trapped in
unpredictable unbounded self-referential loops. Since there are planning prob-
lems that can’t be solved with algorithms so constrained, either an unbounded
community of CR’s must cooperatively work on the more general problems or
the CN must employ a Turing capable algorithm to solve the harder problems
(e.g. NP-hard with large N) oﬀline. There is also the interesting possibility of
trading oﬀspace and time by remembering partial solutions and re-starting
NP-hard problems with these sub-problems already solved. While it doesn’t
actually avoid any necessary calculations, with O(N) pattern matching for
solved subproblems, it may reduce the total computational burden, some-
what like the FFT which converts O(N2) steps to O(N log N) by avoiding
the re-computation of already computed partial products. This class of ap-
proach to parallel problem solving is similar to the use of pheromones by ants
to solve the traveling salesman problem in less than (2N)/M time with M
ants. Since this is an engineering text, not a text on the theory of computing,
these aspects are not developed further here, but it suﬃces to show the pre-
dictable ﬁniteness and proof that the approach is boundable and hence com-
patible with the real-time performance needs of cognitive radio.
This timer-based ﬁnite computing regime also works for user interfaces
since users will not wait forever before changing the situation e.g. by shutting
the radio oﬀor hitting another key; and the CR can always kind of throw up
its hands and ask the user to take over.
Thus, with a proof of stability based on the theory of computing, the CRA
structures systems that not only can modify themselves, but can do it in such

3 Cognitive Radio Architecture
73
a way that they are not likely to induce non-recoverable crashes from the
“partial” property of self-referential computing.
3.2.14 Flexible Functions of the Component Architecture
Although this chapter develops the six-element component architecture of a
particular information architecture and one reference implementation, there
are many possible architectures. The purpose is not to try to sell a particu-
lar architecture, but to illustrate the architecture principles. The CRA and
research implementation, CR1 [11], therefore, oﬀer open-source licensing for
non-commercial educational purposes.
Table 3.3 further diﬀerentiates architecture features.
These functions of the architecture are not diﬀerent from those of the six-
component architecture, but represent varying degrees of instantiation of the
six components. Consider the following degrees of architecture instantiations:
Cognition functions of radio entail the monitoring and structuring
knowledge of the behavior patterns of the <Self/>, the <User>, and the envi-
ronment (physical, user situation and radio) in order to provide information
services, learning from experience to tailor services to user preferences and
diﬀering radio environments.
Adaptation functions of radio respond to a changing environment,
but can be achieved without learning if the adaptation is pre-programmed.
Awareness functions of radio extract usable information from a
sensor domain. Awareness stops short of perception. Awareness is required
for adaptation, but awareness does not guarantee adaptation. For example,

embedding a GPS receiver into a cell phone makes the phone more location-
aware, but unless the value of the current location is actually used by the
phone to do something that is location-dependent, the phone is not location-
adaptive, only location aware. These functions are a subset of the CRA that
enable adaptation.
P erception functions of radio
continuously
identify
and
track
knowns, unknowns and backgrounds in a given sensor domain. Backgrounds
are subsets of a sensory domain that share common features that entail no
particular relevance to the functions of the radio. For a CR that learns initially
to be a single-Owner-radio, in a crowd, the Owner is the object that the radio
continuously tracks in order to interact when needed. Worn from a belt as a
Cognitive Wireless Personal Digital Assistant (CWPDA), the iCR perception
functions may track the entities in the scene. The non-Owner entities com-
prise mostly irrelevant background because no matter what interactions may
be oﬀered by these entities, the CR will not obey them, just the perceived
owner. These functions are a subset of the CRA that enable cognition.
T he sensory functions of radio entail those hardware and/or soft-
ware capabilities that enable a radio to measure features of a sensory domain.
Sensory domains include anything that can be sensed, such as audio, video,
vibration, temperature, time, power, fuel level, ambient light level, sun angle
(e.g. through polarization), barometric pressure, smell, and anything else you
might imagine. Sensory domains for vehicular radios may be much richer
if less personal than those of wearable radios. Sensory domains for ﬁxed
infrastructure could include weather features such as ultra-violet sunlight,
wind direction and speed, humidity, traﬃc ﬂow rate, or rain rate. These func-
tions are a subset of the CRA that enable perception.
The Platform Independent Model (PIM) in the Uniﬁed Modeling Language
(UML) of SDR [30] provides a convenient, industry-standard computational
model that an iCR can use to describe the SDR and computational resource
aspects of its own internal structure, as well as describing facilities that enable
radio functions. The general structure of hardware and software by which a
CR reasons about the <Self/> in its world is also part of its architecture
deﬁned in the SDR SCA/SRA as resources.
3.3 CRA II: The Cognition Cycle
The Cognitive Radio Architecture (CRA) consists of a set of design rules by
which the cognitive level of information services may be achieved by a spec-
iﬁed set of components in a way that supports the cost-eﬀective evolution
of increasingly capable implementations over time [11]. The cognition sub-
system of the architecture includes an inference hierarchy and the temporal
organization and ﬂow of inferences and control states, the cognition cycle.

3 Cognitive Radio Architecture
75
3.3.1 The Cognition Cycle
The cognition cycle developed for CR1 [11] is illustrated in Figure 3.4. This
cycle implements the capabilities required of iCR in a reactive sequence. Stim-
uli enter the cognitive radio as sensory interrupts, dispatched to the cognition
cycle for a response. Such an iCR continually observes (senses and perceives)
the environment, orients itself, creates plans, decides, and then acts. In a
single-processor inference system, the CR’s ﬂow of control may also move in
the cycle from observation to action. In a multi-processor system, temporal
structures of sensing, preprocessing, reasoning, and acting may be parallel
and complex. Special features synchronize the inferences of each phase. The
tutorial code of [7] all works on a single processor in a rigid inference seq-
uence deﬁned in the ﬁgure. This process is called the Wake Epoch because
the primary reasoning activities during this large epoch of time are reactive
to the environment. We will refer to “sleep epochs” for power down condition,
“dream epochs” for performing computationally intensive pattern recognition
and learning, and “prayer epochs” for interacting with a higher authority such
as network infrastructure.
During the wake epoch, the receipt of a new stimulus on any of a CR’s
sensors or the completion of a prior cognition cycle initiates a new primary
cognition cycle. The cognitive radio observes its environment by parsing in-
coming information streams. These can include monitoring and speech-to-text

conversion of radio broadcasts, e.g. the weather channel, stock ticker tapes,
etc. Any RF-LAN or other short-range wireless broadcasts that provide envi-
ronment awareness information may be also parsed. In the observation phase,
a CR also reads location, temperature, and light level sensors, etc. to infer
the user’s communications context.
3.3.2 Observe (Sense and Perceive)
The iCR senses and perceives the environment (via “Observation Phase” code)
by accepting multiple stimuli in many dimensions simultaneously and by bind-
ing these stimuli – all together or more typically in subsets – to prior experi-
ence so that it can subsequently detect time-sensitive stimuli and ultimately
generate plans for action.
Thus, iCR continuously aggregates experience and compares prior aggre-
gates to the current situation. A CR may aggregate experience by remem-
bering everything. This may not seem like a very smart thing to do until you
calculate that all the audio, unique images, and emails the radio might experi-
ence in a year only takes up a few hundred gigabytes of memory, depending on
image detail. So the computational architecture for remembering and rapidly
correlating current experience against everything known previously is a core
capability of the CRA. A novelty detector identiﬁes new stimuli, using the
new aspects of partially familiar stimuli to identify incremental learning prim-
itives.
In the six-component (User SP, Environment, Eﬀectors, SDR, Sys Apps,
and Cognition) functional view of the architecture deﬁned above, the Observe
phase comprises both the User Sensory and Perception (User SP) and the
Environment (RF and physical) sensor subsystems. The subsequent Orient
phase is part of the Cognition component in this model of architecture.
3.3.3 Orient
The “Orient Phase” determines the signiﬁcance of an observation by binding
the observation to a previously known set of stimuli of a “scene.”
The Orient phase contains the internal data structures that constitute the
equivalent of the Short-Term Memory (STM) that people use to engage in a
dialog without necessarily remembering everything with the same degree of
long-term memory. Typically people need repetition to retain information over
the long term. The natural environment supplies the information redundancy
needed to instigate transfer from STM to Long-Term Memory (LTM). In the
CRA, the transfer from STM to LTM is mediated by the sleep cycle in which
the contents of STM since the last sleep cycle are analyzed both internally and
with respect to existing LTM. How to do this robustly remains an important
CR research topic, but the overall framework is deﬁned in CRA.
Matching of current stimuli to stored experience may be achieved by stim-
ulus recognition or by “binding.” The orient phase is the ﬁrst collection of
activity in the cognition component.

Stimulus Recognition
Stimulus recognition occurs when there is an exact match between a current
stimulus and a prior experience. CR1 is continually recognizing exact matches
and recording the number of exact matches that occurred along with the time
in number of cognition cycles between the last exact match. By default, the
response to a given stimulus is to merely repeat that stimulus to the next
layer up the inference hierarchy for aggregation of the raw stimuli. But if the
system has been trained to respond to a location, a word, an RF condition, a
signal on the power bus, etc., then it may either react immediately or plan a
task in reaction to the detected stimulus. If that reaction were in error, then it
may be trained to ignore the stimulus given the larger context which consists
of all the stimuli and relevant internal states, including time.
Sometimes, the Orient Phase causes an action to be initiated immedi-
ately as a “reactive” stimulus-response behavior. A power failure, for exam-
ple, might directly invoke an act that saves the data (the “Immediate” path
to the Act Phase in the ﬁgure). A non-recoverable loss of signal on a network
might invoke reallocation of resources, e.g. from parsing input to searching
for alternative RF channels. This may be accomplished via the path labeled
“Urgent” in the ﬁgure.
Binding
The binding occurs when there is a nearly exact match between a current
stimulus and a prior experience and very general criteria for applying the
prior experience to the current situation are met. One such criterion is the
number of unmatched features of the current scene. If only one feature is
unmatched and the scene occurs at a high level such as the phrase or dialog
level of the inference hierarchy, then binding is the ﬁrst step in generating
a plan for behaving similarly in the given state as in the last occurrence of
the stimuli. In addition to numbers of features that match exactly, which is
a kind of Hamming code, Instance-Based Learning (IBL) supports inexact
matching and binding. Binding also determines the priority associated with
the stimuli. Better binding yields higher priority for autonomous learning,
while less eﬀective binding yields lower priority for the incipient plan.
3.3.4 Plan
Most stimuli are dealt with “deliberatively” rather than “reactively.” An
incoming network message would normally be dealt with by generating a plan
(in the Plan Phase, the “Normal” path). Planning includes plan generation.
In research-quality or industrial-strength CR’s, formal models of causality
must be embedded into planning tools [31]. The Plan phase should also in-
clude reasoning about time. Typically, reactive responses are pre-programmed
or deﬁned by a network (the CR is “told” what to do), while other behaviors

78
Joseph Mitola III
might be planned. A stimulus may be associated with a simple plan as a
function of planning parameters with a simple planning system. Open source
planning tools enable the embedding of planning subsystems into the CRA,
enhancing the Plan component. Such tools enable the synthesis of RF and in-
formation access behaviors in a goal-oriented way based on perceptions from
the visual, audio, text, and RF domains as well as Regulatory Authority (RA)
rules and previously learned user preferences.
3.3.5 Decide
The “Decide” phase selects among the candidate plans. The radio might have
the choice to alert the user to an incoming message (e.g. behaving like a pager)
or to defer the interruption until later (e.g. behaving like a secretary who is
screening calls during an important meeting).
3.3.6 Act
“Acting” initiates the selected processes using eﬀector modules. Eﬀectors may
access the external world or the CR’s internal states.
Externally Oriented Actions
Access to the external world consists primarily of composing messages to
be spoken into the local environment or expressed in text from locally or
to another CR or CN using KQML, RKRL, OWL, RXML, or some other
appropriate knowledge interchange standard.
Internally Oriented Actions
Actions on internal states include controlling machine-controllable resources
such as radio channels. The CR can also aﬀect the contents of existing internal
models, e.g. by adding a model of stimulus-experience-response (serModel) to
an existing internal model structure [13]. The new concept itself may assert
related concepts into the scene. Multiple independent sources of the same
concept in a scene reinforce that concept for that scene. These models may
be asserted by the <Self/> to encapsulate experience. The experience may be
reactively integrated into RXML knowledge structures as well, provided the
reactive response encodes them properly.
3.3.7 Learning
Learning is a function of perception, observations, decisions and actions. Ini-
tial learning is mediated by the Observe-phase perception hierarchy in which
all sensory perceptions are continuously matched against all prior stimuli to

3 Cognitive Radio Architecture
79
continually count occurrences and to remember time since last occurrence of
the stimuli from primitives to aggregates.
Learning also occurs through the introduction of new internal models in
response to existing models and CBR bindings. In general, there are many
opportunities to integrate ML into iCR. Each of the phases of the cognition
cycle oﬀers multiple opportunities for discovery processes like <Histogram>
above, as well as many other ML approaches to be developed below. Since the
architecture includes internal reinforcement via counting occurrences and via
serModels, ML with uncertainty is also supported in the architecture.
Finally, there is a learning mechanism that occurs when a new type of
serModel is created in response to an Action to instantiate an internally gen-
erated serModel. For example, prior and current internal states may be com-
pared with expectations to learn about the eﬀectiveness of a communications
mode, instantiating a new mode-speciﬁc serModel.
3.3.8 Self Monitoring Timing
Each of the prior phases must consist of computational structures for which
the execution time may be computed in advance. In addition, each phase must
restrict its computations to consume not more resources (time × allocated
processing capacity) than the pre-computed upper bound. Therefore, the
architecture has some prohibitions and some data set requirements needed to
obtain an acceptable degree of stability of behavior for CR as self-referential
self-modifying systems.
Since First Order Predicate Calculus (FOPC) used in some reasoning sys-
tems is not decidable, one cannot in general compute in advance how much
time an FOPC expression will take to run to completion. There may be loops
that will preclude this, and even with loop detection, the time to resolve an
expression may be only loosely approximated as an exponential function of
some parameters (such as the number of statements in the FOPC data base
of assertions and rules). Therefore unrestricted FOPC is not allowed.
Similarly, unrestricted For, Until and While loops are prohibited. In place
of such loops are bounded iterations in which the time required for the loop
to execute is computed or supplied independent of the computations that de-
termine the iteration control of the loop. This seemingly unnatural act can be
facilitated by next-generation compilers and CASE tools. Since self-referential
self-modifying code is prohibited by structured design and programming prac-
tices, there are no such tools on the market today. But since CR is inherently
self-referential and self-modifying, such tools most likely will emerge, perhaps
assisted by the needs of CR and the architecture framework of the cognition
cycle.
Finally, the cognition cycle itself can’t contain internal loops. Each iter-
ation of the cycle must take a deﬁned amount of time, just as each frame
of a 3G air interface takes 10 milliseconds. As CR computational platforms
continue to progress, the amount of computational work done within the

80
Joseph Mitola III
cycle will increase, but under no conditions should explicit or implicit loops
be introduced into the cognition cycle that would extend it beyond a given
cycle time.
3.3.9 Retrospection
Since the assimilation of knowledge by machine learning can be computation-
ally intensive, cognitive radio has “sleep” and “prayer” epochs that support
machine learning. A sleep epoch is a relatively long period of time (e.g. minutes
to hours) during which the radio will not be in use, but has suﬃcient electrical
power for processing. During the sleep epoch, the radio can run machine learn-
ing algorithms without detracting from its ability to support its user’s needs.
Machine learning algorithms may integrate experience by aggregating statisti-
cal parameters. The sleep epoch may re-run stimulus–response sequences with
new learning parameters in the way that people dream. The sleep cycle could
be less anthropomorphic, employing a genetic algorithm to explore a rugged
ﬁtness landscape, potentially improving the decision parameters from recent
experience.
3.3.10 Reaching Out
Learning opportunities not resolved in the sleep epoch can be brought to the
attention of the user, the host network, or a designer during a prayer epoch.
The sleep and prayer epochs are possibilities.
3.4 CRA III: The Inference Hierarchy
The phases of inference from observation to action show the ﬂow of inference, a
top-down view of how cognition is implemented algorithmically. The inference
hierarchy is the part of the algorithm architecture that organizes the data
structures. Inference hierarchies have been in use since Hearsay II in the 1970s,
but the CR hierarchy is unique in its method of integrating machine learning
with real-time performance during the Wake Epochs. An illustrative inference
hierarchy includes layers from atomic stimuli at the bottom to information
clusters that deﬁne action contexts as in Figure 3.5.
The pattern of accumulating elements into sequences begins at the bottom
of the hierarchy. Atomic stimuli originate in the external environment includ-
ing RF, acoustic, image, and location domains among others. The atomic sym-
bols extracted from them are the most primitive symbolic units in the domain.
In speech, the most primitive elements are the phonemes. In the exchange of
textual data (e.g. in email), the symbols are the typed characters. In images,
the atomic symbols may be the individual picture elements (pixels) or they
may be small groups of pixels with similar hue, intensity, texture, etc.

Fig. 3.5. Standard Inference Hierarchy.
A related set of atomic symbols forms a primitive sequence. Words in text,
tokens from a speech tokenizer, and objects in images (or individual image
regions in a video ﬂow) are the primitive sequences. Primitive sequences have
spatial and/or temporal coincidence, standing out against the background (or
noise), but there may be no particular meaning in that pattern of coincidence.
Basic sequences, on the other hand, are space–time–spectrum sequences that
entail the communication of discrete messages.
These discrete messages (e.g. phrases) are typically deﬁned with respect to
an ontology of the primitive sequences (e.g. deﬁnitions of words). Sequences
cluster together because of shared properties. For examples, phrases that in-
clude words like “hit,” “pitch,” “ball,” and “out” may be associated with a
discussion of a baseball game. Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD)
and the Semantic Web oﬀer approaches for deﬁning, or inferring the presence
of such clusters from primitive and basic sequences.
A scene is a context cluster, a multi-dimensional space–time–frequency
association, such as a discussion of a baseball game in the living room on
a Sunday afternoon. Such clusters may be inferred from unsupervised ma-
chine learning, e.g. using statistical methods or nonlinear approaches such as
Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Although presented above in a bottom-up fashion, there is no reason to
limit multi-dimensional inference to the top layers of the inference hierarchy.
The lower levels of the inference hierarchy may include correlated multi-sensor
data. For example, a word may be characterized as a primitive acoustic seq-
uence coupled to a primitive sequence of images of a person speaking that
word. In fact, since infants seem to thrive on multi-sensory stimulation, the
key to reliable machine learning may be the use of multiple sensors with multi-
sensor correlation at the lowest levels of abstraction.
Each of these levels of the inference hierarchy is now discussed further.

82
Joseph Mitola III
3.4.1 Atomic Stimuli
Atomic stimuli originate in the external environment and are sensed and pre-
processed by the sensory subsystems which include sensors of the RF envi-
ronment (e.g. radio receiver and related data and information processing) and
of the local physical environment including acoustic, video, and location sen-
sors. Atomic symbols are the elementary stimuli extracted from the atomic
stimuli. Atomic symbols may result from a simple noise-riding threshold algo-
rithm, such as the squelch circuit in RF that diﬀerentiates signal from noise.
Acoustic signals may be diﬀerentiated from simple background noise this way,
but generally the result is the detection of a relatively large speech epoch
which contains various kinds of speech energy. Thus, further signal processing
is typically required in a preprocessing subsystem to isolate atomic symbols.
The transformation from atomic stimuli to atomic symbols is the job of
the sensory preprocessing system. Thus, for example, acoustic signals may be
transformed into phoneme hypotheses by an acoustic signal pre-processor.
However, some speech-to-text software tools may not enable this level of
interface via an API. To develop industrial strength CR, contemporary speech-
to-text and video processing software tools are needed. Speech to text tools
yield an errorful transcript in response to a set of atomic stimuli. Thus, the
speech to text tool is an example of a mapping from atomic stimuli to basic
sequences. One of the important contributions of architecture is to identify
such maps and to deﬁne the role of the level mapping tools.
Image processing software available for the Wintel-Java development en-
vironment JBuilder has the ability to extract objects from images and video
clips. In addition, research such as that of Goodman et al. deﬁnes algorithms
for what the AAAI calls cognitive vision [32].
But there is nothing about the inference hierarchy that forces data from
a pre-processing system to be entered at the lowest level. In order for the
more primitive symbolic abstractions such as atomic symbols to be related
to more aggregate abstractions, one may either build up the aggregates from
the primitive abstractions or derive the primitive abstractions from the agg-
regates. Since people are exposed to “the whole thing” by immersion in the full
experience of life – touch, sight, sound, taste, and balance – all at once, it seems
possible – even likely – that the more primitive abstractions are somehow
derived through the analysis of aggregates, perhaps by cross-correlation. This
can be accomplished in a CRA sleep cycle. The idea is that the wake cycle
is optimized for immediate reaction to stimuli, such as our ancestors needed
to avoid predation, while the sleep cycle is optimized for introspection, for
analyzing the day’s stimuli to derive those objects that should be recognized
and acted upon in the next cycle.
Stimuli are each counted. When an iCR that conforms to this architec-
ture encounters a stimulus, it both counts how many such stimuli have been
encountered and resets a timer to zero that keeps track of the time since the
last occurrence of the stimulus.

3 Cognitive Radio Architecture
83
3.4.2 Primitive Sequences: Words and Dead Time
The accumulation of sequences of atomic symbols forms primitive sequences.
The key question at this level of the data structure hierarchy is the sequence
boundary. The simplest situation is one in which a distinguished atomic sym-
bol separates primitive sequences, which is exactly the case with white space
between words in typed text. In general, one would like a machine-learning
system to determine on its own that the white space (and a few special sym-
bols, etc.) separates the keyboard input stream into primitive sequences.
3.4.3 Basic Sequences
The pattern of aggregation is repeated vertically at the levels corresponding
to words, phrases, dialogs, and scenes. The data structures generated by PDA
Nodes create the concept hierarchy of Figure 3.5. These are the reinforced
hierarchical sequences. They are reinforced by the inherent counting of the
number of times each atomic or aggregated stimulus occurs. The phrase level
typically contains or implies a verb (the verb to-be is implied if no other verb
is implicit).
Unless digested (e.g. by a sleep process), the observation phase hierarchy
accumulates all the sensor data, parsed and distributed among PDA Nodes
for fast parallel retrieval. Since the hierarchy saves everything and compares
new data to memories, it is a kind of memory-base learning technique. This
is a memory-intensive approach, taking a lot of space. When the stimuli re-
tained are limited to atomic symbols and their aggregates, the total amount
of data that needs to be stored is relatively modest. In addition, recent re-
search shows the negative eﬀects of discarding cases in word pronunciation.
In word pronunciation, no example can be discarded even if “disruptive” to a
well developed model. Each exception has to be followed. Thus in CR1, when
multiple memories match partially, the most nearly exact match informs the
orientation, planning, and action.
Basic sequences are each counted. When an iCR that conforms to this
architecture encounters a basic sequence, it both counts how many such seq-
uences have been encountered and resets a timer to zero that keeps track of
the time since the last occurrence.
3.4.4 Natural Language in the CRA Inference Hierarchy
In speech, words spoken in a phrase may be co-articulated with no distinct
boundary between the primitive sequences in a basic sequence. Therefore,
speech detection algorithms may reliably extract a basic sequence while the
parsing of that sequence into its constituent primitive sequences may be much
less reliable. Typically, the correct parse is within the top ten candidates
for contemporary speech-to-text software tools. But the ﬂow of speech signal
processing may be something like:

84

Figure c⃝Dr. Joseph Mitola III, used with permission
Fig. 3.6. Natural language encapsulation in the observation hierarchy.
1. Isolate a basic sequence (phrase) from background noise using an acoustic
squelch algorithm.
2. Analyze the basic sequence to identify candidate primitive sequence
boundaries (words).
3. Analyze the primitive sequences for atomic symbols.
4. Evaluate primitive and basic sequence hypotheses based on a statistical
model of language to rank-order alternative interpretations of the basic
sequence.
So a practical speech processing algorithm may yield alternative strings of
phonemes and candidate parses “all at once.” NLP tool sets may be embedded
into the CRA inference hierarchy as illustrated in Figure 3.6. Speech and/or
text channels may be processed via natural language facilities with substantial
a priori models of language and discourse. The use of those models should
entail the use of mappings among the word, phrase, dialog, and scene levels
of the observation phase hierarchy and the encapsulated component(s).
It is tempting to expect cognitive radio to integrate a commercial natural
language processing system such as IBM’s ViaVoice or a derivative of an
NLP research system such as SNePS [33], AGFL [34], or XTAG [35] perhaps
using a morphological analyzer like PCKimmo [36]. These tools both go too
far and not far enough in the direction needed for CRA. One might like to
employ existing tools using a workable interface between the domain of radio
engineering and some of the above natural language tool sets. The deﬁnition
of such cross-discipline interfaces is in its infancy. A present, one cannot just
express a radio ontology in Interlingua and plug it neatly into XTAG to get
a working cognitive radio. The internal data structures that are used in radio

3 Cognitive Radio Architecture
85
mediate the performance of radio tasks (e.g. “transmit a waveform”). The data
structures of XTAG, AGFL, etc. mediate the conversion of language from one
form to another. Thus, XTAG wants to know that “transmit” is a verb and
“waveform” is a noun. The CR needs to know that if the user says “transmit”
and a message has been deﬁned, then the CR should call the SDR function
transmit(). NLP systems also need scoping rules for transformations on the
linguistic data structures. The way in which domain knowledge is integrated
in linguistic structures of these tools tends to obscure the radio engineering
aspects.
Natural language processing systems work well on well-structured speech
and text, such as the prepared text of a news anchor. But they do not work
well yet on noisy, non-grammatical data structures encountered when a user is
trying to order a cab in a crowded bar. Thus, less-linguistic or meta-linguistic
data structures may be needed to integrate core cognitive radio reasoning
with speech and/or text-processing front ends. The CRA has the ﬂexibility
illustrated in the ﬁgure above for the subsequent integration of evolved NLP
tools. The emphasis of this version of the CRA is a structure of sets and maps
required to create a viable cognitive radio architecture. Although introducing
the issues required to integrate existing natural language processing tools, the
text does not pretend to present a complete solution to this problem.
3.4.5 Observe-Orient Links for Scene Interpretation
CR may use an algorithm-generating language with which one may deﬁne self-
similar inference processes. In one example, the ﬁrst process (Proc1) partitions
characters into words, detecting novel characters and phrase boundaries as
well. Proc2 detects novel words and aggregates known words into phrases.
Proc3 detects novel phrases, aggregating known phrases into dialogs. Proc4
aggregates dialogs into scenes, and Proc5 detects known scenes. In each case, a
novel entity at level N will be bound in the context of the surrounding known
entities at that level to the closest match at the next highest level, N + 1. For
example at the word-phrase intersection of Proc2, would map the following
phrases:
Equation 4: “Let me introduce Joe”
Equation 5: “Let me introduce Chip”
Since “Chip” is unknown while “Joe” is known from a prior dialog, inte-
grated CBR matches the phrases, binding <Chip>=<Joe>. In other words,
it will try to act with respect to Chip in the way it was previously trained
(at the dialog level) to interact with Joe. In response to the introduction, the
system may say “Hello, Chip, How are you?” mimicking the behavior it had
been trained with respect to Joe previously. Not too bright, but not all that
bad either for a relatively simple machine learning algorithm.
There is a particular kind of dialog that is characterized by reactive world
knowledge in which there is some standard way of reacting to given speech-act

inputs. For example, when someone says “Hello,” you may typically reply with
“Hello” or some other greeting. The capability to generate such rote responses
is pre-programmed into a lateral component of the Hearsay knowledge source
(KS). The responses are not pre-programmed, but the general tendency to
imitate phrase level dialogs is a pre-programmed tendency that can be over-
ruled by plan generation, but that is present in the orient-phase, which is
Proc6.
Words may evoke a similar tendency towards immediate action. What do
you do when you hear the words “Help!!” or “Fire, ﬁre, get out, get out!!”
You, the CR programmer, can capture reactive tendencies in your CR by pre-
programming an ability to detect these kinds of situations in the Word-sense
knowledge source, as implied by Figure 3.7). When confronted with them
(which is preferred), CR should react appropriately if properly trained, which
is one of the key aspects of this text. To cheat, you can pre-program a wider
array of stimulus-response pairs so that your CR has more a priori knowledge,
but some of it may not be appropriate. Some responses are culturally condi-
tioned. Will your CR be too rigid? If it has too much a priori knowledge, it
will be perceived by its users as too rigid. If it doesn’t have enough, it will be
perceived as too stupid.
3.4.6 Observe-Orient Links for Radio Skill Sets

inference engine in order to accomplish anything. Radio skills, on the other
hand, are knowledge embedded in serModels through the process of training or
sleeping/dreaming. This knowledge is continually pattern-matched against all
stimuli in parallel. That is, there are no logical dependencies among knowledge
components that mediate the application of the knowledge. With FOPC, the
theorem-prover must reach a deﬁned state in the resolution of multiple axioms
in order to initiate action. In contrast, serModels are continually compared
to the level of the hierarchy to which they are attached, so their immediate
responses are always cascading towards action. Organized as maps primarily
among the wake-cycle phases “observe” and “orient,” the radio procedure skill
sets (SS’s) control radio personalities as illustrated in Figure 3.8.
These skill sets may either be reformatted into serModels directly from the
a priori knowledge of an RKRL frame, or they may be acquired from training
or sleep/dreaming. Each skill set may also save the knowledge it learns into
an RKRL frame.
3.4.7 General World Knowledge
An iCR needs substantial knowledge embedded in the inference hierarchies.
It needs both external RF knowledge and internal radio knowledge. Internal
knowledge enables it to reason about itself as a radio. External radio knowl-
edge enables it to reason about the role of the <Self/> in the world, such as
respecting rights of other cognitive and not-so-cognitive radios.

Fig. 3.9. External radio knowledge includes concrete and abstract knowledge.
Figure 3.9 illustrates the classes of knowledge an iCR needs to employ in
the inference hierarchies and cognition cycle. It is one thing to write down
that the Universe includes a Physical World (there could also be a spiritual
world, and that might be very important in some cultures). It is quite an-
other thing to express that knowledge in a way that the iCR will be able to
use that knowledge eﬀectively. Symbols like “Universe” take on meaning by
their relationships to other symbols and to external stimuli. In this ontology,
meta-level knowledge consists of abstractions, distinct from existential
knowledge of the physical Universe. In RXML, this ontological perspective
includes all in a universe of discourse, <Universe> expressed as follows:
<Universe>
<Abstractions><Time><Now/></Time><Space><Here/> </Space>
. . . <RF/>. . .
<Intelligent-Entities/> . . . </Abstractions>
<Physical-universe>. . . <Instances/> of Abstractions . . . </Physical-
universe>
< /Universe>
Equation 6 the universe of discourse of iCR consists of abstractions plus the
physical universe
Abstractions include informal and formal meta-level knowledge from unstruc-
tured knowledge of concepts to the more mathematically structured models
of space, time, RF, and entities that exist in space–time. To diﬀerentiate

3 Cognitive Radio Architecture

“now” as a temporal concept from “Now” as the Chinese name of a plant,
the CRA includes both the a priori knowledge of “now” as a space–time lo-
cus, <Now/> as well as functions that access and manipulate instances of
the concept <Now/>. <Now/> is axiomatic in the CRA, so code refers to
“now” (as n.o.w) in planning actions. The architecture allows an algorithm
to return the date-time code from Windows to deﬁne instances of <Now/>.
Deﬁnition-by-algorithm permits an inference system like the cognition subsys-
tem to reason about whether a given event is in the past, present, or future.
What is the present? The present is some region of time between “now” and
the immediate past and future. If you are a paleontologist, “now” may consist
of the million year epoch in which we all are thought to have evolved from
apes. If you are a rock star, “now” is probably a lot shorter than that to you.
How will your CR learn the user’s concept of now? The CRA design oﬀers
an axiomatic treatment of time, but the axioms were not programmed into
the Java explicitly. THE CRA aggregates knowledge of time by a temporal
CBR that illustrates the key principles. The CRA does not ﬁx the deﬁnition
of <Now/> but enables the <Self/> to deﬁne the details in an <Instance>
in the physical world about which it can learn from the user, paleontologist
or rock star.
Given the complexity of a system that includes both a multi-tiered in-
ference hierarchy and the cognition cycle’s observe–orient–plan–decide–act
sequence with AML throughout, it is helpful to consider the mathematical
structure of these information elements, processes, and ﬂows.
The mathematical treatment, CRA IV, is provided elsewhere [5].
3.5 CRA V: Building the CRA on SDR Architectures
A Cognitive Radio is a Software Radio (SWR) or Software-Deﬁned Radio
(SDR) with ﬂexible formal semantics based entity to entity formal messaging
via RXML and integrated machine learning of the self, the user, the environ-
ment, and the “situation.” This section reviews SWR, SDR, and the Software
Communications Architecture (SCA) or Software Radio Architecture (SRA)
for those who may be unfamiliar with these concepts. While it is not necessary
for an iCR to use the SCA/SRA as its internal model of itself, it certainly
must have some model, or it will be incapable of reasoning about its own
internal structure and adapting or modifying its radio functionality.
3.5.1 SWR and SDR Architecture Principles
Hardware-deﬁned radios such as the typical AM/FM broadcast receiver con-
vert radio to audio using radio hardware, such as antennas, ﬁlters, analog
de-modulators, and the like. SWR is the ideal radio in which the Analog
to Digital Converter (ADC) and Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) con-
vert digital signals to and from radio frequencies (RF) directly, and all RF

channel modulation, demodulation, frequency translation and ﬁltering are ac-
complished digitally. For example, modulation may be accomplished digitally
by multiplying sine and cosine components of a digitally sampled audio signal
(called the “baseband” signal, e.g. to be transmitted) by the sampled digital
values of a higher frequency sine wave to up-convert it, ultimately to RF.
Figure 3.10 shows how SDR principles apply to a cellular radio base sta-
tion. In the ideal SWR, there would be essentially no RF conversion, just
ADC/DAC blocks accessing the full RF spectrum available to the (wideband)
antenna elements. Today’s SDR base-stations approach this ideal by digital
access (DAC and ADC) to a band of spectrum allocations, such as 75 MHz
allocated to uplink and downlink frequencies for third-generation services.
In this architecture, RF conversion can be a substantial system component,
sometimes 60% of the cost of the hardware, and not amenable to cost im-
provements through Moore’s Law. The ideal SDR would access more like 2.5
GHz from, say 30 MHz to around 2.5 GHz, supporting all kinds of services in
television (TV) bands, police bands, air traﬃc control bands – you name it.
Although considered radical when introduced in 1991 [37] and popularized in
1995 [38], recent regulatory rulings are encouraging the deployment of such
“ﬂexible spectrum” use architectures.
This ideal SWR may not be practical or aﬀordable, so it is important
for the radio engineer to understand the tradeoﬀs [again, see [39] for SDR
architecture tradeoﬀs]. In particular, the physics of RF devices (e.g. antennas,
inductors, ﬁlters) makes it easier to synthesize narrowband RF and intervening
analog RF conversion and Intermediate Frequency (IF) conversion. Given nar-
rowband RF, the hardware-deﬁned radio might employ baseband (e.g. voice
frequency) ADC, DAC, and digital signal processing. The Programmable Dig-
ital Radios (PDR) of the 1980s and 90s used this approach. Historically, this
approach has not been as expensive as wideband RF (antennas, conversion),
ADCs and DACs. Handsets are less amenable to SWR principles than the
base station (Figure 3.11). Base stations access the power grid. Thus, the fact

that wideband ADCs, DACs, and DSP consume many watts of power is not a
major design driver. Conservation of battery life, however, is a major design
driver in the handset.
Thus, insertion of SWR technology into handsets has been relatively slow.
Instead, the major handset manufacturers include multiple single-band RF
chip sets into a given handset. This has been called the Velcro radio or slice
radio.
Since the ideal SWR is not readily approached in many cases, the SDR
has comprised a sequence of practical steps from the baseband DSP of the
1990s towards the ideal SWR. As the economics of Moore’s Law and of in-
creasingly wideband RF and IF devices allow, implementations move upward
and to the right in the SDR design space (Figure 3.12). This space consists
of the combination of digital access bandwidth and programmability. Access
bandwidth consists of ADC/DAC sampling rates converted by the Nyquist
criterion or practice into eﬀective bandwidth. Programmability of the digital
subsystems is deﬁned by the ease with which logic and interconnect may be
changed after deployment. Application-Speciﬁc Integrated Circuits (ASICs)
cannot be changed at all, so the functions are “dedicated” in silicon. Field
Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) can be changed in the ﬁeld, but if the
new function exceeds some parameter of the chip, which is not uncommon,
then one must upgrade the hardware to change the function, just like ASICs.
Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) are typically easier or less expensive to pro-
gram and are more eﬃcient in power use than FPGAs. Memory limits and
instruction set architecture (ISA) complexity can drive up costs of reprogram-
ming the DSP. Finally, general purpose processors, particularly with Reduced
Instruction Set Architectures (RISC) are most cost-eﬀective to change in the
ﬁeld. To assess a multi-processor, such as a cell phone with a CDMA-ASIC,
DSP speech codec, and RISC miCRo-controller, weight the point by equiva-
lent processing capacity.
Where should one place an SDR design within this space? The quick an-
swer is so that you can understand the migration path of radio technology

the early migration projects captured in Software Radio Architecture [39].
This section contains a very brief synopsis of the key SDR knowledge you
will need in order to follow the iCR examples of this text.
3.5.2 Radio Architecture
The discussion of the software radio design space contains the ﬁrst elements
of radio architecture. It tells you what mix of critical components are present
in the radio. For SDR, the critical hardware components are the ADC,
DAC, and processor suite. The critical software components are the user
interface, the networking software, the information security (INFOSEC) ca-
pability (hardware and/or software), the RF media access software, including
the physical layer modulator and demodulator (modem) and Media Access
Control (MAC), and any antenna-related software such as antenna selec-
tion, beamforming, pointing and the like. INFOSEC consists of Transmission
Security, such as the frequency hopping spreading code selection, plus Com-
munications Security encryption.
The SDR Forum deﬁned a very simple, helpful model of radio in 1997,
shown in Figure 3.13. This model highlights the relationships among radio
functions at a tutorial level. The CR has to “know” about these functions, so

every CR must have an internal model of a radio of some type. This one is a
good start because it shows both the relationships among the functions and
the typical ﬂow of signal transformations from analog RF to analog or with
SDR, digital modems, and on to other digital processing including system
control of which the user interface is a part.
This model and the techniques for implementing a SWR and the various
degrees of SDR capability are addressed in depth in the various texts on
SDR [40–43].
3.5.3 The SCA
The US DoD developed the Software Communications Architecture (SCA)
for its Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) family of radios.
The architecture identiﬁes the components and interfaces shown in
Figure 3.14. The API’s deﬁne access to the physical layer, to the Media
Access Control (MAC) layer, to the logical link layer (LLC), to security
features, and to the input/output of the physical radio device. The physi-
cal components consist of antennas and RF conversion hardware that are
mostly analog and that therefore typically lack the ability to declare or de-
scribe themselves to the system. Most other SCA-compliant components are
capable of describing themselves to the system to enable and facilitate plug
and play among hardware and software components. In addition, the SCA
embraces POSIX and CORBA.
The model evolved through several stages of work in the SDR Forum and
Object Management Group (OMG) into a UML-based object-oriented model
of SDR (Figure 3.15). Waveforms are collections of load modules that provide
wireless services, so from a radio designer’s perspective, the waveform is the
key application in a radio. From a user’s perspective of a wireless PDA, the
radio waveform is just a means to an end, and the user doesn’t want to

know or have to care about waveforms. Today, the cellular service providers
hide this detail to some degree, but consumers sometimes know the diﬀerence
between CDMA and GSM, for example, because CDMA works in the US,
but not in Europe. With the deployment of the third generation of cellular
technology (3G), the amount of technical jargon consumers will need to know
is increasing. So the CR designer is going to write code (Java code in this
book) that insulates the user from those details, unless the user really wants
to know.
In the UML model, Amp refers to ampliﬁcation services, RF refers to
RF conversion, interference-management refers to both avoiding interference
and ﬁltering it out of one’s band of operation. In addition, the jargon for US
military radios is that the “red” side contains the user’s secret information, but

when it is encrypted it becomes “black” or protected, so it can be transmitted.
Black processing occurs between the antenna and the decryption process.
Notice also in the ﬁgure that there is no user interface. The UML model
contains a sophisticated set of management facilities, illustrated further in
Figure 3.16, to which Human Machine Interface (HMI) or user interface is
closely related.
Systems control is based on a framework that includes very generic func-
tions like event logging, organized into a computational architecture, heavily
inﬂuenced by CORBA. The management features are needed to control ra-
dios of the complexity of 3G and of the current generation of military radios.
Although civil sector radios for police, ﬁre, and aircraft lag these two sectors
in complexity and are more cost-sensitive, baseband SDRs are beginning to
insert themselves even into these historically less technology-driven markets.
Fault management features are needed to deal with loss of a radios proces-
sors, memory, or antenna channels. CR therefore interacts with fault manage-
ment to determine what facilities may be available to the radio given recovery
from hardware and/or software faults (e.g. error in a download). Security man-
agement is increasingly important in the protection of the user’s data by the
CR, balancing convenience and security which can be very tedious and time
consuming. The CR will direct Virtual Channel Management and (VCM) will
learn from the VCM function what radio resources are available, such as what
bands the radio can listen to and transmit on and how many it can do at
once. Network management does for the digital paths what VCM does for the
radio paths. Finally, SDR performance depends on the availability of analog
and digital resources, such as linearity in the antenna, Millions of Instructions
Per Second (MIPS) in a processor, and the like.

3.5.4 Functions–Transforms Model of Radio
The self-referential model of a wireless device used by the CRA and used
to deﬁne the RKRL and to train the CRA is the functions–transforms model
illustrated in Figure 3.17. In this model, the radio knows about sources, source
coding, networks, INFOSEC, and the collection of front-end services needed
to access RF channels. Its knowledge also extends to the idea of multiple
channels and their characteristics (the channel set), and that the radio part
may have both many alternative personalities at a given point in time, and
that through evolution support, those alternatives may change over time.
Since CR reasons about all of its internal resources, it also must have some
kind of computational model of analog and digital performance parameters
and how they are related to features it can measure or control. MIPS, for
example, may be controlled by setting the clock speed. A high clock speed
generally uses more total power than a lower clock speed, and this tends to
reduce battery life. Same is true for the brightness of a display. The CR only
“knows” this to the degree that it has a data structure that captures this
information and some kind of algorithms, pre-programmed and/or learned,
that deal with these relationships to the beneﬁt of the user. Constraint lan-
guages may be used to express interdependencies, such as how many channels
of a given personality are supported by a given hardware suite, particularly in
failure modes. CR algorithms may employ this kind of structured reasoning
as a specialized Knowledge Source (KS) when using case-based learning to
extend its ability to cope with internal changes.
The ontological structure of the above may be formalized as follows:

While this text does not spend a lot of time on the computational ontology
of SDR, semantically based dialogs among iCRs about internal issues like
downloads may be mediated by developing the RXML above to more fully
develop the necessary ontological structures.
3.5.5 Architecture Migration: From SDR to iCR
Given the CRA and contemporary SDR architecture, one must address the
transition of SDR, possibly through a phase of iCRs toward the ideal CR.
As the complexity of hand-held, wearable, and vehicular wireless systems in-
crease, the likelihood that the user will have the skill necessary to do the op-
timal thing in any given circumstance goes down. Today’s cellular networks
manage the complexity of individual wireless protocols for the user, but the
emergence of multi-band multi-mode iCR moves the burden for complexity
management towards the PDA. The optimization of the choice of wireless
service between the “free” home WLAN and the for-sale cellular equivalent
moves the burden of radio resource management from the network to the
WPDA.
3.5.6 Cognitive Electronics
The increasing complexity of the PDA-user interface also accelerates the trend
towards increasing the computational intelligence of personal electronics. iCR
is in some sense just an example of a computationally intelligent personal elec-
tronics system. For example, using a laptop computer in the bright display
mode uses up the battery power faster than when the display is set to min-
imum brightness. A cognitive laptop could oﬀer to set the brightness to low
level when it was turned on in battery powered mode. It would be even nicer
if it would recognize operation aboard a commercial aircraft and therefore
automatically turn the brightness down. It should learn that my preference is
to set the brightness low on an aircraft to conserve the battery. A cognitive
laptop shouldn’t make a big deal over that, and it should let me turn up the
brightness without complaining. If it had an ambient light sensor or ambient
light algorithm for an embedded camera, it could tell that a window shade
is open, so I have to deal with the brightness. By sensing the brightness of
the on-board aircraft scene and associating my control of the brightness of
my display with the brightness of the environment, a hypothetical cognitive
laptop could learn do the right thing in the right situation.

98
Joseph Mitola III
How does this relate to the CRA? For one thing, the CRA could be used
as-is to increase the computational intelligence of the laptop. In this case,
the self is the laptop and the PDA knows about itself as a laptop, not as a
WPDA. It knows about its sensors suite, which includes at least a light level
sensor if not a camera through the data structures that deﬁne the <Self/>. It
knows about the user by observing keystrokes and mouse action as well as by
interpreting the images on the camera, e.g. to verify that the Owner is still the
user since that is important to building user-speciﬁc models. It might build a
space–time behavior model of any user or it might be a one-user laptop. Its
actions then must include the setting of the display intensity level. In short,
the CRA accommodates the cognitive laptop with suitable knowledge in the
knowledge structures and functions implemented in the map sets.
3.5.7 When Should a Radio Transition towards Cognition?
If a wireless device accesses only a single RF band and mode, then it is not
a very good starting point for cognitive radio. It’s just too simple. Even as
complexity increases, as long as the user’s needs are met by wireless devices
managed by the network(s), then embedding computational intelligence in
the device has limited beneﬁts. In 1999, Mitsubishi and AT&T announced the
ﬁrst “four-mode handset.” The T250 operated in TDMA mode on 850 or 1900
MHz, in ﬁrst generation Analog Mobile Phone System (AMPS) mode on 850
MHz, and in Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD) mode on 1900 MHz. This
illustrates early development of multi-band, multi-mode, multimedia (M3)
wireless. These radios enhanced the service provider’s ability to oﬀer national
roaming, but the complexity was not apparent to the user since the network
managed the radio resources in the handset.
Even as device complexity increases in ways that the network does not
manage, there may be no need for cognition. There are several examples of
capabilities embedded in electronics that typically are not heavily used. Do
you use your laptop’s speech recognition system? What about its IRDA port?
If you were the typical user circa 2004, you didn’t use either capability of
your Windows XP laptop all that much. So complexity can increase without
putting a burden on the user to manage that complexity if the capability isn’t
central to the way in which the user employs the system.
For radio, as the number of bands and modes increases, the SDR becomes
a better candidate for the insertion of cognition technology. But it is not until
the radio or the wireless part of the PDA has the capacity to access multiple
RF bands that cognition technology begins to pay oﬀ. With the liberalization
of RF spectrum use rules, the early evolution of iCR may be driven by RF
spectrum use etiquette for ad hoc bands such as the FCC use case. In the not-
too-distant future, SDR PDAs could access satellite mobile services, cordless
telephone, WLAN, GSM, and 3G bands. An ideal SDR device with these
capabilities might aﬀordably access three octave bands from 0.4 to 0.96 GHz
(skip the air navigation and GPS band from .96 to 1.2 GHz),1.3 to 2.5 GHz,

and from 2.5 to 5.9 GHz (Figure 3.18). Not counting satellite mobile and radio
navigation bands, such radios would have access to over 30 mobile sub-bands
in 1463 MHz of potentially sharable outdoor mobile spectrum. The upper band
provides another 1.07 GHz of sharable indoor and RF LAN spectrum. This
wideband radio technology will be aﬀordable ﬁrst for military applications,
next for base station infrastructure, then for mobile vehicular radios and later
for handsets and PDAs. When a radio device accesses more RF bands than the
host network controls, it is time for CR technology to mediate the dynamic
sharing of spectrum. It is the well-heeled conformance to the radio etiquettes
aﬀorded by cognitive radio that makes such sharing practical [44].
3.5.8 Radio Evolution towards the CRA
Various protocols have been proposed by which radio devices may share the
radio spectrum. The US FCC Part 15 rules permit low power devices to oper-
ate in some bands. In 2003, a Rule and Order (R&O) made unused television
(TV) spectrum available for low power RF LAN applications, making the
manufacturer responsible for ensuring that the radios obey this simple pro-
tocol. DARPA’s NeXt Generation (XG) program developed a language for
expressing spectrum use policy [45]. Other more general protocols based on
peek-through to legacy users have also been proposed [33].
Does this mean that a radio must transition instantaneously from the SCA
to the CRA? Probably not. The simple six-component iCR architecture may
be implemented with minimal sensory perception, minimal learning, and no
autonomous ability to modify itself. Regulators want to hold manufacturers

100
Joseph Mitola III
responsible for the behaviors of such radios. The simpler the architecture, the
simpler the problem of explaining it to regulators and of getting concurrence
among manufacturers regarding open architecture interfaces that facilitate
technology insertion through teaming. Manufacturers who fully understand
the level to which a highly autonomous CR might unintentionally reprogram
itself to violate regulatory constraints may decide they want to ﬁeld aware-
adaptive (AA) radios, but may not want to take the risks associated with a
self-modifying CR’s just yet.
Thus, one can envision a gradual evolution towards the CRA beginning
initially with a minimal set of functions mutually agreeable among the grow-
ing community of iCR stakeholders. Subsequently, the introduction of new
services will drive the introduction of new capabilities and additional API’s,
perhaps informed by the CRA developed in this text.
3.5.9 Cognitive Radio Architecture Research Topics
The cognition cycle and related inference hierarchy imply a large scope of hard
research problems for cognitive radio. Parsing incoming messages requires nat-
ural language text processing. Scanning the user’s voice channels for content
that further deﬁnes the communications context requires speech processing.
Planning technology oﬀers a wide range of alternatives in temporal calculus
[46], constraint-based scheduling [30], task planning [31], causality modeling
[32], and the like. Resource allocation includes algebraic methods for wait-free
scheduling protocols [33], Open Distributed Processing (ODP), and Parallel
Virtual Machines (PVM). Finally, machine learning remains one of the core
challenges in artiﬁcial intelligence research [34]. The focus of this cognitive ra-
dio research, then, is not on the development of any one of these technologies
per se. Rather, it is on the organization of cognition tasks and on the devel-
opment of cognition data structures needed to integrate contributions from
these diverse disciplines for the context-sensitive delivery of wireless services
by software radio.
Learning the diﬀerence between situations in which a reactive response is
needed versus those in which deliberate planning is more appropriate is a key
challenge in machine learning for CR. The CRA framed the issues. The CRA
goes further, providing useful KS’s and related ML so that the CR designer
can start there in developing good engineering solutions to this problem for a
given CR applications domain.
3.5.10 Industrial Strength iCR Design Rules
The CRA allocates functions to components based on design rules. Typically
design rules are captured in various interface speciﬁcations including Appli-
cations Programmers Interfaces (APIs), and Object Interfaces, such as Java’s
JINI/JADE structure of intelligent agents [47]. While the previous section
introduced the CRA, this section suggests additional design rules by which

3 Cognitive Radio Architecture
101
user domains, sensory domains and radio knowledge of RF Band knowledge
may be integrated into industrial-strength iCR products and systems.
The following design rules circumscribe the integration of cognitive func-
tions with the other components of a wireless PDA within the CRA
1. The cognition function should maintain an explicit [topological] model of
space–time
a) Of the user
b) Of the physical environment
c) Of the radio networks
d) Of the internal states of the radio, the <self/>
2. The CRA requires each CR to predict in advance, an upper bound on the
amount of computational resources (e.g. time) required for each cognition
cycle. The CR is must set a trusted (hardware) watchdog (e.g. timer)
before entering a cognition cycle. If the watchdog is violated, the system
must detect that event, log that event, and mark the components invoked
in that event as non-deterministic.
3. The CRA should internalize knowledge as procedural skills, e.g. serModels.
a) The CRA requires each CR to maintain a trusted index to internal
models and related experience.
b) Each CR must preclude cycles from its internal models and skills
graph because a CRA conformance requires reliable detection of cycles
to break cycles (e.g. via timer) to avoid G¨odel–Turing unbounded
resource use endemic to self-referential Turing-capable computational
entities like iCRs.
4. Context that references space, time, RF, the <User/> and the <Self/>
for every external and internal event shall be represented formally using
a topologically valid and logically sound model of space–time–context.
5. Each CR conforming to the CRA shall include an explicit grounding map,
M that maps its internal data structures onto elements sensed in the ex-
ternal world represented in its sensory domains, including itself. If the CR
cannot map a sensed entity to a space–time–context entity with speciﬁed
time allocated to attempt that map, then the entity should be designated
“UNGROUNDABLE.”
6. The model of the world shall follow a formal treatment of time, space,
radio frequency, radio propagation, and the grounding of entities in the
environment.
7. Models shall be represented in an open architecture radio knowledge repre-
sentation language suited to the representation of radio knowledge (e.g. a
Semantic Web derivative of RKRL). That language shall support topolog-
ical properties and inference (e.g. forward chaining) but must not include
unconstrained axiomatic ﬁrst order predicate calculus which per force
violates the G¨odel–Turing constraint.
8. The cognition functions shall maintain location awareness, including
a) the sensing of location from global positioning satellites,

102
Joseph Mitola III
b) sensing position from local wireless sensors and networks,
c) and sensing precise position visually,
d) location shall be an element of all contexts,
e) the cognition functions shall estimate time to the accuracy necessary
to support the user and radio functions,
f) the cognition functions shall maintain an awareness of the identity of
the PDA, of its Owner, of its primary user, and of other legitimate
users designated by the owner or primary user.
9. The cognition functions shall reliably infer the user’s communications con-
text and apply that knowledge to the provisioning of wireless access by
the SDR function.
10. The cognition functions shall model the propagation of its own radio
signals with suﬃcient ﬁdelity to estimate interference to other spectrum
users.
a) The cognition function shall also assure that interference is within
limits speciﬁed by the spectrum use protocols in eﬀect in its location
(e.g. in spectrum rental protocols).
b) It shall defer control of the <Self/> to the wireless network in contexts
where a trusted network manages interference.
11. The cognition functions shall model the domain of applications running
on the host platform, suﬃcient to infer the parameters needed to support
the application. Parameters modeled include QoS, data rate, probability
of link closure (Grade of Service), and space–time–context domain within
which wireless support is needed.
12. The cognition functions shall conﬁgure and manage the SDR assets to
include hardware resources, software personalities, and functional capa-

gated to an appropriate SDR function (e.g. the SDR Forum domain man-
ager). Constraints and parameters of those SDR assets shall be modeled
by the cognition functions. The cognition functions shall assure that the
computational resources allocated to applications, interfaces, cognition

standing in external stimuli and in inferences. A certainty calculus shall
be employed consistently in reasoning about uncertain information.
15. The cognition functions shall recognize preemptive actions taken by the

defer the control of applications, interfaces, and/or SDR assets to the
Owner, to the network or to the primary user, according to appropriate

3.6 Summary and Future Directions
The progeny of TellMe R⃝seem headed to a purse or belt near you to better
sense and perceive your needs for communications services so that you can take
fuller advantage of the technology by, well, by doing nothing but letting the
technology adapt to you. In 2005, the technology was not capable of sensing,
perceiving, and adapting to the user, but enabling technologies in machine
speech and vision were maturing. Because of the FCC’s rulings encouraging
CR, many “cognitive radio” products capable only of sniﬃng TV channels and
employing unoccupied radio spectrum were appearing in the marketplace.
3.6.1 Architecture Frameworks
Often technical architecture frameworks of the kind presented in this chapter
accelerate the state of practice by catalyzing work across industry on plug-
and-play, teaming, and collaboration. The thought is that to propel of wireless
technology from limited spectrum awareness towards valuable user awareness,
some architecture like the CRA will be needed. In short, the CRA articulates
the functions, components, and design rules of next-generation cognitive ra-
dios. Each of the diﬀerent aspects of the CRA contributes to the dialog:
1. The functional architecture identiﬁes components and interfaces for cog-
nitive radios with sensory and perception capabilities in the user domain,
not just the radio domain.
2. The cognition cycle identiﬁes the processing structures for the integration
of sensing and perception into radio: observe (sense and perceive), orient
(react if necessary), plan, decide, act, and learn.
3. The inference hierarchies suggest levels of abstraction helpful in the inte-
gration of radio and user domains into the synthesis of services tailored
to the speciﬁc user’s current state of aﬀairs given the corresponding state
of aﬀairs of the radio spectrum in space and time.
4. The introduction to ontology suggests an increasing role for semantic web
technologies in making the radios smarter, initially about radio and over
time about the user.
5. Although not strictly necessary for CR, SDR provides a very ﬂexible plat-
form for the regular enhancement of both computational intelligence and
radio capability, particularly with each additional Moore’s law cycle.
6. Finally, this chapter has introduced the CRA to the reader interested
in the cutting edge, but has not deﬁned the CRA. The previous section
suggested a few of the many aspects of the embryonic CRA that must
be addressed by researchers, developers, and markets in the continuing
evolution of SDR towards ubiquitous and really fun iCRs.

3.6.2 Industrial Strength Architecture
Although the CRA provides a framework for API’s, it doesn’t specify the
details of the data structures nor of the maps. Thus, the CRA research proto-
type emphasizes ubiquitous learning via serModels and Case Based Reasoning
[see [11]], but it doesn’t implement critical features that would be required in
consumer-class iCR’s. Other critical aspects of such industrial-strength archi-
tectures include more capable scene perception and situation interpretation
speciﬁcally addressing:
1. Noise, in utterances, images, objects, location estimates and the like.
Noise sources include thermal noise, conversion error introduced by the
process of converting analog signals (audio, video, accelerometers, tem-
perature, etc.) to digital form, error in converting from digital to analog
form, preprocessing algorithm biases and random errors, such as the accu-
mulation of error in a digital ﬁlter, or the truncation of a low energy signal
by threshold logic. Dealing eﬀectively with noise diﬀerentiates a tutorial
demonstration from an industrially useful product.
2. Hypothesis management, keeping track of more than one possible
binding of stimuli to response, dialog sense, scene, etc. Hypotheses may
be managed by keeping the N-best hypotheses (with an associated degree
of belief), by estimating the prior probability or other degree of belief in
a hypothesis, and keeping a suﬃcient number of hypotheses to exceed a
threshold (e.g. 90 or 99% of all the possibilities), or keeping multiple hy-
potheses until the probability for the next most likely (2nd) hypothesis is
less than some threshold. The estimation of probability requires a mea-
surable space, a sigma-algebra that deﬁnes how to accumulate probability
on that space, proof that the space obeys the axioms of probability and a
certainty calculus that deﬁnes how to combine degrees of belief in events
as a function of the measures assigned to the probability of the event.
3. Training Interfaces, the reverse ﬂow of knowledge from the inference
hierarchy back to the perception subsystems. The recognition of the user
by a combination of face and voice could be more reliable than single-
domain recognition either by voice or by vision. In addition, the location,
temperature, and other aspects of the scene may inﬂuence object identi-
ﬁcation. Visual recognition of the Owner outdoors in a snow storm, for
example, is more diﬃcult than indoors in an oﬃce. While the CR might
learn to recognize the user based on weaker cues outdoors, access to pri-
vate data might be constrained until the quality of the recognition exceeds
some learned threshold.
Non-Linear Flows: Although the cognition cycle emphasizes the for-
ward ﬂow of perception enabling action, it is crucial to realize that actions
may be internal, such as advising the vision subsystem that its recognition
of the user is in error because the voice does not match and the location is

3 Cognitive Radio Architecture
105
wrong. Because of the way the cognition cycle operates on the self, these re-
verse ﬂows from perception to training are implemented as forward ﬂows from
the perception system to the self, directed towards a speciﬁc subsystem such
as vision or audition. There may also be direct interfaces from the CWN to
the CR to upload data structures representing a priori knowledge integrated
into the UCBR learning framework.
3.6.3 Conclusion
In conclusion, iCR seems headed for the Semantic Web, but the markets
for services layered on practical radio networks will shape that evolution.
Although many information-processing technologies from eBusiness Solutions
to the Semantic Web are relevant to iCR, the integration of audio and visual
sensory perception into SDR with suitable cognition architectures remains
both a research challenge and a series of increasingly interesting radio systems
designs. A CRA that is broadly supported by industry could accelerate such
an evolution.

4.1 Introduction
Wireless communication devices are composed of three main entities; signal-
ing, physical hardware, and its functionalities. These three main streams,
which complement each other, have evolved since the invention of the radio
transmission by Guglielmo Marconi. The primitive communications devices
had very simple signaling, analog hardware, and limited functionality. In time,
each of these entities evolved signiﬁcantly. Diﬀerent signaling methods have
been invented and used around the world. Furthermore, numerous diﬀerent
wireless communications systems and standards have been developed around
the world without any global plan. Recently, the diversity in wireless sys-
tems and standards bring some issues on the surface such as interoperability
and global seamless connectivity. In parallel, hardware technology evolved
signiﬁcantly, too. Some of the key milestones in this progress are transition
from analog hardware to digital hardware and then introduction of sophis-
ticated processors. This is followed by the development of Software Deﬁned
Radio (SDR) structures and virtual hardwares that are under development
currently. SDR is envisioned initially to be a promising solution for interoper-
ability, global seamless connectivity, multi-standard, and multi-mode issues.
Also in parallel, the functionality of wireless devices is increased and they be-
come more and more sophisticated. For instance, the cellular technology was
developed to provide voice communications for mobile users initially. However,
current cellular phones have multi-functionalities such as internet access, digi-
tal camera, Global Positioning System (GPS), games, personal assistance, and
music player. Ever increasing demands from the users and service providers
result in continuously increasing Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. This
trend requires to add intelligent functionalities to the wireless devices, which
introduced cognitive radio technology. Nowadays, these three streams start to
merge under the umbrella of cognitive radio technology. It is an emerging tech-
nology to realize wireless devices with cognition capabilities such as learning,
sensing, awareness, and reasoning. Moreover, it has capability of providing

global seamless connectivity and solve the interoperability issue. SDR is a key
enabling technology to realize cognitive radios. Until development of cognitive
radio technology, SDR has been mainly proposed to realize multi-mode and
multi-standard wireless devices. However, the role of SDR in cognitive radios
is very essential, which is the realization of cognition features (e.g. awareness,
sensing, etc.) in cognitive radios. Hence, we discuss SDR structures in the
context of cognitive radio technology in this chapter.
The main objective of this chapter is to demonstrate the tight relation-
ship between SDR and cognitive radio. This is followed by a discussion on
SDR requirements of cognitive radios. Then, we will present the current SDR
enabling technologies along with their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, con-
cluding remarks will be provided.
4.2 SDR and Cognitive Radio Relationship
As discussed in the previous chapters, one of the main characteristics of cogni-
tive radio is the adaptability where the radio parameters (including frequency,
power, modulation, bandwidth) can be changed depending on the radio en-
vironment, user’s situation, network condition, geolocation, and so on. SDR
can provide a very ﬂexible radio functionality by avoiding the use of applica-
tion speciﬁc ﬁxed analog circuits and components. Therefore, cognitive radio
needs to be designed around SDR. In other words, SDR is the core enabling
technology for cognitive radio. One of the most popular deﬁnitions of cogni-
tive radio, in fact, supports the above argument clearly: “A cognitive radio
is an SDR that is aware of its environment, internal state, and location, and
autonomously adjusts its operations to achieve designated objectives.”
Even though many diﬀerent models are possible, one of the simplest con-
ceptual model that describes the relation between cognitive radio and SDR
can be described as shown in Figure 4.1. In this simple model, cognitive radio
is wrapped around SDR. This model ﬁts well to the aforementioned deﬁni-
tion of cognitive radio, where the combination of cognitive engine, SDR, and
the other supporting functionalities (e.g. sensing) results in cognitive radio.
Cognitive engine is responsible for optimizing or controlling the SDR based
on some input parameters such as that are sensed or learned from the radio
environment, user’s context, and network condition. Cognitive engine is aware
of the radio’s hardware resources and capabilities as well as the other input
parameters that are mentioned above. Hence, it tries to satisfy the radio link
requirements of a higher layer application or user with the available resources
such as spectrum and power. Compared to hardware radio where the radio can
perform only single or very limited amount of radio functionality, SDR is built
around software based digital signal processing along with software tunable
Radio Frequency (RF) components. Hence, SDR represents a very ﬂexible and
generic radio platform which is capable of operating with many diﬀerent band-
widths over a wide range of frequencies and using many diﬀerent modulation

and waveform formats. As a result, SDR can support multiple standards (i.e.
GSM, EDGE, WCDMA, CDMA2000, Wi-Fi, WiMAX) and multiple access
technologies such as Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Code Division
Multiple Access (CDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access
(OFDMA), and Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA).
The recent boom in the diversity of wireless standards with diﬀerent op-
tions exposes interoperability and multi-mode support issues. SDR has been
considered as an inherent solution to address such issues. Although SDR is
naturally evolved due to the need to implement radios that can support multi-
ple mode and standards, utilization of SDR in a cognitive radio is not limited
to the aforementioned functionalities. SDR is a promising technology to intro-
duce cognition capabilities to cognitive radios. For instance, one of the crucial
cognition capabilities of cognitive radios is the dynamic spectrum management
system. Spectrum sensing, optimization mechanism to utilize a speciﬁc part of
the spectrum, and spectrum shaping are the main steps of dynamic spectrum
management systems. In the case of spectrum, sensing devices are required
to sense the spectrum, which can be either embedded into SDR internally or
incorporated to SDR externally. For instance, antenna can be considered as
an internal sensor whereas the video camera can be considered as an external
sensor for SDR structures. In other words, SDR can have a structure like a

112
H¨useyin Arslan and Hasari Celebi
miniature spectrum analyzer in order to provide the spectrum information
to cognitive engine. Either the existing receiver front-end of SDR or a des-
ignated receiver parallel to the receiver side of SDR can be used to perform
spectrum capturing. Captured spectrum is digitized by Analog-to-Digital Con-
verter (ADC) and then the digital samples are sent to digital signal processor
for the post-processing.
4.3 SDR Architectures
4.3.1 Ideal SDR Architectures
Ideal SDR architecture consists of three main units, which are reconﬁgurable
digital radio, software tunable radio along with embedded impedance syn-
thesizer, and software tunable antenna systems [1, 2]. This structure is illus-
trated in Figure 4.2. The main responsibilities of reconﬁgurable digital radio
are performing digital radio functionalities such as diﬀerent waveform gener-
ation, optimization algorithms for software tunable radio and antenna units,
and controlling of these units. There are various diﬀerent enabling technolo-
gies for implementation of reconﬁgurable digital radio, which are discussed in
the later sections. Software tunable analog front-end system is limited to the
components that cannot be performed digitally such as RF ﬁlters, combiners/
splitters, Power Ampliﬁer (PA), Low Noise Ampliﬁers (LNA), and data con-
verters. Moreover, this unit has impedance synthesizer subsystem, which is
a crucial unit to optimize the performance of software tunable analog radio
systems. For instance, impedance synthesizer is used to optimize the perfor-
mance of software tunable antenna systems for an arbitrary frequency plan
speciﬁed by cognitive engine. The details of these SDR units are provided in
the later sections.

113
Reconﬁgurable digital radio system monitors and controls the software
tunable radio system continuously or periodically depending on system spec-
iﬁcations. A basic relationship between the main units of SDR is described
as follows. The cognitive engine sends radio conﬁguration parameters to the
reconﬁgurable digital radio so that it can reconﬁgure the entire radio accord-
ing to the parameters. These parameters can be waveform type that needs to
be generated (e.g. OFDM, CDMA, UWB), frequency plan (e.g. bandwidth,
operating center frequency), and power spectrum speciﬁcations. Moreover,
cognitive engine can request from reconﬁgurable digital radio to measure or
calculate some parameters from environments such as location information
of a particular user. Reconﬁgurable digital radio conﬁgures itself along with
software tunable radio components and antenna systems. In order to optimize
the performance of the these two units, reconﬁgurable digital radio utilizes the
feedback information from software tunable radio, especially from impedance
synthesizer. Based on this information, it adjusts the parameters of software
tunable radio and antenna units through radio and antenna control signals, re-
spectively. Finally, reconﬁgurable digital radio acknowledges cognitive engine
that the speciﬁed conﬁguration is performed.
4.3.2 Realistic SDR Architectures
Due to the current limitations (size, cost, power, performance, processing
time, data converters), ideal SDR architectures are costly. There are various
practical SDR platforms available in the literature. Note that it is expected
that these platforms will evolve signiﬁcantly in the future as the limitations
towards ideal SDR platform are being removed. Hence, as reconﬁgurable hard-
ware technology advances, software tunable analog radio functionalities will
be implemented in reconﬁgurable digital radio platforms. In the following, we
will provide some current and practical SDR architectures. Figure 4.3 shows
an example of practical SDR architecture for the Worldwide Interoperability
Microwave Access (WiMAX) networks [3]. Reconﬁgurable digital radio can

be implemented using one of the SDR enabling technologies such as Digi-
tal Signal Processor (DSP) or Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).
This unit mainly generates and demodulates OFDM waveform and control
the radio components. Generated OFDM signal is in the form of digital In-
phase (I) and Quadrature (Q) samples. Interpolation, digital ﬁltering, Peak-to-
Average-Power-Ratio (PAPR) reduction algorithms and digital Intermediate
Frequency (IF) upconversion are applied to the I/Q signals prior to Digital-
to-Analog Converter (DAC). Consequently, DAC converts the digital OFDM
signal into the corresponding analog waveform. IF signal at the output of DAC
is upconverted to a ﬁnal RF stage using Software Tunable-UpConverter (ST-
UC). An ST-UC generally consists of software tunable attenuators and clock
synthesizers. With such capability, transmit power level and local oscillator
frequency can be adjusted by reconﬁgurable digital radio. Furthermore, IF-to-
RF upconversion can be performed in one or multiple stages depending on the
performance criterion such as minimum image rejection level. For instance,
the ﬁrst IF signal is upconverted to the second IF and then it is upconverted
to the ﬁnal RF carrier in the case of two-stage upconversion. In the sequel, the
RF signal is ampliﬁed using PA according to the power spectral speciﬁcations
that come from digital radio. A typical PA consists of software tunable atten-
uators for adaptive transmit power level control. The adaptive transmit power
level is an important task for adjusting link quality. The ampliﬁed RF signal
is ﬁltered out and it is radiated to the air through antenna. Depending on the
duplexing method, radio can be classiﬁed into three major groups, which are
Time Division Duplexing (TDD), Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) and
Half-Frequency Division Duplexing (H-FDD) radios [4]. In case of TDD ra-
dios, the transmit/receive switch is used, which is controlled by reconﬁgurable
digital radio. On the other hand, for the FDD radios, duplexer ﬁlter is used
to support simultaneous transmission and reception in diﬀerent bands.
On the receiver side, the received RF signal is ﬁltered out to suppress un-
wanted out-of-band signals. The ﬁltered RF signal is ampliﬁed using LNA.
This unit can have digital attenuators to protect the receiver from the sig-
nals with high power. Furthermore, it can consist of Variable Gain Ampliﬁer
(VGA), which is controlled by the reconﬁgurable digital radio, for RF auto-
matic gain control. The ampliﬁed RF signal is downconverted to a low IF stage
using Software Tunable-Downconverter (ST-DC), which can be performed ei-
ther in one or multiple downconversion stages as well. A typical ST-DC con-
sists of software tunable internal or external AGC with peak detector and
software tunable clock synthesizer. The ST-DC as well as ST-UC can contain
externally selectable IF ﬁlters to support diﬀerent bandwidths. Consequently,
ADC digitizes the analog IF signal and generates the corresponding digital
I/Q samples. Decimation and digital ﬁltering are applied to the samples. In
the following steps, digital radio demodulates the received OFDM signal af-
ter time and frequency synchronization. Software tunable radio components
in this example are implemented using programmable Application Speciﬁc
Integrated Circuit (ASIC) technology. These components are conﬁgured by

4 Software Deﬁned Radio Architectures for Cognitive Radios
115
reconﬁgurable digital radio through Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) and in-
dependent pins. Using SPI and independent conﬁguration signals, reconﬁg-
urable digital radio writes conﬁguration parameters into the registers that are
embedded in software tunable radio components. Moreover, software tunable
radio components can be powered down by the digital radio to save power. For
instance, the components in transmit chain can be switched to power down
mode in the TDD radios when radios receive signal and vice versa.
Another example that can be represented as a model for realistic SDR
architecture is SPEAKeasy program developed by the Department of Defense
(DoD) in the United States (US) [5]. The goal of SPEAKeasy program was to
generate a portable, but not handheld, software programmable radio capable
of emulating more than 10 existing military radios operating from 2 MHz to
2 GHz. These radio systems would be implemented in software instead of the
traditional hardware and could be stored in the systems memory or down-
loaded from the air [6]. SPEAKeasy Phase-I was a lab based rack mounted
proof-of-concept program to demonstrate multi-band and multi-mode opera-
tions between voice networks. SPEAKeasy used DSPs to perform operations
and generate waveforms in software instead of the traditional method of using
hardware. With the completion of Phase I, the program moved into Phase II.
This phase delivered a portable radio and demonstrated that the overall con-
cept of SDR was feasible. Several demonstrations were performed including
the bridging of communications systems, in-ﬁeld re-programming, and in-ﬁeld
repairs using Components OﬀThe Shelf (COTS) [7]. SPEAKeasy was an im-
portant stepping stone towards the largest SDR based program to date, the
Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS). The JTRS is also a DoD initiative to
develop a ﬂexible software programmable radio technology to meet the diverse
communications needs of the military. This includes transmissions of real-time
voice, data, and video across the US military branches as well as with coalition
forces and allies [8]. The JTRS radio technology spans from 2 MHz to 2 GHz
using waveforms that are deﬁned in software using minimal waveform speciﬁc
hardware. The development of these waveforms allows for interoperability
among radios, the reuse of common software across many diﬀerent radios,
and scalability in the number of available channels [9]. The implementation
of these waveforms is based upon a Software Communications Architecture
(SCA). The SCA governs the structure and architecture of the JTRS telling
designers how elements of hardware and software are to operate in harmony
with each other. The development of the SCA is an international eﬀort lead by
the US with help from Japan, Canada, England, and Sweden. Many diﬀerent
commercial and international bodies have embraced the SCA to become the
open international commercial standard for SDRs [9,10]. Using this architec-
ture with a modular design approach gives the JTRS many beneﬁts compared
with the plethora of current systems. Currently, many diﬀerent radio systems
must be carried, maintained, and operated. The JTRS will reduce the to-
tal communications equipments weight and footprint by eliminating multiple
systems. This will also reduce maintenance costs and complexity due to the

116
H¨useyin Arslan and Hasari Celebi
elimination of the equipments and less systems to maintain. Upgrades to the
JTRS should require minimum support, including the introduction of new
waveforms, due to the system being deﬁned in software, which can be up-
graded easily over the air and in the ﬁeld, reducing downtime and increasing
eﬃciency. On the commercial side, there are various eﬀorts on building SDR
platforms, mainly focussed on cellular base stations. Airnet [11] is one of these
companies currently using SDR technology to implement their base stations.
Airnet’s AdaptaCell reduces hardware by 90 processing units handling a dozen
separate channels reducing the number of DSPs and air interface boards. It
also supports GSM, GPRS, and EDGE with adaptive smart antenna con-
trols [11].
4.4 Software Tunable Analog Radio Components
Cognitive engine requires a ﬂexible and tunable analog front-end that can re-
spond to arbitrary tasks. To satisfy such requirements, software tunable analog
radio can be considered as a platform consisting of generic software tunable
components such as software tunable data converters, software tunable-ﬁlters,
software tunable-ampliﬁers, software tunable-duplexing devices, and software
tunable-multiple antenna systems. In this platform, the generic components
are tuned and/or optimized to achieve arbitrary tasks given by cognitive en-
gine through reconﬁgurable digital radio. This structure is illustrated in Fig-
ure 4.4. In this structure, Software Tunable-DAC (ST-DAC) and Software
Tunable-ADC (ST-ADC) are assumed to be part of reconﬁgurable digital ra-
dio platform whereas Software Tunable-Multiple Antenna Systems (ST-MAS)
are considered to be part of software tunable analog radio platform. However,
they can be considered as separate blocks from both platforms depending
on the implementation choice. The software tunable analog radio platform

(ST-DD), Software Tunable-Power Management Circuitry (ST-PMC), Soft-
ware Tunable-Impedance Synthesizer (ST-IS), and ST-MAS. In this section,
the requirements of software tunable analog radio components along with their
design challenges for realizing the above platform are discussed. Moreover, a
discussion on some other state-of-art software tunable radio components such
as ST-DAC, ST-ADC, ST-UC, and ST-DC is provided as well.
4.4.1 Software Tunable-Filters
Ideally, SDR requires IF and RF ﬁlters that can be optimized for given ﬁlter
speciﬁcations such as arbitrary center frequency and bandwidth without com-
promising the performance. The desired performance parameter of such ﬁlters
in SDR are low insertion loss, excellent out-of-band rejection, and high power
handling. Designing such ﬁlters with the current technologies is a challenging
task. However, there are some successful approaches towards this goal such as
the electronically tunable ﬁlter design [12]. This ﬁlter is implemented using
Low Temperature Co-ﬁred Ceramic technology and the tuning elements are
voltage-controlled dielectric capacitors so called Parascan varactors [13]. A
tunable UWB Band Pass Filter (BPF) [14], which is based on ring resonator
structure, is another stepping stone towards achieving the above goal. The
passband of the designed UWB BPF is from 3.8 GHz to 9.2 GHz and tuning
unit is a capacitor shunted to the ground at the end of the stub.
4.4.2 Software Tunable Power Ampliﬁers
PAs are one of the essential components of wireless communications systems.
PAs are used to amplify the signal before transmission so that the signal can
reach to distant receivers with a desired Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). PAs
can be divided into two major groups: linear and nonlinear PAs. Linear PAs
have the advantage of high linearity which is very important for signals with
a wide range of amplitude values. However, they suﬀer from poor power eﬃ-
ciency, limiting their applications in wireless communications systems. On the
other hand, nonlinear PAs can achieve better eﬃciencies with poor linearity in
their responses. The nonlinearity causes several problems like amplitude and
phase distortion (AM-to-AM and AM-to-PM eﬀects) and adjacent channel
regrowth. Power back-oﬀtechnique is widely used in current wireless commu-
nications systems (e.g. WLAN) to remedy the problems due to wide dynamic
signal ranges [15,16]. However, this technique sacriﬁces the eﬃciency and in-
creases the power consumption. On the other hand, baseband linearization
techniques are utilized to predistort the signal, and hence to compensate the
nonlinear eﬀects [17–19]. The eﬃciency and adaptation of linearization algo-
rithms are, therefore, very important. Depending on the mode of operation
and transmitted waveform characteristics, the linearization algorithms need
to be adapted. Digital linearization techniques are often based on a feedback

118
H¨useyin Arslan and Hasari Celebi
scheme and, therefore, able to react to drifts of the nonlinear PAs. Addi-
tionally, PAs generally have embedded digitally controlled VGA to support
adaptive coverage systems in SDR. Furthermore, since PAs are the major
source of power consumption and heat generation in SDR, PAs can operate in
diﬀerent power level modes such as high and low power modes to save power.
By doing this, the temperature of SDR board can be controlled by recon-
ﬁgurable digital radio. In order to achieve high power transmission, highly
eﬃcient and linear multiple PAs can be cascaded.
4.4.3 Software Tunable-Duplexing Devices
Duplexing devices are used to manage transmission and reception process
in transceivers. As previously mentioned, TDD, FDD, and H-FDD are three
major duplexing methods [4]. To support each of these methods in the legacy
radios, diﬀerent hardware components are required, which is costly. For ex-
ample, transmit/receive switch is used for TDD and H-FDD radios whereas
duplexer ﬁlter is employed for FDD radios. It is expected that SDR will sup-
port all these three radio structures and change its structure dynamically
from one to another. Because, each duplexing method has some advantages,
which cognitive engine can beneﬁt from them. For instance, TDD radios are
popularly known structure to be used for the unlicensed bands operation due
to more relaxed regulations (e.g. output noise level) in these bands compared
to the licensed bands [4]. By considering opportunistic spectrum usage capa-
bility of cognitive radio, it can reconﬁgure SDR as TDD or H-FDD radios
when it operates in the unlicensed bands. When the licensed bands are uti-
lized temporarily, cognitive engine can conﬁgure SDR as an FDD radio. Using
transmit/receive switch and duplexer ﬁlter to support these three radio struc-
tures is not a practical solution. Furthermore, the current duplexer ﬁlters
are designed for speciﬁc frequency plan. There is a need to develop a single
hardware component or ﬁnd a solution to support various duplexing meth-
ods in SDR. One way of achieving this goal is to develop a software tunable
component that functions as a transmit/receive switch and duplexer ﬁlter. Al-
ternatively, employing software tunable antenna pair eliminates the need for
transmit/receive switch and duplexer ﬁlter, which the details of this approach
can be found in [2].
4.4.4 Software Tunable Antenna Systems
Antennas are essential components of any radio system. An antenna radiation
pattern (half power beamwidth) and gain are the two important character-
istics that aﬀect the system coverage and performance. Many of the current
antennas are designed to operate for a speciﬁc frequency range and bandwidth.
In SDR, it is important that the antenna would have uniform characteristics
over a broad range of frequencies. In other words, ideal SDR requires software

4 Software Deﬁned Radio Architectures for Cognitive Radios
119
tunable antenna that its performance can be optimized for an arbitrary cen-
ter frequency and bandwidth provided by cognitive engine. Also, the need for
multi-band and UWB antennas is increasing. Reconﬁgurable antennas, smart
antennas, and Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output antenna (MIMO) systems
are already becoming an integral part of wireless communications systems and
they will certainly take a major role in SDR.
The type of antenna that could satisfy the aforementioned SDR antenna
requirements is a current research topic. However, shorted patch antenna is
one of the approaches for SDR implementation due to its small size, low
cost, and omni-directional patterns. In [2], shorted patch antenna based elec-
tronically tunable antenna for SDR is proposed. The antenna is controlled
by antenna control unit, which is composed of Field-Eﬀect Transistor (FET)
switches and FPGAs. These switches are employed to change the electrical
length of the antenna. FPGAs control these switches based on the information
that is received from the DSP, which can be thought as a cognitive engine in
this context. With this structure the cognitive engine can tune the antenna to
a speciﬁc frequency plan. Due to the importance of antenna systems in SDR,
there will be some more discussions on this subject later in this chapter.
4.4.5 Software Tunable Impedance Synthesizers
Software tunable impedance synthesizer plays a key role in the optimization
of entire software tunable analog radio for achieving a task given by cogni-
tive engine. In cognitive radios, characteristics of the radio (e.g. RF carrier
frequency or bandwidth) are dynamic. It is well known that if one of the
fundamental characteristics of analog radio is changed, impedance matching
network of the components (at least the aﬀected ones) needs to be optimized.
For instance, input impedance of antenna in mobile systems is one of the most
frequently changeable radio parameters due to the mobility. A change in the
input impedance of antenna results in impedance mismatch between power
module and antenna. Such mismatches can deteriorate the performance of
radio signiﬁcantly, even it can be damaged [20,21]. For instance, the reﬂected
power due to the mismatch reduces the radiated power, which deteriorate the
eﬃciency. In such case, radio needs to increase power level resulting in the
reduction of battery life. In case of not pumping additional power, QoS is de-
graded. Note that the reﬂected power can damage radio components if there
is no protection circuit. In order to eliminate the problems and degradation
due to the impedance mismatching, software tunable impedance synthesizers
are placed between software tunable radio components to perform impedance
matching whenever the software tunable analog radio is reconﬁgured.
The underlying topology of the most software tunable impedance syn-
thesizers are based on generic low-pass pi-network topology as shown in
Figure 4.5. This topology consists of variable inductor (L) and capacitors
(C1,1, . . . , C1,N1, C2,1, . . . , C2,N2). The more the number of capacitors (N1,
N2) employed, the better the tunability is achieved. By varying these values

the impedance matching is achieved. Cognitive engine determines the values
of these components. This is achieved by providing operating frequency plan
and range of impedances to be matched information to reconﬁgurable digital
radio.
4.4.6 Software Tunable-Power Management Circuitry
Power management circuitry is an integral part of complex board design that
consists of discrete components. These components can require diﬀerent volt-
age supplies in a predeﬁned sequence. Moreover, reconﬁguring radio compo-
nents may require resetting the entire software tunable analog radio platform.
A Software Tunable-Power Management Circuitry (ST-PMC) can be incor-
porated into software tunable analog radio platform to supply an arbitrary
voltage to radio components.
4.4.7 Software Tunable Data Converters
The principle feature of SDR is that the capabilities and operation of radio can
be reconﬁgured eﬃciently on-the-air, rather than at the time of design. Re-
conﬁgurable blocks in SDR systems oﬀer easy changes to radio characteristics
such as channel coding/decoding methods, modulation types, multiple ac-
cess schemes, frequency spreading/despreading algorithms, operating carrier
frequencies, and bandwidths. Traditional hardware radio requires hardware
changes to modify these fundamental characteristics of radios. Data convert-
ers (ADC and DAC) constitute the interface (boundary) between the analog
and digital world. Therefore, conducting more of processing digitally requires
moving data converters towards antenna.
A typical ADC consists of a sampler followed by a quantizer. Sampling rate
is one of the important features of ADCs. One of the limitations towards ideal
SDR is the sampling rate requirements as the bandwidth of the signal before
ADC must be smaller than half of the sampling rate according to the Nyquist
theorem. Quantizer converts the discrete samples (with continuous amplitude
levels) into bits with a word length. The word length determines the resolution

4 Software Deﬁned Radio Architectures for Cognitive Radios
121
of ADC and also determines the quantization error. In addition to the quan-
tization noise, distortions due to the static and dynamic nonlinearity features
of ADCs also aﬀect the performance of ADC. Signal-to-Noise-and-Distortion
(SINAD) is the ratio of the root-mean-square (rms) signal amplitude to the
mean value of the root-sum-square of all other spectral components, includ-
ing harmonics, but excluding DC. SINAD is a good indication of the overall
dynamic performance of an ADC, because it includes all components which
make up noise and distortion. Due to the distortions, the Eﬀective Number
Of Bits (ENOB) that speciﬁes the dynamic performance of an ADC at a
speciﬁc frequency, amplitude, and sampling rate will be diﬀerent than what
is expected from an ideal ADC that only includes the quantization noise.
Since cognitive radio requires receiving diﬀerent waveforms with diﬀerent
operating center frequency and bandwidth, SDR needs to have a capability
of reconﬁguring ADC dynamically. In order to support such capability, the
sampling rate, resolution, SINAD of the ADC needs to be optimized and
reconﬁgured by reconﬁgurable digital radio. Reconﬁgurable digital radio re-
quires to have capability of monitoring the above parameters of ADC in order
to optimize its performance. This is the case as well for all the aforemen-
tioned software tunable analog radio components. For instance, sampling rate
can be changed by reconﬁguring clock circuit management block, which is
responsible to generate and supply any type of clock signal to reconﬁgurable
blocks. Note that the phase noise of clock signal plays an important role on
the performance of SDR. Therefore, dynamically generated clock signal needs
to be clean and satisfy minimum phase noise level dictated by reconﬁgurable
digital radio.
A generalized DAC structure consists of DAC register, resistor string and
followed by output buﬀer ampliﬁer blocks is given in [22]. We refer to [22,23]
for the basic operation of DAC. Similar to ADC, the main characteristics of
DACs are resolution, maximum sampling rate, monotonicity, dynamic range,
and phase distortion. Monitoring the parameters related to these character-
istics is required to support adaptive transmission mandated by cognitive
engine. Based on the feedback information from DAC, its performance can be
optimized by reconﬁgurable digital radio.
4.4.8 Software Tunable-Upconverters and Downconverters
Since the functional block diagram of ST-UC and ST-DC are identical, the
discussion in this section is based on ST-UC. A basic ST-UC is composed of
a mixer and software tunable frequency synthesizer, which is shown in Fig-
ure 4.6. SDR requires a mixer that support large input frequency range and
it is desirable that mixer to have image rejection capability (Image Rejection
Mixer (IRM)). Furthermore, the main features of software tunable frequency
synthesizers are ultra-low phase noise and high precision tunability (small
step size). The main source of the phase noise is the reference clock. This is
generated from reconﬁgurable clock distributor and it is required to generate

122

reference clock signals with ultra-low phase noise. The synthesizer lock detec-
tion signal is usually monitored by reconﬁgurable digital radio to make sure
the synthesizer is locked to the desired frequency. In case of employing single-
stage upconversion, local oscillator in the synthesizer is required to support
large frequency range. Alternatively, multiple-stage upconversion can be em-
ployed in SDR. This approach provides some advantages over the single-stage
case, but with the use of additional components. By employing multiple-stage
upconversion in SDR, the requirements of mixer and frequency synthesizers
are relaxed. For instance, local oscillators with smaller frequency range are
needed to upconvert the signal to any carrier frequency. Furthermore, the per-
formance of SDR can be improved by suppressing the harmonics at the output
of ST-UC with multiple steps. Note that upconversion and downconversion
have been performed digitally according to the structure in Figure 4.4. Such
approach eliminates use of ST-UC and ST-DC components in transceivers.
4.5 Antenna Systems
The primitive communications systems have employed single-antenna sys-
tems. However, as the QoS requirements increase wireless communications
systems require more capacity and bandwidth. In other words, wireless de-
vices become more capacity and bandwidth intensive. Moreover, improving
performance of wireless communications systems through coding and signal-
ing has already been exploited [1]. To push the capacity, spectrum eﬃciency,
data rate, and robustness of wireless links further, multiple antenna systems
and associated technologies such as smart antennas along with beamforming,
MIMO systems, and adaptive MIMO systems can be employed [1,25,26,34].
Multiple antenna systems play a signiﬁcant role in cognitive radio and
SDR. Multiple antennas can be used to exploit the spatial dimension of spec-
trum space and exploit the spatial spectrum (through beamforming) space to

4 Software Deﬁned Radio Architectures for Cognitive Radios
123
improve the eﬃciency. Spatial dimension of the spectrum space can be ex-
ploited very eﬃciently by multiple antenna transmitters and receivers. Each
of the multi-antenna techniques in their own way directly or indirectly helps
to exploit the spectrum space. In essence, multi-antenna systems can help to
ﬁnd spectral opportunities in the spatial domain and can help to exploit these
opportunities fully.
Similarly, multiple antenna systems can be used to increase capacity, peak
data rates, and range of communication. Hence, multiple antennas can allow
additional capabilities to adapt the system and network parameters. For ex-
ample, multiple antennas can be exploited for multiple purposes depending
on the input from the sensing units. In some cases, multiple antennas can be
used to increase the data rate when the channel is rich and good. In some
other cases, multiple antennas can be used for diversity when the fading is
signiﬁcant and channel is having deep fades. Moreover, these systems can be
used to compensate the shadowing eﬀect, expand the network coverage, and
improve power eﬃciency.
From the implementation point of view, multiple antenna systems re-
quire computationally complex digital signal processing and implementing
these systems using traditional analog radio technologies is burdensome and
costly. However, SDR is a promising approach to realize multiple antenna sys-
tems in wireless communications with reasonable complexity and cost [27–29].
In this section, we discuss the implementation challenges and beneﬁts of the
aforementioned systems along with SDR in mind.
4.5.1 MIMO Systems
MIMO systems have potential to improve data rate, channel capacity, diver-
sity, and robustness of wireless communications systems [1,25,34]. Driven by
multimedia based applications, anticipated future wireless applications will
require high data rate capable systems. Novel techniques like MIMO oﬀer
promising choices for future high data rate systems. MIMO employs multiple
antennas at the transmitter and receiver sides to open up additional subchan-
nels in spatial domain. Since the parallel channels are established over the
same time and frequency, high data rates can be achieved without the need of
extra bandwidth. Due to this bandwidth eﬃciency, eﬀorts are in progress to
include MIMO in the standards of future Broadband Wireless Access (BWA).
MIMO channel can be described as a K × L matrix, where K is the num-
ber of transmit antennas and L is the number of receive antennas as shown
in Figure 4.7. This is in contrast to the channel of a traditional Single-Input
Single-Output antenna (SISO) system. Every receiver antenna captures a sig-
nal that has components from every transmitter antenna. There are two basic
types of MIMO systems. The ﬁrst is known as Space Time Coding (STC) and
the second is known as Spatial Multiplexing (SM) [25]. The former is usually
used to maximize the spatial diversity in MIMO channels whereas the latter is
employed to maximize transmission rate. As a result, the way of transmitting

124

information over the wireless channel is diﬀerent in these two techniques. In
STC-MIMO, the incoming serial data stream is replicated on every transmit
antenna while in SM-MIMO the incoming serial data stream is broken up
into distinct substreams that are then fed to the diﬀerent transmit antennas.
A basic block diagram of STC-MIMO and SM-MIMO systems are shown in
Figures 4.7 and 4.8, respectively. The diﬀerence between these two types of
MIMO systems can be seen by examining Figures 4.7 and 4.8. Implement-
ing both of these computationally complex algorithms using legacy hardware
analog radio is impractical and costly. Once again, SDR is a promising so-
lution to implement both of these algorithms in reconﬁgurable digital radio
system. Depending on the optimization criteria, cognitive engine can select
the appropriate MIMO signaling.

4 Software Deﬁned Radio Architectures for Cognitive Radios
125
To attain the best performance in a MIMO system, the signals received
at the receive antennas need to be as uncorrelated as possible. If the signals
are not completely uncorrelated, it means that the columns of the channel
matrix are not linearly independent. In other words, some of the contained
channel data is redundant and is not contributing to capacity. This situation
causes the matrix not to be of full rank. So, performance will suﬀer in that
case. Typically, in a rich scattering environment, the required separation of
the antennas is cited to be at least half a wavelength.
MIMO and multi-antenna systems bring out a new dimension to wireless
channels. The spatial dimension will be used in the future communications
systems for further improvement of the bandwidth and power eﬃciency. How-
ever, this dimension and the related parameter estimates need to be under-
stood well. Research on parameter estimation for fast and accurate calculation
of spatial selectivity, angular spread, antenna correlation, etc. is needed. Also,
further research is required on the eﬀect of mutual coupling between antenna
elements, the eﬀect of near-ﬁeld scatterers on antenna patterns and antenna
correlations, exploitation of pattern selectivity when the spatial selectivity is
not enough, and generation of a desired pattern selectivity between antenna
elements adaptively.
As described earlier, MIMO systems can provide huge capacity and im-
proved performance gains by exploiting spatial selectivity of the channel. How-
ever, these gains, in reality, depend heavily on the statistical properties of the
channel and the correlations between antenna elements. Among the factors
that aﬀect the antenna correlation are the characteristics of the scattering en-
vironment. Therefore, an optimal way of using multiple-antenna systems de-
pends on the situation awareness. If the transmitter knows the instantaneous
channel gains (the MIMO channel matrix), it can adapt the transmission to
maximize the capacity of the MIMO system. Similarly, the instantaneous an-
tenna correlation values can be exploited to adapt the transmission. In many
cases, estimation of the perfect instantaneous channel state and antenna corre-
lation information, and feeding this information back to the transmitter might
not be possible. This is the case especially when the mobility is high. Instead,
other parameter measures like partial (statistical) channel information, aver-
age channel selectivity, or angular spread would be useful for adapting the
transmitter and receiver. Advanced signal processing techniques to calculate
this partial channel and correlation information are needed.
Note that MIMO systems employing STC methods require antenna sys-
tems to be uncorrelated. Hence, the spacing between two consecutive antenna
systems need to be large enough to satisfy this requirement. Functional block
diagram of generalized SDR architecture with K × L MIMO system is shown
in Figure 4.5.1. In this architecture, SDR has K number of transmit and L
number of antennas. Although the number of transmit and receive antenna
are ﬁxed in the conventional hardware analog radio structures, the number of
transmit and receive antennas can be changed easily by powering down the re-
quired number of antenna branches. Moreover, the parameters (e.g. operating

frequency) of each antenna of MIMO systems in conventional hardware ana-
log radio structures are not reconﬁgurable. However, these parameters can
be reconﬁgured in SDR structures. In SDR architecture, MIMO signaling
techniques and algorithms are implemented in reconﬁgurable digital radio
platform.
Another recent approach in multiple antenna systems is adaptive (smart)
MIMO, where MIMO systems are enhanced with adaptive beamforming ca-
pability [26]. The main goal in adaptive MIMO systems is to maximize the
resources oﬀered in multiple antenna channels by using optimal algorithms.
Moreover, the key design consideration for adaptive MIMO systems is the op-
timization of spacing between two consecutive antennas. This is because adap-
tive beamforming systems require antennas to be highly correlated whereas
MIMO systems require them to be low correlated. The antenna spacing can be
adjusted through reconﬁgurable antenna systems in adaptive MIMO systems.
Adaptive beamforming can be easily incorporated to SDR-MIMO structure
by implementing beamforming algorithms in reconﬁgurable digital radio [26].
Hence, the SDR-MIMO structure in Figure 4.5.1 can be used for the adaptive
MIMO systems as well.
4.5.2 Smart Antennas and Beamforming
Wireless networks are interference limited systems. Smart antennas or an-
tenna beamforming reduces the interference level signiﬁcantly by exploiting
the spatial dimension. Compared to using omni-directional antennas, inter-
ference is reduced partially in current wireless networks by employing sector
antennas. However, this type of interference is still signiﬁcant and it makes
overall system interference limited.
The basic idea behind the smart antenna technology is to form the antenna
beam in such a way that the main lobe is directed to the desired user while
the nulls of the beam are allocated to the interfering users. A sample smart
antenna pattern is shown in Figure 4.10.
A typical smart antenna system consists of array of antennas that col-
lectively generate the desired array pattern. This transmission and reception
method using antenna arrays along with advanced signal processing in recon-
ﬁgurable digital hardware is referred as beamforming. Functional block dia-
gram of generalized SDR architecture (transmitter side) with smart antennas
capability is shown in Figure 4.11. Each antenna system has its own software
tunable analog radio transmit side (ST-AR Tx side) and ST-ADC (these
components are discussed in Section 4) as shown in Figure 4.11. However,
the rest of circuitry, which is beamforming algorithms that are implemented
in reconﬁgurable digital radio platform, is shared by all antenna systems.
In beamforming algorithms, each user’s signal is multiplied with complex
weights that adjust the magnitude and phase of the signal that goes to or
comes from each antenna system. As a result, these algorithms generate trans-
mit/receive beam at the output of antenna arrays in the direction of the

desired user while minimize the interference to other users [30]. There are
mainly two types of beamforming methods, which are switched and adaptive
beamforming. In switched beamforming, the complex weights are selected
from a library of coeﬃcients that form beams in predeﬁned directions. On the
other hand, the complex weights are computed and adapted in real time in
the case of adaptive beamforming [30].
In summary, we have discussed the advanced multiple antenna systems
that require computation intensive algorithms. Such algorithms can be han-
dled by SDR structure, which is a crucial part of cognitive radios. Cognitive
radios can enhance channel capacity, diversity, robustness of wireless links and
reduce the overall interference in the networks.
4.6 Reconﬁgurable Digital Radio Technologies
Primitive wireless systems were implemented using hardwired platform. The
transition from hardwired to reconﬁgurable digital platform happens gradu-
ally as the digital technology evolves. This evolution starts with the intro-
duction of Transistor–Transistor Logic (TTL) technology followed by general
purpose processors (or Microprocessors) that is programmed through soft-
ware. This trend continued with the development of microprocessor that is
specialized in digital signal processing tasks, which is DSP. The need for high
speed signal processing technology increased due to the low speed of DSP
and adoption of computationally complex algorithms in the wireless systems.
ASIC technology came to the scene to answer the demands on high speed sig-
nal processing. Then, inﬂexibility of ASIC technology motivated scientists to
develop ﬂexible and reconﬁgurable digital hardware technology. FPGAs tech-
nology came to the rescue, which provides both ﬂexibility and reconﬁgurabil-
ity. However, these features come with high power consumption and high cost.
Hence, trend is moving towards development of reconﬁgurable, ﬂexible, high
performance, low power, small size, and low cost digital hardware platforms.
In this line, there are some recent reconﬁgurable computing technologies such
as PicoArray processors from PicoChip [31] and Adaptive Computing Machine
(ACM) from QuickSilver technologies [32]. Therefore, these technologies can
be categorized under two groups;
1. Traditional Computing Technologies: The technologies in this category is
based on the idea of mapping the algorithm to a ﬁxed set of hardware
resources and/or requirements. The technologies that can be considered
under this category are DSP, ASIC, and FPGAs.
2. Adaptive Computing Technologies: The basic idea behind this approach
is to map the hardware resources and/or requirements to the algorithm
requirements. Both hardware resources and algorithm requirements are
dynamic. In other words, optimum amount of hardware resources are uti-
lized to perform the given algorithm. General Purpose Processors (GPPs),
PicoArray, and ACM [33] are three examples in this category.

These two approaches are illustrated in Figure 4.12. Similar to software tun-
able analog radio platform, ideal reconﬁgurable digital radio platform needs to
have a capability to perform any arbitrary tasks that are given by cognitive
engine. Three major areas of advance are required in order to provide dy-
namic processing capabilities essential to realize cognitive radio technologies.
These areas are baseband component technologies, design tools and methods,
and system maintenance. The challenges and concerns regarding each of these
areas are summarized in [34]. In this section, we discuss the existing recon-
ﬁgurable digital hardware technologies excluding the ASIC, picoArray, and
ACM and provide their main architectures, pros and cons. The following are
six main selection criteria that is recommended to be considered during the
process of evaluating a reconﬁgurable digital platform for SDR applications:
• Reconﬁgurability: The ability to reconﬁgure a device to perform an arbi-
trary task that is given by cognitive engine.
• Integration to Other Layers: The level of complexity required to establish
interface to the other layers.
• Development Cycle: The time that takes to develop, implement, debug,
and verify a digital radio function. Ideally, cognitive engine needs to have
a capability of performing the above development steps. However, it is
recommended to provide bug-free veriﬁed digital radio functions to cogni-
tive engine in reality. One way of achieving this is to store all the digital
radio functions in a memory.
• Performance: The ability to perform a given arbitrary task within a spec-
iﬁed time.
• Power Consumption: The amount of power that is dissipated for perform-
ing a given task within a speciﬁed time.
• Cost: The cost of reconﬁgurable digital radio platform is an important
parameter.
• Size: The physical size of the processor is another important criteria.

4.6.1 Digital Signal Processors
DSP is a type of GPP that is specialized on signal processing applications.
DSPs and GPPs have common functions, however, the former supports ad-
ditional specialized functions such as Multiply–ACcumulate (MAC), barrel
shifter, multiple memory blocks with supporting buses, and powerful Data
Address Generators (DAGENs) [35]. DSPs have ﬁxed processing architecture
and they are able to execute diﬀerent algorithms based on the sequential in-
structions that are stored in memory. However, their inherent ﬁxed processing
structure place restrictions on initial design.
Most of the current DSP processors employ modiﬁed Harvard architec-
ture, which is shown in Figure 4.13. According to this architecture, it can be
accessed to data and program memory within a single cycle using either two
(program and data) or three (program and two data) buses. DSPs can process
the signals either using ﬁxed-point or ﬂoating-point arithmetic. However, most
of the computations are performed using the latter format. The main advan-
tage of ﬂoating-point over ﬁxed-point arithmetic is the use of numbers with
much larger dynamic range, which is important in many digital signal process-
ing operations. The current DSPs have a capability of providing high speed
clocks and parallel processing. However, both wireless service providers and
manufacturers are beginning to acknowledge that the current DSPs cannot
satisfy the requirements of SDR applications.
Although the design ﬂow of DSP are well documented in the literature
and supported by mature design tools, it cannot handle complex algorithms.
For instance, multiple DSPs can be required in order to implement a complex
algorithm. However, it is a tedious process to integrate multiple DSPs since
the design tools for this purpose are less mature and more sophisticated.
As a result, DSPs provide high reconﬁgurability with limited performance and

short development cycle. Moreover, they oﬀer medium level of integration and
consume low power. Additionally, DSPs are low cost and small size devices.
4.6.2 Field-Programmable Gate Arrays
In the beginning of 1960s, discrete logic were used to build systems consisted
of many chips that are connected with wires. Modifying such systems required
rebuilding the board, which took long time and it was costly. Chip manufac-
turers introduced Programmable Logic Device (PLD) that is a single chip and
composed of an array of unconnected AND–OR gates. The PLDs contained
an array of fuses that could be blown open or left closed to connect numerous
inputs to each AND gate. Since PLDs could handle up to 20 logic equations
designing complex systems using multiple PLDs was a challenging process. To
tackle this problem, chip makers introduced Complex PLDs (CPLD) and FP-
GAs. A CPLD composed of bunch of PLD blocks whose inputs and outputs
are governed by global interconnection matrix. CPLDs provide two levels of
reconﬁgurability; reconﬁguring the PLD blocks and interconnections between
them. The structure of a CPLD is shown in Figure 4.14.
The structure of FPGAs is diﬀerent than that of CPLDs. The FPGAs
are composed of an array of simple and Conﬁgurable Logic Blocks (CLBs)
and switches that are utilized to determine the connections between CLBs.
A simpliﬁed structure of FPGAs is shown in Figure 4.15. In order to imple-
ment an algorithm in the FPGAs, each CLB is conﬁgured individually ﬁrst
and then switches are conﬁgured to connect or disconnect CLBs. Although
there are diﬀerent methods for connecting and disconnecting CLBs, the most
widely used technique is based on use of RAM/ﬂash switches. In this method,
static RAM or ﬂash bits are used to control the pass transistors for each in-
terconnection. For instance, the switch can be closed or opened by loading bit
1 or 0, respectively. Since the current FPGAs can contain up to 10 million
gates, manual control of switches is impossible. Therefore, FPGAs manufac-
turers provide development softwares that take logic design as input and then
outputs a bitstream, which conﬁgures the switches.

Fig. 4.15. FPGAs structure.
In the sequel, the main steps of development software for the implementa-
tion of a logic design in the FPGAs are provided. The description of logic de-
sign can be entered mainly in three ways: 1) Using high-level software such as
MATLAB/Simulink. 2) Using Hardware Description Languages (HDL) such
as VHDL and Verilog. 3) Using schematic editor. In the ﬁrst approach, the
system is designed by connecting functional blocks in high-level system de-
sign and then interface software is used to translate the design into VHDL
codes. For instance, a complete OFDM transceiver can be designed in MAT-
LAB/Simulink. In order to download this design into the FPGAs, Xilinx Sys-
tem Generator [36] can be used as an interface between MATLAB/Simulink
and Xilinx ISE Foundation to perform automatic code generation. In the sec-
ond method, the design is entered as a code using HDLs. On the other hand,
the design can be drawn using a schematic editor. Regardless of the design
entry method, the consequent steps are common. Once the design is entered,
logic synthesizer tools transform the HDL code or schematic into a netlist.
A netlist describes various logic gates and the interconnection between them.
Consequently, implementation tools are used to map logic gates and intercon-
nections into FPGAs. The mapping tool combines the netlist logic gates as a
group and generates the Look-Up-Tables (LUTs). This is followed by place and
route processes, which assign the collections of logic gates to the speciﬁc CLBs
and determine the status of switches using routing matrices to connect the
CLBs. Once the implementation process is completed, the program generates
routing matrices that show the ﬁnal status of switches. From routing matri-
ces, a bitstream where ones and zeros correspond to opened or closed switch

134
H¨useyin Arslan and Hasari Celebi
is generated. The bitstream is downloaded into physical FPGAs chip through
parallel cable. The switches in FPGAs are opened or closed in response to the
binary bits in the bitstream. Finally, FPGAs perform the operations speciﬁed
by the design entry. The design can be veriﬁed in diﬀerent ways. The classical
way of veriﬁcation is to insert a test signal and observe the output signal using
test and measurement equipments. Another way, which is a modern way, is to
generate test signals from high-level program, download the design into FP-
GAs, read back the results from the FPGAs, and plot the results in high-level
software. For instance, MATLAB/Simulink along with Xilinx System Gener-
ator and ISE Foundation allow to verify the design using hardware co-sim,
which is a second type method. Note that the aforementioned steps in the
FPGAs design ﬂow are performed by softwares automatically.
In conclusion, FPGAs have a capability of providing high degree of recon-
ﬁgurability and high-level performance. Furthermore, they provide high level
of integration and short development cycle. However, they are power-hungry,
large size, and expensive devices.
4.6.3 General Purpose Processors
One of the reconﬁgurable digital hardware technologies is GPP [37–39]. Von
Neumman and Harvard are two well-known GPP architectures in the litera-
ture. The main diﬀerences between these two architectures are the storage, uti-
lization of instructions, and data. In Von Neumman architecture, instructions
and data are stored into the same memory. On the other hand, instructions
and data are stored into separate memory in the Harvard structures. Most of
the current GPPs are based on Von Neumman architecture. However, Har-
vard architecture based GPPs are commonly available as well. The simpliﬁed
block diagram of Von Neumman architecture is shown in Figure 4.16. The
current GPPs do not have a capability to satisfy dynamic reconﬁguration
requirements. The main drawback of these devices is low data throughput
due to all data being transferred via the processor bus. Moreover, they are
power-hungry, costly and large size devices relative to the other processors.

However, they have potential advantages that cognitive engine beneﬁts from
them. Some of these advantages are [37]:
• Experimentation: Testing new algorithms or protocols is easy in these
devices.
• Rapid Deployment: Cognitive radio users can easily add new devices or
improvements to the existing structure through software.
• Tight Integration with the Other Applications: Since the upper layer appli-
cations and underlying communications systems are implemented in the
same device, these upper and radio layers are tightly integrated.
• Multi Purpose Devices: Diﬀerent devices such as fax, VoIP capabilities
can be added to cognitive radios through software.
• Improved Functionality: These devices have the capability of allocating
diﬀerent channels to diﬀerent communications standards.
The illustration of GPP based reconﬁgurable digital radio platform is provided
in Figure 4.17. According to this structure, both upper layers and reconﬁg-
urable digital radio functions are implemented in GPP, which provides a tight
integration between these upper layers and reconﬁgurable digital radio layer.
In [37], such GPP based software radio architecture that is so called virtual
radio is proposed. In this software radio structure, GPP is used as reconﬁg-
urable digital hardware platform and it is optimized to be suitable for software
radio applications. Moreover, design tools and programming environment for
this structures that is so called Spectra is developed. The Spectra is a pro-
gramming tool that is used to support continuous real-time signal processing
applications. This system design tool consists of three basics components [37]:
• A library for signal processing modules (e.g. convulotional encoder, Fast
Fourier Transform (FFT)).
• A set of objects that is used to interconnect signal processing modules.
• A scripting language such as C++ to deﬁne the topology of system and
interactions between the modules.
As a result, GPPs have the capability of providing high degree of reconﬁg-
urability with limited performance due to their inherent architectures. Their
development cycle is very short and they oﬀer high level of integration. More-
over, they are power-hungry, small size, and expensive devices.

4.6.4 Heterogeneous Systems
It has been observed and reported that all reconﬁgurable technologies
have some strengths and weaknesses. Another type of reconﬁgurable digital
hardware platform is to integrate multiple diﬀerent technologies to perform
a certain task. It is obvious that the level of integration is low in this type
of platforms since it introduces additional diﬀerent type of processor. How-
ever, there are some performance gain due to partitioning the tasks between
the processors. One of the well-known platforms for this approach is hybrid
DSP/FPGAs platform. Many of the FPGA strengths are complementary to
the weaknesses of DSPs while the strengths of the DSPs are complementary
to the weaknesses of the FPGAs. A system incorporating both processors has
the ability to leverage the strengths of both processors [40,41]. Such platforms
are called hybrid DSP/FPGAs and the commercial hybrid DSP/FPGAs are
available such as SignalWAVE from Lyrtech. This conclusion can be seen from
Table 4.1, where the strengths and weaknesses of both DSPs and FPGAs are
tabulated.
The system-level design ﬂow of Lyrtech hybrid DSP/FPGAs platform is
shown in Figure 4.18. As it can be seen from the ﬁgure that both processors
are integrated to the MATLAB/Simulink where the design is entered. Then,
each processor has its own chain of interface softwares that automatically
generate the design codes. For the FPGAs, it can be either VHDL or Verilog
code whereas it is C code for the DSPs. Consequently, processor-speciﬁc soft-
ware converts the codes into conﬁguration ﬁles. Then, they are downloaded
into the corresponding physical chips. The following are some common design
considerations for hybrid DSP/FPGAs platforms:
• Since task partitioning among the processors can aﬀect the performance
of hybrid DSP/FPGAs platform signiﬁcantly, this process needs to be
performed carefully.
• Interaction between two processors needs to be understood very well. Oth-
erwise, it results in performance degradation.
• DSPs use “software design ﬂow” whereas FPGAs use “hardware design
ﬂow.” Hence, there is a little overlap between the skill set of the relevant
design teams.
• Linking two processors is a complex task. These hybrid platforms are
integrated at the board level (not at high level).
• High-level abstractions that are used for communication between the
DSPs and FPGAs are practically nonexistent.

Technologies
Each aforementioned technologies have their own performance criteria. For
instance, Millions of Instructions Per Second (MIPS) is a common perfor-
mance criteria that is used to determine the speed of DSPs. On the other

the FPGAs. However, the speed of processors is often speciﬁed in terms of

Millions of Floating-Point Operations per Second (MFLOPS). The theoreti-
cal peak MFLOPS parameter gives maximum possible speed for the proces-
sors. This parameter allows comparison of the processing speed of diﬀerent
processors and allows determination of the time required to perform certain
algorithms.
Many diﬀerent benchmarks such as SPEC, Whetstone, Dhyrstone, and
Linpack are used to compare the speed of diﬀerent processors. Each bench-
mark provides a number indicating the relative speed of processing based on
testing various tasks. Since there is not any comprehensive study that com-
pare the performance of all the technologies discussed in this section against
to a benchmark, we compared these technologies based on the six criteria that
is mentioned previously and the results are tabulated in Table 4.2.
4.7 Basic Digital Radio Components
In the previous section, enabling technologies for digital radio system are
discussed. In this section, some of the commonly used digital radio compo-
nents (functions) are presented brieﬂy. Even though diﬀerent standards and
technologies require diﬀerent digital radio blocks, in this section, we will only

focus on the commonly used blocks. A basic digital radio includes the follow-
ing components: source encoder/decoder, channel encoder/decoder, symbol
mapping/demapping, pulse shaping, digital upconversion/downconversion,
synchronization, channel estimation, channel equalization, detector, soft in-
formation generator. A simpliﬁed functional block diagram of digital radio
systems that contains some of these components is illustrated in Figure 4.7.
There are also technology and standard speciﬁc components like FFT, In-
verse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT), randomization/derandomization, rake
reception/combining, beamforming, antenna combining, MIMO, interfer-
ence cancelation, various channel quality and channel parameter estimation
blocks, encryption/decryption, multiplexing/demultiplexing (time, frequency,
code, space division multiplexing), frequency spreading/despreading (direct-
sequence, time-hopping), peak-to-average-power-ratio reduction, and so on.
Source encoding is the process of eﬃciently converting the information
generated by source (either analog or digital signal) into a sequence of binary
digits [42]. The main objective in source coding is to represent the information

140

4 Software Deﬁned Radio Architectures for Cognitive Radios
141
from source by as less binary digits as possible without compromising recon-
struction ﬁdelity. Source encoding consists of two main subprocess, which are
formatting and data compression [43]. In formatting step, analog information
from source is converted into the digital signal. It is obvious that if informa-
tion is in digital format, there is no need for the formatting. The following step
is data compression without sacriﬁcing reconstruction ﬁdelity. Data compres-
sion is achieved by removing the redundancy from the information. Removing
redundancy in transmitted signal improves the eﬃciency of bandwidth uti-
lization, which is the main advantage of using source encoding in digital com-
munications systems. Some of the well-known source coding techniques are
Pulse Code Modulation (PCM), diﬀerential PCM, delta modulation, Linear
Predictive Coding (LPC), and Huﬀman coding. For speech (which has been
the primary type of source data in cellular radio systems) vocoders are popu-
larly used. Even though vocoders are more complex than the waveform coders,
they require much lower data rates (and hence spectrally more eﬃcient) with
relatively small degradation in speech quality.
While source encoding removes the undesired redundancy, channel encod-
ing introduces intelligent redundancy to the transmitted information. The in-
troduced redundancy by the channel encoder is very important at the receiver
to correct bit errors and detect the frame errors. Especially, channel encoding
is very important for wireless communications systems (where channel fading
and interference limit the performance) to improve the overall performance
of the system and provide a desired quality of service. Channel encoding can
be classiﬁed as “error detection coding” and “error correction coding.” As
in source encoding, there are various types of channel codes like block codes
(Hamming, Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), Reed-solomon, etc.), convolu-
tional codes, and turbo codes. Puncturing and depuncturing are also used
along with the convolutional codes (and turbo codes) to obtain the desired
code rates from the mother codes.
In wireless communications systems, Forward Error Correction (FEC) cod-
ing is often employed with interleaving to optimize the FEC performance.
Interleaving is a mean of adding time diversity to a signal without adding
any redundant bits. The main function of interleaving is to jumble the bits
before the transmission so that the errors will be diversiﬁed at the receiver
rather than having bursty errors. This way the channel decoding corrects small
number of bit errors.
After the channel encoding, the binary bits are mapped to symbols using
symbol mapping block. Although there are numerous symbol mapping schemes
in the literature, the most popularly used symbol mapping techniques are
Phase Shift Keying (PSK), Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK), and Frequency
Shift Keying (FSK), and Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM). Pulse
modulation methods such as Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM), Pulse Po-
sition Modulation (PPM), Pulse Shape Modulation (PSM), Pulse Interval
Modulation (PIM) have gained interests with the impulse radio based ul-
tra wideband-technology. The choice of modulation is a design parameter,

142
H¨useyin Arslan and Hasari Celebi
as there are various trades oﬀs in choosing the appropriate modulation. One
of the popular trade-oﬀs is power versus spectral eﬃciency. For example low
order modulations (like BPSK) are power eﬃcient compared to higher order
modulations (like 64-QAM) which are spectrally eﬃcient. The recent wireless
standards are moving in the direction of adaptive modulation (having the
capability of using multiple modulations and choosing the most appropriate
modulation depending on the link quality) to optimize both spectrum and
power eﬃciency. We refer to [44] for detailed discussion on diﬀerent digital
modulation techniques.
As discussed earlier, the current practical SDR platforms handle the IF
part of the transceiver blocks in the digital processors. The main objective
of digital upconversion is to generate digital IF signal, which provides more
ﬂexibility compared to analog upconversion. Typical digital upconversion con-
sists of digital ﬁltering, Numerically Controlled Oscillator (NCO), and digital
mixer. The main tasks of digital ﬁltering are pulse shaping and interpolation.
Cascade Integrator Comb (CIC) and programmable FIR ﬁlters are two most
practical ﬁlter types that are used to perform digital ﬁltering. NCO is used to
synthesize arbitrary local oscillator frequency and digital mixer is employed
to upconvert digital baseband samples to digital IF stage. Similarly, the re-
verse operation of digital upconversion, which is digital downconversion, is
performed at receiver side.
4.8 Conclusions
In this chapter, we emphasize on SDR structures to realize cognitive radio
technology. The role of SDR in cognitive radio technology is discussed along
with some examples. SDR requirements of cognitive radio are identiﬁed and
multiple antenna systems in the context of SDR and cognitive radio are dis-
cussed. Current SDR enabling technologies are evaluated. It can be concluded
that SDR is an essential part of cognitive radio and current technologies have
the capability of prooﬁng the concept of cognitive radio technology.

5.1 Introduction
In this chapter, the concept of a telecommunications value-chain is developed,
leading to an exploration of the many ways in which the value-chain can be al-
tered by reconﬁgurable software-deﬁned radios, cognitive radios, and cognitive
networks.
Innovative and emerging wireless communications applications involving
the use of adaptive and cognitive radio technology ideally attempt to maximize
and capture the value to the users while reducing the manufacturing, deploy-
ment, and upgrade costs incurred by the manufacturer and service provider(s).
The telecommunications value-chain creates consumer value through
the provision of communication services over ﬁxed and wireless networks.
Porter [1] explains how value-chain analysis “divides a ﬁrm into the discrete
activities it performs in designing, producing, marketing, and distributing
its product”. Within the telecommunications value-chain, the design and
development of software-deﬁned and cognitive radios has the potential to
signiﬁcantly eﬀect consumer value. The purpose of this chapter is to ﬁrstly
develop the concept of a telecommunications value-chain and secondly, ex-
plore the many ways in which the value-chain can be altered by adaptive and
reconﬁgurable Software-Deﬁned Radios (SDR), Cognitive Radios (CR), and
cognitive networks.

In order to put this chapter into the correct context, Section 5.2 is a brief
recap of the terms cognitive radio and cognitive networks from the authors’
collective viewpoint. Section 5.3 introduces the concept of a value-chain. The
topics of value-creation and value-migration are explained in Section 5.4. Sec-
tion 5.5 develops an economic value model considering the net present value
of a network of nodes with cognitive functionality. Section 5.6 outlines four
examples and case-studies that aim to help the reader strengthen their un-
derstanding of the value-chain concepts presented in this chapter. Section 5.7
concludes. For a deeper understanding of the the concepts presented in this
chapter, the reader is directed to relevant references, which are provided in
the bibliography.
5.2 Cognitive Radio and Networks
For the purposes of this chapter, it is useful to deﬁne what the authors re-
fer to as a cognitive radio and a cognitive network. Cognitive radio can be
described as a node in a network with an ability to form an awareness of its
environment and context, make decisions and inferences from this informa-
tion combined with knowledge of the user’s objectives, act in a manner that
attempts to accomplish the user’s objectives, and optionally learn from these
experiences for possible use in the future [2,3]. The foundation of a cognitive
radio is essentially a wireless communications stack capable of being dynam-
ically reconﬁgured. This may be implemented using a software-deﬁned radio,
which is a wireless device where some or all of the physical layer (PHY) and
the rest of the communications stack is implemented in software, or can be
conﬁgured using a software mechanism. Cognitive functionality may have an
inﬂuence on all or many of the layers in a communications stack and is not
just limited to the PHY only, however.
A cognitive network is a network of nodes with cognitive functionality [4,5].
These nodes may have the potential to form an awareness of each other and
even combine their resources and complementary expertise in order to perform
as a collaboration and even in unison as a team [6].
5.3 The Value-Chain
The term value-chain is used to describe the interconnected stream of or-
ganizations, activities, and capabilities that combine to generate value for
customers through the production of goods and services [7]. It is a reﬁnement
of the supply chain concept, where the focus is on value generating elements
as opposed to procurement and logistics. Porter identiﬁed how the activities
of organizations in the chain, and in particular, interactions between organi-
zations, could be the source of sustainable competitive advantage through the
ongoing creation of customer value and through continuous reduction in the

5 Value Creation and Migration in Adaptive and Cognitive Radio Systems
147
cost of creating that value. Much of the eﬀort of supply chain or value-chain
management is devoted to identifying or predicting sources of customer value,
and in maximizing delivery of that value at minimal cost in the chain.
Value is typically measured in terms of revenue for the organizations within
the chain, and in terms of utility for the customers. Utility is the economic
term for the satisfaction derived by customers in the consumption of goods
and services. In value-chains, any party that gains utility from the chain ac-
tivities (whether by consumption or other means) should be considered a
customer. Organizations contribute to the value of the goods and services
through their activities, and generate proﬁts by minimizing their costs and
maximizing revenue, i.e. maximizing the value provided to the next organi-
zational downstream in the chain. For the customers, the goods and services
are consumed, generating utility for the customers in excess of the cost. In
cellular wireless markets for example, the value of advanced high-speed video
download services may not be evident to the end user until after the handset
is paid for. The cost of the advanced handsets may be subsidised by the ser-
vice provider or even the content provider in order to encourage the uptake of
these services. With push advertising on a cellular phone being used to pay,
in whole or in part, for a service consumed by the handset owner, both the
advertising company and the ultimate end user are customers.
Figure 5.1 is an example of one value-chain that can be associated with
a cognitive radio system. The value generating elements in this chain include
cognitive functionality, dynamic spectrum access, ease of communication, and
abilities to develop and deploy new applications and services with relative
ease compared to a traditional ﬁxed-architecture system model. The cogni-
tive functionality element of this chain oﬀers value by combining awareness,
decision-making and learning capabilities with the ability to rapidly imple-
ment change in both reactive and preemptive modes of operation based on
current and historical knowledge of the user’s habits and anticipated commu-
nications needs. This allows the burden of modiﬁcation and optimization of
the system performance to be moved away from the user to the device itself.

Cognitive functionality also provides a way to work around and ﬁx faults that
may develop in the device. In addition, this functionality can help maximize
the operating lifetime of the device itself by attempting to reach a compro-
mise between the available node resources (e.g. remaining energy, available
spectrum, RF hardware) and communications demands placed on the device
by the user. The value that can be derived from a more dynamic approach to
spectrum access as featured in the second element of Figure 5.1, is that the
probability of successful wireless communication can increase dramatically.
Dynamic spectrum access techniques combined with cognitive functionality
oﬀer a means of exploiting unused or under-utilized whitespace spectrum seg-
ments while attempting to ensure that incumbent and non-cooperative users
experience minimal interference. This ability enables the cognitive node to
take advantage of the geographical and time-of-day variations in spectrum
usage patterns for its own needs. From the user’s perspective, the ability to
communicate becomes a feature that is taken for granted as the underlying
cognitive functionality and dynamic spectrum access technologies can auto-
matically manage the spectrum access requirements. The third element of this
value-chain is therefore the ease of communication that users can experience
regardless of the geographical location, movement patterns, time of day, and
user’s technical knowledge (or lack thereof). The fourth and ﬁnal element in
this simpliﬁed value-chain is the value that can be derived by combining all
of these features to enable both the service providers and users to quickly
develop and deploy innovative revenue-generating services and applications.
These new services can be both pushed onto the market by the service provider
or user, and optimized quickly based on the subscriber’s interest in these ser-
vices in order to maximize the generated revenue.
In addition to the consumers, other non-consuming customers such as a
telecommunications regulator may get value from the chain. The regulator
gains utility from the creation of a telecommunications regime that meets the
deﬁned regulatory standards, which may be considered a measure of societal
value. For example, frequency spectrum regulators may reserve spectrum for
emergency services because of the value of such services to society. Communi-
cations regulators including the Commission for Communications Regulation
(ComReg) in Ireland, also impose terms and conditions on telecommunica-
tion network operators as regards the percentage of the population covered
by basic services such as mobile voice connectivity.
It can be diﬃcult to quantify non-monetary value to society. However,
when discussing value creation or migration, the involvement of multiple cus-
tomers with diﬀerent perceptions of value must also be considered. These
diﬀerent perceptions of value may also be dependent on the priority of that
service according to the user. An example of this challenge is attempting to
quantify the value created in public safety scenarios where through the pro-
vision of telecommunications services, the potential to more eﬃciently locate
and co-ordinate the rescue of survivors in a disaster area can be increased.
In this scenario, the potential of telecommunications is of higher societal value

5 Value Creation and Migration in Adaptive and Cognitive Radio Systems
149
than the ability to establish a high quality video link. It can be diﬃcult to
quantify such societal values in economic terms, which poses a challenge for
value-chain models.
The value-chain perspective can be summarized as follows:
• There are multiple customers in the chain for whom value can be created.
• Value is ultimately deﬁned by the utility gained by consumers and other
customers. Value is created when the utility of the ultimate customer(s)
is increased.
• Within the chain, proﬁts may be increased either by reducing cost or
by increasing revenue gained from another organizational, even though
ultimate customer value is not improved. In this way, value can migrate
along the value-chain.
5.4 Value Creation and Migration
Value is not a static entity. The total value in a chain is the sum of the
utility of the various customers, each having a unique perspective which may
be constantly evolving. The challenge for organizations in the chain is to
identify opportunities for value creation, and to ensure that they capture that
value through increased proﬁts. However, this newly created value is not easily
captured – Sylwotzky [8] and Ng et al. [9] show how the dynamics of value
migration within the value-chain are complex and diﬃcult to manage. Fine [10]
identiﬁes the concept of clockspeed – the rate of change within an industry
as a key driver of the dynamics of value creation and migration. Clockspeed
can be measured in terms of product life cycle but it is not necessarily a ﬁxed
parameter within any value-chain. For network operators, product life is of
the order of years while at the downstream end of the chain for the wireless
communications application developer it might be weeks. Hence value will
potentially migrate more quickly between value-chain members downstream.
The strength of a cognitive radio system is the ﬂexibility and adaptability
that it oﬀers. This ﬂexibility can be exploited to provide attractive features for
both a service provider and user. One of these appealing features of a cognitive
radio-based system, therefore, is that it has the potential for value creation
and migration. A cognitive system that can adapt to the local environment,
scenarios, and business models has a high value to both the service provider
and user. Furthermore, this value can actually migrate either intentionally or
unintentionally.
Any activities which generate increased value to any of the ultimate cus-
tomers of the system are seen as value creating activities. This may be activ-
ities internal to a ﬁrm, or between existing ﬁrms. It may be the introduction
of new technologies, or the deployment of existing technology in an innova-
tive manner. Value creation, while desirable, is not always deliberate. In the
European market predominately, the vastly popular mobile phone Short Mes-
sage Service (SMS) in Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is

150
Keith E. Nolan et al.
one example of this. This facility was provided as a minor addition by phone
manufacturers which has become highly valued by customers – a mechanism
known as market pull innovation.
On the other hand, innovation can occur through technology push, where
new technologies are oﬀered to the market in order to stimulate demand for
the associated value proposition. As an example, the availability of multime-
dia messaging is not generating the hoped-for fast sales growth as customers
do not as of yet, assign signiﬁcant value to the feature. It is the customer
perception of value that is key, and no value creation takes place until the
customer adopts the technology. From a service provider or innovative user
viewpoint, the value of a cognitive radio and network is that new and innova-
tive services can be oﬀered to the public relatively quickly and on a trial basis
in order to probe the market’s interest in that feature. In order to initiate
and sustain this activity, ﬂexibility, an open development platform, and rapid
low-cost prototyping, are necessary. The value-chain illustrated in Figure 5.1
and introduced in Section 5.3, points out that potential value from both tech-
nology push and market pull mechanisms can be leveraged in a cognitive radio
system as it is designed to both handle, and facilitate change.
Moving towards a more forward-looking cognitive radio network scenario,
the ability to collaborate and combine resources with other cognitive radio
devices may not be of high value to a user wishing to only transmit a ﬁle to
a colleague. However, the ability to exploit the potential collaboration and
resource-combination features of a cognitive network in order to establish an
emergency communications network in the event of a natural disaster may be
of very high value to those directly aﬀected by this disaster.
Value migration is therefore critical to ﬁrms in the value system, who wish
to capture maximum value at minimum cost. The migration of value can be
controlled, but not fully – it is often beyond the power of a single ﬁrm to in-
ﬂuence. Firms must therefore understand value in the context of the complete
supply chain. Two questions are key to a ﬁrm’s strategic analysis of value:
“When value is created who captures this and how can this be achieved?”
and “when value changes (a change of target market and customer proﬁle, for
example) how to hold onto value?”.
5.5 Economic Value Model
The associated microeconomics can be represented in terms of a value-chain,
i.e. the sequence of suppliers and customers that are required to deliver a
product or service to the end user of (in this case) communications. The value-
chain can stretch from the component supplier, to the system integrator, to
the service provider, and on to the end user.
Figure 5.2 is a graphical representation of a three-stage supply chain. In the
context of this chapter, A could be network operators and B, Mobile Vir-
tual Network Operators (MVNO). The end users are denoted by C. Equally,

A could be the primary spectrum users and licensees, and B wireless access
operators exploiting spectrum opportunities. In this scenario, the end users, C
could also act in an opportunistic manner, favoring one operator or unlicensed
and free spectrum access scheme over another depending on its information
conveyance needs and context. Many combinations are possible, but a viable
value-chain requires that all players in the chain are achieving a surplus in
their respective transactions.
Figure 5.2 is only a representation of the inter-relationships involved. A
complete representation of the value-chain would include service/product ca-
pacities, market structure, measures of customer value, and market player
strategies.
Regarding the latter, companies may build up business models to predict
their performance. In this section, we do so for a network operator, while
noting in its most general sense, a “network operator” could be as simple
as a homeowner with a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) access point
allowing access to users in the vicinity.
One typical measure of the potential success of a future project is that of
net present value, i.e. the proﬁtability of a project in today’s unit of currency.
Assuming a discount rate of d for future expenses and revenues and a project
life of NT years, then the Net Present Value (NPV) is given by Equation 5.1,
where NU is the number of subscribed users and rU(n) is the Average Revenue
Per User (ARPU) in year n. The total CAPital EXpenditure (CAPEX) for
network infrastructure is cI, and cS is the price paid for the spectrum used.
The average handset subsidy per user is denoted by cU and the OPerational
EXpenditure (OPEX) for the network in year n is denoted by oI(n).
The NPV can therefore be described as
NPV = NU
NT

n=1
rU(n)
(1 + d)n −cI −cS −NUcU −
NT

n=1
oI(n)
(1 + d)n
(5.1)

152
Keith E. Nolan et al.
While all of the above parameters depend on the interaction in the market-
place with other network operators, suppliers and customers, the parameters
NU and rU(n) are explicitly related by the price demand curve. This is in
turn, heavily dependent on the market conditions.
Other metrics exist for measuring the value of a project. One commonly
used is that of Return On Investment (ROI). The ROI is the compounded
annual percentage interest rate that would have yielded the same proﬁt on
the invested capital.
In order to help the reader to gain a better understanding of how the
costs, number of subscribers and revenue are interrelated, consider the fol-
lowing simpliﬁcations and (ﬁctitious) sample values. Assume that the number
of subscribers, rU(n) and OPEX for year n, oI(n) are constant over time.
Furthermore, assume that this OPEX, oI(n) = oI can be broken down into
network OPEX (usually expressed on a per annum basis as some fraction k
of overall CAPEX), and per-subscriber OPEX, oU (billing costs, customer
support costs, etc.). Figure 5.1 can be simpliﬁed as follows; let
ˆNT =
NT

n=1
1
(1 + d)n
(5.2)
Hence the NPV, as originally stated in Equation 5.1, can now be de-
scribed as
NPV = NU ˆNT

rU −oU −cU
ˆNT

−

cI

1 + ˆNT k

+ cS

(5.3)
Consider a scenario where there is $200 million of CAPEX; $100 million of
spectrum license fees; network OPEX of 5 % CAPEX per annum; subscriber
OPEX of $20 per annum per user; average $50 of handset subsidy per user;
one million users; an ARPU of $150 per annum; a discount rate of 5.5 %; and
a project life of six years ( ˆNT ≈5).
This would yield a healthy NPV of approximately $250 million.
The above model captures the value seen by one type of player in the
chain only, namely an operator. It allows one to make qualitative statements
as regards the value-chain impact of cognitive radio for an operator. These
are explored in further detail in the next section.
Models can be created for other players, e.g. users, content providers, etc.,
although some parameters can be diﬃcult to quantify, e.g. value to end users.
For yet other players such as national telecommunications regulators, it is dif-
ﬁcult to create the model itself, given the complex mix of societal and market
impacts involved. In order to put these challenges into relevant contexts, some
scenarios involving diﬀerent players’ interpretations of value are presented in
the following section.

153
5.6 Example Scenarios
This section describes some scenarios that aim to help the reader to gain a
better understanding of the concepts described in this chapter. These scena-
rios involve a communications network where technological change can create
opportunities for new business models. Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 describe how
users can gain more value through increased communication coverage and ease
of use, which has potential for increased ARPU for the operator. Users may
have the potential to gain ﬁnancial credit from the operator by contributing
the capabilities and features of their cognitive radio devices to the network
infrastructure, as described in Section 5.6.3. Thus, value is increased and this
migrates as the beneﬁts are shared between user and operator. Value is not
limited to the user and operator spaces but can have implications for external
third parties also. As an example of this, a scenario examining value from a
spectrum regulator viewpoint is outlined in Section 5.6.4.
5.6.1 Simpliﬁed Man−Machine Interface
The concept of a very simple user interface was introduced in Section 5.3.
To the average non-technically minded customer, the potentially greater free-
dom of communication regardless of location and trajectory, using a system
that is more in tune with their daily behavior patterns is what they may
perceive as a high value feature. The power of cognitive radio also lies in
the ability to provide a very simple interface to what can be a very complex
system, where ideally the user requires no technical knowledge in order to
operate the device. This is referred to in this chapter as one-touch opera-
tion. This customer may not place a high value on the cognitive functionality
itself (or even care), but if this functionality results in universal one-touch
or entirely hands-free operation through a simpliﬁed context-related MMI
(man–machine interface), requiring little conscious eﬀort on their part, then
a potentially valuable product may be realized.
The potential beneﬁts of cognitive radio technology to the daily lives of
consumers are enormous. An ability to anticipate the wireless communica-
tions needs of the users and take preemptive action by seeking out the either
the most robust or economical means of information conveyance is attractive.
In addition, the ability to establish and maintain a communications link re-
gardless of location, trajectory and wireless environment is also a desirable
feature. Developing a cognitive radio device capable of one-touch or even to-
tally hands-free and fault-tolerant operation may require increases in CAPEX
and handset subsidies to help promote adoption of this system. However, the
potential of this device is that it may actually help increase the ARPU as
communication becomes an ability taken for granted and is used more as a
result. The simple interface and increased ease of use could encourage more
new subscribers to adopt the use of this technology.

154
Keith E. Nolan et al.
We consider the economic value model described in Section 5.5 with the
following sample (and ﬁctitious) adjustments to the original set of ﬁgures
for a future project involving the use of cognitive radio. In this scenario,
we make conservative assumptions that the development of a fault-tolerant
cognitive radio with a simpliﬁed man–machine interface requires increasing the
original CAPEX (CAPEX = $300 million) and the handset subsidies required
to promote initial uptake may also have to be increased to $100 per device.
However, attracted by the increased ease of use and reliability, this technology
may increase the customer base from 1 million to 1.2 million subscribers.
In addition, the ‘taken for granted’ nature of the ability to communicate,
combined with the increased ease of use, may be expected to result in an
increase in ARPU from $150 to $175. The network OPEX is retained at their
original values, although the subscriber OPEX is reduced to $15 per user as
the fault-tolerance and simple MMI reduces the customer support costs. The
NPV in this case is $365 million, an increase of $115 million. Although these
are example ﬁgures, a key observation is that even considering the eﬀects
of a signiﬁcantly increased CAPEX and handset subsidies, the NPV is still
signiﬁcantly greater than zero, indicating that this may be a viable project.
5.6.2 Dynamic Spectrum Access
Cognitive radio is popularly associated with enabling more eﬃcient use of fre-
quency spectrum. Certainly, cognitive functionality in the form of awareness,
reasoning, learning, and frequency agility abilities are necessary to detect and
exploit spectrum opportunities. The ability to relinquish this spectrum when
the information transfer is completed or when a user with a higher priority
appears in the same spectrum segment is also a necessary feature. More ef-
ﬁcient use of spectrum also means being able to accommodate more wireless
devices operating in the same spectrum segments without causing interference
to each other. This interference-free coexistence ability can therefore increase
the potential number of subscribers, NU, in a network of cognitive nodes.
Figure 5.3 illustrates this concept where a network of cognitive radio de-
vices (B) operating on a secondary opportunistic basis, co-exist with the legacy
primary user network (A). The legacy users may or may not have cognitive
functionality and are referred to as non-cooperative users. This scenario can be
realized if the secondary users can avail of the white space spectrum (unused
spectrum in the primary user spectrum allocation) [11] or transmit packets
when the primary user nodes are estimated to be inactive. It is also feasi-
ble that an increased number of nodes with cognitive functionality could be
supported in the same spectrum segment, and be part of the same network
compared to a network of nodes without cognitive functionality [12]. In this
ﬁgure, the secondary users exploit the unused spectrum segments, shown in
green, on either side of the primary user spectrum illustrated in orange.
Dynamic spectrum access is of value to the average customer if this abil-
ity can enable the desirable always-connected feature of a cognitive radio.

Fig. 5.3. Illustration of how the number of potential users can be increased in a
spectrum segment if secondary opportunistic usage, operating on a non, or minimal
interference basis, can be supported using cognitive radio technology. The primary
(or non-cooperative users) and secondary opportunistic users, and their spectrum
occupancies, are illustrated in orange and green, respectively.
The ability to utilize only as much spectrum as is deemed necessary in order
to facilitate the required information transfer, or seek out spectrum with a
lower cost of usage may result in extra added value to this customer in the
form of lower costs in a pay to use spectrum market regime.
The ability to avail of unlicensed spectrum for short range, lower priority
or interference-tolerant communication services helps to reduce the demand
for licensed spectrum segments. This is an obvious beneﬁt for the operator.
By reducing the spectrum-usage costs while retaining the same (or greater)
ARPU, a positive change in the NPV can be observed.
Considering the previous example in the context of a future cognitive ra-
dio project employing dynamic spectrum access technology, three potential
scenarios exist:
• The operator may either choose to halve their current licensed spectrum
allocation, thus reducing the cost of spectrum licenses, cS.
• The operator may choose to retain their current licensed spectrum al-
location but avail of unlicensed spectrum also, thus increasing the total
potential available spectrum. In this case, cS remains static.
• The operator may choose to retain exclusive usage of part of the licensed
spectrum allocations, and lease the remainder to other operators for op-
portunistic usage in return for a ﬂat or per-usage fee. The result of this is
that the cost of spectrum licensing is reduced.
The consequences of these three approaches are that either the cost of
spectrum, cS, decreases and/or the ability to accommodate more users, NU,
increases. If the initial CAPEX estimate accounts for cognitive radio devices
capable of both licensed and unlicensed spectrum usage, then it is feasible

156
Keith E. Nolan et al.
that the modiﬁcation of the operator’s existing business model to lower costs
and increase revenue in this manner requires a relatively inexpensive software
upgrade, or a change in spectrum-usage policy, governing the behavior of the
cognitive radio subscriber device.
Using the example (and ﬁctitious) values in the previous scenario, con-
sider the scenario where the required CAPEX, cI is $300 million, subscriber
OPEX, oU is $15 per user per annum, and the expected ARPU, RU(n) is $175
(assuming that the lower cost of spectrum usage is not passed directly to the
user). In addition, the number of subscribers, NU, is 1.2 million, the cost of
spectrum licensing, cS is reduced by $25 million to $75 million, and the hand-
set subsidy and discount rate remain unchanged (i.e. cU = $100, k = 5.5 %,
and ˆNT ≈5 ). In this example, by reducing the cost of spectrum-usage by $25
million, the NPV is $390 million. This represents an increase of $140 million
over the original non-cognitive radio oriented scenario.
5.6.3 Message-Relaying and Micropayments
Customers place value on the ability to communicate. In the case of a cellular
network, this ability can be lost if a customer’s device is out of range of a
base station. A network operator wishes to maximize revenue by accommo-
dating users out of range of base-station range without having to signiﬁcantly
upgrade the current network architecture (and as a result, increase cI and oI).
In addition, it may not always be possible to erect or move base stations to
where they are deemed necessary, and human behavior patterns and concen-
tration of users in a given geographical area may also change over time (e.g.
due to new housing scheme, new roads, and rail links). In order to capture
the potential revenue from these subscribers using the existing infrastructure,
one option is to enhance the subscriber device abilities. In addition to the
operator’s main goal of increasing the revenue generated by the customers
increasing demand wireless connectivity in a region, they may desire to
preparing themselves for the future roll out of new wireless communications-
based services. In order to do this, the operator must try and accommodate
more subscribers, maximize the use of the existing network infrastructure,
and ideally avoid further capital expenditure on network expansion.
One of the attractive features of cognitive radio technology also lies in
the ability to deploy new services/communications abilities without incurring
a signiﬁcant increase in the CAPEX and OPEX. These new services may
involve changing the way the existing network infrastructure is used to convey
information. In this scenario, message-relaying is used to increase the eﬀective
coverage of base stations and also increase the number of subscribers that can
communicate using this base station.
Cognitive radio devices can act as message relays in parallel to the reg-
ular audio/video/data communication services. Customers out of range of a
base station but within range of another customer’s cognitive radio device can
therefore route their messages and voice calls through one or more available

nodes until the messages reach a base station and can continue through the
rest of the network. By enhancing the cognitive functionality of each node,
greater numbers of potential subscribers, NU, may be supported per year with-
out having to signiﬁcantly upgrade the network infrastructure. This may help
to keep cI at a static or slowly rising level thus increasing the potential revenue.
This message-relay in a cellular network context is illustrated in Figure 5.4.
Message traﬃc from Node A is relayed by Node B, Node C and Node D
to Node E. Node E is within the base station coverage area and can complete
the wireless communications link.
This method used to expand the capabilities of each consumer device can
take the form of an over-the-air upgrades allowing each device to reconﬁgure
as a message relay when required. Each device may choose to act exclusively as
a message relay when not in active use by the customer, possibly encouraged
by the prospect of payment for this service.
From a consumer standpoint, extra value may be extracted from the use
of cognitive functionality in radio systems by being able to collect payment
in return for relaying messages from other users. This small share of the
total payment is referred to as a micropayment [13]. This incentive could help
the ‘always-connected’ value of a cognitive network by encouraging devices
to act as relay nodes in an ad hoc network (becoming part of the network
infrastructure) thus helping to increase the possibility of communication.
However, the increase in network usage (e.g. through increased number of
users NU) will be oﬀset by the degree to which micropayments reduce the
ARPU, rU.
5.6.4 Spectrum Regulator Value
Interference-free co-existence and more dynamic use of spectrum using cogni-
tive functionality may be perceived as having value to an operator. As stated
earlier, from a customer point of view, value is gained from these abilities if

158

they enable the desired ‘always-on, always-connected’ experience, simpliﬁed
MMI, etc. While it is useful for considering direct user and operator economic
value, the NPV representation in this chapter does not account for this ex-
ternal third party value. An example of a relevant third party is a spectrum
regulator, who may stand to gain from these features also but is not an opera-
tor or wireless user. From a value viewpoint, cognitive functionality could help
shift some of the burden of regulation into the cognitive device and network
space, as illustrated in the cognitive radio value-chain shown in Figure 5.1.
Cognitive radio devices capable of operation in a non-interference manner and
automatically adherence to the relevant regulatory policies helps to advance
the concept of a self-regulation spectrum environment. While it is diﬃcult to
quantify the potential created value from a spectrum regulator viewpoint, it
is feasible that self-regulation may reduce the need for active spectrum com-
pliance testing. As a consequence, therefore, more time may potentially be
allocated for carrying out other regulator activities. It is also possible that
self-regulation can help support the argument for liberalization of the current
spectrum licensing arrangements.
5.7 Conclusions
This chapter introduced the concept of a telecommunications value-chain
and explored some of the many ways in which the value-chain can be altered by
adaptive and reconﬁgurable software-deﬁned radios, cognitive radios and cog-
nitive networks. A description of how value can migrate and be created was
also presented.
In order to help further illustrate the concepts described in this chapter,
scenarios involving cognitive radio technology operating in a customer-centric
network were discussed in terms of the impact on that model. The largest
changes will be seen where signiﬁcant improvements result in the services
oﬀered (e.g. improved coverage or simpliﬁed interfaces), since the ARPU or
the number of customers may increase. Lesser value-chain impact will arise
where there are changes in the internal operations of the network only, i.e.
where impacts are conﬁned to increasing handset subsidies or delayed CAPEX
spend.
The business model allows one to predict the behavior of one operator.
It does not directly describe the impact of competition from other operators.
Thus, there are other signiﬁcant impacts due to the introduction of cognitive
radio that arise when the market structure itself changes. For example, if
cognitive radio enables cheaper access to spectrum then new players may
enter the operator market, increasing competition.
Ultimately, cognitive radio technology has signiﬁcant potential to change
how internal business models of the players interact with the market
structures. The models and scenarios discussed here represent a ﬁrst step
in the analysis of the resulting value creation and migration.

6.1 Introduction
Cognitive radio is an emerging wireless communications paradigm in which
either the network or the wireless node itself intelligently adapts particular
transmission or reception parameters by sensing the environment. The goals of
adaptation include maximizing spectral eﬃciency, minimizing interference to
other cognitive radios, coexistence of licensed and unlicensed band communi-
cations, battery energy eﬃciency, etc. The environmental parameters that are
continually sensed for adaptation include occupied radio frequency bands, user
traﬃc, network state, etc. One promising technology that enables the imple-
mentation of a cognitive radio network is software-deﬁned radio. The underly-
ing theoretical principles for cognition are broadly based on signal-processing
and machine-learning. The cognitive cycle [1] consists of three major compo-
nents: (a) sensing of Radio Frequency (RF), (b) cognition/management, and
(c) control action. In particular,
1. RF sensing:
• estimation of the total interference in the radio environment;
• detection of spectrum holes (or unused bands);
• estimation of channel state information (e.g., Signal to Noise Ratio
(SNR));
• prediction of channel capacity for use by the transmitter.
2. Cognition/management:
• spectrum management which controls the opportunistic spectrum ac-
cess;
• traﬃc shaping;
• routing;
• Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning.

Task (1) deals with spectrum sensing and prediction, hence, places emphasis
on physical layer issues. In this chapter we will focus on tasks (2) and (3).
We discuss these tasks for dynamic spectrum access from game and coding
theoretic perspectives. Stochastic learning based solution to some of the issues
in these tasks are also presented. The three tasks in a cognitive cycle are shown
in Figure 6.1
Dynamic spectrum access using cognitive radios is an emerging research
topic. This research motivated by the fact that enhancing spectrum eﬃciency
is an important task of regulatory authorities worldwide. Radio spectrum is
considered a scarce resource with the growing demand for spectrum-based
services because a major portion of the spectrum has been allocated for li-
censed wireless applications. Therefore, new applications are competing for
the very little spectrum that is left unlicensed. On the other hand, actual
measurements taken on the 0–6 GHz band (Figure 6.2) in downtown Berkeley
show that the actual utilization of the spectrum is quite low. This reiterates
the argument that FCC’s spectrum regulations diminish spectrum from being
utilized eﬃciently. Other empirical studies (e.g., [8]) also seem to support the
observation that spectrum is used ineﬃciently both in space and time.
Low utilization and increased demand for the radio resource suggest the
notion of secondary use. This allows dynamic access to unused parts of spec-
trum owned by the primary license holder to become available temporarily
for Secondary (non-primary) Users (SU). This dynamic access of spectrum

by secondary users is one of the promising ideas that can mitigate spectrum
scarcity, potentially without major changes to incumbents.
The ﬁrst step in dynamic spectrum access is the detection of unused spec-
tral bands. Therefore, a cognitive radio device measures the RF energy in
a channel or monitors the received signal strength indicator to determine
whether the channel is idle or not. But this approach has a problem in that
wireless devices can only sense the presence of a Primary User (PU) if and only
if the energy detected is above a certain threshold. It is true that one cannot
arbitrarily lower the threshold as this would result in non-detection because of
the presence of noise. In the feature detection approach, which has been used
in the military to detect the presence of weak signals [9], the wireless device
uses cyclostationary signal processing to detect the presence of primaries.
If a signal exhibits strong cyclostationary properties, it can be detected at
very low Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) [11]. Then, the question is how to
share the available spectrum eﬃciently and fairly.
The FCC spectrum Policy Task Force [12] has recommended a paradigm
shift in interference assessment from the largely ﬁxed operations. This facili-
tates real-time interactions between a transmitter and a receiver in an adaptive
manner. The recommendation is based on a new metric called the interfer-
ence temperature, which is intended to quantify and manage the sources of
interference in a radio environment. The interference temperature is deﬁned
to be the RF power measured at a receiving antenna per unit bandwidth.
The key idea for this new metric is that, ﬁrstly, the interference tempera-
ture at a receiving antenna provides an accurate measure for the acceptable
level of RF interference in the frequency band of interest; any transmission
in that band is considered to be “harmful” if it would increase the noise
ﬂoor above the interference temperature threshold as shown in Figure 6.3.
Secondly, given a particular frequency band in which the interference temper-
ature is not exceeded, that band could be made available to secondary users.
Hence, a secondary device might attempt to coexist with the primary, such
that the presence of secondary devices goes unnoticed.

Game theory plays an important role in the modelling and optimization
of wireless communications among users with competing performance goals
and resource constraints. For example, secondary users compete to access the
available spectrum. Typically, these users do not cooperate with each other
and selﬁshly try to maximize their own utility (e.g., throughput). This can
be viewed as a non-cooperative game. Is there an equilibrium transmission
strategy set for this game? If such a strategy set exists, how can it be com-
puted by the user in a distributed fashion using only local information? These
are all important questions that we address later in this chapter. We provide
some game theoretic models for dynamic spectrum access and study the exis-
tence of equilibrium solution. Stochastic learning based techniques to discover
the equilibrium solution is also discussed.
In the secondary usage scenario PUs are the license holders and secondary
users SUs are allowed to use the band when PUs are inactive, but they are
required to vacate the band as soon as PUs become active. The arrival of the
PU causes the SU to loose that band and therefore link maintenance becomes
a key issue. A solution to this problem has been proposed in [21] where the
whole bandwidth is divided into a large number of subchannels as shown in
Figure 6.4. A SU selects a set of subchannels in such a way that they lie in dif-
ferent primary users’ bands. This minimizes the loss of subchannels upon the
arrival of a particular PU as no PU can cause the complete breakdown of

6 Codes and Games for Dynamic Spectrum Access
165
the SU link. But the arrival of a PU acts like an erasure for a SU link and
it causes the SU to loose all the packets that are being transmitted over the
subchannel which was under that particular PU’s band. In counteracting the
eﬀect of PU’s interference over the SU’s link, a class of erasure correction
codes called LT codes or Digital Fountain Codes [22, 23] play an important
role in the link maintenance mechanism. We consider the use of these codes
for secondary spectrum access and provide some analysis and simulations.
The chapter is organized as follows. Preliminaries of stochastic automata
games are discussed in Section 6.2. Coexistence issues in dissimilar secondary
radio systems is presented in Section 6.3. Section 6.4 deals with dynamic
spectrum access with QoS and interference temperature constraints. Digital
fountain codes for link maintenance is presented in Section 6.5.
6.2 Stochastic Learning Automata and Games
Abstractly, a learning automaton [2] can be considered to be an object that
can choose from a ﬁnite number of actions. For every action that it chooses,
the random environment in which it operates evaluates that action. A corres-
ponding feedback is sent to the automaton based on which the next action
is chosen. As this process progresses the automaton learns to choose the
optimal action for that unknown environment asymptotically. The stochas-
tic iterative algorithm used by the automaton to select its successive actions
based on the environment’s response deﬁnes the stochastic learning algorithm.
An important property of the learning automaton is its ability to improve its
performance with time while operation in an unknown environment. In this
chapter, for the sake of consistency our notations follow or parallels that from
standard books on game theory (e.g., [3]) and stochastic learning [4].
In multiple automata games, instead of one automaton (player) playing
against the environment, N automata, say A1, A2, ..., AN take part in a game.
Consider a typical automaton Ai described by a 4-tuple {Si, ri, Ti, pi}. Each
player i has a ﬁnite set of actions or pure strategies, Si, 1 ≤i ≤N. Let the
cardinality of Si be mi, 1 ≤i ≤N. The result of each play is a random payoﬀ
to each player. Let ri denote the random payoﬀto player i, 1 ≤i ≤N. It is
assumed here that ri ∈[0, 1]. Deﬁne functions di : ΠN
j=1Sj →[0, 1], 1 ≤i ≤
N, by
di(a1, ..., aN) = E[ri|player j chose action aj,
aj ∈Sj, 1 ≤j ≤N].
(6.1)
The function di is called the expected payoﬀfunction or utility function of
player i, 1 ≤i ≤N. The objective of each player is to maximize its expected
payoﬀ. Players choose their strategies based on a time-varying probability
distribution. Let pi(k) = [pi1(k)...pimi(k)]t denote the action choice probabil-
ity distribution of the ith automaton at time instance k. Then pil(k) denotes

the probability with which ith automaton player chooses the lth pure strat-
egy at instant k. Thus pi(k) is the strategy probability vector employed by
the ith player at instant k. Ti denotes the stochastic learning algorithm ac-
cording to which the elements of the set pi are updated at each time k, i.e.,
pi(k + 1) = Ti(pi(k), ai(k), ri(k)), where ai and ri are the actual actions
selected by i and the payoﬀreceived by i at k, k = 0, 1, 2, ..., respectively. The
working of a learning automaton say Ai can be described as follows. Initially
at k = 1 one of the actions is chosen by the player at random with an arbi-
trarily chosen initial probability. This action is then applied to the system and
the response from the environment is observed. Based on the response ri, the
probabilities of actions pi for the next period of time are updated according
to the updating rule Ti. This process is repeated by all the N players until a
stopping criterion is reached or the probability vector converges. Figure 6.5
depicts the basic automata game set-up.
We will frequently consider the situation of varying the strategy of a single
player i while holding the strategies of his opponents ﬁxed. Here, we let s−i ∈
S−i denote a strategy selection for all players but i, and write (s′
i, s−i) for the
proﬁle (s1, . . . , si−1, s′
i, si+1, . . . , sN).
A strategy for player i is deﬁned to be a probability vector pi
=
[pi1, ..., pimi]t, where player i chooses action j with probability pij. Then
we can deﬁne the expected payoﬀfor player i as gi given by

non-degenerate mixed Nash equilibrium if the strategy assigns positive prob-
abilities on more than one pure strategy. In general, each po
i above may be a
mixed strategy and we refer to (po
1, ..., po
N) satisfying (6.3) as a Nash equilib-
rium in mixed strategies. With this deﬁnition, when there is no pure equilib-
rium as may be the case in the stochastic automata game, the users can search
for a mixed Nash equilibrium. It is well known that every ﬁnite strategic-form
game has a mixed strategy equilibrium [3].
A strategy dominates another when, independent of the action taken by
the other players, the ﬁrst strategy leads to an outcome at least as favorable
as the second. Consequently, a case can be made for never playing a strategy
that is dominated. Although this is indeed true in a two-person zero-sum
games and in identical payoﬀgames, in general non-zero-sum games the use
of a dominated strategy can lead to a better payoﬀfor all players (e.g., the
Prisoner’s Dilemma).
In an N-person game, an outcome is said to be Pareto-optimal if there is no
other outcome in which all players simultaneously do better. This is a modest
requirement of any concept of group rationality. Unfortunately, it is not always
consistent with concepts of individual rationality, such as dominance.
6.3 Coexistence of Dissimilar Secondary Radio Systems
Coexistence of dissimilar secondary radio systems in a spectral band raise
two important issues: fairness and eﬃciency. To address these, we propose an
access technique inspired by a human society model—Homo Egualis. Homo
Egualis society consists of a group of agents who care not only about its
own payoﬀ, but also about how it compares with the payoﬀof others. In the
human society, homo sapiens evolved in small hunter-gather groups. Such
societies have no centralized structure of governance (state, judicial system,
church). So the enforcement of norms depends on the voluntary participation
of peers. A Homo Egualis society [5] can be modelled as follows, where the
utility function of player i, ui in an n-player game is
ui = xi −
αi
n −1

xj>xi
(xj −xi) −
βi
n −1

xj<xi
(xi −xj),
(6.4)
where x = (xi, . . . , xj) are the pay-oﬀs for each player and 0 ≤βi < αi ≤1.
βi < αi reﬂects the fact that Homo Egualis exhibits a weak urge to increase
inequality when doing better than the others and a strong urge to reduce
inequality when doing worse than the others. In [5] it is shown that in this
model the salient behaviors in ultimatum and public goods games, where
fairness does matter, can be reproduced. We proposed a distributed dynamic
spectrum access scheme for dissimilar cognitive radio networks in [7] based on
the Homo Egualis society model.

used only with an established spectrum etiquette. We use the same abstract
model of an unlicensed frequency band as in [38], as illustrated in Figure 6.6.
Here, three diﬀerent types of radio systems are assumed to operate in the band,
each operating with diﬀerent frequencies and channel bandwidths. The radio
systems of type A operate on three frequency channels (center frequencies
f2, f5, f8), the radio systems of type B operate on nine frequency channels
(center frequencies f1 · · · f9), and radio system of type C operates on one
frequency channel (center frequency f5). The frequency channels overlap with
each other, as indicated in the ﬁgure. The number and bandwidth of the
frequency channels in Figure 6.6 do not represent any existing unlicensed
band, this usage model serves without loss of generality only as an example
model. Here radio system A can be compared to wireless LANs operating
in the 5 GHz band (using OFDM). Radio system B represents narrow-band
radio systems supporting for example a limited number of voice calls or blue
tooth systems, while radio system C can be a broadband CDMA system. In our
scenario instead of modelling the detailed protocols, a simpliﬁed Listen Before
Talk (LBT) is used for all radio systems. A type A radio system requires the
respective three frequency channels to be idle before allocating radio resources.
Collisions of allocation attempts occur when more than one radio system
detects the channel as idle at the same time. In simulations, when collisions
happen, one of the radio systems is randomly selected to allocate the radio
resource.
Two of the most representative etiquette rules [38] are as follows:
• rule ♯4: a radio system of type A, type B, or type C should apply LBT
when operating;
• rule ♯6: in order to protect other radio systems most eﬃciently, a radio sys-
tem that follows rule ♯4 should synchronize its LBT process in time across
neighboring frequency channels that overlap with the same channels.

One of the most important metrics in the unlicensed band access is the
average airtime per radio system. Airtime refers to the ratio of allocation time
per radio system type to the reference time (say one hour) [38]:
airtimetype=A,B =

(6.5)
where Ntype is the number of type i radio systems.
Eﬃciency and fairness are obviously the main goals of a spectrum eti-
quette. If every radio system accesses the unlicensed band in a greedy manner,
then the radio system requiring broader band to operate will suﬀer from an
unacceptable low airtime share. So one way to provision fairness to the eti-
quette rules would be to require each radio system to work in a cooperative
manner. One option would be that each radio system i tries to contend for
the spectrum with probability pi. After the radio system has decided to con-
tend for the spectrum it accesses the spectrum compliant to etiquette rule
♯4 described before. If perfect fairness is achieved and each radio system is
maximizing its airtime share, then it can be shown that [7] there exists an
access probability vector (paopt, pbopt, pcopt) that corresponds to the strategy
that no radio system can do better in terms of airtime share without harm-
ing the other coexisting radio systems. So in this sense, both the eﬃciency
and fairness are obtained by using this optimal probability pair. Obviously,
without considering any fairness issues, the most eﬃcient access in the sense
of pure spectrum utilization would be that all the users compete for the spec-
trum greedily. But, using this scheme some type of networks may be totally
blocked out of the spectrum access. And further, if diﬀerent types of radio
systems have diﬀerent traﬃc load a simple equalization of the airtime may
cause low spectrum utilization. Also, exact fairness does not always apply as
far as an operator is concerned, they are likely to be more concerned with
revenue. So users who pay more will get more access, which means diﬀerent
networks may have diﬀerent priorities. To properly address these problems,
we need to deﬁne the fairness and eﬃciency carefully.
Deﬁnition 2 Weighted fairness is achieved if the following equation holds,
airtimetypei
Li
=
airtimetypej
Lj
= K
∀i, j.
(6.6)
where K is a constant, and the weight Li = θiλi, θi is the priority parameter
and λi is the traﬃc load for type i radio system.
Deﬁnition 3 Given the weighted fairness of diﬀerent types of radio system
is satisﬁed, eﬃciency is achieved if each of the radio system’s airtime is
maximized.
Note that this deﬁnition of eﬃciency actually corresponds to the Pareto eﬃ-
ciency solution in game theory. A strategy proﬁle is Pareto optimal if some
players must be hurt in order to improve the payoﬀof other players [6].

Yiping Xing et al.
To obtain (paopt, pbopt, pcopt) we need the information of all the arrival rates
λ’s and service rates µ’s of the the radio systems which is impractical in a real
access scenario. A more realistic scheme would be to allow the radio systems
to learn the values pa, pb, and pc themselves with only local information or
measurement. We present such a Homo Egualis (HE) based technique next.
The inequality aversion property of the Homo Egualis agents can be utilized
to achieve fairness in the spectrum access problem. In this scheme each radio
system learns the access probability pi by itself. Here, we deﬁne Onlinetimei
as the averaged cumulative “on” spectrum time per radio system of type i.
Then we deﬁne xi = Onlinetimei
Li
, where Li = θiλi is the same as used before in
(6.6). The cumulative Onlinetimei is normalized by the radio system’s traﬃc
load and priority, which makes this spectrum access scheme able to adapt to
diﬀerent traﬃc loads and priority, hence achieve more eﬃciency and maintain
our deﬁned weighted fairness. With initial pi = 1, each time the probability
pi is updated as follows:

(6.7)
where n is the number of diﬀerent radio system types, 0 < βi < αi reﬂects
the fact that radio system exhibits a weak urge to when doing better than
others and a strong urge to reduce inequality when doing worse than the
others. This forces each radio system to make an eﬀort to eﬃciently use the
idle spectrum while taking fairness into consideration. Here, the only local
information needed is the radio system’s own history of the Onlinetime and
the Onlinetime of the other radio systems whose spectrum is within the
same spectrum block. This can be obtained by keeping a record of the busy
time of the required spectrum, which can be obtained by periodical spectrum
scanning. When there are more than two diﬀerent radio systems trying to
coexist in the same spectrum, diﬀerent radio systems can be identiﬁed by
some smart technologies (e.g., we can detect the diﬀerent transmitting power
levels to distinguish from diﬀerent radio systems). So each radio system can
access the spectrum based only on its own recorded history and the local
measurements performed by itself. λi can be estimated by historical usage
record of radio system type i. The priority parameter θi needs to be announced
by the radio system or be broadcast by some operator. If each radio system
can only gather an imperfect information about the spectrum usage time of
other radio systems, then there may be some degradation in the achieved
weighted fairness.
We model the arrival traﬃc as a Poisson process. It can be seen from
Figures 6.7 and 6.8 that all the diﬀerent radio systems have almost the same
airtime share and blocking probability by using the proposed HE access
scheme, which is what is desired for fairness.

6.4 Impact of QoS and Interference Temperature
Constraints
Previous work on secondary use of radio spectrum include [7,13,15–18]. Let
us consider a scenario similar to [18], where secondary users wish to use a
local, relatively short-term data service, and all users adopt a spread spec-
trum signaling format, in which the transmitted power is evenly spread across
the entire available band controlled by the manager. A practical realization
of this model would be when secondary users (with spread spectrum sig-
naling) and primary Direct-Sequence CDMA (DS-CDMA) system coexist in
the up-link spectrum band of the primary DS-CDMA system. In the uplink,
the interference temperature can be measured at the base station which is the
receiver of the primary system. Hence, the number of measuring points can be
signiﬁcantly reduced. But of course secondary access is deﬁnitely not limited
to this scenario. The spectrum can be available in a TV broadcast band or
other emergency band.
6.4.1 Secondary Spectrum Sharing Model
Spectrum with bandwidth W is to be shared among M spread spectrum users,
where a user refers to a transmitter and an intended receiver pair. For each i,
the received signal to interference ratio (SIR) is given by
γi =
yihii
1
L(
j̸=i yjhji) + σ2 ,
(6.8)
where L is the normalized spreading sequence length, yi is user i’s transmission
power, hij is the channel gain from user i’s transmitter to user j’s receiver,
and σ2 is the background noise power that is assumed to be the same for
all users. In order to satisfy an interference temperature constraint, the total
received power at a speciﬁed measurement point must satisfy
M

i=1
yihi0 ≤B,
(6.9)
where hi0 is the channel gain from user i’s transmitter to the measurement
point, and B > 0 is a pre-deﬁned threshold. We assume that all the secondary
users adopt a spread spectrum signaling format, in which the transmitted
power is evenly spread across the entire available band. This allows eﬃcient
multiplexing of data streams from diﬀerent sources corresponding to diﬀerent
applications, and reduces the combined power-bandwidth allocation problem
to a received power allocation problem. Hence, the interference temperature
constraint is translated to a total received power threshold B at the measuring
point.

6.4.2 Spectrum Assignment with Priority Classes
If diﬀerent users have diﬀerent contracts deﬁning diﬀerent priorities or
throughput, then it is acceptable for a spectrum operator to provide diﬀerent
throughputs. Let us say that secondary links, depending on their willingness
to pay belong to L priority classes. Let ai be the priority parameter for link i.
The operator problem is then to maximize the network revenue:
max 
i∈(i:xi=1) ai.

SIRi

∀i ∈(i : xi = 1)

∀i ∈(i : xi = 1)
yi
>0
∀i ∈(i : xi = 1)
yi
≤ymax
i
∀i ∈(i : xi = 1),
(6.10)
where xi is a collection of binary variables, xi = 1 means the ith link transmits
otherwise xi = 0. By maximizing this revenue, secondary users who pay more
will get accessing priority over those who pay less. We model the relation
between the price pi a user paid and the priority parameter ai as follows:
ai = pα
i ,
(6.11)
where 0 ≤α ≤1 is an operator designable parameter. Small α corresponds
to putting more emphasis on system capacity (number of active secondary
links), while large α corresponds to putting more emphasis on guaranteeing
service to the user paying higher price. Speciﬁcally, α = 0 corresponds to the
problem of maximizing the number of active secondary links (capacity).
6.4.3 Secondary Spectrum Sharing Potential Game
The nature of secondary spectrum sharing is temporary and distributed.
Therefore a practical secondary spectrum sharing scheme must be distributed.
In this section, we discuss such a distributed algorithm to solve the operator
problem discussed before. This distributed process is composed of two phases.
The coordination phase controls the optimal set of active secondary links
which can access the spectrum, and the power control phase is to allocate
transmit power to support the minimum target link SIR γt
i given the set of
active links.
Potential Games
Suppose there are M transmitter and receiver link pairs competing for the
secondary spectrum access opportunities. Let k be a time (iteration) counter
and N(x(k)) be the aggregate received power at the measuring point at time
k given by

(6.12)
In order to maximize the network revenue while keeping the aggregated
received power at the measuring point under the interference threshold, we
deﬁne the utility function ui(x) shown in Figure 6.9 for each link pair as
follows:
ui(x) =
⎧

minj∈(j:xj=1) γj < γt.
(6.13)
In the secondary spectrum sharing game each user maximizes its utility
function ui(x(k)) by its choice of being active or not. By maximizing this
utility function, the system will reach an operating point where the network
revenue is maximized while satisfying QoS and interference temperature con-
straints. To emphasize that the ith user has control only over its own choice,
we use an alternative notation ui(xi, x−i), where x−i denotes that vector con-
sisting of elements of x other than the ith element. And after each changing
of the active link set, the distributed power control algorithm DCPC [20] will
be activated to allocate the transmitting power. Results about the existence
of pure strategy Nash equilibrium for the potential game, etc. can be shown
to hold. A practical method to compute the Nash equilibrium would be to
use the sequential play where each player maximizes its own utility function

6 Codes and Games for Dynamic Spectrum Access
175
sequentially while other players’ strategies are ﬁxed. The sequential play will
never converge to a solution where the total received power at the measuring
point exceeds the interference temperature bound. Also, the sequential play
will always converge to a solution where all the active links are supported with
their target SIR. But, sequential play does not allow asynchronous updates by
individual users. This may cause signaling and other overhead. To overcome
this issue we consider a stochastic learning based distributed solution that is
described next.
Stochastic learning techniques have been successfully used in wireless
packet networks for on-line prediction, tracking and discrete power control
[19,20]. It is shown to be computationally simple and eﬃcient. Learning algo-
rithm determines probabilistic strategies for players by considering the history
of play. The probability updating algorithm used by each user is as given be-
low:
1. Set the initial probability pi(0).
2. At every time step k, the ith user chooses xi(k) = 1 or 0 (to transmit or
not) according to its action probability pi.
3. After distributed power control (DCPC [20]) phase, each player obtains a
feedback ui(x(k)) based on the set of all actions x.
4. Each player (i) updates its action probability according to the rule:
pi(k + 1) = pi(k) + bui(k)(1 −pi(k)) x(k) = 1
pi(k + 1) = pi(k) −bui(k)pi(k)
x(k) = 0,
(6.14)
where 0 < b < 1 is the step size, and ui(k) is utility function which lies
in the interval (0, 1).
5. If pi converges, stop. Otherwise, go to step 2.
The probabilistic update used in (6.14) is a stochastic learning automata
updating known as linear reward-inaction (LR−I) [2].
It can be proved that the proposed learning algorithm will converge to
one of the Nash equilibria of the game. It will never converge to a point
where the total received power at the measuring point exceeds the interference
temperature bound. The algorithm will always converge to a point where all
the active links are supported with their target SIR.
The learning automata algorithm needs less information and control sig-
naling to operate than the sequential play. The sequential play requires that
each player updates its strategy one by one. And at the time of decision, in
order to compute the utility function, the information required includes all
active users’ SIRs, priorities, and the current interference temperature. Signiﬁ-
cant control signaling is also required to accomplish this process distributively.
An alternative choice would be to run this sequential play at a central con-
troller. For the learning automata, asynchronous updating is permitted. The
only information needed is a feedback of the current utility function value.
To compute this utility function, each active user should report its SIR and
priority parameter to the measurement point which acting also as a central

controller. But the trade-oﬀis that learning automata converges much slower
than the sequential play. The information needed by these algorithms can be
distributed through a common control channel which has been assumed in
many similar literatures in this area.
One assumption in this chapter is that the interference temperature re-
mains constant during the secondary use of the spectrum. With mobile users,
the interference temperature may vary. One solution to account this variance
would be that the secondary access algorithm is triggered periodically. A short
period would ensure that when the interference temperature is violated, the
system would recover quickly.
Here, we ﬁrst present some numerical examples for a simple secondary
sharing system with only four transmitting and receiving pairs. The target
SIR is selected to be γt = 12.5, and the noise power is σ2 = 5 × 10−13, which
approximately corresponds to the thermal noise power for a bandwidth of 1
MHz. We consider low rate data users, using a spreading gain of L = 128.
Path gains are obtained using the simple path loss model hj = K/d4
j, where
K = 0.097. We set the interference temperature bound and noise ratio to
be B/σ2 = 60 (we use these ratios only to illustrate clearly how the system
works. Of course we can use lower ratio by reducing the target SIR). Under
equal priority case a = [1, 1, 1, 1]. When the learning automata algorithm is
used, the evolution of the total received power N(x) is shown in Figure 6.10.
As discussed, we see that the total received power converges to a value below the
interference temperature threshold B. The evolution of the choice probability
p is shown in Figure 6.11. After convergence, only links 2 and 3 are active with
equal probability initialization. It can be observed in Figure 6.10 that during the

settling phase, N(x) exceeds B. So, depending on the application, there should
be some pre-deﬁned extra margin to accommodate the ﬂuctuation during the
settling phase. But this may reduce the capacity of the secondary system.
Despite the suboptimal nature of the sequential play algorithm, the con-
vergence speed is dramatically reduced as shown in Figure 6.12. It can be seen
that the convergence speed is linear with respect to the number of secondary
link pairs.

Note that bit errors can occur even after optimal access, power control,
etc. If an error correcting code fails to correct these errors then this will
lead to packet losses–erasures at higher layers. Therefore, it is important to
consider erasure channels and techniques to mitigate packet losses. We discuss
a strategy that addresses this in the next section.
6.5 Fountain Codes for Dynamic Spectrum Access
In this section, we discuss a new class of erasure correction codes for packet-
based channels with erasures, called digital fountain codes [22–25], which can
be used to provide packet-level protection at the transport layer or higher,
augmenting the bit-level protection that may be provided by the medium ac-
cess control (MAC) and PHY layers. These codes are capable of correcting
missing or lost data. By recovering lost data packets without requiring re-
transmission from the sender, these codes eﬃciently and eﬀectively provide
reliability in data networks. And, like a water fountain producing an endless
supply of water drops, any of which can be used to ﬁll a glass, these foun-
tain codes can generate an unlimited number of encoded output packets, any
of which can be used to recover the original input packets. They have the
following characteristics:
• The ability to generate a potentially limitless amount of encoded data from
any original set of source data and providing reliable message delivery over
extremes of low to high network losses
• The ability to recover the original data from a subset of successfully re-
ceived encoded data regardless of which speciﬁc encoded data has been
received
• Exceptionally fast encoding and decoding algorithms–operating at nearly
symmetric speeds that grow only linearly with the amount of source data
to be processed and independently of the actual amount of network loss
6.5.1 Erasure Channels
In erasure channels packet losses occur at the receiver due to a variety of
reasons. For example, if the bit error correcting code fails, then the erroneous
packets may not be passed on to the higher layers in the protocol stack.
Therefore, the application layer sees this as an erasure. In erasure channels
we can assume that a packet is either received intact or is lost.
In a wireless network, packet loss generally occurs due to following reasons:
• Packets get discarded en route to their destination for various reasons
such as buﬀer overﬂows and congestion control at intermediate routers.
• Packets get corrupted due to noise and interference.
• In a secondary user environment, when a primary user occupies a channel,
secondary users loose their packets on that channel.

Fig. 6.13. M-ary erasure channel model.
A M-ary erasure channel is shown in Figure 6.13, where all input points
{0, 1, 2, . . . , m −1} have a probability 1 −p of being received correctly and
a probability p of being lost or discarded (i.e., erased). If the perfect channel
(i.e., p = 0) capacity is C then the capacity of the erasure channel is (1−p)C.
The traditional method for having reliable communication over such type
of channels uses feedback to request for retransmission in order to make up
for erased packets, but they perform poorly in the following circumstances:
• One-to-many transmission: In broadcast, if all receivers request for re-
transmission then the number of retransmissions at the sender is going to
be very high which decreases the overall eﬃciency.
• Transmission over bad channels (i.e., if p is high), here again the number
of retransmissions will be high causing the overall performance to suﬀer.
• If the sender–receiver distance is large then the eﬀect of propagation delay
due to retransmissions may be signiﬁcant.
To deal with the above problems of feedback-based protocols new trans-
mission solutions using erasure correcting codes have been proposed. So if
some bits in a packet are lost or errors could not be corrected using a forward
error correcting (FEC) code then it may be recovered using erasure correcting
codes. It is required that these codes be capable of correcting as many erasures
as possible and at the same time have fast encoding and decoding algorithms.
Since the channel capacity is (1−p)C independent of the feedback channel,
erasure correcting codes try to achieve this capacity without using feedback.
Traditional erasure codes are [N, K] block codes such as Reed-Solomon (RS)
and Tornado codes [22, 23]. In these codes, any K or slightly more than K
out of N outputs are suﬃcient to recover the original K inputs. But they are
practical only for small values of K and N. Furthermore, both the codes are
ﬁxed rate codes, i.e., if the channel conditions deteriorate, additional redun-
dant packets cannot be generated on the ﬂy. Therefore to construct a reliable
and robust transmission over erasure channels, a new class of rateless codes
called digital fountain codes have been developed. In the following sections
we will discuss Luby Transform (LT Codes) and Raptor Codes.

180
Yiping Xing et al.
6.5.2 LT Codes
LT codes [24] that we describe here, are a new class of codes introduced by
Luby in 1998 for the purpose of scalable and fault tolerant distribution of
data over computer networks. The basic idea is as follows. The encoder can
be thought of as a digital fountain that produces a continuous supply of water
drops (i.e., output packets) called output points. Let’s say the original ﬁle or
message data consists of K packets or input points. The length of each input
point can be arbitrary, from one-bit to l > 1-bits. Now, in order to completely
decode the received stream, one needs to hold a bucket under the digital
fountain and collects drops until the number of drops in the bucket is a little
larger than K. This means that decoding does not depend on which packets
were received but only on the number of received packets.
LT codes are rateless in the sense that the number of output points that can
be generated from the original data is potentially limitless and their number
can be determined on the ﬂy. Depending on the erasure probability we can
send as many output points as are needed in order for the decoder to recover
the original message. The original message can be recovered from any set of
N output points, for N slightly larger than K, for a [N, K] code.
LT codes also have very small encoding and decoding complexities. If the
original data consists of K input points then each output point can be gene-
rated, independently of all other output points, on average with O(ln(K/ϵ))
point operations, and the K original input points can be recovered from any
N output points with probability 1 −ϵ, where N is O(
√
K ln2(K/ϵ)) more
than K, for ϵ > 0. Luby describes these codes as universal due to their being
near optimal for every erasure channel and being very eﬃcient as the data
length grows.
Encoding Process
For a given set (x1, x2, ..., xK) of input points, the output points (y1, y2, ...)
can be generated in the following steps:
1. For each output point, randomly select a degree k from a degree distri-
bution Ψ(k) on (1, 2, ..., K).
2. Select uniformly at random k distinct input points from (x1, x2, ..., xK).
3. Set the output point equal to the bitwise XOR-sum of these k input points.
This process can be represented by a bipartite graph, connecting the input
points to the output points. Here, in order for the decoder to recover the input
points from the output points, it needs to know the exact graph, i.e., which k
input points have been used to generate an output point. This information has
to be communicated to the receiver in some manner. It could be accomplished
in any of the following ways:
• Sender and receiver can use identical pseudo-random number generators,
seeded by the clock if it is synchronized.

6 Codes and Games for Dynamic Spectrum Access
181
• By a pseudo-random process which can determine the degree and the
connections given a key, say ν. Then the sender generates ν to com-
pute the output point and transmits the key in the header of the packet.
If packet size is much larger than the key size (32 bits or so) then it adds
only a small overhead.
Decoding Process
The decoder, having received N output points and the bipartite graph, can
recover the input points in the following steps. We will call output points that
have been reduced to degree one as reduced points.
1. Find an output point yj from the set of reduced points that is connected
to an input point, say, xi. If Reduced Points Set (RPS) is empty, this
process cannot proceed further, and decoding fails.
2. Set xi = yj.
3. Add (bitwise XOR) xi to all the output points that are connected to xi.
4. Remove all the edges connected to the input point xi.
5. Go to step(1) untill all x′
is are determined.
The above decoding process looks simple but it turns out that the degree
distribution Ψ(k) plays a critical part for the success of the decoding process.
The probability that RPS is not empty depends on Ψ(k). Therefore, for good
decoding performance we need to choose a good degree distribution.
The Degree Distribution
The degree distribution should be designed so as to meet the following design
criteria:
• Most of the packets should have low degree so as to initiate the decoding
process and keep the RPS from being empty.
• Some of the packets should also have high degree so as to make sure that
all input points are connected to at least one of the output points.
The Ideal Soliton Distribution
In order to satisfy the above criteria an ideal soliton distribution has been
proposed
Ψ(k) =

1/K
if k = 1
1/k(k −1) for all k = 2, 3, . . . , K.
The motivation for the choice of the ideal soliton distribution is that at each
iteration, the rate at which the input points are covered (decoded) is the
same as the rate of output points joining the RPS. This prevents the decod-
ing process from failure by making sure that at each step there are reduced

182
Yiping Xing et al.
points which are ready to be decoded. And in order to avoid redundancy, this
distribution causes the graph to reduce the degree of output points in a way
that exactly one reduced point appears at the end of each iteration. For the
ideal soliton distribution the expected degree is ln(K).
In practice this distribution performs poorly because a slight deviation
from its expected behavior may create a situation where there is no out-
put point with degree one, and that will cause the decoding process to stop.
In order to avoid this problem the robust soliton distribution has been inves-
tigated.
The Robust Soliton Distribution
The robust soliton distribution denoted by Ω(k) is deﬁned in the following
manner. It is deﬁned by two parameters, ϵ and σ. The parameter ϵ sets a
bound on the probability of decoding failure and the parameter σ adjusts the
RPS. The expected size of the RPS is given by
R = σ ln(K/ϵ)
√
K,
instead of one as in the case of ideal soliton distribution. Now we deﬁne another
function
Φ(k) =

for k = 1, 2, . . . , (K/R) −1
(R/K)ln( R

for k > K/R
which is added to the ideal soliton distribution Ψ(k) and normalized to obtain
the robust soliton distribution Ω(k) as follows:
Ω(k) = Ψ(k) + Φ(k)

k=1(Ψ(k) + Φ(k)), is the normalization factor and it determines
the number of output points, N, required to recover the K input points with
probability 1 −ϵ, where N = ZK. Figure 6.14 shows the robust soliton dis-
tribution.
In [24], Luby’s analysis explains how Φ(k) lets the decoding process to
begin with a moderate size of RPS, but a spike at k = K/R ensures that
every input point has at least one connection with the set of output points.
Luby’s key result is that N = K(1 + 2Φ(K/R)) output points are suﬃcient
to recover original K input points with probability at least 1 −ϵ. The only
disadvantage is that the decoding complexity grows as O(K ln(K)). In order
to reduce the decoding complexity to O(K), Raptor codes have been designed
by Shokrollahi [25].

6.5.3 Raptor Codes
Raptor codes [25], ﬁrst developed by Shokrollahi, are designed to achieve
linear time encoding and decoding complexity. This is accomplished by ﬁrst
pre-coding the source data by an appropriate outer code to generate the input
points for the LT code as shown in Figure 6.15.
The main idea of pre-coding can be explained as follows. LT codes have a
complexity of the order of ln(K) per packet, because the average degree per
output point is ln(K). Raptor codes use LT codes with average degree ¯k ≈3.
The advantage of using a lower degree is that the decoder will work almost
surely and will not get stuck but there is a possibility that a fraction of the
input points may not be connected to any of the output points and hence they
cannot be recovered by the decoding process. Let the fraction that remains
unrecovered be δ, and let the original message contain M packets. Then if
we use a pre-code that generates K = M/(1 −δ) packets as input points for
a LT code then once slightly more than K of the output points have been
received, we can recover (1 −δ)K of the input points, i.e., pre-coded packets,
then we can use the pre-code decoder to recover the original message as shown
in Figure 6.16. Here, M = 9 source packets are pre-coded to generate K = 13
input points for the LT Code to generate N = 15 output points. Here, output
points have low degree and three of the input points have no connection with
any of the output points, hence they cannot be recovered by LT decoding, so
LT decoding will recover only ten of the input points, which are used by the
pre-code decoder to deduce original nine source packets.

6.5.4 Secondary Usage of Spectrum using LT Codes
In the secondary user scenario, a SU selects a set of subchannels from PU’s
bands (Figure 6.4) to establish a Secondary User Link (SUL). A SUL is a
set of subchannels that adapts itself in accordance with the PU’s spectral
activity on that band. The SU is required to vacate the subchannel as soon as
the corresponding PU becomes active on that subchannel. This forces SU to
loose packets on that subchannel. To compensate for this loss caused by PU
Interference, LT codes can be used before transmitting packets on these sub-
channels (Figure 6.17). Let the SU have a message of K packets to transmit.
It uses LT codes to encode it to N + X packets (as shown in Figure 6.17),
where N is the number of packets required to recover the original K packets
with probability 1 −ϵ and X is the redundancy required to compensate for
the loss due to the interference by the PU. This in turn depends on the PU
arrival probability p. So the SUL behaves like an erasure channel with erasure
probability equal to p.
Assuming that one packet is transmitted per subchannel, the total number
of subchannels used by SU is S = N + X, and this transmission will be
successful only if at most X of the subchannels are captured by the PUs.
Therefore, the probability of successful transmission for the SU is
Psuccess =
X

i=0
 N + X

pi(1 −p)N+X−i.
(6.15)
Let Tp be the time required for transmission of each packet and W be
the bandwidth per subchannel. Then the spectral eﬃciency (η) can be com-
puted by
η =
NPsuccess
S × W × Tp
.

6.6 Summary
This chapter gives an overview of some game and coding theoretic approaches
to dynamic spectrum access. Several game theoretic formulations of distri-
buted dynamic spectrum access are presented. Existence of Nash and Pareto
optimal solutions to these games are discussed. Stochastic learning automa-
ton based techniques to solve these games using local information are also
presented.
Secondary spectrum access is modelled as a communication over an era-
sure channel. Application of LT and Raptor codes for secondary user link
maintenance over these channels are discussed. Some simulation results are
presented to outline the trade-oﬀbetween redundancy and spectral eﬃciency
in the presence of primary users.

Abstract. Cognitive radio devices have been considered as a key technology for
next-generation of wireless communication. These devices can opportunistically uti-
lize the wireless spectrum to achieve better individual device/user performance and
improve the overall spectrum-utilization eﬃciency. However, allowing opportunistic
use of the wireless spectrum creates new problems such as peaceful coexistence with
other wireless technologies as well as understanding the inﬂuence of interference
that each of these networks can create. In this chapter we model the eﬃciency of
the cognitive radios from the Medium Access Control (MAC) analytically and study
the improvement that cognitive radios can get compared to conventional radios. Then
we consider the eﬀect of peaceful coexistence with diﬀerent types of cognitive radios
and also consider a simple spectrum sensing protocol which is a function of the
primary utilization and required opportunity.
7.1 Introduction
Wireless networks are regulated today by government agencies wherein spec-
trum is allocated to a particular application. Such a static allocation has
resulted in immense spectrum crunch in some parts of the spectrum and non-
usage in some other parts of the spectrum. As a result the average spectral
utilization is very low over most of the bands. Since spectrum is a natural re-
source, any wastage in spectrum impedes the growth of wireless technologies
and augments the need for opportunistic usage of spectrum. Cognitive radios
are seen as a way to mitigate this low spectral usage. These radios sense the
medium and dynamically adapt their waveforms to comply with the compli-
ance policies ﬁxed by the regulatory authorities and opportunistically access
portions of the spectrum that are not used by the primary systems.
As an example consider the wireless evolution in unlicensed bands. In these
bands any technology that complies with the Federal Communications Com-
mission (FCC) [10], rules for the band is allowed to operate. A good example of
such a band is the Industrial Scientiﬁc and Medical (ISM) band in 2.4 GHz.
There are multiple wireless technologies that are operating in these bands

such as IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN), cordless phones
and Bluetooth Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN). Other examples
of unlicensed frequency bands include the UNI II and UNI III bands where
systems such as IEEE 802.11a WLAN and soon IEEE 802.11n WLAN. While
unlicensed bands have opened up avenues for the advent of new technologies,
their full potential is not realizable because of the presence of interference
from other technologies operating in those bands. These unlicensed bands are
over crowded, while, some licensed bands, such as the TV bands, are not fully
utilized. This results in poor spectrum utilization.
To overcome this poor spectrum utilization, Federal Communication issued
an NPRM, [6], in year 2004 which recommends opportunistic usage of wireless
technologies in TV bands. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA) has also started the neXt Generation (XG) Communications pro-
gram to develop new technologies which allow multiple users to share the
spectrum through adaptive mechanisms [11]. The US Army has also been
researching the so-called “Adaptive Spectrum Exploitation” (ASE) for real-
time spectrum management in the battleﬁeld [12, 13]. Although the focus of
these programs is somehow diﬀerent, the basic principles are the same: if radio
devices can explore the wireless spectrum and locate sparsely-used spectral
bands, they can exploit these bands in an opportunistic way to improve not
only the devices’ performance but also the overall spectrum utilization. In the
long run, such cognitive radios can also facilitate secondary markets in spec-
trum use (e.g, a licensee may allow secondary spectrum uses by a third party)
and automated frequency coordination among diﬀerent radio systems [10].
The IEEE 802.22 working group is developing a new standard to provide last
mile access to rural areas by opportunistically accessing the spectrum that is
not currently used by primary users in the TV bands. Details of this working
group can be found at the IEEE 802.22 web site [40].
Of course, such cognitive radios cannot be realized without developing
new hardware/software and changing the current spectrum allocation policies.
Fortunately, the advances in Software Deﬁned Radio (SDR) [14,15] have en-
abled the development of ﬂexible and powerful radio interfaces for supporting
spectral agility. Also, the FCC ongoing reviews of the current spectrum regu-
lations are also expediting the adoption of more ﬂexible spectrum allocation
policies for spectral agility. However, there remain many open questions that
we need to answer before realizing spectral agility.1 The ﬁrst and the foremost
question is to what extent the improvement can be, in terms of spectrum uti-
lization and individual devices’ performance. Without a clear understanding
of the achievable improvement, one cannot justify the use of spectral agility
since controlling a spectral-agile network may incur considerable amount of
overhead. This leads to several implementation questions, including how in-
dividual devices discover and identify sparsely-used spectrum bands, how to
1 Spectral agility is one of the important functions of cognitive radio. We will mainly
concentrate on this functionality in this chapter.

characterize or prioritize these spectrum bands, and how and when to utilize
them. Obviously, diﬀerent implementations incur diﬀerent amounts of con-
trol overhead. Thus, the ﬁnal question is how the thus-incurred control over-
head degrades the achievable improvement of using spectral agility. Without
answering these questions, it is meaningless and diﬃcult to develop spectral-
agile communication protocols and networks in an eﬀective way. IEEE formu-
lated a new working group, in Nov. 2004, called IEEE 802.22 and named it
as Wireless Regional Area Network (WRAN).
In this chapter, we address some of these questions as follows. First, we
establish an analytical model and provide an upper-bound performance analy-
sis for cognitive radio networks whose main functionality is spectral agility.
The analysis sets the benchmark of an ideal spectral-agile network’s perfor-
mance, and thus, enables the evaluation of diﬀerent implementations. Then
we consider the case where diﬀerent cognitive radio networks have to share the
same spectral resources. After that we concentrate on a simple way that the
cognitive radio can exploit the spectral opportunity. This chapter is a recap
of some of the fundamental results obtained in [1–4].
7.2 System Model
We consider two types of networks, namely primary and secondary2 networks.
A primary network has exclusive access to designated spectral bands while a
secondary network only accesses a spectral band when the primary network
does not use that band. For example, a primary network can be any licensed-
band network, and a secondary network is an unlicensed-band network such
as an IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN. To realize such an opportunistic use of
primary networks’ spectral resources, we assume that a secondary network
has spectral agility, which is enabled by the SDR. It is then a secondary
network’s responsibility to locate available resources, in both spectral and
temporal domains, as shown in Figure 7.1.
Even though it is desirable to have the entire spectrum accessible by a sec-
ondary network, hardware limitations (such as antenna designs) usually deter-
mine the accessible range. Therefore, the “wireless spectrum” in this chapter
is referred to as the portion of the wireless spectrum which can be accessed
by a secondary network. The spectrum is divided into “channels”, which are
the smallest units of a spectral band. We assume that each secondary net-
work only uses a single channel for basic communication, but it can also use
multiple channels for better performance. For example, the SDR makes it pos-
sible to adopt a modulation scheme requiring higher bandwidth when several
adjacent channels are available simultaneously. Moreover, it is also possible
to use discrete channels as sub-carriers of a multi-carrier modulation scheme
(such as the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)) or
2 Cognitive radios are also called as secondary radios in this chapter.

use these channels in adaptive frequency hopping [12] for transmission in a
multi-path fading environment.
We assume that the temporal usage of each channel (by the primary net-
work/user of that channel) can be characterized by a random process. When
a primary network does not always use its designated channel, it leaves some
“holes” in the channel’s usage schedule which may be exploited by secondary
networks. As shown in Figure 7.1, the blank spots represent such holes and
each hole is referred to as a spectral opportunity in the rest of the chapter.
For example, there exists a spectral opportunity in channel 4 after t = t1.
Moreover, the entire spectrum is regarded as providing a spectral opportu-
nity between t = t2 and t = t3. Depending on a primary network’s spectrum
usage pattern, the duration of a spectral opportunity can be up to several
hours or even days in spectral bands reserved for emergency, or can be only
few milliseconds in heavily-used spectral bands. It is relatively easy for a sec-
ondary network to use long-lasting opportunities. However, for short-lasting
or “ephemeral” opportunities, a secondary network may not be able to detect
their existence and then utilize them before they “expire”. Therefore, we only
focus on the case when spectral opportunities last in the order of seconds.
In order to exploit spectral opportunities, a secondary network has to ﬁrst
scan the spectrum, either periodically or randomly, to discover the opportu-
nities. It should be noted that the problem here diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the
problems of using dynamic frequency selection mechanisms in the existing
systems, such as Dynamic Channel Selection (DCS) [17] in cellular networks,
dynamic frequency selection(DFS) [18] in the IEEE 802.11h standard or Auto
Frequency Allocation (AFA) [19] in the HiperLAN. These schemes address

7 Eﬃciency and Coexistence Strategies for Cognitive Radio
193
the problem of choosing a good channel (either a frequency in the Frequency
Division Multiple Access (FDMA) system, or time slots in the Time Division
Multiple Access (TDMA) system) so that transmission in that channel expe-
riences less interference or causes less interference to other transmissions in
the same channel. In our problem, a spectral-agile network seeks both spectral
and temporal opportunities in the wireless spectrum, and utilizes these op-
portunities opportunistically. Among the found opportunities, a spectral-agile
secondary network decides on which opportunities to use and when to utilize
them. If and when activities of a primary network are detected, the secondary
network must vacate the channel in order not to interfere with the primary
network. Obvious, all wireless nodes (i.e., radio devices) in a secondary net-
work must use the same spectral opportunity at any time instant to maintain
their inter-connectivity. Therefore, the wireless nodes in a spectral-agile net-
work also need to disseminate the information of spectral opportunities and
the decision of switching among opportunities. So the MAC of the cognitive
radio has to perform the above functions to access the spectrum opportunis-
tically. Having explained the system model of cognitive radio, we will now
derive the improvements that can be obtained by cognitive radios compared
to conventional radios.
7.3 Spectral Utilization of Cognitive Radio
We establish a mathematical model to analyze the potential improvements
gained by using spectral agility, in terms of a secondary network’s spectral
utilization and packet blocking/waiting time. The spectral utilization of a
secondary network is measured by the total amount of time a secondary net-
work can access a channel for transmission. One can convert the channel access
time to the network’s actual throughput once the underlying Medium Access
Control (MAC) and modulation mechanisms are speciﬁed. Therefore, we use
channel access time so as not to be conﬁned to any speciﬁc MAC and modula-
tion schemes. The packet blocking time is deﬁned as the time interval during
which a secondary network has no spectral opportunity to utilize (thus, it has
to suspend all transmissions).
Consider that there are N primary networks with N designated channels
(one designated channel per primary network), and there are M secondary
networks seeking spectral opportunities. The usage pattern of the primary net-
work in each channel is assumed to be an i.i.d. ON/OFF random process with
independent ON- and OFF-periods. An ON-period represents that a channel
is busy while an OFF-period is regarded as a potential spectral opportunity
for secondary networks. To simplify our analysis, we assume that the dis-
tributions of both ON- and OFF-periods in each channel are exponentially
distributed with means equal to Ton and Toff, respectively. We will explore
diﬀerent distributions using simple simulations at the end of this section.

194
N. Sai Shankar
In order to provide a performance upper-bound, we assume that each
secondary network has an inﬁnite amount of traﬃc to transmit. Moreover,
each secondary network can scan a channel, switch to a channel and vacate a
channel instantly without incurring any control overhead or delay. The control
overhead and delays are implementation-dependent, and will certainly impact
on the improvement which is not in the scope of this chapter. In order to
provide a comparative feel for the performance improvement of using spectral
agility, we introduce and use a “naive” secondary network which listens to
a ﬁxed channel (i.e., without spectral agility), and transmits only when that
channel is not used by the primary network. The spectral utilization of such a
naive secondary network can easily be computed as
Toff
Ton+Toff , and the average
blocking time is Ton.
7.3.1 A Special Case: M = 1
We ﬁrst consider a special case when there is only one secondary network. As
shown in Figure 7.2, the only time interval during which a secondary network
has no channel for traﬃc transmission is when all channels are occupied by
the primary networks. Such blocking intervals, denoted as tblock, always begin
when a channel switches from an OFF-period to an ON-period and ends when
one channel switches from an ON-period to an OFF-period. Therefore, tblock
is computed as
tblock =
min
i=1,2,...,N(T (i)
remain),
(7.1)
where T (i)
remain is the remaining ON-period in channel i. Given that the dis-
tributions of ON-periods are independent and exponentially distributed, one
can compute the distribution of tblock as
P(tblock = t) = N · e−Ton

The above equation shows that with spectral agility, a secondary network can
reduce the average blocking time to
Ton
N , as compared to Ton in the naive
secondary network without agility. The spectral utilization of such a spectral-
agile secondary network is obtained by
U = 1 −N(pN−1 · Ton

Ton + Toff

(7.3)
where p =
Ton
Ton+Toff is the probability that a channel is occupied by the
primary network. The above equation is derived based on the fact that a
blocking interval starts only if a channel switches from an OFF-period to
an ON-period while all other channels have already been in the ON-periods.
Equation 7.3 can be simpliﬁed further to

computed as

7.3.2 The General Case
Equation 7.4 shows that the spectral utilization of a spectral-agile secondary
network is simply a function of the primary network’s channel utilization,
τ =
Ton
Ton+Toff . We can generalize this simple equation for the case when
diﬀerent channels have diﬀerent utilizations, say, channel i with utilization
τi =

k channels available simultaneously is computed as

(7.6)
where Sk
c is a set of k channels, chosen from N channels, which are available for
spectral-agile secondary networks. For example, we can set Sk
1 = {1, 2, . . . , k},
Sk
2 = {2, 3, . . . , k + 1}, and so on.
To further generalize our analysis, we assume that there are M > 1
spectral-agile secondary networks trying to exploit available spectral oppor-
tunities. Obviously, each secondary network obtains exactly one channel if

196

there are more than M channels available simultaneously. Otherwise, these
M secondary networks have to share the idle channels. The spectral utiliza-
tion of each spectral-agile network is then computed by

(7.7)
As we mentioned in Section 7.2, the SDR allows a radio device to dynamically
use a variety of MAC and modulation schemes, depending on the underlying
wireless environment. Therefore, a spectral-agile network can use multiple
channels simultaneously and thus, acquire more channel access time for better
performance. We explain how to analyze this type of spectral-agile networks
at the end of this section.
Since there are now M > 1 secondary networks, each aforementioned naive
secondary network (i.e., without agility) can use two approaches to choose
a channel: (1) each network selects its own channel and (2) all secondary
networks cooperate in a way that no more than one secondary network uses
the same channel, if this is possible. The advantage of the ﬁrst approach is the
simplicity while the advantage of the second approach is that each secondary
network obtains more channel access time.
1) Approach I: Random channel selection: Given that a secondary network
chooses channel i, the probability that the other k secondary networks
also choose the same channel is
pk =
(M −1)!
k!(M −1 −k)!( 1

Here, we simply average all the possibilities of choosing M channels from
N channels for the (no-agility) secondary networks. We set
N!
M!(N−M)! = 1
in case of M > N.
Now, we can compare the spectral utilization of a secondary network using
(1) spectral agility, (2) no agility with random channel selection (Approach I)
and (3) no agility with coordinated channel selection (Approach II) based on
Equations 7.7, 7.10, and 7.11. We investigate two scenarios with N = 12 and
N = 3, respectively. The main reason for choosing these numbers is that there
are 12 (non-overlapping) channels in the 5-GHz band for the IEEE 802.11a
wireless LAN and 3 (non-overlapping) channels in the 2.4-GHz band for the
IEEE 802.11b wireless LAN.3 Therefore, even though spectral agility cannot
be applied immediately to the licensed bands due to the current regulations,
the 802.11 wireless LAN may use spectral agility to improve performance in
the crowded, unlicensed bands.
Figure 7.3 shows the case of N = 12 and M = 9 with diﬀerent average
channel loads generated by the primary networks. For each given channel load,
we choose the loads of these 12 channels in two diﬀerent ways: homogeneous

and heterogeneous loads. By choosing homogeneous loads, each channel has
a load equal to the average channel load. By choosing heterogeneous loads,
we let each channel have a diﬀerent load and the variance of these loads
be maximized (i.e., the utilization of each channel diﬀers from each other
signiﬁcantly). The results show that using spectral agility always achieves
a higher spectral utilization of the secondary network, as compared to the
case of either no agility with random channel selection or no agility with
coordinated channel selection. Of course, the improvement by using spectral
agility is much less (still more than 25% in most cases) as compared to the case
of no agility with coordinated channel selection. However, using coordinated
channel selection needs oﬀ-line channel information for selecting channels. If
the channel loads are very diverse, it is possible that a secondary network
may choose the busy channels (unless it scans all channels for a long enough
period of time). In contrast, using spectral agility allows a secondary network
to dynamically choose the channel with the least activities. Such advantages
are also illustrated in Figure 7.3 as we achieve an extra 8–10% improvement
in the case of heterogeneous loads when the channel load is around 0.2–0.3.
Another observation is that the improvement saturates when the average
channel load of the primary network is greater than 0.5. This can be ex-
plained by Figure 7.4, which shows the fraction of time in which a secondary

network can access a channel. The fraction of time in which a secondary net-
work can access a channel linearly decreases with the increase of the average
channel load when the channel load beyond 0.3. Because of such linearity, the
improvement of using spectral agility remains unchanged when the channel
load increases. Figure 7.4 also suggests that when the average channel load of
the primary network is very large, it does not make much sense to use spec-
tral agility as suggested by Figure 7.3 (where it shows an 80% improvement
when the load is 0.9). This is because when the channel is extremely busy,
the amount of access time that each spectral-agile network can obtain is very
small (less than 10% of the total time when the channel load is 0.9). There-
fore, the control overhead (incurred by using spectral agility) may exhaust
most of the channel access time a secondary network obtains, and thus, easily
oﬀsets the improvement gained by using spectral agility.
Next, we consider the case of M > N and choose N = 3 and M = 5 as
an example. Figure 7.5 shows that using spectral agility and using no agility
with coordinated channel selection achieve exactly the same performance.
The results make sense because when M > N, there are simply not enough

channels for all secondary networks (so they have to share the idle channels
with each other). There are some marginal improvements by using spectral
agility as compared to using no agility with random channel selection. This is
simply because some idle channels may be left unused in the case of random
channel selection. In fact, one can simplify both Equations 7.7 and 7.11 as

when M > N.
Fortunately, ﬁeld studies have shown that there are many under-utilized
spectral resources in some wireless spectral band [20, 21]. Moreover, there
are two additional advantages of using spectral agility that we have not yet
discussed when M > N. First, Equation 7.2 shows that when the spectral
agility is used, the average blocking time is reduced by a factor of N in the
special case or reduced from


in the general case. Thus, even
though the spectral utilization is not improved by using spectral agility when
M > N, the packet delays are reduced signiﬁcantly by using spectral agility.
Another advantage is the spectral-agile network’s capability of using multiple
channels. In the above analysis, we assumed that a spectral-agile network
(or more precisely, the wireless nodes in the network) always uses a single
channel, even when more than one channel are available. We can expect that
if a spectral-agile network can use all available channels, the performance must
be improved. Figure 7.6 illustrates this scenario in which each spectral-agile
network aggregates all available channels into a single, higher-capacity spectral
opportunity. Then all spectral-agile networks use this aggregated opportunity,
in contrast with using separate channels for transmission as discussed earlier.

This will provide a multiplexing gain just as we can obtain by multiplexing
several traﬃc ﬂows on a high-capacity transmission line in conventional wired
networks.
Before we analyze the multiplexing gain of using multiple channels, let us
investigate the eﬀects of diﬀerent ON/OFF distributions on the improvement
of spectral utilization, gained by using spectral agility. The main purpose
of this study is to verify the applicability of our model, which is established
based on the assumption of exponentially-distributed ON-/OFF periods. Here,
we use Matlab to simulate the random ON/OFF periods and calculate the
total time intervals of overlapping ON-periods (i.e., the blocking intervals
for a spectral-agile network) for the case of N = 3 and M = 1. We use
exponential (as in our earlier derivation), uniform and Rayleigh distributions.
Figure 7.7 shows a very good match between our analytical results and the
simple simulation results, verifying the applicability of our analytical model.
The reason why the improvements are much higher is because there is only one
spectral network seeking spectral opportunities, and thus, it need not share
spectral opportunities with other spectral-agile networks. Also as we discussed
earlier, such a large improvement in fact represents only a very small increase

of the primary network is extremely high.
7.3.3 The Multiplexing Gain of Using Multiple Channels
If all spectral-agile networks use the aggregated spectral opportunities, pack-
ets from all spectral-agile networks share the same “channel” with a varying
transmission capacity as shown in Figure 7.6. The transmission capacity de-
pends on how many primary networks are using the channels, and the dis-
tribution of the transmission capacity is determined by Equation 7.6. If the
arrival process in each spectral-agile network is assumed to be Poisson with
rate λ, the aggregated arrival process is also Poisson with rate Mλ. There-
fore, the system can be modelled as an M/G/1 queueing system. However, it
is possible that all channels are occupied by primary networks, with proba-
bility r0 in Equation 7.6 and for an average duration of
1
N
i

, so that the
transmission capacity is zero from the spectral-agile networks’ perspectives.
This blocking process is modelled as another arrival process with rate

the “packet” with an average service time of

. The resulting M/G/1
queue with preemptive priority is illustrated in Figure 7.8(b). The average
packet waiting time of a spectral-agile network (Figure 7.9) is then computed
by using the results in [22] as

We can use the M/G/1 queueing model with preemptive priority for the
case when each spectral-agile network uses at most one channel. In this case,
the “service rate” is constant (from the perspective of packets of a secondary
network), and is equal to the transmission capacity of a single channel unless
all the channels are occupied by the primary networks. However, packet ar-
rivals in a channel changes with the number of active primary networks. That
is, the packet arrivals in a channel are dependent on the state of the primary
network’s occupation of the spectrum. The less the number of idle channels,
the greater the arrival rate in each idle channel. We can model this arrival
process as a Markov-Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP) using Equation 7.6,
but for the sake of simplicity we approximate the arrival process as a Poisson
process, which gives us an M/D/1 queue with preemptive priority. In order to
model it as a Poisson process, we need to calculate the average arrival rate.
1) Case I: M < N:
If there are at least M channels available, then the arrival rate at the M/G/1
queue is just λ. If the number of available channels is M −1, then one of the
spectral-agile networks joins the channel which has already been “occupied”
by another spectral-agile network. That is, multiple spectral-agile networks
share one channel. The average arrival rate is then
M
M−1λrk. Proceeding sim-
ilarly, we have the average arrival rate computed as
λnew =

i=M

λ.
(7.16)
2) Case II: M > N:
In this case we have more spectral-agile networks than the total number of
channels. If none of the channels are occupied by the primary network, then
the best-case arrangement occurs when each channel has ⌈M
N ⌉spectral-agile
networks. Proceeding similarly to the previous subsection, we have the arrival
rate λ computed as
λnew =
N−1

i=0

(7.17)
Finally, we can use Equations 7.13 and 7.15 with the new average arrival
rate and constant packet service time
L
C . The calculation is available in
Appendix A.
Figure 7.13 plots the average packet waiting time of a spectral-agile when
using a single channel and multiple channels. We ﬁx the value of Toff = 1 s
and change the value of Ton, so that we can vary the average channel load from
the primary network in each channel. Obviously, the average packet waiting
time in the case of M < N is less than that in the case of M > N since there

7 Eﬃciency and Coexistence Strategies for Cognitive Radio
205
are less spectral-agile networks seeking spectral opportunities in the case of
M < N. However, the packet waiting time of using multiple channels is always
less than that of using a single channel in both cases. The improvement is even
more signiﬁcant in the case of M > N as we expect. These numerical results
demonstrate the potential advantage of using multiple channels in a spectral-
agile especially when M > N.
7.4 Coexistence and the Access Problem
in Cognitive Radios
Having studied the gains that can be obtained using cognitive radio, we
will now study the coexistence methodology based on the experience in unli-
censed bands. Some concerns on the unlicensed spectrum usage are discussed
in [32–34]. Within unlicensed frequency bands, the radio systems have to
coordinate the usage of radio resources among themselves. With this open
spectrum approach, there is then of course the problem of how to achieve fair
and eﬃcient sharing of radio resources between dissimilar radio systems that
cannot communicate with each other. Unlicensed frequency bands are typi-
cally used by many dissimilar radio systems to provide a large set of diﬀerent
radio services. However, unlicensed frequency bands may be more eﬃciently
used when the usage of the radio resources is coordinated by means of spec-
trum etiquette rules. A spectrum etiquette is a set of rules for radio resource
management to be followed by radio systems that operate in an unlicensed
band. It may help to establish a fair access to the available radio resources,
in addition to a more eﬃcient usage of the radio spectrum.
This and subsequent sections will discuss the following:
• Continuous-time Markov chain modelling of spectrum etiquette for dy-
namic spectrum access is presented. Systems with and without queueing
are investigated.
• A fair, random channel access protocol is derived based on the Markov
model.
• The channel access protocol is extended to cognitive radios.
Recently, as more and more communication protocols and commercial
wireless devices are being developed to operate in crowded unlicensed spec-
trum bands, spectrum ineﬃciency is becoming a serious problem. Spectral
agility is being paid considerable attention for its potential to alleviate the
spectrum access ineﬃciency problem [35–37]. If the radio device has the ﬂex-
ibility of switching operating spectral bands, promising improvement of spec-
tral eﬃciency is expected. Of course, such spectral agility cannot be achieved
without developing new hardware/software and changing the current spec-
trum allocation policies. Fortunately, the advances in software deﬁned radio
(SDR) [40, 41] have enabled the development of ﬂexible and powerful radio
interfaces for supporting spectral agility. Also, the FCC’s ongoing review of

206
N. Sai Shankar
the current spectrum regulations is also expediting the adoption of more ﬂex-
ible spectrum allocation policies for spectral agility. We will show how future
open spectrum scenarios can be engineered with this approach to improve
spectrum eﬃciency and fairness in spectrum access.
7.4.1 Channel and Traﬃc Model
Assume a perfect knowledge of the channel. That is, a channel is either busy or
idle. It is also assumed that radio systems always detect radio resource alloca-
tions of other radio systems. The oﬀered traﬃc is modelled with two random
processes per radio system. The arrival traﬃc is modelled as a Poisson random
process with rate λi for radio system i, so the inter-arrival time is negative-
exponentially distributed with mean time
1
λi ms (1 ms = 1 millisecond). The
radio system access duration is also negative-exponentially distributed with
mean time
1
µi ms, so the departure of the radio system i is another Pois-
son random process with rate µi. And we assume that spectral scanning is
performed instantaneously, so there is no scanning delay.
7.4.2 Usage Model and Etiquette Deﬁnition
The 5 GHz unlicensed frequency band is a candidate for a large set of radio
services, and is one of the unlicensed frequency bands that may be eﬃciently
used only with an established spectrum etiquette. We use the same abstract
model of an unlicensed frequency band as in [38], as illustrated in Figure 7.10.
Here, two diﬀerent types of radio systems are assumed to operate in the
band, each operating with diﬀerent frequency channel bandwidths. The radio
systems of type A operate on three frequency channels (center frequencies
f2, f5, f8), the radio systems of type B operate on nine frequency channels
(center frequencies f1 . . . f9). The frequency channels overlap with each other,
as indicated in the ﬁgure. The number and bandwidth of the frequency chan-
nels in Figure 7.10 do not represent any existing unlicensed band, this usage
model serves without loss of generality only as an example model. Here, radio
system A can be compared to wireless LANs operating in the 5 GHz band

(using OFDM). Radio system B represents narrow-band radio systems sup-
porting for example a limited number of voice calls or blue tooth systems.
In our scenario instead of modelling the detailed protocols, a simpliﬁed Lis-
ten Before Talk (LBT) is used for all radio systems. A type A radio system
requires the respective three frequency channels to be idle before allocating
radio resources. Only if the respective channels are idle, a radio system allo-
cates radio resources, otherwise it will be dropped, i.e., there is no queuing.
The radio systems only scan their own frequencies, for example a radio system
B with center frequency f2 looks only in its frequency and not in any other
frequency. Collisions of allocation attempts occur when more than one radio
system detects the channel as idle at the same time. In simulations, when
collisions happen, one of the radio systems is randomly selected to allocate
the radio resource, the other radio systems are dropped.
Two of the most representative etiquette rules deﬁned in [38] are as follows:
• Rule ♯4: A radio system of type A or type B should apply LBT when
operating.
• Rule ♯6: In order to protect other radio systems most eﬃciently, a ra-
dio system B that follows rule ♯4 should synchronize its LBT process in
time across neighboring frequency channels that overlap with the same A
channels.
7.4.3 Markov Modelling
1) Equal traﬃc load without queuing: The unlicensed spectrum access
problem can be modelled as a continuous-time Markov chain (Figure 7.11).
Without loss of generality, we can model the two radio system access model
illustrated in Figure 7.10 as a ﬁve state Markov chain as shown in Figure 7.12.
The ﬁve states of the Markov chain are described in Table 7.1. The assumption
here is that for each type of the radio systems, we have the same traﬃc load
and occupation time. Later, we will relax this assumption and propose a more
general model. Since the contentions of the spectrum only take place between
radio systems A and B, we focus on one of the type A radio systems and
the three type B radio systems whose required spectrum is within the type A

Markov model we omit the collision state.
We deﬁne an inﬁnitesimal generator matrix A to characterize the tran-
sition of the states of the Markov chain. The inﬁnitesimal generator matrix
with the sum of each row equalling zero is given as follows:

One of the most important metrics in the unlicensed-band access is the average
airtime per radio system. Airtime refers to the ratio of allocation time per
radio system type to the reference time (say 1h) [38]:
airtimetype=A,B =
1
Ntype
Ntype

i=1
allocation time(i)

,
(7.22)
where Ntype is the number of type i radio systems. Based on the previous
Markov model, the airtime can be approximated by
airtimetypeA = ΠA,
airtimetypeB = 1
3Π1 + 2
3Π2 + Π3.
(7.23)
From the above equation we can see that when radio systems A and B are
given the same high traﬃc load, airtimetypeB ≫airtimetypeA which is not
fair for radio system A. As the traﬃc load of radio system B increases, the
airtimetypeA →0 which is unacceptable for the broader band radio system
A. Some etiquette rules were proposed in [38] to mitigate this unfairness, but
the improvements are limited.
2) Equal Traﬃc Load with Queuing: As queuing can increase the server
utilization and hence the throughput in classical queueing systems, we also
expect increase in terms of airtime share of these coexisting radio systems by
introducing waiting (queuing). With queuing, instead of dropping the radio
system when the channels are busy, they continue scanning until the chan-
nel(s) become idle. Of course, the tradeoﬀhere is between the waiting time and
the spectrum utilization. When there are more radio systems of the same type
than the available spectrum channels, collisions will be pronounced. In order
to decrease the probability of collisions, collision avoidance techniques should
be used, such as random back-oﬀ, or CSMA/CA. In this chapter, since our
focus is on the eﬀect of coexistence of dissimilar radio systems on unlicensed
frequency bands, a perfect collision avoidance among resource allocations is
assumed.
We again consider the model shown in Figure 7.10 with equal traﬃc load
within the same radio system. At this time, only if the respective channels
are idle, a radio system allocates radio resources, otherwise it continues to
scan until the channels become idle. The Markov model that characterizes
this scheme is illustrated in Figure 7.13. Here, each state is (k1, k2), where ki
equals the number of radio system i on the spectrum block. While kiw means

share by the general method described in Section 7.4.5.
3) Markov Model for General Traﬃc Load: The Markov chain shown in
Figure 7.13 models a more general case where within each radio system type,
there may exist diﬀerent traﬃc loads and occupation times. In Figure 7.13, a
state is represented by the triplet (n1, n2, n3). In this, n1, n2 and n3 represent
the status of the radio system of type B occupying carrier frequencies f1, f2
and f3, respectively. Here, ni = 0, i = 1, 2, 3 indicates that the radio system
of type B requiring carrier frequency fi is idling, while ni = 1, i = 1, 2, 3
indicates that it occupies the carrier frequency fi. State (1′, 1′, 1′) represents
radio system A occupies the three frequency channels.
Here, all the states are connected by straight lines that are bi-directional.
Let λ1, λ2, λ3 and µ1, µ2, µ3 represent the arrival rates and service rates of
the three type B systems whose center frequencies are f1, f2 and, f3 respec-
tively. Let λa and µa represent the arrival and service rates of type A system
respectively. The basic equation governing the above system is given by

where C is the normalizing constant. The inclusion of the state (1′, 1′, 1′) also
represents an M/M/1/1 queue that is independent of Pn1,n2,n3. For simplicity
and in order to get more insight into the analysis, we use the ﬁve state Markov
model (Figure 7.12) unless stated otherwise.
7.4.4 Random Access Model
Eﬃciency and fairness are obviously the main goals of a spectrum etiquette.
As discussed before, if every radio system accesses the unlicensed band in a
greedy manner, then the radio system requiring broader band to operate will
suﬀer from an unacceptable low airtime share. So one way to provision more
fairness to the etiquette rules would be to require each radio system to work
in a cooperative manner. One option would be that each radio system i tries
to contend for the spectrum with probability pi. After the radio system has
decided to contend for the spectrum, it accesses the spectrum compliant to
etiquette rule ♯4 described in Section 7.4.2.
This random access scheme can be approximated by slightly modifying the
previous ﬁve state Markov model. Here, each radio system will only contend
for the spectrum with probability pi, so the actual traﬃc load to the system
can be approximated by piλi. If perfect fairness is achieved then we have
airtimetypeA(pa, pb) = airtimetypeB(pa, pb).
(7.26)

212
N. Sai Shankar
Then from Equation 7.23, we have
pa(pb) = 1
3pbP1 + 2
3p2
bP2 + p3
bP3.
(7.27)
So
airtimetypeA(pb) =
1
3pbP1 + 2
3p2
bP2 + p3
bP3
P0 + 1
3pbP1 + 2
3p2
bP2 + p3
bP3 + pbP1 + p2
bP2 + p3
bP3
.
(7.28)
When the airtime for both radio systems A and B are the same, we can ﬁnd
the optimal pb by maximizing the airtime. Since
∂airtimetypeA
∂pb
> 0,
(7.29)
airtimetypeA is an increasing function of pb. So the optimal pb is the largest
possible pb. Depending on diﬀerent λ and µ values, we have the following two
cases:
• pa(pb = 1) > 1, we cannot use the maximum value of pb = 1 to maximize
the airtime function because of 0 < pa ≤1. But as pa(pb) is an increasing
function of pb, the maximum possible pbopt can be calculated when pa = 1
(which is the optimal value for pa) from Equation 7.27.
• pa(pb = 1) < 1, we can get the maximum value of pbopt = 1 and hence by
Equation 7.27 we can get paopt = pa(pb = 1).
Since
∂airtimetypeA(pa,pb)
∂pa
> 0,
∂airtimetypeA(pa,pb)
∂pb
< 0,
∂airtimetypeB (pa,pb)
∂pa
< 0
and
∂airtimetypeB (pa,pb)
∂pb
> 0, it can be shown that this (paopt, pbopt) pair
actually corresponds to the strategy that no radio systems can do better in
terms of airtime share without harming the other coexisting radio systems.
So in this sense, both the eﬃciency and fairness are obtained by using this
optimal probability pair.
7.4.5 General Solution to Airtime Share and Blocking Probability
In order to analyze more complex access process, we need to deal with Markov
chains with more states and more complex transition structures. Explicitly
solving the balance equations to get the airtime share or blocking proba-
bility then becomes untractable. Therefore, we introduce a simple numerical
technique described below to calculate the airtime shares and blocking prob-
abilities.
1) Airtime Share: Given the traﬃc rates and occupying time, we can deﬁne
an inﬁnitesimal generator matrix A as before. Then by solving the following
equation we can get the state probabilities.
ΠA = 0,
(7.30)

7 Eﬃciency and Coexistence Strategies for Cognitive Radio
213
where Π = [Π1, Π2, . . . , ΠK] and K is the number of states in the Markov
chain. The generator matrix A is singular so we cannot solve the state prob-
ability vector directly. But with the condition that the sum of all the steady
state probabilities should be one, we can put these two conditions into the
following compact equation:

AT
11×K
 
ΠT =

0K×1
1
 
.
(7.31)
Then by deﬁning A′ =

AT
11×K
 
, b =
0K×1
1
 
, we have,
A′Π = b.
(7.32)
By using minimum mean squared error (MMSE) criterion [43], we obtain the
following unique solution,
ΠT = (A′TA′)−1A′Tb.
(7.33)
After having the state probabilities, the airtimei share for radio system i is
just the weighed summation of the respective state probabilities.
2) Blocking Probability: Despite the fairness concerns, another important
metric wireless users care about is the instant access probability, or the block-
ing probability. Our model can be considered as a ﬁnite population queuing
model, where the time blocking which is the proportion of time the system
spends in the blocking states is not equal to the call blocking which is the
probability that an arriving call is blocked. So PASTA property does not ap-
ply here. Instead, we can compute the state probability seen by an arriving
call (radio system) as follows,
π∗
j =
λjπj
s
k=0 λkπk
,
(7.34)
where s+1 is the total number of states. Considering a long period of time T,
on the average the system spends in state j the time πjT. During this
time there are on the average λjπjT call arrivals which ﬁnd the system in
the state j. The total number of calls arriving in time T is on the average
T s
k=0 λkπk. Then the proportion of calls which ﬁnd the system in the state
j is as given by the above expression. When the random access probability is
pi the blocking probability experienced by the radio system i is
PBLKi = 1 −pi

7.4.6 Cognitive Radio Access
The proposed random access scheme makes it possible to achieve the desired
fairness in open spectrum access with diﬀerent types of radio systems. But
with the increasing number of such devices, reducing the blocking probability
and increasing the airtime share become a critical issue. Spectrum agility
based channel access helps this cause.
1) Physical Layer Aspects of Agile Radio: Traditionally, frequency division
has been adopted to divide the electromagnetic spectrum between diﬀerent
wireless technologies. In frequency division, portions of the spectrum are stati-
cally assigned to particular wireless technology to support their transmissions.
This assignment has some inherent disadvantages with respect to spectral eﬃ-
ciency. For example, consider two operators operating on their licensed bands
(i.e., exclusive use model). It is possible that the one wireless network oper-
ating in a particular frequency band is fully loaded, while the second may
have unused resources (or vice versa). It would be proﬁtable for both wire-
less network technologies, if these unused resources were shared to allow more
capacity for the fully loaded operator. This form of spectral sharing is much
easier to accomplish if the underlying access technique in the two operators is
multi-carrier-based. In case of a single operator, the operator can access the
spectrum opportunistically based on the load of the system.
In order to allow diﬀerent wireless technologies to borrow/lend spectral
bands from/to diﬀerent wireless networks residing in the same or diﬀerent
spectral region, we could conceive of a simple adhoc strategy for selecting ∆f
(the frequency separation among carriers in a OFDM based system design).
For example, two diﬀerent strategies to enable spectral sharing are:
1. Diﬀerent ∆f for diﬀerent regions
2. Common ∆f for all regions
In the ﬁrst strategy, diﬀerent values of ∆f are chosen for diﬀerent spectral
regions, based on the following practical considerations: 1. ∆f is selected much
smaller than the coherence bandwidth of the channel (to ensure that each
carrier undergoes a ﬂat fade). 2. ∆f is selected big enough to prevent the use
of large number of carriers (to allow practical implementation of the system via
FFT/IFFT). Therefore, we could choose values of ∆f that are proportional to
the carrier frequency. This choice allows the system to maintain the transceiver
complexity within reasonable levels. Speciﬁcally, we could have the following
sub-carrier spacing:
1. ∆f = 25 kHz for the low band region
2. ∆f = 100 kHz for the medium band region
3. ∆f = 500 kHz for the high band region
These choices were made based on coherence bandwidth measurements for a
typical indoor small oﬃce channels.

In the second strategy, we suggest the use of the same carrier separation
(e.g., ∆f = 25 kHz) across all regions. Even though this strategy facilitates
orthogonal sharing across the entire bandwidth, it results in prohibitive com-
plexity in IFFT/FFT implementation. For example, choosing ∆f = 25 kHz
for a 1 GHz service in region 3 requires a 40, 000-point IFFT. This can be
chosen based on the current UWB standards. Figure 7.14 shows how the
multi-carrier OFDM is used for agile radios.
2) MAC Layer Aspect of Agile Radio: With the advances in software de-
ﬁned radio, spectral-agile networks become more and more tractable. Such
radio devices can dynamically utilize idle spectrum bands. One of the in-
teresting concerns here is, given the additional freedom of carrier frequency
switching, what is the gain in eﬃciency for radio systems with diﬀerent band-
width requirements. There are lots of ways to take advantage of this switching.
To achieve the upper-bound for the agile spectrum eﬃciency, one way is to
“pack” all the radio systems tightly together in the spectral domain. Such a
packing would ensure that there is no spectral hole/white space.
We describe the “packing” behavior as follows. If one radio system releases
the spectrum, the other radio systems will switch their operating frequency
band so that the vacant band is occupied (if it meets the demands of at
least one of the active radio systems). Then a new accessing radio system
scans to ﬁnd spectrum opportunities from the beginning of the spectral band,
and occupies the ﬁrst idle spectrum opportunity it ﬁnds. In this way, all the
spectrum fragments can be saved for future accessing radio systems. A simple
example given in Figure 7.15 explains this process clearly, where when radio
system B2 releases the spectrum, radio system B4 (also could be B3) then
switches to frequency f5. When a new accessing radio system A2 scans the
spectrum, it will occupy frequency f7, f8 and f9. Without this spectral agility,
it will have to queue or be dropped.

All the switching and scanning may introduce considerable signaling over-
head and delay. To alleviate this, in practical schemes, we can divide the
spectrum into blocks, and implement this packing in each blocks. This can
considerably save the switching and scanning. Besides, software radios work
very well with short scanning range.
Without loss of generality, we still use the basic scenario discussed before
in Figure 7.10 to illustrate this scheme, and compare it with the other schemes.
The most signiﬁcant diﬀerence for this scheme is that each radio system here is
an agile radio system. And it behaves in the “packing” way. The corresponding
Markov model is shown in Figure 7.16. Here, each state Πj = (k1, k2), where
ki equals the number of radio system i on the spectrum block. We can solve
for the airtime share and the blocking probability by the general method
described previously.

7.4.7 The Homo Egualis (HE) Society Model Based Access
Scheme
To obtain (paopt, pbopt) we need the information of all the λ’s and µ’s which
is impractical in a real access scenario. A more realistic scheme would be to
allow the radio systems to learn these pa and pb themselves with only local
information or measurement. We present such a technique next.
7.4.8 The Agent Egualis Society
In many decision-making and strategy-setting people do not behave like the
self-interested “rational” actor depicted in neoclassical economics and classi-
cal game theory [39]. In a Homo egualis society, individuals have an inequality
aversion. As a result altruists appear in ultimatum and public good games. As
Gintis states in [39] support for Homo egualis comes from the anthropolog-
ical literature, describing how Homo sapiens evolved in small hunter-gather
groups. Such societies had no centralized structure of governance, so the en-
forcement of norms depends on the voluntary participation of peers. A Homo
egualis society [39] can be modelled as follows, where the utility function of
player i, ui in an n-player game is:
ui = xi −
αi
n −1

xj>xi
(xj −xi) −
βi
n −1

xj<xi
(xi −xj),
(7.36)
where x = (xi, . . . , xj) are the pay-oﬀs for each payer and 0 ≤βi < αi ≤1.
βi < αi reﬂects the fact that Homo egualis exhibits a weak urge to inequality
when doing better than the others and a strong urge to reduce inequality
when doing worse than the others. In [39] it is shown that in this model the
salient behaviors in ultimatum and public goods games, where fairness does
matter, can be reproduced.
1) The Proposed Homo Egualis Based Access Scheme: The inequality aver-
sion property of the Homo Egualis agents can be utilized to achieve fairness
in the spectrum access problem. In this scheme each radio system learns the
access probability pi by itself. Here, we deﬁne Onlinetimei as the averaged
cumulative “on” spectrum time per radio system of type i. Then we deﬁne
xi = Onlinetimei
Li
, where Li is a parameter proportional to the traﬃc load of
radio system type i. The cumulative Onlinetimei is normalized by the ra-
dio system’s traﬃc load, which makes this spectrum access scheme able to
adapt to diﬀerent traﬃc loads and hence achieve more eﬃciency and main-
tain fairness. With initial pi = 1, each time the probability pi is updated as
follows,

where n is the number of diﬀerent radio system types, 0 < βi < αi reﬂects
the fact that radio system exhibits a weak urge to inequality when doing
better than others and a strong urge to reduce inequality when doing worse
than the others. This forces each radio system to make an eﬀort to eﬃciently
use the idle spectrum while taking fairness into consideration. Here, the only
local information needed is the radio system’s own history of the Onlinetime
and the Onlinetime of the other radio systems whose spectrum is within the
same spectrum block. This can be obtained by keeping a record of the busy
time of the required spectrum, which can be obtained by periodical spectrum
scanning. When there are more than two diﬀerent radio systems trying to
coexist in the same spectrum, diﬀerent radio systems can be identiﬁed by
some smart technologies (e.g., we can detect the diﬀerent transmitting power
levels to distinguish from diﬀerent radio systems). So each radio system can
access the spectrum based only on its own recorded history and the local
measurements performed by itself. While Li can be estimated by historical
usage records of radio system type i.
7.5 Numerical Results
We describe the simulation results in this section and compare it with the the-
oretical analysis. Equal loads on the radio systems are assumed. Figure 7.17
shows the simulated average airtime per radio system and the theoretical
results obtained from the Markov model in Figure 7.12. We see that the pro-
posed Markov model ﬁts the simulation results very well. Here, radio systems
are blocked when there are no idle frequency bands, and each radio system’s
carrier frequency is ﬁxed. Radio systems only scan their own ﬁxed frequency
for spectrum opportunities. As one can imagine, it is seen here that with
only Rule♯4 (LBT), the narrow bandwidth radio system B will dominate the
airtime share over the broad-band radio system A. This dominance empha-
sizes the issue of unfairness, which is a prominent problem in coexistence of
diﬀerent types of radio systems.
The proposed HE based random access scheme can mitigate this dramati-
cally, as illustrated in Figure 7.18. The theoretical airtime share for radio sys-
tems A and B are the same when optimal access probability pair (paopt, pbopt)
is used, and both of them increase with the increase of the traﬃc load. The HE
access scheme using only local information is observed to produce a close to
optimal solution. The HE access scheme is observed to produce a performance

gain even higher than the optimal achievable solution using (paopt, pbopt) as
seen in Figure 7.18 for some traﬃc load. This is not surprising, because in the
HE access, the pa and pb values change during the access, while the optimal
probability solution pair (paopt, pbopt) is obtained with the assumption that
both of them will remain unchanged throughout the access. So when using
the HE access in a real system, it may sometimes perform better than the
predicted optimal results from the proposed Markov model solution of the
random access scheme. Of course, for some instances, it may produce lower
performance than the optimal solution as seen later.
The etiquette Rule♯6 can protect the broad-band radio system A by re-
quiring a radio system of type B that follows Rule♯4 to synchronize its LBT
process in time across neighboring frequency channels that overlap with the
same reference channel [38]. But as can be seen in Figure 7.19, although the
airtime share for radio system A increases, the cost is a signiﬁcant decrease
of airtime share for radio system B. The HE based access is seen to be much
better in terms of fairness compared to the etiquette Rule♯6.
When each radio system is allowed to wait(queue) instead of being dropped
if the desired frequency band is busy, the eﬃciency of the spectrum usage is
expected to increase as illustrated in Figure 7.20, where only LBT etiquette is
used. The theoretical result is derived from the Markov model in Figure 7.21.

Fig. 7.22. Proposed HE access scheme compared with theoretical optimal solution
in terms of airtime. Queuing of radio systems case.
With waiting, as can be seen, the airtime share for the broad-band radio
system A almost doubled while it increased a little bit for radio system B.
Therefore, the total utilization of the spectrum increases. The tradeoﬀhere is
the delay due to waiting, which is shown in Figure 7.21. The total waiting time
is normalized to the reference time. And further, when there are more radio
systems, collisions will be prominent and a sophisticated collision avoidance
scheme is required. Figure 7.22 shows that the HE access scheme works well for
this case as well. Comparing Figures 7.22 and 7.18, we can see that when using
HE with waiting, the radio systems’ airtime share increases signiﬁcantly.
Agile radio systems can potentially increase the spectrum eﬃciency signif-
icantly as illustrated in Figure 7.23. When radio systems have the ability to
switch their carrier frequency, they can pack themselves together in the spec-
tral domain and hence will increase the overall airtime share. This agility can
as well decrease the blocking probability experienced by the radio systems
as seen in Figure 7.24. In Figure 7.24, the HE access scheme will experience
higher blocking probability than the expected theoretical prediction especially
at low traﬃc load. This phenomena can be explained by the same reason as
mentioned before, which is because the pa and pb change during the access
when using HE. So, when the traﬃc load is low, the optimal access probabil-
ities are 1, but this may not be so when using HE. They may be lower than
1 for some time, which will result in a higher blocking probability as can be

calculated through (7.35). Here, the theoretical solution is derived using the
Markov model given in Figure 7.16.
Figures 7.25 and 7.26 show that the HE scheme can also work well when
there are multiple diﬀerent types of radio systems. Here, we considered three
diﬀerent types of agile radio systems. Radio systems A and B are the same
as before, while radio system C represents radio system that uses broad-band
transmission schemes such as UWB or spread spectrum. It requires even the
whole spectrum (all nine spectrum bands) to be idle before allocating ra-
dio resources in the scenario discussed in Figure 7.10. It can be seen from
Figure 7.25 that all these diﬀerent radio systems almost have the same air-
time share, which is what is desired for fairness. The theoretical solution is
obtained from the Markov model described in Figure 7.16 by adding one more
state for radio system C. Due to the same reason of the changing of access
probabilities pa, pb and pc in HE, the HE access scheme is observed to pro-
duce a performance gain higher than the optimal theoretical solution both in
airtime share and the blocking probability in this case.
α and β are two important control parameters in the HE access scheme.
Therefore, it is important to study the inﬂuence of α and β to the HE scheme.
We ﬁnd that when one of the radio systems uses α < β, both of them will
experience much lower airtime share, while as long as all of them use α > β,
they will almost get the same airtime performance no matter what speciﬁc
α and β values they are using. Figure 7.27 illustrates one case when both

of the radio systems use α = 0.01 < β = 0.1 compared with both of them
use α = 0.1 > β = 0.01. It can be seen that when α is smaller than β, the
performance for both of the two radio systems degrades signiﬁcantly.
7.6 Channel Opportunity Study and the Optimal
Sensing Protocol
So far, we analyze the performance of cognitive radios with respect to their
eﬃciency as well as coexistence. Assuming that the sensing problem is solved
we want the secondary user to decide whether an accessible channel is a good
opportunity based on channel sensing statistics. In particular, a secondary
user prefers a channel where it can ﬁnish the transmission before the primary
users return. Determining whether the channel is idle or not poses a serious
challenge, particularly in the context of available estimation and detection
algorithms, in the design of agile radio, but there have been studies indicating
the use of sensors whose prime function is to update a central server. A agile
radio uses its position and accesses this central server to determine if the
particular channel is idle or not. Whether sensors are used or not, the following
simple algorithm is useful in estimating the white spaces of the spectrum [1].
The secondary wireless network would determine that a particular channel
is an opportunity if it can ﬁnd an idle time in that channel that is greater than
Topp. Topp is the requirement in time and stems from the applications running
in the secondary wireless network such as video, audio, data, etc. In order
to use a particular primary channel whose idle times are greater than Topp,
we need a sensing protocol that would determine if the particular channel
is an opportunity or not. The occupancy in a particular channel is deﬁned
as the probability that the physical layer signatures of the current primaries
are present. Using simple correlation or feature detection techniques one can
easily determine the presence of the primary. Let us now consider important
aspects in designing a sensing protocol. A secondary wireless network has a
requirement in terms of time or bandwidth (bits/s) when it is looking for
opportunities or white spaces in the spectrum to transmit its data. If the
bandwidth requirement is in bits/s, it is translated to a time requirement
based on the physical transmission rate that the wireless system is currently
using.
As indicated above, let a secondary wireless system looks for a spectral
opportunity equal to Topp. This is diﬀerent from the channel occupancy, Ton,
of the primary. The channel occupancy represents the actual occupancy of the
channel by the primary. A secondary wireless network occupies that particular
channel if and only if it determines that channel is a spectral opportunity
which is given by the following equation:
Toff ≥αTopp,
α > 1.
(7.38)

7 Eﬃciency and Coexistence Strategies for Cognitive Radio
227
Toff in the above equation represents the time that a particular channel is
not occupied by the primary. The intuition behind Equation (7.38) is to re-
duce the probability of collision with the primary. α is a design parameter
and smaller values of α make the probability of collision with the primary
higher. Reducing the collision probability has a negative eﬀect of lowering the
spectrum utilization. This would mean that the secondary wireless network is
very conservative in determining that the channel is an opportunity. On the
other hand, a non-conservative approach would increase the chance of collid-
ing with primary. So one needs to choose α in optimal way that maximizes
the spectrum utilization for a given probability of collision. Currently all pri-
mary channels have their value of α = ∞implying that the secondary wireless
network cannot access this channel. The value of α is chosen to be 2 in this
chapter for simplicity. It should be noted that designing the right value of α
is out of scope of this chapter.
Once the sampling rate is determined, the secondary wireless network
senses that channel and collects information about that channel. The results of
the sampling are updated in the database maintained by the individual station
or the central controller, such as access point or base station, for possible
switching in the future. The initial requirement of sampling requirement comes
from the secondary wireless network applications that require an opportunity
of Topp. Initially it is ﬁxed at:
Tsample = Topp
2 .
(7.39)
Tsample represents the sampling interval and this will determine if the channel
is a spectral opportunity for this secondary wireless network. This sampling
interval is also called as the Nyquist opportunity determination rate as this
represents the maximum rate that will be used by the secondary wireless net-
work to determine the availability of the channel. This rate can construct the
original occupancy of the channel if that channel has E[Toff] = Topp. This
sampling rate may not be optimal, as it may spend more time in sampling
the spectral opportunity for this particular channel thus increasing the over-
heads arising from sampling this channel and thereby increasing the power
consumption.
We outline a technique to ﬁnd the optimal sampling frequency. Let Xt be
a stochastic process denoting whether the channel is occupied or not at time t.
Xt represents the indicator random variable. Then the fraction of time the
channel is busy in an interval [0, τ] is given by
Oτ = 1
τ
τ
!
0
Xt dt.
(7.40)
Oτ is actual occupancy of the channel that was currently sensed and is a
random process whose realizations are diﬀerent at diﬀerent instants of time.

228
N. Sai Shankar
The above equation represents the continuous process. As mentioned we will
be sampling the channel for regular interval given by Tsample whose optimal
value has to be determined. Based on the sampled process, the best prediction
of the channel occupancy is given by
ˆOτ = 1
n
n

i=1
XiTsample.
(7.41)
Here, n =
1
Tsample . Under continuity conditions of the process Xt, the process
ˆOτ →Oτ as Tsample →0. This would mean that the secondary wireless
network is continuously sensing a particular channel and so the measure-
ment results would yield the occupancy and availability times exactly. From
XiTsample collected over the entire measure interval, one can easily determine
the E[Ton] and E[Toff] of the channel by noting the number of consecutive
ones and zeros and looking into the transitions from 0s to 1s and vice versa.
One of the most important goals is to verify reliability of the sampling process
by determining the variance of the estimator. The variance of the sampled
process, ˆOτ, is given by
V ar{ ˆOτ} = V ar


1≤i,j≤n
Cov(XiTsample,XjTsample).
(7.42)
If Tsample is small compared to the expected ON-period, E[Ton], of the chan-
nel, the measurements will be dependent. Hence one needs to determine the
oﬀdiagonal elements of the covariance matrix. If the process were stationary,
one can replace the Cov(XiTsample, XjTsample) by a function f with one argu-
ment that is given by the diﬀerence in time between (XjTsample −XiTsample).
Thus, we can rewrite Equation (7.42) as
V ar

ˆOτ



1≤i,j≤n
f((i −j)Tsample).
(7.43)
If the duration Tsample is not zero and has very large value, the variance of the
measurement will be maximum and is equal to ρ(1 −ρ), where ρ represents
the occupancy utilization of the channel by the primary.
Now to determine the optimal sampling interval once the mean’s of ON,
OFF and the variance of the OFF-periods are determined is to double the
sampling interval until the measured variance of the newly measured variance
is greater than the original variance using the Nyquist rate by certain bound.
The bound is also dependent on how far the mean ON- and OFF-periods vary
from the true ON- and OFF-period that was determined by the initial sam-
pling interval. The above new sampling periods obtained from Equation 7.39

7 Eﬃciency and Coexistence Strategies for Cognitive Radio

may not be optimal in terms of resource power utilizations. Hence, determina-
tion of the optimal number of sampling points is mandatory that characterizes
the ON- and OFF-periods eﬃciently while conserving the wireless resources.
Having obtained the mean and variance of the ON- and OFF-periods using
Tsample, we will determine the optimal number of samples that are required
to capture the characteristics of the channel. From the central limit theorem
of random samples [3], we know that as the sample size is large with the
number of samples, n →∞, the average of the sampled data approaches the
original mean regardless of the distribution. This is expressed by the following
equation:
P

(7.44)
In the above equation, ϵ and η are the design parameters and µ and σ denote
the sample mean and sample standard deviation using Tsample as the sample
duration. From Equation 7.44, we can easily calculate the optimal number of
samples and this is given by
n ≥noptimal =

(7.45)
Figure 7.28 shows the optimal number of samples required using the ap-
proximation of the above equation. It is clear that the number of samples
required to estimate the channel occupancy increases if the channel avail-
ability is very small and decreases as this time increases. The plot is for the
exponential channel availability time and can be done for diﬀerent distribu-
tions that have the second moment. In this numerical analysis, the value of η
was set to 0.01.
7.6.1 Implementation of the Sampling Function
in Practical Networks
Consider the case of infrastructure networks, wherein the Access Point (AP)
or Base Station (BS) is the central controller that is responsible for the wireless
resources. The AP/BS initiates a measurement request to the clients who in
turn measure a particular channel and report the activity to the access point.
The secondary wireless network ﬁrst tunes to a particular channel and will
listen to the channel for 1 s to calculate the mean ON- and OFF-periods of
the channel. In a distributed Adhoc network, this sensing is periodic for a
channel and may happen once in every few minutes. All devices agree upon
the periodicity and sense the channel. It may turn out that they may dedicate
users who take turns to sense a particular channel for the 1 s period. In case
of infrastructure networks, the central controller may dedicate some wireless
devices to periodically visit the channel to collect the information that is then

updated in its database. After determining the mean ON- and OFF-periods
of the channel it will then use Equation 7.45 to sample that channel for a
duration of Tduration. In the existing protocols like IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.16
and IEEE 802.15, the AP/BS collectively chooses a channel and scans the
channel for information for 1 s and then estimate the mean ON- and OFF-
periods ﬁrst. Then it will scan the channel at the optimal sampling rate using
the estimated mean and variance by disseminating the optimal n to all the
individual wireless stations. The other way is to disseminate the n/x instead
of n. Here, x represents the number of clients associated with that AP/BS.
Since the value of n is obtained based on the characteristics of the particular
channel it represents the sampling rate of a particular channel in order to
reconstruct the occupancy properties of that channel. Hence distributing the
new sampling frequency improves the radio resource usage resulting in more
data traﬃc transmissions. In the case of Adhoc networks, there is complexity
on the individual clients to calculate the value n and a dissemination protocol
has to be designed that will propagate this information so that wireless clients
can use radio resources eﬃciently.

7.7 Conclusion
In this chapter we model the eﬃciency of the cognitive radios from the Medium
Access Control (MAC) analytically and study the improvement that cognitive
radios can get compared to conventional radios. Then we consider the eﬀect of
peaceful coexistence with diﬀerent types of cognitive radios and also consider
a simple spectrum sensing protocol which is a function of the primary uti-
lization and required opportunity. It is clear that from our initial analysis we
have proved that there is immense beneﬁt of cognitive radio compared to con-
ventional radios and lots of newer research are required before this becomes
a reality in shaping the lives of mankind.

7.8.1 Calculation of Multiplexing Gain
But looking at how the system evolves, we get a good approximate solution.
Assume that there is one M/G/1 queue with preemptive priority as before.
The server capacity is constant with mean EX = µ and second moment
at EX2. We will now show how this M/G/1 queue with preemption will
model 7.8a. This arrivals to this queue capture the SARA network arrivals
into the system with N channels. Since the SARA network will get a maximum
capacity determined by one channel’s capacity, the service rate of the above
queue is ﬁxed to µ which is generally distributed. The arrival rate into the
queue is modelled by bulk arrivals. The arrival rate is poisson with rate λ
but with probability gk we have k simultaneous arrivals into the M/G/1
queue. What does gk model here. To understand the role of gk = P(G = k),
we need to focus on the arrivals of SARA networks. SARA networks arrive
to the queue with Poisson rate λ. The number of networks arriving into this
queue depends on the channels being occupied by the primary. We consider M
SARA networks trying to use N channels. Consider the ﬁrst case of M < N.
Choose an arbitrary instant when all channels are not occupied by primaries.
So all M networks get their own channels. Now, consider the case where only
M −1 channels are available. Then we will have the two arrivals to our M/G/1
system. If ⌈M
2 ⌉−1 channels are only available, then we have three arrivals in
our M/G/1 queue. Proceeding similarly we can evaluate the probability gM
where all the SARA networks occupy the last available channel. This M/G/1
queue with preemption can be preempted if all the channels are occupied
by primaries and so rate of preemption and the service time of the preemptive
primary is the blocking time for the SARA network and is the same as in the
previous section. The arrival rate into the queue is given by

Here, E(G) = M
k=1 kgk. Two cases are considered with the ﬁrst being M < N
and the second being M > N. The following equation represents the rate of
arrival of SARA networks into the queue when M < N.

gi = r⌈M/(i−1)⌉−1, ⌈M/(i −1)⌉−1 > 2.
(7.47)
The above equation becomes gM if ⌈M/(i −1)⌉= 2.
If M > N then all poisson arrival instants have atleast two SARA network
arrivals into our M/G/1 queue. The size of M is going to play a role in
determining the values of gk. The minimum value of the subscript k in gk is
given by k = ⌈M
N ⌉. The relationship of gk to rk is given by
g⌈
M
N−i ⌉= rN−i.
(7.48)
We use the above gk to get the arrival rate as before by computing E(G).

Wireless communications is established through a common medium which is
highly dynamic. The elements of wireless communications systems such as
nodes in a network, users, and some properties of the wireless devices them-
selves (e.g. battery) are dynamic as well. In order for wireless communications
systems to better perform, adaptation to these dynamic conditions and ele-
ments is essential. How well a wireless system adapts to these dynamic con-
ditions depends on the amount of the knowledge of varying parameters. It is
clear that the more the knowledge, the better the adaptation.
Recently, wireless communication community meets a new concept called
“cognitive radio,” which is a radio that can sense, be aware of, learn, and
adapt to its surrounding environment [3]. Built on the top of Software Deﬁned
Radio (SDR), cognitive radio can adapt the radio parameters with the aid of a
special structure called cognitive engine. Cognitive engine can be regarded as
the counterpart of human brain in human body, since the brain is the center
for intelligence, as described in Chapter 14 with the same analogy.
Cognitive radio is expected to push the concept of adaptation further with
the aid of its advanced attributes. The main reason behind this expectation is
the fact that cognitive radio is equipped with extended sensing capabilities in
addition to Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) sort of tools that are kept in cognitive
engine.
In this chapter, we will discuss how cognitive radio can sense and be aware
of major factors that aﬀect its communications. First, we will address sensing
and being aware of the wireless channel. Next, we will take network related
awareness issues into consideration. In the following, we will discourse user rel-
evant topics along with other possible measurements. Finally, we will address
some major challenges and explain future research directions pertinent to the
realization of cognitive radio.

8.2 Wireless Channel Awareness
This section discusses prominent wireless channel characteristics, relevant ob-
servable quantities, and some methods to measure them.
8.2.1 Channel Selectivity
Before introducing the channel selectivity in detail, it is appropriate to explain
what selectivity means. Selectivity is a measure of how diﬀerently a channel
behaves over the dimension in which the selectivity is deﬁned. Measuring the
selectivity is established by channel coherence, which is statistically deﬁned,
again, over the same dimension in which the selectivity is measured [8]. More
formally, channel coherence over a dimension is the width of the window over
which the signal is assumed as invariant. The less the width of the window, the
more the selectivity on the dimension of interest. For instance, time selective
channel basically means that at time instants that are close to each other,
the correlation between the components of the channel is weak. Therefore,
the width of the time window (in this case, the duration of the window)
formally determines time selectivity. Similar concepts can be deduced by just
replacing the dimension with the desired one, such as frequency selectivity and
coherence bandwidth; space selectivity and coherence distance. An illustration
of the concept of selectivity and coherence is shown in Figure 8.1.

The width of the window for C1 is the narrowest one, whereas that of C3 is the
widest. Thus, for the dimension of interest, the selectivity of C1 is more than that
of C2 and the selectivity of C2 is more than that of C3.

Duality
In this context, it is appropriate to mention a very important notion called
duality. Fourier1 transform (F{·}) and its inverse (F−1{·}) allow one to see
time and frequency domain interpretations of the functions as dual of each
other. For functions of deterministic type, with the aid of F{·} (and F−1{·}),
it can be shown that if the width (in time domain, “width” refers to “dura-
tion,” whereas in frequency domain it refers to “bandwidth”) of the function
in one domain expands, it shrinks in the dual domain. However, the signals
are of stochastic type in wireless communications. Therefore, it is better to
investigate the duality in terms of stochastic processes. It is known that, a
stochastic process that is deﬁned in one domain automatically has a dual sto-
chastic process in the dual domain with the aid of, again, F{·} or F−1{·} [4].
In order to ease the mathematical tractability, in wireless communications,
often, signals are assumed as Wide-Sense Stationary (WSS).
In order to see the connection between selectivity, coherence, and duality,
stochastic linear time-varying wireless channels with WSS properties can be
considered. If the autocorrelation function of a channel is calculated over one
of the three domains (time, frequency, or space), the transform domain can
easily be obtained with the aid of Wiener–Khintchine Theorem. A channel
that spreads over the transform domain corresponds to a shrinkage in the
autocorrelation function because of the duality. Statistically, the shrinkage of
the autocorrelation function of a channel implies the decrease of coherence
and the increase of selectivity. As can be seen, when selectivity occurs in a
domain, the spreading is observed in its dual domain and vice versa. In wireless
communications community, the dual domain, namely “spreading” domain, is
labeled with its cause. Consider the selectivity in time. Since the dual of time
is frequency because of F{·}, spreading occurs in the dual domain, namely
in frequency. Spreading in frequency is caused by Doppler eﬀect, therefore,
selectivity in time corresponds to Doppler spread in frequency. Conversely,
selectivity in frequency has its dual in time as a spreading signal. Spreading
in time is caused by the delays between multipaths. Therefore, selectivity in
frequency corresponds to “delay spread.” Duality can be deﬁned over space
dimension as well. However, for this case, the space is transformed into a
domain called “wavevector” and vice versa.
1 Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier, the French mathematician and physicist who was
born on March 21, 1768, in Auxerre, France and died on May 16, 1830, in Paris,
France. The representation of functions through sum of trigonometric series has
been named after him [3], although [3] caused plenty of controversies. Later on,
Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, who was born on February 13, 1805, in
D¨uren, and died on May 5, 1859, in G¨ottingen, contributed to the Fourier’s theory
by appending the convergence conditions, which are known as “Dirichlet [Fourier
Series] conditions.”

Frequency Selectivity
When electromagnetic waves are released into a physical medium, multiple
replicas of the original waves arrive at the destination (or receiver) because of
the objects within the environment. The replicas arrive at the receiver with
diﬀerent delays, amplitudes, and phases, which is known as “multipath eﬀect.”
Depending on the relative distances of the objects that reﬂect/scatter/refract
the electromagnetic waves to the receiver, the replicas spread in time and lead
to some important consequences:
1. If the relative delays between multipaths are shorter than (or on the order
of) the symbol duration of the transmitted signal, the receiver cannot
resolve each separate multipath, therefore, it sees the superposition of the
multipaths, which causes a randomly fading channel.
2. If the relative delays of multipaths exceed the symbol duration, the sym-
bols previously transmitted will impinge on other symbols causing Inter-
Symbol Interference (ISI). ISI is sometimes described by the analogy of
“channel memory,” since the channel remembers the previous symbols
even in the presence of the new symbols.
Having the knowledge of frequency selectivity provides extremely impor-
tant performance improvement to the adaptive wireless communication sys-
tems including cognitive radio. As a sample application, adaptive channel
equalization in single carrier systems can be considered. For example, in
Global System for Mobile communications (GSM), channel equalizers are em-
ployed to compensate for ISI. However, the number of channel taps needed for
equalization might vary depending on the dispersion of the channel. Instead
of ﬁxing the number of channel taps for the worst-case channel condition, it
can be changed adaptively, allowing simpler receivers with reduced battery
consumption and improved performance [8].
Frequency selectivity carries slightly more importance for Orthogonal Fre-
quency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems compared to single carrier
systems. Even though the symbol duration is prolonged because of the use of
multiple orthogonal carriers, there is still partial ISI due to the multipath ef-
fect. Therefore, a certain amount of data, which is called Cyclic Preﬁx (CP), is
replicated and added in front of the OFDM symbols to be able to alleviate ISI
degradation. Considering the fact that the multipath eﬀect is highly environ-
ment dependent, the width of CP is chosen in such a way that it is larger than
the maximum excess delay of the channel for the environment in which the
wireless system operates.2 However, alleviating ISI comes at the expense of
reducing the spectral eﬃciency, since a certain amount of the data is repeated.
2 Since the width of CP is determined by the maximum excess delay of the channel,
the maximum excess delay of the channel must be estimated. As a rule of thumb,
the maximum excess delay of the channel is computed by multiplying Root-Mean-
Squared (RMS) delay spread of that environment by four [5].

239
Instead of choosing a CP for the worst-case multipath delay spread condition,
the size of CP can be adjusted adaptively. Using adaptive CP size increases
the spectral eﬃciency.
Channel selectivity information can be estimated directly from the received
signal and/or from channel estimates that are obtained after processing the
received signal. However, some other opportunities in estimating the time dis-
persion of the wireless channel emerge through the use of additional sensing
capabilities of cognitive radio. Since time dispersion is highly environment
dependent, any tool that can provide cognitive radio with information about
the environment plays a crucial role in estimating the selectivity of the chan-
nel. For instance, in an indoor environment, it is very likely that the RMS
delay spread of the channel is considerably lower than that in a typical outdoor
environment [6]. Beside the components that can provide absolute location in-
formation such as Global Positioning System (GPS), the peripherals such as
light and temperature sensors might be used to characterize whether cogni-
tive radio is in an indoor or outdoor environment [3]. When cognitive radio is
in an outdoor environment, a more descriptive sub-class of the environment3
can be identiﬁed via diﬀerent enabling technologies. For outdoor cases, there
are enabling technologies for obtaining the topographical (geomorphological)
information about the environment such as Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)
and recently becoming popular one, Geographical Information System (GIS).
These digital tools allow one to analyze the spatial information. Therefore,
these sorts of tools might be very helpful for cognitive radio to comprehend
the surrounding environment in terms of its topographical characteristics.
Table 8.1 presents some of the techniques that have been proposed for esti-
mating the frequency selectivity of the channel along with new ones that can
be used by cognitive radio for the same purpose.
Time Selectivity
When there is a relative motion between transmitter and receiver, a physi-
cal phenomenon called Doppler eﬀect4 occurs. The observed frequency of the
3 In European Co-operation in the ﬁeld of Scientiﬁc and Technical research (COST)
231, there are four forms for four diﬀerent environmental classes: Typical urban,
bad urban, rural, and hilly terrain [7]. These four types have already been de-
ﬁned in its predecessor, COST 207 for GSM. The Power Delay Proﬁles (PDPs) of
typical urban and rural environments are described via single exponential cluster
with diﬀerent parameters, whereas those of in hilly terrain and bad urban environ-
ments are described by two exponential clusters with diﬀerent parameters. Main
parameter diﬀerences between environments that have common cluster structure
are the arrival times of the clusters.
4 This phenomenon has been named in the honor of Austrian mathematician and
physicist Johann Christian Andreas Doppler who was born on November 29, 1803,
in Salzburg, Austria and died on March 17, 1853, in Venice, upon his discovery [8]
in 1842.

transmitted signal5 at the receiver is shifted because of Doppler eﬀect. In
wireless communications, Doppler eﬀect describes the time-varying nature of
a wireless channel. Generally, impulse response of a wireless channel varies in
time rapidly because of the relative motion in the channel. These rapid vari-
ations in time cause spectral broadening, which is called “Doppler spread.”
However, impact of the broadening depends on the bandwidth of the trans-
mitted signal. Under the same conditions, the signals that have wider trans-
mission bandwidths are aﬀected less by this broadening compared to those
which have narrower bandwidths. In accordance with earlier discussion about
duality, it is concluded that the increase in bandwidth of the transmitted sig-
nal corresponds to a shorter symbol duration in which the variation of the
channel in time becomes negligible.
Doppler spread information can be very useful in various wireless system
improvements. The applications can be investigated from two perspectives:
(a) transmitter/receiver improvements and (b) network improvements. For
(a), practical channel estimation methods can be examined. Whether channel
interpolators or channel trackers are used, contemporary channel estimation
algorithms are designed to operate on the worst case Doppler spread value.
It is clear that in case of having the Doppler spread information in hand, the
parameters of the channel estimation algorithms can be adjusted adaptively
rather than adopting a ﬁxed scheme [8, 10]. Variable coding and interleav-
ing schemes can also be employed depending on this information, which is
directly related to the speed of the mobile [11]. For (b), the use of Doppler
spread information in controlling some network algorithms can be considered.
5 The application of Doppler eﬀect to the light, which is a sort of electromagnetic
wave, was established by the French physicist Armand Hippolyte Louis Fizeau
(1819–1896) in 1848 independent of Ernst Mach (1838–1916), who also discovered
the same shift in 1860. The eﬀect was ﬁrst used in calculating the relative speed
of the stars by William Huggins [9].

241
For instance, in cellular systems, hand-oﬀ(or handover), cell assignment, and
channel allocation can be established eﬃciently having the Doppler spread es-
timate [12]. Assignment of fast-moving mobiles to umbrella cells in hierarchical
cell structures can be considered as a speciﬁc application. The assignment of
fast-moving mobiles to umbrella cells reduces the number of hand-oﬀs, whereas
the assignment of slow-moving mobiles to microcells increases the capacity [8].
There are several approaches to estimate Doppler spread. Examining
the variation and autocorrelation of channel estimates are two fundamen-
tal methods in measuring the Doppler spread. Instead of channel estimates,
the envelope of the signal can also be used [13]. When the channel estimates
are of interest, the variation is calculated by diﬀerentials. However, the re-
sults obtained after diﬀerentials are generally noisy and low-pass ﬁltering
is required for smoothing. The bandwidth of the low-pass ﬁlter depends on
Doppler spread too. Therefore, in essence, this method relies on changing the
bandwidth of the ﬁlter adaptively. Apart from variation of the channel esti-
mates, the autocorrelation of the channel estimates can be used in Doppler
spread estimation as well. The autocorrelation of the channel is computed
over the known part of the received data. Some examples of Doppler spread
estimation that use the autocorrelation of the channel estimations can be
found in [13,14]. A brief list of quantifying time selectivity and some relevant
adaptation options is given in Table 8.2.
As in time dispersion, Doppler spread estimation can also be improved by
additional capabilities of cognitive radio. Since Doppler shift is a function of
the speed of the mobile and Angle-of-Arrival (AoA), a sensor that provides
the absolute location information improves the Doppler spread estimation.
GPS is one of the prominent candidates for this sort of sensing applications
for cognitive radio. After several consecutive measurements,6 the speed and
angle-of-arrival (AoA) can be obtained in case the position of the base station
is known.

6 This can be seen with the fact that v = dr(t)/dt, where r is the position vector
(such as r(t) = [x y z]T , (·)T denotes the transpose operation) and v is the speed
of the mobile. Note that transmission frequency and speed of light are assumed
as known quantities.

Space Selectivity
Space selectivity is caused by the arrivals (or departures) of diﬀerent mul-
tipaths at the receiver (from the transmitter) at diﬀerent angles. When the
power of arriving (or departing) multipaths is considered over angle domain,
a spread is observed. The amount of spread is directly related to the richness
of the scatterers within the environment. The more the scatterers, the larger
the spread. Such as in time and frequency selectivity, coherence distance is
a measure of the selectivity over space. Coherence distance is inversely pro-
portional to angular spread. Hence, the shorter the coherence distance in the
space, the larger the spread over angle domain.
Although space selectivity is not studied as much as time and frequency
selectivity, there is a signiﬁcant interest on space selectivity in multi-antenna
systems. Adaptive wireless systems and cognitive radio can make use of the
information about space selectivity in several ways. For instance, the infor-
mation about space selectivity can be used in adaptive multi-antenna system
design. Adaptive power allocation is another method in which space selectiv-
ity is used to improve the performance [15]. Adaptive modulation and coding
across multi-antenna elements are also possible depending on the channel cor-
relations. Some other options are presented in Table 8.3.
Interference Selectivity
Apart from the three basic wireless channel dimensions (time, frequency, and
space) and related selectivity issues, several other dimensions can also be dis-
cussed [see Chapter 9 in this book]. Dimension of interference and selectivity
over which it is deﬁned can be considered as one of them. However, unlike the
three basic dimensions, the selectivity cannot be deﬁned solely over interfer-
ence dimension. Interference selectivity becomes clearer when it is considered
along with the basic dimensions. For instance, interference can be selective
over frequency. It can be either Narrow Band Interference (NBI) or Wide
Band Interference (WBI) depending on the bandwidth of the interferer as il-
lustrated in Figure 8.2. Similarly, interference conditions may change in time
resulting “time selective interference,” whereas change of interference condi-
tions in space causes “space selective interference.”

Fig. 8.2. Interference selectivity can be described via three basic dimensions: time,
frequency, and space. Here, an example of interference selectivity is shown over
frequency dimension. Note that the interference characteristics vary in frequency.
A cognitive radio, with enough knowledge of interference selectivity, can
adapt its radio parameters to have a better transmission. As an example, a
cognitive radio that uses Ultra Wide Band (UWB) scheme with OFDM can
be considered. The information about the frequency selectivity of interference
can be used to avoid NBI by de-activating the carriers corresponding to the
interfering bands [16]. Similarly, being aware of the time selectivity of interfer-
ence will give cognitive radio a chance to schedule its transmission accordingly
in time as well.
Code Selectivity
Toward the latest steps of the evolution of the wireless communication sys-
tems, we witness the emergence of code as an extension to the basic dimension
set. Therefore, selectivity over code dimension can be considered as well.
Code selectivity could be a very important measure for cognitive radio sys-
tems that use codes in accessing the channel such as Direct-Sequence Spread-
Spectrum (DSSS) systems using Pseudo Noise (PN) codes, Frequency Hopping
(FH) systems using FH codes, and UWB systems using Time Hopping
(TH) codes. Since most of the wireless systems are interference limited, the
interference that is caused by statistical properties of the codes (e.g. ISI,
which is caused by non-zero autocorrelation sidelobes of the codes or Multi
Access Interference (MAI), which is caused by non-zero cross-correlation side-
lobes of the codes) can be controlled by designing the codes appropriately.
Beside interference, spectral eﬃciency can also be achieved by adjusting
the statistical properties of the codes such as suppressing the sidelobes of

244
H¨useyin Arslan and Serhan Yarkan
auto- and cross-correlation. However, it is impossible to have codes that have
both perfect auto- and cross-correlation properties. Furthermore, there is a
trade-oﬀbetween having sidelobes suppressed and the amount of interference
created. Suppressing the sidelobes of the autocorrelation of the codes reduces
ISI and increases MAI, and vice versa. Therefore, taking all these concerns
into account, cognitive radio systems can increase the overall system capacity
by adjusting the statistical properties of the codes adaptively depending on
other system, channel, and transceiver parameters.
Other Selectivities
In this sequel, we must state that, wireless communications is not limited to
the aforementioned dimensions and selectivities. There are some other aspects
of wireless communications that need to be examined such as polarization,
signal, and power. Although these dimensions might not be directly related
to the actual wireless medium and can be regarded as elements of signal space,
they have strong connections with channel space.
8.2.2 Link Quality
First and foremost condition of having a communication is to make sure that
the information reaches at the receiver in a form that the receiver can recon-
struct what is transmitted. As discussed in Section 8.1, the communication
link exhibits diﬀerent behaviors over several dimensions because of the dy-
namic nature of wireless communications. Thus, sensing the communication
link is regarded as one of the most important tasks of cognitive radio in order
to be aware of the wireless channel. In this regard, this subsection reviews some
popular link quality measurement methods from the perspective of cognitive
radio.
Path-Loss
Path-loss is the measure of the diﬀerence between transmitted and received
power [6]. It is known that this loss increases with the transmitter–receiver
separation in distance and depends on the environment, which is represented
by the path-loss exponent.7,8
7 Here, it must be stated that path-loss includes the antenna gains of the trans-
mitter and receiver as well as the wavelength (or frequency) of the transmitted
electromagnetic wave. However, the average large-scale path-loss can be approx-
imated with the use of a function of both transmitter–receiver separation and a
path-loss exponent that takes diﬀerent values for diﬀerent environments [6].
8 There is also another type of path-loss, which is called frequency dependent path-
loss, that manifests itself in UWB communications systems.

8 Enabling CR via Sensing, Awareness, and Measurements
245
Path-loss information can be used in a very well-known application: adap-
tive power control [17]. In Code Division Multiple Accessing (CDMA) sys-
tems, when power control is not employed, all the users transmit with the
same power level. Hence, the users closer to the base station cause a very
high level of interference to the users which are far away from the base sta-
tion. Therefore, power control algorithms are applied to adjust power levels
of the users [8, and references therein]. Similar to adaptive power control, in-
terference management based on sensing the path-loss is also possible. Apart
from transmitter–receiver centric applications, path-loss information is useful
for the network control. In cellular systems, hand-oﬀ(or handover) can be
managed with the aid of path-loss information. As a direct consequence of
the use of this information in hand-oﬀs, adaptive channel allocation schemes
can be employed, which increase the channel utilization and decreases the
probability of call blocking [6]. As stated, path-loss highly depends on the
environment. Therefore, the performance of the aforementioned applications
can be improved in case of having information about the path-loss exponent.
In order to be able to make use of path-loss information as explained
above, it must be measured. Received Signal Strength (RSS) is one of the
simplest tools serving this purpose. In order to get RSS, the receiver samples
the channel and averages them out.9
At this point, it must be stated that being aware of the location, cogni-
tive radio can better estimate the path-loss by taking advantage of statistical
propagation models. Before getting into the details of this discussion, it is
appropriate to review the statistical propagation models brieﬂy.
Statistical Propagation Models for Path-Loss – It is known that the proﬁle
of the terrain in which the communication is established has a signiﬁcant
impact on path-loss [6]. Various statistical propagation models for diﬀerent
terrain proﬁles are available in the literature. These models, which are based
on extensive ﬁeld measurements, can provide quite simple formulae for path-
loss estimation in connection with the terrain of interest. For instance, the
path-loss model for “urban” areas can be considered. According to Hata’s
model [18], the median path-loss in “urban” areas is given by the following
formula:
Lurban(dB) = 69.55 + 26.16 log

9 RSS can be obtained by processing pilot signals (as in Wide Band CDMA
(WCDMA)) or link layer beacon (as in IEEE 802.11). However, the duration of
averages depends on many things such as system itself (having single or multiple
antennas), variation of the channel, application, and so on.

and MS stands for “mobile station;” BS stands for “base station;” fc de-
notes the transmission frequency; hi denotes the eﬀective antenna height
(i ∈{MS, BS}); d is the distance between MS and BS; and a(·) represents the
correction factor. In (8.2), the correction factor is deﬁned for small to medium
scaled city.10
In Hata’s model, we can model path-loss for other propagation environ-
ment classes as well. If one wants to estimate the path–loss for “suburban”

(8.4)
As can be seen from (8.1), (8.3), and (8.4), obtaining the path–loss de-
pends only on choosing the correct environmental index such as “urban,”
“suburban,” or “open rural.”11 In conventional systems, there is no method,
infrastructure, or device that can distinguish the propagation environments
from each other. However, with the emergence of cognitive radio, the use of
auxiliary sensing methods are brought forward to ﬁll this gap. Hence, cognitive
radio can take advantage of these extra sensing capabilities to distinguish the
propagation environments from each other. In this sequel, one might wonder
how cognitive radio can establish the distinguishing process. The answer of
this question requires the formal deﬁnition of each propagation environment.
Unfortunately, there is no formal deﬁnition for propagation environments.
Nonetheless, a coarse classiﬁcation of the propagation environments can still
be established. In Figure 8.3, very frequently used propagation environments
in the literature and their classiﬁcation are shown.
Having a classiﬁcation such as in Figure 8.3 will deﬁnitely be useful for
cognitive radio to employ the corresponding path-loss formula. However, there
is still a missing link in the chain: “How can cognitive radio understand that
which of the propagation environments presented in Figure 8.3 corresponds
to its surrounding environment?” Now, we are going to search for an answer
to this question.
10 There are several correction factors further to represent other sort of environments
such as large city for diﬀerent transmission frequencies, fc.
11 In COST 231, the extension of Hata’s model is provided as well [7]. Here, the
details of the speciﬁcations of Hata’s model such as the limits for h, d, and fc
are not discussed. However, interested readers may refer to [6, 7, and references
therein] for further details.

Fig. 8.3. Some popularly used propagation environments in the literature and their
classiﬁcation.
Environmental Characterization – In Longley–Rice model, which is one of the
earliest propagation models, there are two operation modes deﬁned depend-
ing on the availability of the terrain proﬁle: “point-to-point mode” and “area
mode” [19,20]. Although this model is for point-to-point communication, its

248
H¨useyin Arslan and Serhan Yarkan
signiﬁcance lies beneath the use of terrain proﬁles in estimating the path-loss.
Similar to [19,20], [21,22] make use of a topographical database to estimate
the ﬁeld strength. In light of this approach, it can be said that cognitive radio
can take advantage of terrain proﬁle data to characterize the topography of
its surrounding environment. Some of the basic topographical databases such
as DEMs – i.e. digital representations of a topographic surface, which is used
for determining properties of terrain in terms of elevation at any point, slope,
aspect and extracting features of it, such as peaks, pits, and other landforms –
are already available. GIS is also another very popular application which can
be used for the same purpose.12 In fact, GIS is more promising than DEMs,
because it can be queried by several methods one of which is the position vec-
tor r(t) = [x, y, z]T . Recall that global positioning system (GPS) can provide
the position vector. Thus, cognitive radio that can be provided with posi-
tion information by a network or a positioning capable sensor (such as GPS)
can easily extract the topographical information. Then, the digital data is
processed with the aid of Spatial Interpolation Method (SIM) to obtain char-
acteristics of the local physical environment [21, 22, 24]. The remaining part
is just to ﬁnd the best match for the extracted topographical data among
environmental classes. As stated above, matching the data can be handled
via pattern recognition and/or parallel processing capable tools that cogni-
tive radio possesses. Upon ﬁnding the best match, a statistical model related
to the matched environmental class is chosen and adaptation stage is initiated.
The algorithm for this process is presented in Figure 8.4. Besides, Table 8.4
presents the possible ways of quantifying the path-loss along with adaptation
options.

The impact of noise upon communications systems is known very well [34].
Noise is also taken into account in statistical wireless channel models. In order
to improve the performance of wireless systems, characterizing the behavior
of noise is very important. As will be shown subsequently, environments can
provide some hints about the statistical behavior of noise. Hence, cognitive
radio can make use of the relationship between environment and corresponding
statistical behavior of the noise for its adaptation.
Noise
In most of the wireless channel models, noise is assumed as white and Gaussian
distributed because of its mathematical tractability. However, in practice, sev-
eral other types of noise behaviors exist too. In the literature, several studies
show that oﬃces, factories, and hospitals have impulsive noise [26]. Similarly,
in outdoor environments such noise sources are observed. Thus, the perfor-
mance of a system designed under the assumption of white and Gaussian
distributed noise will be aﬀected in the presence of an impulsive noise. More-
over, it is also reported that some diversity schemes such as maximal ratio
combining, equal gain combining, and selection diversity are not eﬀective in
impulsive noise environments [27].
If cognitive radio knows the characteristics of the ambient noise, some of
the system parameters such as coding requirements can be adjusted accord-
ingly [26]. Besides, information about noise can be very useful in designing
transceivers via adaptive modulation, optimal soft information calculation,
and improved channel estimation [28,29]. From the network perspective, noise
information can be used in improving several applications such as hand-oﬀ,
power control, and channel allocation techniques [8].

Signal-to-
Interference Ratio (SIR) (or Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) or Signal-to-
Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR)) are popularly used during or right after
the demodulation process at the receiver. Unlike Received Signal Strength
Indicator (RSSI), these quantiﬁers need to wait for the completion of the
demodulation process.13 However, the estimates are more reliable at this
13 It must be stated that because these quantiﬁers can be read during or right after
the demodulation procedure, they introduce additional complexity to the system
compared to RSSI.

stage. As their names imply, these quantiﬁers are based on the ratio between
the power level of the desired signal (S), and the power level of the unwanted
signal(s) (I and/or N), where S
I ,
S
N , and
S
I+N denote SIR, SNR, and SINR,
respectively. They can be obtained in several ways. In many new–generation
wireless systems, coherent detection is employed. Since coherent detection
requires estimation of channel parameters, estimated parameters can be
used in calculating the signal power as well. The use of training sequences
and data symbols are other two options of signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)
estimation.14 SNR (or SIR, or signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR))
is formed by estimating the desired received signal and the impairment sep-
arately. Hence, estimation of SNR provides information about the noise.
In OFDM based systems, noise power estimation is often based on the dif-
ference between the noiseless and noisy samples in frequency domain, which
assumes the noise is white and Gaussian distributed. However, as stated
above, noise in frequency domain can sometimes have a diﬀerent power spec-
trum from a ﬂat power spectrum. In such cases, looking at the estimate of
the noise variance in frequency domain provides beneﬁcial information about
the noise color [28, 29]. Some of the parameters in measuring the noise and
relevant adaptation options are given in Table 8.5.
There are further link quality measurements on the physical and Medium
Access Control (MAC) layers too. These measurements such as Bit-Error-
Rate (BER), Frame-Error-Rate (FER), and Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
become available after the decoding process and their reliabilities are improved
signiﬁcantly compared to the aforementioned ones. However, one should keep
in mind that, having information at this stage comes at the expense of
larger processing delays and additional computational complexity. Further-
more, some of them such as BER and FER require excessive amount of time
to attain a reliable quantiﬁcation.

Network and Transport Layer Measurements
When network and transport layer are considered, observing and quantifying
the wireless communication link brings about diﬀerent perspectives. In these
layers, transceivers perceive the communication link as a whole that includes
other transceivers. Therefore, in these layers, transceivers take into account
the status of other nodes in the network as well.
Packet loss is one of the basic and simple quantiﬁer that can be used in
these layers. Transceivers can get information about the quality of the link
by simply counting the packets which could not be acknowledged. Similarly,
Round-Trip Time (RTT) can be used in estimating the quality of the link to
some extent. The buﬀer status of the nodes can be used in determining the
congestion level of the link, which can also be regarded as a measure of link
quality. Particularly in ad hoc networks, being aware of other nodes become
prominent. For instance, a quantiﬁer that indicates the power level of the
other nodes introduces another metric for routing, which is known as “power
aware routing” [30]. In connection with power aware routing, being aware of
the locations (or relative positions) of the nodes will deﬁnitely provide these
layers with an extra and very important quantiﬁer.
With the aid of these quantiﬁers, cognitive radio can adjust its transmis-
sion rate to avoid congestion, increase eﬃciency, save energy, and so on. In
addition, cognitive radio can contribute to the network optimization by com-
bining many of them. For instance, combination of power aware routing and
being aware of the locations of other nodes will provide a superior routing
scheme compared to those which make use of only one routing metric. Some
of the quantiﬁcation parameters and related adaptation options are presented
in Table 8.6.
Upper Layers
After passing through session and application layers, cognitive radio reaches at
the user even though the user by itself is not a layer in the protocol stack. From
the perspective of cognitive radio, the user carries a signiﬁcant importance

because of its place in the cognition cycle. Therefore, cognitive radio can
perceive the user as another layer that is placed on top of the traditional
protocol stack and sense it. These issues will be discussed in Section 8.4 in
detail.
8.2.3 Other Wireless Channel Characteristics
In addition to the topics discussed in Sections 8.2.1 and 8.2.2, there are some
further parameters that have signiﬁcant impact on the transmission such as
being in Line-of-Sight (LOS)/Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS).
LOS/NLOS
When the ﬁeld measurements are established in order to have a statistical
channel model, it is extremely important to distinguish the measurements
as for LOS and NLOS. This stems from the fact that LOS channels will
behave very diﬀerently compared to NLOS channels because of the presence
of the direct component. LOS/NLOS distinction is very important in terms of
the operation band as well, since the behavior of propagation diﬀers in LOS
and NLOS. For instance, in order to be able to establish a communication
with electromagnetic waves that have wavelengths on the order of millimeters
(the bands above 10 GHz), LOS is required as in 10–66 GHz portion of the
physical layer part of IEEE 802.16 [31]. However, the necessity of having LOS
is not required for sub-10 GHz bands. In addition, being in LOS/NLOS is
very important for positioning algorithms. The error characteristics change
drastically depending on being in LOS or NLOS [32].
The knowledge of being in LOS or NLOS allows cognitive radio to have
some adaptation options. Cognitive radio can easily switch to an appropriate
upper frequency band to achieve higher data rates in case of being in LOS or
switches back to the band in which it was previously operating when there
is no LOS. Ranging and positioning algorithms can be selected by cognitive
radio adaptively, depending on the status of the transmission in terms of being
in LOS or NLOS as well.
In order to determine whether the status of the communication is LOS or
NLOS, hypothesis test is applied. Hypothesis test makes use of the mutually
exclusive relationship between LOS and NLOS [32–35]. Considering the fact
that the channel amplitudes of the ﬁrst tap in narrowband systems follow
Ricean distribution in LOS and Rayleigh distribution in NLOS, a comparison
between the reference (theoretical) distributions and values observed can be
established before the hypothesis test [36].15 However, a reliable decision for
the comparison approach, a priori knowledge about the noise level of the sys-
tem is required [32]. Apart from these methods, autocorrelation characteristics
of multiple channel taps have also been proposed [31].
15 In comparing the statistics obtained to a reference one, some statistical tests such
as Pearson’s test statistics [36] or Kolmogorov–Smirnov test [37] can be employed.

Quantifying the transmission status in terms of being LOS or NLOS be-
comes possible through the use of additional sensing capabilities of cognitive
radio. A list of quantiﬁcation options and relevant adaptation parameters for
LOS/NLOS is given in Table 8.7. As discussed in detail in Section 8.2.2, the
use of DEMs is a very promising candidate for this purpose. In fact, previ-
ously, DEMs have already been used in digital domain to determine the status
of being LOS or NLOS [21,22].
8.3 Network Awareness
This section outlines what and how cognitive can sense, be aware of, and
consequently adapt the network related issues. The following two perspectives
are considered: being aware of the same network and other network structures.
8.3.1 Being Aware of the Same Network
This sort of awareness is necessary while cognitive radio is already communi-
cating with some other nodes. From this point of view, being aware of its own
network and its other members (nodes) will deﬁnitely improve the quality of
overall network communications. However, being a member of the same net-
work does not necessarily require that all the nodes have cognitive capabilities.
Therefore, it can be said that being “entirely” aware of the same network is
only possible when all the nodes in that network are cognitive radio.
As discussed in Section 8.2.2, being aware of the same network can be
extended by using conventional and advanced methods such as the use of
packet loss quantiﬁers, routing algorithms, and some other additional capa-
bilities which are introduced by cognitive radio such as location sensing.
8.3.2 Being Aware of Other Networks
Before cognitive radio begins to communicate, it can sense not only the unoc-
cupied bands in the spectrum, but also the signaling schemes over the air. For
instance, cognitive radio can sense unoccupied slots for Time Division Mul-
tiple Accessing (TDMA)–based signaling, and furthermore, it can be aware
of the network type by using several methods such as cyclostationary-based

254
H¨useyin Arslan and Serhan Yarkan
detection. This is very important for cognitive radio, since it can easily change
its transmission parameters such as employing valid waveforms and relevant
policies for the network sensed with the aid of SDR.
This type of sensing and awareness carries a great importance especially
for emergency, disaster relief, and rescue operations. The transmission of other
devices can be observed by sensing the spectrum, extracting the data from
other users’ transmission, processing it, comparing it with some a priori in-
formation (such as standard information), and making a decision about the
existence of a possible network. Thus, in such an environment, cognitive ra-
dios can establish a network and connectivity for the devices which cannot
easily be detected by ﬁrst responders [39].
8.4 User Awareness
When cognitive radio has ﬁrst been brought forward [3, 19], beside its ad-
vanced properties such as the capability of sensing the spectrum, adjusting
the transmission parameters via software (or software deﬁned radio (SDR)),
the concept of “user dimension” has been pulled inside the radio communica-
tion domain entirely. Here, the word “entirely” is preferred, because, there are
already some earlier attempts. However, these attempts are limited compared
to that of cognitive radio, because, they mostly require user’s intervention.
Some advanced cell phones, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), and laptops
can deﬁne several user proﬁles as options, but, these options are not auto-
mated. In addition, once the user chooses any of the options provided, the
device cannot make modiﬁcations on the options depending on the changing
conditions.
However, cognitive radio, beside the aforementioned capabilities, can learn
and even make predictions about the user. One of the interesting awareness
topic about the user is being aware of user’s perception. When a simple voice
conversation over phone is considered, some sort of adaptations become clearer
depending on the environment and/or who the user is. For instance, if the user
is in a crowded and noisy environment such as a stadium, the intelligibility of
the voice decreases drastically. In the conventional way, the user intervention
is required by just choosing the loudest voice level of the phone or warning
the other party to raise his/her voice. However, cognitive radio can reduce or
totally remove the user intervention by sensing the environment with the aid
of its additional sensing and advanced recognition capabilities. Detecting the
crowd via visual sensing and picking the phrases such as “I did not hear you,”
“Can you repeat it?” “Can you raise your voice?” cognitive radio is aware of
the user’s perception (as well as the environment) and adapts to satisfy its
user’s needs. Another interesting user awareness and adaptation scenario can
occur while driving a car. Driving car inherently limits some of the abilities
of the user such as reading and/or using the keypad of the communication
device. When a text message (such as Short Message Service (SMS) or e-mail)

8 Enabling CR via Sensing, Awareness, and Measurements
255
arrives, cognitive radio can convert the text to speech without requiring user
intervention. When the user wants to reply, it can do the process in reverse
direction, in other words it can convert speech to text, and send the text
message. In case the user wants to call the sender, it can initiate an ordi-
nary phone conversation by recognizing the user’s speech and command (such
as “Call him!”). Another very important application area of user oriented
sensing occurs in emergency related events. Cognitive radio that is aware of
physiological state of its user can immediately establish a 911 call in case of
an emergency.
Because humans have many aspects in terms of their perceptions, psycho-
logical status, and some other further characteristics, the items to be included
into the list in user dimension are numerous. However, possessing very pow-
erful abilities such as learning and sensing beside awareness and adaptation,
cognitive radio can have various sensing options for other aspects of human,
which have very stong relations with AI.
8.5 Other Possible Awareness Scenarios
It is certain that wireless communications cannot be limited to the topics
mentioned throughout this chapter. Although a wide perspective is tried to be
established, it is very diﬃcult to put all possible aspects of the communications
into text, since most of them evolve in time. However, some of the topics that
are and will be of interest can still be discussed.
The security is one of the most important aspects in all types of commu-
nications. In this manner, cognitive radio can decide the appropriate security
level without requiring any external intervention. Here, the discussion excludes
the use of the safest level, because it comes at the expense of delay, overhead,
and so on. These concerns force cognitive radio to optimize (deciding the ap-
propriate level) the security level. In connection with optimization, cognitive
radio itself can be considered as another dimension (or entity) to be sensed
and aware of in the communications domain. Cognitive radio cannot attain
a global optimization unless it is aware of itself. In this regard, being aware
of its resources such as battery level and hardware limitations (e.g. the lim-
its of Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), processor speed, memory size, and
so on), the operational status such as being in hibernation, in-charge mode,
communication mode, learning mode can be considered just to name few.
8.6 Challenges and Future Directions
So far, it is discussed that the capabilities of cognitive radio enable many new
sensing options providing alternatives to already existing ones. A hierarchi-
cal list of some major items to be sensed by cognitive radio is presented in

8 Enabling CR via Sensing, Awareness, and Measurements
257
Figure 8.5. However, there are many challenges related to these enabling ap-
proaches. In this section, the prominent challenges and hurdles regarding to
these approaches will be outlined.
First, the challenge with the general architecture of cognitive radio needs
to be addressed. In order for cognitive radio to attain the point that has been
discussed so far, a design, which integrates SDR and tools that handle artiﬁcial
intelligence (AI) sort of operations, is required. This can be considered as the
most challenging issue for cognitive radio.
Assuming that such an architecture or design is established, the complex-
ity of the procedures in sensing mentioned throughout this chapter is quite
overwhelming. Therefore, cognitive radio needs to ﬁnd ways of handling this
complexity issue. Cognitive radio makes use of not only existing methods and
approaches, but also the new opportunities of sensing with the aid of addi-
tional sensors and devices to improve the adaptation process. Since the infor-
mation traﬃc will increase considerably, controlling, processing, and therefore
managing the resources automatically become a major concern.
Apart from general challenges, there are some other challenges peculiar to
sensing, being aware, and adaptation for each topic discussed up until now. In
Section 8.2.2, determining the path-loss through the use of external sensors
has been discussed. The main challenge here is to ﬁnd how cognitive radio can
identify the environment in order to use the appropriate path-loss exponent.
As explained in [3], distinguishing indoor from outdoor is a simple job by
just using light and thermal sensor. However, distinguishing several indoor
environments from each other, such as LOS and NLOS indoor communications
requires additional eﬀort.
In Section 8.2.3, extracting time dispersion parameters of the wireless
channel with the aid of DEMs and GIS has been discussed as well. How-
ever, digital information provided by these sorts of tools must be interpreted
by cognitive radio in such a way that it can understand the geomorphological
characteristics of the environment and classify them as hilly terrain, urban,
and so on. As can be seen, the interpretation process requires the use of ad-
vanced pattern recognition algorithms. Another aspect of geomorphological
characterization is that it may require the classiﬁcation of the propagation
environments for cognitive radio to choose an appropriate model as discussed
earlier. There are extensive statistical channel models in the literature to in-
clude various possible propagation environments. If cognitive radio can match
the surrounding environment with an existing statistical model in its mem-
ory, it can easily adjust a few relevant parameters to adapt the environment.
However, in order for cognitive radio to choose one of the statistical models
among many of them, it should store the statistical models in a hierarchical
way. Unfortunately, there is no clear-cut deﬁnition for types of propagation
environments in the literature. Cognitive radio may suﬀer from lack of these
deﬁnitions.
In quantifying time selectivity, apart from the conventional way of
extracting the parameters, cognitive radio can make use of its location sensors

258
H¨useyin Arslan and Serhan Yarkan
such as GPS. However, it is not known how frequently cognitive radio must
refer to the sensors to obtain the information. In addition, the capabilities
of the sensors (such as acquisition time, precision, and so on) must also be
taken into account.
In time selective interference, characterizing the pattern of the interfer-
ence that changes in time for adapting purposes may require long observa-
tion durations. This hurdle becomes clearer in channels that are randomly
accessed. Similar to interference, the relationships between code dimension
and three basic dimensions need to be studied to have a comprehensive
understanding of the selectivity.
The inclusion of aforementioned and possible future dimensions into the
universe of cognitive radio will force researchers to examine the relationships
between these dimensions. The entangled structures of these dimensions must
be investigated throughly to realize the ultimate cognitive radio, which is a
very challenging task.
Considering the complete adaptation and global optimization jointly un-
veils one of the biggest challenges in realizing cognitive radio. In order for
cognitive radio to achieve both complete adaptation and global optimiza-
tion, the complex nature of complete adaptation needs to be scrutinized. The
analysis must encompass both already existing and recently emerging sens-
ing options and their relevance. Upon this analysis, which is very likely to
provide a very comprehensive list, the ways of attaining global optimization
must be researched. Global optimization through additional sensing capabil-
ities along with the already existing ones can be achieved by AI structure,
which is, generally, referred as cognitive engine. Thus, cognitive engine must
be capable of “understanding,” “interpreting,” and even “reasoning” via the
input provided by layers, sensors, and even by its own hardware. In order
for cognitive engine to “think” taking into account all input, a descriptive
language, Radio Knowledge Representation Language (RKRL), is proposed
in [3]. Hence, already existing and recently emerging options must be included
into the knowledge space of cognitive radio in connection with the analysis.
The interactions, applications, and algorithms in a network that include
both cognitive and non-cognitive radios need to be studied as well. In this
regard, networks in which all the nodes are cognitive radios form another ﬁeld
of study.
Especially in sensing other networks, cognitive radio is challenged by tech-
nological limitations. Currently, sensing other types of networks and signaling
schemes is carried out by huge devices. Beyond that, the techniques that
are employed for that purpose require computationally very complex signal
processing operations which are power hungry. Thus, in order for cognitive
radio to have these abilities, practically simple and less complex algorithms
that can perform the same operations must be developed.
Considering the fact that sensing, learning, being aware, and adaptation
capabilities make cognitive radio more personal, the characterization of the

8 Enabling CR via Sensing, Awareness, and Measurements
259
user can be examined in detail. Especially sensing the user’s psychological and
physiological status and act on accordingly will be an interesting research for
the sake of becoming more personal.
8.7 Conclusion
Cognitive radio provides new horizons to the radio communications with its
advanced capabilities such as sensing, learning, being aware of, and adaptation
to its surrounding environment. These advanced capabilities improve almost
every aspect of wireless communications. In this chapter, some major items
to be sensed by cognitive radio are discussed. It is certain that the things
that cognitive radio can sense, be aware of, and measure are not limited to
the items discussed here. As cognitive radio evolves, the list of the things
that cognitive radio can sense, be aware of, and measure will evolve as well.
However, in order for cognitive radio to come true, the hurdles in front of the
new methods of sensing and measuring processes must be overcome.

9.1 Introduction
The need for higher data rates is increasing as a result of the transition from
voice-only communication to wireless multimedia and web type of applica-
tions. Given the limitations of natural frequency spectrum, it becomes obvious
that current static frequency allocation schemes cannot accommodate these
requirements of increasing number of higher data rate devices. As a result,
innovative techniques that can oﬀer new ways of exploiting the available spec-
trum are needed. Cognitive radio arises to be a tempting solution to spectral
crowding problem by introducing the opportunistic usage of frequency bands
that are not heavily occupied by licensed users [1]. While there is no agree-
ment on the formal deﬁnition of cognitive radio as of now, the concept has
evolved recently to include various meanings in several contexts [2]. One main
aspect of cognitive radio is related to autonomously exploiting locally unused
spectrum to provide new paths to spectrum access. Other aspects include
interoperability across several networks; roaming across borders while being
able to stay in compliance with local regulations; adapting the system, trans-
mission, and reception parameters without user intervention; and having the
ability to understand and follow actions and choices taken by their users to
learn how to become more responsive over time.
One of the most important components of cognitive radio concept is the
ability to measure, sense, learn, and be aware of the parameters related to the
radio channel characteristics, availability of spectrum and power, interference
and noise temperature, radio’s operating environment, user requirements and
applications, available networks (infrastructures) and nodes, local policies and
other operating restrictions. In cognitive radio terminology, primary users can
be deﬁned as the users who have higher priority or legacy rights on the usage
of a speciﬁc part of the spectrum. On the other hand, secondary users, which
have lower priority, exploit this spectrum in such a way that they do not
cause interference to primary users. Therefore, secondary users need to have
cognitive radio capabilities, such as sensing the spectrum reliably to check

whether it is being used by a primary user, and to change the radio parameters
to exploit the unused part of the spectrum.
Being the focus of this chapter, spectrum sensing by far is the most im-
portant task among others for the establishment of cognitive radio. Spectrum
sensing includes awareness about the interference temperature and existence
of primary users. As an alternative to spectrum sensing, geolocation and data-
base or beacons1 can be used for determining the current status of the spec-
trum usage [3,4]. In this chapter, we focus on spectrum sensing performed by
cognitive radios because of its broader application areas while referring other
methods as needed. Although spectrum sensing is traditionally understood
as measuring the spectral content, or measuring the interference temperature
over the spectrum; when the ultimate cognitive radio is considered, it is a more
general term that involves obtaining the spectrum usage characteristics across
multiple dimensions such as time, space, frequency, and code. It also involves
determining what type of signals are occupying the spectrum (including the
modulation, waveform, bandwidth, carrier frequency, etc.). However, this req-
uires more powerful signal analysis techniques with additional computational
complexity.
Various aspects of spectrum sensing task are illustrated in Figure 9.1.
The goal of this chapter is to point out several aspects of spectrum sens-
ing as shown in this ﬁgure. These aspects will be discussed in the rest of
this chapter. We start by explaining some challenges associated with spec-
trum sensing in Section 9.2. Section 9.3 explains the main spectrum sensing
methods. Cooperative sensing concept and its various forms are introduced
in Section 9.4, followed by a discussion of external sensing algorithms in
Section 9.5. Statistical modeling of network traﬃc and utilization of these
models for prediction of primary user behavior is studied in Section 9.6.
Section 9.7 explains the factors on deciding the frequency of spectrum sens-
ing. Hardware perspective of sensing problem is discussed in Section 9.8.
We introduce the multi-dimensional spectrum sensing concept in Section 9.9.
Finally, sensing features of some current wireless standards are explained in
Section 9.10 and our conclusions are given in Section 9.11.
9.2 Challenges
Before getting into the details of spectrum sensing techniques, some challenges
associated with the spectrum sensing for cognitive radio is given in this section.
Hardware Requirements
Spectrum sensing for cognitive radio applications requires high sampling rate,
high resolution Analog to Digital Converter (ADCs) with large dynamic range,

trum as well as other advanced features such as channel quality.

multiple analog front end circuitry, and high speed signal processors. Estimat-
ing the noise variance or interference temperature over transmission of desired
narrowband signals is not new. Such noise variance estimation techniques
have been popularly used for optimal receiver designs like channel estimation,
soft information generation, as well as for improved hand-oﬀ, power control,
and channel allocation techniques. The noise/interference estimation prob-
lem is easier for these purposes as receivers are tuned to receive signals that
are transmitted over a desired bandwidth. Moreover, receivers are capable of
processing the narrowband baseband signals with reasonably low complexity
and low power processors. However, in cognitive radio, terminals are required
to process transmission over a much wider band for sensing any opportunity.
Hidden Primary User Problem
Hidden primary user problem is similar to the hidden node problem in Car-
rier Sense Multiple Accessing (CSMA). This problem can be caused by many
factors including severe multipath fading or shadowing that secondary users
observe while scanning primary users’ transmissions. Figure 9.2 shows an illus-
tration of hidden node problem. Here, cognitive radio device causes unwanted
interference to the primary user (receiver) as the primary transmitters signal
could not be detected because of the positioning of devices in space.
Fig. 9.2. Illustration of hidden primary user problem in cognitive radio systems.

267
Spread Spectrum Primary Users
Primary users that use frequency hopping or spread spectrum signaling, where
the power of the primary user signal is distributed over a wider frequency even
though the actual information bandwidth is much narrower, are diﬃcult to
detect. Especially, frequency hopping-based signaling creates signiﬁcant prob-
lems regarding to spectrum sensing. This problem can be partially avoided if
the hopping pattern is known and perfect synchronization to the signal can
be achieved.
Sensing Time
Primary users can claim their frequency bands anytime while cognitive radio
is operating at that band. In order to prevent interference to and from pri-
mary license owners, cognitive radio should be able to identify the presence of
primary users as quickly as possible and should vacate the band immediately.
Hence, sensing method should be able to identify the presence of primary user
within a certain duration. This requirement possesses a limit on the perfor-
mance of sensing algorithm and create a challenge for cognitive radio design.
Other Challenges
Some other challenges that need to be considered while designing eﬀective
spectrum sensing algorithm include implementation complexity, presence of
multiple secondary users, coherence times, multipath and shadowing, cooper-
ation, competition, robustness, heterogeneous propagation losses, and power
consumption.
9.3 Spectrum Sensing Methods for Cognitive Radio
The present literature for spectrum sensing is still in its early stages of
development. A number of diﬀerent methods are proposed for identifying the
presence of signal transmission. In some approaches, characteristics of the
identiﬁed transmission are detected for deciding the signal transmission as
well as identifying the signal type. In this section, some of the most common
spectrum sensing techniques in the cognitive radio literature are explained.
9.3.1 Matched Filtering
Matched ﬁltering is known as the optimum method for detection of pri-
mary users when the transmitted signal is known [5]. The main advantage
of matched ﬁltering is the short time2 to achieve a certain probability of false
2 The required number of samples grows as O(1/SNR) for a target probability of
false alarm or miss detection at low SNRs [6].

268
H¨useyin Arslan and Tevﬁk Y¨ucek
alarm or probability of miss detection [6] as compared to other methods that
are discussed in this section. However, matched ﬁltering requires the cognitive
radio to demodulate received signals. Hence, it requires perfect knowledge of
the primary users signaling features such as bandwidth, operating frequency,
modulation type and order, pulse shaping, frame format, etc. Moreover, since
cognitive radio needs receivers for all signal types, implementation complexity
of sensing unit is impractically large [7]. Another disadvantage is large power
consumption as various receiver algorithms need to be executed for detection.
9.3.2 Waveform-Based Sensing
Known patterns are usually utilized in wireless systems to assist synchro-
nization or for other purposes. Such patterns include preambles, midambles,
regularly transmitted pilot patterns, spreading sequences, etc. In the presence
of a known pattern, sensing can be performed by correlating the received sig-
nal with a known copy of itself [8,9]. This method is only applicable to systems
with known signal patterns, and it is termed as waveform-based sensing. In [8],
it is shown that waveform-based sensing outperforms energy detector-based
sensing in reliability and convergence time. Furthermore, it is shown that the
performance of the sensing algorithm increases as the length of the known sig-
nal pattern increases. As one of the methods for analyzing the Wireless Local
Area Network (WLAN) channel usage characteristics, packet preambles of
IEEE 802.11b [10] signals are exploited in [11,12]. Measurement results pre-
sented in [13] show that waveform-based sensing requires short measurements
time, however, it is susceptible to synchronization errors.
Let us assume that the received signal has the following simple form:
y(n) = s(n) + w(n),
(9.1)
where s(n) is the signal to be detected, w(n) is the Additive White Gaussian
Noise (AWGN) sample, and n is the sample index. Note that s(n) = 0 when
there is no transmission by primary user. The waveform-based sensing metric3
can be obtained as [8]
M = Re
 N

n=1
y(n)s∗(n)

,
(9.2)
where N is the length of known pattern. In the absence of the primary user,
the metric value becomes
M = Re
 N

n=1
w(n)s∗(n)

.
(9.3)
3 In this chapter, time-domain sampling is explained as an example. Modiﬁed ver-
sions of the method explained in this chapter can be used in frequency domain
as well. Likewise, the method given in this chapter can be modiﬁed depending on
the available pattern.

9 Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Applications
269
Similarly, in the presence of a primary user’s signal, the sensing metric
becomes
M =
N

n=1
|s(n)|2 + Re
 N

n=1
w(n)s∗(n)

.
(9.4)
The decision on the presence of a primary user signal can be made by com-
paring the decision metric M against a ﬁxed threshold λW . This is equivalent
to distinguishing between the following two hypotheses:
H0 : y(n) = w(n),
(9.5)
H1 : y(n) = s(n) + w(n).
(9.6)
The performance of the detection algorithm can be summarized with two
probabilities: probability of detection PD and probability of false alarm PF .
PD is the probability of detecting a signal on the considered frequency when
it truly is present, thus large detection probability is desired. It can be for-
mulated as
PD = Pr (M > λW |H1) ,
(9.7)
where λW is the threshold value. PF is the probability that the test incorrectly
decides that the considered frequency is occupied when it actually is not, and
it can be written as
PF = Pr (M > λW |H0) .
(9.8)
PF should be kept as small as possible. The decision threshold λW can be
selected for ﬁnding an optimum balance between PD and PF . However, this
requires the knowledge of noise and detected signal powers. The noise power
can be estimated, but the signal power is diﬃcult to estimate as it changes
depending on ongoing transmission characteristics and the distance between
the cognitive radio and primary user. In practice, the threshold is chosen to
obtain a certain false alarm rate. Hence, the knowledge of noise variance is
enough for selection of a threshold.
9.3.3 Cyclostationarity-Based Sensing
Cyclostationarity feature detection is a method for detecting primary user
transmissions by exploiting the cyclostationarity features of the received sig-
nals [7, 14–19]. Cyclostationary features are caused by the periodicity in the
signal or in its statistics like mean and autocorrelation. Instead of Power Spec-
tral Density (PSD), cyclic correlation function is used for detecting signals
present in a given spectrum. The cyclostationarity-based detection algorithms
can diﬀerentiate noise from primary users’ signals. This is a result of the fact
that noise is wide-sense stationary Wide-Sense Stationary (WSS) with no
correlation while modulated signals are cyclostationary with spectral correla-
tion due to the redundancy of signal periodicities [16].
The Cyclic Spectral Density (CSD) function of received signal (9.1) can
be calculated as [20]

(9.9)
where
Rα
y (τ) = E
&
y(n + τ)y∗(n −τ)ej2παn'
(9.10)
is the Cyclic Autocorrelation Function (CAF), and α is the cyclic frequency.
The CSD function outputs peak values when the cyclic frequency is equal to
the fundamental frequencies of transmitted signal x(n). Cyclic frequencies can
be assumed to be known [14,19] or they can be extracted and used as features
for identifying transmitted signals [17].
9.3.4 Energy Detector-Based Sensing
Energy detector-based approaches, also known as radiometry or periodogram,
are the most common ways of spectrum sensing because of their low computa-
tional and implementation complexities [7–9,11,12,18,22–28,28–30]. Moreover,
they are more generic as receivers do not need any knowledge on the primary
users’ signals. The signal is detected by comparing the output of energy detector
with a threshold which depends on the noise ﬂoor [31]. Some of the challenges
with energy detector-based sensing include selection of the threshold for detect-
ing primary users, inability to diﬀerentiate interference from primary users and
noise, and poor performance under low Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) values [8].
Moreover, the energy detector does not work eﬃciently for detecting spread
spectrum signals [7].
Using the same model given in (9.1), decision metric for energy detector
can be written as
M =
N

n=0
|y(n)|2.
(9.11)
The white noise can be modeled as a zero-mean Gaussian random variable
with variance σ2
w, i.e. w(n) = N(0, σ2
w). For a simpliﬁed analysis, let us model
the signal term as a zero-mean Gaussian variable as well,4 i.e. s(n) = N(0, σ2
s).
Because of these assumptions, the decision metric M follows chi-square dis-
tribution with 2N degrees freedom χ2
2N and hence, it can be modeled as
M =
 σ2
w
2 χ2

H0,

For energy detector, the probabilities PF and PD can be calculated as [22]5

PD = 1 −Γ

4 In fact, the model for s(n) is more complicated as fading should also be considered.
5 Please note that the notation used in [22] is slightly diﬀerent. Moreover, the noise
power is normalized before it is fed into the threshold device in [22].

function as given in [32] (see Equation 6.5.1). Figure 9.3 shows the Receiver
Operating Characteristics (ROCs) for diﬀerent SNR values. SNR is deﬁned as
the ratio of the primary user’s signal power to noise power, i.e. SNR = σ2
s/σ2
w.
The averaging size is set to 15 in this ﬁgure, N = 15. As this ﬁgure clearly
shows, the performance of the threshold detector increases at high SNR values.
The threshold used in energy detector-based sensing algorithms depends
on the noise variance. Consequently, small noise power estimation errors
causes signiﬁcant performance loss [33]. As a solution to this problem, in [34],
noise level is estimated dynamically by applying a reduced-rank eigenvalue de-
composition to incoming signal’s autocorrelation. Then, the estimated value
is used to choose the threshold for satisfying a constant false alarm rate.
Measurement results are analyzed in [11,12] using energy detector to iden-
tify the idle and busy periods of WLAN channels. Energy level for each Global
System for Mobile (GSM) slot is measured and compared in [25] for identi-
fying the idle slots for exploitation. The sensing task in this work is diﬀerent
in the sense that the cognitive radio has to be synchronized to the primary
user network and the sensing time is limited to slot duration. A similar ap-
proach is used in [35] as well for opportunistic exploitation of unused cel-
lular slots. In [26], power at the output of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

272
H¨useyin Arslan and Tevﬁk Y¨ucek
of incoming signal is compared with a threshold value in order to identify
the number of used TV channels. FFT is performed on the data sampled at
45 kHz around the centered TV carrier frequency for each TV channel. The
performance of energy detector-based sensing over various fading channels is
investigated in [22]. Closed-form expressions for probability of detection under
AWGN and fading (Rayleigh, Nakagami, and Ricean) channels are derived.
Average probability of detection for energy detector-based sensing algorithms
under log-normal shadowing and Rayleigh fading channels is derived in [8].
It is observed that the performance of energy-detector degrades considerably
under Rayleigh fading. Forward methods based on energy measurements are
studied for unknown noise power scenarios in [37]. The proposed method adap-
tively estimates the noise level, hence suitable for practical cases where noise
variance is not known.
9.3.5 Radio Identiﬁcation
A better knowledge about the spectrum characteristics can be obtained by
identifying the transmission technology used by primary users. Such an iden-
tiﬁcation enables cognitive radio with a higher dimensional knowledge as well
as providing higher accuracy [30]. For example, assume that the primary users
technology is identiﬁed as a Bluetooth signal. Cognitive radio can use this
information for extracting some useful information in space dimension as the
range of Bluetooth signal is known to be around 10 m.6 Furthermore, cognitive
radio may want to communicate with the identiﬁed communication systems in
some applications. For radio identiﬁcation, feature extraction and classiﬁca-
tion techniques are used in the context of European Transparent Ubiquitous
Terminal (TRUST) project [38]. The goal is to identify the presence of some
known transmission technologies and achieve communication through them.
The two main tasks are Initial Mode Identiﬁcation (IMI) and Alternative
Mode Monitoring (AMM). In IMI, the cognitive device searches for a possi-
ble transmission mode (network) following the power on. AMM is the task
of monitoring other modes while cognitive device is having communication in
a certain mode. Some of the proposed methods for blind radio identiﬁcation
are shown in Table 9.1. Several features are extracted from the received signal
and they are used for selecting the most probable primary user technology by
employing various classiﬁcation methods.
9.3.6 Other Sensing Methods
Other alternative spectrum sensing methods include multitaper spectral
estimation, wavelet transform-based estimation, Hough transform, and time-
frequency analysis. Multitaper spectrum estimation is proposed in [43]. The
proposed algorithm is shown to be an approximation to maximum likelihood
PSD estimator, and for wideband signals, it is nearly optimal. Although the

complexity of this method is less than the maximum likelihood estimator, it is
still computationally demanding. Random Hough transform of received signal
is used in [44] for identifying the presence of radar pulses in the operating
channels of IEEE 802.11 systems. This method can be used to detect any
type of signals with periodic patterns as well. In [45], wavelets are used for
detecting edges in the PSD of a wideband channel. Once the edges, which
correspond to transitions from occupied band to empty band or vice versa,
are detected, the power within bands between two edges are estimated. Using
this information and edge positions, the PSD can be characterized as occupied
or empty in a binary fashion. The assumptions made in [45], however, need
to be relaxed for building a practical sensing algorithm.
9.4 Cooperative Sensing
The estimation of traﬃc in a speciﬁc geographic area can be done locally
(by one cognitive radio only) or information from diﬀerent cognitive radios

274
H¨useyin Arslan and Tevﬁk Y¨ucek
can be combined. In the literature, cooperation is discussed as a solution to
problems that arise in spectrum sensing due to noise uncertainty, fading, and
shadowing. Cooperative sensing decreases the probability of mis-detections
and the probability of false alarms considerably. In addition, cooperation can
solve the hidden primary user problem and can decrease sensing time [13,27,
28].
The interference to primary users caused by cognitive radio devices emp-
loying spectrum access mechanisms based on simple Listen-Before-Talk (LBT)
scheme is investigated in [29] via analysis and computer simulations. Results
show that even simple local sensing can be used to explore the unused spec-
trum without causing interference to existing users. On the other hand, it is
shown analytically and through numerical results that collaborative sensing
provides signiﬁcantly higher spectrum capacity gains than local sensing. The
fact that cognitive radio acts without any knowledge about the location of
the primary users in local sensing degrades the performance.
The challenges of cooperative sensing include developing eﬃcient informa-
tion sharing algorithms and increased complexity [46]. The advantages and
disadvantages of local and cooperative (or collaborative) sensing methods are
tabulated in Table 9.2.
In cooperative sensing architectures, the control channel can be imp-
lemented using diﬀerent methodologies. These include a dedicated band,
unlicensed band such as ISM, and underlay Ultra Wideband (UWB) system
[47]. Depending on the system requirements, one of these methods can be
selected. The shared information can be soft or hard decisions made by each
cognitive device [48]. Furthermore, various techniques for combining sensing
results can be employed. The performances of Equal Gain-Combining (EGC),
Selection Combining (SC), and Switch and Stay Combining (SSC) are inves-
tigated in [22] for energy detector-based spectrum sensing under Rayleigh
fading. The EGC method is found to have a gain of approximately two

orders of magnitude while SC and SSC having one order of magnitude gain.
As far as the networking is concerned, the coordination algorithm should have
reduced protocol overhead and it should be robust to changes and failures in
the network. Moreover, the coordination algorithm should introduce minimum
amount of delay.
Cooperative sensing can be implemented in two fashions: centralized or
distributed [49]. These two methods will be explained in the following sections.
Centralized Sensing
In centralized sensing, a central unit collects sensing information from cogni-
tive devices, identiﬁes the available spectrum, and broadcasts this information
to other cognitive radios or directly controls the cognitive radio traﬃc.
The hard (binary) sensing results are gathered at a central place which
is known as Access Point (AP) in [28]. The goal is to mitigate the fading
eﬀects of the channel and increase detection performance. Resulting detection
and false alarm rates are given in [50] for the sensing algorithm used in [28].
In [48], the sensing results are combined in a central node, termed as mas-
ter node, for detecting TV channels. Hard and soft information combining
methods are investigated for reducing the probability of missed opportunity.
The results presented in [28, 48] show that soft information-combining out-
performs hard information-combining method in terms of the probability of
missed opportunity.
Distributed Sensing
In the case of distributed sensing, cognitive nodes share information among
each other but they make their own decisions as to which part of the spectrum
they can use. Distributed sensing is more advantageous in the sense that there
is no need for a backbone infrastructure.
An incremental gossiping approach termed as GUESS (Gossiping Updates
for Eﬃcient Spectrum Sensing) is proposed in [51] for performing eﬃcient
coordination between cognitive radios in distributed collaborative sensing.
The proposed algorithm is shown to have low-complexity with reduced pro-
tocol overhead. The GUESS algorithm has fast convergence and robust to
network changes as it does not require a setup phase to generate the clus-
ters. Incremental aggregation and randomized gossiping algorithms are also
studied in [51] for eﬃcient coordination within a cognitive radio network. A
distributed collaboration algorithm is proposed in [28]. The collaboration is
performed between two secondary users. The user closer to primary trans-
mitter, which has a better change of detecting the primary user transmis-
sion, cooperates with a far away user. An algorithm for pairing secondary
users without a centralized mechanism is also proposed. A distributed sensing
method is proposed in [8] where secondary users share their sensing informa-
tion among themselves. Only ﬁnal decisions are shared in order to minimize

276
H¨useyin Arslan and Tevﬁk Y¨ucek
the network overhead due to collaboration. A secondary user receives deci-
sions from other users and decides H1 if any of the received decisions plus its
own is H1, a fusion rule known as OR-rule. The results presented in [8] clearly
show the performance improvements achieved through collaborative sensing.
9.5 External Sensing
Another technique for obtaining spectrum information is external sensing.
In external sensing, an external agent performs the sensing and broadcasts
the channel occupancy information to cognitive radios. External sensing
algorithms solve some problems associated with the internal sensing, which
is termed as collocated sensing in [18]. The main advantages are overcoming
hidden primary user problem as well as the uncertainty due to shadowing and
fading. Furthermore, as the cognitive radios do not spend time for sensing,
spectrum eﬃciency is increased. The sensing network does not need to be
mobile and not necessarily powered by batteries. Hence, power consumption
problem of internal sensing can also be addressed.
A sensor node detector architecture is used in [52]. The presence of passive
receivers, viz. television receivers, is detected by measuring the Local Oscil-
lator (LO) power leakage. Once a receiver and the channel is detected, the
sensor node notiﬁes cognitive radios in the region of passive primary user via
a control channel. Similar to [52], a sensor network-based sensing architecture
is proposed in [18]. A dedicated network composed of only spectrum sensing
units is used to sense the spectrum continuously or periodically. The results
are communicated to a sink (central) node which further processes the sensing
data and shares the information about the spectrum occupancy in the sensed
area with opportunistic radios. These opportunistic radios use the information
obtained from sensing network for selecting the bands (and time durations)
of their data transmissions. The sensing results can also be shared via a pilot
channel similar to Network Access And Connectivity Channel (NACCH) [53].
External sensing is one of the methods proposed for identifying primary users
in IEEE 802.22 standard as well (see Section 9.10).
9.6 Statistical Approaches and Prediction
For minimizing interference to primary users while making the most out of the
opportunities, cognitive radios should keep track of the variations in spectrum
and should make predictions. Stemming from the fact that cognitive radio
senses the spectrum steadily and has the ability of learning, the history of the
spectrum usage information can be used for predicting the future proﬁle of
the spectrum. Towards this goal, knowledge about currently active devices or
prediction algorithms based on statistical analysis can be used.

9 Spectrum Sensing for Cognitive Radio Applications
277
Channel access patterns of primary users are identiﬁed and used for
predicting spectrum usage in [54]. Assuming a TDMA transmission, peri-
odicity pattern of channel occupancy is extracted using cyclostationary de-
tection. This parameter is then used to forecast the channel idle probability
for a given channel. Furthermore, [54] proposes to use Hidden Markov Models
(HMMs) in order to model the channel usage patterns of primary users. A mul-
tivariate time series approach is taken in [55] to be able to learn the primary
user characteristics and predict the future occupancy of neighboring channels.
A binary scheme (empty or occupied) is used to reduce the complexity and
storage requirements as shown in Figure 9.4. It is noted in [11] that the sta-
tistical model of primary users behavior should be kept simple enough to be
able to design optimal higher order protocols. On the other hand, it will be
useless if the primary user’s behavior could not be predicted well. In order to
strike a balance between complexity and eﬀectiveness, continuous-time semi-
Markov process model is used to describe the statistical characteristics of
WLAN channels that can be used by cognitive radio to predict transmission
opportunities. The investigation of VoIP and FTP-type traﬃc scenarios for
semi-Markov model is performed in [12]. Pareto, phase-type (hyper-Erlang)
and mixture distributions are used for ﬁtting to the empirical data. Statis-
tics of spectrum availability is employed in [24] for dynamically selecting the
operating frequency, i.e. for identifying the spectrum holes. The statistics of
the spectral occupancy of a bin (FFT output) is assumed to be at least piece-
wise stationary over the time at which they are observed in order to guar-
antee that these statistics are still reliable when a spectrum access request is
received. Using the statistics, the likelihood that the spectral opportunity will
remain available for at least the requested time duration is calculated for each
bin. Then, these likelihood values are used to identify the range of frequencies
which can be used for transmission.

9.7 Sensing Frequency
Sensing frequency, i.e. how often cognitive radio should perform spectrum
sensing, is a design parameter that needs to be chosen carefully. The opti-
mum value depends on the capabilities of cognitive radio itself and temporal
characteristics of primary users in the environment. If the status of primary
users are known to change slowly, sensing frequency can be relaxed. A good
example for such a scenario is detection of TV channels. The presence of a TV
station usually do not change frequently in a geographical area unless a new
station starts broadcasting or an existing station goes oﬄine. Another fac-
tor that aﬀects the sensing frequency is the interference tolerance of primary
license owners. For example, when the cognitive radio is exploiting opportuni-
ties in public safety bands, sensing should be done as frequently as possible in
order to prevent any interference. Cognitive radio should immediately vacate
the band if it is needed by public safety units. In the IEEE 802.22 draft
standard (see Section 9.10), the sensing period is deﬁned as 30 seconds. In
addition to these, the channel detection time, channel move time and some
other timing related parameters are also deﬁned [56].
9.8 Hardware Requirements and Approaches
In this section, several aspects of spectrum sensing from hardware perspective
are investigated. As explained before, one of the main challenges lies on the
requirements of high sampling rate, high resolution ADCs with large dyna-
mic range. This requirement is a result of the need for a wideband sensing.
Cognitive radio should be able to capture and analyze a relatively large
band for identifying spectrum opportunities. Moreover, high speed processing
units (Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) or Field Programmable Gate Arrays
(FPGAs)) are needed for performing computationally demanding signal
processing tasks with relatively low delay.
Sensing can be performed via two diﬀerent architectures: single-radio and
dual-radio [18, 40]. In the single-radio architecture, only a speciﬁc time slot
is allocated for spectrum sensing. As a result of this, only a certain accuracy
can be guaranteed for spectrum sensing results. Moreover, the spectrum ef-
ﬁciency is decreased as some portion of the available time slot is used for
sensing instead of data transmission. The obvious advantage of single-radio
architecture is its simplicity and lower cost. In the dual-radio sensing architec-
ture, one radio chain is dedicated for data transmission and reception while
the other chain is dedicated for spectrum monitoring. The drawback of such
an approach is the increased power consumption and hardware cost. Note
that only one antenna would be suﬃcient for both chains as suggested in [40].
A comparison of advantages and disadvantages of single and dual-radio archi-
tectures is given in Table 9.3. In conclusion, one might prefer one architecture
over the other depending on the available resources, and performance and/or
data rate requirements.

9.9 Multi-dimensional Spectrum Awareness
The deﬁnition of opportunity determines the ways of measuring and exploiting
the spectrum space. The conventional deﬁnition of the spectrum opportunity
which is often referred as “band of frequencies that are not being used by
the primary user of that band at a particular time in a particular geographic
area” [57] only exploits three dimensions of the spectrum space: frequency,
time, and space. The problems stated in the previous section also relates to
sensing the spectrum in these three dimensions. However, there are other
dimensions that need to be explored further for spectrum opportunity. For
example, the code dimension of the spectrum space has not been explored
well in the literature. Therefore, the conventional spectrum sensing algorithms
do not know how to deal with signals that use spread spectrum, time or fre-
quency hopping codes. As a result, these types of signals constitute a major
problem in sensing the spectrum. If the code dimension is interpreted as part
of the spectrum space, this problem can be avoided, and new opportunities
for spectrum usage can be created. Naturally, this will bring about other new
challenges for detection and estimation of this new opportunity. Similarly, the
angle dimension has not been exploited well enough for spectrum opportunity.
It is assumed that the primary users and/or the secondary users are transmit-
ting in all the directions. However, with the recent advances in multi-antenna
technologies, e.g. beam forming, multiple users can be multiplexed into the
same channel at the same time in the same geographical area. In other words,
an additional dimension of spectral space can be created as opportunity. This
will also create new opportunities for spectral estimation, where not only the
frequency spectrum but also the angle of arrivals might need to be estimated.
With these new dimensions, sensing only the frequency spectrum usage falls
short. The radio space with the introduced dimensions can be deﬁned as
“a theoretical hyperspace occupied by radio signals, which has dimensions of
location, angle-of-arrival, frequency, time, and possibly others” [58]. This
hyperspace is called electrospace, transmission hyperspace, radio spectrum
space, or simply spectrum space by various authors, and it can be used to de-
scribe how radio environment can be shared among multiple (primary and/or
secondary) systems [59]. Various dimensions of this space and the correspond-
ing measurement/sensing requirements are summarized in Table 9.4 along

the interference temperature. No interfer-
ence means no primary user transmission in
a local area. However, one needs to be care-
ful because of hidden terminal problem.

information is needed so that secondary
users can synchronize their transmissions
w.r.t. primary users.
The synchronization estimation can be
avoided with long and random code us-
age. However, partial interference in this
case is unavoidable.
The spectrum over a wideband might be
used at a given time through spread spec-
trum or frequency hopping. This does not
mean that there is no availability over this
band. Simultaneous transmission without
interfering with primary users would be
possible in code domain with an orthogo-
nal code with respect to codes that pri-
mary users are using. This requires the
opportunity in code domain, i.e. not only
detecting the usage of the spectrum, but
also determining the used codes, and pos-
sibly multipath parameters as well.

with some representative pictures. Each dimension has its own parameters
that should be sensed for a complete spectrum awareness as indicated in the
Table.
It is of crucial importance to deﬁne such an n-dimensional space for spec-
trum sensing. Spectrum sensing should include the process of identifying
occupancy in all dimensions of the spectrum space and ﬁnding spectrum holes,
or more precisely spectrum space holes. For example, a certain frequency can
be occupied for a given time, but it might be empty in another time. Hence,
temporal dimension is as important as frequency dimension. This example can
be extended to the other dimensions of spectrum space given in Table 9.4. As
a result of this requirement, advanced spectrum sensing algorithms that oﬀer
awareness in multiple dimensions of the spectrum space should be developed.
9.10 Spectrum Sensing in Current Wireless Standards
Recently developed wireless standards has started to include cognitive fea-
tures. Even though it is diﬃcult to expect a wireless standard that is based
on wideband spectrum sensing and opportunistic exploitation of spectrum,
the trend is in this direction. In this section, wireless technologies that req-
uire some sort of spectrum sensing for adaptation or for Dynamic Frequency
Selection (DFS) will be discussed. However, the spectrum knowledge can also
be used to initiate advanced receiver algorithms such as adaptive interference
cancellation [60].
9.10.1 IEEE 802.11k
A proposed extension to IEEE 802.11 speciﬁcation is IEEE 802.11k which
deﬁnes several types of measurements [61]. Some of the measurements include
channel load report, noise histogram report and station statistic report. The
noise histogram report provides methods to measure interference levels that
display all non-802.11 energy on a channel as received by the subscriber unit.
The access point (AP) collects channel information from each mobile unit and
makes its own measurements. This data is then used by the AP to regulate
access to a given channel.
The sensing (or measurement) information is used to improve the traﬃc
distribution within a network as well. WLAN devices usually connects to the
AP that has the strongest signal level. Sometimes, such an arrangement might
not be the optimum and can cause overloading on one AP and underutilization
of others. In 802.11k, when an AP with the strongest signal power is loaded to
its full capacity, new subscriber units are assigned to one of the underutilized
APs. Despite the fact that the received signal level is weaker, the overall
system throughput is better thanks to more eﬃcient utilization of network
resources.

9.10.2 Bluetooth
A new feature, namely Adaptive Frequency Hopping (AFH), is introduced to
Bluetooth standard to reduce interference between wireless technologies shar-
ing the 2.4 GHz unlicensed radio spectrum [62]. In this band IEEE 802.11b/g
devices, cordless telephones, microwave ovens use the same wireless frequencies
as Bluetooth. AFH identiﬁes the transmissions in the ISM band and avoids
their frequencies. Hence, narrow-band interference can be avoided and better
Bit-Error-Rate (BER) performance can be achieved as well as reducing the
transmit power. Figure 9.5 shows an illustrative Bluetooth transmission with
and without AFH. By employing AFH, collusions with Wireless Local Area
Network (WLAN) signals are avoided in this example.
AFH requires a sensing algorithm for determining whether there are other
devices present in the ISM band and whether or not to avoid them. The
sensing algorithm is based on statistics gathered to determine which channels
are occupied and which channels are not occupied. Channel statistics can be
packet-error rate, BER, Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Carrier-
To-Interference Noise Ratio (CINR) or other metrics [63]. The statistics are
used to classify the channel as good, bad, or unknown [62].
9.10.3 IEEE 802.22
IEEE 802.22 standard is known as cognitive radio standard because of the
cognitive features that it has. The standard is still in the development stage.
One of the most distinctive feature of 802.22 standard is its sensing require-
ments [40]. IEEE 802.22-based wireless rural area network (WRAN) devices
sense the TV channels and identify transmission opportunities.
The sensing is envisioned to be based on two stages: fast and ﬁne sens-
ing [56]. In the fast sensing stage, a fast sensing algorithm is employed, e.g.
energy detector. The ﬁne sensing stage is initiated based on the fast sensing
results. Fine sensing involves a more detailed sensing where more powerful
methods are used. Several techniques that have been proposed and included in

284
H¨useyin Arslan and Tevﬁk Y¨ucek
the draft standard include energy detection, waveform-based sensing (PN511
or PN63 sequence detection and/or segment sync detection), cyclostationary
feature detection, and matched ﬁltering. A Base Station (BS) can distribute
the sensing load among Subscriber Stations (SSs). The results are returned
to BS which uses these results for managing the transmissions. Hence, it is a
practical example of centralized collaborative sensing explained in Section 9.4.
Another approach for managing the spectrum in IEEE 802.22 devices is
based on a centralized method for available spectrum discovery. The BSs
would be equipped with a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver which
would allow its position to be reported. The location information would then
be used to obtain the information about available TV channels through a
central server. For low-power devices7 operating in the TV bands, external
sensing is proposed as an alternative technique. These devices periodically
transmit beacons with a higher power level. These beacons are monitored by
IEEE 802.22 devices to detect the presence of such low-power devices which
are otherwise diﬃcult to detect due to the low-power transmission.
9.11 Conclusions
Spectrum is a very valuable resource in wireless communication systems, and
it has been a focal point for research and development eﬀorts over the last
several decades. Cognitive radio, which is one of the eﬀorts in utilization of
the available spectrum more eﬃciently through opportunistic spectrum usage,
become an exciting and promising concept. One of the important elements of
the cognitive radio is sensing the available spectrum opportunities. In this
chapter, various aspects of spectrum sensing task is explained in detail. Sev-
eral sensing methods are studied and collaborative sensing is considered as a
solution to some common problems in spectrum sensing. Hardware aspects of
spectrum sensing and pro-active approaches are given and sensing methods
employed in current wireless systems are discussed. Furthermore, the spectrum
opportunity and spectrum sensing concepts are re-evaluated by considering
diﬀerent dimensions of the spectrum space. The new interpretation of spec-
trum space will create new opportunities and challenges for spectrum sensing
while it will solve some of the traditional problems. Estimating real levels of
usage of the spectrum in multiple dimensions including time, frequency, space,
angle, and code; identifying for opportunities in multiple dimensions including
prediction into the future using past information and making reasoning can
be considered some of these challenges for future research.

10.1 Introduction
Location information has been traditionally used for the positioning systems
to estimate and track the location of a target device or object. The tremendous
growth in the number of mobile users initiates the development of location-
based services, which are mainly based on the positioning systems. Moreover,
the demands on the higher Quality of Service (QoS) such as global mobility
and seamless connectivity from the users as well as wireless network opera-
tors motivate to exploit the utilization of location information in the wireless
networks. Recently, it has been recognized that location-based services are
not the only applications, where the location information can be used, but
also it can be utilized to solve some other issues in the wireless networks.
The applications based on the utilization of location information are folded
under four categories: location-based services, network optimization, trans-
ceiver algorithm development and optimization, and environment characteri-
zation. For instance, location-assisted handover mechanism, routing, drop call
management, and adaptive coverage systems are some examples of network
optimization.
Increasing utilization of location information for diﬀerent applications in
the wireless networks and ever-growing number of mobile users require incor-
porating a location information hierarchy into network structure. Although
some of the existing wireless network structures have a miniature location in-
formation management system, cognitive wireless networks [1–3] are promis-
ing systems that comprehensive location information management systems
(location awareness engine) can be realized. Location information manage-
ment system in cognitive wireless networks is expected to provide location
awareness capability to the cognitive radios and networks. Moreover, it can
provide global mobility and seamless connectivity to large number of mobile
cognitive radios and handle tremendous amount of real-time multimedia traf-
ﬁc. Basically, high quality location-based services can be realized and afore-
mentioned location-based applications can be achieved in cognitive wireless

networks with the introduction of a comprehensive location information man-
agement system to network architecture.
In this chapter, a brief taxonomy of cognitive wireless networks based
on cognition, collaboration, and node diversity criteria is presented. A system
model for the location information management in cognitive wireless networks
that is responsible for obtaining and utilizing location information for diﬀer-
ent applications is proposed. Classiﬁcation of location information along with
an overview of cognitive and legacy location estimation and sensing algo-
rithms are provided. Fundamentals of mobility models and location track-
ing in cognitive wireless networks are discussed. Moreover, great amount of
location-assisted applications for cognitive wireless networks are presented in
details. Privacy concerns due to the utilization and tracking of user location
are addressed and potential solutions are discussed followed by the concluding
remarks.
10.2 Cognitive Wireless Network Model
A model for the location information management system in cognitive wire-
less networks is illustrated in Figure 10.1. According to this model, the mea-
surement and/or sensing devices are used to obtain data from the operational
environments. The acquired data are sent to location information management
system for post-processing, which is embedded in central cognitive engine of
the network and/or the cognitive engine of cognitive radio node. Location
estimation and/or sensing algorithms process the data to determine location
information. Since diﬀerent location estimation and/or sensing methods pro-
vide the estimated and/or sensed location information in diﬀerent coordinate
systems, cognitive engine needs a coordinate system converter to manage the
transition between diﬀerent coordinate systems. Finally, location information
management system utilizes location information for diﬀerent applications
such as location-based services (i.e. positioning and tracking), network opti-
mization, transceiver algorithm optimization, and environment characteriza-
tion. Furthermore, location information management system has a mechanism
to handle mobility and tracking tasks as shown in Figure 10.1. The details of
each of these blocks are discussed in later sections. Cognition, collaboration,
and node diversity are the main criteria that are used to classify cognitive
wireless networks in this chapter. These networks consist of two major parts,
which are central cognitive engine and cognitive nodes. One can think of a
central cognitive engine in cognitive wireless networks like a mobile switch-
ing center with more intelligence in the cellular networks. We consider both
cognitive radio Base Station (BS) and Mobile Station (MS) as a node in this
chapter for the sake of discussion.

10.2.1 Cognition
Partitioning cognition features between central cognitive engine of network
and the cognitive engine of nodes plays key role to classify cognitive wireless
networks. In theory, various types of cognitive wireless networks can be devel-
oped between two extreme cognition limits, which are absolute centralized and
distributed (decentralized) cognition [4]. In the former limit, central cognitive
engine has the full cognition capabilities whereas the nodes possess limited
cognition capabilities. Basically, central cognitive engine can be considered as
the brain and the nodes are the members. On the other hand, the structure is
totally opposite in the absolute distributed cognition case, where the full cog-
nition capability is embedded into the cognitive engine of each node. Note that
this type of network will always have a central cognitive engine to maintain

294
H¨useyin Arslan and Hasari Celebi
network organization regardless of the cognition level of cognitive radio node.
Indeed, the nodes will have more cognition capabilities as the technology
advances. Mankind is a good example to prove this idea. Although the human
being is the most intelligent creature in the universe, there exist organizations
or collective works in every aspects of the life. All of the organizations have a
head, which can be either permanent or interim, to manage relationships bet-
ween the members of organization. On the other hand, ad hoc cognitive radio
network [5] can be considered as a network type between these two cognition
limits.
10.2.2 Collaboration
Cognitive wireless networks can be classiﬁed into three types from the perspec-
tive of collaboration within the network [6,7]. Collaboration can be between
nodes and central cognitive engine of the network and/or between diﬀerent
nodes. Since there is a natural collaboration between central cognitive engine
and cognitive nodes, the following classiﬁcation is based on collaboration of
the nodes. The ﬁrst type is called as cooperative network in which all the
nodes agree on performing the predeﬁned (e.g. cooperative spectrum sensing)
or ideally random tasks collectively. For instance, nodes can collaborate on
estimation of location of the licensed users.
Non-cooperative network is the second type of network in which there are
no collaborations between nodes. For example, all the nodes retrieve their
location information from the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites. On
the other hand, if a group of nodes do and the rest of them do not agree to
collaborate, then this forms the third type of the network that is called as
partially cooperative network. For example, non-cooperative nodes can obtain
their location information from the GPS satellites whereas the rest of them
can estimate their location information by collaborating among themselves.
Ideally, cognitive wireless networks can have the capability to transit from
one type to another type dynamically depending on the collaboration of the
nodes. It is important to note that cognitive radio nodes and cognitive wireless
networks can have a capability to cooperate with the satellites such as in the
case of Assisted-Global Positioning System (A-GPS).
10.2.3 Node Diversity
Based on the node diversity criteria, cognitive wireless networks can be
grouped under two main categories: pure cognitive wireless networks and
mixed cognitive and non-cognitive wireless networks. As the names imply, the
former consists of only cognitive radio nodes and the latter composed of both
cognitive and non-cognitive radio nodes. Pure cognitive wireless networks can
be divided further into two subgroups, which are homogeneous and hetero-
geneous networks. For a given geographical area or cell, all cognitive radio
nodes are identical (they use same waveform) in the homogeneous networks.

10 Location Information Management Systems
295
Fig. 10.2. Illustration of the homogenous pure cognitive wireless networks. Text in
the parentheses shows the instantaneous waveform of each cognitive radio node. CR
stands for cognitive radio node.
For instance, a network consisting of only cognitive Worldwide Interoperabil-
ity for Microwave Access (WiMAX) nodes is an example for the homogeneous
networks, which is illustrated in Figure 10.2. On the other hand, if the given
geographical area or cell consists of mixture of diﬀerent cognitive radio nodes
(i.e. WiMAX base stations, Ultrawideband (UWB) nodes), this type of net-
work is called as heterogeneous network [8]. In this type of network, a mobile
device can roam across the cell borders of the other networks and inter-operate
with the other wireless devices. A representative example of mixed cognitive
and non-cognitive wireless networks is illustrated in Figure 10.3. Notice that in
this type of networks interoperability is an issue. Although cognitive radios can
communicate among themselves and with non-cognitive radios, non-cognitive
radio nodes may not be able to communicate among themselves. Location
information of mobile cognitive radio nodes play important roles to achieve
global mobility and seamless connectivity in cognitive wireless networks. For
instance, mobile cognitive radio node can switch from WLAN to WiMAX
networks as the user leaves home by tracking the location of the user. Note

that, in reality, the heterogeneity of cognitive wireless networks can change
dynamically as well.
10.3 Location Estimation and Sensing
10.3.1 Location Information
The type of location information that needs to be estimated or sensed plays an
important role to determine the complexity of positioning systems. Therefore,
classiﬁcation of location information is needed for cognitive radio technologies.
As a result, a taxonomy of location information for cognitive radios are shown
in Figure 10.4.
In this chapter, the place occupied by a designated user, device or mainly
object is referred as location. The object can be physical or virtual and con-
sequently location information of the object can be either physical or virtual

position [9]. The position term is deﬁned as the coordinates of a single point
in space that represents the location of an object. The physical position of an
object is obvious as the name implies. On the other hand, the virtual posi-
tion is deﬁned as the invisible position (e.g. Internet Protocol (IP) address),
which is relative to some known entity whose physical location may or may
not be precisely known [9]. This type of location information is commonly
encountered in the wired networks such as World Wide Web (WWW) access
networks. For instance, a cognitive radio can log into a remote computer (or
device) through Internet on the other side of the earth, but the geographic
position of that computer may not be known precisely. The position of such
device is referred as virtual position. However, cognitive radio can retrieve
the physical position of the remote computer from the virtual position along
with some additional information. Therefore, virtual position is considered
as a form of physical position in this chapter. Mapping virtual position to
the corresponding physical position already exists in the Internet domain.

298
H¨useyin Arslan and Hasari Celebi
Extracting physical position of a remote device from its virtual position in-
formation can be useful for cognitive radios. Such information can be used to
develop eﬃcient location-assisted routing protocol. Physical position of an ob-
ject can be either absolute or relative. The absolute position is referred to the
complete coordinate knowledge of an object. On the other hand, the relative
position is deﬁned as the position of an object (e.g. cognitive radio device)
relative to another or neighbor objects that do or do not know their absolute
positions [10]. Note that a cognitive radio device can estimate its absolute
position using its relative position along with the absolute position of the
reference device that is used during relative positioning. Absolute position
estimation techniques are more mature and widely used compared to relative
position estimation methods. As a result, cognitive radio device can switch
between absolute and relative position estimation methods depending on the
accuracy requirements. We refer to [10] for the details on relative positioning
techniques and the details on the absolute position estimation and sensing
techniques will be provided in the later sections.
The absolute and relative position of a cognitive radio can be quanti-
ﬁed using coordinate systems. There are numerous global, continental, and
country-speciﬁc reference coordinate systems for absolute position of an obj-
ect such as North American Datum (NAD), European Datum (ED50), Tokyo
Datum (TD), and Earth Centered Fixed (ECF), World Geodetic Systems
(WGS). Each of these reference coordinate systems have various revisions.
Among these, WGS-84 is a well-known standard reference coordinate system,
which is also currently being used by GPS. To achieve interoperability between
these diﬀerent reference coordinate systems, cognitive radios can have coordi-
nate systems converter which is shown in Figure 10.1. For instance, cognitive
radios can employ standard Molodensky datum conversion algorithm [11].
Relative position information can be classiﬁed under four groups of refer-
ence coordinate systems [8]:
• 1-dimensional (1-D): It provides the location of a cognitive radio in a
single axis (x or y or z). For instance, the distance between a transmitter
and a receiver (or two cognitive radios) is a 1-D location information.
This information can be used for the ranging and network authorization
purposes in cognitive wireless networks, which is also currently being used
by many wireless networks. Time parameter can be added to this type of
location information.
• 2-D: It provides the position of a cognitive radio in a plane (i.e. (x, y)).
This type of location information is also estimated by some of the existing
wireless communications systems. Time parameter can be added to this
type of location information, too.
• 3-D: It provides the location of a cognitive radio in three dimensions (x,
y, z). For instance, cognitive wireless networks can have a capability to
estimate the 3-D location of a cognitive radio node.

10 Location Information Management Systems
299
• 4-D: It provides the location of a cognitive radio in four dimensions, which
are x, y, z, and time parameters. This type of information currently is esti-
mated by the GPS receivers for the geolocation applications. For instance,
cognitive radio can estimate its position in the 4-D format by having a
built-in GPS receiver [12].
Notice that the accuracy of reference coordinate system model along with
the resolution of positioning technique that are employed can aﬀect the per-
formance of location-based applications.
10.3.2 Location Estimation vs. Sensing
Recent advances in sensing technologies such as cognitive vision systems [13]
show the feasibility of designing cognitive radios with the sensing capabili-
ties. Cognitive vision systems can convert video signals even into a natural
language text describing the acquired scene state. In the positioning context,
scene analysis method [14, 15] is a promising location sensing technique for
the cognitive radios. Hence, the location of a device or object can be deter-
mined by the estimation and/or sensing techniques. The former techniques
require certain amount of measurements using the measurement devices such
as antenna signals whereas the latter ones require sensing devices such as
video camera to observe or acquire information from the environment. More-
over, the measurement and sensing methods diﬀer in the consequent data
post-processing steps as well, which the former uses the location estimation
algorithms whereas the latter uses the location sensing algorithms.
10.3.3 Location Estimation Approaches
Location estimation methods can be broadly folded under three groups, which
are range-based, range-free, and pattern matching-based schemes. These
schemes are discussed in the following sections.
Range-Based Schemes
In these schemes, precise distance and angle of arrival of signal are mea-
sured to estimate the location information of the target device. Time Of Ar-
rival (TOA), Receive Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), and Angle Of Arrival
(AOA) statistics of the received signal are used for the estimation of location
information.
Range-free Schemes
In this approach, the range or angle of arrival information is not used as
the name implies. This is one of the simplest form of positioning in which
coarse positioning accuracy is provided. There are three main approaches in
this category, which are Hop-count-based (e.g. DV-Hop), Centroid, and Area-
based schemes.

300
H¨useyin Arslan and Hasari Celebi
Pattern Matching-Based Schemes
This approach is based on probabilistic models that describe the dependency
of observed signal properties on the location of the terminal, and the motion
of the terminal. The models are used to estimate the terminals location when
signal measurements are available. The methodology for pattern matching-
based approach is given as follows. The ﬁrst step is calibration that is the
process of obtaining a model of the signal properties at various locations.
Diﬀerent signal properties can be used such as signal strength and power
delay proﬁle. Furthermore, diﬀerent probabilistic model for the speciﬁed signal
properties can be employed. For instance, Bayes and Hidden Markov are well-
known models that can be used for this purpose. For the sake of discussion,
we use Bayes rule [16] in this section. In the sequel, the target area is divided
into a number of grid (i × j) depending on the accuracy requirements. Each
location l is marked with the corresponding coordinates (e.g. xi, yj) as shown
in Figure 10.5. Measurement data are collected from each location l to form
observation vector o. Consequently, probability distribution of o for given any
location l (P(o|l)) is obtained in the calibration phase. In the next step, which
is the location estimation is performed using the following Bayes rule:
P(l|o) = P(o|l)P(l)
P(o)
,
(10.1)
where P(l) is the prior probability of being at location l and this distribu-
tion can be used to incorporate background information such as user proﬁles.
P(o) is the normalizing constant for the case of relative probabilities or prob-
ability ratios. The posterior distribution P(l|o) are used to select an optimal
location estimator. A simple estimator can be to select the location with maxi-
mum P(l|o) for given observation vector. Note that pattern matching-based

301
approaches are useful for not only location estimation but also for active learn-
ing, tracking with history, and error estimation. We refer to [16] for further
details on the pattern matching-based methods. The measurement errors and
noise can result in the incompatibility of the distance and angle estimates
and there is not a structured solution to deal with such problem. This is
one of the main drawbacks of the range-based approach. However, this ap-
proach is computationally more eﬃcient than the pattern matching-based ap-
proach [16]. Cognitive wireless networks can have a capability to support both
approaches and employ them depending on the optimization criteria. Legacy
range-based and pattern matching-based positioning techniques do not pro-
vide the required cognition capability that a cognitive radio demands. Even
the GPS that is being considered for some of the next generation wireless
systems as a positioning technique cannot provide the cognition capability
and ﬂexibility. Furthermore, the GPS is not a solution that can satisfy low-
cost, high-accuracy, low-size, and low-power design requirements [17], which
cognitive radio may require. However, some deﬁciencies of the GPS such as
low-accuracy and indoor inoperability are addressed with the recent advances
in this technology such as the A-GPS [18] and Indoor GPS [19]. For instance,
the A-GPS technology can provide a ranging accuracy of 10 m or less [14]. In
spite of the advances in the GPS technology, it needs more enhancements to
be considered as a practical solution for cognitive radio positioning. Another
alternative solution is UWB positioning, which has the capability to provide
centimeter ranging accuracy due to the use of large bandwidth during the
transmission [20]. The drawback of UWB positioning techniques is that they
can provide such a high-precision positioning within only a short range. How-
ever, UWB and GPS can be combined along with absolute (through GPS)
and relative (through UWB) positioning to obtain high-precision and long-
range location estimation. In [21], a hybrid distance estimation technique for a
legacy positioning system that is based on TOA and signal strength methods
is proposed. The technique provides ﬂexibility to improve the accuracy using
a priori distance information. However, it does not oﬀer a capability to change
the accuracy adaptively.
10.3.4 Legacy Positioning Techniques
Triangulation and proximity are two well-known legacy range-based location
estimation techniques. However, each of them requires additional enhance-
ments in order them to be considered as the candidate positioning systems
for cognitive wireless networks [8,12,22].
Triangulation
Triangulation is one of the most recognized legacy range-based positioning
techniques. The basic idea behind the triangulation is use of geometric prop-
erties of triangles to ﬁnd the location of a device. Lateration and angulation

302
H¨useyin Arslan and Hasari Celebi
are two triangulation techniques, which are discussed brieﬂy in this section.
The lateration techniques use the distance information whereas the angula-
tion ones utilize the distance and angle information together to estimate the
position of a device.
According to the lateration methods, the position of a device is estimated
by measuring its distance from the position of a certain number of reference
devices. The dimension of location information determines minimum number
of reference devices required and the geometric relationship between them. For
instance, distance measurements from three devices (multilateration) that are
located in a non-collinear manner are required to estimate the position of a
device in 2-D as shown in Figure 10.6. On the other hand, 3-D lateration
requires the distance measurements from four non-coplanar devices. As a re-
sult, cognitive wireless networks can optimize the positioning algorithm by
having a priori information about the dimension of the location information.
For instance, the signal traﬃc and power consumption due to the positioning
in cognitive wireless networks can be reduced. There are several lateration
techniques such as TOA and RSSI to estimate the distance from the received
signal.
TOA estimation technique is based on computing the travel time takes bet-
ween a transmitter and receiver. For instance, the GPS utilizes the concept of
one-way TOA ranging to estimate the position. By having the estimated travel

time ˆτ, the distance between a transmitter and receiver ˆd can be estimated
using ˆd = vˆτ, where v is the velocity of the waves used. Various waves such as
electromagnetic and sound waves with diﬀerent velocity can be used during the
transmission by cognitive radios. For instance, the velocity of the sound wave
is 344 m/s whereas the velocity of the light is approximately 3×108 m/s in the
air. As a result, Ultrasound-based positioning systems [23] can be developed
for cognitive radios as well. Therefore, cognitive radio can have a capability to
use diﬀerent waves for the positioning purpose depending on the environments;
underground, underwater [24], and on the ground. For instance, in the case
of emergency, a cognitive radio can utilize acoustic wave to ﬁnd a location of
a victim with cognitive radio device in underwater (due to ﬂooding).
Angulation techniques are based on using angle and distance measure-
ments to estimate the position of a device. The angles are measured with
relative to a reference vector. The location information estimated through the
angulation techniques are also in the form of diﬀerent dimensions. Similar
to the lateration techniques, the number of devices that need to be involved
and their geometric relationships can be determined a priori by knowing the
dimension of the location information. For instance, angle information from
two diﬀerent reference devices and the distance information between both
are required to estimate the location of a device in 2-D format as shown in
Figure 10.7. On the other hand, 3-D angulation requires an elevation infor-
mation in addition to the requirements of 2-D angulation [14].

Proximity
Proximity location estimation technique is one of the simplest forms of the
positioning. The basic idea behind this type of positioning technique is to
use the position of the antenna in a cell as the approximate position of a
device [25]. Each cell is identiﬁed by a Location Area Identiﬁer (LAI) in the
cellular networks. The BS broadcasts the LAI and its Cell-ID to its cells. The
MSs receive these messages and extract the Cell-ID, consequently, they know
their Cell-IDs. The MSs also can determine its actual location information
using the location information of the corresponding BS. Since the device can
be anywhere in the cell, the accuracy depends on the size of cell. As a result,
the accuracy can vary from a few meters (e.g. nanocell) to several kilometers
(e.g. up to 30 km in large macrocell) depending on the cell type. The accu-
racy of the cell proximity can be improved by using additional information.
For instance, in TDMA systems, BS calculates the timing delay between the
MS and itself and sent this timing delay to the MS. In the sequel, the MS
can estimate the distance between the BS and itself [25]. With this distance
information, the MS can determine its location information relative to the
location information of the BS. This method is a low-complex technique and
cognitive wireless networks can use it when a coarse positioning and/or low
computations are required.
10.3.5 Cognitive Positioning Techniques
Alternative to the aforementioned positioning techniques, the methods spe-
ciﬁc to cognitive wireless networks can be developed due to the deﬁciencies of
the legacy positioning systems in terms of providing cognition features such as
ﬂexibility, adaptability, and high QoS. The cognitive positioning systems [12]
and scene analysis [14] are two positioning systems speciﬁc to cognitive wire-
less networks that are discussed in this chapter.
Cognitive Positioning Systems
Cognitive positioning systems allow cognitive radio to adjust the position-
ing accuracy adaptively in both indoor and outdoor environments. A cogni-
tive positioning system is proposed in [12], and this technique is composed
of two modes, which are bandwidth determination and hybrid overlay and
underlay enhanced dynamic spectrum management system. In the ﬁrst mode,
the cognitive positioning system determines the required eﬀective bandwidth
for a given accuracy. Adaptive TOA estimation technique that is an enhanced
version of legacy TOA method is used in this mode. The required eﬀec-
tive bandwidth is determined using the bandwidth determination equation,
which is derived through Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for Additive
White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels. Once the eﬀective bandwidth is
determined, the second mode that is hybrid overlay and underlay enhanced

10 Location Information Management Systems
305
dynamic system is initiated. This is an improved dynamic spectrum manage-
ment system that includes an additional set of rules in order to support pos-
itioning capability of cognitive radio. The main responsibility of the hybrid
overlay and underlay enhanced dynamic is to search, ﬁnd, and provide the
optimum available bandwidth to cognitive positioning systems. Finally, the
speciﬁed relative bandwidth is used to estimate the location using adaptive
TOA technique. The details of these modes and overall technique can be found
in [12].
Scene Analysis
Scene analysis is a location sensing technique that is based on using the fea-
tures of a scene acquired by a sensing device (i.e. video camera) to infer the
location of the observer and the objects in the environments. Not only infor-
mation to be used for the positioning but also for the communication systems
can be extracted using the scene analysis technique. This is one of the en-
abling techniques for cognitive radio to sense the environment. The acquired
scene (such as a snapshot from a digital camera as shown in Figure 10.8)
is simpliﬁed using basic geometric shapes for the data post-processing since
analyzing a scene is a complex and diﬃcult process. There are two popular
scene analysis techniques, which are static and diﬀerential [14]. In the static
method, the simpliﬁed scene is compared with the predeﬁned datasets to draw
conclusions regarding the scene. On the other hand, the location is estimated
Fig. 10.8. A snapshot of Mountain Nemrut acquired by digital camera (Courtesy of
www.kahtanet.com). The objects in the scene can be represented by the geometric
shape to simplify the scene. For instance, the top part of the mountains (Mountain
Nemrut) can be represented by a triangle shape and one of the buildings in the scene
can be represented by rectangular shape.

306

by keeping track of the diﬀerences between the consecutive snapshots from the
scene according to the diﬀerential method. Note that one of the challenges for
the scene analysis technique is the requirement of tremendous amount of dig-
ital data and image processing. For instance, if the position of the objects in
the environments change there can be a need to construct new datasets to
represent the objects. Another disadvantage of the scene analysis technique is
that the device needs to have an access to a library for the features of environ-
ments. Legacy wireless devices do not have such capability. However, cognitive
radio has potential to have such access to the predeﬁned dataset of feature
of environments stored either in central cognitive engine of the network or in
the Internet.
10.3.6 Implementation Options
Depending on the choice of implementations, there are two approaches to
estimate position of a device. The ﬁrst approach is based on cognitive radio
node, which is determining its location information. This approach is referred
as Decentrelized (Self) Positioning. The second approach is based on cog-
nitive wireless networks, which is determining the location information of
target cognitive radio node using central cognitive engine. This approach is
so-called Centralized (Remote) Positioning. These two approaches are discus-
sed as follows.
Decentrelized (Self) Positioning
Cognitive radio device can estimate its own location information either inde-
pendently or collaboratively using location estimation and/or sensing meth-
ods. For instance, cognitive radio can employ the scene analysis to sense its
location independently. In the case of collaboration, cognitive radio can have
a GPS receiver that collaborates with the satellites or it can request the dis-
tance measurements from the reference devices in cognitive wireless networks
or terrestrial networks to estimate its location.
Centralized (Remote) Positioning
The location of a cognitive radio can be estimated using aforementioned posi-
tioning techniques such as distance measurements between the certain number
of reference devices in cognitive wireless networks or terrestrial networks and
the target cognitive radio. The measurements from the reference nodes are
collected and processed by central cognitive engine of network. The position
of target cognitive radio can be obtained from the geometric relationship (i.e.
triangulation) between the devices that involve.

10.4 Mobility Management
Mobility management in cognitive wireless networks enables diﬀerent cogni-
tive wireless networks and legacy wireless networks to interconnect by means
of a global interoperability. It can be achieved by integrating all access net-
works to an IP core network, which can be based on an enhanced Mobile-IP
architecture. Moreover, enhanced Mobile-IP protocols support vertical hand-
oﬀs in the heterogenous cognitive wireless networks to provide a seamless con-
nectivity. For instance, a Voice over IP (VoIP) call made by cognitive radio
users can switch from the wireless metropolitan area network (e.g. WiMAX
MS) to the wireless personal area network (e.g. UWB or Bluetooth devices)
through the wireless local area network (e.g. WLAN access point) infrastruc-
ture as they drive to work and then walk to their oﬃces. Two important
elements of the mobility management in cognitive wireless networks, mobility
models, and location tracking, are discussed in this section.
10.4.1 Mobility Models
Utilization of location information in cognitive wireless networks for diﬀerent
applications will have a major impact on system complexity. Introduction
of such additional services and applications into cognitive wireless networks
will exacerbate the mobility issues. Consequently, the system capacity and
implementation cost can be aﬀected by these issues. Therefore, it is desirable
to develop an accurate mobility model during the network planning phase.
There are several common models that can be used to describe the mobility
of mobile cognitive radio users, which are mainly derived from the human
movement behavior [26].
Fluid Flow Model
As the name implies, the network traﬃc is modeled based on the idea of
ﬂow of a ﬂuid, which is used to describe the macroscopic movement behav-
ior. According to this model, the amount of traﬃc ﬂowing out of a region is
proportional to the population density within the region, the average velocity,
and the region boundary length. Diﬀusion model is an advanced ﬂuid model
that characterizes the ﬂow of traﬃc as a diﬀusion process [26].
Random-walk (Markovian-walk) Model
In this model, geographical area is divided into the grids (i.e. cells) and
assuming a cognitive radio user can move from one cell to another cell with-
out crossing the third cell. In order to model the movement of cognitive radio
users in cognitive wireless networks, it is assumed that the time is slotted and
a user can make at most one move during a slot. The movements of cognitive

308
H¨useyin Arslan and Hasari Celebi
radio user is assumed to be a Markov random process and independent from
one user to another in this model. According to the Markovian-walk model,
the user can be in one of the three states, which are stationary (S), right-move
(R), and left-move (L), during a slot. However, additional states such as back-
move and cross-move can be introduced to extend the model. For instance, if
a cognitive radio user is in the cell n according to the previous slot i −1, the
next state determines the movement of the user during the slot i as follows:
• if the next state is S, then it remains in cell n,
• if the next state is R then it moves to cell n+1 (the cell on the right-hand
side of the cell n),
• if the next state is L then it moves to cell n −1 (the cell on the left-hand
side of the cell n).
Let assume that X(t) is the state during the slot t and {X(t)|t = 0, 1, ...} is
a Markov chain with the following transition probability function:
Pi,j = P[X(t + 1) = j|X(t) = i] ,
∀t ,
(10.2)
where i = {S, R, L}, j = {S, R, L}, and P[·] represents the probability
function. The state diagram of the Markovian-walk model is illustrated in
Figure 10.9 [26]. There are three common location reporting strategies, which
are time-based, movement-based, and distance-based location update. In time-
based update, each cognitive radio user reports a message containing its loca-
tion update every predeﬁned number of slots whereas this update is performed
by each cognitive radio user at every completion of predeﬁned number of move-
ments between the cells in the movement-based strategy. On the other hand,
each cognitive radio user transmits the location update message every prede-
ﬁned amount of distance in terms of number of cells, which is deﬁned as the
distance between the current and the last reported cells in the distance-based

10 Location Information Management Systems
309
update [26]. Depending on the trade-oﬀs between the complexity and perfor-
mance of cognitive wireless networks, one or combination of these strategies
can be utilized.
Gravity Model
Gravity models have been used to model the traﬃc in the regions of various
sizes such as city, national, and international models. The amount of traﬃc
Tij moving from the region i to region j is formulated by
Tij = KijDiDj,
(10.3)
where Di and Dj are the population in region i and j, respectively. Moreover,
Kij is the parameter that describes the characteristics of the traﬃc movement
between the region i and region j and it has to be computed for all (i, j)
combinations. For instance, Kij can be equal to d−2
ij , which is analogous to
the Newton gravitational law [26].
Mobility traces are useful tools that can indicate the current movement
behavior of mobile cognitive radio users and are more realistic than the mobil-
ity models. Three diﬀerent scales are commonly used for the mobility traces
of the large population sizes and geographical areas, which are metropolitan,
national, and international mobility models. Further details on the mobility
models and traces can be found in [26].
10.4.2 Location Tracking
Once location information is estimated and/or sensed using the previously
mentioned methods, then tracking cognitive mobile devices is another main
task in cognitive wireless networks. The location of a mobile cognitive radio
device can be tracked using successive range-based and pattern matching-
based approaches. However, the latter approaches are more widely used than
the former ones. The pattern matching-based methods are mainly based on
learning process, which requires successive collection of statistics from mobile
cognitive radio nodes on their movement behaviors. Location tracking process
is usually modeled as a hidden Markov model and it is characterized by ﬁve
elements [27]:
• Number of hidden states N. Hidden state variables L = {lt, lt+1, . . . ,
lt+N−1} are indexed by time t + j and state at t + j is denoted as qt+j.
In the context of the location tracking, the hidden states lt+j correspond
to the location of a cognitive radio device at time t + j and the sequence
of the states corresponds to the trajectory of cognitive radio device.
• Number of distinct observation symbols per state M. These symbols are
denoted as S = {S0, S1, ..., SM−1}. The observed variable for each hidden
state is denoted as O = {Ot, Ot+1, ..., Ot+N−1}. Each Ot is assumed to be
dependent only on the current location lt.

• Initial state probability πi, which is deﬁned as

(10.5)
The hidden Markov model for location tracking is illustrated in Figure 10.10.
With this model, probability distribution of location of cognitive radio device
at any given time can be determined for a given series of observations [16].
In [28], a location tracking algorithm based on hybrid TOA and hidden Markov
models to estimate the driven route of a vehicle in the cellular networks is
proposed. Similar location tracking algorithms can be developed for cognitive
wireless networks as well.
10.5 Applications
10.5.1 Location-Based Services
Location-based services have been gaining an increasing popularity and they
are becoming part of our daily lives. These services found applications in
diﬀerent areas such as for personal, commercial, governmental, and military
purposes. Some representative location-based services for the personal pur-
pose are navigation systems for sightless people, tracking systems for parents
to monitor children in the residential and school areas, navigation systems to
guide travelers (i.e. locate restaurants and hotels) and tourists during travels.
Some of the many commercial location-based services are tracking vehicles
on the roads, monitoring employees in the oﬃces and ﬁnding the location
of on-demand equipments in the industrial areas, supervising patients in the
hospitals, and tracking animals in the wildlife conservation areas and farms.

10 Location Information Management Systems
311
For instance, one of the products of Qualcomm, which is called SnapTrack,
has capability to provide some of the above location-based services [29]. More-
over, the Google Maps for mobile phone allows the users to obtain the det-
ailed directions for their destinations and track the traﬃc in real-time for the
selected routes [30].
Location-based services also can be used by the government agencies such
as to ﬁnd the location of the victims and rescue them in the case of emer-
gency and disaster (i.e. E911 in the United States and E112 in the Europe).
Moreover, location-based services can be utilized for military applications such
as tracking soldiers during the combat missions. In short, countless location-
based services can be developed for diﬀerent purposes.
10.5.2 Network Optimization
Numerous location-aided network optimization applications can be developed
such as location-assisted dynamic spectrum management, network upgrade,
handover, drop call management, dynamic channel allocation, routing, power
control, internetworking, and adaptive coverage system. However, we discuss
the ﬁrst four applications with details in this section.
Location-Assisted Dynamic Spectrum Management
Under-utilization of the licensed bands and spectral crowdness in the license-
exempt bands prompt the concept of using the spectrum in an opportunistic
manner. Basically, in the absence of licensed users that have the privileges
to use their bands, unlicensed users can utilize these bands temporarily. This
can be achieved by using overlay and/or underlay spectrum access techniques.
There are several diﬀerent proposals for the dynamic spectrum management
in cognitive wireless networks from the academia and industry. However, we
consider three schemes proposed by the Federal Communications Commis-
sion (FCC) in the United States, which are Listen-before-talk, Geolocation-
database, and Local Beacon techniques [31]. These schemes are proposed for
allowing unlicensed operation in the TV bands while preventing interference to
the television (TV) reception. Moreover, a recently formed IEEE 802.22 work-
ing group for the Wireless Regional Area Networks (WRANs) has the same
vision as the FCC. The main goal of this group is to establish a cognitive radio-
based standard that allows unlicensed users to utilize the bands allocated to
the TV broadcast services in a non-interfering fashion. It is worth to men-
tion that low frequency analog TV bands (54–862 MHz) have some attractive
features for wireless broadband services such as achieving long-distance trans-
mission. Since the Geolocation-database and Local Beacon techniques utilize
the location information, the other technique is out of scope of this section.
However, it is worth to mention the main concern regarding the Listen-before-
talk scheme, which is the hidden node problem [31].

312
H¨useyin Arslan and Hasari Celebi
According to Geolocation-database scheme, licensed users (i.e. TV trans-
mitter) are equipped with location estimation and/or sensing device to
estimate their current location information. Licensed users provide their fre-
quency and location information to the FCC central database, which is a part
of central cognitive engine. The FCC database broadcasts the available chan-
nel information along with the location information of licensed users. On the
other hand, unlicensed users are also equipped with location estimation and/or
sensing device to estimate their current locations. Unlicensed users cross-check
their locations with the location of licensed users in order to obtain the chan-
nel information that they can use locally. Two concerns regarding this scheme
are the reliability of current geolocation technologies and the performance of
the FCC central database. Some TV broadcasters point out that GPS does
not provide a reliable location information of a user that is located in the in-
door environments. However, this concern can be addressed by use of Indoor
GPS. Alternatively, licensed users and unlicensed users can utilize more reli-
able cognitive positioning techniques such as cognitive positioning system to
obtain their current location information. The other concern is that the FCC
central databases can be slow to catch up the frequency changes and they are
not 100% reliable. This is a valid concern and the FCC is aware of this issue.
As a result, the FCC needs to upgrade its database technology in order to be
used for the spectrum sensing and allocation purposes.
Local Beacon method is pretty similar to the Geolocation-database scheme
except that the database will be placed in a local cell to manage the spec-
trum. The details and example of local Geolocation-database approach can
be found in [8]. The FCC states that short-range signal will be used in this
method to broadcast the available channel information. Since the FCC does
not specify the “short-range signal” term, long-range signal can be used and
they can introduce interferences to the other cells. Consequently, such signals
can degrade performance of this scheme signiﬁcantly and even it can shut
down the system.
Location-Assisted Network Upgrade
Network design is usually thought of as the initial phase of the network build
out, however, it is an ongoing work that is needed to upgrade the capacity and
optimize the network. From a design point of view, revenue, license, capacity,
and performance are the main criteria that are used to make decisions for the
network expansion. Last two criteria are considered in this section since they
possess technical merits.
The current wireless network operators plan and expand their networks in
a semi-computerized manner. They have a group of design engineers that are
responsible for the network planning and expansion. The network expansion
is determined based on the measurement data that is obtained from a spe-
ciﬁc geographical area. Such data are generally collected by driving a vehicle

10 Location Information Management Systems
313
equipped with the measurement instruments within the target areas. The engi-
neers map the collected data to the morphology tables, which are used to help
them to predict the traﬃc intensity and consequently the capacity in the var-
ious areas. The engineers carefully study the tables and perform area visits
regularly to achieve an optimal capacity prediction. This is a critical part in
the initial design and expansion phases of the network. Over-prediction can
cause an ineﬃcient use of resources (i.e. hardware and spectrum) whereas
under-prediction can aﬀect the QoS provided by the network.
Cognitive wireless networks have a potential to perform network plan-
ning and expansion procedure automatically. In this approach, cognitive radio
nodes are equipped with location estimation and/or sensing devices. Central
cognitive engine can request or cognitive radio nodes can report the informa-
tion that is beneﬁcial for the network planning, expansion, and optimization
along with their location information. This information can be also incidents
for the drop call or deep fading. Further information on location-assisted net-
work upgrade for cognitive wireless networks can be found in [8].
Location-Assisted Handover
Handover mechanism is an important mechanism that can aﬀect the perfor-
mance of the legacy cellular as well as cognitive wireless networks. In [32], a
location-based handover algorithm is proposed for the GSM networks and the
performance of the conventional handover mechanisms (i.e. RSSI-based hand-
over) and the proposed handover algorithms are compared. The measurement
results show that the location-based handover provides 30% reduction in the
number of handovers compare to the RSSI-based handover for a given call.
The majority of the current handover mechanisms are based on only signal
strength, signal quality and cell traﬃc parameters due to some complexity
limitations. There can be situations where the number of competing cells is
large. This scenario can be, for example, a long bridge over a water surface
such as a bridge on highway 60 in Tampa, Florida as shown in Figure 10.11.
Here we have a long road and due to the fact that signal propagates fur-
ther over the water, many cells will appear as attractive candidates for the
neighbor selection. The problem here is that optimizing handover margins
will not help since we want to control the handover along highway 60 only
(in this example). If we make handover hard to certain sites, it will aﬀect the
handovers in the diﬀerent areas in which case we have partially solved one
problem, but created additional ones. For instance, the number of handover
decisions can increase in the other areas and this can aﬀect the amount of
overhead in the network and the computational power that is needed.
As the QoS requirements increase, the current handover algorithms such
as RSSI-based handover start to lag. Therefore, they can be replaced with
more eﬃcient handover algorithms such as location-assisted handover method,
which is based on use of the location information of MSs. In [8], a location-
assisted handover mechanism for cognitive wireless networks is proposed to

314

a real life geographical area (a bridge), where the number of competing cells are
large during the handover process and it is diﬃcult to manage handover mechanism
in such areas. The location-assisted handover algorithms are promising methods to
optimize the handover mechanisms in such problematic areas.
reduce the number of handovers and consequently the network load. In this
algorithm, the handover zones in which all the MSs are served by the prede-
ﬁned candidates are deﬁned. The MSs are equipped with location estimation
and/or sensing devices to report their locations back to the MSC. Once a MS
enters into a handover zone, the MS can be served by one of the predeﬁned
candidates. We refer to [8] for the details of the location-assisted handover
mechanism for cognitive wireless networks.
Location-Assisted Drop Call Management
Drop call is another important issue that can aﬀect the QoS of wireless net-
works. The drop call occurs when the call in progress is terminated unexpect-
edly due to some technical reasons. The reasons that cause the drop calls can
be classiﬁed under three major categories, which are air-interface, hardware,
and handover issues and the distribution of these issues for the cellular net-
works is shown in Figure 10.12. It has been reported that the main factor
that produces the drop calls is the air-interface issues (58.33% according to
the Figure 9). For instance, one of the air-interface issues that creates the drop
call is the poor coverage or moving out of range of a wireless network. In other
words, an active call can be lost when the users move out to the areas where
the communications is unavailable, interrupted, interfered with, or jammed.
Co-channel and adjacent channel interferences are some other reported reasons
that can cause the drop calls. The neighbor cells using the same frequencies in-
terfere with each other resulting in drop calls as well. Moreover, sun spots and

networks. The abis interface within the GSM architecture is the interface between

solar ﬂares are rarely reported to be the reasons for causing the interference
leading to dropped calls.
Another main category that produces the drop calls is the hardware issues
such as transmission problems and faulty hardware components in the mobile
phone or base station. Calls also can be lost if the mobile phone runs out of
the power and consequently stops to transmit.
The drop calls can occur due to handover issues, which is the third main
category. The calls can be dropped during the handover process due to the
various reasons such as the imbalance traﬃc between the cell sites and im-
proper network conﬁguration. For instance, if the target cell is running out
of its capacity, it can not accept the additional users requesting admission
during the handover process. In such scenarios, the calls are dropped as well.
Furthermore, if the mobile phone tries to handover to a target cell that is not
aware of such mobile phone and the phone can not ﬁnd out an alternative
target cell to move in, then the call will be lost.
The drop call management in the existing cellular networks is often as
follows. Anytime a customer calls to complain about drop call, a support
professional ﬁrst validates the complaint and then tries to get as much in-
formation as possible about the location of the incident. The tickets that are
generated by the agents are sent to the network engineers, who in turn will
position them on the maps for further analysis. The main drawback of this
approach is that the majority of the customers do not take the time to report
the problems they experience in the ﬁeld and hence, a lot of information is

not fed back into the drop call management system. One issue here would be
how can the network know or even predict the reason and the place of the
drop call. That is, during the drop call the connection is lost between the
mobile phone and the network and hence it is diﬃcult to gather intelligent
information from the mobile phone at the time the drop calls happen.
The drop call management in cognitive wireless networks can be auto-
mated and consequently location-assisted drop call management systems can
be developed. The reason and location information for the drop call inci-
dents are two important parameters that aﬀect the complexity of the location-
assisted drop call management systems. Cognitive wireless networks can have
a capability to determine the reason and location of the incidents. Note that
the location information is not necessarily to be estimated for all the drop
call incidents. Basically, the reason of the incidents determine whether the
location information needs to be estimated or not. For instance, the location
information is not necessary for the case of the hardware issues that cause the
drop calls. Therefore, the reason of the incidents is determined initially. It is
diﬃcult to identify the reason if the several issues (i.e. running out of power
and poor coverage) occur at the same time. Once, cognitive radio nodes deter-
mine the reason of the incidents, then they report back the reason along with
the location information if necessary to central cognitive engine of the net-
work for further analysis in a cooperative manner. Central cognitive engine
classiﬁes the incidents depending on their reasons. For a duration of time,
the information regarding the drop calls are accumulated and central cogni-
tive engine monitors the incidents, basically it tries to learn behavior of the
incidents. Based on the accumulated information and using statistical predic-
tion and estimation techniques, central cognitive engine can predict ahead of
time the reason and location of the drop calls and consequently initiate the
drop call avoidance or suppression algorithms. Numerous solutions for each
reason to predict and avoid or reduce the drop calls can be developed. Alter-
natively, the information regarding the drop call problems can be sent to the
aforementioned location-assisted network planning and expansion system to
optimize the network in order to avoid or reduce the drop calls.
Cognitive radio nodes can monitor the hardware components such as bat-
tery life, the handover mechanism, and air-interface in order to predict the
drop call. For instance, the battery life is monitored and if the power level goes
below a predeﬁned limit, then cognitive radio warns its user that drop call can
occur within the estimated time. Moreover, cognitive radio sends this informa-
tion to central cognitive engine as a feedback to let it know that the battery
most likely will be the reason if the call is dropped. Let us assume that cog-
nitive radio node has enough battery life, cognitive wireless network does not
experience any air-interface issue that can lead to a drop call, and central cog-
nitive engine monitors the handover mechanism. If the drop call occurs, then
it will be reported that the drop call happens most likely (i.e. the probability
can be speciﬁed) due to the handover mechanism. Optimizing the handover
mechanism such as by employing the previously discussed location-assisted

10 Location Information Management Systems
317
handover can avoid or reduce the drop calls. Similarly, assuming that cognitive
radio node has enough battery life and it does not need to perform a han-
dover, then cognitive radio can predict and avoid the drop calls (or reduce
the number of drop calls) by employing the location-assisted drop call man-
agement system. For instance, if the user is moving toward out of range of
the network, cognitive radio can warn the users ahead of time that the drop
call can happen within the estimated time or distance. Same information is
sent to central cognitive engine as a feedback. If the user responds that he/she
must go that area, then diﬀerent solutions can be developed to avoid the drop
calls. For instance, cognitive radio can inform central cognitive engine (or
serving cognitive base station) that the cell coverage needs to be extended by
the estimated distance to maintain the communications. The serving cogni-
tive base station increases its coverage towards the speciﬁed area where the
user is located (i.e. by having a beamforming capability). The location of the
user is tracked to adaptively change the coverage. This algorithm is so called
location-assisted adaptive coverage algorithm, which is part of the location-
assisted drop call management system. Note that the location-assisted drop
call management system is embedded in each cognitive radio node in the case
of decentralized cognitive wireless networks.
10.5.3 Transceiver Algorithm Optimization
Utilization of location information for improving and optimizing transceiver
algorithms is a current research topic. We brieﬂy discuss several location-
assisted transceiver algorithms such as ranging, beamforming and interfer-
ence avoidance, and link adaptation. However, more location-aided transceiver
algorithm can be developed.
Location-Assisted Adaptive Beamforming and Interference
Avoidance
Adaptive beamforming consists of adaptive array whose outputs are combined
based on adjustable weight vector to radiate the transmit signal to the desired
user while minimizing the interference to the other users [33]. There are two
major challenges in the legacy beamforming systems; estimation of the coeﬃ-
cients of arrays from the received signal and minimization of interference that
is created during the radiation of the beam. The coeﬃcients of elements in
the arrays are estimated mainly based on the direction of arrival and strength
of the signal that comes from the desired user. However, the received signal is
distorted by the other interference signals that comes from the undesired users
as well as the background noise. It is a tedious task to estimate the element
coeﬃcients from the distorted signal. Since the direction of the desired user
is precisely not known, the radiated power can interfere the neighbor users.

318
H¨useyin Arslan and Hasari Celebi
The beam is generated in such a way to minimize the interference to the other
users. For instance, one way of doing that is to place nulls in the interfering
directions [33].
The aforementioned problems can be eliminated by introducing location-
assisted adaptive beamforming and interference avoidance algorithms to the
cognitive radios. The ﬁrst problem is eliminated since the explicit absolute
location information of the desired user can be obtained easily through the
positioning systems such as GPS. Since cognitive radio that generates the
beam can obtain its absolute location information as well, it directs the beam
to the desired user precisely. The width of the beam plays an important role
in such algorithms. The optimum width of the beam needs to be determined
based on two optimization criteria; the width of the beam needs to be large
enough to eliminate periodic steering while avoiding the interference to the
others.
Location-Assisted Link Adaptation
Link adaptation is adjusting the transmission parameters adaptively accord-
ing to the condition of wireless propagation channel, which is one of the key
features of cognitive radios. Link adaptation can be deﬁned as a set of algo-
rithms and protocols that constitute adaptive modulation and coding [34]. The
parameters that are adapted are not limited to the modulation and coding.
Other transmission parameters such as transmit power level and bandwidth
can also be adjusted. Link adaptation techniques are powerful methods to im-
prove energy eﬃciency and increase data rate in the fading channels [35,36].
One of the key metrics in the link adaptation techniques is the distance
between transmitter and receiver. Hence, the link adaptation techniques in
the literature mainly rely on physical metrics, which are RSSI and Signal-to-
Noise-Ratio (SNR) [37]. Alternative to these metrics, the location information
of the transmitter and receiver can also be used. Since cognitive radios are
equipped with location estimation and/or sensing devices, the precise distance
between two cognitive radios can be easily determined. Such precise distance
information can be utilized to improve the performance of the link adaptation
techniques.
Location-Assisted Ranging
Traditionally the ranging information between transmitter and receiver is esti-
mated using the training sequence [38]. The time of arrival of paths, angle of
the received signal, or strength of the signal are mainly utilized to obtain
the ranging information. Similarly, the delay of the ﬁrst arrival paths are
estimated to establish synchronization between a transmitter and receiver.
Alternative to the legacy ranging algorithms, techniques that are aided by
location information can be developed for cognitive wireless networks. The
ranging and synchronization can be performed separately or jointly. However,

10 Location Information Management Systems
319
joint ranging and synchronization methods [39] are desirable for cognitive
radios. In the sequel, a location-assisted joint ranging and synchronization is
discussed brieﬂy. The ranging (distance) between two cognitive radios using
their absolute location information can be estimated easily. The transmit-
ting cognitive radio sends training sequence to the receiving cognitive radio
to establish synchronization. Once both are synchronized, the transmitting
cognitive radio transmits its absolute location information in the preamble to
the receiving cognitive radio. It extracts the absolute location information of
the transmitting cognitive radio from the preamble and measure the distance
between itself and transmit cognitive radio. The complexity and accuracy
of the location-assisted ranging algorithms can be compared to those of the
legacy ranging algorithms. However, it is expected that the former will have
less complexity and higher accuracy than the latter.
10.5.4 Environment Characterization
Similar to transceiver algorithm optimization, location-assisted channel envi-
ronment characterization is a current research topic. Transceiver algorithms
are generally developed for the speciﬁc environments. Hence, propagation
channel of the target environment is modeled as the ﬁrst step. Consequently,
the transceiver algorithms are developed based on the channel models. There
are two main approaches for modeling wireless propagation channels in an en-
vironment: 1) statistical modeling [40], 2) deterministic modeling [41]. In the
statistical modeling methods, extensive ﬁeld measurements are performed and
the statistical parameters of the channel are extracted. Then, the channel is
modeled based on these statistical parameters. On the other hand, determinis-
tic models (also known as site-speciﬁc models), which are based on numerical
calculations like ray tracing methods, strive to attain that ultimate pinpoint
accuracy via computer simulations.
In order to realize the adaptation capability of cognitive radio, it needs
to be aware of its operating environment, characterize it, and adapt itself
accordingly. We believe that statistical modeling is more suitable than the
deterministic modeling to be adopted by cognitive radios to achieve this goal.
The statistical parameters of wireless channels are mainly folded under two
groups, which are large-scale statistics and small-scale statistics [40]. With
the aid of location information, these statistics can be estimated through the
empirical models since most of them are environment-dependent parameter
(e.g. rural, urban, and indoor).
In the literature, there is not any clear-cut distinction between the envi-
ronmental classes. However, in the classiﬁcation, there are major diﬀerences
that aﬀect the channel parameters. Indoor/outdoor separation is the promi-
nent example of this case. For indoor environments, it is expected not to have
a higher Doppler spread as compared to that for outdoor due to the mobility
restrictions. On the other hand, for an outdoor environment, it is more likely
to have larger delay spread as compared to that for indoor.

320
H¨useyin Arslan and Hasari Celebi
The main small-scale statistical parameters can be retrieved by having a
priori information about the position of user and environment. As a result,
location information of cognitive radio along with the rough description of
operating environment are required for performing adaptation through the
empirical models. The location information of cognitive radio can be obtained
using one of the location estimation and/or sensing methods (e.g. GPS) dis-
cussed in earlier sections. Moreover, cognitive radio can identify the distinctive
properties of the surrounding environments (e.g. topographical information)
using basic topographical databases such as digital elevation models, neural
networks, and Markov models. By using the location information along with
rough description of the operating environment, cognitive radio can determine
the type of propagation environment and employ the corresponding channel
model for the adaptation.
10.6 Privacy Concerns
Extensive utilization of location information for the network optimization and
adoption of location-based services in cognitive wireless networks prompt the
security [42] and user privacy issues [43, 44]. Some users may not agree on
the use of their instantaneous location information for the aforementioned
location-assisted applications. In such cases, diﬀerent options need to be avail-
able to the users. For instance, in the emergency cases such as dialing a 911
call, cognitive wireless networks should have a right to locate the position of
the users. On the other hand, providing the location information to the net-
work can be optional in the non-emergency cases. Another possible solution
is that cognitive radio can have self-positioning capability (i.e. GPS receiver)
and the users can have a full control to setup the frequency of reporting the
location of their devices to the network. Furthermore, secure positioning tech-
niques robust to position and distance spooﬁng attacks [42] can be developed
for cognitive radios. With employing such potential solutions, the privacy of
users can be protected. Furthermore, by having a secure network and employ-
ing encryption technologies [45] can reduce the fears of users from the illegal
activity that can threat their privacies.
10.7 Conclusions
Evolution of the utilization of location information in wireless networks is pro-
vided. The need for a comprehensive location information management sys-
tem for cognitive wireless networks to realize location awareness is emphasized
and a location information management system model for cognitive wireless
networks is presented with the details. Detailed discussion on location esti-
mation and sensing in cognitive wireless networks is provided. Furthermore,
mobility management along with the mobility models and location tracking

for cognitive wireless networks are discussed. Several representative examples
for location-based services and location-assisted network optimization, trans-
ceiver algorithm optimization, and environment characterization are demon-
strated to support location information management system model. The user
privacy concerns regarding the utilization of their location information along
with some solutions are addressed. It can be concluded that location infor-
mation management system is a crucial part of cognitive wireless networks
and utilization of location information in cognitive wireless networks can be
exploited. Moreover, it is strongly recommended to balance the utilization of
location information in cognitive wireless networks and the protection of user
privacy.

11.1 Introduction
With emerging technologies and with the ever increasing number of wire-
less devices, the radio spectrum is becoming scarcer everyday. On the other
hand, measurements show that wide ranges of the spectrum are rarely used
most of the time while other bands are heavily used. However, those unused
portions of the spectrum are licensed and thus cannot be utilized by users
other than the license owners. Hence, there is a need for a novel technol-
ogy that can beneﬁt from these opportunities. Cognitive radio arises to be
a tempting solution to spectral crowding problem by introducing the oppor-
tunistic usage of frequency bands that are not heavily occupied by licensed
users [3]. It can be deﬁned as an intelligent wireless system that is aware
of its surrounding environment through sensing and measurements; a system
that uses its gained experience to plan future actions and adapt to improve
the overall communication quality and meet user needs. One main aspect
of cognitive radio is its ability to exploit unused spectrum to provide new
ways of communication. Hence, cognitive radio should have the ability to
sense and be aware of its operational environment, and dynamically adjust
its radio operating parameters accordingly. For cognitive radio to achieve this
objective, the Physical Layer (PHY) needs to be highly ﬂexible and adapt-
able. A special case of multicarrier transmission known as OFDM is one of
the most widely used technologies in current wireless communications sys-
tems and it has the potential of fulﬁlling the aforementioned requirements of
cognitive radios inherently or with minor changes. By dividing the spectrum
into sub-bands that are modulated with orthogonal subcarriers, OFDM re-
moves the need for equalizers and thus reduces the complexity of the receiver.
Because of its attractive features, OFDM has been successfully used in numer-
ous wireless technologies including Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN),
Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN), and the European Digital
Video Broadcasting (DVB). It is believed that OFDM will also play an impor-
tant role in realizing cognitive radio concept by providing a proven, scalable,

and adaptive technology for air interface. In this chapter, the application of
OFDM to cognitive radio is discussed. We identify the advantages of OFDM
over other technologies and provide challenges associated with its application
to cognitive radio.
11.2 A Basic OFDM System Model
A simpliﬁed block diagram of a basic OFDM system is given in Figure 11.1. In
a multipath fading channel, due to the frequency selectivity, each subcarrier
can have diﬀerent attenuation. The power on some subcarriers may be sig-
niﬁcantly less than the average power because of deep fades. As a result, the
overall BER may be dominated by a few subcarriers with low power levels. To
reduce the degradation of system performance due to this problem, channel
coding can be used prior to the modulation of bits. Channel coding can reduce
the BER signiﬁcantly depending on the code rate, decoder complexity, and
SNR level among other factors. Interleaving is also applied to randomize the
occurrence of bit errors and introduce system immunity to burst errors. Coded
and interleaved data is then mapped to the constellation points to obtain data
symbols. This step is represented by the modulation block of Figure 11.1. The
serial data symbols are then converted to parallel data symbols which are fed
to the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) block to obtain the time
domain OFDM symbols. Time domain samples can be written as

where X(k) is the transmitted symbol on the kth subcarrier and N is the
number of subcarriers. Time domain signal is cyclically extended to avoid
residual Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) from the previous OFDM symbols.
Baseband digital signal is converted to analog signal through the Digital-to-
Analog Converter (DAC) block. Then, the signal is fed to the Radio Frequency
(RF) frontend. The RF frontend up-converts the signal to the RF frequencies
using mixers, ampliﬁes it using Power Ampliﬁers (PAs), and transmits the
signal through antennas.
In the receiver side, the received signal is passed through a band-pass
noise rejection ﬁlter and down-converted to baseband by the RF frontend. The
Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) digitizes the analog signal and re-samples
it. After frequency and time synchronization (which are not shown in the ﬁgure
for simplicity), Cyclic Preﬁx (CP) is removed and the signal is transformed
to frequency domain using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) block. A
simpliﬁed baseband model of the received symbols in frequency domain can
be written as
Y (k) = H(k)X(k) + W(k) ,
(11.2)
where Y (k) is the received symbol on the kth subcarrier, H(k) is the frequency
response of the channel on the same subcarrier, and W(k) is the additive
noise plus interference sample which is usually assumed to be a Gaussian
random variable with zero mean and variance of σ2
w. Note that OFDM converts
the convolution in time domain into multiplication in frequency domain, and
hence simple one-tap frequency domain equalizers can be used to recover the
transmitted symbols. After DFT, symbols are demodulated, deinterleaved,
and decoded to obtain the transmitted information bits.

ﬁgure shows the orthogonal subcarriers that modulates the transmitted data.

are the symbol time, subcarrier spacing (or consequently the number of
subcarriers), and CP length.
The transmitted signal usually arrives at the intended receiver either
directly (what is called Line-of-Sight (LOS) communication) or after being
reﬂected on surfaces of buildings, cars, and other surroundings in the envi-
ronment (also called as None-Line-of-Sight (NLOS)). As a result of the signal
being reﬂected on multiple surfaces, the received signal becomes a sum of
the transmitted signal with diﬀerent delays and gains corresponding to the
multiple paths the signal travels through. Such a channel is usually referred
to as multipath channel (see Figure 11.3).
The main eﬀects of multipath channel on the received signal are frequency-
selective fading and ISI. Frequency selective fading means that the channel

329
does not aﬀect all frequency components of the signal equally which results
in distortion of the received signal. On the other hand, ISI is the interference
between consequent OFDM symbols. Due to receiving multiple copies of the
signal with diﬀerent delays, a symbol can leak part of its energy into the
following symbol. If not dealt with, both frequency selective fading and ISI
can result in a signiﬁcant degradation of system performance.
Channel equalizers are usually used to compensate multipath eﬀects.
Equalizers can considerably increase the system complexity as their complex-
ity increases depending on the number of channel paths. In OFDM system,
however, the need for equalizers can be avoided by careful system design.
To avoid ISI, symbols duration are extended by adding a guard band to the
beginning of each symbol in what is known as CP. If we deﬁne the delay spread
(or multipath spread) of the channel as the delay between the ﬁrst and last
received paths over the channel, the CP should be longer than that delay. On
the other hand, frequency selective fading is avoided by decreasing the subcar-
rier spacing or consequently increasing the number of subcarriers. We deﬁne
the channel coherence bandwidth as the bandwidth over which the channel
could be considered ﬂat. Since ODFM signal can be considered as group of
narrow band signals, by increasing the number of subcarriers, the bandwidth
of each subcarrier (subcarrier spacing) becomes narrower. By choosing the
subcarrier spacing to be less than the coherence bandwidth of the channel,
each subcarrier is going to be aﬀected by a ﬂat channel and thus no channel
equalization is needed.
Another channel eﬀect that should be considered in OFDM system design
is mobility. For ﬁxed communication systems, the channel can be considered
constant over time. However, if either transmitter or receiver is mobile, the
channel is going to vary over time resulting in fast fading of the received
signal. Coherence time of the channel is deﬁned as the time over which the
channel is considered constant. To avoid fast fading eﬀect, OFDM symbol
time is chosen to be shorter than the coherence time of the channel. In the
frequency domain, mobility results in a frequency spread of the signal which
dependents on the operating frequency and the relative speed between the
transmitter and receiver, also know as Doppler spread [2]. Doppler spread of
OFDM signals results in Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) which can be reduced
by increasing the subcarrier spacing.
In conclusion, while increasing the symbol time reduces ISI eﬀect, shorter
symbol time is desirable to avoid fast fading of the signal. And while decreasing
subcarrier spacing reduces ICI, narrower subcarrier spacing helps avoiding
frequency selectivity. As a matter of fact, there exists an optimum value of
these parameters that should be used to improve the system performance [3].
In this section, a single user system model is represented, where the avail-
able channel is used by a single user. Note that OFDM by itself is not a multi-
access technique. However, it can be combined with existing multiple accessing
methods to allow multiple users to access the available channel. Some of the

330
H¨useyin Arslan et al.
most common multiple access techniques that can be employed by OFDM
systems are TDMA, Carrier Sense Multiple Accessing (CSMA) [4], Frequency
Division Multiple Accessing (FDMA), and CDMA based schemes [5]. In ad-
dition, a mix of TDMA and FDMA known as Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiple Access (OFDMA) [6] is also possible. Note that in the above sys-
tem model, the interference from other users and other technologies (like co-
channel interference, adjacent channel interference, narrow band interference,
etc.) are all folded into the noise term for the sake of simplicity. However, in
reality, when the received signal is impaired by an interferer, a more accurate
model needs to be used, where the noise term will be colored eﬀecting each
carrier diﬀerently.
11.3 OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio
Application of OFDM to cognitive radio brings about new aspects and chal-
lenges to system design. The cognitive OFDM conceptual model considered
in this chapter is shown in Figure 11.41. The cognitive engine is responsible
for making the intelligent decisions and conﬁguring the radio and PHY para-
meters. The spectral opportunities are identiﬁed by the decision unit based
on the information from policy engine as well as local and network spectrum
sensing data.
The policy engine provides information to the cognitive engine concerning
the current policies to be considered depending on the system location. This
will ensure that the cognitive radio will not use illegal waveforms or breach
any policies. On the other hand, the local spectrum sensing unit process the
spectrum information and identify licensed users accessing the spectrum, their
signal speciﬁcations such as the their bandwidth and power level, and detect
spectrum opportunities that can be exploited by cognitive radio.
Once the required information is available, the decision unit can make a
conclusion on the best course of action for the system. The decision includes
choosing the appropriate channel coding, modulation, operation frequencies,
and bandwidth. At this stage, OFDM technology gets the upper hand over
other similar transmission technologies with its adaptive features and great
ﬂexibility. By only changing the conﬁguration parameters of OFDM (see
Table 11.1 for some example parameters) and radio, the cognitive system can
communicate with various radio access technologies in the environment, or it
can optimize the transmission depending on the environmental characteristics.
The radio circuit is divided into a digital part (digital IF, ADC, and DAC)
and an analog part (software tunable analog radio). Both parts are reconﬁg-
urable by the cognitive engine to increase the ﬂexibility of the system. This
includes controlling the operating frequency, bandwidth, ﬁlters, and mixers.
Even antenna parameters (e.g. number of antennas, beam forming) can be
conﬁgured to improve the system performance.

11.4 Why OFDM is a Good Fit for Cognitive Radio
The underlying sensing and spectrum shaping capabilities together with ﬂex-
ibility and adaptiveness make OFDM probably the best candidate for cog-
nitive radio systems. In the following, we present some of the requirements

332
H¨useyin Arslan et al.
for cognitive radios and explain how OFDM can fulﬁll these requirements. A
summary of these requirements and OFDM’s strength in addressing them are
presented in Table 11.2.
11.4.1 Spectrum Sensing and Awareness
Cognitive radio should be able to scan the spectrum and measure diﬀerent
channel characteristics such as power availability, interference, and noise tem-
perature [7]. In addition, the system should be able to identify diﬀerent users’
signals in the spectrum and also identify if they are either licensed or rental
users. These abilities allow cognitive radio system to identify unused parts of
the spectrum and spectral opportunities.
However, since for a rental system it is important not to interfere with
other licensed systems using the spectrum, other measures should be taken
to guarantee an interference-free communication between rental users. One
approach is to share the spectrum sensing information between multiple cog-
nitive radio devices to decrease or even eliminate the probability of interference
with licensed users [8]. On the other hand, more sophisticated algorithms can
be used for sensing the spectrum.

Spectrum sensing
Inherent FFT operation of OFDM eases spectrum sensing
in frequency domain.
Eﬃcient spectrum
utilization
Waveform can be easily shaped by simply turning oﬀ
some subcarriers, where primary users exist.
Adaptation/Scalability
OFDM systems can be adapted to diﬀerent transmission
environments and available resources. Some parameters
include: FFT size, subcarrier spacing, CP size, modula-
tion, coding, subcarrier powers.
Advanced antenna
techniques
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) techniques are
commonly used with OFDM mainly because of the
reduced equalizer complexity. OFDM also supports smart
antennas.
Interoperability
With WLAN (IEEE 802.11), WMAN (IEEE 802.16).
WRAN (IEEE 802.22), WPAN (IEEE 802.15.3a) all
using OFDM as their PHY techniques, interoperability
becomes easier compared to other technologies.
Multiple accessing and
spectral allocation
Support for multiuser access is already inherited in the
system design by assigning groups of subcarriers to dif-
ferent users (OFDMA).
NBI immunity
NBI aﬀect only some subcarriers in OFDM systems.
These subcarriers can be simply turned oﬀ.

11 OFDM for Cognitive Radio: Merits and Challenges
333
While the eﬃciency of the spectrum sensing and analyzing process is
important for a successful implementation of cognitive radio, the processing
time can be even more important. The periodicity of spectrum sensing should
be short enough to allow for detection of new spectrum opportunities and, at
the same time, to detect licensed users accessing the previously-identiﬁed-as-
unused parts of the spectrum. On the other hand, if spectrum sensing is done
so frequently, the overhead of sharing such information will increase reducing
the spectrum eﬃciency of the whole system not to mention the increase in
system complexity. In OFDM systems, conversion from time domain to fre-
quency domain is achieved inherently by using DFT. Hence, all the points
in the time–frequency grid can be scanned without any extra hardware and
computation because of the hardware reuse of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
cores. Using the time–frequency grid, the selection of bins that are available
for exploitation (spectrum holes) can be carried out using simple hypothesis
testing [9]. The DFT outputs can be ﬁltered across time and frequency di-
mensions to reduce the uncertainty in detection as well [10]. Note that the
resolution of the frequency grid is dependent on subcarrier spacing.
11.4.2 Spectrum Shaping
After a cognitive radio system scans the spectrum and identiﬁes active licensed
users and available opportunities, comes the next step: spectrum shaping.
Theoretically, it is desired to allow the cognitive users to freely use available
unused portions of the spectrum.
Cognitive users should be able to ﬂexibly shape the transmitted signal
spectrum. It is desired to have control over waveform parameters such as
the signal bandwidth, power level, center frequency, and most of all a ﬂexible
spectrum mask. OFDM systems can provide such ﬂexibility due to the unique
nature of OFDM signaling. By disabling a set of subcarriers, the spectrum
of OFDM signals can be adaptively shaped to ﬁt into the required spectrum
mask. Assuming the spectrum mask is already known to the cognitive radio
system, choosing the disabled subcarriers is a relatively simple process [11].
The main parameters of an OFDM system that can be used to shape
the signal spectrum are number of subcarriers, subcarrier’s power, and pulse-
shaping ﬁlters. Increasing the number of subcarriers for a ﬁxed bandwidth
allows the OFDM system to have a higher resolution in the frequency domain.
However, this results in increasing the complexity of the FFT operations and
thus increasing the overall system complexity.
Subcarrier power can be used to shape the signal into the desired mask.
One reason to assign subcarriers diﬀerent powers is to better ﬁt into the
channel response [12]. For example, subcarriers with higher SNR values can
be assigned lower power than those with lower SNR to improve the overall
system BER. Another reason is to reduce the adjacent channel interference
from an OFDM system by reducing the power assigned to edge subcarriers.

Fig. 11.5. Spectrum sensing and shaping using OFDM.
An example of spectrum sensing and shaping procedures in OFDM-based
cognitive radio systems is illustrated in Figure 11.5. Two licensed users are
detected using the output of FFT block, and subcarriers that can cause inter-
ference to licensed user are turned oﬀ. The transmitter then uses the free parts
of the spectrum for signal transmission. In addition, pulse-shaping ﬁlters can
also be used to reduce the interference to adjacent bands. More discussions
on reducing interference is introduced in Section 11.5.5.
11.4.3 Adapting to Environment
Adaptivity is one of the key requirements for a cognitive radio [13]. By com-
bining the measured information (awareness) with the knowledge of current
system abilities and limitations, cognitive radio can adapt waveforms to inter-
operate with other friendly communication devices, choose the most appropri-
ate communications channel or network for transmission, allocate appropriate
frequency to transmit in an open area of spectrum, adapt the waveform to
compensate for channel fading, and null an interfering signal [14].
OFDM oﬀers a great ﬂexibility in this regard as the number of parame-
ters for adaptation is quite large [15]. The transmission parameters that can
be changed based on the spectrum awareness include bandwidth, FFT size,
ﬁlters, windows, modulation, transmit power, and active subcarriers used
for transmission. Moreover, the parameters that can be adapted depending
on the characteristics of the environment in order to optimize the transmis-
sion include cyclic preﬁx size, coding rate/type, modulation type, interleaving
method, pilot patterns, preambles/midambles, duplexing method.
The adaptivity in OFDM systems can be divided into two groups [16]:
algorithm-selection level adaptivity and algorithm-parameter level adaptivity.

11 OFDM for Cognitive Radio: Merits and Challenges
335
In classical wireless systems, usually parameters of the algorithms, e.g. coding
rate, have been adapted in order to optimize the transmission. However, in
cognitive OFDM systems, algorithm type, e.g. channel coding method, may
also be adapted in order to achieve interoperability with other systems and/or
to further optimize the transmission. To achieve such adaptivity, a fully con-
ﬁgurable hardware platform would be needed.
11.4.4 Advanced Antenna Techniques
Advanced antenna techniques are not necessarily required for cognitive radios.
However, they are desirable as they will provide better spectral eﬃciency
which is the primary motivation for cognitive radio. Smart antennas and
MIMO systems can be used to exploit the spatial dimension of spectrum
space (e.g. through beam forming) to improve the eﬃciency. In essence
multi-antenna systems can help to ﬁnd spectral opportunities in the spatial
domain and can help to exploit these opportunities in full. The use of MIMO
techniques oﬀers several important advantages including spatial degree of free-
dom, increased spectral eﬃciency and diversity [17]. These advantages can be
used to increase the spectrum utilization of the overall system. Furthermore,
beamforming, diversity combining, and space-time equalization can also be
applied to cognitive OFDM systems. Another application of adaptive antenna
techniques is the reduction of the interference in OFDM systems [18].
MIMO systems commonly employ OFDM as their transmission technique
because of the simple diversity combination and equalization, particularly at
high data rates. In MIMO–OFDM, the channel response becomes a matrix.
Since each tone can be equalized independently, the complexity of space–time
equalizers is avoided and signals can be processed using relatively straight-
forward matrix algebra. Moreover, the advantages of OFDM in multipath are
preserved in MIMO–OFDM system as frequency selectivity caused by multi-
path increases the capacity.
11.4.5 Multiple Accessing and Spectral Allocation
The resources available to a cognitive system often have to be shared among
users. Several techniques can be used to achieve such tasks. OFDM supports
the well-known multiple accessing techniques such as TDMA, FDMA, and
CSMA. Moreover, CDMA can also be used together with OFDM for multi-
plexing diﬀerent users, in which case the transmission is known as Multicarrier
Code Division Multiple Access (MC–CDMA) or Multicarrier Direct Spread
Code Division Multiple Access (DS–CDMA) [5].
OFDMA, a special case of FDMA, has gained tremendous attention
recently with its usage in ﬁxed and mobile Worldwide Interoperability for
Microwave Access (WiMAX) [19]. In OFDMA, subcarriers are grouped into
sets each of which is assigned to a diﬀerent user. Interleaved, randomized, or
clustered assignment schemes can be used for this purpose. Hence, it oﬀers

336
H¨useyin Arslan et al.
very ﬂexible multiple accessing and spectral allocation capability for cognitive
radios without any extra complexity or hardware. The allocation of subcarri-
ers can be tailored according to the spectrum availability. The ﬂexibility and
support of OFDM systems for various multiple accessing enables the interop-
erability and increases the adoption of cognitive radio as well.
11.4.6 Interoperability
Another desirable feature of cognitive radio is interoperability. Interoperabil-
ity can be deﬁned as the ability of two or more systems or components to
exchange information and to use the information that has been exchanged [20].
Since cognitive radio systems have to deal with licensed users as well as
other cognitive users, the ability to detect and encode existing users’ signals
can expedite the adoption and improve the performance of cognitive radio
systems. Furthermore, some recent unfortunate events manifested the impor-
tance of interoperability in terms of wireless communications for the ﬁrst
responders [21,22]. For interoperability problems, cognitive radio can improve
the disaster relief operations by developing the coordination between ﬁrst
responders [23, 24]. For such tasks, OFDM is one of the best candidates as
OFDM signaling has been successfully used in various technologies. Systems
based on OFDM include 802.11a and 802.11g Wireless LAN standards, Digi-
tal Audio Broadcasting (DAB), DVB, and WiMAX. Figure 11.6 shows some
of the OFDM-based wireless technologies according to communication range.
As shown in this ﬁgure, OFDM has been used in both short range and long
range communication systems. Hence, a cognitive radio system employing
OFDM can communicate with systems using other OFDM-based technolo-
gies with much ease. Only the knowledge of the signal parameters used by
the desired users will be needed (see Table 11.1). However, for such task to
be successful, the cognitive radio system should be built around a software-
deﬁned radio architecture. In addition, the cognitive radio system should have
all the standard-related information required to decode other signals, such as
the data and pilot mapping to the frequency subcarriers, frame structure and
the coding type and rate.
11.5 Challenges to Cognitive OFDM Systems
As an intelligent system with features such as awareness, adaptability and
learning, cognitive radio represents the future of wireless systems with the
promise of oﬀering solutions to various communication problems as outlined
in the previous section. However, with this new technology, new challenges ap-
pear, raising interesting research topics. In the considered OFDM-based cogni-
tive radio systems, the challenges can be grouped into three categories as illus-
trated in Figure 11.7. The ﬁrst category includes the challenges that are unique
to classical OFDM systems including Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR),

sensitivity to frequency oﬀset and phase noise, synchronization, etc. The sec-
ond category includes problems faced by all cognitive radios such as spectrum
sensing, cross layer adaptation, and interference avoidance. Our main focus in
this chapter is on the third category: challenges that arise when OFDM tech-
nique is employed by cognitive radio systems. In the following, some challenges
and approaches for solving them are given.

338
H¨useyin Arslan et al.
11.5.1 Spectrum Shaping
One of the main challenges in OFDM cognitive radio systems is spectrum
shaping. In OFDM-based systems, spectrum shaping means determining the
subcarriers to be used by the OFDM system while keeping the interference to
and from primary users at a negligible level. Once spectrum sensing informa-
tion is acquired, this knowledge should be utilized to select the subcarriers to
be used by the secondary/cognitive users. This problem is addressed in [25] by
using energy detectors over each subcarrier. Moreover, a detection criterion
is used to determine used subcarriers. Spectrum sensing is directly related to
the sensing problem for spectrum hole identiﬁcation. However, cognitive radio
might prefer to skip some opportunities depending on the power and network
traﬃc requirements.
11.5.2 Eﬀective Pruning Algorithm Design
Once the subcarriers to be used are determined, there might be many sub-
carriers that are deactivated. In such a case, the eﬃciency of FFT algorithms
can be increased and/or execution time can be decreased by removing opera-
tions on input values which are zero, a process known as pruning. Designing
eﬀective pruning algorithms is important for cognitive OFDM systems for
achieving higher performance. Speciﬁc implementation of pruning technique
for CR-OFDM systems is discussed in [26].
11.5.3 Signaling the Transmission Parameters
OFDM system can adjust its waveform by turning oﬀsome subcarriers in
order to exploit the available spectrum holes (see Figure 11.5). The receiver,
however, should be informed about subcarriers that are deactivated and that
are to be used. Signaling of this information should be performed carefully in
order to prevent interference to primary users while keeping the bandwidth
loss at minimum. Detection of those unused subcarriers can also be performed
blindly. However, to the best knowledge of the authors, no work in this area
has been done yet. One method to reduce the overhead due to signaling is pro-
posed in [27]. The activation/deactivation of subcarriers is performed over a
block of subcarriers instead of each individual subcarrier. Hence, the signaling
overhead can be reduced by a factor of each block’s size. Moreover, depending
on the channel quality and available resources, parameters like FFT size, CP
size, etc. can be changed and this information should also be conveyed to the
receiver.
11.5.4 Synchronization
Synchronization is another important issue that needs to be addressed in
OFDM system design. With the introduction of cognitive radio, new aspects

11 OFDM for Cognitive Radio: Merits and Challenges
339
are introduced to the problem. The NBI, which can interfere with the pream-
ble, is one of the problems [28]. Furthermore, the incomplete subcarrier set
might be an issue for preambles, and pilots might fall into unused subcarriers
if used. Moreover, if multiple user accessing is employed, the subcarriers can
be assigned to diﬀerent users. To keep the orthogonality between subcarri-
ers and avoid interference, all users should be synchronized to the receiver.
In [28], it is shown that longer preambles are needed in CR-OFDM systems
as compared to conventional systems. Moreover, new preamble structures are
introduced and their performance for time and frequency synchronization is
investigated.
11.5.5 Mutual Interference
Mutual interference should be carefully considered when designing cognitive
radio systems. The side lobes of modulated OFDM subcarriers are known
to be large as shown in Figure 11.8. As a result, there will be power leak-
age from used subcarriers to nulled subcarriers which causes interference to
the licensed users. Various methods are proposed in the literature to reduce
this leakage and to enable co-existence of cognitive-OFDM systems with pri-
mary license owner systems. One method is to make the sinc function (see
Figure 11.8) decay faster by windowing the time domain OFDM samples [29].
Similar techniques have already been investigated to reduce ICI and out-of-
band radiation in OFDM systems [30, 31]. In [29], a raised-cosine window is
applied. By changing the roll-oﬀfactor of the raised-cosine window, interfer-
ence reduction of upto 6 dB has been achieved. Figures 11.9 and 11.10 show

the raised-cosine window shape for diﬀerent roll-oﬀvalues and corresponding
power spectral densities.
The drawback of this method is the reduction of
system throughput due to the temporal extension of time domain signal
to maintain orthogonality. Another method for reducing the interference is
to adaptively deactivate the subcarriers that are adjacent to the subcarri-
ers occupied by licensed users [29]. This way the interference can be greatly
reduced as most of the interference comes from the neighboring subcarriers.
However, the obvious disadvantage of this method is the reduction of spec-
tral eﬃciency. Instead of deactivating the neighboring subcarriers, their values

can be determined actively in order to cancel the interference in the deacti-
vated bands. This technique is proposed in [32, 33] and referred to as active
interference cancellation and cancellation carriers, respectively. It is shown
that the performance can be improved, however, determination of the values
for cancellation subcarriers is complex as it requires optimization. One last
method for reducing the interference to and from the narrowband primary
users is subcarrier weighting [34, 35]. In this method, the subcarrier weights
are determined in such a way that the sidelobes of the transmission signal are
minimized according to an optimization algorithm which allows several opti-
mization constraints. This way, more than 10 dB reduction in the sidelobes of
OFDM signal can be achieved. Note that subcarrier weighting requires con-
stant envelope modulation such as BPSK or QPSK. Moreover, the receiver
does not need to know the weighting sequence as the phase information is not
changed.
In addition to the aforementioned challenges, there are other issues for
practical implementation of OFDM cognitive radio systems. While cognitive
radio is such a promising technology, more research is needed to build a prac-
tical system with aﬀordable complexity.
11.6 Multi-band OFDM
In previous sections, only Single-Band OFDM (SB-OFDM) systems were con-
sidered. In this section, using OFDM signaling over multiple bands is discussed
along with the advantages and motivations of using Multi-band OFDM (MB-
OFDM). The proposition of MB-OFDM for UWB is addressed. However, the
discussion of MB-OFDM is not limited to one application but rather it is
presented from a broader point of view.
For systems utilizing wide bands of the spectrum, multi-band signaling
approach –where the total bandwidth is divided into smaller bands– can prove
to be more advantageous over using single band signaling. While using a sin-
gle band simpliﬁes the system design, processing a wide band signal requires
building highly complex RF circuitry for signal transmission/reception. In
addition, high speed ADCs are required to sample and digitize the signal.
Moreover, higher complexity channel equalizers are also needed to capture
suﬃcient multipath signal energy for further processing. On the other hand,
multi-band signaling relaxes the requirements on system hardware as smaller
portions of the spectrum are processed at a time. Furthermore, dividing the
spectrum into smaller bands allows for better spectrum allocation. The sys-
tem can drop some of the available bands to achieve other goals (e.g. avoid
interference, save power, allow for multiuser accessing).
For OFDM-based cognitive radio, the question becomes when to use multi-
band and when to use single band. Given a certain scanned spectrum shape,
choosing the number of bands depends on various parameters. Required
throughput, hardware limitations, computational complexity, number of spec-
trum holes and their bandwidths, and interference level are examples of what

342
H¨useyin Arslan et al.
could aﬀect cognitive system’s choice. We further illustrate the importance of
multi-band signaling with the next example.
Consider the scenario, where a cognitive radio senses the spectrum and
ﬁnds the results shown in Figure 11.11. Two spectrum holes are detected
with 10 and 15 MHz bandwidth. One of the spectrum holes contains narrow
band interference. The detected vacancies in the spectrum are 1 GHz apart.
In such scenario, if the system chooses to use SB-OFDM, then the bandwidth
of the OFDM signal is going to be 1.025 GHz. A signal with such bandwidth
requires ADCs with very high sampling rate capability. In addition, a large
number of subcarriers is required to guarantee that subcarriers can better ﬁt
into the spectrum holes as well as to keep the subcarrier’s channel relatively
ﬂat. Unfortunately, large number of subcarriers results in a more complex
FFT operation. Moreover, in order to avoid the narrow band interference in
the 15 MHz band, the system drops two out of three subcarriers that are used
to ﬁll the spectrum hole, resulting in a low spectrum eﬃciency. By using MB-
OFDM, the spectrum holes can be ﬁlled with two OFDM signals with 15 and
10 MHz bandwidths. Hence, ADCs with practical sampling rates can now be
used. A large number of subcarriers is not necessary for either OFDM signals
in that case. In addition, the system has more control over the signal spec-
trum in each band due to the small subcarrier spacing. Hence, avoiding narrow
band interference is done with lower spectrum loss. However, the system is

now processing two OFDM signals. While sampling frequency is reduced in
MB-OFDM case, the system is performing receiver algorithms (e.g. synchro-
nization, channel estimation, and equalization) separately for each band.
Another example is shown in Figure 11.12. In this example a SB-OFDM
could be a better choice for the system rather than using ﬁve bands in a MB-
OFDM scheme. The improvement of spectrum eﬃciency introduced by using
MB-OFDM may not be as signiﬁcant as the increase in system complexity.
It is worth mentioning that MB-OFDM is also employed in some UWB
systems. Instead of using a single band UWB signal, the spectrum is divided
into sub-bands (with approximately 500 MHz bandwidth each) and OFDM
signals are used to transmit data over each band [36,37]. Figure 11.13 shows
an illustration of the UWB signal in frequency domain. However, while UWB
is one of the applications of MB-OFDM, it is only limited to a speciﬁc sce-
nario where all sub-bands have almost equal size and OFDM signals used in
sub-bands are identical in many other parameters such as the CP and the
subcarrier spacing.
In summary, to choose between SB-OFDM and MB-OFDM, the system
needs to identify some system and environment parameters. Note that MB-
OFDM is only eﬀective if spectrum holes are far apart or if the covered band-
width is relatively wide. MB-OFDM can lessen the strain on the required
ADC sampling rate, the memory size, and speed. On the other hand, the
complexity of the baseband signal processing increases as the system needs to
carry out receiver algorithms over multiple OFDM signals. In this section, an
overview with some discussions is provided on the use of multi-band signaling

designing the system and algorithms that are capable of identifying the best
signaling choice are needed. Hence, more research is required on this topic.
11.7 A Step Toward Cognitive-OFDM: Standards
and Technologies
As cognitive radio concept is attracting more interest everyday, recently devel-
oped standards are considering more cognitive features. Dynamic frequency
allocation, Transmit Power Control (TPC), and spectrum sensing are just a
few examples of features that are included in some of the current standards.
These can be considered as a step toward the future implementation of a cog-
nitive radio. It is worth to note that most of these standards consider OFDM
as their choice for transmission technology (see Figure 11.6).
11.7.1 WiMAX – IEEE 802.16
One of the technologies that is getting a fair amount of interest lately – in
both academia and industry – is WiMAX. The ﬁrst WiMAX standard, IEEE
802.16a [38], operates in the 10–66 GHz range. In this frequency range, only
LOS communication is possible. The standard later evolved in 2004 to the
IEEE 802.16-2004 [39]; also know as IEEE 802.16d. The IEEE 802.16-2004
standard supported the operation in the 2–11 GHz range allowing for a NLOS
communications. It provides point to multipoint access for ﬁxed subscribers.
The IEEE 802.16e-2005 [19] standard updates and extends this standard to
allow for mobile subscriber stations traveling at vehicular speeds. A scalable

11 OFDM for Cognitive Radio: Merits and Challenges
345
version of OFDMA is introduced improving the overall system performance.
While IEEE’s role is to develop standards for the PHY and MAC layers,
WiMAX forum ensures compatibility and interoperability between vendors’
equipments through its certiﬁcation process.
OFDMA PHY mode is probably the most interesting mode supported by
WiMAX. Using OFDM signaling, OFDMA PHY mode enables a WiMAX
Base Station (BS) to support multiple ﬁxed or mobile users at the same time.
In this mode, a BS system utilizes the available channel by dividing the avail-
able subcarriers into subchannels. A number of subchannel grouped with a
number of OFDMA symbols constitutes a slot. A slot is deﬁned as the min-
imum data allocation unit [39]. The slot deﬁnition shows that the system
resources are being shared between users in two domains. The ﬁrst dimension
is frequency which is represented by the number of subchannels in each slot.
The second dimension is time which is represented by number of OFDMA
symbols. Figure 11.14 shows the OFDMA signal structure used in WiMAX.
Note that this ﬁgure is only for illustration purposes and thus the number of
subcarriers or the slot size does not reﬂect the actual numbers used by the
standard.
In WiMAX-based systems, users can be assigned diﬀerent bandwidths,
time durations, transmit power levels, and modulation orders (see Table 11.1)
based on various parameters such as user Carrier-to-Interference Noise Ratio
(CINR), Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), or the available band-
width. Moreover, OFDMA PHY oﬀers multiple FFT sizes, CP sizes, and pilot
allocation schemes. The FFT size can be selected as 128, 256, 512, 1024, or
2048 depending on the transmission bandwidth.2 Similarly, the CP length can
be set to 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, and 1/32 time the OFDM symbol length. The CP
size can be changed depending on the various environmental characteristics.
With all these adaptive features, WiMAX has the ability to adapt to vari-
ous channel conditions and communication scenarios. Indeed, a WiMAX BS
measures the available channel and received signal parameters, makes a plan
on what the most appropriate settings for communication with current sub-
scribers (with certain goals in mind such as maximum throughput, Quality of
Service (QoS).) is, and executes this plan.
WiMAX standard is very rich in terms of advanced antenna techniques as
well. Table 11.3 shows the MIMO features available in the mobile-WiMAX
standard, IEEE 802.16E-2005 [19]. Although these antenna techniques are not
required, they are well suited to cognitive radio and useful for achieving high
data rates.
The amendment to IEEE 802.16 standard IEEE 802.16h, which is cur-
rently being developed, introduces cognitive features to WiMAX. The goal is
to achieve coexistence of WiMAX devices in unlicensed bands. Furthermore,
methods for coexistence with primary users are also developed.
2 This is known as scalable OFDMA. Various FFT sizes are used to keep the
subcarrier spacing constant for diﬀerent transmission bandwidths.

11.7.2 IEEE 802.22
Another standard that is being developed recently is the IEEE 802.22 stan-
dard [40]. IEEE 802.22 is designed to operate within the TV bands. However,
IEEE 802.22-based systems should avoid interfering with incumbent signals.
Systems should be able to sense the channel, detect incumbent signals within
spectrum, and adjust their operating frequency and transmit power accord-
ingly [41]. With features such as channel sensing, licensed users detection,
Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS), and TPC, IEEE 802.22 can be consid-
ered as a cognitive radio standard. Even though this standard is not ﬁnalized
yet, it is anticipated that it will be based on OFDM transmission as well.
The main diﬀerence between WiMAX and the IEEE 802.22 standard is
that the later is mainly targeting rural and remote areas, since it is reusing
TV bands. However, this gives 802.22 the upper hand in terms of range.

348
H¨useyin Arslan et al.
A coverage area of up to 100 km is possible making it the ﬁrst Wireless
Rural Area Network (WRAN) standard. Current speciﬁcations can establish
a coverage area of up to 33 km.
The 802.22 standard is designed for a ﬁxed point-to-multipoint communi-
cation topology, where the BS acts as the master mandating all the operation
parameters of users with its cell. And while the users (slaves) can share sens-
ing information with the BS through distributed sensing, it is up to the BS
to change a user transmit power, modulation, coding or operating frequency.
In such topology, it is the responsibility of the service provider to ensure that
users’ signals is causing no interference to the incumbent signals by within
the coverage area. This is a crucial issue for the coexistence of the standard
with the already existing TV services.
Another challenge in designing the 802.22 standard is the initialization of
new users who desire to communicate with the BS. Unlike current wireless
technologies, the frequency and time duration of the initialization channel is
not predeﬁned. In other words, initial users will have to scan parts (if not
all) of the TV bands to ﬁnd the current BS operating frequency and time. In
addition, users should be able to diﬀerentiate between incumbent signals and
the BS signal. This could prove to be very challenging especially if the BS is
operating over a combination of multiple frequency bands.
A discussion of the aforementioned challenges and more issues related to
the design of the 802.22 standard can be found in [41].
11.7.3 IEEE 802.11
The well-known WLAN standard, IEEE 802.11a/g [4,42], is amended to have
cognitive features with IEEE 802.11h and IEEE 802.11k standards. IEEE
802.11h [43] is designed to allow estimation of channel characteristics and
DFS, which is the ability to switch to diﬀerent physical RF channels for trans-
mit and receive activity based on channel measurements. In addition, TPC is
incorporated as well, providing the system with more control over the signal
range and interference level. The purpose of the IEEE 802.11h standard is to
allow WLAN systems to share the 5 GHz spectrum with primary users (e.g.
military radar systems).
The DFS detects devices using the same radio channel and the system
switches to other radio channels if necessary avoiding interference with other
existing primary users. WLAN station reports a list of channels that it can
support to an access point. When it’s necessary to switch to a new channel,
the access point uses this data to determine the best channel. On the other
hand, TPC is used to reduce the interference from stations to other devices by
controlling the power level of the transmitted signal. In addition, TPC is used
to manage the power consumption of wireless devices and the range between
access points and wireless devices.
On the other hand, IEEE 802.11k standard is proposed for radio resource
management. The aim is to improve the traﬃc distribution in a WLAN. The

11 OFDM for Cognitive Radio: Merits and Challenges
349
standard deﬁnes a list of several radio parameters to be estimated by the
system. While this list is limited and aimed for IEEE 802.11 standards, it
is further enhanced compared to earlier standards. WLAN devices can be
upgraded to support the new standard, since it is designed to be implemented
in software. The standard allows access points to collect data from clients
regarding access points they can detect and their signal power. After the
collected data is analyzed, access points within range of a client are ordered
into a list according to their signal strength, services, and encryption types
supported by the client. This list is called site report. The access points provide
the clients with the site report and thus improve the roaming decisions and
increase the overall network throughput.
The access point could gather informations from clients about the RF
channel. For example, the access point could request the client to measure the
channel noise level, or to provide the access point with informations regarding
the traﬃc load on the channel and the time duration over which the channel
is occupied. Using this information, the access point can make a decision
whether a certain channel is being crowded or if the channel contains high
level of noise/interference.
Other features including tracking of hidden nodes and sharing clients sta-
tistics are included in the standard. By applying both 802.11h and 802.11k
standards to current 802.11-based WLAN systems, the performance and eﬃ-
ciency of wireless networking can be improved signiﬁcantly. Adding cognitive
features such as channel sensing and estimation, statistics distribution, DFS,
TPC to WLAN devices will soon be possible. It is important to remember
that 802.11 standards mainly use OFDM making it the signaling of choice for
future technologies. Figure 11.15 shows an illustration of the discussed current
and future technologies and standards.
11.8 Conclusion
Cognitive radio is an exciting and promising eﬀort for solving the spectrum
crowding problem. On the other hand, OFDM technique is used in many
wireless systems and proven as a reliable and eﬀective transmission method.
OFDM can be used for realizing cognitive radio concept because of its inherent
capabilities that are discussed in detail in this chapter. By employing OFDM
transmission in cognitive radio systems; adaptive, aware and ﬂexible systems
that can interoperate with current technologies can be realized. However, the
identiﬁed challenges need to be studied further in order to ﬁnd solid solutions.
The adoption of OFDM in cognitive radios may happen in two ways: current
wireless technologies might evolve to have more and more cognitive features or
new systems might be developed that has full cognitive features. In either case,
we foresee that OFDM will be the dominant PHY technology for cognitive
radio.

12.1 Introduction
Cognitive radio, which is a recent concept introduced by Mitola [1], has been
attracting signiﬁcant interest and has the potential of shaping the future of
wireless communication systems. The basic idea of the concept can be stated
as employing smart wireless devices that are furnished with awareness, sens-
ing, learning, and adaptation capabilities in order to utilize the available radio
resources as eﬃciently as possible.
Since the concept of cognitive radio is still at the stage of being developed,
there is no consensus on what kind of wireless technologies to employ for
realizing it. There are a number of requirements a wireless system has to
satisfy in order to be considered a suitable candidate for cognitive radio. These
requirements include causing no interference to licensed systems, having an
adjustable pulse shape, bandwidth, and transmit power, supporting various
throughputs, providing adaptive multiple access, and ensuring the security
of information. When the wireless systems that are potential candidates for
cognitive radio are considered, Ultra Wideband (UWB) seems to be one of
the tempting choices because it has an inherent potential to fulﬁll some of
the key cognitive radio requirements. Therefore, the focus of this chapter will
be on UWB and its suitability for cognitive radio. However, it is worth to
stress that a cognitive radio might have the ability to synthesize and process
various waveforms and wireless technologies. In this chapter, it is not claimed
that a cognitive wireless system with only the UWB capability can handle
all the requirements of the ideal cognitive radio. Instead, we would like to
show how UWB can accommodate some of the major requirements and can
be incorporated to cognitive radio devices as an access technology.
Although the term ultra wideband can be used to describe any wireless sys-
tem that has a bandwidth greater than 500 MHz or a fractional bandwidth1

edge frequencies, respectively.

greater than 0.2, the number of commonly proposed technologies to imple-
ment UWB is limited to two. These two technologies are the Orthogonal
Frequency Division Multiplexing based UWB (UWB-OFDM) and the im-
pulse radio based UWB (IR-UWB). Throughout this chapter, the impulse
radio option will be considered as the means of realizing ultra wideband. The
OFDM technology (in a broader sense) is discussed in detail in Chapter 11.
Ultra wideband systems have been attracting an intense attention from
both the industry and academic world since 2002, when the United States
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released a spectral mask oﬃ-
cially allowing the unlicensed usage of UWB. Under the current regulation,
UWB is a promising technology for future short and medium range wireless
communication networks with a variety of throughput options including very
high data rates. UWB’s most signiﬁcant property is that it can coexist in the
same temporal, spatial, and spectral domains with other licensed/unlicensed
radios because it is an underlay system. Other tempting features of UWB
include that it has a multi-dimensional ﬂexibility involving adaptable pulse
shape, bandwidth, data rate, and transmit power. On top of these, UWB has
a low-power consumption, and it allows signiﬁcantly low complexity trans-
ceivers leading to a limited system cost. It also has an advanced multipath
resolution capability. Another very important feature of UWB is providing se-
cure communications. It is very hard to detect UWB transmission as its power
spectrum is embedded into the noise ﬂoor. This feature introduces very secure
transmission in addition to other possible higher layer encryption techniques.
The attractiveness of UWB for cognitive radio is not limited to the inher-
ent attributes of this technology. UWB oﬀers some exceptional uses that can
add a number of extra intellective features to cognitive systems. These special
uses are brought by the high multipath resolution property, which enables
UWB to act as an accurate radar, ranging, and positioning system. Exam-
ples of speciﬁc UWB features include sensing the physical environment to
enable situation awareness, providing geographical location information, and
specifying the mobile communication parameters when one or more parties of
communication are nomadic.
The fundamental ideas that constitute the cognitive radio concept are
not restricted to optimizing the spectrum usage. Cognitive radio’s awareness
about temporary conditions and needs of the user, for example, is also a
very signiﬁcant issue. Regarding providing user awareness, UWB has a very
distinguished feature. The extremely ﬁne multipath resolution of UWB can
even make it possible to image diﬀerent organs and tissues inside the body of
the cognitive radio user, and more surprisingly, to ﬁnd the densities of certain
substances in the content of the user’s blood. Therefore, this UWB feature can
be utilized to determine the biomedical conditions of the cognitive radio user
to optimize his/her making use of the cognitive radio. Similarly, other user
contextual awareness information can be obtained using UWB. For example,
the ﬁne resolution capability can tell where exactly the user is, i.e. the UWB
can capture images of the user environment (like a camera) and can tell how

12 UWB Cognitive Radio
357
far the objects are from the user, or what type of objects are around the user,
etc. This is especially important for safety, security, and rescue operations.
If a victim is stuck under a rubble after an earthquake, and if the rescue
team is able to detect the victim, but the victim is not able to describe the
condition and the environment, the radio with UWB capability could do this
automatically.
Owing to all its distinctive properties mentioned, in this chapter, impulse
radio based UWB is considered as one of the enabling/access technologies of
cognitive radio. In the remainder of the chapter, the suitability of IR-UWB for
being employed in cognitive communications is proven by two means. First, a
number of one-to-one matches between the cognitive radio requirements and
IR-UWB properties are revealed; and second, some supplementary uses of IR-
UWB that can be utilized by cognitive radio systems are proposed, and their
feasibility is demonstrated.
The ﬂow of the chapter is as follows. In Section 12.2, the implementation of
impulse radio is discussed. Section 12.3 addresses a number of IR-UWB prop-
erties that are tempting for cognitive radio. In Section 12.4, various approaches
that aim either at realizing cognitive radio via IR-UWB or at making use of
UWB to enhance cognitive radio systems are investigated. Finally, Section
12.5 concludes the chapter by summarizing the ideas conveyed throughout
the chapter.
12.2 Fundamentals of Impulse Radio Ultra Wideband
Impulse radio based implementation of UWB is carried out by transmitting
extremely short, low-power pulses that are on the order of nanoseconds [2,3].
According to the current FCC regulations in the USA, UWB systems are
allowed to operate in the 3.1–10.6 GHz band without a license requirement.
However, the transmit power of these systems is strictly limited. As shown in
Figure 12.1, both in indoors and outdoors, UWB systems are not permitted

to transmit more than −42 dBm/MHz in the speciﬁed band. This limitation
ensures that the UWB systems do not aﬀect the licensed operators that use
various frequency bands inside the UWB band. However, it should also be
kept in mind that it is not unlikely that revisions can be made in the UWB
related FCC regulations, especially regarding the transmit power limits. In
the near future, if the UWB radios are provided with cognitive properties
that allow them to sense the spectrum to determine the occupancy of their
target bands and to ensure not interfering with licensed users, it is possible
that regulatory agencies may consider to oﬀer more freedom to UWB.
Impulse radio UWB is advantageous in that it enables to employ vari-
ous types of modulations, including On–OﬀKeying (OOK), Pulse Amplitude
Modulation (PAM), Pulse Shape Modulation (PSM), Pulse Interval Mod-
ulation (PIM), Pulse Position Modulation (PPM), and Phase Shift Keying
(PSK) [4]. Some of these modulation types are illustrated in Figure 12.2. This
variety of modulation choices adds another dimension to the adaptive prop-
erties of UWB. For example, in case of limited available transmit power, a
UWB transceiver may choose binary PSK to obtain power eﬃciency. If the
spectral spikes that occur due to the periodicity of the transmitted pulses
cause a problem, again, BPSK may be a desirable solution. If there is a con-
cern about the complexity and cost of the transceiver, on the other hand,
then PAM, PPM, and OOK become preferable over BPSK. When M-ary
modulation is applied, PPM can be favored over PAM because of its better
performance, as long as the decreased data rate in PPM due to the longer
symbol duration is acceptable. In [5], a pseudo-random modulation index is
proposed for PPM to mitigate the eﬀect of cross-modulation interference. It
is demonstrated that the randomness in the pulse positions can increase the
robustness of UWB signal reception. This approach can be utilized for adding
another dimension of adaptivity to PPM by determining the modulation index
in an adaptive manner according to the channel conditions. All these examples
indicate the importance of UWB’s being able to select the type of modula-
tion in an adaptive manner according to the system design requirements and
available resources.
In Figure 12.3, the building blocks of UWB signals are shown as chips,
frames, symbols, and blocks. For multi-user access, IR-UWB systems employ
Time Hopping (TH) codes that are speciﬁc to each user [6]. In Figure 12.3,
a Time Hopping Ultra Wideband (TH-UWB) system is demonstrated. In the

illustrated scenario, each information carrying symbol is transmitted with
four pulses. Pulses occupy a location in the time frame based on the speciﬁc
Pseudo-random Noise (PN) code assigned for each user. Two diﬀerent codes
(for two diﬀerent users) and the corresponding pulse locations are shown in
the ﬁgure. Note that these two codes are orthogonal (i.e. they do not overlap
with each other). This simple scenario indicates how conveniently UWB can
provide access to multiple users. The multi-user parameters can be adaptively
modiﬁed according to the change in number of users. To enable more users
to communicate, for example, the UWB system can increase the number of
chips in each frame at the expense of decreasing each user’s data rate. Besides
this, as shown in the illustrated scenario, by assigning user speciﬁc PN codes
the UWB system ensures additional security for each user.
The receiver types that can be utilized for IR-UWB communications are
also various and include coherent receivers (such as Rake and correlator
receivers) as well as non-coherent ones such as energy detector and transmitted
reference receivers, which can be seen in Figure 12.4. In wireless communi-
cations, the choice of the receiver generally depends on hardware complexity
and cost, throughput requirement, and targeted Quality-of-Service (QoS). In
the case of UWB, however, also channel conditions become one of the pri-
mary factors. The power delay proﬁle of the UWB channel can be various
depending on the physical environment. Channel impulse response examples
for CM1 and CM4 [7] are illustrated in Figure 12.5. The ﬁrst channel response
reﬂects short distance (up to 4 m), Line-of-Sight (LOS) channel conditions,
whereas the second one is a long distance (10 m and above), non-LOS chan-
nel. The main diﬀerence between these two channels is that the energy is
spread over a much longer time frame because of the relatively much higher
number of multipaths in the latter one. In UWB signal reception, coherent
receivers are preferred due to their high power eﬃciency, which they owe to

their advanced ability to collect multipath energy. However, implementation
of such receivers requires estimation of a priori channel information regarding
the timing, fading coeﬃcient, and the pulse shape for each individual channel
tap. Coherent signal reception also mandates a high sampling rate and an
accurate synchronization. Therefore, coherent receivers have a high complex-
ity, and may be feasible only when the number of channel taps is limited, or

12 UWB Cognitive Radio
361
the targeted reception quality is high regardless of the hardware cost. On the
other hand, non-coherent receivers have less stringent a priori information
requirements and can be implemented with lower complexity. For example,
in transmitted reference (TR) UWB systems, a reference pulse that includes
the channel information is transmitted along with the information bearing
pulse. In the receiver part, these two pulses are correlated with each other,
and this way, the need for estimating the channel parameters is eliminated.
Non-coherent receivers can be desirable in cases where the complexity and
cost are the limiting factors, and QoS is not a primary concern. In short, the
variety of employable receivers make UWB a tempting choice under various
system design considerations and physical conditions.
Along with the ﬂexibility in modulation methods and receiver types, IR-
UWB also oﬀers a variety of options regarding the shapes of the transmitted
pulses. Employing various pulse shapes provides the UWB system with a spec-
trum shaping capability that allows it to adapt to changing spectral condi-
tions. Along with the primary pulse shaping options, which are the Gaussian
pulses [8] and the prolate spheroidal wavelet functions [9, 10], raised cosine
windowing based pulse shaping (analyzed in Section 12.4) can be considered
for impulse radio. Other various analog and digital methods to implement
pulse shaping for impulse radio can be found (among others) in [11–16].
UWB has a considerable resistance against the Multi-user Access Inter-
ference (MAI), which is investigated in detail in [17–21]. The IR-UWB sys-
tems are immune to not only MAI, but also against Narrowband Interference
(NBI), which is caused by the licensed and unlicensed systems that exist in
the frequency band occupied by the UWB system [22–24].
Besides being a communication system, IR-UWB is a precise radar tech-
nology as well as a highly accurate ranging and positioning system. These
extra features are owed to the fact that IR-UWB systems have an excellent
multipath resolving capability because of the extremely wide frequency band
that they occupy. The UWB system can be used as a very precise radar
because of the following reason. Short pilot pulses transmitted by a UWB
transmitter are reﬂected, scattered, and refracted by the objects in the physi-
cal environment. The resolving capability allows the receiver part of the UWB
system to distinguish between the arriving signals from objects that are very
close to each other. This way, the UWB system can detect the physical details
of objects like a high resolution radar. The ability to separate the signals in
time that reach at the receiver through diﬀerent paths can be utilized to
determine the duration that is needed for the signals to travel the distance
between the transmitter and receiver. This feature can be utilized to make
an accurate range estimation. By combining the range estimates obtained by
various UWB transceivers, a position estimation can be achieved that has an
inaccuracy limited to a couple of centimeters.

12.3 Cognitive Radio Requirements vs. IR-UWB
Features
One of the main goals targeted with cognitive radio is to utilize the existing
radio resources in the most eﬃcient way. To ensure the optimum utilization,
cognitive radio requires a number of conditions to be satisﬁed. A wireless
system that is a potential candidate for cognitive radio applications is expected
to fulﬁll some of these conditions.
The primary cognitive radio requirements include
• negligible interference to licensed systems and ability to avoid/cancel in-
terference (such as NBI, MAI),
• capability to adapt itself to various link qualities (link adaptation capa-
bility),
• ability to sense and measure critical parameters about the environment,
channel, etc. using the received signal (the internal/self measurement and
sensing capability),
• ability to exploit variety of spectral opportunity (related to bandwidth
adaptation), and
• ﬂexible pulse shape and bandwidth, adaptable data rate, transmit power,
information security, and limited cost.
At this point, if the main properties of impulse radio based UWB are
considered, it is seen that there is a strong match between what the cognitive
radio requires and what IR-UWB oﬀers. In the following, the primary features
of IR-UWB will be investigated from the point of satisfying the requirements
of cognitive radio.
12.3.1 Limited Interference to Licensed Systems
Cognitive radios aim at an opportunistic usage of frequency bands that are
owned by their licensed users. Since the licensed users will not necessarily be
willing to share the spectra that they have paid for with unlicensed users,
it is the responsibility of the cognitive radio system to make sure that its
existence is not felt by the licensed user. Hence, one of the most signiﬁcant
requirements of cognitive radio is that the interference caused by cognitive
devices to licensed users remains at a negligible level.
Oﬀering the possibility of being implemented both in underlay and overlay
modes, IR-UWB has a signiﬁcant potential for fulﬁlling the limited interfer-
ence requirement of cognitive radio. The diﬀerence between the two modes of
impulse radio operation is the amount of transmitted power. In the underlay
mode, IR-UWB has a considerably restricted power, which is spread over a
wide frequency band. In this mode, it complies with the corresponding reg-
ulations of the FCC in the USA. When an IR-UWB system is operating in
the underlay mode, it is quite unlikely that any coexisting licensed systems
are aﬀected from it. On top of this, underlay IR-UWB can employ various

12 UWB Cognitive Radio
363
narrowband interference avoidance methods such as pulse shaping [25], time-
hopping code adjustment [26], and antenna design [27] to abstain interfering
with licensed systems.2 Therefore, from the point of licensed narrowband sys-
tems that reside inside the UWB spectrum, underlay IR-UWB is a stealth way
of wireless communication because its signals are undetectable.
In the overlay mode, on the other hand, the transmitted power can be
as high as the upper limits for electromagnetic emission set by the regula-
tory agencies. The overlay mode impulse radio is only applicable if the UWB
transmitter ensures that the targeted spectrum is completely free of signals
of other systems, i.e. there are no other licensed or unlicensed systems uti-
lizing the same band, and, of course, if the regulations allow this mode of
operation. If these conditions are met, the transmitted UWB power can be
increased to a certain level that is comparable to the power of licensed sys-
tems. UWB can also operate simultaneously in both underlay and overlay
modes. Depending on the spectrum opportunities, the signaling and the spec-
trum of the transmitted signal can be shaped in such a way that part of the
spectrum is occupied in an underlay mode, and some other parts are occu-
pied in an overlay mode. Shaping the spectrum in such a way is possible with
a single simultaneous transmission. Apparently, in either mode of operation,
IR-UWB causes negligible interference to other communication systems, if it
does at all. This special feature of impulse radio makes it very tempting for
the realization of cognitive radio.
12.3.2 Flexibility in Pulseshape/Bandwidth (Dynamic Spectrum)
One of the main features of the cognitive radio concept is that the targeted
frequency spectrum is scanned periodically in order to check its availability
for opportunistic usage. According to the results of this spectrum scan, the
bands that will be utilized for cognitive communication are determined. Since
at diﬀerent times and locations the available bands can vary, cognitive radio
is expected to have a high ﬂexibility in determining the spectrum it occupies.
This requires the cognitive radio to be capable of modifying its transmitted
pulse in such a way that the spectrum of the pulse ﬁts into the available
bands as accurately as possible. Therefore, cognitive radios have to employ
a system that has an advanced capability of adapting the pulse shape to
changing conditions.
Flexible spectrum shaping is a part of IR-UWB’s nature. Since the IR-
UWB communication is basically realized via the transmission of short pulses,
varying the duration or the form of the pulses directly alters the occupied
spectrum. Various pulse shaping options were mentioned in Section 12.2. An
IR-UWB transmitter can select one of these pulse shapes, and the occupied
spectrum will change according to this selection. This attribute of IR-UWB

methods in UWB systems, the reader can be referred to [22].

is excellent from the point of satisfying the dynamic spectrum requirement of
cognitive radio.
12.3.3 Dynamically Adjustable Data Rate and Quality-of-Service
Cognitive radio aims at using licensed frequency bands opportunistically by
utilizing them when they are not being accessed by their licensed users.
Although this sounds like free and unlimited communications in the ﬁrst
glance (which is partially true), it should be kept in mind that the conti-
nuity of cognitive radio communications depends on the availability of unused
bands. Any increase in the utilization of the bands by the licensed systems
directly results in narrowed freedom for the cognitive radio, which can force
it to decrease its data rate and quality-of-service, or even to terminate its
communication. Therefore, any system that is a candidate for being employed
by cognitive radio should have the capability of dynamically adjusting the
throughput. Such systems may also be expected to provide a solution for
the cases when the available bandwidth is so limited that the communication
cannot be continued (i.e. for dropped calls).
An impulse radio based UWB system is able to make abrupt changes in
its data rate. According to the simple scenario illustrated in the ﬁrst ﬁgure in
Table 12.1, if the amount of available band decreases, the only thing impulse
radio has to do is to elongate the transmitted pulses such that less band-
width is occupied, and the data rate is decreased. If there is more band to
use, it can respond by doing the opposite. Therefore, it satisfactorily meets
the adjustable data rate necessity of cognitive radio. The adjustment of the
occupied bandwidth may not always be that simple. The available bands can
be anywhere in the frequency spectrum, and their widths can vary. This may
require the IR-UWB transmitters to include hardware capable of transmitting
and receiving various types of UWB pulses with diﬀerent spectral features.
In some cases, the interference from UWB systems to licensed users may
become unusually eﬀective. This is most likely to occur when the UWB trans-
ceiver is physically very close to the licensed system’s transceiver. In such
a case, the interference can be mitigated by decreasing the duty cycle of the
UWB system rather than modifying its bandwidth. The duty cycle can be low-
ered by decreasing the number of pulses per frame, which, again, corresponds
to decreasing the data rate. A lowered duty cycle leads to less coexistence
in time of these two systems. Therefore, the increase in the licensed system’s
Bit-Error-Rate (BER) due to the UWB interference can be diminished by
decreasing the duty cycle.
On top of its ﬂexible data rate property, IR-UWB provides an exceptional
solution regarding the dropped calls. As mentioned earlier, IR-UWB can be
performed both in underlay and overlay modes. Assuming that the normal
operation mode is overlay, in cases when it becomes impossible to perpetuate
the communication, IR-UWB can switch to the underlay mode (as illustrated
in Table 12.1). Since the licensed systems are not aﬀected by the impulse radio

Impulse Radio UWB is implemented via the trans-
mission of short pulses. Therefore, varying the 
duration and form of the pulses directly alters the
occupied spectrum. This makes flexible spectrum
shaping a part of IR-UWB’s nature. The figure
illustrates the adjustment of the occupied bandwidth
by modifying the pulse duration.       
In case of decreasing communication link quality, IR-
UWB boosts the processing gain at the expense of
lowering the datarate. This way, the Qos is maintained.
The trade-off between the processing gain and
the data rate is demonstrated in the figure. This
feature can be especially useful if the link quality is
not high due to NLOS conditions or increased
distance between the transmitter and receiver.         
IR-UWB can be performed both in underlay and
overlay modes. If the normal operation mode is 
overlay, in cases when the number of licensed users 
increases, IR-UWB can switch to the underlay mode 
as illustrated in the figure. Since the licensed systems 
are not affected when it is in the underaly mode, the 
IR-UWB  communication  link can be maintained, and 
thus, any discontinuity in the communication  can be 
prevented.

when it is in the underlay mode, this gives the IR-UWB the opportunity to
maintain the communication link even though it is at a low quality.
If the quality of the communication link between the transmitter and
receiver decreases due to any reason, IR-UWB can maintain the QoS by lower-
ing the data rate and boosting the processing gain. The trade-oﬀbetween the
processing gain and the data rate is illustrated in Table 12.1. This feature can
be especially useful if the link quality is not high due to non-existence of a LOS
path or increased distance between the transmitter and receiver. The dynamic
QoS adjustment feature of IR-UWB systems can be of vital usefulness in cer-
tain cognitive radio applications that cannot tolerate any discontinuity in the
communication.

12.3.4 Adaptable Transmit Power
The existence of licensed systems and other unlicensed users is not the only
limitation regarding the secondary usage of spectrum. The spectral masks
that are imposed by the regulatory agencies are also determinative in spec-
trum usage in that they set a limit to the transmit power of wireless systems.
These masks may have been set to regulate the usage of spectrum both in
underlay and overlay modes. Even though cognitive radio is conceptualized
to make use of the spectrum to the maximum extent, it cannot ignore these
power limitations. Taking into account that the spectral masks can be totally
diﬀerent at diﬀerent locations (and even at diﬀerent times in the same loca-
tion), a cognitive radio system may have to modify its transmitted power on
a frequent basis.
IR-UWB oﬀers a satisfactory solution to the adaptable transmit power
requirement of cognitive radio. Since the impulse radio is based on the trans-
mission of separate pulses, adapting the total transmit power is as simple
and convenient as modifying the power of a single pulse. Based on the pulse
shaping method employed, adaptation of pulse power can be accomplished by
changing the pulse amplitude as well as by using diﬀerent order derivatives of
a given basis pulse. By adapting its transmit power, impulse radio can comply
with any set of spectral rules mandated upon the cognitive radio system.
12.3.5 Adaptive Multiple Access
The cognitive radio concept includes free utilization of frequency bands that
are temporarily not used by their licensed owners. Since this sounds to be a
very tempting promise, it is not hard to imagine that there will be a num-
ber of users willing to make use of the same opportunity bands at the same
time. Therefore, cognitive radio networks should be able to provide access to
multiple users simultaneously and in a robust manner.
During the operation of a cognitive radio, changes may occur in the overall
spectrum occupancy, or the signal quality observed by each user can ﬂuctuate
because of various factors. These changes may require the cognitive radio to
modify its multiple access parameters accordingly. For example, if the amount
of opportunity bands declines because of increasing number of licensed users,
the cognitive radio is forced either to decrease the number of cognitive users or
to lower the upper data rate it oﬀers to each user. Another example can be a
cognitive network where the users are mobile. Since the positions of users are
changing continuously, their received signal strengths may vary considerably
in time. This would require the cognitive system to keep track of each user’s
signal quality and adapt the transmission parameters accordingly. Therefore,
cognitive radio systems have to employ a technology that is capable of adap-
tively changing its multiple access parameters.
IR-UWB is very ﬂexible in terms of multiple access. By changing the
number of chips in a frame, the number of multiple users can be determined.

12 UWB Cognitive Radio
367
The duty cycle in a frame can be adjusted according to the state of spectral
occupancy. More importantly, the data rate and the processing gain, as well
as the transmit power level and even the type of modulation can be adjusted
for each user separately according to the user’s distance, temporary fading
conditions, and noise level [28]. This allows the IR-UWB system to optimize
the service it provides to its users both from throughput and signal quality
perspectives. Therefore, also from the point of adaptive multiple access, IR-
UWB proves to be a proper candidate for cognitive radio applications.
12.3.6 Information Security
The primary objectives targeted with cognitive radio include preserving the
privacy of information. This can be a vital necessity especially in military
communications.
In many communication systems, the security of information is guaranteed
by using an excessive amount of encryption. Encryption schemes, which are
only known by the transmitter and the targeted receiver, prevent unwanted
users to eavesdrop on the communication. In some other systems, informa-
tion security is an inherent attribute of the physical layer employed. Direct
Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) systems and frequency hopping systems,
which can be considered as examples for such technologies, enable secure com-
munication by assigning each user a speciﬁc spreading code or a hopping se-
quence. This way a number of users can utilize the same frequency band or
the same chunk of frequencies without listening to each other.
Impulse radio UWB is also one of the systems that have information
security in their nature. As it was pointed out in the discussion regarding
the UWB interference on other systems, underlay mode UWB is a stealth
communication technology because for unwanted users it is impossible to
detect even the existence of the UWB signals. Therefore, underlay UWB is a
highly secure means of exchanging information. Overlay mode UWB, on the
other hand, can also be considered a safe communication method. In overlay
UWB, if time hopping is employed for multiple access, diﬀerent UWB users
are assigned diﬀerent time hopping sequences. If multiple accessing is enabled
by direct sequencing, each user has a speciﬁc spreading code. Therefore, the
reception of a user’s information is only possible if the exact knowledge about
the user’s access code is available. Hence, ensuring the privacy of multiple
accessing codes ensures the security of information in UWB communications.
Apparently, UWB is a secure way of communicating in both its underlay and
overlay modes. Therefore, UWB proves to be a strong candidate for cogni-
tive radio applications also from the point of guaranteeing the information
security.
12.3.7 Limited Cost
One of the primary conditions for long-lasting market success of any wire-
less technology is an aﬀordable cost. This economical condition applies to

368

all components of a radio system including the infrastructure expenses, base
station and transceiver costs, and service charges. Being a future wireless con-
cept, cognitive radio also targets at a low cost for each of its components. This
is necessary for the system to be able to reﬂect the proﬁt earned by using the
spectrum in an opportunistic way (rather than purchasing a license) to its
subscribers.
Impulse radio UWB signals, which are basically simple pulses, can be gen-
erated and processed by inexpensive analog transmitter and receiver circuitries
(unless the pulses need to be generated by digital means for a precise spec-
trum shaping, which may increase the cost of the circuitry). The RF front-end
required to send and capture the UWB signals are also quite uncomplicated
and they are available for reasonable prices. Therefore, impulse radio UWB
communication can be accomplished by employing very low cost transmit-
ter and receivers. This property of impulse radio makes it very attractive for
cognitive radio, which aims at limited infrastructure and transceiver costs.
12.4 Merging Impulse Radio with Cognitive Radio
As it is pointed out throughout the previous section, the impulse radio UWB
is highly competent in satisfying the basic requirements of the cognitive radio
concept. Therefore, merging IR-UWB into the cognitive radio could be very
instrumental for the successful penetration of cognitive radio into the wireless
world.
Combining UWB with cognitive radio can be mainly accomplished in two
ways. The ﬁrst one is performing the practical implementation of cognitive
radio directly via impulse radio. The second way is to supplement cognitive
radio with IR-UWB through various methods. In the following, these two
options will be investigated in detail.
12.4.1 Implementing Cognitive Radio via Impulse Radio
Owing to its very tempting adaptive features addressed in Section 12.3, im-
pulse radio UWB can be considered a means of realizing cognitive radio. Since
the pulses transmitted by IR-UWB are very inﬂuential on the spectrum oc-
cupied, a careful selection of the set of pulses to be utilized is essential for an
opportunistic spectrum usage. In the remainder of this section, an IR-UWB
implementation method that employs pulses shaped by raised cosine (or root
raised cosine) windows is going to be provided as a case study.
Raised cosine (and root raised cosine) windows, which can be exempliﬁed
as in Figure 12.6a (and b), can be an attractive means for generating special
pulses that
• have sharp fall-oﬀs and suppressed side lobes in the frequency domain,
• are limited both in time and bandwidth, and
• have a pulse width and bandwidth that can be controlled simultaneously.

roll-oﬀfactors α = 0.3 and α = 0.9. b – Root raised cosine windows with roll-oﬀ
factors α = 0.3 and α = 0.9.
Therefore, a method that uses pulses generated by means of raised cosine
windowing can lead to a very eﬃcient spectrum usage. In this method, it is
assumed that detailed information about the spectrum opportunities, which
are licensed bands temporarily not being used by their owners, is available
through the spectrum sensing performed. The ﬁrst step is to determine the
center frequencies and bandwidths of each spectrum opportunity. Cognitive
radio devices are expected to have the facility to allow users to load infor-
mation and statistics, which can be recalled and processed when needed.
Hence, it can be conveniently assumed that information regarding the tempo-
ral and spectral properties of a number of raised cosine windows is available
in cognitive radio’s memory. Therefore, in the second step of implementa-
tion, cognitive radio selects the raised cosine windows that are most suitable
for each of the spectrum opportunities determined. It should be noted that
ﬁlling a higher percentage of a white space requires a higher roll-oﬀraised
cosine window, and this corresponds to a longer symbol in time. An elongated
time symbol either leads to inter-symbol interference or forces the system to
set a lower throughput. Therefore, cognitive radio determines the window to
be used according to the amount of available bandwidth and the data rate
aimed. The selected windows are mixed with locally generated (analog or
digital) cosine signals yielding

(12.2)
and this combined pulse ﬁlls the targeted opportunities as shown in
Figure 12.7f.
As it has been demonstrated with the raised cosine windowing based im-
plementation method, impulse radio based UWB technologies can be a conve-
nient way of realizing cognitive radio. However, it has to be kept in mind that
under the current FCC regulations in the USA, the overlay mode of UWB is
not permitted, and it is reasonable to consider that similar spectral limitations

12 UWB Cognitive Radio
371
will be mandated upon UWB systems in other regions of the world, as well.
Under these conditions, it should be stated that IR-UWB can be the technol-
ogy for cognitive radio only when the regulatory agencies are convinced that
IR-UWB devices are equipped with advanced sensing and spectrum shaping
capabilities that leave zero possibility to interfering with licensed users.
12.4.2 Various Ways of Supplementing CR with IR-UWB
Due to the spectrum regulations of today, which prohibit employing UWB
systems in the overlay mode, IR-UWB based implementation of cognitive
radio might not become a reality in the near future. However, besides being a
strong candidate for practical cognitive radio implementation, IR-UWB can
be considered as a supplement to cognitive radio systems that are realized
by means of other wireless technologies. Therefore, it can be concluded that
this way or the other, UWB will be an inseparable part of cognitive radio
applications.
IR-UWB can oﬀer various kinds of support to cognitive radios. These
include sharing the spectrum sensing information via IR-UWB, locating the
cognitive nodes in a cognitive network by means of IR-UWB, sensing the
physical environment/channel with IR-Radar, and sensing the cognitive user’s
physical conditions. In the following, each of these supplementary uses of
IR-UWB will be discussed in detail.
Spectrum Sensing Information Exchange in Cognitive Networks
In order to be able to opportunistically utilize the available licensed frequency
bands, cognitive radio systems periodically scan their target spectrum and
detect the spectrum opportunities. In cognitive radio communications, it is
mandatory that all parties of communication agree on the spectral opportuni-
ties to be utilized. Therefore, it is a major issue for a cognitive radio device to
share the spectrum sensing information with other cognitive devices. In some
works in the literature, it is considered to have an allocated control channel
to transmit this information [29]. In some other works, it is proposed to have
a centralized controller that gathers this information, decides for spectrum
availability, and allocates distinct bands to diﬀerent cognitive users [30, 31].
An alternative to these methods is to transmit spectrum sensing results via
low-power IR-UWB signaling that complies with the FCC regulations [32].
Since this transmission will be accomplished in an underlay manner, it can
be done simultaneously with the real data communication without aﬀecting
it regardless of the wireless technology employed to realize the cognitive radio
itself. Considering the relatively low throughput needed to transmit the sens-
ing information as well as the low cost transceiver requirement, it turns out to
be a proper option to use an uncomplicated non-coherent receiver such as an

energy detector, and to employ on–oﬀkeying (OOK) modulation.3 By using a
proper mapping scheme (from sensing information to binary codewords), cod-
ing, and OOK modulation, spectrum information can be conveniently shared
between the two parties of cognitive communication.
A cognitive network (see Figure 12.8) can be realized by allowing its nodes
to communicate with each other using UWB to exchange spectrum informa-
tion. One of the aims of cognitive radio is to increase the range of communi-
cation as much as possible, and at the ﬁrst glance, UWB signaling may not
seem to be very appropriate for this purpose because of the limited range
of underlay UWB. The answer to this question can be obtained by looking
at the bit-error-rate expression for OOK modulated UWB signals. This BER
expression can be stated as
BER = Q
(
NsAEp
2N0

,
(12.3)
where Ns is the number of pulses per symbol, A is the pulse amplitude, Ep is
the normalized pulse energy, and the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)
has a double sided spectrum of N0
2 . In this expression, it is seen that increasing
the number of pulses per symbol results in lower BER. Increasing Ns requires a
repeated transmission of data, i.e. processing gain. By applying the necessary

such as estimating the optimal threshold and determining the optimum integra-
tion interval can be found in [33].

12 UWB Cognitive Radio
373
amount of processing gain, it can be made possible that the farthest nodes
in a cognitive network can share the spectrum sensing information. Although
this comes at the expense of lowered throughput, it is not a limiting factor in
this case because a quite low data rate is enough to transmit the spectrum
sensing information. By enabling all the nodes in a cognitive network to talk
to each other via UWB, there is no need
• either to allocate a separate channel for sharing the sensing information,
• or to employ a centralized controller that collects this information,
processes it, and sends it to the cognitive users in the network.
Spectrum information can also be shared in an ad hoc multi-hopping
scheme that uses UWB as it is demonstrated in a simple way in Figure 12.8.
This way, long range transmission is not needed. Multiple nodes collabora-
tively share the information and route this information to other nodes using
low power, low cost UWB technology. In essence, a UWB based sensor network
with the collaboration of multiple radios are formed.
The sensing information received from all the other nodes in the network
can be combined in each node, and pulse design can be done according to the
common white spaces. This way, the range of cognitive communications can
be extended to the coverage area of a medium-sized network. Increasing the
network size results in an increased probability of overlapping with licensed
systems. This fact sets a practical limit to the size of the cognitive network,
because continuing to enlarge the network, the common available spectra be-
come less and less, and after some point their amount becomes insuﬃcient
to ensure the minimum quality-of-service. For the details of how the common
white bands are going to be shared by the cognitive nodes in the network, the
reader can be referred to [34] and [35].
Sharing Various Kinds of Supportive Data via UWB
Cognitive communications do not necessarily have to be based on indoor net-
works that are mostly made up of personal mobile devices. Cognitive networks
can be established to enable military communications or communications at
extreme outdoor conditions such as natural disasters.
In outdoors, the factors aﬀecting the cognitive communications will be
quite diﬀerent than in indoor scenarios. The weather and temperature condi-
tions are among these factors. The range of a wireless device used outdoors can
considerably decrease when there is a thick fog in the air, for example. There-
fore, a moisture level sensor may be very instrumental. To determine rain
and snow, a high resolution camera combined with a Digital Signal Processor
(DSP) that can recognize the type of precipitation, can be utilized. A tem-
perature sensor embedded in the device can help to adjust the temperature
dependent hardware parameters and to verify that the weather condition is
detected correctly.

374
H¨useyin Arslan and Mustafa E. S¸ahin
It is known that wireless systems operating at lower frequencies have bet-
ter penetration capabilities. If a cognitive network has information about the
weather conditions, it can adjust its communication frequency accordingly. In
a foggy environment, for example, the spectral opportunities at lower frequen-
cies can be preferred, or the transmission power can be increased to maintain
the communication range targeted under normal conditions.
It is apparent that it would not be feasible to embed the numerous sensors
or a digital camera and DSP to each outdoor communication device. However,
it would be enough that each of these sensing capabilities exists in only one of
the nodes in a cognitive network, if these nodes were able to communicate the
corresponding data to the other nodes. Ultra wideband can fulﬁll a vital role
for this purpose. As in the case of spectrum sensing information exchange,
any type of data required for outdoor communications can be shared between
the cognitive nodes via ultra wideband simultaneously with the real data.
Locating the Cognitive Nodes via IR-UWB
Owing to the extremely wide band they occupy, IR-UWB systems have an
advanced multipath resolving capability. This desirable feature enables these
systems to be considered as a means of highly accurate (centimeter range)
positioning besides being communication systems [36]. Because of this reason,
IR-UWB is the primary candidate for the IEEE 802.11.4a standardization
group, which aims at determining a new physical layer for very low power,
low data rate communications with a special emphasis on accurate location
ﬁnding.
Details of positioning systems for cognitive radio are discussed in Chapter
10. Here, they will be summarized for the sake of the completeness of this
chapter. Positioning, in general terms, can be done by estimating either the
Angle Of Arrival (AOA), the Signal Strength (SS), or the Time Of Arrival
(TOA).
In AOA based positioning, two reference nodes determine the angle at
which the signal from the target node is arriving, and the location is found by
combining the information from the reference nodes. AOA estimation is not
suitable for IR-UWB positioning mainly because of the very high number of
multipath components. SS based positioning depends on ﬁnding the distance
to the target node by measuring the energy received from that node. This
method requires to employ at least three reference nodes (to implement tri-
angulation). This method is inferior to the TOA estimation based technique
in the case of UWB positioning because it requires an accurate channel esti-
mation and it does not take the advantage of the very wide band occupied.
The position of the target node can also be determined by ﬁnding the TOA
of multipath components of the received signal. The wide bandwidth allows
the IR-UWB receivers to resolve virtually all the multipath components and
to determine the arrival time of each of them. Since these times of arrival pro-
vide an information about the delay that is caused by the propagation in the

12 UWB Cognitive Radio
375
channel, the physical distance between the IR-UWB transmitter and receiver
can be estimated accordingly [37].
The positioning capability can make IR-UWB systems an excellent sup-
plement for small-sized cognitive networks. Since such networks aim at not
interfering with other radios in their physical environment, it can be very
beneﬁcial for them to be able to determine the locations of the nodes in the
network closely.
Having information about the precise locations of the nodes in a cognitive
network, accurate and high eﬃciency beamforming [38] can be achieved to-
wards the direction of the target nodes. Also, spatial nulls can be generated
towards undesired receivers/signal sources to avoid interference. Beamforming
can be accomplished by planar antenna arrays, which can be put onto very
small areas for high frequency systems (such as 60 GHz radios), and these
arrays can be employed even by wireless nodes that are smaller than a hand
palm in size.
The accurate positioning capability of IR-UWB can also be utilized to
determine the transmit power adaptively. Using the positioning data, the dis-
tance between the transmitting and receiving nodes can be found, and based
on the distance information the radiated power can be set. Such an imple-
mentation would not only optimize the power consumption but also help to
ensure the link quality between the distant nodes.
Another nice utilization of the positioning capability can be tracking cogni-
tive nodes or devices that are mobile. Updating the corresponding positioning
information in a frequent manner, a cognitive node can be tracked in space.
This way, any communication link directed to it would not be lost although
its location is changing continuously.
Examples of using the positioning feature to augment the cognitive com-
munication quality can be increased. Many examples of other advantages of
positioning/geolocationing in cognitive radio are given in detail in Chapter 10.
The interested readers are referred to this chapter. All these examples lead to
the idea that IR-UWB can leverage cognitive radio networks by providing a
very strong support through its accurate positioning capability.
Cognitive Node Identiﬁcation via UWB
In cognitive communications, every cognitive device might be given a serial
number when being manufactured. Since this number will be unique to each
cognitive device, it would allow the device to be identiﬁed. Cognitive devices
can transmit their serial numbers steadily via ultra wideband. This way, cog-
nitive devices can recognize each other, and secure cognitive communications
can be established between targeted cognitive nodes. Other useful data can
accompany this serial number, as well. These include
1. A beacon that indicates if the device is currently communicating or it is
in the stand-by mode. This information can be extremely useful because

376
H¨useyin Arslan and Mustafa E. S¸ahin
it would allow spectrum allocations to be done accordingly. If a cognitive
node can inform the other nodes about its existence even if it is not in
the active mode, some bandwidth can be allocated to this sleeping node.
This way, the highest possible number of nodes in a cognitive network can
utilize a given band at the same time.
2. Some short data that identify the device by providing information about
the type of modulation and coding it uses, its bandwidth, and its carrier
frequency. This kind of data can enable diﬀerent types of cognitive radios
recognize each other very easily. Currently, a signiﬁcant concern about the
cognitive radio communications is how to supply the advanced cognitive
devices with spectral sensing capabilities that allow these devices not just
to detect the existence of other systems, but also to determine the type of
modulation and coding they are using. Since this technology requires quite
complex algorithms and very costly hardware, the feasibility of such ad-
vanced cognitive devices becomes questionable. However, if the cognitive
devices provide information about their transmitted signal properties via
UWB, there may be no need for an advanced sensing algorithm, and this
would be a big step toward the realization of the cognitive radio concept.
Providing Awareness via Impulse Radar
Among the various impulse radio applications, impulse radar is one of the
oldest, and it has been used especially for military purposes [39,40]. Practical
implementations of impulse radar have been addressed in [41–46]. As in the
case of the other IR-UWB applications mentioned so far, impulse radar can
improve cognitive communications from a number of aspects when combined
with cognitive radio systems.
A. Sensing the Physical Environment/Channel
One of the potential uses of impulse radar can be to determine objects and
walls in the indoor environments. Determining the objects can yield a rough
estimation of the directions of multipath components, which can improve the
channel estimation. Determining the walls, on the other hand, yields infor-
mation about the physical borders of an indoor network, which may be very
useful when establishing a cognitive network.
In mobile applications, impulse radar can allow to estimate the speed of the
mobile users. Also, it can enable a cognitive mobile device to measure its own
speed. Such a capability would result in being able to estimate the Doppler
spread and the channel coherence time, which are important parameters to
know in mobile communications.
Impulse radar can also be used to detect the movement of human beings in
the wireless channel, which can be very eﬀective on the link quality between
cognitive nodes especially for extremely high frequency systems such as the
60 GHz radios [47].

12 UWB Cognitive Radio
377
B. Sensing the Cognitive User’s Physical Conditions
Cognitive personal communication devices of the future are expected to be
much more user aware than they are today. In commonly used sense, user
awareness includes having information about the user’s preferences about the
electronic device such as language, visual interface, and user menu choices.
User awareness also requires having statistical data regarding user’s habits,
which can be exempliﬁed as the average duration of communication or fre-
quently contacted wireless devices and frequently used services.
In cognitive radios, the user awareness is expected to be improved much
beyond the usual features. For example, cognitive radio can be made aware
of the physical and biomedical conditions of the user to enhance the qual-
ity of communications in a diﬀerent dimension. This kind of awareness can
especially improve the quality of lives of users with certain illnesses and con-
ditions. If speciﬁc indicators of these health problems in the user’s body can
be monitored, the communication of the user can be adjusted according to
his/her current health status. If an emergency case occurs during the com-
munication, the communication can be interrupted, and an emergency center
can be alarmed by the cognitive radio.
Impulse radio radar oﬀers a unique feature to cognitive radio devices to
support them with physical condition awareness. Owing to its extremely high
multipath resolution capability, impulse radar can non-invasively look at var-
ious tissues and organs in human body, and it can even ﬁnd the densities of
certain substances in user’s blood. The possible related capabilities of impulse
radar can be itemized as follows [48]:
• monitoring the contractions of heart and, this way, determining the heart
rate [49],
• detecting chest movements to realize respiratory monitoring,
• imaging the inside of the chest (the lungs),
• imaging the heart (for cardiography purposes), and
• determining the densities of certain substances in user’s blood such as
glucose, urea, and oxygen [50].
Along with the listed uses, imaging capability of impulse radar can be
utilized to investigate the vocal tract of the user to accomplish speaker iden-
tiﬁcation/veriﬁcation.
The capabilities of impulse radar that are not directly related to cognitive
communications but may provide indirect information about the cognitive
radio users are as follows:
• imaging to help diagnosing diseases such as breast cancer and brain tumor,
• fetus imaging in pregnant women and determining the heart and breath
rate of the baby inside the mothers body,
• monitoring Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA).

12.5 Conclusions
In this chapter, the attractiveness of the impulse radio UWB technology
for purposes of implementing cognitive radio is investigated from two main
approaches. The ﬁrst one considers IR-UWB as a direct means of practical
cognitive radio realization. Under this approach, the UWB features such as
negligible interference to licensed systems, dynamically adjustable bandwidth
and data rate, and adaptive transmit power and multiple access are discussed
emphasizing their closeness to the cognitive radio requirements. IR-UWB is
shown to be a proper candidate for implementing the cognitive radio. The
concern regarding IR-UWB’s being the enabling technology of cognitive radio
is that the overlay mode operation of UWB is currently not allowed by reg-
ulatory agencies. Therefore, this option may have to be deferred until it is
proven that licensed systems can co-exist with speciﬁcally designed overlay
UWB systems that have advanced sensing and spectrum shaping capabilities.
The second approach considers IR-UWB as a source of supplementary
uses for cognitive radio. Among the numerous uses that will enhance cognitive
communications, some signiﬁcant ones such as sharing the spectrum sensing
information and other useful data via IR-UWB, locating the cognitive nodes
using IR-UWB, identifying cognitive nodes via UWB, and providing awareness
via impulse radar are addressed in this chapter.
It should be emphasized that even in the case that the impulse radio
UWB is not accepted as the means of implementing the cognitive radio, its
supplementary uses are so beneﬁcial that IR-UWB cannot be separated from
cognitive radio systems of future.

13.1 Introduction
Technology is futile without its application. One of the major driving forces
of a new technology is the combination of man’s endless thirst for knowledge,
unequal intuitive mind, and limitless ambition to better his life. The other
important factor consists of user demand, user necessity, and increasing user
desire to have it all in one single device.
Wireless communication involves accessing and utilizing air spectrum for
communication purpose. More and more devices may fall under the umbrella
of “wireless communication technology” in the near and distant future. For
example, every personal computer may soon be connected to its keyboard
and mouse via the radio medium. This in turn can eliminate hardware man-
ufacturing cost, manual labor for connection, and hardware pollution of the
discarded parts. Wireless technology thus opens up an endless market of wire-
less communication applications.
“Cognitive Radio” (CR) in the wireless world is relatively new and com-
prises of two magical words that encompass everything! It is the radio with
intelligence [1]; capable of using its radio ability in the most optimum manner
by interacting with surrounding environment, learning about the environment,
and using the learned knowledge to improve communication. The traditional
radio on the other hand lacks cognitive intelligence; uses ﬁxed spectrum, spe-
cial purpose hardware dedicated to that spectrum, and its ability is conﬁned
to manufacturer driven speciﬁcations.
In wireless communication today, spectrum partitioning is overcrowded
due to continuous rise of numerous applications. However, the majority of
these spectrum partitioning often remain unused during oﬀ-peak hours. CR
takes advantage of these spectrum holes by intelligently identifying and us-
ing them, and releasing when required by the primary users. CR intelli-
gence is not only limited to unused spectrum usage but can also improve

any communication that fully or partially utilizes the wireless medium.
Figure 13.1 illustrates a generic ﬂow from cognitive concept to the ﬁnal end
user products. It is impossible and unnecessary to include every current and
future envisioned CR application within this chapter. Therefore, the major
ones are presented here.
This chapter is organized as follows. Section 13.2 addresses various wireless
communication applications that utilize cognitive radio. Section 13.3 presents
their major implementation challenges and Section 13.4 presents the conclud-
ing remarks.
13.2 Cognitive Wireless Communication Applications
Cognitive radio comes with multitudes of features. The majority of these
attributes are “Awareness”, “Sensing”, “Learning”, and “Adaptation”. They
are addressed in detail in other chapters while their applications are presented
in this chapter.
CR applications can be broadly categorized into those, which contribute to
the full or partial improvement of system performance in the existing wireless
communications; and into those, which can be beneﬁcial in establishing new
wireless communication. This section will address both of these categories.
Figure 13.2 represents a high level classiﬁcation of possible CR applications.

13 Applications of Cognitive Radio
385
Fig. 13.2. Classiﬁcation of cognitive radio applications.
This classiﬁcation is conducted for better understanding and organization of
each application and their relationship with “cognitive concept”. The ﬁrst
group consists of CR applications contributing to the optimization of various
wireless resources. The second group represents CR applications contributing
to the improvement in communication quality. The third and forth categories
reﬂect CR applications concerning interoperability and service/end user prod-
ucts, respectively.
In general, many of these applications across groups can beneﬁt from each
other, their territories may overlap, and they can (individually or combined)
work together to improve wireless communication. The applications in the fol-
lowing sub-sections are presented as generic overview without going into each
implementation detail. Although, resource optimization and quality enhance-
ment applications are grouped separately, they are closely related and are
addressed under the same section as follows.
13.2.1 Resource Optimization and Quality Enhancing
Applications
Wireless resources are limited. This scarcity in resources demands careful
consideration and planning in their usage. The conventional radio resources
encompass spectrum, hardware/software, network infrastructure, and power.
Cognitive intelligence adds another dimension to these namely “knowledge”.
Figure 13.3 illustrates the major wireless resources that can be optimized
by CR applications. These applications can result in communication quality
improvement as well. Figure 13.4 illustrates generic communication among
various wireless devices, the quality of which can be greatly improved by CR
applications.
Table 13.1 summarizes the various resources and their respective appli-
cations. It is beneﬁcial to address each resource related applications sepa-
rately. Although, one or more resources can work together in the optimization

Knowledge
“Knowledge” is a signiﬁcant resource exploited by cognitive radio to improve
wireless communication. Knowledge comprises of information on the individ-
ual entities within a communication link. Conﬁguration and capability para-
meters of hardware/software, network infrastructure, power, and spectrum
can represent knowledge. Measured and predicted values of channel related
information such as link quality, Signal-to-noise Ratio (SNR), and channel
fading parameters might also be considered as knowledge. Similarly, informa-
tion about user habits, location, and bio-metric information such as thumb
print, voice, and retina print can be considered as knowledge as well.
The traditional wireless systems exploited some of these items in the recent
years through various adaptation techniques. But, cognitive concept has the
potential to bring revolutionary changes in knowledge utilization. The major
tasks to use knowledge can include cognitive awareness of various parame-
ters, tracking their changes, and employing appropriate action. These para-
meters can be provided to the cognitive radio via look-up tables, through the

388
H¨useyin Arslan and Sadia Ahmed
download process from a central/semi-central database, and through a soft-
ware upgrade process. Some parameters can be measured in real or non-real
time as well.
Knowledge utilization tasks can be better understood through some
examples as below:
• Cognitive awareness of channel fading characteristics, channel noise
and/or interference level, and error correction capability can allow appro-
priate selection of Forward Error Correction (FEC) scheme, interleaving
length, modulation order, and type, etc. This in turn, can reduce the
eﬀect of interference, and/or improve signal quality, and/or provide high
data rate transmission.
• Knowledge on selectivity in multi-dimensional channel space can lead to
adjusting various parameters like channel equalizer taps (in frequency
selectivity dimension) [2] as illustrated in Figure 13.5, or channel tracking
memory (in time selectivity dimension), or multi-antenna loading para-
meters (in spatial selectivity dimension).
• Knowledge on transmitted information type such as voice, data, text,
video, audio or images can help determine the most appropriate source
coding technique.
• Network knowledge on available routes, available bridging nodes, and pro-
tocol status of nodes can result in reducing network delay; minimizing
network usage, and providing uninterrupted communication over hetero-
geneous network components.
• Spectrum knowledge beyond the traditional concept of ﬁxed spectrum
can lead to transmission over variable spectrums and variable dimensions
of channel space. This in turn can provide ubiquitous connectivity and
higher achievable data rate as well.
Cognitive radio may also deduce more knowledge from the available infor-
mation. One such case can involve deriving channel characteristics [3] from the
available Global Positioning System (GPS) information. It can subsequently
reduce transmission of channel related information while increasing data rate.
The knowledge utilization tasks discussed so far can be carried out on
individual nodes as well as over multiple nodes in a collaborative manner.
Hardware and Software
Hardware is the physical entity that makes transmission/reception a reality.
For example, two cell phone handsets at the two ends of a communica-
tion represent partial hardware for that speciﬁc connection. The term
“Hardware/Software” represents the hardware/software resources of indi-
vidual nodes within a link. CR enables intelligent utilization of this resource
to improve communication performance.

13 Applications of Cognitive Radio
389
Fig. 13.5. Knowledge eﬀect on other resources.
One of the signiﬁcant Software Deﬁned Radio (SDR) based CR applica-
tions includes partial or full upgrade of hardware through partial and/or full
alteration of software. This in turn can
• reduce hardware replacement need;
• lower hardware manufacturing, replacement, and labor cost;
• provide availability for more applications;
• reduce hardware complexity; and
• eliminate redundant hardware chain.
With extensive deployment of CR, each node may also be able to download
software upgrades from neighboring nodes. They may collaborate with each
other to share hardware/software resources as well.
The other important SDR-based CR applications can include
• Conﬁguration of hardware to operate over any network. For example,
a cell phone operating on a Global System for Mobile Communications
(GSM) network can establish connection over a Wireless Local Area Net-
work (WLAN) in emergency or other situations. Figure 13.6 illustrates
such a scenario.

390
H¨useyin Arslan and Sadia Ahmed
Fig. 13.6. Communication over diverse spectrum and network.
• Conﬁguration of hardware to operate over any spectrum by generating
appropriate waveform [4]. Once a new or more suitable spectrum is sensed
and accessed, CR can adjust its signaling parameters (such as signal band-
width, frequency, modulation, and coding) according to selected spectrum
conditions. This can result in switching onto a new spectrum with im-
proved signal quality, better channel fading characteristics, and reduced
interference eﬀects.
Among non-SDR based CR applications, self diagnosis and heal of hardware
is a signiﬁcant one, where cognitive radio enables autonomous measurement
of hardware usage, detection of damage, and repairing of faulty parts of indi-
vidual nodes. As an outcome, hardware downtime is minimized and usage is
optimized.
Power
Power had been a never ending battle since the birth of wireless communica-
tion. Optimizing power is important for sustained wireless connectivity over
long period of time. At the same time suﬃcient power level is necessary for
maintaining the required link quality within the coverage area.

13 Applications of Cognitive Radio
391
Cognitive intelligence can bring drastic improvements in the power situa-
tion in wireless communications. The major CR applications involving power
can be represented as
• Adaptive power control. Power adjustment according to link quality has
already been implemented in various adaptive wireless systems. However,
these adjustments are mostly rule driven and limited to a certain degree.
The goal of CR applications go beyond these limits to adjust power to
any level for any link quality. Appropriate power control can also ensure
satisfying Federal Communication Commission (FCC) spectrum mask re-
quirement and interference control [5].
• Optimize power by executing auto shut oﬀ; deactivating low priority jobs
(such as continuous spectral monitoring and collaborative sensing) or noti-
fying user when power level reaches a deﬁned emergency threshold. This
can save suﬃcient power for high priority transmission such as a “911” call.
• Allow transmission only upon an audio or visual change of scene. For
example, with a baby monitor set up, CR transmits baby information
only when the baby cries or moves.
• In ad hoc or multi hop networks CR enables the routing protocol to be
aware of available power of other nodes and the routing mechanism is
adopted accordingly.
Spectrum
A whole chapter (Chapter 9) in this book is dedicated for spectrum resource
and for the description of multi-dimensional spectrum space. Therefore, here,
we brieﬂy mention spectrum resource and refer the reader, to Chapter 9 for
the details.
The overcrowded spectrum partitioning impose additional usage of avail-
able spectrum in alternate dimensions and instances (such as diﬀerent times of
day). Cognitive intelligence brought forth a breakthrough in this “additional
usage” of spectrum.
Spectral resources outside the domain of ﬁxed bands can envelop
• any licensed bands that are in use such as GSM bands in cellular;
• any licensed bands that are not in use such as spectrum holes in unused
public safety and commercial TV bands [6];
• any unlicensed bands in use such as Industrial, Scientiﬁc and Medical
(ISM) band;
• any unlicensed bands not in use such as 60 GHz bands; and
• any licensed bands that are auctioned such as Very High Frequency (VHF)
TV bands [7].
Utilizing these additional spectral resources can be tricky. For example,
accessing licensed or unlicensed bands while they are in use need to be carried
out in alternate dimension (such as space, time, subcarrier, spreading code,

392
H¨useyin Arslan and Sadia Ahmed
transmission power, polarization [8]), with controlled power [5] or using mul-
tiple accessing schemes. Utilizing licensed bands that are not in use needs to
be readily vacated when the licensed user returns.
Cognitive radio enables various spectrum utilization tasks to realize
“additional usage” of spectrum. The major spectral tasks are presented as
below:
• Dynamic Spectrum Sensing: Cognitive radio, with its sensing ability,
allow detection of available spectral resources. The spectrum sensing tech-
niques employed by CR can include matched ﬁlter detection, energy dete-
ction, cyclostationary feature detection [9, 10], and interference-speciﬁc
detection [10]. These techniques are presented in detail in Chapter 9.
• Dynamic Spectrum Access: Sensing of available band, is not enough
unless the detected spectrum is accessed and utilized eﬃciently. CR can
dynamically select available spectrum and intelligently adapt its required
parameters to operate on it [1]. The spectrum sharing [11] or spectrum
access can be implemented using centralized, distributed, co-operative,
and non-cooperative schemes [10].
In the presence of multiple spectrum holes, CR can intelligently access the
more suitable ones for present transmission needs.
• Dynamic Spectrum Management:
Dynamic spectrum sensing and
accessing both require cognitive coordination, planning, management, and
characterization of available spectrum for intelligent decision making. This
decision process can be dynamic to use the spectrum opportunity before
it is occupied again.
The major spectrum management tasks performed by CR can incorporate
the following:
– Rules: Identifying policy, etiquette, and other rules applicable to the
identiﬁed spectrum and intelligently handling those rules.
– Duration and release: Estimating the duration of vacant spectrum.
Several users sharing an Radio Frequency (RF) interface can have diﬀer-
ent usage durations. Spectrum release can ideally occur in stages as each
service completes its communications task.
– Prioritize: The available accessed spectrum can be demanded by more
than one nodes simultaneously. Cognitive radio can perform intelligent
prioritizing of their spectrum access.
– Coordination and synchronization: Cognitive spectrum manage-
ment can also account for the destination(s)’s estimated receive capabil-
ities and provision a reliable means of source–destination co-ordination
and spectrum-usage synchronization.
– Interference: Identifying existing active interference-tolerant and
intolerant services who desire the available spectrum.
– Performance metric: Spectrum management can include cogni-
tive decision making to determine if transmission over the new available
spectrum would indeed improve the communication. This can be achieved

13 Applications of Cognitive Radio
393
through metric measurement and assessment of cognitive wireless commu-
nication performance.
In brief, Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM) can allow consumers,
military, government, and civil groups an improved means of information
conveyance, cognition capabilities and knowledge about the locations, path-
distances, trajectories, available radio resources, and desired Quality of Service
(QoS) [8]. As a result, an optimal solution can be obtained for each scenario.
Spectrum sensing, detection, and management tasks can also be carried
out over multiple nodes collaboratively [12]. However, research and implemen-
tation using collaboration need to be investigated further.
As an outcome of spectrum optimization, CR can allow shifting into a new
spectrum with low interference and better SNR quality. CR ability to operate
over diverse spectrums can provide ubiquitous connectivity, higher spectral,
and user capacity and higher data rate. It may be possible to establish com-
munication at any time and anywhere over any dimension (time, frequency,
space, etc.) as long as spectrum is available. Therefore, cognitive radio may
possibly eliminate wireless communication failure due to spectrum shortage
alone.
Network
Network can include all hardware/software resources belonging to source, des-
tination, and intermediate entities engaged and/or will engage in a wireless
communication link. Optimizing network within a speciﬁc link can depend on
individual and/or multiple participating nodes.
The network tasks carried out by CR over individual nodes are addressed
below. However, their eﬀects can inﬂuence the overall network performance.
• Cross Layer Optimization: Cross layer optimization involves optimiz-
ing the functions of multiple protocol stacks jointly. CR can monitor its
protocol stacks intelligently and adapt its protocol composition depending
on application, network, and other needs. The details of the cross-layer
optimization is given in the following chapter.
• Network Learning: Network learning includes utilizing network knowl-
edge to reconﬁgure network parameters. This can, in turn, improve
network capacity, handling of multiple applications, and prioritizing app-
lications at times of network congestion.
There are several collaborative network tasks performed over multiple nodes
and are addressed as follows:
• Optimum Route: Cognitive intelligence can identify an optimum route
and cleverly re-conﬁgure network parameters to use it; resulting in
optimization of network resources and minimization of network delay and
cost. Figure 13.7 illustrates an intelligent route selection for WLAN.

• Topology Change: Topology change involves autonomous change of
network topology to establish and maintain communication between
source and destination.

13 Applications of Cognitive Radio
395
Centralized topology can include central control and peripheral nodes to
be static or mobile [13]. In the event of any node falling out of range, the
central control can use other ﬁxed or mobile cognitive nodes to communi-
cate with the distant node in a relay fashion. In a distributed environment,
with the joining/leaving of a node, cognitive radio can re-arrange its net-
work between source and destination. It can choose the appropriate leader
within a domain of nodes, or sub-nets based on its location, available ra-
dio resources, and behavior patterns. Cognitive devices can act as bridging
nodes between domains of ad-hoc networks or between domains of ad-hoc
and wired network. Thus transforming the conventional networks into
more robust and time-variant topologies.
Depending on the availability of central control, cost, delay, and other
network factors, cognitive radio can establish centralized topology or a
distributed one to optimize the network resources in hand.
• Network Security: The greater availability of network access makes it
more vulnerable to intruders/hackers [14–16]. These intruders can invade
the network and cause temporary or permanent damage [17]. As a conse-
quence, the network communication may be temporarily or permanently
interrupted. Cognitive radio can provide high level of network security
against such catastrophic eﬀect and minimize network disruption.
• Self Diagnosis/Heal of Network: One of the important network tasks
performed by CR is diagnosing its network components and link. This can
involve autonomous measurement of network usage and network dam-
age. CR can thus detect faulty parts and also provide repairing with-
out human intervention. This in turn can minimize network disruption,
downtime, and provide uninterrupted communication between source and
destination.
• Software Upgrade of Network:
Software upgradability involves
upgrading of network components through software modiﬁcation. It can
eliminate the need for recurring replacement of network hardware when
required by a new link or by a new technology.
The CR applications presented so far utilize one or more wireless resources.
Outside this concentration on individual resource related applications, there
are several wireless topics that require attention. These topics are presented
separately in the next discussions.
Interference
Interference is an important topic in wireless communication that prevents
unlimited expansion of communication domain in terms of user, network,
spectrum, space, time, and geographical coverage capacity. Cognitive radio

396

helps mitigate interference issues and provide a powerful reduced interference
or interference free communication system. The interference related applica-
tions can be grouped as follows:
• Self Interference:
The radio medium imposes interference on the
transmitted signal due to multipath fading characteristics of the wire-
less channel. Depending on the operating environment, symbol duration,
mobility, and the technology used, these channel induced interference can
include Inter Symbol Interference (ISI) and/or Inter-carrier Interference
(ICI). CR can dynamically sense frequency and time selectivity of chan-
nel and adjust its own transmitter/receiver parameters against or ICI.
Figure 13.5 brieﬂy illustrates the CR ability to adjust equalization com-
plexity [2] depending on channel characteristics.
• Other User’s Interference:
In a multiple user environment, the sig-
nal of other simultaneous users can cause undesired interference on the
desired user signal. Multiple users may reside at the same instance of a
speciﬁc dimension such as at the same time, on the same frequency band,
or in the same spatial range. Examples of this type of interference and
the corresponding CR applications can be
– Co-Channel Interference (CCI):
In cellular type systems, even
though the users are spatially separated in diﬀerent cells, the simultaneous
user operation on the same frequency can cause CCI. The amount of CCI
can depend on the user location within each cell. Adaptive beamform-
ing, adaptive channel allocation, and adaptive power control according
to varying transmitter–receiver distance [5] can reduce undesired user
interference.
– Adjacent Channel Interference (ACI):
Spectral overlapping
among adjacent channel users can create ACI. On the other hand, this
same spectral overlapping greatly increases spectral eﬃciency. This trade-
oﬀbetween interference and eﬃciency can be optimized with the help of
cognitive radio through adaptive channel allocation and by other means.
– Narrow Band Interference (NBI): Broadband channel users (like
in Ultra Wideband (UWB)) can be heavily eﬀected by narrow band
interferer where interference aﬀects only part of the desired transmission
spectrum. CR can intelligently identify the interfering user and avoid
transmission over that band.
• Interference in Spectrum Sharing:
In a spectrum sharing envi-
ronment, detection of primary user can be tricky [18]. Primary user
detection needs to depend on more than one parameter such as SNR
values, channel fading parameters, spectrum usage statistics, and geo-
graphical location [1]. Cognitive radio can intelligently determine the
presence of primary user and avoid any possible interference on primary
from secondary or vice versa. In order to achieve this, RF environment
monitoring [19] need to be deployed that will detect spectrum holes,
primary user status, and dynamically adapt CR operating parameters.

13 Applications of Cognitive Radio
397
CR can also detect primary presence in a collaborative manner by sharing
the detection task among other nodes [12].
Link Adaptation
The link in wireless communication can include a transmitter, a receiver, and
the wireless channel. The factors inﬂuencing a link can be radio environment,
mobility, data rate, available spectrum, network, and individual application
requirements. Cognitive radio employs various techniques to handle these fac-
tors and maintain desired link quality. Even though a few of these applications
were mentioned in previous discussions, it is beneﬁcial to emphasize them in-
dividually under link adaptation.
• Adaptive Source Coding: CR can utilize knowledge on information
type such as voice, text, video, image, and emergency tone; QoS for each
application, and the available transmission bandwidth [20] to choose ap-
propriate source coding technique for transmission. The source coding
techniques can include adaptive selection of the coding type and coding
rate [21].
• Adaptive Channel Coding: Cognitive awareness of the channel can
optimally decide the appropriate channel coding type, coding rate, in-
terleaving length, and type [21]. CR can also dynamically adjust these
parameters to adapt to changes in channel characteristics. This in turn,
can autonomously adjust number of transmitted bits to increase or de-
crease redundancy, and maintain desired link quality. For example, if a
strong FEC and interleaving is provided for robustness against the worst
channel impairments for all times, the data rate, latency, and spectral ef-
ﬁciency will be sacriﬁced at times of improved link quality. Therefore, it
is essential to adapt the coding rate based on the link quality.
• Adaptive Modulation: Cognitive utilization of channel quality, desired
data rate, available channel bandwidth, and desired link quality can lead
to the optimum choice of modulation/demodulation type, order, and for-
mat [21]. This can result in improved BER, data rate, communication
robustness, and range. For example, Higher Order Modulations (HOM)
allow higher number of bits to be transmitted for a given symbol rate.
On the other hand, HOM is less power eﬃcient, since it requires higher
energy to maintain a given BER. Therefore, HOM should be used only
when the link quality is high.
A few scenarios are addressed below in order to emphasize modulation
and coding adaptation according to link quality. Upon measuring the link
quality regularly, the most appropriate modulation and coding scheme
can be assigned for the next transmission interval. In incremental redun-
dancy scheme, information is ﬁrst transmitted with high coding rate. This
results in a high bit rate provided that the receiver is capable of decod-
ing the received information. However, if decoding fails with such a high

398
H¨useyin Arslan and Sadia Ahmed
rate, additional coded bits (redundancy) needs to be sent for successful
decoding of transmitted bits. At the same time, sending extra coded bits
reduces the resulting bit rate incrementally and adds extra delay. There-
fore, the initial code rate and modulation for the incremental redundancy
scheme is based on measurements of the link quality instead of starting at
an arbitrary rate. As a result, the combination of incremental redundancy
with adaptive initial code rate lowers delays, lowers memory requirements,
and at the same time achieves high data rates. The diﬀerent initial code
rates can be obtained by puncturing a diﬀerent number of bits from a
common convolution code (for example, a rate of 1/3 or 1/2). Incremen-
tal redundancy operation is enabled by puncturing a diﬀerent set of bits
each time a block is retransmitted, whereby the code rate is gradually
decreased toward the mother code rate for every new transmission of the
block.
Adaptive modulation and coding attracted many new generation wireless
standards as an option to increase the data rates. In conjunction with the
advanced receiver algorithms that reduce the required SINR, a better link
quality can be exploited to increase the data rates further. The combina-
tion of adaptive modulation with multi-antenna transmitter and Multiple
Input Multiple Output (MIMO) schemes based on the feedbacks related
to channel estimates, channel quality, channel correlation etc. is one of the
interesting research areas that exploits the information on link quality and
channel selectivity. Based on the channel feedback information, the modu-
lation type on multi-antenna transmitters can be varied. In a similar way,
adapting the source coding with the channel coding and/or modulation is
another interesting area of focus utilizing link adaptation. For example,
Adaptive Multi Rate (AMR) codec allows to change the compression rate
of speech depending on the link quality, as in GSM AMR. For weak link
conditions, where heavy FEC is required, AMR has the ability to decrease
the codec rate (more speech compression) to allocate more bits for FEC.
• Adaptive Carrier Frequency Selection: CR can sense the available
spectrum and accordingly adapt its carrier frequency and cell assignment
as in a cellular service [21].
The introduction of cellular technology led to eﬃcient usage of ﬁnite spec-
trum through a concept called frequency reuse. However, the capacity
of cellular systems is interference limited, dominated by CCI and ACI.
Early cellular systems aimed to avoid these major interference eﬀects by
designing the system for the worst case interference conditions and ﬁxed
channel allocation. This is often achieved by employing lower frequency
re-use and by allowing enough carrier spacing between adjacent channels
where both techniques sacriﬁced on spectral eﬃciency. Dynamic chan-
nel assignments relative to current interference, propagation, and traﬃc
conditions is an improvement over ﬁxed channel allocation that substan-
tially increases spectral eﬃciency. In traditional cellular system designs,

13 Applications of Cognitive Radio
399
the channel frequencies corresponding to cells is ﬁxed limiting each cell
to use only a set of frequencies. Even in the presence of other cells with
available unused frequencies the cells that are in need of frequencies (fully
loaded cell) cannot use those unused frequencies belonging to other cells.
On the other hand, in dynamic channel allocation, all the channels belong
to a global pool and the channels are assigned according to a cost function
that considers the CCI and ACI into account. As a result, for non-uniform
traﬃc conditions, the available channels can be used more eﬃciently.
• Adaptive RF Component:
CR can manipulate its RF components
such as antenna hardware to optimize transmission [21]. This in turn can
reduce information loss, optimum power usage, and reduced interference
eﬀects. Some of the antenna manipulation techniques can include multi-
ple antenna usage, and adaptive beam forming. An example of multiple
antenna CR application is MIMO where more than one antenna are used
on transmission and reception to capture path diversity and improve com-
munication.
• Technology Speciﬁc Adaptation:
CR can allow individual technol-
ogy speciﬁc adaptation. CR enables adaptive selection of cyclic preﬁx size,
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) size, and number of carriers in Orthogo-
nal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), and adaptive selection of
duty cycle and number of pulses per bit in impulse radio based UWB
technology [21].
• Other Adaptive Parameters: In Hierarchical Cellular Systems (HCS),
CR can allow adaptive cell assignments. The use of HCS has become a
major component in 3G mobile systems such as UMTS and IMT-2000. In
an HCS, various cell sizes can be deployed with small cell clusters over-
laid by larger cells. Microcells increase capacity within a coverage area,
but radio resource management becomes more diﬃcult. Within micro-
cells, the number of hand-oﬀs per cell increases by an order of magnitude
but the time available to make a hand-oﬀis decreased. The HCS han-
dles the microcell situations by assigning cells to the mobiles depending
on their speed or doppler spread estimates. For example, in a two layer
environment, low speed mobiles can be assigned to microcells, whereas,
high speed mobiles can be assigned to macrocells. This way, the macro-
cell/microcell overlay architecture provides a balance between maximizing
the capacity per unit area and minimizing the number of hand-oﬀs. As a
result, the risk of call dropping is reduced and handover delays is lowered,
switching load is reduced, and QoS is increased. The HCS can extend to
more than two layers. For example, pico-cellular layers can also be in-
cluded in multi-layer HCS. Similarly, communication satellite beams can
be overlaying all the terrestrial layers at the highest hierarchical level.
Recently, the dynamic allocation and multi-tiered design strategies are
further generalized to take power control, cell hand-oﬀ, traﬃc classes (like
multi-media), and user priorities into account. Link adaptation schemes
can also be combined with adaptive resource allocation. For example,

400
H¨useyin Arslan and Sadia Ahmed
adaptive modulation (and coding) can be combined with dynamic channel
allocation. Similarly, adaptive modulation (and coding) can be combined
with handover algorithms to introduce more intelligent handover strate-
gies. All these developments require more sophisticated adaptation of the
network, and they are based on many parameter measurements.
In a multi-hop network, CR can adaptively choose routing path algo-
rithms. Adaptation of clustering parameters for clustering based routing
and network topology, scheduling algorithms, adaptive frequency hopping,
and adaptive generation of spreading code can be implemented to improve
communication quality as well [21]. CR also allows adapting to user pref-
erences, user locations, and user habits [22].
13.2.2 Interoperability
“Interoperability” is a powerful tool in CR domain that enables intelligent
wireless communication across any boundary and over any dimension. This
ubiquitous connectivity can deﬁne the ultimate adaptive system over het-
erogeneous networks, varied spectrums, diverse geographical boundaries, and
over diﬀerent communication policy and regulations.
Achieving the ideal interoperable system may still be a long way from
reality. Some of the cognitive applications that can set the way are CR ability
to operate over legacy systems, intelligent policy management methods, uti-
lizing network knowledge, cross layer optimization, and various multi-antenna
conﬁgurations. Cognitive traits of frequency agility and protocol indepen-
dence can allow CR to build SDR platforms that are potentially capable
of solving radio and system interoperability problems. These platforms can
provide seamless system operation in a highly fragmented and in a multi-
terminal/multi-frequency heterogeneous communication environments.
An immediate implementation of interoperability at present can be the
public safety ﬁrst responders and military applications [13]. The role of in-
teroperable devices, services, networks, and spectrums are extremely critical
for these applications. In other sectors, such as in consumer applications, CRs
can oﬀer interoperability across licensed, unlicensed, and semi-licensed spec-
trum services and over diverse networks. Figure 13.8 represents a coalesce
of interoperable devices, services, and networks for a visual understanding of
interoperable wireless system.
13.2.3 End User Product/Service Speciﬁc Cognitive Wireless
Communication Applications
The lowest tier in the CR application hierarchy comprises of service
speciﬁc/end user products such as the cell phone, laptop, and fax machine
illustrated in Figure 13.1. These services and products utilize the beneﬁts
of cognitive inﬂuence in wireless communication applications. It may be im-
possible to capture all present and future products within this chapter and

therefore, some of the major ones are described here. Figure 13.9 represents
a high level classiﬁcation of the service speciﬁc/end user CR applications and
their usage in everyday lives. Even though these applications are grouped
separately, they may overlap with each other across boundaries.
Private Sector (Personal Level)
• Home and Family Environment:
Technology is an integral part of
modern life. Spending quality time with the family has regained its im-
portance. As a result, the diﬀerentiating border between home and oﬃce
is disappearing. For example, a corporate employee may wish to engage
himself in an oﬃce conference on his laptop before leaving home. The con-
nection can be established over a WLAN transmitting real time multime-
dia information. At the same time, other neighbors can access WLAN for

similar or other reasons. To avoid this rush hour congestion CR can iden-
tify available spectrum holes and utilize it. This available spectrum can
belong to public safety services, such as the ﬁre and police departments.
If the access points are in less populated areas, the unused spectrum can
consist of a TV band. The cognitive ability can provide appropriate band-
width for desired information transmission [20] and choose appropriate
modulation, coding techniques to provide the best wireless communica-
tion using the spectrum hole. Under the same circumstances a traditional
radio may be unable to operate during radio access congestion and the
person may altogether sacriﬁce his morning conference.
• School Environment: When a small child attends school, safety
becomes a major concern. A short range tracking device between home
and school or within school can be placed on the child’s body where the
central control can reside at home or at the teacher’s oﬃce. Cognitive
tracking node can intelligently capture a child’s location information.
Whenever the child is out of the designated premises, the cognitive sensor
can immediately convey the message to the base. Then the parents or
the teacher may intervene. The child tracker can also be equipped with
an emergency channel that can activate according to behavioral changes
such as crying or screaming.
In a home schooling scenario, students can watch the classes live or
recorded from their homes. Cognitive tutoring [23] can enable tutoring
of a student without human intervention.

13 Applications of Cognitive Radio
403
• Oﬃce Environment:
In an oﬃce environment, the CR can prioritize
a radio network connection according to pre-set priority status. For ex-
ample, a conference among the CEOs can receive the highest priority
in network connection and available spectrum occupancy. Then the next
level of priority is set forth and so on. The priorities can be set at times
of network initialization and can be updated on a regular basis within a
central control. Each wireless work station can communicate with the cen-
tral control and download the priority table. The network and spectrum
access can vary in time, location, space or according to the employee rank.
• Awareness in Spatial Dimension: Determining the location or terrain
surrounding a communication link or a mobile path can improve commu-
nication. CR can utilize RF signals, network information, device/system
resources, sensed parameter/values, and GPS information to geolocate a
system or a device. Once the location is determined, the information can
be conveyed to the central control to retrieve location speciﬁc channel
information. CR can then use that information to improve communica-
tion. The details of location based services and application of these in
cognitive radio are discussed in detail in Chapter 10.
• Handoﬀ: Eﬃcient handoﬀmechanism is a must for uninterrupted com-
munication and to avoid scenarios such as a call drop in cellular services.
Handoﬀcan be classiﬁed into predictive and unpredictive handoﬀs. Pre-
dictive handoﬀinvolves determining possible handoﬀscenario in advance
and take appropriate action for eﬃcient handling. A mobile cognitive de-
vice with its GPS capability can select either a preferred cell within an
existing network type, or select an entirely diﬀerent network based upon
available options in the mobile’s current path.
Unpredictive handoﬀcan involve unpredictive behavior in the possible
handoﬀscenario. Cognitive radio can employ intelligent mechanisms to
handle such scenario. One example of unpredictive behavior can be app-
licable to commercial markets where seamless handoﬀperformance is crit-
ical for user satisfaction.
• Roaming Across Borders: CR can allow the user to roam across bor-
ders with variable policy and etiguette rules and can negotiate with several
providers to establish connection which has the lowest available cost.
• QoS and QoS Management:
Quality of service varies from one
application to another. Cognitive functions to satisfy speciﬁc QoS can
include prioritizing connection such as dropping streaming audio if there
is an incoming call; optimizing transmission time such as executing up-
loads/downloads in low priority batches until a low cost and high band-
width connection is available; selection of appropriate channel bandwidth
that matches endpoint codecs and allowing adaptive compression to bal-
ance application and voice bandwidth usage. CR can also intelligently
degrade the supplied services in accordance with link quality changes [8]
and battery power reduction.

404

• Communicating with Existing Non-Cognitive Services:
One of
the wonderful traits of cognitive radio is to operate over any network and
over any available services even if the network and the service are non-
cognitive. At times of need, CR can scan the environment for available
networks and possible services and choose the appropriate network/service
dynamically [24].
• Man–Machine Interface: One of the ﬁrst cognitive concepts proposed
by Dr. Mitola [25] is the autonomous interaction between a communica-
tion device and its user. Any human such as a cell phone user, any animal
such as a bird carrying a sensor, any plant such as a rare tree in the
Amazon jungle or any other wireless node can fall under the deﬁnition of
“user” within a communication link. Some of the major CR applications
that can directly involve the user are stated below.
– User authentication:
Cognitive radio can be aware of each user’s
unique identiﬁcation. In case of man this user authentication can include
voice, thumb print, DNA, and eye retina recognition. In case of animals it
can be DNA or species speciﬁc identiﬁcation such as stripe orientation in
Zebras. In the initialization phase, cognitive learning can allow the speciﬁc
wireless node to learn about its user’s unique ID [25].
– User emotions:
CR can identify its user’s emotions such as anger,
happiness, sadness, and fear based on voice stress level and execute app-
ropriate action. For example, if a man is scared, CR can detect fear and
autonomously dial “911”.
– Noise cancellation: The cognitive transmitter and the receiver both
may tackle channel impairments to produce desired signal quality at the
receiver. Yet, the received speech clarity cannot be guaranteed to the
user’s ears due to surrounding environment noise near the ears. CR can
detect the environment noise around the receiver and apply noise can-
cellation techniques dynamically to adapt, adjust and maintain desired
signal quality.
– User habits:
During initialization phase, cognitive radio can learn
about its user’s periodic habits such as the mostly dialed number on a
cellphone, the mostly visited Internet sites and the mostly traveled geo-
graphical locations. CR can utilize knowledge about its user habits to
make judicious decision in radio communication. Upon sensing any vari-
ations to these habits, CR can learn the new habit and adapt to it.
Figure 13.10 illustrates CR application, where the environment around
user’s daily traveling route is incorporated into communication to provide
the desired signal quality.
It is still a long way from reaching complete user habit adaptation. As a
step toward that, the present man–machine interface can be simpliﬁed to
reduce the expanded number of options that require Input/Output (I/O)
action between a communication device and its user [22]. Some of the
autonomous CR tasks related to user habits can encompass learning and
adapting to a user’s common errors and restructuring the I/O sequence

(A) Utilize user habit: Shortest route of 
user for everyday travel. Passes through
busy intersection and tunnel. CR applies
interferences cancellation techniques at the
intersection and boosts power inside
tunnel during same time every day.
(B) Adapt to habit change: Longer route
that user uses rarely. CR adapts to this
route by reducing power level and shutting
off interference cancellation techniques at
specific times.

to correct those. CR can notify the user of any high priority messages
autonomously and ﬁlter out some of the unnecessary ones after intelli-
gent sorting. The notiﬁcation can take place by audio/vibrate, textual and
visual methods. For example, upon learning the average call time between
the current user and the other end, CR can decide to notify the user of
a forecasted call drop based upon current trajectory and known network
conditions.
– User perception:
CR intelligence can sense the perception level of
a user on the receiving end. CR can intelligently decide on repeating the
transmission if the user is incapable of deducing the received information.
This can autonomously improve communication between two users.
Government Sector (Public: Protection, Safety, Security,
and Disaster Relief)
The application of CR in public safety and disaster situations can bring revo-
lutionary changes [26,27]. Cognitive radio enables creation and maintenance
of communication over diverse networks and spectrums. This in turn, enables
an uninterrupted communication link during public protection and disaster
relief scenarios [28].
In a disaster situation, the private wireless networks such as a cellular
network can be inoperable and the public safety spectrum can be overcrowded
due to numerous emergency connections. Under such situation, cognitive radio

The fruits of cognitive wireless communication can beneﬁt the public
security, safety and disaster scenarios, perhaps the most. Therefore, this type
of CR application deserves special emphasis and is presented in detail within
this section. Table 13.2 presents some common problems that arise during
and/or after a disaster situation and how they eﬀect wireless communication.
The causes of communication failure in a disaster situation can be catego-
rized into two, both of which, can be tackled by cognitive intelligence. These
are presented below.
– Impaired wireless communication infrastructure: Wireless com-
munication infrastructure can be divided into two categories based on their
functionalities: 1) Power system that feeds the communication network and
2) Network elements that haul the communication traﬃc. Generally, disas-
ters create damage to both categories and that damage causes similar conse-
quences. Although the damages to 1) and 2) have similar consequences, it is
appropriate to consider each of them individually for the sake of clarity.
Power failure, which is caused by a damage to the power system, can
be divided coarsely into two sub-categories as (A) major and (B) minor (or
regional) failures. In (A), the communication suddenly drops out encompass-
ing a vast geographical area probably including some major communication
nodes.1 In (B), the failure does not cover as vast a geographical area as (A),
1 On August 14, 2003, the North–East part of the USA experienced one of the
biggest power outages of all times. It is reported that several parts of New York
City went through landline communication loss because of three of the central
oﬃces of one phone company experienced power outages. Cellular phones failed
as well since some of the repeaters were not equipped with power backup. The

13 Applications of Cognitive Radio
407
and therefore, the impact on the communication is limited. As a result of (A)
and (B), when a disaster occurs, power failure causes the devices connecting
the terminals and network to cut oﬀ, and may end up with drastic capacity
drops and serious communication blackouts [30–33].
Similar to the damages to power systems, breaking down of infrastruc-
ture that hauls the communication cause serious problems, such as drastic
capacity drops or total loss of communications [34, 35]. On September 11,
2001, along with the collapse of the towers, the radio repeaters situated on
top of the towers were also destroyed. Besides the repeaters, the debris and
the impact of the collapse further damaged other communication infrastruc-
tures such as ﬁber-optics near the vicinity of the disaster area [36, 37]. Al-
though communications can be established via other routes at times of par-
tial network damage, excessive amount of traﬃc can lead to an overloaded
network. Consequently, the system will respond by dropping the calls and/or
denying the accesses, which in turn, will cause a drastic decrease in the capac-
ity. This domino eﬀect was observed on September 11, 2001, as well. The peo-
ple who wanted to reach their loved ones inside or around the incident, created
network access bursts, which gave rise to an overwhelmed network and
congestion [37].
In connection with the damage to infrastructure, power shortage in batter-
ies constitute another serious problem. The disaster victims carrying wireless
devices run into battery problem due to (i) inaccessible electric outlets, (ii)
a power outage and/or (iii) inability to withstand long hours of search and
rescue operations.
In the event of communication infrastructure failure, the knowledge of call
blocking rate can be exploited by cognitive radios [38, p. 441]. The cognition
capabilities of CR, can overcome the failures caused by damage to infrastruc-
tures, to some extent. For instance, when the infrastructure is demolished,
cognitive radios try to search for other cognitive radios to construct an ad
hoc network in order to reach the devices that are out-of-coverage area. Thus,
when the rescue teams approach the disaster area, the newly created ad hoc
network will enable detection of nodes that were undetected by the rescue
teams [39].
–Unfavorable changes in the propagation channel:
In addition to
infrastructure failure, there is a serious indirect impact of the disasters on wire-
less communications causing wireless environment and conditions to change
drastically. Extraordinary alteration in the environment, such as collapsing
of an oﬃce into a rubble with piled up thick layer of concrete and steel,
and environmental conditions such as rain and dense dust particles in air
(due to collapse), will greatly complicate the radio transmission. This stems
from the fact that radio propagation characteristics in those environments
rest, which had batteries, dried out in four hours. In addition, the phone systems
were overloaded with excessive amount of calls. Furthermore, due to the massive
call volume, 911 system of the city failed, too [29].

408
H¨useyin Arslan and Sadia Ahmed
and conditions are very diﬀerent than those in the regular ones [34,39,40]. As
reported in [34,39–41], due to the presence of pile of steel and concrete in the
debris, locating the people inside the rubble becomes hard.2 Furthermore, ﬁrst
responders reported loss of wireless connections during the rescue operation
in harsh environments in the aftermath of some of the disasters [34, 41, 43].
In such environments and conditions, the unique propagation characteristics
may lead to the failure of communication that would generally work ﬁne under
normal conditions. On September 11, 2001, it was reported that there were
thick clouds of dust particles in the air due to the collapses. Moreover, dur-
ing the recovery stage, it rained occasionally. It is known that precipitation
(such as rain, snow, and fog) increases the signal attenuation and degrades
QoS [44,45].
In disaster areas, it is seen that, detecting the presence of the signals
coming out of or getting into a rubble is extremely diﬃcult. There are several
factors that aﬀect the signal propagation through rubble. The structure of the
collapsed building, ﬂame, smoke, and water coming from sprinklers (due to the
ﬁre) are some of the factors aﬀecting the radio propagation. In an aftermath of
a hurricane and/or ﬂood, the radio propagation channel may vary even more,
imposing a wireless communication through a partial or a full water channel.
Thus, depending on the speciﬁc disaster situation, the wireless propagation
environment will vary widely and can cause adverse aﬀects on communication
resulting in degradation or a total communication failure.
Of course, it is not practical to manufacture a device containing every
possible technology, channel model, and other capabilities inside. It is wiser
to have a generic hardware that can be controlled and directed according to
changing needs. Obviously, CR is the answer. If CR is equipped with the rele-
vant wireless channel models and can classify the corresponding environment
with its sensing ability, then a simple adjustment of SDR parameters will lead
to selection of the appropriate channel model from its repository. As a result,
the wireless connection failures can be minimized [3, 19, 39, 48]. Moreover,
cognitive radio can consider the signal penetration characteristics [38, p. 437].
This is very important, especially in disaster environments [49], where CR can
switch between the bands to make sure that the “help signal” is traversed.
There are numerous crucial scenarios that fall under the public protec-
tion, security, and/or disaster categories. Cognitive radio can bring radical
improvements to the current handling capability of these public safety and
disaster situations. It is impossible to include all of them here and therefore,
a few of the major ones are addressed below:
• Emergency Management or Disaster Recovery: According to Fed-
eral Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a disaster can be deﬁned
as the occurrence of one of the situations in the following list: (a) Chem-
ical Emergencies, (b) Dam Failure, (c) Earthquake, (d) Fire or Wildﬁre,
2 For localization methods of victims through sensor networks, Ref. [42] can be

(e) Flood, (f) Hazardous Material, (g) Heat, (h) Hurricane, (i) Land Slide,
(j) Nuclear Power Plant Emergency, (k) Terrorism, (l) Thunderstorm, (m)
Tornado, (n) Tsunami, (o) Volcano, and (p) Winter Storm. However, dis-
asters are not only limited to these. A plane, train, or a vehicle crash can
also be considered as disasters from the context perspective. Regardless
of their impact, in these situations, the communications is of vital impor-
tance to carry out emergency responses and disaster relief operations.
In the recent years, it is proved from experience that the communication
systems, more often than not, fail to meet people’s needs when they are
needed the most. The reasons can be due to partial or full breakdown of
communication infrastructures, extreme environmental condition changes,
and due to other factors such as existence of overwhelming interference
and inability of communication among heterogeneous components. Cogni-
tive radio can resolve these problems in disaster situations. For instance,
various nodes can work as a relay to establish communication when there
is a power outage or a loss of central control. Under normal circumstances,
this type of ad hoc relay (such as a mesh connectivity) may not exist. CR
can adapt its operating parameters to provide an ad hoc connection at
times of need.
• Fire Services:
Fire service personnel play a vital role in many disas-
ter scenarios. Structure ﬁre ﬁghting, wild land ﬁre ﬁghting, search and
rescue, lifesaving, damage control, salvage operations, decontamination
operations, and safety management through a restricted area (due to ﬁre
related disaster) can be a few of them. Communication requirements will
vary depending on the environment and the speciﬁc scenario. In general,
ﬁre ﬁghters work under severe conditions of extremely high temperature
and high humidity. Wireless equipments are required to function under
such adverse conditions that force communication over atypical channel
characteristics.
For instance, in case of wild land ﬁres, wireless equipments need to cover
a wide range of landscapes and autonomously reconﬁgure with respect to
the available communication link. Fire ﬁghtings are long run operations
that enforce eﬃcient energy/battery usage. Wild land ﬁres can spread very
rapidly and change direction with the changing physical conditions (such
as winds). The agile characteristic requires immediate action and perfect
coordination among the ﬁre ﬁghting team members. Video/audio confer-
encing and fast data transfer along with video streaming capabilities of
wireless systems can help monitor the on-site operations from the control
center, instruct, and limit the damage. The environmental and person-
nel data, such as the temperature, wind speed and direction, hazardous
chemical levels at the direction of ﬁre ﬁghters, and number of ﬁre ﬁght-
ers are important for wild land ﬁres. Similarly, structure and equipment
data, such as 3D models of the building, ﬁre hydrant locations, occupant
information, engine temperatures, and water pressures are important for
structure ﬁre ﬁghting. These information need to be transferred to the

410
H¨useyin Arslan and Sadia Ahmed
ﬁre ﬁghters and the rescue crew in a reliable and eﬃcient way through
the adverse wireless channel (due to wind, heat and humidity). Cogni-
tive radio can be of great assistance to eliminate most or all of the above
problems in ﬁre ﬁghting.
• Search and Rescue: In a typical search and rescue scenario the person
in distress can inform about his location by creating visual signs such as
a smoke or a ﬁre from a ﬂare gun. Since the wireless coverage is scarce
in remote areas, it may be impossible for the distressed person to inform
the rescuer using a wireless device. As the search party nears the rescue
area, the cognitive radios of the distressed and the rescuer can establish
communication without any central control. The GPS capability of CR
can come in handy to appropriately detect the position of the rescued
person. At the same time, if a special channel over available spectrum
hole is used for short range signaling, this channel can work like a beacon
for the distressed person. The rescue team can home onto this beacon and
ﬁnd the lost individual.
• Mining: CR can help minimize mine accidents in the future by maintain-
ing continued wireless communication between the people inside and the
people outside of the mine. In such situation, CR can choose appropriate
waveform and apply other techniques to establish a clear signal between
the adverse environment within the mine and the outside world.
• Crime Prevention:
The crime prevention sectors of the government,
such as the police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), can
greatly beneﬁt from utilizing CR. The operation of these departments de-
mand portable coverage throughout the community with transparent and
high-speed access to a myriad of public safety ﬁles for criminal identiﬁca-
tion and investigation. This information may include ﬁles on stolen articles
(such as ﬁrearms, automobiles, trucks, tracks and industrial machinery),
suspect ﬁngerprints, photos, mug shots, iris scans, property descriptions,
and criminal history ﬁles. Besides the information itself, it is also crucial to
transfer the data securely so that unauthorized users do not get or corrupt
the transferred information. Current wireless communication applications
are incapable of providing such sophisticated services and cognitive radio
is the answer.
Government Sector (Public: Others)
• Traﬃc Control: Traﬃc is a big problem especially during rush hours in
the mornings and in the evenings. Under such situations, the local traﬃc
control can transmit the congested traﬃc location, the predicted traﬃc
delay and an alternate route to the mobile user. Cognitive intelligence can
be applied on traﬃc signals themselves as well to determine how long the
red or green signal may remain on depending on the traﬃc volume in each
direction. This traﬃc information can be gathered at each signal location
by cognitive sensors. The appropriate decision can be taken locally or via

13 Applications of Cognitive Radio
411
a central control. Balloon born repeaters can be utilized to convey traﬃc
information or images to the central control for broadcast as well.
• Medical Applications:
The application of cognitive radio can bring
improvements in areas of medical and bio-medical engineering. In a hos-
pital environment, a new born baby needs to be identiﬁed with its mother.
If the hospital personnel conducts incorrect visual or manual identiﬁcation
of any infant, there is always a chance of the wrong baby associating with
the wrong mother. In order to avoid this unfortunate situation, a wireless
tag can be provided on the infant’s body that responds to the base tag
around the mother’s wrist. In an extreme case of a wireless tag mix up,
ﬁnger prints or even retina imprints can be utilized to relate each baby
with its mother. Cognitive radio tag can inform the mother intelligently
if the baby is carried outside of a designated premises such as outside of
the hospital baby ward.
In case of adult patients, each may be provided with a personal cognitive
ID tag. A central control within the same hospital unit can utilize, store,
and update each patient information and keep track of their changes. The
cognitive tag can record the vital signs of the patient and intelligently
inform the respective authority if an abnormality is detected. Long range
tags on the patient’s body can monitor his readings and forward the in-
formation to the doctor while the patient is away from the hospital.
There are several other special medical applications of CR that need
attention. A few of these are addressed here.
– Emergency medical services:
Emergency medical services are pro-
vided to the public, primarily in two phases, ﬁrst, by the mobile medical
personnel and equipment (such as an ambulance or other motorized vehi-
cles) at the ﬁeld and then, within a controlled environment with enhanced
medical assistance at the medical institutions (such as metropolitan hos-
pitals). Modern advances in the medical ﬁelds provide emergency services
the ability to serve advanced level of medical assistance. The mobile
medical personnel wireless systems can help transfer information of the
patient to the controlled environment. This information transmission
requires suﬃcient bandwidth and may include video and sound that are
gathered by the medical equipments on the mobile unit. It is of vital
importance to transmit the information in a fast and reliable way so that
speciﬁc medical preparations can be made at the controlled environment
before the patient reaches there. Secondly, if an urgent intervention of any
medical procedure is required, personnel at the mobile unit may conduct
it with the help of specialists located at the controlled environment. It is
also important that the operation of sensitive medical equipments is not
aﬀected or corrupted during the information transfer of wireless devices.
Cognitive radio can eﬃciently assist the emergency medical services, ease
the tasks of medical personnel and save human lives.

diﬀerent functions of the body and convey the monitored information
when needed. Cognitive radio can enable intelligent detection of abnor-
mal tissues or blood cells within a human body and notify the doctor.
This can play crucial role in saving human lives.
– Assisting blind people: Cognitive radio can play an important role in
becoming the eyes of a blind person. Dogs and white sticks are commonly
utilized to assist a blind man. Cognitive radio can replace these guides
with intelligence that can carry out tasks such as ﬁnding safe areas for
travel, safe time to cross the road and sketch the path from home to shop,
work, and other places. Depending on the daily activities of the blind
person, CR can adapt itself and provide a true guide. These generic habits
and daily activities can be applicable to other blind people as well [50]
and CR can customize to the needs of each individual blind user.
• Environmental Applications:
– Weather forecast:
Sensors and sensor networks have been employed
in detecting weather parameters such as temperature, wind speed, air
pressure, and humidity for over a long time. If these sensors are equipped
with cognitive ability, they can communicate with each other without any
user intervention. This way the sensors out in the ﬁeld can detect, col-
lect and share information among themselves for optimum performance.
When the required amount of data is collected, the data can be passed to
the central control by the sensor closest to the station for optimum power
usage, optimum network usage, and minimized delay.
– Research on the behaviors of endangered species:
The ever in-
creasing human population and their need for new developments are caus-
ing rapid destruction of wild animal habitats. As a result many animal
species are listed under “endangered”. Environmental scientists are there-
fore, conducting research projects to understand the behavior and life
cycle of such animals. Wireless technology, especially, cognitive sensors
can play an extensive role in tracking the life of such species. For exam-
ple, conducting research on animal behavior within adverse terrains such
as the rain forest, may be cumbersome and seldom impossible. Cognitive
radio can be utilized to track an animal from its birth to all the way
through its migration and mating to death to collect information intelli-
gently and convey to the scientists.
– Air pollution control: Detecting impurities in air is a major priority
to protect human health. Cognitive radio can intelligently assess impu-
rities in air, retrieve various pollution related data and notify authority
when the limit crosses a pre-deﬁned safety threshold. CR may intelligently
adjust the threshold as well depending on various other factors without
user intervention.
– Global warming:
Global Warming is once again an intensely dis-
cussed topic in the modern world. With environment pollution in the rise
from industry, transportation and other pollutions, our planet is in the
verge of major natural and geographical changes. Environmental scientists

principal concern is the melting of polar ice caps resulting in ocean level
rise. This can in turn diminish the entire existence of various wildlife. To
evaluate this catastrophic situation and to estimate prevention measures,
tracking of such weather pattern and geological changes is necessary. This
can be carried out using sophisticated and self steered devices like cogni-
tive radio.
Government Sector (Military)
Among all the applications of CR, military is perhaps, one of the most signiﬁ-
cant areas, where diﬀerent cognitive radio aspects have been deployed for over
some time now. The SDR, SPEAKeasy, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS),
and jamming and anti-jamming are some of the most important technologies
in the military ﬁelds, that utilize the CR concepts.
In the simplest form, SDR can be deﬁned as the radio that is controlled
and/or implemented by software. The beneﬁts of SDR have been recognized
by the military to resolve their communication deﬁciencies (for example, deﬁ-
ciencies arising from inoperability among legacy systems) during wartime ac-
tivities. Some of these deﬃciencies were addressed in the SPEAKeasy project,
which is an advanced implementation of the SDR. The eﬀorts in SPEAKeasy
led to the development of JTRS project. Present situation in military im-
poses many diﬀerent radio systems to be manually carried, maintained, and
operated. JTRS can reduce the total communication equipments weight and
footprint by eliminating multiple systems. Some of the signiﬁcant features of
JTRS include reduced maintenance costs and complexity due to the elimi-
nation of excessive equipments, making military communications to be less
vulnerable to enemy intercept and jamming owing to improved spectrum us-
age over a wide range of frequencies, and ease of implementation due to its
compatibility with current legacy systems. The SDR, SPEAKeasy, and JTRS
concepts and technologies are presented in detail in Chapter 4, and are there-
fore, not elaborated further here. The following discussion will address the
jamming and anti-jamming applications of cognitive radio.
Wireless communication has been the critical factor in military combat
scenarios. The ability to communicate and destroy the communication of the
enemy is very important for modern armies. There has been a strong need to
deploy jammers properly in the battle ﬁelds so that the communication of the
enemy is disrupted. Deploying an eﬀective jammer needs the awareness of the
enemy waveform so that the jamming signal will be properly positioned to de-
stroy the communication of the enemy while having energy eﬃcient jammers.
On the other hand, there is also strong need to protect our own communi-
cation against the enemy jammers. This requires identiﬁcation and position
of jamming signal and shaping our own communication signal so that the
jamming signal’s eﬀect will be minimal. For example, employing narrowband
interference (or jamming interference) cancellation, deploying adaptive fre-
quency hoping, etc. require various information (as well as statistics) about

414
H¨useyin Arslan and Sadia Ahmed
the interfering/jamming signal. The present tools and techniques for jammer
placement and for protection of our own signal against the enemy jammers,
are substantially limited. Both of these functions require radio awareness in
the battle ﬁeld and capability to identify the waveforms (signal and/or jam-
mer) of the enemy transmission. Blind signal identiﬁcation and extraction of
the parameters of any arbitrary radio signal captured over the air is extremely
important for the success of both goals.
Cognitive radio can coordinate a series of devices to stimulate a physical
action to remove jamming and adjust communication waveforms to avoid jams
that are intentionally applied in the military markets. The CR can identify
the signal type (for example, multi-carrier or single carrier signal, frequency
hoping or not, Code Division Multiple Access type or not, wideband or narrow-
band, etc.), signal modulation (such as Quadrature Amplitude Modulation,
OFDM, Adaptive versus ﬁxed modulation, etc.), occupied bandwidth, carrier
frequency, number of signals over the selected band, signal statistics (such as
temporal, spatial, and frequency), and estimate the geolocation of the radio
source (enemy jammers or signals) from the captured enemy signal.
13.3 Cognitive Application Challenges
Cognitive dominance in the wireless world is boundless. At the same time,
CR associated challenges impose high level of complexity and concern. For
example, usage of unused spectrum (public or private) requires identifying the
spectrum hole. Primary user absence may be misguiding if SNR is the only
determining factor for spectrum availability [9]. Any large or small scale fading
can cause a dip in the signal strength that may lead to a wrong conclusion.
Primary detection may be more reliable through collaboration. On the other
end, secondary user needs to vacate spectrum as soon as the primary user
returns. Identifying the exact time of transition and handling back of spectrum
can also be challenging.
Spectrum management tasks such as evaluation of new spectrum suitabil-
ity for present transmission needs and selection of appropriate band from
multiple available ones can be complex. Secondary user may access spectrum
in individual chunks at diﬀerent time/locations and transmit signal over those
separate chunks.
In the presence of multiple concurrent users over the same band (such as
multiple users on ISM band), power level of each requires control to mitigate
undesired interference. The encryption and encoding techniques must also
ensure privacy and protection against each other in such cases [17].
Pricing for the secondary spectrum usage is a topic of big discussion as
well [51, 52]. The licensed spectrum services are provided to the consumers
through a pre-established pricing mechanism. In order to avoid unnecessary
exploitation of secondary spectrum and to eliminate unfairness to the licensed
owner, some means of pricing mechanism needs to exist for secondary usage.

On the network side, there are many issues to consider as well. Identiﬁca-
tion and maintenance of optimum route; eﬃcient network queue management;
establishing appropriate control channel among heterogeneous network com-
ponents and cross layer optimization can all pose great degree of challenges in
CR deployment. Mobility of secondary spectrum users can create additional
challenges for dynamic network conﬁguration [13].
The hardware complexity rises with the increase in cognitive intelligence
implementation. Therefore, present and future hardware capability and com-
plexity can pose a great level of diﬃculty to the realization of CR appli-
cations. SDR is perhaps the ﬁrst step toward resolving these issues. With
the implementation of ubiquitous connectivity across geographical locations,
CR devices may need to comply dynamically with policy and etiquette varia-
tions across geographical boundaries. Figure 13.11 represents a group of major
present and future envisioned CR applications, their related CR tasks and as-
sociated challenges for a brief illustration.
As cognitive radio takes over, our lives may be blessed with extraordi-
nary comfort, convenience, and ease in wireless communication. Perhaps, it
is important to note that usage of such large number and variety of radio
devices may cause short and long term harmful eﬀects on health. More
medical research may need to be carried out in the present and future to
determine these health related issues.
13.4 Conclusion
The “cognitive” concept is still in its infancy. Therefore, cognitive wireless
communication applications are still far from reaching its potential impact
through wide implementation. This chapter provided an overview of potential
present and future cognitive radio applications and their multidimensional
usage to facilitate wireless communication. Each application may further be
investigated and concentrated research in each area may be conducted in near
and distant future. This may in turn open up other applications or possibilities
to beneﬁt our human lives.

14.1 Introduction
When we look at the evolution of wireless communication systems, as in most
systems, two major developments are most prominent: 1) addition of new
features and 2) improvement of already existing capabilities. The ﬁrst devel-
opment arises from the fact that communication through a wireless medium
makes life easier. Every development brings several new features and these
new features contribute positively to this fact. These developments can be
seen clearly in the evolution of cell phones. In the past, cell phones were used
only for transmitting voice and short text-based messages. Currently, there
are cell phones in which an operating system runs and several multimedia
applications are available.
The second type of development solely originates from the fact that every
physical concept is ﬁnite. Therefore, according to the principal of parsimony,1
the newer systems restrain themselves from wasting resources. Using resources
adequately under dynamically changing conditions introduces the notion of
adaptation and optimization.
Although systems evolve in terms of 1) and 2), particularly in communi-
cation systems, it can be observed that the fundamental design architecture,
which is known as “layered architecture,” still remains the same. Despite the
ineﬃciency of contemporary communication systems, they still accomplish
their tasks. Nevertheless, it can be seen that the aforementioned evolution-
ary developments are approaching a saturation point for contemporary com-
munication systems. The fundamental design architecture inherently hinders

which is also known as “Occam’s Razor” and believed that phrased by William
of Ockham, which means “Entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily” [2].
A direct consequence of this statement is that for two systems which accomplish
the same task, the one that accomplishes the objective in lesser amount of eﬀort,
element, unit, etc., is preferable to the other.

applicability of some of the new developments in the world of communica-
tions. This fact was seen by researchers, but they have only patched the ﬂaws
rather than applying radical changes. However, with the emergence of cog-
nitive radio, which was coined by Joseph Mitola III [3], the perception of
adaptation and optimization of wireless communication systems gained new
dimensions and perspectives. The emergence of cognitive radio (and cognitive
engine) is a promising solution for the barrier which arises from the ﬂaws of
the fundamental design architecture.
In this chapter, we search for an answer to the question how can a global
(or multilayer) adaptation and optimization be established for cognitive radio?
In order to be able to provide a concrete answer, ﬁrst we will brieﬂy review
the fundamental design architecture while providing the reasons and relevant
eﬀorts of migration from the traditional architecture to cross-layer design.
Next, we will outline cross-layer architecture and the place of adaptation along
with optimization for the past and contemporary wireless communication sys-
tems. Subsequently, we will provide the essentials for an overall adaptation
and optimization process in terms of cross-layer architecture. Later, we will
introduce three cross-layer application examples depending on the relation-
ships between layers as adjacent layer interaction, nonadjacent layer interac-
tion, and composite interaction. Then, we will investigate the optimization
problems from a formal perspective to be able to gain some insight into cross-
layer optimization for cognitive radio. We will also address multi-objective
optimization problems (MOPs) and relevant solutions which are going to run
on cognitive engine. In addition, we will summarize the challenges related to
cross-layer adaptation and optimization for cognitive radio. As a ﬁnal remark,
we will extend individual cross-layer adaptation and optimization problems
to a network in which there are multiple individuals.
14.2 Why We Need Cross-Layer Design, Adaptation,
and Optimization
14.2.1 Traditional Layered Design and Its Evolution
Traditional protocol stack has been designed for dealing with complicated
problems by breaking them into smaller parts. It consists of layers whose
deﬁnitions and tasks are deﬁned explicitly and independently. In other words,
each layer is isolated from the others except for providing output to and get-
ting input from adjacent layers [4]. According to the direction of the ﬂow
upward/downward, each layer conducts its own task by taking inputs from
the layer below/above and conveys the outputs obtained to above/below. This
architecture has several advantages. First, deﬁning the tasks explicitly pro-
vides modularity, which means simplicity in the design. Second, explicit def-
initions facilitate the standardization process. Therefore, several vendors can
produce various types of products by following the explicit abstractions, and

Fig. 14.1. The only consideration in designing a new layer for traditional architec-
ture is that the new layer design should meet the requirements of the adjacent layers.
The requirements of layer N +1 are denoted as a round and a triangle, whereas that
of layer N −1 is represented with a half–hexagon.
at the same layer level, any of them can communicate with the others with-
out having any problem. Finally, modularity that comes with independence
allows any type of alteration at any layer level as long as the input/output
requirements of the adjacent layers are met, which gives rise to the concept
of expandability of the layers as illustrated in Figure 14.1.
Even though layered structure overcomes many problems successfully, it
has been realized that the stringent architecture creates some problems such
as asynchrony and ineﬃciencies. A brief list of the major advantages and dis-
advantages of the traditional layered architecture and their eﬀects is given in
Table 14.1. At the beginning, the disadvantages have been tried to alleviate
by increasing the amount of information ﬂow among the layers [5]. After-
wards, with the emergence of new high-speed communication networks, the
major handicap of the traditional design, which is the obligation of an algo-
rithmic ordering, has been emphasized more. As in algorithms, in the tradi-
tional architecture, a process which resides in the next adjacent layer cannot
be executed unless a process deﬁned in a layer is completed. In early ’90s,
the obligated ordering concept, which causes long communication delays and
low throughput for wired networks, has been tried to overcome by inter-layer
optimization [6]. Inter-layer optimization re-organizes the processes for layers
in such a way that some of the processes that do not interfere with each other
can be integrated and executed in parallel rather than serial.2 This approach
is extended to a new protocol scheme called Horizontally Oriented Protocol
2 At this point, it must be stated that even though some of the processes are
integrated, inter-layer optimization still preserves the strictly isolated structure
of layers [6].

Structure (HOPS). In HOPS, the building stone of the architecture is deﬁned
as “function,” instead of “layer.” Thus, the functions that do not need to
wait for others’ outcome can be binded and executed in parallel, which is the
reason why the scheme is called as “horizontally oriented” [7].
Migration from strict layered architecture to a more ﬂexible interactive
one has another very strong motivation: wireless networks. Because of the
diﬀerent nature of wireless communications, numerous concepts deﬁned in
wired networks need careful re-consideration or even modiﬁcation, so does the
protocol stack. Peculiar to wireless communications, due to small-scale fading,
wireless channel conditions may change drastically in a very short duration
of time [8]. Therefore, in order to take advantage of the durations in which
the channel is identiﬁed as “good,” a ﬂexible design is essential [9]. Large-
scale channel variations contribute to the necessity of ﬂexible architecture as
well [10]. Interference and time-varying capacity property due to multipath,
relative mobility, and shadowing are other very crucial parameters that aﬀect
the wireless networks [8,11]. Apart from those, new transmission schemes for

14 Cross–Layer Adaptation and Optimization for CR

wireless communications such as relay networks [12] may not be established
via a strictly isolated layered architecture [9] and might require a diﬀerent
design.
Especially in wireless networks, cross-layer approaches emerged by increas-
ing the amount of information provided to the adjacent layers. As an immedi-
ate example, packet losses in wireless networks can be considered. In wireless
networks, packet losses can occur because of bad wireless channel conditions,
congestion, or some other reasons. However, operating in transport layer, the
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) cannot comprehend the reason behind
these losses. Therefore, it assumes that packet losses solely depend on conges-
tion [13]. Thus, any loss detected is going to be handled3 in terms of congestion
even though the actual reason might be diﬀerent. In order to compensate for
this ﬂaw, the link reliability is also tried to be improved as much as possible.
Hence, in case of a loss, wireless link is eliminated from other possible causes,
so TCP can handle the issue by considering other factors [13]. In fact, this
approach solely is not enough to optimize the problem because of the drop of
throughput. However, if the information about the reason of the loss can be
obtained from the layers, the system can only focus on alleviating the actual
reason without considering the other possibilities [10], which improves the
performance.
14.3 Cross-Layer Design, Adaptation, and Optimization
Up to this point, we have observed that under some circumstances, strictly
layered architecture performs ineﬃciently. As discussed in Section 14.2.1, in
order to overcome this major problem, increasing the amount of information
ﬂow between layers and re-organizing the processes according to their depen-
dency on each other have been proposed. All these eﬀorts lead to a novel con-
cept called “cross-layer architecture.” Hence, cross-layer design can be deﬁned
generally as follows: “Any kind of innovation on the traditional structure that
blurs, changes, or even removes the boundaries between layers.”
In the literature, there are numerous types of cross-layer designs in the
frame of the deﬁnition stated above. Some of the designs only allow the infor-
mation to ﬂow upward and/or downward direction [15], whereas some of them
are based on coupling of some of the layers [16] or merging some adjacent lay-
ers [10]. Even though these innovations are considered as solutions for some
3 TCP uses slow start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit, and fast recovery
algorithms together to avoid and handle the congestion. The transmission is ini-
tiated with “slow start,” which is based on a gradual increase of sending rate of
the segments. This gradual increase is kept until a congestion is detected. In case
of a congestion, TCP employs a special algorithm which slows down the sending
rate of segments. When the congestion is cleared, TCP employs the slow start
again and tries to attain maximum throughput based on the gradual increase by
avoiding congestion [14].

H¨useyin Arslan and Serhan Yarkan
problems, they come at the expense of diﬀerent problems such as more com-
plicated designs compared to the traditional one. Besides, blurring or remov-
ing completely the boundaries between layers in the traditional architecture
causes the tasks deﬁned explicitly for each layer to spread into other layers
and become others’ problems as well. In other words, violating the indepen-
dence of layers introduces additional dimensions to the tasks of other layers.
Consequently, optimization of the tasks is converted from a narrow (single
layer) domain to a broader (multi-layer) domain.
Having a cross-layer architecture with optimization is not going to be
suﬃcient for ultimate system design goal. The missing link in the chain is
adaptation [8, 17, 18]. In Section 14.2.1, it is outlined that the status infor-
mation of a wireless communication system needs to travel among the layers
because of changing wireless channel conditions, network load, and Quality of
Service (QoS). Allowing the status information to travel among the layers is a
starting point to complete the chain [17,18]. Therefore, in the subsequent sec-
tions, the infrastructure for merging the concepts of cross-layer, adaptation,
and cognitive radio will be discussed.
14.3.1 Cognitive Radio, Cross-Layer Design, and Adaptation
Cognitive radio is a radio that can sense, be aware of, learn, and adapt to
the surrounding environment according to its inner and outer stimuli. These
properties of cognitive radio take their places in the cognition cycle [19]. Over-
all cognition cycle can be seen as an instance of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI),
since it encompasses observing, learning, reasoning, and adaptation.
Adaptation itself is a complex problem in the cognition cycle, because
cognitive radio needs to take into account several input sources at the same
time including its own past observations as a result of learning property.
For instance, during its adaptation, cognitive radio needs to consider sev-
eral requirements simultaneously such as user and application preferences, its
own capabilities such as battery status, environmental conditions such as the
availability of spectrum and propagation characteristics, and so forth. A com-
promise point, which can be regarded also as optimization, is tried to attain
between these requirements. Note that some of the requirements fall into the
tasks of speciﬁc layers in the traditional design. More explicitly, cognitive radio
needs to consider QoS requirements, physical medium options as in traditional
architectures beside some additional constraints such as battery consumption
and past experiences. Therefore, one can conclude that, cognitive radio needs
an overall adaptation that covers multiple layers with the aid of optimization.
Currently, there is no architecture that can meet all the aforementioned
requirements of cognitive radio simultaneously. A fundamental reason behind
that is the absence of any sort of controller and coordinator governing the
overall adaptation process. The obligation of the presence of a controller and
coordinator for complete adaptivity can be explained by an analogy. Since cog-
nitive radio has AI capabilities, it is adequate to consider the most intelligent

14 Cross–Layer Adaptation and Optimization for CR

systems on the Earth: humans. Humans have aural, olfactory, tactile, taste,
and visual sensors. These sensors help humans to perceive the surrounding
environment. Humans are aware of themselves with the aid of inner sensors
called as nerves. Humans are also equipped with very complex structures
called “organs” to carry out vital operations. Each organ in the human body
is physically isolated from the others such as the heart, the kidneys, and the
liver. Interestingly, as in the layered architecture, some of the organs operate
in algorithmic order such as digestive system. In the human digestive system,
the intestines should wait for the stomach to operate. At the end, there is
another structure that controls and coordinates every single organ in the hu-
man body: the brain. The brain is aware of both inner and outer world of the
body via the nervous system and sensors. It gathers all the information from
inner and outer world, processes and compares it with its past knowledge,
chooses the best (or, in engineering terminology, optimum) decision, acts on,
and observes the consequences for future usage. This procedure that the brain
follows highly resembles the cognition cycle.
The human body analogy stresses that, a special structure, which has the
capability of both controlling and coordinating, is essential in order to obtain
a complete adaptive architecture. In cognitive radio domain, the counterpart
of this special structure is known as “cognitive engine.” Even though cur-
rently there is no formal deﬁnition of cognitive engine, it is agreed that cogni-
tive engine is responsible for the overall adaptation and optimization process.
However, a question arises automatically by introducing cognitive engine to
the cross-layer design: What kind of an architecture should be adopted to
include both cross-layer design and cognitive radio? Now, we seek for appro-
priate approaches, if possible, an answer to this question.
14.3.2 Cognitive Engine and Cross-Layer Architecture Design
As stated in Section 14.3.1, when a completely adaptive system is considered,
the control and coordination of already deﬁned layers have to be organized.
The initial step is to establish the ﬂow of information between each layer
regardless of the levels of layers. In the earliest attempts toward cross-layer
design, several layers were connected to each other in bi-directional way [17].
With the help of combinatorics, for an n-layered architecture (n ≥2, n ∈Z),
the number of single-direction ﬂow must be deﬁned is given by
$n
r
%
and r = 2.4
Considering that the ﬂow has two directions (upward and downward) as in [17]
and there are already information paths between adjacent layers, the total
number of new information paths to be deﬁned becomes:
R = (n −1)(n −2).
(14.1)
As can be seen in (14.1), a linear increase in the number of layers causes
a quadratic increase in the number of new paths to be deﬁned, which should
4 This representation is known as binomial coeﬃcient and given by (n!)/((n−r)! r!).

428
H¨useyin Arslan and Serhan Yarkan
be avoided. Besides, solely R paths are not going to be enough to attain a
complete adaptation since pre-deﬁned layers are not capable of converging
to a complete adaptation. In addition, cognitive radio not only consists of
pre-deﬁned layers, but also includes several other sensors that need to be
in connection with the adaptation process. This emphasizes that cognitive
engine needs to form a sort of interface between the layers and sensors. In
Section 14.3.1, when the cognition cycle was introduced, one of the abilities
of the cognitive radio, learning from its past experiences, has been brought
forward. Learning from past observations includes memory related processes.
Therefore, apart from layers and sensors, cognitive engine needs to interact
with diﬀerent parts of the hardware. Finally, considering the evolution of
cognitive radio, cognitive engine can be updated and modiﬁed.
By considering the aforementioned aspects, it is reasonable to think cog-
nitive engine as a new layer that has connections with each layer, sensors,
and hardware. This assumption, as a side-eﬀect, also removes the quadratic
behavior deﬁned in (14.1) and allows one to facilitate the already deﬁned
layered architecture to some extent by converting (14.1) into a linear form.
One of the important characteristics of this new architecture is that it
should preserve the previous achievements related to cross-layer organization
and architecture. More explicitly, cognitive engine must take advantage of the
present architecture rather than changing it entirely. The major impact of the
cognitive engine on the cross-layer design is to remove the distance between
layers on the edges. Consequently, a cognitive engine that is considered as a
separate layer can be placed between layered architecture and several other
peripherals such as memory and sensors. This is illustrated in Figure 14.2.
In a contextual model as shown in Figure 14.2, the operation of cogni-
tive engine is extremely important. In this architecture, cognitive engine is
“attached” to an already existing structure. Thus, the presence of cognitive
engine should not create any problem to the layered architecture, since cur-
rent layered architecture can already handle various issues very eﬃciently.
What cognitive engine introduces is to spread the adaptation among all the
layers, which cannot be achieved through traditional layered architecture. On
the other hand, cognitive engine forms an interface for the available infor-
mation coming from peripherals (such as memory and additional sensors) to
improve the performance and adaptivity. Hence, it can be said that cognitive
engine intervenes only when it is needed.5 According to the situation, cogni-
tive engine can take over the optimization process because of the necessity
5 Actually, this behavior of the cognitive engine has also several counterparts in
the human body analogy, which is discussed earlier. One of them is known as
“involuntary (stereotyped) reﬂex actions.” A person who touches a hot stove
immediately pulls his/her hand back without “thinking.” This response to the
stimuli is handled by a mechanism called “reﬂex arc.” Even though the brain is
not involved with the ﬁrst stage of the action (pulling the hand immediately),
later on, the information “pain” is sent to the brain and the brain relates the
actions and learns.

of the contribution of other layers. Similarly, cognitive engine takes action to
by-pass some of the layers for the sake of optimization and/or speed or battery
requirements.
Some illustrative examples – which do not contain any structure such as
cognitive engine – for cross-layer adaptation and optimization can be pre-
sented for the sake of further comprehension before going deep into cognitive
engine.
Illustrative Examples of Cross-Layer Adaptation and Optimization
Wireless channel possesses various characteristics. Multipath phenomenon
introduces spreading in time, whereas due to the Doppler eﬀect, the sig-
nal spreads in frequency domain. In addition to multipath propagation
and Doppler spread, the transmission bandwidth is of great importance in

understanding the characteristics of the wireless channel [8].6 These concepts
are the most prominent factors aﬀecting the small-scale fading in wireless
channels, which can cause erroneous data reception.
In order to be able to achieve a reliable communication over fading chan-
nels, channel coding is used to detect and correct possible errors. The essence
of channel coding is to introduce redundancy into the data to be sent in order
to restore it at the receiver side. There are several channel coding schemes
such as block codes, convolutional codes, and turbo codes. One of the most
important parameters in the channel coding is the coding rate. Coding rate
is deﬁned as Rc = k/n, where k denotes the number of bits before chan-
nel coding and n represents the number of bits after encoding operation.
Thus, n−k is the total redundancy which is a measure of spectral ineﬃciency
due to coding process [8]. Consequently, Rc = 1 means no redundancy at
all, in other words 100% eﬃciency. It is important to remember that even
though Rc = 1 promises 100% spectral eﬃciency, in case of an error, the data
may not be recovered appropriately, which requires re-transmission meaning
low data rate. We can exemplify channel coding with contemporary commu-
nication technologies such as Global Service for Mobile (GSM) and Global
Packet Radio Service (GPRS). GSM uses 0.5 code rate for speech data [20],
whereas GPRS uses four diﬀerent code rates between 0.5–1 [21], according to
the pre-deﬁned channel quality schemes. Measuring the link quality consecu-
tively allows GPRS to switch between diﬀerent code rates to establish high
throughput [21].
It is also possible to get higher data rates by preserving the spectral eﬃ-
ciency. This is achieved by switching to higher order modulations in case of
having a good link [8]. In Enhanced GPRS (EGPRS), two diﬀerent modula-
tions are available with diﬀerent coding rates [8,21]. After link measurements,
the communication system adjusts itself with the aid of Adaptive Modula-
tion and Coding (AMC). If the link quality is good, then EGPRS can switch
from lower order modulation (Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying [GMSK]) to
a higher order modulation (8–Phase Shift Keying [PSK]) with reducing the
channel coding power ((Rc →1) ≡(n →k)) [22].
EGPRS also provides a diﬀerent cross-layer application which includes
again the collaboration of data link and physical layer. Instead of AMC, this
time, a technique, which is known as “incremental redundancy” (a method in
Type–II Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)7), is used [21]. In incre-
mental redundancy, ﬁrst, the data is sent through the channel with a weak
coding power (Rc). If no error occurs, a high bit rate is achieved. Unless there
is an erroneous reception, which is going to be notiﬁed by an ARQ scheme
6 Note that if the transmission bandwidth is less than the coherence bandwidth of
the channel, the eﬀects of signal spreading can be neglected.
7 It is named as Type-II, because it stores the erroneous packet whereas Type-
I discards it. The other method of Type-II Hybrid ARQ is known as “chase
combining.”

to the transmitter side, the coding power is never increased. In case of an
erroneous packet reception, the coding power is increased step by step until
the reception becomes error-free [23].8
Up to this point, some applications that facilitate the collaboration of the
layers close to each other have been outlined. There are also other applications
that can use cross-layer approach for the layers residing at the edge of the
traditional architecture such as the collaboration of application and physical
layer. A very well-known example of these sorts of applications is known as
Joint Source–Channel Coding (JSCC).
In multimedia applications the notion of perceptual quality is of vital im-
portance. Therefore, the main purpose of the multimedia transmission can be
deﬁned as to obtain the best perceptual quality. However, when the transmis-
sion is carried out over wireless channels, numerous constraints (such as fading,
shadowing, interference, and so on) that aﬀect the perceptual quality must be
considered as well (see Table 14.2). Especially video transport through wireless
channels is one of the prominent applications for JSCC. A JSCC that is aware
of the wireless channel9 improves the performance signiﬁcantly [25, and ref-
erences therein]. The main purpose of any type of communications is to make
sure that the information that is intended to be sent arrives at the receiver
side. Otherwise, by deﬁnition, there is no communications, which means that
there is no need to think further. Therefore, a link must exist between trans-
mitter and receiver. In terms of JSCC for video transportation, we cannot talk
anything about the source coder unless a link exists. If there is a link, then
8 The working principle of incremental redundancy method can be considered as
the reciprocal of slow start method for TCP, which was introduced before.
9 Note that some JSCC approaches do not assume the presence of any sort of
channel knowledge [24].

both source and channel coder get into the picture. In order to protect the
video information from link degradations, channel coding is applied. However,
this comes at the expense of reducing the eﬃciency of the bandwidth. If the
video information is not protected, it may not arrive or may arrive at the
receiver side but with unrecoverable errors, which causes the video to lose its
intelligibility. Source encoder removes redundancies from the video and pre-
pares the encoded scheme in an error-resilient way [26]. Before the delivery,
the information is packed as video frames. At this point, bit rate of each frame
is controlled by the rate controller according to the Channel State Information
(CSI), which is provided by lower layers such as physical layer. At the ﬁnal
stage, channel coder adds redundancies depending on the link qualiﬁcations.
Hence, in JSCC, the problem reduces to the optimization or allocation of the
total bit rate between source and channel coding operation [27].10
Cross-layer design (and therefore, cross-layer optimization) manifests it-
self in a more complicated way for wireless ad hoc networks compared to
the previous examples. Lack of communication infrastructure brings several
other issues into the picture. Unlike the systems that have infrastructure, in
ad hoc networks, each node should consider very challenging tasks in several
layers such as routing in network layer due to the dynamic topology; schedul-
ing for wireless channel access in Medium Access Control (MAC) layer; and
power control in physical layer [29]. Security can also be added on top of
these considerations [30]. Optimizing each layer one by one (as in traditional
architecture approach) may end up with high network throughput, but this
gives rise to several other considerations such as unfair transmission rates for
some of the nodes in the network [31]. Therefore, the overall optimization
must include throughput and resource utilization, congestion control [32,33],
scheduling [33, and references therein], and eﬃcient routing [31], which are
established in diﬀerent layers in traditional architecture.
After solidifying the cross-layer concept with several examples including
interaction of closer layers, distant layers, and multiple layers, it is appropri-
ate to introduce some of the adaptation parameters that are being used in
contemporary communication systems.

Used in Contemporary Communication Systems
Although the emergence of cognitive radio emphasizes the term “adaptiv-
ity” stronger than the previous communication technologies, we must note
that the evolution of wireless communications has already been going toward
adaptivity. It is not hard to see this reality when the progression of wire-
less communications in time is reviewed. When we look at the whole wireless
10 As stated in [27], this sort of approach of JSCC is limited only to the source and
channel encoders. The actual optimization includes more detailed investigation
such as power considerations [28].

communication history, we can see that the early technologies or standards
use ﬁxed schemes in the system design such as ﬁxed resource allocation, ﬁxed
frequency assignment, or ﬁxed average signal quality for the receiver designs,
and so forth [8]. Fixed scheme provides a simple design architecture, but it
also comes at the expense of sub-optimum performance because of similar
reasons discussed about traditional and cross-layer design architecture, in
Section 14.2.1. This trade-oﬀhas been realized and tried to overcome by
ﬂexing the design, which was led by adaptation.
As stated in Section 14.3.1, there are numerous examples of adaptive wire-
less systems that have already been used. Especially recent standards such as
WiMAX include many adaptation capabilities. However, these recent eﬀorts
as well as the previous adaptation methodologies focus on individual layers
and look at the problem from a narrower perspective compared to cogni-
tive radio. This is not surprising, because global adaptation requires perfect
knowledge about all the parameters in every level including the relationships
between them. But, cognitive radio, by its very deﬁnition, aims global adap-
tation. In global adaptation, some of the parameters conﬂict with each other
for speciﬁc optimization criteria. Therefore, cognitive radio must be aware of
what to change for adaptation and how those changes aﬀect the system.
There are adaptation forms that serve to attain the same goal in wireless
communication systems. One of the very well-known examples of these sorts
of adaptation methods is to maintain Bit-Error-Rate (BER) at a certain level
(constant BER). In many adaptive wireless communication systems, maintain-
ing the desired BER level is established by increasing the power level or ap-
plying Forward-Error-Correction (FEC) techniques [8]. Increasing the power
level has several side-eﬀects such as faster battery consumption, increase in
interference, and so forth. Similarly, applying FEC techniques reduces the
eﬃciency of the use of the bandwidth. In this case, exploiting the options of
attaining the same goal requires the evaluation of the side-eﬀects of each path.
Typically, when upper layer requirements are also taken into account as
in multimedia transmission, the global adaptation encompasses several con-
straints farther such as delay, perceptual quality, and so on. At this point,
cognitive radio chooses one available option that takes it to the global opti-
mum, if possible. However, introducing more constraints into the optimiza-
tion process increases the probability of conﬂict between constraints. When
an application that requires both high data rate and a constant BER is con-
sidered, applying adaptive modulation will cause the two goals to conﬂict,
because maintaining BER under a desired level is possible with reducing the
order of the modulation. This automatically reduces the data rate, under the
assumption that the other limitations are constant. Conversely, under the
same conditions, a high-data rate communication requires higher order mod-
ulation, which increases BER.
As we see, introducing even one constraint complicates the problem. Thus,
cognitive radio needs to consider the trade-oﬀs mentioned above comprehen-
sively, since there are many parameters to be adjusted. Table 14.3 provides

14.4 Cross-Layer Optimization
Although cognitive engine conceptually looks like the missing part of over-
all cross-layer adaptation and optimization, in the implementation stage, the
real challenge is to construct the formal methods that are going to run on
cognitive engine. Currently, there is no uniﬁed mathematical model that can
handle each and every one of the capabilities mentioned above. Consequently,
cognitive engine needs to have –at least until a uniﬁed model appears –several
mathematical models to cope with diﬀerent aspects of the cognition cycle.
Fortunately, there are very successful individual formal models that can
operate in particular domains of the cognition cycle such as learning, reason-
ing, multiobjective optimization, and so on. Speciﬁcally, in this section, we are
going to investigate how a MOP can be handled via available formal models.
Before getting into the details of multiobjective optimization concept, it is
appropriate to introduce the optimization problem in a general context.
14.4.1 Optimization Problems
No matter how complex the optimization problems are, the main goal of all of
them is the same: “to ﬁnd the best solution among available set of solutions
under limited resources.” In order to be able to visualize this deﬁnition, we
can consider a very well-known example called as “0–1 knapsack problem.”
According to the story, a hiker wants to put several items (such as cans of food,
bed roll, and so on) into his bag, but he cannot carry more than 70 lb [35].11
He wants to ﬁnd “the best” combination of the items which weight as close as
possible to 70 lb according to the relative value of each item determined by
himself. For instance, he may think of cans of food as more valuable than bed
roll, because food is essential for survival even though its price is less than
that of the bed roll. More explicitly, in 0–1 knapsack problem, the limited
source is the bag (or the hiker) that cannot carry more than 70 lb, whereas
the best solution corresponds to the combination of the hiker’s favorite items
that weight as close as possible to 70 lb without exceeding it.
Establishing a ‘reasonable’ solution requires the optimization problems to
have a formal model. In a general optimization problem, the formal model
relies on deﬁning the following three items:
• Variables: They comprise the essence of the problem via the mathemat-
ical relations between each other.
• Objective Function: It represents the concept that is going to be opti-
mized. It can be univariate or multivariate depending on the structure of
the problem. The purpose of the problem corresponds to obtaining either
maximum or minimum value of this function.
11 The problem is called as 0–1 knapsack problem, because the hiker either chooses
an item (which is represented by “1”) or leaves it (which is represented by “0”).

436
H¨useyin Arslan and Serhan Yarkan
• Constraints:12 As the name implies, these are the limitations by which
the objective function is going to be optimized. Along with the domain of
the objective function, it deﬁnes the feasibility region, which means that
any probable solution outside this region is going to be ignored.
Having the items listed above on our hands, the statement of the opti-
mization problem can be written as follows:
Find x∗which
minimizes f(x)
subject to ci(x) ≤0,
i = 1, 2, . . . , r
with mj(x) = 0,
j = 1, 2, . . . , h,
(14.2)
where x∗= [x1, x2, . . . , xn]T , (·)T denotes the transpose operation, f repre-
sents the objective function, ci and mj denotes the constraints.13
If one wanted to apply (14.2) to 0–1 knapsack problem, the formal model
would be as follows:
Maximize f =

i=1

i=1
aixi ≤70
with xi ∈{0, 1},
(14.3)
where bi denotes the relative value of the i-th item according to the hiker, ai
is the weight of the i-th item.
Even though (14.2) gives the formal statement of a general optimization
problem, there are numerous types of diﬀerent optimization problems. Since
there is no uniﬁed and comprehensive method available yet as stated at the
beginning of Section 14.4, classiﬁcation of the problem is extremely important,
because the approach (or the strategy) for obtaining the solution depends on
the particular class (or category). Therefore, we can brieﬂy glance at classiﬁ-
cations of optimization problems.
14.4.2 Classiﬁcations of Optimization Problems
Generally, the classiﬁcation of optimization problems is divided into three
coarse categories as follows:
1. existence of constraints,
2. structure of the variables,
3. equation types of objective function and/or constraints.
Let us now brieﬂy introduce each classiﬁcation item.
12 Note that, some types of optimization problems may not require a set of con-
straints [36].
13 In the literature, sometimes mj is omitted.

14 Cross–Layer Adaptation and Optimization for CR
437
Existence of Constraints
This sort of classiﬁcation of optimization problems has already been intro-
duced previously as constrained and unconstrained optimization problems.
Even though there are numerous types of unconstrained optimization prob-
lems (and a signiﬁcant amount techniques devoted), in cognitive radio domain,
most of the adaptations require at least one or two constraints such as battery
level, channel state, and so on. Therefore, most of the time the optimization
problems related to cognitive radio fall into the category of constrained.
Structure of the Variables
Structure of the variables determines the domain of the problem in which
it is going to be investigated. There are several structure categories such as
continuous–discrete, deterministic–stochastic, and so on. In cognitive radio
domain, for instance, in the optimization problem which includes rate con-
troller as mentioned in Section 14.3.2, the number of bits in a frame is of
discrete type. Conversely, channel state information based on Received Signal
Strength Indicator (RSSI) is of both continuous and stochastic type.
Apart from the categorization above, a diﬀerent categorization for this
topic is also possible. A problem can be considered as combinatorial or vari-
ational depending on the cardinality of the set of variables. In combinatorial
category [37], the solution set is ﬁnite.14 In variational category, basically, the
solution set is inﬁnite [38]. Especially combinatorial optimization problems
are very important for cross-layer adaptation, as mentioned in Section 14.3.2
while discussing AMC.
Equation Types of Objective Function and/or Constraints
Formal aspects of the objective function and/or constraints are extremely im-
portant to treat an optimization problem. This type of classiﬁcation is slightly
diﬀerent from the others, since particular categories deﬁne particular mathe-
matical tools. The following categories are generally referred in the literature
according to the types of the equations within the problem: linear, quadratic,
polynomial, non-linear, and sparse.
The classiﬁcation of optimization problems introduced above provides just
an idea about the concept. Apart from the classiﬁcation above, there can be
deﬁned several other categories such as “number of variables in the objective
function.” The formal and detailed classiﬁcation of the optimization problems
and relevant approaches are out of the scope of this chapter. Interested readers,
who want to gain more information about the classiﬁcation, may refer to
[39–41].
14 Knapsack problem is a combinatorial optimization problem, since the hiker can
establish his favorite combination of items over a ﬁnite set.

Cognitive Radio and Optimization Problems
Two fundamental concerns behind the conceptual model of cognitive radio are
(i) to provide backward compatibility and at the same time (ii) to improve
an already working architecture. Since the layered architecture is going to
be kept to some extent and this approach is going to be combined with
overall adaptation, we automatically face to a diﬀerent type of major clas-
siﬁcation in optimization problems, which is known as MOPs. Before investi-
gating MOPs, it is worth mentioning another approach in the literature, for
cross-layer architecture, which comprises a mid-step between single objective
function and multiobjective function.
This approach considers the use of the interaction of multiple layers to
optimize only one of the objectives. The main idea behind this approach is
to take advantage of the multi-modal structure of the current communication
standards with the aid of combinatorial optimization. Recall that in EGPRS,
the number of possible modulation schemes is limited to two, as stated in
Section 14.3.2. This means that the contribution of the physical layer to the
problem in terms of modulation is a set which has only two elements. Simi-
larly, in a IEEE 802.11a system, the modulation set has four diﬀerent modu-
lation options, which are Binary PSK (BPSK), Quadrature PSK (QPSK), 16-
Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM), and 64-QAM. As in modulation,
channel coding can be treated in the same way. If this approach is followed for
every possible layer, at the end, a comprehensive set which is composed of ele-
ments formed by the Cartesian product of every possible parameter set across
the layers is obtained. In other words, the Cartesian product of every possible
parameter set forms the solution set in which “the best” is going to be sought
for, as illustrated in Figure 14.3. Although the Cartesian product can form a
set that has a large cardinality, it is still ﬁnite [42]. Of course, this reasoning
gives rise to an obvious question: Who is responsible for the optimization?
This question can be answered in two ways: (I) without cognitive engine and
(II) with cognitive engine. For (I), there are several approaches [42]:
• Bottom-up approach: The lower layers try to save the upper layer from
the losses. This approach cannot provide an overall optimization, since it
is going to fail in multimedia applications.
• Application-centric approach: In contrast to bottom-up approach, this
approach gives the priority to the application layer to have the control
on the optimization process. This approach cannot support the overall
optimization either, because the response time of the application layer
to sudden changes in the lower layers (especially in the channel) is not
suﬃcient.
• MAC-centric approach: After seeing that pushing the responsibility
towards edges comes at the expense of sub-optimality, this approach
tries to keep the control of the optimization process around the center of

of optimization problems.
the stack. It gathers the information from the upper and lower layers and
decides upon its own criteria. The major drawback occurs in JSCC.15
For (II), the answer is easy: “cognitive engine.” Since we have not pro-
vided a substantial answer to the optimization in terms of cognitive engine,
one may ask how does cognitive radio know which combination in the solu-
tion set provides the optimum solution? As being aware of its inner and outer
world, cognitive engine deﬁnes the constraints according to its inner and outer
environment. In one scenario, cognitive engine may realize that it is running
out of battery. This automatically aﬀects the selection of the best combina-
tion and forces cognitive engine to ﬁnd a power eﬃcient one. Conversely, as
soon as the device understands that it is plugged into the electric outlet, cog-
nitive engine immediately drops the constraint of power eﬃciency and deﬁnes
another constraint accordingly.
15 In [42], there is another approach proposed for (I), which is called “integrated
approach.” Interestingly, the key point of this approach is stated as learning and
classiﬁcation techniques [43].

440
H¨useyin Arslan and Serhan Yarkan
Combinatorial approach that takes advantage of multi-modal standards
draws us near our ultimate propose, which is to get solutions for MOP. How-
ever, we have to be aware of that MOPs are of diﬀerent formalization from
that in (14.2), since the number of objective functions is more than one. Nev-
ertheless, (14.2) can be modiﬁed to reﬂect the multiobjective structure while
maintaining the general frame of the optimization concept as follows:16
Minimize F(x) = [F1(x), F2(x), . . . , Fn(x)]T ,
subject to ci(x) ≤0,
gj(x) = 0.
(14.4)
In multi-dimensional cases, the solution for optimization problem becomes
harder.17 Considering the ultimate boundary, which is time, the challenge be-
comes clearer. Recalling from the previous sections, in cognitive radio, it is
desired to have a complete adaptivity across all the layers in a short period of
time since the wireless channel is highly dynamic. Apart from that, formal-
izing the requirements of each layer depending on stochastic events (such as
channel conditions) is extremely diﬃcult. We will investigate the challenges
of cross-layer optimization in detail later. First, we outline the statement of
the problem formally.
Multiobjective Optimization Problems and Related Approaches
As their name implies, MOPs occur in a single design having multiple objec-
tives which usually contend against each other. If MOPs are also considered
in terms of the deﬁnition given at the beginning of Section 14.4.1, it is seen
that the challenging part is the allocation of resources between contenders.
We have seen some examples explicitly referring to MOPs such as the
relation between channel coding power and spectral eﬃciency. Recall that, it
is impossible to have 100% spectral eﬃciency and maximum data protection
simultaneously. When MOPs are considered, aiming maximum (or minimum)
generally loses its meaning. We say “generally,” because, in typical MOPs, it
is extremely diﬃcult to ﬁnd a solution that can maximize (or minimize) each
individual objectives simultaneously. Instead, the term solution corresponds
to a set which is composed of some alternatives representing the trade-oﬀs
between objective functions. However, there may be some extreme cases that
16 Note that, mathematically, maximization of any function f is equivalent to mini-
mizing −f. Therefore, for the sake of brevity, every optimization problem can be
deﬁned only through minimization and vice versa.
17 Again, the concept “harder” can also be deﬁned formally. As a special form of the
problem of sum-of-subsets, knapsack problem is classiﬁed as Non-deterministic
Polynomial-time Complete (NP-Complete) in connection with the decision prob-
lem (Entscheidungsproblem) [44] which is believed that coined by David Hilbert.
For the relations between optimization problem and computational complex-
ity, [45] can be referred. For proofs and further discussion please see [46,47].

14 Cross–Layer Adaptation and Optimization for CR

lead to a solution rather than a set of alternatives [48]. These extreme cases are
known as utopia [49]. Then, that solution which satisﬁes the maximization (or
minimization) of each individual objective simultaneously is called optimal.
Ignoring extreme cases for MOPs and focusing on typical ones, we want
to consider what to do when the decision time comes. At that time, an ele-
ment has to be drawn from the set of alternatives for a decision to act on. At
this point, a new notion called preference gets into the picture. It is impor-
tant to note that the notion of preference distinguishes MOPs from Global
Optimization Problems (GOPs). GOPs search for a single solution, whereas
MOPs are based on getting the best compromise between multiple objectives
in a set of alternatives. Hence, for MOPs, trade-oﬀapproach is adopted rather
than a search.18 According to the preference of the decision-maker, the no-
tion of optimality turns into another concept called eﬃciency. Eﬃciency is
the assessment of an element in the set of alternatives, which is chosen by
decision-maker according to his preference. There are several deﬁnitions of
assessment of the eﬃciency of an element in the set of alternatives. Before
explaining the relationship between eﬃciency and its assessment, we need to
introduce the notion of dominance. In MOPs, dominance expresses the pref-
erence level of the elements to each other. If one of the elements in the set, say
x2, is less preferred to another element, say x1 (because x1 provides better
values for each individual objective function simultaneously), then, it is said
that x1 dominates x2. Now, putting all the things together, we can assess the
eﬃciency of the choice of the decision-maker. Edgeworth–Pareto optimal (or
Pareto optimal [50], eﬃcient solution, nondominated solution, a noninferior,
or functional eﬃcient solution [51]) is one of the most important assessment
deﬁnitions of the eﬃciency of the element of interest. Informally, Edgeworth–
Pareto19 optimality can be deﬁned as follows:
Deﬁnition 1 (Edgeworth–Pareto optimality) In the set of alternatives
(trade-oﬀs or nondominated set), if there is no other element that can domi-
nate the element chosen from the set, the element chosen from the set is called
Edgeworth–Pareto optimal.
In order to be able to solidify the concepts mentioned up until now, it
is appropriate to examine Figure 14.4. Figure 14.4 illustrates a simple, two-
objective function optimization problem which has a convex solution set or
feasibility region. The horizontal and vertical axes denote the objective func-
tion 1 and 2, respectively. The solution set is represented with diagonally
18 In the literature, “preferences” belong to decision-maker. Decision-maker is the
one who is responsible for the ﬁnal decision [48]. Note that, even in mid-step
example introduced in Section 14.4.2 (see also Figure 14.3), the responsibility
must be taken by someone.
19 In the literature, Pareto optimal has a vaster usage than Edgeworth–Pareto opti-
mal. Edgeworth is the one who proposed the correspondent term of optimum for
multiobjective optimization problem, whereas Pareto is the one who generalized
it. For further historical discussions, please see [52,53].

shaded, convex shape. Recall that this region is determined by the constraints
peculiar to the problem. The decision-maker is allowed to choose any point
within the convex solution set including its border. As stated above, the as-
sessment is going to be established by the notion of dominance. In Figure 14.4,
point D is being dominated by point E, because point E provides lower values
for both objective functions 1 and 2, simultaneously [46,48]. This fact can be
seen through the area bounded by two dashed lines originating from point D
to the axes. Similarly, the relationship of the dominance between point E and
point B; due to the property of transitivity, the relationship between point
D and point B can be seen as well. Conversely, the curve 

As a ﬁnal remark, it must be stated that the mathematical deﬁnitions
of eﬃciency, ineﬃciency, Pareto optimality, and dominance have slight diﬀer-
ences between each other. Since these are out of the scope of this section, we

will not discuss them here. However, the readers who are interested in may
refer to [46,48–51, and references therein].
Related Approaches
As mentioned previously, MOPs are complicated structures by their nature.
Number of objective functions and vast variety of the constraints are two
prominent factors that increase their complexities. Besides, there are some
newer concepts that are not in single objective optimization problems such as
decision-maker and preferences. These complexity factors and newer concepts
together lead to have a diﬀerent classiﬁcation from the one introduced in
Section 14.4.2.
MOPs are categorized as follows depending on when the preferences of the
decision-maker involve with the algorithm [49,51]:
1. No articulation of preferences: In this sub-category, the algorithm
totally ignores the decision-maker before and during its run. However,
after the algorithm ends, it strives to provide the whole feasible set to the
decision-maker.
2. A priori: This approach assumes that the algorithm to be used has the
knowledge of the preference of the decision-maker before it runs.
3. Progressive (interactive): In this one, unlike 2, there is no chronologi-
cal order between the preference of the decision-maker and the initiation of
the relevant algorithm. The decision-maker can provide its feedback dur-
ing the operation of the algorithm. The algorithm provides a candidate
solution to the decision-maker and waits for the response of the decision-
maker. If the candidate solution is not accepted by the decision-maker,
then algorithm strives to ﬁnd a better candidate until it is accepted.20 A
further sub-classiﬁcation of this category is also possible in terms of how
the preferences expressed during the procedure as follows [55]:
• target values,
• ranking of alternatives or objectives,
• other than above.
4. A posteriori: Unlike 1, these sorts of algorithms have the capability of
narrowing down the solution space to Pareto set. The essence of these
sorts of algorithms can be summarized as “generate-ﬁrst-choose-later.”
As discussed before, due to lack of a uniﬁed method, we need to categorize
the problems so that we can apply speciﬁc tools to speciﬁc classes. Table 14.4
tabulates some of the methods available.
If the list of taxonomy above is examined in detail, it can be observed that
the involvement of the decision-maker with the process needs formalization
20 An application of such an interactive optimization procedure and the relevant
ﬂow chart is presented in [54].

as well. Then, how can we put the preferences of the decision-maker into
the mathematical model we developed? The answer to this question, again,
comes from the roots of the theory, which is economics. The function which
represents the preferences of the decision-maker is called preference function

14 Cross–Layer Adaptation and Optimization for CR
445
or utility function.21 With the aid of utility function, the formal model can
be applied for the models which require decision-maker’s feedback.
According to the taxonomy of MOPs and Table 14.4, we see that for
“no articulation of preferences,” the decision-maker is being dictated by the
algorithm, which means that decision-maker has no control on the process
[49, 51, 55]. When we consider cognitive engine, it looks a bit controversial,
because whatever the solution method is chosen, it is going to run on cognitive
engine. This problem arises from the fact that proposed solution methods
are implemented on a diﬀerent platform such as computer. Conversely, for
cognitive radio, the problem, the solution, and even the decision-maker are
all in the same platform. This implication proves that cognitive engine must
have diﬀerent units which govern the separated processes such as running the
algorithm, evaluating the preferences, and so on.22
14.4.3 Challenges for Cross-Layer Optimization
Before integrating cognitive engine into the traditional architecture, we have
to pay more attention to several aspects of cross-layer design and optimization.
First and foremost, MOPs are naturally challenging due to the number of
objectives involved with the problem. It is clear that the less the number
of objectives, the less complex the problem. In addition, since we want to
maintain the layered architecture to some extent, we must be aware of that
each layer has its own design criteria. Besides, we seek for a formal model that
encompasses all the layers, variables, constraints, and even objectives which
are deﬁned on diﬀerent domains [18]. For instance, minimum bit-error-rate
and no congestion are two separate objectives for physical and network layer,
respectively. Thus, formalizing these diﬀerent objectives together and putting
them onto a common mathematical platform are very challenging problems.
Furthermore, in spite of the fact that some solutions for MOPs have really
fast convergence rates, for wireless devices that operates in very dynamic
environments, the delay requirements are very tight. Another dimension of
delay bottleneck challenges us in sharing the information through layers [9,18],
sensors, and other peripherals of cognitive radio. In order for the solution to
work appropriately, all the information should be available to cognitive engine
before the optimization process starts. As a direct consequence of number of
21 In economics, the concept of “utility” (or satisfaction) comes from the basic
consumer–entrepreneur relationship. In a system that includes both consumer
and entrepreneur, the purpose is to attain maximum utility (or satisfaction) for
the consumer and maximum proﬁt for the entrepreneur [56]. Morover, includ-
ing/removing uncertainty (or risk) into/from the system causes this function to
be named utility function/value function, respectively [48]. Nevertheless, the term
preference function can be used for both risk and risk-free systems.
22 Interestingly, current computers are designed based on von Neumann architecture,
which has separate control, calculation, memory, input and output units [57].
Furthermore, this design operates as Universal Turing Machine.

objectives and delay requirements, solution for MOPs themselves may need
an optimization since it consumes resources of the device. In other words,
calculating the optimum allocation of a resource consumes the other system
resources as well. Finally, it is known that cross-layer design can cause loops
due to some interactions of layers bringing forward another challenging notion
to be considered, which is known as stability [58].
At this point, we need to address another concern about cross-layer design
and optimization. Before the concept of cognitive radio and therefore cog-
nitive engine were introduced, one of the biggest challenges for cross-layer
architecture had been that: “who has control? [18]”23 With the emergence of
cognitive radio, we can say that this question becomes obsolete.
Throughout Section 14.4.2, we expressed that the concept of decision-
maker lies on the heart of MOPs along with preferences. We can say the same
thing for cognitive engine in cognitive radio architecture. However, we also
state that some of the problems have already been solved by the traditional
architecture very eﬃciently. Therefore, in cognitive radio architecture, it is
very reasonable to avoid MOPs unless they are needed. In other words, unless
the intervention of cognitive radio is inevitable, cognitive engine does not need
to get involved with the optimization process.
14.5 Further Notes
Up to this section, we outlined the methods to solve optimization problems for
cognitive engine. However, it is worth mentioning that there are two very im-
portant accessories, which assist cognitive engine in solving the optimization
problems: game theory and neural networks.
Our main focus was the optimization of the cross-layer architecture for a
single device up to this point. One can suspect that optimizing one device
in a network may not end up with a fully optimized network. Actually, this
can easily be seen by using the same notions of multiobjective optimization
discussed at the beginning of Section 14.4.2. In a network in which each node
is trying to optimize its own objectives, a conﬂict between each node for sev-
eral resources is highly probable. This phenomenon manifests itself in ad hoc
networks very clearly [32]. Therefore, individual optimizations may need to be
established for the sake of optimization of the network. Of course, these sorts
of optimizations are of diﬀerent type compared to individual optimizations,
since there are two nested systems to be optimized: individual optimization
and network optimization. Meanwhile, as in MOPs, we need to refrain our-
selves from using the term “optimization” under those circumstances. Instead,
the term “common satisfaction” may be much more appropriate. Then, the
crucial question becomes: how do we attain a common satisfaction? In order
to answer this question, we are going to review game theory brieﬂy.
23 Recall that, this question is investigated in Section 14.4.2 in a diﬀerent form.

resembles von Neumann architecture [57] because of the simplicity in the design

Foundation of game theory is based on economics. The main idea behind
the game theory is that, as deﬁned in [56], the quantiﬁcation of the problem of
the rational behavior. The theory is constructed ﬁrst for an isolated econom-
ical system, which is inspired from Robinson Crusoe.24 Then, by introducing
several individuals more, a social economy concept is introduced. Each indi-
vidual acts rationally to attain its own satisfaction. Each individual develops a
strategy depending on the system. Then, as in MOPs, each strategy is deﬁned
by a utility function which is tried to be reached to a static equilibrium rather
than an “optimum” [56].
With this new perspective of rational behavior, many engineering problems
in which there are several participants can be formalized and treated. In the
24 As a historical note, it must be stated that the idea of rational behavior of an
isolated human ﬁrst appears with Abu Bakr Ibn Tufail (known as Abubacer in
Latin) who was the author of “Hay bin Yakzan” (Hayy Ibn Yaqzan), the prede-
cessor of Robinson Crusoe. In fact, the name of the hero of the story comes from
another story with the same name written previously by a Turkish philosopher
˙Ibni Sina [59], who is known as Avicenna in Latin.

literature, related to wireless communications, there are also several studies
that apply game theory to solve complex problems such as random access and
power control [60].
Similar to game theory, neural networks must be addressed as another
assisting tool for cross-layer adaptation and optimization. Stemming from
their parallel processing power, neural networks are one of the essential tools
for cognitive engine to cope with several problems. Inspired by the operation
of nervous systems of biological organisms, neural networks have the capabil-
ity of generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error-correction,
and time sequence retention [61]. As can be seen, such properties can assist
cognitive engine in many diﬀerent areas including cross-layer adaptation and
optimization. There are several applications related to amalgamation of neural
networks and cross-layer design [62,63]. Furthermore, we begin to see that the
intelligence governing and/or assisting the protocol process is being embedded
into cross-layer structure through specialized layers called “cognitive layer,”
as well [64].
In light of this discussion, a basic cognitive engine structure can be as in
Figure 14.5.
14.6 Conclusion
In this chapter, we tried to elucidate the entangled relationship between
cognitive radio and cross-layer architecture. The rise of cognitive radio
implies an inherent cross-layer design by its very deﬁnition including self-
and environmental-awareness and adaptation. In parallel, the eﬀorts to relax
the traditional architecture point out a new intelligent structure that can pro-
vide a complete adaptation. The missing link in the chain of amalgamation
of cognitive radio and cross-layer design is cognitive engine. Various work has
been carried out to establish this uniﬁcation. It is not hard to see that there
are very challenging issues including both formal and design aspects of the
merge. However, no matter how hard the problems are, the innovations that
come together with cognitive radio tempt the research community to make
the dream come true.
