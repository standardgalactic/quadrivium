This is another variety of optimizations that can occur at compile time.
Constant expressions
numeric calculations
24 * 60
Python will actually pre-calculate 24 * 60 →1440
short sequences length < 20
(1, 2) * 5
'abc' * 3
'the quick brown fox' * 10
but not
'hello’ + ‘ world’
→(1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2)
→abcabcabc
→hello world
(more than 20 characters)

Membership Tests: Mutables are replaced by Immutables
When membership tests such as:
if e in [1, 2, 3]:
are encountered, the [1, 2, 3] constant, is replaced by its immutable counterpart
(1, 2, 3)
tuple
•
lists →tuples
•
sets →frozensets
Set membership is much faster than list or tuple membership (sets are basically like dictionaries)
So, instead of writing:
if e in [1, 2, 3]:
if e in (1, 2, 3):
or
write
if e in {1, 2, 3}:
