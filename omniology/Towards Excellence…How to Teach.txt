Message from Rev. Fr. Valerian D’Souza, Director, SJEC
Message from Rev. Fr. Valerian 
D’Souza, Director, SJEC
Anyone can talk about how important the role of a teacher is, but rarely do we come across a person 
who can give practical ideas on teaching. Dr. M. Thirumaleshwar who has a vast experience in teaching 
in the technical field within and outside the country, has shared his experience in this booklet “Towards 
Excellence…How to Teach”, a guide book to teachers. He answers the question of what it means to be a 
teacher. According to our Indian tradition a teacher is called “guru”, who moulds the total personality 
of “shishya”. Teaching is not to be considered a job but a vocation from God to make a student a true 
human being.
Our nation is on the march towards a bright and prosperous tomorrow. The social organ that had to 
play the most important role in this aspect is education. Without a sound and goal oriented system of 
education, the dream of reconstructing the nation’s economic, social and political life cannot be realized. 
In order to fulfill the ideals, the quality of education imparted to the children has to be improved.
The quality of education depends upon the quality of the teachers. Thus the role of the teachers is very 
important in making the nation. If the teachers are excellent the nation will have excellent citizens. If 
the teachers are substandard God help the nation.
According to Courtis Stuart A: “A teacher is an agent appointed to develop citizenship who can live 
successfully in the culture of the country”.
We all agree how true these ideals are. How to put these into practice is the question.
I am sure that this booklet in the hands of a teacher will be a treasure for life. It will constantly remind 
and motivate the teacher in the noble mission of teaching. As Henry Adams says “A teacher affects 
eternity, he can never tell when his influence stops”.

Preface
Preface
This booklet for teachers is the second of the three books in the “Towards Excellence…” series. These 
books were first authored and published by me with generous financial help from the Director, St. Joseph 
Engineering College, Vamanjoor, Mangalore, India, and distributed for free to schools, Pre-University, 
Degree and Professional colleges in Mangalore Dioces area. The books were received very enthusiastically 
by students (and parents and teachers too) and there was great demand/suggestion to put them on the 
Internet so that a larger number of readers can take benefit of these books. The first book for students, viz. 
“Towards Excellence…How to study” was put on the Internet a few days ago, by courtesy of Bookboon. 
Now, the second book, viz. “Towards Excellence…How to Teach” is being put on the Internet. The third 
book, “Towards Excellence…Seminars, GD’s and Personal Interviews” will follow soon.
This book-let for teachers is the outcome of lecture notes prepared by the author while delivering lectures 
to the teaching faculty of St. Joseph Engineering College, Vamanjoor, Mangalore, and, earlier at the Fr. 
Conceicao Rodrigues Institute of Technology, Vashi, Navi Mumbai. Author would like to make it clear 
that he does not pose to give any ‘advice’ to teachers, since he feels that he has yet to learn quite a lot; 
however, the motivation to write this book-let is only to share the ideals, information and resources that 
the author has collected over the years.
These lectures are directed towards both the new lecturers and the experienced ones. 
The ‘teaching-learning’ process is treated as one package. In Sections 1 to 7, greatness of the teaching 
profession, qualities of a good teacher and expectations of students are explained. In Section 8, the 
entire teaching process involving planning, preparation of lectures, delivering it in the class effectively, 
assessment of students, evaluation and grading, record keeping, giving the feed back to students and 
parents are explained in detail. Section 9 enumerates different teaching styles, and in Section 10, some 
points to be remembered for exemplary teaching are summarized. Next, in Sections 11 and 12, important 
tips are given for both the new and experienced teachers. Section 13 suggests the methods of getting 
feedback on the teaching. Next, Reasons for ‘stress’ in teachers and the ways to handle the same are 
enumerated in Section 14. Then, the important topic of ‘Teachers and Human Values’ and ‘Education 
and Educare’, and the importance of inculcation of ‘Human Values’ in the students to make them honest, 
upright citizens of this country are emphasized in Section 15. Section 16 contains ‘Seven C’s for Success’, 
stated succinctly. Conclusion is given in Section 17, and the section on References includes addresses of 
some websites which will be very useful to teachers. Appendix-I contains a typical, Students’ feedback
form and a typical questionnaire. In Appendix-II, words of advice given by Sri Sathya Sai Baba to the 
teachers, gleaned from some of His discourses, are given. In Appendix-III, some inspiring quotations 
from famous personalities are included.

A teacher is held in high esteem in our culture:
2	 A teacher is held in high esteem 
in our culture:
It is a well known fact that any skill, art or knowledge is better gained through a teacher. Teacher is 
also addressed as ‘Guru’. The Sanskrit word ‘Guru’ has deep meaning: ‘one who dispels the darkness of 
ignorance’. That is why, in our Indian culture, teacher is highly venerated, nay, he is equated with God 
himself. In praise of Guru, there is a well known hymn, which declares: ‘Guru is Lord Brahma, Vishnu 
and Maheshwara; Verily, Guru is the Supreme Parabrahma. Therefore, salutations to Guru!’. Having said 
this, I should also add that, therefore, it becomes our duty and responsibility to live up to these ideals 
and expectations of our students and society.

Greatness of Teacher:
3	 Greatness of Teacher:
There is a joke about the ‘greatness’ of teacher: It seems that a school inspector, during the course of 
inspection of a primary school, entered a class and asked a student: ‘who is greater – your mother, father 
or teacher?’; the child replied immediately: ‘certainly, my teacher is the greatest!’ The teacher of the class 
felt gratified; the inspector asked again: ‘why do you say so?’ The child said innocently: ‘my father tries 
to put me to sleep by telling me stories for a long time; my mother tries to put me to sleep by singing 
lullabies for a long time; but, as soon as my teacher starts speaking in the class, I am overpowered by 
sleep! Not only that, all the 30 of us in this class sleep within a minute! Therefore, my teacher is the 
greatest!’ Friends, surely, we don’t wish to be known as ‘great’ in this manner. But, it is a fact that students 
remember their good teachers for their entire life time when they are impressed by their teachers’ love, 
good manners, good teaching, uprightness, integrity, discipline and other human qualities. Let us be 
known as ‘great teachers’ for these qualities.
Ponder over this oft-quoted quotation from William Arthur Ward:
•	 The mediocre teacher…tells
•	 The good teacher…explains
•	 The superior teacher…demonstrates, and
•	 The Great teacher…INSPIRES!
Friends, let us all aspire to become such teachers, who not only teach, but, inspire their students to reach 
great heights of excellence! Let us be catalysts to ‘ignite their minds’, as our respected Scientist and former 
President, Dr. Abdul Kalam has said.

Teaching is a noble profession:
4	 Teaching is a noble profession:
Teaching is known as ‘noble’ profession. Why? There are good reasons:
•	 In teaching, you also learn; that is why, it is said: ‘if you want to learn a subject, teach it!’
•	 Teacher imparts knowledge to the student; this helps the student earn his living.
•	 More importantly, teacher moulds the character and personality of the student; this gives him 
culture and stands in good stead throughout his life.
•	 That is why, it is said: “Education is not only for a living, but for Life”.
•	 While teaching ideals to his students, a thoughtful teacher always introspects: ‘Am I living up 
to what I am teaching?’; thus, a teacher has a continuous scope for improvement.
•	 A teacher, by the very nature of his work, has to develop patience, love and affection for his 
students, to be an effective teacher.
•	 Teaching involves great sacrifices. It is not a ‘nine-to-five job’. That is why, it is said: ‘A teacher 
is like a candle…it consumes itself to light the way for others!’ Further…

Teaching is a profession that teaches all other professions:
5	 Teaching is a profession that 
teaches all other professions:
Surely, all the ‘great achievers’ in any profession learnt through some teacher or other. One learns not 
only the concerned skill or academic matter from his teacher, but the entire personality of the student 
is shaped by an effective and efficient teacher. Therefore, the teacher is highly respected in society. Let 
me illustrate this with a story:
It seems that the king of a country desired to honor some ‘great achievers’ in his country. So, he gave 
instructions to his minister to find out such persons. After a survey, the minister identified five ‘great 
achievers’ in their respective areas. They were: one engineer, one doctor, one artist, one poet, and one 
philosopher. A meeting was held to honor these persons. They were all seated on the stage and when the 
minister was about to introduce them to the audience, they saw one old man being guided to the front 
row by the organizers. As soon as he came to the front row to occupy his seat, all the five ‘achievers’ 
sitting on the stage stood up and paid their respects to that old man. The king got curious and asked the 
minister about the identity of the old man. The minister replied that he was the retired primary school 
teacher who had taught all these five achievers. Immediately, the king said: ‘this old school teacher is 
the ‘greatest achiever’ and deserves the highest honor, because he has been instrumental in producing 
these five jewels of our country!’ Of course, the minister, the ‘five achievers’ and the entire audience 
agreed with the king!
Dear friends! Such is the esteem in which a teacher is held. What is the reason? Because he imparts 
essential education to his pupil. It is said that by birth, man is only an animal, and education with human 
values makes him a real human being! Listen to what Swami Vivekananda has said about requirements 
of education: ‘Education is the manifestation of perfection already in man; we want that education 
by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, intellect is expanded, and by which 
one can stand on one’s own feet’. Indeed, this a tall order for the teacher. He has to produce a glittering 
diamond by cutting the edges and polishing the faces, from the base stone supplied to him! To do this 
‘man building’ work, a teacher needs to have certain qualities. What are these qualities?

Qualities of a good teacher:
6	 Qualities of a good teacher:
The word ‘TEACHER’ itself indicates the essential qualities that a teacher should have:
•	 T…Truthful, Trustworthy, Talented: Truth is the strong foundation on which the superstructure 
of life has to be built. The teacher should exemplify this. Also, the teacher, by his affection 
towards the student, must be able to get his trust. And, obviously, he must have the talent to 
teach and reform the student.

Qualities of a good teacher:
•	 E…Enlightened, Enterprising, Enthusiastic: The teacher must be enlightened, i.e. not only an 
authority in the subject he teaches, but, he must also have the sensitivity to understand what 
is good for the student and impart the essential human values to him to make him a better 
citizen. He must be enterprising to make the best of his resources and opportunities, and of 
course, he must have an unfailing enthusiasm to teach.
•	 A…Accessible, Adaptable, Admirable: The teacher must be accessible to his student, i.e. he 
must come down to the level of the student. He should be able to adapt to the situation, capacity 
and receptivity of the student. By his sincerity, integrity and ability, he should command the 
admiration of his students.
•	 C…Character, Creative, Caring: Teacher should be a person of sterling character. He should 
be creative and innovative and must make use of these talents in his teaching. He should 
genuinely care for the students placed under his care.
•	 H…Humane, Humility, Helpful: A teacher should shine with human qualities. His knowledge 
should make him humble and not proud; he should be ever helpful to his students.
•	 E…Empathy, Eager, Excellence: Teacher should have sympathy and empathy towards his 
students, their difficulties, failings and sorrows. Sympathy is expressed in words; empathy 
from the heart. A kind word, small gesture, even a look or a gentle stroke on the back, will 
make the student feel re-assured that ‘my teacher is with me’. Be eager to do anything that is 
good for the student. Let ‘Excellence’ be the motto for the teacher – excellence in knowledge 
and human relations.
•	 R…Resourceful, Reasonable, Respected: Be resourceful, i.e. make the best use of the situation 
to lead the student towards the goal; but, be reasonable in ‘pushing’ him, i.e. be aware of your 
student’s limitations. And command the respect of your students by your sincerity, knowledge, 
teaching and demeanor.
My friends! I know that you will tell me ‘surely, we are all ordinary human beings, and we may not 
have all these qualities in us’. Never mind; once we are aware of these ideals, we must strive to enrich 
ourselves with these qualities by regular introspection and constant efforts. That is how we evolve and 
ennoble ourselves. That is how we justify belonging to this ‘noble profession’.

Expectations of students:
7	 Expectations of students:
To be an effective teacher, one should be able to correspond with the students and be in tune with them. 
This is possible when you are aware of their expectations from you.
When a survey was conducted among the high school students in England, students said that following 
are their expectations from a good teacher:
•	 He is kind and generous
•	 He listens to you
•	 He encourages you
•	 He has faith in you
•	 You can confide in him
•	 He loves teaching
•	 He knows his subject
•	 He explains things
•	 He helps when you are stuck
•	 He tells you where you stand
•	 He has patience and does not give up
•	 He allows you to have your say
•	 He cares for you and makes you feel ‘special’
•	 He treats all equally
•	 He supports you
•	 He makes allowances for your shortcomings
•	 He tells you the truth
•	 He is forgiving
My friends! Indeed, we will become ideal human beings if we are able to live up to these expectations 
of students.

Expectations of students:
In addition, some experts have enumerated the following requirements as the desirable qualities in a 
good teacher:
•	 He has a sense of purpose…yes, he enters the class room with a plan and a purpose, i.e. to 
communicate to his students effectively.
•	 He teaches you to ‘learn’…to learn a thing, you should have a strong desire to go to the very 
root of things; it is not done just in one class, nay, it is a life long process. A great teacher 
motivates you to do it.
•	 He inspires you with his passion…with his very strong desire to teach you, he ignites a 
strong desire in you to be receptive; when these ‘two desires’ meet, fire of knowledge and 
understanding ‘happens’.
•	 He keeps you focused with his skill…his words will be ‘song’ for your ears and he will keep 
you engrossed in the subject without any stress on your part, and you admire him for his skills.
•	 He gives clear explanations, but tolerates ambiguity on your part…he explains well, but 
tolerates you if you do not comprehend fully in the first instance.
•	 He makes complicated things look simple…this is his ‘teaching skill’. After attending his class, 
you will feel: ‘I never thought this subject to be so simple!’
•	 He expects and wishes for success for every one…he is good at heart, he is your well – wisher, 
friend and guide. 
•	 He adapts to meet the needs of students…he is flexible in his approach; his main intention 
is that you should understand what he says. He is prepared to come down to your level.
•	 He is knowledgeable, but is comfortable with (your) ignorance…he is certainly an authority 
in his subject; at the same time, he is aware that you are sitting in his class because you don’t 
know the subject, but wish to learn. So, he is tolerant and compassionate.
•	 He reflects on his work and is a continuous learner…education gives him ‘humility’. So, he 
is willing to know his own short-comings and improve. So, he is a continuous learner.
•	 He enjoys his teaching and the company of his students!…Surely, he must! Otherwise, he 
can not be a good teacher!

A successful teacher…
8	 A successful teacher…
What is said in the foregoing are the qualities that an ideal teacher should have. But, in the real-world 
situation, we are all ordinary mortals and have our own limitations. So, our aim should be to keep these 
ideals always in front of us and strive to reach up to them. Now, a successful teacher has to prepare 
his lessons well. In fact, it is said that ‘Good teaching is one-fourth preparation and three-fourths 
theater’. This means that not only you have to prepare the lesson well, but, you also have to deliver it 
in the class very effectively.
 Characteristics of a successful teacher are:
•	 He plans carefully: One should plan the lesson, delivery, teaching techniques, teaching aids, 
models required if any, projects related to the subject, question-answer session etc. very carefully 
and systematically to make the teaching-learning process most effective.
•	 He prepares thoroughly: Needless to say, he must be well prepared in his subject before going 
to the class. Prepare an exhaustive class notes referring to various sources.

A successful teacher…
•	 He delivers effectively: This is the crucial part. This is where ‘three-fourths theater’ part of 
the above saying comes in. Even with the best of preparation, a teacher will be a failure if the 
communication is not effective. So, plan what to say in the introduction, anecdotes, jokes, 
important practical applications of the topic being taught etc. Take steps to enhance your ‘public 
speaking skills’ by discussing with colleagues or by attending some special training courses.
•	 He assesses objectively: Assessing the students is an important aspect of the teachers’ job! It 
gives you a feedback about the effectiveness of your teaching and also about the capacity and 
ability of your students. Do this objectively by devising suitable written, viva-voce or practical/
laboratory exams, depending on the curriculum requirements of the subject being taught.
•	 He evaluates impartially: Evaluate the answers given by students honestly. Be impartial; have 
no favorites! Your aim is to tell the student honestly where he stands.
•	 He records neatly: Record keeping is an essential, but laborious and disliked part of the job! But, 
it has to be done neatly, since the Board or the University or any other concerned educational 
authorities would like to have a written assessment of the records to declare the results. These 
records will also be required to do re-evaluation, if need arises.
•	 He gives corrective feed back to students/parents lovingly: This is also an important aspect 
of the job and should be done honestly and tactfully. If the performance of the student is not 
up to the mark, you should say so, but say with a human touch, and genuine concern. Let it 
not look like an attack on the student, but rather, let your words of advice be enveloped by 
love, sympathy, support and encouragement.
Now, let us consider each of the above mentioned characteristics in a little more detail:

8.1	
Planning the lecture:
Planning the lecture is the most important part of the preparation. You may have a large amount of well 
researched material to be presented; but, an unplanned lecture given in a casual manner can become 
very un-impressive. Consider the following points while planning your lecture:
•	 Know the topic and the intellectual level of the audience: This is a valid point whether 
you are handling a regular course for a class or giving a ‘popular lecture’ to a large audience. 
Knowing the topic in advance helps you to collect, collate and organize the required material 
for the lecture. Knowing the type and level of audience helps you decide the depth and width 
of the subject you have to cover in your lecture and the methods to be adopted for effective 
communication.
•	 Collect the syllabus, past 4 years’ exam papers, required text books and reference books: 
You have to do this if you are teaching a subject course for students who have to appear for 
a university/board exam at the end of the course. Since the time scale to cover the syllabus is 
prescribed, it will help you to plan the schedule and determine the pace of lectures if you have 
the syllabus with you. Perusing the previous years’ question papers will give you an idea about 
the type of questions asked on a given topic in the prescribed syllabus; it will also tell you about 
the ‘standard questions’ which are more frequently asked. You can train your students to face the 
exams accordingly. Of course, you should have access to standard text books, reference books 
or relevant journals, depending upon the nature and depth of the subject you are dealing with.
•	 Decide if it should be a class room lecture, demonstration or practical: This will depend upon 
the syllabus and the requirements of the curriculum. If it is a class room lecture, you will have 
to prepare accordingly; if it is a demonstration or practical class, then you will have to set up 
the experiment and draw up a scheme for conducting the demonstration/experiment. Students 
may have to be divided into batches; conducting the experiment, safety aspects involved, taking 
readings, doing calculations, drawing graphs, presenting the results in a report etc. have to be 
explained to the students clearly. Take the help of a colleague, if required.
•	 Are design hand books or data books required? Some of the classes (particularly in engineering 
courses) may require the students to use hand-books or design data books. In that case, plan to 
supply them to the students or instruct the students in advance to bring such books to the class.

•	 Consider the use of modern teaching aids: Even though the traditional way of using the black 
board and chalk is still the most effective method, make your lecture more interesting by the 
use of teaching aids such as Overhead projector (OHP) or LCD projector, if you have access 
to a computer. If you have many diagrams to draw, or if you have to show many graphs, or if 
you want to show beautiful photographs of a Plant room, or nice animations of, say, working 
of an engine etc. use of OHP and/or LCD projector is essential. Develop your skill to use these 
aids most effectively.
•	 Write down the outline: While planning your lecture, write down the outline of the lecture 
and also the time plan. Writing down will help you to ensure that you don’t miss any points 
and to communicate most effectively within the stipulated time limit.
•	 Collect motivational materials: In addition to the actual subject matter of your lecture, 
have motivational information such as history, practical applications, research possibilities, 
anecdotes etc. ready. It will make your class more informative and lively.
•	 Remember, students have to write the University exam! Yes, preparing the students to face the 
exam is an important aspect. While planning the lessons, have a frequent look at the syllabus 
and previous University question papers; note down the way in which a question is asked on a 
given topic, relative importance given to a particular topic, how frequently a particular question 
is repeated, etc. and give suitable guidance and hints to the students.

Preparation of the lecture:
This step involves having a hard look at the outline of the talk, collecting required material, collating 
them, jotting down points, writing the lecture notes, preparing the slides, PowerPoint presentations etc. 
Following points may be helpful in preparing the lecture:
•	 Have a second look at the outline of your talk. Think mentally about the possible resources 
required to make your talk most effective.
•	 Next, refer to standard text books, reference books, journals or internet to collect the relevant 
information and jot down the important points; then, re-arrange them in the required order.
•	 Refer to previous University question papers, note down the questions that appeared on the 
topic concerned.
•	 Now, for introduction of the topic: how will you introduce the topic in an interesting manner? 
It may be a good idea to start with some historical note, anecdote or important practical 
applications of the topic being taught.
•	 Next comes the main body of the lecture. Prepare tables, graphs, transparencies, PowerPoint 
presentation slides, models etc. as appropriate. Do some extra study to learn how to prepare 
them effectively and efficiently. Enjoy doing it.
•	 Have some quotations, story, joke or anecdotes ready to be used at appropriate times during 
the lecture; but, be careful not to overdo it!
•	 Ending of the lecture: This is very important, and should be planned intelligently. You want 
your audience to remember and ruminate over your lecture, long after your lecture is over. So, 
end your lecture on a high note, with emphasis and inspiration. End with some great quotation, 
small story or an emotional appeal.

8.3	
Delivering the lecture:
This is the most important aspect of your lecture; so, it should be planned thoroughly. Don’t think that 
just having the well prepared notes in your hands is enough to deliver a very impressive talk! You have 
to practise it, go over it mentally a few times and do a rehearsal in front of friends, if possible. Also, 
attend to your dress, posture, body language, mannerism, language, pronunciation, facial expressions etc. 
If you find the need, attend a ‘public speaking course’ to hone up your speaking skills. Some important 
points in connection with the delivery of the lecture are enumerated below:
•	 Dress appropriately, be punctual and be confident: Dress should not be too gaudy or 
outrageous; it should be simple and decent for a regular school/college class room. You may 
dress formally if it is a special occasion, where you have to speak in a formal function. Be 
punctual to the class. Be dignified and confident. Being conscious that you have prepared very 
well for the lecture itself will induce great confidence in you.
•	 Never go to the class without your written lecture notes: Some lecturers think that going 
to the class without any notes in your hands makes ‘great impression’ on the students! You 
are mistaken! You can impress the students only by your excellent teaching. You should carry 
your written notes to the class, and should not hesitate to refer to them whenever required.
•	 Don’t carry a text book to the class: It is not a good practice to carry the text book to the 
class and start reading it there, if you are taking a class to engineering students. Instead, have 
your written notes with you; and, if required, you may carry the data book or handbooks to 
demonstrate their use to the students. (Of course, if it is a language class, you may need to 
carry the text book to the class.) 
•	 Be pleasant, smile, introduce the topic and follow the plan: After you enter the class, greet 
the students, smile, be pleasant, make some preliminary remarks, and confidently introduce 
the topic. Have your outline plan and follow it.
•	 Don’t hesitate to refer to your notes: As you progress with the lecture, don’t hesitate to refer 
to your notes, whenever required. Don’t think that referring to your notes is a negative point; 
in fact, your audience will appreciate how well and systematically you have prepared.

•	 Let it not be a monologue: Don’t speak continuously for a long time. Let the talk be interactive. 
Give them time to absorb what you speak. Ask a few questions in between to find out if the 
students are following what you are saying. Have some other activity such as asking questions, 
telling an anecdote or story related to the topic.
•	 Maintain general eye contact: This is important. Many new lecturers ‘stare at infinity’ to avoid 
eye contact with the audience. This is not correct. You should maintain general eye contact 
with your students. But, don’t stare at any particular individual for a long time since it will 
distract others in the class. Informal, friendly eye contact brings your students ‘nearer’ to you 
and makes them more receptive to your talk.
•	 Emote your voice, tone: Yes, let your lecture be like a friendly conversation and not as delivered 
from an unapproachable high ‘ivory tower’! Bring variation to your voice and tone and speak 
with ‘feeling’.
•	 Be animated: Use appropriate gestures, body language, facial expressions to communicate 
effectively. Do you know that even ‘silence’ can be a very effective tool to communicate? Use 
silence to emphasize the importance of something just stated, or for the matter just said to 
sink in, or for the students to ruminate over some point.

•	 Attend to your language, grammar, diction, posture, mannerism etc.: Language should be 
simple. If you are teaching engineering, you impress your students, not by your vocabulary, but 
by your technical knowledge. Having said this, I should also add that having a good vocabulary 
is an added asset! Make no grammar mistakes; such mistakes will be easily noted by others. For 
example, if you say ‘I goes’ or ‘You goes’, they are glaring mistakes which everyone will notice. It 
seems, once there was a lecturer, who, asked his student to go out of the class saying: ‘If you don’t 
get out, I will ask the Principal to get out!’ Such sentences will be remembered by the students 
for ever as ‘jokes of the year’! Also, attend to your diction and pronunciation. If your language 
is not up to standard, make conscious efforts to improve it. Be conscious of your mannerisms. 
Without your being aware of it, you may have some funny habit or mannerism: wringing the 
hands, biting the nails, biting the chalk or ball pen, putting the hands in the pocket, twiddling 
with the shirt buttons, thrusting the hand kerchief in to the nostrils, using the same word or 
phrase repeatedly in every sentence…etc. Ask your friends in the staff- room to give you the 
necessary corrective feedback and make conscious efforts to get rid of such funny mannerisms.
•	 Move around in the class: This makes the students feel ‘close’ to you. You also get an opportunity 
to see how they are taking down the notes and you can make brief enquiries with some students 
if they face any difficulty.
•	 Use transparencies, slides etc. as appropriate: Depending upon the subject you are handling, 
use transparencies or presentation slides. Prepare your slides carefully, keeping in mind the 
general rules of preparing them. Let the letters in the slides be large enough to be seen by 
students sitting on the last bench. Let the slides be legible, and not cramped with written 
material. Use graphs, charts, tables, photographs etc. for good effect.
•	 Be very clear, objective: Write down important points on the black board. Emphasize what 
they should note down in their notes and what they should do at home for further study. Quote 
important questions from the University question papers. Tell them regarding good reference 
books or journals or internet sites related to the topic under discussion.
•	 Summarize your talk: It is a good practice to summarize your talk during the last 10 minutes 
or so. Motivate your students to do further study and reference. Give them some assignment 
or home work.

For Laboratory instructors:
Laboratory instructor may not have to climb the platform and give a regular lecture. However, he is in 
charge of the lab and it is his responsibility to keep the lab ready when the students come, and get the 
experiments / demonstration done. He should also ensure the safety of the equipments as well as of the 
students. Following points may be worth noting in connection with the lab work:
•	 Set up the lab before the students arrive there: Make sure that the experiment, instrumentation, 
utilities such as water, chemicals, electricity, gas supply…etc. as needed, are kept ready.
•	 Form teams: When the students arrive, make teams of 3 or 4 students each, to perform the 
experiments. You may form the teams or allow the students to form the teams themselves.
•	 Assign roles: Assign roles to each member of the team, i.e. to perform the experiment, take 
readings, to record the readings, to do calculations and draw graphs…etc.
•	 Explain the procedure: Briefly explain the procedure of conducting the experiment, recording 
the data, doing the calculations, drawing graphs, forming conclusions and writing the report. 
Use the black board or slides, as needed, to explain.
•	 Emphasize safety: Safety of equipments and personal safety of students is of paramount 
importance while conducting experiments. Instruct the students well about the safety 
procedures and the emergency procedures to be followed.
•	 Let students perform experiments: Let the students perform the experiment. However, you 
should be available at hand, to solve their doubts or if there is an emergency.
•	 Collect the lab data and reports: After the experiments are done, let the students write their 
reports and hand them over to you.
•	 Return the lab to order: Take the help of the students to bring the lab back to order, so that 
the next batch of students can perform the experiments.

Assessment of students:
As stated earlier, assessment of students, evaluation and grading, record keeping and giving timely, corrective 
feed back to students/parents is an important part of a teacher’s responsibility. Assessment/test has to be 
planned properly. Give sufficient time for the students to prepare. Frame your questions intelligently, the 
objective being to find out if the students have grasped the fundamentals of the subject properly. Aim should 
be to determine how much the student knows, rather than how much he does not know.
8.5.1	
Purpose of assessment: 
•	 To test student’s comprehension, knowledge and skills.
•	 To confirm that the student meets the criteria required to be promoted to the next higher class.
•	 To help the student in knowing his deficiencies, and thus facilitate his further learning.
•	 To certify (for the public) that the student has attained certain standard or proficiency in the area of 
his study or skill. This is generally required by the government agencies or prospective employers.

8.5.2	
Types of assessment: 
•	 Oral: Viva-voce exams are generally conducted in the lab, while conducting experiments. It is a 
good way to assess the student in an informal atmosphere. It will also help the student who may 
not be very good in giving his answers in writing. The examiner should be considerate, sensitive 
and should encourage the student to express his answers without inhibitions or nervousness.
•	 Written exam: This may be of ‘multiple choice’ type or ‘free response’ type. If it is multiple 
choice type, generally there will be a time limit within which the student will have to answer a 
given number of questions. There may be negative marks for wrong answers. A teacher should 
be aware of the type of questions/answers appearing in such exams and should train his students 
accordingly. If it is a free response (or essay type) type of exam, the approach in answering 
will be different; here, the requirement is to answer the required number of questions within 
the stipulated time, and the student should be trained to do this.
•	 Practical/lab exams: These are generally conducted in person. However, in some universities, 
there is provision to conduct these exams by audio or video.
8.6	
Evaluation (i.e. marking and grading):
Note the following while evaluating the answer papers:
•	 Have a uniform ‘evaluation criteria’: Evaluation of answer papers must be done objectively. 
For this, have some evaluation criteria, and make it known to all in advance. This will generate 
confidence on the part of students and parents in the evaluation system.
•	 Apply these criteria consistently: Yes, the standards you set for the answers must be met by 
all uniformly, without any exception.
•	 Be honest and impartial: Needless to overstate this. This is your character, integrity, uprightness. 
To be honest and impartial is to be in harmony with your inner voice, your conscience. Don’t 
yield to any pressures or inducements.
•	 ‘Borderline’ cases and ‘second marking’: Have a uniform policy regarding ‘borderline cases’ 
i.e. those who ‘just fail’ by two or three marks, and about ‘second marking’ i.e. revaluation of 
the answer papers. Find out if there is an already established, departmental policy for such 
cases, and if it exists, follow it. Otherwise, formulate one by consulting your seniors.

•	 Be objective: i.e. remember that, after all, your purpose is to find out how much the student has 
understood. And the intention is to use this information to guide and encourage the student 
to improve and do better in the next exam.
•	 Finally, remember that all are not ‘perfect’: i.e. be tolerant of the deficiencies of your students. 
Let your goodwill and blessings flow towards them in an unending stream.
8.7	
Record keeping:
Record keeping has to be done systematically and neatly. This is a laborious work, and perhaps, the most 
disliked one by the teachers. But, let me say that this is an essential and important responsibility of the 
teacher towards his students, their parents and the institution in which he/she works. Nowadays, the 
record keeping involves entering the data and performance of each student into the computer. There 
are specialized software to give you all sort of statistics, once the data are entered. We will be interested 
to analyze the performance of each student, i.e. his attendance record for each subject, marks obtained 
in each subject, comparison of the marks obtained with the class average for that subject, student’s 
progress history from class to class etc. Management of the Institution will be interested to know the 
performance of students, performance of each teacher in each class, teachers’ performance evaluation 
year after year etc. The University (or Board) will require the marks and other data pertaining to each 
student to be filled up in a given format and sent to them. Teacher’s cooperation is essential to meet all 
these requirements within the stipulated time-scale in an academic year. 
To summarize, good record keeping helps you to: 
•	 Get the personal, attendance and performance data of each student, just with a ‘click’ on the 
computer keyboard.
•	 Compare the attendance and performance of any student with others or with respect to the 
overall performance of the class.
•	 Get all statistics about the performance of students in a given subject: i.e. sort from the data: 
highest score, lowest score, no. of students who scored within a given range, say, between 35 
and 50, or, between 50 and 70…etc.
•	 Get all statistics about attendance and performance of any student in any and all subjects.
•	 Get the performance statistics of any teacher with reference to a single class or all classes.
•	 Send the necessary information such as attendance, Internal assessment marks, no. of backlogs 
(i.e. subjects from the previous semester in which the student has failed)…etc. to the University 
authorities.

Giving feed back to students/parents:
After having taught the student, assessing him, and marking and grading him, the teacher is better 
placed to give a feedback on the performance of the student to the student or to his parents or to any 
other concerned authorities. This is an important function of the teacher and should be done honestly 
and with tact. Note the following points in connection with this work:
•	 Give honest, correct and timely feed back to students/parents: Your feedback should be 
correct and honest. It should also be given at the appropriate time, so that, the student gets 
ample time to implement the corrections.
•	 Be polite and considerate to students/parents: A teacher should have good ‘inter personal 
skill’. He should be able to communicate to the student/parents the truth, even if it is bitter, 
politely and with due consideration to their dignity.
•	 Never demoralize the student: Don’t utter any words that demean or denigrate the student 
lest he gets discouraged and demoralized.
•	 Let the student ‘feel’ your goodwill towards him: Let your attitude towards the student as his 
teacher be: ‘Be good and do good’. Think well of him and pray for his success. Your transparent 
sincerity will make the student ‘feel’ your goodwill towards him.
•	 Speak to the parents: You may meet the student and his parent/s together while giving the 
feedback. Students generally don’t like their deficiencies to be highlighted in front of their 
parents. Also, parents will have their own psychology: some may be docile and nervous while 
some others may be aggressive with you. You will need patience and maturity to communicate 
to them in such situations. However, take some time off to meet the parents in private also, 
and enthuse them to encourage the student at home. Essentially, the teacher should make the 
parents realize that the teacher is ‘working with them’ (and not against them) for the overall 
progress of their ward.

Teaching styles:
9	 Teaching styles:
Generally, following five types of teaching styles are identified. You will appreciate that the teaching style 
will vary with each teacher. It depends on the teacher, the student, the level at which the subject is to be 
taught, the circumstances and the purpose.
•	 Expert: Here, the teacher speaks from an ‘expert’ status. He, perhaps, assumes that the student 
already knows sufficiently about the subject, and ‘takes off’ from there. Therefore, student 
should do his home work well before approaching such a teacher.
•	 Authority: Yes, he is an erudite scholar in his subject and teaches with authority. Perhaps, 
there is a tinge of impatience around him; he expects you to accept every thing he says without 
much of questioning!

Teaching styles:
•	 Friendly: Ah, this is the teacher that the students would love to have! He teaches with great 
care and consideration, placing himself in the position of the student. So, he understands 
their difficulties very well. He will solve one problem fully himself before asking the students 
to solve a similar problem. He works with the students not only inside the class room but, 
beyond the class room too. Such a teacher is easily accepted as a genuine ‘friend, philosopher 
and guide’ by the students!
•	 Facilitator: This type of teacher sees his role only as a ‘facilitator’, i.e. he acts only as a channel 
to supply information to students. It is up to the students to ‘make use’ of him. Here, the student 
should show enthusiasm and initiative to get the maximum from his teacher.
•	 Delegator: Here, the teacher may give guidance to the student and tell him what to do, but it 
is entirely up to the student to do all the work. The student will have to periodically approach 
the teacher and report about the progress and enquire about the further steps to be taken.

‘Must’ for new teachers…:
11	 ‘Must’ for new teachers…:
Many people join the teaching profession because they are inspired by their own teachers. They have an 
‘ideal’ in some particular teacher of their own, and try to emulate him/her. So, they prepare the lessons 
very well for their classes, are friendly with all, and try to the best of their capacity to communicate. 
However, in many cases, they do not get that ‘internal satisfaction and joy of teaching’. To find ‘fulfillment’ 
as a teacher, one should know and practise the following:
•	 Be strongly motivated
•	 First and foremost, be knowledgeable in your subject
•	 Involve the students actively
•	 Be energetic, friendly and sympathetic to your students
•	 Get regular feedback on your teaching
•	 Have a sense of humor; don’t laugh at your students, but laugh with them. More importantly, 
have a capacity to laugh at yourself!
•	 Don’t be critical or negative about your students or about your colleagues
•	 Be friendly with your colleagues and have social contact with them
•	 Respect the senior members in the department and seek their guidance in improving your 
teaching skills
•	 Be eager to upgrade your knowledge, capacity and skills by reading, discussions, sitting for 
competitive exams, attending seminars and workshops etc.
•	 Allocate enough time for teaching, study, social, community-service and personal works

‘Must’ for experienced teachers…:
12	 ‘Must’ for experienced 
teachers…:
It is important that an experienced teacher does not become a ‘senile teacher’ or an ‘outdated teacher’! 
‘Experience’ should make him wise. He should consciously avoid the danger of becoming ‘tired and 
negative’ under the ‘load of his experience’. To be able to deal with contemporary subjects and much 
younger students, he should make continuous efforts to upgrade his knowledge and skills. Following 
points are worth noting with reference to experienced teachers:
•	 Be eager to upgrade your knowledge; remember that there is no ‘upper limit’ to knowledge!
•	 Be innovative, learn and try new approaches to teaching
•	 Share and learn by arranging or attending conferences, seminars and workshops
•	 Periodically discuss with your colleagues about their teaching, difficulties faced by them and 
possible solutions
•	 Get regular feedback on your teaching and never hesitate to take corrective action if any 
deficiencies are pointed out
•	 Be friendly and approachable to all students, parents and teaching and non-teaching staff 
members
•	 Be strongly motivated
•	 Know that ‘contentment’ is the greatest wealth, and ‘self satisfaction’ is the greatest 
recognition!

Getting feed-back on teaching:
13	 Getting feedback on teaching:
As already mentioned, getting feedback on teaching is essential for both the new and experienced teachers. 
In fact, a teacher should welcome this feedback. It shows eagerness on his part to know his deficiency 
and a willingness to improve. In addition, the school/college management would also like to know how 
the teacher performs in order to encourage him or advise him. So, getting students’ feedback on the 
performance of the teacher is an essential step in the teaching – learning process.

Getting feed-back on teaching:
Evaluation of teachers can be done in a variety of ways:
•	 Evaluation forms: These forms are devised by respective schools or colleges. They contain a 
questionnaire covering all aspects of the teacher’s performance, such as: academic knowledge, 
preparation of lessons, delivery of lecture, language, interpersonal skills, class control, personal 
qualities…etc. Students have to write Yes/No or put a tick mark, as the case may be, on the 
appropriate grade for each question. Finally, answers given by a student to all questions are 
added up and a final grade is arrived at. Thus, the feedback from all students of the class is 
collected. This information is fed into a computer and the necessary statistics is generated. 
Then, the appropriate authority should analyze the results and inform the teacher concerned. 
Before distributing the feedback forms to students, it is a good idea to tell them the purpose 
of collecting their feedback and instruct them to be objective in answering the questionnaire. 
Also, it is advisable that some teacher who has not taught that class is given the responsibility 
of collecting the feedback forms from that class. 
A typical ‘Students’ feedback form’ and a suggested questionnaire are given in Appendix-I. 
•	 Class committee: Some colleges have class committees who meet, discuss and give their 
feedback on their teachers.
•	 Videotaping: This is a very effective feed back to the teacher. He himself can observe his 
speaking, diction, teaching, clarity, mannerisms, body language and class management. He 
should view it along with his colleagues and superiors and welcome their advice for correction 
at the appropriate stage.
•	 Class interviews: i.e. the students are interviewed by a staff member (not the one who taught 
them) about the teaching of their teachers. Of course, type of questions asked must be of 
general nature, such as: ‘what did you like best?’, or ‘what did you like least?’, or, ‘what are your 
suggestions for improvement?’ etc…Care should be taken not to ask any questions that may 
elicit answers of a personal nature based on students’ personal prejudice.
•	 Exams, written assignments: Of course, the answers given by the students during their regular 
academic exams and assignments certainly reflect on the teaching performance of a teacher. 
However, this will not tell you about his/her personal qualities and interpersonal skills. So, this 
information must be supplemented with data obtained with other methods mentioned above.

Managing ‘teaching stress’:
14	 Managing ‘teaching stress’:
Most of the teachers, whether they are new to the teaching profession or experienced ones, go through 
varying amount of ‘teaching stress’. If a teacher is stressed, it will affect his teaching and interaction 
with the students and colleagues; this will generate some reaction from students or higher authorities, 
which, in turn, may generate further stress in the teacher, and he will be caught in a vicious circle! So, 
this problem of ‘stress’ should be tackled in the early stages of its appearance. Now, let us analyze why 
this stress occurs at all, and then we will be in a better position to tackle it.

Managing ‘teaching stress’:
14.1	
Reasons for teaching stress:
•	 By the students: Yes, this is the first source of stress, particularly for new teachers. As a new 
teacher, you may be very enthusiastic, prepare the lessons extremely well before you go to the 
class, try your best to deliver it effectively…. But, suddenly you find that the class is noisy and 
no one is listening to you! All your enthusiasm is immediately drained out! You are stressed! 
Or, you ask them to submit an assignment on a particular date and no one appears on that 
day! And, you are stressed!
•	 By the parents of students: Parents come to discuss about the performance of their wards. 
You should welcome it. But do not entertain any useless talk or any effort to unduly influence 
you with respect to the exams or results of any student. This requires experience and tact in 
dealing with people, and if you don’t have it, you will be stressed!
•	 By the authorities: General policies of the school or college administration may not be to your 
liking; or, discussions with your authorities with reference to your teaching or personal aspects 
may not be encouraging. Surely, in such cases, you will be subjected to stress!
•	 By the colleagues: Your colleagues may obtain a better reputation than you in front of students 
or authorities. Or, sometimes, if you have a better reputation than them, they may be jealous 
of you and, in rare cases, may indulge in un-worthy acts. Thus, there is a possibility that by 
comparing yourself with your colleagues, you may invite stress!
•	 Self – generated: Yes, this is a good possibility. You may have very high expectations about 
your own performance and, perhaps, you are not able to meet those expectations in reality. 
You may think that you are a failure as a teacher. Brooding over this will generate great stress 
in you. Or, in your moments of weakness, you may ‘imagine’ that your students or colleagues 
are not respecting you, but are mocking at you. This will also generate stress.
14.2	
How to manage this stress?
Did you know that if you spell ‘STRESSED’ backwards, you get ‘DESSERTS’? What does it mean? It simply 
indicates that if you are bold enough and intelligent enough to face the stress and turn it backwards, 
life will be as pleasant as ‘desserts’! Then, why don’t you try the following techniques to face the stress 
and ‘turn it backwards’?

Managing ‘teaching stress’:
1.	 Be assertive: Remember the well known saying: ‘You can’t please all the people all the time!’. 
It is impossible that all the students in the class will appreciate you. Nor need you try to please 
all the students all the time! Be reasonable, but assertive and hold on to your decisions; but, 
do make your decisions after due consideration. Let the ‘inner voice’ be your guide and, truth 
and integrity, your companions.
2.	 Set priorities: In course of your duties, you may be saddled with quite a large number of 
works. There may be usual teaching load, related assignments correction work, exam duties 
and correction of answer papers, additional responsibilities given by superiors like Head of 
Department, attending career improvement courses or programs, participation in organizing 
seminars, other co-curricular activities, extra curricular activities such as sports, annual days 
etc.…Pressure of completing these works will generate stress. Therefore, it is wise think coolly 
to set your priorities and then work to a plan. Make a list of jobs to be done immediately, 
jobs to be finished on time, jobs to be delegated, jobs to be delayed and jobs to be abandoned 
altogether. And, then act.

Managing ‘teaching stress’:
•	 Share your problem: 
Yes, share the problem with someone close to you…may be, with a close relative, friend, 
colleague or higher authority or a counselor. There is a saying: “A problem shared is a 
problem halved”! But, be careful; don’t tell the whole world about your problems…use your 
discrimination! Still, if your problem is not solved, and if it is becoming a mental drag on you, 
do not hesitate to consult a doctor or psychologist.
3.	 Use relaxation techniques: Take some time off to practice a few time tested relaxation 
techniques. Let them be a part of your daily routine. Oft recommended techniques for stress 
reduction are:
1.	 Relaxation of body muscles by Yoga: Practise a few ‘yogic asanas (or postures)’ to relax body 
muscles. This is better done under the guidance of some Yoga teacher. Experts recommend 
specific ‘asanas’ to cure specific conditions, physical or mental. Yogic Asanas should be practiced 
regularly and systematically to obtain maximum benefit. Physical relaxation will cause mental 
relaxation and vice-versa. Further, one can also practice physical and mental relaxation while 
lying down (or, sitting in a comfortable posture) and consciously letting free and relaxing each 
part of the body from head to toe, simultaneously affirming strongly that, that particular part 
of the body is perfectly relaxed.

Managing ‘teaching stress’:
2.	 Do breathing exercises: 
It is observed that our breathing is connected to our mental state, i.e. we breathe deep and slow 
when we are peaceful and our breathing becomes shallow and fast when we are disturbed or 
angry. This is the principle of ‘breathing exercises’ or ‘pranayama’ taught by many Masters. Of 
course, yogic postures, breathing exercises and meditation have to be learnt personally from 
experts; however, it is safe to do deep breathing (i.e. take a deep breath, filling the lungs fully 
and breathe out deeply completely exhaling the air) a few times in the mornings and evenings. 
Time spent for about 10 minutes each in the morning and evening for these exercises will 
be an extremely useful investment throughout your life. It will help you to remain energetic, 
active and focused for the whole day. Don’t consider it as a waste of time; after all, if you are 
starting on a long journey by your car, is it a waste of time to spend a few minutes in filling 
up the petrol tank before you start? No, not at all. Instead, it is an ‘absolute must’ to complete 
your travel and reach the goal.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

3.	 Jyothi meditation: 
i.e. meditation on a candle flame. This is an extremely effective method which not only increases 
the concentration of mind, but also entirely changes the psyche and improves the outlook and 
character of the individual. It is well known that the tendency of the mind is to ‘jump’ from object 
to object. This very nature of the mind is used to increase the concentration of mind! This ancient 
method has been described very nicely in modern times by Sri Sathya Sai Baba, as follows: 
“As regards the technique of meditation, different teachers and trainers give different forms of advice. 
But I shall give you now the most universal and the most effective form. This is the very first step in 
spiritual discipline. At first, set a few minutes every day for meditation, and extend the time as you 
feel the bliss that you get. Let it be in the hours before dawn. This is preferable because the body is 
refreshed after sleep, and the dealings of daytime will not yet have impinged on you. Have a lamp 
or a candle before you with an open, steady, and straight flame. Sit in front of the candle in the lotus 
posture or any other comfortable sitting position. Look on the flame steadily for some time, and 
closing your eyes try to feel the flame inside you between your eyebrows. Let it slide down into the 
lotus of your heart, illuminating the path. When it enters the heart, imagine that the petals of the 
lotus open out by one, bathing every thought, feeling, and emotion in the light and so removing 
darkness from them. There is no space for darkness to hide. The light of the flame becomes wider 
and brighter. Let it pervade your limbs. Now those limbs can never indulge in dark, suspicious, 
and wicked activities; they have become instruments of light and love. As the light reaches up to 
the tongue, falsehood vanishes from it. Let it rise up to the eyes and the ears and destroy all the 
dark desires that infest them and which lead you to perverse sights and childish conversation. Let 
your head be surcharged with light and all wicked thoughts will flee there from. Imagine that the 
light is in you more and more intensely. Let it shine all around you and let it spread from you in 
ever widening circles, taking in your loved ones, your kith and kin, your friends and companions, 
your enemies and rivals, strangers, all living beings, the entire world. Since the light illumines all 
the senses every day so deeply and so systematically, a time will soon come when you can no more 
relish dark and evil sights, yearn for dark and sinister tales, crave for base, harmful, deadening toxic 
food and drink, handle dirty demeaning things, approach places of ill-fame and injury, or frame 
evil designs against anyone at any time. Stay on in that thrill of witnessing the light everywhere. If 
you are adoring God in any form now, try to visualize that form in the all-pervasive light. For Light 
is God; God is Light. Practice this meditation as I have advised regularly every day. At other times 
repeat the name of God (any Name fragrant with any of His many Majesties), always taking care 
to be conscious of His might, mercy, and munificence.”
…from: Sathya Sai Speaks, Vol X (Old edition), pages 348–350.

Managing ‘teaching stress’:
4.	 Think positively: Yes, don’t harbor negative or melancholy thoughts. Focus on your strengths 
and positive points, rather than on your deficiencies and negative points. Affirm to yourself 
with full conviction: ‘I am strong. I can do this. I will be successful!’, and it will so happen.
5.	 Laughter: Yes, laughter is the best medicine! Perhaps, man is the only animal who is blessed 
with the faculty to laugh. And, how rarely he uses this faculty! Take it easy, look at life and 
the unfolding events as an observer and laugh…laugh, not at others, but with others! More 
importantly, learn to laugh at yourself   ! Laugh with abandon, without any inhibitions so that 
your whole body reverberates with laughter and becomes a bundle of joy! Join a ‘laughing club’ 
or, start one in your campus! Surely, laughter is the best medicine to drive away your ‘blues’.
6.	 Keep a pet! Many psychologists have suggested that keeping a pet is a sure way to reduce stress. 
For example, if you have a pet dog, have you seen how joyously he welcomes you when you 
reach home, tired and perhaps, worried, in the evening? Of course, you have to spend some 
time with your pet every day and take care of him well; more importantly, give your love to 
him. You will be amazed to see the way he reciprocates! Play with him, take him for a walk, 
caress or cajole him or simply speak to him. Pets may not be able to speak to you in human 
language, but they do better…they really love you, absolutely!

Teachers and Human Values:
15	 Teachers and Human Values:
This is an important topic that needs due consideration. We, as teachers, are instrumental in training 
and sending thousands of students into the stream of society every year. These are all highly qualified 
engineers, doctors or graduates in some field or other. But, do you find that the ‘quality’ of life in society 
has changed for the better in any way? Look at the news papers: have the number of stories about 
greed, cheating, murders, and violence of man against man, man against woman, man against society, 
or wars of nations against nations reduced in any way? Certainly not. Why is this so? Why is it that the 
induction of thousands of intelligent, highly qualified people every year, is not affecting the society for 
better? Instead, we see that the effect is similar to the addition of muddy waters in to a stream of river, 
making the waters still more muddy and murky. What is lacking in our education system? Friends! Let 
us consider three great examples….

Three great examples…:
Consider the examples of following three great men from history:
Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa: He was a simple, unlettered, rustic priest in a temple in Dakshineshwar 
near Kolkatta. But, the great intellectuals of the day came to him and sat at his feet to listen to his words 
of wisdom.
Sri Ramana Maharshi: He left home ‘in search of his father’ (i.e. God) when he was barely 14 years old 
and performed very hard penance. He was acclaimed as a great saint of his time, in India and abroad. 
He had studied only up to eighth standard, but his teachings on Vedanta and the path of Self-enquiry 
enunciated by him have become a subject matter for many a Ph.D thesis.
Jesus Christ: He was the son of a poor carpenter, had no education worth the name. His life and practical 
teachings on Love, Service and surrender to God have mesmerized human mind and, today more than 
half the globe follows his teachings.

Teachers and Human Values:
Fellow teachers! In all the above three cases, you find that they were not ‘highly educated’ from the present 
day standards. They were not graduates, post graduates or Ph.D’s. Still, they left indelible foot prints on 
the sands of history and effected a profound change in the psyche of humanity. Why? Because….
•	 All of them had something in common…
•	 They personified certain Values
•	 They practised these Values in their lives
•	 They had the courage of their convictions, and did not deviate from them under 
any circumstances
•	 These Values are known as ‘Human Values’…
15.2	
Human Values:
What are Human Values? Some of the human values can easily be enumerated as follows:
Truth, goodness, love, service, charity, friendship, equality, dedication, sympathy, humility, non-violence 
towards all beings, cleanliness, respect for all, helping the poor, old and the sick, giving food and education 
to the needy…etc. You say this instinctively because, you, being a human being yourself, feel in your 
heart that a good human being should have these qualities. It is quite natural.
Sri Sathya Sai Baba has said that all these human values can be grouped under following main categories:
•	 Sathya (Truth)
•	 Dharma (Righteousness)
•	 Shanti (Peace)
•	 Prema (Love), and
•	 Ahimsa (Non-violence)
He has further said: ‘Truth is the highest among these values.  ×ȡÛǔè Ȫ [Ȭ (i.e. there is 
no Dharma greater than adherence to truth). Dharma is born out of Sathya, and from Dharma 
emerges Peace and from Peace emerges Love. Where there is Love, there can be no hatred. One 
who has Love will adhere to Non-violence. Sathya, Dharma, Shanti, Prema and Ahimsa are the five 
cardinal human values. One who practises these human values is a human being in the true sense 
of the term. Even if he lacks one of these, he cannot be called a perfect human being. Therefore, we 
should develop all these five values.’

Teachers and Human Values:
These human qualities are naturally present in the heart of every human being; only thing to be done is 
to make these qualities manifest. That should be the function of education; and, this leads us to ‘Educare’.
15.3	
Education and Educare:
The exercise called ‘education’ is nowadays focused mostly on collecting information and stuffing it inside 
the head, as far as the student is concerned. And, for the educators, it is mostly a business venture! For the 
students, it is a means to earn their livelihood, and for the educator too, it is a means of earning money.
And, consider this saying: ‘Education gives only information, but, it should effect transformation’. Yes, 
a computer can also store lot of information, but will not know how to love a forlorn child or comfort a 
grieving mother. Education should make us upright, law abiding citizens who are at peace with ourselves 
and live in peace and harmony with the society and surroundings.

Teachers and Human Values:
Who is an educated man? It is said: ‘Education confers humility’. So, an educated man is humble, 
knows how little he knows and is in awe about the vast unknown. But, the present day education makes 
a man arrogant and self-centered. 
Educare:
The word ‘Education’ comes from the root ‘Educare’. It means: ‘to elicit’ or ‘to bring out’. To bring out…
what? It is to bring out the latent human values in an individual. So, the real purpose of education is to 
make the latent human values manifest. 
These human values are not to be bought from the market or imported from outside. The very fact that 
you are a human being means that human values are latent in you. However, the degree of manifestation 
of these values is different in different individuals, depending upon the refinement he/she has undergone. 
The purpose of education is to provide the necessary refinement.
Take the example of a wrist watch. The raw steel content of a wrist watch may cost just a few rupees 
only; but, when this steel undergoes refinement and gets converted into a beautiful wrist watch, it will 
cost a few hundreds of rupees. Likewise, purpose of education is to provide the necessary refinement 
and increase the worth of the individual.
Human values are like the perennial underground source of sweet water. It is always present; but, to get 
it, you have to reach down to it by digging a well. Education is the process of digging, so that the latent 
‘sweet’ human values are brought to the surface for the benefit of the individual and the society at large.
Friends! In this noble profession, we have the sacred duty of teaching and training the students who 
are under our care. It is a great responsibility to send out these students as highly responsible, upright, 
refined human beings in to the society, who will take our country to great heights of glory.

Seven C’s for success:
16	 Seven C’s for success:
Teaching is known to be a highly satisfying profession. In our tradition, teacher is held in high esteem 
and is greatly respected. He has a great responsibility in his hands: not only to impart the necessary 
temporal education and skills to the students, useful to earn a living, but also to shape the character of 
his students to manifest the ‘human qualities’ in them and become ‘fine human beings’. Then only he 
can be really satisfied. So, to sum up whatever we have said so far, to be a successful teacher, one should 
have the following:
•	 Clarity: About the goal, path and the means.
•	 Competence: Should have competence in the chosen field.
•	 Constraints: Should be aware of the constraints, both internal and external, and the perseverance 
to persist.
•	 Concentration: i.e. the ability to focus on the task at hand, in spite of disturbances and 
distractions.
•	 Creativity: Collect information from all sources, and use all your resources creatively.
•	 Courage: Have courage of conviction. If truth is taken as the guide, courage will come as your 
companion.
•	 Continuous learning: Remember: A teacher will always remain a student! A wise man knows 
his own ignorance and a knowledgeable man knows how much he does not know. Humility is 
the hallmark of a learned man. So, be humble and say: ‘Let noble thoughts come to us from 
all directions!’

17	 Enjoy a sweet syrup!:
Finally, my friends! Let us end on a sweet note: A teacher really enjoys his teaching; he enjoys the 
company of his students. For him, teaching is not a ‘profession’ to earn money, but, it is considered as a 
sacred duty to shape the citizens and leaders of tomorrow. A teacher should have the following attitude 
to his teaching:
Preparation of sweet syrup:
•	 Class room…is the tumbler
•	 Teacher…is the water 
•	 Students…are like sugar crystals (pure and sweet)
•	 Teaching…is the process of stirring
•	 Joy of teaching and learning…is like drinking the sweet syrup!
May all of us in this ‘noble’, teaching profession always enjoy such a sweet syrup!

Appendix-II
As Chancellor of Sathya Sai University, Swami has spoken to teachers and students on a number of 
occasions. Following directions, given to teachers, are gleaned from such discourses:
•	 Remember: service to students is not only for their sake, but for your sake too.
•	 Don’t be proud imagining that students need you; you need them too
•	 Students rely on you; so, sacrifice what you have for them
•	 If a student has a vice, he only suffers; but, if a teacher has a vice, thousands are polluted
•	 Only a ‘great’ teacher can mould a great student
•	 Those who seek to impart ‘values’ to students must set an example by first practising 
themselves 
•	 Duty of a teacher involves intensive preparation, most effective communication and 
inspiring the students
•	 Duty is best discharged with discipline
•	 Discipline should be enforced with love and understanding
•	 Teach the students three P’s: Purity, Patience and Perseverance
•	 Teachers should not lose their temper; keep emotions under control
•	 Teacher should interact with his colleagues in cordial, loving terms
•	 Let there be harmony in the office, class rooms, dormitories, dining room and play grounds
•	 Never curse your students; always bless them
•	 A teacher must excel in humility, simplicity, morality and integrity, so that education 
results in excellence
•	 Cultivate love for students; but, love should be tempered with discipline
