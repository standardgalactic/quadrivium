CALCULATED BETS
Computers, Gambling, and Mathematical Modeling to Win
This is a book about a gambling system that works. It tells how the author used
computer simulations and mathematical-modeling techniques to predict the
outcome of jai alai matches and bet on them successfully, thus increasing his
initial stake by over 500 percent in one year! His methods can work for anyone;
at the end of the book he tells the best way to watch jai alai and how to bet
on it.
With humor and enthusiasm, Skiena details a life-long fascination with the
computer prediction of sporting events. Along the way, he discusses other
gambling systems, both successful and unsuccessful, for such games as lotto,
roulette, blackjack, and the stock market. Indeed, he shows how his jai alai
system functions like a miniature stock-trading system.
Do you want to learn about program trading systems, the future of Internet
gambling, and the real reason brokerage houses do not offer mutual funds
that invest at racetracks and frontons? How mathematical models are used in
political polling? The difference between correlation and causation? If you are
interested in gambling and mathematics, odds are this is the book for you!
Steven Skiena is Professor of Computer Science at the State University of New
York, Stony Brook. He is the author of two popular books,The Algorithm Design
Manual and the award-winning Computational Discrete Mathematics, a new
edition of which is being published by Cambridge University Press. He is the
recipient of the Ofﬁce of Naval Research (ONR) Young Investigator’s Award and
the Chancellor’s Award for Excellence in Teaching at Stony Brook.

OUTLOOKS
PUBLISHED BY CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS AND
THE MATHEMATICAL ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA
Mathematical content is not conﬁned to mathematics. Eugene Wigner noted
the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the physical sciences. Deep
mathematical structures also exist in areas as diverse as genetics and art, ﬁ-
nance and music. The discovery of these mathematical structures has in turn
inspired new questions within pure mathematics.
In the Outlooks series, the interplay between mathematics and other disci-
plines is explored. Authors reveal mathematical content, limitations, and new
questions arising from this interplay, providing a provocative and novel view
for mathematicians, and for others an advertisement for the mathematical
outlook.

PREFACE
This is a book about predicting the future. It describes my attempt to mas-
ter a small enough corner of the universe to glimpse the events of tomor-
row, today. The degree to which one can do this in my tiny toy domain tells
us something about our potential to foresee larger and more interesting
futures.
Considered less prosaically, this is the story of my 25-year obsession
with predicting the results of jai alai matches in order to bet on them
successfully. As obsessions go, it probably does not rank with yearning
for the love of one you will never have or questing for the freedom of an
oppressed and downtrodden people. But it is my obsession – one that has
ledmedownpathsthatwereunimaginableatthebeginningofthejourney.
This book marks the successful completion of my long quest and gives
me a chance to share what I have learned and experienced. I think the
attentive reader will come to understand the worlds of mathematics, com-
puters, gambling, and sports quite differently after reading this book.
I tell this tale to introduce several things that have long interested me
to a larger audience:
I The joys of jai alai – Jai alai is a spectator sport and gambling forum
that is underappreciated and misunderstood by the public. I’d like to
xi

PREFACE
acquaint a new audience with this fun and exciting game and whet the
interestofcurrentfansbymakingthemmoreawareofwhatdetermines
the outcome of each match. If you stick with me, you will learn the best
way to watch jai alai and bet on it.
I The power of mathematical modeling – Mathematical models govern
our economy and help forecast our weather. They predict who will win
the election and decide whether your mortgage should be granted.
However, the man on the street knows little about what mathematical
models are and how they work. In this book, I use our jai alai system to
explain how mathematical models are designed, built, and validated.
I The mathematics of money – Gambling and mathematics have a long
and interesting history together. I’ll discuss other gambling systems,
both successful and unsuccessful, for such games as lotto, roulette,
blackjack, and the stock market. Indeed, my jai alai system functions
very much as a stock-trading system in miniature. You will learn how
program-trading systems work, the future of Internet gambling, and
the real reason brokerage houses don’t offer mutual funds that invest
at racetracks and frontons.
I The craft of computer programming – For most nonprogrammers, the
ideas behind modern computing systems lie shrouded beneath a thick
mist of buzzwords and technology. These buzzwords give no hint of
the process by which computer programs are made to work or of the
elegance and beauty that underlie the best software. In this book, you
will discover how my students and I built a particularly interesting
computer program. I use our jai alai system to explain to the layperson
such computer science concepts as parsing and random number gen-
eration, why real programmers hate Microsoft, and the true glories of
the Internet.
I The aesthetics of data – Many people don’t like the looks of charts,
graphs, and tables, no matter how many colors they are printed in.
But done right, such data representations can be a thing of
beauty – vehicles driving us to understand the story that the num-
bers are trying to tell. In this book, you will get to see a variety of data
sets presented in several different ways. You will get a ﬁrst-hand look
at how to interrogate numbers and make them talk.
Finally, this is the story of a mild-mannered professor who places
money on the line to test whether his system really works. Do I hit it rich
xii

PREFACE
or end up a tragic, bankrupt ﬁgure? You will have to read to the end to see
how I make out.
My goal has been to produce a book that will be interesting and under-
standable even to those with little background in each of our three main
topics: jai alai, mathematics, and computing. I explain all the jai alai lingo
that I use, and thus you will be able to appreciate what we are doing even
if you have never been to a fronton. If you can understand how mortgage
interest is calculated, you have all of the mathematical background you
need to follow what we are doing. Even if you have never programmed a
computer, you will be able to understand the ideas underlying our system.
Either way, after reading this book you will have a better understanding of
how and why computers are programmed.
Maybe you will even be inspired to try some mathematical modeling
of your own! At the end of this book I suggest some possible projects to get
you started.
I have tried to make this book as fun to read as it was to write. In
particular, I have striven to be in the spirit of Bill James, the popular writer
whose books on baseball go deeply into the essence of the game. He uses
advanced statistical analysis and historical research to unearth hidden
trends and overturn conventional wisdom. One perceptive review notes
that part of the fun in reading his work comes from the spectacle of a
ﬁrst-rate mind wasting itself on baseball. Part of the fun of this book, I
hope, is the spectacle of a second-rate mind wasting itself on jai alai.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
First and foremost, I thank Dario Vlah, Meena Nagarajan, and Roger
Mailler, the three students who labored to build the system described in
this book. Without the efforts of these three musketeers the project could
never have been completed. I hope they enjoyed working with me half as
much as I did with them. I would also like to thank our system admin-
istrators Brian Tria and Anne Kilarjian, who patiently kept our computer
systems up and running, and Gene Stark, who kept the phones ringing.
I would like to thank the management of the following frontons: Dania
Jai-Alai,MilfordJai-Alai,Berenson’sHartfordJai-Alai,andWorldJai-Alaifor
providing me with records of games played at their frontons over the years.
I particularly thank Bob Heussler for permission to use his jai alai action
photographs as well as for his time during our ﬁeld trip to Milford. Thanks
are also due to Dr. Simona Rusnak Schmid, Carl Banks, The New Brunswick
Home News, the Institute for Operations Research, and the Management
Sciences (INFORMS) for permission to use copyrighted materials.
I am grateful to the people at Cambridge University Press, particularly

CHAPTER ONE
THE MAKING OF A GAMBLER
My interest in jai alai began during my parents’ annual escape from the
cold of a New Jersey winter to the promised land of Florida. They stuffed
the kids into a Ford station wagon and drove a thousand miles in 2 days
each way. Florida held many attractions for a kid: the sun and the beach,
Disney World, Grampa, Aunt Fanny, and Uncle Sam. But the biggest draw
came to be the one night each trip when we went to a fronton, or jai alai
stadium, and watched them play.
Mom was the biggest jai alai fan in the family and the real motiva-
tion behind our excursions. We loaded up the station wagon and drove
to the Dania Jai-Alai fronton located midway between Miami and Fort
Lauderdale. In the interests of preserving capital for later investment, my
father carefully avoided the valet parking in favor of the do-it-yourself
lot. We followed a trail of palm trees past the cashiers’ windows into the
fronton.
Walking into the fronton was an exciting experience. The playing court
sat in a vast open space, three stories tall, surrounded by several tiers of
stadium seating. To my eyes, at least, this was big-league, big-time sport.
Particularly “cool” was the sign saying that no minors would be admit-
ted without a parent. This was a very big deal when I was only 12 years
old.

We followed the usher who led us to our seats. The ﬁrst game had
already started. We watched as the server spun like a top and hurled the
goathide sphere to the green granite wall, where it rocketed off with a
satisfying thunk. His opponent climbed up the sidewall to catch the ball in
his basket, or cesta, and then – with one smooth motion – slung it back to
whence it came. The crowd alternated between ooh and ah as the players
caught and released the ball. The players barked orders to their partners in
a foreign tongue, positioning each other across the almost football–ﬁeld-
sized court. Thunk, thunk, thunk went the volley until a well-placed ball
ﬁnally eluded its defender.
After each point, the losing side would creep off the court in shame re-
placed by another team from the queue. The action would then resume . . .
thunk, thunk, thunk . . . .
You have to visit a jai alai fronton to really appreciate the sights and
sounds of the crowd. Most of the spectators, at least the most vocal ones,
don’t seem terribly knowledgeable about the players or game. Indeed,
many are tourists or retired people who wouldn’t recognize a pelotari,
or jai alai player, if they woke up in bed with one. There is only one player
they are interested in: themselves. The spectators have money riding on
each and every point and are primarily concerned about the performance
of their investment:
“You stink, red.”
“Drop it, number 5.”
“Just one more point, Laxi – uh, whatever your name is.”
Occasionally a more knowledgeable voice, usually with a Spanish ac-
cent, would salute a subtle play: “Chula! Chula!”.
Thereallyneatthingaboutjaialaiisthateventshappenindiscretesteps
instead of as a continuous ﬂow, and thus the game is more like tennis than
basketball or horse racing. After watching a few games, I began to get the
hang of the scoring system. The pause between each point gives you time
to think about how the game is shaping up and what the prospects for your
bet currently are. Sometimes you can look ahead and ﬁgure out an exact
sequence of events that will take you to victory. “Look, if 1 beats 5 on this
point, then loses to 7, and then 4 wins its next two points, the game ends
4–2–1 and I win!”
With each point, the loyalties of the crowd change rapidly. A wonderful
aspect of the jai alai scoring system is that the dynamics of the game can
2

THE MAKING OF A GAMBLER
change almost instantaneously. In baseball, you can be 12 runs ahead, and
thus giving up one run costs you absolutely nothing. This is not so in jai
alai. No matter how far ahead you are, the loss of a single point can kill by
forcing you to sit down to watch your opponent win the match. Suddenly
a team given up for dead trots back on the court, and then it becomes a
whole new game.
Fan loyalty is particularly ﬂeeting because it is often the case that a
bettor now needs to defeat the same player he or she was rooting for on
the previous point.
“You stink, blue.”
“Drop it, number 6.”
“You’re my main man, Sourball. I mean Sor-ze-ball.”
After we got settled into our seats, my father gave me, the oldest of the
three kids, a pair of rumpled one-dollar bills. It was enough for one bet
over the course of the evening. “Use it wisely,” he said.
But what did wisely mean? On his way into the fronton, my father had
invested 50 cents on a Pepe’s Green Card. Pepe’s Green Card was a one-page
tout sheet printed on green cardboard. I was much too young to catch any
allusion to Pepe’s immigration status in the title. For each of the games
played that evening, Pepe predicted who would ﬁnish ﬁrst, second, and
third alongside a cryptic comment about each player such as “wants to
win,” “tough under pressure,” or “in the money.”
On the top of the card, in a box on the right-hand side, Pepe listed his
single “best bet” for the evening. That night, Pepe liked a 4–2–1 trifecta in
the sixth match.
My brothers and I studied this strange document carefully. We liked
the idea of a tout sheet. It would help us spend our money wisely. As kids,
we were used to being told what to do. Why should it be any different when
we were gambling?
“Boy, this is great. Pepe must really know his stuff,” I said.
My brother Len agreed. “You bet! We’ve got nothing but winners here.”
“Dad, why do other people pick their own numbers when Pepe has all
the winners here?” asked Rob, the youngest.
“Pepe, my pupik!” came my parental voice of authority. “Pepe wouldn’t
know a winner if he stepped on one.”
“Look, Pepe gives a best bet. A 4–2–1 trifecta in the sixth match. It can’t
possibly lose.”
3

My father shook his head sadly. “Trifectas are the longest shots of all,
the toughest bet one can make in jai alai. You have almost no chance of
winning. Why don’t you bet on something that gives you a better chance
to win?”
In retrospect, it is clear that my father was right. To win a trifecta, you
must identify the players who will come in ﬁrst, second, and third – all
in the correct order. There are 8 × 7 × 6 = 336 possible trifectas to bet on,
only one of which can occur in any given game.
But we trusted Pepe. And besides, it was now our money. Eventually,
we convinced our father to trade in our 2 dollars for a 4–2–1 trifecta ticket
on Game 6.
We waited patiently for our chosen moment.
At last the public address announcer informed us it was one minute
to post time for Game 6. Last-minute bettors scrambled to the cashiers to
the accompaniment of the betting clock: tick, tick, tick, tick.
The chosen game proved to be a doubles match. Eight pairs of men,
each pair wearing a numbered jersey of a prescribed color, marched out to
ceremonial bull-ﬁghting music: the “March of the Toreadors.” They gave
the crowd a synchronized, if half-hearted, wave of the cesta, and all but
the ﬁrst two teams straggled back to the bench.
Thebettingclockcompleteditscountdown,whichwasterminatedbya

and the ﬁrst player bounced the ball and served. The game was on.
We cheered for team 2, at least until they played team 4. We switched
our allegiance to team 4 up until the moment it looked like they would get
too many points and win without 2 and 1 in their designated positions.
We booed any other team with a high score because their success would
interfere with the chances of our favorites.
We watched in fascination as player 2 held onto ﬁrst place, while player
1 slid into a distant but perfectly satisfactory second-place position. When
player 4 marched on the court for the second time, my mother noticed
what was happening. “My G-d, only two more points and the kids win!”
This revelation only made us cheer louder. “Green! Green! Green!,” I
yelled.
“Four! Four! Four!,” my brothers chimed in.
Player 4 got the point, leaving us only one point shy of the big payoff.
The designated representative from team 4 served the ball.

THE MAKING OF A GAMBLER
We followed up with the play-by-play: “Miss it, ooh. No, catch it! Ah!
Miss it, ooh. No, catch it! Ah! Miss it . . . .”
He missed it!
Family pandemonium broke out as we waited the few moments it took
for the game to become ofﬁcial. Our trifecta paid us $124.60 for a 2-dollar
bet – an incomprehensibly large amount of money to a bunch of kids. The
public address announcer, in shock, informed all in the house that Pepe’s
Green Card had picked the winning trifecta in the previous game. Mom
told all in earshot that her kids had won the big one. Dad sauntered up
to the cashier to collect our winnings for us, kids being forbidden from
entering the betting area by state law.
We kids took the family out to dinner the next night. We experienced
the thrill of being the breadwinner, hunters returning from the kill. It was
indeed fun being a winner – so much fun that I starting wondering how
Pepe did it. It was clear that most people in the crowd didn’t understand
what was going on at the fronton, but Pepe did. Maybe I could ﬁgure it out,
too.
An old gambling axiom states that luck is good, but brains are better.
Indeed, it took me almost 25 years, but ﬁnally I have ﬁgured it out. Let me
tell you how I did it . . . .

CHAPTER TWO
WHAT IS JAI ALAI?
Jai alai is a sport of Basque origin in which opposing players or teams
alternate hurling a ball against the wall and catching it until one of them
ﬁnallymissesandlosesthepoint.Thethrowingandcatchingaredonewith
an enlarged basket or cesta. The ball or pelota is made of goatskin and hard
rubber, and the wall is of granite or concrete – which is a combination that
leads to fast and exciting action. Jai alai is a popular spectator sport in
Europe and the Americas. In the United States, it is most associated with
the states of Florida, Connecticut, and Rhode Island, which permit pari-
mutuel wagering on the sport.
In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the history and culture of jai
alai. From the standpoint purely crass of winning money through gam-
bling, much of this material is not strictly necessary, but a little history
and culture never hurt anybody. Be my guest if you want to skip ahead
to the more mercenary or technical parts of the book, but don’t neglect
to review the basic types of bets in jai alai and the Spectacular Seven
scoring system. Understanding the implications of the scoring system
is perhaps the single most important factor in successful jai alai
wagering.
Much of this background material has been lifted from the fronton

particularly urge readers interested in more background to explore
Websites such as www.jaialai.com or my own www.jai-tech.com.
How the Game Is Played
The term jai alai comes from the Basque word meaning “merry festi-
val.” In the English vernacular this is sometimes spelled as it sounds,
that is, “hi-li,” although the use of the corrupted spelling seems to be
fading.
In the Basque provinces of Spain and France, where jai alai began,
the sport is known as cesta punta. Cesta punta is a traditional part of
Basque festivals, which accounts for the connection. The Spanish call the
game pelota vasca (Basque ball). Whatever the game itself is called, jai
alai has a lingo associated with its equipment and strategy that we detail
below.
EQUIPMENT
Jai alai is best viewed as a variant of handball in which two sets of players
(or pelotaris) alternate throwing the ball against the wall and catching
the rebound. The most important pieces of equipment, therefore, are the
hand, the ball, and the wall:

CALCULATED BETS
A return from backcourt.
I The cesta – Basques played early forms of jai alai with bare hands and
then with leather gloves and wooden paddles until the cesta was in-
troduced. Some credit Melchoir Curachaque with inventing the cesta
after breaking his wrist in Buenos Aires in 1888. Another story gives the
patent to a young French Basque who tried hurling the ball with his
mother’s curved wicker basket.
Either way, the word cesta is Spanish for basket. Every cesta is
handmade to the player’s speciﬁc requirements and constructed by
interweaving thin reeds found exclusively in the Pyrenees Mountains
through a frame of Spanish chestnut. The life of a typical cesta is only
about 3 weeks. Cestas cost about $300 each, and a professional player
goes through about 15 of them per year. Like cigars, cestas are stored
in humidors to prevent them from getting too dry and brittle.
I The pelota – Named after the Spanish word for ball, the pelota is slightly
smaller than a baseball and harder than a rock. The ball’s liveliness
comes from its virgin rubber core, which is signiﬁcantly larger than
the equivalent core of a baseball. This core is covered by one
layer of nylon and two outer layers of goat skin. The stitches on the
8

WHAT IS JAI ALAI?
pelota are embedded so as to minimize damage when it slams into the
cesta.
Each pelota has a court life of only 20 minutes or so before the
cover splits owing to the punishment it takes hitting the wall during
play. These pelotas, which are made by hand at a cost of about $150,
are then recycled by sewing on new covers and subsequently aged or
“rested” for at least one month in order to regain full liveliness.
Pelotas in play have been clocked at over 180 miles per hour, which
is twice the speed of a major league fast ball. The combination of hard
mass and high velocity makes it a very bad idea to get in the way of a
moving pelota.
Pelota is also used as the name for a sport with religious overtones
played by the ancient Aztecs. Those guys took their games very seri-
ously, for the losing team was often put up as a human sacriﬁce. Such
policies presumably induced greater effort from the players than is
seen today even at the best frontons, although modern jai alai players
are able to accumulate more experience than their Aztec forebears.
I The Court – The most interesting part of the playing court is the granite
front wall, which makes a very satisfying clicking sound whenever a
pelota hits it at high speed. At Milford Jai-Alai in Connecticut, this front
wall is 34-feet high and35-feetwideandismadeof8-inch-thickgranite
blocks.

CALCULATED BETS
The court (or cancha) can be thought of as a concrete box with one
of the long sides of the box removed. A wooden border (the contra-
cancha) extends out 15 feet on the ﬂoor outside this box. The pelota
makes an unsatisfying thwack sound whenever it hits the wood, signal-
ing that the ball is out of bounds. A wire screen prevents pelotas from
leaving the court and killing the spectators, thus signiﬁcantly reducing
the liability insurance frontons need to carry. At Milford, the court is
178 feet long, 50 feet wide, and 46 feet tall. Although courts come in
different sizes, players stick to one fronton for an entire season, which
gives them time to adjust to local conditions.
The numbers from 1 to 15 are painted along the back walls of the
court. The front court is the region near the small numbers, and the
back court is near the big numbers. The lines marked 4, 7, and 11
designate the underserve, overserve, and serve lines, respectively. The
rest of the numbers function, like pin markers in bowling, that is, only
as reference points to help the players ﬁnd where they are on the
court.
STRATEGY
The rules of jai alai are quite similar to those of tennis and racquetball. In
all of these sports, the goal is to accumulate points by making the other
side misplay the ball.
All games begin with a serve that must land between the 4 and 7 lines
of the court. The receiving player must catch the pelota in the air or on the
ﬁrst bounce and then return it to the front wall in one continuous motion.
It is illegal for the player to stop the pelota’s motion or to juggle it. The
players continue to volley until the pelota is missed or goes out of bounds.
Three judges, or referees, enforce the rules of play.
An aspect of strategy peculiar to jai alai is that the server gets to choose
which ball is to be used. At each point, he may select either a lively ball,
averageball,oradeadball – allofwhichareavailablewhenheserves.Once
the server has chosen a ball, the receiving team may inspect his choice for
rips or tears and has the right to refuse the ball should they ﬁnd it to be
damaged in any way.
Jaialaimatchesareeithersinglesordoublesmatches.Doublesaremore
common and, in my opinion, far more interesting. The court is simply too

10

WHAT IS JAI ALAI?
being an effective player is correctly judging whether it will be easier to
catch the ball as it ﬂies directly off the frontwall or to wait for the rebound
off the back wall. Doubles players specialize as either frontcourters or
backcourters, depending upon where they are stationed. Frontcourters
must be faster than the backcourters because they have more ground to
coverandlesstimetoreact,whereasbackcourtsmenrequirestrongerarms
to heave the pelota the full length of the court.
Understanding the court geometry is essential to appreciate the im-
portance of shot placement. Although the ball does spin and curve, jai alai
players rely more on raw power and placement than English1 to beat their
opponents. The following are the most interesting shots :
I Chic-chac – In this shot, the ball ﬁrst hits the ﬂoor of the court close
to where the ﬂoor meets the back wall and then bounces up, hits the
back wall, and comes out with little or no bounce. If one is placed close
enough to the crack in the wall, it becomes a . . .

frontcourt
I Chula – Pronounced choo-la, this is everybody’s favorite thing to yell
at a jai alai match. You will hear cries of chula every time it looks like
the ball will get wedged into the crack between the back wall and ﬂoor.
The ESPN SportsCenter anchor Kenny Mayne shouts chula whenever
a baseball batter bounces a line drive low off the outﬁeld wall.
I Rebote – An attempted return after the ball bounces off the backwall.
The proper technique is to dive head ﬁrst towards the wall, scoop
up the ball, and then ﬂing it forward from the prone position. The

goes to the end of the line as the winner keeps playing. Having eight teams
in any given match greatly enlivens the space of betting possibilities. The
composition of the teams and post (starting) positions assigned to each
player changes in each match. To help the fans (and possibly the players)
keep everything straight, regulations require that the shirt colors for each
post position be the same at all frontons. In Florida, the shirt colors for
each post position are as follows:

Because each player needs jerseys with his uniform number in each
of these eight colors, laundry (and, as we will see, fairness) considerations
dictate that no player appear in a particular position too often each night.
History of the Game
Tracking down deﬁnitive information on the history of jai alai posed more
difﬁculties than I might have imagined. The best book on jai alai’s early
history appears to be Blazy’s La Pelote Basque from 1929, whose neat old
photos and line drawings lose none of their charm even though the book
was written in French. Similarly, the deﬁnitive Historia de la Pelota Vasca
en Las Americas is written in Spanish.
Unfortunately,ifIwereapelotari,mynicknamewouldbeMonolingual.
Therefore, most of the history reported below comes from less authorita-
tive sources. Some cite legends that jai alai was invented by Saint Ignatius
of Loyola, a Basque. Others sources trace the origins of the game even ear-
lier to Adam and Eve. These same legends assure us that they spoke to each
other in Basque.
THE BASQUES
About three million Basques live in their green and beautiful homeland in
the Pyrenees Mountains. The land of the Basques (called Eskual Herria in
theBasquelanguage)straddlestheborderofFranceandSpain,comprising
three French and four Spanish provinces. The Basques are a distinctive
people with several unique characteristics:
I Language – Basque is apparently the only Western European language
that does not belong to the Indo–European family of languages. Writ-
ten Basque is as strange-looking as the language is strange-sounding,
featuring an extraordinary number of x’s and an apparent disregard for
vowels.TheBasquesrefertothemselvesasEuskaldunakor“speakersof
the Euzkara.” Contemporary theories suggest that Basques may have
descended from early Iberian tribes, and this language presumably
came with them.
Legend states the Devil tried to learn Basque by listening behind
the door of a Basque farmhouse. After 7 years, he mastered only two
14

WHAT IS JAI ALAI?
words: “Yes, Ma’am.” This, say the Basques, is a tribute to their women
as well as the difﬁculty of their tongue.
I Blood – Blood-type frequencies cement the Basque’s claims of ethnic
uniqueness. They have the world’s highest frequency of type O and RH
negative blood. The Basques clearly are a people who did not mingle
with outsiders.
I Toughness – The Basques are a tough people with a strong determi-
nation to preserve their national character. They defended themselves
against the Phoenicians, the Greeks, the Romans, and the Visigoths.
The Basques wiped out half of Emperor Charlemagne’s rear guard at
the battle of the Pass of Roncesvalles. Guernica was a Basque village
leveledintheSpanishCivilWarandmadefamousbyPicasso’spainting;
now it is the home of the largest fronton on Europe.
The Basque love of freedom continues today. For over 30 years, the
terrorist group ETA (Euskadi ta Askatasuna, which is translated as “Basque
Homeland and Liberty”) has been ﬁghting Spain to win the independence
of the Basque region, killing some 800 people in the process. More recently,
the spectacular new Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao has put the Basque
region on the map for something other than jai alai or terrorist activities.
Indeed, the Basque region of Spain and France is a terriﬁc place to
spend a vacation. A one-week trip could combine the unique architecture
of Bilbao with the spectacular beaches of San Sebastian. You can drive
winding cliff roads along an unspoiled rocky coast, stopping to eat fresh
seafood and tapas, the little plates of savory appetizers that have spread
throughout Spain but originated in the Basque country. You can stop in
nearby Pamplona to see the running of the bulls made famous by Hem-
ingway. And, of course, you can watch the ﬁnest jai alai in the world.
JAI ALAI IN THE BASQUE COUNTRY
The ﬁrst thing to know is that at least four types of pelota are played pro-
fessionally in the Basque country, and you will see all of them if you spend
enough time watching Basque television. They differ primarily in the im-
plement used to hit the ball:
I Cesta punta – This is the variation of pelota that has come to the United
States as jai alai and uses a long, curved basket (cesta) for catching and
throwing the ball.
15

CALCULATED BETS
I Remonte – This is the most challenging variation of the sport and uses
a smaller, shallower basket than the cesta. Players are not permitted to
catch the ball but must hit it back immediately. The result is an even
quicker game than cesta punta that is a lot of fun to watch.
I Mano – Spanish for “hand,” mano is just that – handball. Played on
a smaller court than cesta punta, it remains a fast-moving game with
serves that can reach speeds of over 60 miles per hour.
I Pala – The players whack the ball with small, ﬂat-sided wooden clubs.
Pala is more popular among amateur players because these clubs
are considerably cheaper than baskets. Still, it amazes me that any-
one succeeds in hitting a fast-moving ball with these foot-long
clubs.
The Spectacular Seven scoring system is in use primarily in the United
States.MuchmorecommoninFranceandSpainarepartidos,inwhichtwo
teams (red and blue) play to a designated number of points, usually 35 or
40. The ﬁrst player to get, say, 35 points wins the match. All championship
matches are partidos. Such matches can take hours to play, just like tennis
matches.
In partido betting, spectators are encouraged to bet even after the
game has begun. This system is quite interesting. A bookmaker sits in
the center of the room, updating the odds in a computer after each point
is played. The latest odds are immediately displayed on the scoreboard.
The cashiers face the spectators with their own computer screens and a
load of tennis balls. Any fan interested in placing a bet yells (in Basque)
for the cashier to throw him or her a tennis ball, which contains a slot in
which to deposit money. The fan touches his or her cheek to bet on red,
or arm to bet on blue. The cashier processes this signal and the enclosed
cash and returns a tennis ball with a ticket indicating the bet amount and
current odds.
Settingtherightoddsateachpointinthematchpresentsaconsiderable
challenge for the bookmaker. To make its money, the house shaves 16% off
of all bets. The system is sufﬁciently complicated that I was discouraged
from betting when I attended a match in Pamplona, which is a friendly
gesture towards inexperience you won’t see in any casino.
The ﬁrst indoor fronton was built in 1798 in Markina, Spain. Not long
after this, the great Spanish painter Goya designed a tapestry called the
“Gameof Pelota”thatnowhangsintheEscorialPalacenearMadrid.Today,
16

WHAT IS JAI ALAI?
professional jai alai can be watched in Spain at frontons in Pamplona
(Huarte), San Sebastian, and Guernica. In France, the premier fronton is
in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, a lovely village near the sea.
Basque players dominate world jai alai. Of the 48 players on the 1998
Milford Jai-Alai roster, 30 list their nationality as Spanish Basque and 4
more as French Basque. The close-knit Basque player’s association has
been credited with helping to preserve the integrity of the sport by rig-
orously policing itself. This association eventually evolved into the Inter-
national Jai-Alai Players Association (www.ijapa.com), which is a union
afﬁliated with the United Auto Workers.
Jai alai has been played whereever Basques have lived. Before World
War II, jai alai was played in Havana and such exotic places as Shanghai
and Tientsin, China. The Havana fronton was one of the best in the world
before Castro outlawed the sport in the late 1950s. At least until recently,
jai alai was played professionally in Italy, the Philippines, Macao, and
Indonesia.
Jai alai achieved international recognition when it was played in the
1992 Barcelona Olympic Games as a demonstration sport.
JAI ALAI IN THE UNITED STATES
Jai alai was introduced in the United States in 1904 at the Saint Louis
World’s Fair, which, if I recall correctly, was also where the ice-cream cone
was ﬁrst unveiled to a hungry populace. The sport caught on to such an
extent that America’s ﬁrst permanent jai alai fronton was built in 1924 on
what is now the parking lot of Hialeah racetrack in Miami, Florida. It was
almost immediately destroyed in a hurricane but then quickly rebuilt. Ten
years later, in 1934, wagering on jai alai was legalized in Florida. Today,
jai alai contributes an estimated $200 million per year in total economic
revenues to the Florida economy.
After the Basques, Americans constitute the largest population of pro-
fessional jai alai players. Many of these players learned the sport at a
long-standing amateur facility in North Miami or the more recent am-
ateur fronton at Milford, Connecticut. Jai alai underwent a big boom in
the mid-1970s. At its peak in 1978, there were 10 frontons in Florida, 3 in
Connecticut, 2 in Nevada, and 1 in Rhode Island. Referenda to expand the
sport to New Jersey and California failed by narrow margins, but further
growth seemed inevitable.

However, the jai alai industry today is not what it used to be. The ﬁrst
problem was the long and nasty players strike, which lasted 3 years start-
ing in 1988 and left serious wounds behind. Proclaimed “one of the biggest
messes in U.S. labor history” (Balfour 1990), it directly involved
the International Jai Alai Players Association, eight different employ-
ers in three different states, the National Labor Relations Board, two
other federal agencies, three state agencies, federal courts, state courts,
immigration restrictions and threatened deportations, state licensing
procedures, yellow dog contracts, a secondary boycott by employers
in Spain, Basque machismo, the governor of Florida, and the United
Automobile Workers.
The strike poisoned relationships between the players and the frontons,
signiﬁcantly lowered the quality of play through the use of underskilled
scab players, and greatly disenchanted the fans. It was a lose–lose situa-
tion for all concerned.

businesses, like baseball teams, which, counting players, coaches, betting
clerks, vendors, and support staff, can each employ several hundred peo-

I Dania Jai-Alai – Dania opened in 1953 as the second jai alai fronton in
the United States. The fronton seats 5600 people and claims an annual
attendance of over 650,000. Dania’s fortunes have risen recently when
the state of Florida permitted this fronton to add a poker room that
operates concurrently with the jai alai matches. Address: 301 East Da-

Mexico’s most prominent fronton is the Tijuana Jai-Alai Palace, which
opened in 1947. More recently, frontons have opened and closed in
Acapulco and Cancun.
The jai alai palace is the classiest structure on Revolucion Avenue in
the tourist part of Tijuana. In front of the fronton, a statue of a pelotari
with his cesta aloft strides the world. Alas, no gambling is allowed at
the matches played Friday and Saturday nights in the Jai-Alai Palace, al-
though there is a betting parlor next door that simulcasts games from
Miami. There are much easier ways to lose your money in Tijuana – eas-
ier but ultimately less satisfying than jai alai. Address: 1100 Revolucion

to adopt a one-word player name such as Pele. Many players use their
actual ﬁrst or last name. The Basques often use shortened versions of
their last names, which can approach 20 letters in their full glory. Other
players choose their mother’s maiden name, while some take the name of
their home town. Brothers or children of established players often ap-
pend a number to their mentor’s name becoming, say, Javier II. Naturally,
players prefer the fans to call them by name rather than uniform color or
number.
There are stars in jai alai as there are in every sport. Many old timers
consider Erdorza Menor to be the best player of all time. Perhaps the best
American player was Joey Cornblit, known as Joey, who was a star for many
years beginning in the early 1970s. Capturing the international essence of

As in baseball, many of the best players throw hard. The Guinness
Book of World Records credits Jose Ramon Areitio with throwing the fastest
ball ever. His pelota was clocked at 188 mph on Friday, August 3, 1979, at
Newport Jai-Alai. This is almost twice the speed of a top-notch fast ball.
Numbers like these support the claim that jai alai is the world’s fastest ball
game. Fortunately, the playing court is long enough to enable players and
fans to follow the action.

have been killed by a jai alai ball. The only U.S. fatality occurred during
the early 1930s at the old Biscayne fronton when the frontcourter Ramos
was struck in the back of the head by his partner. He died a few days later.
In 1967, a champion player named Orbea was hit in the head, and he lay
in a coma for weeks. Ultimately he recovered, eventually becoming the
player-manager at Dania and Milford jai alai. Still, this incident forced the
introduction of helmets because the traditional Basque head gear (red or
blue berets) didn’t do much to stop a pelota. Fortunately, there have been
few instances of serious head injuries ever since.
Legend recounts at least one instance of the pelota being used for self-
defense. Perkain was a champion player who ﬂed to Spain to escape the
guillotine during the French Revolution. Still, he could not resist returning
to France to defend his title against a French challenger. When threat-
ened with arrest, he succeeded in making his escape by beaning the law
enforcement ofﬁcial with the ball. Chula!
Jai alai players come in all shapes and sizes. The players on the 1998
Milford roster ranged in height from 5 feet 6 inches to 6 feet 3 inches and
in weight from 140 to 220 pounds. Frontcourt players are typically shorter
and quicker, for they must react to balls coming at them directly off the
frontwall. Backcourt players must be stronger and more acrobatic to en-
able them to dive for odd bounces yet recover to toss the ball the length
of a football ﬁeld in one smooth motion. It is not that unusual to see play-
ers sporting substantial bellies, but appearances can be deceiving. These
are highly skilled, conditioned athletes. According to pedometer studies,
each player runs about one mile per game, and each player typically ap-
pears in four to six games per night, ﬁve nights per week. As in tennis, the
players must be versatile enough to play both offense and defense. The
sport is not as easy as it looks. Babe Ruth once tried a few shots, failing
even to hit the frontwall before he concluded that the cesta was “not my
racket.”
Pelotaris can have long careers. Three of the members of the 1998
Milford roster (including Alfonso, shown in the ﬁgure on the page 22) have
played at Milford since at least 1982. As in baseball, professional players
range in age from less than 20 to over 40. Both youth and experience have
their advantages on the court.
Not all players have such long careers, of course. I recently read an arti-
cle in The Jewish Week about the Barry sisters, famous stars of the Yiddish
24

WHAT IS JAI ALAI?
stage. The granddaughter of Claire Barry, one of the sisters, recently mar-
ried a professional jai alai player named Bryan Robbins. This newspaper
account identiﬁes Bryan as a “nice Jewish boy” and notes approvingly that
he has ended his jai alai career to become a medical student.
The open wall of the court results in an asymmetry that makes it
very undesirable to have the cesta on the left hand. Therefore, all pro-
fessionals today are right-handed, or at least use that hand for playing
jai alai. There have been exceptions, however. Marco de Villabona man-
aged to be a competitive player after losing his right arm. A nineteenth-
century player named Chiquito de Eibar was such a dominant player that
he was sometimes required to play with the basket on his left hand as a
handicap.
Jai alai is a male sport, although a few women have played the game on
an amateur level. Perhaps the best-known amateur player was Katherine
Herrington back in the 1940s, who went on to write a book on the sport
after playing her last exhibition at Saint-Jean-de-Luz, France, in 1971. The
legendary Tita of Cambo, a French Basque, was reputedly so strong that
her serves damaged stone walls.
BETTING ON JAI ALAI
Much of the excitement of attending a jai alai match comes from be-
ing able to bet on your favorite player or outcome. Indeed, jai alai has
been called “a lottery with seats.” Each fronton supports a variety of dif-
ferent types of bets, some of which are fairly exotic, but the most pop-
ular bets are listed below. These terms should be familiar to anyone ac-
quaintedwithhorseracing,andwewillusethemthroughouttherestofthe
book.
I Win – You bet that your team (or player) will win the game. There are
eight possible win bets at a standard fronton.
I Place–Youbetthatyourteam(orplayer)willﬁnisheitherﬁrstorsecond
inthegame.Youwillreceivethesamepayoffregardlessofwhetheryour
team is ﬁrst or second. This is a less risky bet than picking a team to
win, but the payoff is usually less as well. There are eight possible place
bets at a standard fronton.
I Show – You bet that your team (or player) will ﬁnish either ﬁrst,
second, or third. This is the least risky and hence lowest-paying wager
25

CALCULATED BETS
available at most frontons. There are eight possible show bets at a
standard fronton.
I Quiniela – You pick two teams to ﬁnish ﬁrst and second. The order in
which your two teams ﬁnish is irrelevant – so long as they ﬁnish 1 and
2 you receive the quiniela price. Quiniela comes from the Basque word
for ‘twin,’ but this type of bet has spread beyond jai alai to other pari-
mutuel sports as well. Personally, I ﬁnd the quiniela bet to be the single
most exciting choice for the spectator because it seems one always has
a chance to win at some point in the match. There are (8 × 7)/2 = 28
possible quiniela bets at a standard fronton.
I Exacta or Perfecta – You pick two teams to ﬁnish ﬁrst and second in that
given order. If you pick a 2–6 exacta, it means that 2 must win and 6
must come in second. In olden times, this used to be called a “correcta”
bet. There are (8 × 7) = 56 possible exacta bets at a standard fronton,
which is twice that of the quiniela.
I Trifecta – You pick the three teams (or players) that ﬁnish ﬁrst, second,
and third in that exact order. If you play a 2–5–3 trifecta, then 2 must
win, 5 must ﬁnish second (place), and 3 must come in third (show).
There are 8 × 7 × 6 = 336 possible trifecta bets at a standard fronton.
Trifectas are the riskiest conventional bet, but the one that typically
pays the highest returns.
Different frontons operate under slightly different betting rules. One
aspect that varies is the size of the minimum bet allowed. Dania Jai-Alai
currently has a $2.00 minimum bet, whereas Milford has a $3.00 minimum
bet. Frontons tend not to have maximum bet limits because those are
imposed by common sense. As will be discussed in Chapter 6, jai alai is
a pari-mutuel sport, and thus you are trying to win money from other
people, not from the house. No matter how much you invest, you can’t win
more money than other people have bet. We will discuss this issue more
deeply later on, but as a rule of thumb there is probably from $5,000 to
$15,000 bet on any given jai alai match.
Any bettor is free to make any combination of these types of bets on
any given match. Indeed, frontons provide certain types of aggregate bets
as a convenience to their customers.
I Boxing–Bettingallpossiblecombinationsofagivensubsetofnumbers.
For example, a 1–2–3 trifecta box bets on all six possible trifectas, which

can be built using those three numbers: 1–2–3, 1–3–2, 2–1–3, 2–3–1, 3–
1–2,and3–2–1.Orderingaboxcansimplybeaconvenience,butcertain
frontons allow one to bet a trifecta box at a cost that works out to less
than the minimum bet per combination. Indeed, we will exploit this
freedom with our own betting strategy.
I Wheeling – Betting a ﬁxed set of numbers with all other numbers
used for the remaining slots. For example, a 1–2 trifecta wheel de-
ﬁnes bets on the following six trifectas: 1–2–3, 1–2–4, 1–2–5, 1–2–6,
1–2–7, and 1–2–8. Certain venues presumably allow one to bet a tri-
fecta wheel at a cost that works out to less than the minimum bet per
combination.
Even more exotic bets, such as the Daily Double or Pick-6 (select the
winners of two or six given matches), are becoming more popular be-
cause of their potentially enormous payoffs, but we won’t discuss them
any further.
The Spectacular Seven Scoring System
This book reports our attempt to model the outcome of jai alai matches,
not horse racing or football or any other sport. The critical aspect of jai alai
that makes it suitable for our kind of attack is its unique scoring system,
which is unlike that of any other sport I am aware of. This scoring system
has interesting mathematical properties that just beg the techno-geek to
try to exploit it. For this reason, it is important to explain exactly how
scoring in jai alai works.
As a pari-mutuel sport, jai alai has evolved to permit more than two
players in a match. Typically, eight players participate in any given match.
Let’s name them 1, 2, 3, . . . , 8 to reﬂect their position in the original order
of play. Every point is a battle between only two players, with the active
by pair determine by their positions in a ﬁrst-in, ﬁrst-out (FIFO) queue.
Initially, player 1 goes up against player 2. The loser of the point goes to
the end of the queue, and the winner stays on to play the fellow at the
front of the line. The ﬁrst player to total (typically) seven points is declared
the winner of the match. Because seven is exactly one point less than the
number of players, this ensures that everyone gets at least one chance
in every match. Various tiebreaking strategies are used to determine the
place and show positions.
27

CALCULATED BETS
Let’s see some examples of how particular games might unfold. We
start with Example 1, a game destined to end in a 5–1–3 trifecta. The
left side of each line of the example shows the queue of players wait-
ing their turn to compete. The two players not on this queue play the
next point. As always, player 1 starts against player 2, and everybody be-
gins with 0 points. Suppose player 1 beats player 2 (the event reported on
the center of the ﬁrst line). After this event, each player’s updated score
is shown on the right side of the table. Player 1 collects his ﬁrst point
and continues playing against the next player in line, player 3. The loser,
player 2, sulks his way back to the bench and to the end of the player
queue.
Continuing on with this example, player 1 wins his ﬁrst three points be-
fore falling to player 5. For the next three points nobody can hold
service, with 6 beating 5, 7 beating 6, and 8 beating 7. The survivor, 8,
now faces the player sitting at the top of the queue, player 2, the loser of
the opening point.
Here, the scoring system gets slightly more complicated. If you stop
to think about it, a problem with any queue-based scoring system is that

WHAT IS JAI ALAI?
the players whose initial post positions are at the bottom of the queue
start out at a serious disadvantage because the earlier players have more
opportunities to collect points. In order to reduce the disadvantage of late
post positions, the Spectacular Seven scoring system increases the reward
for each winning volley after the seventh physical point from one to two
points.
Our illustrative game is now at the midgame division line. Player 8 goes
against player 2 and scores on a well-placed chic-chac. After winning the
previous point, player 8 had a score of 1. Because the contest against 2
was the eighth physical point, it counts twice as much as before, and thus
the total score for player 8 goes from 1 to 3. Player 3 comes off the queue to
winthenexttwopoints,givinghimascoreof 2 × 2 = 4.Player1,thewinner
of the ﬁrst three points, now steps forward and dethrones the current
leader, giving him a total score of ﬁve points. Because the ﬁrst player to get
to seven points is the winner, player 1 needs only the next point for victory
(remember it counts for 2). But number 5 is alive and knocks player 1 to
the end of the line. Now with a total of three points, player 5 continues
on to beat his next two opponents, giving him a total of seven points and
the match. Player 1 (with ﬁve points) and player 3 (with four points) stand
alone for place and show, resulting in a 5–1–3 trifecta.
We have now seen two aspects of the Spectacular Seven scoring
system. First, it is ruthless. By losing a single volley, the leading player
can be sent to the end of the line and may never get another chance to
play. Second, point doubling improves the chances for players at the bot-
tom of the queue, particularly player 8. Players 1 or 2 would have to beat
their ﬁrst seven opponents to win without ever going back to the queue,
whereas player 8 only has to win his ﬁrst four volleys (the ﬁrst of which
counts for 1 and the last three of which count for two points each). Because
it is rare for any player to win seven in a row, the early players are penalized,
and the system is supposed to even out.
The Spectacular Seven scoring system was introduced in the United
States in the 1970s to speed up the game and add more excitement for
bettors. Most games last from 8 to 14 minutes, allowing for 15 matches a
night with enough time to wager in between matches. The ratio of action-
to-waiting is much better in jai alai than horse racing because each race
lasts only 2 or 3 minutes. The Spectacular Seven scoring system apparently
emerged from a research project at the University of Miami, meaning that
I have not been the ﬁrst academic to be seduced by the game.

In Example 1, place and show were easily determined because the
second and third highest point totals were unique. This is not always the
case. Our second example shows a match in which two players are tied
for second at the moment player 1 has won the match. In this case, a
one-point tiebreaker sufﬁces to determine place and show. In general,
tiebreaking can be a complicated matter. Consider the ﬁnal example in
which four players simultaneously tie for third place. The complete rules
of the Spectacular Seven describe how to resolve such complicated sce-
narios. Sometimes higher point totals are required in Spectacular Seven
matches; for example, the target is often nine points in superfecta games,
allowing win-place-show-fourth wagering. The system naturally extends
to doubles play by treating each two-man team as a single two-headed
player.
But Isn’t It Fixed?
Bookies and bettors alike are not interested in wagering on professional
wrestling, which is a situation unique among nationally televised sports.
The reason is not that fans don’t care about who is going to win a given

match – they cheer madly for Stone Cold Steven Austin and their favorite
stars. The problem isn’t market size because more people watch profes-
sional wrestling than professional hockey games and hence are poten-
tial bettors. The problem certainly isn’t that people have ceased look-
ing for new opportunities to gamble, for you can now get odds on any-
thing from the presidential election to the pregame coin toss at the Super
Bowl.
Professional wrestling has no chance to succeed as a gambling venue
because the betting public understands that the results of wrestling
matches are choreographed in advance. Hence, to someone in the know,
there is no uncertainty at all about who will win. I wouldn’t accept a bet
from anyone who might really know the outcome beforehand, and neither
would you.
Many people are afraid to bet on jai alai because they are betting on
players who happen to be people. Professional players want to win. But
31

CALCULATED BETS
give them sufﬁcient ﬁnancial incentive to lose, and they will lose. In horse
racing, you can be pretty sure that the horse did not bet on the race, but
such conﬁdence seems misplaced in jai alai.2
Obviously, the frontons themselves have a strong incentive to avoid
betting scandals. Anything that scares away potential bettors is a funda-
mental threat to their business. Every fronton pays players both a ﬁxed
salary and a bonus for each game they win, and thus they have incentive
to play hard and win. The frontons have strong rules against match ﬁxing,
and any player not on the up-and-up will become persona non grata at
every fronton in the world. Players at a top fronton like Milford earn in
the ballpark of $50,000 over the course of an 8-month season (for stars
the earnings go into six ﬁgures), and thus they do have incentive to play
fairly.
In the course of my research for this book, I have uncovered only lim-
ited discussions of crooked jai alai betting. Nasty things apparently oc-
curred in the United States in the late 1970s, which no one likes to talk
about today, but several Florida and California state documents from the
1950s and 1960s I studied stress that the sport had no whiff of scandal
up to that point. They credited this to a strong players union and the
close-knit structure of the Basque community, which polices its own.
It is hard for an outsider to ﬁx a game with a player who speaks only
Basque.
The one game-ﬁxing scandal I have seen documented occurred in
Florida, apparently during the strike years, when underskilled and unded-
icated scab players roamed the court. Groups of three or four players per
match were bribed by the ﬁxer to play dead, who then bought multiple
quiniela boxes covering all pairs of honest players. The betting volume
required to turn a proﬁt on the deal was also high enough to catch the
attention of the fronton. Eventually, it was used to help convict the head
ﬁxer in criminal court.
The nature of jai alai particularly lends itself to suspicions of ﬁxing.
Players have to catch a rock-hard ball hurled at 150 miles per hour using
an outsized basket strapped to their arm. Often, a seemingly catchable ball
will dribble out of a player’s cesta, and immediately cries of “ﬁx” will come
from bettors who have invested on this player’s behalf. But let’s be fair. The
width of the cesta in the area where the ball enters is only 3 to 3.5 inches,
2 Of course, one may be concerned about the jockey’s possible investment strategy.
32

WHAT IS JAI ALAI?
whereas the diameter of the ball is almost 2 inches. This leaves only an
inch or so as the margin of error, which is not much – especially when the
ball is curving or wobbling.
Thefan’s fearofcheatinghassomeinterestingconsequences.Thepub-
lished program listing the schedule for each match always includes each
player’s birthdate, even though some of the players are quite long in the
tooth. Why? I’ve heard that suspicious fans think that Joey’s fellow players
will, as a present, let him win matches on his birthday, and these bettors
want to share in the celebration.
All this said, we don’t worry about ﬁxes in our betting system and won’t
concern ourselves with them any more in this book. Why? That our sys-
tem predicts the outcome of jai alai matches much better than chance
tells us that most games are not ﬁxed. Even the most cynical bettor will
admit that performing a successful ﬁx requires a certain amount of en-
ergy, investment, and risk. These considerations dictate that only a small
fraction of games will be ﬁxed. For a system like ours, which relies on
making lots of small bets instead of a few big ones, ﬁxes can be written off
as a cost of doing business. Spend too much time worrying about ﬁxes and
you turn into a conspiracy theorist and then a nut case. I have the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change.

deep understanding of the given game so that there is some method to the
madness.
Gambling systems, even bogus ones, are always interesting to hear
about because they say something about how people perceive (or misper-
ceive) probability. My favorite bogus systems include the following:
I Doubling up in casino gambling – Consider the following strategy for
gambling in roulette. Walk into the casino and bet a dollar on black. If
it wins, boldly pocket your earnings. If not, bet $1 again on black. If it
wins, you are back to where you started. If it loses, bet $2 on black to
recoup your losses. After each loss, keep doubling up. Inevitably, you
are going to win sometime, and at that point you are all caught up. Now
you can start again from the beginning. You can’t ever lose money with
this scheme, can you?

deep pocket and are playing on a table without a betting limit. If your
table has a betting limit or you are not able to print money, you will
eventually reach a point at which the house will not let you bet as much
as you need in order to play by this system. At this point you will have
been completely wiped out.
This doubling or Martingale system offers you a high probabil-
ity of small returns in exchange for a small possibility of becoming
homeless. Casinos are more than happy to let you take this chance.
After all, Donald Trump has a much deeper pocket than either you or
I have.
I The O’Hare straddle – An alternate doubling scheme is as follows: Bor-
row a large amount of cash on a short-term basis. Set aside enough
money for a ticket on the next plane to South America. Bet the rest
on one spin of the roulette wheel at even money. If you win,
return the principal and retire on the rest. Otherwise, use the plane
ticket.
Mathematically, the key to making this work is being bold enough
to wager all the money on a single bet rather than making multiple
smaller bets. The casino extracts a tax on each “even-money” wager
via the 0 and 00 slots on the wheel. You pay more tax each time you re-
bet the winnings, thus lowering your chances of a big killing. However,
the most likely result of playing the O’Hare straddle will be a sudden
need to increase your ﬂuency in Spanish.
I Collecting statistics on lottery numbers – Some people carefully chart
the frequency with which lottery numbers have come in recently and
then play the numbers that are either “due” or “hot.” Unfortunately,
the notion of a number “being due” or “being hot” violates all laws of
probability (technically the assumption that the numbers arise from
independent Bernoulli trials). Lottery numbers are selected by draw-
ing numbered balls from a jar, or some equivalent method. Provided
that the balls have been thoroughly mixed up, there is no way a ball
can “know” that it has not been selected for a while and hence is due.
Similarly, the notion of a number’s “being hot” makes sense only when
the numbers have been drawn according to a nonuniform random
number generator.
As we will see, poor random number generators certainly exist;
I will talk more about this in Chapter 3. There is also historical

precedent for poorly mixed-up balls. During the Vietnam War, the U.S.
military draft selected soldiers by lottery according to birthday. A total
of 365 balls, each bearing one possible birthdate, were tossed into a jar,
andunlucky19-year-oldsweremusteredintothearmyiftheirbirthdate
was selected. In 1970, several newspapers observed that December’s
children had a startlingly high chance of being drafted, and indeed,
the lottery selection procedure turned out to be ﬂawed. It was ﬁxed for
the next year, which was presumably small consolation to those left
marching in the rice paddies.
Although each lottery combination is just as likely to come in as
any other, there is one formally justiﬁable criterion you can use in
picking lottery numbers. It makes a great deal of sense to try to pick
a set of numbers nobody else has selected because, if your ticket is
a winner, you won’t have to share the prize with anybody else who
is a winner. For this reason, playing any ticket with a simple pattern
of numbers is likely to be a mistake, for someone else might stumble
across the same simple pattern. I would avoid such patterns as 2–4–
6–8–10–12 and even such numerical sequences as the primes 2–3–5–
7–11–13 or the Fibonacci numbers 1–2–3–5–8–13 because there are
just too many mathematicians out there for you to keep the prize to
yourself.
There are probably too many of whatever-you-are-interested-in as
well; thus, stick to truly random sequences of numbers unless you like
to share. Indeed, my favorite idea for a movie would be to have one
of the very simple and popular patterns of lottery numbers come up
a winner; say, the numbers resulting from ﬁlling in the entire top row
on the ticket form. As a result, several hundred people will honestly
think they won the big prize only later to discover it is not really so
long (only $5,000 or so). This will not be enough to get members of the
star-studded ensemble cast out of the trouble they got into the instant
they thought they became millionaires.
On the other hand, well-founded betting systems are available for cer-
tain games if you know what your are doing:
I Card counting in blackjack – Blackjack is unique among casino games
in that a sufﬁciently clever player can indeed have an advantage over
the house. In blackjack, each player starts with two cards, and the goal

without going over. Thekeydecisionforanyplayeriswhethertoaccept
an additional unknown card from the house. This card will increase
your point total, which is good, unless it takes you over 21, which is
bad. You win money if your total is closer to 21 than the dealer’s, who
must play according to a well-deﬁned strategy.
If you know nothing about the cards you are to be dealt, the dealer’s
strategyissufﬁcienttoguaranteethehouseaniceadvantage.However,
a sufﬁciently clever player does know something about the hand he or
she will be dealt. Why? Suppose in the previous hand the player saw
that all four aces had been dealt out. If the cards had not been reshuf-
ﬂed, all of those aces would have been sitting in the discard pile. If it
is assumed that only one deck of cards is being dealt from, there is no
possibility of seeing an ace in the next hand, and a clever player can
bet accordingly. By keeping track of what cards he or she has seen (card
counting) and properly interpreting the results, the player knows the
true odds that each card will show up and thus can adjust strategy ac-
cordingly. Card counters theoretically have an inherent advantage of
up to 1.5% against the casino, depending upon which system they use.
Edward Thorp’s book Beat the Dealer started the card-counting
crazein1962.Equippedwithcomputer-generatedcountingchartsand
a fair amount of chutzpah, Thorp took on the casinos. Once it became
clear (1) that he was winning, and (2) it wasn’t just luck, the casinos be-
came quite unfriendly. Most states permit casinos to expel any player
they want, and it is usually fairly easy for a casino to detect and ex-
pel a successful card counter. Even without expulsion, casinos have
made things more difﬁcult for card counters by increasing the num-
ber of decks in play at one time. If 10 decks are in play, seeing 4 aces
means that there are still 36 aces to go, greatly decreasing the potential
advantage of counting.
For these reasons, the most successful card counters are the ones
who write books that less successful players buy. Thorp himself was
driven out of casino gambling in Wall Street, where he was reduced
to running a hedge fund worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Still,
almost every mathematically oriented gambler has been intrigued by
card counting at one point or another. Gene Stark, a colleague of mine
about whom you’ll read more later, devised his own card-counting sys-
tem and used it successfully a few times in Atlantic City. However, he
36

WHAT IS JAI ALAI?
discovered that making signiﬁcant money off a 1.5% advantage over
the house requires a large investment of either time or money. It isn’t
any more fun making $5.50 an hour counting cards than it is tending
a cash register.
I The eudaemonic pie – Physicists tend to be good at mathematics. A few
years ago, the American Physical Society had its annual convention in
Las Vegas, during which the combination conference hotel and casino
took a serious ﬁnancial hit. The hotel rented out rooms to the confer-
ence at below cost, planning to make the difference back and more
from the gambling losses of conference goers. However, the physicists
just would not gamble. They knew that the only way to win was not to
play the game.
But another group of physicists did once develop a sound way to
beat the game of roulette. A roulette wheel consists of two parts, a mov-
ing inner wheel and a stationary outer wheel. To determine the next
“random” number, the inner wheel is set spinning, and then the ball
is sent rolling along the rim of the outer wheel. Things rattle around
for several seconds before the ball drops down into its slot, and peo-
ple are allowed to bet over this interval. However, in theory, the win-
ning number is preordained from the speed of the ball, the speed
of the wheel, and the starting position of each. All you have to do is
measure these quantities to sufﬁcient accuracy and work through the
physics.
As reported in Thomas Bass’s entertaining book The Eudaemonic
Pie, this team built a computer small enough to ﬁt in the heel of a shoe
and programmed in the necessary equations. Finger or toe presses at
reference points on the wheel were used to enter the observed speed of
the ball. It was necessary to conceal this computer carefully; otherwise,
casinos would have been certain to ban the players the moment they
started winning.
Did it work? Yes, although they never quite made the big score in
roulette. Like Thorp, the principals behind this scheme were even-
tually driven to Wall Street, building systems to bet on stocks and
commodities instead of following the bouncing ball. Their later ad-
ventures are reported in the sequel, The Predictors.
I Flooding large lottery pools – Lotteries in the United States keep get-
ting bigger. The bigger a jackpot, the more that people want to play.
37

CALCULATED BETS
Many states have switched to systems of accumulated pools in which,
if no grand prize winner emerges in a given week, the money rolls over
to supplement next week’s prize. The pool grows very large whenever
a few weeks go by without a winner. Whenever the pool gets large
enough (say $100 million), it starts a betting frenzy that draws national
attention.
The interesting aspect of large pools is that any wager, no matter
how small the probability of success, can yield positive expected re-
turns given a sufﬁciently high payoff. Most state lotteries are obligated
to pay some fraction (say 50%) of all betting receipts back to the bet-
tors. If nobody guesses right for a sufﬁciently long time, the potential
payoff for a winning ticket can overcome the vanishingly small odds
of winning. For any lottery, there exists a pool size sufﬁcient to en-
sure a positive expected return if only a given number of tickets are
sold.
But once it pays to buy one lottery ticket, then it pays to buy all
of them. This has not escaped the attention of large syndicates that
place bets totaling millions of dollars on all possible combinations,
thus ensuring themselves a winning ticket.
State lottery agents frown on such betting syndicates, not because
they lose money (the cost of the large pool has been paid by the lack of
winners over the previous few weeks) but because printing millions of
tickets ties up agents throughout the state and discourages the rest of
the betting public. Still, these syndicates like a discouraged public. The
only danger they face is other bettors who also pick the winning num-
bers, for the pool must be shared with these other parties. Given an
estimate of how many tickets will be bought by the public, this risk can
be accurately measured by the syndicate to determine whether to go
for it.
Syndicate betting has also occurred in jai alai in a big way. Palm
Beach Jai-Alai ran an accumulated Pick-6 pool that paid off only if a
bettor correctly picked the winners of six designated matches. This
was quite a challenge because each two-dollar bet was an 86 = 262,
144-to-1 shot for the jackpot.
On March 1, 1983, the pool stood at $551,332 after accumulating
over 147 nights. This amount was more than it would have cost to
buy one of every possible ticket. That day, an anonymous syndicate
38

WHAT IS JAI ALAI?
invested an additional $524,288 to guarantee itself a large proﬁt, but
only if it didn’t have to share. Only $21,956 was wagered on Pick 6 that
night by other bettors, giving the syndicate an almost 96% chance of
keeping the entire pot to itself, which were terriﬁc odds in its favor.
Indeed, only the syndicate held the winning combo of 4–7–7–6–2–1, a
ticket worth $790,662.20.

CHAPTER THREE
MONTE CARLO ON THE TUNDRA
Several years passed from that carefree winter day when Pepe’s Green Card
led me to my ﬁrst trifecta. I found myself in high school taking a course in
computer programming and got myself hooked. It was very empowering
to be able tell a machine what to do and have it do exactly what I asked.
All I had to do was ﬁgure out what to ask it.
I Was a High School Bookie
During my sophomore year of high school, I got the idea of writing a
program that would predict the outcome of professional football games.
Frankly, I wasn’t too interested in football as a sport (I remain a baseball
fan at heart), but I observed several of my classmates betting their lunch
money on the outcome of the weekend football games. It seemed clear to
me that writing a program that accurately predicted the outcome of foot-
ball games could have signiﬁcant value and would be a very cool thing to
do besides.
In retrospect, the program I came up with now seems hopelessly crude.
Itﬁrstreadinthestatisticsforteams x and y;statssuchasthetotalnumber
of points scored this year, the total number of points allowed, and the
number of games played so far. My program averaged the points scored by
team x and the points allowed by team y to predict the number of points
40

MONTE CARLO ON THE TUNDRA
x would score against y.
Px = (points scored by team x) + (points allowed by team y )
2 × (games played)
Py = [(points scored by team y) + (points allowed by team x)]
2 × (games played)
For example, suppose the Cowboys were playing the Saints. The cham-
pion Cowboys had scored 300 points and given up 200, whereas the peren-
nial doormat Saints had scored 200 and given up 400 points, each team
havingplayed10games.TheformulasabovewouldpredicttheCowboysto
beat the Saints by a score of (300 + 400)/(2 × 10) = 35 to (200 + 200)/(2 ×
10) = 20. I would then adjust these numbers up or down in response to
15 other factors, such as yards for and against and home ﬁeld advantage,
round the numbers appropriately, and call what was left my predicted
score for the game.
This computer program, Clyde, was my ﬁrst attempt to build a mathe-
matical model of some aspect of the real world. This model had a certain
amount of logic going for it. Good teams score more points than they allow,
whereas bad teams allow more points than they score. If team x plays a
team y that has given up a lot of points, then x should score more points
against y than it does against teams with better defenses. Similarly, the
more points team x has scored against the rest of the league, the more
points it is likely to score against y.
Of course, this very crude model couldn’t capture all aspects of football
reality. Suppose team x has been playing all stiffs thus far in the season,
whereas team y has been playing the best teams in the league. Team y
might be a much better team than x even though its record so far is poor.
This model also ignores any injuries a team is suffering from, whether the
weather is hot or cold, and whether the team is hot or cold. It disregards
all the factors that make sports inherently unpredictable.
And yet, even such a simple model can do a reasonable job of pre-
dicting the outcome of football games. If you compute the point aver-
ages as above and give the home team an additional 3 points as a bonus,
you will pick the winner of about 2/3 of all football games, whereas the
even cruder model of ﬂipping a coin predicts only half the games
correctly.
41

CALCULATED BETS
That was the ﬁrst major lesson Clyde taught me:
 Even crude mathematical models can have real predictive power.
As an audacious 16-year-old, I wrote to our local newspaper, The New
Brunswick Home News, explaining that I had a computer program to pre-
dict football games and offering them the exclusive opportunity to publish
my predictions each week. Remember that this was back in 1977, well be-
fore personal computers had registered on the public consciousness. In
those days, the idea of a high school kid actually using a computer had
considerable gee-whiz novelty value. To appreciate how much times have
changed, check out the article the paper published about Clyde and me.
I got the job. Clyde predicted the outcome of each game in the 1977 Na-
tional Football League. It was very cool seeing my name in print each week
and monitoring the football scores each Sunday to see how we were doing.
As I recall, Clyde and I ﬁnished the season with the seemingly impressive
record of 135–70. Each week, my predictions would be compared against
those of the newspaper’s sportswriters. As I recall, we all ﬁnished within a
few games of each other, although most of the sportswriters ﬁnished with
better records than the computer.
The Home News was so impressed by my work that they didn’t renew
me the following season. However, for the 1978 season Clyde’s picks were
published in the Philadelphia Inquirer, a much bigger newspaper. I didn’t
have the column to myself, though. Instead, the Inquirer included me
among 10 amateur and professional prognosticators. Each week we had
to predict the outcomes of four games against the point spread.
The point spread in football is a way of handicapping stronger teams
for betting purposes. Think back to the Cowboys and Saints football game
described earlier. It would be impossible to ﬁnd a bookie who would let
you bet on the Cowboys to win at even-money odds because any Saints
victory required a miracle substantial enough to get canonized in the ﬁrst
place. Instead, the bookies would publish a point spread like Cowboys by
14 points. If you bet on the Cowboys, they had to win by at least 14 points
for you to win the bet. The Saints could lose the game by 10 points and
still leave their betting fans cheering. The point spread is designed to make
each game a 50–50 proposition and hence makes predicting the outcome
of games much harder.
Clyde and I didn’t do very well against the spread during the 1978
National Football League season, and neither did most of the other
42

My ﬁrst attempt at mathematical modeling.

Philadelphia Inquirer touts. We predicted only 46% of our games correctly
against the spread, which was a performance good (or bad) enough to
ﬁnish 7th out of the 10 published prognosticators. We did somewhat better
on the game we selected as our best bet of the week, ﬁnishing 12–8 and in
second place among the touts. Still, picking against the spread taught me
a second major life lesson:
 Crudemathematicalmodelsdonothaverealpredictivepowerwhen
there is real money on the line.
Clyde ﬁnished his career with 4 years of picking the results of University
of Virginia football games for our student newspaper, The Cavalier Daily.
Our results were about the same as with the pros. We went 35–19–1, correct
on the easy games and wrong on the hard ones.
Clyde’s most memorable moment at the University of Virginia came
when I was hired to help tutor a member of the football team. Randy was
a linebacker, 6 feet 6 inches and 270 pounds. One day I asked him what
he thought of Clyde in the newspaper, not letting on that I was the man
behind the program. He assured me that the entire team felt Clyde didn’t
know bleep.
This taught me a third major life lesson:
 Never argue with a 6-foot 6-inch 270-pound linebacker.
Back to Jai Alai
Every other winter or so our family migrated down to Florida for fun in the
sun and a night at the fronton. Sometimes Pepe’s Green Card enabled us
to break even for the night; other times it let us down. This mixed record
impressed upon me the beneﬁts of ﬁnding winners for ourselves.
The more jai alai I watched, the more it became apparent to me that
the Spectacular Seven scoring system exerted a profound effect on the
outcome of jai alai matches. Even a cursory look at the statistics revealed
that certain positions were far easier to win from than others. It was simply
not the case that good teams would usually beat bad ones, because the
arbitrarily chosen position from which you started in the queue made a
big difference in how many chances you had to score the required points.
If a good team got a bad starting position, its chances of winning might be
less than that of a bad team in a good starting position. A good team in a
good starting position had a real advantage; them that has, gets.
44

MONTE CARLO ON THE TUNDRA
The Spectacular Seven scoring system means that life isn’t fair. Modern
business ethics teach us that, whenever you see an unfair situation, you
should exploit it for as much personal gain as possible.
How could I exploit the biases of the Spectacular Seven scoring system?
I’d have to start by building a mathematical model of the situation, a sim-
ulation of the series of events that unfold during each jai alai match. The
simple ideas underlying my football program were simply not sufﬁcient
for such a complex reality. However, I could get a handle on the situation
using the powerful technique of Monte Carlo simulation.
Monte Carlo Simulations
Simulations provide insight into complex problems. Simulation is used in
economics, engineering, and the physical sciences because it is often im-
possible to experiment on the real thing. Economists cannot play with the
U.S. budget deﬁcit and see how long it takes for the economy to collapse.
Rather, they will make a computer model and study the effects of such
spending on it. The signiﬁcance of the simulation results depends on the
accuracy of the model as well as how correctly the model has been turned
into a computer program.
There are a wide variety of computer simulation techniques, but we
will employ a curious method known as Monte Carlo simulation. “Monte
Carlo”shouldconjureupanimageofaswankcasinoontheFrenchRiviera,
and hence seem particularly appropriate as a technique to model a form
of gambling. However, this connection is even deeper because the whole
idea of Monte Carlo simulation is to mimic random games of chance.
Suppose we want to compute the odds of winning a particularly exotic
bet in roulette, such as having the ball land in a prime-numbered slot
(either 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, or 31) three out of the next four times
we spin the wheel. The most naive approach would be to watch a roulette
wheelinactionforaspell,keepingtrackofhowoftenwewin.Ifwewatched
for 1000 trials and won 91 times in this interval, the odds should be about
1 in 10. To get a more accurate estimate, we could simply watch the game
for a longer period.
Nowsupposeinsteadofwatchingarealroulettewheelinactionwesim-
ulate the random behavior of the wheel with a computer. We can conduct
the same experiments in a computer program instead of a casino, and the
fraction of simulated wins to simulated chances gives us the approximate
odds – provided our roulette wheel simulation is accurate.

Picasso
A Picasso-like painting of oddly shaped areas.
Monte Carlo simulations are used for far more important applications
than just modeling gambling. A classical application of the technique is
in mathematical integration, which (if you ever took calculus) you may
recall is a fancy term for computing the geometric area of a region.
Calculus-based methods for integration require fancy mathematical tech-
niques to do the job. Monte Carlo techniques enable you to estimate areas
using nothing more than a dart board.
Suppose someone gave you this Picasso-like painting consisting of
oddly shaped red, yellow, and blue swirls, and asked you to compute
what fraction of the area of the painting is red. Computing the area of
the entire picture is easy because it is rectangular and the area of a rect-
angle is simply its height times its width. But what can we do to ﬁgure out
the area of the weirdly shaped blobs?
If you throw darts the way I do, it doesn’t matter much whether you
keep your eyes open or closed. Exactly where the darts land is pretty much
46

MONTE CARLO ON THE TUNDRA
a random event. Now suppose that I start blindly throwing darts in the
general direction of the painting. Some are going to clang off the wall, but
others will occasionally hit the painting and stick there. If I throw the darts
randomly at the painting, there will be no particular bias towards hitting a
particular part of the painting – red is no more a dart-attractor than yellow
is a dart-repeller. Thus, if more darts hit the red region than the yellow
region, what can we conclude? There had to be more space for darts to hit
the red region that the yellow one, and hence the red area has to be bigger
than the yellow area.
Suppose after we have hit the painting with 100 darts, 46 hit red, 12 hit
blue, 13 hit yellow, and 29 hit the white area within the frame. We can
concludethatroughlyhalfofthepaintingisred.Ifweneedamoreaccurate
measure, we can keep throwing more darts at the painting until we have

Of course, throwing real darts at a real Picasso painting would be an ex-
pensiveexercise.Itwouldbemuchbettertoperformtheentireexperiment
with a computer. Suppose we scan in an image of the painting and ran-
domly select points from this image. Each random point represents the tip
of a virtual dart. By counting the number of selected points of each color,
we can estimate the area of each region to as high a degree of accuracy as
we are willing to wait for.
I hope these examples have made the idea of Monte Carlo simulation
clear. Basically, we must perform enough random trials on a computer to
get a good estimate of what is likely to happen in real life. I will explain
where the random numbers come from later. But ﬁrst, I’ll show how to
build a simulated jai alai match from random numbers.
Building the Simulation
A simulation is a special type of mathematical model – one that aims to
replicate some form of real-world phenomenon instead of just predicting
it. A simulation of a football game would attempt to “play” the game in
question step-by-step to see what might happen. The simulated football
game would start with a simulated kickoff and advance through a simu-
lated set of downs, during which the simulated team would either score or
give up the simulated ball. After predicting what might happen on every
single play in the simulated game, the program could produce a predicted
ﬁnal score as the outcome of the simulated game.
Bycontrast,myfootball-pickingprogramClyde wasastatisticalmodel,
not a simulation. Clyde really knew almost nothing that was speciﬁc to
football. Indeed, the basic technique of averaging the points for-and-
against to get a score should work just as well to predict baseball and
basketball scores. The key to building an accurate statistical model is pick-
ing the right statistical factors and weighing them appropriately.
Building an accurate football-game simulator would be an immensely
challenging task. The outcome of each play in football depends on many
complicated factors, including the skill matchups between each of the
11 sets of players, how tired or injured each of them are, the offensive
and defensive alignments of each team, the coach’s strategy, the game
situation, and the current ﬁeld conditions. Jai alai is, by contrast, a much
simpler game to simulate.
What events in a jai alai match must we simulate? Each match starts
with players 1 and 2 playing and the rest of the players waiting patiently in
48

MONTE CARLO ON THE TUNDRA
line. All players start the game with scores of zero points each. Each point
in the match involves two players: one who will win and one who will lose.
The loser will go to the end of the line, whereas the winner will add to his
point total and await the next point unless he has accumulated enough
points to claim the match.
This sequence of events can be described by the following program
ﬂow structure, or algorithm:
Initialize the current players to 1 and 2.
Initialize the queue of players to {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.
Initialize the point total for each player to zero.
So long as the current winner has less than 7 points:
Play a simulated point between the two current players.
Add one (or if beyond the seventh point, two) to the
total of the simulated point winner.
Put the simulated point loser at the end of the queue.
Get the next player off the front of the queue.
End So long as.
Identify the current point winner as the winner of the match.
The only step in this algorithm that needs more elaboration is that of
simulating a point between two players. If the purpose of our simulation is
to see how biases in the scoring system affect the outcome of the match, it
makes the most sense to consider the case in which all players are equally
skillful. To give every player a 50–50 chance of winning each point he is
involved in, we can ﬂip a simulated coin to determine who wins and who
loses.
Any reasonable computer programmer would be able to take a ﬂow
description such as this and turn it into a program in the language of his
or her choice. This algorithm describes how to simulate one particular
game, but by running it 1,000,000 times and keeping track of how often
each possible outcome occurs, we would get a pretty good idea of what
happens during a typical jai alai match.
Breaking Ties
The Spectacular Seven scoring system, as thus far described, uniquely
determines a winner for every game. However, because of place and show
betting, a second- and third-place ﬁnisher must also be established.
49

CALCULATED BETS
According to my simulation, ties occur in roughly one-third of all games
played, and thus proper handling of these cases is essential.
It is very important to break ties under the same scoring system used
by the frontons themselves. To show how complicated these rules are, we
present for your amusement the ofﬁcial state of Florida rules governing
the elimination games in jai alai:
1.
After a winner has been declared, play-off rules to decide place,
show and fourth positions vary according to the number of points
scored by the participating players or teams, and shall be played
according to the players or teams rotation position (not post posi-
tion), i.e., the order in which they were defeated.
2.

shall not be necessary, in order to determine place, show or fourth

3.
When there still remain ﬁve or seven players or teams, all of which
are tied without a point to their credit, the play-off shall be for a goal
of one point less than the number of post positions represented in
the play-off.
4.
When there still remain ﬁve or seven players or teams, all of which
are tied without a point to their credit, the play-off shall be contin-
ued until the player or team reaches the number of points desig-
nated for the game.
5.
In case of two ties, after a Winner has been declared ofﬁcial, and
there are still two players or teams tied with the same number of
points, the place position shall be awarded to the player or team
making the next point, and show position goes to the loser of said
point.
In games where a fourth position is required, if:
(a) Two ties remain after win and place have been determined, the
showpositionshallbeawardedtotheplayerorteammakingthe

(b) Two ties remain after Win, Place and Show have been deter-

or teams, with the same number of points, through elimination,

50

MONTE CARLO ON THE TUNDRA
be awarded the place, show or fourth position, as the case may be,
and any remaining players or teams shall forfeit the right to play
for said position.
7.
In case of four or six ties, after a Winner has been declared ofﬁcial
and there remain four or six players or teams, tied for place, show or
fourth, or all three, play-off shall be through elimination according
to their rotating position. The ﬁrst two players or teams will play
the ﬁrst point. The next two players or teams will play for one point,
and the remaining (in case of 6) players or teams will also play for
one point. Winners of the above points will play additional points
to decide place, show and fourth position, as the case may require.
8.
In games where a fourth position is required and no place, show
or fourth position has been determined and there remain four ties,
the losing players or teams of the elimination play-off return and
play a ﬁnal point to determine fourth.
9.
If at any time during a play-off a player or team reaches the des-
ignated number of points the game calls for, said player, or team,
shall immediately be awarded the place, show or fourth position,
as the case may be and the remaining players or teams shall forfeit
the right to play for said position.
As you can see, the complete tiebreaking rules are insanely compli-
cated. You need a lawyer, not a computer scientist to understand them.
The least interesting but most time-consuming part of writing this sim-
ulation was making sure that I implemented all of the tiebreaking rules
correctly. I wanted the simulation to accurately reﬂect reality, even those
rare realities of seven players ending in a tie (which happens roughly once
every 1300 games).
When you are simulating a million games, you must assume that any-
thing that can happen will happen. By including the complete set of
tiebreaking rules in the program, I knew my simulation would be ready
for anything.
Simulation Results
I implemented the jai alai simulation in my favorite programming lan-
guage at that time (Pascal) and ran it on 1,000,000 jai alai games. Today, it
would take no more than a few minutes of computer time to complete the
run; back in the mid-1980s it probably took a few hours.
The simulation produced a table of statistics telling me how often each
of the possible win, place, show, and trifecta bets would have paid off

in 1,000,000 games, on the assumption that all the players were equally
skillful. Table 3.1 gives the simulated win, place, and show outcomes for
each of the eight post positions. A pioneer in information theory, Richard
Hamming, once said that “the purpose of computing is insight, not num-
bers.” Very well. What insights can we draw from this table?
I Positions 1 and 2 have a substantial advantage over the rest of the ﬁeld.
Either of the initial players is almost twice as likely to be ﬁrst, second,
or third than the poor shlub in position 7.
I Doubling the value of each point after the seventh point in the match
improves player 8’s chances to win but does not affect the odds of place
or show. The reason is that, for player 8 to do well, he must jump at the
ﬁrst chance he gets. Player 8 can win by winning his ﬁrst four points,
which should happen (if players are assumed to be of equal skill) with
probability (1/2)4 = 1/16, or 6.25% of the time. This quick kill thus
accounts for over 70% of player 8’s wins. The best player 8 can get on a
quickrunandnotwinis5,whichoftenisnotenoughforaplaceorshow.
I The real beneﬁciaries of point doubling are players 1 and 2, who, even
if they lose their ﬁrst point immediately, get the same opportunities as
8 did the second time around. Them as has, gets.
I Positions 1 and 2 have essentially the same win, place, and show statis-
tics. This is as it should be because 1 and 2 are players of identical skill,
both of whom start the game on the court instead of in the queue.
Because players 1 and 2 have very similar statistics, our conﬁdence in
the correctness of the simulation increases.

MONTE CARLO ON THE TUNDRA
I Positions 1 and 2 do not have identical statistics because we simulated
“only” 1,000,000 games. If you ﬂip a coin a million times, it almost cer-
tainly won’t come up exactly half heads and half tails. However, the
ratio of heads to tails should keep getting closer to 50–50 the more
coins we ﬂip.
Thesimulatedgapbetweenplayers1and2tellsussomethingabout
the limitations on the accuracy of our simulation. We shouldn’t trust
any conclusions that depend upon small differences in the observed
values. I would be unwilling to state, for example, that player 7 has a
better chance of ﬁnishing third than ﬁrst because the observed differ-
ence is so very small.
To help judge the correctness of the simulation, I compared its predic-
tions to the outcomes of actual jai alai matches. A complicating factor is
that many frontons have their matchmakers take player skill into consid-
eration when assigning post positions. Better players are often assigned to
less favorable post positions to create more exciting games.

limits of the small sample size. Post positions 1 and 2 won most often at
Berenson’s, and position 7 least often.
The actual variation in winning percentage by post position is less
in practice than suggested by the simulation, and the data shows a little
dip for player 4. Thus, we can conclude that the matchmaker’s efforts
moderate but do not eliminate the post position bias. That matchmakers
can inﬂuence the outcome of the matches is actually quite encouraging,
because it suggests that we can further improve our prediction accuracy
by factoring player skills into our model.
Even more interesting phenomena reveal themselves in trifecta bet-
ting, where the ﬁrst three ﬁnishers must be picked in order. There are 336
possible trifecta outcomes, and thus the “average” trifecta should have
occurred roughly 1,000,000/336 ≈2976 times in the course of our simula-
tion.However,asTables3.3and3.4show,thereisanenormousvariationin
the frequency of trifecta outcomes. Trifecta 1–4–2 occurs roughly 10 times
as often as 1–6–7, which occurs roughly ten times as often as 5–6–8, which
occurs roughly 10 times as often as 5–8–7. Certain trifectas are 1,000 times
more likely to occur than others! In particular,
I The best trifectas are 1–3–2, 1–4–2, 1–5–2, 4–1–3, and their symmetrical
variants2–3–1,2–4–1,2–5–1,and4–2–3.Eachofthesetrifectasoccurred
over 8000 times in the course of the simulation, or more than 2.6 times
that of the average trifecta.
The advantages of these favorable trifectas show up in real jai alai
results. I compared the simulation’s 16 most frequently occurring tri-
fectas with the Berenson’s Jai-alai data from 1983 to 1986. These were
the eight best trifectas listed above plus 1–2–5, 1–2–6, 4–2–1, 5–1–4, and
the four symmetrical variants. My simulation projected each of them
shouldoccurbetween0.77and0.88%ofthetime,whereasatBerenson’s
over this period they occurred between 0.49 and 0.86% percent of the
time. By contrast, the average trifecta occurs under 0.30% of the time.
This is a signiﬁcant bias that holds potential for exploitation, al-
though the advantage of favorable trifectas is less pronounced than
the disadvantages of unfavorable ones.
I Several trifectas are unbelievably terrible bets, occurring less than 100
times out of 1,000,000 games. That makes them at least a 10,000-to-1
shot, kiddies. The four trifectas appearing least frequently in the sim-
ulation were 5–7–8, 5–8–7, 6–7–8, and 6–8–7, which occurred a grand

total of 43 times between them. I would like to play poker against any-
body who bets such numbers regularly.
The paucity of these trifecta events is not an artifact of our simula-
tion but is a phenomenon that really exists. I went back and looked at
statistics from 17 seasons at Dania Jai-alai encompassing 29,096 games
(Dania’s has a signiﬁcantly longer history than Berenson’s). Only 4 of
the 336 possible trifectas never occurred over this period: 5–7–8, 5–8–7,
6–7–8, and 6–8–7. These are exactly the four trifectas identiﬁed as least
likely to occur by the simulation. The model expects them to happen
only once every 25,000 games or so, meaning that our results are right
on target.
I A careful study of the tables shows that there is a strong bias against
players from neighboring post positions both doing well in a match.
For example, the 5–2–4 trifecta occurs almost three times as often as
5–3–4, and 6–3–5 occurs almost ﬁve times as often as 6–4–5. This is
because neighboring players must play each other early in the game,
and the loser is destined to return to the bottom of the queue with at
most one point to his name. For both to do well, the point-winner has
to go on to earn enough points to lock up second place and then lose
to permit his neighbor to accumulate enough points to win.
This bias helps explains the Gang of Four rotten trifectas, because
they all have the double whammy of neighboring high-post positions.
Now we know the probability that each possible betting opportunity in
jaialaiwillpayoff.Arewenowreadytostartmakingmoney?Unfortunately
not. Even though we have established that post position is a major factor
in determining the outcome of jai alai matches, perhaps the dominant
one, we still have the following hurdles to overcome before we can bet
responsibly:
I The impact of player skills – Obviously, the skills of the individual players
affect the outcome of the game. A study of season statistics for players
over several years reveals that their winning percentage stays relatively
constant,likethebattingaveragesofbaseballplayer.Thus,agoodplayer
is more likely to win than a bad one, regardless of post position. It is clear
that a better model for predicting the outcome of jai alai matches will
come from factoring relative skills into the queuing model.
I The sophistication of the betting public – Economic analysis of horse rac-

that the odds set by the public largely reﬂect the risk of the situation.
Countless other people certainly noticed the impact of post position
well before I did, including those who reported on similar simulations
such as Goodfriend and Friedman, Grofman and Noviello, and Moser.
Indeed, as we will see, the jai alai betting public has largely factored the
effect of post position in the odds.
Fortunately for us, however, largely does not mean completely.
I Thehousecut–Frontonskeepabout20%ofthebettingpoolasthehouse
percentage, and thus one has to do much better then the average bettor
just to break even.
My simulation provides information on which outcomes are most
likely. It does not by itself identify which are the best bets. A good bet
depends both upon the likelihood of the event’s occurring and the payoff
when it occurs. Payoffs are decided by the rest of the betting public. To ﬁnd
the best bets to make, we will have to work a lot harder.
Generating Random Numbers
Finding a reliable source of random numbers is essential to making any
Monte Carlo simulation work. A good random-number generator pro-
duces sequences of bits that are indistinguishable from random coin ﬂips.
This is much easier said than done. Generating random numbers is one
of the most subtle and interesting problems in computer science because
seemingly reasonable solutions can have disastrous consequences.
Bad random number generators can easily cause Monte Carlo simula-
tionstogivemeaninglessresults.Forexample,supposewetriedarandom-
number generator that simply alternated heads and tails each time it was
asked for another coin ﬂip. This generator would produce a sequence of
coin ﬂips having some of the properties of a truly random sequence. For
example, the expected number of heads after n random coin ﬂips is n/2,
and that is exactly how many will be produced by our simple generator.
But compare the following sequence of 50 real random ﬂips (I used real
pennies) with this “phony random” sequence:

MONTE CARLO ON THE TUNDRA
There are signiﬁcant differences between the two sequences. First,
the real random sequence has an unbalanced number of heads and tails
(27 heads versus 23 tails). This is not surprising. In fact, 50 coin ﬂips should
end up as exactly 25 heads and 25 tails only 11.2% of the time. Likewise,
in the real random sequence there is a run of four consecutive tails. A
sufﬁciently long sequence of ﬂips should have substantial runs of consec-
utive heads or tails if it is truly random. Such counterintuitive behavior
helps explain why people are lousy at designing truly random-looking se-
quences. Many embezzlers, ballot stuffers, and quack scientists have been
caught because their data or audit trails were too “random” to hold up to
careful scrutiny.
Let’s think through the consequences of using the phony-random gen-
erator with our simulation instead of a truly random generator. No mat-
ter how many games we simulated, only two different trifecta outcomes
would ever be produced! Suppose that whenever the ﬁrst coin was heads,
we assigned player 1 to be the winner of the ﬁrst point (against player 2).
Whenever player 1 wins the ﬁrst point, this means that the next “random”
coin ﬂip will always yield a tail, and thus the winner of the second point
will always be predestined. In either case, the outcome of the ﬁrst coin
ﬂip always decides the winner of the match, and thus the results of our
simulation are completely meaningless!
How, then, do we generate truly random numbers on a computer? The
short answer is that we can’t. Computers are deterministic machines that
always do exactly what that they are programmed to do. In general, this
is a good thing, for it explains why we trust computers to balance our
checkbook correctly. But this characteristic eliminates the possibility of
looking to computers as a source of true randomness.
The best we can hope for are pseudorandom numbers, a stream of
numbers that appear as if they had been generated randomly. This is a
dicey situation. John von Neumann, the brilliant mathematician who is
credited with designing the ﬁrst modern computer, said it best: “Anyone
who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of
course, in a state of sin.”
The pseudorandom-number generation algorithm of choice generates
random numbers based on the same principle that roulette wheels use. In
a roulette wheel, we start by rolling a ball around and around and around
the outer edge of the wheel. After several seconds of motion, the ball loses
enough energy that it drops into the bottom part of the wheel and then

comes to rest in one of the 38 equal-sized, labeled compartments at the
bottom of the wheel.
Why do casinos and their patrons trust that roulette wheels generate
random numbers? Why can’t the fellow in charge of rolling the ball learn
to throw it so it always lands in the double-zero slot? The reason is that the
ball always travels a very long path around the edge of the wheel before
falling, but the ﬁnal slot depends upon the exact length of the entire path.
Even a very slight difference in initial ball speed means the ball will land
in a completely different slot.
So how can we exploit this idea to generate pseudorandom numbers? A
big number (corresponding to the circumference of the wheel) times a big
number(thenumberoftripsmadearoundthewheelbeforetheballcomes
to rest) yields a very big number (the total distance that the ball travels).
Adding this distance to the starting point (the release point of the ball)
determines exactly where the ball will end up. Taking the remainder of this
total with respect to the wheelcircumferencedeterminesthe ﬁnalposition
of the ball by subtracting all the loops made around the wheel by the ball.
This is the idea behind the linear congruential generator. It is fast and
simple and (if set with the right constants a, c, m, and R0) gives reasonable
pseudorandom numbers. The nth random number Rn is a function of the
(n−1)st random number:
Rn = (aRn−1 + c) mod m
To complete this analogy, the previous random number Rn−1 corresponds
to the starting point of the ball, and a and c dictate how hard the ball will

be thrown. Finally, m stands for the circumference of the wheel. The mod
function is just a fancy term for the remainder.
Lurking within my simulation is a linear congruential generator with
carefully chosen constants that have been shown to produce reasonable-
looking pseudorandom numbers.2 The high correlation between the dis-
tribution of observed trifectas and our simulation results gives us faith in
both our model and our random-number generator.
Passing Paper
I was a graduate student at the University of Illinois at the time I wrote this
simulation. I was living in Daniels Hall, a graduate student dorm whose
layout consisted of pairs of extremely small single rooms that shared a
one-seat bathroom between them. To say these rooms were small was
no understatement; there was no place in my room where I could stand
without being able to touch at least three walls. I had a little couch that
rolled out to be a bed, after which I could not stand regardless of how many
walls I was willing to touch. The one saving grace in the tiny room was that
my morning newspaper was delivered under my door, and I could pick it
up and read it without ever leaving my bed.
But it is the shared bathroom that is the relevant part of this story. With
two doors leading to a one-seat john, sooner or later you get to meet the
other party. That year, my bathroom-mate was a guy named Jay French, a
graduate student in the business school.
Jay went on to work for McDonnell Douglas Aerospace Corporation in
St. Louis, and I’ve lost track of him over the years (give me a call, Jay, if
you’re out there), but he is the one who gave me the nerve to publish my
jai alai results. As a future M.B.A., he had a professional interest in get-
rich-quick schemes, and thus he was intrigued when I told him about my
simulation.
“You know, I have just the place for you to publish a paper on that stuff.
The Institute of Management Sciences publishes a semipopular journal,
Interfaces. I’m a member, so they send it to me every other month. They
have lots of articles analyzing optimal strategies related to sports.”
2 An effective way to ruin any linear congruential generator is to instantiate it with the
wrong constants. Setting a = 0, c = 0 and R0 = 0 simulates ﬂipping a one-sided coin
because every “random” number produced will be 0. See Knuth’s book for a thor-
ough discussion of the subtle problem of selecting the right constants to make things
work.

He showed me a few back issues he had in his room. Daniels Hall
rooms were so small you could only store a few back issues of anything.
But indeed, there were articles whose depth and topics were comparable
to what I had done.
“Is this a respected journal?,” I asked suspiciously.
“Respected? No. But it is much less boring than the other journals they
publish.”
I took the bait and wrote up a paper with the results of my simulation.
To give it a veneer of academic respectability, I claimed the paper was a
study of the “fairness” of the Spectacular Seven scoring system. The Spec-
tacular Seven scoring system is unfair because equally skilled players have
an unequal chance of winning. I tried varying the position where dou-
ble points ﬁrst start (after the seventh point played in Spectacular Seven)
so as to discover the point that leads to the greatest equality. After sim-
ulating 50,000 games for each possible doubling point, it became clear
that doubling near the beginning of a cycle is the worst time if you want
to ensure fairness because the already favored ﬁrst or second players are
likely to be the ﬁrst to emerge or reemerge from the queue. Yet this is ex-
actly what happens with the Spectacular Seven. It would be much better
to double when the middle player is expected to leave the queue to play a
point.
You might be curious about how academic journals work. Publication
decisions are made on the basis of “peer review.” When the editor of Inter-
faces received my submitted article in the mail, he or she skimmed through
it and then came up with a list of two or three experts in the area to review
it carefully. Identifying an appropriate set of referees for my article was
probably somewhat difﬁcult because there are few other academics with
a clearly identiﬁable interest in jai alai. Instead, the editor probably sent it
to experts in simulation or mathematical issues in sport.
Refereeing is one of the chores of being an active researcher. Whenever
you submit a paper to a journal, you get your name stuck in that editor’s
database of possible future referees. It takes time to read a technical paper
carefully and write a report stating its merits and identifying its ﬂaws.
Thus, many people try to dodge the work. But peer review is the best way
to ensure that journals publish only research articles that are correct and
of high quality.
Theserefereereportsgobacktotheeditor,whousesthemtodecidethe
question of acceptance or rejection. Copies of the reports are sent to the
62

MONTE CARLO ON THE TUNDRA
author of the paper, but with the names of the referee removed. Anonymity
ensures that referees are free to speak their mind without worrying that
vengeance will be taken at a later date. Referee reports contain ideas for
improving the article, and thus even those papers recommended for ac-
ceptance are usually revised before publication.
My article, “A Fairer Scoring System for Jai-alai,” appeared in Interfaces
in November 1988. For my efforts, I received a modest amount of glory
but no money. The authors of research papers receive no payment for
their articles. To the contrary, researchers are often asked to contribute
“page charges” to help keep the journal going. A specialized academic
journal might have a circulation of only 1000 or so, which is not enough
to realize any signiﬁcant revenue from advertising. To cover the cost of
production, libraries get charged a fortune for subscriptions to academic
journals, which can run from hundreds to thousands of dollars a year.
Nevertheless, most academic journals claim to lose money. I’m not sure
I completely understand the economics of journals, but the point is that
money is tight.
This tight money issue lead to an amusing incident with this particular
paper. My Interfaces article contained several graphs of statistical data
related to fairness, which I had drawn and printed using typical late 1980s
computer equipment. The editor decided that the production quality of
my graphs was too low for publication and that I had to hire a draftsman, at
my expense, to redraw these graphs before the article would be accepted.
My original graphs looked plenty good enough to me, and besides I wasn’t
happyaboutpayingthedraftsman.SoIplayedthestarvingstudentroutine.
In my ﬁnal letter responding to the journal I wrote as follows:
Acting upon your suggestion, I found out that the university does in-
deed employ a graphics artist. Since I had no grant to charge it to, they
billed me at a special student rate. The total cost, $26.25, meant that I
only had to skip lunch for a week to pay for them. Thank you for your
help and I look forward to seeing my paper in Interfaces.
A few weeks later I received an envelope in the mail from the manag-
ing editor of Interfaces. A stack of neatly cut out coupons to McDonald’s,
Dunkin Donuts, and seemingly every other fast food chain in existence
was included. The note said
Maybe the enclosed will help you with your lunch problem. We don’t
want you to go hungry.

Perfect Evaluation
Computers are very fast and always getting faster. Instead of simulating
1,000,000 jai alai games, why not simulate 10,000,000 or more for greater
accuracy? Even better, why not simulate all possible games?
In fact, there are only a ﬁnite number of possible ways that jai alai
matches can unfold. Inherent in the Spectacular Seven scoring system is
a tree of possibilities, the ﬁrst few levels of which are shown here. The root
of the tree represents the ﬁrst point of any match, player 1 versus player 2.
Each node in the tree represents a possible game situation. The left branch
of each node means the lower-numbered player wins the point, whereas
therightbranchofeachnodemeansthatthehigher-numberedplayerwins
the point. The leaves of this tree correspond to the end of possible games,
marking when the winning player has just accumulated his seventh point.
The top of the tree representing all possible outcomes of the ﬁrst four points.
In such a tree, each path from the root to a leaf represents the sequence
of events in a particular jai alai game. For example, the leftmost path down
the tree denotes the outcome in which player 1 wins the ﬁrst seven points
to claim the match. After appropriately weighting the probability of each
path (short paths are more likely to occur than long ones) and adding these
paths up, we can compute the exact probability for each of the possible
outcomes.
Infact,Ioncegote-mailfromafellowatDigitalEquipmentCorporation
(DEC) who had built such an exact search program. His program built
65

CALCULATED BETS
the complete tree and analyzed all the possible outcomes in only a few
seconds! Compaq, the leading personal computer manufacturer, recently
bought out DEC in a multibillion dollar deal – presumably to get hold of
this proprietary jai alai technology.. . .
Why is the program so fast to play all possible jai alai matches? Be-
cause there are not so many possibilities. Moser built a program similar
to that of the DEC guy and found that this game tree had only 422,384
leaves, or different possible sequences of events, even when factoring in
the complicated tiebreaker rules. The number 422,384 is small in a world
of computers that can process billions of instructions per second. A typi-
cal run of our Monte Carlo simulation played one million random games.
This meant that we wereplayingmanypossiblesequencesmorethanonce
and presumably missing a few others. The net result is more work for the
simulation.
So if brute-force evaluation is faster and more accurate than Monte
Carlo simulation, why didn’t we use it? The primary reason was laziness.
Getting the brute force program to work efﬁciently and correctly would
have required more time and intellectual effort that the naive simula-
tion. We would have to reimplement all of those messy tiebreaking rules,
which didn’t seem like fun. Further, we would have to be careful to do our
probability computations correctly, which requires more intricacy than
the simple accumulations of the Monte Carlo simulation.
The reason we could get away with this laziness is that the Monte Carlo

of each betting outcome to within a fraction of a percent of its actual value.
For example, our original simulation results agreed with Moser’s complete
evaluation to within 0.05% on each win-place-show entry. Any betting
system that required ﬁner tolerance than this would not be in a position to
makemuchmoneyintherealworld,andthereisnoreasontolullourselves
into a false sense of security by overoptimizing one aspect of our system.
I’ve always intended to build a brute-force evaluator, but our time always
seemed better spent putting in more effort into the statistical analysis and
modeling.
The idea of constructing a tree of all possible sequences of moves is
the foundation of programs that play games of strategy such as chess. To
evaluatewhichofthecurrentmovesisthebestchoice,theprogrambuildsa
treeconsistingofallpossiblesequencesofplaytoadepthofseveralmoves.
It then makes a guess of the value of each leaf position and percolates this
information back up to the top of the tree to identify the best move.
If such a program could build the complete tree of possibilities for a
given game, as Moser did with jai alai, that program would always play as
perfectly as possible. The game tree for tic-tac-toe is small enough to be
easily constructed; indeed, a portion of this tree proving x has a win from
a given position ﬁts on a page of this book. On the other hand, the game
tree for chess is clearly too large ever to ﬁt in any imaginable computer.
Even though the computer Deep Blue recently beat the human champion
Gary Kasparov in a match, it is by no means unbeatable. The game of Go
has a game tree that is vastly bigger than that of chess – enough so that the
best computer programs are no match for a competent human.
When playing games, it is always important to pick on somebody your
own size.

CHAPTER FOUR
THE IMPACT OF THE INTERNET
Many years passed. I received my doctorate in Computer Science from the
University of Illinois with a thesis in computational geometry and found
myself a faculty position in Computer Science at the State University of
New York, Stony Brook.

even if I had published 100 articles on jai alai because this work wouldn’t
(and shouldn’t) carry much respect with the powers that be in academic
computer science.
But 6 years later I found myself a tenured Associate Professor of Com-
puterScience.Tenuregivesyouthefreedomtoworkonwhateveryouwant.
You have to teach your classes, and you have to do your committee work,
but otherwise what you do with your time is pretty much up to you. If I
wanted to devote a little effort to an interesting mathematical modeling
problem, well, nobody was going to stop me.
By now my parents had retired to Florida, and each winter my brother
Len and I would pay them a visit. Each visit included an obligatory trip
to watch jai alai, and so on January 17, 1995, we spent the evening at
the Dania fronton. On arrival, our ﬁrst action was, as always, to buy a
68

THE IMPACT OF THE INTERNET
Pepe’s Green Card. Our second step was to convince ourselves of its
infallibility.
“Pepe’s going to make us some money tonight.”
“You bet. We’ve got nothing but winners here.”
“Sure, Pepe’s making money tonight. From bagel-heads like you who
paid him good money for nothing.” Dad remained a skeptic.
“Pepe’s best bet is a 5–8–3 trifecta in Game 6. Remember when he gave
us that winning trifecta when we were kids.”
“Forget it. Pepe wins only once in a lifetime . . . .”
Game 6 started. After watching the early points play out, I looked at
our ticket and thought ahead.
“Hey, if 8 beats 7, then 1, and then 2 he will be in ﬁrst place. Player 4
can then beat 8 to stop the run. Player 3 wins the next point to move into
second. If 5 then wins his next three points, we are in business.”
Player 8 beat 7. Then 8 beat 1. Then 8 beat 2 to give him a total of ﬁve
points.
“Player 8 needs to lose this point, or else they have won the match.”
Player 4 beat 8.
“Player 3 has to win to stay ahead of 4.”
Player 3 beat 4.
“Now all we need is for 5 to run it.”
“Yeah, three more points and Pepe’s got it.”
Player 5 beat 3. My brother and I started giggling.
Player 5 beat 6. We were laughing hysterically. We didn’t even have to
watch the next point to know how it would turn out.
Player 5 beat 7.
This time the trifecta paid $148 and change. Again we took the folks
out to dinner.
Each year, during our family fronton visit, I told my parents I could win
at jai alai if only I spent the time to develop the method. They always said,
“Big shot, so go do it.” Finally I couldn’t come up with a good reason not
to. I came back from Florida with a suntan and a determination to move
forward with predicting jai alai matches by computer.
The Coming of the Web
To proceed with the project, I needed to provide my computer with an
extensive database of jai alai statistics and results. I needed three kinds of
information:
69

CALCULATED BETS
I Game schedules – To perform an appropriate Monte Carlo simulation, I
needed to know which players were playing, in which post positions, in
whichgames,onwhichdate.Thismeantobtainingthegameschedules
for a given fronton.
I Player records – To customize a Monte Carlo simulation for the partic-
ulars of a given match, I had to know the relative merits of the players
in each post position. This meant obtaining enough game results and
player statistics to rank the pelotaris with some level of conﬁdence.
I Payoff information – To judge if a given bet was desirable meant I
needed to know how much money each betting outcome would pay
off if it won. This meant accumulating the prices paid to bettors over
enough matches to predict the payoff without making the bet.
There seemed to be only two sources from which to get these statistics:
I Directly from the frontons – Running a pari-mutuel betting operation
is very much an information-intensive business. Clearly, frontons use
computers to compute payoffs and results; thus, I knew that all the in-
formation I wanted must have been on some computer at some time.
However, except for general season statistics, frontons had no interest
in keeping detailed records on each and every game. The public rela-
tions directors of every fronton I spoke to tried to be helpful, but they
never had more than photocopies of records for the past few nights or
old programs with last season’s general statistics.
I Directly from newspapers – Several local newspapers in Florida and
Connecticut print the results of jai alai matches each day. This means
somebody at the newspaper must type them in in the ﬁrst place. I
ﬁgured that if I could get ahold of whoever did the actual typing, I
could convince him or her to save the ﬁles for us to process.
But I was wrong. Nobody I spoke to ever kept more than a week’s
worth of data around. Local newspapers are in the business of produc-
ing newspapers and understandably could not be bothered with yes-
terday’s news. Of course, I could have gone through old printed copies
of the paper and retyped everything into the computer, but doing so for
1 or 2 year’s worth of statistics would have been too great a task to bear.
Neither of these options was tenable. The jai alai project was dead in
the water until the Internet and Worldwide Web (WWW) suddenly became
popular.
70

THE IMPACT OF THE INTERNET
As the WWW caught on, more and more companies asked themselves
what information they could provide to their potential customers. Their
ﬁrst Web page probably only had the ﬁrm’s address and phone number
and maybe a copy of the public relations brochure. Eventually, however,
someone had the imagination to say, “Hey, I can do more,” and got to work
building something interesting.
Forjai-alaifrontons,itwasano-brainerthattheyshouldprovidesched-
ules and results of play. Newspapers found the jai alai scores interesting
enough to publish each day. The more information frontons could provide
to the betting public, the more money the betting public would provide to
the frontons. Milford’s WWW site immediately started getting thousands
of hits per month and kept growing.
Frontons on the net changed everything for this project. When several
frontons started providing daily schedules and results in early 1997, we
started downloading it. Retrieving a Web page by clicking a button on
a browser such as Netscape or Internet Explorer is a simple task. It is not
muchmorecomplicatedtowriteaprogramtoretrieveagivenpagewithout
the mouse click. Using such a program, we convinced our computer to

a given fronton’s WWW site, as well as retrieve the winners of yesterday’s
matches.

night from the Websites of several frontons, including Milford, Dania, and
Miami. Dania and Milford proved the most diligent about posting this
information; therefore, all of our subsequent work was performed using
data from these frontons. Our huge database of jai alai results promised
to unlock the secrets of player skills – if only we could interpret them
correctly.
Parsing
A Holy Grail of computer science is building computer systems that
understand natural languages such as English. Wouldn’t it be great if you
could type something in like “schedule dinner with the Stark’s for next
Saturday night,” and the machine could ﬁgure out what you meant and
act accordingly?
Naturallanguageunderstandingisanextremelyhardproblemforcom-
puters – so hard that for most applications it is easier to design an artiﬁcial
language and teach people to use it instead of teaching the computer
71

CALCULATED BETS
English. This is why there are so many computer programming languages
out there such as Java, C, Pascal, and Basic.
The ﬁrst step in understanding any text is to break it into structural
elements, which is a process known as parsing. Parsing an English sen-
tence is equivalent to constructing a sentence diagram for it the way you
did in elementary school. Your English teacher wrote a grammar on the
board, probably something like the one below, and asked you to apply the
rules to decode the structure of a sentence like “the cat drank the milk.”
The power of language grammars is that many different sentences with
different meanings have the exact same underlying structure, such as “the
mechanic ﬁxed the car” or “the bookie ﬁxed the match.”
Parsing is only a ﬁrst step in the process of understanding a natural
language. Understanding means extracting meaning from a text, not just
its structure. You can parse “the glaxtron bandersnatched the thingam-
abob” using essentially the same grammar, but you don’t understand it.
Understanding implies that you know what all the individual words mean
in context, which is a difﬁcult task because the same word can mean dif-
ferent things in different sentences. Recall the distinct uses of “ﬁxed” in the
previous example. Understanding implies that you know what the context
of the discussion is. The meaning of the phrase “spit it out” differs greatly
depending on whether you are in a courtroom or a dining room.
Such complexities partially explain why it is so hard to build computers
that understand what we mean instead of what we say. People can make
these distinctions, but they don’t understand clearly enough how they do
it to explain it to a computer. The ﬁeld of artiﬁcial intelligence has attacked
this problem for 50 years now with relatively little success. The Turing test,

intelligent, asks whether a person in conversation with a machine is fooled
into thinking that he or she is talking to another human. No computer has
even come close to passing the Turing test. I do not anticipate a serious
challenge to be made in my lifetime, even though the $100,000 Loebner
Prize awaits the ﬁrst program to pass.1
Although understanding natural language is a hopeless task, parsing
some well-deﬁned artiﬁcial language is part of almost every sophisticated
computer program. This difference between parsing and understanding
language is part of the vernacular of computer science. When a program-
mer comes out of a meeting saying “I don’t understand what he is saying,”
the statement means that the programmer is confused. When a program-
mer comes out of meeting saying “I can’t parse what he is saying,” it means
that the programmer is very confused.

students how to program. Programming is best learned by doing, and the
best students are always looking for interesting projects to hone their skills
and learn new things. Properly harnessed, this youthful eagerness to build
things is a terriﬁc way for professors to get students to work for them
without pay. The trick is presenting students with a project so interesting
they are happy to work for free.
Building a parser for WWW ﬁles to support a gambling system was a
sexy enough project to catch any undergraduate worth his or her salt. I
immediately thought of the best student in my previous semester’s algo-
rithms course, Dario Vlah. He was a soft-spoken 6-foot 8-inch Croatian
with a small goatee and a tremendous eagerness to hack.
The language Dario had to parse was that which the frontons used to
report the schedules and results on the WWW. Fortunately, these ﬁles were
prepared by the fronton’s own computers and thus had a fairly regular
structure to them. For example, the start of a typical raw Milford schedule
ﬁle looked like this:
Milford Jai-alai
Afternoon Performance - Sunday July 19, 1998
1 Perhaps the most famous conversational program was Eliza, a 1960s attempt to simu-
late a Rogerian psychologist. Eliza brieﬂy fooled surprisingly many people using very
simple tricks that had nothing to do with intelligence. She met her match, however,
when paired with another program designed to mimic a psychotic paranoid. Eliza
failed to cure him but did succeed in sending a bill.

Parsing such a schedule ﬁle means breaking each line into its basic
elements. There is more subtlety to this task than immediately meets the
eye. For example, how do we know that Aja–Richard represents a pair of
teammates instead of the product of a modern, hyphenated marriage?
The answer is that the heading above the column explains that this is a
doubles match; consequently, we should be on the lookout for two players
separated by a dash. How do we know that Eggy–Fitz is the second team in
Game 3 as opposed to Game 1 or 4? We know that this particular ﬁle format
lists players for up to three games on each line and that the position of the
names on the line implies which game is meant. The ﬁrst task in parsing
such a schedule ﬁle is associating which text goes with which game –
a problem complicated by different numbers of games being played on
different days.
Each fronton posts its schedule and result information in different
formats. To build a system capable of understanding each fronton’s data,
we had to build a separate parser for each one and write the data into
a common, easy-to-understand format our analysis programs could use.
Our translated version of this schedule ﬁle looked like this:
:FRONTON: Milford

Our parser integrated certain additional information into this ﬁle. For
example, it converted the calendar date (July 19, 1998) to an absolute
date (35,994), which is precisely the number of days since January 1, 1900.
Working with absolute dates can be much easier for computers than work-
ing with calendar dates.2 For example, the absolute date 2 weeks from
this one is computed simply as 35,994 + 14 = 36,008, whereas ﬁguring it
out on a calendar requires knowing exactly how many days there are in
July. The complexity of dealing with calendar dates was one of the pri-
mary reasons for the infamous though ultimately innocuous millennium
bug.
The parser also added the uniform number of each player. We main-
tained a roster of all the players for each fronton, including their uniform
number. The parser would check that each player it found on the schedule
was on our roster and warned us if he wasn’t. After all, an unknown player
named Doubles or Afternoon probably meant that the parser got confused
in its interpretation of the ﬁle, meaning we had a bug to ﬁx rather than a
player to add.
2 Absolute dates can also be easier for people to work with. For example, to ﬁgure out
what day of the week your birthday will fall on next year, simply add 1 to the day of
the week it fell on this year, unless a leap day occurs between them (in which case you
must add 2). The reason this works is that the 365 days of a given year equals 52 7-day
weeks plus one additional day to add to the current absolute date.

In addition to schedules of who was to play, we needed to interpret the
results of previous matches. Raw results ﬁles from Milford looked like this:

never actually occurred.

Languages of the Internet: Perl and HTML
It is an interesting phenomenon that most computer scientists go through
a 5-year period early in their career when they think that computers and
programming are really, really neat. They will kill enormous amounts
of time customizing their personal computers to get everything to work
just right and learn all the arcane details of the latest programming
languages.
Students in this obsession phase are a joy to have around, largely
because their professors have long since left it. These days, I am much
more excited about ﬁnding interesting things to do with computers (like
predicting jai alai matches) than I am in dealing with an upgrade from
Windows 98 to Windows 2000. Fortunately, Dario did Windows, and a
whole lot more.
Dario was particularly eager to learn the behind-the-scenes language
that makes the Internet go, a programming language called Perl. Perl is not
as much a reﬂection of hot new technology as it is a manifestation of old
ideas freshly applicable to today’s problems.
Although the explosive growth of the Internet has clearly been the most
exciting recent development in computer technology, the dirty truth is
that it really doesn’t require much computing to make the Internet work.
Throughoutmostoftheinformationage,computersspentthebulkoftheir
time crunching numbers (like predicting the weather) or in business data
processing (doing things like payroll and accounting). Most applications
ran on expensive, mainframe computers that kept busy around the clock
and charged users for every minute of computer time.
Fast forward to today. Now millions of desks across the nation contain
personal computers, each of which is vastly more powerful than the “big
iron” of yesteryear. And what do we do with the billions of instructions
77

CALCULATED BETS
per second that we have at our disposal? We run increasingly elaborate
screen-saving programs whose shimmering images decorate our desks as
they protect the phosphors on our monitors.
The truth is that the Internet is really about communication, not com-
putation. Although the Worldwide Web has been dubbed the “World-
wide Wait” because of sluggish response times, the primary source of
these delays is not insufﬁcient processing power but the problem of too
many people trying to use too few dedicated telephone lines – all at the
same time.
An embarrassingly high percentage of the computing tasks associated
with the Worldwide Web are basic bookkeeping and simple text refor-
matting. Perl is a language designed to make writing these conversion
tasks as simple and painless as possible. Depending upon whom you be-
lieve, Perl is an acronym for either “practical extracting and reporting lan-
guage” or “pathologically eclectic rubbish lister.” The goal of its creator,
Larry Wall, was to “make the easy jobs easy, without making the hard jobs
impossible.”
Perl programs are not particularly efﬁcient, but they are particularly
short.Theyaredesignedtobewrittenquickly,pluggedinplace,andforgot-
ten. No one would think of building a Monte Carlo simulation to simulate
a million jai alai games in Perl because such high-performance number-
crunching jobs must be carefully written to utilize the machine efﬁciently.
Perl is for those quick-and-dirty, hit-and-run reformatting tasks that help
programmers untangle the Web.
One of the common text-processing tasks in which Perl scripts are
used is preparing WWW pages on demand from databases. Look up your
favorite book (ideally, look up my book) on Amazon.com or some other
on-line book dealer and you will see a customized page with the title and
publisher, a picture of the cover, reader-supplied reviews, and even the
current rank on the company’s bestsellers’ list. This WWW page was not
written by a person but a computer program that extracts the relevant
information from the database and adds formatting commands to make
it look right on the reader’s screen.
A second language of the Internet is HTML, an abbreviation for the
“hypertext markup language.” HTML is the language in which all WWW
pages are written, that is, the text spit out by Amazon.com’s Perl programs.
It really isn’t a computer programming language at all, for you can’t write
a program in HTML to do anything. This language provides a medium for
78

THE IMPACT OF THE INTERNET
an author (or computer) to specify what a WWW page should look like to
the reader.
As we saw, Milford’s schedule and results ﬁles were presented as
unexciting-to-read but simple-to-parse text ﬁles. Dania Jai-Alai was more
ambitious and used HTML formatting to present its results and schedule
ﬁles. The following portion of a Dania schedule ﬁle illustrates HTML:
<HTML>

The formatting commands of HTML appear within the angle brackets
such as <TITLE>. This portion starts by presenting the title of this page
and then speciﬁes the color of both the background and the text (the
79

CALCULATED BETS
actual colors are described by “names” like #ff0000). It then speciﬁes that a
picture named “botlogo” should be inserted, neatly centered in the middle
of the line. The schedule of each game is formatted as a table in which
each row presents the post number and the two members of each doubles
team.
This HTML formatting may seem ungainly, but you weren’t intended
to read it – your WWW browser was. It would be tedious for a person to
write all those formatting commands each day, but that was done by a
Perl program, not a person. As is the case with Amazon.com, these WWW
pages are produced by formatting the information in a database using a
straightforward computer program. Because a computer program writes
the actual HTML ﬁles, we can rely on the format to be the same day to day
without any typing or formatting errors.
My student Dario did not have access to the fronton’s private database
containing the unformatted schedule and result information. However, he
did have access to these HTML pages. By writing his own Perl program,
he could carefully strip away all that formatting the fronton’s program had
diligently inserted. He could take the remaining data and format it just as
we did with the Milford data, enabling us to add it each day to our library
of jai alai scores. Once we had amassed enough data to work with, our fun
could really begin.
Any discussion of the languages of the Internet would be incomplete
without mentioning Java. At the risk of slightly oversimplifying things, Java
is a programming language for writing programs that will run on somebody
else’s machine, typically using an Internet browser.
For example, suppose I want to put a facility on the WWW enabling
you to calculate the amount of money you will pay each month if you take
out a mortgage. I could create a WWW page that would prompt you to type
in the interest rate, loan amount, and term of the loan, then calculate the
number on my machine, and send this number to you on your machine.
Alternatively, I could write a little program in Java my machine could give
your machine, which, when run on your machine, would prompt you for
the relevant numbers and do the calculation there. This second arrange-
ment is better for me, in that it reduces the amount of interaction on my
machine, and also better for you because I don’t get to know how much
money you are thinking of embezzling from the bank.
We don’t use Java anywhere in our system because there is no program
we want to run on somebody else’s machine, and because no fronton’s

WWW site provides a program that we want to run (as opposed to data,
which we want to read). Still, Java is a good thing. In fact, it is such a good
thing that Microsoft devoted considerable energy and resources trying to
kill it.
Why Real Programmers Hate Microsoft
As the 900-pound gorilla of the software industry, Microsoft ﬁnds itself
the subject of a great deal of attention. Always welcome is the interest of
investors, whose enthusiasm has caused its stock to split each year like
clockwork. Completely unwelcome has been the interest of the Justice
Department, whose antitrust unit seeks to split the company instead of
the stock.
It is fair to say that most real computer programmers hate Microsoft,
but I’ve had a hard time explaining why to my nontechie friends. Most
computer programmers have a warm spot in their heart for high-tech
companies like Sun Microsystems, Netscape, Cisco, Apple Computer, and
even Intel, but not for Microsoft. The usual motives for hatred (jealousy,
fear, resentment) don’t really sufﬁce to explain this phenomenon:
I Jealousy – Why should I be jealous of their success? Hell, I’m proud to
say I own some stock in Microsoft – enough to make me some money
but not so much that I still can’t root against them in the marketplace.
I Fear – What do I have to fear? I’m a tenured professor of computer sci-
ence, and thus I have no reason to fear Microsoft will eat my
lunch. This is one business Microsoft has shown no evidence of get-
ting into. Indeed, Bill Gates has even donated money to Harvard and
the University of Washington for new buildings to better house their
excellent computer science departments. By the way, we could use a
new building at Stony Brook, too, Bill.
I Resentment – Sure, Microsoft can be a pushy, arrogant company to do
business with. It is well-known that no other company ever got rich
dealing with Microsoft. But I don’t have to deal with them. Some of my
favorite former students have gone on to work for them. I wish them
nothing but the best and indeed hope that they remember their alma
mater when it comes time to be looking for tax shelters.
No, the usual reasons don’t explain why real programmers hate
Microsoft. The real problem is the unhealthy degree of control Microsoft
exerts in shaping the way the rest of the computer world does business.

Its marketshare of the personal computer world is so high that it prevents
the rest of the industry from doing new and interesting things.
These are strong words, but let me make things clear. Our entire jai alai
project could never have happened if Microsoft controlled the Internet the
way it does the personal computer world.
Why? The technical foundations of the Internet are a series of software
standardsenablingdifferenthardwareandsoftwaresystemstotalktoeach
other. As long as each component adheres to the standards, everyone can
understand each other.
Back in the days when the public thought the Internet was an envi-
ronmentally unsound practice of the ﬁshing industry, the Internet was de-
signed and run by a small group of techies who had no proprietary interest
in the standards it employed. To establish a standard, you had to convince
the other techies that your standard was better than theirs through open
discussions. Eventually the community would reach a consensus, and the
standard was adopted.
The language in which WWW pages are written, HTML, is perhaps the
most familiar of these Internet technical standards. The goals of HTML
were to make it easy to read and write WWW pages. Formatting commands
areembeddedwithintherawtexttobedisplayed,describingwheretostart
paragraphs and how bold to make the titles.
Because HTML was designed as an open standard, it has no secrets
to hide. Because every WWW page is written in an easy-to-understand
language, any mortal can look at someone else’s WWW page to see how he
or she got it to look that way. This is nice. Want to know how to make a title
blink on and off? Go to the WWW page of someone whose title is blinking
and then view the source code to see how this was done. This open source
policy makes it easy to learn from others, which is clearly a good thing for
the entire community.
Our jai alai project got off the ground precisely because HTML is an
open source language. Sure, the frontons that posted schedules and re-
sults each day only intended for these ﬁles to be viewed on the screen by
potential bettors. However, because we were able to get the original HTML
source ﬁles and parse them easily, we could understand the structure of
the data they encoded. Because everything was open, clear, and consis-
tent, we could write a parser to extract the information we wanted from
each ﬁle and thus gather the statistics we needed. Although the potential
of such open source documents was certainly not forseen by the frontons,
82

THE IMPACT OF THE INTERNET
it proved to be in their interest because we have placed a substantial num-
ber of bets with them via our program. The open standard enriches all by
encouraging new ideas and applications.
Now let us return to Microsoft. It is the purveyor of the most dominant
operating system in the world, running on 97% of all personal computers.
Because Microsoft controls the software on the bulk of the machines out
there, it is in a position to enforce whatever standards it wishes. Suppose
Microsoftweretocomeoutwithanewstandard“Microsoft-HTML,”which
its software used instead of real HTML. If you wanted your WWW page
visible on 97% of the computers in the world, you would have to make it
work with the Microsoft product. If you wanted to view all these WWW
pages, you had better buy the Microsoft product because it is the only
company supporting this new standard.
This creates two serious problems:
I Quality and consensus are no longer part of the standards process –
ThereisnoinherentreasontheMicrosoftstandardhastobetechnically
bettertotriumphinthemarketplace.Englishisnotaninherentlybetter
language than Serbo–Croatian, but because it is the standard more
people write books in English than Serbo–Croatian. Because Microsoft
has a monopoly, it can do whatever it pleases, and produce the de facto
standard. With the appropriate changes to Microsoft Word, we could
all be forced to write in hieroglyphics.
Whenever another company comes up with a new or better idea
for a standard, Microsoft always chooses to “embrace and extend” the
standard, as it has done with Sun Microsystem’s programming lan-
guage Java. But this is the embrace of death, because these extensions
serve primarily to make Microsoft’s version incompatible with the rest
of the world.
I Microsoft has incentive to make its standards as obscure as possible –
AMicrosoftstandardanalagoustoHTMListheﬁleformatforMicrosoft
Word.Bothprovidewaystoformattexttomakeitlookthewayyouwant
it to. But is the Microsoft standard open?
Microsoft assumes that its users don’t care what technical stan-
dards are used behind the hood – they just want to get their job done.
Indeed, Microsoft products are great if you want to do exactly what
Microsoft wants you to do. But can you take someone else’s Word ﬁle
anduseittoﬁgureouthowtomakeyourWorddocumentlooklikethat?
83

CALCULATED BETS
No, because the Word ﬁle format does not produce human-readable
source. If you try to view a raw Word ﬁle on your screen, it will produce
countless beeps and strings of gobledygook because of the machine-
only control characters. You would learn nothing by reading it even if
you could.
This problem is compounded because, instead of seeking clarity,
Microsoft has an actual incentive to use as obscure and proprietary
standards as possible. The Word ﬁle standard is deﬁned by exactly
what Microsoft’s program reads. Why should Microsoft want to make
it easier for other companies to use this format? Better you should be
stuck using Microsoft-only software! Sure, technological and business
opportunities will be lost because our standards are so restrictive, but
they are lost primarily to the other guy.
So, what can be done about Microsoft? Either it is going to have to learn
some manners, or else the real programmers of the world will eventually
have to surrender. The former doesn’t seem likely to happen unless the
Justice Department succeeds in breaking up the company. The latter is
highly undesirable because, frankly, it is the real programmers of the world
who contribute the innovations for Microsoft to “embrace and extend.”
And it seems so unnecessary. Other corporations, like Sun Microsystems,
have carved out very nice businesses while technically doing the right
thing.
That, and not jealousy, is the reason real programmers hate Microsoft.

CHAPTER FIVE
IS THIS BUM ANY GOOD?
Everymorningat2 A.M.,asprofessorssleepandgraduatestudentsarriveto
pull all-nighters, my computer diligently makes the rounds of the Websites
of all major frontons, downloading the latest schedules and results and
then running these ﬁles through Dario’s parsing programs. After a few
months of retrieval we had built a large-enough collection of jai alai data to
justifysomeseriousanalysis.Ourgoalwastouseallthisdatatomeasurethe

To get this job done, I had to bring another student on to the project,
Meena Nagarajan. Meena was a different type of student than Dario. As a
married woman with a young child, she realized that there are other things
to life besides computers. She was returning to school to get her master’s
degree with the express goal of getting a lucrative job with a ﬁnancial
services company associated with Wall Street, as indeed she ultimately
did. She realized that building a program-trading system for jai alai was a
great way to learn how to build one for trading stocks, and she therefore
signed on to work on the project.
Her undergraduate degree back in India was in applied mathem-
atics; thus, she brought to the table an understanding of the meaning
and limitations of statistics.

Probability versus Statistics
Probability and statistics are related areas of mathematics that concern
themselves with analyzing the relative frequency of events. Still, there are
fundamental differences in the way they see the world:
I Probability deals with predicting the likelihood of future events,
whereas statistics involves the analysis of the frequency of past
events.
I Probability is primarily a theoretical branch of mathematics that stud-
ies the consequences of mathematical deﬁnitions. Statistics is pri-
marily an applied branch of mathematics that tries to make sense of
observations in the real world.
Both subjects are important, relevant, and useful. But they are differ-
ent, and understanding the distinction is crucial in properly interpreting
the relevance of mathematical evidence. Many a gambler has gone to a
cold and lonely grave for failing to make the proper distinction between
probability and statistics.
This distinction will perhaps become clearer if we trace the thought
process of a mathematician encountering a craps game for the ﬁrst
time:
I If this mathematician were a probabilist, he or she would see the dice
and think, “Six-sided dice? Presumably each face of the dice is equally
likely to land face up. Now assuming that each face comes up with
probability 1/6, I can ﬁgure out what my chances are of crapping
out.”
I If, instead, a statistician wandered by, he or she would see the dice and
think, “Those dice may look OK, but how do I know that they are not
loaded? I’ll watch a while, and keep track of how often each number
comes up. Then I can decide if my observations are consistent with
the assumption of equal-probability faces. Once I’m conﬁdent enough
that the dice are fair, I’ll call a probabilist to tell me how to play.”
In summary, probability theory enables us to ﬁnd the consequences
of a given ideal world, whereas statistical theory permits us to to measure
the extent to which our world is ideal.
Modern probability theory emerged from the dice tables of France
in 1654. Chevalier de M´er´e, a French nobleman, wondered whether the

playerorthehousehadtheadvantageinavariationofthefollowingbetting
game.1 In the basic version, the player rolls four dice and wins provided
none of them are a six. The house collects on the even money bet if at least
one six appears.
De M´er´e brought this problem to attention of the French mathemati-
cians Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat, most famous as the source of
Fermat’s last theorem. Together, these men worked out the basics of prob-
ability theory and established along the way that the house wins the basic
version
with
probability
p = 1 −(5/6)4 ≈0.517,
where
the
prob-
ability p = 0.5 denotes a fair game in which the house wins exactly half the
time.
ThejaialaiworldofourMonteCarlosimulationassumesthatwedecide
the outcome of a point between two teams by ﬂipping a suitably biased
coin. If this world were reality, our simulation would compute the correct
probability of each possible betting outcome. But all players are not cre-
ated equal, of course. By doing a statistical study of the outcome of all the
matches involving a particular player, we can determine an appropriate
amount to bias the coin.
But such computations only make sense if our simulated jai alai world
is a model consistent with the real world. John von Neumann once said
that “the valuation of a poker hand can be sheer mathematics.” We have
to reduce our evaluation of a pelotari to sheer mathematics.

alyze such statistics to measure the best current player? It needs to be a
long enough time for the totals to be statistically signiﬁcant i.e., for such

random events as off-days and lucky bounces to cancel themselves out.
And yet it cannot be too long a time interval, for certain player’s skills will
improve with training and experience whereas those of others erode with
injury and aging.
There is clearly anecdotal evidence that certain jai alai players are
betterthanotherplayers.Joey,perhapsthegreatestAmericanjaialaiplayer
ever, led the Dania fronton in wins an amazing eight consecutive seasons
from 1985 to 1989. (There are two seasons per year.) A look at the top
10 players at any fronton will reveal many names in common with the list
from the previous year.
Table 5.1 shows signiﬁcant variation in the success rate of players at
Milford in 1998. Lander (a big star) won 16.3% of his games that year, which
is a rate close to double that of Alberto (9.8%). Aragues was in the money
(win, place, or show) 42.1% of the time, whereas the supporters of Tino
were rewarded on only 32.9% of show bets.
Most Americans have a ﬁnely developed statistical sense about base-
ball. Let’s use that sense to gain better intuition about the impact of player
skills in jai alai. Baseball batting averages are well known to be mean-
ingful statistics; indeed, a .300 hitter is the classical deﬁnition of a star
player. Achieving a .300 average means that you managed to get 3 hits
every 10 times at bat. Players’ batting averages ﬂuctuate over the season
because they have good and bad games. So how successful is a player’s
current batting average at predicting how he will do in the future?
I will use batting averages from 1996 and 1997 to get a handle on
this situation by building a scatterplot of the data (see Figure 5.1). Each
data point represents the statistics of one particular player. Each of the
major league baseball players who played regularly in both 1996 and 1997
(deﬁned as at least 400 at bats each season) is represented by an (x, y)
point, where x is the 1996 average and y is the 1997 average.
Let’s think about what this means. If baseball players were completely
consistent year to year, the two values would be identical, meaning that
each point would lie perfectly on the diagonal line y = x. If batting av-
erages were completely random and one year’s performance completely
independent of the next year’s performance, these points would jump
around like the darts we threw at Picasso’s painting.
What my scatterplots show is that batting averages are fairly consistent
from year to year. Eyeballing both the left (American League) and right

1997 Averages
Consistency of batting averages between 1996 and 1997 for American and National
League regulars.
(National League) plots shows that the points drift upward and to the left,
indicating that players who did well in 1996 also tended to do well in 1997.
Of course there are exceptions, ﬂashes in the pan like Bernard Gilkey (who
collapsed from .317 to .249), aging stars like Ellis Burks (who faded from
.344 to .290), and developing youngsters like Delino DeShields (who grew
from .224 to .295). But the exceptions seem equally likely to be above the
line y = x as below it.
How well a line ﬁts the data is measured by a statistic called the corre-
lation coefﬁcient. When two sequences are completely related, their cor-
relation coefﬁcient is 1. When two sequences are completely unrelated,
such as the price of tea in China against the ratings for the David Letter-
man show, the correlation coefﬁcient is zero. The correlation coefﬁcients
are 0.588 for the American League data and 0.518 for the National League
data. Correlation coefﬁcients are not probabilities, and these are high val-
ues.Thus,theymeasurewhatweexpect,thatthisseason’sbattingaverages
are a good predictor for next year’s.2
Now let us see how consistent jai alai player win percentages are across
time. My next scatterplot gives the win percentages (the ratio of wins to

the right, thus denoting a positive correlation. The correlation coefﬁcients
of 0.492 and 0.468, respectively, are slightly lower than the correlation of
batting averages, meaning that this statistic is just slightly less useful in
predicting future performance.
What is an example of sporting performance somewhat less consistent
than that of jai alai players? How about major league pitching? The earned
run average (ERA), the ratio of runs allowed to innings pitched, is consid-
ered to be the most reliable statistical measure of pitching skill. I created
scatterplots for the 36 American League and 35 National League pitchers
who threw at least 100 innings in both 1996 and 1997.
The correlation coefﬁcient for American League pitchers was only
0.386, whereas the NL pitchers were somewhat more consistent at 0.503.
These numbers reﬂect conventional baseball wisdom. Although “baseball
is 90% pitching” and “you can never have too much pitching,” teams are
3 Note that as we aggregate more positions, our “in the money” statistic becomes pro-
gressively less informative. Indeed, the probability that a player ﬁnishes in the top
eight of a given game correlates perfectly from year to year – because every player
always ﬁnishes in the top eight of every game! This is a good example of why we must
be careful in analyzing statistics, for even high correlation coefﬁcients must be taken
with a grain of salt.

These numbers tell us something important about jai alai players. Star
jai-alai players dominate their sport to about the same degree as star base-
ballplayers.Anyreasonablesystemforpredictingbaseballgamesaccounts
for the difference in quality between the two team’s players. Therefore, our
system has to factor in the abilities of the players, not just post positions.
Estimating Player Skill from Statistics
How can we construct a useful measure of player skill from published
statistics? We can’t just use a player’s win or in-the-money percentage, or
evensomecombinationofthetwo,asthismeasure.Weneedsomenumber
we can stick in our Monte Carlo simulation to tell us what the probability
is that a given player (or team) P1 beats another player (or team) P2. The
number of game wins is, by itself, fairly meaningless in terms of point
wins. This is like using total wealth to estimate yearly salary. Sure, there
is some correlation, but retired people and professional heirs have large
wealth with no earned income, whereas compulsive gamblers can have
large salaries but no wealth. We needed a way to estimate the point-win
percentages accurately to enable our system to accumulate wealth.

Ideally, frontons would publish statistics on each player’s point-win
percentage, and thus we could use them directly. In fact, such statistics are
kept but not published. The assignments of players to post positions are
made by the fronton’s player-manager, who traditionally handicaps the
best players by putting them in the less desirable post positions. Player-
managers keep track of point-win statistics to help in scheduling compet-
itive matches, but unfortunately they keep these statistics to themselves.
So what information do we have at our disposal? Via the Internet, we
have the schedules and results for all the games each player has played for
the past year. For each player in every game, we know that player’s initial
postpositionandwhetherheﬁnishedﬁrst,second,orthird.Unfortunately,
the published results don’t give the rest of the order, that is, the scores of
players who don’t win money.
It would be impractical for us to watch and tabulate the points scored
by real jai alai players. But we can watch simulated players and see what
happens to them. We played 1,000,000 simulated jai alai games and kept
track of what every player scored from each starting position. We broke
these down into a table of the points scored by simulated players (each
of whom has equal likelihood of scoring) according to what post position
they started in and where they ﬁnished. What can we observe?
I Winners score more points on average than second- or third-place
ﬁnishers, as one would expect. But the percentage of points scored by
winners varies signiﬁcantly, depending on their initial post position.

A player starting from the eighth post position has to win almost 90%
of his points, on average, to win the game. Life is considerably easier
for players starting in the ﬁrst two positions, who can win only 79% of
their points and expect to win the match.
I The ﬁrst two players can expect to be in the money even by winning
only 51.7% of their points. This means they can lose almost as often as
they win, whereas post positions 6 or 7 must win almost 2/3 of their
points to show.

Interesting. But what can we do with it? For each player in every pub-
lished game, we know which of the slots in the table he fell in. Thus, we
couldaveragetheappropriatepoint-winpercentagestogetthenumberwe
need. Suppose Monolingual had played three games, winning in position
8, placing in position 7, and losing in position 6. His point-win average
would be (89.44 + 72.05 + 31.8)/3 = 64.43%. Suppose Bilingual had the
same win-loss record but always started from position 2. His point-win
average would be (78.58 + 63.29 + 26.73) = 56.2%, which is not nearly as
much to brag about. We should be careful, however. Averaging averages
yields a meaningless number whenever the denominators are different.
Your average speed on a cross-country car trip is not the average of your
speeds in each state because you may travel far more miles in Texas than in
Delaware. Thus, we should weigh each component average appropriately

This must also be compensated for.

Yet another consideration is the trade-off between serving versus re-
ceiving. In many racket sports, the server has a considerable advantage
over the receiver. Certain tennis players, such as Goran Ivanisevic, have
rocket serves but are relatively clueless if someone manages to hit the ball
back to them. This effect in jai alai is not so pronounced. In fact, it ap-
pears that the receiving player has a small advantage over the server. This
is suggested by the minor differences between the actual results of post
positions 1 and 2 in the table on page 53. Unless you prefer a blue uniform
to a red one, the only real difference between starting in 1 or 2 is that player
1 initially serves to player 2. Because post position 2 is slightly more suc-
cessful in real life than player 1, presumably this server bias plays a small
role in the outcome.
The Beauty of Curves
Although the French philosopher Descartes is best known for his state-
ment “I think; therefore, I am,” his enduring accomplishment is Cartesian
geometry, the geometry of graphs drawn on an x–y plane. If you believe
that souls live when instantiated in the memory of a living person, you can
say of Descartes that “I graph, so he is.”
Much of mathematicssinceDescartescanbedescribedasthequestfor
simple descriptions of interesting curves. The simplest types of curves are
straight lines, which can be described on a graph using linear functions,
that is, formulas of the form y = a · x + b for given constants a and b.
Linear functions are simple to work with and very useful in describing
many aspects of the world. The linear function y = (9/5)x + 32 describes
how to convert a temperature x in degrees Celsius to the temperature y
in degrees Fahrenheit. For example, the boiling point of water is (9/5) ×
100 + 32 = 212 degrees Fahrenheit, whereas the freezing point is ((9/5) ×
0 + 32 = 32 Fahrenheit. Similar linear functions are used to convert from
inches to meters, pounds to kilograms, and euros to yen.
Although linear functions are good things, not all functions are
accurately described by straight lines.4 In particular, straight lines do a
lousy job of approximating undulating curves such as the value of the
Dow–Jones industrial average as a function of time. One way to try to pre-
dict the stock market would be to ﬁnd a curve whose shape is as close

as possible to reﬂecting past history and then to see what this function
does in the future. We could try to ﬁt the Dow–Jones average by a line, but
because a line either goes up or down, such a predictor would always be
either a bull or a bear.
To capture the more interesting shapes generated by the real world,
we need a richer vocabulary of functions. Important classes of nonlinear
functions include the following:
I Polynomials – Polynomials are the sum of functions of the form y = x c,
where c is some numerical constant. Thus, y = x 2 is a polynomial, as
is y = 4x 3.5. The number of distinct handshakes among x people is
given by the polynomial y = (x 2 −x)/2. As a “proof” by example, the
(42 −4)/2 = 6 handshakes possible among the four people (a, b, c, d )
are ab, ac, ad, bc, bd, and cd. Polynomials are generalizations of linear
functions with increasing freedom to create bumps and curves as the
degree c and number of terms get larger.
The number of possible handshakes increases with the square of
the number of hands. Conversely, the amount of light one gets from a
lamp decreases with the square of the distance, and thus moving from
10 to 20 feet away from the light leaves you with only 1/4 the degree
of illumination instead of the 1/2 you would get if this function were
linear.
I Trigonometric functions – Polynomial functions don’t oscillate up and
down forever; indeed, the number of bumps they can have is lim-
ited by their degree. However, many phenomena cycle up and down
continuously, such as the rise and fall of ocean waves and the

annual increase and decrease in temperature as summer comes and
goes.
These kinds of curves can be appropriately modeled using the sine
and cosine functions you suffered through in trigonometry. But this
is why you suffered through them, even beyond their applications in
computing the lengths of the sides of a triangle. We can ﬁt the Omaha,
Nebraska, record high and low temperatures (in Fahrenheit) for every
day of the year to appropriate sine functions. The close ﬁt between the
curves and the points shows the accuracy of the model, whereas the
high and low points on the two curves goes a long way in explaining
why I’d be very reluctant to live in Omaha.
Different trigonometric functions are distinguished by their period
(how rapidly do they alternate up and down?), amplitude (how high
and low do they get?), and phase (where on each cycle does it start go-
ing up?). In fact, all interesting periodic curves can be constructed as
the sum of trigonometric functions using a technique called Fourier
analysis, and combining trigonometric functions with polynomials
and other shapes opens up a new world of strange and wonderful
curves.

I Exponentials – Some things go up faster than any straight line or even
polynomial. Think of the growth of the Internet, at least in the early
days. For a while, the number of Websites was doubling every few
months according to a function like y = 2x, where x is the number
of seasons since the invention of the Web.
Such multiplicative growth (or decline) deﬁnes an exponential
function. Compound interest is the classic example of a function that
grows exponentially. The value D ′ of D dollars accruing interest at a
rate of r for y years is given by the formula
D ′ = D (1 + r)y
Compound interest really adds up. Perhaps you recall the story of Peter
Minuet, who bought the island of Manhattan from the Indians for $24
in 1626. Sharp New Yorker that he was, he even convinced the sellers
to invest the money at an annual interest rate of only 6% (r = 0.06).
Charting the progress of this investment over the course of the next
300 years shows that, as of this writing, the tribe has to make do with
only $70 billion or so. This chart illustrates the most important charac-
teristic of exponential functions, namely consistent explosive growth.
Note that the shape of growth in each century is identical even as the
totals always rapidly increase.
The explosive growth of exponentials brings up an important point.
They can’t be sustained. Within a few thousand years, the Indian in-
vestors above will have a dollar for every atom in the universe. Just try
paying them off in small or even large bills! One wag used the sharp
increase (10, 100, 1000, . . .) in the number of Elvis impersonators in the
late 1970s to predict that by the late 1980s all U.S. males would sound
and dress like the King. As with Elvis sightings, exponential functions
are to be had wherever you look. But catch them quickly, before they
leave the building.

automaton whose resulting patterns look astonishingly like leopard
skin.
Fractals are curves that have certain self-reference properties. Zoom
in on any portion of a fractal curve, and what you see will look sus-
piciously like the same curve at a larger scale. An interesting example
of a fractal is Koch’s snowﬂake curve. Start from a triangle and raise
a triangular bump in each edge. Now repeat again with each edge of
the new curve. And keep repeating. The results of this procedure look
astonishingly like a snowﬂake even at arbitrary levels of magniﬁcation.
Such snowﬂake curves would be impossible to represent using the
other mathematical functions have described. The uncanny resem-
blances between fractal curves and certain natural phenomena have
led many to speculate on the birth of a new physics and the fractal
geometry of nature. But certainly they provide an interesting tool with
which to construct exciting new shapes.
Polynomials, exponentials, trigonometric functions, fractals – all these
mathematically simple-to-describe curves are good for representing
different families of shapes. Seventeenth-century mathematics was a gold
rush of identifying and naming new families of curves and investigating
their properties; they were given colorful names after their discoverers
such as the ovals of Cassini, the witch of Agnesi, and the brachistocrone of
Bernoulli.

The ﬁrst three iterations of the Koch snowﬂake curve.
The mathematical curves and surfaces they developed include many
shapes of great beauty. Most university mathematics departments main-
tain collections of three-dimensional models of particularly interesting or
important functions. Man Ray, the surrealist photographer, was intrigued
by these mathematical shapes and wrote that “the formulas accompany-
ing them meant nothing to me, but the forms were as varied and authentic
as any in nature.” Today, these models are being augmented with fan-
tastic computer graphics imagery appearing both in textbooks and on
T-shirts.
I conclude this digression to explain why I made it in the ﬁrst place. In
the next section, I will present our quest for a curve which, had I discovered
it in the seventeenth century, might have been called the cesta of Skiena.

the next point against Alberto. What is the probability that Lander wins
the point?
This is a curious problem worth thinking about. Given that player A
wins Pr(A) of his points played against everybody, and player B wins Pr(B)
of his points played against everybody, what is the probability Prob(A, B)
that A beats B?
The answer must depend upon the nature of the contest. Suppose we
want to predict the outcome of a battle of brute strength in which the
stronger fellow always crushes the weaker one. Then the answer is simple.
The probability that A beats B, Prob(A, B), equals 1 if Pr(A) is bigger than
Pr(B), and 0 if Pr(A) is less than Pr(B). But what about a more subtle sport
in which upsets can occur, such as college basketball? This straightforward
solution would clearly be inadequate.
In mathematical modeling, there are typically several different ways
to approach a given problem. Good taste dictates that we consider the
properties we want our solution to have and then ﬁnd a function that does
the job. Relevant properties for our points modeling problem include the
following:
I Integrity – It is important that Prob(A, B) be a real probability value,
which means it must always lie between 0 and 1. The value of 0 means
that A never defeats B, whereas a value of 1 makes A unbeatable. You
wouldbesurprisedhowoftensimple,reasonable-lookingfunctionsfail
to yield real probabilities. For example, consider Prob(A, B) = Pr(A) −
Pr(B).ThisyieldsnegativevalueswheneverP(A)islessthanP(B),which
would be impossible for a probability value. Things can’t happen less
often than never!
I Symmetry – It makes sense that the probability that A wins should
equal the probability that B loses. In other words, Prob(A, B) =
1 −Prob(B, A).
I Monotonicity – A function f is monotonically increasing if x ≥y
implies that f (x) ≥f (y) for all x and y. Our function should have
certainmonotonicityproperties,namelythatProb(A′, B) ≥Prob(A, B)
if Pr(A′) ≥Pr(A). Out of monotonicity and symmetry, we get for
free . . .
I Equality – If Pr(A) = 0.45 and Pr(B) = 0.45, then it makes sense that
A and B should have an equal chance of winning whenever they play
each other. Thus, whenever Pr(A) = Pr(B), Prob(A, B) = 1/2.

I Generality – We have seen that different types of contests will yield
different types of functions. It is useful for our solution to consist of a
function with a “fudge factor” that enables us to change the shape of
the curve easily so that it is applicable in many different situations.
I Simplicity – Point scoring looks like it should be a simple problem,
and thus we would expect a simple formula to result. Of course, many
simple problems do not have simple solutions; life is a perpetual battle
between Occam’s razor and Murphy’s law.5
What was our ultimate solution? The following function satisﬁes all of
these requirements:
Prob(A, B) = 1 + [Pr(A) −Pr(B)]α

if
Pr(A) ≥Pr(B)
Prob(A, B) = 1 −[Pr(B) −Pr(A)]α

if
Pr(A) ≤Pr(B)
The constant α ≥0 is our fudge factor. Subtracting a small proba-
bility from a larger probability gives a number between 0 and 1, which

phenomenon is best. Murphy’s law is the philosophical principle that whatever can
go wrong will go wrong.

is still a probability. Raising a probability to any power α ≥0 also leaves a
probability. A large α means a small contribution from this term, whereas
a small α implies the skill difference has a large impact on the outcome.
I illustrate this effect with a set of curves representing the probability
that A will beat an average player B (i.e., Pr(B) = 1/2) as a function of six
different values of α. Each of these curves satisﬁes all of the properties
listed above. Observe how the value of α provides us with a knob to tweak
to generate a variety of different shapes from ﬂat as a pancake to steep
as a cliff. Though trial-and-error experiments, we determined that α ≈0.4
seemed to do the best job of predicting the winners of jai alai games, and
that is what we generally will use from here on out.
The Hot-Hand Phenomenon
Is it reasonable to model human jai alai players merely as automata that
output points according to a given probability distribution? We assume
that each player always scores points uniformly at random according to
his standard skill level with no correction for whether the simulated player
scored the last point. Thus, our model ignores the possibility that players
enter a mental zone in which they are unbeatable for the night or that
they can be doomed to have a rotten day because of hangovers or pulled
groins.
Certainly serious injuries will impair the performance of any athlete,
but I think it is reasonable to assume that any pelotari is physically up to
any match he plays in. If a player is not, why play and risk further injury
when there are designated backups for each jai alai game? Missing one
of 1200 games per season is not a serious problem. But our assumption
that the results are completely independent of each other may seem more
questionable. Isn’t a player more likely to play badly after being the goat
in the previous game? Conversely, any pelotari who just won three games
in a row seems like a better than average bet to go for his fourth.
However, our model is supported by some fascinating studies of the
“hot-hand” phenomenon of basketball. A time-tested strategy in basket-
ball is to go with the hot hand, the fellow on the team who just can’t seem
to miss that night. Whenever a basketball player starts shooting the lights
out, the basket looks like the opening of a dumpster to him – so big he can’t
miss. He’s got conﬁdence; he’s shaking and baking and on a roll. The rest
of the team just keeps feeding the ball to the hot hand – at least until the
hot hand cools.
104

IS THIS BUM ANY GOOD?
Soifthehothandworksforbasketball,whydoweignoreitinourjaialai
simulation?Thereasonis,surprisingly,thatitdoesn’treallyworkinbasket-
ball! In a famous article, Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky provided statistical
evidence that cast doubt on the existence of hot streaks in sports. They
examined the likelihood that a given NBA basketball player would make
the (k + 1)st shot in a row given that this player had made the last k. Careful
statistical analysis of the sequences of shots showed that they did not differ
in length from sequences that would be expected by chance alone.
But how can a phenomenon every basketball player has personally
experienced just not exist? As we previously discussed, most people have a
lousy understanding of how random sequences behave. If you make 50%
of your shots on average, then by chance you are going to have long runs of
baskets in exactly the same way a sequence of random coin ﬂips will have
long runs of tails. It is only human to feel on a roll when this happens, but
it is a natural consequence of general shooting accuracy.
These counterintuitive results have sparked considerable debate, and
follow-up studies provide some support for the concept of streaks in golf
putting and professional pool. But in the absence of compelling evidence
the other way, I am much happier using the simpler mathematical model
of independence between games instead of trying to account for a phe-
nomenon that may not even exist.
Correlation versus Causation
In a previous section, we used correlation coefﬁcients to justify our as-
sumptionthatwecanusepastresultstopredictfutureplayerperformance.
One of the tricky aspects of analyzing statistical data is distinguishing
between correlation and causation. Two factors are correlated whenever a
change in one of the sequences suggests that there will be a change in the
other. Weight and height are well-correlated sequences in people. Tall peo-
ple are likely to be heavier than shorter people. Education and income are
also typically correlated. For the most part, people with greater education
earn more money than those with less.
Properly interpreting correlations can be difﬁcult. My favorite example
isthattheamountoneexercisescorrelatespositivelywiththeprobabilityof
dying from cancer. Does this mean that exercise causes cancer? Of course
not! It means that everybody dies of something. The physically ﬁt are at
increased risk of dying from a disease of old age (such as cancer) because
they are at a decreased risk of an early death.
105

CALCULATED BETS
A sequence x has a causal relation to y if a change in the value of x is
likely to impact the value of y. An example of a well-known causal rela-
tionship is that between interest rates and the price of stocks. Whenever
interest rates rise, investors pull their money out of stocks to take ad-
vantage of this development, and stock prices drop. When interest rates
decrease, investors take their money out of the bank and buy something
that yields more of a return – typically stocks. Thus, not only are the se-
quences inversely correlated, but there is a reason for it – an honest causal
relationship.
Two sequences can have high correlation without having a causal re-
lationship between them. Consider the well-known connection between
the winner of the Super Bowl and the fate of the stock market. The Super
Bowl, held each January, pits the winner of the American Football Confer-
ence (AFC) against that of the National Football Conference (NFC). The
stock market seems to be positively correlated with the fate of the NFC.
When the NFC wins, the market goes up for the year, and when it loses the
market goes down for the year. Since the Super Bowl began in 1967, this
relationship has held an impressive 28 of 32 year, or 87.5% of the time.
If there was a causal relationship between the Super Bowl and the stock
market, then we would be well justiﬁed in investing our money based on
the outcome of the game. However, I for one am conﬁdent that this phe-
nomenonisjustavagaryofchance,aconsequenceofthefactthatspurious
correlationsarecertaintoemergewheneverenoughpairsofsequencesare
analyzed.
However, deciding whether a causal relationship between two factors
really exists can be a very tricky business – indeed it can literally be a
religious war. Consider the question of whether the Almighty acts on the
prayers of the faithful. Countless people swear that the Lord heard their
prayers and saved them. However, no statistical study worthy of the name
has ever been able to convince nonbelievers. Is there a causal relation
between faith and cure? What is the efﬁcacy of prayer?
Anotoriousrecentcaseisthatofthe“Biblecode,”mysteriousmessages
apparently embedded in the Hebrew scriptures. A best-selling book by
M. Droshin reported on patterns in the Torah (the ﬁrst ﬁve books of the
Bible) that predicted the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin and also encode
other historical facts that would have been impossible for the authors of
the books to know at the time. Unless of course, the authors of the Bible
were divinely inspired . . .
106

IS THIS BUM ANY GOOD?
This religious implication makes it impossible to convince any true
believer that no causal relationship exists between divine authorship and
the validity of the codes. Skeptics of the codes have instead focused on
disproving the observed correlation instead of arguing against the causal
relationship. By carefully analyzing the statistics associated with these ob-
served patterns, they have convincingly shown the occurrences of them to
be consistent with expectations in random texts. Indeed, they have found
several amusing examples of “codes” in such holy scriptures as Moby Dick
and War and Peace.

are fairly typical numbers. Each matrix presents the probabilities for each
possible matchup between pairs of players.
The two matrices differ because they were generated with different
values of the fudge factor α. The matrix on top used α = 1.0, a very gentle
skewing that actually reduces the degree of difference between these par-
ticular players. The bottom matrix used α = 0.4, which our experiments
suggest makes the simulation most accurately reﬂect reality.
Using the appropriate such matrix within a Monte Carlo simulation
should yield reasonably accurate predictions of the outcome of jai alai
matches. But that alone is still not enough information to venture an in-
telligent wager on the match. We must be able to estimate accurately what
our payoff will be if we win. This requires that we delve much deeper into
the economics of jai alai.
108

CHAPTER SIX
MODELING THE PAYOFFS
Economists are very concerned with the concept of market efﬁciency.
Markets are efﬁcient whenever prices reﬂect underlying values. Market
efﬁciency implies that everyone has the same information about what is
available and processes it correctly.
The question of whether the jai alai bettors’ market is efﬁcient goes
straight to the heart of whether there is any hope to make money betting
on it. All of the information that we use to predict the outcome of jai alai
matches is available to the general public. Because we are betting against
the public, we can only win if we can interpret this data more successfully
than the rest of the market. We can win money if and only if the market is
inefﬁcient.
Analyzing market efﬁciency requires us to build a model of how the
general public bets. Once we have an accurate betting model, we can
compare it with the results of our Monte Carlo simulation to look for inef-
ﬁciencies. Any bet that the public rates higher than our simulation is one
to stay away from, whereas any bet that the simulation rates higher than
the public represents a market inefﬁciency potentially worth exploiting.
The issue of market efﬁciency rears its head most dramatically in the
stock market. Billions of dollars are traded daily in the major markets
by tens of thousands of people watching minute-by-minute stock ticker
109

CALCULATED BETS
reports. Quantitative market analysts (the so-called quants) believe that
there are indeed inefﬁciencies in the stock market that show up as statisti-
cal patterns. Companies like D. E. Shaw and Renaissance Technology hire
large teams of people with training like mine to perform analyses to ﬁnd
such patterns to invest in and exploit.
But are these patterns really present, and are they large enough to
exploit? Many knowledgeable people believe that the behavior of the stock
market is essentially random walk that is totally unpredictable. If so, it
means these market inefﬁciencies don’t really exist. And if they do exist,
they will not exist for long. The quants have taken their beatings along
the way.
Why should the situation be any different in jai alai than the stock
market? My sense is that the average dollar in jai alai is spent in a less
informed way than one invested in the stock market. I have never seen
anyone hanging off the railing at the New York Stock Exchange yelling
“You stink, ATT!” or “Miss it, TXN!” If the average bettor trusts oracles like
Pepe’s Green Card or knows as little about jai alai as I did before beginning
this study – well, there are bound to be plenty of market inefﬁciencies. All
we had to do was ﬁnd them.
Pari-Mutuel Wagering
Accurately modeling payoffs requires us to face the question of exactly
how the fronton makes its money. Running a professional jai alai fronton
is an expensive proposition and involves several hundred people. Each
fronton has a stable of at least 30 professional players who insist on being
paid, as do the cashiers, cleaning people, management, and stockhold-
ers. Admission to a fronton costs only a few bucks; consequently, even
1500 paying spectators per match do not provide much of a revenue
stream.
Much more than by selling tickets, refreshments, and copies of Pepe’s
Green Card, frontons make their money by taking a cut of the betting
action. Jai alai frontons in the United States operate under the pari-mutuel
system. Developed by a Frenchman, Pierre Ollier, in the middle of the
nineteenth century, the pari-mutuel (“wagers among ourselves”) system
dispenses with odds makers who use their judgment to decide how much
a given wager should pay. Ollier owned a perfume shop in Paris and de-
veloped his system in reaction to losing too much of his own money to
bookies. Instead, all of the money wagered on the given type of bet is put
110

MODELING THE PAYOFFS
into a single pool to be divided equally among the winning bets. However,
before it is divided up, a house cut of roughly 20% is extracted from this
pool and taken by the fronton (and its partner, the state government.)
Let’s see an example of the system in action. Suppose the following
amounts of money were bet on each of the eight possible winning out-
comes:
Position
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
Amount Bet
$10
$20
$25
$40
$25
$20
$0
$10
The total amount of money in the pool is $150. After the house deducts
its 20% cut, the pool is left with $120 in it. Suppose that number 1 wins
the match. The payoff will be $120/$10 = $12 per dollar invested on the
winner, and thus a bet of $3 would pay off $36.00. If number 4 had won the
match, the payoff per dollar would be only $3, and thus a $3 bet would pay
off $9.00. The odds reported in the newspaper or on the tote board refer to
the amount paid off on the house’s minimum allowable bet – typically $2
or $3.
Now suppose number 7 had won the match. Because no one bet any
money on this possibility, typically the price of all win tickets would be
refunded, although the exact policy depends upon local rules. This is a
rare but not unheard of event; it occasionally happens in very early or late
matches that have fewer customers.
Dividing up the place and show pools is a somewhat more complicated
process. After the house extracts its cut, it sets aside an amount equal
to the amount bet on all winning entries from the pool, and thus each
winning bettor is assured of getting back at least his or her initial stake.
The remaining money is split into equal-sized pools, one for each of the
two (for place) or three (for show) different paying numbers. Each of these
pools is divided among the dollars bet on the given number and returned
along with the initial stake. Thus, the two different place payoffs in any
match are usually different. In the example on page 76, 8 to place paid off
at $16.50 whereas 4 to place paid only $9.90. Signiﬁcantly more money was
bet on 4 to place; consequently, its half of the pool had to be shared among
more bettors.
In addition to the 15–20% deducted from the pool as house advantage,
the fronton also proﬁts from the breakage, the odd cents left over when
dividing the pool. For reasons of either convenience, tradition, or greed,
111

CALCULATED BETS
all payoffs at the track or fronton are given as multiples of 10 cents. You see
payoffs of $14.40, but not $14.47. So what happens to that extra $0.07 per
winning ticket whenever the pool works out that way? The answer is that
it is deducted as breakage and is split between the state and the fronton
according to prevailing local laws. These pennies certainly add up. The
breakage works out to, on average, a nickel per winning ticket, thus adding
another percentage point or two to the house advantage. This nickel works
out as a lower percentage of exotic bets such as trifecta, because it is a
negligible fraction of the payoff, but represents a more serious cut of the
win, place, and show payoffs.
The computers used today crunch out these payoff computations in
a fraction of a second. Thus, payoff results are typically posted within a
minute of the completion of each match, which is somewhat faster than in
years past. But in those precomputer days, the money counting and pool
computations had to be done by hand. That they were performed quickly
and accurately enough to satisfy impatient and suspicious gamblers was
a feat worthy of our respect.
There are several interesting implications of the pari-mutuel system.
First, the exact payoffs for any bet are not known to anybody in advance.
To estimate the payoff you will receive, you really have to know how other
people are betting. For this reason, every fronton or racetrack has an elec-
tronicscoreboardormonitorthatﬂashesthecurrentoddsforeachpossible
wager. Many “professional” gamblers make a careful study of the odds
board and place their bet at the last possible minute, investing in players
who seem undervalued by the rest of the betting population. Observe the
difference from casino games, for you always know that a correct bet on
black in roulette pays off at two-to-one regardless of how many other peo-
ple have also invested on black.
Because of the pari-mutuel system, every bettor can theoretically pick
the winner in jai alai, and the fronton still makes money.1 This is not
true of casinos and to my way of thinking makes frontons much friendlier
places than casinos. Frontons want you to bet, whereas casinos want you
to lose.
1 This isn’t completely true because many states guarantee bettors a minimum return
(say 10%) on every winning bet, which would have to come from the house if every-
body picked the same winner. This would be an unheard of situation in jai alai. Such
minus pools do arise occasionally in horse racing – typically when a wonder horse
goes up against thoroughly inadequate competition.

Thismayseemameaninglessdistinctionbecausecasinooddsaresufﬁ-
ciently stacked against you that the more you bet, the more you are almost
certaintolose.However,itshowsupclearlyinhowthehousedealswithsys-
tems bettors. Every casino employs a large security staff with sophisticated
surveillance equipment who watch any successful bettor’s every move. If
the security force ﬁnds you using any forbidden equipment (like a com-
puter in your shoe) or any successful mathematical technique (like card
counting in blackjack), you will be tossed out on your rear hard enough to
know never to come back.
Now conversely, suppose I showed up at the fronton with my laptop
computer and a system guaranteed to make money betting on jai alai.
Management would welcome me with open arms. The house keeps 20%
of everything I wager, and I must spend money to make money. If I were
successful, I would just be taking money from other bettors, but this is
none of the fronton’s concern.
Ollier’s pari-mutuel system caught on quickly in France but was ini-
tially unpopular in the United States because bettors then (as now) wanted
to be able to bet on long shots that paid off (if successful) at high odds.
Under the pari-mutuel system, whenever many people bet on a long shot,
it ceases to be one. Other bettors feared that the house would manipulate
the calculations to skim off more than their allotted share.
Once the tide started shifting against them, bookmakers tried to com-
petebypayingoffatthesameoddsasthoseoftheracetrack,withtheadded
advantage that your bets would not depress the payoffs as they did when
you bet at the track. Sharpies took advantage of the situation by investing
relatively small amounts of money at the track on everything except the
horse they wanted and then large amounts at the bookie on their favorite.
Their preliminary wagers skewed the small pool so that their real horse
paid off at greatly inﬂated odds, which the bookie then had to match. One
by one, these bookies were put out of business, and now the pari-mutuel
system reigns throughout horse racing and jai alai.
Estimating the Payoffs
Being able to pick winners in jai alai is not enough to make money. We
need to be able to pick them better than other people.
Remember that glorious 4–2–1 trifecta triumph my brothers and I had
via Pepe’s Green Card. Sure, Pepe picked a winner, and we had a proﬁtable
evening. But the trifecta payoff of $124.60 for a $2 bet represents a terrible
113

CALCULATED BETS
return on investment when we factor in risk. Essentially we got back $60
for every $1 we bet for successfully picking a 336-to-1 shot.
Why was the payoff so low? Every yutz who bought a Pepe’s Green Card
that night probably bet on the same 4–2–1 trifecta, which tremendously
dampened the odds. The ﬁnal payoff probably would have been three or
four times higher without the inﬂuence of Pepe’s disciples. Although it is
impossible to predict who Pepe will pick, we can study past payoffs to get
a handle on how the public bets.
We can model the behavior by properly interpreting the statistical evi-
dence of previous payoffs. My belief is that there are three major factors
that the betting public uses to decide where to place its bets:
I Estimates of player skills – Every jai alai bettor is given the nightly pro-
gram of matches as he or she walks into the fronton. In addition to the
playingschedule,theprogramtypicallyincludesstatisticalmeasuresof
theperformanceofeachentrant.Usuallythisconsistsofthewin,place,
and show record for each player this season sometimes supplemented
by the entrant’s record in the particular game number. For example,
a reader of the program might learn that the team of Zarandona and
Guisasola have a record of 7–4–9 as a doubles team in 47 games and
that Guisasola has a personal record of 19–12–20 in the 139 Game 3’s
he played this season.
Personally, I cannot imagine why any bettor would ﬁnd a pelotari’s
Game 3 record useful for predictive purposes any more than a baseball
player’s Tuesday average. But I don’t have to. If I know that people are
using this information to bet, it potentially provides some kind of edge
for me if I am making more rational forecasts.
I Records of post positions – The nightly program also includes tables
showing how often each win, place, show, quiniela, exacta, and
trifecta have occurred thus far this season. These tables alert the
bettor to much of what we learned from our initial Monte Carlo simu-
lation, namely that certain combinations occur much more often than
others.
I Whims and fancy – Here I might credit factors like Pepe’s Green Card
and all bets based on birthdays and lucky hotel room numbers. There
doesn’t seem to be very much one can do to model this sort of thing.

green and purple uniforms, there will be a granddaughter who thinks
Olate has a cute butt.
The most straightforward approach to model how the public accounts
for post position is simply to average the payoffs from all the times that the
combination has occurred. By this point in the project, we had a logged
the results of 7730 jai alai matches. This was a large enough database to
provide some meaningful results. The average payoff of the 455 successful
1–2 quinielas was only $17.46 per dollar, whereas the average payoff of
the 279 4–8 quinielas was $26.41 per dollar. These are enough results to
convince me that a 4–8 quiniela bet should pay off substantially better
than a 1–2 quiniela if, in fact, the combination wins.
Our payoff models are given in Tables 6.1–6.4. These payoffs are nor-
malized to represent the amount returned per dollar invested so that we
can properly combine the results from Dania and Milford. Because the two
frontons have different minimum bet amounts, directly averaging payoffs
from them would produce meaningless results.
What do these tables show?
I Table 6.1 presents the average payoffs for win, place, and show betting.
Asacitizen,Iamgratiﬁedtoseethattheaveragepayoffperdollarvaries
inversely with the number of times each result occurred. This means
that the public is smart enough to understand that certain positions

this somewhat less heartwarming because I become a better bettor the
more wrongheaded the public is.
Themostinterestinganomalyinthesedataisthatthepublicprefers
betting on 1 rather than 2. Two-to-win pays off 30 cents more per dollar
than 1-to-win, even though 2 came in more often for win, place, and
show.
I Table 6.2 presents the average payoff for quiniela bets. The payoffs per
dollar range from $16.53 to $47.62, a much narrower band than the
number of occurrences (86 to 455), which suggests that the public un-
dervalues the most commonly occurring trifectas. This phenomenon
also exists in horse racing and other types of sports betting in which it
haslongbeenrecognizedthatthepublictendstounderbetthefavorite.
I Table 6.3 presents the average payoff for exacta bets. There are twice
as many betting opportunities with exactas as with quinielas, and evi-
dence that the public does not evaluate exactas as well as the simpler

bets. The spread on payoff-per-dollar (from $35.79 to $135.19) is only
slight broader than that of quinielas, but the band of occurrences is
much wider (17 to 269). Indeed, the average payoff for the rarest exacta
(6–8)issubstantiallylessthanthatofonethatoccurredmorethanthree
times as often (5–6).
I Tables 6.4–6.7 present our model of trifecta payoffs. These payoffs were
subjectedtoagroupingandaveragingprocedure(tobediscussedlater)
that explains why trifectas 7–1–2 and 7–1–3 have the same projected
Milford matinee payoff even though the former never occurred in the
data.
In The Gambling Times Guide to Jai-Alai, Keevers reports that the
trifectas5–2–4and5–3–2cameupmostfrequentlywhenheconsidered
the question in 1982. Indeed, 5–2–4 and its twin 5–1–4 come up most
frequently (74 and 71 times, respectively) over all of the trifectas.

Further, 5–3–2 was no slouch, coming in 58 times and behind only
1–2–6 (58), 2–3–1 (60), 2–5–1 (65), 4–1–3 (68), 4–2–3 (67), 5–1–3 (64),
5–3–1 (60), 6–1–4 (63), and 6–2–5 (58). The payoffs for these high-
ﬂying triples were suitably depressed, although the expected payoff for
5–2–4 was inexplicably higher by almost $30 per dollar invested than
5–1–4.
Let’s compare these results with our original Monte Carlo simula-
tion, which assumed equal player skills. According to our simulation,
the most frequently occurring trifectas should have been 1–4–2 and

2–4–1, both of which should have occurred about 15% more often than
5–1–4 and 5–2–4. But they happened only 43 and 50 times, respectively.
This difference between theory and practice presumably reﬂects the
inﬂuence of the matchmakers, who consistently avoid putting the best
players in the two most advantageous positions.
These expected payoff tables ignore the public’s perception of player
skills and reﬂect only the initial post positions. We performed some com-
puter experiments to seek correlations between the average payoffs and
our measure of player skills but didn’t ﬁnd any. This can be interpreted in
one of two ways. Either the betting public does not consider who is a better
player in selecting their investments or does not think much of how we
model player skills. Either way, these results justify using our simple tables
to predict payoffs.
Gambling and the Stock Market
Coupling the results of our Monte Carlo simulations with our expected
payoff models gave us everything we needed to put together a betting
system. To evaluate our method, we used our Monte Carlo simulation
to replay all games from the previous year, incorporating our win-point
probabilities to model player skills. The result of each game’s simulation

was a probability distribution predicting the likelihood of each possible
bettingoutcome.Usingthepayoffmodel,wecouldpredictwhatthepayoff
should be for each outcome and make a simulated bet if its expected value
was sufﬁcient to justify the investment.
The expected value of a given dollar bet on x with probability px and
model payoff mx is given by the formula
E(x) = px × mx −$1
This captures the notion that we get paid only if x happens, but we must
buy the $1 ticket regardless. If E(x) is greater than zero, then x is a bet
offering positive returns. If E(x) is negative, we should avoid that bet like
the plague.
Our initial betting strategy was to place simulated wagers on all bets
offering sufﬁcient positive return. And our ﬁrst attempt at simulated
betting using these average payoffs was amazingly successful. We made
a simulated $15,000 proﬁt on a simulated investment of only $20,000.
Meena was, understandably, quite happy with these results. But the key
word is simulated. Our simulated success was due to an overly simplistic
betting model.
To be a ﬁrst-rate programmer, it is important to be very suspicious.
You learn to trust no one and question everything. Any program can fail
because of bugs, and a mathematical model is particularly problematic
because, even if the program is “correct,” the model can fail to capture
some important aspect of reality. It is essential for any programmer to
anticipateproblemsandnottotrustnumbersthathappentobespitout.As
Intel’slongtimechairmanAndrewGrovesays, “Onlytheparanoidsurvive.”
As my mother could have told me, if we were making too much money too
easily, there had to be a catch.
What was the catch? Under the pari-mutuel system, the payoff for any
match is a function of both how much money was wagered in total and
how much of this pool was invested on the successful outcome. Whenever
we add winning money to the pool, it will necessarily reduce the amount
that will be paid off per dollar to the other winners. If we simply average
the payoffs we have seen from the WWW site, we miss the fact that our
bets themselves will change the payoffs. As we will see in the discussion
that follows, this factor can be very signiﬁcant.
Investing in the stock market bears considerable similarity to gam-
bling and in particular works more like a pari-mutuel system than one
128

MODELING THE PAYOFFS
governed by odds makers. Yet all serious investment money is put into
stocks, not horses. Why hasn’t anyone started a jai alai or racetrack mu-
tual fund to bet on these sports? There are two fundamental reasons
why pari-mutuel wagering cannot be considered to be a solid investment
vehicle:
I Thecostpertransaction – Wehaveseenthatthehousekeepsabout20%
of each bet as a cost for each transaction. This means that we must do
20% better than the average bettor just to break even. By comparison,
thecostpertransactionisjustpenniespershareinmajorstockmarkets,
particularly for large transactions. Thus I can prosper with even a slight
increase in the value of my stock.
Low transaction fees are one of the important reasons for the suc-
cess of computer trading systems for stocks, which react instanta-
neously to price changes in the market and look to beneﬁt from minor
ﬂuctuations. A typical stock price might vary 5% per day or less, and
thus large commissions would kill any short-term trading strategy.
I Thesizeofthepool – Largeinvestorslikethestockmarketbecauseitcan
absorb great amounts of capital with relatively little reaction. Suppose
I wanted to buy 1000 shares of Microsoft. According to my newspaper
almost 600,000 shares were traded yesterday. My 1000-share trade will
only be a blip in this market, yet it would represent an investment on
the order of one million dollars. By comparison, one lousy $3 jai alai
bet to win will signiﬁcantly reduce the payoff for everyone else who
bet on the same number to win. Thus, even when I ﬁnd an excellent
betting opportunity in jai alai, I can’t put enough money on it to take
signiﬁcant advantage of my insight.
The so called “penny stocks” that trade on small stock exchanges
are subject to this same phenomenon or even worse malfeasance and
chicanery. Small companies are, by deﬁnition, small. Hence, the total
value of all the stock is relatively low. The current price of any stock
is exactly what the last person paid for it. Suppose I own a signiﬁcant
amount of a cheap stock that has relatively little trading in it each day. I
cansellasmallpartofmyholdingsbackandforthtomyco-conspirator,
raising the price each day. Eventually, honest bettors will see that the
stock is moving and want to get some of the action. I will be happy to
sell them all of my holdings at this artiﬁcially high price, hoping to get
rid of it before the market crashes.
129

CALCULATED BETS
With these two facts in mind, why did I devote so much time and effort
to develop a betting system for jai alai? Frankly, it can’t be justiﬁed on any
cold, analytical basis. I did it because it was a very cool thing to do. I once
read a description of an infamous boxing promoter as a man who would
prefer to steal one dollar than earn two dollars honestly. That motivation,
in a much more benign sense, probably also applied to me. All of us, I
think,getaperversethrillthatcomesonlyfrombeatingthesystem.Making
money gambling is a form of beating the system because we know that the
odds are stacked against us. This project represents my effort to beat back
the forces of nature through understanding and intellectual effort.
If you remain unconvinced, think of it this way. Building this system
was my attempt to steal one dollar. Writing this book was my attempt
to earn two dollars honestly. Which of the two do you think was a more
exciting venture to contemplate?
Measuring Our Impact on the Pool
How we can compensate for the fact that our own bets impact the payoffs
we receive? The ﬁrst order of business is to estimate the size of the betting
pools that we are impacting.
The single best measure of the ﬁnancial health of any track or fronton
is not its attendance but its handle. The handle is the total dollar amount
that has been wagered over the course of the day. Because the fronton
takes 20% of the handle as its cut, this is the number that matters to them.
Milford Jai-Alai posts the handle with the other results of each day’s
matches. These numbers provide interesting insights into the ﬁnancial
state of the jai alai industry. I plotted the the amount of money bet at
Milford each night over a 2-year period in six graphs partitioned according
to the day of the week.
I always ﬁnd it exciting to see a large amount of data presented in a
small amount of paper in such a way that it can be understood. I refer
all fellow mathematical graphics fans to Tufte’s Visualization of Quanti-
tative Data, a coffee-table quality book illustrating the beauty of properly
represented data.
The handles presented in this ﬁgure are for all the evening sessions at
Milfordin1997and1998.Matinee(afternoon)sessions,whicharetypically
played on Sunday, Monday, and Wednesday, are not included. From this
data, it is clear that Friday and Saturday are the big nights at Milford. The
handles are almost twice as large on weekends as on Monday night. Early

in 1998 they tried to solve the slow Monday night problem by moving the
MondayeveningsessiontoTuesday.ButTuesdayhandlesprovednobetter
and in fact seemed to depress the take from Thursday. Restoring the status
quo did no lasting damage, for both the Monday and Thursday handles
quickly recovered to their previous levels.
But the most ominous shadows are cast by the trends in the data, which
show a slight but perceptible decrease in the handle as a function of time.

CALCULATED BETS
These numbers are best put in perspective by comparing them with the
boom days of jai alai 20 years ago. In 1978, the average handle at Milford
was $349,360, a ﬁgure reached exactly once over the past 2 years, on an
average attendance of over 3000 people. Today’s handle and attendance
are about half of what they were 20 years ago.
This data can be used to model how much money would be bet at the
fronton on a given night. But that isn’t all we need. Each night’s handle is a
total of all the pools over all the matches. We had to break this total into its
components to predict the size of each betting pool. We could estimate the
amount of money bet on each match by dividing the handle by the total
number of matches in the session. We could further divide the money per
match into its component pools if we knew what fractions of the handle
went into win, place, show, quiniela, exacta, and trifecta pools.
Once we knew how much money was invested in a given pool, it was
easy to ﬁgure out our impact on it. From the pool size and our payoff-per-
dollar estimation, we could work backwards to ﬁgure out how much of
the pool money would have to have been invested on the winner for it to
pay off at the estimated rate. By adding our (minimum allowable) bet to
this winning pool amount, we can now divide the total pool among the
winners, including, it is hoped, ourselves.
These formulas gave us the ability to estimate the impact of our bets
on the entire pool, but we needed the right fractions to predict how much
money was invested in each betting pool. This information wasn’t avail-
able on the Internet. We had to go back to the source.
Field Trip to Connecticut
Mythen-ﬁanc´e,now-wifeReneehadheardmebabbleaboutjaialaialmost
from the moment we had met, but she had never been to see a game. It
seemed like a good idea to let her see what she was missing and show Dario
and Meena what the sport was really about.
Therefore, on May 28, 1997, we went on a ﬁeld trip to Connecticut.
Bridgeport,whichusedtobethefrontonclosesttowhereIlive,hadrecently
gone out of business after a disastrous attempt to turn it into a dog racing
track. Milford, the only remaining fronton in Connecticut, is a 2-hour drive
from Stony Brook. Renee and I swung by to pick the two students up, and
then we rounded New York City and drove into the Nutmeg State.
From our discussions in the car, it became clear that neither Dario nor
Meena had any real understanding of the physical nature of jai alai. All
132

MODELING THE PAYOFFS
they knew of the sport was what I had told them, and what I told them
was a mathematical abstraction. To Dario and Meena, jai alai players were
Basque-speaking automata who randomly scored points according to a
given probability distribution. They found it somewhat disorienting to
discover that the players were people. It was a reversal of the standard
movie zombie story – the body snatchers came and suddenly there was
ﬂesh and blood on what yesterday had been much-loved machines.
We arrived at an attractively landscaped building designed by award-
winning architect Herbert S. Newman. Although Milford has been called
the “Tiffany of frontons,” its concrete bulkiness betrayed the 1970s con-
struction. Milford dates back to the time when betting on jai alai ﬁrst
became legal in Connecticut.
We cruised down the Galleria, beneath a series of colorful Basque-
style banners. The thin early crowd seemed to consist mostly of retired
people. Not too many working people can take the afternoon off to watch
jai alai. The spectators projected the same aura of modest seediness that
you ﬁnd in any race track or casino. There was just enough light, glitter,
and spectacle about the room to ward off the undercurrent of gloom that
lurks wherever people are losing money. Renee wandered off to explore
while the rest of us took care of business.
I had arranged for us to meet with Milford Jai-Alai’s public relations
director, Bob Heussler. He turned out to be a tall, friendly fellow who
treated us as honored guests. Bob escorted us to the clubhouse, a small
bar and restaurant with the best seats in the house, and offered us drinks
on his tab. He even seemed a little disappointed when none of us ordered
anything stronger than orange juice. I guess his usual clientele does not
include students and their professor.
We spent an hour watching and talking jai alai. Times had gotten a lot
harder for Milford the instant that the Pequots had opened up their nearby
Foxwoods casino. First the Hartford and then the Bridgeport frontons got
scalped by the Indians, leaving Milford as the only remaining outpost in
the state. Milford inherited the dates and some of the customers of the
previous frontons, which helped. Their ﬁnances were stable, but still, it
wasn’t like the old days.
“I don’t understand these people,” Bob said, shaking his head sadly.
“We offer an exciting game with lots of action. But people just seem to
want to throw their money into slot machines. We can’t take their money
from them as fast as the casino can, so they stay away.”
133

CALCULATED BETS
I looked around the hall. It was an early game of a Wednesday matinee,
perhaps the slowest period of the week. Only a couple hundred spectators
linedthestands,althoughmorewouldﬁleinlater.Thethoughtthatseveral
times as many people were sullenly feeding quarters to the Pequots just
an hour’s drive away ﬁlled me with despair.
“We’ve been lobbying the state to let us offer slot machines and poker
on the side. That would help bring back the public.”
My students and I had come primarily to learn what we could about
betting patterns at Milford. Les Trotto, the director of mutual operations,
dropped by to give us copies of the handle summary sheets for the past
few days.
This data was extremely interesting. The total handle (i.e., the total
amount bet) for Sunday afternoon, May 25, was $222,670. With a good
Memorial Day weekend crowd of 1542 on hand, this worked out to $144.40
bet per head. This ﬁgure is somewhat inﬂated because roughly a quarter
of the handle comes from off-track betting (OTB). Indeed, enough people
had looked up from their slot machines at Foxwoods to contribute $5,475
to the pool.
Still, these average handles sounded awfully high to me. The typical
bettor was doing much more than placing one minimum $3 wager on
each game.
Theearlygamesofthesessionhadbyfarthesmallestpools,presumably
because most of the spectators had not yet shown up at the fronton. The
handle picked up as the day progressed, eventually reaching almost twice
that of the opening session. It peaked three or four games from the end as
the crowd started going home. There was a blip in the last game, however.
It featured a high payoff “superfecta” bet for which the object is to pick the
ﬁrst four players in the correct order.
“Weliketohaveanexoticbetattheendofthesessiontokeepthecrowd
in the house,” Bob explained.
Indeed, the higher the payoff, the more popular the bet seemed to
be. Roughly 60% of the total handle was wagered on trifectas. Quinielas
accounted for 25% of the pool, and 10% was invested in exactas. The
remaining 5% of the handle was split between win, place, and show as
well as the exotic bets. Bob and Les conﬁrmed that these patterns were
typical.
“Trifectas are the most popular type of bet. People are attracted by
the big payoffs and then lose all their bets. They get frustrated and don’t
134

MODELING THE PAYOFFS
come back. We wish more people would bet win–place–show so they have
something to show for the day. Keep them coming back.”
“Any ideas on what kind of systems people use to bet?,” I asked, looking
for an edge.
“Our customers do all kinds of things. Some people play their favorite
number or color. Others watch the players. We have a few people who
watch the odds boards and bet on numbers which have very little money
in them.”
“How do they do?”
“The odds guys? Pretty good, I guess. Some of them have been here for
years.”
I had heard that there were people at tracks who made a living pick-
ing up winning tickets that had been erroneously discarded by the peo-
ple who bought them. “What happens to unclaimed winning tickets?” I
asked him.
“Good question. Each year there are about $100,000 worth of winnings
which are not claimed. You get exactly one year to cash in any winning
ticket. Unclaimed winnings money is retained by the house, but it is not
money we are looking for. We urge patrons to cash winning tickets imme-
diately. The state used to keep that money until several years ago.”
“Tell me,” I asked. “Who is Pepe, of Pepe’s Green Card, and how does he
make his picks?”
Bob laughed. “I hate to tell you this, but there is no Pepe. The Green
Card picks are usually made by the public address announcer. I’ve ﬁlled in
for him on occasion when he went on vacation.”
The truth sometimes hurts. It was a good thing we were working on a
system to eliminate our dependence on Pepe.
After Bob and Les left, Renee joined us at our table. It was time to teach
my ﬂedglings how to bet. They had been watching the numbers closely for
almost a year now. Now was the time to test what they had learned.
“How about 2 to show?,” Dario suggested. My adventurers had picked
the safest bet in the house. It was the second game, a singles match.
I bellied up to the cashier and invested $3 on Baronio to Show.
Baronio came in second, and so we won. We watched with interest as
the result was posted. Number 2 to show paid off at $3.60. We had cleared
20% on this wise investment in less than 15 minutes, which was probably
better than either Bill Gates or Warren Buffet have ever done with their
money.
135

CALCULATED BETS
I sauntered up to the cashier to collect my winnings. I asked the cashier
what the biggest ticket she ever cashed was. She told me this wasn’t it.
Indeed, pocketing only 60 cents’ proﬁt left a somewhat empty feeling be-
hind. Now I understood better why more people didn’t bet win–place–
show. The thrill of victory loses some of its luster when all you collect is
change. Quinielas and trifecta offer payoffs sufﬁcient to justify the effort
of rooting and the excitement of ﬁguring out the permutations of what
might happen. When you have a bet on only one player, only a small frac-
tion of the points played will have an immediate consequence on your
investment.
“If we stop betting now we ﬁnish ahead.” Dario pointed out. But I bet
on a few quinielas to show them how much more interesting the game
could be. I lost them all, illustrating how a high roller gets steamrollered.
We left early to avoid getting caught in rush hour trafﬁc from the city.
But we spent the whole trip back discussing how to incorporate what we
had learned from our expedition into the system.
The Problem of Overﬁtting Data
Suppose that you are given the job of distinguishing likely Democratic
party voters from likely Republican voters on the basis of age and income.
A scatter plot illustrating political party afﬁliation as a function of age and income.
136

MODELING THE PAYOFFS
To give you the basis to make such a decision, you have polled 100 people
and obtained their age, income, and party afﬁliation and put the results in
a scatterplot.
How can you generalize from this data to predict political afﬁliation
based only on people’s age and income? The simplest approach would be
to carve up the age–space plane into two regions and assign each of these
regions to one of the political parties. We present two possible divisions
on page 138. On the top is the best possible Democrat–Republican dis-
criminator that can be built from a single straight line. It cuts the space
completely according to income; anyone who makes less than $80,000 a
year is a classiﬁed a Democrat, whereas anyone who makes more than that
is called a Republican.
Such a simple-minded division makes mistakes, of course. Indeed,
three of the Democrats and four of the Republicans ended up on the wrong
side of the line. On the bottom we provide a different divider that correctly
classiﬁes for all the compassionate rich and misguided poor in our test set,
but it has to jump around a lot in order to do so.
Which of these two classiﬁers do you think does a better job distin-
guishing Democrats from Republicans? Even though it makes a few mis-
takes, I prefer the simpler model on the left. Its simplicity helps guard
against overﬁtting the data, that is, building a model that so completely
reﬂects the weirdnesses of the training data that it misses the larger pic-
ture. The classiﬁer on the right distorts its shape to classify the outliers,
correctly whereas the classiﬁer on the left mislabels these oddballs
on the assumption that they are, in fact, oddballs without predictive
value.
Properly modeling the expected trifecta payoffs required care to guard
against overﬁtting our data. Recall that we averaged the results of all pre-
vious payoffs to predict future returns. This method worked well for most
bet types such as win, place, show, and quiniela. However, the results of
simple averaging are not so easy to believe in the case of trifectas. There are
336 different trifecta combinations, and thus the average trifecta should
have occurred roughly 23 times during our sampling interval. But this
average is misleading because there is a high variance in the number of
occurrences.
The mean or average is a statistical measure of the most likely value of
a sequence, whereas variance, and its close cousin standard deviation,

measure the consistency of values in a sequence. Let us consider the
annual salaries (in thousands of dollars) of 10 people in each of 2 dif-
ferent professions. The ﬁrst sample comes from unionized postal workers
in Omaha, Nebraska:
33, 27, 39, 25, 26, 24, 36, 28, 32, 30
and the second sample comes from people in the telemarketing industry
138

MODELING THE PAYOFFS
(a large fraction of whom happen to operate out of Omaha):
19, 30, 20, 24, 108, 17, 23, 19, 22, 18
Both of these sequences have the same average (30K). But the variance
of the telemarketers is considerably higher because it is thrown off by
the inclusion of one high-paid member of management. The standard
deviation in salaries at a union shop is likely to be much lower than one in
which management feels free to oppress the masses and appropriately oil
the squeaky wheel.
The high variance of payoffs associated with rare trifectas becomes a
problem in trying to estimate their expected return accurately. Suppose
we were to pick a single random element of each of the two sets of salaries
above. Which random salary would more accurately reﬂect the average of
the group? There is less chance that a random element of the low-variance
sequencewilldoabadjobrepresentinghiscroniesthanonefromthemore
diverse sequence. Picking the manager as a typical representative of the
telemarketing industry would be seriously misleading, but is just as likely
as picking the single fellow who is right on the average.
Simply averaging the payoffs for rare, high-variance trifectas doesn’t
make much sense. Over the last 2 years the trifecta 8–7–6 came in only ﬁve
times at Milford, paying at $3708.60, $4568.40, $4574.70, $1975.50, and
$1293.00 for a $3 bet. What about even rarer trifectas that may have come
in only once or never? What should they pay off at?
To do a better job of estimating the payoff of rare trifectas, we
partitioned them into groups with similar occurrence frequencies and
then averaged all the payoffs within each group. This meant all of the
low-probability trifectas in a given group were assigned the same expected
payoff. Damping the projected payoff from the highest-return singleton
payoff was essential to keep our betting system from being burned like a
mothattractedtoaﬂame.Ifonetrifectahadaprojectedpayoffof$2000per
dollar invested based on only one or two actual occurrences, the system
would be liable to keep chasing what was probably a ﬂuke payoff instead
of a real quirk in the public’s betting strategy.

to the next chapter if you really want to get on with the story. But I urge
you to stick with me for a better understanding of how models are built in
the real world.
Theprocessofcreatingandvalidatinganymathematicalmodelischar-
acterized by three primary steps:
I Translation – Express observations of the real world in some form of
mathematical language or implementation.
I Execution – Use this model on training or real-world data to make new
predictions or conclusions about the world.
I Validation – Interpret and test the resulting predictions to assess the
extent to which the model reﬂects reality.
As shown by our experiences, the validation process typically leads us
to new observations that must be translated back into the model, thus
generating a cycle of activity that may require several rounds to get right.
Our system employs two different types of mathematical model
techniques, namely Monte Carlo simulation and statistical analysis. In
this section, we will introduce several other important approaches to
mathematical modeling. The resulting models can be classiﬁed accord-
ing to a variety of basic properties and characteristics. My taxonomy of
models is based on the following traits:
I Discreteversuscontinuousmodels–Certainmodelsmanipulatediscrete
entities, which are those that cannot be further divided into fractional
parts. Our jai alai model was discrete, for each point scored was a dis-
tinct minimal event with exactly one winner. Trafﬁc ﬂow simulations
deal with quanta of individual vehicles. But other models deal with in-
herentlycontinuousquantitiessuchastemperature,speed,time,force,
and salary where there are no possible gaps between allowable values.
Whatever speeds x and y are traveling at say, 65.231 and 65.232 mph,
140

MODELING THE PAYOFFS
respectively, there is room for someone to get between them (say, at
65.2315 mph).
Calculus, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry all revolve around
continuous functions, and so the full weight of classical mathematics
can be brought to bear in modeling continuous functions.
I General versus ad hoc models – Certain types of models use ad hoc
techniquescarefullycustomizedforthegivenapplication.Inthecourse
of developing our jai alai simulation, not for one moment did we ever
forget that we were simulating jai alai. It would be very difﬁcult to
adapt our model to another application – even another pari-mutuel
sport such as horse racing.
Other mathematical modeling techniques are not so fussy. They are
typicallydesignedtoworkwithgeneralstatisticaldata,huntingforpat-
terns and correlations. They couldn’t care less whether you feed them
stock market data, baseball scores, electrocardiograms, or astrological
charts. Of course the quality of the resulting model depends heavily
upon the quality of the input data – garbage in, garbage out.
The surprise is that the performance of such general techniques is
oftenverycompetitivewithcarefullycrafted,problem-speciﬁcmodels.
Which approach is better depends upon the quality of the statistical
data you have to work with and how much the proper interpretation
of this data depends upon idiosyncrasies of the application.
I Black box versus descriptive models – Descriptive modeling techniques
give us more than just an answer. They provide additional information
to let us know how the model reached its decision and how much to
believe it. Many statistical models come with measures of the strength
of correlations and the signiﬁcance of the results.
Black box methods apply some form of magic to data, yielding an-
swersbutnotnecessarilyareasontotrustthem.Applyinganymodeling
method you don’t fully understand yields a black box model. The name
should conjure up the image of a device that takes data in and spits
answers out but whose internal mechanisms are hidden from view by
the container in which it is housed.
Black box methods can be very useful despite this inherent
mystery – particularly if there is independent data on which to val-
idate the resulting models. Indeed, we will see that the opaqueness
of such popular modeling techniques as neural networks can be an
important part of their charm.
141

CALCULATED BETS
I Simulation versus data-driven models – Simulations attempt to recre-
ate nature from ﬁrst principles. Conversely, data-driven models at-
tempt to interpret nature by analyzing statistical data.
The actuarial tables used by insurance companies are constructed
by classical data-driven models. A simulation approach to predicting
your life expectancy might be to model the set of all events that could
happen to you each and every day, play them out, and see which one
happens to kill you. By repeating the experiment millions of times
in a Monte Carlo fashion, the model could estimate the probability
distribution of when and how you will die.
But the range of activities you may engage in over the course of
your life is clearly much too varied to be simulated accurately, partic-
ularly because the fate of the entire insurance industry depends upon
the results. Instead, actuaries use a statistical approach to predicting
your life expectancy, not by predicting what will happen to you but
by observing what has happened to people like you. Do you smoke?
Do you drive more than 15 miles to work each day? Well, the actuar-
ies have extensive records on millions of people, and they know just
what happened to people just like you. They predict your future not by
preplaying it but by putting you in the right pigeonhole and reporting
what happened to the rest of the ﬂock.
I Randomized versus deterministic models – Certain mathematical mod-
elsaredeterministic,meaningthattheanswerstheygivearecompletely
deﬁned by the input data. If we give exactly the same input twice, we
expecttoseethesameresultstwice.Myhigh-schoolfootballprediction
program Clyde is a good example of a deterministic model.
Randomized models, such as our Monte Carlo simulation, incor-
porate some level of randomness into their execution. Thus, running
the model twice on the same players and post positions will yield two
slightly different distributions of who wins with what probability.
That there is usually only one right answer to any given problem
yields an aesthetic appeal to deterministic models. But remember
Ralph Waldo Emerson’s credo that “a foolish consistency is the hob-
goblin of little minds.” Randomization give us the power to run a model
many different times, enabling us to vote for solutions that come up
most frequently or explore the space of possibilities. Such a distribu-
tion can be more useful than a bald assertion that X is the best solution
possible.
142

MODELING THE PAYOFFS
I will now introduce a variety of modeling techniques whose advan-
tages and disadvantages can best be understood in the light of these
attributes.
CURVE-FITTING MODELS
We have seen that the mathematical modeler has a menagerie of curve
shapes available to work with. A simple but powerful modeling paradigm
is to ﬁnd the curve that most closely agrees with the shape of your data at
hand and use it to predict future trends or the values of points you haven’t
been able to measure.
Modeling the high and low temperatures in Omaha by sine curves
(see page 97) is an excellent example of curve ﬁtting in action. We can use
this technique to predict which temperature records are most likely to be
broken by noting which highs lie below and which lows lie above the ﬁtted
curves. This works because the curve tells us what the real values “should
be.” A reasonable way to predict how much warmer it will be a month from
now would be to measure how much higher the ﬁtted curves cross that
date relative to the present.
The basic curve type to use for ﬁtting a given data set can identiﬁed
by either eyeballing its gross shape or using a general theory. In the ﬁrst
approach,themodelerstudiesthedatasetandselectsacurvewhoseshape
the data remind him of. In the second, the modeler posits a curve that
should underlie the data according to the laws of physics or man.
Once the given curve type has been identiﬁed, the appropriate para-
meters must be set to best match the data. The number of parameters
for any curve type is counted by its number of degrees of freedom. A
straight line, y = ax + b, has two degrees of freedom, namely the slope
a and intercept b. The best parameter values to ﬁt a given curve to a given
data set can be found using a black box mathematical technique called
linear regression, which is programmed in many pocket calculators these
days.
The more degrees of freedom a curve has, the more ﬂexibility it has to
be wrapped around a given data set. With this power comes the danger
of overﬁtting, that is, constructing a curve that so completely accounts
for the noise in your data it ignores the larger trends. Robust ﬁts use small
numbersofdegreesoffreedomtoaccountforlargenumbersofdatapoints.
The sine curves so carefully ﬁtting our Omaha temperature data use only
143

CALCULATED BETS
four parameters (height, amplitude, frequency, and phase) to ﬁt 365 points
accurately.
NEAREST NEIGHBOR PREDICTORS
Nearest neighbor models use a simple but compelling idea. To predict
something about you, ﬁnd someone similar to you and observe that prop-
erty in them.
Let’s say a telemarketing company wants to know your salary but is too
polite to ask.2 The company no doubt has a large database of customers
who have previously been hassled as well as some information about you.
Thus, they can hunt through their database to ﬁnd the person who seems
most similar in the aspects they know about. If person x is similar to you
in several aspects, say your age, amount of education, and geographic
location, why shouldn’t he or she be similar in other ways as well? Thus, if
the telemarketers knew person x’s salary, they probably have a reasonable
idea of what you are making.
Nearest neighbor classiﬁers work by carving up the space of possible
inputs into cells such that each cell consists of the portion of space closest
to that of a single training point. The entire cell takes on the identity of the
training point, thus enabling us to classify the entire space of possibilities.
I give such a cell decomposition (also called a Voronoi diagram) for a
training set of Democrat–Republican data. This type of system is used
by Amazon.com and other Websites to predict what products I might like
by matching me with people who have made similar purchases.
Despite their elegance and simplicity, nearest neighbor models have
two serious drawbacks. First, ﬁnding the right measure of similarity is
often an ill-posed problem. Is a 39-year-old New Yorker with a Ph.D. more
similar to a 45-year-old high-school dropout from Chicago or a 79-year-
old retired professor on Barbados? Somehow your distance function will
have to score that appropriately. The simplest class of distance functions
assigns each feature a numerical value and mimics the geometric distance
function in the plane
d(a, b) =

(Xa −Xb)2 + (Ya −Yb)2

with as many dimensions as input features and perhaps adjustments to

Asecondissuewithnearestneighbormodelsisarelativelackofrobust-
ness. The nearest neighbor to a given query may be, like some neighbors
you encounter in real life, a weirdo who does not resemble anyone else
around. Such outliers make lousy predictions. A more robust alternative
might be to take a vote among all close neighbors to get a consensus.
SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS
A wide class of mathematical models are constructed from systems of
equations. You have probably developed your own equational model if
youhaveeverusedaspreadsheetprogramsuchasMicrosoftExcel.Spread-
sheets consists of rows and columns of cells, and each cell contains either
input data or an equation operating on data or other equation cells.
145

CALCULATED BETS
Budgets are perhaps the model most frequently implemented on
spreadsheets. Such models can be used to establish how high you can
jack up your own salary while maintaining corporate proﬁtability or to
determine the impact of a tax cut on the fate of a project.
Indeed, spreadsheet programs make wonderful environments in
which to experiment with your own mathematical models. Modern
spreadsheets have the graphical capability to make plots, statistical rou-
tines for data analysis, and even fairly general data entry formats. I hope
inspired readers will go on to tackle their own modeling projects, perhaps
starting from my suggestions at the end of this book.
Econometrics is the science of building models of the economy. Say the
director of the Federal Reserve Bank wants to know what will happen if he
raises interest rates one point. Instead of trying it on the real economy to
see if the stock market crashes, he can experiment with an econometric
model. Such models are essentially giant spreadsheets with thousands of
equations incorporating vast amounts of economic data and experience.
Similar models are maintained by large companies such as airlines to
predict the sales impact of raising or lowering prices. By incorporating
optimization techniques such as linear programming these models can
yield pricing schemes that maximize proﬁts. Indeed, the rapidly changing
and seemingly irrational ticket prices that airlines set for different seats on
a given plane are a tribute to the power and ﬂexibility of such models.
DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION MODELS
Perhaps the most important mathematical model ever developed was
Newton’s laws of motion. The success of these laws in predicting the
motion of planets had a radical effect on humanity’s conception of how
the universe works. Like any good mathematical model, Newton’s laws
oversimpliﬁed reality (they were superseded by Einstein’s general theory
of relativity) but yielded very accurate predictions on a wide variety of
problems.
The proper models for many physical phenomena are based on dif-
ferential equations. They are used in modeling ﬂuid ﬂows and heat dissi-
pation, analyzing electronic and magnetic ﬁelds, and predicting changes
in human or animal populations. These differential equations provide the
underpinnings of weather forecasting, nuclear weapons design, and epi-
demiology – to name just a few killer applications.
146

MODELING THE PAYOFFS
The basic idea behind differential equations is the observation that
quantities can be expressed in terms of changes. Suppose you know the
value of a function f (x) at time t 1 and can predict the change (t 2 −t 1)
between this value over the short time interval from time t 1 to time t2 .
Then f (t 2) = f (t 1) + (t 2 −t 1) by deﬁnition. If we wanted to compute
the value of this function further in the future, we could sum up many of
these small steps, that is,
f (t k) = f (t 1) +
k−1

i=0
(t i+1 −t i)
Calculus is the branch of mathematics that specializes in summing up
changes over tiny time intervals known as differentials. Indeed, Newton
had to invent calculus in order to develop his laws of motion.
The discerning reader may catch a whiff of a circular argument here.
If you can indeed correctly predict small differences in the state of a sys-
tem, then surely you can add them up to predict large changes. But how do
you correctly predict the small changes? Here formulas from the appropri-
ate branch of physics come into play. In weather prediction, for example,
the temperature at a location might change according to the tempera-
ture of neighboring locations and the rate at which heat is conducted
in the atmosphere. The ultimate accuracy of weather prediction models
depends upon how accurately and completely the current conditions can
be observed as well as the ﬁdelity of these formulas at predicting small
changes.
A proper appreciation of differential equation models requires sub-
stantial training in physics and mathematics. But such models govern our
interaction with nature and account for the vast bulk of cycles used on
the most powerful supercomputers around. They will always consume as
much computer power as they can get, because they can be made more
accurate by summing up over smaller and smaller time intervals.
NEURAL NETWORKS
Neural networks are an approach to mathematical modeling inspired by
the architecture of the human brain. The intuition is that since brains are
good at solving problems, machines built in the same way should be, too.
Brains are very good at learning and recognizing certain patterns. At
the risk of gross oversimpliﬁcation, learning in brains seems to work by
adding connections between different pairs of brain cells called neurons
147

CALCULATED BETS

through w 8 govern the strength of each connection and are determined by the test
data used to train the network.
and changing the strengths of the connections. Modifying connection
strength in response to training examples provides a natural way to “train”
a neural network.
Neural nets prove a reasonable approach to classiﬁcation and forecast-
ing applications such as optical character recognition and stock-market
time-series prediction when you have a large amount of data to experi-
ment with and no particular ideas of what to do with it. You train the net
on the data and watch what happens.
For example, suppose that a bank wants to build a computer model to
recognize loan candidates who are likely to default and hence are not good
risks to lend money to. No doubt the bank has a database of loans it has
made in the past, from which a suitable set of successful and unsuccessful
loan applications can be extracted. Each loan application is described by
a natural set of features the loan ofﬁcer and our model should use to make
their decisions such as annual income, amount of previous debt, credit
rating, dollar amount of collateral, and the amount of money requested.
The neural network training algorithm takes your training data and pro-
duces a classiﬁcation function that will say either thumbs up or thumbs
down for any given loan application.
But there is a problem. Neural networks are black boxes with the
strength of edges adjusted only by the training examples according to
148

MODELING THE PAYOFFS
some magic learning algorithm. Because your classiﬁer was developed by
a black box, you never really know why it is making its decisions, and thus
you can’t know when it will fail. An interesting case was a system built for
the military to distinguish between images of cars and tanks. It performed
very well on test images but disastrously in the ﬁeld. Eventually, someone
realized that the car images had been ﬁlmed on a sunnier day than the
tanks had been ﬁlmed on, and the program was classifying solely on the
basis of clouds in the background of the image!
That it is difﬁcult to ﬁgure out why neural networks make the decisions
they do can actually be perceived as an advantage in certain applications.
Redlining is the illegal practice of making loan decisions on the basis of
addresses. Redlining is illegal because it has often been used as a cover to
discriminate against members of the given minority group that happens
to dominate the particular neighborhood. If a loan ofﬁcer were to reject
a loan on the basis of zip code, the bank could have a serious lawsuit on
its hand. But if the loan ofﬁcer rejects the loan because the mathematical
model tells him to, all is covered. An unscrupulous banker can train a
neural network to hate Hispanics by feeding it a selection of many bad
loans from bad neighborhoods and know that his or her tracks are covered
by the opaqueness of the black box.

CHAPTER SEVEN
ENGINEERING THE SYSTEM
There is a big difference between building a prototype system and a piece
of production software. In his classic book The Mythical Man-Month,
Fredrick Brooks estimates that it takes nine times the effort to create a
complete, reliable system as opposed to an initial program that starts to
do the job.
With Meena’s graduation, I needed a fresh student to turn our pro-
totype into a production system. I got to know Roger Mailler when he
took CSE 214, undergraduate Data Structures, with me in the fall of 1997.
Roger was the bored-looking student in the front row – too bright and
knowledgeable to get very much from the course, but too disciplined
to cut class or hide in the back. Roger ﬁnished ﬁrst out of the 126 stu-
dents in the course (by a substantial margin) and was untainted by a
programming assignment cheating scandal that claimed many of his
classmates.
Roger is an interesting fellow whose career path to Stony Brook fol-
lowed a very non-standard course. His ﬁrst attempt at college (at the
Rochester Institute of Technology) was, to be charitable, unsuccessful.
In one year at RIT he amassed a grade point average (GPA) of 0.96, where
4.0 is an A and 1.0 is a D. Any mammal with a pulse ought to be
able to do better. Indeed, this is the lowest GPA I’ve ever seen sustained
150

ENGINEERING THE SYSTEM
over a full academic year because students capable of such perfor-
mance usually manage to get themselves expelled before the year is out.
Roger clearly had some growing up to do. He did this in the U.S. Air
Force while stationed in Korea. There he started computer programming
andfoundhiscalling.Heworkedonasystemthatautomaticallymonitored
e-mail to prevent the release of classiﬁed information. Working Air Force
security is perhaps the best place to develop that productively suspicious
nature needed to produce high-reliability software.
After his enlistment ran out, he returned to college, this time at Stony
Brook. He went on to earn a 3.96 GPA here, which is about as high as you

occur surprisingly often with older returning students who have ﬁnally ﬁg-
ured out what they want from life. They are Exhibit A for the importance of
allowing people second chances, which is one of the many noble missions
for state universities like Stony Brook.
After incorporating the pool adjustments of the previous chapter, our
programwaslosingsimulatedmoney.Thisisbetterthanlosingrealmoney
but still not a satisfactory state of affairs. It was now up to Roger to turn
our system around, as successfully, it was hoped, as he had his GPA.
Elegance in Software Systems
I often get the sense that people trained in the humanities have an im-
age of computer scientists as Neanderthals with knuckles dragging on the
ground.TheyseeourmismatchedclothesandourtasteforJoltColainstead
of wine as the stigmata of the geek and manifestations of a downtrodden
people.
However, the quest for beauty and elegance occupies a substantial
place in the hearts and minds of software engineers. There can easily be
two programs that solve exactly the same problem, one of which is beau-
tiful and the other of which is ugly. And although beauty is only skin deep,
ugliness goes clean to the bone as far as software is concerned.
What goes into making a beautiful program?
I Readability – An understandable program is a pretty program. Explain-
ing what makes programs readable is as easy (and hard) as it is to ex-
plain what makes English text readable. You have to break the program
properly into ﬁles and subroutines, which are analogous to chapters
andparagraphsinEnglish.Youhavetoaddmeaningfuldocumentation
151

CALCULATED BETS
and variable names much as you have to deﬁne any unusual vocabu-
lary for the reader. You have to structure the program properly on the
page just as you must use the proper fonts and formatting for your
English document.
The importance of readable programs is emphasized by an Inter-
net tradition, the annual International Obfuscated C Code Contest.
The enormously powerful programming language C incorporates the
potentialtowriteindecipherableprograms.ThegoaloftheObfuscated
C contest is to write short programs that do useful or interesting things
but in such a way that no skilled programmer would be able to identify
these things are by reading the program. The Best of Show winning
program by Carl Banks is a particularly outstanding combination of
beauty and illegibility. To see other inspiring winners, visit the con-
test’s ofﬁcial WWW page at http://www.ioccc.org/.
Comparing this code with that of our Monte Carlo simulation
should convince you that clarity and legibility have their own beauty –
especially if you are trying to make something work.
Creating readable programs is particularly essential in a world in
whichsoftwaregetspassedfromitsauthortothosechargedwithmain-
taining it. Dario’s programs got passed to Meena, who passed them to
Roger. Much of the trouble associated with the millennium bug was
due to the unreadable programs Generation IX left to Generation X.
I Generality – A beautiful program is one that can easily be made to do
more than it was intendedtodo.Thisisatestamenttothesoundnessof
its underlying design more than it is about the programmer’s ambition
or the ability to anticipate what needs will be made of the system in
the future.
The distinction between programs and data is a fundamental one;
programs are descriptions of how to do something, whereas data is
a passive entity being acted on. In a well-written program, we can
easily change the data without changing the program acting on it.
A good word processor can be used to edit English as well as Chi-
nese text, computer program source code as well as tables of num-
bers. The key is thinking generally enough about the task at hand
to encompass a broader set of goals than may originally have been
conceived.

place, show, exacta, quiniela, and trifecta. Once Meena got the ﬁrst
program working (say to calculate win statistics), she basically copied
this program and changed the word “win” everywhere it appeared to
“show”. She then repeated this process ﬁve times to build six sepa-
rate programs, each computing results for one type of statistic. This
was a reasonable response at the time to an unreasonable professor
who wanted results yesterday, but this approach was not conducive
to building small, reliable programs.
Rogerlookedatallsixoftheslightlyvaryingprogramsandreplaced
them by a single program that did the right thing for each by only
changing one word in a data ﬁle, say from “win” to “show”. This made
the program much more general, because we could add functionality
to all bet types by changing one program ﬁle instead of requiring us
to make the change to all six of them. Roger’s change shortened the
program by several hundred lines, and you can’t have bugs in lines you
don’t have.
I Robustness – A pretty program is robust and reliable. It detects prob-
lems like faulty or unexpected data without crashing and burning.
Instead, it smoothly compensates for the defective data and alerts the
user as to the nature of the problem.
Anticipating the unexpected and developing a plan to respond to
it are hallmarks of a top-notch programmer. I have said before that
a good programmer must be paranoid, but that is not enough. You
cannot get trapped in conspiracy theories, frozen by the impossibility
of looking everywhere and seeing everything. You must be creative
enough to eliminate the causes of your paranoia, or at least bottle
themupsothesedemonsareconstrainedtoasmallpartofthesystem.
Smoking Out Bugs
How can we ﬁnd bugs in programs when we don’t know what the answer
should be? This was the case in our system. We certainly did not know
how successful we should have been at predicting the outcome of jai alai
matches when we wrote the program. For every problem we encountered,
there would be two distinct sources of possible error:
I Our underlying mathematical model did not accurately describe the
real world. This meant a fundamental problem in the design of our
system.
155

CALCULATED BETS
I The computer program did not implement the mathematical model
as we had intended. This presumably meant a problem that could be
solved by rewriting the appropriate portion of the program. But we had
to ﬁnd it ﬁrst.
The most frustrating aspect of debugging our system was ﬁguring out
which of these possibilities were the real source of our problem. At this
point,oursimulatedbettingstrategiesreportedthatwewerelosingmoney
at a rate of about 20% per bet. This suggested that we were doing no better
than any grandmother betting on her favorite color would. It was not clear
whether we had bugs that could be ﬁxed or if in fact Grandma had a good
thing going relative to us.
This form of uncertainty occurs in interpreting the results of any sim-
ulation or mathematical model. Every so often you read that physicists
have performed supercomputer simulations of what happens when galax-
ies collide, the results of which inexorably imply that the Big Bang did
(or did not) happen. It is prudent to be highly suspicious of such simula-
tions unless the physicists can also bang two actual galaxies together to
see what really happens.
Finding and ﬁxing bugs in computer programs are very tricky things
to do, even in applications in which you know exactly what the program
is supposed to do and how it works. A company like Microsoft employs
roughly one full-time tester for every computer programmer in order to
boost the reliability of its products. Still, this programmer can create bugs
at a faster rate than the tester can discover them.
Agoodprogrammercananticipatebugsinasystembyidentifyingwhat
he or she did not know how to do in a clean, correct manner. I was once
privileged to witness the spectacle of Stephen Wolfram demonstrating his
Mathematica computer algebra system to William Kahan, who is perhaps
the world’s leading authority on performing accurate numerical computa-
tions. Now Wolfram is a very bright guy – winner of the MacArthur Founda-
tion genius award and recipient of his Ph.D. at age 20 – and Mathematica is
an excellent product. But Kahan is no slouch, either. Within a few minutes
of stepping up to the console, Kahan had Mathematica merrily proving
that 0.9999 = 1 and that −1 = 1. From there, he proved that day was night,
as Wolfram shrank in horror.
I’ve heard the following tale told of IBM’s OS 360, the biggest software
development project of its time. A large staff of programmers set to work

repairing bugs as they were found by users, gradually improving the reli-
ability of the product. Eventually, their progress slowed and ceased with
roughly a thousand known bugs still infesting the system. No matter how

The Millennium Bug
As we were developing our system, the specter of the millennium bug (or
the Year 2000 problem) slowly but surely eased its way into the conscious-
ness of the general public. People became aware that computer systems
around the world were at serious risk of failing on the morning of January
1, 2000, owing to what sounded like the most ridiculous and trivial of pro-
grammer errors. My personal favorite doomsday scenarios included the
following:
I December 31, 1999: Grand Ballroom, Waldorf–Astoria Hotel – The
cream of New York society, powerful gray-haired men in tuxedos with
diamond-studded trophy wives, gather to drink and dance in the new
century. 10–9–8–7–6–5–4–3–2–1! We have reached the twentyﬁrst
century!
Suddenly several men around the room start clutching their chests,
unable to breath. Inside their bodies, pacemakers programmed with
the millennium bug have begun to party like it’s 1999. . .
I December 31, 1999: United States Strategic Air Command Head-
quarters – Renegade General Duke Hazard lights up a victory cigar
deep within a top-secret bunker under the Colorado Rockies. The clock
strikes 9 P.M. It is the moment he had spent 5 years planning for,
waiting for. The rotation of the earth has already changed the cen-
tury throughout Europe and Asia, and the United States now awaits its
turn to ring in the century with a bang.
But not anywhere near the bang General Hazard had in mind! He
knows that the militaries of every other power on earth lie paralyzed by
the millennium bug. With one all-out nuclear strike we could eliminate
thethreatofChina,Russia,Iraq,Libya–onceandforall.Hecaressesthe
button that will irrevocably send off the missiles and bombers when
he pushes it. The true Manifest Destiny of the United States is being on
the right side of the International Dateline at the right time, he muses.
157

But outside his bunker, a crack team led by Bruce Willis attacks the
hardened concrete, racing against time to save the world from utter
destruction . . .
Fortunately, neither of these scenarios was destined to happen; indeed
in retrospect Y2K seems much ado about nothing. However, billions of
dollars had to be spent ﬁxing programs to ensure that business and society
continued to function properly at the start of the century.
The millennium bug was usually described as the result of a program-
mer’s ill-advised attempts to save the memory space it took to store the
“19” at the front of every year. Thirty years ago, this may have been true.
But in fact, the most insidious occurrences of the bug were not a result
of space parsimony so much as a human inability to anticipate trouble in
something that seemed like it was working correctly.
Lurking within our jai alai system was a good example of a millennium
bug. Each night our program fetched the next day’s schedules and yester-
day’s results, and this data had to be stored in ﬁles. We gave each ﬁle a
name that encoded as much information as possible about what it was.
For example, we named the Milford Afternoon results and schedule ﬁles
for a particular date ma-08-22-98.res and ma-08-22-98.sch, respectively.
In various contexts, our program assumed two-digit dates because they
read better than the full four-digit dates. Sure, the extra two digits were
wasted space, but who cares about the cost of such a tiny amount of mem-
ory. But the extra digits were a pain for the people who had to read the
dates.
Two-digit dates don’t necessarily present a problem, provided they
are computed correctly from four-digit dates. The obvious algorithm is
to take the given year and subtract 1900 from it. Obvious but wrong! Sure
1996 −1900 = 96, but 2000 −1900 = 100, which is no longer a two-digit
number! Extra logic has to be added to chop it down to two digits.
After making such changes, Roger assured me that the system will con-
tinue to predict jai alai matches into next century, and indeed it came
through New Year’s Day 2000 like a champ. We should now be in the clear
until 2096, when the earliest of the data we collected will start to have ﬁle
names that will collide with our latest retrievals. At this point, I do not
trust our system to work after 2096, but we can take care of this in due
time. Of course, this is the kind of thinking that got us in trouble with the
millennium bug in the ﬁrst place, but I will be very happy if I get to deal
with the problem at that time.

ENGINEERING THE SYSTEM
Program Trading in Jai Alai
Rogerdiligentlybeatonthejaialaisystem,ﬁxingbugs,tighteningthecode,
making sure he understood how every line of the program works.
With the system clean and stable, he now systematically conducted
experiments on its performance. He took 3 months’ worth of schedules
and results and evaluated a raft of different betting strategies on them.
Each betting strategy was described by three parameters: (1) the subset of
games we were studying (evenings, matinees, or both for a given fronton),
(2) the α value described earlier regulating how aggressively we favored the
stronger player, and (3) the expected-return threshold that regulated how
advantageous a bet had to be before we were willing to risk it. In principle,
thehigherwesetourexpected-returnthreshold,thegreaterthepercentage
of our proﬁts should have been. However, a lower threshold might return
greater total proﬁts by enabling us to place more money-making bets even
if the yield-per-bet was less. We needed to ﬁnd the right point to skim off
the most cream.
Roger kept our computers busy for a week trying every possible betting
strategy. The results were clear and consistent. There was no cream to skim
with any of them. All lost money at about the same rate as random chance.
How could this be? We racked our heads trying to ﬁgure out what was
wrong with the model. I repeatedly sent Roger away in search of bugs, but
he kept coming back giving the program a clean bill of health.
If our programs didn’t have bugs, the problem had to be in our model.
But where could it be? Our Monte Carlo simulation was straightforward
enough to trust, but what about our assessment of player skills? It dawned
on us that almost 90% of all jai alai matches are doubles matches, yet
we were maintaining statistics about individual players, not teams. To
predict how good a team was, we averaged the skills of the two athletes
involved. But did this make sense? It was easy to imagine pairs of highly
talented players who couldn’t stand each other, and other pairs whose
skills complemented each other so they were better as a team than as
individuals. Certainly teams with more experience were likely to do better
than a pair thrown together for the ﬁrst time.
We decided to give the system one last chance and use team records
to measure player skill. This presented some minor problems because the
number of teams is potentially enormous. Note that a stable of 50 players
could generate up to 50 × 49/2 = 1225 teams to keep track of, but in fact
most possible pairings never occurred.
159

CALCULATED BETS
To give ourselves the best possible chance, we also incorporated
trifecta box betting. By betting on the box 1–2–3, we had bets on all six pos-
sible orderings (permutations) of the three numbers. But the minimum
bet on a trifecta box at Milford was $9 versus $3 per trifecta. Although we
would get paid off as if we only made a $1.50 bet on the winning trifecta,
this enabled us to reduce our impact on the pool in the event of successful
bets, which is what seemed to be killing us. Of course, we had to place bets
on nonoptimal trifectas to get the volume discount, but if the stars were
properly in alignment this could be a much better deal.
After incorporating the team statistics and trifecta boxes, Roger again
ﬁred up the program to search for successful betting strategies. Again the
computer ground away for a week. But this time, there was sunshine at the
end. Indeed, there was a strategy offering positive expected returns. We
had been doing such a lousy job evaluating teams that the entire system
was lost in the fog. But now we had reason to believe.
Now that we had something worth working with, Roger set up the
program to run in a daily production mode. Each morning, the pro-
gram sent me e-mail with a list of possible bets and results for next day’s
matches. For example, on a particular Wednesday in November the system
sent me this list of recommended bets:

The ﬁrst number represents the game number of the desired bet, and
the second ﬁeld the type of bet recommended. Field three gives the
recommended post position to invest in followed by the amount of money
to bet. The last ﬁeld gives an inﬂated estimate of the expected return of the

As a result of Roger’s experiments, we were now ready to go into

The Jai Alai Maven
We now had in place a system that appeared to predict the results of the
next day’s jai alai matches accurately. Each day, our program woke up at
2:30 A.M. and then again at 4:30 A.M. to look at the schedule of games to be
played that day at Milford and Dania. For each pair of opposing players
or teams P1 and P2 in each scheduled game, the program used statistics
for the past year to estimate the probability that P1 would win the point
played against P2. Once it had all these probabilities, the program would
161

CALCULATED BETS
simulate each game 250, 000 times and then produce a list of all the bets
that it felt offered a sufﬁciently high return to warrant betting on.
The 2:30 A.M. version of the program differed from the 4:30 A.M. version
only in the value of the fudge factor α. The early program used a conserva-
tive α = 1, whereas the late program used the more aggressive α = 0.4. By
comparing the two results, we could see whether the early program caught
the worm.
Each invocation of the program provided a fairly long list of bets it
assessed as offering reasonable returns. Betting on all of them would have
costmeover$1000adayinbets,whichwasmuchtoorichformybloodand
too much data for me to be able to keep track of how well the system was
doing. For this reason, I wrote a short program to merge the conservative
and aggressive selections and identify a more exclusive subset of good bets
under the following criteria:
I Make any win, place, or show bet the conservative program thought
offered positive returns or the aggressive program thought offered at
least $0.50 proﬁt per dollar bet.
I Because the system offered up considerably more quiniela and exacta
betting possibilities, make any quiniela or exacta bet the conservative
program thought offered positive returns and the aggressive program
thought offered at least $5.00 proﬁt per dollar bet.
I Because trifecta box bets were more expensive than the other bets
(they cost us $9 at Milford instead of $3), we needed an even stricter
investment criteria. The system would make any trifecta box bet the
conservative program thought offered positive returns and the aggres-
sive program thought offered at least $6.00 proﬁt per dollar bet.
I named this selection program Maven, which is a Yiddish word for
“self-proclaimed expert.” After ﬁnal tuning, my jai alai Maven and I were
ready for the test.
On the Wire
I live in New York, and the nearest jai alai action resides a 2-hour drive
from me in Connecticut or a 2-hour ﬂight from me in Florida. I’m not
such a self-destructive gambler to incur such transit times just to make a
bet – particularly for a system that seeks to bet only a modest amount each
day. But to test the system, we had to ﬁnd someone to take our money. I
thought about striking a deal with local people in Connecticut and Florida
162

ENGINEERING THE SYSTEM
to serve as my betting agents, but then I would have had to give them a cut
of the action. Eventually, I found a simpler, more elegant solution.
Manystatesprovideoff-trackbetting(OTB)facilitiesthatenablepeople
who can’t make it to the racetrack to put down bets legally. These OTB
parlorsareusuallyfairlyseedy-lookingplacesﬁlledwithlow-lifecharacters
watching TV screens that show how their latest investments are paying off.
In the 1970s, OTB services were touted as a way to help the horse-racing
industry, which was suffering as state lotteries began siphoning off much
of their action. When casino gambling began spreading through the land,
OTB ofﬁces tried to compete by offering simulcasting, the ability to watch
and bet on any race (or fronton) anywhere in the country, not just at local
tracks.
Simulcasting helped, but not enough. The ﬁscal health of racetracks,
frontons, and the OTB itself continued to deteriorate. Indeed, certain
politicians in New York have recently been making hay complaining that
only state government could manage to lose money running a bookie op-
eration. Because the OTB parlors themselves are as popular as the plague
in most of the neighborhoods they reside in, more creative thinking was
required.
The Connecticut OTB, in cahoots with its partner Autotote Enterprises,
rose to the occasion by starting On the Wire telephone betting services.
Who needs an OTB parlor at all when you can call in your bets from
home or ofﬁce? On the Wire enables its customers to speak with live
operators eager to take their bets or to dial bets in manually using an
interactive voice-response system. Indeed, the On the Wire WWW page
(http://www.ctotb.com) stresses the advantages of the latter technology
for married or employed compulsive gamblers:
Bet using the touch tone key pad on your phone and no one around
you will be aware you are placing a wager through your phone account.
All the bets are made using a toll-free telephone number, which pre-
sumably has the additional advantage of never appearing on anyone’s
telephone bill.
I sent in an initial $250 deposit to Autotote Enterprises and a few
days later was rewarded with a letter containing my account number and
instructions on how to bet. Deposit and withdrawal tickets were provided
as with any other ﬁnancial institution. The seven deposit and only four
withdrawalticketsmadeforanominousasymmetry,butoneprobablywell
163

CALCULATED BETS
justiﬁed given the nature of Autotote’s business. A cheaply mimeographed
sheet listed all the betting events for the coming month, including horse
racing at a variety of tracks as well as Dania and Milford jai alai.
A careful reading of its literature made clear the special nature of this
ﬁnancial institution. Checks drawn on business or corporate accounts
are not accepted, which is a lesson presumably learned from hard expe-
rience. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) insists on tax withholdings of
28% whenever winnings exceed $5000. All betting conversations are recor-
ded on tape to prevent customers from later disowning their unsuccessful
investments.
Dialing bets in via On the Wire was fairly easy. A call to their toll-free
phone number was answered by a cheerful four-note jingle and a soothing
recorded voice:
Welcome to On the Wire automated teller. Enter your
account number, followed by the pound key.
The proper stream of digits yielded the soothing voice again:
Enter your personal identification number, followed
by the pound key.
After entering this four-digit code, the system would pause a while to
checkmeout.Ifallwasinorder,thevoicewouldinformmeofmyholdings:
Your account balance is two hundred and fifty dollars.
For track conditions enter 99 pound.
A harsher, metallic voice now set down to business:
Track?
It wanted the code of the fronton session where we wanted to
bet. Milford matinees and evenings were 78 and 79, respectively. Dania
matinees and evenings were 92 and 93, followed of course by the pound
key.
Race?
Which game did you wish to bet on? Presumably this was a number
between 1 and 15.
Bet amount?
164

ENGINEERING THE SYSTEM
Here we could type in any amount we wanted, in dollars, subject to the
minimum allowable bet. The “*” key was available to serve as a decimal
point if needed, as on trifecta box bets.
Bet type?
Each possible type of bet had a numerical code associated with it. The
code for a win was “11,” while “32” would get you a trifecta box.
Runners?
Here the system would prompt you for the post position numbers (be-
tween 1 and 8) of the players you wished to bet on. For quiniela, exacta,
and trifecta bets that involved more than one post position, the entries
were separated with the “*” key.
You have requested Milford Jai-Alai, evening, game 5,
for one dollar fifty cents on trifecta box 3-5-6. Press
1 to confirm.
On conﬁrming the bet, the system would inform you of the size of
your now diminished balance and return to “Track?” Entering a “*” or
just hanging up the phone would end this session. Personally, I pre-
ferred entering a “*” so I could listen as their machine thanked me for my
business.

of intricate card-counting system. This system turns the odds in your favor
instead of the house’s, offering, say, a 1.5% per hand positive return. Now
seat this intelligent, restless sort of person at a blackjack table, where his
or her disciplined, intense play pays off at up to $50 per hour. For the ﬁrst
few hours, the card counter will think, “Cool! I am sitting here taking the
casino’s money.”
But over the course of the next 100 hands or so, reality will gradually
but inevitably set in. Your eyes will start to get glassy from the glare of the

and your head will start pounding from the strain of keeping track of all
those numbers. “What the hell am I doing here? I never wanted to be a
bank clerk, even at $50 an hour!” You will storm out of the casino and buy
a book on the stock market, or preferably this one, on jai alai.
The same thing happened to me in the course of phoning in my bets,
and it didn’t take a hundred hands. Five or six was more like it. Phoning in
each bet took close to a minute of punching in a list of digits printed out by
a machine and then waiting until another machine read back my bets and
asked for my conﬁrmation. It didn’t take long before the glamor wore off.
There was no way I would spend the 15–20 minutes per day of mindless
dialing it would require to really test our system out.
It was time to put technology to work for the betterment of man. When
computerswanttotalkonthetelephone,theyuseadevicecalledamodem.
A modem, short for modulator–demodulator, is a device that translates
arbitrary text and data into tones suitable to be sent down a phone line
and converts another modem’s tones back into its original text and data.
Anyone who has ever tried talking to a fax machine or interrupted junior’s
AOL session by picking up the phone has some idea what these tones
sound like. But other computers don’t mind listening to them, and such
communication is the real foundation of the Internet revolution.
My ﬁrst modem was a 300-baud acoustic coupler model for which you
hand dialed the phone number of the computer you wanted to reach,
listened for the squeal, and then tried to jam the handset of the telephone
intothetwoblackrubbercuffsfastenoughtoestablishaconnectionbefore
the other machine cut you off. If you got lucky, you were rewarded with
text streaming across your computer screen at the speed of a slow typist.
From these humble beginnings, modem technology has matured in
a big way. Acoustic cuffs disappeared years ago in favor of jacks plug-
ging directly into phone lines, thus increasing reliability and speed. To-
day’s modems operate at 56 kilobaud on standard telephone lines, roughly
200 times faster than what I started with.
Eliminating the acoustic couplers meant that the modem had to be
smart enough to dial the phone for itself. This required the modem to
understandacommandlanguagewithinstructionstodialnumbers,detect
whether a phone answers or is busy, wait prescribed amounts of time
before issuing new commands, and hang up.
Turning modems into programmable devices opened up new worlds
of possibilities for those bold enough to grasp them. By programming
166

ENGINEERING THE SYSTEM
your modem to speed-dial a radio station repeatedly, you could increase
your chances of getting through to win some kind of prize. You could
use your modem for political expression. I recall a bloke who programmed
his modem to call up the Reverend Jerry Falwell’s toll-free fund-raising
number once every minute for several months. This saddled poor Jerry
with quite a phone bill because toll-free calls are paid by the recipient,
not the sender. “Reach out and touch someone,” was the bloke’s motto, at
least until the courts shut him down. While he was still in high school, my
old roommate Luke programmed his home computer to conduct an early-
morning search for telephones answered by computers. Over the next few
months, he systematically woke up every single person in his home town
of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, exactly once.
Fortunately for Luke, those were the days before the caller ID option
was offered by the telephone company. Today, such activities, called
“scanning” or “war-dialing,” are illegal in many places. In particular, the
law in Luke’s current hometown of Colorado Springs, Colorado, makes it
illegal to place a call “without the intent to communicate.”
WhatIhadinmindwasn’tsounsavory.Iwantedtoprogramthemodem
to dial our bets into On the Wire so I didn’t have to phone them in myself.
I needed free access to a modem attached to our departmental computer
systems. This was a problem. In justiﬁable fear of creative students like
Luke, our system’s staff would not let anybody but themselves play with
the modems. They did inform me that one of our faculty members has his
own modem hooked to his own personal computer in his ofﬁce.
Because this professor is Gene Stark, I knew that he would help me with
this project. Why? Well, ﬁrst Gene is a terriﬁc hacker in the best sense of
the word, and thus I knew that he would get a kick out of it. Second, Gene
has had high-tech gambling experience of his own; he was the colleague I
told you about who devised his own card-counting system in blackjack.
Gene was intrigued enough with the project that he wrote the autodi-
aler program himself. Its job was to take a ﬁle of bets and phone them into
Autotote. It was a pleasure watching Gene program, a master at work. His
big hands would dance over the small keyboard, bang–bang–bang, and he
issued commentary as he pecked away.
“Parsetheinputﬁle,initializethemodem,emitthedialingcommands.”
Bang–bang–bang . . .
“Need some structure. Modularize this sucker. One routine to make
each kind of bet.” Bang–bang–bang . . .
167

CALCULATED BETS
Gene was disciplined enough to do things right, not just get something
working. “Always aim for more structure. Nah, that is too crufty. Try it this
way.” Bang–bang–bang . . .
“Good. Let’s see if it talks to the modem.” We could hear garbled sounds
coming through the cheap speaker on his modem. Hiss, bleep,
whine. “Doesn’t work. Why not? The modem is hung trying to talk to
the other machine. It doesn’t get the carrier. Why not? Of course. It’s not
trying connect, just pumping out dial commands.” Bang–bang–bang . . .
“Try it again.”
Hiss, bleep! Welcome to On the Wire automated teller.
Enter beep-beep-beep-beep your account number. I did
not understand your account number. Please try again.
“Our pause timing is off here. Sleep another 5 seconds and try it again.”
Bang–bang–bang . . .
One of the most critical aspects of the autodialer was ﬁguring out how
long to wait before issuing various commands. We were trying to program
the modem to use an interface designed to be used by people. People
phoning in bets would listen to the system prompts and enter the data
when the machine told them it was ready for it. If they goofed, the machine
would tell them why and what to do from that point. But our modem was
deafanddidn’tunderstandEnglish.Itcouldnothearanypromptsfromthe
system, let alone understand them. All it could do was pump out touch-
tones at prescribed intervals in time. By timing the On the Wire system
with a stop watch, we could estimate how long it would take the system to
react and pause accordingly between data items.
Hiss, bleep! Welcome to On the Wire automated teller.
beep-beep-beep-beep,...,
beep-beep-beep-beep,
Your
account balance is now two hundred and forty seven
dollars...
“Ha-ha-ha,” Gene laughed. “It just spent your money. I sure hope you
know what you’re doing with this jai alai thing.”
We sat there for a while listening to the two machines talking to each
other. The modem would issue commands, wait patiently until its partner
stopped talking and then dial in its next request. I’ve had conversations
like that, when someone is babbling so much that I just remove the phone
from my ear and wait until he or she is ﬁnished talking. But here, it was a
machine doing the talking as well. It was the dumb talking to the deaf.
168

ENGINEERING THE SYSTEM
Gene’s only stipulation was that our computer had to be off his phone
by the time he came into the ofﬁce each morning. This meant that we had
to start dialing in our bets by about 7:30 A.M. or so to be sure we ﬁnished on
time. This was before On the Wire ofﬁcially opened for business, and thus
about half the time our bets didn’t take. Still, it was well worth this amount
of shrinkage to avoid the drudgery of phoning the bets in by hand.
Phoningthebetsinthatearlymayalsohavehadanadvantage,because
it might scare off any bettor watching the odds board. Our bets could serve
to depress the preliminary odds enough that these bottom-feeders would
be induced to pick other options instead, thus reducing our competition.
Considerations like this made it impossible to simulate exactly how the
system would perform in real life. We had to place actual bets to see if we
knew what we were doing.
I’d occasionally get to work early enough to catch the modem phoning
in the bets. Whenever I did, I’d press my ear against Gene’s ofﬁce door
to hear what was going on. I’d hear foggy touch-tones going beep-beep-
beep-beep followed by a mufﬂed, synthesized voice thanking an empty
room for its business.

“I don’t trust it,” he’d say.
We had to insulate Gene’s machine from the entire jai alai system while
getting him the bets. The solution was to e-mail the bets to a special ad-
dress on his ofﬁce machine and have his e-mail handling software respond
appropriately to it.

header information, and then invoking Otto the Autodialer on the given

Gene’s system was now safely protected from my jai alai program, al-
though this nifty e-mail interface exposed my money to a certain amount

message to this account. Otto would be just as happy to phone in these
bets as it would be to phone in mine. Indeed, an evil person could drain all
my money away making 6–8–7 trifecta bets if he or she were appropriately
informed and devious.
This introduces us to an important and surprisingly intricate problem
of contemporary computer science, namely, “convince me that you are
who you say you are.” I needed to ﬁnd a way to prevent Otto from listening
to anyone except me. How could I convince it I was who I said I was?
The most common approach to solving such identiﬁcation problems
involves the use of a password. If you and I are the only ones who know
the secret password, than you can e-mail the password to me in order
to convince me that you are you. But what’s the catch? Anybody on any
computerthise-mailpassesthroughmightbesnoopinginonourmessage.
Thus, he or she could easily discover the password. From this moment on,
heorshecouldmasqueradeaseitherofus.Thisisexactlywhymanypeople
(including me) are reluctant to use their credit card to order anything over
the Internet. The bad guys may be watching.
More important even than safeguarding my credit card number, user
authentication problems can be a matter of life and death. Consider the
friend-or-foe identiﬁcation systems in ﬁghter aircraft used in the military.
Combatamongﬁghteraircraftisahigh-speed,high-stakesbusiness.Imag-
ine I’m a pilot. Radar reports an unknown craft rapidly closing in on my
tail. Friend or foe? If I’m wrong, I’ll shoot down my buddy, or even worse,
someone will shoot me down.
Friend or foe? Passwords won’t work well for this application. The
opposing side certainly has radio receivers and can listen in on everything
we transmit to each other. As soon as I broadcast the password, the other
side could discover it and teach its aircraft the magic word to sneak up on
us. We could change the password often, but that is a dangerous game. If
my buddy’s password ever gets slightly out of date, he’s toast – I’m liable to
shoot him down for his carelessness.
Real military friend-or-foe systems work by conducting a question-
and-answer session between the two parties. Both parties have stored up

a large series of questions and answers. I’ll send you a random stream of
numbers corresponding to the questions I want to ask you. You send me

enables us to protect our secrets while facilitating authentication.
So, how does Gene’s e-mail-handling software safeguard my money by
processing messages only from me? I’m not telling. Any information I give
here will only help young hackers (the future Lukes of America) ﬁgure out
how to break into my system. And I’m not interested in making any 6–8–7
trifecta bets, thank you.
Internet Gambling
Various sectors of the so-called gaming industry are excited about the
prospects for widespread Internet gambling, and chaﬁng at the regulatory
constraints that are delaying its widespread introduction.
I’ve seen the volume of legal gambling in the United States estimated as
high as $500 billion per year. This works out to almost $2000 per person per
year. Even a small fraction of this total is a healthy chunk of change. I hate
to think what the amount of illegal gambling is! The Interactive Gaming
Council reports that more than $1.2 billion were bet in its member’s 700
cyber casino sites in 1999. This is an amazing number comparable to the
$1.6 billion dollars in sales that Amazon.com had in the same year. This
gives new perspective on who really runs the Internet. The United States
Justice Department and Senator Jon Kyle estimate that this annual total
could grow to $10 billion within a few years.
Internet gambling differs in many important ways from conventional
gambling. Whether these changes are positive or negative depends upon
your perspective:
I Loss of community control – Today, for better or worse, state, local, or
tribal government regulates the opportunities for legal gambling. If
the people of a given region believe that casino gambling is harmful,
it will be forbidden. If the people of a given region believe that casino
gambling is good for economic development, they can pass a law and
must live with the consequences.
But Internet gambling has no such geographic limitations. Any-
one with a computer is a potential player, even in the most righteous
171

CALCULATED BETS
community on earth. The problems of compulsive gambling won’t go
away, and indeed their effects will stay local. All the beneﬁts, such as
potential proﬁts, taxes, and jobs won’t stay local but instead get sucked
off into cyberspace.
I Lack of regulation – You are playing virtual roulette in a virtual casino.
After 10 straight blacks you just know the next ball will be red. You
swallow hard as you put down a $10,000 wager on red. It is more than
you ever dreamed of betting, and frankly more than you can afford. It
comes up black, again. You lose.
But how do you know that the game was fair? Perhaps the pro-
grammer decided to make the ball fall in the slot which minimizes the
amountreturnedtobettors,insteadoffairlypickingarandomnumber.
The WWW site you have been sending your money to is on an unin-
habited island in the Bahamas. If the game wasn’t fair, who could you
complain to, anyway?
I Lack of infrastructure – Expanding casino gambling from an enclave
in Las Vegas into a nationwide “gaming” industry required a consid-
erable investment in infrastructure and personnel. Massive hotels and
powerful politicians had to be bought, the latter to help steer reluctant
legislatures towards legalizing their business.
Interestingly, it is the established gaming industry that has the most
to lose if Internet gambling gains a foothold in the hearts and minds
of gamblers. Operating an Internet gambling site does not require
a 3000-room hotel in Vegas. Indeed, well-known establishments like
Caesar’s Palace have no particular edge in building a virtual casino.
Instead, they face the prospect of their customers’ sitting home glued
to their computer screens. Why lose money in Atlantic City when you
can do so from the comfort of your living room?
TheInternetGamblingProhibitionActof1997waspassedbytheSenate
on July 23, 1998, by a vote of 90–10. This act amends the Federal criminal
code to prohibit and set penalties for: (1) placing, receiving, or otherwise
making a bet or wager via the Internet or any other interactive computer
service in any State, and (2) engaging in the business of betting or wagering
through the Internet or any such service. There are exceptions for state
lotteries, horse racing, and (yes) jai alai.
As of this writing, the House of Representatives has failed to vote this
bill into law. Special interests line up for or against it in interesting ways.
172

ENGINEERING THE SYSTEM
Liquor store owners and religious groups are for the legislation, but per-
haps from different motives. The liquor dealers fear a reduction in their
lotteryticketsalesowingtocompetitionwithon-linelotteries.Asurprising
collection of state governors stand quietly against it, with their eyes open
to losing revenue from these same lotteries.
Internet gambling is currently legal in 50 countries, including Liecht-
enstein, Gibraltar, Australia, and certain Caribbean countries – more than
enough to cause trouble. A California woman who lost $70,000 to an over-
seas virtual casino sued her credit card company, asserting that she should
get their cut of this action.
The Internet Gambling Prohibition Act is broad enough potentially to
threaten full deployment of our jai alai system to frontons beyond those
supported by On the Wire. In particular, we could imagine e-mailing our
pickstoalocalagent,whowouldplaceourbetsforusinNewportorMiami.
As I read the act, this might be a Federal crime, even though it would be
perfectly legal to have our same program spewing out the predictions on
the agent’s own personal computer.
This act works by extending the current prohibitions against using
telephones for interstate gambling. There are serious consequences for
those who violate it:
Whoever, being engaged in the business of betting or wagering know-
ingly uses a communication facility for the transmission or receipt in
interstate or foreign commerce of bets or wagers, information assisting
in the placing of bets or wagers, or a communication that entitles the
transmitter or receiver to the opportunity to receive money or credit
as a result of bets or wagers, shall be ﬁned not more than $10,000,
imprisoned not more than 2 years, or both.
The prohibition against using telephones for interstate gambling has
proven to be a powerful legal tool against organized crime. It presumably
does not apply to my use of On the Wire because the statute provides
exemptions as regulated by state law. As a prerequisite to opening my
account, I had to assert that I live in one of the states that permits off-
track wagering; fortunately, New York is one of these states. Still, it was
disconcerting to learn how close my system came to violating Federal law.
If caught, I feel pretty sure it would have been me doing the time, not
Maven.

classes,andthustheprogramwasn’tdestinedtoimproveintheforeseeable

event – maybe a hardware problem, maybe Milford changing its WWW
site – would put us out of business for good. My On the Wire account was
stocked with $250. It was time to put the system to the test.
A Gambler’s Diary
On July 29, 1998, Maven made its ﬁrst six bets for $3 each. I bided my time
until late that night when I could call in to see how I did.
Your account balance is $263.50.
I was a winner! I could stop now and forever be ahead. But I was a
winner! And I wanted to keep on winning.
The ﬁrst few days I kept the bet amounts small as we ironed out timing
problems with the autodialer. Still, risking even $20 gave me some pause.
Your account balance is $242.50.
This gave me a sinking feeling. I’d lost my winnings, and more. Was
there a bug with my program? Would I ever go ahead again?

PUTTING MY MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH IS
Your account balance is $264.40.
Your account balance is $261.40.
Your account balance is $258.40.
Your account balance is $272.80.
The autodialer was clearly working. The program seemed to be making
money. At least it wasn’t giving it away. I lowered the proﬁtability threshold
to convince Maven to make more bets, and on August 26 it put $99 at risk.
I was more nervous than usual when I listened that night:
Your account balance is $408.70.
Big win! In the news, the Russian government had defaulted on its
debt, setting off a sharp stock market decline. Because my pension funds
are invested in stocks, it meant I was probably several thousand dollars
poorer for the day. But what did that matter! I was winning at jai alai.
Flushed with success, the phone call to get the day’s results became a
favorite evening ritual . . .
Your account balance is $350.20.
Your account balance is $384.10.
Your account balance is $302.80.
Alittlelossdidn’tbotherme.Afterall,Iwasplayingnowwiththehouse’s
money. I was ahead of the game . . .
Your account balance is $284.80.
I came to see that wins always came in spurts. The program liked long
shots, and they only came in every few days.
Your account balance is $300.10.
Your account balance is $223.30.
It was September 9, and suddenly I was behind. And on this day of all
days, Maven decided to bet nearly twice as much as it ever had before,
$169.00. If I got wiped out for the day, my account would nearly be dry.
Certainly I would have to throttle back my bets if I was going to make this
money last. It was with more than the usual trepidation that I called my
electronic bookie that night:
Your account balance is $499.75.

Dynamite! I had now almost doubled my money! The system worked!
When I was winning, this nightly phone call was a source of immense
pleasure to me. It was less thrilling to my wife Renee, who started ques-
tioning what kind of man she had married.
Your account balance is $409.75.
Your account balance is $367.15.
I felt like I was participating in a modern type of pushbutton war-
fare. You hit a switch to send off thousands of missiles, reach for a beer,
and then check the videos to see how much you scored. I felt a similar
bloodless disconnect between the simulations we were doing and the ac-
tual sporting events that were generating my new balance each night.
Back at the fronton, two dozen Basques played their guts out in every
match, laboring in blissful ignorance of the fact that this game had been
played 500,000 times the night before. The likelihood of each possible out-
come had already been foretold. All the Basques were doing (in physics
jargon) was collapsing this probabilistic wave function down to its ground
state.
Similarly, each night I checked my phone to ﬁnd out how much money
I had won without knowing or caring who had won it for me and how
well they had played. The e-mail report I received each morning told
me which bets had paid off the previous night, but this report didn’t in-
clude player names or identiﬁcation numbers – just their post position in
the match. The only hint of humanity in this entire process, and it was
just a hint, came on the right-hand side of the list of proposed bets. For
each bet, we reported the expected probability of its winning that given
match. The discerning eye could tell that player 3 in game three was
deemed more skillful than player 3 in game four and was hence a bet-
ter investment.
For this reason, I’m aware that this recital of my bet outcomes suffers
from a fundamental ﬂaw. The stories of winning a jai alai match would
be inﬁnitely more interesting if the matches were about people. My tales
would be about the chic-chac shot Enrique made to win game seven or the
way the crowd cried “Fix!” when Laxhi muffed an easy catch in game nine.
War movies were inﬁnitely more interesting when people shot people,
instead of people shooting missiles.
Your account balance is $349.15.
176

PUTTING MY MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH IS
It was September 23, 1998. Maven got ambitious again, making $156
worth of bets.
Your account balance is $505.75.
Maven was on a roll. I got a feeling of conﬁdence whenever it wanted
to make a large amount of bets. The system always looked for values, and
when the right players sat in the right position it was ready to move in full
throttle.
Your account balance is $765.40.
Your account balance is $795.70.
Maven seemed invincible. Only it really wasn’t. Over the next several
days I noticed that it seemed only to want to make win, place, and show
bets and didn’t do so well with them.
Your account balance is $778.00.
Your account balance is $768.40.
Your account balance is $756.40.
Your account balance is $750.40.
In search of the quiniela and boxes that had done so well before, I
lookedcarefullyatthevariousprogramactivitylogs.Itbecameclearthatfor
some reason the 4:30 A.M. run of the program (with α = 0.4) was crashing
instead of completing, and thus the more adventurous bets were never
being found.
Roger wasn’t quite sure what caused the problem, but he rummaged
around and restarted everything. And it seemed to help. The next day
Maven made $117 in bets. I relaxed; the program always did well when it
made a lot of bets. Except this time:
Your account balance is $687.70.
Your account balance is $646.00.
Your account balance is $577.00.
Your account balance is $544.60.
I started taking the losses personally and Renee grew even less happy
with the project. “Do you have to call every night?” she asked. “Yes, I’m
doing research, dammit!,” I insisted.
Your account balance is $536.50.
Your account balance is $497.50.
177

CALCULATED BETS
Throughout October my balance continued to plunge. There was an
occasional winning day, but it didn’t take long for me to give that money
back to the fronton.
Although the downhill trend was evident, the cause for it was not. Per-
haps the bug in the program from before hadn’t gone away and was lurking
in a corrupted data ﬁle. Or perhaps there was no bug. The system lived and
died by the laws of probability. One had to expect cold streaks as well as
hot streaks.
The problem was that it was impossible to tell which of these two
possibilities was reality. You could go crazy hunting for a bug that wasn’t
there. Or you could go broke waiting for your luck to turn when your luck
wasn’t what was broken.
Similar issues arise in properly interpreting apparent concentrations
of diseases. “Cancer clusters” have been discovered on Long Island, re-
gions where the incidence of breast cancer appears to be two to three
times higher than the national average. However such concentrations
are likely to occur somewhere by random chance, and thus it is very
unclear whether this is a real phenomenon or a phantom. Breast can-
cer has become an important political issue here, even though I haven’t
seen a single elected representative take a pro-breast cancer position.
Still, voters demand that they do something about it. There seems to
be no obvious environmental culprit to pin it on except the opposing
candidate.
Throughout this gloomy period, the autodialer worked faithfully, rising
early in the morning to place my worthless bets. On October 29, for what-
ever reason, my bets were not logged. Needless to say, those bets would
have won $120. Maven was playing head games with me, and all I could
do was watch my account diminish.
Your account balance is $497.50.
Your account balance is $440.50.
Your account balance is $408.40.
On November 1, as it did at the beginning of each month, the program
recalculated its statistical models of player skills. This provided an intel-
lectually honest reason to hope that the $351 hit that I took in October
would be exorcized.
On the morning of November 4, Maven tried to make a $72 investment
that the autodialer didn’t seem to approve of. It was still early enough to
178

PUTTING MY MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH IS
phone them in again, but I was somewhat gun-shy after tabulating the
previous month’s losses. I took a deep breath and executed the command
to tell Otto to try again.
Your account balance is $705.10.
We were back in business! One big night and we recouped almost all
of the month’s losses! Maybe it was our stats that had been corrupted, and
all was in order now. Maybe not. But it was time to go with the ﬂow and
see where it took us.
Your account balance is $689.80.
Your account balance is $637.00.
Your account balance is $574.60.
Your account balance is $768.70.
Another big night! Again, the bets had not taken that morning. But I
was keeping an eye on things and making sure that as much of Maven’s
intended bets as possible were going to get made. It was a bumpy ride, but
I was convinced that we were on the upswing.
Your account balance is $723.70.
Your account balance is $679.00.
Today, Maven only wanted to make one $3 win bet. It seemed that the
bug from last month had returned. But I checked through the logs, and
everything looked OK. It was as if Maven held up its nose at the offerings
in the marketplace.
Your account balance is $695.50.
Such taste! Such reﬁnement! The next day, Maven bet $129. Anything
over $80 seemed destined to lead to a big day. It was with great conﬁdence
that I checked the machine that night:

The program started breaking in mid-December again, or so it seemed.
It attempted no bets on December 13, nor on December 15 or 16. An
investigation revealed that Milford closed its fronton each year for 2 weeks
before Christmas. Maven refused to bet on games that weren’t played.
I too decided to call it quits for the year. It was time to write up this tale
of our experiences and plan for the future.
I made a graph summarizing all of the bets we made over this 41/2-
month time period and what the results were. The upper line shows the
growth in the value of my account, starting from the initial deposit of
$250. The lower line plots the amount that the system bet each session,
as best as I can tell. I tried to call On the Wire each morning to conﬁrm
how many of our intended bets actually registered with the system, and
each night to ﬁnd out whether we won that day. I may well have misac-
counted a little on each day’s actual bet amount, but my numbers are fairly
accurate.
However, there can be no doubt about the bottom line. On July 29,
1998, the account had $250.00 in it. On December 31, 1998, the account
had $818.35 in it. And the difference was entirely the fronton’s money.
You could say that we increased our capital by 227% over this pe-
riod. You could even say that the increase projects to an annual growth

By making a proﬁt of $568.35 on $3018.00 worth of bets, we made an

Epilogue
Our initial experiments demonstrated that, with jai alai at least, we know
whatwearedoing.Weclearlypredicttheoutcomeofjaialaimatchesbetter
than the general public and well enough to make small but nontrivial
amounts of money.
So, what would be next for Maven? In order to make much more money
off the deal, we had to greatly increase the volume of proﬁtable bets.
But we didn’t dare bet on Dania for fear of certain insidious parser bugs.
And we didn’t dare bet on Miami or Newport for fear of the Internet
Gambling Act. We didn’t even dare bet too much on Milford games,
because relatively few games had bets that showed a clear positive re-
turn. Finally, even when we were brave enough to go for it, Otto the Auto-
dialer often disagreed and did not phone in all the bets. We had much
work to do if were were to increase our number of transactions signiﬁ-
cantly.
Roger came back to work on Maven in the spring of 1999, his last
semester at Stony Brook before starting Ph.D. studies in computer science
at the University of Massachusetts. We beat on the system, improving it,
making it stronger.
I continued letting the original Maven run while we worked on its
successor. I throttled back the number of bets it made so that I didn’t have

to preserve capital for an improved version to play with.

But we had to ﬁnish our changes in a rush, with the semester ending
before we could complete a real validation phase or as much robustness
testing as we would have liked to.
Now Roger was ﬁnished with the project. At this point, the account
contained $865.45. It was now or never for Maven because the robustness
of the program would only deteriorate with time. I gave the new program
phone privileges and hoped for the best. The ﬁrst day, it liked 11 trifecta
boxes, but they didn’t like us back:

To complicate matters, Renee and I were set to spend the entire month
of June 1999 visiting the Polytechnic University (UPC) in Barcelona, Spain.
It is hard to imagine a more wonderful place to be than Barcelona, which is
perhaps the most graceful and civilized city on earth. But the distance and
time difference made it difﬁcult to keep up with what Maven was doing.
My last phone call before we boarded the plane was to On the Wire.
Your account balance is $1105.30.
Ol´e! Maven had hit a new high total again.
Shortly after my arrival, I gave the ﬁrst public lecture on our jai alai
prediction system at the university. The Spaniards were somewhat bafﬂed
by my interest in this regional game of theirs (imagine a European scholar
writingatreatiseontheProBowlersTour)butwerescholarsandsportsmen
enough to get the drift.
Reading my mail from Barcelona proved difﬁcult. Through the magic
of a program called telnet, I could sit at a computer in Spain and have
complete access to my desktop computer in Stony Brook. Thus, I could
reade-mail.Buttherewerenetworkdelaysontheorderofsecondssending
bits around the world even when network trafﬁc was light. And as soon as
the rest of Spain got to work in the morning, forget about it. It would have
been more efﬁcient to hop on a plane and read it from my ofﬁce.
But the news that arrived was very good. It was clear that Maven was
winning. It seemed that every other day for the second week of June, it hit
another box. The reported winnings were clearly several hundred dollars.
I broke down and checked my balance with On the Wire :
Your account balance is $1009.30.
Huh? Where was my money? I could tell that the calls had been placed
by the autodialer, but it seems On the Wire decided this wasn’t the week to
listen – at least to my winning bets.
183

CALCULATED BETS
Renee and I took advantage of our location and visited the Basque
region in Spain, watching remonte action and gazing at the spectacular
scenery. Maven stayed on a roll that third week of June. Again, my e-mail
showed me winning. And again, On the Wire said.
Your account balance is $1009.30.
It was impossible to debug the phone calls by long distance. The fourth
week of June Maven kept picking winners. But I knew what kind of balance
I had waiting for me when I got back.
Your account balance is $1009.30.
After I returned, it became clear why none of our bets were taking.
Autotote had changed its hours, refusing to accept bets until 10 A.M. so
my 7:30 A.M. phone calls hadn’t taken. With Gene keeping summer hours,
however, there was no real barrier to letting Otto call the bets in later. I
reset the timing of the program and crossed my ﬁngers that the results I’d
been seeing hadn’t been ﬁction.

Maven had just cleared almost $1000 in only 2 weeks. The program was
making money fast enough that it was threatening to become a revenue
source instead of just a research project. And that presented me with a
fresh set of problems.
University professors are not supposed to use research computing fa-
cilities to run book-making operations. This project was a harmless ec-
centricity when it was playing for peanuts. But at this scale money would
very quickly become an issue. I made plans to contact the university’s le-
gal counsel, which was a step I feared because it is always easier to beg
forgiveness than get permission. Further, if Maven really started making
money, the students who built it certainly deserved a cut of the action. But
how much?
Maven decided to spare me these problems. Its taste in bets suddenly
regressed to 1–2–4 and 1–2–5 trifectas, losing interest in anything else.
Something had broken deep inside the program. Professors often com-
plain that student-built software works until the day after graduation.
What this really means is that the professors don’t have the skills or the
gumption to maintain it. At least this professor didn’t.
Software rot is a sad but real phenomenon. In principle, software lasts
forever because it is just a stream of bits, and these bits are easily main-
tained on disk with perfect ﬁdelity. Software may be immutable, but the
rest of the world changes around it. Suddenly a new data format arrives
from Milford, or the operating system of our host computer is upgraded.
Software rot is why people must eventually junk Windows 95 – not that it
has changed but because the rest of the world has decayed around it.
Maven’s betting run was over. With a heavy heart and slightly lighter
bank roll, I unplugged Maven from On the Wire. Each night, the pro-
gram continues to scan the net for details of the next day’s jai alai action.
It continues to play each game half a million times before dawn. It con-
tinues to identify the best bets and mail me the results. But the bets have
become as virtual as the simulated games themselves.
I write this book almost one year after our last wager. I wrote a check
for the amount of my winnings and sent it to a charity associated with
the university, to purge my soul and cover my butt. Indeed, a plaque on
185

CALCULATED BETS
display at the Stony Brook Hillel acknowledges the generous support of
the “Jai-Alai Maven.”
Maven still sends me e-mail every morning, and of late it seems our
simulated bets have been winning somewhat more steadily than before.
Maybe the difﬁculties we had encountered were due simply to a corrupted
data ﬁle. If so, after a year it will slip from the Maven’s consciousness and
proﬁtability will be restored.
Retelling this tale has whet my appetite for another round of jai alai
action. If the university lets me, maybe the time has come to bring another
student on board to wrestle with the program anew and bring Maven back
on line. Check http://www.jai-tech.com for the latest on how we are doing.
Hail the Maven evermore!

CHAPTER NINE
HOW SHOULD YOU BET?
The system described in this book retrieves and analyzes data each night
and employs a substantial amount of computational sophistication to de-
termine the most proﬁtable bets to make. It isn’t something you are going
to try at home, kiddies.
However, in this section I’ll provide some hints on how you can make
your trip to the fronton as proﬁtable as possible. By combing the results of
our Monte Carlo simulations and expected payoff model, I’ve constructed
tables giving the expected payoff for each bet, under the assumption that
all players are equally skillful. This is very useful information to have if you
are not equipped to make your own judgments as to who is the best player,
although we also provide tips as to how to assess player skills. By following
my advice, you will avoid criminally stupid bets like the 6–8–7 trifecta.
But ﬁrst a word of caution is in order. There are three primary types of
gamblers:
I (A) Those who gamble to make money – If you are in this category, you
are likely a sick individual and need help. My recommendation instead
would be that you take your money and invest in a good mutual fund.
In particular, the Vanguard Primecap fund has done right well for me
over the past few years.
187

CALCULATED BETS
One theme running through this book is how hard we had to work
in order to make even a small proﬁt. As the saying goes, “gambling is a
hard way to make easy money.” You can’t expect to make a lot of money
without considerably more insight and effort than we expended, and
there are far more proﬁtable places to devote this effort to than a track,
casino, or fronton.
I (B) Those who gamble to lose money – If you are in this category,
you are likely a very sick individual and really need help. I recom-
mend that you contact Gambler’s Anonymous (1-213-386-8789, or
www.gamblersanonymous.org) immediately and get to work on your
problem.
My Grandfather was a problem gambler and almost destroyed him-
self and his family. Don’t let this happen to you or the ones you love.
I (C) Those who gamble to have fun – If you are in this category, I pro-
nounce you perfectly healthy. Modest amounts of wagering can make
any sporting event (including jai alai) more exciting by turning you into
one of the players.
Having Fun Betting on Jai Alai
DamonRunyononcequotedabettorassaying“Ihopetobreakeventoday.
I really need the money.” It is more fun to win than to lose, or even to break
even. The rest of this chapter is intended to show you how to maximize the
amount-of-fun-per-dollar-invested ratio when you go to watch jai alai.
To maximize your chances of having fun, I start with the following
recommendations:
I Go to the fronton – Jai alai is a fantastic sport to watch. You get to see
great professional athletes making amazing plays, and there is nothing
likethesoundofapelotaclickingoffthegranitefrontcourt.Figuringout
the machinations of the Spectacular Seven scoring system is excellent
exercise for the mind. These charms are completely lost when you
invest via off-track betting (OTB) or a phone betting scheme. The kids
will love a day or an evening at the fronton. I greatly recommend the
experience.
I Buy a Pepe’s Green Card – We always do. To be honest, there is no
reason to believe in any of the picks you see there. In fact, a truly
savvy bettor will avoid all of Pepe’s recommendations, not necessar-
ily because they are bad but because too many other people will put
188

HOW SHOULD YOU BET?
their trust in Pepe. Enough copies of the card are sold that the odds on
any suggested bet will likely be seriously depressed and unable to pay
off big even if Pepe is right.
I Always make the minimum bet – The betting pools in jai alai are small
enough that they get saturated by making the minimum bet. Betting
morethantheminimumlikelymeansthatyouarebettingagainstyour-
self. Certainly anyone making more than the minimum bet on any
trifecta ought to have his or her head examined.
If you ﬁnd it much more exciting to have $6 riding on a match
than $3, then you might fall into problem gambler categories (A) or (B)
above.Butifyouaredeterminedtoinvestmorethantheminimum,you
should bet on two separate outcomes. First, you increase the chance
that you will have a winner or at least be close. Second, such a tactic
is justiﬁed by the laws of probability. The expected value E(A + B) of
two random variables A and B satisﬁes the formula
E(A + B) = E(A) + E(B)
regardless of whether the random variables are independent. This
means that whenever you can ﬁnd two bets, both of which (you per-
ceive) have an expectation of a positive return, the sum of the two
bets will also have an expectation of positive return. Thus, don’t bother
worrying whether your 4–1–2 trifecta contradicts your 5–7 quiniela.
If both of these bets are individually good, then they are good in
combination.
I Bet quinielas to maximize your action – In my humble opinion (IMHO),
quiniela bets offer the most entertainment value for your dollar. Under
the Spectacular Seven scoring system, the quiniela offers you enough
possible ways to win that you are likely to be able to identify at least one
relatively promising victory scenario in almost every match. Further,
the payoff is such that if you win once you pay for the evening and
maybe even dinner afterwards.
I Bet show to maximize your chances of cashing a ticket – If you want
to maximize your chances of sauntering up to the cashier and getting
money back, bet on 2 to show. You have a 49% chance of making an
insigniﬁcant amount of money, but at least it means that you won’t be
a total loser for the night.
I Check your tickets carefully before discarding them – Make sure your
tickets are ofﬁcial losers before throwing any of them away. Because
189

CALCULATED BETS
of the Spectacular Seven scoring system, the complexion of a game
can change instantly from defeat to victory. Wait until the scoreboard
declares the results ofﬁcial, because there is always some chance of
disqualiﬁcation or other surprise until then.
Within every gambling establishment lurk a few “stoopers,” peo-
ple who rummage around trying to ﬁnd discarded but winning tickets.
Don’t feed the stoopers. If you have to leave the fronton early, don’t
worry. You typically have up to one year to cash winning tickets, and
the WWW makes it easy to check the results from a distance.
The Best Bets in Jai Alai
Severalbetsinjaialaiofferspectacularlybadvaluebecausetheyarealmost
impossibletowin,andeveniftheyweretowincouldn’tpayoffhighenough
to justify the effort. I provide tables in this section to help you steer clear
of trouble.
Table 9.1 presents what I think are the 30 best and worst trifectas to
bet on. The value column in all of these tables estimates the expected
return for the given bet. A value of 1.0 signiﬁes that the bet is neutral,
meaning that on average you should break even with these bets. Ratios of
above 1.0 are predicted moneymakers, but don’t take these numbers too
seriously. The act of placing a real minimum bet on a given combination
will decrease this ratio; recall that our betting system uses trifecta boxes
instead of individual trifectas so we can make a smaller minimum bet. See
Table 9.2 for our ranking of the merits of various trifecta boxes.
If you see other people at the fronton with a copy of this book, it prob-
ably pays to move a few notches down on the list of best values to avoid
sharing the pool with them if you win. If you don’t see other people with
my book, please recommend it to your neighbors, because it means I really
could use the advertising.
Bets with ratios signiﬁcantly below 1.0 are not worth your investment.
And please, please lay off that 5–8–7 trifecta. You can expect to lose at
least 99.7 cents of each dollar you bet. Tables 9.3–9.6 present the expected
values of all trifectas if you want to check how your license plate, social
security number or birthdate stack up.
Tables 9.7, 9.8, and 9.9 present expected values for the various win,
place, and show bets. Be aware that the pools for these bets are typically
very small; placing anything more than the minimum bet means that you

all legal gambling winnings are properly reported. In response to this
problem, the IRS withholds taxes from all sufﬁciently proﬁtable bets,
meaning those that pay off at greater than 300–to–1 odds or return a
total of at least $1000.
This withholding system represents a compromise between the
legal requirements of performing withholding and the difﬁculty in
providing a 1099 form for every single bet. A bettor who wins a signi-
ﬁcant amount of money on many little bets (like me) will not trigger
withholding, which might be deemed unfair, but I feel that the sys-
tem is quite reasonable.1 Bottom line – if you are religiously opposed
to paying taxes, avoid trifectas and other exotic bets that might rise
above this threshold. On the other hand, I am unaware of any reli-
gion that prohibits taxes but encourages pari-mutuel wagering, so give
Uncle Sam his due.
If you do win a sufﬁciently large payoff to be subject to withholding,
be sure to save all of your betting tickets, especially the losers. You can
deduct your gambling losses from your winnings. Of course, you must

have winnings to defray it; you can’t use losses at the fronton to reduce
your taxable income.
I Employ smart money management – Money management is consi-
dered to be a key to successful gambling as it is in any ﬁnancial venture.
If you are putting nontrivial amounts of money at risk, do so for sound
reasons, not hunches.
Rating the Players
Betting the players, instead of just post positions, can make for a more
proﬁtable and entertaining evening. The single best measure of player
skill is probably the in-the-money percentage. Any player or team that has
a 0.400 win–place–show average is a good player and quite possibly worth
an investment. Only 8 of the 48 players on Milford’s 1998 roster achieved
this level of performance.
I have prepared a pair of charts to make it easier for you to evaluate
the performance of a given player or team. First, I provide a scatter plot of
all the regular players (more than 400 games) at Milford in 1998 and 1999.
Each player is represented by his game-win and in-the-money averages.
These two ratios are typically provided in each night’s program. If not, they
can be easily computed by dividing their number of wins (or the number
of wins + places + shows) by the number of games played.
Using this plot, you can eyeball how your player or team stacks up to
other players. Suppose that Mediocre won 12.5% of his games and was in
the money 38% of the time. That performance puts him in the middle of
the cloud of players, suggesting that he is of average skill. Suppose that
Magniﬁco won 14% of his games and ﬁnished in the money 41% of the
time. This point is to the upper right of the cloud, showing that he is a very
successful pelotari.
I also provide contour lines to make it easier to compare the perfor-
mance of two players or teams. Which is better, Julio, who won 12% of his
games and ﬁnished in the money 40% of the time, or Iglacias, who won
18% of the time but didn’t place or show as much and so paid off only
34% of the time? Contour lines link performances our program thinks are
equivalent.
Thus, to identify the more successful player, ﬁnd which of the lines
the two players are closest to and pick the player with the higher line. For
example, Julio’s performance puts him on the fourth line from the top,

Using the Odds Board
If you are really on the ball, you might want to try to scan the odds board
for undervalued combinations. The odds on win, quiniela, and exacta bets
are typically updated every 90 seconds or so during the betting period. Be

HOW SHOULD YOU BET?
aware that these odds can change very rapidly as more money is bet. Odds
on place and show are not posted because the payoffs depend upon the
other winning entrants as well. However, frontons may post the place and
show pools telling you how much money is currently invested on each post
position. Pool sizes are also typically posted instead of odds for trifectas,
presumably because they are easier to read.
Making sense of an odds board means being able to convert the posted
numberstothepayoffyouwouldgetifyouwon.Postedoddsarepresented
as a ratio of your return to your investment. To be precise, odds of a −b
pay off at your investment times (a + b)/b. For example, odds of 1 −1 pay
you off at double your investment, for (1 + 1)/1 = 2. The greater the ratio
between a and b, the more your bet returns. Odds of 9–2 multiply your in-
vestment by 11/2 = 5.5 times. Less desirable is when a < b. The gambler’s
axiom that “all life is 6–5 against” implies that you will get paid back 11/6
times your wager on an even money proposition (such as a football game
against the spread) because 6–5 against is the same as conventional 5–6
odds. Finally, I provide a table of dollar payoffs for given investment–odds
pairs (Table 9.12).

All this data can easily get overwhelming; consequently, I recommend
that you initially limit your attention to two or three combinations you
have prescreened using other criteria. Then bet on the one that shows the
best current odds. The trick is to bet as late as possible while still getting to
the betting window in time. The art lies in gauging the length of the lines
and the speed of the clerks.
Let the buyer beware, and good luck!

PROJECTS TO PONDER
Mathematical modeling is a subject best appreciated by doing. The trick is
ﬁnding an interesting type of prediction to make or question to study, and
then identifying sufﬁcient data to build a reasonable model upon. Even
if you are not a computer programmer, spread-sheet programs such as
Microsoft Excel can provide an excellent environment in which to experi-
ment with mathematical models.
In this section, I pose several interesting questions to which the model-
ing techniques presented in this book may be applicable. To provide start-
ing points, I include links to existing studies and data sets on the WWW.
Web links are extremely perishable, so treat these only as an introduction.
Any good search engine like www.google.com should help you ﬁnd better
sources after a few minutes’ toil. Happy modeling!
Gambling
I Lottery numbers – How random are lottery numbers? Do certain num-
bers in certain states come up more often than would be expected
by chance? Can you predict which lotto combinations are typically
underbet, meaning that they minimize the likelihood that you must
share the pot with someone else if you win?. How large must pool size

grow in a given progressive lottery to yield a positive expected value
for each ticket bought?
Plenty of lottery records are available on the WWW if you look
hard enough. Log on to http://www.lottonet.com/ for several year’s
historical data from several state lotteries. Minnesota does a particu-
larly good job, making its historical numbers available at http://www.
lottery.state.mn.us.
I Horse racing – Many of the ideas employed in our jai alai system are
directly applicable to horse racing. How can you take a horse’s record
and compute a measure of how fast it will run on a particular track
in the given weather conditions? How will the other bettors price the
respective horses in a race? Is there a betting strategy that will offer you
positive returns?
The Daily Racing Form, available at http://racingform.com, has
the schedules and results for every track in the country. Schedules and
results from New York tracks, including Aqueduct and Belmont Park,
are available from http://www.nyra.com/.
I Blackjack – Write a Monte Carlo simulation of a card-counting strategy
in Blackjack. Thorp’s book is the granddaddy of all such schemes, but
dozens of other strategies are available in books or on the WWW. Which
one is best? For each strategy, what are the expected winnings per hand
as a function of the number of decks employed by the casino?
Developandsimulatecard-countingstrategiesforothercardgames
such as gin rummy or poker variations in which cards are publicly dis-

I Bidding strategies on Ebay – Ebay (www.ebay.com) is an Internet phe-
nomenon, a giant on-line auction house that lets just about anybody
auction just about anything (it draws the line at organs and other body
parts). Successful bidding requires considerable strategy. When do you
raise a bid, and by how much?
Ebay is an excellent resource to study auction strategies because
the bidding history is available, giving the name, bid amount, and time
for each bid on every completed auction. How often does making a
big presumptive bid knock everyone else out of the game? Does it pay
to be the ﬁrst one to make a bid? Are the rules different for expensive
and inexpensive items? How much variance in bids is there, among
different auctions, for exactly the same item?

Sports and Games
I Baseball – Can you deﬁne a single ranking function that accurately
assigns value to hitters, pitchers, or both on the basis of their statistics,
ranking them from best to worst? Can you predict, on the basis of
statistics, whether a player will be elected to the Hall of Fame? Can you
ﬁnd the best batting order for a given team or the ordering of its hitters
that maximizes the expected number of runs the team scores? How
does this total compare with the worst possible order?
Batting averages give many children their ﬁrst inkling of the power
of mathematics. Complete team-by-team baseball statistics can
be found at http://www.baseball-reference.com. Check http://www.
usatoday.com/sports/baseball/sbstats.htm for player statistics since
1992.
I Football – Can you write an improved Clyde-like program for predict-
ing the outcome of football games? What fraction of the games can
you pick correctly, and how do you do against the spread? Are college
football games easier or harder to predict than professional games?
Last season’s NFL statistics are available at http://www.sporting-
news.com/nﬂ/statistics/. The ofﬁcial NFL site is www.nﬂ.com. Com-
plete college football records are harder to ﬁnd, but http://www.
washingtonpost.com/ offers standings for all teams at all levels of play.
I Basketball – Being a game of individual player matchups and dis-
crete shot attempts, basketball lends itself to Monte Carlo simulation
in addition to Clyde-type prediction programs. Can you write a good
basketball simulation?
What about predicting the outcome of the NCAA college basketball
tournament, by assigning a probability of who wins each game based
on statistics and rerunning the entire tourney many times?
Last season’s NBA statistics are available at http://www.sporting-
news.com/nba/statistics/. The ofﬁcial NBA site is www.nba.com.
Complete college basketball records are available from http://www.
washingtonpost.com/.
I Board games – Many interesting board games are controlled by dice,
implying that an accurate knowledge of the probabilities of certain
events is essential for optimal play. Monte Carlo simulations can be
used to gain insight into these events.
Take Monopoly as an example. Which properties are worth the
most? This is a function of how often people land there as well as

what the rents and costs are. Such probabilities can easily be studied
by simulation. The results of one such study appear at http://www.

What about the simpler board game of Chutes and Ladders or the
card game War? What is the expected number of rolls or turns you will
be committed to when your 5-year old nephew demands just one more

People Prediction
I Election Prediction – Mathematical models abound in politics. And
the results matter – just ask Al Gore. Incorrect television projections
based on partial returns and exit polls may well have cost him the U.S.
presidential election in 2000.
Properly interpreting the results of a scientiﬁc poll involves serious
statistical analysis to remove polling biases. For example, telephone
polls will oversample retired and unemployed people because they are
more likely to be there to pick up the phone.
A famous model to predict the outcome of U.S. presidential elec-
tions was “As Maine goes, so goes the nation.” This became “As Maine
goes, so goes Vermont” after the 1936 election, when those two New
EnglandstatesaccountedforallofAlfLandon’s8electoralvotesagainst

I Distribution of ﬁrst names – First names fall in and out of fashion owing
to the strange combination of forces affecting popular culture. Steven
was the 10th most popular boy’s name in 1961, but we dropped to 47th
by 1999. Jacob was the 35th most popular boy’s name in the 1980s, but
was on top by 1999. Can you predict the 10 most popular boy’s and
girl’s ﬁrst names for next year using previous years statistics? Extensive
data on the popularity of yesteryear’s names are available from the So-
cial Security Administration WWW site, at http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/

families do not produce sufﬁcient numbers of male heirs. The Skiena
line in the United States, which started with my grandfather Sol Skiena
in 1911, has expanded to 19 as of this writing. But our ultimate survival
cannot be guaranteed.
What is the expected number of generations until a last name with
n people out of a population of m becomes extinct? How should the
number of distinct last names in a population decrease as a function
of time? Similar issues arise in biodiversity studies with respect to ani-
mal species. What explains the nonuniform popularity of certain last
names? Is it a phenomenon due largely to chance, or is it due to other
factors such as immigration?
The U.S. Census Bureau posts the frequencies of the 88,800 most
popularlastnames,accordingtothe1990census,athttp://www.census.
gov/genealogy/names/.Theseaccountforonly90.483%ofthepopula-
tion, and the Skienas are nowhere to be found. From this data, can you
estimate how many distinct last names there are in the United States?
Financial Modeling
I Stock market investing – Predicting the stock market is without ques-
tion the most ﬁnancially rewarding mathematical modeling oppor-
tunity. There is no shortage of people who have studied the question,
and plenty of people believe that stock prices are a random walk
and inherently unpredictable. But that shouldn’t stop you from
hunting for market inefﬁciencies by evaluating different investment
strategies.
Although there is a plethora of sites that will tell you today’s clos-
ing prices, it is surprisingly difﬁcult to ﬁnd good historical stock data
on the WWW in a format suitable for downloading. Long-term daily
price data on selected stocks are available from R & C Research at
www.grainmarketresearch.com. One year’s worth of historical stock
market data is available from http://biz.swcp.com/stocks/.
I Economic forecasting – There is much more to modeling the econ-
omy than stock prices. How are interest rates tied to the dollar against
foreign currencies? The U.S. Federal Reserve (http://www.federal-
reserve.gov/releases/) provides extensive historical economic data, in-
cluding well over 10 years of international exchange and interest
rates.

Scientiﬁc Forecasting
I Weather prediction – Predicting tomorrow’s weather today is one of the
most important and challenging problems in mathematical modeling.
Today’s weather prediction codes are extremely sophisticated, so don’t
expect to be able to beat the TV weatherman. But it is interesting and
healthy to see how well or badly simple predictors can do, just from
knowing what the weather was like for the past few days.
The National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) of the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/
has a variety of weather data sets and makes a good starting point.
Historical weather data is available from climates as disparate as
Los Angeles (http://www.losangelesalmanac.com/topics/Weather)
and Omaha (http://www.crh.noaa.gov/oax).
The Old Farmer’s Almanac boldly makes weather predictions a full
year in advance and puts them on-line at http://www.almanac.com/.
Compare their predictions with current and historical weather data to
see how well they do!
I Population demographics – What will the population of the world be
in 2050? An accurate answer depends largely upon predicting two dif-
ferent issues: human life expectancy and human fertility rates.
TheU.S.CensusBureaumaintainsaworldpopulationclockprojec-
tion service at http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/ipc/popclockw, which

points to on-line sources of demographic information. The details of
your model can have huge impacts on the size of your predicted popu-
lation. The Census Bureau and the United Nations differed by more
than 3 months as to the date when the human population ﬁrst crossed
the 6 billion mark. The two counts differed by roughly 18 million peo-
ple. Projecting such disparities forward for 50 years can lead to vastly
different conclusions.
