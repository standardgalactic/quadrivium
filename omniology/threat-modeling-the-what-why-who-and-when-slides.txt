Introduction
Where to Start
Reduce Risk


 Numerous benefits

 How to threat model

Module Objectives
 What Is Threat Modeling
 Why You Should Threat Model
 Who Should Threat Model
 When to Threat Model

Systematically listing all the potential ways                     
how one can attack an application
Threat Modeling

Systematic Approach
Looking at Attacks
What Is Threat Modeling

Probable Threat Scenarios
List of Threats
What Is Threat Modeling

Holistic Approach

Concepts vs. Definitions

Weakness
 Software defect, bug
 Example: Missing email validation

Vulnerability
 Weakness that can be exploited
 Example: Email address field can be 
abused to insert SQL statement

Target
Attack
Attack Vector
Threat Actor

Attack Surface
 Anything that can be
 obtained,
 used, or
 attacked
 by a threat actor

 Risk = Impact * Likelihood
Risk

“By failing to PREPARE,
you are preparing to FAIL”
Benjamin Franklin

Why Threat Modeling ?
Architectural Risk Analysis
Source Code Analysis
Vulnerability Scanning
Penetration Testing

Pro-active 
approach
Reasons to Use Threat Modeling
Efficient
Prioritize bugs
Better 
understanding

Collaborative, Repeatable Process

Who Should Threat Model
It depends on the organization

When to Perform Threat Modeling
 As early as possible
 Requirements phase
 Design phase

When to Perform Threat Modeling
 During each sprint
 Generate separate security stories
 Early on in the process

When to Perform Threat Modeling
Early in the development process

 Threat modeling is a process to find 
vulnerabilities early on
 Proactive approach, enhances 
application knowledge
 The ‘who and when’ should fit the 
organization
 Fit process into organization
