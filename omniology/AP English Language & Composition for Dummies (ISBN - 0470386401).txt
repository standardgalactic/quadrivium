AP English Language & Composition For Dummies 

Introduction
I
sn’t May fun? In May you smell the new spring flowers, cruise the mall for bathing suits,
and daydream about exactly where and how to show off your tan. Plus, every sixty sec-
onds you get to cross off another minute from the approximately 43,200 left until the last
day of school. Not that you’re counting. 
Because you’re reading this book, I’m assuming that May has one more bonus in store for
you. Sometime in the first or second week of the month, the AP English Language and
Composition exam will land on your head. It will sit there like one of those alien globs from a
bad sci-fi film, extracting cells from your brain for a little more than three hours and ruining
an otherwise fine week. It will force you to darken little ovals with a No. 2 pencil and scribble
brilliant words in a pink answer booklet. All in a stuffy room presided over by a proctor who
last smiled during George Washington’s presidency. As I said, isn’t May fun?
Okay, so May isn’t always fun. But it doesn’t have to be awful either. Now that you’ve
demonstrated your wisdom by consulting AP English Language & Composition For Dummies,
you’ve gone a long way towards making May, at least the test-filled hours of it, easier and
more successful. You’re on your own with bathing-suit shopping. 
About This Book
No one wants to head into an exam room cold, meeting a test that’s so unfamiliar it may as
well be from another planet. AP English Language & Composition For Dummies helps you
become best friends with the exam. Just so you’re clear: the College Board offers two English
tests — AP English Literature and Composition and AP English Language and Composition.
If you’re facing the English lit exam, feel free to boost my ego by purchasing AP English
Literature & Composition For Dummies (Wiley, 2008). The book you’re reading right now 
prepares you for the AP English Language and Composition course and test, which covers
writing on current events, personal experience, and culture. The exam also requires you to
demonstrate that you know how to construct and write a solid argument and that you can
deal with research material. (If you’re an English nerd, which I consider a plus, you can take
both AP English tests.)
In the short time it takes you to read AP English Language & Composition For Dummies, 
you’ll get an overview of the exam’s structure and content and find out how and when to sign
up, show up, and pay up. You’ll discover the best strategies for approaching each type of
question — both multiple choice and essay — and review the principles of writing tested 
on this AP. Because practice makes perfect, in AP English Language & Composition For
Dummies I also provide lots of sample questions, complete with answers, explanations, and
scoring guidelines. 
Before I go any further, I have a confession to make: I am not the College Board — the
company that creates and administers the AP, the SAT, the PSAT/NMSQT, and other lovely
alphabet-soup tortures (sorry, I meant to say exams) that you face in the last two years of
high school. Even though I’m a person, not a board, I’ve been teaching English since the
inkwell era (okay, not exactly that long, but close). I know what you need to ace the test, and

I’ve packed this book with every relevant fact, helpful hint, and tricky maneuver I’ve accumu-
lated in my thirty-plus years of teaching English. The questions in this book are my own, but
they’re in authentic AP style, and they’ll prepare you for the real AP English Language and
Composition exam.
This book also clues you in to the best — and most efficient — tactics for improving your
grades, whether you’re taking an AP English class or not. Most people taking an AP exam
spend a year in an AP English Language course, which is a college-level English writing
course for people who haven’t yet encountered any ivy-covered walls. However, you can take
the AP English Language and Composition exam even if your class doesn’t carry the official
AP designation. AP English Language & Composition For Dummies helps you write better
essays, boost your reading comprehension, beef up your vocabulary, and streamline your
study techniques. Need I point out that these skills give you an edge in all your courses,
including the most important one on your schedule — English. (Sorry. I can’t help myself;
I’m an English teacher.)
Conventions Used in This Book
No, I’m not talking about the kind of convention that features panels of experts blathering on
about such weighty topics as toe-ring marketing or French yogurt cultures. I’m talking about
standardized elements of style, which identify important points in AP English Language &
Composition For Dummies. Here’s what to look for:
 All Web sites appear in monofont, which looks like this: www.collegeboard.com.
 Crucial points and the significant portions of numbered steps or processes appear
in bold.
 Italics call attention to a book title or to a specialized, English-teacher term that you have
to know for the AP English Language and Composition exam. I define every italicized
term immediately. If you pay attention as you read, you can increase your technical
vocabulary without breaking into hives, which is what most people do when they try to
memorize vocabulary from a list. Learning terms as you read is a lot less irritating and a
lot more efficient. The terminology on the AP English Language and Composition exam
consists mainly of words that describe writing style, a task you have to tackle in both the
multiple-choice and essay portions of the exam. 
What You’re Not to Read
Yes, I know. You’re captain of the Air Guitar Team, president of the Dog Fur Appreciation Club,
and Editor-in-Chief of the Get-Into-College Bulletin. You’re also taking 19 major courses and a
few dozen minors. Plus you occasionally indulge in eating, sleeping, or texting a friend. I get it:
You don’t have time for everything you’d like to do. So even though I sweated over every
single word in this book, I understand that you may skip something. Here’s what to drop: 
 Stuff you already know. In this book I cover everything that’s on the test, but you prob-
ably don’t need it all. If you’re a born lawyer and can construct a solid argument in
your sleep, skip the sections that deal with argument essays. If you swallowed a dic-
tionary when you were two, don’t waste any time on sections explaining how to
increase your vocabulary. 
 Explanations of correct multiple-choice answers. Each practice exam is followed by a
chapter of answers and explanations. If you nailed a multiple-choice question — and
didn’t guess! — don’t bother reading the explanation accompanying the answer. Just be
sure to read the explanations for any questions that puzzled you.

 Statistical information about the test. As a no-life trivia buff, I collect facts the way my
black sweater collects lint. And of course, in typical teacher-style I can’t resist sharing
what I’ve learned. So here and there I tell you something about the AP program. You
don’t need to know anything about the AP except how to ace the test. Don’t waste any
brain cells on random test information.
Foolish Assumptions
I don’t walk around waving my resume, but occasionally the fact that I write For Dummies
books comes up in conversation. Most people immediately list their favorite titles and
explain how these books helped them sell a house, learn to quilt, or pass geometry. But once
in a great while I get a look from someone unfamiliar with the series and a comment like “You
think your readers are dummies? How dare you!” I’m here to tell you that the opposite is
true. I know my readers aren’t dummies. In fact, they’re smarties, because they want informa-
tion that’s useful and complete, and they don’t mind an occasional smile while they’re read-
ing. Here are the other assumptions I made about you, the reader: 
 You plan to take the AP English Language and Composition exam within a year, and you
want to ace the test. 
 You have no time for repetitive or convoluted explanations.
 You’ve done some nonfiction writing in English class (and maybe outside of class, too).
 You don’t have a nervous breakdown when faced with a difficult reading passage,
but you could use some shortcuts and tricks to increase your comprehension.
 You know a fair amount of English grammar. If grammar and you go together as well
as sardines and peanut butter, take a look at another of my For Dummies books —
either English Grammar For Dummies (Wiley, 2001) or English Grammar Workbook For
Dummies (Wiley, 2007). The first reviews the essentials of grammar, concentrating on
the stuff you actually use when you sit down to write. The second gives you a chance
to practice proper English.
How This Book Is Organized
First up in AP English Language & Composition For Dummies is a flyover of the exam so that
you know what you’re taking, how much time you have, how to sign up, where your scores
go, and how thin your wallet will be when you’re finished. Next is a countdown — not to lift-
off but to Test Day — that gives you a timetable for exam prep. After a review of the content
you’re expected to know for the test, I provide the best strategy for each type of multiple-
choice and essay question, along with sample questions. Finally, I offer two whole AP tests,
complete with answers, explanations, and scoring guides so you can gauge how you’re doing.
Now for the specifics.
Part I: Preparation without Perspiration
You may have significant questions (What kind of essay should I write?) or everyday queries
(Can I use green ink?). Consider this part your personal answer key. Everything you ever
wanted to know about the AP English Language and Composition exam is in Part I. So is a pre-
test plan: what to do to ensure the highest possible score if you’re starting a year, a couple of
months, or even a couple of hours before the test. Because your regular course performance
matters also, this part also includes the best-kept English teachers’ secrets for good grades.

Introduction

Part II: The Writer’s Toolkit
When the super of my building stops by to fix something, he carries an impressive box filled
with all sorts of mysterious tools such as lug-wrenches, snakes, and something called a T-
nut. I’ve always wanted to go to work with a toolkit also, and in some sense, I do. I have a
writer’s toolkit at my disposal, containing syntax, diction, concession-and-reply, and a ton of
other nifty elements of writing that you need for both the multiple-choice and essay portions
of the exam. In this part I unpack the toolkit, explaining how to identify and utilize every writ-
ing technique in it. This part also includes a grammar review. (I promise not to bore you to
death with terminology. I just cover the practical stuff.) Also, because one of the essays in
the free-response section includes a visual source, Part II contains a chapter on decoding and
writing about graphs, charts, and cartoons. 
Part III: Meeting the Major Players: 
Types of Writing on the AP Exam
The AP English Language and Composition exam focuses on nonfiction, though a slice of fic-
tion that resembles nonfiction occasionally shows up. In Part III, I acquaint you with nonfic-
tion in all its glorious variety, showing you how to decode everything from essays to letters
to memoirs. I even throw in some speeches, which play a starring role every couple of years.
Part III also reviews citation format, the subject of a few multiple-choice questions and a
requirement for one of the essays.
Part IV: That Is the Question: Multiple-Choice
and Essay Strategies and Practice
Hamlet famously asked, “To be, or not to be?” If only AP questions were so direct! Sadly, AP
English Language exam questions, especially the multiple-choice variety, sometimes appear
to come straight from Planet Weird. Never fear: In Part IV I explain how to figure out what
they’re asking in the multiple-choice section and give you the best strategy for finding the
right answer. I also explain how to decode an essay prompt, a fancy name for an essay ques-
tion, and give you a step-by-step guide to producing a great piece of writing. And because
practice makes . . . okay, maybe not perfect but certainly close, I provide a ton of examples
complete with answers and explanations.
Part V: Testing, One, Two . . . Practice Exams
Before you kill three completely innocent hours on AP English Language Test Day, you
should take a full exam under realistic exam conditions. In this part you find two (enough for
six-plus hours of fun!). Each exam is accompanied by a chapter of answers, explanations, and
scoring guides.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Ten is a magic number. Your fingers and toes chose to appear in sets of ten, as did our
number system. This part is magic also. Here you learn ten ways to murder your essay score
so you can avoid lethal pitfalls. You also pick up ten (relatively) painless ways to improve
your writing.

Icons Used in This Book
These cute little drawings are my favorite aspect of For Dummies books (apart from my 
royalty statements). In AP English Language and Composition For Dummies you find four, each
of which functions like a road sign so that you can avoid traffic pileups and speed to your
destination — a great score on the AP exam.
This icon is a whisper in your ear from an expert. The accompanying text points out the easi-
est path to success.
If you see this icon, a patch of quicksand looms. No problem for you, though. Just follow the
suggestions here and you won’t sink.
On AP Test Day you face real questions, just like the ones identified with this icon.
If you take away only one idea from a section in this book, make it the one identified by this
icon. It shows you the most crucial elements, the information you want at your fingertips. 
Where to Go from Here
If you’ve plowed through this entire introduction, run around the block a couple of times or
stop at a coffee shop. You need exercise or a caffeine-fix to wake yourself up! Just kidding.
Actually, your next step should be an internal audit: 
 Consider how much you know about the format and logistics of the exam. Any
fuzziness? Turn to Part I. 
 Think about your writing and reading skills. Then check out the chapters that match
your weak spots. (Not that you actually have any. I should have said “less strong spots.”) 
 Spend a moment checking your standardized-test savvy. If you’re great at essays but
confounded by multiple-choice questions, turn to Chapter 14. If the opposite is true,
Chapter 16 is your destination. 
 Unsure about the best route? Try one of the practice exams (Chapter 18 or 20) and
score it (Chapter 19 or 21). Figure out where you need to improve, and turn to the cor-
responding section of the book for a review or additional practice. 
And cheer up. No matter what, June — and summer vacation — eventually arrives.

Part I
Preparation without
Perspiration

In this part . . . 
Yes, the AP English Language and Composition exam is
coming. And no, it’s not a good idea to drop out of
school on the off-chance that American Idol will launch
your career as a pop singer just in time to make APs irrele-
vant. Given that you’re stuck with this test, you may as
well hit it with everything you’ve got. This part helps you
prepare for the exam without breaking into a sweat. (Okay,
maybe some minor perspiration, but only a few drops.)
Chapter 1 is a reconnaissance mission that allows you to
scope out the exam. Chapter 2 lays out a study plan for
those who think ahead (up to a year in advance) and for
those who think “ahead” means the five whole minutes
before it’s time to leave for the exam. Chapter 3 explains
how to ace an AP English class or any other English course.
Let the games begin!

Chapter 1
Scoping Out the Exam: An Overview
In This Chapter
 Previewing the format and content of the exam
 Examining how the test is scored
 Taking a close look at the logistics of AP exams
P
eople who favor traditional education usually want schools to focus on “the three Rs” —
reading, ’riting, and ’rithmetic. (Spelling is apparently not included in this worldview.)
Traditionalists, therefore, love the AP English Language and Composition exam because it
covers two-thirds of these basic areas: reading and ’riting . . .er, I mean writing. This exam, 
as well as the course that may be attached to it, concentrates on your skills as a writer
and as a reader of other people’s writing. 
In this chapter I help you scope out the exam. I show you typical AP English Language and
Composition questions and tell you everything you need to know about scoring, timing, and
guessing. I also cover all the practical stuff in this chapter: how to find out when and where
the test is held, what it costs, how scores are reported, and so forth. 
What to Expect When You’re Expecting
to Take the AP English Language and
Composition Exam
By this point in your academic career, I bet you’ve taken an awful lot of tests, some of
which were, in fact, awful. The AP English Language and Composition exam is probably
easier than many of the tests you’ve already suffered through, despite the fact that it’s a little
scary looking. It comes in a plastic, shrink-wrapped package with multicolored booklets and
instructions that sound as if they were written by a prosecutor just itching to throw you into
jail. Relax. It all boils down to two parts:
 Multiple Choice: You have one hour to answer approximately 55 questions (the
number varies a bit from year to year) based on five or six reading passages. Each
question is followed by five possible answers lettered A – E. You bubble your answers
with a number two pencil onto an answer sheet.
 Free Response: This section throws three writing assignments at you, all essays, tucked
into a little green booklet. You get a 15-minute reading period during which you can
check out all the questions, read the passages supplied, and take notes in the question
booklet. Then they let you open the pink answer booklet and write for two hours —
approximately 40 minutes per essay.

As you see, the test itself gobbles up 3:15 hours of your life. As you plan for test day, add a
10-minute break between the multiple-choice and free-response sections and about 45 min-
utes for getting settled and bubbling registration information on the answer sheet — a little
less if your school holds preregistration sessions and a little more if your proctor is the say-
one-word-a-minute type. (More about registration and the logistics of test day appears in
“Getting Practical” later in this chapter.) 
The exam doesn’t sound too bad, right? Okay, maybe it does sound bad. But the AP English
Language and Composition test is manageable, especially if you prepare yourself — as you’re
doing right now — with this book. 
Getting Up Close and Personal 
with Exam Questions
Why is the sky blue? Can I borrow the car tonight? Will high school ever end? These ques-
tions are crucial, but you won’t find them on the AP English Language and Composition
exam. Instead you encounter questions about what a writing passage says and how the pas-
sage says it. You also get a chance to argue (though not about the car-borrowing issue), ana-
lyze, and synthesize. This section zooms in for a closer look. First up is content — what sort
of reading passages you’ll meet. Next is format — a roll call of the type of multiple-choice and
essay questions facing you.
Previewing AP passages
Appearing on an AP exam is the literary-world equivalent of opening on Broadway. The test-
makers aim to include a good selection of quality literature in every test — the sort of reading
assigned in college courses. The vast majority of passages are nonfiction selections from
essays, speeches, letters, biographies or memoirs, and exposition (explanation) or description
10
Part I: Preparation without Perspiration 
Hitting a moving target
Many high school English teachers (including me) see
the AP English Language and Composition exam as a
moving target. The test has changed several times in the
last few years, and it may morph again (and again!) in
the future. Why hop around so much? One theory is that
they’re drinking way too many double-espressos in the
College Board offices. A more likely explanation is that
the AP test writers are responding to what today’s col-
lege teachers want to see in a well-prepared student
writer. The AP English Language and Composition
course is roughly the equivalent of “Freshman Comp” or
“Composition 101,” and the exam is designed to show
whether you’ve learned enough to get credit in that col-
lege class. More than in the past, such courses now
stress use of sources and argument. So it’s not surpris-
ing that in 2007 the College Board added a synthesis
essay (see “Drafting AP Essays” later in this chapter for
more information) to determine whether students can
handle research material. 
Others changes in the test are detectable only if you
read a few decades’ worth of AP questions. (This task is
about as much fun as a visit to the dentist. Believe me,
I’ve done both and I know). An extended survey reveals,
for example, that paired-passage essays haven’t shown
up for a while. They may be gone for good, or, as some
AP teachers believe, they’re due for a comeback.
Passages drawn from the Web are on the upswing, and
specialized vocabulary to describe writing style seems
to be increasingly important. Not to worry: in this book I
cover all the bases, so you’ll be ready no matter what
shows up on test day.

from a variety of sources. Though the AP English Language and Composition test is officially
the province of the English Department, subjects range from history to arts to politics to sci-
ence to just about anything you can imagine. The test makers occasionally dip into fiction—
usually a descriptive or a narrative passage. Once in a great while a speech from a play
appears. The AP doesn’t have a required reading list, so you won’t see any questions that
assume you’ve read a particular book. In fact, everything you need — except good writing and
reading skills — is given to you by the test makers. 
If rhymes make you break out in hives, you can rejoice in the fact that poetry never shows up
on the exam, unless it’s in the mouth of a Shakespearean character, in which case you may
want to convince yourself that you’re reading drama, not poetry. 
In every exam, the AP test makers include something old and something new. Everything is
“borrowed” from other writers, and nothing is printed in blue. (Sorry, I got carried away with
the wedding reference.) You will probably see a seventeenth- or eighteenth- century passage,
a little from the ninteenth century, and some modern works from the twentieth or twenty-
first century. Striving for diversity, the AP makers generally test you on a couple of passages
written by women or people of color. Works from any English-speaking country, as well as an
occasional translation, are fair game. At least one passage has source citations (footnotes,
parenthetical references, or a bibliography).
The AP test doesn’t always include identifying information about a particular passage (the
title, author, or date and circumstances of publication). If you see such information, pay
attention. You may learn something that will help you answer the questions.
Every AP exam presents you with a range of reading difficulty, from “not so bad” to “what in
the world does this mean?” Luckily for you, the hardest passages tend to be accompanied by
relatively easy questions. Sadly, the reverse is also true. Selections that are simpler to
decode are attached to tougher multiple-choice or essay questions. 
Don’t assume that a passage with simple vocabulary or syntax (grammatical structure) is a
piece of cake. Such passages may have subtle points, a nuanced tone, or a complex attitude.
Don’t speed too quickly through an “easy” passage.
Life from A to E: The multiple-choice section
You’ve probably sat down a million times in your English classes to read a piece of great writ-
ing and discuss its style and content with your classmates. In my ideal world, the AP English
Language and Composition test would allow AP graders to eavesdrop on that sort of discus-
sion, evaluating your interpretations and observations. Unfortunately, AP Testland is not my
ideal world. Instead of discussion, the test makers have poured tons of possible comments
about a passage into ovals labeled A, B, C, D, and E. Your mission — and you must choose to
accept it or see your AP grade fizzle like one of those tapes in Mission Impossible — is to find
the oval that matches what you think is the right answer. 
Some of the multiple-choice questions evaluate standard reading-comprehension skills such as
vocabulary, inference, decoding the text, and so forth. About half the questions you encounter
on the AP English Language and Composition test concern writing style: how the words are put
together on the page and why the author made particular style choices. You may be queried
about the passage as a whole or about only one or two words. Because content and style are
closely related in good literature, style questions sometimes overlap with content questions.
No matter. You don’t have to label the questions, just answer them correctly.
Time to sample the merchandise. Here’s an array of typical AP multiple-choice questions.
11
Chapter 1: Scoping Out the Exam: An Overview

Vocabulary-in-context questions
A number of AP questions test whether you understand the meaning of a particular word or
phrase in the context of the passage. Check out this example.
In line 12, “drip” may best be defined as
(A) a guy with a plastic pocket protector
(B) a type of coffeemaker
(C) the sound that keeps you up until 3 a.m. every night
(D) what spaghetti sauce does on your favorite shirt
(E) the normal state of an infant’s mouth
I don’t know what the answer is, though in my house (D) is always a good bet. To answer this
type of question, you have to go back to line 12. If a biographer is explaining why Supermodel
Sue rejected a once-in-a-lifetime chance to attend a flea circus, (A) is probably the answer. If
someone’s preparing dinner, go for (B).
One annoying aspect of “vocabulary-in-context” questions is that most of the choices are
actual definitions of the word they’re asking you to define. Don’t jump on an answer too
quickly. Be sure the definition fits the way the word is used in the passage.
Specialized vocabulary questions
Like every other subject area, English has its own specialized vocabulary that describes ele-
ments of writing. These terms may appear in either the question or the answer choices. Take
a peek at this example.
Which technique does the author employ in lines 18–23?
(A) figurative language
(B) apostrophe
(C) synecdoche
(D) allusion
(E) parallel structure
For specialized vocabulary questions, the answer is outlined in neon lights if you know the
terms. If you don’t, you’re flying blind. (Eyesight trouble? Don’t panic. I review these terms in
Chapters 4 through 6.)
Antecedent questions
Another type of question lurking on the AP exam involves pronouns, those pesky little words
that replace nouns. Usually you have to explain what a pronoun means by finding the word it
refers to — its antecedent.
The antecedent of “that” (line 54) is
(A) Massachusetts (line 2)
(B) nude sunbathing (line 48)
(C) toe jam (line 49)
(D) hippo (line 50)
(E) algae (line 57)
12
Part I: Preparation without Perspiration 

Finding an antecedent is fairly easy. Just substitute each answer for the pronoun and see
which one makes sense. 
Factual questions
You may occasionally be asked to identify a stated fact. This type of question is frequently
attached to old (pre-nineteenth century) passages. The AP test makers want to know that
you can decode works from earlier centuries. Take a look at the following example.
What is Mortimer’s reason for leaving his dead lover?
(A) It was time to take ye olde AP exam.
(B) He had to bury the murder weapon.
(C) His “buy one, get one free” coupon was about to expire.
(D) His curfew was 9 p.m.
(E) He had jury duty.
The good news about stated-fact questions is that the answer is actually in the passage. The
bad news is that you probably have to burrow through a mound of antiquated language to
find the answer.
A variation of the factual question looks for equivalents, as in this example.
Which statement is the equivalent of line 42 (“And she was never seen again”)?
(A) “Nevermore would anyone stare at her pimple” (line 80)
(B) “She had been poetry-in-motion, but now she was history” (line 82)
(C) “The 5:42 was a one-way trip” (line 88)
(D) “Mars afforded permanent escape” (line 99)
(E) “Everyone she knew disdained the special eclipse-proof glasses” (line 111)
To answer one of these beauties, step back and examine the big picture. What point is the
author making about the fact that “she was never seen again”? If the passage is about a train
wreck, (C) is a good bet. If you’ve been reading about space travel, opt for (D).
Inference questions
Inference resides in “read between the lines” territory. These questions make you put on
your Sherlock Holmes hat and find the clues pointing to the answer, which is not directly
stated in the passage. Check out this example.
Eleanor probably refused to wear the pink dress because
(A) it clashed with her orange nose ring.
(B) she had worn pink on her last date with Mortimer.
(C) pink was “so-o-o last year.”
(D) the pink dress was evidence in the bank robbery.
(E) no dress was good enough for Eleanor.
The preceding example resembles a straightforward factual question, but the word “probably”
tells you that you have to draw a conclusion. Spread your net wide and gather relevant infor-
mation. If Eleanor turned up her nose at an Armani outfit, (E) is the answer you seek. If the
passage rambles on about complementary colors, (A) may win.
13
Chapter 1: Scoping Out the Exam: An Overview

Main idea questions
Main idea questions make you hold an umbrella over the content of the entire passage or of a
portion of the passage. Like an umbrella, your answer should be wide enough to cover every-
thing but not so huge as to put someone’s eye out. Here’s an example.
What is the main idea of paragraph three (lines 69–92)?
(A) Children riding bicycles should be encased in bubble wrap.
(B) Bicycle riding is dangerous.
(C) Accidents claim many lives every year.
(D) Lola should never have opened the car door without looking both ways.
(E) Lola should be banned from public highways.
A question like this sends you back to paragraph three. Does everything in the paragraph fit
the answer you chose? If not, your answer is too narrow. Look for the most specific answer
that includes everything in the designated lines.
Purpose
You also have to read between the lines for questions about the author’s purpose, as in this
example.
The narrator relates the story of Adam’s apple injury (lines 14–18) in order to
(A) prove to the reader that Adam was fatally careless
(B) qualify his statement that “Adam was a lucky guy” (line 4)
(C) reveal the reason for Adam’s fear of red, fruit-shaped objects
(D) contrast Adam’s carelessness with Olivia’s timidity
(E) persuade the reader that thrown fruit can be deadly
The preceding example is best answered by imagining the passage without the story of Adam
and the apple. What changes? For example, suppose Olivia seems bolder when she’s not
compared with Adam. Okay, Adam’s there to reveal Olivia’s character.
Tone and attitude questions
Still more “big picture” questions tackle tone and attitude — of a person or character in the
passage or of the author. Look at this example.
The attitude of the author toward global warming may best be characterized as
(A) detached
(B) critical
(C) dismissive
(D) alarmed
(E) distraught
This type of question is easy as long as you read carefully. If the author says that the planet
simply needs more air conditioners to combat global warming, darken oval (C). If the author
explains how he “howled at the moon” and “imagined the earth melting into the sky,” go
for (E). 
14
Part I: Preparation without Perspiration 

The same strategy often works nicely for questions about tone, which is the author’s or
character’s “voice” on the page. To determine tone, pay close attention to individual word
choices and to what is included or left out of the passage. Imagine that the preceding exam-
ple queries you about “tone” instead of “attitude,” with the same answer choices. If the pas-
sage refers to “environmental catastrophe,” the author’s tone is definitely not “dismissive,”
choice (C), or “detached,” choice (D). Other words in the passage may help you decide
which of the remaining answers works best. 
Tone and attitude questions often come with paired answers (“detached and thoughtful,” for
example.) Be sure both adjectives work when choosing an answer.
Structure questions
How is the passage organized? By time, order of importance, or something else? Structure
questions ask you to perceive the skeleton of logic that holds the passage or a paragraph
together, as in this example.
Which word or phrase best describes paragraph three (lines 44–56)?
(A) comparison and contrast
(B) chronological order
(C) spatial order
(D) claim and evidence
(E) cause and effect
Fire up your X-ray vision when you answer a structure question. Ignore the details and check
out the order in which things appear in the paragraph or passage. Determining what’s where
points you toward the correct answer.
Citation questions
Adding to the true joy of 3:15 hours of AP test-taking are questions about source citations —
footnotes, parenthetical, or bibliographic citations. Rest assured: you won’t find any ques-
tions about whether a comma has been correctly placed. You will be asked to explain what a
citation means, as illustrated in the following example.
Which of the following statements about footnote 2 is correct?
(A) Paris Hilton is the author of the article entitled “Dogs I Have Owned.”
(B) The article was published in a suite at the Hilton in Paris, France.
(C) The information about Paris was provided by the Hilton Hotel chain.
(D) The information about Paris was provided by a small dog.
(E) The article was published in 1802 and revised in 2002.
Citations are a world unto themselves, but you can navigate them with the help of Chapter 14.
Drafting AP essays
After an hour of untangling multiple-choice answers, you get a measly 10-minute rest before
hitting the essay section (which, by the way, has been known to hit back). First you read for
15 minutes, jotting notes in the margin of your question booklet. Then you start writing. The
questions vary from year to year, but a few are constant. 
15
Chapter 1: Scoping Out the Exam: An Overview

Synthesis 
Making its debut in 2007, the synthesis essay requires you to read and digest six or seven
sources about a particular issue. The sources are usually short or excerpted news stories,
editorials, letters, or Web postings. At least one of the sources is visual — a chart, graph,
cartoon, or photo. You take a stand on the issue and support your position with references
to at least three of the sources. Here’s an example.
The usefulness of the $100,000 dollar bill has been questioned by government officials, but
many consumers find this type of currency essential. Read the following sources carefully.
Then write an essay in which you develop a position on the desirability of the $100,000 bill
in the United States currency system. Synthesize at least three of the six sources to support
your stance. In your essay, attribute both direct and indirect citations.
This may seem like a ridiculous question, but a recent AP synthesis essay questioned the
usefulness of the penny. One of the sources — I kid you not! — was a photo of a penny. For
help with the synthesis essay, turn to Chapters 16 and 17.
Style analysis
This one usually shows up solo (one passage) but occasionally with a partner (paired pas-
sages). You have to read the selection(s) and explain how the writing technique relates to
another element. For example, they may ask you to explain how the author’s attitude or pur-
pose is revealed by her rhetorical strategy (a fancy word for writing style). If you’re dealing
with twins, you have to compare techniques. Check out this question.
Read this excerpt from Pablo Picasso’s My Art and Peanut Butter: A Memoir. Then, in a well-
written essay, discuss how the author’s attitude toward chunky nut-spreads is revealed by
the rhetorical devices he employs. 
The big deal here is that you have to analyze and discuss the effect of the techniques you
identify in the passage, not simply list them. For a review of rhetorical devices, turn to Part II.
Argument
If you’re a debater, this question’s for you. The AP makers may throw a letter to the editor or
an editorial at you, or they may simply provide a provocative quotation. You have to agree or
disagree with the position stated in the passage or quotation. You may also adopt a stance
that partly agrees, with some objections. Here’s a sample question.
Bernice Woodchick once noted that “no man is an island, but quite a few are peninsulas
because they’re just too shy to date.” Ms. Woodchick’s observation has often been cited in
support of computerized dating services. In a well-written essay, develop a position on the
efficacy of computer matchmaking. Support your position with evidence from literature,
history, or personal experience.
The crucial element of this essay is support. The graders don’t care what you think, but
they do care about how you think. They want to know that you can construct a convincing
argument. 
Knowing the Score: Grades and Reports
Psychometrician. Sounds like a crazy person obsessed with tape measures and rulers, right?
But in AP World, a psychometrician is someone who checks the questions on every exam,
looking for just the right weighting to produce reliable, standardized results that sort stu-
dents the same way no matter which year they take the test. Too many easy questions, and
16
Part I: Preparation without Perspiration 

the psychometrician toughens the formula so that more correct answers are needed for a
good grade. Too many hard questions, and the exam is curved downward. Either way, the
psychometricians aim to ensure that every AP score means more or less the same thing. 
The score you see ranges from 1 to 5, with 5 cause for celebration and 1 for consolation. The
scores break down this way:
5: Extremely well qualified (equals an A in Freshman Comp)
4: Well qualified (in the B range for Freshman Comp)
3: Qualified (C territory)
2: Possibly qualified (D, if the teacher’s in a good mood)
1: No recommendation (and also no passing grade)
What do these scores mean to colleges? If they see a 3, 4, or 5, most will be happy. A bunch
of hard-to-get-into colleges turn up their noses at anything lower than a 4. A score of 1 or 2
won’t help you much, either with college admission or with placement.
Some colleges give you actual credit (usually two or three credits) for a good AP grade. This
practice saves you actual money, as you then have to take fewer courses to graduate. Some
colleges don’t give you credit (they want the actual money), but they exempt you from the
Freshman Comp requirement. Some just smile and give you nothing tangible, though a good
AP score always helps your chances for admission.
Multiple-choice scoring
The multiple-choice section counts for 45 percent of your total score. The good news is that
you can get a bunch of multiple-choice questions wrong and still pass. For example, if you
miss as many as a third of the multiple-choice questions and score 6 out of 9 on the essay
section, you’re in the running for a 3. (See the preceding section for an explanation of the
significance of AP scores and the next section to interpret the meaning of the essay scores.) 
Multiple-choice questions are scored in this way:
 Every correct answer receives one point.
 Each question you leave blank receives no points.
 A wrong answer deducts 1⁄4 point from your multiple-choice total.
 Totals are plugged into a math formula that spits out the “converted score.” (Don’t ask.
No one but the College Board needs to know what a converted score is.)
All you math geniuses out there have already figured out that random guessing is a bad idea,
because you lose more for a wrong answer than a blank. However, if you can eliminate two of
the five choices, you may as well take a stab at the question because the odds favor you.
Essay scoring
The essay section comprises 55 percent of your total score. Each of the three essays counts
the same, and a blank answer lops a third from your essay grade. The moral of the story:
don’t spend 90 minutes on one essay, 30 minutes on another, and 0 minutes on the remaining
question. Divide your two hours more or less evenly — about 40 minutes per essay.
17
Chapter 1: Scoping Out the Exam: An Overview

The essays are read by college English professors and high-school English teachers who
reside in a hotel for a week drinking record-breaking amounts of caffeinated beverages. A
group of teachers at one table reads the responses to a single question. In other words, one
table is stuck with hundreds of synthesis essays, another table with stacks of the analysis
essay, and so on. A table leader — a sort of Super Grader — reads and checks the work of
anyone new to the process, and psychometricians (people who understand statistics) check
that the essay grade is more or less in sync with the multiple-choice grade. If the scores on
the two portions of the exam seem mismatched, the essay is rechecked by a table leader. 
Each essay receives a score between 0 and 9, awarded to the essay as a whole. Graders don’t
write comments on the paper, and they don’t deduct 10 percent for bad grammar or give you
30 percent for an excellent introduction. Nines are extremely rare. One grader told me that
she read 1,200 essays one year and came up with only 13 nines. Here’s a general guide to
essay scores:
0: The question was not answered.
1, 2, or 3: The essay is overly simple and poorly written or reflects a misreading of the
passage or assigned task. An essay in this category tends to repeat or summarize infor-
mation from the passage or make unsupported arguments. Two is the highest score an
essay can receive if the grammar and spelling are bad enough to impede the reader.
4, 5, or 6: Now things are looking up. Essays in this slot do the job; they synthesize, ana-
lyze, or argue reasonably well, and they include a fair amount of supportive evidence.
They are written with some, but not many, grammar and spelling errors, and the writing
style is adequate. However, they’re not as sophisticated as essays on the next rung. 
7, 8, or 9: Be still my beating heart! These essays show that students have been learning
what we English teachers have been teaching. They get the job done smoothly, effi-
ciently, and properly. The content and style would rate a good grade if written in a
timed, in-class situation in a college course.
After the graders have plopped a number on your essay, the numbers make their way to still
another formula, where the three essay scores are combined and converted and mixed into
one last formula, whereupon a 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 pops out.
Reporting the scores
About two months after the test, you receive an envelope in the mail with your AP score
inside. Or, if you pay extra (currently $8), you can get an early report by phone. The toll-free
number is 888-308-0013 for the United States and Canada. Outside this area, the number is
609-771-7300. Your English teacher also gets a report sometime during the summer. If you
asked that your score be reported to a college, the college also hears the news in July. The
first college report is free; if you want additional score reports, you have to fork over $15
(or $25 if you’re in a rush) for each extra college. 
To access grades by phone or to request extra score reports, you need a valid credit card
and your Student Pack. (See “Getting Practical” in this chapter for more information on
Student Packs.) 
A few more details on score reports:
 All the APs you ever took in your entire life show up on the same score report, not just
the most recent one, unless you cancelled a score or paid to have it withheld. 
18
Part I: Preparation without Perspiration 

 You can cancel a score until mid-June — an option you may want to take advantage of
if you lost your way, your memory, or your mind on the day of the exam. To cancel a
score, speak with your teacher or your school’s AP Coordinator or log on to www.
collegeboard.com. If you cancel a score, it vanishes forever. No one, including you, will
ever know how you did. Don’t expect a refund. You’re cancelling the result, not the test.
 You can withhold a score from a college, though you must pay $10 per college and
make a written request to the College Board by mid-June. The score will still be
reported to you and to your high school, and if you change your mind, you can release
the score to colleges at a later date, after paying a few more bucks.
 For a fee of $7, the College Board will send you the essays you wrote. You’ll see the
score written on the essay, but no comments or corrections. If you plan to take the AP
exam twice (and if so, you’ll have to wait a whole year as the exam is given only in
May), reviewing your essays with a teacher or tutor is a good idea.
Take a look at the College Board Web site (www.collegeboard.com) or call 888-225-5427 for
anything to do with score reporting, cancellations, and the like.
Getting Practical
No matter how prepared you are for the exam, you can’t do well — in fact you can’t do
anything — unless you take the test. If you’re enrolled in an AP English Comp course, your
teacher will probably tell you how to sign up and when and where the exam is given. If you
are home schooled or if the school you attend doesn’t offer an AP program, you can still take
the exam. Call 888-225-5427 for the contact information of the nearest AP Coordinator.
(The coordinator is the person in charge of ordering the tests, scheduling proctors, and
so forth.) You will receive a special code number from the coordinator, and you’ll have to
bring this number and a government-issued photo ID (such as a passport or driver’s license)
to the exam. 
Your photo on a school identification card isn’t enough on AP day if you’re not taking the test
in your own school, where everyone knows you. Only a government-issued ID is acceptable.
Completing pre-exam chores
Apart from practicing the skills tested, you have a few additional chores to complete before
the AP exam. (Students with special needs have even more to do. See the next section,
“Meeting Special Needs,” for more information.) Here’s the general list:
 January or February: Pick up a student bulletin. This handy pamphlet published by
the College Board is probably stacked in the College Counseling or Guidance Office of
your school. If you can’t find one, ask a teacher, administrator, or the school’s AP
Coordinator. The student bulletin explains when the test is given, provides an up-to-
date fee schedule, and tells you the most current information about the exam. 
A student bulletin is available for downloading from www.collegeboard.com/
apstudents. No Internet access? Call 888-225-5427 for information.
 Early February: Students who need accommodations on the test but haven’t been cer-
tified by the College Board must submit documentation. (See “Meeting Special Needs”
for more information.)
19
Chapter 1: Scoping Out the Exam: An Overview

 Mid- to late February: Students previously certified as needing accommodations on
the exam must check that the school has sent in the required forms. (“Meeting Special
Needs” later in this chapter explains everything.)
 March: Check your calendar. If you have a scheduling conflict (two APs at the same
time or a state-championship game during the essay section, for example), talk with
the AP Coordinator by mid-March. A makeup date is available for unavoidable con-
flicts. Depending upon the conflict, the College Board may charge you nothing or as
much as $40.
 Late April: Homeschoolers and those who are taking the test in a different school
should make a practice run to the exam site. (Can’t you see yourself on Test Day, lost
in a swirl of unfamiliar streets?)
Arriving at the exam
On the day of the test, plan to arrive about 15 minutes early at the exam room. You will 
meet your proctor there — the teacher who supervises the test — and receive your student
pack. The student pack is a small pamphlet containing labels with a number that belongs to
you alone for your entire AP life. You have to fill in some information (unless your school
held a preregistration session). Then you’ll hear a couple of last-minute instructions, mostly
concerning what can and can’t be in the room. Because surprise is not a fun emotion on Test
Day, here are what you must and what you cannot bring to the AP test.
What you must bring into the testing room
Be sure you have these items:
 Pens with blue or black ink. Erasable pens are okay but not the best choice because
they can smudge and make reading difficult for the graders. No one wants a grader
with eyestrain.
 Number two pencils. I have no idea why you can’t use a #1 or a #3 pencil, or even if
any other numbers exist. Just be sure that your pencils are number twos.
 A watch. The test room probably has a clock, but you may not be able to see it easily. 
 A special code number, a government-issued photo ID, and a Student Pack, if you’re
not taking the exam in your own school. 
 Your College Board SSD Accommodations letter, which is issued to students with
special needs. (Check out “Meeting Special Needs” later in this chapter for more
information.)
 Your mind. Always a useful accessory and never out of style.
What you cannot bring into the testing room
Leave these things home or in your car:
 Highlighters or pens with ink that isn’t black or blue. Why? The AP moguls are wor-
ried that you’ll glance at the smartest kid in the school, see the highlights on his or her
exam, focus more on those sections, and gain an advantage.
 Cell phones, iPods, MP3 players, PDAs, or any sort of electronic device. For these
few hours, silence and nothing else flows into your ears.
20
Part I: Preparation without Perspiration 

 Food or drink. Not even water, though you can drink and eat during the break. They’re
worried that you’ll copy something on the label or that you’ll rearrange the atoms in your
turkey sandwich into a spell-check or something like that. Whatever — no refreshments.
If you have a medical condition that requires you to eat, drink, or take medicine during
the exam, check with the AP Coordinator well in advance of the test — by late
February or early March.
 Books, papers, teddy bears, and anything else in the entire world. Depending upon
your proctor, you may bring a purse or bookpack, which you will have to leave in the
front of the room or under your seat. But make things easy on yourself: Leave your
junk in your locker or car trunk. 
Meeting special needs
If your school grants you accommodations for special needs — additional time, a computer
for writing essays, Braille exams or a reader, and so forth — chances are the AP will do the
same. However, don’t assume anything. Take charge of the situation:
 By late January of the year you intend to take the test, talk with the AP Coordinator in
your school about your needs. Homeschoolers or those whose schools don’t have an
AP program should call 888-225-5427 for the name and location of the nearest AP
Coordinator. 
 Before mid-February, ask the AP Coordinator if your school has submitted an official
College Board “student eligibility form” for you. The same form is applicable to the AP,
the SAT, and the PSAT/NMSQT — the whole alphabet of tests that the College Board
administers. However, the AP may not grant you the same accommodations that you
received on another test. 
 If you recently switched schools or if your need for accommodations has changed, you
need a new eligibility form. You may also have to send in additional documentation.
Because the College Board takes up to seven weeks to process these forms, you have
to start early. Again, mid-February gives you ample time to correct any foul-ups.
Remember, you’re dealing with two bureaucracies, the school and the College Board.
Mistakes happen!
 If your special need pops up at the last minute (perhaps you’re in a full-body cast
because of a preseason scrimmage with the football team), tell the AP Coordinator
right away. He or she will call the College Board to request accommodations for you.
 If your special need resides in your bank account, you can apply for a reduced rate. As
of this writing, the AP exam costs $84, but drops to $54 for students who qualify for a
discount. Depending upon where you live, your state or school district may subsidize
more of this amount, making your out-of-pocket expense even lower.
The College Board Web site has a helpful section for students who have special needs
(www.collegeboard.com/ssd/student/index.html). You can also contact the College
Board’s Services for Students with Disabilities Office at 609-771-7137 (TTY 609-882-4118).
Once the College Board has reviewed your paperwork, they’ll issue you an SSD Accommodations
Letter. If you do not receive it by the beginning of April, check with your AP Coordinator. You
must bring the accommodation letter to the exam.

 Dealing with test day nerves
O
ne of the witches in Shakespeare’s Macbeth said it best: “Something wicked this way
comes.” Because you’re reading this book, I’m assuming that “something” is the AP
English Language and Composition exam. Whether the test is a year from now or (gasp!)
tomorrow, this chapter helps you cope. It also tells you what to expect on Test Day itself.
After all, forewarned is forearmed. 
On Your Mark, Get Set...: 
Preparing for the Exam
As I write this paragraph, Olympic swimmers are sloshing toward greatness while their track-
and-field counterparts are hurdling, hurling, and hustling to the finish line. Their activities
differ — and differ greatly from your impending bout with the AP exam — but one common
factor unites all. You can’t get to the Olympics or score high on the AP test without prepara-
tion. The following sections correspond to the amount of time remaining before the exam.
Jump in at the spot that matches your calendar and follow the directions at that point for
optimal AP preparation. (For a timetable of exam logistics — signing up, securing testing
accommodations, and so forth — see Chapter 1.)
Exam minus one year 
You’re starting to prepare a year early, so clearly you have the ability to think ahead, priori-
tize, and get the job done. I may vote for you in the next presidential election. Before you
measure the Oval Office for a new rug, do the following:
 As you plan your schedule for the following academic year, look into the array of English
courses available at your school. Most people who take the AP English Language and
Composition exam also take the AP English course tailored to the material tested on this
AP. However, the exam is open to you whether you’re enrolled in an AP class or not. 
The College Board offers two tests in English — AP English Literature and Composition
and AP English Language and Composition. Both cover college-level material, and both
stress reading and writing skills. If your school offers only the literature course, you
can brush up on the question format with this book and take the language exam
anyway. Non-AP, advanced-level writing courses are also a good bet, so long as you
preview the exam format.

 Hit the newsstand (or the Internet) and read the daily paper, or, if you’re pressed for
time, just the editorials or columns. As you read, think about how the writer argues for
a particular point of view. 
 Every week, read some expository nonfiction (prose that explains something). The field
doesn’t matter; pick something you like. As you read how Picasso developed his style
or why the Allies triumphed, notice the way in which the writer conveys information.
 As you read, keep scrap paper nearby so that you can occasionally practice annotating.
(Check out Chapter 3 for more information on annotating.)
 Analyze visual sources. Peer at advertisements, paintings, photos, charts, and car-
toons. Identify the surface and deeper message of what you’re seeing. (Chapter 8
explains how.)
 Choose a strategy for improving your vocabulary. (See Chapter 3 for help.)
 Gather and file corrected papers and notes from your most recent English classes.
One more thing: Don’t forget to have fun. It’s great to be organized. I am too, or at least I try
to be, but summer comes only once a year. Take advantage of the down time.
September before the exam
Your tan is fading, so I won’t bug you about summer reading or discuss course selection, as
I did in the preceding section. But the start of a new school year is an excellent opportunity
to hit your English class with maximum efficiency. Good study habits take you to top grades
in both the course and the AP exam. I explain the best strategy for your class in Chapter 3.
Here I list a couple of little “extras” of pre-exam preparation that pay off in a big way: 
 Each week, make an effort to read one good editorial or opinion column in a quality
newspaper or magazine. (What constitutes quality? Well, if the top story concerns a
model in a bathing suit, you should probably look for another periodical.) As you read,
keep a pen handy. If you own the publication, annotate it. (Chapter 3 explains how.)
If it’s from the library or on the Internet, jot down some notes about writing style.
 Continue or start consciously adding new words to your vocabulary. In school, you
automatically pick up some vocabulary just by doing your homework. (You are doing
your homework, right?) But by employing one of the strategies I explain in Chapter 3,
you can radically increase the number of words you know.
 Start or add to a file of your writing assignments and tests from current and previous
English classes.
 Keep a notebook or computer file of important points about writing methods and style
from the teacher or from student discussion in your English class.
 Volunteer to write for the school paper or magazine, or send letters to the editor
expressing your opinion. This practice builds writing muscles and helps you with the
essay portion of the AP exam.
January before the exam
Let your New Year’s resolution be to do some serious exam prep, including the following:
 Start or continue with the steps listed in the preceding section, “September before the
exam.”
24
Part I: Preparation without Perspiration 

 Set aside 30–45 minutes each week to read a chapter in this book. If the exam format is
unfamiliar, turn back to Chapter 1. Then pull out your file of tests, quizzes, and papers
from your current and previous English classes. Pay close attention to the teachers’
comments, especially where you lost points. Make a list of weak spots and concentrate
on chapters that develop those skills. 
 Dedicate a weekend morning or afternoon to the practice exam in Chapter 18 and score
it with Chapter 19. Analyze your weaknesses and hit the corresponding chapters in
AP English Language & Composition For Dummies.
 Every time you have a writing assignment (for homework or classwork, in any subject),
pay attention to your writing habits. How do you gather ideas and put them in order?
How do you revise? Check out Chapters 3 and 16 for tips on streamlining and improv-
ing your writing process.
 Go over a few of your writing assignments with a friendly teacher. Assess your work —
what should remain the same and what should improve?
March before the exam
Spring flowers are on the horizon, and so is the AP exam. Not to worry: You have plenty of
time to prepare. 
 Start on or continue with the steps listed in “September before the exam” and “January
before the exam.”
 If you haven’t already done so, take the first practice exam — you’ll find it in Chapter 18 —
and score it with Chapter 19.
 Select practice questions from the chapters addressing the type of question you find
most difficult (multiple-choice or essay).
 Zero in on whatever type of writing tends to stump you — writing with source material,
creating an argument, or analysis. Devote 40 minutes a week to reading or writing that
sort of material.
Two weeks before the exam
If this is your starting point for AP prep, I’m betting that your favorite motto is “Don’t do
today what you can put off until tomorrow.” That’s everyone’s motto at one time or another!
Fortunately, you can still increase your chances for a good grade on the AP. If you’ve been
preparing all along, this section tells you how to make a strong finish:
 Review your most recent English papers (history papers work also) and make a “watch
out list” of problem areas that require special attention on the exam. For example, if you
tend to generalize or repeat yourself, be sure to list those faults so that your AP essays
will be free of them. Go for the big picture; don’t bother writing down misspelled words.
 Take the second practice exam (Chapter 20) and score it (Chapter 21).
 After taking the second practice exam, add to your “watch out list.” Just writing this
list focuses your energy and helps you remember what you need to do on test day.
 Check out the sections on time-saving strategy in Chapters 14 (multiple choice) and 16
(essays). The tips in those chapters help you squeeze six hours’ worth of thought into
half that time period.
 Turn back to Chapter 1 for advice on last-minute practical tasks and a list of what to
bring to the exam.
25
Chapter 2: Counting Down to Test Day

The night before the exam
The test is 12 hours away, and you’re starting to prepare NOW? Congratulations on your
nerves of steel. Here’s your strategy: Skim Chapter 1 so you know the format of the exam.
Sample a couple of questions in one of the practice tests and evaluate your responses. Then
return to this list. (Also, remember the panicky feeling you’re currently experiencing. Resolve
to begin exam prep a little earlier next time!) You’ve been preparing for a while? Good for
you. You’re almost done:
 Read your “Watch Out” list and then STOP studying. Anything you do now will only
make you more nervous.
 Do something relaxing but not too strenuous. Shoot some hoops or watch a trashy tele-
vision show. Stay away from all-night gossip sessions (or all-night anythings).
 Go to bed early, after making sure you have everything you need for the exam in one
spot that is not accessible to pets, wildlife, little brothers, or anything else likely to
mess with your stuff. (See Chapter 1 for a list of what you must bring to the test.)
 Excavate the car keys or recheck your travel arrangements. Set the alarm clock so you
won’t have to rush in the morning. Begin snoring.
Go! Surviving Exam Day
It’s finally here, and like every dreaded event, the reality is less horrible than the anticipa-
tion. Here’s how to get through exam day with a minimum of fuss.
The morning of the exam
Cheer up. I said “morning,” not “mourning.” The AP schedule varies a bit from year to year,
so your exam may be scheduled for 8:30 a.m. or for 1 p.m., give or take a half hour. In some
schools run by former prison superintendents, students who have an afternoon exam have
to report to morning classes anyway. In other, more civilized schools, you get the morning off
if you have an afternoon AP. Either way, try to make the slide into AP-land as smooth as pos-
sible, with these points in mind:
 AP Day isn’t the right time for an extreme fashion statement, especially one that
involves something skin-tight. You are going to spend a huge amount of time at a desk,
and no one but the proctor is allowed to look at you. So unless you have to adhere to a
dress code, choose sweats or something just as comfortable (and comforting). Also, go
for the layered look. You don’t know how hot or cold the testing room will be. Adding
or subtracting a layer without risking arrest should be an option.
 Leave everything you don’t need for the test at home or in your car. No matter what,
don’t bring English notes to school with you. You may be tempted to read them before
you go in the testing room. Bad idea! Last-minute studying accomplishes very little
beyond stirring up your nerves. True, you may reread something that is on the test, but
odds are you’ll read something, tell yourself you know nothing about it, and then forget
everything you do know. (“Hyperbole? What’s that? I’m gonna fail. I don’t know what
hyperbole is!” That sort of scenario.)
 Don’t “lend your ear” to friends or Romans or countrymen or anyone else before the
exam, unless they promise not to talk about the test or the subject matter they think is
on it. Why? The preceding bullet point explains how easy it is to enter panic mode.
Resolve to discuss what really happened on Lost or who is likely to win the World
Series. Stay away from AP English!
26
Part I: Preparation without Perspiration 

 Eat a good breakfast, heavy on the protein. Sugar and carbs give you a rush and then a
letdown, nicely timed to hit during the exam. Even if you’re a jelly doughnut fan, opt for
eggs, cheese, tofu, or meat-based items. As we New Yorkers say, don’t even think about
skipping breakfast on AP Day.
 Don’t drink half a tub of water or coffee or anything on the morning of the exam. The
break is short and occurs only after you’ve been popping your brain cells for an hour.
Yes, you can leave the testing room to use the restroom, but you lose time, and time on
the AP is precious. Save the supersized soda for later.
 Before you leave the house, look at yourself in the mirror. Say (aloud, if you don’t mind
scaring your family, or silently, if you do), “I am prepared. I will give this test my best
shot.” Picture yourself leaving all your worries behind. Then hit the road!
No matter how much advice I give you, you still have to tailor everything to your life and your
brain. As you prepare for the AP, factor in details only you know — that your sister’s wedding
is the day before the AP (lucky you!) or that you write best when you hear a clock ticking.
(In that case, buy a noisy wristwatch before Test Day.)
As the exam begins
Once you enter the testing room, the proctor takes over. To give you an idea what to expect
and for a few additional helpful hints, scan this list:
 Where to sit: You may have an assigned seat. If you are allowed to choose your own
seat, steer clear of anyone who’s sneezing, wheezing, or making any sort of bodily
noise. No distractions make for better grades! If possible, snag a chair in full view of
the clock. (You brought a wristwatch anyway, right? Turn back to Chapter 1 for hints
on what to bring into the testing room.)
 What to do with your stuff: You probably have to leave your purse, backpack, suit-
case, spacesuit, and everything but the required writing utensils at the front of the
room. Therefore, AP Day is not the time to transport that diamond necklace your Aunt
Selma is lending Uncle Herman. After a long test, people sometimes grab the wrong
bag. In fact, people grab the wrong bag at other times, too.
 Getting the Student Pack: When everyone is settled, the proctor distributes the
Student Pack, which may also be called a candidate pack, and gives out answer sheets
and question booklets, which are wrapped in see-through plastic. The Student Pack is
basic AP identification. It contains a number assigned to you, and to no one else, for
every AP exam that you take — English, math, French, history, whatever. In some
schools, the Student Pack is already on the desk when you enter the testing room.
(The pack serves as a placecard. Find yours and sit there. It’s your assigned seat.) 
Once you’re seated and have your Student Pack, the proctor will lead you through the filling-
out-the-forms rigamarole, which goes like this:
1. Peel a label from your student pack and stick it on your answer sheet. 
2. Fill in the answers to some questions — your name, address, and the like. 
See how hard the AP is? You have to know your own name.
3. Read a bunch of legal notices and sign on a specific line to indicate that you agree
to the conditions set by the College Board. 
For example, you’re giving the AP the right to investigate if they think you’ve cheated.
Unless you indicate otherwise, you’re giving them the right to use your deathless prose
(the essays) in their publications as examples of student work. Note: If you’d rather no
one but the grader read what you’ve written, you can decline to give them permission
to use your work. Your score will not be affected.
27
Chapter 2: Counting Down to Test Day

One crucial legal notice concerns the questions on the exam. Basically, you’re never
allowed to discuss the multiple-choice questions with anyone, ever, even on your 110th
birthday. Multiple-choice questions take a long time to write (and I speak as someone
who has written many). The College Board wants to be able to reuse questions. So
keep your lips sewn shut on this topic or risk having your score cancelled. You can talk
about the essay questions after a few days. (They aren’t reused, probably because
they’re much easier to create.)
4. Copy the form number of the test onto your answer sheet, ensuring that the graders
and the grading machine will use the correct answer key — always a good idea!
5. Read a few more legal notices — more of the same conditions — and sign your
name a few more times. 
After you complete the paperwork, the proctor will instruct you when to begin work on the
multiple-choice section. (The essay portion stays sealed.) When the multiple-choice portion
is completed, you get a short break (see the section “Break time” for details), and then come
back in to complete the essay portion of the test. 
During the exam, listen carefully to the proctor and follow every instruction, no matter how
dumb. If the proctor tells you to open the green question booklet, you’re in big trouble if you
absent mindedly open the pink answer booklet instead. 
Break time
Yes, it’s break time. Put this book down immediately and go outside for a bike ride. (Just kid-
ding.) AP Break time occurs between the multiple-choice and the essays. They give you a
measly ten minutes. Use it wisely:
 Stay away from fellow sufferers. Someone inevitably says, “Gee, I wasn’t expecting
seven B answers in a row,” whereupon everyone else immediately plunges into a 
calculation of how many B answers they got. Then everyone gets nervous for
absolutely no good reason. First of all, it doesn’t matter how many B answers anyone
got. The AP sometimes shuffles the multiple choice around, so your question book may
not match someone else’s. (That’s why you have to copy the form number of your test
onto the answer sheet.) Second, who says that someone else’s answers are right? 
 Grab some food or a beverage, if you have time to do so without being late for the
essay portion of the test. Don’t overindulge. You’re about to face 135 minutes of read-
ing and writing, and you don’t want to waste any on trips to the restroom.
 Indulge in stretching, yawning, shaking, or any other physical activity that loosens
your muscles. Cramps inhibit brain power.
 When the proctor says to go in, go in. If you’re late, two scenarios are possible. Either
you’ll hold everyone else up as they wait for you (and making a long test even longer
isn’t exactly the way to win a popularity contest) or you’ll be barred from the second
half of the test. 
If disaster strikes
Things happen. Some may be your fault, and some may not. If the test is interrupted by, say,
a fire drill, the proctor will report that fact to the College Board. If the proctor can convince
the powers-that-be that no one spoke or exchanged information during the interruption, the
test may resume and the scores will count. More likely, you’ll have to take the test again. 
28
Part I: Preparation without Perspiration 

If you have a problem during the test (that week-old sushi wasn’t a good idea), you may
choose to cancel your score. You can tell the proctor immediately and fill out a cancellation
form on the spot. You won’t get a refund, but you won’t get a bad grade either, because offi-
cially, the test didn’t happen.
If you can’t even make it to the test (you’re in the hospital, jail, the Olympics, whatever) and
you’ve already paid, inform the AP Coordinator. You may be able to take the test at another
time or (rarely) qualify for a refund.
After the Exam
Yes, I know this chapter is about AP preparation, but I can’t resist throwing in a couple of
ideas for the post-AP period:
 Keep your mouth firmly sealed if anyone ever asks you about the multiple-choice ques-
tions. Your test will be cancelled if you blab.
 Ditto for the essays, though you have to keep quiet only for a few days after the test.
But if you talk before the essay questions are released, you’re in trouble.
 Do something relaxing during the evening after the AP exam; you’ve earned a break.
 Once the dust of the exam has settled, think about your performance on the test. You
may have more APs (in different subjects) to face in the future. Before you forget, 
make a list of things that should — and will — be different next time. For instance,
you may decide to start preparing earlier or later. 
If you think you can do better on the AP English Language and Composition test, you can
take it again a year later, as long as you are still under the age of 21 (the official age limit for
the AP exam). The colleges will see both scores, but your newer and higher score will show
your determination to succeed, a helpful trait when you’re applying to college.
If you know you’ve messed up on the exam, you can request that the College Board withhold
your score from the college(s) you listed. They charge $15 for each withheld score, and they
must receive a written request within about two weeks of the exam. (The AP Coordinator will
know the exact deadline.) If you change your mind, you can later — for a fee — send the
score to the college(s) of your choice. You can also cancel the score completely. Score can-
cellation is permanent, however.

A
long with your AP exam score, the grades you earn in your English classes are scruti-
nized by college admissions officers. Fortunately for you, earning a higher grade in an
English class is easy. All you have to do is hone your reading and writing skills, and good
grades will follow. Plus, better skills actually make the work go faster. (Not that you don’t
love every single second of your English homework.) Even better, the same skills that help
you ace English class also lead to a stellar AP exam score. 
Think of this chapter as a fitness center, with me as your personal trainer. Work your way
through each section, paying special attention to what trainers tend to call “problem areas.”
Gradually your “English muscles” will reach Olympic level.
Note: Because this book preps you for the AP English Language and Composition test, I’ve
tailored my comments to the sort of work you do in an AP English Language course. If you’re
enrolled in an AP English Lit course or a non-AP English course, never fear. Everything in
this chapter will help you also, though here I neglect some areas that are no-shows on the
AP English Language exam, such as poetry. (To review poetry and other areas tested on the
AP English Lit test, feel free to boost my ego by reading AP English Literature and Composition
For Dummies, which I wrote and Wiley published in 2008.)
Keeping Track: Annotating and Note-Taking
English is the most exciting subject you’ll ever take. I’m not, of course, biased by my status
as an English teacher. Just think of the subject matter! In English class you study the pro-
found ideas that writers have set down through the ages. You discuss and accept or reject
these ideas. Then you express your own view of the topic. What could be better? Of course,
in order to study, react, and express, you first have to keep track of what you’ve read and
heard. To accomplish this task, you annotate the text and take notes in class. This section
shows you how to improve both of these skills.

Annotating
Your English homework assignment is to read a portion of Treatises on Old Age and Friendship,
a collection of essays by the ancient Roman Marcus Tullius Cicero. Because you’re a good stu-
dent, you skip the Internet summary (yes, English teachers know about and hate Internet
shortcuts) and settle down to read. Then you hit your math homework, write a science report,
and organize a fundraising drive for your favorite cause. Twenty hours later you arrive at
English class and open the textbook. Cicero’s essay looks vaguely familiar, but so much has
traveled through your brain since you last saw it that it may as well be in the original Latin
(which you never learned). If only you had annotated the text!
Annotation is simply note-taking attached to a piece of writing. To annotate effectively, you
have to figure out which portions of the text to spotlight. In general, annotate the following:
 Important lines 
 Anything confusing
 Unfamiliar words
 Everything the teacher refers to during class
Take a look at Figure 3-1 to see an example of homework annotation in action. Notice the four
question marks in the left-hand margin. Three refer to vocabulary problems —”par excel-
lence,” “sagacity,” and “fastidious.” As you see, I box vocabulary words. You may prefer to
highlight them in a different color. After consulting the dictionary, you can record the defini-
tions in the margins of your text (if you own the book) or add them to your personal vocabu-
lary-building file. (See “Pumping Up Your Vocabulary” in this chapter for more information.)
Another question mark indicates a confusing reference to the “Seven Sages.” Check “Seven
Sages” on the Internet or ask the teacher during class. Add the explanation to your annotated
text or to your notebook. Now read the annotations in the right-hand margin. They remind
you what’s where in the passage, so if the teacher asks you to compare Cato to Laelius,
you’re all set. Lastly, notice the underlined “main reason” why Laelius is wise — an important
statement in the passage.
If you’re like most people, you may think everything in the passage seems important enough
to annotate. But too much annotation is as bad as no annotation at all. Differentiate between
main ideas and supportive explanations or examples when you annotate. 
 
You are quite right, Laelius! there never was a better or more illustrious character 
than Africanus. But you should consider that at the present moment all eyes are on you. 
Everybody calls you "the wise" par excellence, and thinks you so. The same mark of respect 
was lately paid Cato, and we know that in the last generation Lucius Atilius was called "the 
wise."  But in both cases the word was applied with a certain difference. Atilius was so 
called from his reputation as a jurist; Cato got the name as a kind of honorary title and in  
extreme old age because of his varied experience of affairs, and his reputation for foresight 
and firmness, and the sagacity of the opinions which he delivered in the senate and forum.  
You, however, are regarded as wise in a somewhat different sense not alone on account of 
natural ability and character, but also from your industry and learning; and not in the sense 
in which the vulgar, but that in which scholars, give that title.  In this sense we do not read
of any one being called wise in Greece except one man at Athens; and he, to be sure, had 
been declared by the oracle of Apollo also to be "the supremely wise man." For those who 
commonly go by the name of the Seven Sages are not admitted into the category of the wise 
by fastidious critics.  Your wisdom, people believe to consist in this — that you look upon 
yourself as self-sufficing and regard the changes and chances of mortal life as powerless to 
affect your virtue.

If you own the book, the easiest way to annotate is to underline, highlight, or circle lines of
text and jot down a few words in the margin. If you don’t own the book, sticky notes and a
notebook or computer file are the way to go. Place a sticky note next to the relevant line. In
your notebook or in a computer file, write the page number and a comment.
Of course, you annotate during class also. If the teacher or another student mentions a par-
ticular point, underline or take note of its location and write a comment. But don’t record
any student observation that draws a remark like “interesting but irrelevant observation” or
“principal’s office — now!”
Highlighting is fine for homework assignments, but on the AP exam, only blue or black ink is
permitted. If your annotation style relies heavily on highlighting (different colors mean differ-
ent things, for example), practice annotating without a highlighter.
Note-taking
Your English teacher may stand behind a podium to lecture, sit in the lotus position atop a
desk to observe a free-flowing discussion, or hit the middle ground between these two
extremes. Regardless of your teacher’s instruction style, you have to record the important
points made during class. Relying on your ability to resist e-mail, fantasy baseball, and
YouTube, your school may allow laptops. Or you may be confined to paper and pen. No
problem! You can take great notes on anything, including cocktail napkins, if you keep a few
rules in mind:
 Listen to the teacher. If your teacher is a minimalist who says very little during class,
write most of what you hear. If the teacher blathers on and on, listen for changes in
tone or volume. Most teachers emphasize crucial ideas that way.
 Write whatever is on the board, along with explanatory comments. You need the
comments because, in the heat of the battle against ignorance, some teachers put one
word on the board and then speak for ten minutes. If you don’t put an explanation next
to that word, you end up scratching your head and asking, “Doughnut? Why did I write
doughnut?” 
 Pay special attention to anything the teacher reads aloud. Whatever a teacher reads
aloud from the text is important. Write the comment and tie it to the text by under-
lining or highlighting (if you own the book) or with a sticky note or a few words in
your notebook or computer file. Everything in your notebook or computer file should
include a page number so that you can check the text as needed.
 Take notes on any student comment that is met with “good point” or “yes, and . . ..”
Some student comments are excellent; others — not so much. To tell the difference,
be alert for the teacher’s qualifying remarks such as “yes, but . . . ” or “the counter-
argument is . . . .”
Note-taking in class is just the first step. Squeeze out a little time after class (no later than the
next day) to reread what you recorded. Add ideas you didn’t have time to note during class.
Because two heads really are better than one, reviewing your notes with a classmate is a
good idea. Your friend may have caught something you missed, and vice versa.
Some people like to take notes on a divided page. The right hand portion is for the notes and
the left for “main idea” comments. For example, in the right margin, you may have “Laelius is
virtuous regardless of what happens — self sufficient, knows who he is, doesn’t change.” In
the left margin you’d write: “why Laelius is wise.” The left margin is more or less a subhead
for the right side of the page. Generally, the ideas in the left margin are added later, but the
process can go either way. If the discussion is moving along at a fast pace, write the main
idea on the left. Later, add details on the right.

Chapter 3: Making the Grade in AP English Class

Closing In on Close Reading 
No matter how many papers I have to grade, every evening I curl up with a book for at least a
few minutes. I must confess that not every volume is a great specimen of literature. Or, as my
husband says bluntly, I sometimes read verbal junk food. (I hope they don’t kick me out of
the English-teachers guild for admitting that fact!) Junk-food reading is fun, but it slides into
you like ice cream — no chewing required. Quality literature, which is the only kind that
appears on the AP, is different. To extract everything that’s present in the text, you have to
expend a little effort, to engage in what English teachers call “close reading.” One of my col-
leagues referred to this process as “engaging in an extended conversation with the author.”
The conversation varies, but it probably includes this sort of exchange:
READER: Hm...m. Nice point about freckles. But why are you making such a big deal
about the beach umbrella?
TEXT: As the beach umbrella slowly sagged into the sand, I saw my childhood slip away.
READER: Oh, now I get it. The umbrella symbolizes protection. Without protection, the
child is vulnerable.
TEXT: The sunburn, according to the doctor, probably led to my mother’s bout of skin 
cancer.
READER: So that’s why you’re advocating more funds for cancer research! 
See what I mean? When you “converse” with the text, you inevitably begin to ask why. Why is
this detail included? Why does the information about the beach umbrella appear in the first
paragraph instead of later? Why “slip away” and not “end”? Why mention cancer? Answering
these questions, you comprehend more. As an added benefit, close readers also learn a lot
about writing style. A crucial element of the AP English Language and Composition exam and
any advanced English class concerns the choices authors make and the effect of those
choices on the reader. Such an analysis helps you answer questions about others’ writing
and improves your own writing as well. (Two for the price of one!)
Checking out the content
The material on the AP English Language and Composition exam is almost exclusively non-
fiction, so I concentrate on that type of literature in this section. However, most of the read-
ing techniques I describe here also apply to prose fiction and, to some extent, to poetry and
drama also.
When you read, follow these steps to improved reading comprehension: 
1. Figure out the surface meaning.
If any words or references are unfamiliar, look them up. Untangle long sentences so
that you know the subject, verb, and object or complement. (For more grammar info
on subjects, verbs, or anything else, turn to Chapter 7.)
2. Pay attention to punctuation. 
Punctuation tells you a lot, such as which ideas are linked together, when someone’s
exact words appear, and when the writer injects doubt with a question mark or drama
with an exclamation point. 
3. Check out the pronouns. 
Can you substitute a noun for every pronoun? Pay particular attention to “this,”
“which,” “that,” and “it.” If you zoom past one of those pronouns without figuring out
its antecedent (the word the pronoun replaced), you may misinterpret the meaning. 
34
Part I: Preparation without Perspiration 

4. Go “between the lines.” 
Most writers don’t state every idea because they assume that you, the reader, can infer
quite a lot. For instance, suppose the passage tells you that an army greatly outnum-
bered the opposing forces, but soldiers were hampered by an insufficient number of
weapons. You may infer that some soldiers were inexperienced. Why? If there aren’t
enough arms to go around, some of the fighters were new recruits.
5. Interpret figurative language.
Check for metaphors, symbols, and anything else that resides in imagination territory.
When you encounter figurative language, explore its meaning. (I tell you more about
figurative language in Part II.)
6. Characterize the intended audience and purpose.
To whom is the author writing? How do you know? What sort of reaction does the
author want? How does the author provoke that reaction?
7. Restate what you’ve read in simpler terms. 
After you finish Steps 1–6, it’s time to put it all together. Talk to yourself (in your inner
voice, to avoid alarming anyone around). Tell yourself what you’ve understood. Before
moving on, be sure you’ve grasped everything.
Paying attention to writing style
Once you’ve got content under control, take a moment to think about writing style. Some ele-
ments of writing style overlap with content, of course. However, the way in which something
is written — what the AP test makers call rhetorical technique or rhetorical devices — matters.
Follow these steps to appreciate the author’s style:
1. Examine the structure.
What comes first, last, and in-between? Can you figure out the logical thread? A work of
literature may be organized chronologically or spatially (moving through a room from
right to left, perhaps). It may use comparison or a cause-effect structure, among other
organizing principles.
2. Consider word choice and tone.
An athlete may appreciate being called “muscled” but not “steroidal.” “Striding” across
a room differs from “strolling” or “stomping.” Word choice points you toward tone, the
“sound” of the author. (Confused about tone? Check out Chapter 4.)
3. Identify building blocks.
Does the author rely on a ton of description or a couple of anecdotes to get the point
across? Has the author drawn on source material? If so, which sources? 
4. Check out sentence length and patterns.
Victorian writers are famous for marathon sentences — some a page or more in length.
Hemingway frequently employed short, stabbing sentences. The dominant pattern for
all writers is subject-verb-object. Has this writer varied from that pattern? What effect
does the variation have on the reader? (If you’re hyperventilating because I used a
grammar term, calm down. Then turn to Chapter 7 for help.)
5. Think about why the author made particular style choices. 
Identifying the elements of an author’s style isn’t enough. You must consider the effect
of the author’s choices on the reader. To put it another way, how do style and content
relate to each other?
35
Chapter 3: Making the Grade in AP English Class

Sounds like a lot, I know. But if you get in the habit of reading this way, you won’t need much —
if any — extra time. You’re changing the way you read, not how much you read. Remember, if
you close read, your understanding of the work will rise like a rocket (and so will your English
grades!).
Pumping Up Your Vocabulary
Writers swim in a soup of words. They splash around happily, throwing a “fiddle-faddle” here
and a “tintinnabulation” there. The literary works you encounter in an advanced English course
prepare you well for the level of vocabulary on the AP English Language and Composition
exam. But most of the new words from class readings enter your passive vocabulary. You recog-
nize them when you see them in context, but you don’t know them when they’re alone (for
example, in a multiple-choice answer). Furthermore, you can’t easily plant them in a sentence
of your own, where they’re part of your active, usable vocabulary. And the more words you
have at your disposal, the better you’ll do in English class and on the AP exam.
Happily, you can move words from passive to active vocabulary with very little effort by
making a personal dictionary. The dictionary can be on index cards or in a computer file or
notebook — whatever you like. To create the dictionary, follow these steps:
1. Write down the unfamiliar word and the sentence it appears in. 
If the sentence is long, just write enough of the surrounding words so that the context
is clear.
2. Define the word. 
Most words have several definitions. Don’t write all of them, just the one that fits the
context of the sentence. Also, feel free to reword the definition. The dictionary is
formal, but you don’t have to be.
3. Note the part of speech.
If it’s a noun, you don’t want to mistake it for a verb and use it incorrectly. (Check
Chapter 7 for grammar help.)
4. Jot down the word’s “family.” 
Most dictionaries list other forms of the word, so you can pick up a whole word
“family” with one shot. For example, “motivation” may be accompanied by “motivate”
and “motivated.” If examples are given, jot down enough to distinguish between one
form and another.
5. Review what you’ve written.
Yes, this is the hard part. But if you never look back at your personal dictionary, you’ll
never remember the words in it. You don’t have to devote a lot of time to this project.
Once a week, spend 15 minutes flipping through your dictionary. Concentrate your
energy on words you’ve forgotten. Read the words, the context, and the definition.
The context helps you remember the meaning of the word and guides you in your own
writing. 
A subsection of AP-level vocabulary involves literary terminology. You can list these terms in
your personal dictionary, but you don’t have to. In this book, literary terms are italicized and
defined immediately. As you work your way through AP English Language & Composition 
For Dummies, those terms will burrow into your mind (think of them as alien creatures) and
set up housekeeping.
36
Part I: Preparation without Perspiration 

Anything that brings you into contact with words helps build your vocabulary. Do the daily
crossword puzzle, play Scrabble with a strong opponent, and watch television shows in
which people discuss things. Read a good newspaper or magazine. From all these sources,
add words to your personal dictionary.
You can also build your vocabulary and enhance your comprehension by reading Greek
myths. The stories are great, and many authors refer to them — in shorthand — in their writ-
ing. If you know Greek mythology, you can decode references to someone’s “personal
odyssey” or a promotion that’s the “apple of discord” in an office. (Have I stumped you?
Odysseus, a Greek hero, wandered for twenty years from the Trojan War back to his home
in Ithaca and had many adventures along the way. So a “personal odyssey” implies a long,
eventful journey — either literally or figuratively. The “apple of discord” was labeled “for
the fairest” and rolled into a bunch of goddesses. You can imagine the ensuing fight!) 
Writing: Process Makes Perfect
Every advanced English class includes a ton of writing, and an AP English Language and
Composition class is no exception. In fact, expect approximately two tons of writing when you
see the AP English Language label attached to a course. According to College Board guide-
lines, an AP English Language and Composition class teaches you to write about a variety of
subjects, including “public policies, popular culture, [and] personal experiences.” You’re
expected to write “narrative, expository, analytical, and argumentative” essays and base some
of your writing on research from several sources. Furthermore, the course includes informal
writing (responses to the reading, journal entries, and the like). Last — and most important —
an AP English Language and Composition course must focus on writing as a process of gather-
ing and organizing ideas, drafting, and revising.
Even if your English class doesn’t carry the AP label, chances are the teacher stresses writing
process. And if the teacher doesn’t, you should. Why? Because that’s what writing is — a set
of steps that carries you from idea (or assignment) to a piece of polished prose. If you short-
circuit these steps, you end up with a less-than-your-best product. In this section I take you
through the process, step by step. 
Gathering and grouping ideas
When homework is hanging over your head, you want to get it over with. (You thought teach-
ers didn’t know?) Understandably, you’re eager to start writing so that you can move closer
to the finish line. (If you’re writing with a time limit on the AP exam, the pressure to pour
words on the page is even higher. I address timing issues in Chapter 16.) However, you can’t
know what you’re writing about until you dump your brain onto the paper. You see, writing is
a form of thinking. (One writer once remarked that she wrote because “I don’t know what I
think until I’ve read what I said.”) When you plop down every idea — good, bad, irrelevant,
or crucial — you see what’s in your brain. Then you can pick and choose which ideas to
include in your paper.
You can accomplish a “brain dump” in any of several ways. In my experience, one of these
three methods works for everyone, and the best method is the one that fits the writer’s per-
sonality. Which one is right for you? Test-drive whichever seems most attractive. If that one
doesn’t fit, try all three and choose the one you like best. 
37
Chapter 3: Making the Grade in AP English Class

Listing
Very organized people (I’m one) love listing. Just take a blank sheet of paper or open a new
file on your computer. Make a list of all your ideas on the topic. As you list, don’t worry
about the order in which an idea appears. You can move things around later. Also, forget
about spelling and complete sentences and all the other conventions of English. Just concen-
trate on content. After you’ve listed everything that comes to mind, go back over your list. A
couple of ideas won’t be useful; cross them off. Then group the remaining ideas into logical
subtopics. You don’t have to rewrite or spend an hour cutting and pasting. Just label similar
ideas with a letter — one group is A, another B, and so on. These groups are your subtopics. 
Free-writing
Neo-hippies and rebels love this technique. To free-write, pour your mind onto the paper for
a few minutes. Concentrate on the topic, but don’t censor yourself if you drift away a bit. Just
gently refocus. Though you’re writing in paragraph style, for a little while don’t worry about
grammar, spelling, or even logic. Just write. Don’t stop to think, and don’t go back to reread
what’s there until your free-writing time is up. (About 10 or 15 minutes is plenty, but even 5
minutes will do.) Time’s up? Shake out your tired hand muscles as you read your work. Every
time you find a useful idea, underline it. When you finish reading, assess what’s there. If you
don’t have enough to get started on the assignment, free-write again, focusing on the most
interesting underlined portions of your previous free-write. Then go back and underline the
new stuff. 
When you have enough material, mentally sort the underlined phrases into subtopics. Label
everything in one subtopic with the same letter (A, B, C, etc.). 
Clustering
Some people, especially those who are visually oriented, create a cluster — a kind of word
picture in which similar ideas are linked on the page. To create a cluster, write the topic in
the center and circle it. Then write every idea that comes into your mind around the center.
If a couple of ideas emerge at the same time, place them near each other. If a new idea pops
up, place it somewhere else. When you’re done, use circles and arrows to connect ideas.
Then label the connected ideas, using A for one group, B for another, and so on.
Check out Figure 3-2 for a cluster based on Cicero’s Treatise on Old Age and Friendship, which
appears in Figure 3-1. Imagine that the assignment was to define true wisdom, reacting to
Cicero’s ideas. As you see, “inner reality” is linked to “actions” and “career.” “Many defini-
tions” connects to “Laelius different,” and “Laelius different” is tied to three phrases: “inner
directed,” “my own definition,” and “inner & outer.” The letter-labels show you the logical
groupings. One subtopic contrasts definitions of wisdom arising from what a person does
(“actions” and “career”) with a character-based definition (“inner directed”). Another poten-
tial group considers alternatives (“many definitions”). This point connects to Cicero’s
description of Laelius (“inner directed”) and the writer’s own definition of wisdom, which
apparently includes both “inner & outer” qualities. 
Organizing information
I’m not a big fan of the traditional outline (roman numerals, capital letters, progressive
indentations — you know what I mean), because I tend to spend more time worrying about
the format (do I indent here or not?) than the logic behind it. I do like an informal outline
(everything I intend to say, grouped the way I want to say it, without frills) when I have time
to make one. Regardless of how it looks, an outline forces me to create a logical thread to tie
my ideas together. A logical thread, by the way, creates the structure of a piece of writing.
38
Part I: Preparation without Perspiration 

Sadly, logical threads aren’t sold in sewing stores. You’ve got to dig one out of your brain.
Happily, many threads are possible, once you know what to look for. Consider your options
when you’re writing and choose the one that best fits your information:
Cause and effect 
This structure describes action and reaction or event and consequence: Cutting down the
cherry orchard ruined the presidential hopes of Georgie Washington because he had no way to
prove his truthfulness (“I cannot tell a lie . . .”). This structure works nicely if you’re arguing
for or against a particular policy or explaining why something happened.
Comparison and contrast 
When you compare and contrast, you consider one thing relative to another: The docs on
Grey’s Anatomy and the docs on ER are alike because they have tangled love-lives. The shows
differ because it’s always raining in Grey’s, which is set in Seattle, and broiling or snowing in ER,
which is Chicago-based. Got the picture? You can compare and contrast anything, treating
each element separately (a paragraph for Grey’s and another for ER) or putting the similari-
ties in one paragraph and the differences in another.
Chronological order
This structure takes you forward in time: First Marco threw a pie, then Louisa caught it with her
exceptionally large nose and flipped it to Roger, who sat down and began chewing. Chronological
order works well when you’re explaining a process or writing about a historical event. (You can
also fiddle with chronological order, employing flashbacks or flash-forwards, if you wish.)

Spatial order
With this structure, you move the reader through space: On the right is the drum stand, which
gently supports a drumstick. Moving eastward you encounter a drum-major, tapping out the beat.
She’s in front of thirty tuba players . . . Get the idea? This structure is good for description.
Induction/deduction
Induction leads the reader from specifics (litter covers the cafeteria floor, the tables are
sticky) to general (students aren’t cleaning up after themselves). Deduction travels in the
other direction: general (students are piggy) supported by specifics (those dirty paper plates
didn’t throw themselves on the ceiling!). The second pattern is probably the one you’re most
accustomed to: Make a statement and prove it. Try induction sometime; it’s a sturdy struc-
ture for argument (a major part of the AP exam).
Much of the writing you do in English class requires you to formulate a statement that you
prove true. The statement is your “thesis,” and the proof is generally a set of supporting
points drawn from a literary selection or from real life. For a detailed description of how to
create a thesis statement, turn to Chapter 16.
You may come up with a different organizing scheme. Good for you! Just be sure your struc-
ture supports the ideas you’re conveying to the reader.
Drafting and revising
Once you know the content and order of your essay, it’s time to draft. The computer is ideal
for this task because the machine allows you to rewrite easily, but pen and paper are fine
too. (If you’re writing by hand, skip lines so that you’ll have room to make changes.) The
point about creating a series of drafts is that the first one is never the last. No writer is that
good! During round one, work your way through each subtopic, and create an introduction
and conclusion if they’re appropriate to the type of piece you’re writing. (Some informal
tasks — journal entries or responses to the reading — don’t require introductions and 
conclusions.) 
Are you living on writer’s block? You can relocate! Just leave some space and write the easi-
est subtopic first. You can always go back to the introduction or to another subtopic.
After the first draft is complete, reread what you wrote, changing as you go. If this step
brings on a bad mood, you have a lot of company. Every writer I know hates revision, but
every piece of writing needs it. Think of the piece you’re working on as a custom-made suit.
No matter how much you measure beforehand, when you try on the suit for the first time, it
will sag in one spot or pull in another. A little adjustment pays off. It’s the same thing with
your paragraphs. Because you were thinking about content, you probably didn’t display your
very best style in the first draft. So make another draft, and, if needed, still another. Check
these points:
 Mechanics. No, not the people who change the oil filter on the family car. Mechanics, in
the English-class definition, includes spelling, grammar, and punctuation. 
 Sentence style. Are all your sentences the same length? Consider combining a couple
to make a mega-sentence. Just be sure to use a conjunction — words such as “and,”
“while,” “but,” and the like — or a semicolon. Also look at sentence patterns. Too much
of one pattern is boring. For example, if you have a series of ideas joined by “and,” add
a little variety by inserting a participle. You can change “He prepared dinner, and he
used up all the eggs” to “Preparing dinner, he used up all the eggs.” (If you’re grammar-
challenged and the terms have made you break out in hives, Chapter 7 is for you.)
40
Part I: Preparation without Perspiration 

 Clarity. One of the hardest tasks for any writer is differentiating between what’s on the
page and what’s inside the writer’s brain. An outside editor helps here, because no
editor can read what you meant to say, only what you actually said. But you can act as
an editor too, especially if you edit a few days after writing the first draft (or a few hours
or, in a pinch, minutes). The interval between writing and editing allows you to see the
work with fresh eyes. Try to spot places in which you haven’t been perfectly clear.
Many writers fall into the ambiguous-pronoun trap, explaining that “Mary told her
sister that she had to text her dogwalker.” Who has to text? Whose dogwalker? The
way the sentence is now, Mary may need to text or Mary’s sister may be the one with
itchy fingers. Check your pronouns! (Chapter 7 explains more about pronouns, if you’re
interested.)
 Conciseness. Don’t repeat yourself. Saying the same thing twice is annoying to the
reader. If you repeat yourself, the reader won’t like your writing. Repetition is a bad
idea. See what I mean? You’re probably annoyed at this exact moment by my constant
harping on the annoying qualities of repetition. Bottom line: Go back over your draft
and cross out anything you’ve already said.
 Specifics. Generalities have a place in writing, but that place is narrower than a cheap-
ticket airline seat. Specifics make your writing come alive. Suppose you’re writing
about public funds and athletic arenas. Your position is that professional sports
enhance the economy, so the expenditure of tax dollars is warranted. Those state-
ments are fine. However, isn’t it more interesting to read about the New York Yankees
and the recently constructed stadium? Wouldn’t you want to know how much money
taxpayers spent on the stadium and what they got in return? I pay taxes, and I would.
But even if I lived in a non-Yankee spot, I’d still rather read about a team, or a couple of
teams, than about sports in general. 
Revision literally means seeing again. When you see something again — really see it —you
may need to tinker with it or you may have to perform major surgery. If your draft falls into
the second category, don’t be afraid to wield a scalpel. Sometimes the first draft is merely a
way to think about the topic. The second draft (which you’ll also revise) is where the writing
actually occurs.
No Lab Required: Research for English Class
An old saying reminds you that “into each life, some rain must fall.” A little-known variation (I
just made it up) is “Into each student’s English class, some research must fall, especially if
the student’s taking an AP English Language course.” According to the College Board, AP
English Language classes must teach a “researched argument paper” that “includes the
analysis and synthesis of ideas” from several sources. Furthermore, students in AP English
Language courses must learn how to cite sources. (These skills are tested in the synthesis
essay. See Chapter 16 for more information.) Just about all English courses, AP or not,
include short research assignments as well — to find out how a word’s definition has
changed through the centuries, to compare critical views of a particular work, to present a
position on a current issue, and the like.
I can hear you moaning. I don’t blame you. As a writer and a teacher, I spend part of every
day on research. I’m always glad to learn something new, so the information I dig up isn’t the
problem. The path to that information, on the other hand, sometimes contains a few pot-
holes. A few basic skills, which I discuss in this section, smooth your way.
41
Chapter 3: Making the Grade in AP English Class

Knowing where to look
When I started my writing career, I zoomed from library to library by subway, borrowing
books and photocopying magazine articles in branches of the New York Public Library.
I peered at microfilm (be thankful that you’ll never have to know what microfilm is) and spent
days turning dusty pages of decades-old newspapers, sneezing all the while. Now when I have
a research project, I sit at the computer, bouncing from library to library without moving more
than my mouse-click finger. When I need a magazine or newspaper article, I find it online. Yes,
I still take books out of the library for research, but life has gotten much easier — in most
ways. The hard part of twenty-first-century research is the sheer volume of information avail-
able. So much is out there that you can drown in material very quickly. To make matters
worse, some of the stuff that pops up when you’re researching electronically is complete
drivel. Remember, anyone can set up a Web page and pretend to know something! 
The first task of a researcher, therefore, is to look in places that are likely to contain quality
material. Some suggestions:
 Electronic databases (JSTOR, Lexis-Nexis, Facts-on-File, and the like) provided by a
school or public library generally screen out subpar material. 
 Articles in nationally recognized periodicals (major newspapers such as The New York
Times and magazines such as Scientific American, for example) are reliable.
 The Internet Public Library (www.ipl.org) is a gateway to sources that have been
approved by experts in the field.
 Web sites with “edu” or “gov” in their URL (the site’s “Web address”) are generally
trustworthy. The first type comes from an educational institution, and the second from
the government. 
 Web sites maintained by nationally recognized organizations are usually okay. Many of
these contain “org” in their Web address. I say “usually” because some organizations
are nationally recognized because they hold crackpot views. Others are biased in favor
of certain points of view and may not report findings or publish articles that oppose
those views. When in doubt, ask your teacher or a librarian. These professionals will
help you evaluate various sources.
I should say a word about Wikipedia. Lots of good material has found its way into the
Wikipedia, the so-called “people’s encyclopedia,” which may be altered by Internet users
whether they know what they’re talking about or not. Wiki if you wish, but warily. Recheck
information you find there, if possible. 
Selecting search terms
Once you’ve got the sites (which may include a catalogue of paper-and-ink sources), how do
you find what you want? You search, carefully. Why carefully? Because too broad a search is
useless. Enter “climate” into a database and you’ll get thousands — even millions — of hits.
You have to narrow the search so the results are manageable. Most databases and library
catalogues break topics into subtopics. The general topic of climate, for example, yields a
hundred or so subtopics: “climate change,” “climate in the United Kingdom,” “climate as a
destroyer of picnic plans,” and so on. (Just kidding about that last one.) Electronic databases
usually have an advanced search button that brings up a screen allowing you to add some
search terms (“climate” and “warming,” for instance) and exclude others. If you’re research-
ing the effect of global warming on agriculture, you may search for “climate,” “warming,” and
“agriculture.” 
42
Part I: Preparation without Perspiration 

Can’t find what you’re looking for? Try another term. In the preceding example, substituting
“change” for “warming” may give you what you need.
Keeping track of sources
When you’re writing a paper based on research, it’s crucial to record where you found ideas
and information and to cite your sources in the final draft. (I explain how to cite sources in
Chapter 13.) If you present someone else’s stuff as your own, you commit the worst academic
crime — plagiarism. And in most schools, ignorance is no excuse for the law. Depending upon
your school’s policy, you may fail the assignment or the course or be suspended or expelled.
Scared? Don’t be. If you’re not sure what to cite or how to cite, your teacher will help. And
the best strategy is simple: When in doubt, ask. 
Keeping track of source material is easy. As you take notes, record this information:
 Author(s)
 Title (if it’s an article, include the article title and the name of the periodical)
 Publication date, place, and company
 Page number, if possible (articles on the Web may not have page numbers)
 URL or database of electronic sources and the date accessed
 Broadcast or release date (for television shows or films)
 Date of the interview or conversation (if your source is a person — and yes, you have
to cite your mom if she gave you an idea you include in your paper)
For a short paper, you may not bother to take notes and opt to work directly from the books
or articles covering your floor or from the Web sites saved under “favorites.” (You did book-
mark that great Web site, didn’t you?) Cut the time spent reviewing your sources by creating
a short “table of contents.” As you research, note the URL or title and author of the work on a
piece of paper or in a computer file. Add a phrase and a page number (if the pages are num-
bered) so that later you know what’s where. Here’s an example:
Kong, p. 3 – grabs blond
Kong, p. 122 – falls from Empire State Bldg.
43
Chapter 3: Making the Grade in AP English Class
Citizen Whats?
The College Board says that a goal of the AP English
Language and Composition course is to create “citizen
rhetors.” You’re probably wondering what a “rhetor” is.
Like much of our civilization, this concept traces its lin-
eage to ancient Greece. Citizens there were expected to
learn rhetoric, the art of expressing ideas clearly and
persuasively. They were also expected to use their
rhetorical skills to better society. Nowadays, the word
“rhetoric” is often paired with the adjective “empty,”
with the phrase “empty rhetoric” describing writing or
speeches that sound great but have no real content.
(Makes you think about the values of our society, doesn’t
it?) A citizen rhetor, in the classical and in the AP sense,
knows how to read and evaluate information, formulate
a point of view, and effectively deliver the point of view
to the audience or reader. 

Creating a table of contents goes even faster if you give each source a number. Then you’d
write “3, p. 3 – grabs blond” if your third source is entitled Kong. Keep a master list of
sources and the number you assigned to each.
The Eyes Have It: Visual Sources
Okay, I admit that English teachers are in love with words. But even English teachers (or at
least most of us) have come to understand that visual sources have a place in our classes.
A twenty-first-century citizen is bombarded with advertisements, illustrations, photos,
charts, and graphs — not to mention pop-ups on the computer. You should be able to inter-
pret this material when you run across it and to use it in conjunction with your own writing
whenever it’s relevant. I discuss visual sources as they appear on the AP English Language
and Composition exam in Chapter 8. Here I briefly explain how these sources show up in
your English class and how you can get the most out of them.
Your teacher may assign a visual source or a source that includes visuals. Some graphic auto-
biographies, for instance, have become staples of many English classes — Marjane Satrapi’s
Persepolis and Art Spiegelman’s Maus. Or you may wish to incorporate visual sources in a
research paper, particularly one that presents a point of view and doesn’t simply report
information. An assignment on a controversial issue, for example, may benefit from an analy-
sis of television commercials arguing one side or the other. 
When you encounter a visual source, keep these points in mind:
 Consider the whole. The entire source probably has an overall message or effect. Can
you restate that message in your own words? If not, the source probably isn’t helpful.
 Don’t neglect details. Small elements mean a lot. For example, a public service
announcement about body image begins with a shot of several girls walking across the
street. One lags behind and stares at the viewer. Next a series of clips from commer-
cials selling beauty products appears. The message is that parents should help their
daughters appreciate their own beauty and not be swayed by commercials telling girls
to be dissatisfied with their appearance. Many details in this sequence are effective.
One stands out in my mind: the girls are crossing the street. The visual suggests danger
(little kids are usually escorted across the street by adults) and sets up the idea that
protection is needed.
 Listen as well as look. Obviously you can’t listen to a chart or a still photo. But if
you’re working from an audio visual source such as the public service announcement
described in the preceding bullet point, the audio portion is also important. The image
of the girls in the public service announcement is accompanied by a Beatles’ song.
The line “here it comes” is repeated several times. The volume increases with each
repetition, adding a sense of urgency. The underlying message — get to your daughter
before the beauty industry does — is enhanced by the audio track.
 Interpret. Don’t stay on the surface. Dig for the significance of what you’re seeing. If
you see a chart of homicides, for example, think about what the chart tells you and
what the implications are. Is the crime rate increasing? Decreasing? Is the rate uniform
for all age groups or for all areas? 
Images must be cited in your source list, just as written material is. Presenting information of
any kind without crediting the source is a plagiarism.

In this part . . . 
M
uch of the AP English Language and Composition
exam concerns the English language, specifically
how authors use it when they’re working — in other words,
composing — a piece of writing. (Now you know how they
came up with the exam’s name!) This part doesn’t directly
address the questions on the exam, but it strengthens the
foundation of knowledge the questions rest upon.
In this part I take you on a guided tour of the tools writers
have at their disposal. In Chapter 4, I focus on individual
words or short phrases. Chapter 5 takes on sentence and
paragraph structure, as well as point of view and persona.
In Chapter 6, you meet the most important rhetorical
strategies — a fancy term describing the organization and
internal logic of an entire piece of writing. (Your English
teacher may use a different term instead of “strategies.”
No worries! Understanding them is much more important
than labeling them.) Chapter 7 addresses (don’t panic!)
grammar, which you need to know for the multiple-choice
portion of the exam and for your own writing in the essay
section. Finally, Chapter 8  helps you develop skills to
interpret the proverbial “thousand words” embedded in
every picture.

I
n David Ives’ play Words, Words, Words, the main characters are three monkeys equipped
with typewriters. They’re in an experiment to prove whether, given enough time, the
monkeys can reproduce Shakespeare’s Hamlet by tapping randomly on a keyboard.
Writing, of course, is far more than random taps. It’s also more than having a great idea,
though creativity is always an asset. Writing involves knowledge of rhetoric, the art of com-
municating clearly and persuasively. This chapter focuses on the smallest building blocks
of writing — words and phrases and the rhetorical techniques that apply to them. As you
analyze rhetoric, you improve your own writing and prepare yourself for the AP exam.
Going beyond the Dictionary:
Grasping Connotation 
If your word-processing program resembles mine, a couple of mouse clicks takes you to the
thesaurus, a handy reference that provides synonyms for any given word. But the thesaurus
works from dictionary definitions, so it usually deals only with the literal meaning, or denota-
tion, of words. Denotation is half the story; to wring every nuance from a word and the pas-
sage it appears in, you’ve got to pay attention to connotation also. Connotation is the term for
all the emotions and associations linked to a word.
To grasp the importance of connotation, examine these two statements. Which one would
you like to hear as you arrive home two hours past curfew?
Aren’t you resourceful! You found the key hidden under the doormat.
Aren’t you sneaky! You found the key hidden under the doormat.
The variables in the preceding sentences —“resourceful” and “sneaky” — are both synonyms
of “clever.” However, the first statement isn’t as likely to lead to two weeks’ house arrest as
the second, because “resourceful” has a positive connotation and “sneaky” a negative one.
Similarly, my dictionary reports that “bright” and “cunning” may also substitute for “clever.”
I’m sure you can imagine a “bright” student receiving an award at graduation, while a “cun-
ning” student gets 15 days of detention for hacking into the teachers’ e-mail accounts.

Knowing connotation is crucial to using a word correctly. When you learn vocabulary from a
list (not the best way to build vocabulary — see Chapter 3 for suggestions), you can’t always
distinguish one synonym from another. You end up calling someone “emaciated” when you
mean “slim” — a good way to lose a friend! (“Emaciated,” in case you’re interested, connotes
illness. “Slim” is what dieters aim for.)
Connotation is sometimes explained in the dictionary, but true understanding of connotation
generally comes when you encounter the word in context, especially if you run across it
several times. Thus, the reading you do for English class, your other courses, or your own
interest and entertainment helps you with connotation, as do everyday conversations with
literate people. (Speaking of definitions, I’m defining “literate” in this context as someone
who speaks or writes in an educated way. A pal who never says more than “Wassup, dude?”
doesn’t count, however much fun he is to be with.) 
If you’re not sure of the connotation of a particular word, substitute another. Does the mean-
ing shift? If so, you may have a clue to its connotation. For example, you can accurately call
me either “old” or “experienced.” I prefer the second term. In our youth-oriented media, “old”
carries baggage; it connotes something out-of-date, not vigorous or relevant. “Experienced,”
on the other hand, connotes wisdom. I’ll accept that label (whether I deserve it or not).
When you’re reading an AP passage, either for the multiple-choice or the essay portion of
the test, pay attention to connotation. Connotation is a tunnel to the deeper meaning of a
passage. For example, imagine you’re reading a paragraph about a “blameless” person.
“Blameless” removes any suggestion of guilt, but it doesn’t go beyond neutral territory.
There’s no blame, but there’s no nobility either. Perhaps the author is hedging; you have to
decide how well the “blameless” person behaved. Now imagine that you’re reading a para-
graph about a “worthy” person. Usually “worthy” shows up when someone merits apprecia-
tion, a reward, a promotion, or anything else that’s positive. The definition, or denotation, of
both “blameless” and “worthy” is decency, but the connotation of “worthy” distinguishes it
from “blameless.”
Are you up for a test-drive of connotation in an AP-like context? Take a look at this short
passage from Harriet Jacobs’ magnificent account of her escape from slavery, Incidents in the
Life of a Slave Girl, Written by Herself:
O, you happy free women, contrast your New Year’s day with that of the poor bondwoman!
With you it is a pleasant season, and the light of the day is blessed. Friendly wishes meet
you everywhere, and gifts are showered upon you. Even hearts that have been estranged
from you soften at this season, and lips that have been silent echo back, “I wish you a
happy New Year.” Children bring their little offerings, and raise their rosy lips for a caress.
They are your own, and no hand but that of death can take them from you.
Notice the word “estranged.” The dictionary reports that “estranged” means “separated.”
The connotation of “estranged,” however, adds an element of bad feeling. The word leans
towards “alienated” or “not on speaking terms,” whereas “separated” may refer to a purely
physical gap. You probably guessed this connotation because of the context, even if the word
wasn’t already in your vocabulary. Estranged hearts “soften at this season, and lips that have
been silent echo back, ‘I wish you a happy New Year.’” The message is clear: At holiday time
fences are mended. 
Now take a look at “showered,” also in the preceding passage from Jacobs’ book. Maybe
because human beings are dependent on water, “showered” always has a positive connota-
tion. You can be showered with gifts, as the “happy free women” are in this passage, but not
with sorrows. Sorrows, however, can “rain” down on someone. Maybe these differing conno-
tations arise from the way everyone reacts to showers (good for growing things) and rain
(flooding, bad hair, squishy shoes). Showers are also natural events; in Jacobs’ passage, the
word “showered” implies that it’s natural for “happy free women” to receive gifts.
48
Part II: The Writer’s Toolkit 

Connotation is helpful when you’re answering AP vocabulary-in-context questions. The
process works in two ways. If you know the connotation, the context is clearer. If you don’t
know the word (connotation or even denotation), the context may help you decipher it
anyway.
Listen up! Examining Diction, Tone, and Attitude
Diction is lit-speak for the words a writer chooses. You deal with diction when you analyze
a writer’s selection of the verb “demanded” instead of “begged” or “asked,” for example.
(Often, the choice of one word instead of another depends upon connotation. See the preced-
ing section for more information about connotation.) When you move beyond one word to
examine a pattern of word choices, you can characterize the diction as formal, informal,
straightforward, witty, ironic, or . . . well, you have a lot of possibilities! Tone — still another
English-teacher term — is a little more complicated to define. Tone expresses mood and atti-
tude (a stance in relation to a particular person or situation). Tone is created by the words
used (diction), the way they’re put together (syntax), and the content expressed. Attitude is
expressed through tone and content. In this section I give you guidelines for examining the
diction, tone, and attitude of any piece of writing, making questions about these elements a
piece of cake when you encounter them on the AP test.
Diction
Without knowing the term, you’re probably already clued in to diction. In fact, I’m betting
that you know how to adapt your own diction to circumstances. For instance, suppose
you’re talking with a teacher: “May I be excused?” you ask politely, adding that you “haven’t
yet completed the history research paper” he assigned. A moment later you’re talking with a
friend: “Gotta hit the library. I’m swamped by that history thing.” These two situations illus-
trate the shift in diction that people make automatically, everyday — in fact a hundred times
a day. The first exchange is an example of formal diction; the second illustrates colloquial, or
conversational diction. 
Close attention to diction pays off; the diction clues you in to subtleties of meaning, the
author’s purpose, and a host of other things. When you’re reading a passage on the AP, zero
in on any unusual words. Give an extra glance to the verbs and nouns, because these words
carry so much weight in writing. Look for patterns. Are all the words simple, or do you have
to eat a dictionary to get through the paragraph? Any slang? Also, consider other ways the
author might have said the same thing. Then try to determine how choices the author made
affect meaning. 
All right, it’s your turn to examine “diction-in-action,” which is not a new reality show. Take a
peek at these two passages and analyze the diction. Passage One is an excerpt from Richard
Henry Dana’s Two Years Before the Mast. Passage Two is drawn from Paul Volcker: The Making
of a Financial Legend by Joseph Treaster (Wiley, 2004; reprinted with permission of John
Wiley and Sons, Inc).
Passage One: This was a black day in our calendar. At seven o’clock in the morning, it
being our watch below, we were aroused from a sound sleep by the cry of “All hands
ahoy! a man overboard!’’ This unwonted cry sent a thrill through the heart of every one,
and, hurrying on deck, we found the vessel hove flat aback, with all her studding-sails
set. . . . The watch on deck were lowering away the quarter-boat, and I got on deck just
in time to fling myself into her as she was leaving the side; but it was not until out upon
the wide Pacific, in our little boat, that I knew whom we had lost. It was George Ballmer,
the young English sailor, whom I have before spoken of as the life of the crew.

Passage Two: Shortly after flying back to Washington from a conference in Tokyo on the
international oil crisis, Carter decided to address the nation on July 5, 1979. He spent
much of the Fourth of July at Camp David, the Presidential retreat in the Catoctin moun-
tains of Maryland, working on the speech. Late in the day he canceled the talk and
decided not to return to the White House. 
Can you see that the diction in Passage One is much more extreme than the diction in
Passage Two? Two is straightforward; the words convey little emotion. The verbs and nouns
(“decided,” “spent,” “nation,” “talk,” and so on) are plain vanilla. You can imagine hearing
Passage Two on the news or reading it in a textbook. Passage One has ornate diction, espe-
cially the verbs and nouns. The cry sent a “thrill” on a “black day.” The narrator doesn’t
jump into the boat, he “fling[s]” himself. Ballmer isn’t just popular; he’s the “life of the crew.”
This passage might show up on one of those breathless, historical re-enactment shows. 
Diction is related to the writer’s purpose. The purpose of Passage One is to bring the reader
into the experience, to convey the heartbreak of death at sea. The author of Passage Two
wants to impart information. The neutrality of the language leads me to believe that the
author wants readers to form their own judgments about Carter’s actions. 
Tone 
Tone probably came into your life when you first heard that classic command, “Don’t take
that tone with me, young lady (or young man).” You may not have understood what tone in
your own voice provoked the Authority Figure’s outburst, but I bet you caught the annoy-
ance in the response! Tone is obvious when you’re listening to a real person speak aloud. But
when all you have is text, the words used (diction) and the way the words are put together
(syntax) help you “hear” the words and determine tone. 
Context (and content) matters also. For example, imagine that you’re reading a passage
about a group of teenagers. Alexa tells her friend Sam that he aced a French test. Sam replies,
“Right.” If the passage reports that Sam studies less than a second a week and considers 
a D- an achievement, the word “right” is probably a wisecrack, and the tone is sarcastic. If
Sam’s been studying 25 hours a day, desperate to pass French, “right” may be a fist-pumped-
into-the-air statement of triumph.
Your turn to work on tone. Here’s another excerpt from Harriet Jacobs’ autobiography,
Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Written by Herself. (In case you’re skipping around, go back
to the section “Going beyond the Dictionary: Grasping Connotation,” where I placed another
passage from Jacobs’ writing. She’s worth the detour!) To catch the tone, zero in on diction
and content and anything else that catches your eye:
But to the slave mother New Year’s day comes laden with peculiar sorrows. She sits on
her cold cabin floor, watching the children who may all be torn from her the next morn-
ing; and often does she wish that she and they might die before the day dawns. She may
be an ignorant creature, degraded by the system that has brutalized her from childhood;
but she has a mother’s instincts, and is capable of feeling a mother’s agonies.
As you know, diction, syntax, and attitude are key ingredients of tone. First up is diction.
Check out “creature,” “degraded,” “brutalized,” and “instincts.” You can use “creature” to
refer to human beings, but more often it’s associated with animals. Slavery has treated this
mother as if she were an animal — one that’s “degraded” (pushed down) and “brutalized.”
This last word also connects to animals (which are sometimes called “brutes”). Also, animals
are said to operate mostly on “instincts.” When you add all these ideas together, you see that
Jacobs’ diction stresses the dehumanizing effects of slavery. Another significant word is
50
Part II: The Writer’s Toolkit 

“torn,” which adds an element of violence to her description of the slave mother’s situation.
Tearing isn’t a gentle act; Jacobs’ diction emphasizes the pain of an enslaved mother, whose
children may be “torn” from her at any moment. 
Syntax, the way words are put together grammatically, also matters here. I discuss syntax at
length in Chapter 5. Here I’ll just point out that “often does she wish” is an unusual pattern.
Because you expect to see “she often wishes,” the rearrangement highlights “often” and
emphasizes the slave mother’s constant desperation.
Last, consider content. The subject is a “mother,” and most people have strong reactions
to that status. Love her or hate her, she’s still a mother and by definition, connected to her
children. But this mother may lose her children, and she and they have been treated badly
(“brutalized”) all their lives. The mother considers death a blessing. By referring to the
system and not to a particular slave owner, Jacobs places blame on the institution of slavery,
not just on one cruel slave-owner. 
Add up the diction, syntax, and content. No doubt about it: Jacobs’ tone is critical and
passionate. 
Here’s one more passage that provides great tone-hunting material. It’s excerpted from a 
ninteenth-century book written by a missionary about his experiences with Native Americans.
Zero in on diction and content:
The iron horse rushes and shrieks where the Indian trail was once the only pathway.
The picturesque garb is fast disappearing, and store clothes, often too soon transformed
into rags anything but picturesque, have robbed the Indian of the interest that once
clung to him.
Though the excerpt is short, the content is easy to grasp. The author compares Native
American life before and after the railroad (the “iron horse”) arrived. The reference to “horse”
sets up a comparison, because real horses are associated with Native Americans. Diction,
too, leaps out at you when you read this passage: The verbs “rushes” and “shrieks” are both
extreme, so already the message is that something big has happened. A “shriek” also connotes
fear or pain. Non-Native Americans, who built and operate the railway, are associated with
those negative qualities, while Native Americans are linked to a simple word — “pathway.”
A “pathway” leads somewhere or gives you easier transit. It doesn’t “rush” and “shriek.”
Similarly, “picturesque” clothing is contrasted to “store clothes.” The “store clothes” turn
into “rags.” From this writer’s point of view, traditional is better.
Overall, how would you characterize the tone of this passage? The words are carefully
chosen; you can imagine them in a sermon (the writer’s a missionary) or a lecture. Also, the
writer isn’t neutral. He’s taking a rather extreme stand. I’d go for “formal” and “dramatic” or
even “nostalgic.” Also, the last few words of the passage comment that “store clothes . . .
have robbed the Indian of the interest that once clung to him.” Because those words depict
Native Americans as a kind of living tourist attraction, the passage takes a patronizing tone
at the end.
Tone isn’t always simple or uniform. As you see in the preceding example, a tone may shift or
may contain layers of meaning. The missionary expresses dismay at the changes in Native
American culture because of non-Native American influence, but the dismay is expressed in a
condescending way. Furthermore, some tone questions provide paired answers (“nostalgic
and patronizing,” for example). Be sure that both answers fit the passage before you make 
a choice.
51
Chapter 4: Words, Words, Words

Attitude
Once you know the tone, a tiny step takes you to the author’s attitude (what the author
believes or feels). In an issue-oriented passage, attitude shows up when the author or a
person mentioned in the passage is in favor of or against a particular position. 
Take a look at this excerpt from President John F. Kennedy’s inaugural address:
The world is very different now, for man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish
all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. And yet the same revolutionary
beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe — the belief
that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of
God. We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. 
Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has
been passed to a new generation of Americans, born in this century, tempered by war,
disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage and unwilling to
witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has
always been committed, and to which we are committed today, at home and around
the world.
Let every nation know — whether it wishes us well or ill — that we shall pay any price,
bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the
survival and the success of liberty. This much we pledge, and more.
Kennedy’s attitude comes at you like a trumpet blast: He’s in favor of human rights, and he’s
willing to use America’s power to secure those rights around the world.
In a multiple-choice question, you may be given a set of adjectives (“critical,” “sympathetic,”
“ambivalent,” and the like) to characterize the attitude of the author toward a defined issue.
Kennedy’s attitude, as expressed in the preceding excerpt, is “favorable” or even “militant” in
regard to human rights.
In a narrative or descriptive passage, the author has an attitude, as do any people or charac-
ters mentioned in the passage. The author’s attitude may be complex; he or she may be nos-
talgic when describing the setting and critical when depicting how people act there. You
determine attitude by comprehending the meaning (content) of the passage and by noticing
diction, tone, and other rhetorical devices. 
Here’s a short narrative paragraph from Samuel Pepys’ diary, written in the seventeenth 
century:
Thanksgiving-day for victory over the Dutch. To the Dolphin Tavern, where all we offi-
cers of the Navy met with the Commissioners of the Ordnance by agreement, and dined:
where good music at my direction. Our club come to 34 shillings a man, nine of us. By
water to Fox-hall, and there walked an hour alone, observing the several humors of the
citizens that were there this holy-day, pulling off cherries, and God knows what. This
day I informed myself that there died four of five at Westminster of the plague, in several
houses upon Sunday last, in Bell-Alley, over against the Palace-gate: yet people do think
that the number will be fewer in the town than it was the last week. 
Pepys’ attitude is patriotic, as is the attitude of the celebrants in the Dolphin Tavern — the
“officers of the Navy” who were dining and listening to “good music” on “Thanksgiving-day
for victory over the Dutch.” The citizens at “Fox-hall” are also celebrating, so it’s easy to put
them in the “anti-Dutch” column. Pepys reports that “people” have an optimistic attitude
toward the plague (“yet people do think that the number will be fewer in town than it was
the last week”). The word “yet” adds a hint of doubt; Pepys himself may not be quite so opti-
mistic as the “people” he mentions.

Connotation and diction lead you to tone, and tone takes you to attitude. Content, of course,
is related to all three rhetorical devices.
Figuring Out Figurative Language
Figurative language lives in the land of imagination. Poetry is chock-full of figurative language,
but nonfiction writers have passports to imagination-land also. (Not literal passports —
metaphorical ones. See? I’m writing nonfiction, and I can play around with language too.) You
probably know many elements of figurative language. If I listed all of the ways figurative lan-
guage shows up in writing, this section would be a hundred pages long. So I’ve limited myself
to the most common terms:
 Metaphor: An indirect comparison, written without “like” or “as.” The famous line from
Peanuts’ comic strip, “happiness is a warm puppy,” is a metaphor. An extended
metaphor (you’ll never guess!) keeps the metaphor going. For example, if I follow the
Peanuts’ statement with a paragraph about cuddling up with happiness and worrying
that happiness will dash away when the gate is open, I’m using an extended metaphor.
 Simile: A direct comparison, written with “like” or “as.” These similes describe the AP
English Language and Composition exam: it’s “as interesting as reading the phone
book,” “like watching paint dry,” and “like oozing brain cells.” (You’re really looking
forward to exam day now, aren’t you?)
 Metonymy: A substitute name, but not a nickname. Metonymy shows up when something
associated with a person substitutes for the name of the person, as in “a spokesman for
the Oval Office.” In that phrase, “Oval Office” subs for the name of the current president.
(As you know, the “Oval Office” is where the current American president works.)
 Synecdoche: Another substitute name. This time, the part represents the whole, as in
“the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world.” “Hand” subs for “mother.”
 Personification: A nonhuman picks up human qualities. The earth is personified in this
sentence: “The earth was my mother; I listen ever with my ear close to her lips.” 
 Allusion: A reference to a well-known work of art, pop culture, or history. The allusion
is brief, but all the feelings associated with the referenced element come into the
reader’s mind. If the student-council president ends a speech with a statement that stu-
dents are entitled to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of a five on the AP,” the president is
alluding to the Declaration of Independence, calling forth the spirit of rebellion embod-
ied in that document. The allusion implies that a good score on the AP is a basic
human right — not a sentiment I share!
 Hyperbole and understatement: Deliberately exaggerating and minimizing, generally
for a comic effect. If you have “a ton of papers to write” you’re using hyperbole.
If they announce your Nobel Prize and you respond, “Not bad,” you’re employing
understatement.
 Apostrophe: Yes, it’s a punctuation mark, but it’s also a literary term meaning an
address to an absent person or quality. “Dear Reader” and “O Melancholy” are exam-
ples of apostrophe.
Figurative language, like everything in the writer’s toolkit, works only when it goes hand-in-
hand with content. Good writers don’t drop a metaphor into a paragraph unless the
metaphor enhances meaning. When you’re reading AP-level literature, the figurative language
is there for a reason. Your job is not only to identify the figure of speech but also to analyze
its effect. 
53
Chapter 4: Words, Words, Words

Scrape the rust off your analysis skills and read this slice of an essay about Jonathan Swift.
Check out the figurative language, and think about their effect on the passage:
The war had transformed parties into factions, and the ministry stood between a Scylla
of a peace-at-any-price, on the one side, and a Charybdis of a war-at-any-price on the
other; or, if not a war, then a peace so one-sided that it would be almost impossible to
bring it about. In such troubled waters, and at such a critical juncture, it was given to
Swift to act as pilot to the ship of State. 
This small paragraph contains two examples of figurative language. First, the author makes
an allusion to Scylla and Charybdis, two monsters of Greek mythology that guarded the
narrow body of water between Italy and Sicily. Scylla had six heads and an appetite for
sailors; Charybdis was a whirlpool that sucked in ships. The allusion (if you know the myth)
explains how awful the pro- and antiwar factions were in Swift’s day; no choice was ideal, to
put it mildly. The description of Swift as a “pilot to the ship of State” is a metaphor that
works nicely with the allusion. By bringing in another nautical reference, the author illus-
trates how difficult Swift’s task was, because piloting a ship between Scylla and Charybdis
was no picnic (at least not for the sailors, though Scylla snacked well!). See what I mean
about figurative language and content working together? 
Here’s one more example paragraph designed to sharpen your figurative-language skills. This
beauty is from Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations. The narrator is a young boy named Pip
who is running from his home, carrying food and wine he stole. Can you identify the similes
and what they contribute to the passage? 
I had seen the damp lying on the outside of my little window, as if some goblin had been
crying there all night, and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief. Now, I saw the
damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a coarser sort of spiders’ webs;
hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade. On every rail and gate, wet lay
clammy; and the marsh-mist was so thick, that the wooden finger on the post directing
people to our village — a direction which they never accepted, for they never came
there — was invisible to me until I was quite close under it. Then, as I looked up at it,
while it dripped, it seemed to my oppressed conscience like a phantom devoting me to
the Hulks [prison ships].
The first simile is “as if some goblin had been crying there all night.” A goblin is a magical,
dangerous creature. Little children are especially susceptible to magical thinking, so this
simile emphasizes Pip’s youth. The goblin was “crying there all night.” Pip’s sad too, as read-
ers know from earlier chapters of the novel. But even without reading other parts of Great
Expectations, the simile gives an idea of Pip’s mood. The next simile — “like a coarser sort of
spiders’ webs” — echoes the trapped situation of the narrator. Spiders catch prey in their
webs, and Pip is afraid that he too will be caught. The final simile is “like a phantom devoting
me to the Hulks.” Pip says his conscience is “oppressed,” or guilty. The simile mentions
prison ships. The guilt Pip feels is strong enough to merit imprisonment.
Identifying figurative language isn’t worth the time it takes to say “metaphor” unless you
associate this rhetorical device with meaning, as I’ve done in the preceding paragraph.
Identifying Imagery
The best writers (and everything you read for the AP comes from the best) are open to the
world. No matter how dry the material, great writers observe carefully and later tuck some of
that observation — imagery, in literary terminology — into their work. Just to be clear, when
I talk about imagery, I mean sensory information. Imagery includes description of sights,
54
Part II: The Writer’s Toolkit 

sounds, smells, tastes, and feelings (the kind you get through your skin, not emotions).
These concrete details call upon everything you’ve experienced through your physical body.
Imagery overlaps with figurative language (metaphors, similes, and other rhetorical devices I
discuss in the preceding section). Any figure of speech that appeals to the senses may prop-
erly be called “imagery.” 
Time to examine imagery. Check out this excerpt from an account of an Alaskan cruise:
On the upper deck, a lady, clad in warm cloak and thick veil, walked tirelessly to and fro.
A big stump-tailed dog of the Malamute tribe at times followed at her heels, but when
she had patted his head and spoken kindly to him he appeared satisfied, and lay down
again with his head between his paws. Then sounds from the dancers below, the shrill
laughter of the women mingled with the strum of the banjo and the wheezy accordion,
seemed to disturb the dog’s slumber, and he would again pace up and down at the lady’s
heels. At times there would come a lull in the tumult, and the click of the glasses or
crash of a fallen pitcher would make a variety of entertainment for the lady and her dog
on the upper deck; but the short and dusky midnight was well passed before the danc-
ing ceased and partial quiet and order were restored.
The entire passage presents visual imagery, including the lady “in a warm cloak and thick
veil” who “walked tirelessly to and fro.” You see her pat his head, the dog asleep “with his
head between his paws,” and “short and dusky midnight” pass. The paragraph is also filled
with sounds: “shrill laughter,” “the strum of the banjo,” “wheezy accordion,” a “lull,” the
“click of the glasses,” and the “crash” of the pitcher, followed by “partial quiet.” The sense
of touch is also represented by the “warm cloak,” because you sense temperature through
your skin. 
Because the author of this travelogue is a good writer, imagery contributes to her meaning.
You see the lady and wonder about her solitude and restlessness. You experience her link
with the dog, who — unlike her — can rest at times. The sounds are all distant, emphasizing
that the lady is alone. Everyone else (“the dancers below”) seems to be having a good time
(though “shrill” laughter may indicate forced merriment). The “warm cloak and thick veil”
also separates the lady from others. She’s wrapped in her own world, perhaps protected
from the weather and from something else as well. As you see, the author zeroed in on
details that convey mood and character — exactly the job of imagery.
Try your imagery-analysis skills on another travel memoir, this time Charles Dickens’
account of his voyage to America. Note what you see, hear, smell, taste, and feel. (Of course,
all five senses may not be present in every passage.)
The gloom through which the great black mass holds its direct and certain course; the
rushing water . . . the men on the look-out forward, who would be scarcely visible
against the dark sky, but for their blotting out some score of glistening stars; the helms-
man at the wheel, with the illuminated card before him, shining, a speck of light amidst
the darkness, like something sentient and of Divine intelligence; the melancholy sighing
of the wind through block, and rope, and chain; the gleaming forth of light from every
crevice, nook, and tiny piece of glass about the decks, as though the ship were filled
with fire in hiding, ready to burst through any outlet, wild with its resistless power of
death and ruin. . . . My own two hands, and feet likewise, being very cold, however, on
this particular occasion, I crept below at midnight. It was not exactly comfortable below.
It was decidedly close; and it was impossible to be unconscious of the presence of that
extraordinary compound of strange smells, which is to be found nowhere but on board
ship, and which is such a subtle perfume that it seems to enter at every pore of the skin,
and whisper of the hold [interior of the ship]. 
55
Chapter 4: Words, Words, Words

Did you note the “gloom,” the “great black mass” of the ship surrounded by “rushing water,”
the lantern that’s only “a speck of light” in the darkness where “some score of glistening
stars” were blotted out? All this imagery is visual. Did you pay attention to the “sighing of the
wind” and Dickens’ “very cold” hands and feet? Those phrases stem from the senses of hear-
ing and touch. The sense of smell is in this paragraph also, in the description of the atmos-
phere inside the ship, where “strange smells” get into your pores. 
Dickens’ imagery conveys his mood. Outside, Dickens is “filled with fire in hiding” which may
“burst . . . wild.” Inside, the air is “close.” In this context, “close” refers to stale air, a meaning
reinforced by the statement about the smells that “whisper” into your skin. You don’t have to
think long before you realize that Dickens’ imagery illustrates how trapped he feels when
he’s inside the ship and how much energy and “fire” he has inside himself, just waiting to get
out. Overall, Dickens’ imagery creates a sense of sadness. Just look at the “gloom” and
“melancholy,” as well as the “cold” and the tininess of the “speck of light” in contrast to the
“great black mass.” 
When you’re reading, and especially when you’re analyzing a work of literature for the AP, be
attentive to imagery. Don’t just notice its presence; concentrate on its effect on the meaning
of the work. Besides mood, imagery may also reveal attitude, characterization, and other ele-
ments of a work of literature.

ave you ever seen cotton candy made? That delicate process, in which a thread of
sugar as thin as air whirls onto a stick, has always reminded me of writing. The candy
emerges bit by bit, much like my own sentences. And when the stick is full, the candy-maker
breaks the thread and starts a new stick, in the same way I finish one paragraph and start
another. I can only hope that my writing goes down as easily and as sweetly as a cotton
candy treat. 
In this chapter I put sentences and paragraphs under a microscope, examining — and show-
ing you how to examine — the way they’re made. I demystify the way words fit together
grammatically and discuss various sentence types and patterns. In this chapter I also show
you the most common paragraph structures. I also briefly peer through a wide-angle lens
so that you can analyze point of view and persona, rhetorical devices that may appear in a
passage. So grab some candy (for energy!), and read on.
Unlocking the Secret of Syntax
Syntax sounds like the extra dollars the government tacks onto the price of cigarettes or
alcohol. That revenue is popularly known as “sin tax” because it comes from smoking and
drinking. Syntax is far more boring and much less controversial than its sound-alike relative.
As a matter of fact, I can’t imagine anything more boring than the grammatical relationship
of words to each other — the real definition of syntax. Despite the boredom factor, the ability
to unravel syntax is incredibly useful on the AP exam, where it’s questioned in both multiple-
choice and essay format. An understanding of syntax also strengthens your own writing,
especially when you grasp common sentence patterns and what happens to meaning when
sentences diverge from the norm. 
Note: In this section I use some basic grammar terminology. If formal grammar instruction
has made only a cameo appearance in the story of your life, turn to Chapter 7 for a review.

Sentence patterns and variations
When you were little, you may have played a game called “Duck Duck Goose.” Children sit
in a circle while one runs outside, tapping one child after another on the head and saying,
“Duck” — and then suddenly tapping someone as the “goose.” The point of this game isn’t
the duck-duck pattern, it’s the goose pattern-break. The variation catches everyone’s atten-
tion. I mention this childhood game because writers play “Duck Duck Goose” with their sen-
tences. Things flow along in one pattern, and then boom! Something new happens, the reader
perks up, and the content of the “goose” sentence lights up like a sign in Times Square. 
Subject-verb-complement: The norm
Nearly every English sentence has a subject-verb-complement configuration at its core.
Think of these S-V-C sentences as the “duck duck” of the game I described above:
Eleanor smacked Tracy. (verb – smacked, subject – Eleanor, complement – Tracy)
Tracy was annoyed. (verb – was, subject – Tracy, complement – annoyed)
Tracy is also a police officer. (verb – is, subject – Tracy, complement – police officer)
If the sentence asks a question, the common pattern places the subject between two parts of
the verb:
When will Eleanor finish her jail term? (verb – will finish, subject – Eleanor,
complement – jail term)
Of course, sentences may be much more complicated than I’ve illustrated here. You can throw
in all sorts of things — descriptions, extra explanations, qualifiers, and a ton of other stuff
that you don’t need to know the official grammatical name of. However, even long-winded
sentences almost always have a subject-verb-complement skeleton or the standard question
pattern. (Complements, by the way, aren’t essential, but they’re present most of the time.)
Shifting things around: Unusual sentence patterns
Now that you’ve seen ordinary “duck duck” sentences, it’s time for some “goose.” Check out
these sentences, written in unusual word order:
Through the entire parole hearing with a smile on her face sat Eleanor. (verb – sat,
subject – Eleanor, no complement)
An amazing account of her jail experience wrote Eleanor. (verb – wrote, subject –
Eleanor, complement – account)
Tracy hated the book, did she not? (First part: verb – hated, subject – Tracy,
complement – book. Second part: verb – did, subject – she, no complement)
The effect of changing the usual sentence pattern is small but significant. In the first sentence
the focus is on the description of Eleanor (“Through the entire parole hearing with a smile on
her face”) because the description is the first thing you see. The middle sentence is similar,
but in the opening, attention-getting spot, it has a complement as well as descriptions (“An
amazing account of her jail experience”). The last sentence begins normally and then veers
into question territory. The second half is almost a sneak attack, striking an accusatory tone. 
58
Part II: The Writer’s Toolkit 

Another variation of the normal sentence pattern starts off with a word that looks like a verb
(because it expresses action or being) but acts like a description. The grammar term for this
hybrid is verbal. You don’t need to know that term for the AP or for any aspect of your life
whatsoever, but you should know how verbals function. Here are two examples:
Appealing to the judge, Tracy requested a share in the profits. (verbal – appealing to
the judge, verb – requested, subject – Tracy, complement – share)
To achieve closure, Eleanor offered 10 percent. (verbal – to achieve closure, verb –
offered, subject – Eleanor, complement – 10 percent)
As you see, the descriptive verb forms (“appealing” and “to achieve”) catch your attention by
virtue of their location. Extra attention brings a sense of importance to the act of “appealing”
in the first example and to the reason why Eleanor offered 10 percent (“to achieve closure”). 
When you’re analyzing an AP passage, remember that variety is not just the spice of life; it’s
also a spotlight. Also, insert these elements into your own writing to make your sentences
less monotonous and to showcase important ideas.
Periodic and loose sentences
A complex sentence contains at least two ideas. The main idea usually shows up in an inde-
pendent clause, a subject-verb expression that makes sense all by itself. Another idea turns
up in a dependent, or subordinate, clause — a subject-verb expression that isn’t complete in
and of itself. A periodic sentence starts with a dependent clause and goes on to the main idea.
59
Chapter 5: The Bigger Picture: Analyzing Sentences and Paragraphs
Sentence patterns of the rich and famous
Most great writers have distinctive sentence patterns
that can be identified easily. Jane Austen — one of my
favorites — likes to start out in one direction and then
hang a quick U-turn. Two of her gems:
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too
clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. 
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from
Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young
ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or
four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliner’s shop just over the way. 
See the pattern? Austen starts out with a statement that
sounds positive. “Lady Lucas was a very good kind of
woman” and “the young ladies . . . were tempted thither
three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their
aunt.” Just when you’re settling in for something sweet,
Austen hits you with the bad stuff: Lady Lucas was “not
too clever” to outshine the dumb Mrs. Bennet, and the
“young ladies” were actually shopping for hats at the
milliner’s. The U-turn pattern heightens the humor and
also underlines Austen’s message, that things are not
always what they seem.
You can also recognize an Ernest Hemingway sentence
from a mile away. Here’s a tiny bit of his story, “A Clean,
Well-Lighted Place”:
They sat together at a table that was close against
the wall near the door of the cafe and looked at the
terrace where the tables were all empty except
where the old man sat in the shadow of the leaves of
the tree that moved slightly in the wind. A girl and a
soldier went by in the street. The street light shone
on the brass number on his collar. The girl wore no
head covering and hurried beside him.
Hemingway’s pattern is to hit you with a long sentence
and then send a couple of short ones your way. (Think of
this pattern as “blahblahblahblah BLAH BLAH.” This con-
figuration places extra emphasis on the short sentences.

A loose sentence is the exact opposite: The main idea comes first, followed by dependent or
subordinate clauses. (For a refresher on grammar terms, turn to Chapter 7.)
Confession time: I always thought these two terms — periodic sentences and loose sentences —
were completely unnecessary until I saw them in some sample AP questions. Then I paid atten-
tion! I also started making jokes about the names. Have you heard the one about a sentence
that was locked in the attic until it got loose? Fortunately, it’s easier to recognize a periodic or
a loose sentence than it is to make a good joke about one. Look at these periodic and loose
sentences:
When Tracy’s royalty check arrived, she bought Yankee tickets. (periodic)
The Yankees were in first place when Tracy attended a game. (loose)
Although she has always been a Cubs fan, Eleanor watched the game on television.
(periodic)
Eleanor watched until Tracy smacked Derek Jeter. (loose)
Why should you care whether a sentence is periodic, loose, tight, orange, upside down, or
whatever? Because in a carefully crafted work, the pattern affects perception of meaning. In a
periodic sentence, you have to wait for the main act. You’re getting some information, but you
have a sense that after a couple of taps, a punch is coming. In a loose sentence, the opposite
is true. You know the main idea right away, but you stick around for some extra information.
In both periodic and loose sentences, the most important statement nearly always resides in
the independent clause, and less important information in dependent clauses unless the
writer is purposely reversing the pattern for comic effect, as in this example:
While the mushroom cloud ended life on earth as we know it, Felix was shaving.
Because the important information is in a dependent clause instead of in its usual place (the
independent clause), Felix comes across as clueless, apathetic, pathetic, or all of the above.
Here’s a trick to help you remember the difference between a periodic and a loose sentence:
in a periodic sentence, you have to wait for a period of time before learning the main idea —
unless the author’s reversed the usual order, as I explained above. In a loose sentence, you
can loosen up right away because you know the main idea immediately.
You may see one or two multiple-choice questions about periodic or loose sentences on the
AP exam. Usually these terms show up in the answer choices. If you’re writing an analysis
essay (see Chapter 16 for more information), you may mention periodic or loose sentences
if — and only if — you relate these patterns to meaning. 
Parallelism
Parallelism is the principle that brings unity and balance to a sentence. Elements of a sen-
tence are parallel if they have the same grammatical identity (all nouns, perhaps, or all
subject-verb combinations) and if they all perform the same function. Sentences are parallel
if they’re constructed with the same syntax.
A great example of a parallel sentence is the famous opening of Charles Dickens’ A Tale of
Two Cities:
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age
of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season
of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of

despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct
to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way — in short, the period was so far like the
present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for
good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
If you inhale a bushel of oxygen and read that sentence aloud, you immediately hear the par-
allel elements. All those “it was ______” and “we had _____” clauses are balanced. In other
words, they’re parallel. The parallel elements place everything on the same level of impor-
tance. It wasn’t “the best of times” except for a few snags. Nor was it “the worst of times”
with a few redeeming features. It was both, equally. And “we” are filled in the same measure
with hope and despair, goodness and evil. These qualities are unified by parallelism, and the
sentence structure deems them equal in measure and importance.
Care to pick up even more English-teacher terminology? Besides being a prime example of
parallelism, the Dickens’ sentence expresses a paradox — something that appears to contra-
dict itself. It’s also an example of antithesis — a rhetorical device in which opposites are
expressed in parallel elements. 
Try your hand at some rhetorical analysis. Here’s a passage from President John F. Kennedy’s
inaugural address. Note: Kennedy took office in 1961, during the Cold War. The expression
“both sides” in the passage refers to the United States and the Soviet Union. Can you find the
parallelism and determine its effect on meaning?
So let us begin anew, remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness,
and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us
never fear to negotiate. Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of bela-
boring those problems which divide us. Let both sides, for the first time, formulate seri-
ous and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms and bring the absolute
power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations. Let both sides
seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors. Together let us explore the
stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage the
arts and commerce. Let both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the com-
mand of Isaiah to “undo the heavy burdens, let the oppressed go free.”
Kennedy’s “let us . . . verb” sentences are parallel, and they reinforce his message: that both
sides must act. The “let us” sentences place equal weight on their contents: a new start,
negotiation, exploration of problems, formulation of solutions, scientific exploration and
research, and freedom for the oppressed. Kennedy had a big agenda, strongly expressed.
The parallelism of the long sentence (“Together let us explore . . . commerce”) hammers
home the message: Don’t pick only the agenda items you like. Everything on his list must be
addressed with the same intensity.
Kennedy’s famous statement from the same speech, “Ask not what your country can do for
you — ask what you can do for your country” is an example of inverted parallelism, also
known as chiasmus. The two “ask” statements mirror each other, but they express opposite
ideas — selfishness and selfless patriotism. You don’t have to know the literary terms, but
you should be able to point out their effect, which is to show the listener or reader two con-
trasting paths, one of which is clearly better. Chiasmus, by the way, comes from the Greek
word for cross. If you picture a cross (+), you literally see several possible paths, as at a
crossroads. The content and structure of Kennedy’s statement reinforce each other! 
Parallelism is such an important rhetorical technique that faulty parallelism — a sentence that
aims for parallel but falls short — is a grammar error that detracts from your writing. If you
have a list of items, be sure that everything on the list has the same grammatical identity. (If
grammatical identity is a mystery to you, turn to Chapter 7 for help.)

Chapter 5: The Bigger Picture: Analyzing Sentences and Paragraphs

(Para)graphing without a Calculator
Most paragraphs are organized around the placement of a topic sentence, which states the
main idea of the paragraph. The topic sentence may be anywhere, but most often it’s the first
or second sentence. The second most common placement is last, with “middle” occurring
only rarely. Some paragraphs, such as those containing dialogue, description, or narration,
don’t have topic sentences. Dialogue is divided by speaker; every time the speaker changes,
the paragraph breaks, so no topic sentence is necessary (or appropriate). Descriptive para-
graphs may list details in spatial order, moving from left to right or from up to down, and so
on, without an “overview” topic sentence. Narrative paragraphs usually follow chronological
order; they too frequently lack a topic sentence summing up the action. 
Locating the topic sentence and understanding the way in which information is organized
around it comes in handy on the AP. The exam graders expect to see well-organized para-
graphs in your essay. Also, the exam makers place questions about paragraph structure in
the multiple-choice section.
Topic sentence first
Paragraphs that explain (expository paragraphs) and paragraphs that present an argument
almost always begin with a topic sentence. So do some narrative or descriptive paragraphs. 
Here’s an example of a topic-sentence-first pattern. This paragraph comes from Cecilia
Cleveland’s memoir, The Story of a Summer:
The little play-house, that has since been removed to the croquet-ground, once stood
not far from this rock, and has been used, as I said, by Gabrielle as a menagerie for her
pets. A strange assortment they often were for a little girl. Inheriting her mother’s exqui-
site tenderness of feeling towards helpless animals, Gabrielle would splinter and band-
age up the little legs of any baby robin or sparrow that had met with an accident from
trying its wings too early, would nurse it till well, and then let it fly away. At one time she
had in the play-house a little regiment of twelve toads, a red squirrel, and a large turtle.
Aunt Mary never wished her to cage her pets, as she thought it cruel; consequently they
had the range of the play-house, and Gabrielle fed them very conscientiously. She ought,
however, to have followed the example of St. Francis, who used to preach to animals and

Punctuation matters
When you’re analyzing an AP sentence or when you’re
writing an essay, pay attention to punctuation. Two
common punctuation marks, the semicolon and the
colon, have a role in sentence patterns. A semicolon (;)
links two independent clauses that are closely related in
meaning. This punctuation mark, according to science
writer Lewis Thomas, is a bench that you can rest on
when you’re climbing up a hill. Because a semicolon is a
pause but not a stop, it should never be inserted between
ideas that don’t connect in an obvious way. For instance,
it’s fine to link “it was raining” and “the picnic was post-
poned” with a semicolon because the reader can see the
cause-and-effect relationship. However, “it was raining”
shouldn’t be joined to “I may study archaeology” with a
semicolon (or with anything else, for that matter) because
the statements have nothing in common.
A colon (:) often introduces a list, but it can also join two
independent clauses when the second is an explanation
of the first, as in “Joshua studied far too intensely for his
AP English Language test: He spent two weeks alone
with nothing but an English book and a coffee pot.” The
second independent clause, the one that follows the
colon, always begins with a capital letter.

insects when he had no human audience, and given her pets a daily dissertation upon
brotherly love and tolerance, for they did not, I regret to say, live together in the
Christian harmony that distinguished Barnum’s Happy Family. The result was, that one
day when Gabrielle went to minister to their physical wants, she found only a melan-
choly débris of little legs. Her supposition was that the turtle had consumed the toads
and then died of dyspepsia, and that the squirrel had by some unknown means escaped
from the play-house, and returned to primeval liberty.
The topic sentence of this expository paragraph (“The little play-house . . . for her pets”)
immediately orients the reader to the content of the paragraph. You know right away what
you’re going to hear about — Gabrielle’s “menagerie” (zoo). Everything that comes after
that first sentence simply piles on the detail — how Gabrielle played nurse to her animals,
what kind of animals were there, how some of the animals ate each other, that the turtle
died, and so forth.
You may also see these patterns in a topic-first paragraph:
 The topic sentence asserts an arguable point (“Parakeets are great pets”). The rest
of the paragraph supports the point (“Parakeets can learn to talk, they’re very friendly,
their food is cheap,” and the like).
 The topic sentence defines a process (“Parakeet training is only possible when the
bird trusts you”). The rest of the paragraph lists further steps in the process (“First,
place your hand in the cage. Next, touch the bird’s foot,” and so on.)
 The topic sentence explains an event (“My pet laid an egg”). Succeeding sentences
describe parts of the main event (“She refused to sit on the egg, I put the egg in an
incubator, the egg didn’t hatch,” etc.).
 The topic sentence starts with a general description (“The cage was quite luxurious”).
Subsequent sentences add detail (“Six carved perches rested on the left side,” “the back
wall was mirrored,” and so forth).
 The topic sentence defines a situation (“My parakeets like table scraps”). The rest of
the paragraph gives examples: one nibbled at pizza, another loved tuna fish, my cur-
rent bird is crazy about lettuce, and the like. Note: The examples I give here are true,
but don’t attempt to feed your pets table scraps without a vet’s approval!

The One and Only: Single sentence paragraphs
I admit it: I play with paragraphs.
My colleagues in the math department have a lot of fun
fooling around with graphing calculators. They tap in a
bunch of numbers and a nanosecond later, a nifty curve
or a spiky line appears on their little screens. In English
class I never have the opportunity to draw graphs, so I
find other sources of fun. As I said, I play with paragraphs.
Most paragraphs are several sentences long, though
James Joyce, the celebrated Irish writer, has a few mul-
tipage paragraphs that take an hour to decipher, and
Frenchman Marcel Proust has some paragraphs in
Remembrance of Things Past that could swallow an
entire afternoon. When anything breaks the humdrum,
see-it-every-day pattern, a small explosion takes place
in the reader’s mind. For example, were you surprised by
the one-sentence paragraph that opens this section?
The only way to place more attention on a sentence
would be to outline it in green stripes. 
Now that you know the power of single-sentence para-
graphs, you may be tempted to throw one onto every
page of your essays. In the case of single-sentence
paragraphs, however, a little goes a long way. Don’t
overuse this device!

Topic sentence in the middle
A topic sentence plopped into the middle of a paragraph is rare, but many writers use this
pattern with great success, usually to build suspense or to signal a shift of some sort. Can
you find the topic sentence and determine its role in the following paragraph, an excerpt
from a memoir?
I have said that I used to lie. I recall no particular occasion when a lie was the cause of
my disgrace; but I know that it was always my habit, when I had some trifling adventure
to report, to garnish it up with so much detail and circumstance that nobody who had
witnessed my small affair could have recognized it as the same, had I not insisted on my
version with such fervid conviction. The truth is that everything that happened to me
really loomed great and shone splendid in my eyes, and I could not, except by conscious
effort, reduce my visions to their actual shapes and colors. If I saw a pair of geese lead-
ing about a lazy goose girl, they went through all sorts of antics before my eyes that fat
geese are not known to indulge in. If I met poor Blind Munye with a frown on his face,
I thought that a cloud of wrath overspread his countenance; and I ran home to relate,
panting, how narrowly I had escaped his fury. 
The topic sentence, as you probably figured out, is “The truth is that everything that hap-
pened to me really loomed great and shone splendid in my eyes, and I could not, except by
conscious effort, reduce my visions to their actual shapes and colors.” This topic sentence
perfectly describes the temperament of a writer; everything’s exaggerated because that’s
how Mary Antin, the author, viewed life. Now examine the paragraph further. Preceding the
topic sentence are a series of generalizations about her “habit” of adding “detail and circum-
stance” to her experiences. Following the topic sentence are two examples of Antin’s exag-
geration: the geese and their “goose girl” and a blind man who was frowning. The topic
sentence marks a shift between general and specific.
When you start a “middle-topic-sentence” paragraph, you may be a little unsure about the
direction the author’s taking you. You may pass right over the topic sentence and only real-
ize where it was when you reach the end of the paragraph. When you’re in that situation, ask
yourself why the author kept you in suspense. The answer to that question tells you a lot
about the author’s purpose — often a question in the AP multiple-choice section. For exam-
ple, Antin’s paragraph is designed to win you over. Lying is usually considered a moral flaw,
and Antin herself calls it a “disgrace.” Having established that she lies and understands the
immorality of her actions, Antin goes on to justify them by explaining that she couldn’t
“reduce [her] visions to their actual shapes and colors.” Had she begun with that statement,
the reader would probably find it easier to dismiss her. But once she’s got you on her side,
she can hit you with her main point. Then she can continue with her life story, including the
exaggerated presence of the goose girl and “Blind Munye.”
A topic-sentence-in-the-middle paragraph may also have these characteristics:
 Preceding the topic sentence may be a series of examples. The topic sentence begins
a reflection on those examples or an explanation of their significance. (This pattern is
the reverse of the one you saw in Mary Antin’s comments on lying, in the preceding
sample paragraph.)
 The topic sentence may mark a shift from cause to effect. The paragraph begins
with a description of some event or circumstances. Following the topic sentence is a
description of the outcome of the event or reaction to the circumstances. 
 The paragraph may present a problem and its solution. The topic sentence links
the two.

Part II: The Writer’s Toolkit 

Topic sentence at the end
Hitting you hard just before leaving . . . no, I’m not talking about your awful cousins’
Thanksgiving visit. I’m talking about the kind of paragraph that ends with the main idea, a
“topic-sentence-ending” paragraph.
Check out this slice from Joseph B. Treaster’s Paul Volcker: The Making of a Financial Legend
by Joseph B. Treaster (Wiley, 2004; reprinted with permission of John Wiley and Sons, Inc.).
Just before this paragraph, the author describes a financial downturn during the Carter pres-
idency. Readers learn that President Jimmy Carter asked for, and received, resignations from
his cabinet and how he went about replacing some of these officials. Just after this paragraph
is a discussion of Paul Volcker’s appointment to the position of Chair of the Federal Reserve.
Now examine the last sentence. Can you see its role in the paragraph?
[President] Carter first turned to David Rockefeller, the chairman of Chase Manhattan
Bank. When Rockefeller declined, Carter approached A.W. Clausen, the chairman of the
Bank of America. Clausen also said no. Finally, Carter contacted Miller, who was in San
Francisco making a speech. While finance professionals had criticized Miller, the head of
the supposedly apolitical Federal Reserve, as being too sensitive to the needs of the
White House and too much of a team player, the Carter administration saw those quali-
ties as virtues. When Carter asked Miller to take charge of Treasury, he did not hesitate.
Now Carter had an opening at the Fed [the Federal Reserve].
Even without my explanation of what comes before and what follows this paragraph, how-
ever, you can see that the paragraph builds, step by step, to the last line. First you hear that
Rockefeller declined the position. Next, you learn that A. W. Clausen said no. Now you’re
with Miller, whose faults and/or advantages (depending upon your point of view) are listed.
Lastly, you find out that Miller took the job, and — the punch line — that Miller’s position
gave Carter an opening at the Fed. The last sentence gives meaning to everything else in the
paragraph. 
A topic-sentence-ending paragraph has these qualities:
 It builds to a climax.
 It leaves the reader with a strong main idea, perhaps preparing the reader for the 
information that is yet to come.
 It may take the reader through a process or on a logical path. Because the reader has
traveled with the author, the situation or issue is clear.
AP questions about this kind of paragraph often ask you the function of the sentences at the
beginning of the paragraph. The answer, one of the multiple-choice options, is something like
“to explain the opening at the Fed” (in the case of the preceding example) or “to describe 
the situation leading to _______” (with a few words from the topic sentence in the blank).
Transitions
Before I leave the topic of paragraphs, I should say a word about transitions. The sentence
you just read, by the way, is a transition. I’ve been talking about paragraphs, I will be talking
about transitions, and this sentence mentions both. It forms a link in the chain between one
paragraph and another.
65
Chapter 5: The Bigger Picture: Analyzing Sentences and Paragraphs

When you read AP passages (or anything else), transitions help you tag along with the author.
Transitions resemble one of those talking global positioning systems. You hear, “Turn left at
the next light.” The driver (the author) turns left, and the passenger is ready for the new direc-
tion because the GPS (the transition) has given advance notice.
Transitions may be single words or, like the sentence at the beginning of this section, they
may be multiple-word comments about what has gone before and what is about to appear.
Regardless of length, they play an important role in the logical structure of the paragraph
and of the piece as a whole. Here are some of the most common words or phrases used as
transitions, as well as their role. Keep an eye out for them!
 Chronological (time order): before, after, since, while, during, along with, even as, still,
continuing, going on, then.
 Cause and effect: because, therefore, thus, hence, consequently, as a result of, so that,
in order to.
 Contrast or change of idea: nevertheless, by contrast, in comparison, on the other
hand, opposing, rebutting, disagreeing, yet, however.
 Continuing with the same idea: also, further, furthermore, moreover, as well as, in
addition to, not only/but also, too.
Transitions are important in your own writing too. (Notice the transitional word, “too”? I’m
continuing the same topic.) Your AP exam grader expects to see a logical structure in your
free responses. Transitional words help the grader follow your logic.
Seeing the Author’s Point of View
In English-teacher land, point of view has two separate but equally important meanings. Point
of view may refer to the way a passage is written (using “I” or “we” or talking about a subject
impersonally). The same term applies to the ideas held by the author or by people or charac-
ters in the work. In this section I show you both roles in action.
Writing style
Pronouns are the easiest way to get a handle on point of view, when the term refers to writing
style. 
First-person point of view
First-person point of view is the “I-me-my” or “we-us-our” point of view. In this book, I’ve been
using first person freely, injecting myself into almost every paragraph. I have lots of com-
pany; many memoirs, autobiographies, letters, speeches, and fictional works are written in
first person. First-person point of view has several effects on the reader:
 It’s very personal. Only one person can say “I” with that unique meaning. When you
hear “I,” you encounter a specific individual and see things from his or her point of view.
(This characteristic of first-person point of view may be the reason why mediators and
marriage counselors tell their clients to use “I” statements only. You can disagree with
the point of view, but you can’t tell someone, “No, you don’t feel or think that way.”
 It links the reader to the author. The reader functions as a sidekick, standing next to
the hero (the “I”) in the midst of the action or discussion. 
 First-person also establishes a voice. You “hear” the author talking to you.
66
Part II: The Writer’s Toolkit 

The “I” in a work of literature or even in nonfiction isn’t necessarily the author. Because
authors pick and choose what to tell you — and how to tell you what they want you to know —
they manipulate the reader to some extent. Therefore, literary analysis generally refers to the
persona in the text, not to the author. The term persona acknowledges an element of artistic
shaping. Other terms that put a bit of distance between author and subject are narrator (for
prose works) and speaker (for poetry).
Second-person point of view
First-person can show up all by itself, without any acknowledgment of the reader’s existence.
However, sometimes it goes hand-in-hand with second-person point of view, the “you-your”
construction. In For Dummies books, second-person pops up all over the place, because the
authors of these books speak directly to their readers. Apart from For Dummies books,
second-person point of view is rare, but it does exist, particularly in letters and speeches —
two formats you may encounter on the AP exam. Keep these ideas in mind when you meet 
up with second-person point of view:
 Because second-person point of view connects directly with the reader, consider the
intended audience when you read a second-person piece. What is said to the reader
gives some idea of the reader’s personality, beliefs, and issues.
 This point of view implies immediacy. Whatever is discussed is happening right now,
or you’re being pulled into the past to experience whatever the author is describing or
stating.
 This point of view has risks too. If the author misjudges the audience, the “you” form
may alienate the reader. 
Third-person point of view
With third-person point of view, the writing is about a subject, not addressed to a particular
person and not from a narrator or a character. In nonfiction, the genre that dominates the
AP English Language and Composition test, third-person point of view is usually straight-
forward. The author describes, narrates, argues, or discusses a subject without injecting any
personal pronouns. (Of course, regardless of pronouns, the content of a nonfiction work may
express deeply held, personal beliefs.) In fiction, however, the author may enter into the
characters’ minds and reveal their thoughts. Fictional third-person point of view comes in
two varieties, limited and omniscient. In limited third-person, the author opens the mind of
one character only. Omniscient turns the author into an all-seeing voice, and all characters’
ideas and emotions are fair game.
If you’re analyzing a passage written in third-person point of view, these guidelines apply:
 The passage appears objective. Be warned, however, that all authors shape your per-
ception by deciding what to include and exclude and by presenting their material in a
particular writing style. Nothing is truly objective!
 The passage sounds universal. Because there’s no “I,” you can’t pin the ideas on one
particular person. The information in the passage seems separate from a human being
and therefore seems to apply to all human beings.
 Third-person point of view is the conventional style of writing for exposition (writ-
ing that explains). In the free-response portion of the AP exam, third-person point of
view is a good choice for synthesis or analysis essays. (Chapter 16 discusses these
types of questions.) Argument essays may be written in third-person also, but first-
person is also an option.
67
Chapter 5: The Bigger Picture: Analyzing Sentences and Paragraphs

 If you encounter a fiction piece (rare, but sometimes on the exam), pick apart any-
thing with a third-person-limited point of view. What do you know? What’s mysteri-
ous? Keep in mind that the character doesn’t necessarily understand everything that
the author or the reader does. In that gap, dramatic irony thrives. Dramatic irony is a lit-
erary term for a situation in which the audience/reader knows something the character
doesn’t. In the ancient Greek play Oedipus the King, for example, Oedipus pledges to
hunt down the murderer of the former king, Laius. The audience knows, but Oedipus
doesn’t, that Oedipus himself is the culprit.
Ideas and opinions
Frequently the free-response portion of the AP exam asks you to comment on the author’s
point of view — by which the exam writers mean the author’s ideas and opinions. (Questions
about writing style generally ask you to comment on the author’s use of rhetorical devices.)
Facing a question about the author’s point of view, keep these points in mind:
 Content is crucial. The author may be arguing for a particular solution or in favor of one
side of a controversial issue. What the author says tells you what he or she believes.
 Much about the author’s point of view is implied, not stated. I haven’t hung up a sign
declaring that everyone should read more, but the fact that I’m an English teacher and
my comments about books communicate my feelings about literature as loudly as any
banner.
 Language matters. If the passage refers to the “magnificent wilderness” or “wasted
scrubland” in a passage about mining, you can probably guess the author’s views on
environmentalism. (For help with interpreting diction, or word choice, turn to Chapter 4.)
 Depending upon content and the use of first-, second-, or third-person point of view,
the author may participate in or merely observe the events described in a passage.
The degree of involvement or detachment is important when you determine the
author’s point of view (in the idea or opinion sense, not writing style).
Here’s a quick foray into point of view. Read this passage by Daniel Defoe, in which he dis-
cusses household help. 
Women servants are now so scarce, that from thirty and forty shillings a year, their
wages are increased of late to six, seven, nay, eight pounds per annum, and upwards;
insomuch that an ordinary tradesman cannot well keep one; but his wife, who might be
useful in his shop or business, must do the drudgery of household affairs; and all this
because our servant-wenches are so puffed up with pride nowadays, that they never
think they go fine enough: it is a hard matter to know the mistress from the maid by
their dress; nay, very often the maid shall be much the finer of the two.
You don’t have to understand the salary scale of Defoe’s time see that he is not a fan of
maids. The statement “servant-wenches are so puffed up with pride nowadays” says it all.
Also, the maid is compared to the “mistress” and “very often the maid shall be the finer of
the two.” Defoe doesn’t specifically refer to the past, but the word “now” in the first sentence
implies nostalgia for the good old days, when presumably it was easier and cheaper to keep
servants. Looking further, you may have noticed the term “wenches,” a word for women that
carries a negative connotation. Add all this up, and Defoe’s point of view is clear: Maids have
too many privileges.

pen your closet. I bet you can find your clothes without mounting a major search and
rescue expedition. True, you may have to slide some hangers around before your
favorite shirt appears, but you don’t have to paw through a pile of clothing heaped on the
floor. (If you do, put this book away and clean up! Then hit the books again.) 
Rhetorical strategies are hangers in literature’s closet. They organize ideas so that the reader
doesn’t have to rummage through a pile of prose, hoping to bump into your point. Because
ideas differ as much as clothing does, the “hangers” vary also. You wouldn’t put a sweater on
a clip-on hanger made for pants. Nor should you stick a compare-contrast essay into a cause-
and-effect format.
In this chapter I survey the most common rhetorical strategies: cause and effect, compare
and contrast, anecdote and example, classification and definition, and process or chronol-
ogy. Each strategy has its own quirks and conventions. Getting to know these strategies
helps you create a sturdy, efficient “hanger” for the writing you do on the essay portion of
the AP exam. Understanding rhetorical strategy boosts your multiple-choice score too,
because this topic is popular with exam writers. 
Note: Some English teachers prefer the term “patterns of exposition,” “rhetorical modes,” or
something else. Don’t worry about the names of these strategies. Just know how they work.
Cause and Effect
Cause and effect probably entered your repertoire when you were still a toddler and faced an
angry Authority Figure demanding to know why you had slapped your sister or painted the
dog purple. You said, “She pulled my nose!” or “Rover likes purple!” or something similar.
In other words, you explained the cause in order to justify the effect. Now that you’re older,
cause and effect comes in handy when you’re writing — and yes, this strategy is still useful
when you’re facing an angry Authority Figure demanding to know why you stayed out past
curfew or painted the dog purple, which is still Rover’s favorite color.
A cause-and-effect essay is all about consequences. Something happens, or someone encoun-
ters a situation. Somebody reacts, or a new situation develops. Cause-and-effect passages
frequently show up in science books, because science is all about explaining why things
happen. It’s a good strategy for history also, for the same reason. 

To recognize and analyze a cause-and-effect passage, look for these qualities:
 The simplest cause-and-effect pattern identifies or describes the cause in one para-
graph or in a few paragraphs, depending upon complexity. Subsequent paragraphs go
into the effect. 
 This pattern may be flipped upside down: The effects are the topic of the first para-
graph or two; then the writer moves backward to explain why these effects existed.
 The two halves (cause and effect) don’t have to be balanced. Depending upon the
author’s purpose, more weight may be given to one. In fact, sometimes the cause is just
a word or a short phrase (“The Treaty of Versailles led to . . .”) preceding a lengthy dis-
cussion of the effects. The reverse may also be true, with a multiparagraph buildup to
one statement (“Because of these factors, World War I began”).
 Cause-and-effect passages may begin with a question, which the passage answers.
The question expresses the effect (“Why is the sky blue?”), and the answer explains the
cause (“The sky is blue because . . .”). 
 Key words include “consequently,” “therefore,” “thus,” “hence,” “as a result,” “because,”
“the cause of,” “as,” and “the effect of.” Don’t assume that these words will be present,
however. The rhetorical strategy may be expressed only through content.
Here’s a passage from The Knight by Alan Baker (Wiley, 2003; reprinted with permission of
John Wiley and Sons, Inc.). It’s a straightforward example of cause and effect.
The eventual decline of feudalism occurred as a result of a number of factors, perhaps
the most important of which was the impracticality of lords retaining a large number of
knights who sat idle during the periods between wars. There was also the potentially
serious problem of knights growing restless and bored waiting for the call to arms,
which was their true vocation, and causing problems in the surrounding villages. The
knights, too, found that the call to military service could come at the most inconvenient
times, and for this reason the practice of commutation arose, whereby a knight would
pay a sum of money (scutage) to his lord instead of going to war. Eventually money
began to take the place of land as a symbol of power, and this gave rise to a new form of
feudalism, . . . Under [the new type of feudalism], lords obtained services not by grant-
ing land to tenants, but by paying annual retaining fees and daily wages. The king thus
contracted with individual earls, barons, and knights to provide a fixed number of men
at a fixed wage, should the need arise. An additional blow to the [original] form of feu-
dalism came with the development of gunpowder, cannons, and firearms, which made
castles and heavily armored mounted knights virtually obsolete. From the twelfth cen-
tury onward, feudalism was further undermined by the rise of the centralized state, with
its salaried officials and mercenary armies. Eventually the relationship between vassal
and lord was replaced by that between subject and sovereign.
Notice that the effect — the decline of feudalism — is explored only briefly when the author
describes “a new form of feudalism” and merely mentions the relationship “between subject
and sovereign” that resulted from feudalism’s decline. The author’s attention rests mainly on
the causes of the decline: “knights who sat idle” and got into trouble, money instead of land
as a symbol of wealth, new weapons, “the rise of the centralized state,” and “salaried officials
and mercenary armies.” A key phrase, “as a result of,” announces the author’s intentions in
the first sentence. Other significant phrases are “this gave rise to” and “[a]n additional blow,”
as well as “further undermined.”
Here’s another cause-and-effect passage, an excerpt from Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick. This
great work is both a novel and a textbook on whaling, an important industry of the nine-
teenth century. In this passage Melville refers to whale oil, the fuel for lamps in this period.
Melville’s rhetorical strategy is subtle.

Part II: The Writer's Toolkit 

Had you descended from the Pequod’s try-works to the Pequod’s forecastle, where the off
duty watch were sleeping, for one single moment you would have almost thought you
were standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counselors. There they
lay in their triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a chiseled muteness; a score of lamps
flashing upon his hooded eyes. In merchantmen [trading vessels], oil for the sailor is more
scarce than the milk of queens. To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in
darkness to his pallet, this is his usual lot. But the whaleman, as he seeks the food of light,
so he lives in light. He makes his berth an Aladdin’s lamp, and lays him down in it; so that
in the [darkest] night the ship’s black hull still houses an illumination. See with what
entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of lamps — often but old bottles and vials,
though — to the copper cooler at the try-works, and replenishes them there, as mugs
of ale at a vat. He burns, too, the purest of oil, in its unmanufactured, and, therefore,
unvitiated state; a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or astral contrivances ashore. It is sweet
as early grass butter in April. He goes and hunts for his oil, so as to be sure of its freshness
and genuineness, even as the traveler on the prairie hunts up his own supper of game.
The reader has to make the logical leaps here. Melville talks about the darkness of “mer-
chantmen” and the “whaleman” who “lives in light.” Why does the whaleman live in light?
Because “he seeks the food of light.” Melville also implies that access to oil and the purity of
the oil are causes of brightly lit whaling ships. In contrast to The Knight, Melville gives equal
weight in this passage to cause and effect.
Although the preceding passage falls into the “cause and effect” category, Melville briefly
compares a “whaleman” with “merchantmen.” A good writer uses the most effective means
available to make a point, and, as you see in Melville’s passage, rhetorical strategies often
overlap.
Compare and Contrast
It’s human nature to compare and contrast, as anyone who has waited patiently behind a
customer debating at length whether to purchase a half-caf non-fat triple-shot latte instead of
a can of diet soda. (Note to the woman on line in front of me at the coffee shop last week: The
compare-contrast discussion doesn’t have to last ten minutes.) On the AP exam, compare-
contrast passages show up fairly often as reading selections in the multiple-choice section.
Be on the lookout for these characteristics:
 Two is a natural number in a compare-contrast passage, but three (or more) isn’t a
crowd. The author may compare and contrast any number of elements.
 In a stand-alone compare-contrast passage (not an excerpt from a longer work), the
passage probably begins with an introduction that names the elements being com-
pared. The conclusion renders some sort of judgment or opinion about the relative
merits of these elements.
 In an excerpt from a longer work, you may not see an introduction or conclusion —
just the body paragraphs.
 The simplest format for a compare-contrast passage devotes one body paragraph or
section to each element. In a passage on apples and oranges, for example, you would
see one section on apples and one on oranges.
 Compare-contrast essays may also divide according to qualities. For example, in an
apple-orange passage, the body may be devoted to flavor, appearance, cultivation, and
market — one per paragraph.
 Another structure for this type of essay devotes one body paragraph to differences and
one to similarities.

Chapter 6: Getting the Message Across: Rhetorical Strategies

You may have to write a compare-contrast essay yourself, if the AP throws a paired-passage
question at you in the essay section. In that case, the analysis points in the bulleted list help
you organize your work.
Check out this comparison of the diet of poor people in England with that of English sailors
on a polar exploration expedition. WARNING: You may get hungry reading this excerpt from
Scott Cookman’s Ice Blink (Wiley, 2000; reprinted with permission of John Wiley and Sons,
Inc.). This passage has no introduction or conclusion, because I sliced it out of a much
longer discussion of diet. Notice how Cookman arranges the information:
The poor in England subsisted largely on gruel (made from barley or oats), an abun-
dance of stale bread, onions, potatoes, and occasionally bacon. In place of butter, they
ate cheese (a lower-class favorite), and fish, because it was cheaper than meat. Since
fuel was expensive and ovens more so, the average laborer’s family had one hot meal
a week, usually on Sunday when they took their suppers to the local baker’s to get
them cooked.
The middle class diet was more substantial, but relentlessly monotonous. It consisted
primarily of mutton (old, rather tough sheep’s meat) and ham and bacon, which were
cheap to raise, easy to cure, and kept well. To these were added potatoes and a very few
vegetables, mostly cabbage, beets, and parsnips.
No one drank water, because it was rightly presumed to be impure and unsafe (the great
London cholera epidemic of 1854 was traced to a single public water pump). Owing to
high import duties and the East India Company’s virtual monopoly, tea was too expen-
sive for most. Beer, stout, ale, and porter quenched the thirst of the poor; gin and rum
were the favored spirits. Only the wealthy could afford wine.
Compared to their contemporaries ashore, able-bodied seamen in the Franklin
Expedition — thanks to Barrow’s foresight — ate and drank quite well. Contrary to
myth, a seaman wasn’t surviving on weevil-filled hardtack and putrid water. On
“Discovery Service” to the polar regions, he was living high on the hog.
On a typical Monday, he got 1 pound of bread (fresh-baked if the weather and seas per-
mitted the cook a galley fire, premade ship’s biscuit if it did not). He was issued 1 pound
of salt pork or beef and 1⁄2 pound of canned potatoes. He also got 2 ounces of raisins,
2 ounces of pickled vegetables, 2 ounces of suet, 2 ounces of chocolate, 1 1⁄2 ounces of
sugar mixed with 1 ounce of lemon juice (against scurvy), 1⁄4 ounce of good tea, plus
vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper for seasonings, and some oatmeal or Scotch barley.
Then, of course, there was the 1 gill of concentrated rum issued every day at noon.
In all, this constituted about 3 pounds of food a day, discounting the rum, tea, seasonings,
and the liberal 1 ounce of tobacco issued daily. Not bad, when at home a fellow was lucky
to get a stale end of bread, bowl of gruel, and some oysters. . . .
I won’t go on, as Cookman does, to describe the seaman’s diet on each day of the week and
the perks for officers and dignitaries. However, even this small portion of Ice Blink makes the
organizational strategy clear. Cookman divides his attention neatly between the elements
being compared and takes them each in turn. Had he chosen a slightly different strategy,
Cookman might have discussed quantity, healthfulness, variety, and cost in four body para-
graphs, ping-ponging back and forth between land and sea.
The next example is from an early twentieth century science text. This portion has the
delightful title “How to Breathe.” (And you thought breathing came naturally!) Use your X-ray
vision to discern the organizational pattern. Because this section is printed in its entirety,
also check whether an introduction and/or conclusion is present.

Part II: The Writer's Toolkit 

How to Breathe: Air, which is essential to life and health, should enter the body through
the nose and, not through the mouth. The peculiar nature and arrangement of the mem-
branes of the nose enable the nostrils to clean, and warm, and moisten the air which
passes through them to the lungs. Floating around in the atmosphere are dust particles
which ought not to get into the lungs. The nose is provided with small hairs and a moist
inner membrane which serve as filters in removing solid particles from the air, and in
thus purifying it before its entrance into the lungs.
In the immediate neighborhood of three Philadelphia high schools, having an approximate
enrollment of over 8000 pupils, is a huge manufacturing plant which day and night pours
forth grimy smoke and soot into the atmosphere which must supply oxygen to this vast
group of young lives. If the vital importance of nose breathing is impressed upon these
young people, the harmful effect of the foul air may be greatly lessened, the smoke parti-
cles and germs being held back by the nose filters and never reaching the lungs. If, how-
ever, this principle of hygiene is not brought to their attention, the dangerous habit of
breathing through the open, or at least partially open, mouth will continue, and objection-
able matter will pass through the mouth and find a lodging place in the lungs.
There is another very important reason why nose breathing is preferable to mouth
breathing. The temperature of the human body is approximately 98° F., and the air
which enters the lungs should not be far below this temperature. If air reaches the lungs
through the nose, its journey is relatively long and slow, and there is opportunity for it
to be warmed before it reaches the lungs. If, on the other hand, air passes to the lungs
by way of the mouth, the warming process is brief and insufficient, and the lungs suffer
in consequence. Naturally, the gravest danger is in winter.
The first paragraph sets up the comparison between nose-breathers and mouth-breathers,
with nose-breathers winning by far more than a nose. (Sorry. I couldn’t resist the pun.) The
first paragraph also explains the primary reason for the superiority of nose-breathing: purifi-
cation. Paragraph two expands upon this theme, with the vision of 8000 kids in Philadelphia
living stunted, mouth-breathing lives. The third paragraph comes up with another reason —
temperature. Step back a moment and consider (while, of course, breathing through your
nose) the division of information. Each paragraph talks about both elements but focuses on
a different subtopic (purity, example, temperature). The introduction is folded into the first
sentence of paragraph one, and the author hasn’t bothered writing a conclusion.
You probably noticed that the middle paragraph of “How to Breathe” is a specific example of
the author’s point. That paragraph could be classified as “anecdote and example,” a rhetorical
strategy I discuss in the next section. However, if the AP queried you about the overall rhetori-
cal strategy of this piece, you should opt for the dominant strategy — compare and contrast.
Though strategies sometimes overlap, one is usually more important than the others.
Anecdote and Example
Every time you open a magazine, you probably encounter the rhetorical strategy of anecdote
and example. Most articles begin with an anecdote (“May had no inkling, as she watered her
petunias, that disaster was about to strike her neat bungalow in Beverly Hills . . .”). The focus
on one individual soon gives way to a larger point (“At least one million gardens in the United
States contain killer petunia plants . . .”). Magazine writers like anecdotes because they draw
the reader’s interest. Who doesn’t like peering into someone else’s life? Examples are popular
also. In fact, I’ve filled this book with examples — of passages similar to those on the AP
exam, of AP-style questions, of rhetorical devices and strategies, and more. Examples make
general principles real and understandable. 
73
Chapter 6: Getting the Message Across: Rhetorical Strategies

When you bump up against an anecdote or an example in a passage, place it in this context:
 The anecdote may be, as I mentioned previously, the first thing you see. Or, the author
may embed anecdotes in other spots. 
 Ask yourself why an anecdote appears where it does. Is it purely an attention-getter?
Does the anecdote serve as proof of an assertion situated before or after the anecdote?
On the AP exam, you may be asked to determine the purpose of an anecdote or exam-
ple. Answering these questions helps you figure out the purpose of these elements.
 Consider the source of each anecdote or example. Are you hearing from an expert, with
wide-ranging knowledge, or from a bystander? Is the story told from the point of view
of a participant or an observer? Evaluating sources helps you identify attitude of the
author or of a source — a common AP query. 
 Key words indicating this rhetorical strategy are “include,” “typical of,” “for example,”
“for instance,” “an exception to the rule,” “as in,” “the following,” “the preceding,”
“sample,” “testimony,” “witness,” “corroborate,” “proof,” “such as,” “like,” “a case in
point,” and “and the like.” However, anecdotes and examples may appear without any
of these words.
 Just because authors offer anecdotes as proof of their generalizations doesn’t mean
you have to accept their reasoning. You retain the right to see the anecdote or example
as an exception, not a rule.
Here’s a passage from Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick, in which the narrator discusses attacks
by whales. Evaluate the rhetorical strategy as you read.
People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an enormous creature
of enormous power; but I have ever found that when narrating to them some specific
example of this two-fold enormousness, they have significantly complimented me upon
my facetiousness; when, I declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of being facetious
than Moses, when he wrote the history of the plagues of Egypt. But fortunately the spe-
cial point I here seek can be established upon testimony entirely independent of my
own. That point is this: The Sperm Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, know-
ing, and judiciously malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy,
and sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm Whale HAS done it.
First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket, was cruising in the
Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her boats, and gave chase to a shoal of
sperm whales. Ere long, several of the whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very
large whale escaping from the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore directly down
upon the ship. Dashing his forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that in less than
“ten minutes” she settled down and fell over. Not a surviving plank of her has been seen
since. . . . At this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket. I have seen Owen Chace,
who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy; I have read his plain and
faithful narrative; I have conversed with his son; and all this within a few miles of the
scene of the catastrophe. 
The following are excerpts from Chace’s narrative: “Every fact seemed to warrant me
in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed [the whale’s] operations;
he made two attacks upon the ship, at a short interval between them. . . .”
Secondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807 totally lost off the
Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic particulars of this catastrophe I have never
chanced to encounter, though from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual
allusions to it.
Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J---, then commanding an
American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to be dining with a party of whaling
captains, on board a Nantucket ship in the harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands.
74
Part II: The Writer's Toolkit 

Conversation turning upon whales, the Commodore was pleased to be skeptical touch-
ing the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He
peremptorily denied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout sloop-of-war
as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very good; but there is more coming.
Some weeks after, the Commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso. But
he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale, that begged a few moments’ confi-
dential business with him. That business consisted in fetching the Commodore’s craft
such a thwack, that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to
heave down and repair.
I chopped the list of examples considerably, in the interest of space. But the narrator goes on
for a few more pages in the same vein. Although you have only a portion of this chapter, you
can easily see what Melville, by means of his narrator, is doing. He announces in the first
paragraph that he’s not being facetious (joking) and that he’s got proof: “testimony entirely
independent” that the Sperm Whale is dangerous. Next is his first example, the wreck of
Captain Pollack’s ship. Did you catch the reference to this man as “a resident of Nantucket”?
The narrator implies that if you doubt the story, you should go to Nantucket and check it
yourself. I omitted some testimony from Owen Chace (that’s where you see ellipses, little
dots that indicate missing words), but you can see why Melville wanted Chace there — to
confirm that the whale’s attack was deliberate. Other examples follow: the Union, and then
the “American sloop-of-war,” whose Commodore tempted fate by denying whale power and
getting whomped in return. The rhetorical strategy in this passage relies upon “expert wit-
nesses”; the narrator himself isn’t a participant, but he’s got stories from people who were —
people who can corroborate the narrator’s point.
One more example of anecdote-example strategy, this time from Jack London, an American
writer who described an experience in London, England. Notice how this piece (sliced from a
much longer work) differs from Melville’s.
One old woman, between fifty and sixty, a sheer wreck, I had noticed earlier in the night
standing in Piccadilly, not far from Leicester Square. She seemed to have neither the sense
nor the strength to get out of the rain or keep walking, but stood stupidly, whenever she
got the chance, meditating on past days, I imagine, when life was young and blood was
warm. But she did not get the chance often. She was moved on by every policeman, and
it required an average of six moves to send her doddering off one man’s beat and on to
another’s. By three o’clock, she had progressed as far as St. James Street, and as the
clocks were striking four I saw her sleeping soundly against the iron railings of Green Park.
A brisk shower was falling at the time, and she must have been drenched to the skin.
Now, said I, at one o’clock, to myself; consider that you are a poor young man, penniless,
in London Town, and that to-morrow you must look for work. It is necessary, therefore,
that you get some sleep in order that you may have strength to look for work and to do
work in case you find it.
So I sat down on the stone steps of a building. Five minutes later a policeman was look-
ing at me. My eyes were wide open, so he only grunted and passed on. Ten minutes later
my head was on my knees, I was dozing, and the same policeman was saying gruffly,
“‘Ere, you, get outa that!”
I got. And, like the old woman, I continued to get; for every time I dozed, a policeman
was there to rout me along again. 
London’s essay describes a homeless woman forced to move along all night until she finally
finds refuge in a park. His own experience echoes hers. London is not only an observer but
also a participant. His purpose is to call attention to the plight of the homeless, especially “a
poor young man” who is too tired “to look for work” or “to do work” after a night of encoun-
ters with the police. Because his testimony comes from the inside, the reader believes him.
Unlike Melville, London doesn’t call upon others to prove his point; his own homeless night
does the job. 
75
Chapter 6: Getting the Message Across: Rhetorical Strategies

Classification and Definition
Human beings classify and define so readily that I sometimes think the human brain comes
equipped with a set of baskets. The baskets are labeled (that’s definition) and items are
sorted among the baskets (that’s classification). To put it another way: authors tackling huge
subjects have to break those subjects down into parts (classification) and then explain what
those parts are (definition). You’ve probably read a ton of writing with this rhetorical strat-
egy in your science textbooks or in any textbook that deals with a lot of terminology (gram-
mar texts are notorious for this!). Characteristics of classification-definition pieces include
the following:
 The author is aware of the audience. An author defines terms only when the intended
reader isn’t likely to know those terms already. In this book, I give the meaning of liter-
ary terms, assuming that you — unlike me — have far too interesting a life to have
memorized them.
 Definitions are usually complicated. Don’t expect to see one-word or short-phrase defi-
nitions, such as those on a vocabulary list. If the rhetorical strategy of definition is
applied to an entire passage, a lot has to be explained.
 Though they’re not always present, key words that help you recognize this rhetorical
strategy include “definition,” “type,” “sort,” “classify,” “category,” and “kind.”
 The two parts of this rhetorical strategy may be separated (in different paragraphs or, if
the work is full-length, in different chapters). On the AP exam, you may see only half —
definition alone, usually. Classification is hard to accomplish without definition, unless
the definitions are commonly known.
 The author may announce the strategy (“Loyalty may be defined as . . .”) or may simply
imply it (“The loyalists supported the Queen . . .”).
Here’s a straightforward, easy example of definition, drawn from a science text:
A farsighted person is one who cannot see near objects so distinctly as far objects, and
who in many cases cannot see near objects at all. The eyeball of a farsighted person is
very short, and the retina is too close to the crystalline lens. Near objects are brought
to a focus behind the retina instead of on it, and hence are not visible. Even though the
muscles of accommodation do their best to bulge and thicken the lens, the rays of light
are not bent sufficiently to focus sharply on the retina. In consequence objects look
blurred. Farsightedness can be remedied by convex glasses, since they bend the light
and bring it to a closer focus. Convex glasses, by bending the rays and bringing them to
a nearer focus, overbalance a short eyeball with its tendency to focus objects behind
the retina.
How many definitions did you find? I count two: the definition of “a farsighted person” and
the definition of “convex glasses.” The first is obvious, because the author spends several
sentences discussing farsightedness. The second is subtler; convex glasses come into this
paragraph only in relation to the condition they remedy (farsightedness) and what they do
(“bend the light and bring it to a closer focus”). 
On the AP exam, you may see questions about the purpose of a particular line or section.
Sometimes the answer is “to define _____” or “to clarify the meaning of _____.”
Now for a more complicated passage. Once again, I turn to my favorite seagoing writer
(Melville). This excerpt from Moby-Dick follows a quotation from Linnaeus, a scientist who
stated that whales are not fish. (Linnaeus was correct; whales are mammals.) Here Melville
argues that Linnaeus is wrong, proving nothing about the biology of whales but everything
76
Part II: The Writer's Toolkit 

about the fact that being a good writer doesn’t mean you know the facts. Read Melville’s pas-
sage and figure out how he handles definition and classification.
I take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah
to back me. This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal respect
does the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnaeus has given you those items. But in
brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold
blooded.
Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as conspicuously to
label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A
HORIZONTAL TAIL. There you have him. However contracted, that definition is the
result of expanded meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not
a fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is still more cogent,
as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to
landsmen have not a flat, but a vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting
fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal position.
By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude from the
leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best
informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other hand, link with it any fish hitherto authorita-
tively regarded as alien. Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish must
be included in this ground-plan of Cetology. 
Melville’s strategy in this passage is to classify whales as fish and then to define a new cate-
gory of fish. He rebuts Linnaeus and calls upon the authority of experts. Now for the details:
Melville announces his classification — and his disagreement with Linnaeus — in the first
paragraph. Melville grants Linnaeus, whom he has set up as an opponent, two biological
realities: Whales have “lungs and warm blood; whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold
blooded.” Melville justifies his classification in the second paragraph by explaining what
excludes an animal from the “fish category” (the walrus, because a walrus is amphibious).
The second paragraph also contains Melville’s own definition of a whale: a “SPOUTING FISH
WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL.” (The capital letters are Melville’s and show his strong belief.)
Melville grants that fish tails are usually vertical, but spouting fish are an exception to this
rule. In the third paragraph, Melville brings in the experts — the “Nantucketers” (residents of
Nantucket, a whaling center), and says that “any sea creature” they considered a whale is a
whale. In essence he’s saying, “They know what they’re talking about. They think the whale is
a fish, so it is.” 
Process and Chronology
Judging from the users’ manuals accompanying my new television and laptop computer, I’d
say that the rhetorical strategy of process and chronology is tough to pull off. By the time
I’ve spent an hour locating the “button to change variable modes into PCG mode, except in
model 1211 wherein CPG mode is preferred, to avoid fatal electrocution,” I’m ready to give up
and electrocute myself. But process and chronology are natural ways of thinking (as are all
the rhetorical strategies), because this rhetorical strategy explains how to get from Point A
to Point B, either in action (process) or time (chronology). And that’s what life is, isn’t it?
Moving forward. The problem is that process-and-chronology writers must lead the reader
through a series of steps, and the steps have to be manageable. Leave one out, and the
reader is stuck. Put too many steps in, and the reader is bored.
You’ve read many process-and-chronology pieces in school and, if you’ve ever bought any
electronics, in your personal life as well. Here are some things to keep in mind when you’re
cracking a passage with this rhetorical strategy:

Chapter 6: Getting the Message Across: Rhetorical Strategies

 The writing often moves forward in time, in action, or both. However, the author may
digress from the main process he or she is describing to explain a subtopic, breaking
the forward motion. Be alert for these breaks!
 You should be able to identify the steps and place them in order.
 The steps are usually linked by transitions. (Transitions are single words or longer
statements that help the reader move from one point to the next. See Chapter 5 for
more information).
 Key words associated with process and chronology include “while,” “since,” “then,”
“after,” “before,” “in order to,” “now,” “separately,” “concluded,” “finished,” “com-
pleted,” “at first,” “secondly,” and “last.”
 Verb tense is a big deal in process-and-chronology writing. Some constructions (the
helping verb “had,” for example) place one action before another. For help with verb
tense, turn to Chapter 7.
 Many writers employ metaphors or extended metaphors to convey information in a
process-and-chronology piece. Crack the metaphor, and everything becomes clear. For
example, instead of telling you to walk three yards east, turn left, and proceed for five
more yards, the writer may tell you that the path is “an inverted letter L.” 
Time to examine process-and-chronology in action. I’ll spare you a reading from my com-
puter manual and instead show you a bit from an account of the Spanish-American War.
Notice the order of events.
The orderly who brought the dispatch should have dashed up at a gallop, clicked his
spurs, saluted and begun with “The commanding General’s compliments, sir,” et cetera.
Instead, he dragged a very tired horse up the trail, knee-deep in mud, brought to, stand-
ing with a gasp of relief, and said, as he pushed his hat back from his forehead: “Say, is
here where General McKibben is?”
We stopped singing and took our feet down from the railing of the veranda. In the room
back of us we heard the General raise on an elbow and tell his orderly to light a candle.
The orderly went inside, drawing a paper from his pocket, and the aides followed.
Through the open window we could plainly hear what followed, and see, too, for that
matter, by twisting a bit on our chairs.
The General had mislaid his eyeglasses and so passed the dispatch to one of his aides,
saying: “I’ll get you to read this for me, Nolan.” On one knee, and holding the dispatch
to the candle-light, Nolan read it aloud. It began tamely enough with the usual military for-
mulas, and the first thirty words might have been part of any one of the many dispatches
the General had been receiving during the last three days. And then “to accompany the
commanding General to a point midway between the Spanish and American lines and
there to receive the surrender of General Toral. At noon, precisely, the American flag will
be raised over the Governor’s Palace in the city of Santiago. A salute of twenty-one guns
will be fired from Captain Capron’s battery. The regimental bands will play ‘The Star-
Spangled Banner’ and the troops will cheer. SHAFTER.”
There was a silence. The aide returned the paper to the General and straightened up,
rubbing the dust from his knee. The General shifted his pipe to the other corner of his
mouth. The little green parrot who lived in the premises trundled gravely across the
brick floor, and for an instant we all watched her with the intensest attention. “Hum,”
muttered the General reflectively between his teeth. “Hum. They’ve caved in. Well, you
won’t have to make that little reconnaissance of yours down the railroad, after all,
Mr. Nolan.” And so it was that we first heard of the surrender of Santiago de Cuba.
78
Part II: The Writer's Toolkit 

Most of this is in strict chronological order: the orderly arrives, asks for the general, and
“we” stop singing. The general tells his orderly to light a candle, passes the dispatch from
General Shafter to an aide, who reads it aloud. Now chronological order breaks, because the
dispatch describes events that will occur. Then the main narrative continues in chronologi-
cal order: the men fall silent, the aide gives the paper to the general, who shifts his pipe. The
parrot walks across the floor. The general comments on the message. 
When chronological order isn’t in order, something different is happening. In the preceding
passage, the difference lies in the message, which tells about events that happen apart from
the main narration. As always, a pattern break should catch your eye. Give that spot extra
attention!
Now for a more complicated process-and-chronology piece. Here’s an excerpt from A Short
History of Planet Earth by F. D. MacDougall (Wiley, 2002; reprinted with permission of John
Wiley and Sons, Inc.). Keep your eye on the steps the passage describes.
Where the plates [of the earth’s surface] move apart, there are rifts in the earth’s crust.
Basalt, the most common product of melting of the earth’s interior, wells up to fill them;
as we have seen, this is how new seafloor is created. Most of the divergent plate bound-
aries are found in the oceans. Paradoxical as it may seem at first, the rifts, which are
valleys or depressions, are often at the center of ridges, which are broad topographic
highs. . . . the ridges exist because of the upwelling mantle material and the heat it car-
ries. As the newly created crust moves away from the ridge, it cools, contracts, becomes
denser, and sinks to lower elevations. The depth of the ocean increases by about a
factor of two, from approximately 21⁄2 kilometers to five, from the crest of the ridges to
the old parts of the seafloor far removed from the spreading region.
MacDougall has explained no fewer than four, interlinked processes in this short paragraph:
the creation of rifts, seafloor, oceans, and ridges. The steps are fairly easy to follow for each
separate process, but because one process depends upon the other, you have to untangle
them before any of them make sense. Not an easy task, but not impossible either. Here you
go: To make a rift, preheat the oven to — wait, that’s a different book! Let me try again. Rifts
occur when the plates of the earth’s surface move apart. Seafloor comes into being when
(1) the earth’s plates move apart and (2) basalt rushes in. Oceans show up when the sea
floods into a rift. A ridge is created when (1) the earth’s mantle bulges upward and (2) the
crust displaced by the ridge moves outward and (3) cools and (4) contracts and (5) becomes
denser and (6) sinks and (7) leaves the ridge higher than the sunken crust around it. Did you
catch all that? 
Some AP multiple-choice questions are little more than standard reading-comprehension
queries. When you read a process-and-chronology passage, you may be asked a factual ques-
tion, something like (referring to the preceding example) “According to the passage, ridges
are formed when . . . .” Make a mental note of the steps in the process(es), and you can
quickly locate the correct answer choice.

ention grammar and most people run from the room, explaining why they absolutely
hate the subject. Mention that you’re a grammarian, and most people run even
faster — but silently, for fear of making a grammar error. (Trust me on this one. I’m a gram-
marian, and this sort of thing happens to me all the time.) Yet grammar is hardwired into your
brain, because it’s the skeleton that supports expression and communication. Furthermore,
it’s a huge deal on the AP English Language and Composition exam. The graders expect to
see good (but not perfect!) grammar in the free-response portion of the test. Also, quite a few
multiple-choice questions depend upon your ability to crack open a sentence and extract the
meaning — a grammatical feat — though only a few questions contain grammar terminology.
Without doubt, a quick grammar refresher is worth your time and energy. 
In this chapter, I address the grammatical elements most likely to trip you up on the exam
and demystify some of the terms you’re likely to encounter on AP Day. If grammar gives you
nightmares and this chapter isn’t sufficient remedy, you can boost my ego — and get a lot of
extra practice and explanation — by consulting two other books I wrote, English Grammar
For Dummies (Wiley, 2001) and English Grammar Workbook For Dummies (Wiley, 2007).
Building a Solid Base: Elements of a Sentence
Briefly, every English sentence contains these elements: a complete thought (required),
a verb and a subject (also required), a complement (usually optional), and descriptions
(always optional). I promise to keep the grammatical terminology to a minimum, but I have
to throw some definitions at you:
 A verb expresses action or state of being. Add-ons (helping verbs) such as “has,”
“will,” “can,” “should,” “does,” and others alter meaning slightly by indicating tense
(when the action or state of being happened), degree of obligation, or ability. Helping
verbs also create questions. I’ve underlined the verbs in these sentences:
Holly spoke for two hours last night. Holly can ramble on forever. Mort is impa-
tient when he must communicate with Holly. “Does Holly ever sleep?” Mort has
sometimes asked. “She seems to need no rest,” he added.

Did you notice that “to need” is not underlined in the last sample sentence? “To need”
isn’t a verb. It’s an infinitive — a sort of verb family “parent” that looks like a verb but
doesn’t function as one. For more information on infinitives, see “The tense of verbals”
in this chapter.
 Every verb has a subject, the person or thing doing the action or existing in the
state of being expressed by the verb. To identify the subject, ask “who?” or “what?”
before the verb. For instance, in the sentence “Holly spoke for two hours last night,”
ask “Who spoke?” The answer (“Holly”) is the subject. 
 A complete thought stands alone. Check out these two examples, one complete and
one incomplete:
Yesterday it rained. (complete)
Because it rained. (incomplete)
Incomplete thoughts, when they contain a subject and a verb, are usually dependent or
subordinate clauses. The AP exam sometimes asks you the function of a specific set of
dependent or subordinate clauses. Don’t let the grammar lingo upset you. You don’t
need it in order to answer the question. Reading comprehension and logic should be
enough to steer you to the correct answer. 
 A complement adds to the idea begun by the subject and the verb. Complements are
obligatory elements of a sentence if they’re needed to complete a thought. Otherwise,
they’re optional. They come in a million shapes and sizes, but you can always locate
them by asking “whom/who?” or “what?” after stating the subject and verb. For exam-
ple, in the sentence “Mort is impatient,” you ask, “Mort is who?” and “Mort is what?”
The answer, “Mort is impatient,” tells you that “impatient” is a complement.
 Descriptions divide into two giant families: adjectives and adverbs. Descriptions
may be a single word, a phrase, or a clause (an expression containing a subject and a
verb). Check out the underlined members of the adjective and adverb family:
Blue skies completely covered the town on the outskirts of the mountains. The
tallest mountain, which was topped with snow, is very famous.
You don’t have to distinguish between adjectives and adverbs on the AP, but you do
have to use the words correctly! (For more about descriptive words, see “Modifying
Habits” in this chapter.)
Some words look like verbs but function as adjective or adverbs. These hybrids are known
as verbals, in grammar-speak. (Full disclosure: verbals sometimes act as nouns, but those
verbals seldom cause problems, so I ignore them here.) The tense of a verbal, as well as its
placement, affects meaning. Check out “Fine-Tuning Verb Usage” for everything you need to
know about tense, and “Modifying Habits” for information on placement.
Of course, sentences — especially in AP passages — may be extremely complicated, with
tangles of clauses and a ton of punctuation. Sometimes they follow outdated grammar rules
or (gasp!) break rules purposely. Regardless, most of the time, you can figure out what’s what
by following these easy steps:
1. Read the entire sentence, just for comprehension.
There’s a no-brainer! Of course you want to know what the sentence means!
2. If possible, divide the sentence into logical units. 
The sentence “The book that Henry wrote last year was a best seller” has two thoughts
in it: “The book was a best seller” and “that Henry wrote.”
82
Part II: The Writer’s Toolkit 

3. As necessary, determine the grammatical identity of each part of the sentence. 
Not many AP questions rely upon your knowing which part of the sentence is a subject
and which is a verb (or a clause or something else). But some questions — those
involving parallelism, for example — do require such knowledge. Working within the
smaller, logical units of a sentence makes your life much simpler. For example, referring
to the sentence in Step 2, you may find the subject of “wrote” more quickly when “that
Henry wrote” is isolated from the rest of the sentence.
If you’re identifying elements in a question, turn the question into a statement. The subject
and verb are easier to identify in statements. For instance, suppose you’re facing this sen-
tence: “Does Martha send e-mail every day?” Change the sentence to “Martha does send
e-mail every day” before picking it apart.
Fine-Tuning Verb Usage
Every sentence pivots around its verb(s), so you should always zero in on verbs when you’re
faced with a complicated comprehension problem or when you’re checking your own writ-
ing. Verbs can trip you up because of problems with agreement, tense, and mood. You proba-
bly won’t see any questions referencing agreement (singular/plural issues) on the AP test,
though of course your own writing should display proper agreement, matching singular
subjects with singular verbs and plural subjects with plural verbs. You’re more likely to
encounter comprehension questions that involve interpreting tense and mood, so I concen-
trate on those two issues here.
Tense
Tense, in Grammar World, doesn’t mean “nervous,” though interpreting verb tense can cer-
tainly put you in that state of mind. Verb tense refers to time — past, present, and future.
Most people with a good grasp of the English language already understand the basic tenses,
but a couple of picky points (and the AP test is the Queen of Pickiness) may confuse you.
“Had” as a time clue
“Had,” all by itself, expresses ownership or possession, as in “I had three thumbs.” But “had”
tacked onto another verb places actions further in the past than past-tense verbs without
“had.” In case anyone out there actually enjoys grammar terms, let me explain that “had”
creates past perfect tense. You don’t have to know that term: Forget it immediately!
Here’s an example of “had” in action. Imagine that a sentence describes two actions: selling
tickets and learning that the tickets are counterfeit. You can explain what happened in two
ways:
When Mary learned about the counterfeit tickets, she sold 500.
When Mary learned about the counterfeit tickets, she had sold 500.
The first sentence makes Mary a crook, because the two actions take place more or less at
the same time. Mary knowingly sells fake tickets. The second sentence lets Mary off the
hook, because the “had” places the ticket sales before Mary learns that they’re fake. She sold
500 tickets and then found out that the tickets weren’t legitimate. One little word — “had” —
makes all the difference.
Under certain circumstances, forms of the helping verb “have” function in a similar way, plac-
ing one action before another. See “The tense of verbals” in this section for more information.
83
Chapter 7: Not Just for Nerds: Grammar Skills

“Has” and “Have” as a connection between past and present
The verbs “has” and “have,” when they’re not expressing ownership or possession, connect
past and present. In grammatical terms, these helpers create present perfect tense. Again, you
don’t have to know the name of the tense, but you do have to know how “has” and “have”
affect meaning. Take a look at these two sentences:
Mary taught the art of counterfeiting for 20 years.
Mary has taught the art of counterfeiting for 20 years.
The first sentence is firmly rooted in the past. “Mary taught,” but she’s not teaching now.
(She’s probably in the penitentiary for fraud.) The second sentence is completely different; it
means that she taught counterfeiting in the past and she’s still teaching it now. (Perhaps the
penitentiary is in her future.)
“Will have” or “shall have” as a deadline
The helping verb “will” places actions in the future, as in “I will shred my English notes after
taking the AP.” “Shall” performs the same function, though it’s rarely used these days. (On
the AP exam, which includes many old passages, “shall” appears regularly.) A sentence with
“have” tacked onto a future verb implies or states a deadline. Notice the different meanings
of these two sentences: 
During the AP exam, Sam will stick a hundred seals onto his test booklets. (Taking the
exam and sticking seals occur at the same time.)
By the time the AP exam is over, Sam will have stuck a hundred seals onto his test book-
lets. (Seal-sticking happens before the exam ends.)
Both sentences talk about the future, but the second one places one action before another. 
In the preceding examples, I made the “deadline” obvious by stating “by the time the exam is
over.” On the AP exam, the passage may be more subtle. Remember that “will have” places
events at different points in the future, and interpret the meaning correctly.
The tense of verbals
The topic of verbals is thick with grammar terminology, but I promise to spare you as much
as possible. Verbals are half-verb, half something else (usually adjectives or adverbs). The
verb half of a verbal gives it the ability to express time, because verbs have tense. The other
half gives a verbal the ability to describe. I explain description problems in “Modifying
Habits”; here I tackle tense.
The words “has,” “have,” and “having,” when they’re tacked onto a verbal, affect the time
indicated. Check out some verbals in action. The verbals are underlined, and the meaning is
described in parentheses:
Singing “Happy Birthday to You,” the waiter brought the cake to Lucy. (Two actions,
singing and bringing the cake, happened at the same time.)
Having sung “Happy Birthday to You,” the waiter brought the cake to Lucy. (The waiter
finished singing and then brought the cake.)
It’s nice to meet you. (I feel good about being introduced to you now.)
It’s nice to have met you. (This sentence implies another action, such as “I’m glad that I
met you before we pronounce our wedding vows, or something like that.)
Got the picture? The plain verbals (without helping verbs “has,” “have,” or “having”) express
simultaneous actions. The verbals with helpers place one action before another.
84
Part II: The Writer’s Toolkit 

You won’t see a question about verbals on the AP exam, but your comprehension of a pas-
sage may depend upon decoding their tense.
Present tense for literature
When you write about literature (and every passage you see on the AP exam falls into that
category), use present tense. Why? Because the written word is immortal. Every time I read
Jonathan Swift’s satire, “A Modest Proposal,” he’s speaking to me “live,” even though he’s
been dead for centuries. When I open Pride and Prejudice, the Bennet girls are single women
in search of husbands, despite the fact that most of them find mates by the end of the book.
Thus, when you write about a passage in an analysis or synthesis essay, use present tense in
referring to the author’s words:
Michaels advocates a uniform national curriculum. (“advocates,” not “advocated”)
In the first paragraph, the author takes a critical stance. (“takes,” not “took”)
When you write about history or something you experienced or witnessed, past tense is
appropriate. For example, you may say that “The seniors were given a wide range of topics”
if that action took place in the past. You may also mix present and past when you write about
a historical passage — present tense for statements about the passage and past tense for
statements about history, as in this sentence: “The seniors were given a wide range of topics,
a choice which Michaels opposes in his essay on curriculum.” 
Mood
They’re not elated, irritable, or sulky, but verbs do have moods. In fact, they have three —
indicative, imperative, and subjunctive. None of these terms are important, and the first two
aren’t likely to cause any problems. (In case you’re curious, the indicative mood is the one
you use to make ordinary statements or to ask questions. Just about every verb in this book
is in indicative mood. The imperative mood gives commands, as in “brush your teeth thor-
oughly” and similar remarks.) In terms of grammar errors and comprehension issues on the
AP exam, subjunctive mood is where all the action is.
The subjunctive mood expresses an indirect command or a condition that’s contrary to fact.
Here are a few examples, with the verbs in subjunctive mood underlined:
The proctor decreed that everyone be quiet during the exam. (indirect command)
Had I known that talking was forbidden, I would have spoken more before the test.
(condition contrary to fact)
If I had received the memo about silence, I would have protested to the AP Coordinator.
(condition contrary to fact)
If the proctor were fair, she would have given us 15 minutes to yell before the exam.
(condition contrary to fact)
Do you see how the subjunctive can change the usual subject-verb pair? In the first example
sentence, “everyone” is the subject of “be.” In a normal sentence (that is, a sentence in the
indicative mood), “everyone” pairs with “is,” as in “everyone is here.” In the fourth sentence,
the subject “proctor” ordinarily partners “was.” Here “proctor” links up with “were.” The
altered verb tips you off to the subjunctive mood.
Sometimes the subjunctive mood doesn’t alter the usual subject-verb pair, as in the second
and third sentences in the preceding set of examples. The key to recognizing subjunctive in
these sentences is the “would have” expression. Condition-contrary-to-fact sentences always
contain these expressions.
85
Chapter 7: Not Just for Nerds: Grammar Skills

If you run across an indirect-command subjunctive sentence on the AP exam, it probably
won’t cause any problems for you. This sort of sentence probably sounds right to you, and
it’s not likely that you’ll misunderstand its meaning. A “condition contrary to fact” statement,
however, may be unfamiliar to you and may easily be misread. The first part of sentence two
declares, “I didn’t know talking was forbidden.” The subjunctive verb in sentence three firmly
states that I didn’t receive the memo. Similarly, sentence four states that the proctor wasn’t
fair. As you see, the subjunctive mood in a condition-contrary-to-fact sentence expresses
what isn’t true. Just to be clear, notice how each sentence in this pair — containing one
indicative and one subjunctive verb — differs in meaning:
SUBJUNCTIVE: If Abby were elected, the ballot box would be in a museum. (Abby wasn’t
elected, and the ballot box is in the garbage.)
INDICATIVE: If Abby was elected, the ballot box would be in a museum. (Nobody knows
whether Abby was elected or not. The proof is in the ballot box. If you find it in a museum,
she’s president. If not, she’s toast.)
Keep your eye out for condition-contrary-to-fact subjunctive statements. Remember that the
meaning is reversed by the subjunctive verb.
Turning Pro with Pronouns
Pronouns are small words that take the place of nouns. They solve a lot of problems by elimi-
nating repetitions; no one wants to hear that “Roberta took Roberta’s shoes to the shoe-
maker so that the shoemaker could fix the shoes” because “Roberta took her shoes to the
shoemaker so that he could fix them” sounds better. Pronouns also get you out of some
incriminating situations (“Someone broke the window” is less likely to get your brother
grounded than “Larry broke the window.”)
Sadly, pronouns also cause a fair number of problems. This isn’t a grammar text, so I won’t
explain all the rules governing pronouns. (The tax code is shorter than the list of pronoun
rules, and I have only a few pages to devote to this topic.) Instead, I focus on situations you
may encounter: identifying pronoun antecedents (in passages provided by the test makers),
providing antecedents for all your pronouns (in your own essays), and avoiding ambiguous
pronouns (also in your own essays).
Antecedents
A pronoun’s antecedent is the word a pronoun refers to. (I know! More grammar terms. Please
feel free to forget this word the minute the AP is over — unless you’re planning to take the
AP English Literature and Composition test also, in which case hang onto “antecedent” a
little longer.) Here are a few facts about antecedents that you can mention during parties,
assuming of course that you want to clear the room faster than a raging fire.
Pronoun-antecedent agreement
No, I’m not talking about friends agreeing where to have dinner. “Agreement,” in English-
teacher land, refers to singular and plural forms. Singular pairs with singular, and plural with
plural. Take a look at these example sentences. I’ve underlined the pronouns and antecedents:
Roger wrote a 20-page essay, but he didn’t do his science homework. (singular)
The lab reports were very boring, so Robert blew them off. (plural)
The homework that Anjelica hates is never completed. (singular)
86
Part II: The Writer’s Toolkit 

Marcy is the only one of the girls who likes English. (singular)
Gene is one of the boys who like recess. (plural)
The first three sentences are straightforward. The last two sentences aren’t so simple. The
same pronoun, in almost the same sentence construction, is singular in one sentence and
plural in another. The difference is the word “only.” How many girls like English? According
to sentence four, only Marcy, so “who” must refer to “one.” The last sentence states that sev-
eral boys like recess, so “who” refers to “boys.”
How can you tell whether a pronoun is singular or plural? Common knowledge of the lan-
guage sorts “she” from “they” and “I” from “we.” But pronouns such as “who,” “that,” “those,”
“these,” and “which” can be either singular or plural. A proper sentence provides a clue: the
verb that’s paired with the pronoun. In the preceding set, the sentence about Marcy’s dislike
for English pairs “who” with “likes,” a singular verb. Therefore, “who” has to be singular,
because singular and plural don’t mix in grammar world. In the sentence about Gene, “who”
pairs with “like,” a plural verb. Hence “who” is plural in that sentence. When you’re identify-
ing a pronoun’s antecedent (a common AP question), check the verb to figure out whether
you’re searching for a singular or plural antecedent.
The no-verb rule
Pronouns are supposed to take the place of nouns and other pronouns. That’s it! Verbs are
off-limits. Technically, this sentence commits a grammatical felony:
Ariel signed up for eight AP exams, which is a bad idea.
The pronoun “which” is supposed to sub for a noun or a pronoun, but here it appears to
refer to the fact that Ariel signed up for eight AP exams. Penalty box! The no-verb rule helps
you when you’re antecedent-hunting, because you can rule out everything but nouns and
pronouns. Also, engrave the no-verb rule on your brain so that you’ll remember to apply this
principle when you’re writing essays. One misapplied pronoun won’t sink your essay, but it
won’t help you either. Remember, your grader is a no-life English teacher who cares about
this kind of thing.
In a multiple-choice question about antecedents, the answers may include descriptive words
attached to the antecedent. Descriptions don’t violate the no-verb rule, so long as the pronoun
clearly refers to a noun or to another pronoun. For example, even if the actual antecedents are
“exam” and “proctor,” a correct answer choice may be “the boring exam” or “the proctor who
cried when the test was over.” 
Location
An antecedent is generally very close to the pronoun it replaces, usually in the same sen-
tence. However, the pronoun and its antecedent may be several sentences apart, so long as
the meaning is clear. In your own essays, try to keep these teams together. You’re more likely
to choose the correct pronoun if the antecedent is staring right at you. In AP passages, roam
a little until you’re sure you’ve picked the correct word.
Ambiguity
The goal of writing is communication, and communication falters when a pronoun is vague.
Your essays suffer when you throw in a sentence like this one:
The biographer reports that her subject says she is too passionate about conserving
energy. 
87
Chapter 7: Not Just for Nerds: Grammar Skills

Who’s too passionate? Did the biographer report, “My subject says I am too passionate
about conserving energy”? Or does the text read: “‘I am too passionate about energy,’ com-
mented Olga Centrova.” You can’t tell because the pronoun “she” may refer to Olga or to the
biographer. The moral of the story: Be sure the antecedent of every pronoun is clear. 
A common mistake that grates on English teachers’ nerves as much as chalk squeaking on a
blackboard shows up in a sentence like this:
In the passage it says that Olga hates fluorescent lightbulbs.
The pronoun “it” has no real antecedent. The passage doesn’t talk, so it can’t say anything.
A better version of this sentence is as follows:
According to the passage, Olga hates fluorescent lightbulbs.
As you see, sometimes the solution to a pronoun-antecedent problem is to rewrite the sen-
tence without any pronouns at all. 
No Math, but Plenty of Parallels
Parallelism sounds like the two evenly spaced lines that you draw in geometry class. But in
grammar, parallelism is a principle that requires elements with the same function in a sen-
tence to have the same identity. Take a look at this list: “friendly,” “compassionate,” “in a
hurry.” These are three perfectly good descriptions, but not when they’re used like this:
Tom is friendly, compassionate, and in a hurry.
The three function as complements, but “friendly” and “compassionate” are adjectives and
“in a hurry” is a phrase. (Don’t let the grammar terminology scare you. Even without the
labels, you can hear the mismatch.) Here’s the correct sentence:
Tom is friendly, compassionate, and hurried. 
You might also say, “friendly, compassionate, and pressed for time.” The phrase “for time”
doesn’t affect the parallelism because “pressed,” the adjective, conveys the main idea. The
phrase is just an added description.
Parallel elements can be short (as you see in the preceding example) or lengthy, as in this
example:
That he was tired, that his soul was lost, that his belly was empty, and that his feet were
numb with walking were all that he knew.
The complexity of this sentence takes it closer to AP Land. All the “that” statements are
clauses, and all function as subjects of the verb “were.” A multiple-choice question about
parallelism might ask you the purpose of the parallel elements or might identify one ele-
ment and ask you what is parallel to it. In the latter type of question, the parallel element
may be in a different sentence. (For more information on the way that parallel elements
affect the reader’s perception of meaning, turn to Chapter 5.)
88
Part II: The Writer’s Toolkit 

Modifying Habits
Descriptive words or phrases are also called modifiers because they change, or modify, the
meaning of whatever word they’re describing. Modifiers, which are members of either the
adjective or the adverb family, come in all shapes and sizes, and they move around some-
what in the sentence. Here are some examples, with the descriptive elements (the modifiers)
underlined. In the first set, notice how each modifier from the adjective family changes your
perception of the noun “dress.” In the second set, keep your eye on the verb “wear” in all its
forms and the adverbial modifier attached to it:
The blue dress that Mary purchased last week is pretty. Made of silk, the dress seems
fragile. The dress in the closet, on the other hand, is sturdier.
Alex wore his suit to the job interview to make a good impression. Whenever Alex is out
of work, he wears old clothes. Alex has frequently worn jeans to business dinners.
As you see, adjectival descriptions may appear before or after the word described or follow-
ing a verb expressing state of being (usually a form of the verb “to be” or a synonym such as
“seem” or “appear”). Adverbial modifiers pop up all over the place.
Though these descriptive elements roam around, they must follow some rules:
 If a sentence begins with a verbal — an element that looks like a verb but acts like a
description — the action or state of being in the verbal describes the subject of the
sentence. In the first example set above, “made of silk” describes “dress.” 
 This section is about descriptions, but I’ll stretch the topic a little to fit in a good point
about introductory clauses because they’re similar to the introductory verbals I dis-
cuss in the preceding bullet. When a subject is implied but not stated in an introduc-
tory clause, the subject of the sentence that is stated must also be the implied subject.
Here’s an example:
When driving, Ellie shifts gears roughly.
“Ellie,” the subject you see, pairs with the verb “shifts.” However, “Ellie” is also the sub-
ject of “driving,” or more specifically, “is driving.” (The “is” and the “Ellie” are implied.)
In other words, the sentence actually means “When Ellie is driving, Ellie shifts gears
roughly.”
 Descriptions should be near the words they modify. If you place descriptions too far
away, you may end up with a meaning you didn’t intend, as in this example:
The dump truck full of garbage that we bought at the used-truck dealership has
already broken down.
As the sentence reads now, the modifier “that we bought at the used-truck dealership”
modifies garbage. The truck may be a lemon, but I doubt that the writer meant to say
that the dealership sold the garbage that’s in the dump truck. A bit of revision fixes the
sentence:
The dump truck that we bought at the used-truck dealership is full of garbage,
and it has broken down.

Chapter 7: Not Just for Nerds: Grammar Skills

 All descriptions must be clear. If a description may refer to more than one thing, you
have to move it. For instance, suppose you write this sentence:
Dresses that are folded frequently have wrinkles.
The problem lies with the word “frequently.” Because of its position, “frequently” may
modify “folded” or “have wrinkles.” So you don’t know whether folding a dress just one
time causes wrinkles or whether frequent folding is necessary for wrinkling. The sen-
tence can go either way. To solve the problem, move the description (and change it as
necessary):
Frequent folding causes dresses to wrinkle.
Check descriptions (modifiers) when you’re working on your essays or decoding an AP pas-
sage. Modifiers add a lot of meaning to writing.
Punctuating Your Way to a Five
The five, of course, is the highest score on the AP test. I exaggerate in the heading; you can’t
get to a five solely on punctuation. However, a good understanding of punctuation can improve
your score in two ways. Properly punctuated essays impress graders, and poorly punctuated
work has the opposite effect. Also, punctuation affects meaning, so decoding punctuation in
the passages on the exam improves your reading comprehension. Note: In this section I dis-
cuss commas and semicolons. For information on quotation marks, turn to Chapter 16. For an
explanation of punctuation in citations (source references), see Chapter 13.
Many AP passages come from earlier time periods, when the rules of punctuation were differ-
ent and many more commas and semicolons were used. Modern works tend toward an “open
style,” with fewer commas and semicolons. Also, British punctuation practice differs slightly
from American usage. Don’t be surprised to see “broken rules” in an old passage or in one by
a British author.
Commas
I can’t review all the comma rules here because if I did, you’d be bored out of your mind.
Furthermore, you’d have to cart this book around with a forklift. But understanding how
commas work with essential and nonessential elements of a sentence is important — and
likely to show up on your AP exam.
Essential and nonessential elements have several possible grammatical identities, but gener-
ally they function as descriptions. As the names imply, an essential element is necessary, like
the wheels on a car. Without the essential element, the meaning of the sentence changes. No
commas separate an essential element from the rest of the sentence. A nonessential element
is extra — like a sunroof or four-speaker sound system. Take the nonessential element away,
and the statement says the same thing, though with less detail. Commas separate nonessen-
tial elements from the rest of the sentence. (The comma resembles a little handle that lifts a
nonessential element out of the sentence.) Here are a couple of example sets, with the essen-
tial or nonessential elements underlined:
The bus drivers who failed the eye test are on strike. (essential)
The bus drivers, who are demanding health coverage for prescription eyeglasses, are on
strike. (nonessential)
90
Part II: The Writer’s Toolkit 

Shakespeare’s play As You Like It is a comedy. (essential)
As You Like It, a Shakespearean play, is a comedy. (nonessential)
In the example set discussing bus drivers, each sentence talks about a different group. The
first sentence references a subgroup; only the drivers who failed the eye test are on strike.
The drivers who passed the test are working. The second sentence says that all bus drivers
are on strike. The information between the commas provides a reason, but if you lift it out of
the sentence, you still learn the main idea: that the bus drivers are striking. Keep an eye out
for essential/nonessential information when you’re decoding an AP passage.
The example set referring to Shakespeare’s play is subtler. Shakespeare wrote more than
thirty plays, so when I say “Shakespeare’s play,” you’re waiting for me to tell you which one.
Therefore, the title (As You Like It) is essential, because you don’t know which work I’m talk-
ing about until I give the name. No commas appear because the essential element is woven
into the sentence and can’t be lifted out. The second sentence in the set reverses the pattern.
Right away you know the title of the play I’m discussing: As You Like It. The attribution to
Shakespeare is extra, though nice to know. 
No grader expects perfect punctuation from a time-stressed AP test-taker. However, in non-
timed situations (essays or reports for your school courses), get in the habit of justifying
every comma you insert. Once proper punctuation becomes second nature, you’ll automati-
cally place commas where they’re needed and omit them where they’re not.
Semicolons
A period ends a sentence, but a comma doesn’t. A semicolon (;) is half period, half comma.
Therefore, a semicolon slows the reader down more than a comma but doesn’t stop the
reader entirely. A semicolon tells you to wait — just a moment — because more information
related to what you just read is about to appear. Related, but not exactly the same: A semi-
colon shifts into a new phase, but a phase that’s very close in meaning to the previous one.
Check out this example:
AP exams are more than three hours long; a petition to shorten these tests is circulating.
The second half of the sentence is tied to the first half by the issue of time. The first half tells
you how long you have to sit and pour your brains out. The second half explains that stu-
dents are agitating for shorter tests. The semicolon shows you a shift, but not a complete
new direction.
Semicolons also show up, especially in older works, before a conjunction such as “and,”
“but,” “nor,” and “or.” Here’s the deal: Usually a comma precedes a conjunction, when the
conjunction links two complete sentences, as in this example:
The petition is unlikely to influence the College Board, but the petitioners intend to try
anyway.
If one of the complete sentences already contains a comma, the comma before the conjunc-
tion gets a promotion and becomes a semicolon. Why? Because the comma before the con-
junction doesn’t like to blend in. It has the important job of signaling the arrival of a new
idea. Check out this example:
When the petition arrives at the office, the administration will decide what to do with it;
but a shorter AP is years away.
91
Chapter 7: Not Just for Nerds: Grammar Skills

Note: Lots of very well-educated people don’t know this rule, so you may not see it in action,
and you may ignore it yourself, if you wish. (Reread the previous sentence. I ignored the rule!
I explain it here so that you’re not surprised if you encounter such a sentence on the test.)
One more point about semicolons: they separate items on a list if (and only if) at least one of
the items has a comma in it. Here’s an example:
The narrator urges his reader to visit Paris, France; London, England; and Madrid, Spain.

Worth a Thousand Words: 
Visual Literacy
In This Chapter
 Interpreting cartoons, photos, drawings, and advertisements
 Reading charts and graphs
A
s I write this paragraph in a coffee shop in Manhattan, the woman sharing my table
thumbs through the latest issue of a fashion magazine. A fellow two tables over surfs
the Net; despite the distance, the wildly colored ads popping up on his screen catch my
attention. Throughout the afternoon, random customers have glanced at photos on their
cell phones or gazed at the digital displays or billboards on the street. New York may be a
“city that doesn’t sleep,” but it’s also a city that takes visual media seriously.
You should too. The synthesis essay, which made its debut in 2007, includes at least one
visual source: a drawing, photo, cartoon, advertisement, chart, or graph. If you choose
a visual as one of your required three sources (see Chapter 16 for more information),
you must know how to interpret it. But even when the AP exam is finished, visual literacy
matters because these days a huge amount of information is presented partly or solely
through images. This chapter helps you develop skills to handle visual material.
Interpreting What You See, Step by Step
Before I go any further, I admit that somewhere out there, an artist is probably reading this
section and screaming, “Don’t ruin art by overanalyzing it!” Good point, and I sympathize
with the view that art should be seen and not dissected like a frog in a science lab. However,
the act of seeing is complex. By learning how to view an image and interpret related text (if
present), you can actually appreciate the artwork on a deeper level. Think of the suggestions
in this section as a pair of eyeglasses. Put them on when you’re confronted with a drawing,
photo, or advertisement, and the art comes into focus. (Graphs, tables, and charts are
slightly different. See “Data Mining: How to Read Charts, Tables, and Graphs” in this chapter
for more information.)
1. Get an overall impression. 
What do you see? A nobleman, smiling as he looks at his estate? A dog snarfing up
some chow? At first glance, keep it simple and aim for the main idea.
2. Think about what’s included — and perhaps more importantly, what’s missing.
The artist or photographer shapes reality by picking and choosing its content, though
not always consciously. For example, if you see a homelike setting (a dining room or
den, perhaps), you’re probably thinking of family. If no people appear, you may per-
ceive loneliness. Details matter, and you should be conscious of what you’re actually
looking at.

3. Zero in on the picture’s most important element. 
The focus of the work is whatever catches your attention. It may not be in the middle
of the image, despite the fact that a central location is prime real estate. The artist may
manipulate light and dark or relative size to direct your eye toward one spot.
Conversely, notice anything that’s presented as less important, perhaps because it’s
shadowed, small, or hidden in the background. 
The most eye-catching aspect of a visual source is usually an image, but it may be text,
with photos or drawings serving as background or secondary elements. 
4. Consider the values or priorities presented.
Once you know the relative importance of various elements in the image, you know
something about the society that generated it or about the artist’s individual vision.
For example, suppose you’re looking at a picture of a young man leaning on a 1950s car.
If the focus is on the car — it takes up most of the frame or is spotlighted — you know
something about the status such a vehicle conferred on its owner. 
5. Examine style.
Does the visual element mirror reality? Or are you looking at something distorted? You
may be able to relate the style to the content of the image. Imagine a drawing of a
young woman staring in a mirror, seeing herself as larger or smaller than she really is.
The drawing suggests that she has a distorted view of her body, and that message may
be the point of the artwork.
Most people think that photos are the ultimate reality show. You point the camera,
click, and record what you see. But computer software allows the photographer to
change the image. Plus, sophisticated cameras create all sorts of special effects. Also,
ultra-close-ups or wide-angle shots look very different from one another. No doubt
about it — photos have “style” too.
6. Look for symbolic elements.
Once upon a time, artists included specific symbols in their works — a skull to repre-
sent death, a globe to emphasize power (or travel), jewels to signify wealth, and so on.
These traditional symbols still show up from time to time, as well as many contempo-
rary references. 
A stereotype plays upon the human tendency to generalize about large groups of
people. Dumb blonds and mad scientists are stereotypes, as are many common (and
often offensive) images related to race, gender, religion, and ethnicity. Because the test
makers want controversy a little less than they desire a poison-ivy rash, you probably
won’t detect any overt stereotypes in the visual sources on the AP exam. However, you
may find subtle points about identity. I once showed a slide of a famous painting to my
class. “What do you see?” I asked. They went on and on about the mythological refer-
ences, the brushstrokes, the composition, and so on. After 30 minutes, one student
said, “Everyone in that painting is white and male.” Yup. In the time period represented
by that painting, white males held pretty much all the power. That observation opened
a new avenue for discussion.
7. Check for allusions.
An allusion is a reference to an idea, event, or another artistic work. Allusions add
meaning, whether they’re verbal or visual. One memorable allusion was the basis for a
political cartoon drawn after President Kennedy was assassinated. The massive statue
of Abraham Lincoln that sits in the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., usually stares
straight ahead, the arms resting on the chair. After the assassination, the statue was
depicted with its head bowed and its face buried in its hands. Clearly, Lincoln was
weeping — as was the country.

8. Identify the intended audience. 
An advertisement featuring a “new and improved cane — half off if you buy reading
glasses too!” is probably not aimed at teenagers. You can’t always tell who the audience
may be, but try anyway, because the audience may help you deduce the artist’s purpose.
9. If the image contains text, examine how text and image relate to each other. 
The words may alter the way you perceive nonverbal elements, and vice versa.
Decoding a Cartoon
Although cartoons suggest a dose of mindless entertainment in front of the television, this
form of visual art can have a point sharp enough to scratch whatever target it’s aimed at. A
traditional target is politics (and politicians!). Political cartoons are included in nearly every
newspaper, where they make serious points about current events or policy. Figure 8-1 is a
political cartoon that appeared in the nineteenth century, when women were denied the
vote. The cartoon is entitled “The Age of Iron: Man as He Expects to Be.” The artist was react-
ing to activists who demanded women’s suffrage.
Art Resource/Art Resource, NY
The cartoon in Figure 8-1 is visual satire, a form that mocks a point of view or a custom. In
the cartoon, traditional roles are reversed. Men sew and wash and mind the baby, while
women drive off in a carriage. The eye goes immediately to the woman about to enter the
carriage. She’s wealthy (the clothes!) and is literally turning her back on men. The two men
in the cartoon (notice they’re outnumbered) are much smaller than the central female. Their
clothes are light colored, in contrast to the dark dress of the carriage rider. The men have
faded in importance. This image plays into fears that women’s rights diminish men. Also, the
carriage is inside the house — not its natural place. The message is that nature itself will be
reversed if women gain the vote. An interesting aspect of this cartoon is its title. Presumably
that tremendous bustle (the large hump of material the carriage passenger is wearing) is
Figure 8-1:

Chapter 8: Worth a Thousand Words: Visual Literacy

supported by something. Maybe iron? Iron is cold and hard — perhaps echoing the way the
men might feel about their situation in this unnatural, upended world.
Figure 8-2 mocks the way people lock themselves into one way of thinking, ignoring other
and perhaps better possibilities. Drawn in 2008, when gas prices went through the roof, it’s
also a comment on energy policy. 
Cartoon by Sam Goodman
The main message in Figure 8-2 is conveyed by the digger, who ignores the treasure chest
in his search for oil. Notice the small shovel the digger’s using; the absence of the heavy
machinery that oil exploration requires implies that the digger will fail. Now take a close look
at the hole. In the first panel, the hole blends in with other shapes. It’s not emphasized. In the
next three panels, the hole is darker and more prominent. The digger is sinking bit by bit into
the hole, but he’s still not likely to find what he’s looking for. The cartoonist may be suggest-
ing that by relying on oil we’re literally digging ourselves a grave — or at least, a hole that’s
tough to climb out of. The cliff in the first and fourth panels reinforces this message: The
digger has already fallen off a cliff. Significantly, the cliff appears higher and more dominant
in the fourth panel, because the situation is more serious. In the last panel, the treasure
chest (perhaps representing other sources of energy) shares the spotlight. It may be a solu-
tion, but the digger’s too entranced with oil and doesn’t bother opening the chest. The figure
in the hat, which appears in all four panels, may be a stand-in for the audience — the public
that doesn’t know what’s going on and more or less has to accept what they’re told.
Finding Meaning in a Photo
In a recent newspaper article about a drought, I read about rainfall amounts, water rationing,
and global climate trends. One month later, I can’t remember anything about those factors
except that the farmers and residents of the stricken area were struggling because of the lack
of rain. But one thing remains absolutely clear in my mind: a photo of a bridge with a promi-
nent “NO DIVING” sign attached to a railing. The bridge spanned a dusty, absolutely water-
less trench. The photo convinced me of the crisis.
Figure 8-3, a photo by Karen Ellen Johnson, depicts an elderly woman holding fishing gear.
She’s standing in the shade of a tree, with a grassy stretch of land around her and a shad-
owed area of leaves just above her head. She’s wearing a sensible hat, and her clothes are
utilitarian, not fashionable. Her face is framed by the fishing poles, emphasizing the task
(fishing) that she has to accomplish. Now look at her hands; they’re thick and capable, what
hands become after a life of hard work. No luxury or whimsy for her; she hasn’t been pam-
pered. Her legs are slightly apart, and she looks firmly set on the ground. She’s not a
pushover! The expression on her face reinforces the impression of strength. She gazes
directly ahead, unsmiling; she doesn’t have to please anyone.
Figure 8-2:

“Digging for
Treasure.”
96
Part II: The Writer’s Toolkit 

Photo by Karen Ellen Johnson 
Now dig a little deeper into the photo in Figure 8-3. The subject is in a natural setting, and the
vertical lines of her body and of the poles almost make her resemble a tree, or, at the very
least, imply a strong connection with nature. Her slightly shadowed face adds an element of
mystery. The sunny patch across the middle of the photo hints at happiness. The brightest
portion of the photo is at the center, where her heart is. Perhaps the photographer is empha-
sizing the love there, the capacity for feeling. But the darkness overhead implies that the
woman has had troubles too. 
You may worry about reading too much into a photo. Don’t! So long as you can anchor your
interpretation to something that’s actually present in the picture, you’re fine. Artists work at
least partly from their unconscious, the part of the mind that generates symbols, and sym-
bols require interpretation.
Cracking the Advertisement Code
Want to buy some toothpaste, a vacuum cleaner, or a box of strawberries? How about a
toaster? And by the way, are you interested in purchasing a life? A new and improved ver-
sion, of course! If so, you’ve grasped the main idea behind just about every advertisement.
On the surface, an ad sells you a product, but the real message is far more subtle and much
more powerful. 
Figure 8-3:
Photo
entitled
“Fish Story,
1984 – 1993.”
97
Chapter 8: Worth a Thousand Words: Visual Literacy

Check out Figure 8-4. Its purpose is to sell kitchen paint, but really it’s pushing the idea that
having a kitchen resembling the one in the illustration will net you a cheerful spouse, a mar-
riage bond that extends to shared cooking (lots of people would purchase that product!), and
an orderly life. The people are well dressed; nothing splatters or drips in “a kitchen like this.”
The husband and wife have time to talk with each other; they’re smiling, not trying to figure
out who was supposed to pick up the kids from soccer practice.
HIP/Art Resource, NY
Now turn your attention to Figure 8-5. This advertisement, printed in the late nineteenth cen-
tury, alludes to the fact that in that era whale blubber was an ingredient in some soap prod-
ucts (including, presumably, Soapine). Here the emphasis is on strength. The whale dominates
the image, and the oval cleaned by Soapine dominates the whale. Just in case anyone missed
the point, the words “Soapine did it” are written on the clean spot. In the nineteenth century,
whales weren’t the heartwarming creatures they are today, when whale-watching cruises
abound and you can download recordings of whale “songs.” Instead, whales were seen as
strong and dangerous — qualities emphasized in this advertisement. The whale’s mouth is
menacing. No one would want to get caught there! The humans and their vessels (the ship in
the background and the boat in the left foreground) are tiny in comparison to the animal. Yet
the animal is vanquished by Soapine, which can overcome the whale’s natural color and, by
implication, the whale’s strength and ability to threaten humans. The text also refers to
Soapine as “The Dirt Killer.” The link between dirt and illness was established (though not
completely understood) in the nineteenth century. Soapine kills dirt, the ad implies, before
the dirt can kill you.
Finally, take a peek at Figure 8-6. This advertisement was published in the 1920s. (Weren’t the
bathing suits daring? At least they didn’t have to worry about sunblock.) The text commands
the reader to “Take a Kodak with you” for a day of fun at the shore. The children are frolick-
ing, waves are relatively calm, and the clouds in the sky add contrast but not menace. The
central figure is the bathing beauty on a rock. She draws your eye, but you can’t see her face.
She’s the observer, the artist a little removed from the situation and therefore dominant,
because she can shape reality with the camera she holds in the crook of her arm. The ad
promises power to the photographer, plus the fun of beach-going.

Data Mining: How to Read Charts, 
Tables, and Graphs
On the AP English Language and Composition exam, many sources may contain statistics.
The synthesis essay’s visual source — if it’s a chart or graph — revolves around numbers.
First you have to read the source correctly, and then you have to slice and dice the data until
you understand its meaning and how the data supports your argument. (For more informa-
tion on the synthesis essay, see Chapters 16 and 17.)
Charts and tables
A pie chart cuts a circle into pieces, with each piece representing a specific portion of the
whole. A pie chart makes it easy to see how something is shared or distributed — whether
it’s approval or disapproval ratings, membership in various groups, income distribution, or
something else. A table looks like a window with lots of panes. The headings across the top
tell you one classification of information (the year, perhaps), and the headings in the left-
hand column tell you another (percent of graduates going to college, for example). When
you’re reading a chart or table, keep these points in mind:
 The title and caption often supply important information. For example, the caption
may tell you where or how the data were collected (“Income Distribution in Glen Oaks,
2009” or the like).
 Segments of a pie chart or numbers in a table may represent larger amounts. Here’s
where the title or caption comes in handy. A “6” in one slot may not represent an
amount you can count on your fingers. If the caption says, “Number of Americans
who believe they were kidnapped by aliens, in millions” that 6 represents 6,000,000.
 A pie chart is great for helping you see relative importance — who has a bigger stake,
more members, the majority opinion, and so on. 
 A table often has room for more variables than a pie chart. In a pie chart you may see a
breakdown of museum-goers in 2009, for example. In a table, you may see the number
of museum-goers sorted by type of museum (natural history, art, science, and so forth)
during each year from 1998 to 2009.
 Pie charts are hard on the eyes, unless they’re in color. (The AP exam has only black-
and-white visuals, so if they throw a pie chart at you, expect to see striped or shaded
sections instead of colors, as in Figure 8-7.) Sometimes the segments are labeled to
help you distinguish one from another. Read those labels with extra care.
 When reading a table, use the answer sheet to isolate a line and to keep your eyes
level. You don’t want to mistakenly link data from one line with a label from another.
Take a look at Figure 8-7, the product not of an actual survey but of my fevered imagination,
as are all the statistics in this section. If you were writing an essay about AP-exam stress, you
could use this source to prove that no one emerges from an AP test fully sane. Figure 8-8
proves the same point, but you can get a lot more out of the data. For example, the number
of students who prefer to annoy a family member rather than study remains fairly constant,
while watching an octopus video was a one-time phenomenon. (Perhaps an action-hero film
featured an octopus in 2007.) Pencil-point balancing, which is not yet an Olympic sport, and
instant messaging (ditto) have gained in popularity each year.
The caption for Figure 8-8 states that the numbers are “in thousands.” If you write that in
2007 twenty-four people watched an octopus video when they were supposed to be studying,
you’re misinterpreting the chart.

Graphs
When I was in elementary school (so long ago that I actually had an inkwell in my desk), I
drew graphs for math class. Bar graphs were my favorite. I loved drawing long skinny rectan-
gles and coloring them in, representing how much money my school had raised in its charity
drive or comparing subscribers to the local newspapers. Bar graphs almost felt as if they
belonged to art class. Line graphs, on the other hand — with their spiky or curved lines indi-
cating changes in enrollment, stock prices, and the like — were strictly math. Now, because
they may be included on the AP English Language and Composition exam, both types of
graphs have moved over into my favorite subject. (Yes, it’s English.)
To read a bar graph, check the horizontal and vertical axis — the side-to-side and the up-and-
down lines. Both will be labeled. Then look at the bars. Where is it situated on the horizontal
axis? Its location gives you one piece of information. How high does the bar climb on the ver-
tical axis? Now you have another piece of information. The same procedure holds true for

line graphs, though instead of bars you have a line. (Big surprise, huh?) To interpret a line
graph, place your finger at a spot on the graphed line. Now sketch a straight line from that
spot to the horizontal axis and another line from that spot to the vertical axis. Where your
sketched line crosses an axis, note the number. Now you have two numbers to work with.  
Read all labels very carefully. An axis may be labeled “Funds Spent, in Billions” or “Funds
Spent, in Thousands.” Carelessly confusing these two labels means that the data you cite in
your essay will be off — way off!
Sometimes bar graphs use paired or even triplet bars, each representing a different group
(ninth graders and tenth graders, for instance). Bars in this sort of graph will be colored dif-
ferently, with one bar lightly shaded or striped and another darkened completely.
Need some practice interpreting graphs? Check out Figure 8-9 and Figure 8-10, both of which
contain the same information. As you see in these figures, lots of students found AP exam ques-
tions boring. (I’m sure you’ll find them fascinating!) 
In these (completely fictional) graphs, the number of bored students rose steadily until 2005
and then tapered off. In 2003, for example, 130,000 students protested. In 2005, 170,000 stu-
dents were bored. By 2009, only 70,000 exam-takers were yawning. If you were using one of
these graphs as a source, you could make the case that the exam-writers listened to students’
complaints and responded to their concerns from 2005 onward. (You could also make the
case that students just gave up.)

o extract maximum meaning from a piece of writing, 
dissect it and peer at it through a lens. Actually, through
a couple of lenses, because there’s more than one way to
slice and dice literature. One lens shows you how words are
put together and what structures and devices writers use to
convey meaning. That’s the lens I provide in Part II. In this
part, I snap on a wide-angle lens, so you can examine the
four biggest classifications of writing — narrative, descrip-
tion, argument, and exposition. I also devote chapters to 
the genres that appear frequently on the exam — essays,
biographies and memoirs, letters, and speeches. I throw in a
chapter on source citations, which you must create and
interpret on the AP test.

The Big Four: Modes of Discourse
In This Chapter
 Examining the four major modes of writing
 Becoming familiar with the characteristics of each mode
 Analyzing sample passages
D
on’t let the title throw you: modes of discourse is just a fancy way of saying “types of
writing.” Your teacher, by the way, may use a different term. Don’t panic. The term
“modes of discourse” isn’t important. What’s important is that you comprehend the charac-
teristics of narrative, description, argument, and exposition. You move seamlessly from one
to another in your conversation and in your writing every day. For example, you relate how
you went to the mall and, on your way to buy dog food, rescued a toddler who had jumped
into a fountain (narrative). Next you go over every single detail of the perfect sports car you
saw afterwards (description) and explain why you have to have that vehicle or live in social
Siberia for the rest of your life (argument). Finally, you present information on car financing;
a ten years’ advance on your allowance plus a small, interest-free loan will cover the cost
(exposition).
These modes of discourse often overlap, because no writer wants to be tied down unneces-
sarily. However, each mode comes with a set of customs (conventions). This chapter is a
guide to those customs so that when you encounter these modes of discourse on the AP
exam, you’ll know what to look for in every passage.
Tell Me a Story: Narrative Passages
Once upon a time, gruesome monsters — oops, I mean the AP test makers — placed a narra-
tive, or story-telling passage, on the exam. Courageous heroes — sorry, test takers — read
and analyzed the passage and . . . well, you know this story. It ends with truth, justice, violin
music, and a five on the AP. Okay, I’m kidding about the monsters, though you can be a hero
and you can achieve a five on the AP, especially if you pay attention to these characteristics
of a narrative passage:
 A narrative passage relates a series of events. Especially on the time-limited AP, you
don’t always get the entire story, but you should have enough information to figure out
what happens.
 Narrative mode shows up in both fiction and nonfiction, where it’s prominent in mem-
oirs and biography. 
 The events in a narrative passage are not always in chronological (time) order. The
author may flashback or flash forward or may hop around the calendar.
Whenever you encounter a shift (a change) in time order, take out your magnifying
glass. Good authors shift for a reason — to highlight cause and effect, to foreshadow
future events, to allow an older voice to comment on youthful habits, and so forth.
Resolve to determine the reason for every shift in chronology.

 Narrative frequently appears in third-person point of view (when the author talks about
the events), but first-person point of view (the “I” narration) is a common choice also.
Third-person gives the appearance of impartiality and detachment, but in reality an
author always shapes material to manipulate the reader’s reaction. (Go to Chapter 5 for
more on point of view.)
 In fiction, first-person point of view relies on a narrator to tell the story. The reader
often knows more about the situation than the narrator does. In that gap lies irony. 
 In nonfiction memoirs or autobiography, first-person is the author’s voice. However, all
authors slant even factual material by choosing what to record, what to leave out, and
how to tell the story. 
 A helpful literary term in writing about first-person narrative is persona — the charac-
ter the author creates to represent him- or herself. This term acknowledges that the “I”
in a narrative is an artistic creation.
The narrator may have a split personality — a younger self who experienced the
events that the older self is relating or evaluating.
 Measure the relative importance of events by comparing how many sentences the
author devotes to each. What’s highlighted sometimes gives you a clue to the author’s
purpose and attitude.
 Narrative passages often include dialogue or report the narrator’s thoughts. The diction
(word choice) of direct or indirect quotations affects the reader’s perception. (See
Chapter 4 for more information on diction.)
Time to pick apart a narrative passage. Here’s an excerpt from James Weldon Johnson’s The
Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man in which the narrator describes a spelling bee. As you
read Johnson’s work, consider how the narrative is put together. On scrap paper or in the
margins, note the events that happen, character traits of the people mentioned (including
the narrator), and everything you notice about writing technique. Then compare your com-
ments to mine, which follow the passage. (No peeking.)
[B]y skillful maneuvering I had placed myself third and had piloted “Red Head” to the
place next to me. The teacher began by giving us the words corresponding to our order
in the line. “Spell ‘first.’” “Spell ‘second.’” “Spell ‘third.’” I rattled off: “T-h-i-r-d, third,” in a
way which said: “Why don’t you give us something hard?” As the words went down the
line, I could see how lucky I had been to get a good place together with an easy word.
As young as I was, I felt impressed with the unfairness of the whole proceeding when
I saw the tailenders going down before “twelfth” and “twentieth,” and I felt sorry for
those who had to spell such words in order to hold a low position. “Spell ‘fourth.’” “Red
Head,” with his hands clutched tightly behind his back, began bravely: “F-o-r-t-h.” 
Like a flash a score of hands went up, and the teacher began saying: “No snapping of fin-
gers, no snapping of fingers.” This was the first word missed, and it seemed to me that
some of the scholars were about to lose their senses; some were dancing up and down on
one foot with a hand above their heads, the fingers working furiously, and joy beaming all
over their faces; others stood still, their hands raised not so high, their fingers working
less rapidly, and their faces expressing not quite so much happiness; there were still
others who did not move or raise their hands, but stood with great wrinkles on their fore-
heads, looking very thoughtful. The whole thing was new to me, and I did not raise my
hand, but slyly whispered the letter “u” to “Red Head” several times. “Second chance,”
said the teacher. The hands went down and the class became quiet. “Red Head,” his face
now red, after looking beseechingly at the ceiling, then pitiably at the floor, began very
haltingly: “F-u--” Immediately an impulse to raise hands went through the class, but the
teacher checked it, and poor “Red Head,” though he knew that each letter he added only
took him farther out of the way, went doggedly on and finished: “--r-t-h.” 
108
Part III: Meeting the Major Players: Types of Writing Found on the Exam 

The hand-raising was now repeated with more hubbub and excitement than at first. Those
who before had not moved a finger were now waving their hands above their heads.
“Red Head” felt that he was lost. He looked very big and foolish, and some of the scholars
began to snicker. His helpless condition went straight to my heart, and gripped my sympa-
thies. I felt that if he failed, it would in some way be my failure. I raised my hand, and,
under cover of the excitement and the teacher’s attempts to regain order, I hurriedly shot
up into his ear twice, quite distinctly: “F-o-u-r-t-h, f-o-u-r-t-h.” The teacher tapped on her
desk and said: “Third and last chance.” The hands came down, the silence became
oppressive. “Red Head” began: “F--” Since that day I have waited anxiously for many a turn
of the wheel of fortune, but never under greater tension than when I watched for the order
in which those letters would fall from Red’s lips “--o-u-r-t-h.” A sigh of relief and disappoint-
ment went up from the class. Afterwards, through all our school days, “Red Head” shared
my wit and quickness and I benefited by his strength and dogged faithfulness.
The events in this narrative are uncomplicated and presented in strict chronological order,
though you have the sense that the narrator is looking back as an adult at events he partici-
pated in as a child. The end of the passage “flash-forwards” to “all our school days.” Nearly
everything in the narrative takes place within a few minutes. The narrator and the boy he
calls “Red Head” are friends. Red Head stumbles over the spelling of “fourth.” The narrator
whispers the answer to Red Head and saves the day for his friend. The way the events unfold
adds tension to a simple scene. Notice that the narrator’s whisper of “u” to Red Head leads to
another spelling error. When Red Head finally understands the answer, the author builds sus-
pense by separating the “f” from the “ourth.” Throughout the third and fourth paragraphs,
the narrator’s (and therefore the reader’s) focus shifts from the class to Red Head and back
several times. These shifts emphasize the antagonistic relationship between Red Head and
the other kids. Because the passage is written in first person, the voice you hear is the narra-
tor’s. His outsider status (he says the spelling bee was “new” to him) allows him to observe
and gives him, for a time, the appearance of objectivity. By the end of the passage, however,
he sees his own fate entwined with Red Head’s.
The author’s use of detail reveals character. Red Head is nervous, probably because he’s not
a good student. His hands are “clutched tightly behind his back,” and after he gets a clue
from the narrator, his face turns red and he looks “beseechingly at the ceiling, then pitiably
at the floor.” He speaks “haltingly” and keeps at it “doggedly.” Later the narrator says that
Red Head “looked very big and foolish,” but he rewards the narrator throughout their school
days with “strength and dogged faithfulness.” The narrator, on the other hand, is a better stu-
dent; he says at the end of the passage that he “shared [his] wit and quickness” with Red
Head. The narrator also manipulates the spelling bee line so that Red Head is next to him.
Clearly, the narrator knows that Red Head will need him — and the narrator will need Red
Head. (The reference to “strength” implies that Red Head is physically stronger than the nar-
rator.) The narrator also cares for Red Head; he’s often “waited anxiously for many a turn of
the wheel of fortune, but never under greater tension” than while waiting for Red Head to
answer. The third “character” in this narrative is the rest of the class, which comes across
almost as an aggressive mob. The students raise their hands “like a flash” when Red Head
makes a mistake, and “some were dancing up and down on one foot with a hand above their
heads, their fingers working furiously” to attract the teacher’s attention. The “joy beaming all
over their faces” contrasts with the narrator’s sly whisper of the right answer into Red
Head’s ear.
If you were writing about this passage for an essay or answering multiple-choice questions
about it, your focus would narrow. You’d note only those details that you’re asked about.
Narrative passages draw questions about setting, characterization, purpose, tone, attitude,
and the like.

Painting a Picture: Descriptive Passages
Every year in my writing class, I distribute raisins and ask students to describe them. (The
fun part about this lesson is that you get to eat the subject matter when class is over.)
Typically, each student lists four or five things about the raisins, which I write on the board.
When all the lists are read aloud and duplicates crossed off, about twenty items remain. Yes,
you can say twenty things about a raisin — how the outside is wrinkled and the inside is soft,
that each raisin’s color varies, and . . . I won’t bore you with any more detail, because the
point is clear: Description is trickier than it appears. When you’re reading a descriptive pas-
sage, keep an eye out for these traits:
 A descriptive passage must have an organizing structure — from left to right, top to
bottom, older to newer aspects, whatever. The organizing structure sometimes inter-
acts with the author’s attitude or purpose. For instance, in describing a building by
moving from older features to modern additions, the author reveals an attitude toward
preservation or modernization.
 Visual ability tends to dominate the other senses, so most descriptions are heavy with
visual details. However, many descriptions include sound, smell, taste, and feel.
Because they’re rare, nonvisual details merit extra attention. They may make an
important point about the object or the person described.
 What’s omitted may be even more important than what’s included. I remember a
speech by President John F. Kennedy when he and his wife, along with Vice President
Lyndon Johnson and his spouse, visited France. In response to reporters, Kennedy
described his wife’s elegant clothes. Then he added that no one wanted to know what
“Lyndon and I are wearing.” The absence of that description tells you a lot about
gender roles in the early 1960s. 
 Description is often accomplished with figures of speech (imaginative language such as
personification, metaphors, similes, or others. Figures of speech sometimes add to the
subtext — the underlying theme or meaning — of a work. (Check out Chapter 4 for
more on figures of speech.) For example, a student of mine once described a divider
in an orthodox synagogue as “a border between the nations of men and women.” In
orthodox Judaism, men and women worship separately. The metaphor emphasizes the
separation of sexes.
 Description may be tucked into another type of passage — a narrative or an expository
piece. Many readers skip description, letting their eyes travel to dialogue or explana-
tion. Bad idea! The description contributes to your understanding of theme, purpose,
tone, and other aspects of the work.
Ready for a test-drive? Take this descriptive passage out for a spin. First, note all the sensory
details you’re given (information taken in through the five senses, also known as imagery).
Then figure out what’s emphasized, what’s omitted, and how the words contribute to mean-
ing. Compare your thoughts to mine, which appear after the passage.
Mr Lamont and I walked towards an avenue of oaks, which we observed at a small dis-
tance. The thick shade they afforded us, the fragrance wafted from the woodbines with
which they were encircled, was so delightful, and the beauty of the grounds so very
attracting, that we strolled on, desirous of approaching the house to which this avenue
led. It is a mile and a half in length, but the eye is so charmed with the remarkable verdure
and neatness of the fields, with the beauty of the flowers which are planted all around
them and seem to mix with the quickset hedges, that time steals away insensibly.
When we had walked about half a mile in a scene truly pastoral, we began to think
ourselves in the days of Theocritus, so sweetly did the sound of a flute come wafted
through the air. Never did pastoral swain make sweeter melody on his oaten reed. Our
ears now afforded us fresh attraction, and with quicker steps we proceeded, till we came
110
Part III: Meeting the Major Players: Types of Writing Found on the Exam 

within sight of the musician that had charmed us. Our pleasure was not a little height-
ened, to see, as the scene promised, in reality a shepherd, watching a large flock of
sheep. We continued motionless, listening to his music, till a lamb straying from its fold
demanded his care, and he laid aside his instrument, to guide home the little wanderer.
Curiosity now prompted us to walk on; the nearer we came to the house, the greater we
found the profusion of flowers which ornamented every field. Some had no other defense
than hedges of rose trees and sweetbriars, so artfully planted, that they made a very thick
hedge, while at the lower part, pinks, jonquils, hyacinths, and various other flowers,
seemed to grow under their protection. Primroses, violets, lilies of the valley, and polyan-
thuses enriched such shady spots, as, for want of sun, were not well calculated for the
production of other flowers. The mixture of perfumes which exhaled from this profusion
composed the highest fragrance, and sometimes the different scents regaled the senses
alternately, and filled us with reflections on the infinite variety of nature.
When we were within about a quarter of a mile of the house, the scene became still
more animated. On one side was the greatest variety of cattle, the most beautiful of their
kinds, grazing in fields whose verdure equaled that of the finest turf, nor were they desti-
tute of their ornaments, only the woodbines and jessamine, and such flowers as might
have tempted the inhabitants of these pastures to crop them, were defended with roses
and sweetbriars, whose thorns preserved them from all attacks.
Though Lamont had hitherto been little accustomed to admire nature, yet was he much
captivated with this scene, and with his usual levity cried out, “If Nebuchadnezzar had
such pastures as these to range in, his seven years expulsion from human society might
not be the least agreeable part of his life.”
The organization of this description follows the men’s walk. They begin in an “avenue of oaks”
more than a mile in length. Next they hear the sound of a flute and see a shepherd, followed
by enough flowers to supply every prom in the country. When they’re “within about a quar-
ter mile of the house,” they see cattle, hemmed in by some plants with thorns. Lamont, one
of the walkers, ends the passage by referring to an ancient king exiled from human company.
His punishment “might not be the least agreeable part of his life” if the king had had such
surroundings.
Most of the details are visual, though the author makes a couple of references to scent. It
would be tough to skip the sense of smell in the presence of all those flowers! The most inter-
esting nonvisual detail, however, is the shepherd’s song. As they hear the melody, the men
feel transported to ancient times (the reference to “Theocritus”). This little scene sounds
natural — but it’s not. The shepherd is present to control nature, to “guide home the little
wanderer,” a lamb “straying from its fold.” As you dig into the passage, you realize that this
paragraph embodies the theme of the entire piece: nature is great, so long as human beings
are in charge.
Notice all the references to human intervention. The avenue of oaks leads to the house, so
the trees must have been planted with that route in mind. The observer sees the “neatness
of the fields”; this land has been cultivated. The flowers have been “artfully planted” to make
a “very thick hedge,” with the cattle fields receiving special, thorned plants. The figure of
speech in the first paragraph (the personification of time, which “steals away”) also empha-
sizes human control of nature by turning a natural element (time) into a person. 
Another important item in this description is what doesn’t appear. No mosquitoes bite the
shepherd, and the cattle don’t smell. Only the flowers do! This is idealized nature, not a real
country scene. The idealization is most intense in the last paragraph, when Lamont sees
nature as a fitting substitute for the company of other people. 
When you’re reading a description, notice how the details create tone, mood, and setting.
Analyze the elements of the description to discover purpose or attitude.

Chapter 9: The Big Four: Modes of Discourse

You Win: Argument Passages
Argument on the AP goes way beyond the “Sez who? Sez me!” exchanges common in play-
grounds (and boardrooms, faculty meetings, and even a few courts). Argument passages
present a sophisticated case for a particular point of view. You’re asked to analyze how the
author supports his or her stance, either by answering multiple-choice questions or writing
an essay. Plus, you have to argue for your position in the synthesis essay, and sometimes in
response to another essay question as well. In other words, argument on the AP is a Very Big
Deal. Happily, dissecting an argument essay is easy, as is constructing one yourself. Keep
these points in mind:
 The author’s position (thesis) is usually summed up in one of two places — the begin-
ning or the end of the essay. Look in those two spots, and underline the thesis.
If you can’t find the thesis at the beginning or the end of the essay, it may be implied
instead of stated. After reading the entire passage, formulate a statement that reflects
the author’s stance. That statement, even though it doesn’t appear in the passage,
is the thesis.
 No argument works without evidence. Common types of evidence include statistics,
comments from experts or authorities, or examples. An argument that relies on logic
calls upon what English teachers term logos.
 The author may use his or her own experience or reputation in support of the thesis,
saying something like “you know I don’t usually criticize the administration, but this
time I must speak up” or “serving fourteen years on this committee has taught me
that . . . .” In formal literary language, this sort of argument is called ethos. 
 Most argument passages make a direct appeal to the reader, either via emotions (“Bert
was sad when his guaranteed pay was reduced”) or logic (“Bert has spent more money
after the reduction, because he’s overworked his credit card”). Lit-speak calls emo-
tional appeals pathos.
 Effective arguments take the opposing view into account and answer any valid objec-
tions (a literary technique called concession and reply).
 Not every argument passage plays fair. Be on the alert for coincidence masquerading
as cause and effect, sweeping generalizations, circular reasoning (“It’s great because
it’s by Rembrandt, who’s great”), and unwarranted assumptions (“Everyone knows that
used cars don’t work”).
 A favorite — and unscrupulous — tactic in arguments is to set up a strawman and then
knock him down. A strawman is an easy-to-disprove position, falsely attributed to the
opposing side. 
 Good arguments consider the audience (the readers) and attempt to connect to their
concerns.
Here’s a charming passage arguing the merits of the automobile. Pick it apart, inspecting how
the argument works. Then scan my analysis, located at the end of the passage.
The great point in favor of the automobile is its sociability. Once one was content to
potter about with a solitary companion in a buggy, with a comfortable old horse who
knew his route well by reason of many journeys. Today the automobile has driven
thoughts of solitude to the winds. Two in the tonneau [back seat], and another on the
seat beside you in front — a well-assorted couple of couples — and one may make
the most ideal trips imaginable.
Every one looks straight ahead, there is no uncomfortable twisting and turning as there
is on a boat or a railway train, and each can talk to the others, or all can talk at once,
which is more often the case. It is most enjoyable, plenty to see, exhilarating motion,
112
Part III: Meeting the Major Players: Types of Writing Found on the Exam 

jolly company, absolute independence, and a wide radius of action. What mode of travel
can combine all these joys unless it be ballooning — of which the writer confesses he
knows nothing?
On the road one must ever have a regard for what may happen, and roadside repairs,
however necessary, are seldom more than makeshifts which enable one to arrive at his
destination. If you break the bolt which fastens your cardan-shaft or a link of your side-
chains, you and your friends will have a chance to harden your muscles a bit pushing
the machine to the next village, unless you choose to wait, on perhaps a lonely road, for
a passing cart whose driver is willing, for a price, to detach his tired horse to haul your
dead weight of a ton and a half over a few miles of hill and dale. This is readily enough
accomplished in France, where the peasant looks upon the procedure as a sort of allied
industry to farming, but in parts of England, in Holland, and frequently in Italy, where
the little mountain donkey is the chief means of transportation, it is more difficult.
The question of road speed proves nothing with regard to the worth of an individual
automobile, except that the times do move, and we are learning daily more and more of
the facility of getting about with a motorcar. A locomotive, or a marine engine, moves
regularly without a stop for far greater periods of time than does an automobile, but
each and every time they finish a run they receive such an overhauling as seldom comes
to an automobile.
In England the automobilist has had to suffer a great deal at the hands of ignorant and
intolerant road builders and guardians. Police traps, on straight level stretches miles
from any collection of dwellings, will not keep down speed so long as dangerous cobble-
stoned alleys, winding through suburban London towns, have no guardian to regulate
the traffic or give the stranger a hint that he had best go slowly. The milk and butchers’
carts go on with their deadly work, but the police in England are too busy worrying the
motorist to pay any attention. Some county boroughs have applied a ten-mile speed
limit, even though the great bulk of their area is open country; but twenty miles an hour
for an automobile is far safer for the public than is most other traffic, regardless of the
rate at which it moves.
Imagine a time when automobiles were held to ten miles per hour, and no one worried about
carbon footprints. This passage refers to the early days of the automobile, but it sounds
more suited to a fantasy piece about an alternate universe. However unrealistic it seems, this
argument passage gets its point across easily. Right from the start, you know the author’s
position (pro-car) because the passage begins with the “great point in favor of the automo-
bile,” which is that you travel with companions (two in the back, the driver and one other in
the front) and can talk without swiveling your head. Just in case anyone missed the point,
the author hammers it again at the end of paragraph one (“one may make the most ideal
trips imaginable”). The likely audience probably sees cars as newfangled inventions and
yearns for “the good old days,” when horses were enough.
The author’s case is bolstered by supporting arguments, principally the company and the
lack of head-swiveling, as I mention above, but also by the idea that there is “plenty to see,
exhilarating motion, jolly company, absolute independence, and a wide radius of action.” All
these advantages are summed up by the author’s rhetorical question (a question the author
will answer or a question that’s so obvious no answer is necessary). At the end of paragraph
two, the rhetorical question indicates that nothing matches the automobile, except perhaps
ballooning, which the author “knows nothing” about.
The next few arguments presented in the passage are designed to answer objections from the
reader. If the car breaks down, a handy horse cart will haul it away, or you “have a chance to
harden your muscles a bit pushing the machine to the next village.” The author’s so pro-car
that he makes a breakdown seem like a day at the gym! If the reader contends that boars
and trains are better, the author counters with the fact that “the times do move,” and the
automobile represents progress. The author admits that the car runs for shorter distances.
After this concession comes the reply: The other means of transportation undergo extensive
“overhauling” after each trip, but a car doesn’t.
113
Chapter 9: The Big Four: Modes of Discourse

My favorite paragraph is the last, in which the author takes on the police, who are so busy
worrying about speeding cars (at 10 or 20 miles per hour!) that they neglect “milk and butch-
ers’ carts” that presumably cause more fatal accidents, as they’re described as “go[ing] on
with their deadly work.”
When reading an argument passage, look for the author’s stance and analyze how the author
supports that position.
Information, Please: Expository Passages
When you open a textbook, refer to a user’s manual, or read a letter, chances are you’re read-
ing exposition, a mode of discourse that explains or informs. Expository passages show up all
over the AP English Language and Composition exam, and they’re also all over you, because
this book is exposition.
In fiction or drama, the term exposition refers to the part of the story in which background
information is delivered. In this section, I deal with nonfiction exposition, which conveys infor-
mation of any type.
Although exposition is probably the most common mode of discourse, it’s not easy to pull
off. (If you doubt me, cast your mind back to the last time you set up a new computer. How
clear was the manual?) When you’re reading exposition, watch out for these characteristics:
 The author generally defines new or unusual terms in an expository passage.
 If a process is involved, the steps proceed in order, each joined to the other by a transi-
tion. (For more on transitions, turn to Chapter 5.)
 Each paragraph of an expository passage has a topic sentence, conveying the main
idea of that paragraph. The topic sentence may appear at the beginning (most common
spot) or at the end (less common) or in the middle (very rare).
 Exposition sometimes requires digressions — side points that are necessary to under-
stand the main idea. The digression is usually linked to the main progression of ideas
by a transitional word or phrase.
 Although exposition deals with facts, authors often employ figures of speech (imagina-
tive language) or analogies to convey information.
 A thread of logic usually ties every aspect of an expository passage together, especially
in the exposition of a process. But many expository passages resemble mosaics, with a
bunch of well-explained ideas that are related to one main idea. In a “mosaic” passage,
order isn’t particularly important. Paragraphs may be moved around without muddy-
ing the message. 
 The author’s “voice” may be less important in an expository passage. In some works
(For Dummies books, for example), you “hear” the author speaking to you. In other
works, the author is an impersonal voice of authority.
Keep in mind, though, that while exposition may appear neutral, writing always has a
point of view, no matter how carefully the author tries to present the facts. The act of
choosing (or not choosing) information, the diction (word choice), and the emphasis
on one or another point all reflect the author’s bias.

When did “traditional” biotechnology begin? Perhaps ten thousand years ago, as farm-
ers raised animals and grew plants to produce food with desirable traits, higher yields,
new food varieties, better taste, faster ripening, and more resistance to drought. Five
thousand years ago in Peru, potatoes were grown selectively. In ancient Egypt — forty-
five hundred years ago — domesticated geese were fed to make them bigger and tastier.
About twenty-three hundred years ago, Greeks grafted trees, a technique that led to
orchards and a more abundant fruit supply. In fact, products as commonplace as grape-
fruit and wine came from traditional biotechnology.
Over the years, farmers have replanted seeds or cross-pollinated from their best crops.
And they’ve bred new livestock from their best animals. For example, within the past
few decades, hogs have been bred to be leaner, in turn producing lean cuts of pork for
today’s consumers.
With traditional breeding, farmers changed the genetic makeup of plants and animals by
selecting those with desirable traits. They then raised and selected again and again until
a new, more desirable breed or food variety was established. Even in the “old days,” all
of this breeding resulted in genetic change.
Traditional cross-breeding takes time. Often it’s unpredictable. Each time one plant polli-
nates another, or one animal inseminates another, thousands of genes cross together.
Along the way, less desirable traits — and the genes that cause them — may pass with
desirable ones. Several generations of breeding, perhaps ten to twelve years may go by
before desirable traits get established and less desirable qualities are bred away. 
The “new” biotechnology offers a faster and more precise way to establish new traits in
both plants and animals — and so provides improved foods that are safe, nutritious,
healthful, abundant, and tasty. In a nutshell, modern or “new” biotechnology refers to
using living organisms — plants, animals, and bacteria — to develop products not just
for food, but also for medical treatment, waste management, and alternative fuels,
among others.
Modern food biotechnology started about thirty years ago, as scientists learned more
about DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), genes, and the genetic code in living things, and
applied this knowledge to plant and animal breeding practices. In fact, the latest
advances in food biotechnology have spawned a new vocabulary. Popular media may
use “genetically modified foods” or “GM foods” to refer to these foods. Other terms,
such as “genetic engineering,” “gene splicing,” “cell culture,” and “recombinant DNA”
refer to some methods of biotechnology.
This selection from Duyff’s book explains biotechnology and its traditional roots. Although
it’s exposition and thus appears unbiased, Duyff has a point of view tucked just under the
surface. She doesn’t state outright that concern about genetically modified foods is unjusti-
fied, but by showing how the genes in our food supply have always been modified, she
undercuts the argument of opponents who fear “GM foods.” The organization of the passage
is chronological; it moves from “traditional biotechnology” to “modern food biotechnology.”
Along the way she takes time to define terms, briefly explain the process of selective breed-
ing, and refer to the media coverage of biotechnology. 
The passage begins with a rhetorical question, which Duyff answers immediately.
Biotechnology began 10,000 years ago. Then Duyff supplies several examples of ancient
biotech in chronological order, beginning with ancient Peru and then moving to Egypt and
Greece. She describes the process of selective breeding, starting with the selection of
“desirable traits” — including today’s leaner pork — and explains how this selection hap-
pens through several generations. 
Next, the author anticipates questions (and perhaps even objections) from her reader and
provides answers. “Why not stick to the natural way?” is countered by the statement that
selective breeding takes time and also passes along “less desirable traits.” The new biotech,
115
Chapter 9: The Big Four: Modes of Discourse

she states, is “faster and more precise.” The last paragraph gives an overview of modern
biotech, including a quick glossary of media terms for these processes.
Duyff’s language is precise and plain, and most sentences follow the most common patterns
(subject – verb – complement). The tone is calm and authoritative — just what you’d expect
from a passage intended to inform and to allay fears. 
In an exposition passage, keep track of details, but also be on the alert for the author’s point
of view.

In This Chapter
 Defining the essential characteristics of an essay
 Detecting the logical structure of an essay
 Analyzing sample essays
A
s if it weren’t bad enough to make you write three whole essays on the AP exam, the
exam creators make you read some too. Essays are often attached to the multiple-
choice portion of the test, and sometimes an essay is the basis for an analytical or synthesis
essay question. If you can overlook the soul-draining qualities of the exam setting, you may
actually enjoy reading the essays you encounter on AP English tests. They’re brain food for
the smart set, which you surely belong to, and a way to meet some very interesting writers.
In this chapter I explain what makes an essay an essay and show you how to unearth the
underlying structure of each piece you read. I give you a few examples of essays in action,
along with my own analysis of the way they’re written, so you can compare my comments on
the sample essays with your own. Along the way, you should pick up some tips that will help
you improve your own essay-writing skills.
Defining Essay Essentials
Writer Edward Hoagland called the definition of an essay a “greased pig” because both the
definition and the slippery porker are hard to catch and hold onto. Aldous Huxley said that
an essay was a “literary device for saying almost everything about almost anything.” Not
very specific definitions! Fortunately for you, coming up with a definition isn’t necessary.
Recognizing the basic characteristics of an essay, however, is important, because chances
are you have to do so on the AP exam. 
Before I tell you what’s essential to an essay, I must clear up some confusion that, I admit,
teachers have created. Some of us call any writing that isn’t poetry or fiction “an essay,” as
in “write a 500-word essay on the Yankees.” But this assignment calls for a report, a simple
survey of the magnificence of this baseball team. (Did I mention I’m a Yankee fan?) A report
conveys information, but it doesn’t consider the larger point — the significance of that infor-
mation. Nor does a report hit a higher level of thinking, where some of life’s most important
questions reside. A report is usually impersonal — a recital of facts, without much personal-
ity or a unique voice.
A real essay, on the other hand, is an exercise in thinking things through. An essay ponders,
considers, deliberates, interprets, evaluates, criticizes, or views the Big Picture. Traditionally,
essays were entitled “On _________.” The blank was filled with something important: “On
Love,” “On Freedom,” “On Patriotism,” and so forth. Classic essays, those following this
model, are favorite AP English exam choices because (a) they’re very well written so
(b) they’re easy to write questions about and (c) the topics are worthy of your time.

Essays in the modern age (and I’m counting the nineteenth century onward as “modern”)
have deviated from the pattern of their distinguished ancestors. They often resemble narra-
tives (stories), with interpretation tacked on. You often encounter this sort of essay on the
op-ed page of a newspaper. The essay begins with a news story or an account of a personal
experience and then evaluates its significance or places the event in a larger context.
When you’re reading an essay passage on the AP exam, keep these characteristics in mind.
Not every trait I mention here appears in any one essay, but chances are at least some do.
These characteristics may become part of your own analytical essay on a passage or may
help you answer multiple-choice questions on an essay:
 The word “essay” comes from the French word meaning “to try.” Essays often contain
an element of process, of “trying out” ideas and interpretations. When you’re reading
an essay, you may feel that you’ve entered into a conversation with the author. As he
or she recognizes a connection or comes to a conclusion, so do you.
Many essays are written after the author’s thought process has come to its natural con-
clusion. The passage may seem to present an idea that the author has always known
is true. But if you look closely, you can often uncover the path the author followed to
arrive at this idea. 
 Essays often resemble arguments (not a quarrel but a mode of discourse, as explained in
Chapter 9). An argument presents an idea that is supported by evidence. The author
may appeal to reason or emotion or may rely on a connection with the reader. 
 All essays are nonfiction, though the writer may insert hypothetical situations to make
a point. The line between reality and imagination should be clearly labeled.
 An essay presents a voice — the persona created by the author to represent him- or
herself. Virginia Woolf (one of my favorite novelists) called voice the “most proper but
most dangerous and delicate tool” of an essay writer. Listen to the author as you read.
Consider what sort of person wrote the essay and what assumptions the author made.
 Though the author’s voice is present, an essay isn’t a memoir or an autobiography,
even if the author relates events in his or her own life. An essay attempts to place life
experience or observation in a larger context, to answer the universal “What does it all
mean?” question.
 Essays vary greatly in structure, but they do have an underlying logic. A great essay by
Virginia Woolf describes a journey across London to buy a pencil. The point isn’t the
pencil (no pun intended). It’s what the writer thinks about as she walks and observes
her surroundings.
 An essay is an artistic creation. Without slighting the efforts of scientists, journalists,
bloggers, and anyone else who writes, their prose qualifies as an essay only if the writ-
ing is as much a priority as the information included.
 Essays range from a handful of paragraphs to book length. Naturally, you won’t see
book-length essays on the AP; short essays or excerpts are more practical.
Housing Thoughts: Essay Structure
Writers are builders, though many (including me) can’t hammer a nail into a wall without
breaking the wall, the nail, the hammer, or all three. (In my case, it’s always all three!) What
writers build is a “house” to hold their thoughts — in other words, a structure. I can’t
describe all the possible essay structures, simply because too many exist. Instead, in this
section I tell you the most common designs. Keep an eye out for them as you read, and con-
sider using them when you write your own essays.
118
Part III: Meeting the Major Players: Types of Writing Found on the Exam 

Anecdote and interpretation
In this configuration, the essay begins with an anecdote. Next, the writer considers the mean-
ing of the events related in the anecdote. Thomas L. Friedman’s essay “Eastern Middle
School” uses this structure. Written as an op-ed piece for The New York Times soon after the
September 11, 2001 attacks, Friedman begins by describing his daughter’s graduation from a
middle school in Washington, D.C. The principal notes that the children represent 40 different
countries. As these diverse graduates sing “God Bless America,” Friedman muses that the ter-
rorists see the United States as a nation without values. Friedman acknowledges America’s
shortcomings but says that the country’s real values — respect for individual freedom and
diversity — are on display at the middle-school graduation, “hiding in plain sight.”
Becoming an expert at “anecdote and interpretation” essays is the ultimate two-for-the-price-
of-one deal, because this type of essay is great for college applications. (If you’re panicking
about college essays, feel free to swell my head by consulting College Admission Essays For
Dummies, by yours truly, published by Wiley in 2003.)
Observation leading to conclusion
This structure is quite similar to the anecdote-and-interpretation structure I describe in the
preceding section. Instead of beginning with an anecdote, however, this sort of essay starts
with an observation of something the writer witnessed or heard or read about. The writer
then takes you through the logical ramifications, leading the reader to a concluding idea.
Because this type of essay moves the reader from a specific to a generalization, it’s some-
times called an inductive essay. (“To induce” is to lead or to move toward a desired end.)
One of my favorite essays falls into this category: “The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain”
by Langston Hughes. Writing in the 1920s, the author first quotes a poet who said, “I want to
be a poet, not a Negro poet.” Hughes moves from that comment to a consideration of the
stereotypes facing African-American writers and the artist’s obligation to his or her audience.
Hughes concludes that it’s more important to write without regard for one’s audience and for
African-American artists to be free “within ourselves.”
Compare and contrast
This sturdy old reliable, a staple of nearly every academic area, pops up in the world of essays
also. Two (or perhaps more) anecdotes or observations or descriptions form the bulk of the
essay. At the end, or sometimes woven throughout, are the author’s observations on the sig-
nificance of the similarities and differences. Amy Tan’s superb essay “Mother Tongue” com-
pares her mother’s broken English to Tan’s own educated speech. Her mother’s efforts are
dismissed by doctors and bankers, but when Tan asks for the same information, she is treated
courteously. Tan also recounts her own experience switching between her “mother tongue”
(the part Chinese, part English her mother speaks) and standard English, and Tan concludes
that her mother tongue helped her appreciate language and become a writer.
If a comparison-and-contrast essay makes an appearance on your AP exam, mentally list the
similarities and differences. Be sure to identify the author’s thoughts about both. Most of
the meaning lies in the interpretation, not in the description of the compared and contrasted
elements.
119
Chapter 10: Thinking Things Through: Essays

Big ideas
A Big Idea essay — the capital letters emphasize that you’re talking about something
important — is a collection of statements about love or jealousy or patriotism or something
else that’s important and philosophical. The interesting thing about this structure, most
often found in older works, is that just about every sentence in a Big Idea essay could be the
topic sentence of an entire paragraph, if not the thesis of a whole other essay. Reading a Big
Idea essay resembles (I imagine) getting hit by machine-gun fire. If you read a Big Idea essay
at your normal rate, you’ll be on the floor before you’re halfway to the end. This type of
essay assumes that you read one sentence, walk around the block for a while thinking about
the idea, and then read another. After another stroll, it’s time for sentence three, and so on.
Fortunately, Big Idea essays tend to be quite short.
Naturally, walks around the block are not on the AP-exam agenda. If they throw a Big Idea
essay at you (most likely in the multiple-choice section), slow down. Read one sentence,
pause, and restate it in your own words. Then move on to the next sentence. If you get stuck,
skip the sentence and try the next one. Chances are the skipped sentence isn’t crucial, and
you can still comprehend most of the essay.
For a good example of a Big Idea essay, check out anything by Francis Bacon, especially
“Of Studies,” which discusses why you’re in school (other than to be eligible for the baseball
team or the school play).
Thesis and proof 
A thesis-and-proof essay begins with a proposition, an idea you put in front of the reader.
Next come all the reasons why this idea is true. You’ve been writing thesis-and-proof essays
for years, on English and history tests. The essays you write in the free-response section of
the AP English Language and Composition exam may be in thesis-and-proof form. Plenty of
stellar writers have used this structure with great success. Take a look at “On Lying in Bed”
by British author G. K. Chesterton. This essay has one of the best first lines ever: “Lying in
bed would be an altogether perfect and supreme experience if only one had a coloured pencil
long enough to draw on the ceiling.” Chesterton makes the case that life’s small pleasures
(such as “lying in bed”) are superior to activities usually considered more important. You may
not agree with him, but you have to give him credit for good writing.
When you’re reading a thesis-and-proof essay, the most important task is to locate the thesis.
It’s usually in the first paragraph. Imagine that a defense attorney is attacking the thesis. How
does the prosecutor (the essayist) respond? The prosecutor’s case is the proof.
Mosaic
I call this structure “mosaic” because it resembles the art form in which little tiles are assem-
bled to form a coherent whole. You can’t grasp the overall effect of a mosaic essay until
you’ve reached the end, when the seemingly random ideas, anecdotes, and descriptions
come together and present a theme. “On Keeping a Notebook” by Joan Didion at first puzzles
the reader. Didion flips through her notebook, quoting what she’s written there and com-
menting on the circumstances that led to each jotting. Not until the end do you realize that
Didion is explaining the function of a writer’s notebook and revealing how such a notebook
fits into the writing process. 
120
Part III: Meeting the Major Players: Types of Writing Found on the Exam 

If you run across a mosaic essay on the AP exam, don’t panic. Stick with it until the end.
Mentally, step back and think: What’s this all about? If no answer occurs to you, move on to
another question or passage. Sometimes a little time and space are needed to make sense
of a mosaic essay.
Analyzing Sample Essays
No relaxation for you: This section presents two essay excerpts and one complete essay sim-
ilar to those you may encounter on the AP exam. The structure you see in the excerpted
essays may differ slightly from the ones I describe in the preceding section, “Housing
Thoughts: Essay Structure.” But even in the excerpts, you should have enough to get a good
idea of AP-style essay passages. After each essay, I list my thoughts on the rhetorical devices
each author uses to convey ideas, the organizational pattern of the work, and anything else I
can think of. Read with a pen in your hand, and before you read my comments, make some of
your own. Then compare your observations with mine.
Here’s a closely-guarded teacher secret: teachers learn from students. It’s entirely possible,
actually probable, that you’ll come up with something I missed. Good for you. So long as
your observation is grounded in the passage, pat yourself on the back. You beat me!
“Civil Disobedience”
Henry David Thoreau, a nineteenth-century American essayist, urges readers to resist injus-
tice in “Civil Disobedience,” excerpted here. In his essay, written in 1849, Thoreau refers to
slavery in the American South, the treatment of Native Americans by the United States gov-
ernment, and the war between the United States and Mexico. 
All men recognize the right of revolution; that is, the right to refuse allegiance to, and to
resist, the government, when its tyranny or its inefficiency are great and unendurable.
But almost all say that such is not the case now. But such was the case, they think, in
the Revolution of ’75. If one were to tell me that this was a bad government because it
taxed certain foreign commodities brought to its ports, it is most probable that I should
not make an ado about it, for I can do without them. All machines have their friction;
and possibly this does enough good to counter-balance the evil. At any rate, it is a great
evil to make a stir about it. But when the friction comes to have its machine, and oppres-
sion and robbery are organized, I say, let us not have such a machine any longer. In
other words, when a sixth of the population of a nation which has undertaken to be the
refuge of liberty are slaves, and a whole country is unjustly overrun and conquered by a
foreign army, and subjected to military law, I think that it is not too soon for honest men
to rebel and revolutionize. . . .
Under a government which imprisons unjustly, the true place for a just man is also a
prison. The proper place today, the only place which Massachusetts has provided for
her freer and less despondent spirits, is in her prisons, to be put out and locked out of
the State by her own act, as they have already put themselves out by their principles. It
is there that the fugitive slave, and the Mexican prisoner on parole, and the Indian come
to plead the wrongs of his race should find them; on that separate but more free and
honorable ground, where the State places those who are not with her, but against her —
the only house in a slave State in which a free man can abide with honor. If any think
that their influence would be lost there, and their voices no longer afflict the ear of the
State, that they would not be as an enemy within its walls, they do not know by how
much truth is stronger than error, nor how much more eloquently and effectively he can
121
Chapter 10: Thinking Things Through: Essays

combat injustice who has experienced a little in his own person. Cast your whole vote,
not a strip of paper merely, but your whole influence. A minority is powerless while it
conforms to the majority; it is not even a minority then; but it is irresistible when it
clogs by its whole weight. If the alternative is to keep all just men in prison, or give up
war and slavery, the State will not hesitate which to choose. If a thousand men were not
to pay their tax bills this year, that would not be a violent and bloody measure, as it
would be to pay them and enable the State to commit violence and shed innocent blood.
This is, in fact, the definition of a peaceable revolution, if any such is possible. If the tax-
gatherer, or any other public officer, asks me, as one has done, “But what shall I do?” my
answer is, “If you really wish to do anything, resign your office.” When the subject has
refused allegiance, and the officer has resigned from office, then the revolution is accom-
plished. But even suppose blood should flow. Is there not a sort of blood shed when the
conscience is wounded? Through this wound a man’s real manhood and immortality
flow out, and he bleeds to an everlasting death. I see this blood flowing now.
This is just a thin slice of Thoreau’s masterpiece, which he wrote after spending the night in
jail for refusing to pay taxes that he believed would finance unjust governmental actions. (His
friends bailed him out without his knowledge.) Thoreau took advantage of his time in jail to
consider the nature of government and the proper relationship of citizens to the power
wielded in their name. Here’s my analysis of this essay excerpt:
 The last sentence of the first paragraph is its topic sentence: “I think that it is not too
soon for honest men to rebel and revolutionize.” This topic sentence also sets up
Thoreau’s main argument: One must resist an unjust government. 
 The first paragraph compares the situation preceding “the Revolution of ’75” (the
Revolutionary War) with the current situation (“a sixth of the population . . . are slaves,
and a whole country [Mexico] is unjustly overrun”). The comparison reinforces the
idea of resistance to tyranny.
 The second paragraph begins with a strong topic sentence: “Under a government
which imprisons unjustly, the true place for a just man is also a prison.” Next Thoreau
presents his proof for this statement: Prison is where fugitive slaves and Mexican pris-
oners are sent, and jail is “the only house in a slave State in which a free man can abide
with honor.” He urges readers to vote not just with paper but with their lives — their
“whole influence.” If everyone protests injustice, the State will yield because it cannot
imprison “all just citizens.” He recounts his conversation with the tax collector, whom
Thoreau urges to resign.
 Thoreau’s reasoning — whether you agree with him or not — is very clear. It’s based
on a series of assumptions: that slavery and the invasion of Mexico are great wrongs,
that taxes support those actions, and that a just man must go to jail rather than give in
to injustice. This is a “thesis-and-proof” essay. (See the preceding section, “Housing
Thoughts: Essay Structure,” for more information.)
 In both paragraphs of the excerpt, Thoreau employs repetitive (but slightly differing)
statements. Similar syntax and diction link the statements, but in every case the varia-
tions make Thoreau’s point. The first example of repetition is “such is not the case
now” and “such was the case, they think, in the Revolution of ’75.” Thoreau contrasts
the way people viewed the government in the Revolutionary period with the way they
evaluate their own time period. Another example of repetition is the word “place”
(“proper place today, the only place”). Repeating “place” emphasizes that jail, in
Thoreau’s opinion, is the “only place” for those who believe in justice. Also in para-
graph two are two sentences with “put” and “out” (“to be put out and locked out of the
State by her own act” and “they have already put themselves out by their principles”).
The State of Massachusetts puts people “out” of society and into jail, but the prisoners
have already left the unjust society by means of their just principles. Finally, Thoreau
contrasts the nonviolent act of refusing to pay taxes (“not to pay their tax bills this
year, that would not be a violent and bloody measure”) with tax payment, which would
“enable the State to commit violence.”
122
Part III: Meeting the Major Players: Types of Writing Found on the Exam 

 Thoreau’s figurative language includes the metaphor of a machine and friction in
paragraph one and the metaphor of blood in paragraph two. The machine represents
government, and friction symbolizes the inevitable mistakes government makes.
When those mistakes rise to the level of evil, Thoreau says, government becomes
the friction — the evil — and must be resisted. Thoreau continues, “I say, let us not
have such a machine any longer.” The blood comes from a wounded conscience, but
Thoreau equates it with “a man’s real manhood and immortality.”
 Paragraph one contains an allusion to the Boston Tea Party, which occurred because
“a bad government . . . taxed certain foreign commodities.” Thoreau, had he lived in
that era, would simply have avoided those commodities. In comparison to slavery
and the invasion of Mexico, a tax on tea wasn’t worth his time.
 Thoreau’s diction is formal, and the tone is passionate. Statements such as “Cast your
whole vote, not a strip of paper merely, but your whole influence” are extreme, but he’s
backed them with careful reasoning.
Has Thoreau inspired you? If so, read the whole essay. It’s available in books of classic essays
and on line in several spots, including www.gutenberg.org.
“On Envy”
Samuel Johnson, an eighteenth-century essayist, is famous for his quotable pronouncements
on many topics, among them envy. This short essay is reprinted in its entirety. Don’t be
thrown off balance by some irregular spelling (which was proper in Johnson’s day) or by
Johnson’s dense style. Read slowly, and the meaning will come through.
Envy is almost the only vice which is practicable at all times, and in every place; the
only passion which can never lie quiet for want of irritation: its effects therefore are
everywhere discoverable, and its attempts always to be dreaded.
It is impossible to mention a name which any advantageous distinction has made eminent,
but some latent animosity will burst out. The wealthy trader, however he may abstract
himself from publick affairs, will never want those who hint, with Shylock, that ships are
but boards. The beauty, adorned only with the unambitious graces of innocence and mod-
esty, provokes, whenever she appears, a thousand murmurs of detraction. The genius,
even when he endeavours only to entertain or instruct, yet suffers persecution from innu-
merable criticks, whose acrimony is excited merely by the pain of seeing others pleased,
and of hearing applauses which another enjoys.
The frequency of envy makes it so familiar, that it escapes our notice; nor do we often
reflect upon its turpitude or malignity, till we happen to feel its influence. When he that
has given no provocation to malice, but by attempting to excel, finds himself pursued by
multitudes whom he never saw, with all the implacability of personal resentment; when
he perceives clamour and malice let loose upon him as a publick enemy, and incited by
every stratagem of defamation; when he hears the misfortunes of his family, or the fol-
lies of his youth, exposed to the world; and every failure of conduct, or defect of nature,
aggravated and ridiculed; he then learns to abhor those artifices at which he only
laughed before, and discovers how much the happiness of life would be advanced by
the eradication of envy from the human heart.
Envy is, indeed, a stubborn weed of the mind, and seldom yields to the culture of philos-
ophy. There are, however, considerations, which, if carefully implanted and diligently
propagated, might in time overpower and repress it, since no one can nurse it for the
sake of pleasure, as its effects are only shame, anguish, and perturbation.
It is above all other vices inconsistent with the character of a social being, because it
sacrifices truth and kindness to very weak temptations. He that plunders a wealthy
123
Chapter 10: Thinking Things Through: Essays

neighbour gains as much as he takes away, and may improve his own condition in the
same proportion as he impairs another’s; but he that blasts a flourishing reputation,
must be content with a small dividend of additional fame, so small as can afford very
little consolation to balance the guilt by which it is obtained.
I have hitherto avoided that dangerous and empirical morality, which cures one vice
by means of another. But envy is so base and detestable, so vile in its original, and so
pernicious in its effects, that the predominance of almost any other quality is to be pre-
ferred. It is one of those lawless enemies of society, against which poisoned arrows may
honestly be used. Let it therefore be constantly remembered, that whoever envies
another, confesses his superiority, and let those be reformed by their pride who have
lost their virtue.
It is no slight aggravation of the injuries which envy incites, that they are committed
against those who have given no intentional provocation; and that the sufferer is often
marked out for ruin, not because he has failed in any duty, but because he has dared to
do more than was required.
Almost every other crime is practised by the help of some quality which might have pro-
duced esteem or love, if it had been well employed; but envy is mere unmixed and gen-
uine evil; it pursues a hateful end by despicable means, and desires not so much its own
happiness as another’s misery. To avoid depravity like this, it is not necessary that any
one should aspire to heroism or sanctity, but only that he should resolve not to quit the
rank which nature assigns him, and wish to maintain the dignity of a human being.
Not an easy essay to read, but Johnson has made some good points about envy. Check out
my observations:
 This classic essay follows a Big Idea pattern (see the preceding section, “Housing
Thoughts: Essay Structure,” for more information). Nearly every sentence makes an
important point, and Johnson includes no unnecessary elaboration. The reader’s job
is to flesh out every idea.
 The first paragraph lays out Johnson’s thesis: envy is everywhere. Paragraph two cites
categories of people who provoke envy because of their accomplishments — the
“wealthy trader,” “the beauty,” and “the genius.” The next paragraph continues the logi-
cal thread. Because envy is everywhere, you don’t notice it — unless you become a
target of envy. Then you find out “how much the happiness of life would be advanced
by the eradication of envy from the human heart.” Paragraph four marks a shift from
problem to solution. If you try hard, you can “overpower and repress” envy. Paragraph
five explains that those who envy make themselves unhappy. Paragraph six goes to
extremes; because envy is so bad, it’s okay to use “poisoned arrows” against it. In case
the reader objects to that last point, the next paragraph explains again that the object
of envy has earned hatred not because “he has failed in any duty, but because he has
dared to do more than was required.” The conclusion slams envy out of the park:
Johnson calls it a “crime,” “genuine evil,” and “depravity” — extreme words.
 As you see, nearly any paragraph of Johnson’s essay could be expanded into an entirely
separate essay about a particular aspect of envy — how it harms the envious person,
how to fight envy, and so forth.
 Johnson’s figurative language contributes to his message. Envy is “a stubborn weed of
the mind” (a metaphor), and those who harm another’s reputation because of envy
gain “a small dividend of additional fame” (another metaphor). 
 Paragraph two also alludes to a Shakespearean character, Shylock, of The Merchant of
Venice. Shylock is a complicated character; the reference here is to Shylock’s envy and
his desire to see others fail.

 The syntax places ideas in parallel structure and balances them in importance. Here’s
just one of many possible examples, drawn from paragraph three: “When he that has
given no provocation to malice . . . finds himself pursued . . . when he perceives clam-
our and malice . . . when he hears . . .” All those “when he” statements build to a strong
conclusion: “he then learns” how bad envy is.
“Chimney Pot Papers” 
Who loves rainstorms? Read this excerpt from “Chimney Pot Papers” to find out. This essay
was written by Charles S. Brooks, a twentieth-century American humorist.
At this moment beneath my window there is a dear little girl who brings home a package
from the grocer’s. She is tugged and blown by her umbrella, and at every puff of wind
she goes up on tiptoe. If I were writing a fairy tale I would make her the Princess of my
plot, and I would transport her underneath her umbrella in this whisking wind to her
far adventures, just as Davy sailed off to the land of Goblins inside his grandfather’s
clock. . . . How she labors at the turn, hugging her paper bag and holding her flying
skirts against her knees! An umbrella, however, usually turns inside out before it gets
you off the pavement, and then it looks like a wrecked Zeppelin. You put it in the first
ash-can, and walk off in an attempt not to be conspicuous.
Although the man who pursues his hat is, in some sort, conscious that he plays a comic
part, and although there is a pleasing relish on the curb at his discomfort, yet it must
not be assumed that all the humor on the street rises from misadventure. Rather, it
arises from a general acceptance of the day and a feeling of common partnership in the
storm. The policeman in his rubber coat exchanges banter with a cab-driver. If there is
a tangle in the traffic, it comes nearer to a jest than on a fairer day. A teamster sitting
dry inside his hood, whistles so cheerily that he can be heard at the farther sidewalk.
Good-naturedly he sets his tune as a rival to the wind.
It must be that only good-tempered persons are abroad — those whose humor endures
and likes the storm — and that when the swift dark clouds drove across the world, all
sullen folk scurried for a roof. . . . There are many persons, of course, who like summer
rains and boast of their liking. This is nothing. One might as well boast of his appetite
for toasted cheese. Does one pin himself with badges if he plies an enthusiastic spoon in
an ice-cream dish? . . . Of course they like it. Who could help it? This is no proof of merit.
Such folk, at best, are but sisters in the brotherhood.
And yet a November rain is but an August rain that has grown a beard and taken on the
stalwart manners of the world. And the November wind, which piped madrigals in June
and lazy melodies all the summer, has done no more than learn brisker braver tunes to
befit the coming winter. If the wind tugs at your coat-tails, it only seeks a companion for
its games. It goes forth whistling for honest celebration, and who shall begrudge it here
and there a chimney if it topple it in sport?
Despite this, rainy weather has a bad name. So general is its evil reputation, that from of
old, one of the lowest circles of Hell has been plagued with raw winds and covered thick
with ooze — a testament to our northern March — and in this villains were set shivering
to their chins. But the beginning of the distaste for rainy weather may be traced to Noah.
Certain it is that toward the end of his cruise, when the passengers were already chafing
with the animals — the kangaroos, in particular, it is said, played leap-frog in the hold and
disturbed the skipper’s sleep — certain it is while the heavens were still overcast that
Noah each morning put his head anxiously up through the forward hatch for a change of
sky. There was rejoicing from stem to stern — so runs the legend — when at last his old
white beard, shifting from west to east, gave promise of a clearing wind. But from that day
to this, as is natural, there has persisted a stout prejudice against wind and rain.
125
Chapter 10: Thinking Things Through: Essays

But this is not just. If a rainy day lacks sunshine, it has vigor for a substitute. The wind
whistles briskly among the chimney tops. There is so much life on wet and windy days.
Yesterday Nature yawned, but today she is wide awake. 
Doesn’t Brooks make you long for a storm? (Actually, I have to admit that I’m one of the
wimps that likes gentle rain.) Here’s what I came up with after reading Brooks’ essay, other
than a resolution to buy a new umbrella:
 The structure of this essay most closely conforms to “observation leading to conclu-
sion.” (See the preceding section for a description of this structure.) The excerpt
begins with a description of a little girl. She’s nearly blown away as she struggles down
the street holding a paper bag. Next you see a man who’s lost his hat to the wind. The
cop and cabbie are next, and finally a teamster (who’s managed to stay dry — must be
in the union contract). These specific observations are followed by a generalization:
Good-tempered persons go out in a storm, so the baddies must be inside. Now comes
the response to an anticipated reader comment: Yes, lots of people like summer rains,
but that’s the Weather Channel equivalent of liking toasted cheese or ice cream. As the
author says, “Who could help it?” To like November rain, on the other hand, takes char-
acter. The next paragraph muses about the reasons why stormy weather “has a bad
name.” Perhaps this reputation stems from Noah (an allusion to the Bible story of
Noah’s ark), when even the animals longed for sunlight after the Flood. The excerpt
(Brooks goes on for a few more pages about the wonderfulness of storms) ends with an
affirmation of rainy weather: “Yesterday Nature yawned, but today she is wide awake.”
Storms represent nature at her liveliest.
 Brooks’ tone is fanciful. He imagines Noah’s mood and alludes to Dante. (In paragraph
six, “the lowest circles of Hell” is a reference to The Divine Comedy.) He contemplates
toasted cheese and ice cream, comparing them to summer rains. He sees November’s
rain as “an August rain that has grown a beard.” 
 Rain is only one of the personifications in this essay. The wind is personified too,
because it’s described as a force that “piped madrigals in June and lazy melodies all
the summer.” Nature is also personified; she “yawned” yesterday and during the storm
was “wide awake.”
 By describing only cheerful people — the little girl, the man who’s lost his hat, the cop,
and so forth — Brooks has stacked the evidence deck in favor of his conclusion about
the superiority of bad weather.

E
xcept for the extremely self-centered, just about everyone is interested in other
people and their life stories. A trip to the newsstand, where gossip magazines abound,
proves my point. Who doesn’t want to know what it’s like to be a movie star, a mountain
climber, or an Olympic swimmer? Plus, even the lives of “ordinary” people can be intriguing.
(I put “ordinary” in quotation marks because I think all lives are extraordinary — and
interesting — if told in the right way.)
You’ll probably face a biographical or an autobiographical passage on the AP English Language
and Composition test. Just remember that biography and autobiography are essentially gossip.
Old gossip, maybe, well-written gossip, certainly, but gossip all the same. And because every-
one loves gossip, you’re probably already an expert at decoding this genre. Expert or not, this
chapter helps you fine-tune your gossip . . . sorry, biography and autobiography interpretive
skills.
Relating a Life with Rhetorical Devices 
The AP exam is short, and life — at least a life that makes it into a book — is long. So instead
of a birth-to-death span, expect to see a slice of life in a biographical or an autobiographical
selection. The AP makers pick their literature carefully, but they’re mostly concerned with
testing your ability to understand rhetorical devices, the techniques that writers use to
convey information. (Part II explains everything you ever wanted to know about rhetorical
devices and perhaps even a few things you didn’t want to know.)
Writers’ approaches to biography or autobiography (also known as memoir, from the French
for “remember”) vary almost as much as their subjects do. The passage may be told solely
from the writer’s point of view, for example, or it may include quotations from letters, diaries,
or friends. The tone may be critical, enthusiastic, analytical, or any of about a thousand
other things. Therefore, I can’t tell you what you’ll see on the exam. I can, however, explain
what to look for:
 Check point of view. Is the subject talking? Then the piece is written in first person,
the usual point of view for autobiography, though some writers have been known to
talk about themselves in the third person. (Weird, don’t you think?) 

In a first-person piece, it’s natural to equate the narrator with the author. However, no
matter how objective they try to be, all authors shape the reader’s perception through
writing style and content choice. The term persona refers to the character the writer
creates to represent him- or herself. 
In third-person point of view (the choice for biographies), does the author attempt to
interpret the subject’s personality, motivations, and emotions? Or does the author take
a more objective stance, relying solely on verifiable material such as quotations,
actions, historical records, and the like?
 Look for descriptions, because they illuminate character. Setting says a lot about
what the subject values or about how the subject lives. A tour of my office, for exam-
ple, would feature the thirty minor-league baseball pennants on the wall, all souvenirs
of games I’ve attended. If that fact were included in my biography (which, by the way,
you’re welcome to write), the reader would know how important baseball is to me. A
physical description of the subject or of people close to the subject may also reveal
important information. I’ve never met Yao Ming, the extremely tall basketball player,
but I imagine that his height has affected more than his choice of career. (For one thing,
he’s probably an expert on top-of-the-head hair patterns.)
 Examine relationships, if any are presented. You may find a paragraph about the sub-
ject’s parents or best friend. What does that relationship tell you about the subject?
The writer may do the work for you, analyzing the relationship, or may expect you to
figure it out yourself.
 Pay extra attention to quotations. Technically, everything in first-person point of view
is a quotation from the author. But even in first-person, quotations from others may
appear. In third-person biographical passages, the subject’s own words may be quoted,
or you may see quotations from others. If the author included the exact words, those
words are significant.
 Consider any anecdotes that are present. Although AP passages are relatively short
(500–800 words), one or two anecdotes may be tucked into the main narrative. What
do those anecdotes add to your understanding of the subject? Often anecdotes provide
contrast, showing a softer side of a hard-edged character, perhaps.
Anecdotes may also reveal themes. Look for common threads tying anecdotes together
and to the main narrative. If the common thread is loyalty, for instance, then that qual-
ity is an important aspect of the subject.
 Check tone — a reflection of the writer’s attitude. Tone comes across partly through
the author’s diction, or word choice, but also through what the author chooses to tell
you. Especially in autobiography, tone is a character clue. A passage reporting that
“the police officer arrested me” is very different from one that says, “The cop hauled
me down to the station.” The first has a detached tone; the second has a touch of
resentment. In biography, tone helps you evaluate the accuracy of the author’s inter-
pretation. If the tone is consistently critical, for example, you may want to give the sub-
ject a little more credit than the author does, to correct for any possible bias.
 Notice what’s not in the passage. Granted, space limitation is an important factor.
However, within the passage, the author may leave out something you’d expect to find.
What does that omission tell you? For example, if a passage about a subject’s family
mentions everyone but the mother, that fact is significant, either because the mother
died young or because the autobiographer has issues (as therapists and talk-show
hosts like to say). However, what a biographer omits may merely reflect who was will-
ing to talk to the writer and who wasn’t.
As annoying as they can be, AP test-makers do play fair. Anything they ask you about a pas-
sage can be answered based on what’s printed on the page. The significance of missing items
is usually explained or implied by other material in the passage.

I Did It My Way: Autobiography
The Story of My Life, By Me. That’s autobiography in a nutshell. Once you break the shell
open, of course, autobiography becomes more complicated. The autobiographer may be
writing to bear witness to an important historical event he or she witnessed. At times, auto-
biographies arise from attempts to understand the self, to make peace with people or events
in the past, or to justify one’s actions. 
Whatever the purpose, writing style and content should complement each other, as in all
good literature. As you read these autobiographical passages, keep your eyes open and your
pen handy. Refer to the rhetorical devices I mention in “Relating a Life” earlier in this chapter.
Jot down everything you notice, as if you were preparing to write an essay. Then if you actu-
ally have to write an analytical essay about an autobiographical selection, you’ll be in top
shape. As a bonus, the points you note may possibly be the basis for multiple-choice ques-
tions, so you’ll be prepared for those as well.
A New Yorker
This passage, an excerpt from an article entitled “The Visit,” describes a Manhattan resi-
dent’s visit to a counselor near the site of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World
Trade Center. 
No. Jack, our counselor, doesn’t wear a white robe and sit on a rusted barrel pushed
deeply into the sand for balance at the Site. Actually, he has a townhouse with a door-
bell. There is nothing to distinguish his building from the others on the block. They all
look new and possibly uninhabited. All are beige. All the doorbells are black. Each house
has a stoop on which no one sits. There are no cars parked at the curb. I have to remind
myself that I am in Manhattan.
Jack’s is the first house in a row of ten. After the tenth, there is the Hudson River. The blue
water is moving swiftly. He doesn’t have a sign on the door. The first time we came, we
skeptically compared the address in the article about the Counseling Center with the one
on the townhouse. The numbers matched. It didn’t look special. After all these times, it still
takes faith to believe that there is someone inside who will answer the door.
I press the button and we hear nothing.
I don’t doubt that someone will answer and lead us up the stairs to where Jack sits, for I
realize I have made a deal. My end of the deal is that I remain defiant. I need to be defi-
ant if I am going to survive. Jack has made that clear.
“It could be dangerous not to be defiant.”
With Jack’s help I have begun the process of healing, despite living in an environment of
promised attacks in the future, the incompetence of the FBI and the CIA, airplanes again
flying over Manhattan, waiting for the first suicide bombers, politically correct random
car checks, dirty bombs, being sniffed at by mean dogs that are held in check by young
men in camouflage, having my bag probed by flashlights numerous times and never
having my knife found, speculation about Bin Laden’s kidneys, anthrax scares that
become real, panic attacks, crying binges, and more.
I am learning to replace faith with defiance. Faith would be Pollyanna-ish. Things will
become worse, probably.
As we wait for someone to answer the bell, I relax because there is a second part to the
deal I have cut with Jack. I am allowed to have faith on this stoop and in this house. He
has helped me, and he will help me more. I know that to be true. I believe that to be true.
I don’t have to be defiant here. I can have faith here.
129
Chapter 11: Life Flashing before Your Eyes: Memoirs and Biographies

To the east, across the street, there is a sign for a dentist’s office, followed by two or three
other buildings. Those buildings are also replicas of Jack’s. Past the dentist and those
other buildings is the void without shadows. I don’t look at it, but that empty space is the
reason we are in the neighborhood. We don’t ignore it. We just don’t look at it.
Last Saturday we weren’t here; we were in Pennsylvania Station on our way to visit my
sister for the first time since my mother’s death. Since the attack, I have become a man
of reasons. I no longer just visit relatives. I no longer just do anything. The terrorists
have made me anti-Nike, anti-“just do it.” I have been humbled. Talk of climbing moun-
tains just because they are there confuses me. I don’t climb mountains. I take steps, very
small steps. And each step is an end to itself. Each step must have a reason. I want each
step to be up, but this is not necessarily true. There will be times when I wander in the
wrong direction. I am just learning how to walk again. I am a human who is living in a
very abnormal time.
This excerpt from “The Visit” captures the anguish so many felt after the attacks of
September 11, 2001. The first-person narrative clearly conveys the fact that you’re reading
one person’s story, but its themes are universal. Here’s what I noted about the style and con-
tent of the passage:
 The heart of the passage is in the last paragraph, in which the writer states, “I take
steps, very small steps.” The dominant characteristic of this passage is the series of
short, simple sentences. In paragraph two, for example, you see: “Jack’s is the first
house in a row of ten. After the tenth, there is the Hudson River. The blue water is
moving swiftly.” More short sentences follow, but I think you get the point. The sen-
tences are themselves a series of “very small steps.” 
 Many of the sentences follow an “I – verb” pattern. One theme of this piece is that the
writer can’t control events, only himself. He’s “made a deal,” which the series of “I”
statements explains. 
 Most of the paragraphs are also short; in fact, two paragraphs (the third and the fifth)
contain just one short sentence each. Again, the “very small steps” are mirrored by the
paragraphing.
 The short-sentence pattern is broken here and there, notably in paragraph six. The con-
tent of paragraph six is a description of the writer’s fears – “promised attacks,” “anthrax
scares,” and so on. The paragraph is just one sentence long, but it’s a very long sentence.
The list creates a tone of anxiety and echoes the way frightened people explain what
they’re worried about. Furthermore, the sentence is complex because terrorism is com-
plex; the author (and probably the reader as well) can’t wrap his mind around it easily.
 Diction also connects to meaning. Most of the words are quite simple. In the last para-
graph, the author says, “I have been humbled.” Life has been reduced to its essentials —
simplified, like the words in this passage.
 In paragraph one, the “uninhabited” houses have “stoop[s] on which no one sits.” This
image of emptiness is repeated in paragraph nine, where the author refers to “the void
without shadows” and “that empty space” — the site of the attacks. Though the World
Trade Center site is never described directly, the setting of this piece is crucial to its
meaning.
 The last paragraph appears to begin a digression — a reference to a family visit.
However, the visit is linked to the rest of the passage by its style (“I – verb” sentences)
and content (“I take steps”). In a way, this paragraph brings the piece full circle,
because visiting the counselor is a “small step.”
 The author is the only “character” in the story, though he refers to “Jack,” the counselor,
and uses the pronoun “we” at times. The plural implies that the author is not alone in vis-
iting the counselor. Although the “we” isn’t explained here, its appearance brings in an
element of universality; many New Yorkers are experiencing the same emotions.

Part III: Meeting the Major Players: Types of Writing Found on the Exam 

An emigrant
This passage from The Iron Puddler was written by James J. Davis, a Welshman who emi-
grated to the United States because of “the problem of bread” — earning enough to feed
the family. Davis writes about his childhood in this excerpt, focusing on his father and grand-
father and an incident at school:
From my father I learned many things. He taught me to be skillful and proud of it. He taught
me to expect no gift from life, but that what I got, I must win with my hands. He taught me
that good men would bring forth good fruits. This was all the education he could give me,
and it was enough.
My father was an iron worker, and his father before him. My people had been workers in
metal from the time when the age of farming in Wales gave way to the birth of modern
industries. They were proud of their skill, and the secrets of the trade were passed from
father to son as a legacy of great value, and were never told to persons outside the
family. Such skill meant good wages when there was work. But there was not work all
the time. Had there been jobs enough for all we would have taught our trade to all. But
in self-protection we thought of our own mouths first. All down the generations my
family has been face to face with the problem of bread.
My Grandfather Davies held a skilled job at the blast furnace where iron was made for
the rolling mill in which my father was a puddler. Grandfather Davies had been to Russia
and had helped the Russians build blast furnaces, in the days when they believed that
work would make them wealthy. Had they stuck to that truth they would not be a ruined
people to-day. Grandfather also went to America, where his skill helped build the first
blast furnace in Maryland. The furnace fires have not ceased burning here, and Russia is
crying for our steel to patch her broken railways. Her own hills are full of iron and her
hands are as strong as ours. Let them expect no gift from life.
Grandfather told my father that America offered a rich future for him and his boys. “The
metal is there,” he said, “as it is in Russia. Russia may never develop, but America will.
A nation’s future lies not in its resources. The American mind is right. Go to America.”
And because my father believed that a good people will bring forth good fruit, he left his
ancient home in Wales and crossed the sea to cast his lot among strangers.
I started to school in Wales when I was four years old. By the time I was six I thought I
knew more than my teachers. This shows about how bright I was. The teachers had for-
bidden me to throw paper wads, or spitballs. I thought I could go through the motion of
throwing a spitball without letting it go. But it slipped and I threw the wad right in the
teacher’s eye. I told him it was an accident, that I had merely tried to play smart and had
overreached myself.
“Being smart is a worse fault,” he said, “than throwing spitballs. I forgive you for throw-
ing the spitball, but I shall whip the smart Aleckness [disrespect] out of you.”
He gave me a good strapping, and I went home in rebellion. I told my father. I wanted
him to whip the teacher. Father said: “I know the teacher is a good man. I have known
him for years, and he is honest, he is just, he is kind. If he whipped you, you deserved it.
You cannot see it that way, so I am going to whip you myself.”
He gave me a good licking, and, strange to say, it convinced me that he and the teacher
were right. They say that the “hand educates the mind,” and I can here testify that
father’s hand set my mental processes straight. From that day I never have been lawless
in school or out. The shame of my father’s disapproval jolted me so that I decided ever
after to try to merit his approval.
131
Chapter 11: Life Flashing before Your Eyes: Memoirs and Biographies

Though the author is the subject of this autobiographical piece, quite a lot of space is
devoted to other people. Yet everything in the passage is linked by common themes. Now for
some details:
 By telling you what he learned — “to be skillful and proud of it,” “to expect no gift from
life,” and to “win with my hands” — the author describes himself, despite the fact that
he begins by speaking of his father. These three statements recur in the passage. The
second paragraph talks about the author’s ancestors, who “were proud of their skill”
and whose “secrets of the trade” were “a legacy of great value.” The anecdote about
Russia echoes “expect no gift” with the statement “Let them expect no gift from life.”
Finally, the whipping the father gives the author “set [the author’s] mental processes
straight.” Repetition emphasizes these ideas and establishes the author’s (and his
family’s) values.
 The passage contains only a few quotations, but each has a strong impact. First comes
the implied quotation (“Let them expect no gift from life”) and then “The American
mind is right. Go to America.” The teacher’s comment (“Being smart is a worse fault”)
is strong, as is the father’s “If he whipped you, you deserved it.” These are people of
action, not words, but the words they do use are memorable.
 The father’s and the grandfather’s words are quoted, but the narrator never quotes his
own words. The narrator speaks as an older person, looking back at his childhood.
This style of quotation is appropriate because the piece has a double subject — the
boy who went through these events and the man who remembers them. Mostly you
hear the adult’s “voice” in the piece. However, in the schoolteacher/spitball incident,
the narrator slips back into childhood: “I told my father. I wanted him to whip the
teacher.”
 The syntax is simple, and many of the sentences are short and emphatic: For example:
“I started to school in Wales when I was four years old. By the time I was six I thought I
knew more than my teachers. This shows about how bright I was.” Life in Wales — and
life for a small child — is straightforward. You work, you eat. If you can’t find work,
you’re “face to face with the problem of bread.” 
 A few long sentences break the pattern. In paragraph two, for instance, “They were
proud . . . outside the family” is relatively long. This content of this sentence is the con-
tinuity of generations — how fitting that it be long!
 This excerpt covers a lot of ground, several generations, in fact. What’s missing is more
about the boy’s life, his activities, and friends. The second paragraph concerns life-or-
death issues and states that “in self-protection we thought of our own mouths first.” In
that context, it’s not surprising to omit childish games.
 The anecdote about the spitball brings all the themes together: the importance and
authority of elders, the hand educating the mind, and the need to face life without
excuses. It also brings the piece full circle, because it epitomizes what the father has
taught the boy — the subject of paragraph one.
Turning Other Lives into Literature: Biography
The task facing biographers is both easier and harder than an autobiographer’s. Biographers
don’t have to dig inside themselves and confront their own personality. However, biogra-
phers have to research, interview, and research some more and then make sense of someone
else’s character.

choice questions on your AP exam.
A Puritan father
The following passage is excerpted from Daughters of the Puritans by Seth Curtis Beech. The
book contains short biographical sketches of Puritan women. (The Puritans, who colonized
much of New England, followed a strict religious code.) This excerpt is from the chapter on
Catharine Maria Sedgwick. (Though it’s short, this excerpt presents nearly everything from
that chapter.)
She could have learned some condescension and humanity from her mother who, in spite
of her fine birth, seems to have been modest and retiring to a degree. She was very reluc-
tant to have her husband embark upon a public career; had, her daughter says, “No sympa-
thy with what is called honor and distinction”; and wrote her husband a letter of protest
which is worth quoting if only to show how a well-trained wife would write her doting hus-
band something more than a century ago: “Pardon me, my dearest Mr. Sedgwick, if I beg
you once more to think over the matter before you embark in public business. I grant that
the ‘call of our country,’ the ‘voice of fame,’ and the ‘Honorable’ and ‘Right-Honorable,’ are
high sounding words. ‘They play around the head, but they come not near the heart.’”
However, if he decides for a public career, she will submit: “Submission is my duty, and
however hard, I will try to practice what reason teaches me I am under obligation to do.”
That address, “my dearest Mr. Sedgwick,” from a wife a dozen years after marriage, shows
a becoming degree of respect.
We may be sure that this gentle mother would have encouraged no silly notions of social
distinctions in the minds of her children. Even Mr. Sedgwick seems to have had a softer
and more human side to his nature than we have yet seen. Miss Sedgwick enjoys repeat-
ing a story which she heard from a then “venerable missionary.” The son of the village
shoemaker, his first upward step was as boy-of-all-work of the clerk of courts. He had
driven his master to the court session in dignified silence, broken on arrival by a curt
order to take in the trunk. “As he set it down in the entry,” says Miss Sedgwick, “my
father, then judge of the Supreme Judicial Court, was coming down stairs, bringing his
trunk himself. He set it down, accosted the boy most kindly, and gave him his cordial
hand. The lad’s feelings, chilled by his master’s haughtiness, at once melted, and took an
impression of my father’s kindness that was never effaced.”
The individual is so much a creature of his environment, that I must carry these details
a little farther. Forty years in public life, Judge Sedgwick had an extended acquaintance
and, according to the custom of the time, kept open house. “When I remember,” says
Miss Sedgwick, “how often the great gate swung open for the entrance of traveling vehi-
cles, the old mansion seems to me much more like an hostelrie [inn] of the olden time
than the quiet house it now is. My father’s hospitality was unbounded. It extended
from the gentleman in his coach, chaise, or on horseback, according to his means or
necessities, to the poor, lame beggar that would sit half the night roasting at the kitchen
fire with the servants. My father was in some sort the chieftain of his family, and his
home was their resort and resting-place. Uncles and aunts always found a welcome
there; cousins wintered and summered with us. Thus hospitality was an element in our
education. It elicited our faculties of doing and suffering. It smothered the love and habit
of minor comforts and petty physical indulgences that belong to a higher state of civi-
lization and generate selfishness, and it made regard for others, and small sacrifices for
them, a habit.”

Chapter 11: Life Flashing before Your Eyes: Memoirs and Biographies

Reading this nineteenth-century passage with twenty-first-century eyes, I’d like to send an
army of feminists to help out the Sedgwick women. However, I’ll settle for making these
points about the writing:
 As I’m sure you noticed, the most amazing thing about this chapter on Catharine Maria
Sedgwick is that she’s not really the subject of the passage. Catharine seems to have
followed the Puritan ideal in learning from her “modest and retiring” mother who
writes to her husband that “submission is my duty.” 
 A primary source for this passage is Catharine (“Miss Sedgwick”), who’s quoted several
times, though never about herself. The long quotation in the last paragraph about the
many people staying at the family house gives Catharine Maria Sedgwick her say, but
significantly, she conveys nothing about her own feelings. 
 The letter that her mother wrote to her father is also a source. Though the father is
described, he’s never quoted directly. 
A primary source is  an original document or an interview with a participant or witness.
A secondary source interprets primary sources.
 The sentences are quite long, and many contain both primary source information (quo-
tations) and interpretation, such as this sentence from the first paragraph: “However,
if he decides for a public career, she will submit: Submission is my duty, and however
hard, I will try to practice what reason teaches me I am under obligation to do.” A long
sentence allows for conditions — I’ll do this but . . . — and mirrors some of the conflict
described.
 The diction is formal. The missionary is “venerable,” not “old,” and the judge gives the
boy a “cordial,” not a “friendly” hand. This formality coincides with the position of the
judge, who has an important role in society.
 The author intrudes frequently to offer an evaluation, saying that Mrs. Sedgwick shows
“a becoming degree of respect” and that the “individual is so much a creature of his
environment.”
 The long anecdote about the “boy-of-all-work” who melts when he shakes hands with
the judge reveals the stratified society. The boy expects the “haughtiness” of his
employer and sometimes gets it, but kindness from people in superior positions is a
surprise and, the passage implies, an act of charity on the part of the judge.
A Boston businessman
This excerpt is from Joseph P. Kennedy: The Mogul, the Mob, the Statesman, and the Making
of an American Myth by Ted Schwarz (Wiley, 2003; reprinted with permission of John
Wiley and Sons, Inc.). The passage describes an associate of Joe Kennedy, father of President
John F. Kennedy.
Galen Stone was a writer who looked at business with the emotional distance required of
his profession. Upon arriving in Boston in the 1880s, Stone worked first for the Commercial
Bulletin and then for the Boston Advertiser. Having no stake in the businesses or the busi-
ness community itself, he learned to analyze companies, their products, their marketing,
and their competition. He saw what made one company successful and a rival fail to hold
its own. He could be coldly objective, yet he also understood the back room, where busi-
ness and politics intertwined.
Hayden, Stone, and Company was formed in 1892. Each man [Hayden and Stone] wanted
to utilize the skills of the other, though they decided that it was most practical for them
to work from two different cities. Boston was no longer at the center of the American
134

financial universe. Banking, insurance, the stock market, numerous corporate headquar-
ters, and the like were on the move to New York City. Boston still had old money and too
many businesses to ignore. By having Stone stay in Massachusetts and Hayden operate
from New York, they could commute by train to confer as needed while always being
available for any opportunities that might come along. Unfortunately for the longtime
friends, the separation exaggerated the differences in their personalities, and they grad-
ually found themselves acting increasingly autonomously.
Galen Stone had always been drawn to aggressive men in business. He saw in them a
trait that he lacked. They could move decisively, instinctively, and usually correctly in a
fraction of the time that he himself would take. Stone was the analyst, the man who
needed to know everything to write a story during his days as a reporter, and still was
uncomfortable if he did not have all the details to make a reasoned decision.
What went unsaid as Hayden, Stone [the firm] became respected not only for its ability
to invest in new businesses, helping it to great success, but also for its stock market pur-
chases, was that Stone was a man for whom laws would be written. He was a variation of
an insider trader, the type of man who gets rich through knowledge others were unable
to obtain. All other stockholders were at a disadvantage, especially the small buyer who
was becoming increasingly active in the years leading up to what would become the
Great Depression.
Stone used all his reporter’s training to gain contacts in businesses in which he was
interested or where he already had an investment. Then he would learn where the busi-
ness was headed. For example, if a company was introducing a new product line, Stone
would learn from marketing personnel if there were large orders pending or if the com-
pany was discovering that no one cared about the idea the owners thought would make
them rich. Then he would buy stock if the company was going to prosper and quietly
arrange to sell his stock if he thought the price was going to drop. More important, he
did not share this information with the majority of his customers, encouraging them to
buy what later would prove to be his own holdings, driving up the market value just
before the problem was revealed and the stock price drastically declined.
Stock manipulation through the use of still-secret corporate knowledge was not yet ille-
gal, though the public did not understand how the game was played and how their hold-
ings were being endangered. Eventually, such insider trading would become illegal, but
stock manipulation was merely unethical, a game a “gentleman did not play,” when Joe
Kennedy decided to make an appointment to see Galen Stone. Joe Kennedy probably
reminded Galen Stone of his longtime friend and business partner. Joe was familiar
with Stone because of his fame and because his father-in-law regularly worked with the
company. 
This is a tiny slice of a fine book, so you don’t get much sense of the character of Joseph P.
Kennedy here. The focus is on his first important business connection, Galen Stone, a former
reporter and financier. Here are the important points I noted:
 Though Kennedy is mentioned only in the last paragraph, the author states that he
“probably reminded Galen Stone of his longtime friend and business partner.” The
implication is that Kennedy would fit in nicely with Stone’s business style, which was
not illegal but was, the author says, “a game a ‘gentleman did not play.’” 
 The fact that the reference to Kennedy is located in the last paragraph means that the
enitre passage leads to him. He’s the focal point, the reason the rest of the passage was
included in the book. To put it another way: Galen Stone is important only because of
what he reveals about Joseph Kennedy.
 Within Galen Stone’s story, the logical thread tying everything together is his background
as a reporter and how the skills he acquired in journalism helped him in business.
135
Chapter 11: Life Flashing before Your Eyes: Memoirs and Biographies

 Throughout this excerpt, the author cites no primary sources. The lone quotation
(“a gentleman did not play”) isn’t attributed. The author therefore asks for the reader’s
trust.
 Much of the passage consists of the author’s interpretation. For example, Galen Stone
is said to have “emotional distance” as a reporter and to be someone who “could be
coldly objective” while understanding “the back room, where business and politics
intertwined.” The reader has to take these statements on faith.
 The fourth paragraph begins with an unusual sentence pattern: “What went unsaid . . .
was that Stone was a man for whom laws would be written.” (For grammar fans, “What
went unsaid” is a noun clause acting as a subject.) The noun clause works hand-in-
hand with “a game a ‘gentleman did not play.’” Such games have unwritten — and
therefore “unsaid” rules. Also, the paragraph emphasizes what is not said to other
investors (“knowledge others are unable to obtain”) — another connection to the
opening noun clause. 
 The mode of discourse of this piece is exposition (explanation), a fitting mode for an
author who wants to explain Joseph Kennedy’s life and, in this excerpt, those who
influenced Kennedy in his formative years.
 The author’s tone is detached and analytical. You can imagine him at a lectern, calmly
explaining Galen Stone and his effect on Joe Kennedy. Though the author makes judg-
ments (“Stone was a man for whom laws would be written”), he doesn’t use extreme
language and is careful to point out that Stone broke no laws.
When you’re reading biography, consider the sources cited (if any) and the author’s attitude
toward his or her subject. Acknowledge the author’s assumptions so that you can better
evaluate his views on the subject.

Chapter 12
You Talkin’ to Me? 
Letters and Speeches
In This Chapter
 Defining the characteristics of letters and speeches
 Understanding the connection between writer, audience, and reader
 Analyzing sample letters and speeches
T
he classic New York challenge, “You talkin’ to me?” fits the subject of this chapter per-
fectly. Letters and speeches are, by definition, created with an audience in mind. The audi-
ence may be one person (perhaps a letter to a friend or public official) or many (a speech to a
crowd or a letter to a newspaper, for instance). Regardless of size, the identity of the audience
is important. So is context, because the subject of a letter or speech generally arises from a
particular experience or need.
Your task, should a letter or a speech appear on your AP English Language and Composition
exam, is to understand how the writer navigated the rhetorical triangle. (Relax, it’s not a
paranormal spot like the Bermuda Triangle!) The rhetorical triangle diagrams the interaction
between subject, writer, and audience — important factors in all writing but a very big deal
in these genres. In this chapter I explain the conventions of letters and speeches and give
you a chance to practice your navigational . . . er, analytical skills.
Grasping the Essential Elements 
of Letters and Speeches
B4 TXTG — for the technology challenged, those letters and numbers translate as “before
texting” — letters were a literary form. In fact, writing a proper letter was considered a sign of
an educated and well-bred person. Pen an elegant letter, and you demonstrated that you were
fit for the top level of society. Compose an ill-phrased mess, and you were toast. Speeches, too,
have an illustrious history, though I bet the phrase “in conclusion” has always been a favorite,
whether the speech was delivered in a cave (by someone who lived there) or via podcast. 
Needless to say, the AP specializes in “literary letters,” those that accomplish their purpose
with style. And when the exam makers question you about a speech, they pick one that stirs
the spirit or informs the ignorant. Analyzing a letter or a speech is easy, as long as you know
what to look for. Keep an eye out for the elements of style described in the following sections.
When you’re analyzing a letter or a speech, check each point of the rhetorical triangle: the
subject, the writer, and the recipient. If you understand how the writing connects those
three, you’re on your way to a top score.

The identity of the author
Letters and speeches are an extremely personal art form. Therefore, your priority is to iden-
tify the author — not just the name, but the person behind the name. “Listen” to the author’s
voice as you read the passage. Pretend that you have an audio version of the text, playing
inside your head. What sort of person do you hear? How do you know? To the extent possible,
define the speaker or writer.
You may find it helpful to imagine that you’re an actor delivering the speech or reading the
letter as a voiceover (an unseen narrator). How would you play the role? Where would you
pause, speed up, change volume? What emotions would you portray? The answers to these
questions help you hear the author’s voice.
Distinguish between tone and voice
Voice is closely connected to tone, though voice tends to be a permanent expression of char-
acter and tone changes with the situation. For example, I’m a fairly easy going person who’s
prone to wisecracks. You hear my voice when you read this book — the same voice I use to
teach a class. However, my usual “I love my students” tone turns critical when a paper is
515 days overdue. To determine tone in a letter or a speech, pay close attention to diction
(word choice) and syntax (the way sentences are put together grammatically). For more
information on tone, turn to Chapter 4.
A favorite multiple-choice question concerns shifts, or changes, in tone. When you locate a
shift, determine why the change occurred. Often shifts are related to content.
Identify the audience
Always try to identify the audience: not the current reader (you!) but those who heard
the speech when it was given or were the intended recipient(s) of the letter. Sometimes the
introduction to the passage gives you this information, or the audience may be named in
the passage itself. The identity of the audience may also be implied, not stated. Once you
know the audience, consider how the writer attempts to connect. Often the writer looks for
common ground — shared experiences or beliefs. Sometimes the writer supplies an anec-
dote to demonstrate compassion or an understanding of others’ situations. Many speakers
and letter writers anticipate in advance how the audience will react and address that reac-
tion in advance.
Speeches and letters, especially public “letters to the editor,” play to a mixed audience. The
writer understands that some people agree and others disagree with the ideas expressed.
Determine how the writer handles this situation. Often, the writer argues several points, with
each idea appealing to a different group. 
Look for assumptions the writer has made
If you know the writer and the audience of a letter or speech, you may be able to identify
assumptions the writer has made. For example, suppose you’re reading a letter to the editor
of the school paper. The writer complains about an editorial calling for a cap on the number of
AP courses in which a student may enroll but never questions whether the school should
offer APs at all. The unspoken assumption is that AP courses should be available. (In some
schools, they aren’t.)
138
Part III: Meeting the Major Players: Types of Writing Found on the Exam 

Pay attention to content and style
Check content and style to determine the purpose of the letter or speech. The writer may
be arguing a point, imparting information, calming a worried or vengeful audience, or doing
something else entirely. As you read, continually ask why. Why has the writer made this
point? Why include that anecdote? The answers help you identify the author’s purpose.
Looking into the context in which the speech or letter was written
Knowing the situation in which the speech or letter was written may help you comprehend
its main points as well as its nuances. Lincoln’s famed speech delivered at his second inaugu-
ration reached out to a divided nation; the Civil War was about to end. A century later,
Martin Luther King, Jr., wrote Letter from a Birmingham Jail in the midst of the struggle for
civil rights, at a time when racial segregation was legal. The introduction to the passage may
give you information about the situation, as may the passage itself. 
If no information about the situation is supplied, the exam writers assume that everything
you need to know appears in the passage. If you’re writing an analytical essay on a letter or
speech, don’t bring in outside information (your understanding of history, psychology, sci-
ence, video games, belly-button lint, whatever) unless it applies directly to your analysis of
the rhetorical devices in the passage. The exam graders aren’t testing general knowledge.
They want to know that you understand how a great speech or letter is put together.
Common stylistic choices in speeches
Because speeches rely on the audience’s ears — and everyone spaces out from time to time! —
the speaker may use repetition to ensure that a point has been made. 
Speeches also frequently rely on extended metaphors. (A metaphor is an indirect comparison,
and an extended metaphor continues the comparison by adding detail to the initial metaphor.)
Metaphors give the audience a mental image, enhancing comprehension. For example, in his
famous “I Have a Dream” speech, Martin Luther King, Jr., compares justice to money in the
nation’s bank. He says that no check should come back stamped “insufficient funds.” His
message is conveyed by the metaphor: The United States has enough justice for everyone. 
Common stylistic choices in letters
Letters may also employ figurative language to make a point. Figurative language includes
metaphors, similes, symbols, and other devices that burrow into the reader’s imagination.
Chapter 4 explains figurative language in detail.
Because a reader can return to a letter again and again, letters seldom employ repetition. If
you find a repeated phrase, ask yourself whether the writer was careless, disorganized, or
simply emphatic. A careless or disorganized letter-writer may be a character created by the
author — a situation common in fiction but not unheard of in nonfiction. 
You’ve Got Mail: Letters
The College Board probably sends you a ton of mail — an admission ticket, information
about the time and place of the exam, your scores, and so forth. But you may also get a letter
from the makers of the AP English Language and Composition test as a question on the exam.
One exam asked students to comment on a letter and response between a reader and Randy
Cohen, author of “The Ethicist” column for The New York Times. And although nonfiction is
the norm, letters extracted from novels or short stories are fair game.
139
Chapter 12: You Talkin’ to Me? Letters and Speeches

Prepare yourself by analyzing these two letters. Read each carefully and jot down everything
you can think of about its style. Use the points in the preceding section (“Grasping the
Essential Elements of Letters and Speeches”) as a guide. Also take notes on content. After
each letter is a list of points I noted. Compare your ideas to mine.
The subject of the letter — war, love, civil rights, what to bring home as a souvenir — should
be easy to identify. Once you know what the letter is about, consider the subject in light of
the writer and recipient. How does each relate to the subject?
Jane Austen: from Isabella Thorpe
Although Jane Austen wrote fiction, her letters are fit material for the AP English exam
because (a) they’re beautifully written and (b) they match writer, subject, and audience per-
fectly. They’re also hysterically funny. Take a look at this letter (slightly shortened), taken
from Northanger Abbey. The letter-writer, Isabella Thorpe, is in the English resort town of
Bath. The brother of the recipient, Catherine Moreland, was engaged to Isabella, but Isabella
broke up with him.
My dearest Catherine, I received your two kind letters with the greatest delight, and have
a thousand apologies to make for not answering them sooner. I really am quite ashamed of
my idleness; but in this horrid place one can find time for nothing. I have had my pen in
my hand to begin a letter to you almost every day since you left Bath, but have always
been prevented by some silly trifler or other. Pray write to me soon, and direct to my own
home. Thank God, we leave this vile place tomorrow. Since you went away, I have had no
pleasure in it — the dust is beyond anything; and everybody one cares for is gone. I
believe if I could see you I should not mind the rest, for you are dearer to me than any-
body can conceive. I am quite uneasy about your dear brother, not having heard from him
since he went to Oxford; and am fearful of some misunderstanding. Your kind offices will
set all right: he is the only man I ever did or could love, and I trust you will convince him
of it. The spring fashions are partly down; and the hats the most frightful you can imagine.
I hope you spend your time pleasantly, but am afraid you never think of me. . . . I rejoice to
say that the young man whom, of all others, I particularly abhor, has left Bath. You will
know, from this description, I must mean Captain Tilney, who, as you may remember, was
amazingly disposed to follow and tease me, before you went away. Afterwards he got
worse, and became quite my shadow. Many girls might have been taken in, for never were
such attentions; but I knew the fickle sex too well. He went away to his regiment two days
ago, and I trust I shall never be plagued with him again. . . . The last two days he was
always by the side of Charlotte Davis: I pitied his taste, but took no notice of him. The last
time we met was in Bath Street, and I turned directly into a shop that he might not speak
to me; I would not even look at him. . . . Such a contrast between him and your brother!
Pray send me some news of the latter — I am quite unhappy about him; he seemed so

Dear Novelist
A measure of letters’ importance in the world of literature
is the fact that entire novels have been created from
them. This genre is known as the epistolary novel.
(“Epistle” is a fancy term for “letter.”) Jane Austen’s Lady
Susan, Fyodor Dostoevsky’s Poor Folk, Wolfgang von
Goethe’s The Sorrows of Young Werther, and Alice
Walker’s The Color Purple are all epistolary novels. The
epistolary form has several advantages: Letters express
a strong, personal viewpoint and therefore help the nov-
elist create a character. If only one letter-writer is repre-
sented, the reader has the pleasure of imagining the
response of the letter’s recipient. If an exchange of letters
is included, the relationship between the letter-writers
becomes the focus of the novel.

uncomfortable when he went away, with a cold, or something that affected his spirits.
I would write to him myself, but have mislaid his direction; and, as I hinted above, am
afraid he took something in my conduct amiss. Pray explain everything to his satisfaction;
or, if he still harbours any doubt, a line from himself to me, or a call at Putney when next in
town, might set all to rights. I have not been to the rooms this age, nor to the play, except
going in last night with the Hodges, for a frolic, at half price: they teased me into it; and I
was determined they should not say I shut myself up because Tilney was gone. . . . Anne
Mitchell had tried to put on a turban like mine, as I wore it the week before at the concert,
but made wretched work of it—it happened to become my odd face, I believe, at least
Tilney told me so at the time, and said every eye was upon me; but he is the last man
whose word I would take. I wear nothing but purple now: I know I look hideous in it, but
no matter—it is your dear brother’s favourite colour. Lose no time, my dearest, sweetest
Catherine, in writing to him and to me, Who ever am, etc.
Having an older brother myself, I remember times when my “best friends” tried to use me
to get a date with him. But I think Isabella’s letter is fairly transparent even without that
experience! It abounds with contradictions, bare-faced lies, and ill-concealed pleas. Now for
the details:
 The writer of the letter, Isabella Thorpe, is immediately revealed as untrustworthy.
Although Catherine is supposedly “dearer” to Isabella “than all the rest,” she hasn’t
answered two letters Catherine sent her. 
 Isabella constantly contradicts herself. She says that she took “no notice” of Captain
Tilney, but the “last time we met was in Bath Street, and I turned directly into a shop
that he might not speak to me.” Sounds like “notice” to me! She also claims to love
Catherine’s brother, but she can’t even find his address. She says she hasn’t gone out,
but she describes several excursions. These contradictions create Austen’s comic
tone; the reader perceives the gap between what Isabella says and what she means.
 Isabella explains that Captain Tilney “was amazingly disposed to follow and tease me”
before Catherine left Bath. Isabella says that “afterwards he got worse, and became
quite my shadow.” Though Isabella says that she wasn’t taken in by Tilney, she men-
tions that he “was always by the side of Charlotte Davis.” You don’t have to be a rocket
scientist to figure out that Isabella went after Captain Tilney, but Captain Tilney
dumped Isabella.
 Although Isabella claims to despise Captain Tilney (“the young man whom, of all
others, I particularly abhor”), she refers to a turban that “happened to become [look
good] my odd face, I believe, at least Tilney told me so at the time.” Her hopes for a
match with Tilney are obvious.
 Isabella, having dumped Catherine’s brother, pretends that he may have gone away
“misunderstanding” her. She says that he “seemed so uncomfortable when he went
away, with a cold, or something that affected his spirits.” Isabella hopes that Catherine
will convince her brother that what happened (the dumping) didn’t really happen
and that Catherine’s brother will take her back. Clearly, Isabella assumes that her
audience — Catherine — is gullible enough to believe these lies.
 The letter is disorganized; Isabella hops from an important topic (the engagement) to
the fact that “spring fashions are partly down; and the hats the most frightful you can
imagine.” Similarly, she moves from her social activities to the feelings of Catherine’s
brother to comments at a play . . . and again to fashion (Anne Mitchell’s turban and the
fact that Isabella wears purple because “it is your dear brother’s favourite colour”).
The disorganization reflects Isabella’s lack of restraint. She can’t follow rules of writing,
nor can she follow the ethical rules that govern male/female relationships.
 Isabella’s overly long, tangled sentences, such as “Pray explain . . . all to rights” or
“Anne Mitchell . . . would take” mirror her botched love life. 
141
Chapter 12: You Talkin’ to Me? Letters and Speeches

 Isabella lies, but in terms of language, she plays it straight. She’s not smart enough to
employ figurative language or irony. She does take everything to extremes, however.
Catherine is “dearer to me than anybody can conceive” and Tilney isn’t just disliked;
she “abhor(s)” him. Isabella says that she looks “hideous” in purple, not simply
“unattractive.” Isabella’s choice of strong words adds to her characterization; she’s
insincere — an exaggerator who’ll say anything to get her way.
Washington Irving to his publisher
Washington Irving, the famed author of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and many other works,
wrote a letter in 1824, excerpted here, to his publisher after completing some requested
revisions. 
I am at Brighton just on the point of embarking for France. I have dragged myself out of
London, as a horse drags himself out of the slough [swamp], or a fly out of a honey-pot,
almost leaving a limb behind him at every tug. Not that I have been immersed in plea-
sure and surrounded by sweets, but rather up to the ears in ink and harassed by
printers’ devils. 
I never have had such . . . altering, adding, and correcting; and I have been detained
beyond all patience by the delays of the press. Yesterday I absolutely broke away, with-
out waiting for the last sheets. They are to be sent after me here by mail, to be corrected
this morning, or else they must take their chance. From the time I first started pen in
hand on this work, it has been nothing but hard driving with me.
I have not been able to get to Tunbridge to see the Donegals, which I really and greatly
regret. Indeed I have seen nobody except a friend or two who had the kindness to hunt
me out. Among these was Mr. Story, and I ate a dinner there that it took me a week to
digest, having been obliged to swallow so much hard-favored nonsense from a loud-
talking baronet whose name, thank God, I forget, but who maintained Byron was not a
man of courage, and therefore his poetry was not readable. I was really afraid he would
bring John Story to the same way of thinking.
I went a few evenings since to see Kenney’s new piece, the Alcaid. It went off lamely, and
the Alcaid is rather a bore, and comes near to be generally thought so. Poor Kenney
came to my room next evening, and I could not believe that one night could have ruined
a man so completely. I swear to you I thought at first it was a flimsy suit of clothes had
left some bedside and walked into my room without waiting for the owner to get up; or
that it was one of those frames on which clothiers stretch coats at their shop doors;
until I perceived a thin face sticking edgeways out of the collar of the coat like the axe in
a bundle of fasces. He was so thin, and pale, and nervous, and exhausted — he made a
dozen difficulties in getting over a spot in the carpet, and never would have accom-
plished it if he had not lifted himself over by the points in his shirt-collar.
I saw Rogers just as I was leaving town. I had not time to ask him any particulars about
you, and indeed he is not exactly the man from whom I would ask news about my
friends. I dined tête-à-tête with him some time ago, and he served up his friends as he
served up his fish, with a squeeze of lemon over each. It was very piquant, but it rather
set my teeth on edge....
Farewell, my dear Moore. Let me hear from you, if but a line; particularly if my work
pleases you, but don’t say a word against it. I am easily put out of humor with what I do.
142
Part III: Meeting the Major Players: Types of Writing Found on the Exam 

Because I’ve spent more than a few hours revising my writing, I sympathize with Washington
Irving. But there’s more in Irving’s letter than a weary writer’s complaint, as you see in this list:
 Irving begins in a humorous tone, saying he’s “dragged himself out of London” the way
a horse or a fly emerges from a trap. Hyperbole (literary exaggeration) shows up imme-
diately, as Irving was left “a limb behind . . . at every tug.” He is “up to the ears in ink”
(another hyperbole). Although Irving complains, he also does the work. He comes
across as responsible.
 Next, the tone becomes businesslike. Irving reports on the last sheets that “are to be
sent after me here by mail, to be corrected this morning.” He is serious when he says
that “it has been nothing but hard driving with me” on his current writing project. Once
again, the writer is revealed as a serious man; he’ll accomplish his task (revision) in a
timely way.
 In paragraph three, Irving again shifts from business to comedy. He recounts a dinner
that took “a week to digest,” not because of the food but because of an obnoxious
dinner guest who didn’t appreciate the poet Byron. Irving assumes that the recipient of
the letter shares Irving’s own admiration of Byron’s work. This paragraph portrays the
writer (Irving) and the recipient as poetry fans.
 Paragraph four discusses a mutual acquaintance, and again Irving turns to comic
exaggeration. The acquaintance, Kenney, was so thin that he at first appears to be
“a flimsy suit of clothes” without a body inside and he has to lift himself over a spot in
the carpet. Though Irving mocks Kenney, the tone is affectionate. The bond between
writer and recipient is strengthened here.
 Paragraph five has more of a bite to it. Rogers, another mutual acquaintance, “served up
his friends as he served up his fish, with a squeeze of lemon over each.” This sentence
implies that Rogers was willing to use his friends’ reputation as a dinner diversion — a
cruel act. Irving criticizes Rogers by commenting that Rogers’ actions “rather set my
teeth on edge.” Again, the reader sees that the writer trusts his audience (the recipient
of the letter); Irving’s criticism would be omitted if the relationship were shaky.
 The letter as a whole reveals a hardworking author with ethical standards. He’s willing
to mock people but not destroy them, and he draws a line between his own comments
and Rogers’.
 Irving assumes that the recipient of the letter will understand the personalities of the
people mentioned. He doesn’t bother with background information. Also, the fact that
personal items appear in the letter suggests that the relationship between Irving and
his publisher was more than business; they were friends as well.
 The most important rhetorical device is hyperbole, but imagery — sensory details —
appear in paragraph four and elsewhere. Irving wants to bring his friend into this world
and share experiences with him, not simply report basic facts.
 The purpose of the letter is to inform, but Irving adds an element of entertainment.
(He was a novelist, after all!)
As I Was Saying: Speeches
A few years ago I checked out a DVD from my school library. Its title was something like “The
Ten Best Speeches in the History of the World.” All ten were in English and, naturally, all had
been captured on film. Apparently no great speeches were delivered before technology made
them suitable for sale, and no one ever gave a top-ten speech in another language. (As we
say in New York: yeah, right.) 
143
Chapter 12: You Talkin’ to Me? Letters and Speeches

If you encounter a speech on your AP exam, it will be in English, and it will be very good, if
not one of the greatest of all time. So that you can practice your speech-interpretation, I’ve
selected two presidential addresses, given about a hundred years apart. Take a look at these
two, and annotate them as you read. Then compare your comments with mine.
Lyndon Johnson: State of the Union Address 
In 1964, with the nation still reeling from the assassination of President John F. Kennedy a few
weeks before, President Lyndon Johnson made this speech to a joint session of Congress.
His “state of the union address,” which every president must deliver once a year, is
excerpted here.
Let this session of Congress be known as the session which did more for civil rights than
the last hundred sessions combined; as the session which enacted the most far-reaching
tax cut of our time; as the session which declared all-out war on human poverty and
unemployment in these United States; as the session which finally recognized the health
needs of all our older citizens; as the session which reformed our tangled transportation
and transit policies; as the session which achieved the most effective, efficient foreign
aid program ever; and as the session which helped to build more homes, more schools,
more libraries, and more hospitals than any single session of Congress in the history of
our Republic. . . .
If we fail, if we fritter and fumble away our opportunity in needless, senseless quarrels
between Democrats and Republicans, or between the House and the Senate, or between
the South and North, or between the Congress and the administration, then history will
rightfully judge us harshly. But if we succeed, if we can achieve these goals by forging in
this country a greater sense of union, then, and only then, can we take full satisfaction in
the State of the Union. 
Here in the Congress you can demonstrate effective legislative leadership by discharg-
ing the public business with clarity and dispatch, voting each important proposal up, or
voting it down, but at least bringing it to a fair and a final vote.
Let us carry forward the plans and programs of John Fitzgerald Kennedy — not because
of our sorrow or sympathy, but because they are right. In his memory today, I especially
ask all members of my own political faith, in this election year, to put your country
ahead of your party, and to always debate principles; never debate personalities. . . .
This budget, and this year’s legislative program, are designed to help each and every
American citizen fulfill his basic hopes — his hopes for a fair chance to make good; his
hopes for fair play from the law; his hopes for a full-time job on full-time pay; his hopes
for a decent home for his family in a decent community; his hopes for a good school for
his children with good teachers; and his hopes for security when faced with sickness or
unemployment or old age. 
Unfortunately, many Americans live on the outskirts of hope — some because of their
poverty, and some because of their color, and all too many because of both. Our task is
to help replace their despair with opportunity. This administration today, here and now,
declares unconditional war on poverty in America. I urge this Congress and all
Americans to join with me in that effort.
It will not be a short or easy struggle, no single weapon or strategy will suffice, but we
shall not rest until that war is won. The richest Nation on earth can afford to win it. We
cannot afford to lose it.

Part III: Meeting the Major Players: Types of Writing Found on the Exam 

As you see from this small excerpt, Johnson knew how to capture his audience. (You can
almost hear the applause between paragraphs.) Here’s what I gleaned from this passage:
 Parallelism is a dominant rhetorical device. (Parallelism occurs when elements of the
sentence performing the same function have the same grammatical identity.) Notice all
the “as the session” statements in paragraph one, the “if we” comments in paragraph
two, and the “his hope” statements in paragraph five. Parallel statements give each ele-
ment in the list equal weight. The repetition which goes hand-in-hand with parallelism
creates a sense of urgency and infuses passion. In the first paragraph, the parallelism
emphasizes Congress’s duty — what it must accomplish during this “session.” In the
second paragraph, Johnson presents two alternatives, success and failure. Failure
dooms Congress in the eyes of history; success brings “full satisfaction.” In the fifth
paragraph, Johnson personalizes the message by bringing in “each and every American
citizen” and referring to a representative individual — “he.” 
 Although Johnson reportedly had a healthy ego, in this speech he spotlights Congress
and its work. The pronoun “we” emphasizes shared responsibility. If Congress fails, so
will Johnson. If it succeeds, so will the President. These two rhetorical devices are
Johnson’s attempt to connect with his audience, the senators, and representatives. 
 The American people, listening to this speech on television, are also an audience for
Johnson. His comments about the “basic hopes” of “each and every American citizen”
are designed to hit the audience’s major concerns — “a fair chance,” “fair play,” a good
job, “a decent home for his family,” good schools, and security. These are universal
needs; Johnson, speaking in an era of racial segregation, reminds the audience that
they have much in common.
 Johnson invokes the memory of the assassinated Kennedy, but not in a morbid way. He
concentrates on what is “right” (Kennedy’s programs and policies), not a tribute to the
dead president (“sorrow or sympathy”).
 Johnson, a career politician, assumes that politics and political victories are important
to his audience. However, he asks Congress to aim higher, and he singles out “all mem-
bers of my own political faith” — his party — to put the country “ahead of your party.”
The purpose of the speech is to inspire Congress to greater goals.
 The famous line from this speech is Johnson’s declaration of “war on poverty.” The
metaphor (the war won’t be waged against enemy soldiers but against socioeconomic
factors) is so powerful that it’s been appropriated many times since Johnson’s day
(war on drugs, war on terror, and so on).
 The shift in the last paragraph is significant. Johnson begins with the “richest Nation
on earth can afford to win” the war on poverty, a third-person statement. Then he
moves to first-person plural (“We cannot afford to lose it”). Johnson’s giving the victory
to the country but failure to himself and Congress.
Abraham Lincoln: The Gettysburg Address
On November 19, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln traveled to a battlefield near Gettysburg,
Pennsylvania, the site of a particularly bloody battle of the Civil War, which was still raging as
he spoke. Though the speech is short, it is deservedly famous.
Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new
nation: conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created
equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any
nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield
of that war.
145
Chapter 12: You Talkin’ to Me? Letters and Speeches

We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who
here gave their lives that this nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we
should do this. But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we
cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have
consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note,
nor long remember, what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.
It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who
fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to
the great task remaining before us, that from these honored dead we take increased
devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion, that we
here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under
God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the
people, for the people, shall not perish from this earth.
Magnificent, isn’t it? I can’t read it without a lump in my throat. The sentiments, but also the
rhetorical devices Lincoln employed, moved his audience as they listened on the battlefield.
They touch the audience today as well. I noted these points:
 The speech begins with a reference to time, using the Biblical measure (“score” —
twenty years). Thus Lincoln immediately emphasizes history and religion. The nation
has endured for 87 years and, through the Civil War, it is being tested. 
 The reference to “fathers” in the first sentence brings in family; the nation was created
by “fathers” and hence is a kind of family and therefore should not be broken apart.
 The first paragraph begins with two long sentences and finishes with a short, factual
statement: “We are met on a great battlefield of that war.” The next paragraph contains a
transition (“to dedicate a portion of that field”) and states the purpose of the speech —
to create a cemetery for those who died.
 In paragraph two, the parallel “we cannot” statements pull attention away from the
audience and the speaker, because “we” can’t do anything. The important deeds have
already been done, by the soldiers who fought there. These parallel statements under-
line Lincoln’s theme: the greatness of what happened at Gettysburg and the impor-
tance of those who fought there. 
 Though Lincoln employs first-person plural, he never goes to singular (“I”). He sub-
merges himself in the cause.
 Paragraph two ends with a sentence placing actions above words. What Lincoln says
won’t be remembered (he was wrong on that point), but the soldiers’ bravery will
never be forgotten.
 The last paragraph explains Lincoln’s main point again: the war is “unfinished work”
and “the great task remaining before us” — to win the war. Lincoln’s audience, wearied
and grieved by war, must not give up. 
 The final sentence is very long and builds in tension and zeal. Lincoln asks his audi-
ence to rededicate itself to that “cause for which they gave the last full measure of
devotion” — the war. He refers to “this nation, under God,” which “shall have a new
birth of freedom,” and he states three parallel phrases that are justly famous: “govern-
ment of the people, by the people, for the people.” The parallelism makes all three ele-
ments equal: People make up the government, they wield power, and they act in the
people’s interests.
 The speech ends with a rousing affirmation of the Union. With rededication to the
cause, Lincoln declares, the United States and its system of government “shall not
perish from this earth.”

Chapter 13
Sizing Up Citations
In This Chapter
 Understanding how citations are tested
 Decoding parenthetical citations
 Identifying elements of foot- and endnotes
A
couple of years ago the College Board announced that the AP English Language and
Composition exam would include multiple-choice questions on citations — the aca-
demic world’s way of crediting sources for quotations, information, and ideas. AP English
Language teachers immediately went into a tizzy. (Yes, I know. We English teachers really
need to get a life.) Rumors abounded, and for the most part they were as accurate as
rumors usually are — not very.
But you don’t have to rely on rumors. This chapter contains the real deal about citation
questions on the AP test. I tell you what you’re likely to encounter and take you on a guided
tour of book, article, and electronic citations, pointing out the minor variations in various
citation styles. 
Scoring Three Easy Points: Citation Questions
The College Board never guarantees that one AP test will resemble another in every detail,
so I can’t determine for sure how many multiple-choice source-citation questions your partic-
ular torture (sorry, exam) will include. However, since they made their debut in 2007, the
number of citation questions has been minimal: only three. I imagine right about now you’re
thinking, “Three questions? Why should I bother reading this?” And if you’re pressed for
time, by all means skip to another chapter if you wish. However, citation questions are easy,
and if you have a few minutes to devote to them, you can grab three points with very little
effort. Not a bad deal! Here’s what you’re likely to see:
 Only multiple-choice questions. You have to insert your own citations when you write
a synthesis essay (Chapter 16 tells you how), but you won’t need to comment on cita-
tions in any passage of the free-response (essay) section.
 Questions on foot- or endnotes. Oddly enough, because English teachers usually
require parenthetical citations, the AP exam usually quizzes you about foot- or end-
notes. In case they break with tradition and hit you with parenthetical citations,
I review them, along with their bibliographic references.
Foot- or endnotes aren’t always references to the original source material. Some
notes discuss side points — differing views of a historical situation or a digression
that doesn’t fit smoothly into the text. A multiple-choice question may ask about infor-
mation in this type of foot- or endnote.

 Two identification questions. The multiple-choice questions generally ask you to
select a true statement from a list of five options. To answer this kind of question, you
need to know what each element in the citation represents — the title, editor, place or
date of publication, and so forth.
 One interpretation question. An interpretation question asks you to evaluate the
sources overall. For instance, they may give you a passage with five footnotes, three of
which come from the same book by Charles Weatherby. Your task is to choose the true
statement from answers (A) to (E). The answer will be something like “The author
relied heavily on Charles Weatherby’s work.” 
 MLA-style source citations. Although the College Board says that citation questions
may be from any style, English teachers prefer the format of the Modern Language
Association. (Get it? English is a language!) Thus far, MLA style has been more promi-
nent on the AP exam than other styles. Because your time is limited, I concentrate on
MLA citations. I do explain the minor differences of other styles, however. 
 Outmoded features. The academic world does move (though frankly snails are world-
record sprinters compared to English professors), and citations created now differ
slightly from older citations. The exam makers know that college students sometimes
have to consult older works, and thus they put some old-fashioned citations on the
test. (Not to worry: I cover the old as well as the new in this chapter.)
One piece of good news: The exam makers will never ask you where to put the comma or
parentheses or any other piece of punctuation. All you do is decode, not create (except when
you cite sources in the synthesis essay, as I explain in Chapter 16).
Locating Essential Elements of Citations
When you’re answering a citation question, look for a short identification tag in the text,
directly following the material being cited. The identification tag may be inserted in paren-
theses or may appear as a number placed above the line of text. The numbers correspond to
footnotes or endnotes. The identification tag is tied to a more complete statement about the
original source. Parenthetical citations (explained in more detail in the next section) refer the
reader to a source list (also known as a “works cited” list). Numbers send you to foot- or end-
notes. On the AP exam, the passages fit on a single page, so footnotes and endnotes appear
the same. (In the real world, footnotes are at the bottom of a page and endnotes at the end of
a chapter or a book, and all the information is repeated in a source list, with a slightly differ-
ent format.)

Part III: Meeting the Major Players: Types of Writing Found on the Exam 
What this year’s footnote is wearing: Citation styles
When I was little, my friends and I formed a club com-
plete with a secret handshake and an official-looking
sign that barred non-club members from our “head-
quarters.” The club filled a fairly universal need: By cre-
ating a set of rules and excluding others, club members
bonded with one another. I think about that club every
time I look at citation styles. Each academic subject has
its own preferred way to cite sources, but really, the dif-
ferences are miniscule. The main purpose, I believe, is
to be able to say, “In my subject we cite this way.”
The three major styles are MLA (the Modern Language
Association), APA (the American Psychological
Association), and CMS (from the University of Chicago’s
Manual of Style). MLA style shows up in the humanities—
literature and languages, history, and the like. The APA
format covers the sciences (biology, chemistry, and so
forth) and social sciences such as psychology and soci-
ology. The CMS is used by all disciplines, possibly because
it offers a lot of choices, and by many publishers.

Regardless of style, all citations contain a couple of essential elements, either in the foot- or
endnotes or in the source list:
 Author(s). The author’s name is usually the first thing you see. If the piece has more
than one author, you see all the names or, in the case of a team effort, the principal
author and the phrase “et al.”
If no author’s name is available, the foot- or endnote begins with the title. If the work
was written by an employee of an organization (the nonexistent National Institute of
Comedy, for example), the organization may replace the author’s name.
 Title(s). If the citation refers to a book, the title is underlined or italicized. Article titles
are placed inside quotation marks. Following the article title is the name of the book or
magazine containing the article. The book or magazine name is underlined or italicized.
 Publishing information (book). For citations to a book, the place of publication (New
York, Berlin, London, and so forth), the name of the company, and the date of publica-
tion appear — generally in that order. 
 Publishing information (magazines and journals). Citations to a magazine include the
date of the issue (month and year for a monthly publication, month and day and year
for a weekly). Citations to a journal are a little more complicated. Most journals assign
a volume number, which normally corresponds to the number of years the journal has
been published. Within one year, each issue has a number also. A colon separates the
volume number from the issue number. The volume number always precedes the issue
number. For example, a journal citation containing “8:2” came out in the second issue
of volume 8. To make your life even more fun, journals often add dates to the volume
and issue numbers, or drop the issue number entirely.
Scientific material is date sensitive; the treatment for tuberculosis in 1950 is quite dif-
ferent from the treatment today, for example. Therefore, citations for a science passage
place the date of publication toward the beginning of the citation, right after the
author’s name.
 Page number(s). If the whole work is referenced, you may not see a page number.
However, most citations contain a page number or a range of pages. The page number
is usually the last number in the citation.
 Web address (electronic sources). Some material on the Web is simply an electronic
version of a printed journal or magazine, so those citations include everything listed in
the preceding bullet points plus the Web address, also known as the URL. Web
addresses are very long and start with “www” or “http.” 
 Date accessed (electronic sources). Because the Web is updated every nanosecond
or so, material you find one day may not be there the next. Citations including the
date accessed explain to the reader when you found the information. The words “date
accessed” appear, to distinguish that date from the date of publication.
Depending upon the source, you may also see an editor or translator’s name, an edition
number, and some other strange stuff. Most of these items are easily identifiable (“3rd ed.”
for “third edition” or “trans.” for “translated”). Check out “Moving Past the Basics” at the end
of this chapter for examples of weird citations.
Picking Apart Parenthetical Citations
In the synthesis essay (see Chapter 16), most students cite sources parenthetically. The
parentheses show up directly following the material taken from the source (even in the
middle of the sentence) and contain just enough words to identify the source and the page
149
Chapter 13: Sizing Up Citations

number the material appeared on. If the source is identified in the sentence, the parenthesis
contains only the page number. Here are two examples, one with the name in the text and
one without:
NAME IN TEXT: Arthur Boddy’s theory of comedy (22) elevates bubble gum above
banana peels on the Ashworth Hilarity Scale.
NAME NOT IN TEXT: One theory of comedy (Boddy 22) elevates bubble gum above
banana peels on the Ashworth Hilarity Scale.
Both parenthetical citations tell you the same thing. On page 22 of a source written by some-
one named Boddy there’s a statement that bubble gum is funnier than banana peels. 
If more than one work by the same author is cited, an extra word — usually one word from
the title — is included in the parentheses: (Boddy, Gum 22). If two authors have the same last
name, the first initial is added to the parentheses: (O. Boddy 22).
Of course, you can’t tell from the parenthetical citation exactly what Boddy wrote. For that
information, you turn to the source list (which may be printed after the passage on the AP
exam). The source list used to be called a bibliography, from the Greek word for book. These
days researchers usually tap into electronic sources, so the term bibliography has morphed
into the more neutral list of sources, reference list, or works cited. The AP English Language
and Composition exam isn’t going to waste time and paper on a comprehensive source list.
In a passage with foot- or endnotes, the source list probably won’t appear at all. However, if
the passage has parenthetical notes, a short source list will probably be included.
In a source list, here’s what you might see (in your imagination only, as this is a fictitious
work I created) for different kinds of sources:
 Citation to a book::
Boddy, Oliver. The Ashworth Hilarity Scale. New York: Comic Press, 2008.
This source citation informs you that Oliver Boddy wrote a book entitled The Ashworth
Hilarity Scale. It was published in 2008 by Comic Press, a company located in New York. 
 Citation to a journal article:
Boddy, Oliver. “Bubble Gum and Banana Peel.” Journal of Food Comedy 4:3 (2008): 
22–32.
This source cites an article entitled “Bubble Gum and Banana Peel” that was printed in
a magazine entitled Journal of Food Comedy. The volume number is 4, and the issue
number is 3. The year in parenthesis, 2008, is the year the article appeared. The article
was on pages 22–32. 
With your sharp eyes, you may have noticed that the parenthetical reference in the
text says “22,” but the source list says “22–32.” The article is ten pages long, but the
“Ashworth” bubble-gum/banana rating is discussed only on one page — number 22.
 Citation to an article that comes from the Web:
Boddy, Oliver. “Bubble Gum and Banana Peel.” Food Comedy-Net. Spring 2008. 
Standup Comedians United. 30 September 2008 http://www.fcnscu.org/gun.html
This citation indicates that Boddy’s article, still entitled “Bubble Gum and Banana
Peel,” was published on the Food Comedy-Net Web site, which was created by a group
called Standup Comedians United. The article was accessed on September 30, 2008.
The Web address is http://www.fcnscu.org/gun.html. 
As interesting as these articles sound, don’t go looking for them. The article, author, pub-
lisher, and Web address are all fake. I made them up!

Unlocking the Secrets of Foot- and Endnotes
The format for foot- or endnotes closely follows that of the source list, which I explain in
“Picking Apart Parenthetical Citations” earlier in this chapter. In this section I show you some
sample foot- and endnotes, with explanations. But first, here’s how the foot- or endnote
number appears in the text, with and without a quotation:
TEXT WITH QUOTATION: Boddy declared that bubble gum “sticks to the audience’s
funny bone.”3
TEXT WITHOUT QUOTATION: Boddy wrote about the effect of bubble gum on the audi-
ence’s sense of humor.3
Okay, now for samples of foot- and endnote format. (Don’t look for these sources anywhere
except inside my head, where they were created.) 
 Citation for a book:
3. Oliver Boddy, The Ashworth Hilarity Scale (New York: Comic Press, 2008), 22.
This citation informs you that Oliver Boddy is the author of a book entitled The
Ashworth Hilarity Scale, which was published by a company called Comic Press in 2008.
The company is located in New York, and the information or quotation comes from
page 22.
 Citation for an article:
3. Oliver Boddy, “Bubble Gum and Banana Peel,” Journal of Food Comedy, 4
(August 2008): 22.
In this note, Oliver Boddy wrote an article entitled “Bubble Gum and Banana Peel,”
which was published in volume 4 of the Journal of Food Comedy, published in August
2008 on page 22.
 Citation for an electronic source:
3. Oliver Boddy, “Bubble Gum and Banana Peel,” Food Comedy-Net,
http://www.fcnscu.org/gun.html (accessed August 9, 2008).
In this note, Boddy’s article is still called “Bubble Gum and Banana Peel.” It was
accessed on August 9, 2008, at the Web address above. The Web site’s title is italicized.
I can’t give examples of every possible note, because you’d have to rent a forklift to move this
book from one side of your room to another. Come to think of it, you’d have to rent an extra
room just for this book. However, the basics are all here, with a couple of exceptions. (See
“Moving Past the Basics: Some Strange Citation Cases” in this chapter for more information.)
Moving Past the Basics: Some Strange
Citation Cases
Okay, maybe “strange” is too strong a word. But a few special cases do show up on the AP
exam from time to time: an article in a book edited by someone else, a couple of (outdated)
Latin terms, multiple authors, translators, revised editions, and so forth. This section takes
you through the variations you may encounter.

Chapter 13: Sizing Up Citations

Multiple authors
Life would be simpler if every source had only one author. Sadly (for you), some writers work
with their friends. Citations to multiple authors look like this:
 Parenthetical citation: 
In a ground-breaking study of the Ashworth Hilarity Scale (Boddy, Smith, and
Wickham 22), bubble gum rated higher than banana peels.
 Foot- or endnote, book:
3. Oliver Boddy, Jane Smith, and Martin Wickham, Bubble Gum and Banana Peel
(New York: Comic Press, 2008), 22.
 Source list, book:
Boddy, Oliver, Jane Smith, and Martin Wickham. Bubble Gum and Banana Peel.
New York: Comic Press. 2008.
 Source list, article:
Boddy, Oliver, Jane Smith, and Martin Wickham. “Bubble Gum and Banana Peel.” 
Journal of Food Comedy 4:3 (2008): 22–32.
 Source list, electronic source:
Boddy, Oliver, Jane Smith, and Martin Wickham. “Bubble Gum and Banana Peel.” 
Food Comedy-Net. Spring 2008. Standup Comedians United. 30 September 2008 
http://www.fcnscu.org/gun.html.
Translators, editors, and editions
Translations and editions are fairly easy because the abbreviations “trans.” and “ed.” appear,
as in these examples: 
 Source list, translated book:
SanMiguel, Eduardo. La Comedia de la Comida. Trans. Eugene Partridge. London: 
Omnivore, 2009.
This citation tells you that the book by Eduardo SanMiguel was translated by Eugene
Partridge. 
 Source list, article in a book:
SanMiguel, Eduardo. “Food Fight Fun.” In The Comedy of Food, edited by Eugene 
Partridge. London: Omnivore, 2009.
In this example, Mr. Partridge edited a book containing an article by Eduardo
SanMiguel.
 Footnote, book:
Eduardo SanMiguel, The Tragedy of Breakfast, 3rd ed. (New York: Omnivore,
2009), 22.
Editions may be numbered, as you see in the “3rd. ed.” reference above. Sometimes
“rev.” replaces the number. The abbreviation “rev. ed.” stands for “revised edition.”

References to other citations
Adding more delight to AP exam day, sometimes a source citation refers to something that
was taken from still another source. Latin abbreviations were once common shortcuts in
citations, but now they’re considered so-o-o-o last century. If you encounter them, “ibid”
means “in the same place” and refers to the preceding citation. If you see “ibid” plus a page
number, it means “in the same source, but on the page mentioned.” You may also see “id.” or
“idem,” both of which mean “by the same author,” if several works by one author appear in
one citation. Consider this series of footnotes:
3. John Meringue, “Pie-Smashing,” The Comedy of Lunch, edited by Ilene Herring,
quoted in Louis Frappe, Smashing Pumpkins and Other Vegetables (Cambridge: Vegivore
Press, 2007), 77.
4. Ibid.
5. Sally Lemon, “Apple or Pumpkin?” Food Comedy Journal 8 (March 2009): 77–78; id.
“Pecan v. Blueberry,” Food Comedy Journal 3 (March 2004): 4.
In the footnotes above, footnote 3 is an article cited by another author. Footnote 4 (which
uses the Latin abbreviation “ibid”) means that the information comes from the same place as
footnote 3. The citation in footnote 5 (which uses “id”) tells you that Sally Lemon wrote two
articles, “Apple or Pumpkin?” and “Pecan v. Blueberry.” Both were published in Food Comedy
Journal, the first in volume 8 in the March 2009 issue, and the second in volume 3 of the same
journal, which came out in March 2004. The “apple/pumpkin” discussion was on pages 77–78,
and the blueberry reference on page 4.

That Is the Question:
Multiple-Choice and Essay
Strategy and Practice

In this part . . . 
H
amlet, Shakespeare’s most famous character, asked
a lot of questions, but not nearly as many as the AP
test makers. When you sit down to take the real AP English
Language and Composition exam, the only relevant ques-
tion is whether you’ve chosen “to be or not to be” pre-
pared. And of course, because you’re reading this book
I know that your answer is “to be” prepared. 
Preparation for the AP exam has two parts. You should
know what types of questions to expect and the best 
strategy for approaching each. You should also take some
questions out for a spin so that you can perfect your tech-
nique before the big day. In this part I take care of both
tasks: I tell you how to answer the multiple-choice and
essay questions (in Chapters 14 and 16) and provide prac-
tice questions, answers, and explanations (in Chapters 15
and 17).

plan, you cannot just survive but also triumph over whatever they throw at you in the
multiple-choice section of the exam. Consider this chapter your own personal military acad-
emy. Here I discuss time management and tell you when to guess and when to opt out. I also
survey the most common types of multiple-choice questions and explain, step by step, how
to deal with each. 
Gone in 60 Minutes: Multiple-Choice
Section Timing 
The multiple-choice portion of the AP English Language and Composition exam lasts an hour
and usually contains five or six passages, each accompanied by ten questions, give or take
a couple. The passages vary, but most are in the neighborhood of 700 words. Practically
speaking, this format means that you have to zoom through 3,500–4000 words in the pas-
sages alone. The average test-taker ends up with about half a minute per question. As you’ve
probably figured out already, time management is crucial. 
Crucial, but not impossible. If you approach the multiple-choice section with maximum
efficiency, you can accomplish a lot. Several factors matter: an overall strategy for the multiple-
choice section, the method you employ for each passage, and the advisability of guessing.
I cover the first two in this section and guessing in the next section. (Knowing how to answer
each type of multiple-choice question also matters. For that topic, see “Dealing with Types of
Multiple-Choice Questions” later in this chapter.)
Planning your overall strategy
If the multiple-choice portion of your AP English Language and Composition test is typical,
you will see a few standard elements. At least one of the selections will be old (seventeenth
or eighteenth century) with some antiquated vocabulary and syntax more tangled than a

bowl of spaghetti. One will cover something “technical” — a process, a historical event, or
little known fact. The author of one passage will probably be from a group formerly excluded
from the reading list of traditional English classes — women, African Americans, Asian
Americans, or Latinos. Because this exam now quizzes you on citation style, one passage will
have foot- or endnotes, a bibliography, or parenthetical citations. 
These passages and the questions accompanying them present varying degrees of difficulty,
even though they all count the same. So here’s the golden rule: Make sure you answer all the
easy questions and as many of the tough questions as possible. As you begin work on the
multiple-choice section, follow this general plan:
1. Quickly survey the passages and choose the one that looks easiest.
This step should take no more than a minute. It’s based on the fact that no law says
you have to work on the first passage before you hit the second — or the fifth, for that
matter. If a passage looks difficult, skip it and move on to one that’s more user-friendly.
Always check that you’re entering an answer in the appropriate line on the answer
sheet. You don’t want every answer — or any answer! — to end up in the wrong spot,
a horrifying but real possibility if you skip a passage or a question.
2. Keep moving from passage to passage, in ascending order of difficulty. 
As you complete a question-set, move to the next easiest. Keep track of the clock as
you work. Ideally, no question-set should take more than ten minutes. Remember, the
order in which you work is not an issue. Keep moving from passage to passage, leaving
the worst for last.
If you’re a fast reader and are fairly sure that you’ll get to all the passages on the test,
you may be tempted to tackle the hardest passage first, when your brain is freshest.
If that’s your plan, give it a test-drive before the big day. Take one of the full-length
practice exams (in Chapter 18 or 20) with the timer on. Then check your answers
(in Chapter 19 or 21, respectively). If the “hard first, easy later” method works for you,
fine. If not, “easy does it” is your motto.
3. Hit the easy questions first. 
Decide which types of questions are your friends. How do you know? In “Dealing with
Types of Multiple-Choice Questions” in this chapter, I survey the most common ques-
tions. Also, when you practice — you will practice, won’t you? — in Chapter 15, ana-
lyze your responses. Notice patterns. You may, for instance, always ace main idea or
attitude questions but stumble on inference or syntax. Okay, now you know that to
maximize your score you must get to all the main idea and attitude questions, even if
they take a relatively long time to answer. However, no matter what you’ve planned,
if you find yourself spending more than a minute on a single question, move on.
Before AP test day, spend some time on problem areas. If you always have trouble with
tone questions, for example, turn to Chapter 4 for a review. If you can handle technical
passages but have trouble with speeches or letters, check out Chapter 12. 
4. Budget time for the hard questions. 
Once you’ve knocked off the easy questions, consider the number of minutes the hard
ones will cost you. This is an individual decision, of course, one you can make after
you’ve worked through some practice passages and analyzed your working habits.
Most people find that vocabulary-in-context, citation, and factual questions are “super-
fast” because you either know them or you don’t. Either way, you expend very little
time on them. Usually, equivalent, syntax, and inference questions land in the “super-
slow” category. Questions on tone, attitude, purpose, and figurative language fall some-
where in the middle.
158
Part IV: That Is the Question: Multiple-Choice and Essay Strategy and Practice 

Your ability to answer AP questions is as individual as your fingerprints. The only way you
can tell how fast or slow a certain kind of question is for you is to try a bunch and see. Tailor
your approach to your own working style and ability.
Creating a strategy for question-sets
The general plan, which I explain in the preceding section, “Planning your overall strategy,”
helps you maximize your score. So does an efficient approach to each question-set. Follow
these steps:
1. Skim the question stems. 
The stem is the line before the answer choices, the part that tells you what you have to
do. Quickly glance at each stem so that you have a rough idea what they’re asking.
Then when you read the passage, you can look for relevant information. Allot about a
minute for this step.
The AP thoughtfully numbers the lines in the multiple-choice passages, and many
questions direct you to a particular line. (It’s nice not to have to hunt for a word or a sen-
tence they’re asking about.) As you read the stems, put a quick check mark next to any
line that is connected to a question. Then you can pay special attention to that spot later.
2. Read and annotate the passage. 
Annotating means underlining and/or jotting down main ideas or important thoughts
in the margins. In Chapter 3, I illustrate how to annotate a reading passage when you
have no time limit (other than real-life tasks such as homework and vital gossip
you absolutely have to get to). Annotating on the AP is different. It’s quick and dirty,
because you don’t have time to ponder what you’re reading. Do the following:
• Go for anything that relates to the question stems. For example, if you know
they’re asking about the author’s attitude towards the environmental movement,
underline whatever reveals green or anti-green sentiments. Put “E” in the margin
to identify the underlined portion as environment-related. If they’ve queried the
purpose of the last paragraph, keep “purpose” in your mind as you read and write
one or two words in the margin to sum up what you found. 
• Create a “what’s where” guide to the passage by noting the main idea of each
paragraph in the margin. Be brief (one word, maybe two tops). 
159
Chapter 14: Planning Your Attack on Multiple-Choice Questions
Real life to the rescue
The College Board says that everything you need to
answer an AP question (other than the English language
and some pretty sophisticated reading and writing skills)
is right there on the test. And they’re right. But what they
don’t tell you is that sometimes, real-life knowledge gives
you an advantage, especially in the time-limited world of
the multiple-choice section. Suppose you’re a bicycle
enthusiast. You build bikes, race them, and watch every
minute of the Tour de France. As you survey the pas-
sages on the AP test, you notice one on bicycles. Oh, the
joy! Even if technical passages usually slow you down,
this one won’t because you have some background
information. Of course, you have to check that the pas-
sage doesn’t contradict what’s in your head already, but
you should still do this question-set first because you’re
likely to be fast and accurate on this topic.

I can’t recommend a time limit for this step because the length and difficulty of the pas-
sage and individual reading habits vary. However, pay attention to how much time you
spend on each passage when you take the practice test (there’s one in Chapter 18 and
another in 20). Then set your own time limit for reading and annotating.
Abbreviations are great for marginal notes. I use b/c for “because,” s/b for “should be,”
and A for “author.” Work out your own abbreviations; just don’t forget what means what!
3. Go through the questions again, this time reading the answer choices. 
If an answer pops right out at you, bubble it and move on. If you have no idea or can’t
decide between two or three possibilities, put a big X (or Q or Z or whatever) next to
that question and leave it blank on the answer sheet. 
Guess only when the odds favor you. I explain when to guess and when to skip a ques-
tion in “Guessing Games: When to Take a Chance,” a little later in this chapter.
4. Recheck the questions you skipped.
Do this step at the end of a set of questions, before you read another passage. If you
wait too long, you won’t remember enough to work efficiently. Keep an eye on the
minute-hand of your watch. If you’ve spent ten minutes on a question set, leave the
tough questions alone and head for another passage.
Some test takers stray, answering questions on one passage while thinking back to a
previous question-set. This strategy works for the exam about as well as it does for
dating. Don’t play the field! Whatever passage is in front of you is the only one that
exists, as far as you’re concerned, until you’re finished with the question-set that
accompanies it.
5. Repeat Steps 1–4 for the remaining passages. 
Keep on keeping on, as we used to say in the sixties, until you’ve worked your way
through all the passages. Remember, set a limit of ten minutes per passage.
6. After the last passage is done, go back one more time to questions you left blank.
Now you can roam around, if you have any minutes left after the last passage. If not,
don’t worry. You can still get a good AP score if you answer about two-thirds of the
multiple-choice questions correctly, assuming you write reasonably good essays.
If you tend to panic when you’re taking a standardized test, focus your eyes on only one
question at a time. Place the answer sheet on top of the question booklet, just below the
question you’re working on. Put your nonwriting hand just above that question. Now all you
can see is one question, and your eyes won’t hop nervously all over the place. (Of course,
move your hand and answer sheet as needed so that you can refer to the passage.)
160
Part IV: That Is the Question: Multiple-Choice and Essay Strategy and Practice 
Speeding through reading
How fast do you read? Most students I know hover
around the 200-words-per-minute mark. If you can up that
average to 300 wpm and remain at the same comprehen-
sion level, you can save a lot of minutes on the AP exam
(and on your homework!). Turning 200 into 300 is fairly
simple if you see reading as a sport — specifically, track. 
When you’re training for a race, you build strength
through various exercises. You also do wind sprints.
When you’re training for the AP test, you build strength
by increasing your vocabulary and comprehension.
(Chapter 3 tells you how.) Wind sprints, in the world of
reading, are short periods of time when you consciously
force your eyes to move down the page a little faster
than you’re comfortable with. Wind-sprint for about
three minutes at a time. Then stop and try to recall what
you read. At first, the amount of information that sticks
in your head will be small. But each time you’ll retain
more. Whenever you get comfortable at a certain speed,
pick up the pace again. Before you know it, you’ll be a
faster — and better — reader.

Guessing Games: When to Take a Chance
The AP gives you one point for each correct answer. You receive no points for blanks, and
the scorers deduct a quarter point for each wrong answer. Putting on your math hat for a
moment, you can easily determine that random guessing — a blind stab at the five choices —
is a bad idea. You’re likely to choose a wrong answer. Additionally, if you can eliminate only
one of the four choices, you probably shouldn’t waste any time bubbling an answer. You’ll
probably come out the same whether you guess or not, because you have only a one-in-four
chance of choosing the right answer, and a wrong answer costs you 1/4 point. (Trust me on
the math. I’ve worked it out.) If you can eliminate two or more choices, however, go ahead
and guess, because the odds are on your side.
The preceding paragraph covers the general rules of guessing, all other factors being equal.
However, all other factors on the AP exam aren’t equal, because that 60-minute time limit is
always waiting to smack you in the nose. You have to take a few other factors into account,
including these: 
 Your AP exam will probably contain questions in which the five answer-choices are
literary terms. These questions are poor subjects for guesses if you’re feeling time
pressure, especially questions that ask you to find the literary technique (also known
as the “rhetorical technique” or “rhetorical device”) that isn’t present in the passage.
That sort of question gobbles up too many minutes as you comb the passage or sec-
tion to rule out answer choices.
Literary-term questions are easy if you know what the terms mean and can readily
identify the rhetorical techniques they refer to. In this book I’ve placed literary terms
in italics and defined them immediately. Pay attention to those definitions, and you’ll
find that the right answer will pop right out of the crowd.
 “Equivalent” questions that require you to match an answer choice to a line cited in
the question-stem take a lot of time, even for guesses. If you immediately grasp the
meaning of the phrase in the stem, it’s worth your while to attempt to eliminate some
wrong answers and go for a guess. If the line cited in the stem is tough to figure out,
skip the question entirely unless you’ve got minutes in the bank.
 Roman numeral questions give you three statements labeled I, II, and III and ask you
which, if any, are true. Do you understand two of the three statements? If so, put a little
effort into the question. If you grasp the meaning of only one of the statements, leave
the question blank and move on.
One size doesn’t fit all when it comes to specific recommendations about guessing. The
best guessing strategy for you arises from your performance on the practice AP tests in
Chapters 18 and 20 or the practice questions in Chapters 15 and 17. Notice how much time
each type of question requires. The ones that take too many minutes are poor candidates
for the guessing game.
Dealing with Types of Multiple-Choice
Questions
A plan of attack for the whole section and for each question-set goes only so far. You need to
know how to approach each type of multiple-choice question on the AP exam. That’s what
this section provides. 
161
Chapter 14: Planning Your Attack on Multiple-Choice Questions

Vocabulary 
Hemingway was once asked what was hard about writing. His answer — getting the words
right. The test makers want to know that you too can “get the words right,” and they place a
fair number of vocabulary questions on every AP exam. Most are “vocabulary-in-context”
questions that query you about the meaning of a word in the context of a particular line. But
vocabulary is also the key to questions about literary terminology. After all, you can’t deter-
mine whether onomatopoeia is present if you don’t know what the words means. (It’s a word
whose sound reflects its meaning, such as “buzz,” and “murmur.”) 
Attack vocabulary-in-context questions this way:
1. If you’re sent to a line, reread the whole sentence, or, if it’s very long, the grammati-
cal unit containing the word in question.
A vocabulary-in-context question may refer to just a portion of a larger sentence.
Checking the entire sentence, however, gives you more to go on. If it’s an old piece of
writing, the sentence may ramble on for pages. Then you should focus only on the
clause the word appears in. (A clause is a subject-verb statement, plus any descrip-
tions relating to it. For help with grammar, check Chapter 7.)
2. Restate the sentence or clause, substituting a word of your own for the word they’re
asking about.
Be sure that your substitution hasn’t altered the meaning,
3. Match your substitution to the answer choices. 
You should find a match. If you don’t, recheck the sentence. Perhaps you need to
adjust your paraphrase. 
Generally one or two of the wrong answers are real definitions of the word they’re querying —
real, but wrong for the context. Don’t grab an answer because it matches a definition you know.
Look for a word that makes sense in the sentence and matches your word to the answer choices.
Vocabulary-in-context questions are easy to spot:
What is the meaning of ___________ in line ___?
In the context of line ____, what is the best definition of _________?
In line _____, _____________ may be defined as . . . .
Now that you know what they look like, it’s time to try one. Read this passage from Samuel
Pepys’ diary, which he wrote in the seventeenth century. Then try your hand at a vocabu-
lary-in-context question:
17th. It struck me very deep this afternoon going with a hackney coach from Lord
Treasurer’s down Holborne. The coachman I found to drive easily and easily, at last
stood still, and come down hardly able to stand, and told me that he was suddenly
struck very sick, and almost blind, he could not see; so I light and went into another
coach, with a sad heart for the poor man and for myself also, lest he should have
been struck with the plague. 
162
Part IV: That Is the Question: Multiple-Choice and Essay Strategy and Practice 
(01)
(05)

1. In the context of line 4, the best definition of “light” is
(A) featherweight
(B) illuminated
(C) got down
(D) arrived
(E) paid
Correct answer: (C). Following the steps for vocabulary-in-context questions, you can reread
the entire sentence, which begins in line 2, “The coachman I found . . . with the plague.”
Because the sentence is very long, however, you may focus on just the portion the words
appear in — from “so I light” (line 4) to “with the plague” (line 6). Restate it in your own
words: “So I left and went into another coach, upset for the poor man and me too, in case he
had the plague.” Your substitution, which I’ve underlined, is “left.” The answer matching
“left” is (C), “got down,” because Pepys left a coach, and the ground is lower than the passen-
ger compartment.
Real-world knowledge helps you answer this question, because you know that you have to
descend from a carriage when you leave it. (Okay, maybe you’ve never seen a real carriage,
but TV and the movies give you an idea of the height involved.) 
Literary vocabulary questions usually ask you to identify a rhetorical technique (or “device”
or “strategy”) in a particular paragraph or section of the passage. Or, they ask you which
rhetorical technique doesn’t appear. Thoughtfully, the AP-test writers capitalize DOESN’T or
EXCEPT, so you know you’re searching for something that isn’t there. Questions about liter-
ary terms resemble these:
What is the dominant rhetorical device in lines 1–8?
Lines 1 – 8 may be characterized as . . . .
All of the following appear in lines 1–8 EXCEPT . . . .
Line 5 marks a shift from ________ to . . . . (The blank is filled with a literary term, such
as “figurative language” or “imagery” or “narration.”)
Lines 5–8 employ which of the following?
Here’s a sample question, based on an excerpt from the autobiography of a former slave:
I told him that it was certainly wrong to deceive the old man, and that it was his duty
to tell him of the impositions practiced by his young master. I assured him that the old
man would not be slow to comprehend the whole, and that there the matter would end.
William thought it might with the old man, but not with him. He said he did not mind the
smart of the whip, but he did not like the idea of being whipped.
2. Which of the following is the dominant rhetorical device in lines 1–5?
(A) analogy
(B) personification
(C) hyperbole
(D) parallelism
(E) understatement
163
Chapter 14: Planning Your Attack on Multiple-Choice Questions
(01)
(05)

Correct answer: (D). Parallelism is the repetition of the same sentence structure either
within one sentence or in consecutive sentences. This passage contains several “that . . .
subject–verb” sentences. Parallelism is also present in the last two sentences. Read them
aloud and notice the balanced sound, which is characteristic of parallelism. I’ve underlined
the parallel elements: “William thought it might with the old man, but not with him. He said
he did not mind the smart of the whip, but he did not like the idea of being whipped. 
In case you’re interested in the other terms (and you should be), an analogy is a comparison,
personification is the attribution of human qualities to a nonhuman element, hyperbole is
exaggeration, and understatement is the opposite of exaggeration. 
Reading comprehension 
College courses assign heavy-duty reading material, and so does an AP class. And if they
teach it, they test it. Especially in passages written in the nineteenth century or earlier,
expect to see questions that check whether you know what happened (fact questions),
whether you can decode pronouns (antecedent questions), and whether you understand the
underlying meaning of a passage (inference questions). They’re all oodles of fun. 
Fact questions
Who did what to whom, when, why, and how? Or, can you identify the writer’s arguments in
favor of or against a proposal? What does that 29-word sentence in paragraph two mean,
anyway? And is there another sentence in the passage that says the same thing? By now
you’re probably on a fact-finding mission of your own, searching for a way out of the
AP exam. But these questions are fairly easy, if you approach them properly:
1. Reread the lines indicated in the question stem. 
A factual question often, but not always, contains a line reference. The answer, however,
may be elsewhere in the passage. 
2. If no line numbers are specified, check your annotations.
If the question refers to “interest rates,” for example, go to the spot in the passage that
discusses that topic. (Annotations a problem? Turn back to “Creating a strategy for
question-sets” for help.)
3. Restate the question in your own words.
For instance, suppose the question says something like “In lines 1–8, the motive for
changing carriages may best be characterized as . . . .” The paraphrase is “In lines 1–8,
why did he change carriages?” The simpler wording helps you understand what you’re
looking for.
4. If you can, state the answer in your own words and match it to an answer choice.
You may remember enough about the passage to come up with an answer right away.
For example, you may immediately think, “He changed carriages because he was afraid
of getting sick.” Then all you have to do is look for a matching answer-choice.
5. If you can’t come up with a possible answer, test each answer-choice. 
Follow the usual guessing rules: if you can eliminate two or three choices, go for it. If
not, skip the question and return to it later.
I can’t give you a formula for the wording of fact questions because they vary too much,
but you’ll probably recognize this type of question instantly. Just follow the preceding steps
and you’ll be fine.
164
Part IV: That Is the Question: Multiple-Choice and Essay Strategy and Practice 

Take a shot at this factual question, which is based on an excerpt from Paul Volcker: The
Making of a Financial Legend by Joseph Treaster (Wiley, 2004; reprinted with permission from
John Wiley and Sons, Inc.):
For years, inflation had been eroding wealth in America. By 1978, when Miller arrived
at the Fed [the Federal Reserve], inflation was the number one economic problem. As
chairman, Miller argued for gradualism. Like Burns and some other board members,
he worried that by sharply increasing interest rates — the standard medicine for
inflation — the Fed would push the economy into a recession. His approach did not
alleviate the problem, and through most of 1979 the economic picture grew worse,
due in large part to a growing fuel crisis. Because of the revolution that led to the fall of
the Shah of Iran, oil exports to the United States from Iran had slowed. A fuel shortage
developed in the United States, resulting in long lines at gas stations that sometimes
erupted into violence. By midyear, the cost of gas and oil shipments to the United States
from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had jumped 60 percent.
Increased fuel costs were slowing the economy and many economists, including those
at Miller’s Fed, were expecting a recession. Unemployment and inflation were rising.
By June 1979, inflation was running at an annual rate of 13 percent. At the same time,
the value of the dollar had been declining against other major currencies.
3. Which of the following statements about the United States economy in 1979 is true, accord-
ing to lines 9–15?
(A) The rate of inflation was increasing.
(B) Motorists resorted to violence because of fuel shortages.
(C) A recession had developed.
(D) The dollar was weaker in relation to other currencies.
(E) Inflation caused higher interest rates.
Correct answer: (D). Line 15 states that “the value of the dollar had been declining against
other major currencies.” Thus (D) is true. The other statements aren’t supported in lines
12–15, which tells you that “inflation [was] rising” (line 13) but says nothing about the “rate
of inflation” cited in (A). Choice (B) is true, but it isn’t a statement about the economy; it’s a
statement about behavior. The passage tells you that many economists were “expecting a
recession” (lines 13–14), not that one had already developed, as indicated in (C). Choice (E)
is backwards: Higher interest rates are the cure for, not the cause of, inflation.
A particularly devilish type of fact question asks for equivalents. The question stem directs
you to a statement in the passage, and you have to find another statement that matches it.
Here’s an example, based on a passage excerpted from a speech given by Oscar Wilde:
In the lecture which it is my privilege to deliver before you tonight, I do not desire to
give you any abstract definition of beauty at all. For we who are working in art cannot
accept any theory of beauty in exchange for beauty itself, and, so far from desiring to
isolate it in a formula appealing to the intellect, we, on the contrary, seek to materialize
it in a form that gives joy to the soul through the senses. We want to create it, not to
define it. The definition should follow the work: the work should not adapt itself to the
definition. Nothing, indeed, is more dangerous to the young artist than any conception
of ideal beauty: he is constantly led by it either into weak prettiness or lifeless abstrac-
tion: whereas to touch the ideal at all you must not strip it of vitality. You must find it in
life and re-create it in art.

4. Which of the following statements is equivalent to “we . . . cannot accept any theory of
beauty in exchange for beauty itself” (lines 2–3)?
(A) “I do not desire to give you any abstract definition of beauty at all” (lines 1–2)
(B) “desiring to isolate it in a formula appealing to the intellect” (lines 3–4)
(C) “a form that gives joy to the soul through the senses” (line 5)
(D) “We want to create it, not to define it” (lines 5–6)
(E) “The definition should follow the work” (line 6)
Correct answer: (D). The original statement can be paraphrased as “we can’t take the
ideas people have about art instead of art (or beauty) itself.” Choice (D) matches perfectly,
because when you “define” something, you talk about it, and talking expresses ideas. The
art (or beauty) is a creation. 
To answer an equivalent question, follow the same procedure as for any factual question. But
beware of these beauties; they eat up minutes faster than that green apparition in Ghostbusters
eats hot dogs. If you don’t get the answer quickly, skip the question and move on.
A new fact question that accounts for approximately three of the multiple-choice questions
on every AP exam concerns source citations. For more information about citations, see
Chapter 13. But relax. They don’t ask you to create a citation, just to recognize elements of
citations they show you, so you can demonstrate that you know the difference between a
book and an article or which number refers to the page and which to a volume. They may
also query the overall purpose or effect of the citations. 
Here’s an example, based on these endnotes from Joseph Treaster’s book entitled Paul
Volcker: The Making of a Financial Legend (Wiley, 2004; reprinted with permission of John
Wiley and Sons, Inc.):
28. Paul A. Volcker Jr. interview, 2003.
29. Paul Volcker and Toyoo Gyohten, Changing Fortunes (New York: Times Books, 1992),
p. 164.
30. Paul A. Volcker Jr. interview, 2003.
5. Which of the following statements is true, according to the citations for this passage?
(A) Much of information comes from an interview conducted by Paul A. Volcker Jr.
(B) Paul Volcker and Toyoo Gyohten wrote an article entitled Changing Fortunes.
(C) Volcker and Gyohten’s article was published in The New York Times.
(D) The article that Volcker and Gyohten wrote is on page 164 of a book entitled Changing
Fortunes.
(E) The author relied on primary source material.
Correct answer: (E). Changing Fortunes is a book, not an article, because it’s italicized.
(Article titles are enclosed in quotation marks.) Endnotes 28 and 30 refer to an interview
with Mr. Volcker, not by him. These two facts rule out answers (A) through (D). You know
that (E) is right not only because it’s the only remaining choice but also because the book
is about Paul Volcker and an interview with him, as well as something he co-wrote, is cited.
Primary sources come from the subject being studied.

Antecedents
Pronouns are handy little guys. They take the place of nouns (and occasionally of other
pronouns) and help you avoid saying things like “Henry went to Henry’s car and drove
to Henry’s house.” The antecedent of a pronoun is the word the pronoun replaces. In the
tangled world of AP reading comprehension, uncovering the antecedent (usually of “that,”
“which,” or “it”) is a favorite task. This method helps:
1. Locate the pronoun they’re questioning. 
Ever helpful, the test makers tell you which line the pronoun appears in.
2. Reread the sentence the pronoun appears in and take a quick peek at the sentences
surrounding the pronoun. 
Antecedents don’t always reside in the same sentence as their pronouns. Don’t forget
that an antecedent sometimes follows the pronoun it replaces.
3. Restate the sentence the pronoun appears in, substituting a noun for the pronoun
they’re asking about.
Be sure you haven’t altered the meaning.
4. Find an answer choice that matches your substitution. 
The answer given may vary a bit in wording (sometimes modifiers are included), but it
should be there. 
The wording of an antecedent question is straightforward: They ask, “What is the antecedent
of ______________? or leave an unfinished statement, as in the following example.
Read this passage from The Knight by Alan Baker (Wiley, 2003; reprinted with permission
from John Wiley and Sons, Inc.): 
It is easy to see that feudalism was, at its center, defined by the localization of political,
military, and economic power in the hands of lords and their vassals, who exercised
that power from their castle headquarters, each of which held complete sway over the
district in which it was situated. The resulting hierarchy resembled a pyramid, with
the lowest vassals at the base and the king, of course, at the summit. This was not the
case in every nation, however; in Germany, for instance, the summit of the pyramid did
not reach the king, being occupied instead by the great princes.
6. The antecedent of “This” (line 5) is
(A) pyramid (line 4 or 6)
(B) hierarchy (line 4)
(C) feudalism (line 1)
(D) king (line 5)
(E) princes (line 7)
Correct answer: (A). What wasn’t the case in every nation? The fact that the power structure
resembled a pyramid. Hence “pyramid” is the closest answer, and (A) is what you want.
Inference
An inference question pushes you into the blank spaces “between the lines.” The answer is
implied by various clues in the passage but not directly stated. When you encounter an infer-
ence question, try this approach:

1. Restate the question in your own words.
Now you know what they’re looking for.
2. Go back to the line numbers they specify or check your annotations for the topic
they’re asking about. 
Now you know where to look for evidence.
3. Think about the information they give you and stretch it to the next logical level.
In the excerpt from The Knight in the preceding section, the author tells you that in
Germany “the summit of the pyramid did not reach the king, being occupied instead by
the great princes.” The logical conclusion is that the princes had the same powers as
kings did in other countries.
4. Match your conclusion to the answer choices. 
If you don’t find a match, recheck the passage to see which choice makes sense in light
of the evidence there.
The wording of inference questions varies greatly. You may see these patterns:
Lines ___ to ___ imply that . . . .
The ________ in paragraph two suggests that . . . .
_______ probably _________ because . . . .
From _______, you can infer that . . . .
Test-drive this inference question, based on another excerpt from The Knight.
The results of feudalism were mixed, to say the least. On the negative side, it meant that
the state had a relationship with the heads of groups rather than directly with individu-
als farther down the social scale. Under a weak king, these men claimed sovereignty for
themselves, and fought among themselves rather than allowing the state to judge their
claims. This resulted in the private wars that scarred the medieval landscape. The over-
lords claimed numerous rights for themselves, including that of issuing private coinage,
building private castles, and the power to raise taxes. Each of these manorial groups
tried to be self-sufficient and to consolidate its possessions. 
7. According to the passage, what is the advantage of a powerful king?
(A) He has a direct relationship with members of the lower social classes.
(B) He helps keep the peace.
(C) He takes sides in the wars between nobles.
(D) He allows private coinage.
(E) He sets low tax rates.
Correct answer: (B). The passage tells you about the disadvantages of a “weak king” (line 3).
To answer this question, therefore, all you have to do is flip the information provided. A power-
ful king does what a weak one can’t. Because a weak king allows nobles to claim “sovereignty
for themselves” (lines 3–4) and fight, a strong king keeps sovereignty for himself and keeps the
peace.

One type of inference question asks for the main idea of the passage or a portion. To answer
a main-idea question, create a title with a good, glovelike fit. You don’t want floppy cloth in
the finger area (too big) or bare palms (too small). Match your title to one of the answer
choices, and you’re home free.
Theme, attitude, and purpose
These three types of questions force you to take a step back and look at the Big Picture —
the passage as a whole. A theme is an important idea considered in a literary work. By now in
your academic life, you’ve probably discussed the themes of appearance and reality, loyalty,
betrayal, love, and about a million others. A theme isn’t a topic. For example, suppose you
read a piece about soup kitchens in the Depression. “Soup kitchens in the Depression” is the
topic. Themes of the piece may be generosity, greed, or poverty as ennobling (or debilitat-
ing). Attitude questions ask you to characterize the viewpoint or emotions of the author or of
someone appearing in the selection. Purpose questions ask you to figure out why the author
wrote the piece. (Hint: With the AP exam as opposed to real life, the answer is never “for the
money.”)
To deal with a question about theme, step back from the piece and conjure up a kindly
teacher (I’ll take that role!). What’s the teacher talking about? What sort of discussion can
you imagine about the selection? The answers point you towards the theme. Look back for
a moment at the excerpt from Oscar Wilde’s lecture on art. Can’t you imagine the teacher
throwing out these questions: What is beauty? Must art be beautiful? Bingo, you have your
themes: beauty, art, and the relationship between the two.
To determine attitude or purpose is a little harder. You have to examine the words used
(diction, in English-teacher terms), opinions expressed, and what’s left unsaid. Take these
steps when you run up against an attitude question:
1. If a character or person in the piece is the focus, review what he or she says and does.
Also check how others interact with the character or person the question queries you
about.
2. If the question concerns the author’s attitude or purpose, reread your annotations.
Your notes will remind you of the content of the piece. What does that content tell you?
If you find five reasons why carbon-based fuels are harming the world, the author’s atti-
tude is probably “pro-environment” or “critical” of the major car companies. The pur-
pose may be to rally people to the author’s cause or to inform the reader of the perils
of a large carbon-footprint.
3. Imagine yourself talking with the character, person, or author.
What would that person say? In your mind, conjure up a little speech. Listen to it! The
way it sounds is a clue to attitude; the response you have to the speech is a clue to its
purpose.
4. Check the answer choices and see which one fits the speech. 
This step may be easier if you imagine yourself reporting the speech for the school
paper. What would the headline be? “Cut SUV Production” or “SUVs Are Cool”? Now
you know whether the author’s attitude is anti- or pro-SUV and whether the purpose
is to urge that production of large vehicles be curtailed or promoted.
169
Chapter 14: Planning Your Attack on Multiple-Choice Questions

The answer choices for attitude questions may be single words or pairs of words. If you’re
faced with a pair, be sure both words fit.
Questions about theme, attitude, and purpose are generally written in a straightforward way,
such as these:
The speaker’s attitude is . . . .
The purpose of paragraph two is to . . . . 
Which of the following would the author favor (or oppose)?
How’s your attitude? I hope it’s positive toward this sample question. This one’s based on
the excerpt from The Knight that appears in the inference discussion in the earlier section
“Reading comprehension”:
8. The author’s attitude toward feudalism may best be described as
(A) critical
(B) admiring
(C) detached
(D) reflective
(E) philosophical
Correct answer: (A). The first sentence of the excerpt tells you that “the results of feudalism
were mixed, to say the least” (line 1). Right away you know that the author’s not a complete
fan of feudalism, and you can rule out (B) and (C). Nor is the author pondering the meaning
of feudalism or attempting to place it in a larger context, so (D) and (E) don’t work.
The preceding example doesn’t ask you about purpose, but if it did, the answer would proba-
bly be “to inform the reader about feudalism” or “to criticize the feudal system” or something
similar.
Style questions
Style questions concern writing, not content. In general, the AP asks you questions about
how a piece is written and why the author wrote this way. Elements of style queried on the
AP include diction (word choice), syntax (how the words fit together grammatically), structure
(the organizing principle of the passage), and rhetorical modes (the basic types of writing:
narration, description, exposition, and argument). The AP-exam writers also love to query
you about shifts (when something changes in the writing, such as point of view). If I’ve just
given you a migraine, turn to Part II for a review of all these concepts.
In quality literature (the type used on the AP exam and given as assignments in AP courses),
style and content work together. Expect to find questions on style that overlap with content,
and vice versa. 
To answer a style question, the best approach is to imagine an alternate universe. Here’s
what to do:
1. Examine the lines they’re asking about. 
If they want to know about the structure of paragraph two, reread paragraph two.
2. Consider the element of style they’ve mentioned. 
If they don’t name an element of style in the question stem, glance at the answer
choices to see what’s in the running.
170
Part IV: That Is the Question: Multiple-Choice and Essay Strategy and Practice 

3. Read the answer choices.
Does anything strike you immediately? If not, check the most likely answers.
4. If you’re stuck, imagine a change in those lines. 
If the paragraph were left out, what would be different in the passage? If you altered it
(say, from narration to description), how would the passage be affected? What would
happen if you moved those lines to a different spot? The answer is likely to show you
what those lines do — in AP terms, how those lines function — or to a glimpse of the
overall structure of the piece.
5. Match your answer to one of the choices. 
If nothing fits, go back to Step 3 and try still another alteration. If that doesn’t work,
move on.
Questions about style appear in many forms, including these:
Paragraph two marks a shift from ________ to ________.
The narrator’s attitude is reveal primarily by _________.
The dominant rhetorical device (or rhetorical technique) in paragraph two is ___.
The argument in favor of _____ is presented primarily by which rhetorical device?
The function of _____________ is to ____________.
Answer the following question to see how “stylish” you are. It’s based on an excerpt from
Samuel Pepys’ diary.
After dinner, and doing some business at the office, I to White Hall, where the Court is full
of the Duke and his courtiers returned from sea. All fat and lusty, and ruddy by being in
the sun. I kissed his hands, and we waited all the afternoon. By and by saw Mr. Coventry,
which rejoiced my very heart. Anon he and I, from all the rest of the company, walked into
the Matted Gallery; where after many expressions of love, we fell to talk of business.
Among other things, how my Lord Sandwich, both in his councils and personal service,
hath done most honourably and serviceably. 
9. The diction in paragraph one (lines 1–7) serves to
(A) present a favorable view of the aristocracy
(B) criticize the aristocracy
(C) reveal the narrator’s lack of confidence
(D) emphasize the duties of the aristocracy
(E) show the narrator’s sense of detachment
Correct answer: (A). The Duke and his courtiers are “fat and lusty” (line 2), not a bad thing in
the olden days, when people starved to death. The narrator “kissed his hands” (line 3) after he
“waited all the afternoon” (line 3) and talked with his friend about how Lord Sandwich “hath
done most honorably and serviceably” (line 7). Okay, alternate universe time. Suppose the
returnees were “thin and weak” and the narrator “ignored his arrival” or said that Lord
Sandwich performed “dishonorably and ineffectually.” See the change? Clearly, a favorable
view is what the author presents.
Shifts are a big deal in style questions. The AP-exam makers love to point you at a specific
spot in the passage and ask you to determine what changes there — the point of view, the
technique (narration to description, perhaps), and so forth. To answer a shift question,
check what comes before and after the designated spot.

efore you start working through this chapter, grab a pencil and get ready to sharpen
it — along with your wits. Here is where you put to work all the strategy you acquired
in Chapter 14. (If you skipped Chapter 14, I recommend you go back and at least skim the
pages. A good approach to the multiple-choice section is half the battle.) The multiple-
choice questions count for 45 percent of your final AP grade, and they deserve your atten-
tion. After each question in this chapter, I tell you the right answer, and, more importantly,
why it’s right and other choices are wrong. 
A note about timing: Because in this chapter the answers and explanations mingle with the
questions, you aren’t practicing true AP-exam timing in this chapter. (You can do so when
you take the practice tests in Chapter 18 and 20.) Don’t worry about the clock. This chapter
is about becoming familiar with AP-style questions, not racing through a passage.
Practice Passage One: Francis Bacon
Your first practice run is an essay by Francis Bacon entitled “Of Innovations.” Bacon is much-
loved by standardized-test makers because he’s a master of the art of the essay, and his work
is dense. It’s easy to write questions about a Bacon essay because the author packed so
much into each line. He’s a difficult writer, but with a little bit of effort, you can bring home
the bacon . . . er, Bacon. 
As the births of living creatures, at first are ill-shapen, so are all innovations, which are
the births of time. Yet notwithstanding, as those that first bring honor into their family,
are commonly more worthy than most that succeed, so the first precedent (if it be
good) is seldom attained by imitation. For ill, to man’s nature, as it stands perverted,
hath a natural motion, strongest in continuance; but good, as a forced motion, strongest
at first. Surely every medicine is an innovation; and he that will not apply new remedies,
must expect new evils; for time is the greatest innovator; and if time of course alter
things to the worse, and wisdom and counsel shall not alter them to the better, what
shall be the end? It is true, that what is settled by custom, though it be not good, yet at
least it is fit; and those things which have long gone together, are, as it were, confederate
within themselves; whereas new things piece not so well; but though they help by their
utility, yet they trouble by their inconformity. Besides, they are like strangers; more
admired, and less favored. All this is true, if time stood still; which contrariwise moveth
so round, that a forward retention of custom, is as turbulent a thing as an innovation;
and they that reverence too much old times, are but a scorn to the new. It were good,
therefore, that men in their innovations would follow the example of time itself; which
indeed innovateth greatly, but quietly, by degrees scarce to be perceived. For otherwise,
(01)
(05)
(10)
(15)
(20)

whatsoever is new is unlooked for; and ever it mends some, and pairs others; and he
that is holpen1, takes it for a fortune, and thanks the time; and he that is hurt, for a
wrong, and imputeth it to the author. It is good also, not to try experiments in states,
except the necessity be urgent, or the utility evident; and well to beware, that it be the
reformation, that draweth on the change, and not the desire of change, that pretendeth
the reformation. And lastly, that the novelty, though it be not rejected, yet be held for a
suspect; and, as the Scripture saith, that we make a stand upon the ancient way, and
then look about us, and discover what is the straight and right way, and so to walk in it.
1. helped
1. Which of the following is equivalent to that statement that “all innovations . . . are the births
of time” (lines 1–2)?
(A) “the first precedent . . . is seldom attained by innovation” (lines 3–4)
(B) “Surely every medicine is an innovation” (line 6)
(C) “All this is true, if time stood still” (line 15)
(D) “men in their innovations would follow the example of time itself; which indeed inno-
vateth greatly” (lines 19–20)
(E) “whatsoever is new is unlooked for” (line 21)
Correct answer: (D). This question, like all equivalent questions, relies on your reading com-
prehension skills. Sadly, decoding anything written by Francis Bacon isn’t easy. The passage
in the question refers to “innovations” (line 1) as “the births of time” (line 2). Simply put,
Bacon is saying that time is pregnant; wait long enough, and something new will arrive.
Choice (D) says the same thing: “time itself . . . innovateth greatly.” In other words, time cre-
ates (gives birth to) innovations, and (D) is the answer you seek.
2. The function of “Yet” (line 2) is to
(A) qualify the point made in the first sentence (lines 1–2)
(B) support the point made in the first sentence (lines 1–2)
(C) contradict the point made in the first sentence (lines 1–2)
(D) explain what hasn’t come true
(E) introduce the point made in the third sentence (lines 4–6)
Correct answer: (A). To qualify is to set conditions, as in “yes, you can have the car keys, but
you have to be home by midnight or you’re grounded until your 45th birthday.” Bacon begins
by saying that innovations aren’t perfect when they appear, just as living creatures are “ill-
shapen” at birth. The second sentence in this essay (lines 2–4) declares that you’re not likely
to come up with something worthwhile “by imitation” (line 4). He also says that “those that
first bring honor into their family, are commonly worth more than those that succeed” (lines 
2–3). In this context, to “succeed” is to “come later.” Bacon isn’t supporting or contradicting
the “ill-shapen” nature of innovations — ruling out (B) and (C). Choice (E) isn’t even close
because the next sentence hops to a new concept; (E) isn’t introducing anything. Instead,
“Yet” tweaks or qualifies the main idea of sentence one, as (A) — the correct answer — says. 
Choice (D) may have tempted you because “yet” is often associated with deadlines, as in
“you haven’t done your homework yet.” Resist temptation! The AP-exam writers love to trick
you by throwing in an easy vocabulary word used in an unusual way.

(25)

3. According to lines 2–6, which statements about good and ill are true?
I. Good is seldom attained by imitation.
II. Ill actions have a tendency to continue.
III. Good actions are stronger at the beginning.
(A) I only
(B) II only
(C) III only
(D) none of the above
(E) all of the above
Correct answer: (E). Bacon believes that precedent (another word for “innovation”) “is seldom
attained by imitation” (line 4) if the precedent “be good” (lines 3–4). Place statement I in the
winner’s column. Bacon also writes that “ill” (line 4) is “strongest in continuance” (line 5).
In other words, bad stuff keeps going. Bingo: II passes the test. Finally, he writes that good is
“strongest at first” (lines 5–6). Statement III is true and thus makes (E) the answer you seek.
4. Which of the following elements are NOT present in this passage?
(A) rhetorical question
(B) antithesis
(C) personification
(D) paradox
(E) allusion
Correct answer: (D). A paradox is an unsolvable puzzle, one of those important-sounding
statements that make you scratch your head and wrinkle your eyebrows, such as “the more
things change, the more they remain the same.” This passage has no paradoxes, so (D) is the
best answer. Just to review the other choices: Bacon asks a rhetorical question (A) in lines
8–10. You’re not supposed to answer the question; it’s a statement in disguise. (B), antithesis,
is the dominant device in this passage. Bacon yo-yos between extremes, talking about good
and ill (lines 3–6) and people who are “holpen” (line 22) or helped and those who are hurt
(line 22). Time is personified — given human traits — in line 2 when it gives birth, so (C) isn’t
appropriate. You can find an allusion (E) in line 27, when Bacon refers to scripture. (An allu-
sion is a reference to something that’s commonly known, such as a book or an event.
5. In the context of lines 10–11, what is the meaning of “fit”?
(A) physically able
(B) mentally able
(C) appropriate
(D) matching
(E) blend in
Correct answer: (E). Here’s another vocab-in-context question. They show up more often in
old (pre-nineteenth-century) passages because the meaning of a word tends to evolve over
time, and the test writers are checking your ability to ferret out a definition that is seldom
employed in modern works. As usual, a couple of the answer choices are definitions of the
selected word, but only one is the definition in context. In lines 12–15, Bacon describes the dis-
comfort that new ideas bring. Innovations don’t “fit” at first. Old customs, on the other hand,
“fit” even when they’re bad customs. Substitute “blend in” for “fit” in the last two sentences
and you’ll see that (E) is correct.
175
Chapter 15: Practice Multiple-Choice Questions

6. The antecedent of “they” in “they are like strangers” (line 14) is
(A) “custom” (line 10)
(B) “things which have long gone together” (line 11)
(C) “confederate” (line 11)
(D) “new things” (line 13)
(E) “utility” (line 14)
Correct answer: (D). To find the antecedent, chop the pronoun “they” out of the sentence.
Ask yourself, “Who are like strangers?” Only one answer maintains the original meaning of
the sentence, (D) — new things.
7. The statement “All this is true, if time stood still” (line 15) has the effect of 
(A) negating every point made previously
(B) validating all previous points
(C) reversing the meaning of lines 13–15 (“new things piece not so well . . . less favored”) 
(D) supporting the meaning of lines 13–15 (“new things piece not so well . . . less favored”)
(E) introducing the concept of gradual change
Correct answer: (D). Because time doesn’t stand still — as my wrinkles testify — the line
cited in the question really means “None of this is true.” Fine. Now all you’ve got to do is
figure out what “none of this” is. (A) and (B) stretch all the way to the beginning of the pas-
sage. Too far, because Bacon has made several points, and only one is tackled by the ques-
tion. The smaller section (lines 13–15) mentioned in choices (C) or (D) is better. How do you
know? Just look at what follows “All this is true, if time stood still” (line 15). There you read
that it’s just as hard to keep a custom going past its expiration date as it is to change —
“forward retention of custom, is as turbulent a thing as an innovation” (line 16). This state-
ment supports innovation, making choice (D) the best answer. (E) doesn’t work because the
concept of gradual change comes later, in lines 19–20 (“follow the example of time itself,
which indeed innovateth greatly, but quietly”).
8. Which statement best reflects the author’s attitude toward innovation?
(A) Innovation should always be welcomed.
(B) Innovation disrupts society.
(C) Innovations are best when they effect total change.
(D) The best innovations are gradual and necessary.
(E) The desire for change is the best motive for innovation.
Correct answer: (D). Bacon’s writing style is so tight that each sentence could serve as the
topic sentence of another essay. His strongest statement about innovation is a perfect match
for (D): “It were good, therefore, that men in their innovations would follow the example of
time itself; which innovateth greatly, but quietly, by degrees” (lines 18–20). Did I catch 
you with (B)? Bacon acknowledges the discomfort accompanying innovation (“new things
piece not so well” — line 12), but he also explains that the lack of change is as difficult as
innovation (“a forward retention of custom, is as turbulent a thing as an innovation” — line
16). Therefore, (D) is the better answer.

Practice Passage Two: A Letter to Punch
Punch, a British humor magazine, went out of business at the end of the twentieth century,
but it lasted more than a hundred years — long enough to accumulate a fair amount of corre-
spondence. Take a look at this letter to Punch, proposing a streamlined novel. (You can only
wonder what the writer, now probably long dead, would think of books-on-tape.) Then take
a crack at the questions following the letter.
DEAR PUNCH,
I was much amused the other day, on taking my seat in the Birmingham Railway train, to
observe a sentimental-looking young gentleman, who was sitting opposite to me, delib-
erately draw from his travelling-bag three volumes of what appeared to me a new novel
of the full regulation size, and with intense interest commence the first volume at the
title-page. At the same instant the last bell rang, and away started our train, whizz, bang,
like a flash of lightning through a butter-firkin.1 I endeavoured to catch a glimpse of some
familiar places as we passed, but the attempt was altogether useless. Harrow-on-the-Hill,
as we shot by it, seemed to be driving pell-mell2 up to town, followed by Boxmoor, Tring,
and Aylesbury — I missed Wolverton and Weedon while taking a pinch of snuff — lost
Rugby and Coventry before I had done sneezing, and I had scarcely time to say, “God
bless us,” till I found we had reached Birmingham. Whereupon I began to calculate the
trifling progress my reading companion could have made in his book during our rapid
journey, and to devise plans for the gratification of persons similarly situated as my
fellow-traveller. “Why,” thought I, “should literature alone lag in the age of steam? Is
there no way by which a man could be made to swallow Scott3 or bolt Bulwer,4 in as
short a time as it now takes him to read an auction bill?” Suddenly a happy thought
struck me: it was to write a novel, in which only the actual spirit of the narration should
be retained, rejecting all expletives, flourishes, and ornamental figures of speech; to be
terse and abrupt in style — use monosyllables always in preference to polysyllables —
and to eschew all heroes and heroines whose names contain more than four letters. Full
of this idea, on my returning home in the evening, I sat to my desk, and before I retired
to rest, had written a novel of three neat, portable volumes; which, I assert, any lady
or gentlemen, who has had the advantage of a liberal education, may get through with
tolerable ease, in the time occupied by the railroad train running from London to
Birmingham.
I will not dilate on the many advantages which this description of writing possesses
over all others. Lamplighters, commercial bagmen, omnibus-cads, tavern-waiters, and
general postmen, may “read as they run.” Fiddlers at the theatres, during the rests in a
piece of music, may also benefit by my invention; for which, if the following specimen
meet your approbation, I shall instantly apply for a patent.
1. A small, covered, wooden container. 
2. At full speed. 
3–4. 19th century novelists. 
9. The “young gentleman” (line 2) is described as “sentimental-looking” probably in order to
(A) explain why he is reading a novel
(B) give an idea of his appearance
(C) create a contrast between him and the letter writer
(D) explain the content of his reading
(E) associate novel reading with the past

Correct answer: (E). On New Year’s Eve, do you get “sentimental” while singing “Auld Lang
Syne”? Most people do, because they’re looking backward, at the past. The “sentimental-
looking young gentleman” is engaged in a slow-paced, old-fashioned activity (reading a
novel), which contrasts with the speed of the modern train. (A steam train! How fast could it
be? On the other hand, Amtrak is late a lot, so maybe the Punch writer’s steam train was
faster.) The entire letter, in fact, ironically places the time-consuming task of reading a novel
in juxtaposition to the rapid movement of the train. The train is the future, and novel reading
is the past. Hence (E) is the best answer here.
10. The novel’s description as “full regulation size” (line 5) is an example of
(A) hyperbole
(B) understatement
(C) personification
(D) irony
(E) oxymoron
Correct answer: (D). When you’re bogged down with homework, it’s easy to imagine that
English teachers have a rule: Every novel you read has to be long. Really, really long! Of
course, novels don’t follow rules, and the Author’s Guild hasn’t decreed a “full regulation
size” for anything. So this description isn’t true. Throughout the passage the letter-writer
says the opposite of what he means. Instead of hoping that novel-reading will speed up, he’s
hoping that the pace of modern life will slow down. Saying the opposite of what you mean
falls under the literary category of irony, making (D) your answer. The other terms don’t fit:
hyperbole is exaggeration and understatement the opposite of exaggeration. Personification
gives human traits to nonhuman elements, and an oxymoron is a self-contradicting term
(think “jumbo shrimp”).
11. The comparison between the train’s speed and “a flash of lightning through a butter-firkin”
(line 7) 
(A) emphasizes the difference between the past and present
(B) shows the author’s approval of fast-paced activities, as represented by the train
(C) portrays progress as a natural act
(D) focuses on the destructiveness of a rapid train
(E) praises the speed of the train
Correct answer: (A). I doubt you’ve bought any butter-firkins at the supermarket. Those
wooden tubs were probably more common when this passage was written in the late nine-
teenth century. Common or not, a wooden container implies that the butter was made the
old-fashioned way, by churning it. The train is portrayed as modern, so (A) is the best
answer here. The other choices don’t fit very well. Choices (B) and (E) bomb because the
author isn’t a fan of speed, and (D) is out because the train isn’t portrayed as destroying any-
thing. Choice (C) may have made you flashback to poetry class, when the teacher probably
rambled on about “nature as represented by lightning” in this simile (a direct comparison, in
lit-speak). Nevertheless, (C) is too much of a stretch.
12. The author’s attempt to gain a “glimpse of some familiar places as we passed” (lines 7–8)
and the list of towns 
(A) give a sense of the train’s speed
(B) show what has been sacrificed in the interests of speed
(C) focus on the author’s memories
(D) orient the reader to the geography of England
(E) create an air of unreality
178
Part IV: That Is the Question: Multiple-Choice and Essay Strategy and Practice 

Correct answer: (B). The familiar places pass so quickly that the author can’t even see them;
they’re lost because of the train’s rapid movement. No doubt about it; choice (B) is best.
Choice (A) isn’t the answer you seek because the author’s exaggeration makes it impossible
to tell how fast the train is actually going. Choice (C) is too extreme; the author may have
memories, but they don’t appear in this letter. Nor does he care about geography or deal in
“unreality,” represented by (D) and (E).
13. The author’s statement, “I missed Wolverton and Weedon while taking a pinch of snuff”
(line 10), is an example of
(A) hyperbole
(B) symbolism
(C) paradox
(D) metaphor
(E) apostrophe
Correct answer: (A). A pinch of snuff lasts a very short time, even less than the sneezing that
follows sticking something up your nose. (That’s what you do with snuff.) It’s impossible to
pass two towns so quickly, so the statement is an exaggeration, also known as hyperbole,
choice (A). Symbolism — choice (B) — appears when something acquires added meaning —
not the case here. Nor has the author presented a self-contradicting situation, or paradox —
choice (C). Choices (D) and (E) aren’t what you want; a metaphor is an indirect comparison
and apostrophe, in the nonpunctuation sense, is a comment addressed to a person or idea
that doesn’t appear in the passage.
14. Which of the following is true of the author’s statement that he could “use monosyllables
always in preference to polysyllables” (line 20)?
(A) It suggests a better method for writing novels.
(B) It contradicts his style in this passage.
(C) It is one of many criticisms of traditional novels.
(D) It is merely a guideline, not a hard-and-fast rule, for writers.
(E) It is easily achievable.
Correct answer: (B). A quick glance at the passage reveals that the author hasn’t “eschew[ed]”
(line 21) or rejected polysyllabic words. In fact, he’s strewn long words all over the place! In
this case, (B) is for “best answer.” Choices (A) and (C) assume that the author is serious, but
he’s actually joking about his streamlined novel, which, by the way, I’d like to read. Choices (D)
and (E) aren’t relevant.
15. The letter achieves its comic effect primarily through
(A) the author’s personality
(B) narration
(C) examples and anecdotes
(D) description
(E) exaggeration
Correct answer: (E). The whole passage is way over the top. He takes snuff and loses two
towns, sneezes and loses two more, and writes a novel before bedtime. If you believe him,
I have a bridge to sell you. It goes to Brooklyn, and the price is reduced. Back to the AP: the
author’s personality, the narration, the examples, and the description all have one thing in
common, and that’s exaggeration — choice (E).

16. In the context of this passage, the “[l]amplighters, commercial bagmen, omnibus-cads,
tavern-waiters, and general postmen” (lines 28–29) are mentioned because
(A) they form the potential market for a short novel
(B) they display the diversity of British society
(C) they represent passengers on the train
(D) they do not like novels
(E) they all work long hours
Correct answer: (A). Every novel needs readers, and these professions have one thing in
common. All these workers may “read as they run” (line 29). Hence they have little time and
are the potential market for a tiny book, an idea expressed by choice (A).
17. The tone of this passage is best described as
(A) fanciful
(B) serious 
(C) didactic 
(D) speculative
(E) critical
Correct answer: (A). When you imagine this author speaking these words, what do you hear?
Most of what he says he doesn’t mean, so (A) is best. Choices (B), (C), and (D) are way off.
(“Didactic,” by the way, is the tone a truly boring teacher takes while lecturing.) (E) is possi-
ble, because the author is no fan of modern speed, but (A) captures the author’s humor.
If your English class is typical, you read a lot of heavy material dealing with death, dishonor,
war, and similar subjects. Therefore you may be at a disadvantage when facing a comic selec-
tion. Ready yourself for the AP by tickling your funny bone. Watch some silly shows on televi-
sion and read some comic classics. Keep an eye out for satire, a type of writing that mocks
society. (The letter to Punch falls into that category.) Notice how the comic effects are
achieved. Then if you encounter comedy on the exam, you’ll get full marks — and that’s no
laughing matter!
Practice Passage Three: Richard Henry Dana
Richard Henry Dana signed on as a sailor on the brig Pilgrim after enduring a bout of measles
while a junior at Harvard College. He hoped to improve his eyesight, which had been dam-
aged during the course of his illness. (The common wisdom of the day was that sea air is
good for the eyes.) Dana’s account of his voyage was published in 1840.
Death is at all times solemn, but never so much so as at sea. A man dies on shore; his
body remains with his friends, and “the mourners go about the streets’’; but when a man
falls overboard at sea and is lost, there is a suddenness in the event, and a difficulty in
realizing it, which give to it an air of awful mystery. A man dies on shore, — you follow
his body to the grave, and a stone marks the spot. You are often prepared for the event.
There is always something which helps you to realize it when it happens, and to recall it
when it has passed. A man is shot down by your side in battle, and the mangled body
remains an object, and a real evidence; but at sea, the man is near you, — at your side, —
you hear his voice, and in an instant he is gone, and nothing but a vacancy shows his loss.
180

(05)

Then, too, at sea — to use a homely but expressive phrase — you miss a man so much. A
dozen men are shut up together in a little bark upon the wide, wide sea, and for months
and months see no forms and hear no voices but their own, and one is taken suddenly
from among them, and they miss him at every turn. It is like losing a limb. There are no
new faces or new scenes to fill up the gap. There is always an empty berth in the forecas-
tle, and one man wanting when the small night-watch is mustered. There is one less to
take the wheel, and one less to lay out with you upon the yard. You miss his form, and the
sound of his voice, for habit had made them almost necessary to you, and each of your
senses feels the loss.
All these things make such a death peculiarly solemn, and the effect of it remains upon
the crew for some time. There is more kindness shown by the officers to the crew, and
by the crew to one another. There is more quietness and seriousness. The oath and the
loud laugh are gone. The officers are more watchful, and the crew go more carefully
aloft. The lost man is seldom mentioned, or is dismissed with a sailor’s rude eulogy, —
“Well, poor George is gone! His cruise is up too soon! He knew his work, and did his duty,
and was a good shipmate.’’ Then usually follows some allusion to another world, for
sailors are almost all believers, in their way; though their notions and opinions are
unfixed and at loose ends.
They say, “God won’t be hard upon the poor fellow,’’ and seldom get beyond the
common phrase which seems to imply that their sufferings and hard treatment here will
be passed to their credit in the books of the Great Captain hereafter, — “To work hard,
live hard, die hard, and go to hell after all, would be hard indeed!’’ Our cook, a simple-
hearted old African, who had been through a good deal in his day, and was rather seri-
ously inclined, always going to church twice a day when on shore, and reading his Bible
on a Sunday in the galley, talked to the crew about spending the Lord’s Days badly, and
told them that they might go as suddenly as George had, and be as little prepared.
Yet a sailor’s life is at best but a mixture of a little good with much evil, and a little
pleasure with much pain. The beautiful is linked with the revolting, the sublime with
the commonplace, and the solemn with the ludicrous.
Not long after we had returned on board with our sad report, an auction was held of the
poor man’s effects. The captain had first, however, called all hands aft and asked them if
they were satisfied that everything had been done to save the man, and if they thought
there was any use in remaining there longer. The crew all said that it was in vain, for the
man did not know how to swim, and was very heavily dressed. So we then filed away
and kept the brig off to her course.
18. The dominant technique in paragraphs one and two (lines 1–18) is
(A) comparison and contrast
(B) cause and effect
(C) narration
(D) description
(E) dialogue
Correct answer: (A). These two paragraphs hop back and forth between land and sea, point-
ing to (A) as the correct answer. The main idea is that death is terrible on land, but more
awful at sea. Notice how many pairs of statements Dana makes: “A man dies on shore; his
body remains” (lines 1–2) is matched by “when a man falls overboard at sea” (lines 2–3).
“A man is shot down by your side in battle” (line 7) contrasts with “but at sea, the man is
near you” (line 8). True, the author does describe a general situation, but there’s not enough
description to warrant choice (D). Nor is this passage truly a narrative, answer (C), because
the author doesn’t tell you what happened. Choices (B) and (E) are completely off-base.

19. What is the primary purpose of the phrase “all these things” (line 19)?
(A) to summarize the content of paragraph three (lines 19–27)
(B) to serve as a transition between paragraphs two and three (lines 6–18 and lines 19–27)
(C) to emphasize the solemnity of death
(D) to stress the immense effect of death
(E) to prepare the reader for a list
Correct answer: (B). Paragraph two is a sad list of the effects of a death at sea, and Dana
makes you experience the utter absence that such a death brings to a close-knit crew. The
next paragraph discusses how the crew and their officers react to a death at sea. Therefore,
this phrase links paragraph two to paragraph three, serving as a transition and making (B)
the right answer. Choices (A) and (E) are off because “all these things” looks back to para-
graph two more than forward to paragraph three. Answers (C) and (D) refer to death in gen-
eral, and Dana is writing about the additional grief that a death at sea brings.
20. What is the best definition of “rude” in the context of line 23?
(A) impolite
(B) unpolished
(C) offensive
(D) ignorant
(E) uninformed
Correct answer: (B). If you aren’t familiar with “rude” as a synonym for “unpolished” —
answer (B) — you can probably guess from the comments that follow it: “Well, poor George
is gone! His cruise is up too soon! He knew his work, and did his duty, and was a good ship-
mate” (lines 24–25). This isn’t a literary speech delivered by a practiced member of the
clergy; it’s a rough but heartfelt comment on a man’s life. Choices (A) and (C) are definitions
of “rude,” but not in this context.
21. Which of the following is an “allusion” referred to in line 25? 
(A) “[S]ailors are almost all believers” (line 26)
(B) “their notions and opinions are unfixed and at loose ends” (lines 26–27)
(C) “God won’t be hard upon the poor fellow” (line 28)
(D) “Our cook, a simple-hearted old African” (lines 31–32)
(E) “always going to church twice a day when on shore” (line 33)
Correct answer: (C). This question revolves around the definition of allusion, a literary term
that describes a reference to something well known, such as a book, event, or artwork. In
line 25, Dana says that sailors make an “allusion to another world,” so you’re looking for a ref-
erence to religion. When you search for religion, you find that all the answers work except
(D). However, only one answer — (C) — quotes the sailors. Bingo: You have your allusion.

Part IV: That Is the Question: Multiple-Choice and Essay Strategy and Practice 

22. Paragraph five (lines 36–38) begins with “Yet.” Which of the following statements describe(s)
the function of this word?
I. It qualifies the recommendation of the “old African” (line 32) to be prepared for death.
II. It contrasts the ideal presented by the cook with the reality of a sailor’s life.
III. It excuses sailors such as George who die unprepared.
(A) I
(B) I and II
(C) II and III
(D) all of the above
(E) none of the above
Correct answer: (D). Roman numeral questions are as easy as 1-2-3 (or I-II-III). Just put a check
mark next to the true statements and look for a match in the answer choices. Statement I is
true; “to qualify” is “to limit,” and while the cook’s idea is wonderful, Dana says that “a sailor’s
life is at best but a mixture of a little good with much evil” (line 36). Hence Dana is limiting
what the cook says. Dana is also contrasting the ideal (be prepared!) with reality (they aren’t
prepared), so II is true. Because paragraph five (lines 36–38) tells you how much pain
is involved in a sailor’s life, III works also. Now you’ve arrived at the answer — (D) or “all of
the above.”
23. What is the “sad report” (line 39)?
(A) man overboard
(B) the pain of a sailor’s life
(C) the poverty of the dead sailor’s possessions
(D) the evil of most sailors’ lives
(E) the “revolting” work required of sailors
Correct answer: (A). The whole passage is about death at sea, and while Dana in this selec-
tion doesn’t tell you the whole story, he refers to that death constantly. He also explains that
“when a man falls overboard and is lost” (lines 2–3), death is even more tragic than death on
land. (A) is the only answer that fits.
24. The tone of this passage may be characterized as
(A) mournful and combative
(B) defiant but philosophical
(C) passionate and committed
(D) emotional but informative
(E) pedantic and dismissive
Correct answer: (D). Did I snare you with (A)? Yes, Dana describes death at sea as a sad
event, but he spends most of his energy explaining why losing a man from a sailing ship is
worse than losing one on shore, and (A) says nothing about the informative aspect of the
passage. Dana never asks, “Why do people die?” — a favorite question of philosphers —
so (B) is out. (C) is too narrow and extreme for this passage, and (E) is way off base. Dana
conveys emotion, but he also strives to inform, making (D) the answer you seek.
183
Chapter 15: Practice Multiple-Choice Questions

25. The author’s purpose is to
(A) inform nonsailors about life at sea
(B) advocate a career at sea
(C) commemorate a dead friend
(D) criticize sailors’ behavior
(E) reveal the dangers of a sailor’s life 
Correct answer: (A). Everything in this passage is aimed at landlubbers — people who get
seasick in a bathtub. Land-based readers don’t understand life and death at sea (how could
they?), so Dana explains how sailors react. The best choice here is (A), because this passage
is meant to inform, nothing more.
Practice Passage Four: Columbian Exposition
At least one passage on the AP English Language and Composition exam is likely to be tech-
nical. A technical passage explains something — a historical event, the workings of a
machine, a scientific theory, and the like. Below is a selection from Diamond Jim Brady:
Prince of the Gilded Age by H. Paul Jeffers (Wiley, 2001; reprinted with permission of John
Wiley and Sons, Inc.). It describes a world’s fair, the Columbian Exposition, held in St. Louis
in 1904. Read the passage and try your hand at the questions based on it.
As in Chicago in 1893, Jim Brady found the host city of the exposition bustling with
excited fair-goers and many of his associates in the railroad and steel businesses. Like
the Columbian Exposition, the St. Louis extravaganza was a celebration of American
industry. It had officially opened at 1:06 p.m., April 30, 1904, with President Theodore
Roosevelt using the same telegraph key in the White House with which President
Cleveland had signaled the start of the Chicago fair.
At that exposition electricity had been a fascinating novelty to the people who jammed
into the exhibition halls. Without it in St. Louis in 1904, the fair could not have been
held. To provide lights and energize machinery and displays in eleven exhibition
“palaces,” the Union Light and Power Company, in collaboration with the Westinghouse
Company, spent $2 million to create the largest generating plant in the world.
Writing in the May 14, 1904, edition of The American Inventor, Charles Alma Buers noted
in enthusiastic but florid prose, “Were it not for this mysterious power, which man has
brought down, as if from the sky, the greatest World’s Fair ever held on the globe would
lie inert; for not a wheel would turn nor a light be seen. It would repose in quietness and
darkness like that which envelopes some isolated tomb. And why should not this expo-
sition receive its ‘vital spark’ from electricity? Why should not this be an electrical fair?
This is an age of things electrical, and to keep abreast with progress, naturally, a display
of that, in science, is now most important.”
Aglow and humming with this wonder, inside and out, were “The Palaces” of Electricity
and Machinery, Agriculture, Education and Social Economy, Festival, Horticulture,
Liberal Arts, Manufacturers, Mines and Minerology, Varied Industries, and, of most inter-
est to Diamond Jim Brady, of Transportation.
Built to evoke the style of the nation’s great railway terminals, it covered fifteen acres
and measured 525 by 1,300 feet. Behind three huge arches and beneath its expansive
roof was a display of old locomotives representing the long struggle for speedy trans-
portation from stagecoaches to the Pullman Palace car. An old horsecar and the modern
“trolley” stood side by side. Visitors inspected a dazzling array of automobiles, descen-
dants of the battery-powered one Jim had ordered eleven years earlier.

Centrally displayed in the hall was an exhibit of the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St.
Louis Railway (known as the Big Four Route) of a locomotive and tender mounted on a
turntable. It was an innovation in railroading that solved the problem of turning around
an engine by driving it onto a revolving platform. In this example the turntable mea-
sured seventy-five feet across. It was built by the Chicago Bridge and Iron Works and
supported the 162 tons of the American Locomotive Company engine and tender, capa-
ble of pulling ten freight cars at sixty miles an hour.
Second only to the turntable in the interest of visitors was the private railway coach that
had been used by Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War. It was housed in a separate
building devoted to a museum displaying other Lincoln relics, including a log cabin
advertised as being the actual one in which the president had been born. Constructed
by the government in a workshop in Alexandria, Virginia, the coach was furnished in
rich tapestries and plushly upholstered chairs and sofas. It had made its first runs over
the lines of the Pennsylvania and the Baltimore & Ohio. Lincoln had used it during his
second campaign in 1864 and had addressed trackside crowds from the platform at the
end of the car.
Should a visitor want to experience a train ride without leaving St. Louis, the fair offered
“The Scenic Railway.” The climax of the ride was a precursor to the roller coaster in
which passengers found themselves screaming and holding on for dear life as the track
took three dips in quick succession at a swift speed. As with future roller coasters, most
people immediately lined up to do it again.
26. What is the dominant rhetorical strategy of paragraph one (lines 1–6)?
(A) cause and effect
(B) comparison and contrast
(C) narration 
(D) description
(E) definition
Correct answer: (B). The first paragraph bobs back and forth between the Chicago fair and
the Columbian Exposition. In fact, the first five words of the paragraph are the tip off: “As in
Chicago in 1893” (line 1). Right away you know you’re in comparison-and-contrast territory,
which steers you to the correct answer, (B).
27. In the phrase “At that exposition” (line 7), what is the antecedent of “that”?
(A) Chicago (line 1)
(B) host city (line 1)
(C) extravaganza (line 3)
(D) Columbian Exposition (line 3)
(E) fair (line 6)
Correct answer: (E). An antecedent is the word a pronoun replaces. By the rules of grammar
(often ignored, but obeyed here), a pronoun replaces a noun or another pronoun, not a
whole set of ideas, and is generally placed near its antecedent. In this passage, “that” refers
to “the Chicago fair” (line 6). The closest answer is (E), “fair.”

28. The quotation marks surrounding “palaces” (line 10) most likely indicate that
(A) the word was used by Jim Brady
(B) the buildings were anything but palatial
(C) exposition officials called the buildings palaces
(D) the writer thinks the label was misapplied
(E) the writer wishes to distance himself from the term
Correct answer: (C). Pity the poor quotation mark. It’s misunderstood and seldom appreci-
ated! Yes, everyone knows that quotation marks surround a direct quotation of someone’s
speech or writing. Answers (A) and (C) fall into this category. But quotation marks have
other uses too. Sanitizing quotation marks place a space between a term and the view of the
writer — a function expressed by (B), (D), and (E). So which one works here? Choice (C).
Why? Well, you can rule out the sanitizing function, because the rest of the passage is heavy
on the exciting details of the fair, including “huge arches” (line 25), “expansive roof” (lines
25–26), and “a dazzling array of automobiles” (line 28). The author’s view doesn’t contradict
the idea of “palaces.” Now you’re down to (A) and (C). Who names buildings at a fair? The
most likely candidate, and your answer, is (C) — the exposition officials.
29. In lines 13–19, the author includes a quotation in order to
(A) illustrate the reaction of people who visited the fair
(B) show how his own view of the fair differs from that of Charles Alma Buers
(C) bring the past alive
(D) provide an example of “florid prose” (line x)
(E) continue the comparison with the Chicago fair of 1893
Correct answer: (A). Before I say anything else, I must tell you that (C) drives English teach-
ers up a wall. It’s the sort of general statement that applies to just about any sentence con-
cerning something that happened before this exact minute. Because it applies to everything,
it means almost nothing. Now that you know (C) isn’t the answer, check out the remaining
possibilities. The quotation praises electricity and doesn’t contradict the author’s admira-
tion of the fair, so (B) drops away. True, the style of the quotation is flowery, but “florid
prose” is a description of the quotation. The quotation isn’t there to illustrate “florid.” Rule
out (D). Moving on to (E): electricity was present at both Chicago and St. Louis, but the quo-
tation isn’t necessary to illustrate this point. The author could simply have stated that fact.
The only reason for the quotation is to show a contemporary view, better known as (A).
30. The pronoun “that” (line 19, last line of the quotation) refers to
(A) isolated tomb (line 16)
(B) vital spark (line 17)
(C) things electrical (line 18)
(D) progress (line 18)
(E) science (line 19)
Correct answer: (D). The fastest way to the correct answer is to restate the sentence con-
taining “that,” inserting the word(s) that makes sense. Then check your insertion against the
answer list and select the closest match. My first try came out this way: “This is an age of
things electrical, and to keep abreast of progress, naturally, a display of new things, in sci-
ence, is now most important.” What matches “new things”? Choice (D). The only other possi-
bility is (C), but “a display of things electrical, in science, is now most important” doesn’t
work as well because of the phrase “in science.”

31. The tone of the passage may be described as
(A) critical but informative
(B) contemplative and nostalgic
(C) playful and distant
(D) informative and appreciative
(E) enthusiastic and exaggerated
Correct answer: (D). The AP exam has so much tone that it must work out at the health club.
This tone question features twins. Take care that both answers fit, because the test writers
like to place a good partner with a bad one. (Sounds like Internet matchmaking, right?) To
determine tone, look at the author’s word choice and the attitude displayed toward the sub-
ject, in this case, the Columbian Exposition. The author sounds like a publicity agent for the
fair. The “Palaces” are “aglow and humming with this wonder” (line 20). The arches are
“huge” (line 25) and much is made of the heavy train cars that are spun on a turntable. The
roller coaster sounds like fun! You get a lot of information and a positive view — making (D)
the best answer. Why don’t the other choices work? (A) bombs because the passage isn’t
critical; nor is it “contemplative” — answer (B) — because the author makes no attempt to
ponder or evaluate the fair. (C) is out because the author isn’t “distant.” He’s a cheerleader.
(E) goes because he doesn’t exaggerate.
32. Which statement describes the rhetorical function of the last sentence of paragraph five
(“Visitors inspected a dazzling array of automobiles, descendants of the battery-powered
one Jim had ordered eleven years earlier” — lines 28–29)?
(A) It contrasts with the information in paragraph six (lines 30–36).
(B) It is an elaboration of the point made in the preceding sentence (“An old horsecar . . .
side by side” — lines 27–28).
(C) It provides a specific example of a point made in paragraph four (“Aglow and
humming . . . Transportation” — lines 20–23).
(D) It focuses the reader’s attention on Jim Brady.
(E) It creates a transition to the next paragraph (lines 30–36).
Correct answer: (C). The sentence they’re asking about concerns cars, and it’s plopped in
the middle of information on electricity and railroads, with a short detour to horsecars and
trolleys. Because cars relate only in a general way to these ideas, you can drop (A), (B), and
(E). Jim Brady is mentioned, but the passage skips over him quickly, so (D) isn’t the answer
either. That leaves (C), which refers to a sentence that’s also an entire paragraph. Tucked
into that sentence is the punch line: “of most interest to Diamond Jim Brady, [the Palace]
of Transportation” (lines 22–28). What’s a car? Transportation, and therefore (C) is the
appropriate choice.
33. Overall, the rhetorical strategy of this passage may be characterized as
(A) example
(B) process
(C) narration
(D) argument
(E) definition
187
Chapter 15: Practice Multiple-Choice Questions

Correct answer: (A). A rhetorical strategy refers to the type of writing. You determine the
strategy by asking yourself, “What’s the author doing here?” The passage takes you through
the Columbian Exposition, giving example after example of what you’d see if you were a time-
traveler to 1904. Hence (A) is the best answer. 
34. Which of the following is parallel to “It was housed in a separate building” (lines 38–39)?
(A) “the private railway coach that had been used by Abraham Lincoln during the Civil
War” (lines 37–38)
(B) “devoted to a museum displaying other Lincoln relics” (line 39)
(C) “advertised as being the actual one in which the president had been born” (line 40)
(D) “Constructed by the government in a workshop in Alexandria, Virginia” (lines 40–41)
(E) “It had made its first runs over the lines of the Pennsylvania and the Baltimore & Ohio”
(lines 42–43).
Correct answer: (E). Parallel structure is (gasp) a grammatical term. (Grammar leave you
breathless? Turn to Chapter 7.) Think of parallel lines in math; they look like train tracks — a
pair that looks the same and heads in the same direction. With that image in mind, search for
an answer that resembles “It was housed in a separate building” (lines 38–39). Choice (E) is
easy, because you have two “It-verb” combinations.
Practice Passage Five: Japan in 1800
At least one selection on the AP English Language and Composition test must have footnotes,
endnotes, parenthetical citations, or a bibliography, because the AP moguls want to make
sure that you understand citations. (If citations hit you like a tornado, turn to Chapter 14 for
assistance.) Spend some quality time with this passage, excerpted from The World in 1800 by
Olivier Bernier (Wiley, 2000; reprinted with permission of John Wiley and Sons, Inc.). 
Note: The “shogunate” was a system of government in Japan in which the “shogun” was the
ruler. “Samurai” were Japanese nobles. “Franciscans” are members of a Catholic religious order.
China was huge, Japan was small. China had a population of 300 million, Japan’s was
about 28 million. When China failed to pay attention to the rest of the world, it was out
of a sense of superiority; when the Japanese government decreed the closing of Japan, it
was out of fear that Japan’s very identity might be lost. Of course, that closing could
never be complete, nor could the country remain exactly as it had been in 1600 when
the shogunate was established; but still Japan looked firmly inward.
Even then, it was not completely cut off from the rest of the world. It sold luxury goods
to the West and copper to China. Chinese and Dutch ships entered the one permitted
harbor at Nagasaki; but no one in Japan felt connected to any other country. The rest of
the world might be one; Japan stood alone.
Japan, in 1800, was a country apart. Naturally, its language, history, and culture were dif-
ferent from those of China or the rest of East Asia; less naturally, its government relied
on a complex system of power relationships, set up 200 years earlier; and held to be a
model of unchanging perfection. The most startling characteristic of all, though, was
that, for 165 years, the Japanese islands had, deliberately and almost completely, been
insulated from the outside world.

The Edict of Closing, which was promulgated in 1635, was specific and thorough.
“Japanese ships,” it declared, “are strictly forbidden to leave for foreign countries. No
Japanese is permitted to go abroad. If any Japanese returns from overseas after residing
there, he must be put to death.”1 It went on to restrict all trade with China — although
an occasional Portuguese ship was allowed in. The only diplomats ever seen there were
Chinese, and they came rarely. As for trade, which was most often discouraged by the
government, it was carried out by Chinese and Dutch merchants. The former bought
copper; the latter came mostly to buy lacquerwork, bronzes, silks, and porcelain. More
trade came through the Ryukyu Islands, the property of the Satsuma clan, but that was
largely ignored by the government.
There were three main reasons for this extraordinary state of affairs. One was to prevent
any outflow of gold and silver — always in short supply within the empire. If nothing were
known of the outside, if no traders were permitted outside Nagasaki, then there would be
no imports. The sale of luxury goods, on the other hand, brought in precious metals, and
so it was allowed. The second, and even more important reason, was to prevent mission-
aries from entering Japan. The culture and government of Japan were based on religion;
if the gods suddenly were mere pagan idols, as the missionaries claimed, then the whole
structure of the country was likely to be destroyed. The government therefore banned
Christianity. The converts resisted in a number of places, particularly the samurai and
peasants at Shimabara in southern Kyushu, adding civil unrest to the threat presented by
a new religion. Political fighting, now revived, was the very problem which the rulers had
taken pride in solving. Even worse, the Franciscans in Manila, their headquarters in the
Far East, let it be known they would ask the king of Spain to intervene; thus, to actual civil
unrest, Christianity added the threat of foreign invasion. That was clearly intolerable. Just
as alarming, the Christians in Shimabara defended themselves so efficaciously that their
fortress could be taken only with the help of Dutch warships. The Dutch, being Protestant,
were naturally delighted to help put down Catholic converts.
As for Western religious publications, the government made very sure they could not
be accidentally brought in. When, in the 1770s, a Dutch trading ship came into the
harbor at Nagasaki, “all the Prayer-Books and Bibles belonging to the sailors were col-
lected, and put into a chest, which was nailed down . . . and left under the care of the
Japanese till the time of our departure,”2 one of the officers, Carl Peter Thunberg, noted.
The third reason for the closure was just as cogent. The Japanese ruling class prized its
culture; it had no wish to see it Westernized. The best way to defend it from all intrusions,
it decided, was physically to prevent all non-Japanese ideas and artifacts from reaching
the people. These were all strong and clearly stated motivations. Just as important, how-
ever, was the essential justification of Japan’s peculiar system of government; that it must
preserve, unaltered, the settlement reached in 1600 by the first shogun of the Tokugawa
family; and that the best way to do that was to prevent any change of any kind.

35. “China was huge, Japan was small” (line 1) is an example of
(A) aphorism
(B) antithesis
(C) juxtaposition
(D) hyperbole
(E) repetition

Correct answer: (B). Oh, those English-teacher terms. They’re enough to give you a
headache. Instead of searching for an aspirin, take a look at these definitions. An aphorism is
something normal people (not English teachers) call an “old saying.” An aphorism doesn’t
actually have to be old; it just has to be something that catches on and expresses a moral
truth or principle. Antithesis puts contrary ideas together in a similar sentence pattern.
Juxtaposition means putting two things next to each other, so one is seen in light of the other.
A hyperbole is what you say when you describe the amount of homework you have (a million
hours!). In other words, it’s exaggeration. Repetition is . . . well, I think you know that repeti-
tion is repeating! Now that those words are in your vocabulary, the question is easy: (B) is
the answer.
36. The first sentence of paragraph two (“Even then . . . world” — line 7) 
(A) repeats the information given in paragraph one (lines 1–6)
(B) contradicts the main idea of paragraph one (lines 1–6)
(C) qualifies the main idea of paragraph one (lines 1–6)
(D) quantifies the information in paragraph one (lines 1–6)
(E) exemplifies the situation described in paragraph one (lines 1–6)
Correct answer: (C). The first paragraph compares China and Japan in a couple of ways
but comes down hard on the idea that Japan “looked firmly inward” (line 6) because the
Japanese government closed the country to outsiders. The first sentence of paragraph two
explains that the country wasn’t completely closed; a few contacts with outsiders were
allowed. Therefore, “Even then . . . world” (line 7) qualifies the main idea of paragraph one.
“To qualify” in AP terms is to explain exceptions or to set limits, not to make the grade.
(Though if you go through this chapter carefully, you will make the grade!)
37. Which of the following is the most likely reason why the author quotes from the “Edict of
Closing” (line 17)?
(A) to show how extreme Japan’s isolation was
(B) to illustrate the Japanese system of government
(C) to provide a change of pace for the reader
(D) to clarify the situation of foreigners in Japan
(E) to introduce the idea of restriction 
Correct answer: (A). You take a vacation abroad, and when you return home, they kill you.
That’s what the quotation says. (And you thought airport baggage claims were a problem!)
The Edict of Closing is about as extreme as a law can be, so (A) is the reason for inserting the
quotation. (B) is out because the quotation doesn’t deal with the government, just with its
actions. Answer (C) is way too general; it sounds like a sentence students throw into an
essay when they’re stretching to make the required word count. You can dump (D) because
the quotation deals with the Japanese, not with foreigners in Japan. Finally, (E) fails because
the idea of restriction was introduced in paragraph one, not with the quotation.
190
Part IV: That Is the Question: Multiple-Choice and Essay Strategy and Practice 

38. Lines 32–43 (“The culture and government of Japan . . . Catholic converts”) present
(A) reasons why the Japanese government banned foreigners
(B) information on Western religions
(C) an expansion of the preceding sentence (“The second, and even more important
reason, was to prevent missionaries from entering Japan” — lines 31–32)
(D) a contradiction of the preceding sentence (“The second, and even more important
reason, was to prevent missionaries from entering Japan” — lines 31–32)
(E) an introduction to the next paragraph (lines 44–48)
Correct answer: (C). Go back to the lines designated in the question. All of them explain why
Western religion, which was brought to Japan by missionaries, was a threat to the Japanese
government. Hence these lines are an expansion of the sentence they follow, and (C) is your
answer. The only other remotely possible choice is (E) because the next paragraph also
deals with religious restrictions. However, the lines mentioned in (E) merely explain what the
restriction is, not why the government felt the need to restrict foreign religion.
39. Which statement about the first citation is true?
(A) The quotation came from an article entitled Japan: A Documentary History.
(B) The quotation came from a book entitled Japan: A Documentary History.
(C) Japan: A Documentary History was published by a company called London.
(D) The quotation appeared on page 1984 of this source.
(E) The publisher of this source is unknown.
Correct answer: (B). Did your eye land on (B)? If so, good for you. Book titles are italicized or
underlined; article titles are placed inside quotation marks. London is where the book was
published, not the company. (Years ago the name of the company wasn’t always given. The
assumption was that you could locate the company with the other information in the cita-
tion.) The number 221 is the page where the quotation may be found, and 1984 is the year of
publication.
40. In the second citation, the number 3 represents
(A) the edition
(B) the page number
(C) the section of the book being quoted
(D) the number of times the book has been reissued
(E) the volume number
Correct answer: (E). Either Carl Peter Thunberg traveled a lot, or he wrote a ton about every
moment of his trips, because 3 is the volume number. And that makes (E) the winning letter!
In footnotes and endnotes, the page number is the last number cited.
191
Chapter 15: Practice Multiple-Choice Questions

41. Taken together, the citations for this passage suggest that
(A) the author researched from primary sources
(B) the author relied on secondary sources
(C) the passage is not well-supported by research
(D) the best sources for this topic are British
(E) both books and articles are useful sources for this topic
Correct answer: (A). A primary source is firsthand; it’s produced by the culture you’re study-
ing. A secondary source interprets or comments on primary sources. David J. Lu’s book is
subtitled “A Documentary History,” so chances are it includes documents from Japan —
a primary source. Thunberg’s travelogue was published in 1793, making it more or less con-
temporary to the period discussed in the passage. (Remember, the passage is from a book
entitled The World in 1800.) The best answer, therefore, is (A). Choices (B), (C), and (E) are
inaccurate. You may have fallen for the trap I placed in (D). Yes, both books were published
in London, but how do you know that these sources are the best? You don’t, so (D) doesn’t
make the cut.

ifteen minutes to read maybe 2,000 words. Two hours to write approximately 1,500
words. Three essays totaling 55 percent of your AP grade. Do the math whatever way
you wish, and the result is the same: You have to work at a pace that would earn you a
speeding ticket if you were driving instead of completing the essay section of the AP English
Language and Composition exam.
Speed like that can be achieved only if you’re fully prepared. That is, you know what to
expect, you’ve decided ahead of time how to proceed, and your essay-writing skills have
been so fine-tuned that they practically purr. What luck! This chapter takes care of all those
things. To ace the AP essays, read on.
Getting the Logistics Down Pat
The essay section, also known as the “free response” portion of the exam, begins when you
tear the plastic wrap from a green question booklet. The proctor announces the start of a
fifteen-minute reading period, during which you look over and annotate the three questions
you find inside. Here’s what you see:
 A synthesis essay. One synthesis essay is on every test. It includes a short introduc-
tion to the topic (in recent years, the effect of television on presidential elections and
the advisability of keeping the penny coin), a prompt (lit-speak for “essay question”),
and six or seven sources. You have to develop your own position on the topic (“televi-
sion has ruined democracy” or “save the penny,” perhaps) and support that position
with references to at least three of the sources. 
 An analysis essay. Your exam will probably include an analysis essay. They give you
one — or occasionally two — passages and ask you to discuss how the writing style
relates to content or to one specific aspect of content (characterization, attitude,
purpose, and the like).
 An argument essay. You may be presented with an issue and asked to take a stand and
defend it. Sometimes the issue is defined by a short quotation or passage.

After the reading period, you tear still more plastic wrap, this time from a pink answer-
booklet. It’s up to you to fill that booklet with three essay responses. As you work, keep
these points in mind:
 You don’t have to do the essays in order. Since its debut in 2007, the synthesis essay
has appeared first. It’s the longest, and the College Board may be suggesting that you
should knock it off while your brain is still fresh — well, as fresh as a brain can be after
an hour of AP multiple-choice questions. But if you wish, you can make the synthesis
essay your second or third task. 
The essay section differs from the multiple-choice portion of the exam. Many test
takers don’t have enough time to complete all the multiple-choice questions, so work-
ing from easiest to hardest makes sense, because you want to answer every question
you’re likely to get right. However, pretty much everyone gets to all the essays. In this
case, maximizing your score revolves around writing three responses that showcase
your skill and knowledge. Before you decide to work from hardest to easiest (or the
reverse), write a couple of practice essays from Chapter 17. Decide what type is easy
for you and what type sends you up a wall. Then take at least one of the practice APs
(found in Chapters 18 and 20). Notice your energy level as you write. Can you sustain a
solid effort after an hour and a half? If so, feel free to leave the toughest writing for last.
If not, hit the hard stuff first.
 When you answer an essay question, put the number of the essay on the top of each
page in the little box provided for that purpose. Also indicate the page number and
the total number of pages in your essay (“p. 1 of 3,” for example). At the end of each
essay, write a large # — journalists’ traditional symbol for “the end.”
 If you run out of room in the booklet, the proctor distributes lined paper, so space is
not an issue. Consider skipping lines as you write. In a double-spaced format, you have
room to tuck in an idea or make a correction.
 Write as much as you wish on the question booklet, but be aware that graders see
only the pink answer booklet and any sheets attached to it. Before your two writing-
hours are up, be sure that all your brilliant ideas have “hit the pink.”
 Only blue or black ink is allowed, so leave the pen with that lovely shade of lilac at
home. Erasable pens are permitted, but they tend to smear. You’re better off writing in
regular ballpoint ink. 
 If you want to change something, draw one neat line through it and write the correc-
tion above the deleted words. Place a caret (^) under the line to indicate where the
words should be inserted.
 If you need to add a lot of material, place an asterisk (*) at the spot where the new
material should be inserted. Write “see insert A” next to the asterisk. At the end of the
essay, write the paragraph you want to insert. Put a box around it and label it “insert A.”
As a teacher who reads tons of in-class essays, I can tell you with absolute certainty
that your grader will make every attempt to find “insert A” or even “insert B” or “C”
and read your words in the proper order. I can also tell you with absolute certainty that
your grader will have a headache if you pull this stunt too often. A headachy grader is
less likely to give you a good score. Moral of the story: plan ahead. (Chapter 3 explains
how to gather ideas and put them in order before writing.)
 As you work on the practice essays (see Chapter 17), pay attention to penmanship.
Most students these days are more comfortable typing on a keyboard than writing with
a ballpoint pen. If your handwriting is illegible, your grader will be grumpy. You don’t
want a grumpy grader any more than you want a headachy one.

Part IV: That Is the Question: Multiple-Choice and Essay Strategy and Practice 

If your writing isn’t readable no matter how hard you try, you may have dysgraphia, a learn-
ing disability. Way before the AP exam strikes, speak with your guidance counselor or with
your teacher. Dysgraphic students qualify for accommodations on test day — usually a
computer on which you can type your responses.
Keeping an Eye on the Clock:
Time Management
In Chapter 3, I explain the process of essay writing — gathering ideas, creating a thesis
statement, formulating supporting points and putting them in order, writing, and drafting.
Chapter 3, however, refers to situations in which your time is not severely limited. The AP
exam increases time pressure in a major way and therefore calls for major strategic planning.
Follow these steps:
1. During the 15-minute reading period, read and annotate the questions.
(In the next section, “Adapting Your Writing Process to the AP Exam,” I explain how to
annotate both prompts and passages.) You can devote more time to annotation later,
but even during the first run-through you should jot down ideas and underline impor-
tant sections of the text.
2. Once you’ve seen all three questions, decide the order in which you’ll answer them.
Don’t agonize about this step. Make a decision and stick to it. If you haven’t finished read-
ing all the passages by the end of the reading period, make a decision anyway. When the
writing period begins, you should know which question you’re answering first.
3. During the writing period, devote about 40 minutes to each essay. 
You can go a little over or under — say two or three minutes, but no more. Remember:
A blank essay earns no points at all. No matter how wonderful one of your essays is,
you don’t want the graders to average in a zero (for a blank essay) or a very low score
(for a half-completed effort).
The synthesis essay contains six or seven sources, but you have to refer to a minimum
of three. After the first read-through, choose the sources you’ll definitely use. Spend
more time on them and skim the sources you aren’t going to reference.
4. Divide the 40 minutes into prewriting, writing, and revising periods. 
These slots aren’t equal in length. Everyone’s needs are slightly different, but a good
guideline is about 7 minutes for reading and annotating (in addition to the work you
did during the reading period), 28 minutes for writing, and 5 minutes for checking and
revising.
Don’t skip any steps in the writing process, no matter how tempted you are to write for 40
minutes straight before hopping into the next essay. The best essays come from an organized
plan (the prewriting stage) and a final look (the revision stage).
Adapting Your Writing Process to the AP Exam
By the time those pink and green booklets land in front of you, you’ve already developed a
fairly sophisticated writing process. (If you need a refresher, check out Chapter 3.) Just a bit
of effort adapts your process to the AP exam, so you can streamline the way you decode a
prompt, annotate, create a thesis, and organize ideas into supporting points. 
195
Chapter 16: Writing at Warp Speed: The Essay Section

Working from a prompt
Prompts are statements that “prompt” you to write. On the AP exam they may seem fancier
than the prompts your teacher assigns for class- or homework. But really, they’re just ques-
tions. Take a look at a few AP-style prompts. These questions were never on the exam, but
could have been.
 Argument prompt: In recent decades some activists have promoted the idea that the
United States government should make reparations to the descendents of slaves. Read
the following passage, which is a letter written to The New York Times about this issue.
In a well-organized essay, explain your own point of view on reparations.
 Synthesis prompt: The question below is based on the six sources which follow it.
To answer this question, you must synthesize information from these sources. Your
essay must present a clear argument supported by at least three of the sources. Do not
merely summarize the information or the point of view of the sources. Be sure to cite
information, quotations, or ideas taken from these sources. You may cite them as
“Source A,” “Source B,” or by the descriptions in parentheses. 
Source A (McCullough)
Source B (Doctoroff)
Source C (International Olympic Committee)
Source D (Table of Revenue)
Source E (NBC News)
Source F (Wide World of Sports)
Every two years either the summer or winter Olympic Games take place. Typically, sev-
eral countries compete to host this event. The winning bid generally requires the host-
city to build new sports venues such as stadiums, arenas, ski slopes, tracks, pools, and
the like. Yet the Olympics are frequently controversial; some citizens object to the use
of public money for these games, while others believe that the attention of the world is
worth the price. Read the following six sources and develop your own point of view on
the desirability of hosting the Olympic Games. In a well-written essay explain your
point of view and support your stance with references to the sources supplied.
 Analysis prompt: The passage below is excerpted from an essay by Calvin Trillin. Read
the passage and explain how the author conveys his attitude toward fast-food chains.
 Paired-passage prompt: Both passages below describe a scene in which a child con-
fronts prejudice for the first time. Read the passages carefully and in a well-written
essay, compare the rhetorical techniques the authors use to convey the effect of this
experience on each child.
The standard part of prompts
As you see, a couple of standard elements show up in nearly every prompt:
 In a well-written essay: As if you were aiming for a poorly written one!
 In a well-organized essay: Good thing they told you to organize your essay; I’m sure
you intended to strew ideas around at random.
 Read the following passage: This one shows up in essays tied to reading material.
This phrase belongs in “no-brainer” territory because nobody writes an essay about a
passage without reading the passage. 
These standard elements aren’t worth the ink it takes to print them. Ignore these phrases
and get to the good stuff — the core of the question.
196
Part IV: That Is the Question: Multiple-Choice and Essay Strategy and Practice 

Synthesis essays always contain a statement explaining that you have to synthesize at least
three of the sources and that you must cite these sources in your essay. A synthesis prompt
also reminds you that summarizing or reporting isn’t enough. All this information is impor-
tant, but you can learn it now. Study the sample prompt so that you know the standard ele-
ments. On the exam, you can quickly move to the variables.
The nonstandard parts
Decoding the nonstandard portion of a prompt is important — so important that you should
spend a couple of your precious writing-minutes on this task. After all, if you don’t know
what you have to do, how can you do it? Here’s the deal:
 Read with your pen in hand. You should annotate the prompt as well as the passage.
 Underline key words. What’s a key word? Anything that directs you to do something
(other than the standard elements I explain earlier in this section). Also, anything that
points you to a specific writing technique or feature of a passage.
 Restate the task in your own words. Be direct and simple: “I have to take a position
on reparations for slavery. I have to write about my point of view and support it.” Or,
“I have to explain how the child in Passage One reacted to prejudice. I have to explain
how the child in Passage Two reacted to prejudice. I have to compare the way the
author of Passage One wrote about the child’s reaction to the way the author of
Passage Two wrote about the child’s reaction.” 
Because the clock is always ticking, don’t rewrite the prompt. Just underline the important
stuff and “hear” the restated prompt in your mind.
Annotating the text
In Chapter 3, I explain how to annotate the text when you have lots of time . . . well, as much
time as anyone ever gets these days. Annotating the passages on the essay section of the AP
exam should really be called “speed-annotating” because 40 minutes goes by in a blink. You
have to make every second count. Follow these steps:
1. Keep the task firmly in your mind.
This is not the time to let your attention wander. If they ask you about the author’s
attitude toward arts education, waste no time on information about the author’s gym
teacher, unless you can relate gym class to the arts. (Maybe she cut gym so she could
sculpt or something like that.)
2. After the first read-through, quickly decide what’s important. 
Continuing the preceding example (the author’s attitude toward arts education), imag-
ine that you notice the extreme language with which the author praises art. She doesn’t
take an “interesting class”; she’s enrolled in a “fascinating exploration of sculpture”
that’s an “adventure” equal to “an epic hero’s journey.” Fine, now you know that diction
(word choice) is something you should discuss in your essay. 
3. Reread, looking for evidence in each category you identified. 
Going on with the example of arts education, reread and underline all the extreme
words — those that praise art and perhaps those that condemn other types of learn-
ing. If you discovered that an appeal to authority is an important factor, underline all
references to the “Official Commission on Education in the Twenty-First Century” or
whatever authority is cited.
197
Chapter 16: Writing at Warp Speed: The Essay Section

4. Note the main idea of each paragraph. 
Don’t waste many words on this task; simply write one or two words to remind you of
the content of a particular paragraph. These marginal notes form a skeletal outline of
the passage. When you’re writing and need to find a reference, the marginal notes take
you to the right spot instantly.
5. If you come up with any ideas for a thesis or subtopics, jot down a few words in the
margins. 
Ever thoughtful, the test makers leave room at the bottom of the page for your note-
taking convenience. Use this space to capture a fleeting idea before it vanishes. Again,
don’t write a lot; one or two words should be enough to boost your memory.
Figure 16-1 is an example of an annotated passage for an AP question. Notice that the under-
lining and notes are sparse, but they do the job.
Formulating a thesis and supporting points
Once you’ve annotated the text, look at what you have. Does a thesis — the main idea you’re
proving — come to mind? If not, spend a minute — not more than two! — using one of the
idea-gathering techniques I describe in Chapter 3. You can cluster, free-write, or list until you
have a sense of where your essay is going. Your next job is to state that direction as a thesis.
Then you group your ideas into logical subtopics — the points you make in support of your
thesis.
Creating a thesis
The prompt often contains the seeds of a thesis. If you’re asked to take a position on repara-
tions for slavery, for example, your statement in favor of or against reparations (or a quali-
fied reaction that’s partially in favor and partially opposed) is your thesis. Other prompts are
vague (“Discuss how the author conveys the relationship between the father and son,” for
example). Your thesis for this sort of essay emerges from the details you’ve noted in the
passage. If the passage is filled with angry dialogue from the father and a description of the
son’s silent reaction, your thesis may be that the father’s emotions have silenced the son.

But to say this of Swift is not to say that he was a journalist. The journalist is the 
man of the hour writing for the hour in harmony with popular opinion. Both his text and his 
heads are ready-made for him. He follows the beaten road, and only essays new paths when 
conditions have become such as to force him along them. Such a man Swift certainly was
not. Journalism was not his way to the goal. If anything, it was, as Epictetus might have
said, but a tavern by the way-side in which he took occasion to find the means by which the 
better to attain his goal. If Swift's contributions to the literature of his day be journalism,
then did journalism spring full-grown into being, and its history since his time must be 
considered as a history of its degeneration. But they were much more than journalism. That
they took the form they did, in contributions to the periodicals of his day, is but an accident 
which does not in the least affect the contributions themselves. These, in reality, constitute a 
criticism of the social and political life of the first thirty years of the English eighteenth
century. From the time of the writing of "A Tale of a Tub" to the days of the Drapier's
Letters, Swift dissected his countrymen with the pitiless hand of the master-surgeon. So 
profound was his knowledge of human anatomy, individual and social, that we shudder now
at the pain he must have inflicted in his unsparing operations. So accurate was his judgment
that we stand amazed at his knowledge, and our amazement often turns to a species of
horror as we see the cuticle flapped open revealing the crude arrangement beneath.
 
 
Nor is it to argue too nicely, to suggest that our present sympathy for the past pain,
our amazement, and our horror, are, after all, our own unconscious tributes to the power of
the man who calls them up, and our confession of the lasting validity of his criticism.

Part IV: That Is the Question: Multiple-Choice and Essay Strategy and Practice 

A good thesis statement has the following characteristics:
 Brevity. Most thesis statements are fairly short, one or two sentences maximum. A
common mistake is to cram too much into a thesis statement. The complexity of your
ideas can be developed in the essay; you don’t need to say everything in your thesis
statement. 
 Clarity. In an argumentative or synthesis essay, you know what side of the fence the
writer is on (against standardized testing and in favor of keeping the penny coin, for
example) after reading the thesis. You know which rhetorical techniques the essay will
explore (such as nautical metaphors, diction, and syntax). You don’t know every aspect
of the discussion, but you’ve been oriented to the direction the discussion will take.
 Specificity. If you generalize too much, you end up with a really bad thesis statement.
An essay based on the thesis that “authors use many different rhetorical devices in
their writing” has already flopped. Your thesis should specifically address the prompt
and the passage, if one is provided. 
To help you visualize a proper thesis, here are some examples:
Although proponents of standardized testing claim that it raises skill levels, such testing
makes schooling a soulless exercise instead of true education.
The humble penny is so much a part of our tradition that discontinuing this coin would
do more harm than good.
In this excerpt from his autobiography, author Henry Danis employs a series of nautical
metaphors to convey his sense of being carried along by the tide of history. Danis’
diction and syntax reinforce this point.
In arguing for a lower voting age, the writer appeals to authority and to the emotions of
his reader.
The narrator of Passage A shows her dismay at being the victim of prejudice obliquely,
through figurative language. The narrator of Passage B expresses his reaction to a simi-
lar situation directly, in narrative form.
Supporting points
Your thesis is the roof that covers the information in the essay; supporting points (also known
as subtopics) are the walls that hold up the roof. If you did a good job annotating the passage
and/or brainstorming for ideas, coming up with supporting points is a cinch. Use this method:
1. Review your notes and the underlined portions of the passage. 
Don’t spend a lot of time on this step; a couple of minutes should be enough.
2. Look for logical groups.
If you’ve underlined three metaphors, you know that “metaphor” is one group. If you’ve
written “appeal to emotion” on the bottom of the page and noted “penny proverbs” in
the margin, you have another supporting point (that “a penny saved is a penny earned”
and “a penny for your thoughts” would be obsolete without the coin).
3. Label and sort your ideas.
Don’t get fancy. You have no time! Simply write “A” next to everything in one group, “B”
next to everything in another group, and so forth. For instance, you may place “A” next
to everything that relates to metaphor and “B” next to each example of unusual syntax.
You can also connect related ideas with a line, so long as you don’t obscure the text.
(You may have to reread it.)
199
Chapter 16: Writing at Warp Speed: The Essay Section

4. Put the ideas in order. 
As always, the faster you work, the better, so don’t rewrite anything. Decide which
supporting point is first, which is second, and so on. Don’t get hung up on your labels.
The supporting points don’t have to be in alphabetical order! Feel free to discuss the
“B group” first and the “A group” later.
Figure 16-2 is an example of an annotated passage in which ideas have been grouped into
three supporting points: (A) sentence structure, (B) appeal to authority, and (C) metaphors.
In your essay, you may deal with these points in any order you wish.
Handling Evidence
When you write an AP essay, you’re the prosecutor and your grader is the jury. You have to
make a case in support of your thesis, and you can’t do so without presenting evidence. If
you’re working from a text, the evidence is staring you in the face: the language and ideas in
the passage. If you’re arguing an issue not connected to a text (or if you’re allowed to bring
in your own experience or observations to supplement a text), the details you provide serve
as evidence. 
Quotations are great for your essay — sometimes. Why not always? Because it’s fairly easy to
expend too many minutes rewriting words from the passage without achieving your purpose.
In this section I explain when to quote the exact words from a passage, how to choose rele-
vant quotations, and how to insert quotations into your text.

But to say this of Swift is not to say that he was a journalist. The journalist is the 
man of the hour writing for the hour in harmony with popular opinion. Both his text and his 
heads are ready-made for him. He follows the beaten road, and only essays new paths when 
conditions have become such as to force him along them. Such a man Swift certainly was
not. Journalism was not his way to the goal. If anything, it was, as Epictetus might have
said, but a tavern by the way-side in which he took occasion to find the means by which the 
better to attain his goal. If Swift's contributions to the literature of his day be journalism,
then did journalism spring full-grown into being, and its history since his time must be 
considered as a history of its degeneration. But they were much more than journalism. That
they took the form they did, in contributions to the periodicals of his day, is but an accident 
which does not in the least affect the contributions themselves. These, in reality, constitute a

Part IV: That Is the Question: Multiple-Choice and Essay Strategy and Practice 

Knowing when to quote
To quote or not to quote is a pretty important question. As a general rule, if the idea rather
than the wording is important to your argument, you can paraphrase (restate ideas in your
own words) or simply refer to the passage. On the other hand, you should always quote from
the text if you’re discussing how something is written. Those are the general rules. Now for
some specific guidelines on when to quote (and when not to quote) the text:
 Always quote when you’re analyzing diction. How can you discuss the author’s word
choice if you don’t examine those words directly?
 Generally, you should quote when you’re talking about syntax (the way a sentence
fits together grammatically). Why “generally” and not “always”? Because sometimes
a summary does the job. For example, you may mention that the second paragraph is a
series of “I-verb” statements without quoting those statements. However, sometimes
you should quote to illustrate an unusual word order (for example, “Such a man Swift
certainly was not” — a sentence from Figure 16-1), especially if you want to make a
point about that specific sentence.
 You should quote whenever you’re trying to establish attitude — of the author or
of a person/character appearing in the passage — because attitude is frequently
dependent upon syntax and diction. In New York, for example, “You talkin’ to me?”
can be a declaration of war or a simple inquiry. Whatever case you’re making, the quo-
tation helps.
 Quote when you’re discussing tone. Tone — the nostalgic, reflective, critical, sarcas-
tic, ironic, or other flavor of a piece of writing — can’t be examined without quotations.
 Quote when you’re discussing characterization. Characterization (the way a personal-
ity is presented) is often dependent upon the specific words used in dialogue and
description. Quotations help here!
 If the passage is a narrative (a story), you don’t need to quote when you refer to
events, unless the wording is significant. “James demolished the opposing team” is
not the same as “James defeated the opposing team.” 
 In discussing the author’s purpose, you may not need direct quotations. A passage
may present a series of reasons why the United States should sign a certain treaty. You
can refer to those reasons without quoting them if you’re discussing the author’s inten-
tion to persuade pro-war delegates that peace is possible.
 Anything about figurative language (metaphors, similes, symbols, and other imagi-
native elements) must be quoted. You can’t analyze language without examining the
exact words.
 Imagery — the sensory details the author includes — probably requires quotation.
Occasionally you can summarize by saying that “the second paragraph is dominated
by imagery of the flower garden” or something similar. 
Don’t be tempted to quote and then “translate” the quotation into your own words. I see
“translation” a lot when students are analyzing older texts, especially Shakespeare’s works.
They write things such as “In Hamlet, the title character asks, ‘To be or not to be.’ This sen-
tence means that Hamlet is considering whether it is better to continue living or to die.” The
reader, which as you know is your AP grader, understands the text without your explanation.
Analyze all you want, but don’t translate.
201
Chapter 16: Writing at Warp Speed: The Essay Section

Determining how much to quote
Quotations are potent weapons as you battle to support your thesis. However, it’s possible
to have too much of a good thing. Follow these guidelines in deciding how much to quote:
 You don’t always need five quotations proving the same point, unless you’re saying
that the author emphasized that point or that the author is fond of overkill. (Your AP
grader may decide that you’re fond of overkill and dock some points from your essay.)
 As always, budget your time. If you want to hit three subtopics in your essay, don’t
quote seven examples for the first subtopic. You won’t have time to make your case for
the other two subtopics.
 Aim for balance. If diction is the most striking element in a passage, of course you quote
more in a paragraph discussing diction than you do in a paragraph about imagery. But if
the subtopics are equally important, your evidence should reflect that fact.
 Some test takers quote twenty words where two or three would be enough. For example,
in one of the bullet points in the preceding section, I mentioned that “James demolished
the opposing team” differs in meaning from “James defeated the opposing team.” If
you’re discussing that difference, you probably need to quote only the verb (“demolish”
or “defeat,”) because that’s the crucial element. Similarly, if you want to make a point
about syntax, you may not need an entire sentence — just the subject-verb combo, if
that’s what you’re analyzing. 
Inserting quotations into the text
First, take a look at how not to insert a quotation. Read this clunker:
The author argues that Swift was not a journalist. “That they took the form they did, in
contributions to the periodicals of his day, is but an accident which does not in the least
affect the contributions themselves.” Swift’s criticisms are valid. 
The quotation in the preceding example is a bump in the road. Nothing leads into it, and
nothing comes out of it. Here’s a better version of the preceding example:
The author argues that Swift was not a journalist. The fact that Swift wrote for “the period-
icals of his day” was “an accident” that takes nothing away from Swift’s “contributions.” In
fact, the author sees Swift’s criticisms as having “lasting validity.”
Now the quotations are smoothly woven into the sentence. They should be fused to your
analysis also. Notice the difference between version one and version two here:
 Version one: The author says that a journalist “follows the beaten road, and only
essays new paths when conditions have become such as to force him along them.”
This quotation shows that the author has little respect for journalists.
 Version two: The author shows little respect for journalism because a journalist
“follows the beaten road, and only essays new paths when conditions have become
such as to force him along them.”
Version two assumes that the reader can make a connection between the analysis (the
author’s lack of respect for journalism) and the quotation. By the way, the expression
“This quotation shows that” makes English teachers grind their teeth. Don’t use it!
202
Part IV: That Is the Question: Multiple-Choice and Essay Strategy and Practice 

Punctuating quotations properly is easy. If you have a speaker tag (“the author says,”
“Mr. Wilde remarks,” and similar expressions), capitalize the first word of the quotation and
separate it form the rest of the sentence with a comma:
The author remarks, “Swift dissected his countrymen with the pitiless hand of a master
surgeon.”
“Swift dissected his countrymen with the pitiless hand of a master surgeon,” remarks
the author.
Without a speaker tag, the quotation isn’t separated from the rest of the sentence by a
comma and the first word isn’t capitalized (unless of course it’s a name):
The author remarks that Jonathan Swift “dissected his countrymen with the pitiless
hand of a master surgeon.”
If you omit words from within a quotation, insert three spaced dots to show the gap. If the
gap is a complete sentence, you need an extra dot to represent the period:
The author remarks, “If Swift’s contributions . . . be journalism,” journalism was born
fully developed. (gap of a few words)
The author states, “These, in reality, constitute a criticism of the social and political life
of the first thirty years of the English eighteenth century. . . . Swift dissected his country-
men.” (gap includes a complete sentence)
If you change anything in the quotation, place your words in brackets:
“So profound was [Swift’s] knowledge of human anatomy,” according to the passage,
that he inflicted pain.
If your punctuation skills are rusty, turn to Chapter 7 for a review.
Using citations
When you’re quoting in response to a single- or paired-passage essay, you don’t need cita-
tions, though you should identify in the text which of the pair-members you’re talking about.
(Say something like “In Passage One, the child . . .”) In the synthesis essay, however, you
must cite whatever you glean from a source — whether you quote the source directly or
refer to it indirectly. The citations may, according to the rules of the test, be to “Source A,”
“Source B,” and so on, or they may use the names of the sources indicated in the question.
Footnotes, endnotes, and parenthetical citations are all acceptable. The easiest method for a
synthesis essay is the last, because you don’t have to worry about leaving space at the
bottom of the page or at the end of the essay. 
To cite sources parenthetically, place the source identification in parentheses after each quo-
tation or idea you’re citing. The citation is not part of the quotation, so it comes after the
closing quotation marks. The citation is part of the sentence, so it precedes the period.
Here’s an example:
Connolly argues that arts education is “indispensable” (Source A).
203
Chapter 16: Writing at Warp Speed: The Essay Section

If the sentence continues, insert the citation wherever the source material ends, as in this
example:
Connolly argues that arts education is desperately needed (Source A), though he
provides little evidence for that assertion.
For more information on the synthesis essay, see “Synthesizing a great essay” later in this
chapter.
Selecting a Sturdy Structure for Your Essay
The graders understand that you don’t have time to come up with a fancy organizational plan
for your essay when you’re writing with such a strict time limit. Even so, you have to organize
your ideas logically. Enter structure — the basic pattern you follow when you write. In this
section I explain some standard, easily adaptable structures that work well with AP questions.
Deductive and inductive 
I’m guessing that most essays you’ve written in English class are deductive; you begin with a
thesis statement and move to proof. A deductive essay generally has this structure:
 Introduction. The introduction contains your thesis, supporting points, and perhaps a
quotation or intriguing statement to draw the reader’s attention. If the author or title is
identified, place that information in the introduction.
 Body. In the body of your essay you analyze, argue, or otherwise explain yourself.
Generally, but not always, you address one subtopic per paragraph. Here’s where you
provide specifics – the proof for your thesis.
 Conclusion. A conclusion isn’t a summary or (pause for a moment while I shudder) a
restatement of the introduction. It’s the natural last step in your argument, where you
bring everything together and take the discussion to the next level.
This sort of structure is fine for any AP prompt, so long as you don’t sound formulaic. You
probably learned this pattern (which may have been called “the five-paragraph essay”) in
elementary school. But you’re older now, and the graders want to see mature writing. Stay
away from “this is what I will prove,” “here’s the proof,” and “this is what I have proved.”
That kind of writing is B-O-R-I-N-G and will earn no more than a 3 or 4 on the AP exam. 
Don’t lock yourself into a five-paragraph structure just because you’re accustomed to it. Use
as many paragraphs as you need, and no more. If you have two subtopics, four paragraphs
(intro, body paragraph 1, body paragraph 2, conclusion) may be better. If you have four
subtopics, you need more than five paragraphs in your essay.
An inductive essay reverses the order of a deductive essay. In an inductive essay, you begin
with specifics and move to a general conclusion. Though this format may be unfamiliar, this
structure is very useful, especially for argument essays. Here’s the pattern:
 Introduction. In the introduction you explain the issue (perhaps a description of prom
night and the costs involved).
 Body. Here you discuss every aspect of the issue, one per paragraph. You may, for exam-
ple, have a paragraph on pre-prom events, one on transportation problems, and so forth.
 Conclusion. Now you take a stand and state your opinion: Proms should be subsidized,
abolished, simplified, whatever.
204
Part IV: That Is the Question: Multiple-Choice and Essay Strategy and Practice 

Think of the inductive essay as leading — inducing — your reader to a particular stance.
Make sure the path holds together logically, with no missing steps.
Compare-contrast
This structure’s a natural for paired-passage essays, but you can also use it when you argue
for a particular position. (In that case, you compare positions and decide which is better.)
A compare-contrast essay has these components:
 Introduction. Here you state what you’re comparing (Passage One and Passage Two
or Pro and Con positions). You may include the key differences and similarities, the
advantages and disadvantages, or an explanation of the two competing positions. 
 Body. You can organize the body paragraphs in a couple of ways. You may have one
paragraph addressing similarities and one addressing differences, or a paragraph
about each position on an issue. More complex, but very impressive, is a paragraph
about each aspect of the elements you’re comparing. For example, in a literary analysis
you may have a paragraph comparing diction in each of two passages, a paragraph
comparing point of view, and so forth. In an argument or synthesis essay, you may have
a paragraph about environmental problems, another about economics, another about
social consequences — or whatever makes sense for the topic.
 Conclusion. The conclusion often puts the comparison/contrast into a larger context.
Yes, we should abolish the penny, as a step toward an all-electronic monetary system.
Or no, we need the penny, because society tends to overlook small opportunities to
save, not just in money but in energy, time, and so forth. 
One danger of a compare-contrast essay is repetition. Don’t ping-pong your reader back and
forth, saying, for example, “In Passage One . . . while in Passage Two . . . ”  over and over again.
“Passage” order
Because you’re pressed for time on the AP exam (as I have mentioned a million times
already) you may opt for a fast organizational pattern when you’re analyzing a passage: the
order of the passage itself. With this structure, you simply work your way through the 
passage, discussing everything you encounter. Almost no organization is necessary, because
the author of the passage already did the job. Add an introduction (orienting the reader to
the title and author — if you know what and who it is — and stating the main points you’ll
discuss). Finish with a conclusion (a discussion of the last element in the passage or, if you
wish, with a “why this is significant” statement). Bingo: You’re organized!
A “passage order” essay can fall prey to repetition. The second or third time you discuss
point of view, for example, you may end up saying the same thing. Vary your comments as
much as possible by individualizing them. The more specific you are, the less likely you are
to repeat yourself. Also, be especially careful to note when an element of content or style
changes or progresses in the passage and to analyze how those questions relate to the
question you’re answering. Simply summarizing the passage is not enough. (For more on
analyzing, read “Analyzing your way to a high score” in the next section.)
Examining Each Type of Essay
The general techniques of essay-writing serve you well no matter which question you’re
facing. However, each of the three major types of AP essay (synthesis, argument, and analysis)
calls for a slight shift in approach. 
205
Chapter 16: Writing at Warp Speed: The Essay Section

Synthesizing a great essay
The AP test writers warn you not to summarize or report the sources provided for the syn-
thesis essay. If that’s all you do, expect to earn no more than 2 points out of a possible 9.
Instead, see the sources as raw material — like spools of thread. When you write a synthesis
essay, you select thread from three or more sources and weave them together so that they
form cloth. The cloth, in my analogy, represents your position on the issue. When you write a
synthesis essay, keep these points in mind:
 All the sources are potentially valid for the issue you’re discussing. Don’t discount any
right away; skim everything.
 The sources tend to balance out. A couple of sources clearly favor one side of the
issue, and others take the opposing view. A source may also be neutral; you can find
ammunition in it for either side.
 Although I referred to “either side” in the preceding bullet point, most issues aren’t
limited to a yes or no stance. The graders are looking for maturity, and a mature
thinker acknowledges complexity. If you believe that your answer is a qualified yes
or no, explain why. You’ll end up with a better essay!
 Once you’ve defined a position, reread the sources most likely to be helpful. Annotate
them more fully, if necessary. But don’t totally ignore sources that disagree with your
position. Sometimes the opposing argument stimulates your thought processes and
reveals additional reasons why your position is correct. 
 Include a concession-and-reply paragraph — or more than one paragraph, if warranted.
In “concession and reply,” you acknowledge opposing points and counter them with
your own argument. (You’ve probably used this technique when disputing something
with your own personal Authority Figures, as in “Yes, I know it’s a school night and
I have a test tomorrow. However, this movie will relax me and I’ll get a better grade.”) 
 Be sure that your argument progresses logically. The earlier section “Selecting a Sturdy
Structure for Your Essay” helps with this task.
The logic is easier to follow if you provide transitional words. “Also,” “on the other
hand,” “nevertheless,” “consequently,” and similar words help the reader navigate from
one paragraph to the next.
 The six or seven synthesis sources usually appear on six different pages of the ques-
tion booklet. Choose one spot to gather your thoughts after you’ve annotated the indi-
vidual sources. Flipping back and forth wastes time.
 No matter what, don’t neglect citations. The College Board changed the exam in 2007
partly because college professors wanted to emphasize the importance of citations.
Remember to cite the source for quotations, indirect references, and any ideas you
gathered from the source. 
How long should a synthesis essay be? About as long as the other two essays you have to
write — perhaps 500 words. Although you’re working from a lot of sources, you don’t neces-
sarily have to say more. Just use the material wisely. (For tips on interpreting visual sources,
see Chapter 8. For help with all kinds of source material, check out “Handling Evidence” ear-
lier in this chapter.)
Analyzing your way to a high score
The analysis essay asks you to pick apart a passage (or a pair of passages) and explain how
the writing style works hand-in-hand with content. The big no-no in this type of essay is a
laundry-list approach. It’s not enough simply to state what rhetorical techniques (or devices,
206
Part IV: That Is the Question: Multiple-Choice and Essay Strategy and Practice 

or strategies) appear in the passage. You have to explain what these techniques accomplish.
Guidelines for an analysis essay are as follows:
 The prompt sometimes specifies an element you should focus on: characterization,
purpose, setting, attitude, and the like. It’s surprisingly easy to lose that focus and
analyze everything. Resist the temptation! Graders aren’t pleased by essays that ignore
the prompt.
 If the prompt leaves the door open, haul out the wide net. Look for everything that’s
there. And once you think you have everything, look deeper (but quickly!). A couple of
obvious points appear in every essay, because . . . well, they’re obvious. But only a few
test takers find the subtleties. After reading 1,200 essays, the graders are very
impressed by a new idea. 
Remember that originality isn’t everything. Be sure that you don’t stretch too far in your
analysis. Everything you write must be supported with evidence from the passage.
 This type of essay is called “analysis” for good reason: You have to analyze, not just
report. The difference is huge. Say, for example, that you find a shift from first-person
to third-person point of view in the third paragraph. Why did the author make that
change? How does the change affect the reader? What’s gained or lost with the new
point of view? What happens to the content at that point in the story? Did the content
also change? These are the kinds of questions that you should ask yourself. The
answers constitute an analysis of style.
One way to determine the effect of a particular rhetorical device is to place the passage
in an alternate universe. If the writer has loaded you with imagery (sensory detail),
rewrite the passage (just in your head and at top speed, naturally). Without the imagery,
how does the reader react? Or, substitute another technique for the imagery, such as
figurative language. If you’re reading about wine that “tastes like old socks” instead of
wine “with a musky aroma,” do you change your opinion of the drink? Now you know
the effect of imagery in the original passage.
 An analysis essay calls for more quotations than other types of essays. Writing style
is best discussed when the actual writing is put under the microscope. 
One final idea about analysis essays: they too argue a case. You’re not discussing the merits
of civil disobedience or a national healthcare system, as you may be in an official “argument
essay.” Instead, you’re arguing that the author’s use of passive voice takes the spotlight away
from individuals and makes the ideas more universal or that the extended metaphor compar-
ing justice to the banking system emphasizes the financial suffering of ex-convicts. Even
though you’re discussing literature, you’re still proving a point.
Arguing for an A+ essay
My son is a lawyer, so he spends his days arguing (politely, of course). Every once in a while I
remind him that although he learned a lot in law school, his father and I taught him everything
he knows about argument. Now it’s your turn! When you’re writing an argument essay in
response to a quotation or to a situation described in the prompt, keep these points in mind:
 Not every argument divides neatly into two categories. Typically, the prompt for an
argument essay orders you to “develop a position” on a particular issue. Or, the
prompt asks you to react to a quotation that is itself an argument — a statement of
opinion. Your position may be totally in favor, totally against, or something in between.
 State your position clearly. You don’t have to do so in the introduction. (See “Selecting
a Sturdy Structure for Your Essay” earlier in this chapter for more information on how
to organize an argument essay.) However, by the time the grader has finished reading,
he or she should know where you stand and why you feel that way.
207
Chapter 16: Writing at Warp Speed: The Essay Section

 Acknowledge the opposing arguments and, if possible, provide the counter argu-
ments. This tactic is called concession and reply. Concession-and-reply paragraphs
accomplish two things. They tell the grader that you’ve considered the opposition’s
point of view, and they shore up your case by taking ammunition away from the other
side. A typical concession-and-reply statement resembles this one: “Curbs on hate-
speech may appear to violate the first amendment, which guarantees the right to free
speech. However, the first amendment has never been interpreted as giving complete
freedom. Words that inflame racial, ethnic, or gender bias may be as dangerous as reck-
lessly shouting ‘fire’ in a crowded movie theater.”
 In an argument essay, you’re allowed to write about personal experience or obser-
vation. (Finally, your life is relevant to the AP!) Give enough information to make your
point, but don’t get bogged down in trivia. If you’re talking about your friend’s bout
with cancer in an essay on national health coverage, her financial situation is relevant
but her suffering probably isn’t — sad though you might be about what she went
through. You can mention that fighting with the insurance company added to her woes,
but don’t spend two paragraphs describing her chemotherapy.
 References to literature and history are useful in an argument essay, as long as they
back up your point of view. Don’t hesitate to mention Antigone in an essay about civil
disobedience (she’s the title character in an ancient Greek drama who defies an unjust
law) or September 11 in an essay about terrorism.
Feel free to use a reference to literature or history even if you’re not 100 percent sure
of every detail. Of course you want to be accurate. But if you make a small mistake
(referring, for example, to Vice President Ronald Reagan), the graders won’t take off
any points. They know that you’d correct yourself and write President Ronald Reagan
in a final draft, after consulting a reference book.
 As you argue your viewpoint, pretend that the reader doesn’t agree with you. I imag-
ine a short, scrappy guy sitting on the side of my desk when I’m writing this kind of
piece. “Oh yeah?” he snarls from time to time. My intent is to stop that snarl and con-
vince him that I’m right. (Because he’s a figment of my imagination, I always succeed.)
Even though “fun” and “AP” don’t normally show up in the same sentence (except in one that
says the AP is no fun!), relax and enjoy yourself a little. Arguing can be a good way to release
tension!

n this chapter, rivers of ink flow from your pen, creating words that eventually turn into
an AP essay. Sounds like a lot of effort — but not for me. I’ve already done my work by
writing sample AP essay questions and formulating the accompanying answer-guides. Now
the job is yours, and you should take it, because practice makes (almost) perfect AP essays.
The free-response portion of the AP exam has only three questions, but the AP has more than
three sorts of prompts in its arsenal. In this chapter I’ve placed at least one of each of the
possible types of essay prompts (with an extra synthesis and analysis question for good
measure, since they will definitely appear on your test). No matter what they throw at you,
you’ll be prepared.
Writing and Scoring a Practice Essay
With AP exams, timing is an important factor. But you don’t have to hit full speed right away.
With the practice essays in this chapter, you can start off a little more slowly than you would
on a real AP test, perfecting your essay-writing technique before you try for AP-style speed-
writing. (For more on producing essays quickly, check out Chapter 16.) When you write the
essays on the practice exam (in Chapters 18 and 20), keeping within the time limit is essen-
tial. But for now, it’s okay to write just one essay at a time, allowing yourself a few additional
minutes.
Just to be clear about official timing: The College Board suggests that you devote about
40 minutes to each essay. However, the essay portion of the exam begins with a 15-minute
reading period, during which you can read and annotate all the questions. If you decide to
mimic test conditions while writing a practice essay from this chapter, give yourself a few
extra minutes (a total of 42–43 minutes) for single or paired-passage essays and 46–50 min-
utes for a synthesis essay. As on the real exam, write in blue or black ink on lined paper. If the
College Board has granted you accommodations, adjust the timing or writing method accord-
ingly. (For more information on special-needs accommodations, see Chapter 1.)
When the time comes to evaluate your essay, reread your work a couple of times. Your first
task is to rate your answer according to these general guidelines:
 Your essay should answer the question. Off-topic essays receive no points. 
 The prompt, or essay question, may contain more than one task, and your essay must
complete all the required tasks. For example, you may have to (1) determine the
author’s tone or purpose and (2) identify the author’s rhetorical devices or strategies
and (3) discuss how the rhetorical devices reveal or contribute to the tone or purpose. 

 The essay should assert a thesis, the main idea you are proving.
 The thesis should be supported by evidence, which may be quotations or references
to the text if a passage is supplied or, if the question is more general, references to your
experience or observation. 
 Evidence should be inserted smoothly into the essay. 
 In the synthesis essay, the source material should be cited properly. Be sure to cite
ideas you have taken from a source, not just direct quotations.
 The essay should be organized; the reader should be able to follow a thread of logic
from introduction to conclusion.
 The essay should display good grammar and spelling and a mature writing style.
Repetitive or overly general statements weaken your essay. If grammar and spelling
mistakes make your essay hard to read, the overall score can be no higher than 2.
(See Chapter 1 for more information on AP scoring.)
When you’ve finished the general evaluation, reread your work and compare the points you
made in your essay to the list of specifics following each essay question. In each list I’ve
placed more ideas than any test taker would ever have time to include. Don’t panic if you
have fewer; you can omit quite a few and still end up with a high-scoring essay. 
You may think of an idea that doesn’t appear on the list. Excellent! Give yourself credit, so
long as you can justify your assertions. 
How does your essay rate overall? Consider yourself in the “excellent” category if you fulfill
most of the general requirements and have included about three-quarters of the specific
points. You’re “good” if you drop to 50 percent of the general requirements and specific
points. Moving to “fair,” you have perhaps a third of the general requirements and a third of
the specific points. Below these numbers, you need to work on essay writing a bit more.
Cheer up! That’s what this chapter is for. And if you’re confused about any aspect of essay
writing, turn back to Chapter 16 for help.
Analysis of a Single Passage
One type of essay that nearly always appears in the free-response section of the AP exam
requires you to analyze the rhetorical techniques in a single passage. (The AP test makers
sometimes cough up a pair. See the next section in this chapter for help with twins.)
Usually a single-passage question involves a selection with a distinctive writing style. The
prompt settles on one element — the author’s purpose, attitude, point of view, or something
similar. You have to analyze the passage in terms of the selected element and the rhetorical
devices (also called “techniques” or “strategies”) that the author employs. Take a crack at
the sample questions in the following sections.
Prompt one for an analysis essay
The passage below is excerpted from a nineteenth-century history of two Native American
tribes, the Ottawa and the Chippewa. It was written by Andrew J. Blackbird, the son of an
Ottawa chief and an interpreter of Native American languages for the government representa-
tive to those tribes. Read the passage carefully. In a well-written essay, discuss how the
author’s purpose is revealed through the rhetorical devices he employs.

Part IV: That Is the Question: Multiple-Choice and Essay Strategy and Practice 

I have seen a number of writings by different men who attempted to give an account of
the Indians who formerly occupied the Straits of Mackinac and Mackinac Island (that
historic little island which stands at the entrance of the strait) also giving an account of
the Indians who lived and are yet living in Michigan, scattered through the counties of
Emmet, Cheboygan, Charlevoix, Antrim, Grand Traverse, and in the region of Thunder
Bay, on the west shore of Lake Huron. But I see no very correct account of the Ottawa
and Chippewa tribes of Indians, according to our knowledge of ourselves, past and pres-
ent. Many points are far from being credible. They are either misstated by persons who
were not versed in the traditions of these Indians, or exaggerated. An instance of this is
found in the history of the life of Pontiac (pronounced Bwon-diac), the Odjebwe (or
Chippewa) chief of St. Clair, the instigator of the massacre of the old fort on the Straits
of Mackinac, written by a noted historian. In his account of the massacre, he says there
was at this time no known surviving Ottawa Chief living on the south side of the Straits.
This point of the history is incorrect, as there were several Ottawa chiefs living on the
south side of the Straits at this particular time, who took no part in this massacre, but
took by force the few survivors of this great, disastrous catastrophe, and protected
them for a while and afterwards took them to Montreal, presenting them to the British
Government; at the same time praying that their brother Odjebwes should not be retali-
ated upon on account of their rash act against the British people, but that they might be
pardoned, as this terrible tragedy was committed through mistake, and through the evil
counsel of one of their leaders by the name of Bwondiac (known in history as Pontiac).
They told the British Government that their brother Odjebwes were few in number,
while the British were in great numbers and daily increasing from an unknown part of
the world across the ocean. They said, “Oh, my father, you are like the trees of the
forest, and if one of the forest trees should be wounded with a hatchet, in a few years
its wound will be entirely healed. Now, my father, compare with this: this is what my
brother Odjebwe did to some of your children on the Straits of Mackinac, whose sur-
vivors we now bring back and present to your arms. O my father, have mercy upon my
brothers and pardon them; for with your long arms and many, but a few strokes of retali-
ation would cause our brother to be entirely annihilated from the face of the earth!”
According to our understanding in our traditions, that was the time the British
Government made such extraordinary promises to the Ottawa tribe of Indians, at the
same time thanking them for their humane action upon those British remnants of the
massacre. She promised them that her long arms will perpetually extend around them
from generation to generation, or so long as there should be rolling sun. 
Answer guide for the first analysis essay
First, check your answer with the general guidelines at the beginning of the chapter. Now
take a peek at these bullet points, which describe some points you could have made in your
analysis of Blackbird’s work. 
 Blackbird’s purpose is probably to inform people who don’t know Native American his-
tory. He refers specifically to “persons who were not versed in the traditions of these
Indians” as making mistakes about the Ottawa tribe in their accounts of a massacre. He
criticizes a “noted historian” who erred in reporting that no known “surviving Ottawa
chief” lived on the “south side of the straits.” The implication here is twofold. Even
people who should know the truth (the “noted historian”) don’t. Also, no one looked
for or asked about the Native American point of view.
211
Chapter 17: Practice Essays

Did you read the prompt carefully? If so, you noticed that helpful information is tucked
into it. Andrew J. Blackbird is described as “the son of an Ottawa chief and an interpreter
of Native American languages for the government representative to those tribes.”
Knowing that Blackbird was Native American and worked for the government tells you
that the author straddled two worlds. (In the nineteenth century, more so than in the
present day, Native Americans were still fighting for their rights and full participation in
society.) Because you know that Blackbird saw two points of view, you can infer that he
wished to interpret one point of view (that of Native Americans) to those who may be
unfamiliar with it (non-Native Americans).
 You may express Blackbird’s purpose in any of several ways: He wishes to correct the
historical record. Or he wants the reader to understand that Native Americans (specifi-
cally, the Ottawa tribe) may be different from what the reader imagines. He wants to
validate the historical accounts of the Native Americans.
 By acknowledging the massacre, Blackbird partially allies himself with those who may
have sympathy for the victims. However, he also explains that some Native Americans
helped the survivors. The message here is “not every Native American acted the same
way or held the same beliefs.”
 The diction (word choice) helps Blackbird accomplish his purpose. He refers to “our
knowledge of ourselves” and “our understanding of our traditions.” The pronouns
“our” and “ourselves” emphasize his bond with Native Americans and establish his
frame of reference. He has inside knowledge. The strong terms Blackbird uses to
describe what happened (“great, disastrous catastrophe,” “rash act,” “evil” , and the
like) are an attempt to identify with those who condemn the massacre. (Even the term
“massacre” suits Blackbird’s purpose, as opposed to something more neutral such as
“conflict” or “fight.”
 The quotation at the end of the first paragraph employs a simile, comparing the British
to trees in a forest that will quickly repair any gaps after some trees are “wounded with
a hatchet.” (Notice the term “hatchet” — a word associated with Native Americans.)
The simile reinforces the idea that the Native Americans are vulnerable, as plants are
vulnerable. Blackbird, without using today’s terminology, is calling the tribe an endan-
gered species: “their brother Objebwes were few in number” and with retaliation could
be “entirely annihilated from the face of the earth!.”
 The quotation is not attributed. Blackbird is portraying himself as someone with inside
knowledge, not calling upon an outside expert. A few times he corrects the common
pronunciation of Native American names (Pontiac should be Bwon-diac), again empha-
sizing Blackbird’s knowledge and others’ ignorance.
 The long sentence in the middle of the first paragraph (“This point in history . . .
Pontiac” ) stands out. By throwing everything but the kitchen sink into that sentence,
which English teachers call a cumulative sentence, Blackbird forces the reader to com-
prehend all the ideas in the sentence at the same time. Yes, Native Americans massa-
cred British colonists, but Native Americans also saved lives.
 Did you notice the switch from “my father” (in the quotation from the Ottawa tribe)
to “she” in paragraph two? Both pronouns refer to Britain. The difference in pronouns
emphasizes the gulf between Native Americans and British custom. 
 The author states that “Indians . . . lived, and are yet living” in Michigan. The message
here is the same: Non-Native Americans may not know much, if anything, about Native
American life. The author’s the expert, the one who will correct misapprehensions.
You can structure this essay in a couple of ways. No matter what you choose, your introduc-
tion should define the author’s purpose. Then you can devote a paragraph to each rhetorical
device (one for diction, one for sentence length, one for figurative language, and so forth).
Another possibility is to work your way through the passage in order, from first sentence to
last, noting every rhetorical device you find. The first structure is more organized, but it
212
Part IV: That Is the Question: Multiple-Choice and Essay Strategy and Practice 

takes a couple of minutes to group your ideas into subtopics, and you don’t have much time.
The second structure is faster to execute, but you may end up repeating yourself (going back
to diction again and again, for instance). Whichever you choose, take care to explain how the
rhetorical devices interact with content. Simply summarizing the passage or listing the ele-
ments of style is not enough.
Prompt two for an analysis essay
This speech, delivered by Marc Antony to a hostile crowd of Romans, appears in Shakespeare’s
Julius Caesar just after the title character has been murdered. Marc Antony refers to Brutus,
one of the assassins. In a well-organized essay, analyze the rhetorical strategy Marc Antony
employs to win the support of the crowd.
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones:
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
If it were so, it was a grievous fault;
And grievously hath Caesar answer’d it.
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,
For Brutus is an honorable man;
So are they all, all honorable men,
Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
But Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honorable man.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome,
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honorable man.
You all did see that on the Lupercal
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And, sure, he is an honorable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
213
Chapter 17: Practice Essays

But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once, not without cause:
What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?
O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason! Bear with me;
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
And I must pause till it come back to me.
Answer guide for the second analysis essay
In this speech, good old Marc Antony (the Roman, not the singer) faces down the crowd and
gradually brings them over to the pro-Caesar (and pro-Marc Antony) side. Brutus, an honest
man despite his participation in murder, doesn’t have a clue when Antony asks to speak over
the body of Caesar. Brutus trusts Antony, and if you’ve read the play, you know that his trust
is misplaced. Even in this small portion of Antony’s speech you can see that Antony is a
master manipulator. Your essay has to explore Antony’s strategy. Here are some points you
might include in your essay:
 Antony’s first words are “Friends, Romans, and countrymen.” By identifying himself as
one of them, he creates a bond with his listeners.
 Antony begins by reassuring the crowd that he isn’t going to praise Caesar, just bury him.
Because the crowd is hostile (as you know from the introduction), this is a good ploy.
Once again, Antony becomes less of an opponent and more aligned with the crowd.
 Antony’s statement about burial is another great tactic. Every culture stresses proper
disposal of human remains. Who could argue with a man who simply wants to bury a
dead friend? 
 Did you notice a strange verb in this passage? Antony says of Caesar’s ambition, “If it
were so, it was a grievous fault.” The “were” is subjunctive. Don’t panic over the gram-
matical term (though I explain it in Chapter 7.) Even without English-teacher vocabu-
lary, you know that “If it were so” is a way of saying that “it is not so.” (Think of the old
song, “If I Were a Rich Man” sung in the Broadway musical by a character who is poor.)
So Antony is subtly reinforcing the idea that Caesar wasn’t ambitious, and therefore
his murder was unjustified. Furthermore, Antony hedges his bets. If the crowd still
believes in Caesar’s ambition, Caesar has already paid the price by losing his life (“And
grievously hath Caesar answer’d it” ). Antony implies that the crowd has no reason to
hate Caesar now — or to hate Marc Antony.
 Having established that he isn’t going to praise Caesar, Antony goes on to . . . praise
Caesar. But Antony hides his praise carefully. He says he’s going to let the good that
Caesar accomplished be “interred with [Caesar’s] bones.” By mentioning “good,” he
subtly reminds the crowd that Caesar actually did some good things. Then Antony gives
details: Caesar was Antony’s “friend, faithful and just” to Antony. Caesar “brought many
captives home to Rome” and the money spent to ransom them made money for the
Roman state — always a hit with taxpayers. “When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath
wept,” says Antony, appealing to the lower economic classes in the crowd and probably
the taxpayers who feel poor, even if they aren’t. These statements appeal to logic. 
 After Antony recites the list of Caesar’s good deeds, he reminds the crowd that they
“all did love him once, not without cause.” Here Antony appeals to emotion. Who wants
to be reminded that they’ve betrayed someone they loved?
214
Part IV: That Is the Question: Multiple-Choice and Essay Strategy and Practice 

 Interspersed throughout these lines is a refrain: “Brutus says he [Caesar] was ambi-
tious; / And Brutus is an honorable man.” As Antony goes on, it becomes harder and
harder to believe that Brutus is honorable or that Caesar was ambitious. Each point
Antony makes about Caesar — he was a faithful friend, he brought money to Rome,
he sympathized with the poor, and (the clincher) he turned down the crown three
times — weakens Brutus’s case. By the end, you can imagine Antony saying, “Brutus
is an honorable man,” in a sarcastic tone of voice. 
 “Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?” and “was this ambition?” asks Antony. A few lines
later he challenges the crowd: “What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?”
Antony doesn’t really expect an answer to these rhetorical questions, but he estab-
lishes a link to the listeners, who will respond to the questions internally.
 Antony employs apostrophe, addressing a personified quality (in this case, judgment).
He tells “judgment” that “thou art fled to brutish beasts, / And men have lost their
reason!” The point is strong: The crowd has much in common with animals (“brutish
beasts”) and must regain perspective.
 Antony’s final appeal is emotional. He’s crying and must cease speaking until he com-
poses himself. He asks the crowd to “[b]ear with me,” once more calling them to his
side and, implicitly, to oppose Brutus and the other murderers.
A good essay on this amazing speech doesn’t have to cover everything in the preceding
bullet points. If you have touched upon half of these ideas, you’re in good shape. The fastest
and easiest way to organize this essay is to take the passage line by line, explaining and quot-
ing as you go. You can also divide the essay by types of argument: appeal to reason, to emo-
tion, bonding with the crowd, and so forth.
Paired Passages
Paired passages show up on the AP English Language and Composition exam every couple
of years. A paired-passage question contains (what a shock!) a pair of passages, usually two
approaches to one topic by two different authors. You generally have to compare and con-
trast one element — tone, purpose, description, or something similar — in the pair.
Prompt
Read these passages carefully. In a well-written essay, discuss the rhetorical devices each
writer employs to describe scientific research. 
Note: Passage A is an excerpt from Scientific American: Inventions and Discoveries by Rodney
Carlisle (Wiley, 2004). Passage B is excerpted from The Big Splat, or How the Moon Came to
Be by Dana Mackenzie (Wiley, 2003). Both are reprinted with permission of John Wiley and
Sons, Inc.
Passage A
Great scientific discoveries are relatively rare. Believing that the universe was ordered
by law, reflecting the fact that many early scientists had legal and theological training as
well as training in natural philosophy, scientists reduced their findings to laws repre-
senting simple descriptions of how the universe operates. In a number of cases the laws
were named for the person who discovered them, giving credence to a kind of “great
man” view of science. In a few cases several scientists simultaneously came to nearly
215
Chapter 17: Practice Essays

identical formulations of the laws, often leading to bitter disputes over priority of
discovery. Such simultaneity served to demonstrate that scientific discovery was not
simply a matter of individual brilliance but also a consequence of a more general
process of scientific advance and progress. 
Such discoveries of the laws of nature represent a special class of work in which a clus-
ter of natural phenomena, long observed by the human race, is analyzed and reduced to
a group of immutable principles that are found to govern the phenomena. In many cases
the laws can be expressed in mathematical or algebraic fashion, reducing the complex-
ity of the world around us to a set of numerical constants and immutable relationships.
The fields of physics and celestial mechanics include Newton’s three laws of motion, the
law of gravity, Kepler’s laws of planetary orbits, Pascal’s principle, Boyle’s law, and the
four laws of thermodynamics, among others. In each of these cases, one or more natural
philosophers contemplated a long-observed phenomenon and deduced a mathematical
or mechanical principle at work, reducing it to a statement with universal application.
Passage B
But where others saw only a confusing pattern of light and dark spots, Galileo under-
stood that he was seeing a landscape. The Moon’s detail showed up most clearly in the
boundary region between the illuminated part of the Moon and the dark part. This divid-
ing line is called the terminator, and it is the place where, to a Moon-dweller, the Sun
would be seen setting or rising at any given moment. . . . Seen through the telescope, the
terminator visibly moves during the course of an evening, and the changes Galileo saw
in the patterns of light and dark confirmed his belief that the Moon had a rugged sur-
face. Some bright spots would light up even before the terminator reached them; these
spots would be illuminated on the side facing the Sun, and a dark shadow on the other
side would persist for a while after the terminator moved by. . . . For the most part,
Galileo’s first descriptions of the Moon show admirable restraint. He resisted the temp-
tation to give in to conjecture, and instead described exactly what he saw — not a
mountain, but a shadow that behaved in such–and-such a way, until the case was clear
and compelling that the shadow had to be a mountain. Galileo noticed, for example, that
the dark-colored regions of the Moon seemed to be lower than the lighter regions, based
on his observations of the terminator.
Answer guide for the paired-passage essay
Did these passages make you want to grab a test tube or a telescope? Well, wait a bit. First
you have to score your essay. Check your work against the general guidelines at the begin-
ning of this chapter. Then examine your work in light of these standards, which are tailored
to this prompt. The bullet points are more or less in descending order of importance. Your
essay should contain statements similar to those in the first couple of bullets. If you have
ideas from the last couple of bullets, you’ve come up with ideas many other test takers
probably missed — impressive to an AP grader!
 Your essay should state how scientific research is characterized in each passage and
discuss the rhetorical devices each author uses. Your essay should also relate content
(the characterization of scientific research) to writing style (the rhetorical devices). 
Simply listing the rhetorical devices is a major no-no on the AP. Your essay must show
how each rhetorical device contributes to the characterization of scientific research. 
216
Part IV: That Is the Question: Multiple-Choice and Essay Strategy and Practice 

 A thesis statement for this essay might be something like “Both passages characterize
scientific research as a process involving observation and the formulation of general
principles, but Passage B focuses on an individual scientist and Passage A take a more
general approach.” (Many variations are possible. For more information on thesis
statements, see Chapter 16.)
 The characterization of scientific research should be supported by evidence from the
text. According to Passage A, scientific discovery begins in observation that is then
turned into an abstract principle, or “law,” which is often named for the scientist who
formulated it. The laws are “simple descriptions of how the universe operates.”
Discovery is “relatively rare” and not only a result of “individual brilliance” but also
“a consequence of a more general process of scientific advance.” 
 Passage A is more abstract than Passage B. A couple of scientists are mentioned in
Passage A, but only in the context of the name of a particular law. Instead, Passage A
explains scientific discovery in general (“a cluster of natural phenomena, long
observed by the human race, is analyzed and reduced to a group of immutable princi-
ples that are found to govern the phenomena” ) and states that “the laws can be
expressed in mathematical or algebraic fashion.” 
 The use of passive voice in Passage A (“observed by,” “is analyzed and reduced,”
“are found” ) emphasizes the process, not the person conducting the process.
 In Passage B, the emphasis is on one scientist. The author employs the story of Galileo
as an example of the process of scientific research. The author describes what Galileo
saw (“patterns of light and dark,” “the terminator visibly moves,” “some bright spots
would light up even before the terminator reached them,” “a dark shadow on the other
side would persist for a while after the terminator moved by”). The author also states
what Galileo did — a particular man who “resisted the temptation to give in to conjec-
ture” and “described exactly what he saw” and didn’t come to a conclusion “until the
case was clear and compelling.” 
 The verbs in Passage B are in active voice: “Galileo understood,” “Galileo saw,” and
“Galileo noticed.” Active voice emphasizes the person performing the action.
 Passage A gives the impression that all scientists operate in more or less the same way.
It refers only to groups, as in “scientists reduced their findings.” Passage B contrasts
Galileo’s method of strict observation to something looser: “where others saw only a
confusing pattern of light and dark, Galileo understood. . .” and “For the most part,
Galileo’s first descriptions of the Moon show admirable restraint,” a statement imply-
ing that others did not show restraint.
 In Passage A, the second sentence begins with two qualifying statements (“Believing
that the universe was ordered by law” and “reflecting the fact . . . natural philosophy”).
These statements apply to “scientists,” who “reduced their findings to laws” governing
how the universe operates. The qualifying statements imply that scientists trained dif-
ferently would conduct their research differently as well.
 Passage B is more fanciful. The terminator is described from the point of view of a
“Moon-dweller.” This reach into figurative language mirrors the creativity of Galileo,
who leapt from “a confusing pattern of light and dark spots” to “a landscape.”
 Passage A has some repetitive statements. Personally, I’d edit them out, but I have to
admit that the repetition mirrors the idea that all scientific research proceeds in the
same way, no matter who conducts it.
 Passage B follows Galileo’s process of deduction, from observation to conclusion. The
reader is left to make the generalization about science — making the reader into a sci-
entist, because scientists deduce.
217
Chapter 17: Practice Essays

One more thing about your paired-passage essay: You should have roughly the same amount
of information about each passage. If your essay spends 400 words on Passage A and 12 on
Passage B, you’re tilting too much. 
You can organize this essay in any of several ways. One paragraph for A and one for B works.
Or you could say everything about content in one paragraph, plop in a paragraph on rhetori-
cal devices, and then another paragraph on the relationship between content and style.
Essay Based on a Quotation
Perhaps because the new synthesis essay gobbles up so many testing minutes just for reading
time, recent AP English Language and Composition exams have included an essay based on a
short quotation. You have to agree, disagree, or partially agree with the point made in the
quotation and then support your stance with evidence from literature, history, or personal
observation and experience — or some combination of these. 
Prompt
A philosopher once commented, “Wisdom is founded on memory; happiness on forgetful-
ness.” Drawing upon your reading, observation, and experience, consider this statement. In a
well-organized essay, argue your own viewpoint on the origin of wisdom and happiness. Be
sure to provide support for your stance.
Answer guide for a quotation-based essay
About a hundred billion possible answers to this question exist, so I can’t get too specific in
this section, as I have with other types of essay questions. You have to work a little harder
here to apply my comments to your own writing. 
If your English teacher or a trusted adult is willing to read your answer, go for it! You may not
get an official AP-style evaluation, but you will probably learn whether you have made a logi-
cal case and supported it adequately.
As you review your quotation-based essay, keep these points in mind:
 You don’t have to accept or reject the quotation. You can write a qualified response
such as “I agree that wisdom is founded on memory, but so is happiness.” Although
talk shows tend to promote the idea that every issue has two sides — and only two
sides — nuanced views exist. In fact, probably most of your opinions fall into the “yes,
but” or “no, although” category.
 Your answer should respond to both halves of the quotation. If you discuss only
wisdom and forget about happiness (or vice versa), you haven’t completed the assigned
task. The essay doesn’t have to divide 50-50. You may spend more time on wisdom and
then link happiness to that definition, perhaps explaining that true happiness, along
with wisdom, comes from weathering and remembering the tough times in life.
 The prompt asks you to “provide support for your stance.” They’re not talking about
orthopedic shoes here. They want you to reach into your brain and pull out examples
that support your ideas. Which area of your brain? Pretty much all of it. You may turn
to the reading you did for English class and discuss Oedipus’s hard-won wisdom at the
218
Part IV: That Is the Question: Multiple-Choice and Essay Strategy and Practice 

end of Sophocles’ play. You may look at a historical event (the rise of the Nazi party, for
instance) and explain how remembering that era guides and improves our decisions
now, making us wiser. Your own life or what you’ve witnessed in others’ lives is another
possible area to explore. You may write about a classmate whose family was thrust into
a difficult situation (bankruptcy, illness, and the like). Does remembering those days
confer wisdom? Or is something else needed?
 You can mix and match types of evidence. For example, you may decide to discuss a
work of literature and a personal experience.
 If you wish, you can base your opinion on only one example, though of course you
have to write more about that example than you would if you had chosen a couple of
supporting points.
 No matter how many examples you use, details matter. I’ve referred to Oedipus and the
Nazi era in preceding bullet points, but I haven’t given enough information to make a
strong case for my opinion — or any opinion! Whatever evidence you choose must be
presented fully, and that means details, details, and just for a change of pace, more
details.
 You’re writing an argument. As in real life, when you’re trying to convince the Parental
Unit to change your curfew or allowance or chore assignment, you have to take the
opposing view into account. The strongest argument includes an acknowledgment of
the objections that may arise and an answer to those objections. (For help with this
aspect of essay writing, turn to Chapter 16.)
An argument essay may be organized around the evidence, with one section for each sup-
porting example. Or, you may devote a few paragraphs to a discussion of wisdom and a few
to your ideas about happiness. Either way, the first paragraph should include the quotation
and your thesis statement, the compact expression of your point of view. (I explain how to
create a thesis statement in Chapter 16.)
An Opinion Piece
Although most of the AP exam is based on text (even if the text is an eight-word quotation, as
I explain in the preceding section), occasionally you’re asked to write about an idea that isn’t
stated in a passage or quotation. See what you can do with the sample question in the next
section.
Prompt
Some schools allow students to take whatever courses they wish, and some place a cap on
the number of AP and honors classes or the overall number of classes in which a student
may enroll. The first system gives more freedom and responsibility to the students (and their
parents, if parental consent to a course-load is required). However, such freedom may fuel
college-admission competition and result in overstressed and overworked students. The
second is based on the idea that educators know what constitutes a healthy workload. 
Write an essay supporting, criticizing, or qualifying the notion of regulating student sched-
ules. Support your opinion with well-reasoned arguments.

Answer guide for an opinion piece
This is a “should-lunch-be-mandatory” essay, the sort of piece that you might read in the 
op-ed section of your school paper. (My school’s Governing Council recently passed a bill
calling for all students to have a lunch period. Most students were against the idea when
they learned that they might not be able to get every class they wanted if lunch was factored
in!) What do you think? Your answer is your essay; it’s that simple. Okay, maybe not that
simple. You still have to support your ideas. Check out these guidelines:
 The graders will look for complexity here. A “power-to-the-people” essay that advocates
free choice, regardless of consequences, is unlikely to impress your reader. Neither is a
straight “grown-ups know best” essay. (The graders won’t believe you, I imagine.)
 The best approach to this essay considers the opposing point of view and credits that
view where it’s warranted. For example, pretend for a moment that you favor the
“great-grown-up-wisdom” point of view. (It’s a stretch, I know, but go for it.) What’s
good about the pro-freedom stance? Students will learn something about the time-space
continuum — that it can’t be tampered with — if they try to take too many courses.
Students will be responsible for their own hospital bills, if they overschedule or if they
OD on the illegal substances they ingest because they’ve underscheduled themselves.
All these ideas are valid. However, the benefits of adult wisdom outweigh everything.
 A variation on the preceding bullet point is concession and reply. This technique, which
I explain further in Chapter 16, acknowledges the opposition and refutes it. For exam-
ple, say that you’re for student freedom. But you know that some hyper-competitive
kids will sign up for eight AP courses and three minors and have zero downtime, lead-
ing to nervous breakdowns, heart attack, and death. Okay, state that fact. With total
freedom, some students may die. Then respond. For example, you may say that stu-
dents can handle freedom if they receive the proper training. Suggest that kids be
counseled by older, experienced students or alumni about the evils of an overpacked
schedule. Or propose that students be given one week to try out a schedule before
enrolling for real. The sleep deprivation will enable students to see the downside of
eight APs and three minors. Or say that students should be lectured on the perils of
giving up sleep (though if they’re like everyone I’ve ever taught, they’ll sleep through
the lecture). Whatever. Just counter the opposing point of view.
 Personal observation may be helpful here. Suppose you have a friend at a school
where students have no limits. What’s that like? Describe your friend’s day — dark-
circled eyes, penchant for falling asleep while texting, and so forth. On the other hand,
what was it like for you when you couldn’t take the elective of your dreams (ruining
your career in check-forgery or basket-heaving) because you were already over the
limit in your courseload. Either example or both, if used properly, can be great sup-
porting evidence in your essay.
The structure of this essay depends upon what you’re saying. Probably the easiest structure
begins with an introduction stating your opinion and some supporting points. Then the body
paragraphs tackle one supporting point each. The problem with this structure is that it’s
boring. You’ve written a thousand of these essays, and your grader has read ten thousand. To
perk things up, you might try a deductive structure, beginning with the small specific points
you want to make and leading up to a big finish: your opinion. You have to put a little more
thought into this kind of structure, but your product may be more interesting. If you’re on
the fence, try a back-and-forth structure: “It’s good because . . . on the other hand.” However,
with this approach you may sound like you’re doing the play-by-play on a table-tennis tour-
nament. If your reader likes table tennis, you’re home free. If he or she once got a sore neck
from watching one, you’re at a disadvantage.

The Synthesis Essay
A newbie (born in 2007), the synthesis essay requires you to check out six or seven sources,
which include at least one visual (a chart, photo, drawing, graph, table, or something similar).
You have to read them and develop a point of view. Then you synthesize — not summarize —
three of the sources into a coherent argument. Reading glasses on? Here you go.
Prompt for synthesis essay one: National service
Directions: The question below is based on the six sources which follow it. To answer this
question, you must synthesize information from these sources. Your essay must present a
clear argument supported by at least three of the sources. Do NOT merely summarize the
information or the point of view of the sources. 
Be sure to cite information, quotations, or ideas taken from these sources. You may cite them
as “Source A,” “Source B,” and so forth, or by the descriptions in parentheses.

The Question: At various times in its history, the United States has drafted young men into
military service. In recent years the draft has been replaced by a system of voluntary enlist-
ment. Many politicians and commentators have called for a mandatory national service
program — a year of service to the community or in the military — for young people, both
male and female. Mandatory national service has supporters and opponents. After reading
the following sources carefully, develop a position regarding mandatory national service.
Then write an essay in which you support your position with references to these sources.

In President Bush’s first State of the Union speech on January 29, he called for expand-
ing and improving AmeriCorps, our nation’s national service program, by recruiting
more than 200,000 new volunteers. He also promised to revitalize the Peace Corps by
doubling its membership over the next five years.
Many Americans in our post-September 11 world are looking for ways to contribute to
our national strength and build our sense of unity. I can think of no better way to instill
patriotism and appreciation for our national diversity than through these national serv-
ice programs. But the idea of national service for young adults between high school
graduation and college and careers has another, often overlooked, benefit: it helps to
reduce crime and violence.
As president and CEO of one of California’s largest health foundations, I have long been
concerned about and active in violence prevention efforts. Therefore, I think President
Bush’s proposal is a tremendous first step. But I think we should go further and con-
sider mandatory national service for all U.S. citizens when they reach 18 years of age.
This way we would build strong citizens and provide opportunities for improving lives,
which is the surest way to reduce crime.
222
Part IV: That Is the Question: Multiple-Choice and Essay Strategy and Practice 

In crime prevention we focus on “critical hours” and “critical years.” The critical hours
when most youth crimes occur are between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. We have made strides in
addressing this problem with after-school programs that keep kids involved and busy
before adult supervision arrives at home. Mandatory national service would address
the “critical years” problem, the after-school years between 18 and 24 when men and
women are more likely to be the victims or perpetrators of crimes than at any other
time in their lives.
These are the years when young adults often lose the support they had from schools,
after-school programs and the community. The Criminal Justice Statistics Center reports
that this age group suffers from and commits the most homicides by firearms. We owe it
to our young adults to keep them productive and safe from violence.
Today AmeriCorps engages more than 50,000 Americans in intensive, results-oriented
service each year. Jose Hernandez, of South Central Los Angeles, is a good example of
how it changes lives. Growing up, Jose attended the Bresee Foundation’s after-school
program where he participated in positive recreational, cultural and community activi-
ties. When Jose graduated from high school, he watched many young people in his
neighborhood turn to gangs and end up dead or in jail. Jose knew he wanted more and a
Bresee worker recommended AmeriCorps.
There, Jose served a year working at an after school program, learning community
building and communication skills. Today, three years after his AmeriCorps year, Jose is
an outreach worker in his community. Jose doesn’t know where he would have ended up
without AmeriCorps and credits the program for teaching him to help himself as he
learned how to help others.
Today’s economy makes the case for national service programs even stronger.
California’s Employment Development Department (EDD) reported that the unemploy-
ment rate for November 2001 was six percent, the highest unemployment rate in the
state since September 1998. For the 23 percent of California young adults without a high
school diploma and 44 percent who do not enter college immediately after high school,
this job market will make it more difficult for them to find meaningful employment.
Can you imagine if every youth in California could spend a year learning about themselves
and their communities and gaining job skills in the process? As Father Greg Boyle of Los
Angeles-based Homeboy Industries so eloquently puts it, “Nothing stops a bullet like a job.”
Some may question a mandatory national service for youth. Why not keep it voluntary?
Perhaps the answer lies in what people do not appear to be doing amid the brisk sales of
U.S. flags. Have we seen reports showing dramatic increases in voter registration or mili-
tary enlistments? I haven’t. I believe this is because many of our youth — who have
grown into today’s adults — have missed out on the experience of giving back to their
country. This may explain why many don’t feel any need to channel their patriotism into
volunteerism or make voting a life-long commitment.
I believe mandatory national service would provide a way for the youth of this nation to
give something back for the freedoms they enjoy and to work side-by-side with other young
Americans for a common national purpose. The result would be a better understanding of
the strength of our diversity and increased participation in the voting booth. For some, the
military may be an option, as it was for me; for others the ability to work in a nursing home,
recreation facility or day care center may be a life-altering experience. The benefits will
surely be safer, healthier and more civically engaged youth and adults.

Debating Mandatory National Service
Should national service, either military or civilian, be mandatory for 18-year-old
Americans? That is the question being debated by the University of Chicago economics
professor Gary Becker and his co-blogger, Richard Posner, who lectures at the
University of Chicago Law School. 
Posner kicks things off with a cost-benefit analysis of the case for universal national
service. As he sees it, such a program would generate significant costs: the “deadweight
costs” of the necessary taxes to finance such an ambitious program, and the inefficiency
costs that stem from reallocating “a year of a college graduate’s working life from after
college to before college, when he would be less productive.” In addition, “Universal
national service would also have peculiar effects on the distribution of income. The
unpaid national service workers would replace low-paid service workers, pushing many
of them into poverty.” 
These costs are somewhat mitigated by the potential for nurturing social solidarity
across class lines. But Posner seems skeptical. Even if the actual motive for mandatory
service is to “take rich kids down a peg by forcing them to work for a year with minimal
compensation,” he finds scant evidence that a year spent working without pay would
make one more sympathetic toward issues of distributive justice.
Becker is more emphatic: “compulsory service is a bad policy” with all the characteris-
tics of a “very bad tax.”
Ilya Somin takes a different tack in a post at the Volokh Conspiracy. Granting that Becker-
Posner do a good job attacking such a policy on economic grounds, Somin, a professor of
law at George Mason University, objects on moral grounds: It is forced labor. “Even in the
unlikely event that mandatory national service could be shown to provide benefits that
outweigh its costs, it would still be morally repulsive,” Somin writes. “Short of outright
slavery or the murder of innocent people, it is hard to think of anything that violates indi-
vidual liberty more clearly than forced labor.”

I have become convinced that the U.S. — like most industrialized nations — should
enact a mandatory system of national service. But we should go much further than the
draft ever did and even further than the systems widely used elsewhere in the world.
Such a system should be mandatory, not voluntary. It should be broad, not narrow, with
exceptions based on inability rather than personal inconvenience. (Exceptions for
prison inmates, for example, but definitely not for the college-bound or well-heeled). It
should involve women as well as men, in stark contrast to our draft and the male-only
service plans of most other countries. Eventually, it should ask something of all
Americans, just as the jury system (at least in theory) does now.
225
Chapter 17: Practice Essays

Obviously, national service would be costly and raises a host of practical and logistical
problems. For example, given that between 3 and 4 million Americans turn 18 each year,
a full-fledged program might easily cost $50 billion a year, including living expenses,
supervisory costs, and G.I. Bill-style benefits for additional education and training.
Participants would have to be properly trained and supervised. They would need to do
real jobs, not make-work. Serious problems with discipline, drug and alcohol abuse,
criminal behavior, and shoddy work would be inevitable. It would require the kind of
well-planned, efficient government organization that most Americans consider highly
doubtful if not impossible.
Considerable obstacles, to be sure. But we’ve risen to considerable organizational chal-
lenges before, from World War II and the sixties’ space program to the recent flooding
in the Midwest. And consider the costs, tangible and intangible, of not having such a
system.
For starters, today’s military budget is higher than it would be if highly compensated,
career-track men and women were a substantially smaller backbone of our armed ser-
vices than they are today. Personnel costs — which account for a far greater share of
Pentagon spending than all our low-tech and high-tech weapons and missiles put
together — would be billions lower. So would retirement costs, which now run more
than $11.8 billion a year.
Given current military manpower needs, only about 10 percent of the 18-to-21-year-old
population would be needed in uniform. What to do with the rest?
Just think about five areas — education; public safety; health care; the rural environ-
ment; the urban environment. Now think of all the work that isn’t getting done — and
the tremendous price we’re paying for that.
The nation’s infrastructure is in shambles, requiring trillions of dollars for repair and
costing billions each year in lost economic opportunities. Crime and gang activity
increase as our police have far too little presence in our communities. Educational
achievement falls and drop-outs increase as classes get bigger and bigger, students
bring more serious problems into the classroom, and teachers feel overwhelmed. Health
care costs skyrocket, in part because we lack even the most rudimentary ability to pro-
vide simple, prevention-based care. Young parents go on or stay on welfare because
basic child care is unavailable, too expensive, too low in quality, or all three.
Just one example: It’s been estimated that as many as 300,000 Americans now in nursing
homes — and half of the nation’s nursing home costs are financed through Medicaid —
could be served in normal community settings if they had someone to assist them in
their daily routines.
Community service helps not just the receiver, but the giver. Many of our young people
succumb to too-early parenthood, to drug and alcohol abuse, to gangs and violence.
National service obviously won’t be a panacea. But it can communicate a powerful mes-
sage that often isn’t received by our younger citizens — that you can make a difference.
You matter. Society values your contribution. The self-esteem that’s built from tutoring a
younger child, cleaning up a park, or talking a peer out of self-destructive behavior can
be a powerful antidote to the devastating — and expensive — trends now so prevalent
in our society.
Finally, consider the less tangible but staggering costs to our society and its democratic
underpinnings as our citizens become increasingly divided and isolated from each other,
not just along racial lines but class lines as well. Consider, too, the widespread ethos
that encourages people to think of government as merely a broker among interest
groups — with the loudest and best-organized holding sway — and “citizenship” as a
collection of rights but not responsibilities.

Casnocha, Ben. “Mandatory National Service.” Marketplace. Minnesota National Public Radio.
Transcript of broadcast. (Copyright Ben Casnocha 2008: http://ben.casnocha.com)
KAI RYSSDAL: It’s been a while since Congress and the White House have seriously con-
sidered a military draft, but there is a growing movement in favor of a national service
program of some kind. Younger Americans would give a year of their life to serve the
country, maybe in the military, or maybe in a community service or education corps.
The most enthusiastic advocates want any such program to be mandatory.
Commentator, college freshman, and potential national service draftee Ben Casnocha
says they’re sending a mixed message.
BEN CASNOCHA: Listen carefully to those who hail the benefits of national service pro-
grams. “It’ll improve civic engagement, build national unity, instill duty and honor in
America’s youth.” Isn’t it strange how the conversation is always about the benefits to us?
A few years ago, a Washington University report noted that nobody has really studied
how broad service programs affect those actually being served. It suggests that in some
cases the local communities in which we are volunteering may be hurt more than
helped. How so?
Say an Uncle Sam-sponsored American comes along and offers to rebuild a dilapidated
home in a poor area for free. What rational homeowner would say no? The community’s
happy, and the subsidized volunteer feels good about himself, but what about the local
builder who was charging market rate for the service? Sorry, he’s out of a job. Temporary
streams of volunteers can disrupt local labor markets over the long haul. One study of
AmeriCorps, for example, suggests the positive impact may be only short-term.
Now national service is just a sliver of the total volunteer pie. Americans volunteered
over three billion hours last year. The vast majority of these people did so without an
order from the government. They worked with private non-profits. Since they choose to
volunteer for a specific local cause, these people are better able to create a long-term
positive impact on the folks they serve.
Nevertheless, John McCain and others want to nationalize volunteerism. There’s an
effort underway to pump up the social pressure. Advocates want to offer various finan-
cial incentives for kids to serve “voluntarily” for the United States. McCain talks about
increased “patriotism” and “serving one’s country.” So wait. Is McCain’s plan a national-
istic morale building exercise? Are the benefits intended to flow primarily toward the
servers or the served? Now what’s the point of an expensive government program that
doesn’t quite know whom it’s trying to help? Let’s stick with local, community-organized
service programs, and make sure those in need come first, and those who offer the ser-
vices are contributing of their own volition.

are everywhere. The poster’s popularity is a good point to make. Americans know that
their country needs them, but not everyone volunteers to serve “Uncle Sam.” Perhaps
a law is needed to drive home the point. Or, arguing the opposite position, you can say
that the poster is frequently reproduced because Americans are aware of the value of
service to the nation and their communities and will volunteer when their life circum-
stances permit them to do so.
 Source B takes a pro-mandatory service stance, characterizing national service as a
violence-prevention measure. You can use the story of “Jose” to illustrate the benefit of
service and quote Father Boyle (“Nothing stops a bullet like a job”) to drive home the
point. The statistics on unemployment are also useful for a pro-mandatory service
essay. Yates’ comments on “giving back to their country” go well with Source A (the
poster of Uncle Sam) and can be used for both pro and con positions, because you can
always argue that people serve their country voluntarily also. 
 Source C, the chart, provides ammunition for several positions. If you’re advocating for
voluntary, not mandatory service, you can cite the high rate of volunteerism. More than
a quarter of all Americans volunteer at any given time. Of course, you can spin that
number the other way too; nearly three-fourths of Americans don’t volunteer. Because
mandatory national service is likely to affect mostly young people, you may zero in on
the percentages for 16- to 24-year-olds. As those numbers are lower than the percent-
ages for older groups, you can tuck this statistic into an essay arguing that young
people are not as involved in national life as they should be and thus need a stronger
motive (avoiding jail!) to volunteer. However, because the percentage rises with age, up
to the 35 – 44 slot, you can make a good case for choice. Young people may not volun-
teer in large numbers, but they will volunteer as their life circumstances permit. 
 In Source C the data on educational level also support both positions, depending upon
how you look at the numbers. People with more education usually earn more, so they
can afford to take the time to volunteer. In a “con” essay, you can suggest that increas-
ing support for community-service organizations will allow them to pay all volunteers
a living wage (which only some volunteer organizations are able to do at present).
Without financial pressure, more young people may choose to volunteer. In a “pro”
essay, you can make the point that mandatory service will lead to a more tolerant soci-
ety. Everyone of a certain age will have to commit to helping the community, so rich
and poor and people from diverse backgrounds will have to work together and get to
know each other better.
 Another useful statistic from Source C is that part-time workers volunteer the most. In
a pro-mandatory service essay, you can use this fact to back up the idea that people
want to help out; they don’t always have the time. 
 Source D is a gold mine if you’re arguing against mandatory service because it contains
a bunch of quotations to back up your case. For example, you can quote Ilya Somin’s
view that mandatory national service is “morally repulsive” and the worst policy
“[s]hort of outright slavery or the murder of innocent people.” You can also mention
that University of Chicago economics professors see mandatory service as generating
more expenses and inefficiency than benefits to society, though the source doesn’t
contain the supporting statistics that these experts undoubtedly compiled.
 Source E, which favors mandatory service, lists the many areas where labor is needed.
The source has a great paragraph of concession and reply (acknowledgment and rebut-
tal of the opposing argument): Yes, mandatory service will be expensive and difficult
to administer. However, the benefits far outweigh the problems. Use this source for
arguments against mandatory service (paragraph three) or use (and cite!) Keisling’s
answers to these arguments as stated in paragraph four. The last two paragraphs are
great for pro-mandatory essays, as they explain how the giver as well as the commu-
nity benefits.
228
Part IV: That Is the Question: Multiple-Choice and Essay Strategy and Practice 

 Ben Casnocha’s commentary in Source F makes a strong case against mandatory ser-
vice. He points out that the benefits may be larger for the volunteer than for the com-
munity. His remarks are short on statistics but long on quotations, such as “Let’s stick
with local, community-organized service programs, and make sure those in need come
first. . . .”
In a synthesis essay it is crucial that your essay take an identifiable point of view, so be sure
that you have a thesis statement in your introductory paragraph. (Confused about thesis
statements? See Chapter 16.) 
Your opinion doesn’t have to fall neatly into one category, either pro or con. You might argue,
for example, that incentives should be created to entice more people to voluntary national
service and legislation enacted only if these measures fail. Whatever your view, be sure the
thesis statement communicates what you believe.
Organizing a synthesis essay is challenging because you have a lot of information. After an intro-
duction containing your thesis statement and perhaps something to draw the reader’s attention
(a quotation or an interesting statistic, perhaps), you might devote one paragraph to each
reason why national service should be mandatory (or not, if that’s your position). Another pos-
sible structure for this essay is to begin by describing the situation — civic work left undone or
people in need — and then move to your solution (volunteerism or mandatory service).
Taking information or ideas from a source without giving proper credit is the equivalent of
“murder in the first degree” in the academic world. You must include citations for all quota-
tions, statistics, and arguments that you’ve gleaned from these six sources. (For more infor-
mation on citing sources, check out Chapter 13.)

The Question: What is the purpose of art? To serve as a vehicle of self-expression, to create
social or political change, or something else entirely? Artists and critics, as well as the gen-
eral public, have answered this question in diverse and conflicting ways. Develop a position
about the purpose of art, drawing upon these sources for support.

Mondrian, Piet. “Plastic Art & Pure Plastic Art.” Circle, 1937
Although Art is fundamentally everywhere and always the same, nevertheless two main
human inclinations, diametrically opposed to each other, appear in its many and varied
expressions. One aims at the direct creation of universal beauty, the other at the
esthetic expression of oneself, in other words, of that which one thinks and experiences.
The first aims at representing reality objectively, the second subjectively. Thus we see in
every work of figurative art the desire, objectively to represent beauty, solely through
form and color, in mutually balanced relations, and, at the same time, an attempt to
express that which these forms, colors, and relations arouse in us.
Source C
Unpublished remarks of Don Yates, art historian
What is art? “It’s art because I say it is,” according to Robert Rauschenberg. In the end,
though, a society gets the art that it needs, and you can’t judge the art of one society by
the standards of another or judge the art of one particular era by the standards of the
same society at a different point in its history. Some moments in history call for political
art; others do not. The creation of art can’t help being contingent upon the society in
which it’s created.

However, art is always made in a political context, whether the issue of politics is
avoided by the artist or not. Look at Pollock and the modernists. It’s almost as though
the politicization of society in the Cold War made artists bury politics, if they had a
political message. In recent years art has become more overtly political, especially if
you consider criticism of society as a political act. Think of Jenny Holzer and Barbara
Kruger, both openly critical of society. With the emergence of the modern feminist
movement and the gay-rights movement, you see strong political statements made
through art.

Witcombe, Christopher L.C.E. “Art for Art’s Sake.” witcombe.sbc.edu/modernism/
artsake.html
Generally speaking, progressive modernism tended to concern itself with political and
social issues, addressing aspects of contemporary society, especially in its poorer ranks,
that an increasingly complacent middle class, once they had achieved a satisfactory
level of comfort for themselves, preferred to ignore. 
Through their art, in pictures that showed directly or indirectly the plight of the peas-
ants, the exploitation of the poor, prostitution, and so on, the progressives repeatedly
drew attention to the political and social ills of contemporary society, conditions they
felt needed to be addressed and corrected. 
Fundamentally, the intention was to educate the public, to keep alive in the face of con-
servative forces the Enlightenment ideals of freedom and equality through which the
world would be made a better place. 
The position taken by progressive modernism came to be referred to as the avant-garde
(a military term meaning “advance-guard”). In contrast to the conservative modernists
who looked to the past and tradition, the avant-garde artist consciously rejected
tradition. 
Rather than existing as the most recent manifestation of a tradition stretching back
into the past, the avant-garde artist saw him- or herself as standing at the head of a new
tradition stretching, hopefully, into the future. The progressive modernist looked to the
future while the conservative modernist looked to the past. 
The rejection of the past became imperative for the progressives with the advent of the
First World War, which signalled for them the catastrophic failure of tradition. The sense-
less carnage of the “Great War” starkly showed that modernism’s faith in scientific and
technological progress as the path to a better world was misdirected. For the Dadaists,
World War One also signalled the failure of all modernist art. It could be claimed that Dada
in fact marks the emergence of a post-modernist cast of mind. 
Today, we would characterize progressive modernism, the avant-garde, as left-leaning
and liberal in its support of freedom of expression and demands of equality. Since the
18th century, the modernist belief in the freedom of expression has manifested itself in
art through claims to freedom of choice in subject matter and to freedom of choice in
style (i.e. in the choice of brushstroke and colour). It was in the exercise of these rights
that the artist constantly drew attention to the goals of progressive modernism. 
As the 19th century progressed, the exercise of artistic freedom became fundamental to
progressive modernism. Artists began to seek freedom not just from the rules of aca-
demic art, but from the demands of the public. Soon it was claimed that art should be
produced not for the public’s sake, but for art’s sake. 
231
Chapter 17: Practice Essays

Art for Art’s Sake is basically a call for release from the tyranny of meaning and purpose.
From a progressive modernist’s point of view, it was a further exercise of freedom. It was
also a ploy, another deliberate affront to bourgeois sensibility which demanded art with
meaning.

Advertisement for Glenda Dicker/sun’s African American Theater (Wiley-Blackwell, 2008;
reprinted with permission from John Wiley and Sons, Inc.)
Written in a clear, accessible, storytelling style, African American Theater will shine a
bright new light on the culture which has historically nurtured and inspired Black
Theater. Functioning as an interactive guide for students and teachers, African American
Theater takes the reader on a journey to discover how social realities impacted the
plays dramatists wrote and produced. 
The journey begins in 1850 when most African people were enslaved in America. Along
the way, cultural milestones such as Reconstruction, the Harlem Renaissance and the
Black Freedom Movement are explored. The journey concludes with a discussion of how
the past still plays out in the works of contemporary playwrights like August Wilson and
Suzan-Lori Parks. 
African American Theater moves unsung heroes like Robert Abbott and Jo Ann Gibson
Robinson to the foreground, but does not neglect the race giants. For actors looking for
material to perform, the book offers exercises to create new monologues and scenes.
Rich with myths, history and first person accounts by ordinary people telling their
extraordinary stories, African American Theater will entertain while it educates.

Quotation from Pablo Picasso, artist
What do you think an artist is? An imbecile who only has eyes if he is a painter, or ears if
he’s a musician, or a lyre at every level of his heart if he’s a poet, or even, if he’s a boxer,
just his muscle? On the contrary, he is at the same time a political being, constantly
alive to heart-rending, fiery or happy events to which he responds in every way. . . paint-
ing is not done to decorate apartments. It’s an instrument of war for attack and defense
against the enemy.
Answer guide for synthesis essay two: Art
One picture is worth a thousand words, goes the old saying, but in my experience, pictures
tend to be accompanied by quite a lot of text, some of which you see here. These artists, edi-
tors, critics, and art-history professors have weighed in on an important topic: the purpose
of art. Should it change the world, or just allow the artist to express him- or herself? I have
my own opinion, but I’m not important here. The focus is on you — specifically, how well you
develop and express your own position on the purpose of art. About a million variations are
possible, but it seems likely that your thesis falls roughly into one of these categories:
 Art is self-expression. All those unique feelings and ideas inside need an outlet, and art
provides one.
 Art changes the world. To the barricades! Down with — well, you fill in that blank.
This definition sees art as a political act.
232
Part IV: That Is the Question: Multiple-Choice and Essay Strategy and Practice 

 Art is beauty. It doesn’t have to be pretty, but if it’s art, how it looks or sounds or
reads matters.
 Art has several purposes. In that case your thesis should state that art can’t be
pigeon-holed. “Some art is political, and other art is personal” or a similar statement
works for this “combo plan” definition. 
Because I don’t know what you think, I can’t comment on which of these sources you should
have used, and in what way, to support your stance on the purpose of art. Instead, I’ll com-
ment on each source and what you might extract from it.
 Source A may support either the “Art is self-expression,” the “Art is beauty,” or even a
political view of art. The photo of the hands of an elderly woman peeling oranges is beau-
tiful, though it doesn’t fit the usual Hollywood airbrushed vision of good looks. Notice
the work-roughened hands and the two bowls, one containing (literally) the fruits of this
woman’s labor — the oranges. This photo dignifies work done with one’s hands —
something that society often sees as less valuable than work performed at a desk.
 Source B comes from painter Piet Mondrian, whose beautiful, multicolored grids with
seemingly random squares of color have always delighted me. I often visit Mondrian’s
“Broadway Boogie Woogie” at the Museum of Modern Art. Back to the question:
Mondrian stresses both esthetics — the creation of beauty through art — and self-
expression. Your essay, if it’s in the “art is beauty” camp, would benefit from a few
words from Mondrian. You can include this quotation, for example: “One [inclination of
an artist] aims at the direct creation of universal beauty.” If you’re pulling for the self-
expression team, you can quote Mondrian’s view that another inclination of the artist
is the “esthetic expression of oneself . . . that which one thinks and experiences.”
Mondrian’s comments work for two views of art, but if you choose to quote him, be sure
that you don’t misrepresent his comments. He doesn’t divide artists into two separate
camps but instead speaks of two “inclinations” that coexist. Yes, you can see the “direct
creation of universal beauty” in art, but Mondrian also says that “at the same time,
an attempt to express that which these forms, colors, and relations arouse in us” — in
other words, one’s reaction to art — is present.
 Source C is short, but it packs a punch. If your thesis is that all art is political, you find
support here because Yates says that artists respond to the time in which they live,
even if they do so by suppressing all political content. So too can you find support if
you take the position that suppressed political content is not political at all, just a
response to a social climate. Further support for the nonpolitical stance is the first
painter Yates refers to — Jackson Pollock — who picked up the title “Jack the Dripper”
because of his large-scale paintings that resemble a tangle of paint drips. I’m not put-
ting these paintings down; they’re quite beautiful. However, because they don’t depict
anything recognizable, you can easily include them in your essay as an example of
totally nonpolitical art. Yates’ references to the feminist and gay-rights movement
support an “art-politics” connection.
 Source D comes from an essay explaining modernism, an artistic movement. The author
contrasts the early years of “progressive modernism,” which addressed “political and
social issues” ignored by a “complacent middle class,” with a later stage of modernism,
which advocated “art is for art’s sake” — freedom from what the author calls “the
tyranny of meaning and purpose.” Later-day modernism rejected the middle-class
demand that art “instruct, or delight, or . . . moralize.” How can you use this source?
Well, if your stance is that “art for art’s sake,” you can refer to the progressive mod-
ernists’ ideas about this subject (citing the essay, of course). You can, in a different
essay, describe the earlier political or social stance of modernists. However, take care
not to misrepresent the source. Witcombe’s essay explains an evolution of ideas. If you
use this source, acknowledge both viewpoints and then focus on their relationship to
your own position.
233
Chapter 17: Practice Essays

 Source E, the advertisement for a fine book about African American theater, reveals the
intersection of art and a cause — in this case, social justice. The ad stresses that the
plays reflect the “culture which has historically nurtured and inspired Black Theater.”
Like art historian Don Yates, whose comments are found in Source C, this advertise-
ment stresses that art is a product of a particular moment in time and of a specific cul-
ture. The ad states that the text discusses “how social realities impacted the plays.”
Once you’re in the territory of “social reality,” you’re only a tiny step away from social
protest or commentary.
 Picasso, the towering figure of twentieth-century art, sees art as “an instrument of war
for attack and defense against the enemy.” Okay, not much material for the “art as
personal expression” or “art as beauty” camps! His words powerfully support the art-
politics link.
How can you organize all this information? Begin with an introduction defining your own
ideas about art. Pick and choose quotations from these sources that back up your position.
Divide the body paragraphs of your essay by ideas. For example, suppose you have an essay
asserting that art is political, even if it is beautiful and appears to arise only from a need to
express oneself. You might have a paragraph about overtly political art (Source F or Source E)
and one about seemingly nonpolitical art (Source B) that nevertheless changes the way the
viewer looks at reality. Then you have a paragraph about how a change in one’s ideas always
results in some sort of political effect. Many other variations are possible, of course. Just be
sure that you don’t simply summarize each source. You have to employ the ideas to bolster
your case.
This point is so important that I don’t mind repeating myself. You must cite ideas taken from
these sources, even if you changed the wording, a process known as paraphrasing. Unless it’s
your own brainchild, you need to acknowledge the parent — the source.

Road-Testing Your AP English Skills:
Practice Exam One
In This Chapter
 Getting used to exam conditions
 Taking a complete AP English Language and Composition test
B
efore you plunk down your life savings to buy a car, chances are you’ll want to take the
vehicle for a road test. After all, you can’t know how it handles three-point turns and
the tricky maneuvers of parallel parking until you slip into the driver’s seat. So too with the
AP exam. No matter how much you read beforehand or how many practice sections you do,
you can’t match the experience of road-testing a complete exam, especially one taken under
simulated test-conditions. When you staple yourself to a chair for this chapter, you experi-
ence the time constraints of the actual exam, gauge your speed on the multiple-choice and
essay sections, and — after you check your answers in Chapter 19 — pinpoint areas for
improvement. With all these advantages in mind, take a deep breath and strap yourself in
for practice exam one.
Gearing Up to Take the Exam
Before you start, follow this route to AP Testland. Remember, the point is to mimic the
actual exam: 
1. Isolate yourself. 
Give every available cell phone to your dog Rover and then send him to the yard. Turn
off the television, the radio, the MP3 player, your little sister, and anything else that
makes noise. Inform whoever is likely to knock on the door (cookie seller, long-lost
evil twin, parole officer) that you are busy and that interruptions are not okay.
2. Dig up a clock or a timer and put it where you can see it without twisting around in
your seat; then set the timer for one hour, the time allotted for the multiple-choice
section. 
If you don’t have a timer, write the start and end time on a piece of paper and tape the
paper to the side of the desk. When you’re battling a tough question, you don’t want to
wonder how much time is left.
3. Tear out the multiple-choice answer sheet and use it as you complete the multiple-
choice portion of the test. 
Even though you’ll be scoring the essay by hand, grab a number 2 pencil and indicate
your answers by darkening the ovals that correspond to your choices. The idea is to
mimic exam conditions, so you get that comfortable “I’ve been here before” feeling on
test day. If you finish before the hour is up, recheck any questions that challenged you.

4. Give yourself a fifteen-minute break after the multiple-choice section. 
Get up and stretch. Sip some water or visit the bathroom. But don’t even think about
looking at the essay section, and don’t check or change any answers from the multiple-
choice section.
5. When your break is over, turn to the essay portion of the test. Have plenty of loose-
leaf paper handy — at least three pages for each essay. 
6. Reset the timer (or check the clock and note a fifteen-minute interval) and turn to
the essay questions; read and annotate as much as you wish. 
Don’t write anything on the answer sheet during this reading period.
7. When the reading period is finished, set the timer for two hours, the time allotted
for you to write your three essays, and start writing!
And everyone says the AP is no fun . . ..
After you write your essays, you can take a much-deserved rest. Feel free to play
hockey, call a friend, or hit the mall. You may even do some homework, if your brain
isn’t completely fried.
8. Evaluate how well you did.
To determine how well you did, check your answers (you can find the answers and
explanations in Chapter 19) and then convert your raw score into an AP grade, using
the formula at the end of that chapter. 
Now’s the time to put your work under a microscope. Don’t just consider the final
score. Take a close look at the answers you got wrong. See if you can figure out what
types of questions trip you up (inference, vocabulary, tone, terminology, prom dates. . .
just kidding about the last one). Then go back to Part II for a review of the basics or to
Part III for extra practice in your problem areas. If timing was an issue, read Chapter 2
for tips on streamlining your test approach.
When you’re actually taking the AP, you have to do the whole test in one morning or
afternoon — a real challenge to your powers of concentration. Resist the temptation to
chop the practice test into smaller units — multiple-choice after school one day, essays on
Friday night (killing your social life and your AP preparation in one economical stroke), and
so forth. Simulated tests work best when they actually resemble the real exam. So resign
yourself to 3:15 hours of testing (plus one fifteen-minute break). 
The AP Language and Composition Test
This test consists of two parts:
Section One: Multiple choice – one hour
Section Two: Essays – fifteen-minute reading period plus two hours for writing
At any time you may write in the margins of the exam, annotating as you wish. However,
nothing but the scoring grid and the essay answer sheets will be graded. Answers or remarks
written next to the question receive no credit. During the fifteen-minute reading period, you
may not write on the answer sheet.

Questions 1 – 10 are based on the following passage, which is an excerpt from Franklin
Roosevelt’s First Inaugural Address. Roosevelt took office during the Great Depression, when
banks failed and millions were unemployed.
This is a day of national consecration, and I am certain that on this day my fellow Americans
expect that on my induction into the Presidency I will address them with a candor and a deci-
sion which the present situation of our people impels. This is preeminently the time to speak
the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. Nor need we shrink from honestly facing condi-
tions in our country today. This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and
will prosper. So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is
fear itself — nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to con-
vert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and
of vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is
essential to victory. And I am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in
these critical days.
In such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common difficulties. They concern,
thank God, only material things. Values have shrunk to fantastic levels; taxes have risen; our
ability to pay has fallen; government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of income;
the means of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade; the withered leaves of industrial
enterprise lie on every side; farmers find no markets for their produce; and the savings of
many years in thousands of families are gone. More important, a host of unemployed citizens
face the grim problem of existence, and an equally great number toil with little return. Only a
foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment.
And yet our distress comes from no failure of substance. We are stricken by no plague of
locusts. Compared with the perils which our forefathers conquered because they believed
and were not afraid, we have still much to be thankful for. Nature still offers her bounty and
human efforts have multiplied it. Plenty is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it lan-
guishes in the very sight of the supply. Primarily this is because the rulers of the exchange of
mankind’s goods have failed, through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence,
have admitted their failure and have abdicated. Practices of the unscrupulous money chang-
ers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men.

True they have tried, but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition.
Faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the lending of more money. Stripped
of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership, they
have resorted to exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored confidence. They only know
the rules of a generation of self-seekers. They have no vision, and when there is no vision
the people perish.
Yes, the money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization. We
may now restore that temple to the ancient truths. The measure of that restoration lies in the
extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit.
Happiness lies not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the
thrill of creative effort. The joy, the moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten
in the mad chase of evanescent profits. These dark days, my friends, will be worth all they
cost us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to minister to
ourselves — to our fellow men.

To account for, and excuse the tyranny of man, many ingenious arguments have been
brought forward to prove, that the two sexes, in the acquirement of virtue, ought to aim at
attaining a very different character: or, to speak explicitly, women are not allowed to have
sufficient strength of mind to acquire what really deserves the name of virtue. Yet it should
seem, allowing them to have souls, that there is but one way appointed by providence to
lead MANKIND to either virtue or happiness.
If then women are not a swarm of ephemeron triflers, why should they be kept in ignorance
under the specious name of innocence? Men complain, and with reason, of the follies and
caprices of our sex, when they do not keenly satirize our headstrong passions and groveling
vices. Behold, I should answer, the natural effect of ignorance! The mind will ever be unstable
that has only prejudices to rest on, and the current will run with destructive fury when there

are no barriers to break its force. Women are told from their infancy, and taught by the exam-
ple of their mothers, that a little knowledge of human weakness, justly termed cunning,
softness of temper, OUTWARD obedience, and a scrupulous attention to a puerile kind of
propriety, will obtain for them the protection of man; and should they be beautiful, every
thing else is needless, for at least twenty years of their lives.
Thus Milton1 describes our first frail mother; though when he tells us that women are formed
for softness and sweet attractive grace, I cannot comprehend his meaning, unless . . . he
meant to deprive us of souls, and insinuate that we were beings only designed by sweet
attractive grace, and docile blind obedience, to gratify the senses of man when he can no
longer soar on the wing of contemplation.
How grossly do they insult us, who thus advise us only to render ourselves gentle, domestic
brutes! For instance, the winning softness, so warmly, and frequently recommended, that
governs by obeying. What childish expressions, and how insignificant is the being — can it
be an immortal one? Who will condescend to govern by such sinister methods! “Certainly,”
says Lord Bacon2, “man is of kin to the beasts by his body: and if he be not of kin to God
by his spirit, he is a base and ignoble creature!” Men, indeed, appear to me to act in a very
unphilosophical manner, when they try to secure the good conduct of women by attempting
to keep them always in a state of childhood. Rousseau3 was more consistent when he wished
to stop the progress of reason in both sexes; for if men eat of the tree of knowledge, women
will come in for a taste: but, from the imperfect cultivation which their understandings now
receive, they only attain a knowledge of evil.
Children, I grant, should be innocent; but when the epithet is applied to men, or women, it is
but a civil term for weakness. For if it be allowed that women were destined by Providence to
acquire human virtues, and by the exercise of their understandings, that stability of character
which is the firmest ground to rest our future hopes upon, they must be permitted to turn to
the fountain of light, and not forced to shape their course by the twinkling of a mere satellite.
Milton, I grant, was of a very different opinion; for he only bends to the indefensible right of
beauty, though it would be difficult to render two passages, which I now mean to contrast,
consistent: but into similar inconsistencies are great men often led by their senses:
To whom thus Eve4 with perfect beauty adorned:
My author and disposer, what thou bidst
Unargued I obey; so God ordains;
God is thy law, thou mine; to know no more
Is woman’s happiest knowledge and her praise.
These are exactly the arguments that I have used to children; but I have added, “Your reason
is now gaining strength, and, till it arrives at some degree of maturity, you must look up to
me for advice: then you ought to THINK, and only rely on God.”

Questions 23 – 30 are based on this excerpt from a memoir about growing up in the 1950s.
Read it carefully and then answer the questions that follow.
In first grade, no matter where I sit, I can see the board. In second grade things are fuzzier,
and I start to squint, but I can still make out the words if I try. I learn to memorize the letters
on the eyechart during our annual trip to the nurse’s office, where we stand in a line to be
weighed and measured, checked for ringworm and nearsightedness. As I wait (my last name
begins with S, so it’s always a while), I hear the letters and have no trouble repeating them
when it’s my turn.
I know I’m going to need glasses someday, and I desperately don’t want them. I’ve somehow
absorbed that “men don’t make passes at girls who wear glasses.” Nobody tells me how to
feel about men with glasses and I’m not into boys yet anyway, but somehow glasses seem
to close off a part of my future in a way I can’t explain. 
By third grade I’m in seriously blurred territory, and by fourth I’m having whole conversa-
tions with people I can’t recognize because they’re in a car, perhaps, or across the street. In
fourth grade my teacher, Mrs. Ferris, sends a note home about the trouble I’m having seeing
the board. It’s an arrest warrant, one that I must deliver myself, and my mother takes me
to the eye doctor where, for the first time, I can’t memorize the 20-20 line because there’s no
one ahead of me. He writes out a prescription, which I take as my sentence, head bowed to
the inevitable. 
Our usual shopping areas have lots of eyeglass stores, but after some discussion that I am
not a party to, we drive to the city and walk into a couple of dingy stores where my parents
ask a lot of questions about prices. I am ready to cry anyway; I don’t want the glasses and
I don’t want to stand around listening to the bargaining, which to me seems vaguely impolite
and totally embarrassing. Finally, in the third or fourth store, the question of cost is settled
and all I have to do is to pick out frames. Butterflies are in style (it’s the Fifties), and I choose
green plastic.
I formulate a plan, which I actually stick to for the first year or so. I’ll put the glasses on only
to see the board and otherwise leave them in their case. Because we sit in rows facing for-
ward in my school, a minimum of people will see me with my glasses on. I’ll whip them off as
soon as I decode what’s on the board and they’ll never see the light of day in the playground.
Outside of school, I’ll just sit closer to the television or squint. I won’t use them when com-
pany comes. I know what everyone looks like, and I dread the “don’t you look adorable” or
“four eyes” comments I’m bound to receive.

Leaving the glasses store, I’m astonished when my father turns away from the car. Suddenly
all the signs are in Chinese. Even with my eyes I can tell. We go into a tiny shop filled with
exotic trinkets. My father tells me to pick out a doll. I gape for a second. It’s not my birthday
or a special occasion. Could he really know how I feel? My mother looks surprised but nods
her head. I can have a doll.
I choose a Chinese dancer in a long red dress, her black hair elaborately styled and her back
arched. She comes with a little wooden stand. All the way home I examine her, fingering the
silk of her dress, touching the painted porcelain face. She, I note, does not wear glasses. In
the house again, I put her on my shelf. Every year thereafter I go back to the eye doctor and
get stronger glasses, and then just in time for college, contact lenses. I don’t remember
throwing out the Chinese doll, but at some point I must have, because she wasn’t there when
my brother and I cleared out the house after my mother’s stroke. Everything else in my room
was just as I left it when I announced that I was moving to an apartment the next day — my
makeup, my curlers, my schoolbooks. I tried to pack some of those things when I left home
for good, but the atmosphere was soaked with anger and tears. (“You’re not stripping that
room and leaving us with bare walls for everyone to see,” my mother had hissed, ripping the
little mirror I thought was mine out of my hand as I packed.) Also everything I wanted to
move had to be carried on two subways and a bus, and no one would help me because I
wasn’t supposed to go. So I didn’t take much. Not even the only present my father ever gave
me, truly from himself.

Questions 31 – 40 are based on this excerpt from a biography of George Gordon, Lord Byron,
a poet.
“I was sent, at five years old, or earlier, to a school kept by a Mr. Bowers, who was called
‘Bodsy Bowers,’ by reason of his dapperness. It was a school for both sexes. I learned little
there except to repeat by rote the first lesson of monosyllables (‘God made man’ — ‘Let us
love him’), by hearing it often repeated, without acquiring a letter. Whenever proof was made
of my progress, at home, I repeated these words with the most rapid fluency; but on turning
over a new leaf, I continued to repeat them, so that the narrow boundaries of my first year’s
accomplishments were detected, my ears boxed, (which they did not deserve, seeing it was
by ear only that I had acquired my letters,) and my intellects consigned to a new preceptor.
He was a very devout, clever, little clergyman, named Ross, afterwards minister of one of the
kirks.1 (East, I think). Under him I made astonishing progress; and I recollect to this day his
mild manners and good-natured pains-taking. The moment I could read, my grand passion
was history, and, why I know not, but I was particularly taken with the battle near the Lake
Regillus in the Roman History, put into my hands the first. Four years ago, when standing on
the heights of Tusculum, and looking down upon the little round lake that was once Regillus,
and which dots the immense expanse below, I remembered my young enthusiasm and my old

instructor. Afterwards I had a very serious, saturnine, but kind young man, named Paterson,
for a tutor. He was the son of my shoemaker, but a good scholar, as is common with the
Scotch. He was a rigid Presbyterian also. With him I began Latin in ‘Ruddiman’s Grammar,’
and continued till I went to the ‘Grammar School . . . where I threaded all the classes to the
fourth, when I was recalled to England (where I had been hatched) by the demise of my
uncle. I acquired this handwriting, which I can hardly read myself, under the fair copies of
Mr. Duncan of the same city: I don’t think he would plume himself much upon my progress.
However, I wrote much better then than I have ever done since. Haste and agitation of one
kind or another have quite spoilt as pretty a scrawl as ever scratched over a frank. The gram-
mar-school might consist of a hundred and fifty of all ages under age. It was divided into five
classes, taught by four masters, the chief teaching the fourth and fifth himself. As in England,
the fifth, sixth forms, and monitors, are heard by the head masters.”
Of his class-fellows at the grammar-school there are many, of course, still alive, by whom he
is well remembered; and the general impression they retain of him is, that he was a lively,
warm-hearted, and high-spirited boy — passionate and resentful, but affectionate and com-
panionable with his schoolfellows — to a remarkable degree venturous and fearless, and (as
one of them significantly expressed it) “always more ready to give a blow than take one.”
Among many anecdotes illustrative of this spirit, it is related that once, in returning home
from school, he fell in with a boy who had on some former occasion insulted him, but had
then got off unpunished — little Byron, however, at the time, promising to “pay him off” when-
ever they should meet again. Accordingly, on this second encounter, though there were some
other boys to take his opponent’s part, he succeeded in inflicting upon him a hearty beating.
On his return home, breathless, the servant enquired what he had been about, and was
answered by him with a mixture of rage and humour, that he had been paying a debt, by
beating a boy according to promise; for that he was a Byron, and would never belie his
motto, “Trust Byron.”
He was, indeed, much more anxious to distinguish himself among his school-fellows by
prowess in all sports and exercises, than by advancement in learning. Though quick, when he
could be persuaded to attend, or had any study that pleased him, he was in general very low
in the class, nor seemed ambitious of being promoted any higher. It is the custom, it seems, in
this seminary, to invert, now and then, the order of the class, so as to make the highest and
lowest boys change places — with a view, no doubt, of piquing the ambition of both. On these
occasions, and only these, Byron was sometimes at the head, and the master, to banter him,
would say, “Now, George, man, let me see how soon you’ll be at the foot again.”

It was not the notion that madness was curable that changed at the end of the eighteenth
century, for a kind of therapeutic self-confidence ran throughout traditional medicine with its
bleeding, purging, and giving of emetics — all designed to cure. Rather, it was the notion that
institutions themselves could be made curative, that confinement in them, rather than
merely removing a nuisance from the vexed family or the aggrieved village elders, could
make the patient better. This insight broke in an almost revolutionary way upon the scene.
Yet the eighteenth-century Enlightenment did flatter itself that through the use of reason it
could much improve on the therapeutics of previous generations. The notion of curability
was good Enlightenment thinking, part of a larger agenda of improvement through social,
political, or medical engineering. If Revolutionary France could be given a constitution and
the laws of market economics laid bare, so could illness be systematically treated through
right-thinking therapeutic philosophies. Radiating from such centers as Edinburgh, a new
therapeutic optimism engulfed the whole world of medicine in the second half of the eigh-
teenth century, an optimism that psychiatry shared. A new generation of asylum physicians
grew up filled with confidence in their ability to heal.
So diffuse was the spirit of change that it is difficult to identify a single individual as responsi-
ble for the new-style asylum. Germany’s Johann Reil spoke of an international movement to
help the plight of the insane. “The physicians of England, France, and Germany,” he said in
1803, “are all stepping forward at once to improve the lot of the insane. . . . The cosmopolite
sees joyously the untiring efforts of mankind to ensure the welfare of one’s neighbor. The hor-
rors of the prisons and the jails are over. . . . A bold race of men dares to take on this gigantic
idea, an idea that dizzies the normal burgher, of wiping from the face of the earth one of the
most devastating pestilences.”1 Just imagine: Nothing less than eradicating insanity was what
they had in mind, couched in the most delicious of Enlightenment Rhetoric.
It is possible, however, to identfy a handful of asylum physicians whose writings became bea-
cons for the rest of the psychiatric world. In view of the great controversy surrounding this
subject, one notes that the reform movement in psychiatry was truly international. There are
scholars who associate the rise of psychiatry with various influences, some saying that capi-
talism was responsible, others the central state.2 Yet the new therapeutic optimism of psychi-
atry originated in a wide variety of social and economic settings, making it unlikely that any
single social force such as capitalism offers the answer. Enlightenment-style scientific think-
ing on the other hand spanned continents: Journals circulated widely, important books were
soon translated, and individual physicians undertook trips abroad to learn what was happen-
ing elsewhere. It was this kind of scientific thinking, largely independent of social setting, that
seems to have launched psychiatry.

Excerpt from Consequences of the Internet for Self and Society: Is Social Life Being
Transformed?, edited by Katelyn Y. A. McKenna and John Bargh (Wiley-Blackwell, 1991;
reprinted with permission of John Wiley and Sons, Inc.) 
The events of September 11, 2001, put many aspects of modern life in a new, stark, and
poignant perspective. Among their many ramifications was to illuminate some of the posi-
tive, as well as the negative, consequences of the emergent Internet as a mode of interper-
sonal communication. Many of us who had friends, family, and colleagues in the downtown
New York area found ourselves unable to make contact over the telephone, given the damage
to vital communications switching and relay equipment. But the Internet was intact, at least
enough so that e-mails were sent and received and people could stay in touch during many
very dark hours. According to a Pew Foundation report, in the 48 hours after the attack,
between four and five million people turned to the Internet to make contact with loved ones
and friends because they could not make contact via telephone.
At the same time, the unfolding investigation into the terrorist attack has revealed that e-mail
was a primary mode of communication for the network of conspirators allegedly responsible
for it. The use of encryption technology made it especially difficult to decode the messages
and so to gather intelligence about the movements and plans of terrorist suspects — making
the Internet a much more effective means of secretive and sinister communication than the
telephone or other communication modes.

Excerpt from “The Social Net,” an article by Bruce Bower published in Science News, 5/4/2002,
p. 282. (Reprinted with permission from Science News, copyright 2002.)
Serveral surveys have probed the social repercussions of Internet use. They offer starkly dif-
ferent portraits of life online.
On the upbeat side, two national surveys of about 2,000 adults each, conducted in 2000 and
2001 by the University of California, Los Angeles Center for Communication Policy, found
that regular Internet users reported spending as much time on most social activities as
nonusers did. The online crowd cut back on television time, watching the tube 4.5 fewer
hours per week than the no-Net group did.
National surveys in the same years, coordinated by the Pew Internet and American Life
Project in Washington, D.C., yielded even rosier findings. Project researchers concluded that
the online world is a “vibrant social universe” in which people widen their contacts and
strengthen ties to their local communities.
Data published last November in the American Behavioral Scientist supported the Pew find-
ings. In national telephone surveys of as many as 2,500 people conducted annually from 1995
to 2000, Internet users reported more community and political involvement, as well as more
social contacts, than nonusers did, reported sociologist James E. Katz of Rutgers University
in New Brunswick, N.J., and his colleagues.
A 1998 survey of about 39,000 visitors to the National Geographic Society web site also noted
a social boost from Internet use. In this population, which included many veteran Internet
users, online interactions typically supplemented in-person and telephone contacts, says
University of Toronto sociologist Barry Wellman. However, two other national surveys,
released in 2000, indicated that regular Internet use may often lead people to spend less time
with friends and family; Stanford University researchers directed one survey. The other was a
joint project of National Public Radio, the Kaiser Family Foundation, and Harvard University.

Excerpt from The Internet For Dummies, 11th Edition, by John R. Levine, Margaret Levine
Young, and Carol Baroudi (Wiley, 2007; reprinted with permission of John Wiley and Sons, Inc.)
Another great thing about the Internet is that it is what one may call “socially unstratified.”
That is, one computer is no better than any other, and no person is any better than any
other. Who you are on the Internet depends solely on how you present yourself through your
computer. If what you say makes you sound like an intelligent, interesting person, that’s who
you are. It doesn’t matter how old you are or what you look like or whether you’re a student,
business executive, or construction worker. Physical disabilities don’t matter — we corre-
spond with deaf and blind people. If they hadn’t felt like telling us, we never would have
known. People become famous (and infamous) in the Internet community through their
own efforts.

Ray Oldenburg has described how people use “third places” such as coffee shops, community
centers, beauty parlors, general stores, bars, and other hangouts to help them get through
the day. These places were distinct from home and distinct from work, but were integral
parts of social life. As scholars began to look at typical uses of the Internet, many adopted an
analytical frame that the Internet was like one of these third places — a growing sphere of
social interaction where people played games and socialized. They studied how individuals
and small groups behaved within specific environments. 
Internet tools have diffused with such speed and depth that many important forms of social
organization — news agencies, business enterprises, charities, and the government — take
care to manage their identity on the Internet, and some have been fundamentally altered by
the organizational opportunities and stresses provided by such technologies. The Internet is
no longer just a third place where people go to escape and play with games and identities.
Today, many of the common forms of daily social interaction can be conducted online, from
checking the news and sports scores and to researching and booking travel reservations.
However, there is little consensus about whether the ability of users to conduct personal and
professional life through Internet technologies is ultimately good or bad for society at large,
local communities, and individual well-being.
Those who argue that Internet tools have an ill effect make the case that Internet tools promote
the growth of pseudo rather than real communities, breed a new kind of radical individualism,
replicate traditional elites, ideologies, and American cultural hegemony, facilitate the violation
of privacy, abet sound-bite culture, and clutter modern life with useless data and cumbersome
technologies. Others have argued that the Internet shears social networks and lets individuals
disconnect from their families and friends, becoming loners, if not Internet addicts.
In the other camp are those who contend that Internet tools are good for society. One argu-
ment is that the Internet allows ideas to circulate to a wide audience and thus helps entrepre-
neurs with good ideas find capital and bring expertise to bear on marketable products and
services. Others make the case that Internet technologies may help flatten hierarchies, dilute
power from traditional elites who monopolize information, permit new and interesting forms
of community, make citizen activism easier and more effective, and encourage a generally
self-reflective society.

Excerpt from an unpublished editorial by Henry Charles (pseudonym)
More than 137 million Chinese citizens have access to the Internet, and that number is grow-
ing every year. At some point in 2009, China will surpass the United States in the number of
Internet users. The Chinese government has tried hard to censor the Internet by blocking
content antithetical to its policies. Furthermore, the government actively pursues and then
punishes anyone who posts anti-government comments. However, it is unlikely that the gov-
ernment will be able to control the massive exchange of informTation between its citizens
as they troll the Internet. The Internet is simply too vast to censor effectively. Once they
become used to a free exchange of ideas, who knows what the Internet-savvy Chinese will
demand of their government?
However, China’s access to the Internet is not evenly distributed. Chinese Internet users tend
to be young males living in cities. Only .4% of Chinese Internet users are low-income farmers.
The Chinese “digital divide” between those who have access to computers and those who
don’t is similar to the divide in Western countries, where the poor, residents of rural areas,
and uneducated are less likely to have the means to go online.

Essay question two: Paul Robeson
Directions: The following passage is drawn from The Undiscovered Paul Robeson, An Artist’s
Journey by Paul Robeson, Jr. (Wiley, 2000; reprinted with permission of John Wiley and
Sons, Inc.). Paul Robeson, an African American, was an actor, singer, and political activist.
His father was the Reverend William Drew Robeson, referred to in this passage as “William
Drew.” Read the passage carefully. Then write an essay analyzing the rhetorical strategies
the author employs to illuminate influences on Paul Robeson’s character. 
When Paul was two, his brother Bill tried to enroll at Princeton University, but he was
rebuffed. Refusing as usual to compromise on matters of principle, William Drew appealed in
person to Woodrow Wilson, then president of Princeton, for Bill’s enrollment. Reverend
Robeson refused to accept any of Wilson’s repeated and forceful attempts to avoid a direct
response, compelling the future president of the United States to declare angrily that
Princeton did not accept “colored.” It was long rumored in Princeton’s black community that
this defiance cost William Drew his pastorate. A wealthy white Presbyterian church had built
Witherspoon for its black members after having accommodated them in balcony seats for
decades. But ultimate control remained with the white authorities, and one day they took
William Drew’s pastorate from him on a spurious pretext. Despite his well-argued statement
of defense at his hearing and the near-unanimous support of his congregation, the preacher’s
son’s decision to remove him from his pastorate (which he had appealed) was announced as
final on November 17, 1900.
Paul was probably in the audience sitting with his mother, brothers, and sister when
Reverend Robeson preached his last sermon at Witherspoon Church on January 27, 1901.
Well known throughout the region for his dramatic power and inspiring messages, the rev-
erend filled the sanctuary with his deep, melodious bass voice. Paul would always recall it as
the greatest speaking voice he ever heard. On that day, William Drew made no direct mention
of his dismissal. But he did intimate that his departure stemmed from his refusal to curtail
his determined criticism of social injustice.
On January 29, 1901, two days after William Drew had preached his farewell sermon at
Witherspoon Church, George C. White, of William Drew’s home state of North Carolina and
the nation’s sole remaining black congressman, defiantly addressed the U.S. House of
Representatives. His term was coming to an end, he said, and the electoral rigging legitimized
by the U.S. Supreme Court in the service of white rule had denied him any hope of reelection.
His departure, he noted, was “perhaps the Negroes’ temporary farewell to the American
Congress; but we say, Phoenix-like he will rise up some day to come again.” So too would
William Drew rise again. The Robeson family had to leave the comfortable Witherspoon
Street parsonage and move to a smaller house on Green Street around the corner. Bill
boarded at Lincoln University and two years later enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania
Medical School. William Drew gave himself to making a living. Paul would write about this
period later in his autobiography:
He was still the dignified Reverend Robeson to the community, and no man carried
himself with greater pride. Not once did I hear him complain of the poverty and
misfortune of those years. Serene and undaunted, he struggled to earn a livelihood
and see to our education. He got a horse and wagon, and began to earn his living
hauling ashes. This was his work at the time I first remember him, and I recall the

growing mound of ashes dumped in our backyard. A fond memory remains of our
horse, a mare named Bess, whom I grew to love and who loved me. My father also
went into the hack business and as a coachman drove students around town and
on trips to the seashore. Mostly I played. There were the vacant lots for ball
games, and the wonderful moments when Bill [then in his mid-twenties], vacation-
ing from college where he played on the team, would teach me how to play foot-
ball. He was my first coach, and over and over again on a weed-grown lot he would
put me through the paces — how to tackle a man so he stayed tackled, how to run
with the ball.
Paul chose not to mention that the meager rations of the Robesons in Princeton had to be
supplemented by relatives in North Carolina who sent up “cornmeal, greens, yams, peanuts
and other goodies in bags.” From that time on, he relished a good meal in a way that those
who have always been well fed do not.

N
ow that you’ve sweated through an entire AP English Language and Composition
exam, you deserve the title of Most Likely to Succeed on AP Test Day. But before you
sigh with relief, take a few minutes to see how you rate. Feel free to use the official Teacher’s
Revenge color (red) or anything else that stands out on the page as you correct your work.
Planning Your Attack
To go about checking how well you did on Practice Exam One, follow this plan of attack:
1. Check the multiple-choice section.
Count the number of correct answers and the number of incorrect answers. Ignore any-
thing you left blank. Write the number of correct and incorrect answers in the Multiple-
Choice Conversion Chart. You can find details on scoring this portion of the test and
the Multiple-Choice Conversion Chart in the section “Slurping Alphabet Soup: Rating
the Multiple-Choice Section.” 
2. Read the explanations for any multiple-choice questions that puzzled you.
This category includes all your wrong answers and any questions you guessed at, even
if you ended up with the correct answer. Figure out what types of questions stumped
you. Vocabulary? Tone? What to cook for supper? (Oops. Strike that last one.) Once
you’ve pinpointed problem areas, turn to the corresponding chapters in this book for
extra review.
3. Read the scoring guidelines for the essay questions.
These guidelines come in two flavors: general and specific. You need both to score
your essays. 
• The general guidelines: These appear in the section “Going Pro: Grading Essay
Responses Like an AP Expert” and apply to all essays. 
• The specific guidelines: These are tailored to one particular question. For each
essay question, I provide two sample answers and the score each would receive
in a real AP-grading situation, along with a breakdown of the essay’s rating in four
different categories. Understanding how AP graders think helps you evaluate
your own essays. You can find the specific guidelines in the sections following the
general guidelines. 

4. Score your essays.
After you read both the general and specific guidelines explaining what to look for in
evaluating your essay, reread what you wrote, fill in the scoring grid, and add up your
efforts with the help of the Essay Scoring Grids. Write the magic numbers in the Essay
Conversion Chart at the end of the essay scoring section.
5. Convert your score. 
The Exam Conversion Chart tells you how to turn those raw scores on the multiple-
choice and essay sections into AP grades of 1 to 5.
I hope these steps inspire you to bring an apple to school tomorrow — one without a worm
inside — to thank your teachers for all the work they do. And now that you know how to
grade an AP exam, get moving. That exam won’t score itself!

Yes, I know. If you see one more little oval, you’ll run screaming down the street. Cheer up.
You don’t have to fill in any more blanks; you just have to check your answers. Be sure to
read the explanations accompanying the tough ones. Remember to fill in the chart at the end
of this section.
You don’t have to read the explanations for questions you answered correctly. However, if
you can spare a little more time, you may learn something even from the questions you got
right. Why? Because I’ve packed the explanations with helpful hints — a definition of a liter-

Individual answers
1. (E). The “all of the following EXCEPT” questions are easy if you rule out each item as you come
across it. First to go is (A), because of the expression “the truth, the whole truth” (line 4). If
you’re a cop-show fan, you probably recognized an allusion, or reference, to the oath that wit-
nesses swear, which is “to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.” That same
phrase is repetitive (two truths), as is “will endure as it has endured” (line 5), so you can drop
(B). Next to go is (C); alliteration, the repetition of consonant sounds, shows up in “the only
thing we have to fear is fear itself” (lines 6–7). Hear those “f” sounds? Direct address (D) means
that the author/speaker is talking to someone, and the “you” in line 10 fills the bill. All that’s
left — and what’s missing — is a simile, a comparison made with the words “like” or “as.”
2. (A). The second paragraph opens with two general statements — that Americans face
“common difficulties” (line 12) that fortunately concern “only material things” (line 13). Then
comes the list: loss of value, high taxes, lack of money to pay taxes, savings wiped out, and
so forth. Choice (A) fits this pattern perfectly, and (B) has it backward. (C) is a nonstarter
because Roosevelt didn’t share any individual stories of hardship or triumph. (D) and (E) are
appealing because elsewhere in the speech both appear. The key word is elsewhere. When
the AP asks about a particular spot, remember what your kindergarten teacher said while
handing you a crayon: “Stay inside the lines.”
3. (C). The metaphor “withered leaves” (line 15) is tied to “industrial enterprise” (lines 15–16),
and industry relies partly on factories. Another clue pointing you toward (C) is the fact that
the metaphor occurs in the middle of a list of problems of the Great Depression. To decide
which one matches the metaphor, use common sense. When you’re making a list, you may
264

pull a Santa Claus and check it twice, but you’re not likely to repeat an item. (I have to go to
the store to buy “ice cream, cookies, and ice cream?” I don’t think so.) The list in the long
sentence featuring “withered leaves” includes “[v]alues have shrunk” (line 13), which is close
to (A), and government’s “serious curtailment of income” (line 14), which is another way of
saying (B). (D) is out because “farmers find no markets” (line 16), implying that what farmers
do sell probably goes at bargain prices. (E) is expressed by “the means of exchange are
frozen” (line 15). Once you’ve ruled out (A), (B), (D), and (E), you know (C) is best.
4. (B). Roosevelt has just listed all the problems his new administration is facing. Thus he’s
implying that he’s realistic about the challenges ahead of him. Did I catch you with (A)?
That choice is tempting because the opening paragraph of this inaugural address refers to
“victory” (line 10) and the firm belief that “this great Nation” (line 5) will not only “endure”
(line 5) but “prosper” (line 6). Sounds like hope to me! However, the hope of the first para-
graph isn’t the main idea of the second paragraph, and hope isn’t the purpose of Roosevelt’s
comment about optimism. Choice (C) isn’t in the running because “others’ views” don’t
appear in the passage, and (D) is too general. (E) bombs because of all the positive stuff in
the first paragraph.
5. (D). The phrase in the question can be paraphrased as “we’re not in trouble because we’re
lacking material things,” the same idea expressed by (D). The other choices don’t even come
close.
6. (C). The third paragraph has a split personality. The first part discusses what the nation has,
and the second discusses what went wrong. The shift is in the middle of the fourth sentence,
when Roosevelt changes gears from statements about what material advantages the country
possesses to a critique of the way in which those advantages were used. The exact spot is
marked by the comma following “doorstep” (line 23).
The word “but” often marks a shift, qualifies or modifying the meaning of whatever precedes
it. Whenever you see “but,” take a second look.
7. (D). “Concession and reply” steals the opponent’s defense, retools it a little, and swings it
around to smack the opponent in the nose. You probably use this technique when you’re
arguing with your favorite Authority Figure: “Yes, I know that a $5,000 increase in my
allowance is a little steep, but it’s still pretty small compared to the price of the sports car
you bought yesterday.” In the third paragraph (lines 20–27), Roosevelt indicts the financial
biggies, saying that “the rulers of the exchange” (line 24) “have failed” (line 25). He calls them
“unscrupulous money changers” (line 26). Then, anticipating the counter argument,
Roosevelt concedes, “True they have tried” (line 28). Now for the knockout punch: “[T]heir
efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition” (line 28). The rest of the para-
graph tears them to shreds. (A) may have grabbed your attention, because “True they have
tried” does tie the third and fourth paragraph together. However, (D) is much more specific
and thus the better answer. The other choices aren’t relevant.
8. (A). The subject of a verb is the person or thing performing the action or in the state of being
expressed by the verb. To find the subject, ask “who have admitted?” or “what have admitted?”
The “rulers” (line 24) “have admitted” that they blew the economy.
9. (E). The Great Depression was no picnic, and Roosevelt’s speech acknowledges that the
country is in crisis, so “realistic” certainly applies. However, he takes care to inspire his lis-
teners as well with such phrases as “This great nation . . . will prosper” (lines 5–6) and “our
true destiny [is] . . . to minister to . . . our fellow men” (lines 40–41). Therefore, (E) is the
best answer.
10. (B). Passive voice is a grammatical term, but you can answer this question even if you sleep
through English classes sometimes. (I’m joking, of course, because I know that you would
never give less than 100 percent of your attention to your teacher.) If something is passive, it
just sits there, receiving action, words, impressions, and so forth. Something active does the
opposite — creates the action, words, and impressions. The lines cited push the listeners
into active mode, not passively awaiting government instructions or help. Choice (C)
expresses the opposite idea. (A) and (D) are irrelevant, and (E) has nothing to do with active
or passive voice.
265
Chapter 19: Facing the Music: Checking Practice Exam One

11. (C). Mary Wollstonecraft, the author of A Vindication of the Rights of Women from which this
passage is excerpted, wasn’t exactly shy about sharing her opinions. In the late eighteenth
century, when she wrote this argument for women’s education, the prevailing idea was that
females should be decorative and ignorant. Hard to believe now, isn’t it? 
12. (D). As a punctuation fan (yes, I have no life), I have often thought that the colon is under-
used. Lots of people plop it in front of lists or after the “To Whom It May Concern” of busi-
ness letters, but almost no one these days uses it the way Wollstonecraft did in the first
sentence of this passage. The material after the colon explains more specifically the stuff
before the colon. Before the colon, she writes that one of the “ingenious arguments” (line 1)
justifying male dominance is that virtue is different in men and women. After the colon, she
gets down to the details, explaining that “women are not allowed to have sufficient strength
of mind to acquire what really deserves the name of virtue” (lines 3–4). Now that you know
this function of one of my favorite punctuation marks, feel free to colon-ize your writing.
13. (B). The first paragraph briefly explains one of the “ingenious arguments” (line 1) used to
“prove, that the two sexes, in the acquirement of virtue” (line 2) go for “a very different
character” (line 3). Notice the key word: “different.” The sentence you’re examining for this
question (“Yet it should seem . . . happiness” — lines 5–6) opposes this point of view by stat-
ing that “there is but one way” (line 5) to virtue. By the way, the capitalized word, “MANKIND”
(line 6), here refers to both males and females. Today’s politically-correct types — and I’m
one — prefer the more inclusive “humankind” or “human beings,” but in Wollstonecraft’s day,
“mankind” was the word of choice for both sexes.
14. (E). The second paragraph of the passage (lines 7–16) is chock-full of big ideas, general
statements about men and women that Wollstonecraft supports by logic but no factual
information — ruling out (C). This paragraph has no allusions (references to literary or his-
torical works), so you can rule out (A). It doesn’t present opposing concepts, so (B) bombs.
(D) doesn’t work because, if anything, Wollstonecraft exaggerates, not understates, her case.
15. (C). Paragraph two opens with a rhetorical question — one that the author will soon answer
unless the question is so obvious that the author believes that the reader must come up with
the correct response. You know the kind of question I mean: “Do you have time to take out
the garbage?” When a parental unit asks a question like that, the only possible answer is yes.
Anyway, back to the passage. Wollstonecraft actually provides an answer, assuming that her
reader may indeed favor ignorance for women. (C) contains a little phrase, “I should answer”
(line 10), that tips you off.
16. (B). The list of traits taught to women by word and example is fairly long, but only one word
shows up in capital letters. Why “OUTWARD” (line 14) and not “outward”? Okay, emphasis
comes to mind, and (B) implies that unless Wollstonecraft makes a big deal about this point,
the reader may not realize that women only seem to obey. Inside, they’re tearing up the
place. (A) is the opposite of what Wollstonecraft is saying. (C) doesn’t cut it, despite the
word “emphasize,” because Wollstonecraft’s disapproval of the traditional female role is plas-
tered all over this passage. She would urge women to reveal, not conceal, their feelings and
ideas. Her feminist stance contradicts (D). You may have been tempted by (E), but the word
and sentence they’re asking you about doesn’t deal with rebellion against male authority fig-
ures, or anyone else, for that matter.
17. (C). This question is tricky. The word “thus” implies a connection and may be restated as
“in this way.” Your job — and you have to choose to accept it unless you skip the whole
question — is to figure out whether “thus” relates to something before or after it. The first
three choices cite lines before “thus,” and (D) and (E) cite lines following “thus.” So which
way do you turn? First, check out the context. Wollstonecraft mentions that “Milton
describes our first frail mother” (line 17). Okay, how does he describe her? In this way, or,
as the passage states, “thus” (line 17). Where do you find a list of traits belonging to the
“first frail mother? In choice (C). Maybe this question wasn’t so hard after all!
266
Part V: Testing, One, Two . . . Practice Exams 

18. (A). The best approach to this question is to skim the fourth paragraph, crossing out each
choice as you encounter it. First to be voted off the island is (C), which occurs in the sen-
tence beginning “For instance” (line 23). Next out is (E), with the third sentence (“What
childish . . .” — lines 24–25). Moving right along, you encounter an allusion, or reference, to
Rousseau and the Bible (lines 29 and 30–33), so (B) is a nonstarter. The “tree of knowledge”
(line 30) is also a metaphor, which is choice (D). Nothing remains but (A), which in this case
stands for the right answer.
19. (C). To answer this question, you need to know that “allow” is a synonym for “assume.” With
this information it’s easy to verify I: Just take a look at “allowing them to have souls” (line 5)
and II “For if it be allowed that women were destined by Providence to acquire human
virtues” (lines 34–35). You can rule out III when you get to the last paragraph, which counts
innocence as positive in children but, “applied to men, or women, it is but a civil term for
weakness” (lines 33–34). Bingo: only I and II are right, and (C) is your answer.
20. (B). A metaphor is an indirect comparison, a way to describe one thing by using another.
The “fountain of light” (line 37) is probably the sun. Staying with the solar system motif, the
metaphor is extended by the reference to a “mere satellite” (line 37), which is choice (B).
21.
(E). Main idea questions need to fit perfectly. A favorite trap is to provide some choices that
are too narrow, such as (D). Yes, the second paragraph discusses the effect of ignorance,
explaining that it leads to “follies and caprices” (lines 8–9) in women. But (D) doesn’t take
into account some of the other arguments the author presents, such as those in the fourth
paragraph, which takes men to task for “attempting to keep [women] in a state of childhood”
(lines 28–29). (C) is also too narrow, because appearance pops up only occasionally in the
passage. The excerpt refers to “Providence” (lines 5 and 34), and “Providence” may be inter-
preted as “God,” but those two references don’t justify (A). (B) drops out because male roles
aren’t explicitly addressed. What’s left? Choice (E), the appeal for women’s education, which
is the logical thread running through the whole passage.
22. (D). Read this passage aloud (in your inner voice) and you’ll immediately hear the passion in
the many exclamation points and the extreme word choices, such as “puerile kind of propri-
ety” (lines 14–15) and “docile blind obedience” (line 20). Argumentative also fits, as the
author is trying to convince her readers that women have the same need and ability to be
educated as men do.
23. (A). Three of the answer choices deal with time, but only (A) fits because in paragraphs 
one through three (lines 1–17), the narrator moves from first through fourth grade, in
chronological order. Other parts of the passage flash forward or back, but not this section.
Did (B) tempt you? The author recounts some facts from her childhood, but in a general 
way. Anecdotes are more specific. Instead of saying that “things are fuzzier” and “I start to
squint” (lines 1 and 2), an anecdotal approach would focus on one moment when a line on
the blackboard wasn’t clear. In the same way, (C) isn’t a good answer because the facts cited
in this portion of the passage are too general to qualify as examples. 
24. (C). The second paragraph (lines 7–10) deals with the narrator’s reluctance to wear glasses
because of concerns about attractiveness. She repeats the old saying, “Men don’t make
passes at girls who wear glasses” (line 8) just before the line cited in this question — “Nobody
tells me how to feel about men with glasses” (lines 8–9). The juxtaposition of these two ideas
presents the possibility of a double standard; the culture proclaims that a girl loses something
when she wears glasses but says nothing about men in the same situation. Some of the other
choices are possible. The narrator doesn’t know much about male attractiveness — choices
(A) and (E). She is making a statement about men’s attractiveness — choice (B). You can even
justify (D) on the grounds that no one has told her what to think or feel about this particular
situation, though she’s “somehow absorbed” what she should think about female appearance.
However, (C) is the best because it fits this passage most specifically.
267
Chapter 19: Facing the Music: Checking Practice Exam One

25. (D). The prescription is for glasses, which the narrator doesn’t want to wear. Her head is
“bowed to the inevitable” (lines 16–17) because she can’t escape wearing glasses. Thus the
prescription is the equivalent of the “fifteen years to life” sort of sentence that a judge hands
down. In other words, it’s a punishment. 
26. (A). The narrator gives no indication that she talked with her parents about her glass-phobia.
She mentions “some discussion that I am not a party to” (lines 18–19) and is surprised when
her father buys a doll, asking “Could he really know how I feel?” (line 35). (A) expresses this
distance between parents and child. Another serious contender for the Right Answer Award
is (C), because the narrator seems puzzled by her parents’ actions. However, the bewilder-
ment is a result of the distance, so (A) is better. (D) is a nonstarter because of the tension
implied in the last paragraph, when the mother and daughter fight about the daughter’s
move to an apartment.
27. (C). Don’t hyperventilate just because this question contains a grammar term (subordinate
clause). The secret is that you don’t have to know what a subordinate clause is to find the
correct answer. (For the record, a subordinate clause is an expression with a subject and a
verb that can’t stand alone. It depends on another statement to express a complete thought.)
Back to the question: dust off your reading comprehension skills to locate the answer.
Paragraph four (lines 18–24) deals with one shopping trip in the past. The opening line of
paragraph five (line 25) starts out at one specific moment of the trip, when the narrator
“formulate[s] a plan.” The subordinate clause shifts to the “first year or so” after she gets
glasses. There you go: the passage moves from the past to a bit later, and (C) rules.
28. (B). The last paragraph of this passage covers a lot of ground, from the arrival home after
buying the doll to the narrator’s move away “for good” (line 46). The move took place during
an argument, which this quotation from the mother illustrates.
29. (E). The mother’s parenthetical comment and the narrator’s statement about an atmosphere
“soaked with anger and tears” (line 46) rule out (A) and (B). The same factors point to (E) as
the best answer. (C) doesn’t work because the diction isn’t formal at all; in fact, beginning a
sentence with “so” is a fair indication of informal diction. (D) drops out because the narrator
doesn’t express her views of the future.
30. (B). The doll’s importance lies not in its intrinsic value (A) or its role in the moving-out fight (E).
Nor is the doll’s importance exaggerated or minimized, so you can cross out (C) and (D). (B) is
best because so much of the story is about buying the doll. Why so much fuss about a doll?
Because it’s an unusual act. Apart from the fact that the father wasn’t much of a gift-giver, the
passage reveals very little about the father-daughter relationship.
31. (D). Both parts of this passage are multilayered. The portion not written by Byron (lines
1–27) depicts him as someone who, while not exactly allergic to schoolwork, wasn’t glued to
his books either. Within these lines the author also conveys Byron’s pride and willingness to
fight. In the quotation (lines 1–27) that begins the passage, Byron jokes about his terrible
handwriting, but he also mentions his love of history and his move to England. Validation (A),
contrast (B), and balance (C) aren’t the best answers because they require simple, straight-
forward agreement or disagreement. Now you’re left with (D) and (E). Of the two, (D) is
better because Byron mentions several places and time periods, while the author’s exposi-
tion concentrates on one time and one place (school) in Byron’s life. Rather than setting a
scene, the quotation lets the reader “hear” Byron himself — in other words, it introduces
Byron’s voice into the passage.
32. (B). The author tells you that Byron didn’t shy away from a fight and that Byron was a “lively,
warm-hearted, and high-spirited boy” (lines 29–30). However, Byron’s appearance isn’t men-
tioned, so (B) — physical description — is the one you want. 
33. (A). “[A]cquired my letters” (line 8) means “learned to read.” Learning “by ear” probably
means that he was better at listening than at reading or writing. Byron apparently wasn’t a
good student, the idea expressed in (E), but his failures at school don’t come across in that
particular line.
268
Part V: Testing, One, Two . . . Practice Exams 

34. (E). This is a tricky question, because the battle of Lake Regillus (don’t ask me anything
about it! I’m not a historian!) was probably the first that Byron understood (A) and did
capture Byron’s attention (B). However, the line cited in the question is more particular, and
“put into my hands the first” (line 13) implies that Byron — just like you — got homework,
and homework is the subject of choice (E). 
35. (E). Byron pokes fun at himself in several spots — referring to his handwriting, for example,
as a “scrawl” (line 24) and his birthplace as “where I had been hatched” (line 20). “Self-
deprecating” is the term appropriate for comments like “The Nobel Prize? Oh, they give it
everyone these days, and it was just my turn.” Byron’s comment won’t provoke a belly laugh,
but it does have some mildly funny spots. Okay, I admit that nothing can make you laugh
during an AP test, but if you imagine an alternate universe, Byron employs some humor. The
other choices depend partly on your vocabulary knowledge. A “conciliatory” tone (A) aims
to make peace, while “didactic” (D) teaches a moral lesson. “Condescending” (also choice D)
is the tone of people who think they’re way better than anyone else.
36. (A). Byron, while gazing on the site of the battle he had read about as a schoolboy, “remem-
bered [his] young enthusiasm” (line 15), a statement implying that he’s lost some of that feel-
ing. Thus (A) is true, because the passage of time has altered Byron’s view. (B) is true
whenever time passes, but the passage doesn’t indicate when Byron visited Tusculum, other
than to say that it was “four years ago” (line 13). Hence you can’t tell if he’s “aged” or if he’s
just a bit older. (As someone who started first grade writing with a pen and inkwell, I can
state without hesitation that age matters!) (C) doesn’t work because Byron says nothing
about his later life, nor does he “promote the benefits of travel” (D). Finally, his comments
on Tusculum don’t sound regretful, so (E) isn’t the one you want.
37. (D). Byron says that Paterson “was the son of my shoemaker, but a good scholar” (line 17).
The word “but” is the star here. “But” gives a tone of surprise, as in “he was 4 feet tall but a
good basketball player.” To see the difference, imagine the sentence with “and”: “Paterson
was the son of my shoemaker and a good scholar.” Now the two facts about Paterson are
simply mentioned, with no hidden editorial comment. The other answers fail for various
reasons. (A) isn’t supported in the passage — and perhaps not in real life either! I’ll let you
decide, based on your own academic experiences with Mr. or Ms. Kind and their opposites,
the meanies who give you detention just for breathing. Choice (B) gets the axe because
Byron says “as is common” (line 17), an endorsement of Scottish scholarship but not strong
enough to justify the phrase “most people.” You can cut (C) and (E) because Byron doesn’t
comment on the quality of his own schoolwork with Paterson. 
38. (A). The second paragraph (lines 28–41) emphasizes the views of Byron’s classmates. They
describe him with several adjectives — “lively, warm-hearted . . . passionate and resentful”
(lines 29–30), but they also give examples (choice A) to support their characterization. For
example, one classmate explains that Byron was “always more ready to give a blow than to
take one” (line 32) and took time to “pay . . . off” (line 35) a classmate who had insulted him.
39. (C). Byron told his servant that he beat a boy “according to promise” (line 40). That’s not the
kind of promise I would brag about, but it is a promise, making (C) a good choice. The motto
doesn’t link paragraphs two and three, so (A) is out. (B) is way too general; you don’t know
what kind of statement is being made, other than the fact that it is “strong.” (D) and (E) miss
the point, because the quality highlighted by the motto is negative — keeping a promise to
wallop someone.
40. (B). Byron reaches the “head” (line 48) of the class only when the “highest and lowest boys”
(lines 46–47) change places, so Byron was probably not on the honor role. Even the school-
master comments that Byron will soon “be at the foot again” (line 49). Thus (B) works nicely.
(A), (C), and (D) are all attractive answers because the schoolmaster appears to have a lot of
power, the custom of ranking students is a real pain, and Byron and the schoolmaster were
probably not best buddies, given that the schoolmaster pretty much says that he expects
Byron to fail. However, these three answers don’t explain why the anecdote is in the passage;
they simply comment upon the anecdote. (E) doesn’t work because the anecdote has nothing
to do with the reasons why one of the greatest poets probably got a poor grade in English.
269
Chapter 19: Facing the Music: Checking Practice Exam One

41. (B). This passage begins with a time-honored device, heard most frequently during heat
waves, when everyone walks around saying that “it’s not the heat; it’s the humidity.” This
pattern — here’s what isn’t true and now here’s what is true — allows the author of this pas-
sage to explain that madness was always seen as “curable” (line 1) by such fun treatments as
“bleeding, purging, and giving of emetics” (line 3). Having told you that curability wasn’t new,
the author assumes your brain replies, “Fine. So what is new?” The next portion of the pas-
sage explains: The new thing in the eighteenth century was the idea that an institution “could
be made curative” (line 4). Thus (B) fits best here. The other choices are off base. The pas-
sage doesn’t criticize psychiatry; it simply reports, so (A) is a dud. The comparison in the
first paragraph of the passage (lines 1–6) is with an earlier era. Drop (C). Answer (D) is
tempting, because the reader is likely to criticize earlier methods of treating madness.
However, the negative (“It was not” — line 1) doesn’t set up the criticism; the sentence just
glides over the past into the idea of institutions as curative. Choice (E) is just too vague.
42. (A). The author of this passage probably plays tennis, because every idea is followed by an
implied or explicit “on the other hand” statement. It’s not this . . . it’s that. You may say this, but
then there’s the other point. People think x, but don’t forget y. Go back through the passage and
look for these comparisons and contrasts. Choice (A) leaps out at you. If it doesn’t, try ruling
out the other choices. The passage doesn’t move forward in time, so (B) is out. Nothing
physical is described, so (C) is a bad selection. (D) isn’t a terrible answer (though it’s not
the best one), because the passage tries to explain how Enlightenment ideas led to develop-
ments in psychiatry. However, strict cause-and-effect structure just isn’t here. Choice (E) is
out because the author doesn’t lead you through a series of steps to a logical conclusion.
43. (D). The easiest way to answer this question is to sum up the first two paragraphs in your
head. Paragraph 1: Before the Enlightenment, people tried to cure madness, but not very
well. The Enlightenment idea was to make the institution a place of healing. Paragraph 2:
The Enlightenment thought it could do better than previous generations in curing the men-
tally ill. A new generation of asylum docs arose. Okay, now that you have an outline, measure
it against the answers. (A) is a dud because “to refute” is to show that an idea is wrong, and
paragraph two doesn’t contradict paragraph one. Answer (B) is possible, for the same rea-
sons that (A) isn’t. However, “support” implies additional evidence, and paragraph two is
short on facts and long on generalizations. For this reason, (E) also fails. Choice (C) centers
on the idea of qualifying. To qualify, in this context, is to build a little fence around meaning,
as in “Yes, you can have the car, but only if you mow the lawn first.” No fences show up in
paragraph two, just a bit more of the same discussion begun in paragraph one — in other
words, (D).
44. (B). “Therapeutics” are healing methods, clearly identified here as “bleeding, purging, and
the giving of emetics” (line 3). Makes managed care, even counting the insurance forms, look
good, right? The other choices are all traps, because all of them are in the passage and all
look interesting — wrong, but interesting.
45. (E). The “new therapeutic optimism” is optimism about healing, the idea expressed by (E).
Did I catch you with (C) or (D)? The word “improvement” in (C) and “optimism” in (D) were
the bait, but neither (C) nor (D)says anything about healing. 
46. (C). The devilish part of this question lies in the fact that (A), (B), and (C) are all definitions of
“lot.” (D) isn’t justified by any statements in the passage, but (E) makes sense. However, only
(C) has two essential qualities: It makes sense in the passage and also qualifies as an official
definiton of “lot.”
47. (A). The author of this passage spent too much time on a seesaw at some point in life! He
puts forth an idea and then the opposing idea and then comes up somewhere in the middle.
Yup: I diagnose “Playground Complex.” Paragraph four lays out the “beacon” metaphor;
some physicians pointed the way to knowledge. Paragraph three starts out by saying that “it
is difficult to identify a single individual as responsible for the new-style asylum” (lines 16–17).
So what do you have? You can’t identify a single individual, but you can find a small group of
beacons. Therefore, (A) wins the prize here.
270
Part V: Testing, One, Two . . . Practice Exams 

48. (D). The “great controversy” (line 26) is outlined in the sentences following this phrase. Some
scholars point to capitalism, and others go for the “central state” (line 29). What are they
arguing about? The reasons why psychiatry changed during the Enlightenment. Reasons
are causes, so go for (D). None of the other choices even comes close.
49. (B). The key here is in line 30, when the author concudes that the “wide variety of social and
economic settings” made it “unlikely that any single social force” (lines 30–31) was responsi-
ble for the development of psychiatry. These lines point you toward (B) and away from (C).
The passage doesn’t deal with how and where mental illness occurs, so you can rule out
choices (A) and (E). Choice (D), at first glance, may draw you in, because Reil is mentioned
and then the author immediately switches to a wider view. However, Reil isn’t really the point
of the travel/movement examples mentioned in the question.
50. (E). The passage examines several possible reasons why treatment of the mentally ill changed
during the Enlightenment. The author presents a case, considering several theories and ulti-
mately supporting one. The pundits on television should be this balanced and informative!
None of the other choices comes close: The author makes a case, but the calmness of his
presentation rules out “combative and ironic” (A). There’s no nostalgia for the good old days
of psychiatry — choice (B). The author isn’t criticizing anyone, though he is teaching (making
“didactic” a possibility). However, both halves of the pair must be correct for the choice to
work. Choice (D) is out because the footnotes alone show the depth of the author’s research.
51. (B). The italicized title tells you that the quotation comes from a book, not an article. (In this
system of citation, the title of an article appears in quotation marks.) So right off the bat you
can rule out (C). Reil is the author, not the publisher; choice (A) is awful. The page numbers
tell you where the quotation appears, not how long the section is. Therefore, you can dis-
pense with (D). The book was reprinted in 1968, but nothing indicates that the quotation was
revised. What’s left? A book that was published in 1803 and reprinted in 1968.
52. (C). You can drop (A) and (B) because the italicized titles indicate books, not articles.
“London” is a place, not a company, so (D) doesn’t make the cut. The footnote also says that
the second book restates the argument of the first, so (E) isn’t appropriate. Bingo: (C) is what
you want, because the publication date is 1993.
53. (B). To “lambaste” is to scold sharply. The second footnote points out that the author twice
made the same argument against the theory that capitalism and psychiatry were related,
so (B) is best.

Going Pro: Grading Essay Responses 
Like an AP Expert
When the College Board gathers battle-scarred, weary college-professors and high-school
English teachers for a week of nonstop grading, it prepares well. First (and most impor-
tantly), it arranges for a continuous supply of caffeine. Second, all the graders read and rate
the same few essays, discussing their answers according to the College Board’s criteria. The
goal is to come up with a rubric, which is not a multicolored cube puzzle but a set of stan-
dards for great, good, fair, and don’t-even-think-about-it essays, along with several gradations
in between. The evaluators are charged with awarding a number from 0 to 9 to each essay,
with 9 being the best and 0 being, well, a zero.
This section explains the general guidelines the AP applies. Before you score your own
essays, however, turn to the sample answers I provide — along with a detailed analysis of
the good and bad points of each. Examining how the samples are graded helps you rate your
own work.
Living up to AP standards
The AP bigwigs pay statisticians to run around during each grading session, calculating the
norm for every question they ask, including the essay questions. The statisticians tweak the
standards a bit every year, adjusting for extra-easy or the super-tough, “What were we think-
ing when we wrote that?” questions. Tweaking aside, year after year the same general guide-
lines apply:
7 - 8 - 9: The College Board calls essays in this category “effective” in both content and
style. The essay answers the question, digs deeply into the text or topic, includes appro-
priate support for the ideas it asserts, and shows a mature command of language.
Supporting evidence is strongly linked to the topic and appropriately cited (if needed).
4 - 5 - 6: In this slot, the College Board rates your essay “adequate.” The essay makes
some good, but not great, points. It includes some supporting evidence and is generally
clear. The supporting points are linked to the topic, but not perfectly. The writing is a
little less fluid and may contain some errors in diction (word choice), grammar, spelling,
or citation (if needed). 
1 - 2 - 3: Now the essay resides in “inadequate” territory. Instead of analysis or argument,
the essay may simply summarize or restate ideas. Little or no supporting evidence
appears. The language is flawed, with incomplete sentences or enough grammar and
spelling errors to distract the reader.
0: The essay is left blank or does not address the question.
Professional AP grading is holistic. The evaluators don’t award 10 percent for grammar,
15 percent for supporting evidence, and so forth. They just stick a number on the whole
thing. That method works fine for the pros, but not for anyone else. To give you a little more
guidance, I’ve divided the grading for each essay into four categories. The categories are
tailored to the specific question you’re answering. Give yourself a number from 0 to 9 for
each category. 
If the score for any essay is below 4, turn to Chapter 17 for additional practice. Also, if you
notice that one type of essay stumped you — say, for example, the synthesis essay — check
out the relevant section of Chapter 16 for the best approach to that sort of essay.
272
Part V: Testing, One, Two . . . Practice Exams 

Choosing a number from 1 to 9
With your sharp eyes, you’ve probably noticed that each item in the checklist has a range of
scores. Here’s how to decide which of the three numbers is best for your essay:
 If you think that your answer almost, but not quite, deserves the next higher cate-
gory: Give yourself the highest number. In other words, if you can glimpse but not
reach the 7–9 slot, give yourself a 6.
 If your answer barely escapes the next lower category: Award yourself the lowest
number. If you hang out in the 4-5-6 slot for a while but it doesn’t seem quite right, go
for a 7. 
 If you’re squarely in one slot: Go for the middle number. If no other category appeals
to you but 4-5-6, take a 5.
Coming up with a final essay score
If you ploughed through all the number-talk in the preceding section, you probably feel as if
you’re taking a math, not an English AP. Never fear: You’re almost finished calculating. Plus,
I provide grids to help you sort everything out. Here’s what to do:
1. Fill in the Essay Scoring Grid for each essay. 
You should end up with four numbers assessing how you answered the question, ana-
lyzed the passage or topic, employed evidence, or conveyed your thoughts to the
reader. (The categories vary slightly depending upon the question you’re answering.)
2. Still using the Essay Scoring Grid, add up your grades for each essay and divide by 4.
The answer is your score for that particular essay. 
3. Complete the Essay Conversion Chart at the end of the chapter. 
Now you know your score for the entire essay section.
Only an essay that does not address the question or is left blank scores a zero. If your essay
is in that sad category, turn to Chapter 16 for some essay-writing help. Then try again.
Scoring Essay One: Synthesis Essay 
on the Internet and Society
The prompt inquires about the effect of the Internet on society. Is it positive or negative, or
something in between? You’ve got six possible sources, including a set of bar graphs — the
“visual source.” Rate your essay by asking these questions:
 Have I communicated a clear point of view? You have to take a position on the
effect of the Internet on society. Mind you, the position doesn’t have to be one-sided.
You can — and most likely should — allow for complexity, explaining both good and
bad effects of the Internet. However, by the end of the first paragraph, the reader
should know where you stand. 
 Have I supported my viewpoint? The question requires you to draw upon at least
three of the six sources, though you can refer to more, if you wish. The information
from the sources should clearly relate to the views you express.
273
Chapter 19: Facing the Music: Checking Practice Exam One

 How complex is my analysis? No, I’m not talking about the type of analysis that involves
a couch and a shrink. I’m talking about interpretation of the data or ideas presented in the
sources. It’s not enough to mention that China has a lot of Internet users. What’s the sig-
nificance of that fact?
 How well have you presented your ideas? Your writing should be organized, coherent,
and reasonably correct in terms of spelling and grammar. Because this is a synthesis
essay, the graders also want to see that you understand what has to be cited and that
you know how to cite sources. (Clear as mud on source citation? Turn to Chapter 13.)
The College Board instructs its graders to give no more than 2 points — not a good score! —
to any essay with enough grammar and spelling errors to distract the reader from the point
the writer is trying to make. If you fall apart in the last category, your scores in the other three
will not raise your grade. (Grammar-challenged? Chapter 7 comes to your rescue.)
Scoring grid for the synthesis essay
Clear point of view _____
0
The essay does not answer the question or is left blank.
1 – 3
The essay simply summarizes the ideas in several sources without taking a recogniza-
ble position on the effect of the Internet on society.
4 – 6
The essay presents a position about the effect of the Internet on society, but the reader
has to work to find it or to understand it. Or the position may be clear but not consis-
tent throughout the essay.
7 – 9
The essay clearly and effectively presents a position on the effect of the Internet on
society.
Evidence _____
1 – 3
The essay repeats information from the sources, but the information selected doesn’t
relate to the central argument of the essay — whether the Internet has helped or hurt
society. The evidence is not drawn from the required minimum of three sources. 
4 – 6
The essay provides evidence, either quoted or referred to indirectly, but these points
are not the most effective choices from the given source material. The evidence may
be linked only weakly to the central argument about the effects of the Internet. 
7 – 9
The evidence is particularly well chosen and is clearly and effectively linked to the
writer’s position on the effects of the Internet. 
Analysis _____
1 – 3
The essay stays on the surface, merely restating information from the sources about
the Internet and its effects. No attempt is made to interpret the data in or to consider
the consequences of a given statement or position. 
4 – 6
The writer goes a little deeper, considering somewhat effectively the meaning of statis-
tics about Internet use or the significance of facts about how the Internet has been
used. Positions taken in the sources are analyzed, though the writer may miss the main
idea or oversimplify the situations described.
7 – 9
The analysis of statistics about Internet use or other facts, as well as the positions
taken in the various sources, are analyzed in depth. The writer demonstates the ability
to understand complex ideas about the effects of the Internet on society.
274
Part V: Testing, One, Two . . . Practice Exams 

Writing _____
1 – 3
The essay may be marred by many errors in grammar, spelling, or punctuation. (Note:
If the essay is hard to read because of these errors, the highest score the essay may
receive overall is a 2.) Citations may be missing or misplaced. The writing may sound
immature, perhaps with choppy or repetitive sentences. The essay may be disorganized.
4 – 6
The writing is competent and reasonably correct, but the structure may be confusing
or the citations may be incorrectly placed. The diction and tone may be uneven. An
essay in this category doesn’t have the fluid, mature sound of an essay in the highest
category.
7 – 9
An essay in this category demonstrates a command of language, the ability to make a
point clearly and concisely. Diction, tone, and structure are handled well. Though the
essay may contain errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, or citation, the errors are
minor and infrequent.

Sample answer A
As McKenna and Bargh report in source B, the terrible events of September 11, 2001
showed both the good and bad effects of the Internet. Between 4 and 5 million people
sent e-mails to each other when the telephone system failed, comforting each other and
checking to see that friends and family had come through without injury. But the
Internet also gave the attackers a “place” to meet and plan their deadly attacks (source
B). The question of the Internet’s effect on society, therefore, is complicated. Overall the
Internet has been an extremely positive development, but only so long as the potential
dangers are taken into account and controlled by authorities.
The Pew Internet and American Life Project found that most adult Americans are on the
Internet, although people over the age of 65 and people who did not finish high school
have less access (source A). Because most Americans now have what Oldenburg calls a
“third place” to meet away from work and home (source E), ideas can be exchanged
freely and people who would never be able to talk in real, personal, face-to-face situa-
tions can potentially become friends. Factors that might become a barrier in person
aren’t important on the Internet, which is “socially unstratified” (source D) and where
275
Chapter 19: Facing the Music: Checking Practice Exam One

“how old you are or what you look like or whether you’re a student, business executive,
or construction worker” doesn’t matter (source D). True, some surveys show that
Internet use can cut the amount of time spent on personal encounters and “can lead
people to spend less time with friends and family” (source C). However, other surveys
point to the opposite trend, reporting “more community and political involvement, as
well as more social contacts” (source C). As people become more used to the Internet,
it is likely that they will find a way to have both personal and Internet contacts.
The level playing field referred to in source D also affects governments. In China, a state
where the government is rather strict and tends to control everything it can, the
Internet is a possible tool for democracy (source F). Yes, the government “actively pur-
sues and then punishes anyone who posts anti-government comments” (source F). But
how can any government check up on 137 million users? It can’t. The “Internet savvy”
(source F) Chinese are probably more educated, and educated people have higher
expectations in life and make more demands. As the Internet becomes even more popu-
lar in China and people who live in rural areas or have less education go online, their
expectations will rise and they will want more say in how their country is run.
Some experts worry that the Internet will create a “sound-bite culture” and encourage
“the violation of privacy” (source E). Television already encourages sound bites, so the
Internet is no different. In fact, because the Internet is under the control of the user, they
can go to many different sites to check up on the facts. Less power is given to television,
and sound-bites may even be lessened by the Internet. Privacy is a problem, but when
you check out at the supermarket or buy a magazine subscription, you already become
part of someone’s database. The Internet isn’t different in that effect. If we want privacy
and more depth in our news and more complex thinking, we have to work for it. The
medium is not responsible. The way we use it is. The attackers of September 11th were
responsible for their actions, not the Internet.
Analysis of sample answer A
This AP test taker did a fairly good job on the synthesis question, though you can easily spot a
few areas for improvement. Take a look at how this essay rates in each of the four categories.
Clear point of view: 6
Right away you know what this writer thinks about the effect of the Internet on society. The
introductory paragraph states that “the Internet has been an extremely positive develop-
ment, but only so long as the potential dangers are taken into account and controlled by
authorities.” Okay, I can hear you asking: If the writer has stated a point of view, why only a
6? The problem is that one part of the statement is never really addressed in the essay. The
essay makes several points about the Internet’s positive effects and a couple of points about
dangers. The idea that “potential dangers” must be “taken into account” and “controlled by
authorities” isn’t developed. The “clear point of view” has to be true of the whole essay, not
just the introduction.
Supporting points: 6
The writer throws in quite a few facts from five of the six sources, noting Internet use in the
United States (source A) and China (source F) and surveys about the effect of the Internet on
life outside the computer (sources C and D). The writer also mentions possible negative
effects and answers those objections (sound-bite culture already exists on television, for
example). However, the comments about negative effects don’t relate to the thesis in para-
graph one, which calls for control by authorities, because the writer points out that the
Internet is just too big for effective monitoring. 
276
Part V: Testing, One, Two . . . Practice Exams 

Analysis: 5
The information presented is analyzed fairly well. The second paragraph, for example,
attempts to explain the significance of the statistics about who uses the Internet, how the
Internet provides a neutral forum, and so forth. Similarly, the writer analyzes the information
about China in paragraph 3. A better essay would go a little further, perhaps discussing the
gap between the educated and noneducated presented by source A and its potential to
create a larger gap in income and experience between those who use the Internet and those
who don’t. 
Writing: 8
This writer tucks the quotations into the text neatly and efficiently and moves well from
point to point. The essay is organized, and the mechanics (grammar, spelling, punctuation)
are good. Why isn’t this a 9? The nine-essay “sings,” in the words of one experienced AP
grader. This essay speaks well, but the song isn’t there.
Overall score: 6
Math time: Add up the four scores 
6 + 6 + 5 + 8 = 25
and divide by 4
25 ÷ 4 = 6.25
which rounds down to 6.
Sample answer B
The Internet is everywhere these days, from school to home to business. You can hardly
find anyone who hasn’t had a chance to buy airline tickets. They also research a report,
or even meet a date by going online. The activity in this computer world has been very
helpful, it is speeding up our transactions and making modern life easier, but some
people don’t have a chance to go on the Internet at all. They’re left out, and they are on
the other side of the “digital divide” (source F). I think the Internet has some good
points and bad points.
As Henry Charles says, people in China may have more chance at democracy because of
the Internet (source F). Because so many people in China are on the net talking to each
other, the government can’t keep track of what everyone is saying. The government
does arrest some people who talk about democracy, but not all of the people. So in the
years to come people in China may get more used to freedom and may have some
demands for their government – they will want freedom!
The Internet is also a place where people meet each other. Not just dating. Ray Oldenburg
says that the Internet is a “third place” (source E) away from home and work where
people make friends. I know when I’m on the Internet, I am part of a virtual reality game
that has thousands of players. I don’t know the people personally, but I feel like I know
them because I spend so much time “talking” to them. Oldenburg thinks that the Internet
can make an elite, make ideologies grow, and have other bad effects (source E). But the
Internet also lets people form new businesses and takes power away from the “traditional
elites” (source E). So overall the effect is positive.
277
Chapter 19: Facing the Music: Checking Practice Exam One

The Internet lets people who have things they like meet each other. About 39000 visitors
to the National Geographic Society Web Site began to talk with each other on the tele-
phone and in person after they met on the web site (source C). But if you spend too
much time on the web, you will probably spend less time with your family and friends
and watching television (source C.
It may be good or bad, but the Internet is not going to go away. It is here to stay, and we
have to get used to it. When you look at source A, you see that most people from age 18
to age 64 are on the Internet in America. Older people aren’t on as much, but they will
probably get onto the net more if someone helps them make the first connection. Also,
people on the net are more educated, so they can have a greater effect on American
society. That also proves my point, that we may as well get used to the internet because
it is permanent.
Analysis of sample answer B
Oh, my. This essay doesn’t do the job on any number of levels. Here’s how it fails in the four
categories.
Clear point of view: 3
The writer of this essay is so muddled that she contradicts herself in the very first para-
graph, stating that “you can hardly find anyone” who’s not on the Internet and then explain-
ing that “some people don’t have the chance to go on the Internet at all.” The thesis seems to
be that “the Internet has some good points and bad points.” Okay, that’s a point of view, but
a vague one. Fence-sitting in argument essays, like fence-sitting in real life, can hurt you if you
don’t do it right! Contrast this thesis statement with the one in sample answer A to see how a
qualified “yes, although” thesis can be handled better. The last paragraph of the essay seems
to contain a different thesis: The Internet is here to stay. Fine, but that’s not what the ques-
tion asked.
Supporting points: 4
The writer refers to four sources, but one reference to source E confuses Oldenburg, who is
mentioned, with the writers of the passage. Also, the writer misread the information about
the National Geographic Society poll. Furthermore, the writer relies heavily on personal expe-
rience, as in the third paragraph when she discusses her participation in an online game. You
don’t have to exclude every bit of personal experience in the synthesis essay, but it should
be a tiny part of the essay. The information in the source material is there for a reason: You
are supposed to use it, and this writer didn’t get much out of the provided material.
Analysis: 3
Here’s the biggest problem in an essay filled with problems. The writer mostly summarized
information from the sources but did not interpret it — an error the AP considers so horrible
that the directions specifically prohibit it. For example, the writer gives some data from source
A, but doesn’t explain why the reader should care that “older people aren’t on as much.” 
Writing: 3
The writing is okay, but the essay rambles from point to point without much of a logical pro-
gression. True, the paragraphs stay mainly on point, but most of the information is just
thrown in without any connections or transitions. The essay has some grammar errors, but it
is readable.
278
Part V: Testing, One, Two . . . Practice Exams 

Overall score: 3
Here you go: Add up the four scores 
3 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 13
and divide by 4
13 ÷ 4 = 3.25
which rounds down to 3.
Scoring Essay Two: Analytical Essay 
on Paul Robeson
The prompt for the second essay asks you to analyze “the rhetorical strategies the author
employs to illuminate influences on Paul Robeson’s character.” So you have two jobs: You
have to figure out what influenced Paul Robeson’s character, and you have to determine
which writing techniques the author — Robeson’s son — used to convey those influences.
Start by asking these questions about your essay:
 Have I answered both parts of the question? An essay that talks only about the influ-
ences on Robeson’s character is only half-finished, as is an essay that discusses the
writing techniques and nothing else.
 How complex is my analysis? An essay that describes the passage (for example, that it
includes a passage from Robeson’s autobiography) doesn’t make the grade. A better
essay explains the significance of the author’s tone or diction or inclusion of anecdotes
and quotations.
 Have I included evidence from the passage? You can’t analyze a piece of writing with-
out quoting from it or referring to it very specifically. 
 Is my essay well written? Is your writing organized and clear? Have you flubbed the
grammar and spelling or aced what English teachers call the “mechanics” of writing.

Analysis _____
1 – 3
The essay stays solely on the surface. Influences on Paul Robeson’s character are
simply listed, with no analysis of what the passage implies. If writing style is men-

4 – 6
The essay offers an interpretation of Robeson’s character. The essay addresses rhetori-
cal strategies style fairly well, but does not relate style to content in a meaningful way. 
7 – 9
The essay digs into the text, unearthing and exploring the factors that shaped Paul
Robeson’s character. The author’s writing style is analyzed in depth and clearly linked
to content.
Evidence _____
1 – 3
The writer makes only general statements with no or very few specific references to
the text.
4 – 6
The writer’s interpretation is supported by some references to the text. The references
may not be the best or most sophisticated choices. Some quotations may be overly
long, too short, or not supportive of the writer’s point. 
7 – 9
The writer provides strong support for his or her interpretations by choosing specific
and relevant evidence from the text. Quotations are excerpted so that the point is
made clearly and concisely.
Writing _____
1 – 3
The essay is disorganized or filled with distracting grammar and spelling errors.
Transitions between one point and another are awkward or missing entirely.
4 – 6
The essay has a logical structure. The writer’s thesis (main idea) and supporting points
are easily defined. The writing does not always flow smoothly or may contain repetitive
or wordy statements. Quotations are inserted awkwardly.
7 – 9
The essay demonstrates clear, fluid style with a good command of language. The essay
moves from a clear thesis through supporting points, each accompanied by evidence,
to a logical conclusion.

Sample answer A
Paul Robeson grew up to be a civil rights activist, and from the very beginning, he was
surrounded by people who cared about justice. Paul was too young to know about his
brother’s rejection from Princeton University, but he must have been influenced by his
father, William Drew Robeson, who protested the rejection and demanded a response
from the president of Princeton, Woodrow Wilson. Paul must have heard, throughout his
childhood, how his father preached and how he protested. William Drew is described as
having “dramatic power and inspiring messages”, and the author mentions William’s
“determined criticism of social justice.”
The excerpt also mentions a black congressman, George C. White, who lost his election
because of “electoral rigging.” This second example of racial injustice also took place
when Paul was little. Though he could not have understood it at the time, the congress-
man’s statement that there was only a “temporary farewell to the American Congress”
from blacks turned out to be true. The hope expressed by George C. White was justified,
and Paul probably picked up some hope from White too.
After the information about William Drew Robeson and George White, the author turns
to William’s career in his later years. William drew carried ashes and sometimes other
things in order to earn a living. However, he was always dignified and respectable. Paul
must have understood that a man should behave with dignity no matter what happens,
because that’s what his father always did. The excerpt from Paul Robeson’s autobiogra-
phy emphasizes the father’s dignity and gives the reader Paul’s own words, which
makes his personality come alive.
The essay also spends some time talking about Paul Robeson’s brother, the one who
couldn’t go to Princeton. Paul must have understood that you shouldn’t give up, even
when things don’t go well, because his brother didn’t give up after Princeton rejected
him. Instead, Bill went to another college and to medical school. Bill taught Paul how to
play football. It says in the introduction to the excerpt that Robeson was an athlete. Bill
taught Paul how to be an athlete.
The writing style of this passage is very clear. The author uses little stories about Bill
and William to make his point. The author also brings in a quotation as evidence and to
allow the reader to hear Paul “in person.” All these things make you see how Paul grew
up and what influenced him.
Analysis of sample answer A
This essay has quite a few holes in it, making it at best a below-average effort. Now for the
details.
Addresses the question: 3
This essay talks about the content of the passage, listing several elements: Bill’s rejection
from Princeton and William Drew’s demand for answers from Wilson, William Drew’s dis-
missal from his church, the statement of George C. White to congress, William’s work as an
ash collector, his son’s autobiography, and the sports skills that Bill taught Paul. However,
the essay says almost nothing about how the passage is written other than a short list in the
last paragraph.
Analysis: 2
The essay attempts a little psychological analysis, trying to draw a line from William Drew’s
protest to Paul’s activism, for example. However, the essay doesn’t discuss the effects of the
author’s rhetorical devices — the writing techniques employed — and makes very little use
of the information presented about Robeson’s family or the time in which he grew up. 
281
Chapter 19: Facing the Music: Checking Practice Exam One

Evidence: 2
The essay pulls in some evidence in the form of brief quotations, but they don’t make much
of a case for any particular rhetorical strategy. The essay calls the passage “clear” without
giving any examples. 
Writing: 3
The writing isn’t terrible, though the essay has a few grammar errors and at one point calls
the passage an “essay” instead of a biography. The essay has a reasonable structure, moving
more or less chronologically through the passage and then making a couple of basic points
about writing style in the last paragraph. Nevertheless, this essay is a long way from a
mature, AP-level effort.
Overall score: 3
Here’s how to calculate the score for the sample A. First, add up the four scores:
3 + 2 +2 + 3 = 10
and divide by 4:
10 ÷ 4 = 2.5 
which rounds up to 3.
Sample answer B
Paul Robeson’s life as a civil rights activist undoubtedly had many roots, chief among
them the examples from his own family and the terribly unfair era in which he grew up.
In this excerpt from a biography of Robeson, written by his own son, the author paints a
picture of a determined father, a loving and helpful brother, and a son who appreciated
both. The author also includes an anecdote about a black congressman who loses his
election because of “electoral rigging” and who prophesizes, correctly, that blacks will
overcome and return to Congress.
The author’s chief strategy is anecdote. First he presents the anecdote about Bill’s rejec-
tion from Princeton and then one about William Drew’s dismissal from his church. Next
there is an anecdote about George C. White, and finally a bit of description of William
Drew’s life after his dismissal and Paul’s interaction with his brother. The anecdotes are
the kind of family history that gets passed down from one generation to another.
Although Paul was only two when Bill was not allowed to enroll in Princeton, one can
imagine that the Robeson family often told and retold that little story as a moral lesson
to Paul. Is it a surprise that he became an activist for civil rights? The story of George C.
White is from the world outside the Robeson family. This widens the scope of the pas-
sage and shows the influence of the climate in the United States when Robeson was
growing up. Although the White story isn’t the kind that gets passed down within a
family, it does show what Paul had to deal with when he wasn’t in the family home. (The
dismissal of his father was probably only one injustice that Paul witnessed personally.)
The author’s diction also reveals a lot about Paul Robeson’s early influences. Reverend
Robeson didn’t just ask Wilson for an explanation of his son’s rejection; he “refused to
accept” Wilson’s attempt to avoid a confrontation. William Drew is described as “refus-
ing as usual to compromise on matters of principle.” The words “refused” and “refusing”
hammer home the point that William Drew was a strong man, as was his son. Other
282
Part V: Testing, One, Two . . . Practice Exams 

words associated with William Drew in this passage include “defiance,” “dramatic
power,” and “determined criticism of social injustice.” These are forceful words for a
forceful man, who raised a forceful son.
Another element of style in this passage is the long quotation from Paul Robeson’s autobi-
ography. There the fruit of his father’s strength comes across clearly. Paul describes his
father as “dignified” and says that “no man carried himself with greater pride.” He tells of
his father’s hard work and then notes that “mostly I played.” His father’s struggles allowed
the son to have a happy childhood — something the quotation emphasizes. Even within
the quotation, there is an anecdote. The anecdote tells about Paul’s lessons in football,
when Bill taught his “how to tackle a man so he stayed tackled.” Again, strength is empha-
sized, and that strength carried Paul Robeson to his work in civil rights.
Analysis of sample answer B
Now you’re talking AP-level work! This essay is a winner.
Addresses the question: 8
This essay addresses the question very well; it stays on topic and goes right to the point
about the factors that influenced Paul Robeson’s development. The essay also addresses the
way in which the passage is written — the rhetorical strategies employed by the author. 
Analysis: 8
Sample answer B does a fine job explaining what’s going on in the passage. The essay talks
about the anecdotes, diction, and quotation and explains what each contributes to the pas-
sage. These elements of writing are discussed in relation to the content of the passage, and
everything is tied to Paul Robeson’s character.
Evidence: 7
The essay uses quotations fairly effectively, especially in the paragraph about diction. A few
more quotations might have been helpful, but this writer knows how to make a point and
back it up from the passage. 
Writing: 8
This exam-taker created a logical structure and shows a good, though not excellent, com-
mand of language. The point about George C. White is made in two places; combining these
points in one spot would have been better. The essay has very few mechanical problems
(errors in grammar) but not enough for a trip to the garage.
Overall score: 8
The arithmetic (unlike the average AP question) is easy. Add up the four scores:
8 + 8 + 7 + 8 = 31
divide by 4 
31÷ 4 = 7.75
which rounds up to 8.

Scoring Essay Three: Leadership
This sort of essay is a prompt because you don’t have to read anything (except the prompt,
of course). However, as the Trojans who accepted a giant wooden horse from their enemies,
the Greeks (and later were vanquished by the soldiers hidden inside the horse), this prompt
comes with a trap. You have to unearth information that doesn’t appear on the test in order
to answer this question. And of course, in the heat of the AP, all the brain cells holding infor-
mation about literature, history, or your own life may be frozen. I’m assuming you managed
to thaw out a couple. To rate your answer, ask yourself these questions:
 Have I answered the question? First you need to explain what quality you see as
essential to leadership. If you differ from Maurois, no problem. You can acknowledge
and respond to Maurois’s ideas, but most of your energy should go toward proving
your own case, not demolishing Maurois’s. 
 Have I provided supporting points? If you selected “really cute hair” as the essential
leader-quality, you have to make a case for that characteristic. The case consists of rea-
sons why “really cute hair” is important.
 Have I included evidence? Going with the “cute hair” example, you might discuss
Mao’s receding hairline as a leadership flaw or explain why recent presidential candi-
dates didn’t make the grade because of frizz or bald spots.
 Is my essay well written? Check structure, organization, clarity, grammar, spelling,
punctuation.
Because this is an open-ended question, I can’t even imagine which quality of leadership you
chose to write about. The sample answers here will help you score your own effort, but keep
in mind that it’s possible to differ greatly from those samples and still do well on this ques-
tion. Be extra careful applying the general guidelines to your own work.
Scoring grid for the leadership essay
Addresses the question _____
0
The essay does not answer the question or is left blank.
1 – 3
The essay partially answers the question. For example, an essay that proves Maurois
wrong and hints at other important leadership qualities is in this slot. So is an essay
that contains a lot of off-topic material, straying from leadership into, for example,
techniques to identify leadership.
4 – 6
The essay answers the question by choosing the important leadership quality but
buries that fact in a mass of detail or generalites. Key rule: You don’t want to have to
read the thing twice to find the thesis. An essay in this category may contain some off-
topic material, but not much.
7 – 9
The essay chooses the most important leadership quality and stays focused on it.
Supporting points ______
1 – 3
The essay provides few reasons other than “I think so” for the chosen leadership qual-
ity. Or the essay muddles all the arguments for the most important leadership quality
into one undifferentiated mass.
4 – 6
The essay contains two or three reasons why the chosen leadership quality is essen-
tial. The reasons are only loosely linked to the leadership quality.
7 – 9
The essay identifies three or four reasons why the chosen leadership quality is the
most important. Each reason is strongly and logically tied to leadership.
284
Part V: Testing, One, Two . . . Practice Exams 

Evidence ______
1 – 3
The essay contains few or no examples from history, literature, or personal experience
to back up the claim that a particular quality is most important in a leader. Or the
examples are poorly explained.
4 – 6
The essay contains a couple of solid examples from history, literature, or personal
experience. The examples are fairly well explained but could be discussed at greater
length or in greater detail.
7 – 9
An essay in this slot has very good examples of the chosen leadership quality. Each
example clearly shows why the quality is essential.
Writing _____
1 – 3
The essay is disorganized, hopping from one idea to another or repeating something
already stated. Or the essay has many distracting errors in grammar and spelling.
4 – 6
The essay is fairly well written, with a logical structure and some — but not many —
mechanical errors. The writing sounds less polished than an essay in the next higher
category.
7 – 9
Essays in this slot sound mature. The sentences vary in length and pattern, the diction
and tone are consistent, and the logical structure of the argument is easy to follow.

Sample answer A
Andre Maurois said that “The most important quality in a leader is that of being acknowl-
edged as such.” Maurois’s comment is practical. What use is a leader if no one is following.
But sometimes a leader’s followers take a long time to emerge – even after the leader’s
death. Also, sometimes a small number of people follow a particular leader, and a great
many people reject him or her. The number isn’t necessarily crucial to leadership, because
a committed group with a dedicated leader can change the world. Therefore, to judge a
leader by his or her acceptance is a good standard, so long as that standard isn’t applied
too narrowly. 
The former mayor of my town was, I believe, a very good leader, even though he served
only one term and was strongly defeated by the current mayor in the last election.
Why did the former mayor lose? He had a lot of great ideas — he really cared about the
285
Chapter 19: Facing the Music: Checking Practice Exam One

environment, for example, and he pushed for many regulations to create a “greener”
town government. Under his leadership, stores had to ask you whether you wanted a
bag or not, and recycling went to a whole new level, with large fines for unrecycled
trash. Of course this made him many enemies in the business community, because their
only concern was profit. Did this make the mayor less of a leader? I don’t think he could
have convinced the business owners to like him or to reelect him, and he wasn’t their
leader. But he did inspire my grade to press for “good-on-one-side” printing paper (reused
scrap paper) and biodegradable lunch containers. He was our leader, even if he lost the
election, and the ideas he put into place will last for generations and even be extended.
There are more people in my high school who followed the former mayor than in the busi-
ness community. So by numbers, and by impact, the mayor fits Maurois’ definition.
History has many examples of leaders who were acknowledged by some people, though
maybe not by enough, during their lifetimes. Rachel Carson, for example, wrote about
“the silent spring” that would happen when pesticides had killed too many animals and
plants. She wrote in the 1920s, and not many people paid attention to her. However,
many years later, in the present time, she is now seen as a visionary. Was Rachel Carson
a leader. I think she was. Another person who became a leader only later was Betty
Friedan, the author of The Feminine Mistique. She described the way that women were
limited by their roles as housewifes, and advocated for more power and equality for
women. Her ideas in the 1950s weren’t really accepted, but now they are. Friedan was a
leader too.
Andre Maurois was only partially right in his definition of leadership. He should have
said more to define “acknowledged.” Once the definition of “acknowledged” is widened,
you can include more true leaders in that category. Your influence can go on even in the
face of opposition and sometimes even after you die, if you are a true leader.
Analysis of sample answer A
This is a fairly good essay, by a writer who has some complexity in his thinking. Yes, the
essay isn’t perfect, but the writer has conveyed his ideas and made a case for his definition
of leadership. Now for the details.
Addresses the question: 7
The writer accepts Maurois’ idea about leadership but qualifies it a little. The introductory
paragraph says it all: “to judge a leader by his or her acceptance is a good standard, so long
as that standard isn’t applied too narrowly.” The essay stays on this topic throughout.
Supporting points: 6
The writer has two supporting points: (1) sometimes a leader is recognized only later and
(2) a leader may be recognized by some but not all people and still be effective. Not bad!
I wouldn’t mind seeing one other supporting point, perhaps about the way acknowledgment
is measured — by re-election? by bills passed? by lives changed? Still, two good supporting
points are present in this essay.
Evidence: 6
The examples of the mayor, Rachel Carson, and Betty Friedan are all good, though the writer
has a couple of facts wrong. (For example, Carson didn’t write in the 1920s!) The AP graders,
fortunately, are told to recognize that writers can’t check their facts in the middle of an exam.
Happily for you, mistaking a date won’t hurt your score. The example of the mayor is more
fleshed out than the other two examples. A little more on Carson and Friedan would have
raised this score.
286
Part V: Testing, One, Two . . . Practice Exams 

Writing: 6
The essay is reasonably well written. The writer has made a couple of spelling errors
(mystique, not mistique, for example), and some of the sentences are awkward. The last
paragraph is not as polished as the first, probably because the writer was tiring.
Overall score: 6
To calculate the overall score for the leadership essay, add the four scores
7 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 25
and divide by 4
25 ÷ 4 = 6.25
which rounds down to 6.
Sample answer B
“The most important quality in a leader is that of being acknowledged as such.” That’s
what Andree Marois said, but he was wrong. The most important quality in a leader is
honesty. If you aren’t honest, you can’t be a leader. Case closed. Maybe you will have
some success for a while, but then you will fail. To prove this point, look at King Claudius
in Hamlet, which was written by William Shakespeare, and many other literary works.
Also, think about the people you have known who have been honest or dishonest.
Claudius was Hamlet’s uncle, and he became king because he murdered Hamlet, the old
king who had the same name as the character who is the most important one in the
play. Claudius murdered the king because he wanted to take over the throne and also
marry Gertrude, Hamlet’s mother, who loved her husband but was fooled by him and
ultimately died because of him. Claudius in the first act seems to be doing okay as a
leader, but pretty soon you see the cracks in his facade. He says that he can’t repent of
his actions without giving up the kingship and his wife, so he doesn’t repent, and in the
end Hamlet killed him. Gertrude dies when she drinks from a poisoned cup, which
Claudius had ready to kill Hamlet (the son). Was Claudius a leader? For a little while he
is in charge, but he isn’t really a leader because no one likes him, and no one likes him
because he wasn’t honest. He started and ended with murder.
Other literary works show characters who try to be leaders but who aren’t honest, and
then they aren’t really leaders. In Great Expectations written by Charles Dickens, Uncle
Pumblechook wants to be the important leader in the neighborhood, but he fails because
he claims to have made Pip a gentleman and to have liked him all along, even though
really he was mean to Pip when Pip was little. Uncle Pumblechook isn’t a leader because
he lies. In Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston, Joe Starks thinks he is
the leader of the town just because of his store and his position as mayor, but he tries too
hard to control Janey and loses her to Tea Cake. Joe isn’t a real leader either.
In my family, one of my uncles always wants to be the leader. He was the first to start a
business, and he has done well. At dinners on holidays, he is the one to say when we are
finished or what the topic of conversation will be. But then we found out that he had
taken some money from my grandmother after she died without sharing it equally with
his brother and sisters. So he isn’t a leader, we don’t listen to what he has to say.
287
Chapter 19: Facing the Music: Checking Practice Exam One

Analysis of sample answer B
Not the best effort, though I feel for the writer stuck with a self-righteous but crooked uncle.
Here’s the breakdown.
Addresses the question: 3
The writer takes a stab at defining leadership, choosing honesty as the crucial quality. So far,
so good. The essay wanders into all sorts of off-topic paths — murder, for example — and
spends far too much time summarizing plot.
Supporting points: 2
The writer doesn’t really explain why honesty is the most important quality of a leader. She
might have said, for example, that dishonest leaders eventually find themselves in disgrace
(or in jail!). She could have discussed the way that people relate to leaders and how honesty
facilitates that relationship. The essay has several examples (see “Evidence,” below) but no
real support for the idea of honesty as a crucial component of leadership.
Evidence: 4
The examples of Claudius and the uncle are reasonable, though the discussion of Claudius
has way too much plot summary and not enough commentary on Claudius as leader. The
catch-all paragraph about Dickens and Hurston is not very helpful. Yes, the writer shows that
Uncle Pumblechook (isn’t that a great name?) is a liar, but what does that have to do with
leadership? The comments about Hurston are even more problematic because Joe’s wish to
hold onto his wife has little to do with leadership.
Writing: 4
This essay, if it were a boat, would be leaking from several spots but not quite sinking. The
points the writer wants to make are conveyed with some errors but reasonable clarity.
Overall score: 3
To calculate the overall score for the leadership essay, add the four scores
3 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 13
and divide by 4
13 ÷ 4 = 3.25
which rounds down to 3.

Taking Another Stab at It: 
Practice Exam Two
In This Chapter
 Refining your testing skills with a second practice exam
 Learning to pace yourself
I
f you’re working through this book in the usual way — from front to back — this chapter
is your second stab at a full-length practice exam. Chapter 21 provides answers and
explanations. (If you’re an eccentric who likes to work backwards, good for you! The world
needs more variety, and this exam is a fine starting point also.)
Before you begin this exam, read the general directions for how to gear up for the exam in
Chapter 18, which contains Practice Exam One. Those directions help you simulate real AP
conditions. After all, the point of devoting three-plus boring hours to an exam (not counting
time spent checking your work) is to help you fine-tune your AP tactics, and you can’t do so
unless you follow AP procedures. So sharpen your pencil, set the timer, and attack these
questions. Good luck!
The AP Language and Composition Test
This test consists of two parts:
Section One: Multiple choice — one hour
Section Two: Essays — fifteen-minute reading period plus two hours for writing
At any time you may write in the margins of the exam, annotating as you wish. However,
nothing but the scoring grid and the essay answer sheets will be graded. Answers or remarks
written next to the question receive no credit. During the fifteen-minute reading period, you
may not write on the answer sheet.

Section One: Multiple Choice
294
Part V: Testing, One, Two . . . Practice Exams 
Time: 60 minutes
This section contains five selections, each of which is followed by a set of questions. Section One
has a total of 53 questions and counts as 45 percent of the exam score. 
You have one hour for this section. Work carefully and quickly. Not all students will finish the multi-
ple choice questions. Blank answers receive no credit; one-quarter point is deducted for each wrong
answer. 
Do not turn to another section if you finish early.
For each multiple-choice question, choose the best answer. Fill in the corresponding oval, being sure
to darken the entire oval. Do not select more than one answer. If you erase an answer, take care to do
so completely. Questions with more than one answer are automatically scored as wrong.
Questions 1–10 are based on the following passage, which is a letter written by Pliny, an
ancient Roman writer, lawyer, and philosopher, to a friend. Read the letter carefully and
answer the questions following it.
To SOCIUS SENECIO:
This year has produced a plentiful crop of poets: during the whole month of April scarcely a
day has passed on which we have not been entertained with the recital of some poem. It is a
pleasure to me to find that a taste for polite literature still exists, and that men of genius do
come forward and make themselves known, notwithstanding the lazy attendance they got for
their pains. The greater part of the audience sit in the lounging-places, gossip away their
time there, and are perpetually sending to enquire whether the author has made his entrance
yet, whether he has got through the preface, or whether he has almost finished the piece.
Then at length they saunter in with an air of the greatest indifference, nor do they conde-
scend to stay through the recital, but go out before it is over, some slyly and stealthily,
others again with perfect freedom and unconcern. And yet our fathers can remember how
Claudius Caesar, walking one day in the palace, and hearing a great shouting, enquired the
cause: and being informed that Nonianus was reciting a composition of his, went immedi-
ately to the place, and agreeably surprised the author with his presence. But now, were one
to bespeak the attendance of the idlest man living, and remind him of the appointment ever
so often, or ever so long beforehand; either he would not come at all, or if he did would
grumble about having “lost a day!” for no other reason but because he had not lost it. So
much the more do those authors deserve our encouragement and applause who have resolu-
tion to persevere in their studies, and to read out their compositions in spite of this apathy
or arrogance on the part of their audience. Myself indeed, I scarcely ever miss being present
upon any occasion; though, to tell the truth, the authors have generally been friends of mine,
as indeed there are few men of literary tastes who are not. It is this which has kept me in
town longer than I had intended. I am now, however, at liberty to go back into the country,
and write something myself; which I do not intend reciting, lest I should seem rather to have
lent than given my attendance to these recitations of my friends, for in these, as in all other
good offices, the obligation ceases the moment you seem to expect a return.
Farewell.

Directions for questions 11–20: Read this excerpt from The Souls of Black Folk, a book of
essays by W. E .B. DuBois. Then answer questions 11–20.
In a wee wooden schoolhouse, something put it into the boys’ and girls’ heads to buy gor-
geous visiting-cards — ten cents a package — and exchange. The exchange was merry, till
one girl, a tall newcomer, refused my card, — refused it peremptorily, with a glance. Then it
dawned upon me with a certain suddenness that I was different from the others; or like,
mayhap, in heart and life and longing, but shut out from their world by a vast veil. I had
thereafter no desire to tear down that veil, to creep through; I held all beyond it in common
contempt, and lived above it in a region of blue sky and great wandering shadows. That sky
was bluest when I could beat my mates at examination-time, or beat them at a foot-race, or
even beat their stringy heads. Alas, with the years all this fine contempt began to fade; for
the words I longed for, and all their dazzling opportunities, were theirs, not mine. But they
should not keep these prizes, I said; some, all, I would wrest from them. Just how I would do
it I could never decide: by reading law, by healing the sick, by telling the wonderful tales that
swam in my head,— some way. With other black boys the strife was not so fiercely sunny:
their youth shrunk into tasteless sycophancy, or into silent hatred of the pale world about
them and mocking distrust of everything white; or wasted itself in a bitter cry, why did God
make me an outcast and a stranger in mine own house? The shades of the prison-house
closed round about us all: walls strait and stubborn to the whitest, but relentlessly narrow,
tall, and unscalable to sons of night who must plod darkly on in resignation, or beat unavail-
ing palms against the stone, or steadily, half hopelessly, watch the streak of blue above.
After the Egyptian and Indian, the Greek and Roman, the Teuton and Mongolian, the Negro is
a sort of seventh son, born with a veil, and gifted with second-sight in this American world,—
a world which yields him no true self-consciousness, but only lets him see himself through
the revelation of the other world. It is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this
sense of always looking at one’s self through the eyes of others, of measuring one’s soul by
the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity. One ever feels his twoness,—
an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring
ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.
The history of the American Negro is the history of this strife,— this longing to attain self-
conscious manhood, to merge his double self into a better and truer self. In this merging he
wishes neither of the older selves to be lost. He would not Africanize America, for America
has too much to teach the world and Africa. He would not bleach his Negro soul in a flood of
white Americanism, for he knows that Negro blood has a message for the world. He simply

Directions for questions 21–30: After carefully reading the passage below, answer questions
21–30.
The personal character and career of one man are so intimately connected with the great
scheme of the years 1719 and 1720, that a history of the Mississippi madness can have no
fitter introduction than a sketch of the life of its great author John Law. Historians are divided
in opinion as to whether they should designate him a knave or a madman. Both epithets were
unsparingly applied to him in his lifetime, and while the unhappy consequences of his proj-
ects were still deeply felt. Posterity, however, has found reason to doubt the justice of the
accusation, and to confess that John Law was neither knave nor madman, but one more
deceived than deceiving, more sinned against than sinning. He was thoroughly acquainted
with the philosophy and true principles of credit. He understood the monetary question
better than any man of his day; and if his system fell with a crash so tremendous, it was not so
much his fault as that of the people amongst whom he had erected it. He did not calculate
upon the avaricious frenzy of a whole nation; he did not see that confidence, like mistrust,
could be increased almost ad infinitum, and that hope was as extravagant as fear. How was he
to foretell that the French people, like the man in the fable, would kill, in their frantic eager-
ness, the fine goose he had brought to lay them so many golden eggs? His fate was like that
which may be supposed to have overtaken the first adventurous boatman who rowed from
Erie to Ontario. Broad and smooth was the river on which he embarked; rapid and pleasant
was his progress; and who was to stay him in his career? Alas for him, the cataract was nigh.
He saw, when it was too late, that the tide which wafted him so joyously along was a tide of
destruction; and when he endeavoured to retrace his way, he found that the current was too
strong for his weak efforts to stem, and that he drew nearer every instant to the tremendous
falls. Down he went over the sharp rocks, and the waters with him. He was dashed to pieces
with his bark, but the waters, maddened and turned to foam by the rough descent, only boiled
and bubbled for a time, and then flowed on again as smoothly as ever. Just so it was with Law
and the French people. He was the boatman, and they were the waters.

John Law was born at Edinburgh in the year 1671. His father was the younger son of an
ancient family in Fife, and carried on the business of a goldsmith and banker. He amassed
considerable wealth in his trade, sufficient to enable him to gratify the wish, so common
among his countrymen, of adding a territorial designation to his name. He purchased with
this view the estates of Lauriston and Randleston, on the Frith of Forth1, on the borders of
West and Mid Lothian2, and was thenceforth known as Law of Lauriston. The subject of our
memoir, being the eldest son, was received into his father’s counting-house at the age of four-
teen, and for three years laboured hard to acquire an insight into the principles of banking as
then carried on in Scotland. He had always manifested great love for the study of numbers,
and his proficiency in the mathematics was considered extraordinary in one of his tender
years. At the age of seventeen he was tall, strong, and well made; and his face, although
deeply scarred with the small-pox, was agreeable in its expression, and full of intelligence.
At this time he began to neglect his business, and becoming vain of his person, indulged in
considerable extravagance of attire. He was a great favourite with the ladies, by whom he
was called Beau Law; while the other sex, despising his foppery3, nicknamed him Jessamy
John. At the death of his father, which happened in 1688, he withdrew entirely from the desk,
which had become so irksome, and being possessed of the revenues of the paternal estate of
Lauriston, he proceeded to London, to see the world.

Directions for questions 31–43. The passage below is excerpted from Gandhi: A Life, by
Yogesh Chadha (Wiley, 1997; reprinted with permission of John Wiley & Sons, Inc.). The
events described take place in 1930 when Mohandas K. Gandhi, a leader of the nonviolent
protest movement attempting to free India, then a British colony, led a group of marchers to
the sea coast to protest the Salt Tax. Gandhi’s plan was to extract salt from the sea, an illegal
act, and to accept the ensuing punishment. 
Gandhi marched at the head of the procession like a conqueror. Behind him the administra-
tion was silently crumbling as scores of village headmen resigned. On his arrival at Borsad on
18 March, large-scale resignations by village administrators were announced. Gandhi reiter-
ated the significance of this noncooperation to the assembled crowd:
Today we are defying the salt law. Tomorrow we shall have to consign other laws
to the waste-paper basket. Doing so we shall practise such severe non-coopera-
tion that finally it will not be possible for the administration to be carried out at
all. Let the government then, to carry on its rules, use guns against us, send us to
prison, hang us. But how many can be given such punishment? Try and calculate
how much time it will take of Britishers to hang three hundred million of persons.1

The spectacle of this sixty-year-old man, staff in hand, striding vigorously along the dusty
roads of India with his khadi-clad followers, to challenge peacefully the mighty British
Empire, aroused the interest and sympathy of millions all over the world. “For me there is no
turning back, whether I am alone or joined by thousands,” he declared. “I would rather die
a dog’s death and have my bones licked by dogs than that I should return to the ashram a
broken man.”2 In the course of his speech at Navsari a few days later, he proclaimed: “I shall
return with what I want or my dead body will float in the ocean.” 3
At first the authorities expected the salt march to fizzle out but when the tempo began to
increase and the movement to spread, the Bombay government sought to persuade Lord
Irwin to take action against Gandhi. The Viceroy was not in favor of Gandhi’s arrest, though
he knew he would have to act eventually. He was marking time, for he was more inclined to
rely on the reports of his agents and advisers than on those in the world press, which was
being fed by Indian nationalist sources. “The will-power of the man must have been enor-
mous to get him through his march,” he wrote to the Secretary of State for India a few days
later. “I was always told that his blood pressure is dangerous and his heart none too good,
and I was also told a few days ago that his horoscope predicts that he will die this year, and
that is the explanation of this desperate throw. It would be a very happy solution.” 4 This was
a rather harsh verdict, coming from a Viceroy who regarded himself as a man of principle. In
any event Lord Irwin’s sources of information were grossly inaccurate since they were prima-
rily based on rumors.
Meanwhile the villagers joined the column as it surged on, and when on 5 April, after a march
of twenty-four days, it reached the sea coast at Dandi, the original group of seventy-nine had
swelled to thousands. Among them were many women — not only the poor, but wealthy
ladies from the cities. Asked what he hoped to achieve by breaking the salt laws, Gandhi
answered: “I want world sympathy in this battle of Right against Might.” 5

Money: The Odyssey of an Average Investor by John Rothchild (Wiley, 1998; reprinted with
permission of John Wiley & Sons, Inc.) and answer questions 44–54. 
What used to be known as acquaintances, relatives, children, husbands, and wives have all
become investments. A few years ago — though I’m not certain when — we began calling
children “our investments in the future.” Soon we found ourselves investing in their educa-
tion, which used to be called putting them through school.  Some people invest in relation-
ships, as opposed to just having friends over for dinner. My wife, of course, is a perpetual
investment, as I am to her. It’s possible to invest in pets and sell the offspring, though I doubt
we could pay anybody to take our cats. Lately I’ve begun to think of the hereafter as the
Keough Plan and life after death as the tax-deferred IRA. Once I regarded my car as simple
transportation, and now it is a depreciated holding. The roof over our heads has become an
inflation hedge, next-to-useless in a deflationary cycle. Every other week we’re debating
whether to sell out or stay, whether to refinance or hold out for lower rates, whether to rent
the place and move into something with a bigger mortgage-interest deduction. 
The dining room table is a fixed asset; the dishes set down upon it are collectibles. The smart
money, I realize now, would have divested the dishes in the early 1980s, when collectibles
were at a premium, and gone into paper plates. The last spike in silver prices destroyed all
feelings of loyalty for the family flatware, which now serves only as a reminder of our missed
opportunity to cash in at $41 an ounce. Ditto the silver backgammon cube, which I trans-
ported to the safe-deposit box but which is no longer worth protecting.

The silver samovar is corroded, but we maintain it in spite of no sign of inflation. Its ultimate
purpose may depend on whether the Federal Reserve continues to lower the discount rate.
Looking through our closets, I see dozens of examples of poor market timing, things that
were bought too early or held too long: the $2000 Apple computer in the former category, the
art deco water pitchers in the latter. The old train set and the baseball cards thrown away
long ago by mistake once had sentimental value, but since prices of such items are now
common knowledge, I now remember them as hundreds of dollars lost in the restructuring of
my childhood closet. 
A couch was once a place on which to sit, and a chest of drawers a place in which to put
things, but these, too, have evolved into collectibles — the claw marks, the jelly stains, the
rips, the tears, the broken handles, the gouges in the record cabinet, the scratches in the
marble table, the mildew spots on stuffed armchairs left outside in the rain are no longer
simple repair jobs. They’re threats to the bottom line, and a great deal more fuss is made
over mishaps these days.
Our clothes are a continual source of fiscal disappointment, especially during frequent catas-
trophes when they are soiled, ripped, or otherwise damaged. Having spaghetti dumped in
one’s lap is the dinner-party equivalent of a 30 percent drop in a stock or the cancellation of a
dividend. The same can be said for high heels that are sheared off by a hidden sprinkler head.
Since clothes have become investments, many of the hand-me-down items that we once kept
in paper bags for Halloween costumes or used as car rags are now hung in the closets. This
includes old Pucci dresses and houndstooth coats too big in the shoulders, feather boas
worn by relatives from cafe society, discarded kilts from Scottish festivals, Hawaiian shirts
retained since college, scarves, trout vests, riding jodhpurs, and smocks from Panamanian
molas. Someday, we assure ourselves, there’ll be a bull market in molas.
Have we just gotten greedy, or have we been forced into it: routed from our passbooks by
fantastic opportunities; lured by the irresistible increases in the price of gold, silver, grandfa-
ther clocks; convinced that it is highly speculative not to speculate; millions of us and our
loose cash, wandering from chance to chance, desperate for good advice yet almost always
confused; our net worth vacillating with the monetary system, the fiscal system, the balance
of trade; our futures papers in CATS funds and zero-coupon bonds; our very daily moods tied
to the discount rates. Is it possible not to be financially obsessed? I find time for little else.

The Question: It is widely agreed that the media has power to influence children. However,
controversy surrounds the extent of that power and what, if any, restrictions should be
placed upon the media in order to promote children’s well-being. Should government play
a role? Should the media self-regulate? Are parents to take full responsibility? After reading
the following sources carefully, develop a position regarding freedom and regulation of the
media, taking children’s well-being into account. Then write an essay in which you support
your position with references to these sources.

“Children, Violence, and the Media: A Report for Parents and Policy Makers,” prepared by the
Majority Staff of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 9/14/99.
Americans have grown increasingly alarmed about youth violence. Far too many of our chil-
dren are killing and harming others. This report identifies and begins to redress one of the
principal causes of youth violence: media violence. . . .
It has been estimated that more than 1000 studies on the effects of television and film vio-
lence have been done during the past 40 years. In the last decade, the American Medical
Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Child and
Adolescent Psychiatry, and the National Institutes of Mental Health have separately reviewed
many of these studies. Each of these reviews has reached the same conclusion: television
violence leads to real-world violence. The National Institute of Mental Health reported that
“television violence is as strongly correlated with aggressive behavior as any variable that
has been measured.” A comprehensive study conducted by the Surgeon General’s Office in
1972, and updated in 1982, found television violence a contributing factor to increases in vio-
lent crime and antisocial behavior; a 1984 US Attorney General’s Task Force study on family
violence revealed that viewing television violence contributed to acting-out violence in the
home; and recently, the National Television Violence Study, a 3-year project that examined
the depiction of violent behavior across more than 8200 programs, concluded that televised
violence teaches aggressive attitudes and behaviors, desensitization to violence, and
increased fear of becoming victimized by violence. The majority of the existing social and
behavioral science studies, taken together, agree on the following basic points: (1) constant
viewing of televised violence has negative effects on human character and attitudes; (2) tele-
vision violence encourages violent forms of behavior and influences moral and social values
about violence in daily life; (3) children who watch significant amounts of television violence
have a greater likelihood of exhibiting later aggressive behavior; (4) television violence
affects viewers of all ages, intellect, socioeconomic levels, and both genders; and (5) viewers
who watch significant amounts of television violence perceive a meaner world and overesti-
mate the possibility of being a victim of violence.

Excerpt from “Nonsensorship” by Heywood Broun, written in the 1920s
Of course, it may be argued that motion pictures are not an art and that it makes little differ-
ence what happens to them. We cannot share that indifference. Enough has been done in pic-
tures to convince us that very beautiful things might be achieved if only the censors could be
put out of the way. Not all the silliness of the modern American picture is the fault of the pro-
ducers. Much of the blame must rest with the various boards of censorship. It is difficult to
think up many stories in which there is no passion, crime, or birth. As a matter of fact, we are
of the opinion that the entire theory of motion picture censorship is mistaken. The guardians
of morals hold that if the spectator sees a picture of a man robbing a safe he will thereby be
moved to want to rob a safe himself. In rebuttal we offer the testimony of a gentleman much
wiser in the knowledge of human conduct than any censor. Writing in The New Republic,

George Bernard Shaw advocated that hereafter public reading-rooms supply their patrons
only with books about evil characters. For, he argued, after reading about evil deeds our
longings for wickedness are satisfied vicariously [experienced indirectly]. On the other hand,
there is the danger that the public may read about saints and heroes and drain off its aspira-
tions in such directions without actions.

Excerpt from “Reply Comments of the National Association of Broadcasters before the Federal
Communications Commission,” 11/15/04
The National Association of Broadcasters filed this report with the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC), the government agency charged with overseeing the airwaves. The FCC
was at the time considering mandating a “safe harbor” — relatively nonviolent programming
during times when children are likely to watch television. 
The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) submits this reply to certain comments on
the Commission’s Notice of Inquiry seeking comment on numerous issues relating to violent
programming on television. In the Notice, the Commission requested comment on numerous
issues relating to violent programming on television, including its effects on children, how vio-
lent programming could be defined for regulatory purposes, and the statutory and constitu-
tional limitations on the Commission’s and Congress’s authority to regulate this programming.
The Notice specifically sought comment about a “safe harbor” approach similar to the
Commission’s regulation of broadcast indecency, which would restrict violent programming
to airing in very limited hours. The record in this proceeding provides little empirical or legal
support for the imposition of a safe harbor or other regulation of violent content on television.
The frequently alleged link between violence in the media and violence in the “real world” is
not in fact supported by existing empirical research. A new report submitted in this proceed-
ing confirms that the overall scientific evidence fails to support the hypothesis that exposure
to violent media content causes people to act aggressively. Thus, the record fails to provide
the evidentiary underpinning necessary for the adoption of a safe harbor or similar regula-
tion of television programming based on a rationale that violent depictions cause real world
aggression.
But even among commenters who expressed concern about media violence, the support for
a safe harbor was strikingly muted. Several of these commenters admitted the difficulty of
identifying the specific types of violent depictions that are actually harmful. Certainly the
record provides no assistance to the Commission in the virtually impossible task of defining
violent (or excessively or gratuitously violent) television programming in an intelligible way
that is narrowly tailored and not unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Because any defi-
nition would inevitably encompass a wide array of highly valued speech, including many of
the finest and most popular shows in television history, a safe harbor or similar restriction
on violent content would violate both the rights of broadcasters as speakers and the rights
of viewers to receive constitutionally protected speech. No commenter, moreover, satisfacto-
rily explained how the Commission could properly assert the authority for it to regulate tele-
vision programming due to its violent content.

Excerpt from Early Childhood Televison Viewing and Adolescent Behavior: Monographs of
the Society for Research in Child Development by Daniel R. Anderson, Aletha C. Huston, Kelly
Schmitt, Deborah Linebarger, and John C. Wright (Wiley-Blackwell, 2001; reprinted with permis-
sion from John Wiley and Sons, Inc.) 
Historically, each new medium of mass communication has, within a few years of its intro-
duction, been condemned as a threat to the young people who use it most. Typically the new
medium has been blamed for capturing excessive time and interest of children and youth, for
corrupting their values, for wasting time that would otherwise have been spent more con-
structively, and for causing a decline in taste, morality, self-discipline, learning, and socializa-
tion. Whether the new medium has been paperback books, telephones, comic books, movies,
radio, television, video games, or the World Wide Web, it has been assumed to have homoge-
neous use and content. It has therefore been held responsible for captivating the younger
generation with a level of passive engagement that was close to addiction and for generating
an indiscriminate fascination with all its messages regardless of their content, validity, merit,
or relevance to the life of the child. On the heels of fears about the medium itself have come
concerns about content that will corrupt moral values and stimulate undesirable behavior.
In the United States, we vacillate between alarms about violence and concerns about sex on
the media, with each new medium raising alarm that it poses greater threats than those that
preceded it.
At the same time, new media have been greeted with optimism about their potential for
expanding the horizons of the young and for offering powerful new tools for teaching and
learning. With respect to television, the focus of the Monograph, educators and others saw its
potential for providing information in an interesting and engaging form. By the end of the
1960s, two pioneering educational programs for young children, Sesame Street and Mister
Rogers’ Neighborhood, had established the power of broadcast television for informing and
educating young children.

Excerpt from personal essay by Jean Snyder (pseudonym)
Eight months pregnant, I wander through the electronics store and imagine the world that
will descend upon my child. She (or he — in the old-fashioned way, I’ve chosen surprise) can
learn how to be a car thief with one video game or blast the heads off an alien and obliterate
a bad guy with another. What will he see? Steroidal muscles on the males, and silicon-
enhanced impossible proportions on the females, who, by the way, never seem to wear more
than two cents’ worth of clothing.
Okay, I think. No video games in my house! But then I picture a lonely child, sitting in the
corner with a no-one-will-play-with-me frown, excluded from the conversation of classmates.
Friendless. Outside the loop. Besides, television and film aren’t much better, with their Bo-
toxed faces and air-brushed bodies. If the message doesn’t get through from video games,
it’ll come through the airways. 
At home, I decide to write to my congressman. Don’t let them make those games, I plan to
write. Don’t let them make those movies! Take back the television frequencies. Return the
world to natural goodness. Of course, I never write the letter. My favorite show, Lost, is on.
I settle down with the popcorn, lamenting every single minute that I’m glued to the screen.

Essay question two: Paired passages
Directions: Read these passages, both of which deal with leave-taking. The narrator in
Passage One is a man leaving his boarding school, where he has been a student for many
years. The narrator in Passage Two is a woman embarking on a career as a governess. In a
well-written essay, discuss how the rhetorical devices in each passage convey the narra-
tor’s attitude toward the change that is about to take place in his or her life.
Passage One
I dressed myself, took my hat and gloves, and lingered a little in the room. For the last year
and a half this room had been my “pensive citadel”: here I had read and studied through all
the hours of night, and though true it was that for the latter part of this time I, who was
framed for love and gentle affections, had lost my gaiety and happiness during the strife and
fever of contention with my guardian, yet, on the other hand, as a boy so passionately fond
of books, and dedicated to intellectual pursuits, I could not fail to have enjoyed many happy
hours in the midst of general dejection. I wept as I looked round on the chair, hearth, writing-
table, and other familiar objects, knowing too certainly that I looked upon them for the last
time. Whilst I write this it is eighteen years ago, and yet at this moment I see distinctly, as if it
were yesterday, the lineaments and expression of the object on which I fixed my parting
gaze. It was a picture of the lovely_____ , which hung over the mantelpiece, the eyes and
mouth of which were so beautiful, and the whole countenance so radiant with benignity and
divine tranquility, that I had a thousand times laid down my pen or my book to gather conso-
lation from it, as a devotee from his patron saint. Whilst I was yet gazing upon it, the deep
tones of the clock proclaimed that it was four o’clock. I went up to the picture, kissed it, and
then gently walked out and closed the door for ever!
Passage Two
This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a copy of it to Mrs.
Fairfax, and got that lady’s reply, stating that she was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight
as the period for my assuming the post of governess in her house.
I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly. I had not a very large
wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and the last day sufficed to pack my trunk,
the same I had brought with me eight years ago from Gateshead.
The box was corded, the card nailed on. In half-an-hour the carrier was to call for it to take it
to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at an early hour the next morning to meet the
coach. I had brushed my black stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff;
sought in all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and now having nothing more
to do, I sat down and tried to rest. I could not; though I had been on foot all day, I could not
now repose an instant; I was too much excited. A phase of my life was closing to-night, a new
one opening to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the interval; I must watch feverishly while
the change was being accomplished.

Essay question three: Friendship
Directions: Roman historian Gaius Sallustius Crispus (1st century B.C.E.) said that the
“firmest friendship is based on an identity of likes and dislikes.” Must friends share
common interests and enemies? How important is “an identity of likes and dislikes”? In a
well-written essay, develop your own position on the importance of shared interests and
beliefs in friendship. You may refer to history, literature or other arts, or personal experi-
ence to support your assertion.

tempting-but-wrong. (I don’t bother going through every answer for the easy ones.) Zoom
through your answer sheet, reading the explanations whenever you erred or were undecided
about a particular question. When you’re finished, write the number of correct and incorrect
answers in the Multiple-Choice Conversion Chart at the end of the multiple-choice scoring
section.
Individual answers
1. (D). The Roman poets played to a tough crowd, according to Pliny. Not many people showed
up for poetry readings, and those who did spent more energy seeing and being seen than lis-
tening to the verse. The expression “their pains” (line 6) refers to the energy the poets have
put into writing and reciting their work — the same tasks described by (D).
2. (A). Pliny lets you see a bit of the setting (“in the lounging-places” — line 6), their actions
(they “go out before [the recital] is over” — line 10), a strand of dialogue (“lost a day!” — line
17), and description (“they saunter in with an air of the greatest indifference” — line 9). You
never get to crawl inside the spectators’ heads, so (A) is your answer.
3. (C). Pliny yearns for the good old days, when “Claudius Caesar, walking one day in the
palace, and hearing a great shouting . . . went immediately to the [poetry reading] and agree-
ably surprised the author with his presence” (lines 12–14). That golden era is in direct con-
trast to the audience that Pliny describes in lines 9–11, who don’t even enter the recital hall
or arrive late and leave early. (I think the same audience attended my poetry reading last
year. Sigh.) Comparison and contrast rules this piece, making (C) a winning answer.
4. (C). If you answered question 3 correctly, you probably nailed this one as well. As I said in the
preceding explanation, you can almost hear old Pliny groan: “Audiences aren’t what they
used to be!” Listeners were apparently so caught up in the verse that they let loose with a
“great shouting” (line 12) that drew the most powerful person in Rome to the reading. In
other words, poetry was once appreciated, as (C) states.

5. (E). Pliny’s a poetry fan; Pliny hates people who hate poetry. These two facts are obvious.
Therefore, the “I’d rather play video games” type who regretted losing a day to poetry is,
according to Pliny, complaining because a day of poetry has value — a concept expressed
nicely by (E). Did I catch you with (B)? It’s similar but a little too general. (E) is the most spe-
cific answer supported by the passage.
6. (A). To answer this question, finish reading the sentence. Notice that Pliny refers to authors
“who . . . read out their compositions in spite of this apathy or arrogance on the part of their
audience” (lines 19–20). Bingo: Pliny compares the poor guys who read to empty rooms to
the ones who fill Yankee Stadium with poetry lovers. (Hey, it could happen!)
7. (B). Pliny is bragging a little in this letter; in the very next sentence, he says that “there are
few men of literary tastes” (line 22) who aren’t his friends. However, consider the context.
He’s telling the reader that he goes to readings. Fine: He’s a lit-fan. But he qualifies that state-
ment by revealing that he has an extra motive — friendship. Hence (B) is the best answer.
8. (C). Pliny tells the reader that he “scarcely ever miss[es] being present upon any occasion”
(lines 20–21), the occasion being a reading of some sort of literature. Thus (C) fits the mean-
ing of “this” nicely. Granted, he says that the authors “have generally been friends of mine”
(line 21), but he mentions that fact almost as an unavoidable coincidence (“as indeed there
are few men of literary tastes who are not” — line 22). Therefore (A) and (B) don’t make the
cut. (D) and (E) aren’t serious contenders, because Pliny isn’t talking about declining atten-
dance at that spot in his letter, and he’s going to the country in order to write poetry.
9. (C). Pliny writes, “I do not intend reciting” (line 24) because his friends may then believe that
he attended their readings only because he wanted their attendance at his own recitals. He
says that he would “seem rather to have lent than given my attendance” (lines 24–25). A loan
has to be paid back, in this case, by listening to extremely boring writing. Okay, I’m imagining
that the writing was boring. Maybe Pliny wrote For Dummies books!
10. (D). The key to a double question is to find two answers that work. One is not enough. In this
letter, Pliny is not happy with the literary world of his day, as you see in his remarks about
audiences who prefer to gossip rather than to listen. (Sounds like the average school lunch
table.) He’s not teaching anything to Socius Senecio, the letter’s recipient; (A) and (B) are
therefore bad choices because “didactic” and “pendantic” apply to educators. (C) is a possi-
bility because Pliny does refer positively to a previous era, when Caesar hot-footed over to a
literary event. However, “nostalgia” implies personal participation, and that element isn’t
present in Pliny’s letter. Pliny isn’t draped in mourning, so you can rule out (E) because
“somber” is too strong.
11. (E). The first paragraph begins with an unpleasant incident — the narrator’s exclusion
because of race from a greeting-card exchange and his reaction to the realization that he
“was different from the others” (line 4) and “shut out of their world by a vast veil” (line 5).
The second part of the paragraph (lines 13–19) discusses the way “other black boys” 
(line 13) handle prejudice. Choice (E) perfectly suits these two halves of paragraph one. 
(A), (C), and (D) are too narrow, and (B) is too broad. With main idea questions, you need the
Goldilocks approach, choosing an answer that is just right. (E) fills the bill.
12. (D). DuBois describes a split between a person’s inner self and the way one is perceived by
others. All of the choices refer to this double nature except for (D), which describes a goal,
“to attain self-conscious manhood” (lines 28–29), which is equated with the merging of the
“double self” (line 29) into a “better and truer” (line 29) and more importantly, single self.
Therefore (D) is the choice you want.
13. (B). The narrator understands that he was “different from the others” (line 4) but immedi-
ately follows this statement with a speculation. Perhaps he’s the same in heart and life and
longing. You can easily eliminate (A), (C), and (D), which all express common definitions of
“like.” The problem is to differentiate between (B) and (E). Of the two, (B) is stronger. The
narrator’s comment fits (B) better because he isn’t just similar in his heart and longing; he’s
the same as his classmates. Therefore (B) stands for “best answer” to this question.
314
Part V: Testing, One, Two . . . Practice Exams 

14. (A). The narrator explains that he rises above prejudice by living “in a region of blue sky”
(line 7), which is bluest when he demonstrates his superiority over his classmates with activ-
ities such as “beat[ing] my mates at examination-time” (line 8). These activities are immedi-
ately followed by his comment that “this fine contempt” (line 9) faded after a time. Clearly,
the activities, including being the best at exams — also known as choice (A) — are equated
with “fine contempt” (line 9). Choices (B) and (C) express what the narrator wants but 
doesn’t have. (D) and (E) express other reactions to prejudice, not the “contempt” claimed
by the narrator.
15. (A). The narrator says that he was “shut out” from “their [white] world” (line 5) and that he
had “no desire to tear down that veil” (line 6). Therefore, he “lived above it” (line 7) in the
blue sky. (A) fits perfectly; as he tries to “rise above his situation.” The only other answer
remotely in the running is (C), because the veil limits the narrator’s freedom, and the sky is a
traditional symbol of freedom. However, in the context of this passage, (A) is more specific
and thus the better answer.
16. (E). I sometimes imagine that everyone on the AP board drives an old car, the kind with a
stick shift and a clutch, because the exam contains so many questions on shifts. This one
doesn’t move you from second to third gear; instead it asks you to examine and characterize
a change. Take another look at paragraph one. The first part concerns the narrator’s experi-
ence. At line 13, the narrator, with broad statements, describes how “other black boys” react
to prejudice. The shift is from the narrator’s own story (“personal narration”) to others’ and
ends with a startling conclusion: The “prison-house closed round us all” (lines 16–17). In
other words, (E).
17. (D). Because of the veil, the narrator is “shut out of their world” (line 3). Though whites
aren’t named in that sentence, the implication is clear, and statement I makes the cut.
Statement II doesn’t, because while the narrator becomes aware of race in elementary
school, he doesn’t claim to describe a universal experience. Statement III is a keeper because
line 22 relates the veil to “a world which yields him no true self-consciousness,” another way
of saying that forming an identity is tough when the veil is around. Add the whole thing up
and you’ve got (D).
18. (B). Parallelism, in lit-speak (a language you have to know for this exam), means that parts of
the sentence performing the same function have the same grammatical identity. In other
words, your favorite hobbies can’t be hang-gliding, windsurfing, and to go bowling. They
have to be hang-gliding, windsurfing, and bowling. Even without the grammar terminology,
you can hear the difference in the two sentences. One matches, and the other doesn’t. The
sentence beginning “One ever feels . . .” contains a series of nouns: “American,” “Negro,”
“souls,” “thoughts,” “strivings,” and “ideals” (lines 26–27). The repetition comes with the
word “two,” which pops up in front of several of these nouns. None of the other choices is
even close. (For a review of literary terms, check out Part II.)
19. (C). The sentence in the question — “He would not Africanize . . . message for the world”
(lines 30–32) — explains what the goal of the “American Negro” (line 28) is not. The next sen-
tence states what the goal is (“to make it possible for a man to be both a Negro and an
American” on an equal basis). The first sentence sets the stage for the next, as (C) says.
20. (C). The author is committed to a cause, and he’s not shy about revealing it. He wants a fairer
world, where he and everyone, regardless of race, can be “a co-worker in the kingdom of cul-
ture” (line 36). His passion comes through in his diction; many words are extreme. He refers
to “genius” (line 37) instead of “talent,” for example. The other choices can be voted off the
island because at least one is not appropriate. In (A), for example, you can make a case for
“philosophical,” because the author discusses important ideas. However, he’s not “concilia-
tory” because there’s no hint of an apology. Similarly, (B) doesn’t work because the passage
isn’t sarcastic. (D) drops off for “cautious” and (E) makes no sense at all, as the two words
contradict each other.
21. (B). The passage as a whole concerns John Law — his life, his reputation among historians,
and his close ties to “Mississippi madness” (line 2), which was not a basketball tournament.
(It was the financial scandal of the seventeenth century. Law sold nearly worthless shares in
315
Chapter 21: The Envelope, Please: Answers and Explanations for Practice Exam Two

a project to develop trade on the Mississippi River. The question, however, does not concern
the passage as a whole. Instead it focuses only on the first sentence, which links John Law
and Mississippi madness, stating specifically that a discussion of that historical event “can
have no fitter introduction than a sketch of the life of . . . John Law” (lines 2–3). Clearly, 
sentence two justifies the biographical information that follows.
You don’t need to know anything about history to answer question 21, or any other AP
English Language and Composition question, for that matter. The selections you read may be
from history, science, or other disciplines, but the answers deal only with rhetoric and com-
prehension of the information supplied in the passage.
22. (C). At first glance this looks like the kind of question that makes you wish you had actually
paid attention in grammar class instead of gluing the teacher’s bookbag to the floor. In gram-
matical terminology, you have to find the antecedent of “its” (line 3). However, if your glue
bottle got a workout during English, rest assured. You can answer this question using logic.
Which word does “its” replace? John Law is referred to as an “author” (line 3), but he didn’t
write anything. Instead, he created a “scheme” (line 2) that became “Mississippi madness”
(line 2). “Scheme” is an answer choice, but “Mississippi madness” isn’t. Go for (C).
23. (D). In lines 10–16, many sentences or parts of sentences follow a “he plus verb” pattern.
You’re almost reading a list. So all you have to do is figure out the nature of the list. Law knew
“philosophy and true principles of credit” (line 9) and grasped “the monetary question” (line
9). He didn’t “calculate” (line 11) the “avaricious” or greedy “frenzy” (line 12) of the French,
nor did his see that “hope was as extravagant as fear” (line 13). Some of these statements are
against John Law (he knew what he was doing) and some aren’t (he didn’t see the big picture).
The overall effect, therefore, is to “qualify” or limit his guilt, better known as (D).
Remember the word “qualify.” In the essay section, you’re often asked to take a position that
supports, opposes, or qualifies the views expressed in a quotation or passage.
24. (A). Sentence four resembles an old-fashioned scale where weights are placed on each side
until the two halves match. Look at the balance in this sentence: Law was “neither knave nor
madman” (line 7) and was “more deceived than deceiving, more sinned against than sinning”
(lines 7–8). Grammatically, “knave” balances “madman” because both are nouns. Even if you
don’t know the terminology, you can see how the meaning balances also, because both
words describe character. Similarly, “more deceived . . . sinning” balances two participles (a
grammar term for verbs that are used as descriptions). And again, even without the nerdy
English-teacher talk, you can hear how these two statements match. Pairing up grammatical
elements is called parallelism or the use of parallel structure, the answer you find in (A). The
other choices aren’t even close. The sentence has no irony, a literary term for a gap between
what you say and what you mean, so (B) is a nonstarter. Circular reasoning (“Michelangelo is
great because he’s in my art history textbook. He’s in my art history textbook because he’s
great,” for example) isn’t in this passage; feel free to drop (C). Sensory details don’t appear,
and the author does make judgments about Law’s actions. Bingo: (D) and (E) are out.
25. (E). The passage tells you that the French, “like the man in the fable” (line 14), destroy the
source of their future wealth. The word “fable” is key here. An allusion refers to a literary
work or a historic event and brings all the ideas involved into the piece of writing in which
the allusion appears. Once you see fable, and even if you never read the story of the goose
that laid golden eggs, you know you have an allusion. Did I catch you with (A)? Yes, the
golden egg fable strongly condemns greed, but the AP exam isn’t going to test your ideas of
right and wrong. They test literary terms, such as metaphor (B), an implied comparison, and
figurative language (C), writing that leaves the land of realism for a vacation in imaginative
territory. A paradox is something that seems impossible or contradictory, such as the
famous statement from Yankee legend Yogi Berra that “nobody goes there anymore because
it’s too crowded.”
316
Part V: Testing, One, Two . . . Practice Exams 

26. (C). Law starts out on a “broad and smooth” (line 17) river, but the “current was too strong”
(lines 20–21) and he goes over the “tremendous falls” (lines 21–22) and is “dashed to pieces”
(line 22). Sound like a man in control of his destiny? I don’t think so. As the last line of para-
graph one states, Law was “the boatman” but the French people were “the waters” (line 25).
The nature metaphor emphasizes that Law isn’t fully in control; no one zooming down a river
is, if the river has waterfalls, rocks, and rapids in it. Therefore (C) is best. Were you fooled by
(D) and (E)? (D) is tempting because the French people, as “the waters” (line 25), bear some
responsibility. However, (D) doesn’t take into account all the statements about Law. (E) is out
for a similar reason. True, Law is clueless, but (E) refers only to him and ignores the French.
27. (B). The author has a strong point to make in paragraph one: Law, an almost legendary
conman of the eighteenth century, wasn’t the only bad guy in the mess known as “Mississippi
madness” (line 2). The first paragraph portrays him as a mixture. He’s not a “knave or a
madman” (line 4), and the greed of the French people played a role. In paragraph two (lines
26–43), the author jumps to Law’s birth and takes the reader through Law’s early years. The
author makes some judgments about Law — “he was tall, strong, and well made” (line 36), for
example. However, most of paragraph two is simple exposition — laying out the facts of Law’s
life. Therefore the shift is from argumentative to expository, expressed by choice (B).
28. (B). The word “years” tells you that you’re in the age category, so you can rule out (A) and
(D) immediately, even though Law is described as way ahead of his peers in math ability. (C)
is the next to go, because the association of innocence with youth isn’t good enough to make
this the correct answer. (E) is very tempting, because in the next sentence Law is said to be
seventeen years old. However, you can’t tell whether the author is moving forward in time to
age seventeen, and “tender” is a more general word. Go for (B), or “young.”
29. (A). You don’t have to know the meaning of “Jessamy John” (lines 40–41) in order to see that
women like Law and men don’t. Law is “a great favourite with the ladies” (line 39) “while” he
is despised by “the other sex” (line 40). (The word “while” often signals a contrast.)
Nicknames are associated with each gender, with “Beau Law” contrasting with “Jessamy
John” (lines 40–41). Bingo: (A) fills the bill here.
30. (C). The passage occasionally pokes fun at John Law (A), as in the last line, when Law is
described as going to “London, to see the world” (line 43). However, most of the selection is
more serious. (B) is tempting because the first paragraph discusses how history has mel-
lowed the condemnation of Law that he experienced “in his lifetime” (line 5). Overall, (C) is
the best answer because the passage links Law to those around him — to the French in para-
graph one and to acquaintances and relatives in paragraph two. Choices (D) and (E) aren’t
even close.
31. (D). The introduction and the passage point you to (D) in several ways. The introduction tells
you that Gandhi wanted to free India from British rule. The “administration was silently
crumbling . . . as scores of village headmen resigned” (lines 1–2). If they’re crumbling but
Gandhi isn’t — and in fact his group is growing larger, as noted in lines 18–19 — they’re his
opponents, not his allies. Therefore you can easily rule out (A) and (B). Choice (C) is tempt-
ing; maybe the resignations occurred because the “headmen” (line 2) support what Gandhi’s
doing. But (D) is best because it identifies, not describes, the administration. Choice (E) is
just too broad.
32. (A). Lines 5–10 are “blocked” — set apart from the rest of the test. Blocked material isn’t
stuck behind a linebacker or a traffic barrier; it’s just a long quotation. “Oh, yeah?” I can hear
you say. “So where are the quotation marks?” Good question! The block takes the place of the
quotation marks in signaling the reader that these words are quoted.
33. (E). This is a particularly tricky question, so feel free to throw darts at my picture (but not at
me!) if you got it wrong. The devilish part of this question is that most of the answers are
possible, but only one — (E) — is best. You may have chosen (A) because Gandhi’s
words address future actions. However, “plan of action” implies specifics, and the “severe
317
Chapter 21: The Envelope, Please: Answers and Explanations for Practice Exam Two

noncooperation” (lines 6–7) is never detailed. Choice (B) is also tempting because you can
imagine someone saying, “Okay, what can one march accomplish?” However, no criticism is
cited in the passage, so (B) fails. (C) doesn’t make the cut because Gandhi doesn’t waste any
time here explaining why salt shouldn’t be taxed. Similarly, (D) fails because the purpose of
the march — to force the British government to change — is implied but not stated. Time for
the winner: (E) motivates the weary marchers, showing them that they are part of an unstop-
pable and huge force.
34. (A). A rhetorical question doesn’t need a reply; the answer — at least in the general sense —
is already there. When Gandhi asks, “But how many can be given such punishment?” 
(line 9), he isn’t looking for a number, though he himself supplies one in the very next line
(“three hundred million of persons” — line 10). Instead he is telling his followers that they
can’t be defeated if enough people join the movement. The more activists there are, the less
likely the British will be able to control them. Of the other answers, choice (B) is out because
Gandhi isn’t comparing their march to any other. Nor is he referring to a historical event or
literary work — an allusion, choice (C). Understatement is way out of bounds because if any-
thing, Gandhi is overstating the number of followers he can expect. He was hugely popular,
but three hundred million is a bit steep. Antithesis, or contradiction of ideas, isn’t present
either, so (E) can be voted off the island. By the way, if literary terms give you a headache,
turn to Part II for some aspirin — er, I mean definitions and examples.
35. (B). The extreme statements — “to hang three hundred million of persons” (line 10), “battle
of Right against Might” (line 35), “I would rather die a dog’s death and have my bones licked
by dogs” (lines 14–15), and so forth — reveal Gandhi’s passion. The content shows that he is
rebelling against the government. Thus (B) is a perfect fit. Choice (A) fails because Gandhi
shows no regret; nor is he “somber,” as choice (C) states, “sarcastic” — choice (D), or
“ironic” — choice (E).
Doubled answers show up frequently in AP tone-questions. Be sure both words apply before
choosing an answer.
36. (E). An old man walking with a staff “striding vigorously” (line 11) along with followers
dressed in homemade cloth. The “mighty British Empire” (lines 12–13). I’d say these two 
contrast! Hence (E) fits nicely here. The only other contender is (B), but the sentence doesn’t
show the magnitude of the problem but rather the incongruity of these two extremely 
different adversaries.
37. (E). An antecedent is the noun that a pronoun refers to. When you’re antecedent-hunting, try
inserting the choices for the pronoun. See which one makes the most sense. In the given 
sentence, you have to figure out what was being fed by Indian nationalist sources. “Time,”
choice (A)? Nope. Ditto for “reports” and “agents,” choices (B) and (C). “Those” (line 22) is
another pronoun, but it has nothing to do with “which.” Instead, “which” refers to “world
press. 
38. (C). The Viceroy is described as someone who “regarded himself as a man of principle” (line
28), yet in his quotation he expresses the hope that Gandhi will die and says that the death
“would be a happy solution” (line 27). As my students say, “That’s harsh!” Such a comment
probably comes from frustration, as the Viceroy “was not in favor of Gandhi’s arrest” (line
20) but clearly wanted him out of the way. The only other answer remotely in the running is
(A), because I imagine most human beings would prefer not to have an official hoping that
their death is just around the corner. However, if you put the Viceroy’s quotation together
with Gandhi’s, Gandhi sees his struggle as “Right against Might,” not an issue of sensitivity or
personal safety.
39. (C). The passage begins and ends with the Salt March, with a small digression into the British
response to Gandhi’s protest, which is sandwiched between information about the Salt
march. The word “meanwhile” provides a transition from the paragraph about the Viceroy to
the march.
318
Part V: Testing, One, Two . . . Practice Exams 

40. (D). Decode the footnote, and here’s what you get: The Publication Division of the
Government of India, which is located in New Delhi, collected all of Gandhi’s writings. The
volume number cited is 43, so this is a l-o-n-g book, so long that its publication date covers a
span of 26 years — from 1958 to 1984. Apply these facts to the choices given, and only (D)
fills the bill.
41. (C). Footnotes and endnotes often drag in some Latin. Ibid tells you that the citation refers to
the preceding source. If ibid is alone, it needs to sign up for an Internet dating service. Sorry,
I meant to say that if ibid is alone, the cited material comes from the same source and page
as the preceding foot- or endnote. If ibid comes with a number, the source is the same, but
the page is different — exactly the situation described in (C).
42. (A). The abbreviation “ed.” is the tipoff: D. G. Tendulkar is an editor. Fine, I can hear you say,
“Editor of what?” A book, because article titles are enclosed by quotation marks and book
titles are italicized or underlined. The roman numeral “III” indicates that the citation is to the
third volume of the work. Who wrote the book? If it were Gandhi (or Gandhiji, his affectionate
nickname), Gandhi would be listed first, because the author’s name precedes the editor’s.
Therefore, you’re looking at a book of writing by various authors, edited by D. G. Tendulkar.
In other words, (A).
43. (E). Four of the five footnotes refer to the same book, The Collected Works by Mohandas K.
Gandhi. There you go: The author relied heavily on Gandhi’s own words. Secondary sources,
by the way, are those that interpret someone else’s work or writing. The fourth footnote cites
a secondary source, but one out of five doesn’t qualify as “many,” so (D) isn’t the answer you
seek. Choice (B) may have caught you. Because the author has so much from Gandhi himself,
you may guess that he considers Gandhi the best source of information. However, you don’t
know for sure. Stick with what you do know, which is that the author relied on Gandhi’s own
words.
44. (C). The author of this passage is speaking with his tongue solidly planted in his cheek, as
you see in the very first line when he refers to “children, husbands, and wives” as invest-
ments; hence “mockery” is a good bet. The many references to the way things used to be
(“Once I regarded my car as simple transportation” — lines 8–9) can be the basis for “nostal-
gic,” the second term of (C). The only other serious contender is (D), because the author
adopts an air of authority, pronouncing his opinions as fact. However, “self-righteous” would
remove him from the group that he is criticizing, and he includes himself in the “financially
obsessed” (line 49) category.
45.
(C). An author making an argument doesn’t always tell you his or her thesis in the beginning of
the passage. This author waits until the end, when he concludes that it isn’t possible “not to be
financially obsessed” (line 49). Yet the whole passage yearns for a different era, when not
everything was evaluated in terms of its investment value. (Yes, he’s kidding around, but a seri-
ous point underlies his jokes.) The implied argument is that the author — and the readers —
should pull some of those dollar signs away from their possessions and relationships.
46.
(A). In this passage the author starts off with a ton of examples of items that used to be
valued for themselves and are now seen as investments — the couch, clothes, and even chil-
dren. What’s the point of all those examples? You don’t find out until the last paragraph,
when the author analyzes why this attitude has taken hold: “routed . . . by fantastic opportu-
nities . . . lured by the irresistible increases” (lines 43–44) in value. No doubt about it: (A) is
the answer you want. Were you trapped by (B)? The author does compare older and current
attitudes when he says, for example, “[w]hat used to be known as acquaintances” (line 1)
“have all become investments” (lines 1–2). However, the question asks you to consider the
whole passage, not just the first paragraph, and (B) falls apart in the last paragraph.
47.
(D). An antecedent is the word a pronoun replaces. (I know what you’re thinking: Quick! Get
the grammar-repellant! But you do have to know this term, because the AP torturers 
like it a lot.) To answer this question, all you have to do is figure out what “which” means.
What “now serves only as a reminder of our missed opportunity to cash in at $41 an ounce”
(lines 16–17)? The flatware, or silverware, also known as choice (D).
319
Chapter 21: The Envelope, Please: Answers and Explanations for Practice Exam Two

48. (E). Paragraph three (lines 19–26) is all about changes. The Apple computer was bought too
soon, and the water pitchers weren’t sold at the height of their market value. The silver
samovar may increase or decrease in value depending upon the actions of the Federal
Reserve. Choices (C) and (D) are too limited, but (E) encompasses both.
49. (B). Paragraph four begins with a series of statements about furniture: It was once a place to
sit or to keep things, but now furniture is an investment. All the little mishaps of daily life are
“threats to the bottom line” (line 31). Do you see the cause-and-effect pattern? The cause is
“furniture = investment” and the effect is “a great deal more fuss is made over mishaps these
days” (line 31–32). The other choices just don’t fit. The passage moves from specific to gen-
eral, the opposite of (A). Paragraph four is similar to the paragraphs before and after it, so
it’s not a digression or exception. Bingo: (C) and (D) bite the dust. The last line of the para-
graph is an interpretation of the information presented, so (E) is also out.
50. (D). The assertion that “spaghetti dumped in one’s lap” (lines 34–35) is equal to “a 30 percent
drop in a stock or the cancellation of a dividend” (lines 35–36) should point you immediately
toward (D). Okay, maybe “absurdity” doesn’t work if you’re a fashion designer and it’s your
collection for Project Runway, but in the normal world, absurdity is the name of the game.
51. (B). The passage piles on the details, taking you through family relationships, furniture and
clothing, baseball cards and silver samovars. The last paragraph puts everything into per-
spective, explaining the point of all those examples: we’re obsessed with investments, but
our obsession is understandable. Yup, (B) is the way to go.
52. (B). Parallels, when you’re in English- and not Math-Land, are words or expressions doing the
same grammatical job or having the same grammatical identity. In line 47, “the monetary
system” is the object of the preposition “with” (line 47). The same preposition has other
objects, including “the balance of trade” (lines 47–48). If you didn’t get this one because
grammar makes you break out in hives, turn to Chapter 7 for some extra help.
53. (A). The word “very” generally intensifies meaning, and this “very” is no exception. However,
the “very” in line 48 is used in an unusual way. Here it indicates that even our “daily moods”
are tied to our finances.

Grade Your Essays
If this is the second practice exam you’ve completed, you already know how to proceed. If
your memory is a little fuzzy — and after taking a sample exam, it very well may be — here’s
a short refresher: 
 Check out the general guidelines for each essay. First I tell you what to look for in the
three essay questions — and your goals differ depending upon the type of essay you’re
writing. Then I break the grades into three categories, each with a range of three or
four scores. 
 Read the two sample answers. For each of the three essays, I provide two answers,
graded and accompanied by explanations of why a particular score is appropriate.
These essays won’t match your own, unless the Twilight Zone suddenly slipped into
your house. (In that case forget the AP exam. Write a book and get ready for your
appearance on Oprah.) However, the samples do help you see what works and what
doesn’t in an AP essay, and you can apply those principles to your essay.
 Assign a number from 0 to 9 for each scoring category. First decide which scoring
slot you’re in. Give yourself the highest score in the range if your essay almost, but not
quite, qualifies for the next higher category. If you can see but not reach a 7, give your-
self a 6. Give yourself the lowest score if you barely escape the next rung down. That is,
if you think about the 4-5-6 slot but decide against it, go for a 7. Essays solidly in one
category receive the middle number.
 Fill in the Essay Scoring Grid for each essay. You need a little arithmetic here, but not
much. Just plug in the numbers and follow the directions.
 Enter your essay scores in the Exam Conversion Chart at the end of the chapter.

Scoring Essay One: Synthesis Essay on
Regulating the Media 
The prompt inquires about regulation of the media “in order to promote children’s well-
being.” Your task is to decide what sort of regulation is appropriate, if any. Then you must
support your position from at least three of the six possible sources. The problem facing you
with this question is that the sources feature wildly divergent points of view and a ton of pos-
sible evidence. Rate your essay by asking these questions:
 Will my reader (grader) easily grasp my position on the regulation of the media? This
topic invites you to consider various types of media, from television and film to video
games and the Web. You also have to figure out what kind of regulation you favor. Should
government be involved, as in “put this on the air and do ten years in the penitentiary”?
Should the media regulate itself? Or do parents bear the entire responsibility for monitor-
ing their kids’ media exposure? You may argue for any position, including one I haven’t
mentioned here, so long as you actually have a position. Also, though you don’t have to
announce yourself in the very first sentence, in most cases the reader should be able to
determine where you stand on media regulation before the end of paragraph one. 
321
Chapter 21: The Envelope, Please: Answers and Explanations for Practice Exam Two

 Have I subdivided my argument into logical supporting points? When you’re working
with a complex set of ideas, organization matters. This question covers the media, and
that term includes everything from television and films to video games. The sources
cover violence, smoking, unrealistic body image, and other delightful elements. In
other words, you have to untangle the bowl of spaghetti they’ve served up so that your
argument makes sense. 
 Have I used evidence effectively? The sources for this synthesis question contradict
each other (a situation familiar to anyone who’s ever researched a controversial topic).
You have evidence to back up pretty much anything you want to say. As always, the
question requires you to draw upon at least three of the six sources. The evidence from
the sources should be strongly tied to your argument.
 How good is your writing? This is an English test, and your evaluator is an English
teacher or professor. You know what we’re like! We want to see good spelling and gram-
mar at least most of the time, organized thoughts, and appropriate citations. (If you
need help with source citation, check out Chapter 13. Grammar assistance arrives in

Sample answer A
Violence has been a concern throughout history, and modern times are no exception
and are even worse. No victim of violence draws more sympathy than a child, especially
when the child has been harmed by another child. The school shootings that take place
every year or so bring this issue to national attention, and that is a good thing. However,
we do not always know how to respond to tragedies such as Columbine. One possible
reason for violence in children is the violence directed at children by the media, includ-
ing television, movies, and video games. Drugs, alcohol, and body image are also
effected by the media, when children watch them. So is smoking (Source D). That’s why
the media should be regulated by the government. A time when nothing unsuitable for
children is shown should be established, a “safe harbor” (Source C).
According to Source A, 1000 studies have shown that violence on television has caused
violence in real life. If you have a child watching television, they will almost certainly
react to the aggressiveness that they see there. “Televised violence teaches aggressive
attitudes and behaviors” (Source A). So if you are going to take care of children, you
have to keep them away from television or you have to regulate television. Keeping a
323
Chapter 21: The Envelope, Please: Answers and Explanations for Practice Exam Two

child away from television is tough on the child, as Source F explains. A child wouldn’t
be able to talk with friends about television shows. Besides, even people who worry
about children like to watch television (Source F), and if their children are in the room,
they will watch too. You can have a safe harbor which is a time when violence on televi-
sion is not allowed. The National Association of Broadcasters believes that the studies
showing violence on television are not valid (Source C), but many organizations such as
the American Academy of Pediatrics disagree with that idea (Source A). 
Once you know that television must be regulated, you can easily accept the idea that
movies and video games must be regulated also. Movies already have a label saying that
children of a certain age should not see them if they have violence and sexual scenes,
but what about tobacco? Source D mocks the idea that children’s film should not have
smoking. However, regulation is the answer. No one says that everything in the media
should be sanitized, but at least some of the content can be controlled during the peak
viewing hours of children. Smoking does so much harm that it is better left out of chil-
dren’s films.
Some people make the point that violence in film substitutes for violence in real life
(Source B). Others point out that “each new medium of communication has, within a few
years of its introduction, been condemned as a threat to the young people who use it
most” (Source E). However, these condemnations may be justified by the violence that
we see in our society. Why take the chance? Why not allow the government to step in so
that children can grow up in a safe world.
Analysis of sample answer A
This AP test taker did an adequate but not great job on the synthesis question. The writer
did understand the sources and did refer to them correctly. However, the essay badly needs
reorganization, and the writing style is unsophisticated. Now for the details.
Clear point of view: 4
The writer calls for government regulation of the media, including the so-called “safe harbor”
concept. However, the writer doesn’t explain what kind of regulation he or she favors and
how the regulations would affect the broadcasters’ first amendment right to free speech. The
first paragraph spends so much time on violence that it almost seems to be an essay on just
that subtopic — a trap that’s easy to fall into because several sources refer to violence. A
better approach would refer to a variety of issues (violence, tobacco, body image, and so
forth) in a more balanced way in the introductory paragraph and throughout the essay. 
Supporting points: 3
The writer hasn’t really broken down this topic into effective subtopics. A couple of
approaches would have made sense here. For example, if the writer is calling for government
regulation, one paragraph might make the case for new laws by pointing out the perils facing
children exposed to violence, drugs, tobacco, and so on through the various forms of media.
Another paragraph could answer likely objections to the writer’s plan, explaining how the
proposed regulations do not unfairly limit freedom of speech. Still another paragraph could
address how these regulations might be implemented — a rating code with specific penal-
ties, for example. Or the essay might have been organized by media type, discussing films in
one paragraph, video games in another, television in a third, and so forth.

Evidence: 4
This essay does make use of the sources, though not very well. The information from the
sources is thrown into the essay without much thought. In the second paragraph, for exam-
ple, the contradictory views about the effect of televised violence on children is simply
plopped there. No attempt is made to reconcile or even to discuss which evidence seems
more credible. (I’m not a social science researcher, but even I know that broadcasters have a
built-in bias against regulation.)
Writing: 4
The grammar isn’t perfect here (I had to restrain my teacher’s instinct to correct this essay
by biting my typing fingers!) but it isn’t terrible either. The style is competent, though no one
would mistake this essay for a mature piece of prose.

Sample answer B
As Heywood Broun explains, “it is difficult to think up many stories in which there is no
passion, crime, or birth” (Source B). Yet many people, alarmed by perceived threats to
children, want to do exactly that. By censoring or otherwise regulating film, television,
and other media, critics of the entertainment industry hope to create what the Senate
calls a “safe harbor” (Source A). Children could sail into that harbor, these critics say,
and rest there in a state of innocence. But is that innocence ever permanent? And how
can we square the idea of official censorship with the American ideal of free speech? In
my opinion, I think that regulation of the media should come from parents, for the most
part. The media themselves should also consider how their words and images affect the
audience, especially children, and then make their own standards of what is right and
wrong in children’s programming.
True, the situation is complicated. Scientists can’t even agree on how the media affects
children. A report for the Senate Majority Committee says that “more than 1000 studies on
the effects of television and film violence have been done during the past 40 years”
(Source A) and those studies, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, show
that “television violence is as strongly correlated with aggressive behavior as any variable
that has been measured.” (Source A) However, violence has been part of the world since
way before the age of film and television. The Bible even shows a murder, when there were
only four people in the world, and one of them killed another. Cain wasn’t influenced by
the media. According to Source E, all new media are first suspected of causing harm to
children. “Typically, the new medium has been blamed for capturing excessive time and
interest of children and youth, for corrupting their values” (Source E). After the new
medium “ages,” people see it as safer. 
325
Chapter 21: The Envelope, Please: Answers and Explanations for Practice Exam Two

The pregnant woman in Source F is typical in that she first thinks of safeguarding her
child from the media and then realizes that media is all around and must be dealt with. If
she doesn’t let her child watch tv or play video games, the child will be “sitting in the
corner with a no-one-will-play-with-me lunch box.” Next she decides that the govern-
ment should regulate and sanitize all media, which lets her off the hook. Now no one will
have objectionable media to talk about and her child will not be left out. 
The National Association of Broadcasters thinks that the studies equating media vio-
lence with real violence aren’t proved. “The frequently alleged link between violence in
the media and violence in the “real world” is not in fact supported by existing empirical
research” (Source C). The Broadcasters have a reason to feel this way. They don’t want
the government telling them what to do. But they also point out that creating a “safe
harbor” is something that can be interpreted. “Several of these commenters admitted
the difficulty of identifying the specific types of violent depictions that are actually
harmful.” (Source C)
With so much disagreement, it’s better to let parents decide for their children what is
safe and isn’t. It’s also better to let broadcasters take responsibility, with the govern-
ment left out.
Analysis of sample answer B
This writer started off strongly and then hit a wall, as many test-takers do because they run
out of time or energy. Thus the first part of the essay is good, and the second part not so
good. Here’s how this effort would be graded.
Clear point of view: 5
Right away you know what point of view the writer takes: parents are primary, broadcasters
secondary and self-regulating. Government regulation isn’t mentioned except as a negative,
something contrary to “the American ideal of free speech.” The first paragraph also opens
with a snappy quotation from Broun, stating that every story has something objectionable in
it. Clearly this writer is an individualist who favors decentralized power. However, as the
essay moves along, the point of view is a little muddied. The writer says that the situation is
“complicated.” Does that statement mean that the issue of regulation is complicated also?
Divergent views on the link between media- and real-life violence aren’t fully addressed, and
the reader wonders what the writer believes. The essay restates the thesis in the last para-
graph: “With so much disagreement, it’s better to let parents decide” and “to let broadcast-
ers take responsibility.” 
When you state an idea or opinion in an essay, don’t label it (“In my opinion I think”). Of
course that’s what you think. Why else would you write it? Besides, “in my opinion I think”
wastes time and ink and seriously annoys just about every English teacher I know — and I
know a lot of English teachers.
Supporting points: 5
The essay has several supporting points, but they aren’t laid out in a logical way and none is
fully developed. The writer jumps from the idea that no story lacks “passion, crime, or birth”
(Source B) to the difficulty of creating a safe harbor. So far so good. Paragraph two begins an
idea — the media violence/real violence link is controversial — but doesn’t develop it until
the fourth paragraph, when the possible bias of the National Association of Broadcasters is
mentioned. Paragraph two seems to come down against the media/real-world link, explaining
that Cain murdered Abel without being influenced by a video game and that new media are
326
Part V: Testing, One, Two . . . Practice Exams 

always criticized, as Source E points out. Paragraph three jumps to another supporting point,
that keeping your child away from media harms the kid’s social life. So far, the arguments
against government regulation are piling up. Not bad! But then paragraph four moves back-
wards, to the real-world/media link. The information here should be combined with the infor-
mation in paragraph two. The last paragraph is just tacked on and weakens the whole essay
because it is repetitive.
Evidence: 5
This essay analyzes the sources at times and at times just summarizes. The first three para-
graphs do a good job with the information, and then paragraphs four and five fall apart. In
paragraph four, for instance, quotations pop up, but they aren’t linked to the central argu-
ment. In fact, paragraph four sails perilously close to something the directions tell you to
avoid — summary. Paragraph five, as stated above, accomplishes nothing.
AP graders know they’re reading a first draft, and they understand the time pressure you’re
facing. They don’t expect a fully-developed conclusion. However, they don’t want a fake
wrap-up either — repetition of something you’ve already written or the dreaded (by English
teachers) “in this essay I have proved” ending. Moral of the story: When you get to the end of
the essay, make your point and then STOP WRITING.
Writing: 4
As in the other categories, the essay begins with a reasonably mature command of language
but deteriorates as it goes along. (I sympathize; I do the same thing as I go through the day.
By evening I can barely make a complete sentence!) Overall, I’d give this one a 4.
Overall score: 5
Math time: Add up the four scores

which rounds up to 5.
Scoring Essay Two: Paired Passages
This question brings a double helping of trouble. The prompt asks you to compare two short
passages, each of which features a narrator heading off to a new life. The first is an excerpt
from Confessions of an English Opium-Eater, a thinly-disguised autobiographical novel by
Thomas de Quincey. The second comes from Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë. 
Don’t be disturbed by the fact that these passages are fiction. If you’ve ever seen a tearful
memoir writer confess to fabricating material, you know that fiction and nonfiction have a lot
in common, at least in terms of writing. Approach both passages the same way you deal with
memoir or biography as you analyze the authors’ rhetorical techniques.
327
Chapter 21: The Envelope, Please: Answers and Explanations for Practice Exam Two

As you evaluate your essay, consider these questions:
 Have I identified the narrators’ attitudes toward “the change that is about to take
place”? The first passage looks backward. The narrator reminisces about “familiar
objects” he won’t see again. He doesn’t tell you where he’s going, just that he’s leaving,
as he “closed the door forever!” He acknowledges that he hasn’t always been happy,
but he’s nostalgic about the life he’s had. The second passage is much less sentimental.
The narrator lists her preparations in a no-nonsense, straightforward way. Only at the
very end do you see emotion, and it’s all for the future: a “phase of my life was closing
to-night, a new one opening to-morrow.” This narrator is excited about what comes
next, not about what she’s losing.
 Have I discussed how the passages convey these attitudes? It’s not enough to identify
the narrators’ emotions. You have to explain what rhetorical devices get those feelings
across. You may mention diction, syntax, tone, and other aspects of the writing. (The
sample essays show you some solid points you can make about these two passages.)
 Have I used evidence effectively? You can’t just state that the narrator in passage one
is sentimental. You have to dig into the text and quote the words that create this
impression (“many happy hours,” for example). When you discuss diction, you need to
mention “lingered” or “radiant” or other words and analyze how they contribute to the
overall effect of the passage. 
 Have I produced a well-written essay? Check your grammar, spelling, and punctuation.
Read the sentences aloud. Do they sound fluid and mature or choppy and simplistic?

Sample answer A
The narrator plays an important role in any piece of writing. All the reader’s perceptions
are filtered through the narrator, and although the reader can disagree with the narrator
and understand more than the narrator, in the end it is the narrator’s voice that the
reader hears and the narrator’s impressions that the reader gathers. In these passages,
the narrators are both on the brink of leaving a place they have lived for a long time.
The narrator in Passage One is nostalgic for the past and preoccupied with what he’s
losing, while the narrator in Passage Two is optimistic and excited about the future.
In passage one, the narrator reflects on his room while packing. The diction shows his
ties to the room. He “lingered a little” before leaving. He calls the room his “citadel,” a
fortress, which implies that he felt protected there. All the words he uses to describe his
time in the room are extreme: “passionately fond of books”, “radiant” (not just “shin-
ing”), and “divine tranquility.” These extremes show a romantic and idealistic nature,
which in the passage is all directed at the past. In fact, the narrator never mentions the
future at all. 
One particularly interesting part of Passage One involves a picture of “the lovely _____” —
someone who isn’t even named. The narrator looks at the picture and appreciates its
beauty, like the woman in Byron’s poem, “She Walks in Beauty,” her physical appearance
is less important than what is inside. The sentence about the portrait only devotes a few
words to “the eyes or mouth” which were “beautiful,” but more of the sentence talks
about her “benignity” and “divine tranquility.” It’s significant that as the narrator looks at
329
Chapter 21: The Envelope, Please: Answers and Explanations for Practice Exam Two

the picture, he hears the clock chime. Time is running out for him, another idea that
means nostalgia. He won’t be here, appreciating her, as he has in the past. He even kisses
the picture goodbye before he “closed the door forever!” He is sadly leaving her and also
the room, where he has looked at her picture “a thousand times.”
Passage Two is much more matter of fact. This narrator doesn’t feel anything until the
end, when she says that she “tried to rest” but couldn’t despite her tiredness because “I
was too much excited.” The excitement isn’t related to what went on in the room or in her
previous life. She says, “A phase of my life was closing” and a “new one opening.” True,
she mentions the past, but it is parallel in syntax to the future. The last part of the sen-
tence, after the semicolon, has her “watch feverishly while the change was being accom-
plished.” For her the fact of change is exciting (“feverishly” means with excitement).
Other syntax shows her attitude. She makes a list of all she has done, all with “I-verb”
statements: “I now busied myself . . . I had brushed my black stuff travelling-dress . . . I
sat down.” Things are stated matter of factly, not exaggerated. She has no sentimental
feelings about her room, only about the change she’s making. Her diction is plain and
unemotional also. She says her wardrobe was “adequate” and a day “sufficed” to pack
her trunk. This narrator couldn’t be more different from the other, though they are both
doing the same thing.
Analysis of sample answer A
Though it isn’t perfect, this is a very fine AP essay with many good points about style and
content. The details follow.
Identifies narrators’ attitudes: 8
The essay immediately contrasts the two narrators. One is sentimental, and the other
matter-of-fact about leaving but excited about making a change. The one point this writer
missed was the reference to sadness. Though the writer is correct in saying that the narrator
of Passage One is nostalgic, the narrator also says that in that room he “had lost my gaiety
and happiness during the strife and fever of contention with my guardian” and at another
point refers to “general dejection” — what today would probably be termed depression.
Analyzes rhetorical devices: 7
The essay mentions diction and syntax and gives several very good examples of each,
though more could be made of the syntax. In a general way the test taker tackles point of
view in the introductory paragraph; more specifics on point of view would be better. The
essay doesn’t explicitly say anything about tone, though some points are implied (“Things
are stated matter of factly [sic], not exaggerated.”) The essay could also discuss structure.
Passage One is arranged according to the furnishings in the room — a spatial organization
pattern. Passage Two relies more on narrative, a list of what the narrator did.
Did you notice the word sic in brackets in the preceding quotation? That’s one of the most
useful words in the language. Sic indicates that you’re quoting exactly what’s there, even
though you know something is wrong with the spelling, grammar, or punctuation. In the 
quotation above, sic follows “matter of factly,” which should be written “matter-of-factly.”
Evidence: 7
I like the writer’s use of quotations. A few more would be nice. I can hear you grinding your
teeth. What do you mean, more? How much time do you think I have! I know that time is
tight, and that’s why I’d dump the reference to Byron, which is interesting but irrelevant
here. Take that out and you have room — and time — for a few additional quotations. What
is here is nicely tied to the point the writer is making.

Sample answer B
How does one feel when leaving home? The two passages in this question have first-
person narrators, but the narrators give very different impressions of their feelings
about home. The tone of the first narrator is sad because he is leaving behind some-
thing he loved, even though it was not perfect. The tone of the second narrator is seri-
ous and determined. She is also excited about the future, not sad as the first narrator is.
The tone, diction, imagery, and the way the stories are told convey the narrators’ views
of the change about to take place in their lives.
The tone of the first passage is sad. The narrator has only spent a year and a half in his
room, but he talks about it with affection. He remembers the books he read there and
the things he learned. He talks of all of these things in an affectionate way. He explains
that he remembers this moment, when he left, “distinctly,” after eighteen years have
passed. He spends a lot of time talking about a picture of someone he loved, probably
someone he knew while he was living in that room. At the end of the passage, he realizes
that he is going away “for ever!” The exclamation point emphasizes his sadness. The
tone of the second passage is very different. The narrator explains what she has done to
get ready for the trip. She packs her things in a box and nails a card on it. She gets her
dress ready and her bonnet, gloves, etc. She checks the room one more time. All of this
comes across like a report. At the last minute her excitement leaks out. She “could not
now repose.” She was “too much excited” about the new things coming in her life. She
looks ahead. She nails a card on a box. This shows her determination.
The diction of the passages are also important in conveying the narrators’ attitudes
toward the changes ahead. The first narrator is extreme. He calls his room a “pensive
citadel,” not just a plain bedroom. He is “passionately fond of books,” not just interested
in reading. He thinks of the girl in the picture as “his patron saint,” not a normal girl-
friend. You get the sense that he feels bad about leaving. The diction of the second pas-
sage also tells alot about the narrator. Her dress is “stuff” not precious to her but
ordinary. She doesn’t tell you anything about the contents of the room. She just says
that she “had not a very large wardrobe.” A wardrobe is something you take with you,
but it doesn’t tell you anything about the place she is leaving.
Imagery also says something about the narrators. In passage one you see the picture,
the desk, the hearth, the chair, and you can almost picture the room. In passage two you
see the clothes the narrator will wear. You don’t see the room at all. The first narrator is
attached to the room. The second isn’t. The second narrator is closing a “phase” of her
life and the first has “closed the door for ever!” You know what’s behind the first narra-
tor’s door, but not the second.
331
Chapter 21: The Envelope, Please: Answers and Explanations for Practice Exam Two

Overall, you get much more information about the first narrator. But he doesn’t tell you
where he is going. He goes “for ever” to someplace. The second narrator doesn’t tell you
what she is leaving. She tells you where she is going (to Mrs. Fairfax). The way these
passages are arranged, you know that the first narrator doesn’t want to leave or has
mixed feelings. The second narrator does want to leave and “must watch feverishly
while the change was being accomplished.”
Analysis of sample answer B
This essay has some strengths and some weaknesses. The strengths lie in some surprising
observations; the weaknesses mostly concern overly general statements and repetitious or
unnecessary explanation. Also, the essay is a little disorganized. This writer would have
done better with a little advance planning. Take a look at these details.
Identifies narrators’ attitudes: 6
The narrators’ attitudes are correctly identified in the first paragraph, though “sad” is less
specific than “nostalgic” or “sentimental.” Also, the statement in the first paragraph of the
essay that “[s]he is also excited about the future, not sad as the first narrator is” may imply
that the first narrator is sad about the future, and the passage says nothing about what lies
ahead for that narrator and how he feels about the future. The “serious and determined”
statement about the second narrator is also accurate, as is the idea that she is “excited
about the future.” However, these ideas are not fully developed.
Analyzes rhetorical devices: 4
The writer of this essay makes some good points about the rhetorical devices without devel-
oping them fully. For example, the third paragraph deals with diction, or word choice. The
writer gives some good examples from the first passage, but not enough, and relates the
word choices to the narrator’s attitude only weakly. The writer also misinterprets “stuff,” a
synonym for fabric, in the discussion of the second passage. Furthermore, the writer con-
fuses diction with imagery — the details the writer selects to “show” the scene. Many of the
observations in paragraph three concern imagery (for example, the comments about the
wardrobe). 
Evidence: 4
If you’re in the mood, count the number of quotations in this essay and in the sample answer
A. This essay has far fewer. Passage-based essays rely on the (surprise!) the passages, what
English teachers term “close reading.” This essay would benefit from more examples from
the passages.
Writing: 5
A couple of grammar errors made me grind my teeth (a bad habit, I know), but the grammar
and spelling aren’t bad. Many sentences could be more concise, and some could be com-
bined. For example, the second paragraph ends with a series of short, choppy sentences.

Scoring Essay Three: Friendship
I can almost hear you thinking, “A short one! Nothing to read! Piece of cake.” Well, you’re
partly right. The comment-on-a-quotation essay is easier than, for example, the synthesis
essay because you grasp the question immediately. It’s harder, though, in some ways
because you have to rummage around in your brain to find ideas and evidence for your
response. 
The prompt mentions “history,” and that’s a clue. You don’t have to define friendship as a
relationship between individuals. Countries can be allies or enemies, for example.
As you evaluate your essay, consider these questions:
 Have I communicated a clear point of view on the importance of shared interests
and enemies in friendship? You can say, “Yes, friends must be similar in their tastes,”
or “No, opposites attract.” You can also say something in between, along the lines of
“Usually . . . but sometimes . . . .” However, you have to take a stance that the reader
can recognize.
 Have I provided sufficient evidence? Why do opposites attract? Perhaps what is lack-
ing in one person is present in another, and together they make a whole. Or, friendship
relies on similarity because people are most able to understand each other when they
have like ideas. You don’t have to agree with these ideas, but you do have to present
some reasons in support of your main argument. Once you have the reasons, also
known as supporting points, you still have work to do. Those supporting points won’t
prove themselves! Do you have an example of a pair created by two people (or coun-
tries) that compensated for each other’s weakness? Or an example of a strong bond
that arose between people on the same wavelength? Great. Drop those examples into
the essay.
Though the prompt states that you may refer to history, literature or other arts, or per-
sonal experience, you actually have to tap into one or more of those areas in order to
make a case for your view of friendship. The “may” is a disguised command and pops
up on the AP from time to time. Be sure to read it as “must.”
 How’s my writing? This question appears in every essay grid in this book, so you
probably know the drill by now. Check your grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Look
at your sentences. Are they complete? Varied in length and pattern? Any repetition or
unnecessary words?

Sample answer A
According to Gaius Sallustius Crispus, “the firmest friendship is based on an identity of
likes and dislikes.” History proves that Crispus was correct, because countries that are
allies often join together because they have common interests and common enemies.
Novelists also affirm the truth of Crispus’s statement. In Jane Austen’s book, Northanger
Abbey, it says that Isabella and Catherine are friends. Really they aren’t, because they
have little in common.

During the 1950s through the 1990s, the countries of Eastern Europe were under the
control of the Soviet Union. These countries had little freedom, and they had to do
everything the Soviet Union ordered. The United States was locked in a “Cold War” with
the Soviet union because our way of life and idea of freedom was the complete opposite
of The Soviet’s. Because they felt threatened by the Soviet Union, the countries of
Western Europe were happy to join with the United States in the NATO alliance. Also,
attitudes of the people in those Western European countries were pro-United States,
because the countries were afraid of the Soviets. The common enemy, the Soviet Union,
made many allies for the United States. The common interests were in building a strong
trading partnership and a strong defensive alliance. Once the Soviet Union collapsed,
the countries of Eastern Europe were free. Now the Western European countries drifted
away from their traditional friendship with the U.S. They were more interested in joining
the European Common Market than in working with the U.S. The loss of a shared enemy
harmed the relationship. 
In Austen’s Northanger Abbey, a young girl named Catherine Morland goes to Bath,
where she meets Isabella. At first it appears as though the girls are firm friends. Isabella
is going to marry Catherine’s brother, and Capt. Tilney, an officer who flirts with Isabella,
is a common enemy. Later Captain Tilney and Isabella form a relationship and Isabella
breaks off her engagement with Catherine’s brother. Catherine loses a friend. But she
doesn’t, really. She thought that her own values — honesty and loyalty — were shared
by Isabella, which was a mistake. The values that Catherine saw in Isabella were illu-
sions. Isabella cared only about money and about making a good “match.” In the end,
Catherine finds a true friend in Eleanor Tilney, who really does have the same ideas and
values. Their friendship will last, not fall apart.
I have had several experiences with friendship also. Some friends that I thought I would
be with forever aren’t a part of my life anymore, and some remain. The ones I care about
the most are those that, while on the surface may be different, in reality are just like me
on the inside.
Analysis of sample answer A
This writer has come up with a fairly good essay, with a defined argument and reasonable
support for it. The essay has a fair amount of detail and competent writing. Overall, a good
effort. Here are the details: 
Clear point of view: 6
By the time you hit the end of the first paragraph, you know that this essay-writer agrees
with Gaius Sallustius Crispus. The essay stays on that note throughout the first three para-
graphs. However, the last paragraph strays into general statements and is a little confusing.
Evidence: 5
This test taker gets points for thinking outside the box. Countries can be friends or enemies,
not just individual people. The Soviet Union/NATO point, therefore, is a good one, though it’s
not particularly well developed. Isabella and Catherine, the characters from Northanger
Abbey, are a more obvious choice, but this writer has interpreted their bond in an interesting
way. They appear to have similar interests, but their values don’t match. The last supporting
point (“I have had several experiences with friendship . . .”) is the weakest. It’s obvious, and
it’s also presented almost as an afterthought.
Writing: 5
If you read this one aloud, you hear some awkward sentences. It sounds good but not great.
On the other hand, the essay has a logical structure and fairly correct grammar and spelling.

Sample answer B
The Roman historian Gaius Sallustius Crispus (1st century B.C.E.) was wrong when he
said that the “firmest friendship is based on an identity of likes and dislikes.” Just imagine
a pair that never disagrees about anything. How can they maintain any sort of interest?
The old saying, opposites attract, is true for friendship, not only for love. Challenging a
friend, disagreeing vehemently, adds spice to life, and brings life to any relationship.
This is true in the arts, in Shakespeare’s play, King Lear. It is also true in my own life with
my friend.
In Shakespeare’s great play, King Lear, the old king divides his kingdom among his three
daughters. All three appear to be friends with the king. They are his daughters and his
subjects, so they are bound to him by two bonds. When the king is ready to divide the
kingdom, he asks each daughter to speak about her relationship with the king. Two of
the daughters, Goneril and Regan, offer loving tributes to the king. They appear to agree
with everything he says. He feels close to them, and he wants to give them power.
Cordelia, on the other hand, faces the king in a different way. She’s not afraid to disagree
with him, and she won’t offer him any love. So what happens? The foolish old king
divides the kingdom in half and Cordelia is left with nothing. At the end of the play the
king has been betrayed by his older daughters and realizes that Cordelia is the one he
should have listened to. Though she disagrees with him, she is loyal to him, she is a
true friend.
Another example of friendship that is strong because the participants don’t resemble
each other too much occurs in my own life. When I was five years old, I was sitting out-
side my house when a young girl a year older, skated by. She literally fell on my feet. I
helped her up, and that started a friendship that lasted all my life. From that day on we
played together constantly. But we didn’t ever want to do the same things. She likes ath-
letics, so she is always taking me along to tennis, softball, and other sports. When it’s
my turn to decide what we’re doing, we go to poetry readings or to see films. She com-
plains about the “boring stuff you make me do” and I complain about the sore muscles I
have after one of our marathon exercise sessions. However, I still want to see her and
she still wants to see me. She challenges my body, and I challenge her mind. Not only
that, but we don’t agree on politics either. We joke that when we go to vote, we cancel
each other out — in school elections or in (when we’re old enough) national elections —
we are against each other. I get angry at her ideas sometimes, but I always think about
them. Sometimes I change my own position because of something she said. The reverse
is also true.
Next year my friend and I will part. I hope that I will find someone like her in college,
even though I know I’ll be up late arguing. King Lear didn’t value argument, and he paid
the price.

Analysis of sample answer B
This writer tried, but the essay falls short of its goals in all three categories. Take a look at
this analysis of its strengths and weaknesses. 
Clear point of view: 4
Right away you know that this essay writer disagrees with Gaius Sallustius Crispus. However,
the problem is that the writer didn’t fully understand the ancient Roman’s point and there-
fore didn’t develop her point of view as she should have. The test taker goes on and on about
disagreement in Lear and pastimes in her personal friendship. Thus the writer addresses the
importance of shared interests or beliefs, not shared interests and beliefs. She’s chopped the
question into two halves and allowed one example to answer each half. That’s not terrible,
but it’s not the ideal response.
Evidence: 3
This essay provides two examples, one from literature and one from personal experience.
The King Lear paragraph is seriously flawed. In the play, Lear asks for flattery from his daugh-
ters, not agreement on a serious issue. Cordelia refuses to try out for the Golden Shovel
Award, given to the person who piles on the most flattery. She simply states what she thinks.
The conflict doesn’t arise from a lack of “likes and dislikes.” Instead it arises from honesty/
dishonesty issues. The personal example is better, though some of the material (who cares
how they met?) is off topic.
Writing: 3
This essay is marred by quite a few grammar errors — not quite enough to make the overall
score a 2, but almost. (The College Board requires graders to give no more than 2 points total
to an essay with distracting grammar and/or spelling errors.) Read the essay aloud; it sounds
choppy and awkward, the product of an immature writer.
Overall score: 3
Math time:

The Part of Tens

In this part . . . 
C
an you count to ten? Good, because in this part — the
legendary For Dummies Part of Tens — you get to
count up ten ways to kill your essay score (and learn ten
ways to avoid bombing out on this portion of the exam).
Here you also discover ten ways to become a better writer
without breaking a sweat. Ready? Let the countdown begin.

Chapter 22
Ten Ways to Kill Your Essay Score
In This Chapter
 Avoiding costly errors in the essay section
 Identifying crucial tactics for your essays
T
wo hours, plus a measly fifteen minutes of extra reading time, takes you from “the essay
section is about to begin” to “thank goodness that’s over.” This chapter radically affects
your mood at the endpoint. If you avoid the score-destroying methods I describe in this
chapter, you’ll be pleased when you put down your pen and seal your booklet. If you 
don’t . . . well, I won’t go there because neither will you.
Not Answering the Question They Ask
The prompts in the essay section exist for one reason only: You’re supposed to respond to
them. If you’re a free spirit marching to a different drummer, save your wonderful, eccentric
self-expression for another day. When the AP exam writers ask a question, they want you to
answer it. An essay that doesn’t address the prompt receives no points — a big fat zero. And
won’t that score do wonders for your essay average?
Many prompts assign more than one job: For example, to identify the author’s purpose and
to discuss the rhetorical devices she employs to achieve that purpose. Be sure to tackle
everything in the prompt, or you doom yourself to partial credit.
Skipping an Essay
Another no-score situation occurs when you run out of time and leave an essay blank. If
you’re apt to find yourself here, I have three words for you: Buy a watch. Now I have three
more words: Check the watch. And finally, I have two words: Pace yourself. 
You have roughly forty minutes of writing time for each essay. Make a schedule that suits
your strengths. (Chapter 16 helps you with time management.) For example, you may decide
to allot seven minutes for prewriting and seven minutes for polishing and revising. That plan
leaves you about twenty-six minutes of actual writing time per essay. During the exam, follow
the plan you made. Don’t spend fifty-six minutes writing one essay, no matter how much you
have to say. Remember, a blank earns you zero points.

Limiting Yourself to Summary
The synthesis essay, with its array of six or more sources, may tempt you to report or sum-
marize what you read. Resist that temptation. The synthesis directions specifically require
you to develop a position on the issue at hand and to support that position with ideas or
quotations from three of the six sources. If you don’t formulate a thesis and limit yourself to
summary, you earn no more than two points out of a possible nine. 
Similarly, an argument essay requires you to take a stand in response to a description, quota-
tion, or short passage. If one of these questions shows up on your AP exam, don’t go into
wishy-washy mode, trying to please everyone by expressing no firm opinion. Decide what you
believe and make your case. Of course, you should always acknowledge the merits of another
position, and your own stance may be nuanced — agreeing or disagreeing conditionally. Just
be sure you have an identifiable position.
Getting Sloppy with Grammar and Spelling
Your total score for an individual essay question may be no higher than two if the grammar
and spelling are so poor that the grader has trouble reading your work. You don’t have to be
perfect; the graders know that you’re working under pressure. A couple of missteaks . . . er,
make that mistakes . . . are not a problem. An unreadable tangle of words, however, ties your
grader into a knot. Before the big day, spend some quality time with Chapter 7. Also, leave a
few minutes (about five) to recheck and polish each essay your write.
Writing Illegibly
Does your handwriting resemble a trail of ink left by a pen tied to your pet frog’s foot? I 
sympathize — with the frog and with your AP exam grader. I even sympathize with you; it can’t
be fun to have handwriting that bad. If you do tend toward illegibility, practice your penman-
ship well in advance of the AP exam. (And if practice doesn’t help, check with your teacher or
guidance counselor. You may have dysgraphia, a condition that merits accommodations — 
usually a computer — on the exam.) If the grader has trouble reading your work, you may not
receive proper credit. 
Not Citing Sources
The synthesis essay tests your ability to gather and process information from a variety of
sources. It also tests your honesty. If you omit source citations, you’re essentially saying that
everything in your essay originated in your own brain. Not true! To avoid committing an aca-
demic felony, cite sources for quotations and for ideas taken from the reading material pro-
vided, even if you express those ideas in your own words. (For help with citation format, turn
to Chapter 13.)
342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Sticking to a Formula
Lots of schools teach the five-paragraph essay, which also goes by the name of “direct-style
theme.” The format is simple. The first paragraph is the introduction. It contains a thesis
statement and mentions three supporting points. Each body paragraph addresses one sup-
porting point. The conclusion restates the thesis and supporting points, summarizing what
you wrote. The five-paragraph essay is popular because (a) it’s easy to teach and (b) it’s easy
to write. The problem with this sturdy, basic structure is that too many students write it on
auto-pilot, adding no “pizzazz” or originality to the formula they learned in elementary
school. On the AP English Language and Composition exam you’re supposed to be a mature
writer, ready for tougher challenges. You can’t pedal through the essay section with the writ-
ing equivalent of training wheels. Instead, you have to demonstrate that you can cut a
wheelie or two and make the essay your own. A standard, one-size-fits-all, formulaic essay
will earn you two or three points, tops. 
Overemphasizing One Idea
Chances are you’ve got a bunch of ideas for your essay — perhaps five or six points of more
or less equal importance for an analysis essay. You start off on one of those points, digging
into the author’s use of figurative language. You go on and on — and on and on — about the
metaphors, similes, hyperbole, and other figures of speech. Three pages later you glance at
the clock. It’s almost time to move on to the next essay. (You’ve made a time plan, as you
should, and you’re keeping to it.) So you cover syntax, diction, and imagery in the final para-
graph, and stop.
Uh oh. Your essay is a tilter. It leans hard in one direction (figurative language) and barely
touches the ground when it comes to other important subtopics. You’ll earn some points,
maybe three, but not much more. Because although you receive credit for your in-depth
analysis of figurative language, the grader will sit there muttering, “Yeah, but what about the
other stuff.” Moral of the story: Don’t overemphasize one idea and ignore everything else.
Playing for Laughs
I like funny writing. I read For Dummies books for exactly that reason, and my enjoyment of
humor is probably a factor in my choosing to write them as well. But even I get annoyed when
I read a silly response to a serious question. To put it another way: The AP English Language
and Composition exam is not the time to try out your standup comedy routine. Particularly
annoying, and therefore particularly costly when it comes to your score, are comments that
make fun of the AP exam, the essay question, the passage you’re responding to, or the fact
that you’re writing an essay. Yes, in this book I mock most of those things, and yes, they some-
times deserve mockery. However, all writers must consider purpose and audience. 
For Dummies books are known for conveying solid information to people who like to laugh
while they learn, so you expected some jokes when you bought the book. The AP is different.
Your purpose is to score high on the exam, and your audience is an over-caffeinated group of
people who have devoted their lives to literature and writing. An AP essay that explains how
boring the passage is or expounds on the flaws of the “typical English teacher” loses points.
343
Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Kill Your Essay Score

Lots of points. I can’t give you a number, because there’s too much room for variation. One
little joke tucked into a mountain of good rhetorical analysis won’t do as much harm as ten
lengthy wisecracks surrounding a tiny nugget of rhetorical analysis. But why take risks? Play
it safe by taking the exam seriously.
Ignoring the Passage
Most AP essay prompts are based on one or more passages of literature. Ignore AP passages
at your peril! The passage is the source of information and ideas for the synthesis essay, the
proof you cite to support your position. Furthermore, the passage is what you have to dig
into when you’re writing an analysis essay, the material that you dissect.
This advice may seem like a no-brainer, but a surprising number of people see the passage as
a jumping-off point, a sort of trampoline into another area entirely. Imagine a question about
the author’s attitude, something like “analyze the rhetorical devices the author uses to convey
her attitude toward marriage.” Faced with this prompt, some test takers move into history.
They write long paragraphs about the status of women in the time period or throw in com-
ments about marriage throughout history. This approach is riddled with problems. First of all,
you may not be able to place the passage in the appropriate time period; the AP doesn’t
always identify the work. Second, you may misunderstand some historical information.
History errors don’t necessarily lower your grade, but they may lead to a misinterpretation of
the passage. Also, if you discuss historical context in your essay, you may never get to the
actual question (rhetorical analysis).

Chapter 23
Ten Painless Ways to Become 
a Better Writer
In This Chapter
 Cultivating better writing habits
 Pursuing activities that increase writing skill
T
he AP English Language and Composition exam is all about writing — how to formulate
an argument, why a particular strategy is best for your purpose, how content and style
interrelate, and so forth. Not surprisingly, good writers enjoy a huge advantage on this
exam. They breeze through the essays, and even the multiple-choice questions (which are,
after all, about other people’s writing) are easier for trained writers.
I’m sure that you’ve been pouring your brains onto paper in English class and in most of your
other courses at school. You may also be fond of writing for your own purposes — to express
your emotions, to state your opinions, and to gain an outlet for your creativity. But no matter
how good you are, you can take your writing to the next level with a few (well, ten, actually)
painless activities. Ready to “kick it up a notch,” as the television chef says? Read on.
Reading the Writer’s Way
Your teachers assign homework. So do I, though I know it’s cruel and unusual punishment.
(I apologize, but I have no choice. Homework is in the job description under the “torture stu-
dents” clause.) Some of your homework is reading — a novel for English, a chapter for his-
tory, a lab-project sheet for science, and so on. Maybe you’ll feel better about homework if
you consider one possible side effect. While you absorb facts from reading, you can also pick
up information on writing — a sort of “two for the price of one” deal. Reading the writer’s
way also serves you well during the multiple-choice portion of the exam, where you’re asked
to analyze the rhetorical techniques of several passages.
Read your course material with writing style in mind:  How did the scientist explain that
experiment? Did the historian choose cause-and-effect or compare-contrast as a rhetorical
strategy? (Check out Chapter 6 for more information on rhetorical strategies.) You can
indulge in criticism too. Was any step in the science packet unclear? How could you make it
better? These questions take nanoseconds to answer, but the effort pays off. As you notice
how each writer accomplished a task, you discover a model for your own efforts. 

Listening as a Writer
I live in New York City, so I have a lot of company whenever I leave my apartment. And believe
me, New Yorkers talk. If they’re not on a cell phone, they’re chatting with the guy next to them
on the subway. (Plus, I must admit, quite a few people in this city talk to themselves.)
Generally, I don’t mind this constant hum of conversation. I pick up some really strange infor-
mation, and, as a bonus, I learn something about writing. That couple on the bus arguing
about which restaurant is better? They’re teaching me to provide concrete information to bol-
ster my position. (The wife said the dumplings were soggy, but her husband countered with a
full paragraph on the best dumpling recipes and then moved on to restaurant reviews citing
those soggy dumplings as “spectacular.” He won, hands down.) That squawking message from
the subway employee? He taught me that a writer should never leave an ambiguous pronoun
hanging in the air when he announced that “the platform is under construction, so this train
will stop short and passengers should step on it carefully.” Hm...m. Am I stepping on the train
carefully? or on the platform?
You can listen like a writer no matter where you live. Pay attention to your friends, your
teachers, and everyone around you. Notice how people explain things; your exposition tech-
nique will improve. Check out people’s stories; your understanding of narrative will deepen. I
could go on, but you get the point. So clean your ears and get started!
Arguing for Fun and Profit
The AP exam tests your ability to construct an argument. Fine. Go argue! Don’t be rude, and
choose opponents who are willing to participate in this exercise. I don’t recommend practic-
ing argument when you come home twelve hours after curfew. In that sort of situation, apolo-
gize, take your lumps, and move on. Argue about ideas: Should the voting age be lowered?
Where does my right to a quiet home end and your right to learn how to play the tuba begin?
How much power should the school board have to shape curriculum and school policy? And
why is that candidate your choice in the latest election? 
As you argue, consciously refine your style. Notice what works and what doesn’t. The tech-
niques of oral argument, of course, aren’t exactly the same as those you employ in writing.
However, much can be adapted. And if arguing appeals to you, consider joining the debate
club, the Model United Nations or Junior States club, or other activities that foster intellec-
tual discussion.
Watching Television
Ah, the joy. A teacher is actually recommending television. In fact, if I could, I’d assign televi-
sion for homework. (Don’t get too excited. I draw the line at video games.) Here’s how televi-
sion teaches you about writing: People appear on television. When they talk, they make a point,
tell a story, exchange information, argue, discuss, and do a million other things with words.
Some television people are articulate; they express themselves clearly and concisely. Others
are tongue-tied; whenever they speak, you wish they’d expend a few more words. Others have
the opposite problem; they blather on for far too long, expressing far too little content.
You can learn about writing from good speakers, but — and this fact may surprise you — you
can also learn from bad speakers because they show you what not to do. 
Cop shows, especially the ones that end with a dramatic courtroom scene, are especially
helpful because the lawyers must convince the jury to see the situation a certain way —
exactly what you have to do on the AP when you write an argument essay.
346
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Blogging and Journal Writing
Old-fashioned pen and paper or new-fashioned blogs both serve the same purpose: They
allow you to write down the important events of your life. What a great way to practice narra-
tive! They also give you a spot to express your feelings on issues that provoke you. There
you go: argument practice. You don’t have to be as formal in a blog or a journal as you do on
the AP exam, but even that fact reinforces an important lesson about rhetoric. Writers must
consider their audience — friends for a blog, superstrict grader for the AP. As you tailor your
style to suit the reader, you practice rhetorical skills.
Working for School Publications
The newspaper, literary magazine, and any other publications sponsored by your school
offer excellent opportunities for writing, editing, and layout. The first two contribute to your
writing skills in an obvious way, but even layout chores can be beneficial. You have to read
the stuff you’re laying out, and sometimes you have to cut pieces a little to make them fit.
There’s a lesson on concise writing and priorities. Also, layout editors are usually allowed to
choose “pull quotations” — bits of text that are boxed and highlighted. The pull quotation
must represent an important aspect of the article, thus giving the layout editor a lesson on
main idea. Sometimes the pull quotations come from interviews. What a great way to think
about attitude and characterization!
Deconstructing Advertisements
Madison Avenue exists to change your mind. The copywriters who work in the legendary
center of America’s advertising industry, whether their efforts appear in print or on the
Internet or on television, have the same goal — to make you think the way they want you to
think. Thus you can pick up valuable writing techniques from advertisements. Especially
these days, when one click of the remote or mouse changes what you see, copywriters spe-
cialize in grabbing you, making the point effectively, and letting you go as soon as possible.
(The “as soon as possible” part stems from the fact that advertising time is expensive.) 
When you write an AP essay, your task is quite similar to a copywriter’s. You have to make
the grader think the way you do about a passage or an issue, and you have to do so as
quickly as possible. (Here the speed requirement comes from the scarcity of minutes you
have at your disposal.) When you surf the Internet, flip through a magazine or newspaper, or
watch television, pay attention to the advertisements. Ask yourself, “What are they selling?”
Then ask, “How are they selling it?” The second question is where all the action is, in terms
of writing improvement. The ad may be hawking a new breakfast product, but the advertise-
ment may showcase happy families, stress-free parents, well-nourished kids, or many other
things. Take note of the means, and you’ll add a few more weapons to your writing arsenal.
Solving Crossword Puzzles
I know that you’re not going to write crossword clues or answers during the AP exam.
However, you certainly need words — lots of them — for your own essays and to decode the
meaning of others’ writing. Solving crossword puzzles inserts new vocabulary into your
brain in the smoothest, sneakiest possible way. You learn a ton when you play with puzzles,
and you enjoy yourself also. Start with easy puzzles and work your way up to harder ones.
Newspapers and magazines are good sources; you can also buy crossword collections.
347
Chapter 23: Ten Painless Ways to Become a Better Writer

Just because you know the denotation (definition) of a word doesn’t mean you’re ready to
insert it into an essay. A word also has a connotation — the emotions and ideas associated
with it. Be sure you know both connotation and denotation before counting a word as part of
your writing vocabulary. (Chapter 4 discusses connotation in more detail.)
Spotting Grammar Errors
Keep this one to yourself, unless you want to lose all your friends. I am a grammarian, and as
such, I often hear little mistakes — a “whom” instead of a “who,” an expression such as “if I
would have known,” and similar errors. I don’t correct the speaker (I don’t want to lose my
friends either), but I do make a quick restatement inside my head. I also spot grammatical
problems on signs and in the media. The practice keeps my grammar skills sharp and will do
the same for you.
Becoming an Activist
What do you care about? The environment? Politics? School policy? Whatever it is, get
involved. Join a campaign or start one yourself. As an activist, you convince others to join
your cause. You make speeches or write letters to the editor of the local or national paper.
You argue, discuss, research, report, and do a dozen other things. And you have the satisfac-
tion of knowing that you’re trying to change the world for the better. The side-effect, and it’s
a good one, is that your writing skills improve.
