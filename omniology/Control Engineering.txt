Preface
Preface
It is almost four years since the first edition of this book so it seemed appropriate to reread it carefully again 
and make any suitable changes. Also during the intervening period I have added two further bookboon 
books one on ‘An Introduction to Nonlinearity in Control Systems’ and another very recently on ‘Control 
Engineering Problems with Solutions’. This later book contains worked examples and some problems 
with answers only, which cover the material in this book and ‘An Introduction to Nonlinearity in Control 
Systems’. It is hoped that the relevant chapters of ‘Control Engineering Problems with Solutions’ will help 
the reader gain a better understanding and deeper knowledge of the topics covered in this textbook.
Minor changes have been made to this second edition mainly with respect to a few changes in wording, 
but sadly despite repeated reading a few minor technical errors were found and corrected, for which 
I apologise. These were Figure 3.6 which had some incorrect markings and was not very clear due to 
the numbers chosen giving lines almost on top of each other. This has been corrected by choosing a 
different frequency for illustrating the frequency response calculation procedure. Further, some negative 
signs were omitted from equation (2.14), the units of H on page 50 were given incorrectly as were the 
subscripts on the a’s and a matrix in the material in section 10.5.1, page 131, on transforming to the 
controllable canonical form. Finally the cover page has been changed to contain a picture which is more 
relevant to the book.

Introduction
1	 Introduction
1.1	
What is Control Engineering?
As its name implies control engineering involves the design of an engineering product or system where 
a requirement is to accurately control some quantity, say the temperature in a room or the position or 
speed of an electric motor. To do this one needs to know the value of the quantity being controlled, so 
that being able to measure is fundamental to control. In principle one can control a quantity in a so called 
open loop manner where ‘knowledge’ has been built up on what input will produce the required output, 
say the voltage required to be input to an electric motor for it to run at a certain speed. This works well 
if the ‘knowledge’ is accurate but if the motor is driving a pump which has a load highly dependent on 
the temperature of the fluid being pumped then the ‘knowledge’ will not be accurate unless information 
is obtained for different fluid temperatures. But this may not be the only practical aspect that affects the 
load on the motor and therefore the speed at which it will run for a given input, so if accurate speed 
control is required an alternative approach is necessary.
This alternative approach is the use of feedback whereby the quantity to be controlled, say C, is measured, 
compared with the desired value, R, and the error between the two,
E = R – C used to adjust C. This gives the classical feedback loop structure of Figure 1.1.
In the case of the control of motor speed, where the required speed, R, known as the reference is either 
fixed or moved between fixed values, the control is often known as a regulatory control, as the action 
of the loop allows accurate speed control of the motor for the aforementioned situation in spite of the 
changes in temperature of the pump fluid which affects the motor load. In other instances the output C 
may be required to follow a changing R, which for example, might be the required position movement 
of a robot arm. The system is then often known as a servomechanism and many early textbooks in the 
control engineering field used the word servomechanism in their title rather than control.

Introduction
The use of feedback to regulate a system has a long history [1.1, 1.2], one of the earliest concepts, used in 
Ancient Greece, was the float regulator to control water level, which is still used today in water tanks. The 
first automatic regulator for an industrial process is believed to have been the flyball governor developed 
in 1769 by James Watt. It was not, however, until the wartime period beginning in 1939, that control 
engineering really started to develop with the demand for servomechanisms for munitions fire control 
and guidance. With the major improvements in technology since that time the applications of control 
have grown rapidly and can be found in all walks of life. Control engineering has, in fact, been referred 
to as the ‘unseen technology’ as so often people are unaware of its existence until something goes wrong. 
Few people are, for instance, aware of its contribution to the development of storage media in digital 
computers where accurate head positioning is required. This started with the magnetic drum in the 
50’s and is required today in disk drives where position accuracy is of the order of 1µm and movement 
between tracks must be done in a few ms.
Feedback is, of course, not just a feature of industrial control but is found in biological, economic and 
many other forms of system, so that theories relating to feedback control can be applied to many walks 
of life.
1.2	
Contents of the Book
The book is concerned with theoretical methods for continuous linear feedback control system design, 
and is primarily restricted to single-input single-output systems. Continuous linear time invariant systems 
have linear differential equation mathematical models and are always an approximation to a real device 
or system. All real systems will change with time due to age and environmental changes and may only 
operate reasonably linearly over a restricted range of operation. There is, however, a rich theory for the 
analysis of linear systems which can provide excellent approximations for the analysis and design of real 
world situations when used within the correct context. Further, simulation is now an excellent means 
to support linear theoretical studies as model errors, such as the affects of neglected nonlinearity, can 
easily be assessed.
There are a total of 11 chapters and some appendices, the major one being Appendix A on Laplace 
transforms. The next chapter provides a brief description of the forms of mathematical model 
representations used in control engineering analysis and design. It does not deal with mathematical 
modelling of engineering devices, which is a huge subject and is best dealt with in the discipline covering 
the subject, since the devices or components could be electrical, mechanical, hydraulic etc. Suffice to say 
that one hopes to obtain an approximate linear mathematical model for these components so that their 
effect in a system can be investigated using linear control theory. The mathematical models discussed 
are the linear differential equation, the transfer function and a state space representation, together with 
the notations used for them in MATLAB.

Introduction
Chapter 3 discusses transfer functions, their zeros and poles, and their responses to different inputs. The 
following chapter discusses in detail the various methods for plotting steady state frequency responses 
with Bode, Nyquist and Nichols plots being illustrated in MATLAB. Hopefully sufficient detail, which is 
brief when compared with many textbooks, is given so that the reader clearly understands the information 
these plots provide and more importantly understands the form of frequency response expected from 
a specific transfer function.
The material of chapters 2–4 could be covered in other courses as it is basic systems theory, there having 
been no mention of control, which starts in chapter 5. The basic feedback loop structure shown in 
Figure 1.1 is commented on further, followed by a discussion of typical performance specifications which 
might have to be met in both the time and frequency domains. Steady state errors are considered both 
for input and disturbance signals and the importance and properties of an integrator are discussed from 
a physical as well as mathematical viewpoint. The chapter concludes with a discussion on stability and 
a presentation of several results including the Mikhailov criterion, which is rarely mentioned in English 
language texts. Chapter 6 first introduces the properties of a time delay before continuing with further 
material relating to the analysis and properties of the closed loop. Briefly mentioned are the root locus 
and its plotting using MATLAB and various concepts of relative stability. These include gain and phase 
margins, sensitivity functions, and M and N circles.
Chapter 7 is a relatively long chapter dealing with classical controller design methods. The basic concept 
of classical control design is that one decides on a suitable control strategy and then the design problem 
becomes one of obtaining appropriate parameters for the controller elements in order to meet specified 
control performance objectives. Typically a controller with a specified structure is placed in either the 
forward or feedback paths, or even both, of the closed loop. The first point discussed is therefore the 
difference between a feedforward and a feedback controller on the closed loop transfer function. The 
design of lead and lag controllers is then discussed followed by a long section on PID control, a topic 
on which far too much has probably been written in the literature in recent years due in no part to its 
extensive use in practice. The early work of Ziegler and Nichols is the starting point which largely focuses 
on the control of a plant with a time constant plus time delay. By dealing with this plant in so called 
normalised form, where its behaviour is expressible in terms of the time delay to time constant ratio, 
new results are presented comparing various suggested parameter settings, usually known as tuning, 
for PID controllers. It is pointed out that if a mathematical model is obtained for the plant then the 
principles and possibilities for obtaining parameters for a PID controller are no different to those which 
may be used for any other type of controller. However a major contribution of Ziegler and Nichols in 
their loop cycling method was to show how the PID controller parameters might be chosen without a 
mathematical model, but simply from knowledge of the so called plant transfer function critical point, 
namely the magnitude and frequency of the transfer function for 180° phase shift. Its modern equivalent 
is known as relay autotuning and this topic is covered in some detail at the end of the chapter.

Introduction
The controller design concepts presented in the previous chapter based on open loop frequency response 
compensation were regularly used in the early days of control engineering by designers who were adept 
at sketching Bode diagrams, so that the use of modern software has simply brought more efficiency to the 
design process. Some significant theoretical work on optimising controller parameters to meet specific 
performance criteria was also done in the early days but here the limitation was the difficulty of using 
the theory to obtain results of significance. With modern computation tools numerical approaches can 
be used to solve these problems either by writing MATLAB programs based on linear system theory 
or writing optimisation programs around digital simulations in programs such as SIMULINK. These 
are appropriate industrial design methods which appear to receive little attention in textbooks, possibly 
because they are not suitable for traditional examinations. Chapter 8 covers parameter optimisation 
based on integral performance criteria because it allows some simple results to be obtained and concepts 
understood. Further it leads to a design approach based on closed loop transfer function synthesis, 
known as standard forms, presented at the end of the chapter. Chapter 9 discusses further aspects of 
classical controller design and highlights the difficulty of trying to design series compensators for, so 
called uncertain plants, plants whose parameters may vary or not be accurately known. This leads to 
consideration of some elegant recent results on uncertain plants but which unfortunately appear too 
conservative for practical use in many instances.
The final two chapters are concerned with the use of state space methods in control system analysis 
and design. Chapter 10 provides basic coverage of state space concepts covering state equations and 
their solution, state transformations, state representations of transfer functions, and controllability 
and observability. Some state space design methods are covered in Chapter 11, including state variable 
feedback, LQR design and state variable feedback design to achieve the closed loop standard forms of 
chapter 8.

Introduction
Control systems exist in many fields of engineering so that components of a control system may be 
electrical, mechanical, hydraulic etc. devices. If a system has to be designed to perform in a specific 
way then one needs to develop descriptions of how the outputs of the individual components, which 
make up the system, will react to changes in their inputs. This is known as mathematical modelling and 
can be done either from the basic laws of physics or from processing the input and output signals, in 
which case it is known as identification. Examples of physical modelling include deriving differential 
equations for electrical circuits involving resistance, inductance and capacitance and for combinations 
of masses, springs and dampers in mechanical systems. It is not the intent here to derive models for 
various devices which may be used in control systems but to assume that a suitable approximation will 
be a linear differential equation. In practice an improved model might include nonlinear effects, for 
example Hooke’s Law for a spring in a mechanical system is only linear over a certain range; or account 
for time variations of components. Mathematical models of any device will always be approximate, even 
if nonlinear effects and time variations are also included by using more general nonlinear or time varying 
differential equations. Thus, it is always important in using mathematical models to have an appreciation 
of the conditions under which they are valid and to what accuracy.
Starting therefore with the assumption that our model is a linear differential equation then in general 
it will have the form:-
A(D)y(t) = B(D)u(t)
(2.1)
where D denotes the differential operator d/dt. A(D) and B(D) are polynomials in D with Di = di / dti, 
 the ith derivative, u(t) is the model input and y(t) its output. So that one can write

In order to solve an nth order differential equation, that is determine the output y for a given input u, one 
must know the initial conditions of y and its first n-1 derivatives. For example if a projectile is falling 
under gravity, that is constant acceleration, so that D2y= constant, where y is the height, then in order 
to find the time taken to fall to a lower height, one must know not only the initial height, normally 
assumed to be at time zero, but the initial velocity, dy/dt, that is two initial conditions as the equation is 
second order (n = 2). Control engineers typically study solutions to differential equations using either 
Laplace transforms or a state space representation.
2.2	
The Laplace Transform and Transfer Functions
A short introduction to the Laplace transformation is given in Appendix A for the reader who is not 
familiar with its use. It is an integral transformation and its major, but not sole use, is for differential 
equations where the independent time variable t is transformed to the complex variable s by the expression

Since the exponential term has no units the units of s are seconds-1, that is using mks notation s has 
units of s-1. If  denotes the Laplace transform then one may write [f(t)] = F(s) and 
-1[F(s)] = f(t). The 
relationship is unique in that for every f(t), [F(s)], there is a unique F(s), [f(t)]. It is shown in Appendix 
A that when the n-1 initial conditions, Dn-1y(0) are zero the Laplace transform of Dny(t) is snY(s). Thus 
the Laplace transform of the differential equation (2.1) with zero initial conditions can be written

Since the a and b coefficients of the polynomials are real numbers the roots of the polynomials are 
either real or complex pairs. The transfer function is zero for those values of s which are the roots of 
B(s), so these values of s are called the zeros of the transfer function. Similarly, the transfer function 
will be infinite at the roots of the denominator polynomial A(s), and these values are called the poles 
of the transfer function. The general transfer function (2.9) thus has m zeros and n poles and is said 
to have a relative degree of n-m, which can be shown from physical realisation considerations cannot 
be negative. Further for n > m it is referred to as a strictly proper transfer function and for n ≥ m as a 
proper transfer function.

When the input u(t) to the differential equation of (2.1) is constant the output y(t) becomes constant when 
all the derivatives of the output are zero. Thus the steady state gain, or since the input is often thought of

When the transfer function is known in the zero-pole form then the location of its zeros and poles can 
be shown on an s plane zero-pole plot, where the zeros are marked with a circle and the poles by a cross. 
The information on this plot then completely defines the transfer function apart from the gain K. In 
most instances engineers prefer to keep any complex roots in quadratic form, thus for example writing

rather than writing (s + 0.5 + j0.866)(s + 0.5 – j0.866) for the quadratic term in the denominator. This 
transfer function has K = 4, a zero at -1, three poles at -2, -0.5 ± 0.866 respectively, and the zero-pole 
plot is shown in Figure 2.1

Mathematical Model Representations of

For this choice of state vector the representation is often known as the phase variable representation. 
The solution for no input, that is u = 0, from an initial state can be plotted in an x1-x2 plane, known 
as a phase plane with time a parameter on the solution trajectory. Equation (2.17) is a state equation 
and (2.18) an output equation and together they provide a state space representation of the differential 
equation or the system described by the differential equation.
Since this system has one input, u, and one output, y, it is often referred to as a single-input single-
output (SISO) system. The choice of the state variable x is not unique and more will be said on this later, 
but the point is easily illustrated by considering the simple R-C circuit in Figure 2.2. If one derives the 
differential equation for the output voltage in terms of the input voltage, it will be a second order one 
similar to equation (2.16) and one could choose as in that equation the output, the capacitor voltage, 
and its derivative as the components of the state variable, or simply the states, to have a representation 
similar to equation (2.17). From a physical point of view, however, any initial non zero state will be 
due to charge stored in one or both of the two capacitors and therefore it might be more appropriate to 
choose the voltages of these two capacitors as the states.
Figure 2.2 Simple R-C circuit.
In the state space representation of (2.17) and (2.18) x1 is the same as y so that for the state equation 
(2.18) the transfer function between U(s) and X1(s) is obviously

Mathematical Model Representations of

Thus, in conclusion, a mathematical model of a linear SISO dynamical system may be a differential 
equation, a transfer function or a state space representation. A state space representation has a unique 
transfer function but the reverse is not the case.

Mathematical Models in MATLAB
MATLAB, although not the only language with good facilities for control system design, is easy to use 
and very popular. As well as tools for analysis it also contains a simulation language, SIMULINK, which is 
also very useful. If it has a weakness it is probably with regard to physical modelling but for the contents 
of this book, where our starting point is a mathematical model, this is not a problem. Models of system 
components can be entered into MATLAB either as transfer functions or state space representations. 
A model is an object defined by a symbol, say G, and its transfer function can be entered in the form 
G=tf(num,den) where num and den contain a string of coefficients describing the numerator and 
denominator polynomials respectively. MATLAB statements in the text, such as the above for G, will 
be entered in bold italics but not in program extracts such as that below. The coefficients are entered 
beginning with the highest power of s. 
Thus the transfer function

The >> is the MATLAB prompt and the semicolon at the end of a line suppresses a MATLAB response. 
This has been omitted from the expression for G so MATLAB responds with the transfer function G as 
shown. Alternatively, the entry could have been done in one expression by typing:-
>>G=tf([2 1],[1 4 3])
The roots of a polynomial can be found by typing roots before the coefficient string in square brackets. 
Thus typing:-
>> roots(den)
ans =
-3
-1
Alternatively the transfer function can be entered in zero, pole, gain form where the command is in the 
form G=zpk(zeros,poles,gain)
Thus for the same example
>> G=zpk([-0.5],[-1;-3],2)
Zero/pole/gain:
 2 (s+0.5)
-----------
(s+1) (s+3)
where the values of zeros or poles in a string are separated by a semicolon. Also to enter a string with a 
single number, here used for the value of K but not for the single zero, the square brackets may be omitted.

A state space model or object formed from known A,B,C,D matrices, often denoted by (A,B,C,D),can 
be entered into MATLAB with the command G=ss(A,B,C,D).
Thus for the same example by entering the following commands one defines the state space model
>> A=[0,1;-3,-4];
>> B=[0;1];
>> C=[1,2];
>> D=0;
>> G=ss(A,B,C,D);
And asking afterwards for the transfer function of the model by typing
>> tf(G)
One obtains
Transfer function:
    2 s + 1
-------------
s^2 + 4 s + 3
Obviously the above have been very simple examples but hopefully they have covered the basics of putting 
the mathematical model of a linear dynamical system into MATLAB. The only way to learn is by doing 
examples and since MATLAB has an excellent help facility the reader should not find this difficult. For 
a more extensive coverage of MATLAB routines and examples of their use in control engineering the 
reader is referred to the book given in reference 2.1.
2.5	
Interconnecting Models in MATLAB
Control systems are made up of several components, so as well as describing a component by a 
mathematical model, one needs to deal with the mathematical models for interconnected components. 
Typically a component is represented as a block with input and output signals and labelled, usually with a 
transfer function, say G1(s), as shown in Figure 2.3. Strictly speaking if the block is labelled with a transfer 
function the input and output signals should also be in the s domain, as the block in Figure 2.3 implies
Y(s) = G1(s)U(s)
(2.27)
but it is usually accepted that the time domain notations, y(t) and u(t) for the signals, may also be used.

Figure 2.3 Block representation of a transfer function
When a second block, with transfer function G2(s), is connected to the output of the first block, to give 
a series connection, then it is assumed that in making the connection of Figure 2.4 that the second 
block does not affect the output of the first one. In this case the resultant transfer function of the series 
combination between input u and output y is G1(s)G2(s), which is obtained directly by substitution from the 
individual block relationships X(s)=G1(s)U(s) and Y(s)=G2(s)X(s) where x is the output of the first block.
Figure 2.4 Series (or cascade) connection of blocks
If two system objects G1 and G2 are provided to MATLAB then the system object corresponding to the 
series combination can be obtained by typing G=G1*G2.

If two transfer function models, G1(s) and G2(s) are connected in parallel, as shown in Figure 2.5, then 
the resultant transfer function between the input u and output y is obtained from the relationships  
X1(s) = G1(s)U(s), X2(s) = G2(s)U(s) and Y(s) = X1(s)+X2(s) and is G1(s)+G2(s). It can be obtained in 
MATLAB by typing G=G1+G2
Figure 2.5 Parallel connection of blocks
Another connection of blocks which will be used is the feedback connection shown in Figure 2.6. For 
the negative feedback connection of Figure 2.6 the relationship is Y(s) = G(s)[U(s) – H(s)Y(s)], where the 
expression in the square brackets is the input to G(s). This can be rearranged to give a transfer function 
between the input u and output y of

If this transfer function is denoted by T(s) then the MATLAB command to obtain T(s) is T=feedback(G,H). 
If the positive feedback configuration is required then the statement T=feedback(G,H,sign) can be used 
where the sign = 1. This can also be used for the negative feedback with sign = -1

Transfer Functions and Their Responses
3	 Transfer Functions and Their 
Responses
3.1	
 Introduction
As mentioned previously a major reason for wishing to obtain a mathematical model of a device is to 
be able to evaluate the output in response to a given input. Using the transfer function and Laplace 
transforms provides a particularly elegant way of doing this. This is because for a block with input U(s) 
and transfer function G(s) the output Y(s) = G(s)U(s). When the input, u(t), is a unit impulse which is 
conventionally denoted by δ(t), U(s) = 1 so that the output Y(s) = G(s). Thus in the time domain, y(t) = 
g(t), the inverse Laplace transform of G(s), which is called the impulse response or weighting function of 
the block. The evaluation of y(t) for any input u(t) can be done in the time domain using the convolution 
integral (see Appendix A, theorem (ix))

but it is normally much easier to use the transform relationship Y(s) = G(s)U(s). To do this one needs 
to find the Laplace transform of the input u(t), form the product G(s)U(s) and then find its inverse 
Laplace transform. G(s)U(s) will be a ratio of polynomials in s and to find the inverse Laplace transform, 
the roots of the denominator polynomial must be found to allow the expression to be put into partial 
fractions with each term involving one denominator root (pole). Assuming, for example, the input is a 
unit step so that U(s) = 1/s then putting G(s)U(s) into partial fractions will result in an expression for 
Y(s) of the form

where in the transfer function G(s) = B(s)/A(s), the n poles of G(s) [zeros of A(s)] are αi, i = 1…n and 
the coefficients C0 and Ci, i = 1…n, will depend on the numerator polynomial B(s), and are known as 
the residues at the poles. Taking the inverse Laplace transform yields

Transfer Functions and Their Responses
The first term is a constant C0, sometimes written C0u0(t) because the Laplace transform is defined for t ≥ 
0, where u0(t) denotes the unit step at time zero. Each of the other terms is an exponential, which provided 
the real part of αi is negative will decay to zero as t becomes large. In this case the transfer function is 
said to be stable as a bounded input has produced a bounded output. Thus a transfer function is stable if 
all its poles lie in the left hand side (lhs) of the s plane zero-pole plot illustrated in Figure 2.1. The larger 
the negative value of αi the more rapidly the contribution from the ith term decays to zero. Since any 
poles which are complex occur in complex pairs, say of the form α1,α2 = σ ± jω, then the corresponding 
two residues C1 and C2 will be complex pairs and the two terms will combine to give a term of the form 
Ceσt sin(ωt + φ). This is a damped oscillatory exponential term where σ, which will be negative for a 
stable transfer function, determines the damping and ω the frequency [strictly angular frequency] of 
the oscillation. For a specific calculation most engineers, as mentioned earlier, will leave a complex pair 
of roots as a quadratic factor in the partial factorization process, as illustrated in the Laplace transform 
inversion example given in Appendix A. For any other input to a stable G(s), as with the step input, the 
poles of the Laplace transform of the input will occur in a term of the partial fraction expansion (3.2), 
[as for the C0/s term above], and will therefore produce a bounded output for a bounded input.

Transfer Functions and Their Responses
3.2	
Step Responses of Some Specific Transfer Functions
In control engineering the major deterministic input signals that one may wish to obtain responses to are 
a step, an impulse, a ramp and a constant frequency input. The purpose of this section is to discuss step 
responses of specific transfer functions, hopefully imparting an understanding of what can be expected 
from a knowledge of the zeros and poles of the transfer function without going into detailed mathematics.

A Single Pole Transfer Function

a

, where K= K1/a and T = 1/a The steady state gain G(0) = K, which is the final 
value of the response to a unit step input, and T is called the time constant as it determines the speed 
of the response. K will have units relating the input quantity to the output quantity, for example °C/V, 
if the input is a voltage and the output temperature. T will have the same units of time as s-1, normally 
seconds. The output, Y(s), for a unit step input is given by

 or in words, the output reaches 63.2% 
of the final value after a time T, the initial slope of the response is T and the response has essentially 
reached the final value after a time 5T. The step response in MATLAB can be obtained by the command 
step(num,den). The figure below shows the step response for the transfer function with K = 1 on a

Measurement of the angle φ and this relationship is often used to refer to the damping of complex poles 
even when not dealing with a second order system. The response on the normalised time scale ωot can be 
found from Matlab by taking ωo equal to one. The damping of the response then depends on ζ and the 
oscillatory behaviour on the normalised damped frequency, that is

The response can be shown to have the following properties:-
1)	 For ζ = 0 the response is undamped and continues to oscillate with frequency ωo (ωo =1 on 
the normalised plot)
2)	 The overshoots and undershoots occur at half periods of the damped frequency, ω , that is 
times of nπ/ω, for integers n greater and equal to 1.
3)	 The first overshoot is

4)	 The overshoot is often given as a percentage, i.e.100 Δ, and is shown in Figure 3.3 as a 
function of ζ.
5)	 For ζ > 1 the transfer function has two real poles and the response has no overshoot.
6)	 For ζ =1 both poles are at – ωo and the response is the fastest with no overshoot.

The Effect of a Zero
Consider the general transfer function G(s) = B(s)/A(s) again, and also G0(s) = 1/A(s), that is G(s) with 
B(s) = 1. As outlined above the effect of a non-unity B(s) will be to give different values of the C coefficients 
in the partial fraction expansion of equation (3.2). Thus one can find the new partial fraction expansion 
when B(s) is not a constant and invert to find the time response. There is another way, however, which 
also helps in understanding the response and that is to recognise that s can be regarded as a derivative 
operator. Thus, for example, suppose the response of G0(s) to a unit step input is y0(t) then the response 
of G(s) to a unit step input can be written as

It is easy to show mathematically that the response will have an overshoot for T > 1. The responses for 
T = 0.5, T = 1 and T = 2 are shown in Figure 3.4, obtained using the following MATLAB statements.

The unit impulse, δ(t), is the derivative of the unit step and has a Laplace transform of unity. Thus the 
response to a unit impulse is the derivative of the response to a unit step.
3.1.4	
A 3 Pole Transfer Function
In order to appreciate the response from multiple poles consider the step responses of two transfer 
functions each with three poles, a real pole and a complex pair. The example transfer functions are written 
in factored form, which of course corresponds to transfer functions in parallel, and are:-

Both transfer functions when written with a common denominator have two zeros and each term in 
G1 and G2 contributes a final value of 0.5, with the response from the complex poles the same. The step 
responses are shown in Figure 3.5. The time constant of the single pole in G1 is 5 seconds but only 0.2 
seconds in G2. Thus for the step response of G1 the time constant slows the response down and the 
overshoot is not as large as it would be for the complex poles alone, although the response still oscillates. 
The smaller time constant of G2 is evident in the rapid initial change in the step response.

For a stable transfer function, G(s), all the exponential terms in the summation will eventually go to 
zero and the inverse Laplace transform of the first term will be expressible as M sin(ωt + φ), a sinusoidal 
signal of magnitude (or amplitude) M and phase lag φ relative to the input sinusoid, where M and φ will 
be functions of ω. This is known as the steady state frequency response of G(s), often simply shortened 
to frequency response. To determine its value it is not necessary to go through the partial fraction and 
Laplace transform process indicated above as it can be shown that it can be obtained from the complex 
number G(jω), where M is the modulus and φ the argument of G(jω). This is a very basic property of 
a linear system that for a sine wave input the output, in the steady state, will also be a sine wave of the 
same frequency with the magnitude and phase shift dependent on the frequency.
The value of a transfer function G(s) for a specific value of s = s1 is G(s1) and from consideration of the 
zero-pole representation of equation (2.13) it can be seen that it is given by

one to appreciate how M and φ of a frequency response will vary as ω is increased.

Magnitude and phase of the output for a sinusoidal input have a very physical meaning but mathematically 
they are a polar representation of the output, which can therefore be written in the rectangular form for 
a complex number, that is
G(jω) = M(ω)ejϕ(ω) = X(ω) + jY(ω)
(3.16)
The relationships between the polar and rectangular representations are
M(ω) = [X2 (ω) + Y2(ω)] 1/2
(3.17)
φ = a tan 2(Y (ω), X(ω))
(3.18)
a tan 2 is the arctangent function used in MATLAB which correctly gives the phase φ between 0 and 
360°. Most books write φ = tan–1(Y(ω) / X(ω)) which is simply incorrect without further qualification 
as the mathematical function tan–1 only exists between -90° and 90°.

Frequency Responses and Their Plotting
4	 Frequency Responses and Their 
Plotting
4.1	
Introduction
The frequency response of a transfer function G(jω) was introduced in the last chapter. As G(jω) is a 
complex number with a magnitude and argument (phase) if one wishes to show its behaviour over a 
frequency range then one has 3 parameters to deal with the frequency, ω, the magnitude, M, and the 
phase φ. Engineers use three common ways to plot the information, which are known as Bode diagrams, 
Nyquist diagrams and Nichols diagrams in honour of the people who introduced them. All portray the 
same information and can be readily drawn in MATLAB for a system transfer function object G(s).
One diagram may prove more convenient for a particular application, although engineers often have a 
preference. In the early days when computing facilities were not available Bode diagrams, for example, had 
some popularity because of the ease with which they could, in many instances, be rapidly approximated. 
All the plots will be discussed below, quoting many results without going into mathematical detail, in 
the hope that the reader will obtain enough knowledge to know whether MATLAB plots obtained are 
of the general shape expected.
4.2	
Bode Diagram
A Bode diagram consists of two separate plots the magnitude, M, as a function of frequency and the 
phase φ as a function of frequency. For both plots the frequency is plotted on a logarithmic (log) scale 
along the x axis. A log scale has the property that the midpoint between two frequencies ω1 and ω2 is 
the frequency 
2
1ω
ω
ω =
. A decade of frequency is from a value to ten times that value and an octave 
from a value to twice that value. The magnitude is plotted either on a log scale or in decibels (dB), where 
dB = 20log10 M. The phase is plotted on a linear scale. Bode showed that for a transfer function with 
no right hand side (rhs) s-plane zeros the phase is related to the slope of the magnitude characteristic 
by the relationship

It can be further shown from this expression that a relatively good approximation is that the phase at 
any frequency is 15° times the slope of the magnitude curve in dB/octave. This was a useful concept to 
avoid drawing both diagrams when no computer facilities were available.

Thus since a log scale is used on the magnitude of a Bode diagram this means Bode magnitude plots 
for two transfer functions in series can be added, as also their phases on the phase diagram. Hence a 
transfer function in zero-pole form can be plotted on the magnitude and phase Bode diagrams simple 
by adding the individual contributions from each zero and pole. It is thus only necessary to know the 
Bode plots of single roots and quadratic factors to put together Bode plots for a complicated transfer 
function if it is known in zero-pole form.

gain, that is

It is easy to show that this transfer function can be approximated by two straight lines, one constant 
at 0 dB, as G(0) = 1, until the frequency, 1/T, known as the break point, and then from that point by a 
line with slope -6dB/octave. The actual curve and the approximation are shown in Figure 4.1 together 
with the phase curve. The differences between the exact magnitude curve and the approximation are 
symmetrical, that is a maximum at the breakpoint of 3dB, 1dB one octave each side of the breakpoint, 
0.3 dB two octaves away etc. The phase changes between 0° and -90° again with symmetry about the 
breakpoint phase of -45°. Note a steady slope of -6 dB/octave has a corresponding phase of -90°.

is simply a reflection in the 0 dB axis of the pole plot. That is the approximate magnitude curve is flat 
at 0 dB until the break point frequency, 1/T, and then increases at 6 dB/octave. Theoretically as the 
frequency tends to infinity so does its gain so that it is not physically realisable. The phase curve goes 
from 0° to +90°.
4.2.2	
An Integrator
The transfer function of an integrator, which is a pole at the origin in the zero-pole plot, is 1/s. It is 
sometimes taken with a gain K, i.e.K/s. Here K will be replaced by 1/T to give the transfer function

(4.6)
On a Bode diagram the magnitude is a constant slope of -6 dB/octave passing through 0 dB at the frequency 
1/T. Note that on a log scale for frequency, zero frequency where the integrator has infinite gain (the 
transfer function can only be produced electronically by an active device) is never reached. The phase 
is -90° at all frequencies. A differentiator has a transfer function of sT which gives a gain characteristic 
with a slope of 6 dB/octave passing through 0dB at a frequency of 1/T. Theoretically it produces infinite 
gain at infinite frequency so again it is not physically realisable. It has a phase of +90° at all frequencies.

Again G(0) = 1 so the response starts at 0 dB and can be approximated by a straight line at 0 dB until ωo 
and by a line from ωo at -12 dB/octave. However, this is a very coarse approximation as the behaviour 
around ωo is highly dependent on ζ. It can be shown that the magnitude reaches a maximum value

slopes of the magnitude curve, it has a phase shift of -90° at the frequency ωo independent of ζ and 
changes more rapidly near ωo for smaller ζ, as expected due to the more rapid change in the slope of the 
corresponding magnitude curve. Figure 4.2 shows Bode plots for various values of ζ against normalised

For plotting the Bode diagram it can be thought of as 4 transfer functions:-
1)	 a constant gain of 2
2)	 a single zero with a breakpoint of 1
3)	 a single pole with a breakpoint of 2
4)	 a quadratic pole with natural frequency 1 and damping ratio, ζ = 0.5.
The instruction in MATLAB to obtain the Bode plot of a transfer function object G is simply bode(G). 
The resultant Bode magnitude plot, marked (R), is shown in Figure 4.3 together with the individual plots 
of its four constituents, marked (1) to (4) as given above. The grid is added to the plot by typing grid.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations.

Nyquist Plot
Since
G(jω) = M(ω)ejφ(ω) = X(ω) + jY(ω)
(4.11)
every choice of ω gives a point in a complex plane either plotted in polar coordinates for the M, φ form 
or in rectangular coordinates in X, Y form. Joining the points together as ω is varied produces a locus 
with ω as a parameter which is known as a polar or Nyquist plot. To obtain analytical results one needs 
to be able to work in both polar and rectangular coordinates, since one may be more appropriate than 
the other for a particular evaluation. From consideration of the individual elements of a transfer function 
in the Bode approach of the previous section one should be able to estimate the shape of a Nyquist plot.
Important points in this respect are the high and low frequency limits, that is the value of G(jω) as ω→ 
∞ and 0. For large s the limit of the general transfer function G(s) of equation (2.9) will tend to 1/s(n-m), 
that is 1 over s to the relative degree. Thus for a strictly proper transfer function the gain will tend to zero 
and the phase to -90(n – m)° as ω→∞. For a proper transfer function with n = m the gain will tend to 
a finite value and the phase to zero. At low frequencies the transfer function, G(0) will tend either to a 
constant or s to the power of the number of differentiation terms minus integration terms in the transfer 
function. Typically only integration terms exist in transfer functions for control systems so the behaviour 
at low frequencies depends on the number of integrators and G(s) tends to 1/si where i is the number 
of integrators. Thus at low frequencies for i > 0 the magnitude tends to infinity and the phase to -90i°. 
This phase result does not mean that the locus starts on an axis as sketches in many books incorrectly 
show. As a simple example of this point consider the transfer function

Clearly as ω → 0, X(ω) → –2, not the imaginary axis, although the phase does tend to -90°. This will 
always be the case that the locus for a transfer function with one or more integrators will tend to an 
asymptote which in principle can be calculated. The Nyquist plot of this transfer function is obtained 
with the instruction nyquist(G). It is shown in Figure 4.4, which is obtained by the following single 
instruction defining the transfer function of G in the Nyquist statement:-

Frequency Responses and Their Plotting
Information about where a Nyquist plot cuts the axes can be obtained from the facts that the real axis is 
cut when Y(ω) = 0 or arg G(jω) = 0° or 180°, and the imaginary axis when X(ω) = 0 or arg G(jω) = -90° 
or +90°. Which are the easiest calculations can depend on the transfer function. For the above example 
it is easily seen from Y(ω) that the real axis is cut when ω = 1 and the imaginary axis is only reached as 
ω tends to infinity. However for G(s) = 1/(1 + s)6 then where it cuts the axes is best obtained using arg 
G(jω), which is simply equal to – 6 tan-1ω.
Figure 4.4 Nyquist plot of 1/s(s + 1)2.
Three further comments must be made here about the plot of Figure 4.4:-
1)	 For reasons to be explained later the graph is drawn for both positive and negative 
frequencies. The labelling of these has been added to the plot afterwards.
2)	 It can be shown for all transfer functions that X(ω) is an even function and Y(ω) an odd 
function of ω. Thus the negative frequency part of the plot is a reflection of the positive 
frequency plot in the real axis.
3)	 MATLAB does not label the frequencies automatically on the plot but they can be selected 
by use of the cursor as has been done to obtain one frequency point on this plot.
4)	 The frequency response plot instructions bode(G) and nyquist(G) in MATLAB 
automatically select the frequency range. This can be done by the user by selecting a vector 
ω, typically on a log scale using the instruction ω = logspace(a,b,n), which generates n 
points on a log scale between 10a and 10b. If n is omitted the default is 50 points. The plot 
instructions are then bode(G, ω) and nyquist(G, ω).

Frequency Responses and Their Plotting
The last instruction in (4) has been used with the ω vector generated by logspace for a = -0.5 and b = 1 
to show a more detailed plot near the origin in Figure 4.5. From the two plots it can be clearly seen that 
at low frequencies, where the gain tends to infinity because of the single integration, the locus starts 
from the asymptote at X(ω) = -2 with a phase of -90°, crosses the real axis, that is has a phase of -180°, 
at X = -0.5 and tends to the origin (zero gain) at high frequencies with a phase of -270° (relative degree 
of 3 times -90°). The real axis crossing occurs at a frequency of unity.

A final comment on Nyquist plots is that sometimes Inverse Nyquist plots are drawn, these are simply 
the Nyquist plot of the inverse of the transfer function, i.e a Nyquist plot of G(jω)-1.

Nichols Plot
The Nichols plot is similar to the Nyquist plot in that it is a locus as a function of ω, the difference 
being the chosen axes. On a Nichols plot these are the magnitude in dB on the ordinate and the phase 
in degrees on the abscissa. The origin is chosen, for reasons which will be explained, later as 0 dB and 
-180°. The Nichols plot for the same transfer function as the Nyquist plot of Figure 4.4 is obtained by 
the instruction nichols(G) and is shown in Figure 4.6. The grid is obtained by typing ngrid. As expected 
the plot shows the magnitude decreasing monotonically with increase in frequency, the arrow for which 
was added to the plot, and the phase changing from -90° to -270°.

The Basic Feedback Loop
5	 The Basic Feedback Loop
5.1	
Introduction
The basic concept, of feedback control, as mentioned in the first chapter is to measure the quantity to be 
controlled, usually called the controlled variable and denoted by C, and to compare it with the desired or 
reference value, usually denoted by R, and to use any error to adjust C to the desired value. Thus a basic 
feedback loop has the structure shown in the diagram of Figure 5.1 where the various physical elements 
are represented by their mathematical models in transfer function form. The process being controlled, 
denoted G(s), is usually referred to as the process or plant transfer function.
Measurement of its output, C, is obtained by a sensor of transfer function H, which is also known as 
the feedback transfer function. In many cases the dynamics of H may be neglected, so that H is just a 
constant with units converting the output to appropriate units for use in the control system. For example, 
if the output controlled variable is a temperature and the control system error channel uses voltage then 
H will have units of V/°C. The importance of H cannot be underestimated since if the sensor is supposed 
to give 5V at 50°C but actually gives 5V at 48°C the perfect control system with its reference set to 5V 
for 50°C will control the temperature at 48°C. In other cases H will contain dynamics of the sensor and/
or loop compensation dynamics. Some sensors introduce a significant noise level into the loop and this 
can be represented by the signal, N, shown. The error signal is normally processed through a controller 
of transfer function Gc(s), as shown, before providing the plant input signal U. The transfer function of 
the forward path of the loop is Gc(s)G(s).
The loop is often subject to disturbance inputs, for instance in a position control system for a large antenna 
dish, varying wind speeds impacting the dish will produce a torque disturbance. A disturbance signal 
D is therefore shown in Figure 5.1. Since the loop is linear the effect of all of the three input signals, R, 
D and N at a particular point can be found independently and then summed.

System Specifications
The designer of a closed loop control system will be given specifications which the resulting system has 
to meet. Design is invariably an iterative process and begins with the selection and modelling of the 
various system components before the performance of the closed loop system can be evaluated. It may be 
after some analysis, say for a position control system, it is found that the required speed of response can 
only be achieved with a larger motor, so the designer returns to the component selection and modelling 
process. Here it is assumed that the plant transfer function is fixed and Gc and possibly H have to be 
chosen to try and meet the specifications. The actual design specifications, which, for example, may 
involve a limit on the use of energy, may have to be ‘translated’ into appropriate quantifiable properties of 
the closed loop, which is all that can be satisfied with analytical control techniques. To make the design 
easier it is often assumed that there are a limited number of transfer functions that might be used in Gc 
and H and the design objective then becomes one of selecting suitable parameters for these fixed form 
controllers. The feedback loop of Figure 5.1 can be redrawn, as in Figure 5.2, with H in the forward path 
of the loop and the reference, R, going through 1/H.

The Basic Feedback Loop
The input to H in the forward path of the loop is then the error in output units, say °C for a temperature 
control, and its output the error in the sensor output units, say voltage V. For loop analysis the gain of 
H can then be included in Gc, so for this reason many results are derived with H=1.
Some typical closed loop specifications are therefore discussed below:-
1)	 Stability. Obviously the prime requirement for a feedback loop is that it be stable. Methods 
for investigating stability are discussed in the next section.
2)	 Steady state error. In many instances the inputs, particularly R and D, may be assumed 
constant and it is often required that in the steady state they do not produce an error. 
Mathematically the steady state error can be found by applying the final value theorem to 
the s domain expression E(s) for the error, which for the feedback loop of Figure 5.1 with  
H = 1, for the input R(s) a step of amplitude R is

, and this will only be true if Gc(s)G(s) contains 
an integrator. Obviously if this is not the case then equation (5.7) allows the error magnitude to 
be calculated. However, if one just needs to determine if the steady state error is zero then this 
can be done simply from a consideration of the d.c. gain of the loop elements. This is infinite 
for an integrator, as in the steady state it can have a finite output with zero input. For example, 
for the above case a finite output C has to be obtained in the steady state for zero E, which is 
only possible with an integrator in the forward loop. If E were required to be zero for a ramp 
input the forward loop would require two integrators, the first producing a constant output 
for no input in the steady state and the second integrating the constant to produce a ramp. In 
the case of a disturbance D the error it produces is the value it has at C, (i.e C should not be 
affected by it). For D not to affect C then the forward path signal at the point where D enters 
the loop, U, should be equal and opposite to it. Thus if D is a constant Gc(s) must contain an 
integrator for the output not to be affected in the steady state.
3)	 Step response. Characteristics of the closed loop response to a step input are often specified. 
These are based on the typical response with zero steady state error to a unit step shown in 
Figure 5.3 and are:-
a)	 Rise time,tr. This is the time taken to reach the steady state value of unity for the first 
time. If the response has no overshoot the time is often given for the response to go from 
0.1 to 0.9, that is from 10 to 90%
b)	 Peak time,tp This is the time taken to reach the first overshoot of the response.

52 
The Basic Feedback Loop
c)	 Overshoot,%O. This is the magnitude of the first overshoot in the response, normally 
expressed as a percentage. If the peak value is 1.2 then the overshoot is 20%.
d)	 Settling time,ts. This is a measure of the time for the response to have approximately 
reached the steady state of unity. It is normally defined as the time to reach within a 2% 
band of the steady state (between 0.98 and 1.02) and remain there. Sometimes a 5% band 
is used as in the figure illustration.

For the response illustrated in the figure tr is approximately 2 seconds, tp approximately 4 seconds with 
a %O of 52% and ts of 13.5 seconds for a 5% band.
4)	 Frequency response. Sometimes specifications are given with respect to the closed loop 
frequency response requirements of the system. The ideal requirement is for C to follow R 
exactly but this cannot be achieved as the input frequency is increased but is normally the 
case at low frequencies. Thus the closed loop frequency response T(jω) typically starts at 
unit gain (0dB) and zero phase shift. The magnitude response may have one or more peaks, 
the usual case as shown in Figure 5.4, and then decrease.
a)	 Bandwidth, Bw. This is defined from zero frequency to the first time (often the only 
time) the magnitude goes through -3dB (value of 0.707)
b)	 Frequency peak, Mp. This is the maximum of the frequency response, provided it 
exceeds 0dB (unit gain).
For the response shown in the figure Mp is approximately 16dB at 0.9 rads/s and Bw is around 1.3 
rads/s. The frequency response specifications are related to the step response ones dependent on the 
specific transfer function. For a simple transfer function like the second order one of equation (3.6) these 
relationships can easily be found as in section 3.2.2 it was shown how the overshoot was related to ς 
and in section 4.2.3 how Mp was related to ς. Thus if one is given time domain and frequency domain 
specifications one must look at their consistency. A rise time of 0.01 seconds, for example, would require 
a bandwidth significantly greater than 10 rads/s.

Stability
The requirement for stability of the closed loop is that all the poles of the closed loop transfer function 
T(s) of equation (5.3) lie in the lhs s-plane. The poles are the zeros of the characteristic equation (5.4), 
which will be a polynomial in s. If this polynomial is denoted by

Routh Hurwitz Criterion.
Finding the roots of a polynomial of large order was very difficult before the advent of modern 
computational techniques and in 1876 a major contribution was made by Routh who obtained conditions 
which had to be satisfied for all roots of a polynomial to lie in the lhs s-plane. A polynomial which 
satisfies this condition is known as a stable polynomial. The criterion was later modified by Hurwitz to 
give the Routh-Hurwitz results presented in Appendix B.
Two simple results which prove useful are
a)	 A necessary but not sufficient condition, apart from the second order polynomial where it is 
both necessary and sufficient, is that all the coefficients of s must be positive that is fj > 0 for 
all j

The Mikhailov criterion is a simple graphical approach only normally mentioned in Russian textbooks. If 
the polynomial F(jω) is plotted for ω increasing from zero on a complex plane, then all its roots will lie 
in the lhs s-plane if from starting on the positive real axis at f0 it moves in a counter clockwise direction 
passing successively through the positive imaginary axis, negative real axis etc in turn until it cuts no 
further axes but ‘heads’ for infinity as illustrated in Figure 5.5. The number of axes cut will be n-1

5.4.3	
Nyquist Criterion
In the early days when control engineering was developing as a discipline it was very desirable to try 
and develop concepts to predict aspects of the closed loop system behaviour based on properties of the 
open loop transfer function. There were three major reasons for this:-
a)	 When a compensator (controller) is within the loop it is much easier to see how changes in 
its parameters will affect the open loop properties, for example the frequency response, than 
the closed loop properties.
b)	 Plant models were often obtained by frequency response testing so that G(jω) was then 
available as a plot from experimental data.
c)	 Even when all the loop transfer functions were known calculating a closed loop step 
response was a laborious procedure.
For these reasons the Nyquist stability criterion, which is based on the open loop frequency response, was 
thus not only useful but also very practical. The derivation of the criterion, which uses the mathematics 
of functions of a complex variable, is relatively easy to explain in principle. It is based on Cauchy’s 
mapping theorem which states that if a complex function, F(s), is mapped around a closed contour in 
a clockwise direction in the s-plane (that is its value calculated at points on the contour and plotted in 
its own complex plane) the origin will be encircled No times in the clockwise direction where No is the 
difference between the number of zeros and poles of F(s) enclosed by the chosen s-plane contour. When 
the contour is taken as the imaginary axis, this means taking ω from –∞ to ∞, and then the infinite 
semicircle in the right hand side (rhs) s-plane (around this ω remains infinite), known as the Nyquist D 
contour, shown in Figure 5.6, then the origin will be encircled by F(jω) No times in a clockwise direction, 
where No is given by:-
No = [zeros of F(s) – poles of F(s)] in rhs s-plane
(5.9)
The zeros of F(s) are required to assess stability so the equation may be written
zeros of F(s) in rhs = No + poles of F(s) in rhs.
(5.10)
From equation (5.4) it can be seen that the poles of F(s) are the same as the poles of Gol(s) and that the 
only difference between a mapping of F(jω) and Gol(jω) is that the latter is shifted from the former by 
-1 along the real axis. Thus equation (5.10) can be written
zeros of F(s) in rhs = N + poles of Gol(s) in rhs.
(5.11)

The Basic Feedback Loop
where N now denotes the clockwise encirclements of the (-1,0) point by the plot of Gol(jω). Thus if the 
number of poles of Gol in the rhs s-plane is known, which will of course be zero for a stable Gol, the 
number of zeros of F(s) in the rhs s-plane can be found from equation (5.11) to determine the stability 
of the feedback loop.
This equation gives the Nyquist stability criterion which may be formally stated as the closed loop system 
will be stable if the number of clockwise encirclements by the frequency response locus Gol(jω) of the 
(-1,0) point plus the number of rhs s-plane poles of Gol(s) is zero. Showing the Nyquist plot for both 
negative and positive frequencies allows the encirclements to be found.
So that the D contour does not pass through them when singularities (poles or zeros) exist on the 
imaginary axis, it has to be modified so that they lie outside by indentations of infinitesimal radius, ε, as 
shown dotted in figure 5.6. In many instances the plant to be controlled will be stable so that Gol(s) will 
have no rhs s-plane poles so for stability the Nyquist plot of Gol(jω) must have N = 0. Control engineers 
are, however, required to control plants which are unstable, a modern fighter aircraft being a good example.

Introduction
In the previous chapter the basic feedback loop was discussed and typical specifications that might be 
required for its performance introduced. Before going on to discuss analytical methods that can be used 
for designing the controller to try and meet given specifications it is necessary to present some further 
analytical concepts used for feedback loop analysis. Also up to this point it has been assumed that the 
transfer function representation for block descriptions is a ratio of polynomials in s. There is, however, 
one linear element which often exists in a control system for which this is not the case, namely a time 
delay. This is therefore covered first in the next section.
6.2	
Time Delay
A time delay as its name suggests is an element which produces an output which is a time delayed 
version of its input. It is also known as dead time or transport delay. The latter name reflects the fact 
that a common occurrence is due to say, a temperature measurement being made on a moving fluid 
down stream from where it has been heated. It is normally assumed that its initial output is zero. Thus 
for example, if the time delay is τ seconds the input, v(t), and output will be as shown in Figure 6.1 for 
the linear input v(t) = t.
Mathematically the input, v(t) can be defined as either v(t) = 0 for t < 0 and t for t > 0, or tu0(t) where 
u0(t) is the unit step at t = 0. Using the unit step notation the output can be written as (t – τ)u0(t – τ), 
that is a unit ramp beginning at time τ. The Laplace transform of the input is 1/s2 and of the output  
e-sτ/s2 (see theorem (vi) Appendix A). Thus the transfer function for the time delay block, the ratio of 
the output to the input in the s-domain, is e-sτ.

The time delay transfer function is easily handled when using frequency domain methods as with s = 
jω, it is e-jωτ, which has a unit magnitude at all frequencies and a phase lag of ωτ. Thus, for example, its 
Nyquist plot is a unit circle which has frequency points of value π/2τ, π/τ, 3π/2τ, 2π/τ, 5π/2τ etc, at -90°, 
-180°, -270°, -360°, -450°, etc. Figure 6.2 shows Nyquist plots of the transfer functions G(s) = 1/(s2 + s + 1) 
and G(s)e–2, that is the former with an additional time delay of 1 second.

Although a time delay can be approximated by the standard series for an exponential a better 
approximation is to use a ratio of polynomials, a result due to Pade. This allows choice of the order of 
the numerator and denominator polynomials. The Pade Table of approximations is given in Appendix C.

The Root Locus
Design of a simple control loop may sometimes just involve the choice of a suitable gain, K, in which 
case the characteristic equation will be
1+ KGol(s) = 0
(6.1)
and the poles of the closed loop transfer function, the roots of equation (6.1), will vary with K. Evans in 
1948 found a diagrammatic method for showing how these roots would vary as K changed, known as a 
root locus, by recognising that, since s is complex, equation (6.1) could be written as the two equations
Arg(Gol(s)) = -180°~
(6.2)
and
K|Gol(s)|= 1
(6.3)
Based on equation (6.2) he was able to prove several results indicating where the roots would be and 
then used equation (6.3) to mark the corresponding value of gain on the locus. MATLAB plots a root 
locus with the command rlocus(G).
Some simple rules which enable a quick check of a root locus, assuming Gol is in the form of G(s) given 
in equations (2.9) to (2.11), and K is positive are:-
1.	 The number of root locus paths will be n, assuming n ≥ m.
2.	 The loci start at the poles of the open loop transfer function, Gol, with K = 0
3.	 The loci finish at the zeros of the open loop transfer function, Gol, as K→∞
4.	 A number of loci equal to the relative degree, (n-m), or the so-called number of zeros at 
infinity, of the open loop transfer function will tend to infinity as K tends to infinity
5.	 Loci exist on the real axis to the left of an odd number of singularities (poles plus zeros).
As a simple example the command
>> rlocus(tf([1],[1 3 2 0]))

produces the root locus shown in Figure 6.3. This transfer function for, Gol, has no zeros and 3 poles at 0,-1 
and -2, and it can easily be seen that the plot satisfies the above five rules for the loci. The characteristic 
equation has three roots all of which, initially for low gain, are real. As gain increases the root moving 
from the origin moves towards that from the one at -1, they meet at the so called breakaway point 
where they are equal and then form a complex pair for further increase in gain. The third root moves 
all the time to the left on the negative real axis from -2. Information for a specific point on the locus 
can be obtained by pointing at it and using a left side cursor click, with the result shown by the label 
on the Figure. The value of the Gain, K, and the coordinates of the point as Pole, are given. The other 
information given on the damping is based on the assumption, as explained in section 3.2.2, that this 
complex pole was one of the two complex poles of a second order system with the transfer function of 
equation (3.6). This is obviously only indicative since, for example, the closed loop response to a step 
input will, as indicated earlier depend upon any zeros; and in this case when there are no zeros on the 
relative weighting of the responses from the real pole beyond -2, actually at -2.50 for K = 1.89, and the 
complex pair, as illustrated in section 3.2.4. The overshoot of the closed loop step response for this third 
order transfer function with the gain value of 1.89 is 37.0 not 39.4%
Figure 6.3 Illustrative root locus plot.
The gain range for the root locus plot is selected automatically but as for ω in a frequency response may 
be selected if preferred by the command K=linspace(a,b,n), which generates n points linearly spaced 
from a to b, inclusive, and then use of the plotting command rlocus(G,K). When a root passes into the 
rhs s-plane the closed loop becomes unstable. For the above case intersection with the imaginary axis 
occurs for K = 6 at a frequency of 21/2 = 1.414, the value of the imaginary axis coordinate. This condition 
is often referred to as being neutrally stable, since mathematically a constant amplitude oscillation exists.

Relative Stability
Relative stability, which may also be called robustness, is a measure of how near a system is to being 
unstable. Robustness, however, is used with respect to many properties and its use is best qualified by 
using it in the form robustness of property X with respect to property Y if the context is not clear. There 
are several measures which are used to indicate relative stability and some are discussed below.
6.4.1	
Pole positions.
Obviously since instability results from a pole entering the rhs s-plane, the nearer a pole in the lhs 
s-plane is to the imaginary axis the nearer the system being studied will be to instability. Thus in the 
previous root locus example the nearer the gain to the value of 6 the nearer the two complex poles are 
to the imaginary axis. The information in the panel of the root locus plot therefore gives an indication 
of the relative stability of the system.
6.4.2	
Gain and Phase Margin.
If the open loop system transfer function is stable then from the Nyquist criterion given in section 5.4.3 
the closed loop system will be stable if its Nyquist plot does not encircle the Nyquist point (-1, 0). Passing 
of the locus through this point corresponds to neutral stability like the crossing of the imaginary axis 
in a root locus plot. For the G(s) considered in the root locus plot this would occur at a frequency of 
1.414 rad/s. with an additional gain of K = 6. In gain-phase terms the Nyquist point has a gain of unity 
and a phase of -180°, hence the choice of this point as the origin for a Nichols plot. Obviously therefore 
measures of how near the open loop frequency response locus is to this critical point, on the Nyquist or 
Nichols plots, are indicators of relative stability. Figure 6.4 shows a typical open loop frequency response 
Nyquist plot, it is in fact

the plant transfer function as used in the root locus plot with an additional gain of 3. The (-1, 0) point 
is labelled N, the origin O, and the point where the locus cuts the negative real axis as P.
1)	 Gain Margin. The gain margin is the amount by which the gain needs to be increased for 
the closed loop to become unstable. It is usually given in dB’s and is 20log10(ON/OP). For 
the example plot the negative real axis is cut at -0.5, so for the locus to pass through N 
the gain has to be increased by a factor of 2, which is 6dB. As the phase shift is -180° the 
frequency at this point is usually known as the phase crossover frequency, which will be 
denoted by ωpc and is 1.414 rad/s. in the example.

2)	 Phase Margin The phase margin is the amount by which the loop phase needs to be changed 
for the loop to become unstable. The point G on the frequency response has a gain of unity, 
that is OG = 1, so for this point to pass through N the phase needs to be changed by the 
amount of the angle GON marked in the figure. Mathematically the phase margin is 180° + 
arg (G(jωgc), where ωgc is the frequency at G and is known as the gain crossover frequency 
since |(G(jωgc)|=1. In the example ωgc = 0.969 rads/s. and the phase margin is 20.0°

Figure 6.5 gives the Bode plots of the same open loop transfer function of equation (6.7) and shows 
how the closed loop gain and phase margins are found from it. Figure 6.4 also illustrates another point 
that for a stable open loop transfer function the closed loop will be stable if the open loop frequency 
response traced with increasing frequency passes the critical point to its left. Sometimes Nyquist loci are 
much more complicated than the simple smooth one shown, for example with multiple crossings of the 
negative real axis, and in such cases further clarification may be necessary when using gain and phase 
margin terms. Note also that with a non smooth locus it would be possible to have a large gain margin 
and a small phase margin or visa versa.

The complimentary sensitivity function is defined as

which is the closed loop transfer function. Since the vector 1 + Gol(jω) is a measure of the distance of 
Gol at any frequency from the Nyquist point {i.e. in figure 6.4 the length NG is 1+Gol(jωgc)}, when this is 
small S(jω) and T(jω) will have large peak magnitudes, so their maximum magnitudes may be used as 
relative stability indicators. That of T(jω) is discussed further in the next section
6.5	
M and N Circles
The idea of M and N circles again relates to the days when computer software was not available and 
designers were interested in finding out about the closed loop frequency response behaviour from the 
open loop frequency response. The computations from open loop to closed loop properties are now 
easily done but the concepts are still of some value, particularly that of M circles. If the feedback transfer 
function H = 1 then, Gol(jω) = Gc(jω)G(jω), and the closed loop frequency response function is

If the magnitude of this function is required to remain constant, at a value M, as ω varies then it can 
be shown that Gol(jω) should move on a circular path on a Nyquist plot. Thus by superimposing this 
grid, known as M circles, on a Nyquist plot of the open loop frequency response one can see how the 
magnitude of the closed loop frequency response will vary with frequency. The magnitude values of M 
are normally labelled in dBs. It can further be shown that if the closed loop phase is to remain constant 
then this also produces a grid of circles, known as N circles. The M circles can be overlaid on a Nyquist 
plot in MATLAB by using the right hand mouse button and selecting grid from the resulting options. 
This is shown in Figure 6.6 for the same transfer function as used in Figures 6.4.and 6.5.

Figure 6.6 Nyquist plot with M circles.
The largest M value circle which the plot reaches is seen to be approximately 10dB at the point P. Thus the 
closed loop frequency response should have a maximum magnitude Mp of 10dB at the frequency of the point 
P, which is approximately 1 rad/s., as is seen to be the case in the MATLAB plot of Figure 6.7. The observant 
reader may also have noticed that the 0dB (unit gain) M circle is in fact a straight line (circle with centre at 
infinity and infinite radius) through the point (-0.5,0). This means for a typical open loop Nyquist plot it must 
always stay to the right of this line if the closed loop frequency response must not have a gain greater than 
unity. Obviously specifying the Mp of a frequency response is another measure of relative stability.

Classical Controller Design
7	 Classical Controller Design
7.1	
Introduction
Classical controller design involves the choice of a suitable transfer function in the controller Gc, or 
possibly H, of Figure 5.1 so that the closed loop performance meets the required specifications. This 
can often be achieved with quite simple transfer functions with three common ones being the phase 
lead controller, the phase lag controller and the PID (Proportional, Integral and Derivative) controller. 
Since the system specification often includes that there should be no steady state error to a step input, 
the phase lead and lag controllers, which do not include an integral term, are normally used with plant 
transfer functions with an integral term. Many plant transfer functions in process control, for example 
temperature control, do not include an integral term so that PID controllers, or sometimes just PI 
controllers, are often used to control them. PID controllers are also used on plants with an integration 
term to eliminate steady state errors caused by a constant disturbance, D, in Figure 5.1; a topic which 
will be discussed in chapter 9.

Classical Controller Design
Most textbooks discuss the design of phase lead and lag controllers using both frequency domain and root 
locus methods but here only frequency domain methods will be covered. The main reason for this is that 
frequency domain methods involve ‘loop shaping’ which is used in recent approaches to multivariable 
control. Both methods invariably involve iteration as in the frequency domain approach one is shaping 
the open loop frequency response and in the root locus approach one is selecting the closed loop poles. 
As explained earlier the relationship between these properties and the resulting closed loop step response, 
which is often a system specification, is based on qualitative concepts. For example, it can be seen from 
equation (5.6) that if the compensator is moved from the forward path to the feedback path, the closed 
loop transfer function, T(s) changes, but both the open loop frequency response and location of the 
closed loop poles are unchanged.
7.2	
Phase Lead Design
A phase lead controller as stated above is normally used when the plant transfer function G(s) has 
an integration. Assuming this to be the case then, with Gc = K and H = 1, it will be found that

, where Kv is a constant and the error to a ramp input will be smaller the larger 
the value of Kv . This consideration often affects the choice of the controller gain so that the phase lead 
content of the controller is normally determined assuming Gc(0) = 1 so as not to affect Kv. The transfer 
function of the phase lead controller is therefore taken as

(7.1)
which produces a lead when α < 1.
A common frequency domain approach for selecting the parameters α and T for a phase lead controller 
is to do the design so that the compensated open loop frequency response locus achieves a preselected 
phase margin, φ°. This is based on the assumption that for a smooth open loop frequency response 
increasing the phase margin will reduce the overshoot in the step response. There are several ways 
of trying to achieve this and dependent on the choice of j° for a given G(s) they may or may not be 
successful. Possible methods are:-
1)	 The ‘classical’ method, which will be described below, and is covered in most textbooks.
2)	 Choosing the controller zero to cancel the dominant pole of the plant, assuming of course 
one exists.
3)	 Designing for a chosen phase or gain crossover frequency, i.e. where the open loop gain is 
unity or the phase -180°.
4)	 Fix a, usually based on bandwidth or noise considerations, and find a suitable value of T.

The procedure for (i), if the desired phase margin is φ, is then as follows:-
1.	 Evaluate the uncompensated system phase margin ϕ.
2.	 Allowing for a small amount of safety, e, estimate the required phase lead, ϕm = φ – ϕ + ε  
(ε typically 5°-18°).
3.	 Evaluate α for this value of ϕm from the above equation (or use Table 7.1).

4.	 Evaluate 10log10 α (or take from Table 7.1 where Gm dB = -10log10 a dB) and determine the 
frequency where the uncompensated Bode frequency magnitude curve is equal to 10log10α 
dB. This frequency is the estimated new 0 dB crossover frequency and ωm simultaneously (if 
the guess for e is correct), because the compensation network provides a gain of -10log10 α at 
ωm.
5.	 Draw the compensated frequency response, check the resulting phase margin, and repeat 
the steps from 2 if necessary (i.e. change ε).
6.	 If the design does not meet the specifications repeat for a different choice of phase margin, 
i.e. increase if the overshoot is too high.
The problem with the approach is in estimating e although it is much easier interacting with Bode plots in 
MATLAB than it was with sketched Bode plots and pencil and paper. Critical to the success of the method 
is the rate of change of phase of the plant transfer function beyond the frequency of the uncompensated 
system phase margin. If this is too high the method will fail. This also affects the estimate that should 
be taken for e. A guide, is 5°-10° for a plant of relative degree 2, and 12°-18° for one of relative degree 3.
As an example consider a plant with transfer function

If after doing the Bode plots the command margin(G) is given in Matlab then the values of the gain and phase 
margins for the transfer function will be given on the Bode diagram as shown in Figure 7.2. The phase margin 
is seen to be 15.6°. For a second order system a phase margin of 40° corresponds to an overshoot of slightly 
over 25%, so let us assume the phase lead compensator is required to produce a phase margin of around 40°.

15.6° which is reasonable for a transfer function with relative degree 3. From Table 7.1 this suggests an 
α of either 1/4 or 1/5. Taking the latter value means ε = 17.4° and from Table 7.1 the dB for α = 1/5 is 
6.99. From Figure 7.2 the gain plot is approximately 7dB down at a frequency of 4.73, which is slightly 
higher than the phase crossover frequency. Thus 4.73 = 1/T√0.2, giving T = 0.472. The compensator is 
therefore taken as Gc(s) =

. Figure 7.3 shows the compensated open loop frequency response 
together with that of the plant alone. It can be seen that the guess for e was very good with the resulting 
gain crossover frequency being 4.72 and the phase margin 39.6°. Use of a phase lead compensator is seen 
to increase the gain and phase crossover frequencies and the open loop bandwidth. It therefore can be 
expected that the closed loop step response of the compensated system will be faster than that for the 
plant with a unit gain compensator. These step responses are shown in Figure 7.4 where the overshoot 
of the phase lead compensated system is significantly less as expected because of its increased phase 
margin. The overshoot of the compensated system is, however, slightly more than 25%. It is of interest 
to compare this closed loop response with that obtained with the phase advance compensator placed 
in the feedback path and this is shown in Figure 7.5. The compensator in the feedback path is seen to 
result in a response which has a longer rise time, a comparable settling time, and no overshoot. Another 
interesting aspect of placing the compensator in the feedback path is seen by looking at the controller 
output signals, normally called the control signals, for step inputs. These are shown in Figure 7.6.

Figure 7.3 Open loop frequency responses of the compensated and uncompensated systems.
Figure 7.4 Closed loop step responses of the compensated and uncompensated systems.
As the relative degree of the phase advance compensator transfer function is zero, its initial output in 
response to a step input is 1/α, in this case 5. Thus the closed loop response for the compensator in the 
forward loop produces a ‘derivative kick’ of 5. This accounts for the faster rise time but also means that 
the control signal may cause saturation for large step inputs. In contrast, with the compensator in the 
feedback path the control signal starts from zero and reaches, in this case, a maximum of around unity.

Before concluding phase lead controller design a few comments on the other suggested approaches (ii) 
to (iv) are appropriate. First with respect to method (ii), the dominant plant pole in the example G(s) 
of equation (7.2), i.e the largest time constant, is 0.5, so using this method the phase advance controller 
transfer function would be Gc(s) =

, where T ’ would be evaluated to give the required phase 
margin. The result for this particular example, choosing a phase margin of 40°, gives T ’ = 0.09, which 
makes the compensator almost the same as in (i) due to the nearness of 0.5 to 0.472. With method (iii), 
which is usually done for the gain crossover frequency, the problem is selecting how much higher this 
frequency should be than for the plant

alone. If it is selected too high a design will not be possible. Method (iv) is straight forward, a value of 
α, usually in the range 1/8 to 1/16, is selected and then T found to give the desired phase margin. If in 
the above example α is selected as 1/8, then T can be found by iteration in MATLAB to be about 0.19, 
with a corresponding gain crossover frequency of 3.41 rads/s. Interestingly this open loop frequency 
response has a higher gain margin but a smaller phase margin than the design using method (i) as 
shown in Figure 7.7. Lead compensation may not be possible in some cases as it depends very much 
how rapidly the phase of the plant transfer function changes beyond the existing uncompensated gain 
crossover frequency.

Phase Lag Design
A phase lag compensator is achieved with the transfer function of equation (7.1) with α >1. In doing 
a phase lag design one uses the fact that the compensator gain changes from 0dB at low frequencies 
to 20log10(1/α)dB = -20log10(α)dB at high frequencies. The Bode diagram for the phase lag transfer 
function G(s) =

 is shown in Figure 7.8 for α = 10 and T=1. The phase lag, δ, a decade above the 
second break point is δ = tan–1 10 – tan–1 10α, which depends upon α, with values of 2.85°, 4.27°, 4.99° 
and 5.13° for α = 2, 4, 8 and 10 respectively. The corresponding gain differs by less than 0.05dB from 
the asymptotic value of -20log10α. The idea is to have this point as the gain crossover frequency of the 
compensated locus. Thus if the required phase margin of the compensated system is φ, then one needs 
to find the frequency ω, where arg G(jω) = -(180- φ) – δ and |G(j ω)| = 20log10α.

As an example the same plant as previously, given by equation (7.2), is taken for a phase lag compensator 
design with again the requirement for the compensated system to have a phase margin of 40°. Assuming 
δ = 4° the frequency where G(jω) has a phase of -136° is required. From the Bode diagram this is 
approximately at 1.51rads/s. where the corresponding gain is 9.89dB, a gain of 3.12. Thus, 10/T = 1.51, 
α = 3.12 and the required compensator transfer function is Gc(s) =

The Bode diagrams for the plant alone and the lag compensated system are shown in Figure 7.9. The 
bandwidth of the compensated system with the lag network is lower and the closed loop step response 
is slower. This response and that for the phase lead compensated system with the compensators in the 
forward path are shown in Figure 7.10. Note the % overshoot for both plots is roughly the same. The 
lag compensator does produce a small initial jump in the control signal to 1/3.12 which is roughly its 
peak value. Unlike lead compensation the use of lag compensation in the feedback path produces very 
poor results due to the delay it causes to the feedback signal.
Figure 7.9 Bode diagrams for the plant alone and the lag compensated system
For this example a very much slower response, with an overshoot of over 250%, results. Unlike lead 
compensation lag compensation is usually possible, however since it slows down the response and reduces 
the bandwidth it may not be desirable.

PID Control
Most plants in the process industries do not contain an integration term in their transfer function. It 
has been seen that it is necessary to have an integration term in the forward path to achieve zero error 
in the steady state response to a reference step input, so an integration term is normally required in the 
controller for these plants. The ideal phase lead controller with α = 0, is a PD, that is proportional plus 
derivative, controller. Thus the use of a PID controller containing proportional, integral and derivative 
terms is a logical form of fixed term controller for plants without an integration term in their transfer 
function. PID controllers have thus been used extensively in the process control industries for many 
years. PID control was first implemented with pneumatic controllers and subsequently went through 
the use of vacuum tubes, transistors, integrated circuits to today’s situation where it is typically software 
in a microprocessor.
There are various ways in which the controller may be implemented with most academic papers 
considering its representation by the ideal transfer function

The above can be converted to the former using, KcT2 = Kc’Ti, Kc = Kc’(T1+T2)/T2, and KcTd = Kc’T1. 
Sometimes the derivative term is fed from the output rather than the error, which will be denoted  
PI-D. This avoids the ‘derivative kick’ discussed earlier with respect to the phase lead compensator. Also 
in practice the derivative term has an additional time constant being of the form sTd/(1 + sαTd), with α 
typically around 0.1.
7.4.1	
The Ziegler–Nichols Approach
The earliest work usually referenced on PID control is that of Ziegler and Nichols (Z-N) [7.1], which 
related to identification and control, the idea being to present techniques which could be used to set 
the parameters of the PID controller by process commissioning engineers. Thus the procedure is often 
known as controller tuning and Z-N suggested the following two methods
Method 1.
An open loop step response identification of the plant was suggested with the resulting response modelled 
(‘fit’) by a first order plus dead time (FOPDT) transfer function.

They suggested that with the controller ‘in situ’ in the loop it should be put into the P mode and the gain 
turned up until an oscillation took place. The gain, of the P term, known as the critical (or ultimate) 
gain, K’c, and the frequency of the oscillation, ωc=2π/Tc, known as the critical (ultimate) frequency were 
then recorded.

Table 7.2 Z-N Method 2 Parameters
The first method is a classical identification and then controller design approach. Step responses were 
regularly used in the early days of control for identification and trying to fit to another model, if felt 
appropriate, say from physical considerations could be done. The FOPDT model, however, is often a 
good estimate for many processes. Others that have been used are second order plus time delay (SOPDT) 
and a single time constant to a large power, say 6 or higher. There is no reason why after identifying an 
FOPDT model another design method should not be used to set the controller parameters. The Z-N 
design method was based on achieving around a 25% overshoot to a set point step response.
The second method is based on the fact that if a simple linear feedback loop becomes unstable it will do 
so at a frequency where the phase shift is -180°. Thus, in principle, the approach gives the frequency, ωc, 
and the gain, 1/Kc’, of the point at -180° on the plant frequency response. From a theoretical viewpoint 
the method is fine but it suffers from many practical problems. These include:-
1.	 Even if the loop were linear the fact that many processes have very long time constants 
makes it extremely difficult and time consuming to try and find the gain, Kc’.
2.	 It can be dangerous if there is no satisfactory limiting effect in the loop as an adjustment to 
an over estimated value of Kc’ can result in a large oscillation.
3.	 Many practical loops are nonlinear. Saturation is helpful in limiting the amplitude of the 
oscillation but dead zone effects make finding Kc’ even more difficult.
7.4.2	
Time Scaling and the FOPDT Plant
Time scaling and amplitude scaling were very familiar to users of an analogue computer. Time scaling 
was seen to be useful in plotting step responses in chapter 3 since it basically reduces the parameter 
dependence by one. Here its relevance to selecting (or tuning) controller parameters for a PID controller 
controlling an FOPDT plant is discussed. If for the transfer function of equation (7.5) a normalised  
s, sn, is taken equal to sT and with ρ = τ/T the transfer function becomes

The normalised transfer function has a unit time constant and only two parameters Kp and ρ. The actual 
system has a step response which is T times slower and markings on its frequency response T times 
smaller. If this normalised plant is controlled by an ideal PID controller in the error channel with the 
transfer function of equation (7.3) then this becomes

where K = KpKc. This means that if the controller parameters are designed based on some property of 
the open or closed loop transfer function, the results will be of the form:-
K = f1(ρ), T’i = f2(ρ), and T’d = f3(ρ).
Thus for any FOPDT plant the controller parameters must be of the form
Kc = f1(ρ) /Kp, Ti = Tf2(ρ), and Td = Tf3(ρ).
for the same performance property to be maintained for all plants which can be time scaled to the same 
normalised plant. This will be referred to as consistent tuning. Method 1 of Z-N is easily seen to be 
consistent with a simple choice for the functions f1, f2 and f3 of being inversely proportional, proportional, 
and proportional to ρ, respectively. It is also easy to show that Method 2 is also consistent. Table 7.3 lists 
the functions of ρ for several consistent tuning formula which have been suggested. Apart from Z-N 
method 1 the others are Cohen and Coon (C-C) [7.2], Zhuang and Atherton (Z-A) [7.3] and Wang, 
Juang and Chan (W-J-C) [7.4]. Figures 7.11 to 7.13 show these relationships graphically for both Z-N 
methods and the others. The C-C results are omitted from f1 as its value at small values of ρ becomes large. 
The a and b parameters in the Z-A method depend on the integral performance tuning criterion used.
The book by O’Dwyer [7.5] gives a large number of so-called tuning rules for PID controllers but they 
are unfortunately not given in the normalised form which has been demonstrated here for the FOPDT 
plant. Two other plant transfer functions which can also be normalised in terms of the parameter ρ are

7.4.3 Relay Autotuning and Critical Point Design
The principle of the Z-N second method is very useful as it can be used in closed loop but the difficulty 
of adjusting the P, as mentioned earlier was a practical difficulty. With the advent of microprocessor 
controllers, however, Astrom and Hagglund [7.6] suggested a much more suitable method for practical 
implementation for estimating the critical point.

Figure 7.13 Graph of normalised derivative time against rho.
This involved replacing the P term by an ideal relay function to obtain a limit cycle. It can then easily be 
shown using a describing function (DF) analysis that the frequency of the limit cycle, ωo, is approximately 
the critical frequency, ωc, and the critical gain, Kc, is given approximately by Kc = 4h/aπ, where 2h is the 
peak to peak amplitude of the relay output and, a, is the fundamental frequency amplitude of the limit 
cycle. It can be shown that the estimate for ωc will be better than for Kc and that the results will be better 
the nearer the limit cycle at the relay input is to a sinusoid. The error introduced by replacing a by half 
the peak to peak amplitude of the limit cycle is usually quite small and is normally done in practice 
because of the ease of measurement.
Thus with a more practical approach for estimating the critical point it is appropriate to comment further 
on use of the critical point in PID tuning. First what is the principle of the Z-N method 2 in using the 
critical point for tuning? Since all that is known about the plant is its critical point then all one can do in 
selecting the controller parameters is to place this frequency at a known point on the compensated open 
loop frequency response locus. Since in the Z-N method Ti is taken equal to 4Td, which corresponds to 
the two zeros of the PID controller transfer function being real and equal, it is easy to show that for the 
PI controller this point is 0.46 arg -192° and for the PID controller it is 0.66 arg -155°.

This concept is a useful design approach and if felt appropriate a different point can be chosen, within the 
allowable range. Also since one only has freedom to adjust two controller parameters the Ti/Td ratio may 
be selected to be other than 4. It is easy to show with Ti/Td = 4, that for the FOPDT plant the controller 
parameters are obtained from the following equations for moving the critical point to g arg – (180 – φ)°.

Critical point design is a useful concept since closed loop performance is very dependent on the open 
loop frequency response in the region of the Nyquist critical point (-1, 0). Certainly if one has little 
knowledge of the plant dynamics it can be very useful as illustrated here for a plant with transfer function 
G(s) and a possible reduced order model Gr(s), for which the step responses are shown in Figure 7.14. 
The difference between the step responses is very small and it would be difficult to detect with noisy 
measurements. However, the frequency responses shown in Figure 7.15 are quite different around the 
Nyquist critical point, indeed G(s) has a finite gain margin whilst that of Gr(s) is infinite.

Classical Controller Design
Thus designing a controller based on what appears to be a reasonable reduced order model from step 
response information would be extremely poor compared with use of an approximate critical point. The 
trouble with a step response is that the higher frequency information is contained in the early part of 
the response. For the interested reader the two transfer functions are

Before concluding this section it is probably worth mentioning that although relay autotuning has been 
primarily associated with PID controllers it can also be used for other simple controllers, such as phase 
lead and phase lag [7.7]. Also by including known networks with the relay, additional information can 
be obtained, for instance including a tuned filter at the estimated limit cycle frequency will make the 
limit cycle almost sinusoidal and yield more accurate critical point information.
7.4.4	
Further Design Aspects
When a transfer function model is available for a plant for which a PID controller is to be used then a 
frequency response approach to achieve certain properties, say a phase margin as used for the lead and 
lag network designs, can be used. Often to make it easier this is done with a fixed ratio for Ti/Td, typically 
4 since the approximate Bode amplitude diagram for this is a ‘V’ shape. Pole placement designs are also 
often suggested but these have a major difficulty that for the ideal PID controller in the error channel 
one has two zeros in the closed loop transfer function. Their effect on the closed loop response is not 
easy to predict and their location is affected by the choice of the poles. In general the best method of 
design for selecting parameters of fixed form controllers is to use optimisation methods, which will be 
discussed in the next chapter.
Practical PID controllers always have a facility to prevent ‘integral windup’ that is a mechanism, and 
many algorithms are used, for stopping the integrator integrating when plant input or actuator saturation 
occurs. Also it is quite common for PID controllers to be sold in pairs as they are often used in cascade 
in process control, as illustrated in the block diagram of Figure 7.16. The set point for the inner loop 
controller comes from the outer loop controller and two measurements are available as feedback from 
the process. The main advantage is to obtain a faster reaction to the inner loop disturbance D1. But often 
an improved input-output response can also be achieved. Also the inner loop controller is often set in 
just the P or PI mode.

Fixed Controllers

Introduction
The basic concept here is to optimise the controller parameters to meet a performance criterion. Before 
the prevalence of digital computers criteria were put forward for which analytical results could possibly 
be found, or computations could be done using analogue simulation. A logical choice was to choose a 
criterion based on minimisation of the error over time, as the objective of good control is to maintain a 
minimum error between the desired and actual output,. Thus integral performance criteria of the form

summarised in Table 8.1.

which is known as Parseval’s integral. It can be evaluated when E(s) = c(s)/d(s) is a ratio of polynomials in s,

 (Theorem (v) Appendix A.). The difficulty for hand calculations is 
that the order of d(s) doubles with each differentiation, however, it is easy to write a computer program 
to compute the results for some low values of n. An excellent treatise on the analytical approach which 
also considers a weighting on the control effort in the performance criterion and possible satisfaction 
of constraints is reference [8.2].
8.2	
Some Simple Examples
Here some simple analytical examples are given to illustrate the approach and bring out some basic ideas. 
For realistic practical problems, however, results will normally have to be obtained computationally.
Example 1
Consider a feedback loop with G = 1/s, i.e. an integrator, and Gc = K a gain. For a unit step input R = 1/s 
and E = 1/(s + K). Clearly e = exp(-Kt) and since the expression for e is so simple its integral squared 
value can be found from either the time domain or s- domain integral to give the ISE = 1/2K. This is 
as expected, since the maximum phase lag of the loop is 90° it remains stable no matter how high the 
gain. However, the initial value of the control signal at the input to the plant, given by u = Kexp(-Kt), 
increases as K increases. One way to find a finite gain value is to put a constraint on some function of 
u. A simple solution is to minimise the time domain integral

(8.5)
By differentiation, it is found that K = 1/λ yields the minimum value for I of λ. This example although 
trivial brings out the point that care has to be taken in obtaining solutions to optimisation problems. It is 
important to understand the problem so as to know whether a solution will only exist if some constraints 
are imposed and also when a minimum has been found that it is realistic. Systematic approaches may be 
necessary, for example if a controller has two variable parameters it may be desirable to fix one initially 
and just look at the effects of varying the other.

Example 2
Consider G = 1/s(s + 1)2 and Gc = K. In this case, it is easily shown that if K is increased the system will 
go unstable for K > 2 so there should be a value of K < 2 which minimises the ISE. For a unit step input 
one obtains

overshoot of 36%. Incidentally, a second order transfer function corresponding to the dominant complex 
pair of poles has an overshoot of 40%.

Parameter Optimisation for Fixed Controllers
Example 3
As another example consider the control of a double integrator plant, G(s) = 1/s2, by a phase lead 
controller with transfer function (1+ sT)/(1 + asT), in both the forward, Gc, and feedback, H, paths. 
With the controller in Gc, the value of, E, for R a unit step is

Differentiating with respect to T, shows that the optimum value of T = a -1/2, and the corresponding 
minimum value of I3 is a1/2/(1 – a). This can be seen to be infinite when a = 1, as the system is neutrally 
stable, and tends to zero as a tends to zero, which results in the derivative kick of the control signal 
tending to infinity. On the other hand if the controller is placed in H, the closed loop transfer function is

Differentiation of this expression shows that the absolute minimum value obtainable is 0.866 when  
a = 1/3 and the value of T = 1.732.
Three simple examples have been taken to illustrate the analytical approach to minimising the ISE, 
which corresponds to n = 0 in the general criterion of equation (8.3). This has been done to illustrate 
the procedure whilst keeping the algebra relatively simple. If, for example, one wished to investigate the 
last example for the ISTE criterion, that is n = 1, then one has to differentiate E(s) with respect to s. This 
increases the order of the denominator from 3 to 6, the algebra for the integral becomes ‘horrendous’ 
and differentiation of the result is then required for the optimum values. Computationally, however, 
the minimum can be found very quickly, one selects values for T and a, evaluates the ISTE and has an 
optimisation algorithm built around to adjust T and a to converge to the optimum values, which will of 
course exist if the compensator is in H.
One reason for having covered the classical optimization approach in some detail is that it leads naturally 
to the consideration of standard forms. These provide an interesting closed loop direct synthesis approach 
for obtaining controller parameters.

Standard Forms
Based on the approach of the previous section it is possible to obtain normalised closed loop transfer 
functions which satisfy error performance criteria. Their value is that they indicate ‘good’ pole locations 
for the closed loop transfer function. To illustrate the approach consider a feedback system with  
G = 1/s(s + a), Gc = K and H = 1. For a unit step input E = (s + a)/(s2 + as + K). The ISE can be found 
from Table D.1 and since the denominator of E is second order it is denoted, I2, and is given by

This value of V gives a step response overshoot of around 16%. The value is less than the unit value 
required for no overshoot in the step response and the value of 0.707 required for no peak in the 
frequency response.

standard form of the second order all pole closed loop transfer function which minimises the ISE, J0, for 
H = 1. Note also that the forward loop transfer function, GGc, must contain an integrator to ensure zero 
steady state error to a step input. Standard forms for any order of the denominator polynomial and for 
various integral performance criteria can be found and written, with the subscript n dropped from s, as

The required coefficient values as well as the resulting value of the performance index are given in  
Table 8.2. Note the value of the index increases for larger n because of the time weighting factor as the 
settling time is greater than unity.
It is interesting to look at the coefficients of these transfer functions. First, purely of academic interest, is 
the fact that for the ISE, that is n = 0, all the coefficients are integer values. More important, however, is 
the fact that as n is increased the coefficients increase in value and the step responses have less overshoot 
with only a small change in settling time. This can be seen for the second order system as the damping 
ratio V, equal to d1/2 in Table 8.2, increases as n increases. These points are further demonstrated by  
Fig. 8.1 which shows the step responses for j = 4 for n = 0 to 3.

Table 8.2 All Pole Standard Forms for T0j (From reference 8.4)
Since adding a compensator often results in a closed loop transfer function having a zero, a suggested 
use for these standard forms in controller design has been to add a prefilter with a pole to cancel the 
zero. To avoid the use of a prefilter studies have been done to investigate standard forms with a zero,

Parameter Optimisation for Fixed Controllers
In early work on this topic results were given to minimise the ITAE criterion but with the requirement 
that the system should also have zero steady state error to a ramp input, which requires the constraint 
that c1 = d1. Recently [8.4] results have been derived without this constraint but the required d coefficients 
vary with the choice of c1, as illustrated in Fig 8.2 for T14(s). It is also possible to plot how the poles of 
the transfer function vary with the zero parameter c1, and some of these can be found in reference [8.4]. 
These plots show that the optimal pole positions vary appreciably with the value of the zero.

The concept of trying to design a controller so that the closed loop transfer function has a specific form 
is useful, as it addresses the closed loop performance directly, and will be illustrated by an example in 
the next section, as well as being given further consideration in chapter 11. There are many closed loop 
standard forms that might be chosen apart from those based on the criteria of Table 8.1. For example, 
the Butterworth filter form could be selected.

Parameter Optimisation for Fixed Controllers
It can be seen that the 3 poles of the transfer function can be allocated by the choice of the three controller 
parameters, but the two zeros cannot then be located independently as their location is dependent on 
the parameters chosen to locate the poles. If, however a PI-PD controller is used, that is a controller 
whose output is obtained from the error feeding the PI and the plant output the PD, then the open loop 
transfer function is

Parameter Optimisation for Fixed Controllers
In principle the time scale, α, can be selected by the choice of Kc, and the coefficients for the chosen 
standard form; d2 by the choice of Td, d1 by the choice of Kf      , and c1 by the choice of Ti. In practice Kc will 
normally be constrained to an upper value, possibly to limit the initial control effort, and Ti will involve 
a trade off between the values chosen for α and c1.
Consider, for example, the case of the plant parameters Kp = 2 and λ = 4 and constraining Kc to a 
maximum of 1. Then two possible designs could be:-
1)	 Time scaling by 2. This means selecting α = 2 which gives Ti = 0.25 and c1 = 0.5. For this 
value of c1 the values of d2 and d1, respectively, to minimise the ISTE are 1.595 and 2.120. 
This gives Td = 1.595 and Kf = 5.240
2)	 No time scaling. This means selecting α = 1 which gives Ti = 2 and c1= 2. For this value of 
c1 the values of d2 and d1, respectively, to minimise the ISTE are 2.215 and 2.991. This gives 
Td = 1.107 and Kf = 2.495.
Because both designs are based on minimisation of the ISTE the closed loop step responses are quite 
similar in shape with around 10% overshoot, and the first twice as fast as the second. The faster time 
scaled response in this case has been achieved not by increasing the controller gain Kc but by variations 
of Ti and c1.

Further Comments
The topic of optimising the parameters of a fixed form controller has been discussed in this chapter. 
Some simple analytical examples based on the ISE integral performance criterion were first discussed and 
then a simple algebraic approach based on standard forms was given, which will be considered further 
in chapter 11. It is very common to use fixed form controllers in industrial design and with today’s 
computation facilities optimisation of the parameters to meet the design specifications is an excellent 
practical approach. References [8.5, 8.6] describe software that has been developed to do designs using 
optimisation techniques and to show how the various performance constraints might be traded off 
against each other. When a large number of criteria need to be considered these programs can become 
very complicated. Optimisation approaches, such as the use of integral performance criteria when there 
are only a few variable parameters, can often be achieved using simulation, as the performance criteria 
listed in Table 8.1 can easily be found from a simulation run. One may then either interact with the 
simulation manually to obtain the optimal parameters or do so with an optimisation program controlling 
the simulation runs.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations.

Further Controller Design Considerations

Introduction
Additional aspects related to compensator design are covered in this chapter. The first topic discussed 
in the next section is lag-lead compensator design an extension of the lead and lag compensators 
discussed in chapter 7. In the next two sections some aspects of speed and position control are discussed 
with particular emphasis on the rejection of steady state disturbances. It is shown that this requires an 
integration in the controller which complicates the design for obtaining a good step response. Simple 
rigid body type plant transfer functions are used in these sections, whereas in many cases it is required 
to control the speed or position of a shaft which is driven through a flexible link. Typically this results in 
a transfer function containing not only complex poles but also complex zeros. To illustrate the difficulties 
of controlling such systems with a series compensator the next section considers the control of a plant 
transfer function with complex poles.
The final section discusses the problem of the effect of parameter variations on control system 
performance. Although this is a topic of major interest in design it is a very difficult theoretical one and 
few results of practical significance have been obtained.
However modern calculation and simulation methods are now so fast that the increase in time required 
for doing studies with different sets of parameters is usually economically justifiable.
9.2	
Lag-Lead Compensation
As mentioned in section 7.2 it may not be possible to achieve a satisfactory phase lead design and the 
bandwidth achievable by a phase lag design may be less than desired. It may be possible to improve 
the loop performance by a lag-lead design. This is illustrated by taking a system with the same transfer 
function dynamics but with a higher gain in the numerator, which might be required to reduce the steady 
state error to a ramp input, Kv, as mentioned in section 7.2. Consider therefore

To add a phase lead network to G(s) to achieve the same phase margin of 40° will require a lead of 
around 60° which is very high and the design may not be achievable. An alternative is to use a lag-lead 
design where the gain is reduced by a lag network before the gain crossover frequency is reached. If 
after adding the lag network the frequency response around the gain crossover frequency is similar to 
that of G1(s) then the phase lead network of section 7.2 will be suitable. Thus, choosing a lag network 
with transfer function

the required region, as shown in Figure 9.1.

The resulting system has a phase margin of 39° at a frequency of 4.72 rads/s. The closed loop step response 
is shown in Figure 9.2 together with that using a lag network design, and as expected an appreciable 
increase in the speed of response has been achieved.

Speed Control
Control of speed is a common problem encountered by many control engineers, perhaps the most 
common well known situation being the cruise control fitted to many automobiles. Here it will be 
assumed that the speed is rotary and the transfer function from the torque to the load, where the speed 
has to be controlled, is





(9.5)
In practice there may be more than one time constant but quite often there is one dominant one as 
assumed here. A problem which often arises, however, is when the coupling from the drive torque to the 
load is not rigid and a more complicated transfer function results with both complex poles and zeros. 
This presents a much more difficult control problem which will be commented on further in section 9.5. 
The control loop is typically as shown in Figure 5.1, where N is assumed zero and H will convert speed, 
say radians per second to voltage with a time constant which is probably small enough to be neglected. 
In order that the speed should remain constant at the required value with a fixed reference input, R, 
assuming H is calibrated correctly, the controller Gc must contain an integration. This can also be seen 
from Figure 5.1 to be a requirement for a constant disturbance D to have no effect on the load speed in 
the steady state as the output of the controller must have a signal equal and opposite to D. Thus, Gc, is 
typically a PI controller and the open loop transfer function is

One approach to the design is to choose T1 = T, so that T(s) becomes a single time constant transfer 
function, although such a zero-pole cancellation will never be correct in practice due to uncertainty 
in the system parameters. This does provide a simple analytical approach and k can in principle be 
increased, by increasing Ki and consequently KP for a given T1, as much as required to speed up the 
system response. In practice k will be restricted as increasing k increases the maximum magnitude of the 
controller output signal. Another approach is to do a design based on the open loop transfer function 
of equation (9.6) with T1 ≠ T, using say frequency response or root locus techniques. One point to note 
is that if the closed loop transfer function is written as

 and 2ωo = (1 + kT1)/T, 
then an overshoot may still exist in the closed loop step response due to the zero. It is easily shown that

and that it has a maximum when t = T1/(ωoT1 – 1). Thus an overshoot will exist when this is positive, 
that is for ωoT1 > 1.
9.4	
Position Control
Many of the early applications of control engineering were involved with position control due to the 
requirement for accurate position control of guns and other devices during the 1940s. Indeed several of 
the early textbooks written in control engineering used the word servomechanisms in the title to account 
for the fact that much of their coverage was related to position or speed control. Today there remain 
many requirements for accurate position control from large drives and robotics to heads for reading or 
writing to rotary storage media. Again if flexure in the drive dynamics can be neglected the simple rigid 
body transfer function for the plant in Figure 5.1 of a position control may often be taken as
G(s) = K / s(1 + sT)
(9.10)
There will be no steady state error to a step input as G(s) contains an integration term, so that a satisfactory 
closed loop step response may be achieved with Gc(s) a constant gain, phase lead or lag network. Also 
velocity feedback may be used which means that the transfer function H(s) is of the form 1+sT1 and the 
closed loop transfer function will become

Apart from the dynamic response requirements more stringent steady state requirements are often 
required of a position control system such as being able to follow a ramp input with no position error or 
reject the effect of any constant disturbance D on the output. Both these require the controller to have an 
integration term. If H = 1 and Gc is a PI controller Gc = (Kp + sKi) then the closed loop transfer function is

This avoids the zero and therefore is somewhat easier to design for a required dynamic response. One 
simple way is to make use of standard forms. The transfer function in normalised form is

. Since there are only two variable controller parameters 
KC and T1 one can choose the values so that the denominator coefficients fit a standard form but in doing 
so the time scale factor, α, is fixed. Figure 9.3 shows the closed loop step responses obtained using this 
design procedure to achieve the performance indices Jn for n = 0 to 3.

A Transfer Function with Complex Poles
As mentioned earlier plant transfer functions may involve complex poles which may be lightly damped. 
Designing of satisfactory series compensators for such systems is not easy so this is a problem which will 
be examined again in chapter 11 when state feedback compensation is discussed. To see the difficulties 
consider the transfer function

where the complex poles have a natural frequency of unity and a damping ratio of 0.1. The phase of the 
Bode plot changes rapidly near the resonant frequency of unity as seen in Figure 9.4 and with a unit 
gain controller the closed loop has a gain margin of 6dB and a phase margin of 89°. The step response, 
however, has oscillations on it due to the complex poles (see curve Kc = 1 in Figure 9.5).

The poor step response is due to the relatively low gain margin, not low phase margin, and a simple phase 
lead design to speed up the response is not possible. A possible approach is to use a compensator with 
two zeros and two poles with the former being chosen to cancel the complex poles of the plant. Choosing

Kc can be chosen equal to 0.5 which gives a gain margin of 12dB, a phase margin of 44° and a step 
response with around 25% overshoot. The problem is if the parameters of the plant are not as assumed. 
Figure 9.5 shows step responses for a controller with gain 1 and 0.5, the slower responses, and with the 
transfer function of equation (9.16) with Kc = 0.5 for the three cases of the plant complex poles having 
the nominal damping ratio of 0.1 and also 0.15 and 0.05. The step response is thus hardly affected by an 
incorrect assumption for the damping ratio.
On the other hand the open loop Bode diagrams are shown in Figure 9.6 for the compensator plus the 
plant with resonant frequencies for the poles of 0.8 and 1.2, not the nominal value of unity. It can be 
seen that the gain margin for the resonant frequency of 0.8 is very small and therefore not surprisingly 
the step response is highly oscillatory as shown in Figure 9.7, together with that for a natural frequency 
of 1.2. It is thus seen from this example that the closed loop step response is very sensitive to an over 
estimation of the resonant frequency of the plant poles.

The Effect of Parameter Variations
Most methods of controller design, as has been seen, require the use of a mathematical model for the 
process. In practice this model, which may be called the nominal model, is always an approximation of 
the real situation. Further the model may change dependent on environmental changes or with age. The 
effect of inaccuracies in a model on the system performance has therefore always been a concern of the 
design engineer. The comments in this section will assume that the form of the model is not in doubt 
but uncertainty exists in the estimates for some of its parameters. From a practical viewpoint today’s 
simulation facilities are so fast that for the majority of situations after a design is completed multiple 
simulations can be done to assess the effect of changes in model parameters. However some theoretical 
results are available which will be commented on here. Much of the recent interest in this topic was 
started as a result of the work on the stability of interval polynomials by Kharitonov considered in the 
next section.

Stability of Interval Polynomials

the stability of interval polynomials. Kharitonov showed that for the interval polynomial

Although this may seem a surprising result it is easily proved from the Mikhailov criterion of section 
5.4.2. It can be easily shown that the value set of an interval polynomial at a fixed frequency is a rectangle 
(Kharitonov rectangle) as shown in Figure 9.8, that is the value of every polynomial of the family at that 
frequency lies within or on the rectangle, whose sides are parallel to the real and imaginary axes. Since 
the sides of the rectangular value set are parallel to the real and imaginary axes, it can easily be shown 
that the exclusion of the origin from the rectangular value set at all frequencies, which will be required 
for all the polynomials to satisfy the Mikhailov criterion, can be checked by using the corner points which 
correspond to the four Kharitonov polynomials. The Kharitonov theorem is only applicable to interval 
uncertain parameters but unfortunately the characteristic equations of even simple control systems do 
not normally have an interval uncertainty structure. For example, to take a simple case, consider a plant 
transfer function model of the form

 the exact result 
of the Routh-Hurwitz criterion is K < 3/4 whereas the Kharitonov result is K < 3/8, which is conservative 
by a factor of 2. The fact that one can obtain an exact solution from the Routh-Hurwitz criterion is 
because this is one of a few unique situations. It does, however, serve to show the conservativeness of 
results that can be expected from the Kharitonov criterion when applied to practical control situations, 
because of the parameter dependence typical of the terms in the closed loop characteristic equation.

The maximum gain and maximum phase lag at a particular frequency will be obtained from the product 
of the maximum gains and the sum of the maximum phase lags at that frequency of the individual 
elements, with a similar result for the minimum values. Therefore considering the individual elements in 
turn beginning with the time delay, since its gain is always unity, the maximum (minimum) phase lag is 
obtained with the maximum (minimum) value of τ. Also from sketches of Bode gain and phase diagrams 
for a single time constant transfer function it is obvious that the curves for T  give the maximum gain and 
minimum phase shift and those for T  give the minimum gain and maximum phase shift, respectively. 
The curves for all other values of T lie within the respective gain and phase boundaries of these plots.

Unfortunately it is not possible to derive similar results for Nyquist plots. Some results have been obtained 
but they do not provide accurate bounds on the plots [9.3]. Also although accurate bounding of the 
Bode plots is obtained by the above approach results obtained using them are still conservative because 
the link between the gain plot and the phase plot of a specific transfer function is lost. To show this, 
consider the closed loop stability problem for the open loop transfer function of equation (9.19) with the 
same bounds on the time constants. The bounds of the Bode plots are shown in Figure 9.9 and to ensure 
stability one has to use the lower bound of the phase plot and the upper bound of the gain plot. This give 
a value for stability of K < 0.46, an improvement on the Kharitonov result but still very conservative.

State Space Methods
10	 State Space Methods
10.1	
Introduction
State space modelling was briefly introduced in chapter 2. Here more coverage is provided of state space 
methods before some of their uses in control system design are covered in the next chapter. A state space 
model, or representation, as given in equation (2.26), is denoted by the two equations
%X
$[
[

 


(10.1)
'X
&[
\

 

(10.2)
where equations (10.1) and (10.2) are respectively the state equation and output equation.
The representation can be used for both single-input single-output systems (SISO) and multiple-input 
multiple-output systems (MIMO). For the MIMO representation A, B, C and D will all be matrices. If the 
state dimension is n and there are r inputs and m outputs then A, B, C and D will be matrices of order, 
n × n, n × r, m × n and m × r, respectively. For SISO systems B will be an n × 1 column vector, often 
denoted by b, C a 1 × n row vector, often denoted by cT, and D a scalar often denoted by d. Here the 
capital letter notation will be used, even though only SISO systems are considered, and B, C, and D will 
have the aforementioned dimensions. As mentioned in chapter 2 the choice of states is not unique and 
this will be considered further in section 10.3. First, however, obtaining a solution of the state equation 
is discussed in the next section.
10.2	
Solution of the State Equation
Obtaining the time domain solution to the state equation is analogous to the classical approach used to 
solve the simple first order equation

Thus under the state transformation of equation (10.13) a different state space representation (T–1 AT, 
T–1B, CT, D ) is obtained. If the new A matrix is denoted by Az = T–1 AT then it is easy to show that A 
and Az have the following properties
1)	 The same eigenvalues
2)	 The same determinant
3)	 The same trace (Sum of elements on the main diagonal)
There are some specific forms of the A matrix which are often commonly used in control engineering 
and not unsurprisingly these relate to how one might consider obtaining a state space representation 
for a transfer function, the topic of the next section.

State Representations of Transfer Functions
This topic was introduced in section 2.3 where the controllable canonical form for a differential equation 
was considered. Here this and some other forms will be considered by making use of block diagrams where 
every state will be an integrator output. To develop some representations consider the transfer function

numerator terms are provided by feeding forward from the states to give the required output. Thus, 
for our simple example, this can be shown in the block diagram of Figure 10.1, done in SIMULINK, 
where since the transfer function is third order n = 3, there are three integrators, blocks with transfer 
functions 1/s, in series. Feedback from the states, where the integrator outputs from left to right are the 
states x3, x2, and x1, respectively, is by the coefficients -8, -14 and -7. (negative and in the reverse order 
of the transfer function denominator). The numerator coefficients provide feedforward from the states, 
with the s2 term from x3.

MATLAB has a companion form, which for any state space system G=ss(A,B,C,D), will be returned on 
typing sys=canon(G,’companion’). The companion representation sys will have an A matrix which is 
the transpose of the above A matrix and a B = (1 0 0)T.
10.4.2	
Observable Canonical Form
The observable canonical form is related to the controllable form by the following relationships,  
Ao = Ac
T, Bo = Cc
T and Co = Bc
T. The subscripts c and o relate to the controllable and observable form 
matrices respectively and T denotes the transpose. It is left to the interested reader to develop a block 
diagram similar to Figure 10.1 for this form.

Another simple way of obtaining a state space representation of a transfer function is to make repeated 
use of the state representation of Figure 10.3 for the one-zero one-pole transfer function  (ds + c)/(s + a) 
which has a state space representation (a,1,e-ad,d) for the single state x.

Thus for a transfer function with real poles and zeros in factored form given by G(s) = (s + 1) (s + 2)/s 
(s + 3) (s + 5) one can split it into one of several possible series (cascade) combinations such as

State Transformations between Different Forms
Given a state space representation then one can evaluate the corresponding transfer function and use 
this to obtain a different state space representation. In some cases, however, it is more convenient if one 
can obtain the specific state transformation, T, discussed in section 10.3, that will do this directly. It 
can be shown that any A matrix can be transformed to a diagonal form by its own eigenvector matrix. 
Eigenvectors only define directions, however, so that such a matrix is not unique with a scalar multiplier 
being allowed on any column vector ti of T. The eigenvector, ti, corresponding to a particular eigenvalue, 
si, of a matrix A is found from

also is the vector Bc. From the two equations

This is tedious and involves calculating powers of A, substituting them in equation (10.5) and finding

The Inverse Laplace Transform
This involves finding φ(t) from the inverse of equation (10.10), that is φ(t) = 
 -1(sI-A)-1. This is 
straightforward but very laborious for calculating the required matrix inversion, except for low order 
matrices, A. One then has to find the inverse Laplace transforms of the individual matrix terms which 
are functions of s.

Then, in block diagram form this consists of the four modes at -1, -2, -3, -4 which are connected 
respectively to the input and output, output only, input only and to neither input or output. The transfer 
function from input to output is simply 1/(s+1) as the -1 mode is the only one connected to both the input 
and output. Since the -1 mode is connected to both input and output it is said to be both controllable 
and observable. The -2 mode is said to be uncontrollable and observable being connected to the output 
only; the -3 mode controllable and unobservable being connected to the input only; and the -4 mode is 
said to be uncontrollable and unobservable being connected to neither the input or the output. Given 
a state space description it is desirable, as will be seen in the next chapter, to know which modes are in 
the different situations exemplified by the four above modes. A system is said to be controllable if all the 
states are controllable, and observable if all the states are observable. The formal definitions are given 
below. From the above example it is clear that only those modes which are controllable and observable 
appear in the transfer function between input and output. Thus, if a system with an n × n A matrix is 
controllable and observable the denominator of its transfer function will be of order n (i.e. it will have 
n poles).

Controllability
A system is controllable if there exists an input u which transfers the initial state x(0) to the zero state  
x(t) = 0 in a finite time t. Given any SISO system, A (n × n) and B (n × 1) matrices then it can be shown 
that the system will be controllable if the (n × n) controllability matrix X = (B AB A2B .... An–1B) has rank 
n. It will be noticed that this matrix is the first part of the transformation matrix for T in equation (10.17) 
and, as a consequence, a system can only be put into controllable canonical form if it is controllable. Or, 
alternatively, a system which has a controllable canonical form state space representation is controllable.
10.7.2	
Observability
A system is observable if the initial state x(0) can be uniquely determined by observing the output over 
a finite time t. Given any SISO system, A (n × n) and C (1 × n) matrices then it can be shown that the 
system will be observable if the (n × n) observability matrix

Cascade Connection
In previous chapters on control system design significant attention has been given to cascade compensation 
and the effect on the open loop frequency response locus of adding a compensator. If the compensator 
and plant are given in state space form then it may be desirable to obtain a state space representation 
for their cascade combination. Thus, let the compensator Gc(s) with state z, input e, and output u have 
the state space representation (A1,B1,C1,D1) and the plant G(s) with state x, have input u, and output c 
have the state space representation (A2,B2,C2,D2), then

Some State Space Design Methods
11	 Some State Space Design 
Methods
11.1	
Introduction
The previous chapters on controller design have mainly concentrated on introducing the compensator 
in the forward path, but use of a simple compensator in the feedback path has been discussed. Also 
feedback compensation has been mentioned with respect to the PI-PD controller and velocity feedback 
in a position control system. Both these two cases can be regarded as feedback of two states, namely, 
the output to form the error and the derivative of the output. It is therefore appropriate to look in 
general at how the performance of a control system can be changed by the feedback of state variables. 
If this is to be done in practice then the state variables have to be available either as measured values or 
estimates. Obtaining measurements can be costly because of the requirement for additional sensors so 
in many cases the variables are estimated using estimation methods. This is a topic outside the scope 
of this book but it will suffice to say that estimation methods have become relatively easy to implement 
with the use of modern technologies employing microprocessors with significant software included to 
do the required computations. In the next section results are derived for full state variable feedback and 
this is followed by a discussion of the linear quadratic regulator problem. The problem of direct closed 
loop transfer function synthesis, or standard forms, is looked at again in terms of using state variable 
feedback to achieve such a design. Finally as an example of the benefits of using a state variable feedback 
design the problem of controlling a plant having a transfer function with lightly damped complex poles, 
considered initially in section 9.5 is reconsidered.
11.2	
State Variable Feedback

so that the system input

and in principle the poles can be placed anywhere by choice of the components of 
T
ck
. Larger values of 
the components of 
T
ck
will speed up the system response but in practice this will not be possible due to 
physical limitations on the magnitudes of signals for linear operation. The gain Kc is basically redundant, 
however, it is useful to include it as the structure might, as is clear from Figure 11.1, be a resultant closed 
loop system with Kc the controller gain. In this case the controller input will include the error and for this 
to be the case when the state x1 is the output, k1 will be equal to one. If the system is not in controllable 
canonical form then the coefficient terms in the characteristic equation will not each involve a single 
feedback gain. This means that simultaneous equations need to be solved to find the required feedback 
gains to give a specific characteristic equation. One way to avoid this is to transform the original system 
to controllable canonical form, determine the required feedback gains for this representation and then 
transform these gains back to the required feedback values from the original states. The system must be 
controllable to do this transformation and it can be shown that this is a required condition to be able 
to place the poles in desired locations. Thus, if the calculated state feedback gain vector is kc
T from the 
controllable form states xc and the transformation from the original states x is x = Txc then the required 
vector kT for the original states, x, is obtained from the relationship kT = kc
TT-1. Several algorithms are 
available in MATLAB which calculate the required feedback gain vector kT for a given system (A,B) to 
give specified pole locations.

Obviously the solution for kT depends upon the choice of the positive scalar, R, and the matrix Q which 
must be at least semi-positive definite. Although this is a very elegant theoretical result, the solution 
depends on the choice of the weighting matrix Q and scalar R. No simple method is available for 
choosing their values so that the closed loop performance meets a given specification. A further point 
is that whatever values are chosen then the open loop frequency response will avoid the circle of unit 
radius centred at (-1,0) on the Nyquist plot [11.2]. This means a phase margin of at least 90° for a typical 
control system open loop transfer function, which makes the design very conservative. The command 
[x,l,g] = care(A,B,cT*c,R) in MATLAB will return the solution P for the ARE in x, where the vector c 
defines the matrix Q by

where the time scale factor by which the transfer function is ‘faster’ than the normalised one is  
α = (KpKc)1/5 and di = (ai+kc(i+1)Kc)/α(5-i) for i = 1 to 4. Thus time scaling is achieved by varying Kc and then 
the standard form accomplished by choosing the values of kc2 to kc5 to give the required values of d1 to 
d4. Speeding up of the response can be done by increasing Kc or by increasing the feedback gains but this 
also increases the magnitude of the control signal. Thus, in practice limiting values will normally exist 
for these quantities. Trade offs are of course possible if there is some flexibility in the allowable response 
time. It may, for example, be possible to choose the time scale so as to require no feedback from one 
state or to realise an almost standard form with no feedback from more than one state.
If the plant has a zero then Cf will be of the form Cf = (Kp K2 0 0 0). Proceeding as above the only change 
is that the numerator of the transfer function will be KcKp+KcK2s which in normalised form is 1+c1sn, 
with c1 = αK2/Kp and the parameters di now need to be chosen for the chosen value of c1, which depends 
on the time scale factor.
For a plant transfer function with no integration term the design can be achieved using a PI controller. 
In this case again assuming the plant transfer function is in controllable canonical form

where di = [a(i-1)+kci]/α(6-i) for i = 2 to 5, d1 = (a0+kc1+KpK2)/α5, c1 = αK2/K1, and the time scale factor 
α = (KpK1)1/6. Thus, in principle K1 can be chosen to select the time scale, K2 to select the zero and the 
feedback gains to get the correct values of the d coefficients for the chosen zero. Again trade offs are 
possible if there is flexibility in the choice of the response speed. To illustrate the procedure two examples 
are given below.

The corresponding system transfer function is (10s+10)/(s3+5s2+6s), which is seen to contain an 
integration term. Designs are carried out for the ISTE and IST2E criteria, with α=1 and 2. First for the 
ISTE cases with α = 1, Kc = 0.1, c1 = 1, d1 = 2.32, d2 = 1.80 giving Kckc
T = (1 -3.68 -3.20) and KckT = (1 -6.88

T = (8 5.80 -0.60) and KckT 
= (8 5.20 7.40). For the IST2E cases with α = 1, Kc = 0.1, c1 = 1, d1 = 2.43, d2 = 2.14 giving Kckc

which can be put into normalised form by dividing by 10K1.
The time scale factor α = (10K1)1/4 and the coefficients of the normalised form are c1 = αK2/K1, d3 = 
(3+kc3)/α, d2 = (7+kc2)/α2 and d3 = (10+kc1+10K2)/α3. From examination of these values it can be seen that 
time scaling by two should give reasonable feedback gain values. Fig 11.3 shows the coefficients required 
as functions of c1 for ISE, ISTE and IST2E designs, from which it can again be seen that the coefficients 
increase with increasing values of c1 and are larger for a given c1 the higher the time weighting in the 
performance index. Designs are done to minimise the ISTE with α = 2 and c1 = 1 and 4. For these two 
cases the required values of the feedback vector kc
T are (4.0 6.92 0.64) and (-0.08 16.0 2.04), respectively. 
From the original system states the required vectors are kc
TT-1 and are (1.68 9.24 2.32) and (-1.06 17.0 
0.98), respectively. The resulting output responses for the two cases are shown in Fig 11.4, where the 
one with the faster rise time is for c1 = 4.

much smaller than that of the s term. With kc1 = , the nominal parameters substituted and the controller

, which is in 
normalised form. Doing an ISTE design requires kc3 = 1.272and kc2 = 1.042. Closed loop step responses 
are shown for this design in Figure 11.5. The responses marked 0.8 and 1.2 are obtained with the natural 
frequency of the plant at these values rather than the nominal one of unity. The three responses shown, 
all marked 1.0, are for the nominal natural frequency of unity and with damping ratios equal to 0.05, 
0.1 the nominal value, and 0.15, respectively, for the plant. It can be seen from these results that a much 
better performance can be achieved by state feedback than by the series compensator used in section 9.5 
if the plant parameters change.

The result of (1) is easily shown from the defining integral. It will also be seen on doing the integral that 
the solution can only exist provided Re(s) > -a, so that the integrand tends to zero as t→∞. Mathematical 
rigour such as this and the fact that a contour integral exists to evaluate f(t) from F(s) do not normally 
need to be considered for control engineering applications. Results (2) and (3) are then easily obtained 
from (1) by writing sin wt and cos wt in terms of complex exponentials, i.e. and using the superposition 
theorem (i) below. Useful theorems are:

where ˙ denotes the derivative w.r.t. time. Taking transforms of both sides of the equation and denoting 
the transforms of y(t) and u(t) by Y(s) and U(s), as is a standard convention, use of the theorem in (iii)

that is

the resulting expression is known as the transfer function between the input, u, and output, y. Systems

To obtain 
 -1[F(s)] one first puts F(s) into partial fractions. This requires determination of the roots of 
the denominator of F(s) which will be real or complex pairs. If (4) and (5) are used then the complex 
roots may be left as a quadratic factor.

Partial fraction expansions can be obtained using MATLAB but it separates the quadratic into the two 
complex poles (s + 0.5 + j0.866) and (s + 0.5 – j0.866). The command to do this is [r,p,k]=residue(b,a). 
The required inputs are vectors b and a, the coefficients of the numerator and denominator polynomials 
in descending order. The residues are returned in r, the poles in p and any direct gain in k. Thus for the 
above transfer function one obtains:-
>> [r,p,k]=residue([2 4 3],[1 2 2 1])
r =
1.0000
0.5000 – 0.8660i
0.5000 + 0.8660i
p =
-1.0000
-0.5000 + 0.8660i
-0.5000 – 0.8660i
k =
[]
The quadratic factor can then be split into the forms of (4) and (5), that is

The Routh-Hurwitz Criterion.
Research on the roots of a polynomial was an important area of work in mathematics in the 19th century. 
The work of Routh and later Hurwitz led to the Routh-Hurwitz criterion which is useful for investigating 
the stability of linear feedback systems. Given the polynomial

and so on until one number is reached in the first column, here denoted by g1. The number of sign 
changes of the numbers in the first column, that is fn, fn–1,b1, c1, …… g1, gives the number of roots in the 
right hand side of the s plane.
Thus for a stable polynomial, for f0 > 0, they will all be positive. Two special cases arise (i) when a number 
in the first column is zero and (ii) when all the elements of a row are zero. These are discussed with 
examples in many texts. In case (i) the zero is replaced by a small positive value ε, the table completed, 
and the sign changes examined as ε→0. Case (ii) arises when a pair of roots give a term of the form 
(s2±α2). In this case the table is restarted by forming a polynomial from the coefficients in the row above 
the row with the zeros.
