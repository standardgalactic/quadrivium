The lyrics of this song are credited to Pavel Nikitin, after modifying the 
lyrics of “Le temps des fleurs” by Dalida.  
Pavel was in Valence, France in November 2014 as jury member in the 
PhD dissertation of Gianfranco and also as speaker in the workshop “Hot 
topics in RFID/NFC”. These lyrics represent the great memories the authors 
of this book have about Pavel’s visit, in both scientific and emotional 
aspects. They would like to celebrate the sincere and fruitful friendship 
between Yvan, Smail and Gianfranco, and await the possibility of many 
further joint projects! 
About the song 
The original version of “Le temps des fleurs” is a Russian romance song 
“Dorogoi dlinnoyu” (“Дорогой длинною”, literally “By the long road”), 
composed by Boris Fomin (1900–1948) with words by the poet Konstantin 
Podrevsky. Gene Raskin then adapted it into English and named it “Those 
Were the Days”, after which it was adapted to French and sung by Dalida. 

 
Introduction 
Since its early commercial application as an anti-theft system in 
supermarkets, the radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology has 
become a ubiquitous technology not only in industrial or agricultural areas 
but also in our daily lives, for instance our car key or access badge. Being 
able to identify a person, an animal, an object and even hundreds of objects 
simultaneously has opened up many other applications such as indoor 
localization and tracking, and further applications involving integration of 
sensors with RFID. As with the most popular wireless technologies, such as 
Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or NFC, passive ultra-high-frequency (UHF) RFID has 
rapidly grown thanks to the standards but also the promotion by industrial 
organizations such as RAIN RFID Alliance. Nowadays, passive UHF RFID 
is reliable and technologically and economically lucrative. Although based 
on relatively simple concepts compared to other wireless technologies using 
multiple antennas or complex modulations, RFID offers many degrees of 
liberty that allow the opening of new perspectives and very promising 
applications. With the idea of preserving devices as simply as possible and 
enabling the identification of something or somebody, the latest 
technological 
achievements 
in 
terms 
of 
low-power 
consumption 
microelectronics along with the exploitation of signal properties not yet used 
today allow important enhancements in the performance of the RFID system. 
These improvements include longer read ranges, accurate inventories with 
high density of tags, data rate and security, which are used in increasingly 
harsh environments. In parallel, continuous innovation has launched RFID 
technology as the Internet enabler dedicated to the last meters of tagged 
things. We can say that the simple backscattering modulation principle has 
set the path for an open road; the RFID revolution has begun. 

xii     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
In this context, this book focuses on the exploitation of the harmonic 
signals that are generated by RFID chips in compliance with the passive 
UHF RFID standard. Even if the topic is all based on RFID, the concepts 
introduced may also find applications in other fields as long as harmonic 
signals are present. Chapter 1 introduces RFID technology and its history. It 
provides the details about current perspectives and expectations in this field. 
Chapter 2 summarizes the technical fundamentals of the RFID technology 
and highlights the non-linear circuits present in passive RFID chips and the 
source of so far “wasted” signals, i.e. harmonic signals existing but not yet 
used. Chapter 3 presents recent and innovative experimental methods to 
characterize RFID tags and chips, which provide information about the 
production of 
these 
harmonic 
signals 
during 
a 
standard 
RFID 
communication. Chapter 4 presents theoretical approaches that model and 
analyze the observed non-linear behavior source of harmonic generation. 
The study can be used to minimize the “naturally” harmonic signals 
transmitted by commercial passive UHF RFID tags. On the contrary, in 
Chapter 5, applications and associated prototypes demonstrate that these 
unwanted signals can become either an information source with a harmonic 
tag or an energy source.

History of Radio-frequency Identification: 
from Birth to Advanced Applications 
Whether we are aware of it or not, RFID (radio-frequency identification) 
technology is an integral part of our everyday life. The RFID concept was 
anticipated a century ago, and nowadays it continues to advance as 
technology progresses and rapidly evolves to have more impact on our 
modern societies. The objective of this chapter is to give an account of the 
development of RFID from its birth to the present day. 
1.1. Early facts about the genesis of RFID 
The US patent 17744036, first filled in France in 1924 [BRA 30], was 
certainly one of the very first, if not the first, documents that described the 
concept of RFID technology. The patent describes the novelty as follows: 
“The primary station comprises a source of oscillations and an emitting 
circuit; the secondary has a receiving circuit with no local energy source, 
and in which is inserted a manipulating or modulating device (telephonic or 
telegraphic apparatus)”. This is no more than the principle of the RFID 
technology that exploits the reflected waves in order to ensure the 
communication between two devices: one of them is fully passive (the tag or 
the transponder) as it does not embed any energy source; however, it 
converts part of the signal sent by the other device (the reader or the 
interrogator) to modulate the refection towards the reader.

2     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
Two decades before this patent publication, H. Hertz noted that 
electromagnetic waves were reflected by metallic objects, even if he did not 
apply this insight in a practical engineering sense as done by others.  
G. Marconi was the first to show that these waves could be used for 
communication and also noted that radio waves were being reflected back to 
the transmitter by objects in radio beacon experiments that he conducted on 
March 3, 1899 on Salisbury Plain. Radar applications had just been born and 
their evolution from then will not cease and will be one of the powerful 
engines of RF (radio frequency) development and wireless applications.  
In 1904, C. Hülsmeyer [HUE 06] gave public demonstrations in Germany 
and the Netherlands of the use of radio echoes to detect ships so that 
collisions could be avoided. Moreover, in 1915, R. Watson-Watt joined the 
Meteorological Office as a meteorologist at Aldershot in Hampshire; over 
the next few years, he studied atmospheric phenomena and developed the 
use of radio signals generated by lightning strikes to map out the position of 
thunderstorms. Later, in the 1930s, the emergence of the radar system and its 
very rapid adoption by the military during World War II pushed engineers to 
explore the high-frequency domain and to master various techniques for 
signal generation, propagation and detection as well as broadcast. In 1935, 
H. E. Hollmann wrote one of the first comprehensive books on microwaves 
and applications. The book was titled “Physics and Technique of Ultrashort 
Waves”. This book was used throughout many parts of the world, which 
favored the development of radar technology in many countries. 
1.2. Birth of RFID 
Although there is no logical progression to RFID technology and often 
key advances are not recognized until later, developments in radar and 
broadcasting have evidently profited RFID. Among the variety of historical 
facts that paved the way for the emergence of modern RFID, two major 
events can be considered as the cornerstones. The first is a theoretical paper 
that very precisely addressed the physics behind the operating principle of 
RFID. This is the landmark paper published by H. Stockman, in the 
Proceedings of the IRE, October 1948. The paper was entitled 
“Communication by Means of Reflected Power”. Stockman stated in his 
paper that “Evidently, considerable research and development work has to be 
done before the remaining basic problems in reflected-power communication 
are solved, and before the field of useful applications is explored”. The 
second fact is more practical as it regards the design and application of a 

History of Radio-frequency Identification: from Birth to Advanced Applications     3 
device that is probably the first tag ever realized. Such a device was 
developed by L. Theremin, which was used as a passive wireless 
microphone for spying [NIK 12]. A schematic diagram of this device, known 
in the literature as “The Thing”, is shown in Figure 1.1. The Thing is 
composed of a metallic box that acts as an electromagnetic cavity with a 
specific resonance frequency coupled to a monopole antenna. To transform 
the device into a microphone, one wall of the cavity is replaced by a metallic 
vibrating membrane that is sensitive to sound waves. When the device is 
illuminated by an electromagnetic continuous wave at the resonance 
frequency of the system, a reflected signal (backscatter signal) at the same 
frequency is generated and can be detected with a dedicated system. If there 
is no sound, the amplitude of the backscatter signal will be constant. 
However, if some sound waves reach the vibrating membrane, the 
backscatter signal will be modulated by the sound and therefore detectable 
thanks to the simple envelope detector. As we can see, the system is so 
simple and its principle of operation is straightforward! The operation 
frequency was approximately 330 MHz. The beauty of the system lies in the 
fact that it had really been used and had worked for several years. Indeed, 
the device was embedded in a carved wooden plaque of the US Great Seal, 
and on August 4, 1945, Soviet school children presented it to the US 
ambassador as a “gesture of friendship”. It hung in the ambassador’s 
Moscow residential office and served to spy on the conversations of the 
ambassador for years. The existence of the bug was accidentally discovered 
by a British radio operator who overheard American conversations on an 
open radio channel as the Russians were beaming radio waves at the 
ambassador’s office. 
A third fact is often cited as part of the history of RFID. This is the IFF 
(Identify Friend or Foe) that was developed and exploited by the British 
during World War II [BRO 00]. The operating frequency of the system was 
in the range of 20–30 MHz. First, the system was passive and used wires 
across the wings of the airplane with open/closed operations controlled by 
motor relay to modulate the backscatter signal. Later, the system evolved 
into an active solution with amplifier and modern electronics. Nowadays, the 
IFF enables military and civilian air traffic control interrogation systems to 
identify aircraft and to determine their bearing and range from the 
interrogator.

and used as a wireless passive microphone. Left: the device as it  
was embedded in a carved wooden plaque of the US Great  
Seal. Right: the composition of “The Thing” 
Interestingly, the 1950s was the decade that explored the RFID techniques 
that emerged from the development of radar and broadcasting that took place 
in the two previous decades. Apart from the IFF, developments during the 
1950s included works such as that of D.B. Harris dedicated to “Radio 
transmission systems with modulable passive responder” [HAR 60].  
1.3. Early modern RFID 
During the 1960s, thanks to the advances in electronic technology, it was 
possible to develop the first commercial tag, i.e. the electronic article 
surveillance (EAS) tag. The first tags deployed in the 1960s were hard, 
round and plastic. These tags are based on the resonance properties of a 
simple LC tank circuit. The main application of EAS is to detect the 
presence or absence of the LC circuit thanks to its resonance when coupled 
to the sweep generator used as a reader. A schematic description of the EAS

system is given in Figure 1.2. The LC circuit that represents the EAS tag can 
be turned off if its capacitor is deactivated. Such a deactivation occurs when 
the reader sends an interrogation signal with a very large amplitude at the 
resonance frequency of the system. 
Figure 1.2. Description of the EAS system. The tag is primarily  
an LC circuit whose presence is detected by a reader  
which is primarily a sweep generator  
Since their introduction, EAS tags have undergone remarkable evolution 
thanks to the huge advances in electronic and microelectronic technologies. 
Although EAS tags were first developed for apparel retailers to avoid thefts, 
they have since been applied to a wider range of goods, such as books in 
libraries, video and music products, etc. Companies such as Sensormatic and 
Checkpoint were founded in the late 1960s which, with others, developed 
EAS equipment to counter theft. These types of systems are often known as 
“1-bit” tags, because only the presence or absence of a tag could be detected. 
The first EAS tags introduced in the 1960s were rigid and quite big. In the 
1980s, the tags became smaller and soft so that they could be attached with 
adhesive backs, as well as deactivated at the sale store. Later, in the 1990s,  
 
 

6     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
the tags could be sewn into or heat-sealed onto items of clothing at the 
manufacture point [DIL 15]. Therefore, EAS tags have become the most 
commonly used article surveillance and anti-theft technique. They are 
boosted by more and more cheap integration technologies, and can be made 
inexpensively and serve as an effective anti-theft system. Examples of EAS 
tags are shown in Figure 1.3. 
Figure 1.3. Examples of EAS tags. We clearly see the magnetic loop  
connected to the chip capacitor to form the LC resonant tank circuit.  
Typical operation frequencies are in the range of 1.75 MHz to 9.5 MHz  
band. The standard frequency for retail use is 8.2 MHz 
As far as the physics behind RFID is considered, the 1960s was the 
prelude to several very consistent theoretical publications and practical 
demonstrations and inventions [LAN 05]. Among the major contributions 
are those of R. F. Harrington who studied the electromagnetic theory related 
to RFID, which was published in his papers “Field measurements using 
active scatterers” and “Theory of loaded scatterers” in 1963–1964. 
Regarding the inventions, R. Richardson developed “Remotely activated 
radio frequency powered devices” in 1963, O. Rittenback introduced 
“Communication by radar beams” in 1969, J. H. Vogelman demonstrated 
“Passive data transmission techniques utilizing radar beams” in 1968 and J. 
P. Vinding performed “Interrogator–responder identification system” in 
1967. These theoretical contributions and practical advances in the 
developments of radar and broadcast profited the birth of modern RFID and 
its large and very rapid adoption.

1.4. The 1970s: the infancy age of RFID 
The 1970s was probably the infancy age of RFID development. 
Universities, research centers and companies were very actively working on 
many aspects of RFID that overlapped with integration technologies, RF 
solutions, communications and a large diversity of application scenarios. 
One of the most salient advances is the work developed at the Los Alamos 
Scientific Laboratory dedicated to “Short-range radio-telemetry for 
electronic identification using modulated backscatter” that was demonstrated 
in 1975 by A. Koelle, S. Depp and R. Freyman. In 1971, M. Cardullo 
demonstrated a passive radio transponder with 16-bit memory that was 
presented to the New York Port Authority and patented two years later (US 
Patent 3,713,148 in 1973). The patent of Cardullo was applicable for RF, 
sounds and light. The business model could be used in numerous 
applications such as car ID, toll, banking, credit cards, security, access 
control and medical surveillance. The Port Authorities of New York and 
New Jersey also tested systems for transportation developed by companies 
such as General Electric, Westinghouse, Philips and Glenayre. Although the 
tests provided positive results, the first commercially successful 
transportation application of RFID, electronic toll collection, was not yet 
ready [LAN 05]. During the same period, several companies developed 
RFID devices such as Raytheon’s “Raytag” in 1973. RCA and Fairchild 
were active in several developments. R. Klensch from RCA developed an 
“Electronic identification system” in 1975, and F. Sterzer also from RCA 
developed an “Electronic license plate for motor vehicles” in 1977. 
Furthermore, T. Meyers and A. Leigh from Fairchild developed a “Passive 
encoding microwave transponder” in 1978 [LAN 05].  
It appears that the 1970s were characterized primarily by the exploration 
of several implementations of RFID in real different scenarios and 
applications. Most of the investigated solutions were considered in 
applications such as animal tracking, vehicle identification as well as factory 
automation. Animal tagging was the major interest in Europe. However, due 
to the electromagnetic characteristics of biological tissues (very high 
permittivity and high losses), it was possible to implement only inductive 
systems. Examples of tags implanted into pets are shown in Figure 1.4. 
During the same decade, transport applications exploited the work on 
microwave systems developed at Los Alamos and by the International 
Bridge Turnpike and Tunnel Association (IBTTA) and the United States 
Federal Highway Administration. In the late 1970s, new applications began 

8     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
to appear and the number of interested companies, individuals and 
institutions working on RFID began to increase very rapidly. The potential 
of RFID technologies and the benefit they provided in terms of application 
monitoring as well as return on investment became obvious. 
Figure 1.4. Examples of implanted tags for pet tracking. These tags  
are based on inductive systems at LF (low-frequency) and HF  
(high-frequency) bands to take into account the electromagnetic  
characteristics of biological tissues 
1.5. The 1980s and 1990s: implementation of RFID 
The very practical developments initiated in the 1970s continued to 
progress in the 1980s and the interest in RFID technology rapidly grew in 
various regions of the world. While in the United States, the major interest 
was in the transportation systems and access control; in Europe, the major 
applications included short-range systems for animals, industrial and 
business applications. Also, toll roads in some European countries were 
equipped with RFID solutions. The first commercial application for 
collecting tolls began in Norway in 1987 and was followed quickly by the 
Dallas North Turnpike in the United States in 1989. So RFID became a more 
profitable technology and a large number of new players arrived at this very 
rapidly evolving market. 
 

History of Radio-frequency Identification: from Birth to Advanced Applications     9 
The 1990s was a significant decade for RFID implementation, 
particularly in tolls and transportation systems in many countries around the 
world. Some of these implementations integrate real innovations. Among the 
significant innovations was the one introduced in the northeastern United 
States, where seven regional toll agencies formed the E-Z Pass Interagency 
Group (IAG) in 1990 to develop a regionally compatible system for toll 
collection based on RFID solutions. Such a system allows the use of a single 
tag and single billing account per vehicle to access highways of several toll 
authorities. Another remarkable innovation, the toll system of the highway 
which was opened in Oklahoma in 1991, allows vehicles to pass collection 
portals at highway speeds. A combined toll collection and traffic 
management system was installed in the Houston area in 1992. Later on, 
tolling and rail applications also began to appear in many countries including 
China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, 
South Korea, Australia, South Africa and various countries in Europe. 
In the automobile sector, a remarkable application was the development 
of the Texas Instruments (TI) TIRIS system, which was used for the control 
of vehicle engines. The application of the TIRIS system was further 
extended to dispensing fuel, gaming chips, ski passes, vehicle access and  
so on. 
During the 1990s, several European countries were actively developing 
RFID technologies at both hardware and application levels. In particular, 
semiconductor companies were active in the development of RFID  
circuits. Companies such as Philips (now NXP), Electronic Marin and ST-
Microelectronics proposed RFID chips for LF, HF and UHF bands. During 
this decade, European countries paid more attention to the implementation of 
innovative RFID solutions. Special interest was focused on both RF and 
inductive technologies, in particular, for toll collection, access control and e-
commerce. Europe became very active in the RFID market with 
developments including Alcatel, Bosch, STMicroelectronics and Philips. A 
pan-European standard was necessary for tolling applications in Europe, and 
many of these companies were working on the CEN standard for electronic 
tolling. Some examples of toll tags are shown in Figure 1.5. 

10     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
Figure 1.5. Examples of tags for toll applications. Toll tags are based  
on RF technologies and in most cases are powered by a battery 
1.6. RFID chip age 
Until the 1990s, RFID tags were composed of a PCB (printed circuit 
board) that contained electronic devices including a memory and antenna to 
ensure the wireless communication with the reader. Figure 1.6 shows some 
tags based on the PCB. Research and development in microelectronics and 
computer science did not slow down during the 1990s, and remarkable 
technological advances were accomplished that would benefit RFID. Indeed, 
for the first time, useful microwave Schottky diodes were fabricated on a 
regular CMOS integrated circuit. This advance in technology is a very 
important step because one of the major RFID circuit blocks is the rectifier 
that converts the RF in the interrogation signal into DC voltage to power up 
the RFID circuitry. Thus, it becomes possible to integrate all the 
functionalities of the RFID circuit in the same chip. This development 
allowed the construction of very compact RFID tags that contained only a 
single integrated circuit, a capability previously limited to inductively 
coupled RFID transponders. Large companies that were active in this 
evolution were IBM, Micron, Philips, STMicroelectronics and many other 
spin-offs.

Figure 1.6. Evolution of tags from the PCB circuit to the RFID chip.  
First tags used PCB and a suitable external package. Actual tags  
with reduced size have a label format with only two elements:  
RFID chip and antenna 
With the growing interest in RFID with respect to asset management and 
item traceability, and the opportunity for RFID to potentially positively 
substitute the barcode, it becomes difficult in the later part of this decade to 
count the number of companies who have entered the RFID market and 
developed many application scenarios. 
1.7. Maturation of RFID 
Integration technologies continued to rapidly advance at the beginning of 
the 21st Century, and some remarkable RFID chips were proposed by major 
companies. One of the most significant examples of technological process 
was the microchip developed by Hitachi, as shown in Figure 1.7. 

12     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
Figure 1.7. The microchip developed by Hitachi. Known also as “Powder” or  
“Dust”, these chips consist of 128-bit ROM (read-only memory) that can store a  
32-digit number. They can be integrated into very thin substrates like paper  
and notes. Microchips may also have advanced applications such as “smartdust” 
This chip has a very limited size of 0.4 × 0.4 mm2 and operates at the 
ISM (Industrial, Scientific and Medical) band of 2.45GHz. It exhibits 128-bit 
ROM. It is batteryless, decodes its microchip ID and transmits it back, and 
each µ-chip stores a unique 128-bit ID. The µ-chip has a read range of 25 cm 
with an external antenna. This evolution in terms of integration capabilities 
allows the building of tags with only two components: a single CMOS 
integrated circuit and an antenna. This development allows a reduction in the 
size of circuitry and the cost of tags, and an increase in functionality and 
reliability. Therefore, tags have become sticky labels that can be easily 
attached to objects to be managed somewhat similarly to the optical barcode. 
This similarity has pushed several research projects and partnerships 
between universities and companies to consider the adoption of RFID as a 
smart and better solution for traceability and logistics compared with the 
optical barcode. More recently, Hitachi has developed the world’s smallest 
and thinnest RFID chip. Measuring only 0.15 × 0.15 millimeters in size and  
7.5 micrometers thick, the wireless chip is a smaller version of the previous 
record. The new chip has a wide range of applications, from transportation 
and logistics to military and even consumer electronics. 
 
 

History of Radio-frequency Identification: from Birth to Advanced Applications     13 
The other salient example that remarkably illustrates the decisive 
advances in technology and new capabilities offered by RFID is the 
implanted tag introduced by VeriChip Corp, as shown in Figure 1.8. 
 
Figure 1.8. Implanted tags developed by VeriChip Corp. The tag consists of an RFID 
microchip, a capacitor and a loop antenna wrapped around a ferrite core. It is 
enclosed in medical-compliant glass and coated in a substance called Biobond to 
avoid the migration of the tag within the body. The implant has the size of a grain  
of rice 
This is a 134.2 kHz RFID chip that can save lives and possibly limit 
injuries resulting from errors in medical treatments, as claimed by VeriChip 
[SID 17]. It received FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) approval in 
2004. VeriChip suggests that the chip can be inserted in the rear part of the 
triceps of the right arm under the skin. According to VeriChip, the chip does 
not contain any medical records, but its 16-digit number could be linked to a 
database of patient medical information. When the tag is scanned, the 
number can be quickly cross-referenced to reveal specific medical data about 
the patient. The tags are similar to those being embedded in livestock and 
pets as an effective solution to tracking the mad cow health condition. 
 
 
 

14     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
Apart from the previous remarkable examples of the technology outcome, 
technological development allows a reduction in the size of circuitry and the 
cost of tags. In addition to the RFID tag hardware, signal processing 
techniques and computer science allow the expansion of RFID 
functionalities and its widespread use in thousands of applications. Supply 
chain management and article tracking are the application areas of RFID that 
have grown rapidly. The dedicated facility Auto-ID center has been set up 
and organized at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to bring together 
RFID manufacturers, researchers and users to develop standards, perform 
research and share information, in particular, for supply chain applications. 
EPC Global has assumed the task of standards for this application area. The 
International Standards Organization (ISO) also has very active standard 
activities for a variety of application areas. Auto-ID evolved into Auto-ID 
Labs in 2003, the same year in which EPC Global was established. The 
standard adoption is at the origin of the interoperability of products from 
different manufacturers, which results in increased compatibility, better 
performance and improved reliability of UHF RFID systems. Later, global 
standards, such as EPC Class 1 Gen2, encouraged major organizations, such 
as Walmart, Tesco, the US Department of Defense in the USA Decathlon, 
Inditex and Uniqlo, among other big retailers worldwide, to request their 
suppliers to become strictly RFID compliant with all their products. In the 
2010s, major companies such as Macy’s, Hudson’s Bay Company, Marco 
Polo and a number of others turned the RFID technology into a commodity, 
especially in retail and industrial applications. Today, it is certain that there 
is no stopping RFID. It has already become an important part of our 
everyday life that enables many applications such as ticketing, e-papers, 
payments and access control. 
The full potential of RFID is also being realized in other areas such as 
application software, development of privacy policies and other legal 
aspects. Besides, now that RFID has truly entered the mainstream, the 
development of the supporting infrastructure to design, install and maintain 
RFID systems is of high importance. As a matter of fact, the choice of a tag 
for a specific application first requires the definition of a set of parameters 
and criteria, and then it will introduce the infrastructure to enable the

application. Figure 1.9 gives a possible classification of RFID tags using 
different parameters. 
Figure 1.9. Classification of RFID tags following different parameters.  
Several duties should be considered when selecting a tag category  
for an application. Due to their low cost, batteryless feature and long  
read range, passive UHF tags are very often selected 
1.8. Internet of Things: the next RFID frontier 
RFID technology is a well-established technology that has been 
implemented in thousands of applications worldwide. One of the decisive 
advantages that RFID guarantees to its potential users is perhaps its 
standardized character which is of great importance. This standardization 
allows the interoperability between RFID devices from different 
manufacturers and geographical regions. Moreover, the passive feature of 
RFID tags is also very effective in terms of application reliability and the 
quasi-unlimited lifetime of tags. As pointed out in Figure 1.9, there are 
several categories of tags to fit the criteria and specific needs of certain 
applications. The most exploited categories of tags are reported in Table 1.1, 
which correspond to passive tags. 

16     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
Table 1.1. The most exploited tag categories. These tags are passive devices  
that can be used for short range (less than 1 m) and long range (up to 28 m). 
Depending on the constraints of an application, the tags can be inserted into a 
suitable package before their attachment or integration to the item to be tracked 
While the frequency bands for LF and HF tags are the same worldwide, it 
is not the same for the UHF band. Indeed, there are three different bands: 
866–868 MHz, mostly used in Europe and Africa; 902–928 MHz, mostly 
used in the Americas and some countries in Asia; and 950–956 MHz, mostly 
used in the Asia-Pacific region. Due to its long read range of several meters, 
several research programs and technology developments have been 
dedicated to RFID at the UHF band. Since the very first RFID chip with a 
sensitivity of -8 dBm introduced at the end of the 1990s, the pace of 
developments in chip sensitivity has continued to progress. Indeed, a gain of 
more than 10 dB has been achieved. Table 1.2 provides the progress of chip 
sensitivity during the last decades. It is remarkable to see that the actual read 
range of 28 m is quite comfortable for the majority of indoor applications.

Tags can now be used in a variety of applications and domains such as 
traceability, logistics and access control. They have become ubiquitous in 
industry and our daily life (ticketing, payment, passports, car keys, etc.).  
It is also being largely implemented in the area of health (smart  
hospital), personal assistance and anti-counterfeiting [DUR 18]. RFID is a 
standardized technology with inherent advantages of standardization, 
identification, wireless communication and low cost of tags, thereby 
providing decisive practical benefits that drive new developments in terms of 
concepts and applications. However, in all these applications, the major duty 
of the tag is to provide the ID and achieve the identification only. The 
perspective of RFID in terms of new paradigms for distributed ambient 
intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly considered  
by many universities and industries. The future looks very promising  
for this technology. The full potential also requires advancements in  
the evolution of the RFID tag to provide more than just identification. 
Passive UHF tags using chips that require only –23 dBm for activation 
exhibit read ranges of more than 28 meters. They should allow the 
implementation of the last few meters of the IoT. To do so, the tags  
 
 

18     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
must be expanded in terms of functionalities, in particular sensing. The 
transformation of RFID tags into sensors is very effective in terms of 
wireless sensor networks. Indeed, the use of the standardized RFID 
communication protocol will allow the designers to exploit the normalized 
RFID commands to define new commands more specific to the sensing 
capability of the transformed tag. Moreover, like any other sensor, the 
calibration of the device is an important and critical issue. Such an objective 
can be reached by the association of some reference devices that provide 
correction signals to the interrogation system [MAR 10]. All these tasks will 
become possible if the cost of tags is low and the interrogation system is 
enriched and updated by additional commands to collect the sensed 
parameters. 
There are several ways to transform an UHF RFID tag into a RFID 
sensor [TED 16]. They can be grouped into three categories. The first one 
will exploit the sensitivity of the tag antenna to the physical change that 
appears in its near-field region. The second category is more related to the 
behavior of the RFID chip and the variation of its electrical response as a 
function of some external parameters such as RF power and temperature. 
The third category consists of the integration of an external sensor to the 
RFID chip. It should be noted that the matching between the tag antenna and 
the RFID chip is the most relevant parameter that governs the performance 
of RFID tags, in particular the read range. Once the impedance states of the 
RFID chip are known, the designer should optimize the tag performance by 
properly choosing the antenna impedance that corresponds to a certain 
antenna topology on a well-defined support. Changing anything in the 
antenna topology, or in its immediate vicinity (near-field region), will turn 
into a measurable change in the performance of the tag-to-reader 
communication. This change can be observed in several communication 
parameters such as activation power of the tag, read range, frequency tuning, 
phase rotation and group delay. In the literature, several attempts and 
examples have been reported to design RFID sensors by exploiting this 
concept [TED 16]. The exploitation of the perturbation of the tag antenna by 
a metal plate to measure the inflexion of a bridge has been demonstrated. 
Sensing could also be achieved by adding a highly sensitive material to the 
antenna; that is, by adding carbon nanotubes (CNT), the gas concentration 
can be sensed. However, the exploitation of these RFID sensors in real 
applications has not been discussed much in the literature. Most of the  
 
 

History of Radio-frequency Identification: from Birth to Advanced Applications     19 
published papers have focused on the concept of the device and restricted 
their study to validating the proposed structure by some experiments to 
demonstrate the effective variation of the backscatter signal with the sensed 
parameters. A real application was proposed in [SON 13]. It explained  
the transformation of an UHF RFID tag to detect the contamination of meat. 
The proposed device exploited the evolution of the permittivity of meat  
as a function of time. So, the measured RSSI was time dependent, 
corresponding to approximately 72 hours, which was considered as the 
optimal contamination time. 
The RFID chip ensures several tasks; in particular, it scavenges wireless 
power from the reader and generates the DC voltage to empower the chip 
circuitry. Intensive work is dedicated to the optimization of chip 
characteristics in order to realize new functions of RFID tags. Energy 
harvesting for external sensors and channel diversity are among the most 
interesting capabilities. These two features are mainly governed by the non-
linear behavior of RFID tags, which is primarily dependent on the 
characteristic of the scavenging section of the RFID chip. Spectral analysis 
and measurement of real backscatter signals demonstrated the existence of 
spectral components at the second and third harmonics of fundamental 
frequency. The exploitation of non-linear characteristics in the context of 
wireless communication was considered for localization applications in 
[HUG 09]. In RFID technology, the exploitation of such non-linear behavior 
opens the door to diverse new functions that can be easily integrated into the 
tag, especially by adapting the design of the tag antenna. This concept will 
be discussed in the following chapters. 
1.9. Summary 
In the 2010s, major companies turned RFID technology into a 
commodity, especially in retail and industrial applications. It has already 
become a part of our everyday life, and we use it without knowing that. In 
2014, Smartrac, Impinj, Google and Intel joined forces to establish the RAIN 
alliance. The main objective of this alliance, announced in April 2014, is to 
boost the global adoption of UHF RFID technology, in order to promote 
awareness, increase education and support the universal adoption of UHF 
RFID technology. The members of the RAIN alliance are manufacturers,  
 
 

20     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
distributors, resellers and researchers who work with the EPC Gen2 UHF 
RFID specification, incorporated into the ISO/IEC 18000-6C standard. 
RAIN RFID is a wireless technology that connects billions of everyday 
items to the Internet, enabling businesses and consumers to identify, locate, 
authenticate and engage each item. On top of these advances, augmented 
tags are highly necessary. Exploiting the characteristics of the non-linear 
RFID chip is one of several ways to transform tags into augmented tags, 
providing the identification more surely. 
At first glance, the concept of RFID and its application seems simple and 
straightforward. However, in reality, the opposite is true. Indeed, RFID is a 
solution that needs plenty of technologies, from systems engineering and 
software development to materials technology and mechanics. Other 
domains, such as microelectronics, circuit theory, antenna theory, radio 
propagation encryption and network engineering, are also necessary. The 
number of engineers involved in the development and application of RFID is 
increasing rapidly. This evolution will most likely continue to increase, 
allowing RFID to have a bright future.

RFID Technology: Main Principles and 
Non-linear Behavior of Tags 
The objective of this chapter is to remind us of the principles of RFID 
technology with a focus on passive UHF RFID. It also details RFID studies and 
applications based on harmonic generation and non-linear behaviors. 
2.1. RFID: a multilayer vision 
RFID (radio-frequency identification) technology is a wireless data 
collection technology that is widely used in many applications and services 
such as logistics, manufacturing, access control and security, both in 
industrial and private environments [KLA 03, DOB 08, DOM 10]. 
Nowadays, the scope of passive RFID technology is not only limited to 
identification because tags are equipped with new capabilities that open the 
field for new applications dedicated to switching, monitoring and/or 
controlling purposes. Thus, the type of RFID applications is strongly 
evolving, for instance with tags capable of sensing environmental and human 
body parameters [MAR 10, NAZ 12, YVA 12], or tags able to communicate 
and share information with other tags [NIK 12]. A meaningful indicator of 
this trend is the amount of research efforts made to study and present RFID 
technology as one of the frontrunners in the new paradigm of the Internet of 
Things (IoT) [LAN 08]. 
RFID technology and its evolution can be better explained by placing 
each of its technical components in a modular and multilayer stack model, as 
shown in Figure 2.1. The multilayer model uses the Open Systems

Interconnection (OSI) terms and is compatible with the ISO 18000-1  
[ISO 15]. It provides parameter definitions for globally accepted frequencies 
in RFID [ISO 12] and is also valid for positioning emerging RFID 
technologies such as chipless RFID in where the basic identifier is obtained 
from the electromagnetic signature of a resonator without a silicon chip 
[PRE 09, TED 13]. The model is composed of three layers: the application 
layer, the communication layer and the physical layer [GIL 05]. 
Figure 2.1. Air interface protocol stack 
The application layer represents information to be handled by the user. 
This could be an identifier set as the filter in the reader, which will allow the 
detection of a specific tag whose information can be read or written into a 
database (e.g. the title of a book). In this layer, protocols and rules for end-
user software tools are positioned. In the case of the chipless RFID system, 
the rules that format the information obtained from the translation of signal 
processing into exploitable end-user data could be defined here. 
The communication layer represents the protocols that rule the 
communication between the reader and the tag. Collision avoidance 
protocols are defined in this layer. When drawing an analogy with a chipless 
RFID system, given the absence of smart components on the chipless tag, 
the basic definitions of collision avoidance could be split into its physical 
and application layers.  
The physical layer represents the air interface (i.e. frequency, operating 
channels, modulation, data encoding, timings and bit rate), circuit connections, 
powering, signal strengths, chip architecture (for readers and tags), structural 
connections (between the antenna and the chip), structural shapes (responsible 
for the radio frequency signature in chipless RFID), resonances and

polarization. The features of this layer define whether the tags work in  
the LF (low-frequency), HF (high-frequency), UHF (ultra high-frequency) or 
microwave band, and also determine its linked protocols in upper layers. 
Regardless of the frequency band, most RFID systems only use a few kHz to 
MHz of bandwidth and are thus classical narrow band systems. 
The EPC Global Class-1 Gen-2 UHF RFID standard (ISO 18000-6) defines 
the operations that rule the communication between reader and tag. Indeed, its 
scope covers the above explained three layers of the protocol stack.  
For instance in the physical layer, the standard defines the radar cross 
section and read range based on link frequencies, antennas gain, polarization, 
free space path loss, etc. 
In the communication layer, the standard defines the reader-talk-first 
sequence of messages, the coding mechanisms (which determine the data 
rate or bit duration) and also the anticolision mechanism based on the 
ALOHA algorithm. 
The evolution of the standard from version 1 (Gen2V1) to version 2 
(Gen2V2) in 2014 have pushed manufacturers to add new functionalities to 
the chip such as crypto-security or file management. These new functionlities 
will trend to fill the application layer of the proposed protocol stack model. 
Following the multilayer RFID model, this chapter is concerned with the 
physical and communication layers of the EPC Global Class-1 Gen-2 UHF 
RFID standard, with a focus on RFID chips. It mainly deals with the effects 
intrinsically produced in consequence of the non-linear behavior of RFID 
chips. In order to unfold the features presented in the following chapters, the 
next two sections will break down the theory and definitions of passive UHF 
RFID and non-linear RF networks. 
2.2. Focus on passive UHF RFID technology 
2.2.1. Working principle 
In passive UHF RFID, tags that are compliant with the EPC Global 
Class-1 Gen-2 standard (adopted as ISO 18000-6C), do not have an  
 
 

24     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
autonomous energy source like a battery, but obtain it via electromagnetic 
fields transmitted by the reader. The general working principle of passive 
UHF RFID systems is shown in Figure 2.2. The reader generates a carrier 
wave that is transmitted by the reader antenna. Reader antennas are typically 
directive, i.e. they only illuminate a certain volume, called the read zone. If a 
tag is inside this read zone, the power transmitted by the reader activates this 
tag and makes it ready to receive commands. The EPC Global Class-1 Gen-2 
is a reader talks-first protocol, i.e. the tags wait until they are addressed. On 
receiving a command transmitted by modulating the carrier wave (CW), the 
tag sends its identification code or parts of its memory. The tag does not  
actively transmit this data, but reflects part of the incident reader carrier 
wave by deliberately de-tuning its own antenna that generates two different 
radar cross sections (RCS), as shown in Figure 2.2. This principle of 
modulating the reflected power is known as backscatter modulation [NIK 06].

2.2.2. Reader 
Based on its design and the technology used, the RFID reader (also called 
the interrogator) may be a reader-only or a reader- and writer-device. A 
practical example is shown in Figure 2.3. A reader typically contains a radio 
frequency module (transmitter and receiver), a control unit and a coupling 
element with the tag (i.e. the reader antenna). In addition, many readers are 
fitted with an additional interface (e.g. Ethernet, RS-232) to enable them to 
forward the data received by another system (e.g. PC, robot control system).

2.2.3. Tag 
With regard to the aimed application, there is a multitude of tags with 
different shapes and sizes. However, a common denominator is that all of 
them are composed of three main components: (i) the substrate or cover 
support (i.e. the antenna cover or support); (ii) the antenna itself whose 
choice depends largely on the application environment (in terms of both 
ergonomics and performance); (iii) a dedicated chip (integrating basic 
processing functions, memory, and lately sensor and security capabilities 
[WIR 17, UCO]). They are collectively called the RFID tag, label or inlay. 
2.2.3.1. Tag antenna 
Tag antennas used for most applications in UHF RFID systems consist of 
a printed or etched metal surface on top of a thin and flexible sheet of plastic 
or paper. Tags are often equipped with an adhesive film that can be attached 
to flat surfaces. Many shapes of such antennas can be found, but technically 
most of them are dipole antennas which have meandered conductors and a 
widened metallization at dipole ends that function as an end capacitance 
[MAR 08]. This technique allows the sizing down of the antenna compared 
to the half-wavelength dipole antenna. Tags based on dipole structures are 
linearly polarized with an omnidirectional radiation pattern in one plane. To 
match the impedance of shortened dipole antennas with the input impedance 
of the chip, several techniques have been proposed. The most common 
technique is a inductively coupled loop or slit implemented in the center of 
the dipole [DAT 12]. The length of such antennas ranges between 5 cm and 
15 cm. For even smaller tags, a metallization in the form of a loop is used. 

26     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
An innovation in tag side was introduced in 2017. It consists of embedding a 
slender passive RFID tag in a textile yarn, which is called the RFID yarn. A 
gamma-match 
impedance 
matching 
technique 
ensures 
the 
sound 
performance of the RFID yarn in terms of read range and bandwidth, 
maintaining a slender geometry [AND 17]. This new form of yarn allows the 
RFID tag to be embedded in different objects and easily conformed to 
different shapes. This shows passive RFID’s potential in connecting objects, 
for example in smart textiles, wearables and industrial automatization. 
From an application point of view, tag antennas can be considered the 
strategic point in the radio transmission chain of an RFID system. Except for 
the RFID yarn, it is preferable if they are shortened, which inevitably comes 
at the cost of low bandwidth and poor radiation efficiency. Furthermore, they 
are attached to objects that may contain fluids, metal, dielectric materials or 
materials with high dielectric losses. Such objects often require specialized 
antenna designs or may even need a radome to ensure a distance around the 
tag. The reason for this is that electrically small antennas are more prone to 
proximity effects. Materials in the proximity of the tag antenna cause a shift 
in center frequency and input impedance, often referred to as de-tuning 
[DOB 15]. This effect impairs the matching between the tag antenna and the 
chip, which, in turn, reduces the power available to operate the digital 
circuits of the chip. Moreover, lossy materials in the proximity of the 
antenna will absorb power. Figure 2.4 shows a parametric study of the RFID 
tag reflection coefficient when varying its distance to a metal plate. There 
are drastic changes in the electrical behavior of the antenna when the tag gets 
closer to the metal plate. Therefore, proximity effects due to tagged objects 
on tag performance should be considered in the antenna design process for 
each application case. 
However, with the objective of providing a multi-standard operation, for 
instance HF RFID combined with UHF RFID, UHF-Europe (866–868 MHz) 
with UHF-USA (902–928 MHz), UHF RFID with microwave RFID  
(2.45 GHz and 5.2 GHz) or UHF RFID with NFC, the RFID tag antenna 
(and also the reader antenna) can be dual band antennas. A multiband 
operation can be achieved in a traditional way by using several resonant 
elements, such as PIFA structures [HIR 06], slot antennas [JEO 06, MIN 
10], multilayer configuration [MOB 10], spiral coils [LON 12, MAY 08, 
PAR 10] or asymmetric folding dipole [MAL 11]. It should be noted that all 
dual band tag antennas for HF–UHF bands or UHF–microwave are proposed

in a claimed scenery of a multi-standard RFID operation that does not exist 
yet. In this scenery, one chip is expected to be able to support more than one 
protocol of communication. Some patents have already protected this idea 
[MAY 12] and, for instance, the commercial chip EM4423 of EM 
Microelectronic contactless devices brings innovative features to the NFC 
and EPCTM worlds.

field transmitted by the reader. The RF energy radiated by the reader is used 
to both supply the digital section of the tag and allow data transmission from 
the tag to the reader by modulating the backscattered radiation [DEV 05]. 
The architecture of a passive UHF RFID tag is shown in Figure 2.5. The 
coupling element is an antenna, which is typically a dipole. An impedance 
matching network between the antenna and the RFID chip ensures the 
maximum power transfer between the two elements in one of the impedance 
states of the chip. A rectifier circuit converts the input alternating voltage 
into a DC voltage, which is used by a series voltage regulator to provide the 
required regulated voltage for the correct operation of the tag. The 
architecture of the rectifier is based on a Cockcroft–Walton circuit with two 
or more diode-based voltage doubler stages. These diodes determine the 
non-linear behavior of the chip [DEV 05, BOL 10]. An ASK demodulator is 
primarily composed of a peak detector circuit. A backscatter modulator is 
used to modulate the impedance seen by the antenna during transmission. 
The RF section is connected to a digital section, which is typically a finite-
state machine able to manage the communication protocol. 
Note that the theoretical and practical aspects covered in this book mainly 
consider the RF sections of the passive RFID tag, i.e. the antenna, matching 
network and rectifier sections.

2.3. Non-linear RF networks and harmonic generation 
2.3.1. Effects of a non-linear device 
All realistic RF devices have at least small transmission losses. An ideal 
linear component does not exist in practice because all realistic devices are 
non-linear at very low signal levels due to noise effects. In addition, practical 
components may also become non-linear at high signal levels. In the case of 
active devices, such as diodes and transistors, this may be attributed to 
effects such as gain compression or the generation of spurious frequency 
components due to device non-linearities, but all devices ultimately fail at 
very high power levels. In either case, these effects set a minimum and 
maximum realistic power range, or a dynamic range, at which a given 
component or network will operate as desired [DAV 05]. It is  
this non-linearity that is of great utility for desirable functions such as 
amplification, detection and frequency conversion [HIN 84]. However,  
non-linear device characteristics can also lead to undesirable effects such as 
gain compression and the generation of spurious frequency components. 
These effects may further lead to increased losses, signal distortion and 
possible interference with other radio channels or services. Some of the 
many possible effects of non-linearity in RF and microwave are as follows  
[MAA 03]: harmonic generation (i.e. multiples of the fundamental signal), 
saturation (i.e. gain reduction in an amplifier), intermodulation distortion 
(i.e. products of a two-tone input signal), cross-modulation (i.e. modulation 
transfer from one signal to another), amplitude and phase conversion (i.e. 
amplitude variation causing a phase shift), spectral regrowth (i.e. 
intermodulation with many closely spaced signals).

Different functions can be obtained from the non-linear network 
depending on the dominance of particular terms in the expansion. The 
constant term, with coefficient ܽ଴, leads to rectification, converting an AC 
input signal to DC, which is the base of the powering technique in passive 
RFID tags. The linear term, with coefficient ܽଵ, models a linear attenuator 
when ܽଵ൏1, or an amplifier when ܽଵ൐1. The second-order term, with 
coefficient ܽଶ, can be used for mixing and other frequency conversion 
functions. 
Practical non-linear devices usually have a series expansion containing 
many non-zero terms, and there will be a combination of several of the 
above effects. In accordance with the topic of this book, the next section will 
pay special attention to harmonic generation phenomena. 
The traditional way of demonstrating how new frequencies are generated 
in a generic non-linear network (Figure 2.6) is to describe the behavior of the 
network by considering the case where a single-frequency sinusoid is 
applied to its input:

Consequently, it can be observed that a portion of the input signal at 
frequency ߱଴ is converted to other frequency components. For example, the 
first term represents a DC voltage, which can act as a useful response in a 
rectifier application. Voltage components at frequency 2߱଴ or 3߱଴ can be 
useful for frequency multiplier circuits. In specific devices (e.g. amplifiers), 
the presence of other frequency components will lead to signal distortion if 
those components are in the passband. For a single input frequency (or tone), 
߱଴, the output will generally consist of harmonics of the input frequency of 
the form nω଴, for ݊ൌ0, 1, 2, … . If these harmonics lie outside the passband 
of the device, then there will be no interference with the desired signal at 
frequency ߱଴. 
However, the situation is different when the input signal consists of two 
closely spaced frequencies [MAA 03]. The combination of two input 
frequencies applied to a non-linear network produces intermodulation 
products, which is the origin of intermodulation distortion. Let us assume a 
case in which a double-frequency composite signal is applied to its input:

Regarding the composition of different frequencies of the output signal of a 
non-linear network, several studies in antennas and circuits can be found in the 
literature [JAN 88, CAB 04, FON 82]. Some related works in the RFID field 
as well as in batteryless non-linear devices will be detailed in the next section. 
2.4. Non-linear behavior and associated applications in the RFID 
field 
2.4.1. Measurement of backscattered harmonics 
The first experimental characterization of harmonic scattering from passive 
UHF RFID tags was published in 2009 by P. V. Nikitin et al. [NIK 09]. With 
some limitations on equipment (e.g. activating and measuring the RFID tag at 
the same time), the authors analyzed the first radiated harmonics of three 
commercial tags: AD-222, AD-223 and AD-224 [AVE 09]. The objective of 
the study was to quantify the signal levels radiated at harmonic frequencies in 
order to determine whether they had an impact on other RF systems deployed 
in the same environment. 
The measurement setup used was the compact broadband GTEM 
(gigahertz transverse electromagnetic) cell TESCOM TC5060. Such cells are 
a type of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) test chamber used for 
radiated EMC testing (e.g. radiation or susceptibility testing). They allow the 
creation of a controlled uniform field at a desired location, without 
considering the frequency-dependent responses of the transmitting antenna 
and the anechoic chamber material. The test consisted of injecting an RF 
signal at 880 MHz with 10 dBm power in order to generate an electric field 
inside the cell. An RFID tag was placed inside the cell and the backscattered 
field from the tag was detected with the sensing probe antenna connected to 
a second port. The probe antenna was a simple half-wavelength dipole 
printed on an FR4 substrate and located 10 cm away from the tag. 

RFID Technology: Main Principles and Non-linear Behavior of Tags     33 
The results of the reported measurement are summarized in Table 2.1. 
The experimental results show the presence of harmonic signals with a 
relatively low power compared to the fundamental frequency. The power 
level for the second harmonic in the cell is constant with the presence or 
absence of the tag. On the contrary, the power of the third harmonic strongly 
increases as soon as a tag is present, which shows that tags can radiate third 
harmonic signals.

Table 2.1. Measured power of harmonics at a 10 dBm input signal 
This first type of experiment in the RFID field shows the remarkable 
ability of passive UHF RFID tags to generate and backscatter harmonics. At 
this level, it was possible to stipulate that a tag could backscatter harmonics 
and intermodulation products when interrogated with a modulated or 
unmodulated reader signal. However, it is worth noting that the proposed 
measurement setup did not consider an activated tag, i.e. no real tag response 
was measured except the harmonic multiples of the carrier wave sent by the 
RF transmitter and multiplied by the tag circuitry. Although this study 
aroused some interest in the RFID field, no further research efforts were 
made. This could be because the observed power levels were considered 
sufficiently low with no impact on traditional applications. 
Chapter 3 will describe in more detail the complete experimental 
characterization and associated configuration setups of harmonic generation 
and radiation. In regard to this first approach, tags will be activated during 
the characterization steps, and complementary radiated and conducted 
measurements will be presented. 
2.4.2. Wireless sensor tags 
Regarding end-user sensing applications, two non-linear effects have so 
far been exploited in RFID or batteryless devices based on rectifying diodes. 
The first one is harmonic generation in tags, called frequency doubler  

34     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
tags, with its applications in detection. The second one is intermodulation 
distortion, with its applications in localization. 
2.4.2.1. Frequency doubler tags 
Frequency doubler tags, also known as one-bit RFID tags, are used to 
check and monitor the possible presence of an object (attached to a tag) in 
the interrogation zone of a reader. In this technique, the antenna (e.g. crossed 
dipole [ORE 11] or fractal loop [PSY 08]) is disturbed by the impinging 
radar wave and is connected to a small and light low-barrier Schottky diode. 
The current induced in the antenna is propagated through the diode that 
produces harmonic signals due to its non-linearity. The predefined harmonic 
signal (the second harmonic) is backscattered by the antenna, which is 
properly tuned for the two frequencies. This type of harmonic generation is 
reliably adopted in the microwave frequency range, leading to the harmonic 
radar concept [PSY 08, COL 04, ROS 12]. Such a signal can be detected by 
means of a microwave receiver without being masked by reflections from 
the surrounding scenario. The detection is considered feasible even if 
modulation is applied to the carrier. The envisaged applications are the 
harmonic radar for insect tracking [PSY 08], traffic applications [HAR 73] 
and avalanche rescues [ORE 11]. 
Additional works were recently presented based on the same concept, but 
whilst considering a near-field operation at 7.5 MHz and using a multiplier 
diode made of an organic material [MAR 14]. Pentacene diodes are organic 
devices, with pentacene used as a semiconductor. These diodes are used in 
harmonic tags to provide the non-linearity required to generate the harmonic. 
A parameter called conversion loss, defined as the difference (in dB) 
between the input power of the fundamental frequency and the detected 
harmonic power, is used in order to quantify the quality of the process. The 
best conversion loss for the harmonic tag of one bit is 52.5 dB, detected at a 
distance of 12.5 cm with an input power of 10 dBm. Since only one diode is 
used, the most significant harmonic generated is in this case the second 
harmonic. The major drawback of this auto-proclaimed eco-friendly chipless 
tag is the large size of the antenna (14 cm × 14 cm). 
Another application that exploits the harmonic generation of non-linear 
devices is the detection of counterfeit RFID cards [ROM 09]. The principle  
is based on the electromagnetic characteristics of these cards rather than  
the digital information that they transmit. One of the steps considers the 

RFID Technology: Main Principles and Non-linear Behavior of Tags     35 
electromagnetic signature that RFID cards produce by radiating the harmonic 
frequencies of the communication carrier between the reader and the card at 
13.56 MHz in the near field. The reported results show that different RFID 
card manufacturers can be automatically distinguished with the broadband 
analysis. 
For wireless sensor applications in the cited references, it is worth noting 
that no work has been reported concerning the characterization of non-linear 
devices (i.e. diode-based rectifiers), either in impedance or in harmonic 
production. Details about the experimental characterization and modeling of 
generated harmonics from non-linear devices (and notably in RFID chips) 
will be discussed in Chapters 3 and 4, respectively. 
2.4.2.2. Intermodulation distortion 
So far, no specific application exploiting intermodulation distortion in 
totally batteryless devices has been found in the literature. 
In 2009, Gomes et al. proposed the use of a semi-passive tag based on 
intermodulation distortion for localization scenarios [HUG 09]. The operating 
principle is shown in Figure 2.7. The reader sends an RF signal at the 
frequency ݂ଵ, modulated by a pseudo-random sequence and an unmodulated 
carrier RF signal at a close but different frequency ݂ଵ. When the signal reaches 
the tag, it is demodulated and re-modulated on a different carrier (built by the 
intermodulation product provided by the non-linear component, i.e. a diode) 
and re-emitted to the air interface at the frequency ሺ2݂ଵെ݂ଶሻ. The modulation 
allows the identification of a specific tag in the analyzed environment. The 
reader has an RF receiver front-end tuned to the frequency ሺ2݂ଵെ݂ଶሻ, which 
allows it to capture a replica of the transmitted signal. The two pseudo-random 
signals (transmitted and received) can be compared in time, thereby allowing 
the calculation of the travel time. Time delay indicates the distance between a 
reader and the considered tag. For finding the tag localization, at least three 
readers have to be used in order to apply the trilateration principle.

Figure 2.7. Localization system exploiting the intermodulation phenomena 
2.4.2.3. Multi-carrier system 
In order to increase the read range and overcome the problem of insufficient 
power in passive RFID tags, several authors have proposed a multi-carrier UHF 
passive RFID system composed of a reader transceiver, a carrier wave emitter 
(CWE) and a passive UHF RFID tag [MIN 11, HSI 07a, HSI 07b, HSI 11].  
The proposed system offers additional energy to Class-1 Gen-2 tags and  
also generates frequency diversity on its modulated response by means of a 
multiple-carrier operation. The reader can be benefited from the frequency 
diversity gain in order to overcome the multi-path fading problem. 
The proposed approach profits from the narrow frequency range operation 
of passive RFID tags using different carrier frequencies that are closer to each 
other. The operation is as follows: (i) the CWE located close to the tag, as a 
radio source, emits a carrier wave to illuminate the tags and provide them 
additional wireless power; the CWE frequency is approximately 10 MHz 
distance from the standard carrier wave of the reader transceiver; (ii) in 
addition, a transceiver carrying the logic of an RFID reader transmits and 
interprets the communication protocol with the tag at the standard frequency; 
(iii) special processing of signals sent from the reader to the tag is performed 
in order to mitigate the effect of additional carriers, which allows the tag to 
understand the commands. 
The reported results show the tag response with a modulated backscattering 
signal for each carrier wave source (CWE and transceiver). This phenomenon 

RFID Technology: Main Principles and Non-linear Behavior of Tags     37 
is defined by the authors as frequency diversity, and further work is envisaged 
to combine the modulated backscattered response around each carrier. 
Although the reported results showed an improvement in the read range that is 
four times longer than ordinary Class-1 Gen-2 tags, there are some 
inconveniences introduced in the tag side, which can trigger demodulation 
errors of reader-to-tag commands. In addition, the processing changes the 
standard communication protocol for UHF passive RFID tags, thus making 
them unviable for traditional/commercial applications. 
2.5. Summary 
Nowadays, RFID has become a well-known technology standardized 
with commonly known and emblematic applications. Among the existing 
standards, UHF RFID is still evolving with numerous improvements for 
different layers (in terms of anti-collision protocols, memory size, chip 
sensitivity, antennas dedicated to harsh environments, etc.), as well as with 
new functionalities included in the tags in addition to the identification 
function. These additional functionalities have triggered the upgrading of the 
standard EPC Class-1 Gen-2 from version one (V1) to version two (V2) with 
a major focus on security and data protection. In this context, the chip 
UCODE DNA from NXP is the first one to apply crypto approaches to 
protect chip information. Furthermore, research and innovation in passive 
RFID does not stop and new functions proposed by chip manufacturers 
continue to push the standards for including and regulating this fast-growing 
technology. Hence, passive UHF RFID technology is still very promising, 
especially in the emerging area of IoT. 
Non-linear effects such as harmonic generation and intermodulation in 
the tag side have been exploited as a one-bit system where the presence of 
harmonics or intermodulation components serve to detect the presence of 
tags. However, as in most RF systems, the non-linear properties of EPC 
Class-1 Gen-2 chips imply uncontrolled backscattered harmonic signals 
(especially the third harmonic), which a priori have undesirable effects such 
as energy loss. This loss is shown by signals transmitted at other frequencies 
than the operating frequency. Chapters 3 and 4 aim to complete and better 
understand this phenomenon with measurement and modeling studies, 
respectively.

Characterization Platforms for  
Passive RFID Chips and Tags 
This chapter presents two specialized test platforms to characterize the 
performance of EPC Class-1 Gen-2 RFID chips (commercially known as 
RAIN [RAI 17]) with and without the tag antenna. The importance of these 
platforms is the measurement acquisition function that operates while the 
standard communication reader tag is established. With the aim of evaluating 
the non-linearity of those chips, specific analysis methods and equipment 
configuration are developed. This chapter unfolds the techniques and 
methods used for this evaluation. 
These test platforms allow measuring, among other variables, the 
threshold activation power, chip impedance at both modulation states and 
parameters of the modulated chip response in both time and frequency 
domains. In addition, measurements can be set during sweeps of frequency, 
power and time. The added value using these platforms is its large 
bandwidth operation that allows performing measurement at frequencies 
other than the reader carrier, for instance the harmonic multiples.

The operation principle of the passive RFID system was presented in 
Chapter 2. Concerning functionality, it can be summarized by two 
operations:

– Wireless data collection, described by a constant interaction between 
reader and tag, where the reader acts as a base station in order to read or 
write information from or to the tag, respectively. 
The RF-to-DC power conversion task performed by the RFID chip is the 
well-known process of radio-frequency rectification, in which the chip 
harvests enough energy to be able to interact with the reader. The rectifier 
operation is possible thanks to the use of two or more diode-based voltage 
doubler stages (details of the rectifier architecture and operation will be 
discussed in Chapter 4). These diodes determine the non-linear behavior of 
the RFID chip [DEV 05, BOL 10]. 
The objective of this chapter is to observe the characteristics of the 
modulated backscatter signal and evaluate the information eventually carried 
by the harmonic signals, i.e. the consequence of the non-linear behavior of 
the RFID chip. The study is done when the communication from the reader 
to the tag is fully established. In addition, analysis of the reader harmonic 
production on the forward link is performed. An important contribution to 
ease the power spectral density (PSD) analysis of the backscattered signals, 
including harmonics is also presented. The contribution uses a pre-
configured RFID air interface in order to produce a periodic sequence of bits 
on the tag response. A dependency analysis of the backscattered harmonic 
generation on different parameters such as reader frequency, reader power 
and periodicity of bit sequence is explained. 
Section 3.2 explains the setups and measurement procedure of the tag 
response with special attention to the RFID air interface treatment.  
Section 3.3 presents the platform to characterize complete RFID tags, 
including the tag antenna, the so-called radiated characterization. Section 3.4 
focuses on the characterization of RFID chips itself, without the tag antenna. 
This method, so-called conducted measurements, makes it possible to study 
the effect of the impedance seen by the chip on the harmonic generation. 
Finally, section 3.5 summarizes the milestones of the characterization 
platforms.

3.2. Measuring the backscattered tag response 
3.2.1. Harmonic backscattering 
The reason why the harmonic signals are re-radiated by the tag antenna 
can be explained by looking into similar technologies at low power 
rectification. The rectennas, devices formed by one antenna loaded by one 
rectifier circuit commonly used for electromagnetic energy harvesting (EEH) 
[MCS 92], have a similar rectifier architecture to passive RFID tags. 
Although rectennas used for EEH and passive RFID tags have a similar RF 
section, there is a small but crucial difference in the non-linear treatment. 
Because of the non-linearity behavior of the diodes used in the rectifier, 
appropriate techniques of simulation and optimization are used in those 
circuit designs. The harmonic balance (HB) is a simulation method that 
considers the effect of the harmonic signals produced by non-linear devices 
[GEO 10]. In the rectenna case, the harmonic currents flow to the DC section 
and to antenna terminals. If they are well filtered in the DC section side, a 
pure DC signal can be achieved at the output, and then an enhanced  
RF-to-DC conversion efficiency is achieved [JIY 04, ERE 12, GEO 10]. The 
phenomena can be simulated with the HB method, as it is possible to predict 
and to control the behavior of the complete rectenna, both in the DC section 
and in the antenna side. In passive UHF RFID chips, the harmonics reflected 
through the DC section are treated during the chip design process, and an 
optimal DC signal then feeds the digital section of the chip. However, the 
harmonics are reflected through the antenna since no harmonic treatment is 
performed on the RFID antenna design. The antenna design in passive RFID 
tags begins directly from the knowledge of one impedance value. The known 
impedance is that of the chips at the fundamental frequency provided in data 
sheets (e.g. [IMP]). Current design processes aim to ensure matching at the 
frequency of operation, but the antenna–chip impedance behavior around the 
harmonic frequencies is unknown. As long as the antenna and the chip are 
independently designed [DOM 10], and depending on the antenna structure, 
it can radiate some of the harmonic signals generated by the rectifier, which 
finally triggers in harmonic backscattering [NIK 09, AND 13]. 
3.2.2. Measurement techniques 
The measurement procedure of backscattered harmonics is based on the 
observation of RFID signals in the time domain, and the calculation of its  
 

42     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
PSD is performed by using fast Fourier transform (FFT). Figure 3.1 shows 
the conceptual procedure. The FFT calculation is made over a carrier wave 
(CW) portion after the Query command, as shown in Figure 3.2. The 
measurement procedure directly exploits the possibilities that the RFID air 
interface offers on its physical layer to facilitate the spectral analysis. The 
challenge is done by parameterizing the tag response to produce a cyclic and 
repeatable signal that facilitates the PSD analysis: repeatable in order to 
easily analyze and compare the results and cyclic in order to achieve well-
defined side lobes that are peaks including the cyclic information signal. 
Details of the measurement procedure are explained below.

3.2.3. RFID air interface 
The standard RFID air interface provides parameter definitions for 
communication protocols within a common framework for globally accepted 

Characterization Platforms for Passive RFID Chips and Tags     43 
frequencies in RFID [ISO 12]. The RFID air interface describes the way in 
which a tag communicates with a reader by wireless signals and it is part of 
the physical layer of the multilayer definition of the RFID system presented 
in Chapter 2. 
One of the contributions presented in this chapter is to highlight the 
characteristics of the backscattering modulation to clearly interpret the time 
domain signals and their PSD calculation. Characteristics such as 
backscattering link frequency (BLF), data encoding and preamble are pre-
configured on the treatment of the physical layer in the UHF RFID system. 
3.2.4. Configuration of the physical layer in the UHF RFID system 
The configuration of the UHF RFID physical layer is based on the 
manipulation of the Query command structure sent by the reader. A pre-set 
Query command orders the target tag to answer with a specific and 
repeatable PSD, thus allowing clear identification of its spectral content. 
Two settings play a key role in easing the spectral signal interpretation. The 
first is to set the tag response (first side lobe from Figure 3.1) far enough 
from the reader carrier. This is achieved manipulating the BLF.  
The second is to force the tag to answer with a periodic signal able to 
always generate the same spectral shape independently of the tag under test. 
This periodic signal should last long enough to facilitate the FFT 
interpretation. This is achieved by  configuring the preamble of the 16-bit 
pseudo random number. And in the same time, the side lobes are well-
defined compared with a random sequence. 
The tag response to the Query command contains a 16-bit pseudo random 
number (RN16). The RN16 response has a preamble with a well-known 
structure depending on how the Query is composed. Figure 3.3 shows the 
Query structure.

use 
the 
Query 
1000101100000000001101. The process to configure suitable values of 
BLF, the data encoding and the preamble are detailed below. 
The first four bits allow us to identify the command as Query command 
and last five bits correspond to the cyclic redundancy check (CRC5) for 
error detection and depend on the information content. The information 
content is the sequence of bits between the Query command identifier and 
the CRC5. Inside the information sequence, there are three parameters for 
configuring a suitable tag response. 
The bit in the fifth position, which is called the divide ratio (DR), 
determines where the BLF is defined. The value that the fifth bit can take 
“ 0 ” or “ 1 ” is traduced as DR=64/3 or DR=8, respectively. In the analysis 
of the PSD, the BLF, which is the spectral distance between the CW 
component and the tag response, will be higher when the DR is higher. The 
calculation of the BLF is determined by the ratio DR/Rtcal, where 
Rtcal=5.5×Tari and Tari is the reference time interval for reader to tag 
signaling and is equal to the duration of data “ 0 ” [EPC]. The pair bits in the 
sixth and seventh positions is called M and sets the tag-to-reader data rate 
and encoding to which the tag responds. The pair of bits is set to “ 01 ” 
which traduces into M=2, which instructs the tag to respond using Miller 
coding with two cycles per bit as shown in Figure 3.4. Finally, the eighth bit 
position, which is called TRext, achieves the periodic sequence of bits on the 
tag response. When M=2 and TRext=“ 0 ”, the tag prefixes a short duration 
preamble to its RN16 response, and when M=2 and TRext= “ 1 ”, the RN16 
response prefixes an extended preamble of 16 bits of data “ 0 ” with two 
cycles per bit defined by M=2. Figure 3.5 shows the extended preamble 
scheme. The periodic sequence has a duration of approximately 65 μs 
(depending on Tari) that is enough to make the PSD calculation. Other 
parameters on the Query command are not configured since these are used 
for inventory purposes when the Select command is previously sent which is 
not the case. However, the values of these remaining parameters do not alter 
the results.

3.3. Characterization of RFID tags – radiated measurements 
The tag response and harmonic level are evaluated by radiated 
measurements using commercial RFID inlays. The harmonic level and its 
relationship with the performance at the fundamental frequency are analyzed 
in this section. This relation is developed by an experimental parametric 
study considering the harmonic dependency on the reader power, the bit 
sequence structure and the channel in the frequency hopping operation. The 
experimental study is based on calculating the PSD of RFID signals at the 
harmonic frequencies in the forward and return links in compliance with  
the EPC Class-1 Gen-2 UHF RFID standard (commercially known as  
RAIN) [EPC]. 

46     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
3.3.1. Tags under test 
In order to show the measurement procedure, nine different commercial 
tags (inlays) were chosen. The tags are shown in Figure 3.7 and their details 
are provided in Table 3.2. 
From the two possible options shown in Figure 3.1, in case of the absence 
of the tag, only the carrier component is expected in the PSD analysis. On 
the contrary, when there is a tag activated, the power of the first side lobe 
around the CW in the PSD analysis is considered to be the power of the 
modulated tag response. The calculation of the PSD is repeated over the 
harmonics of the CW until the fifth harmonic order on each tag. The 
implemented modulation for all the studied tags is the amplitude-shift keying 
(ASK) [EPC]. 
3.3.2. Measurement system 
The measurement system includes a signal generator Agilent N5182A for 
synthesized RFID signals or an Alien Reader ALR-9780 for real RFID 
signals, a RF amplifier Empower BBS314AAj with a 41 dB gain, a 12 GHz 
Digital Storage Oscilloscope (DSO) Agilent 91204A (40 Gsamples/s) and a 
PC for control and data processing. The set of signal generator and PC is 
called the RFID tester, this configuration allows managing the Query 
command. Figure 3.6 shows the measurement setup in the anechoic chamber 
with a partition wall that provides 48 dB isolation between horn antennas to 
minimize the mutual coupling: 
– The element under test (EUT) tag is located at a distance of 1m from 
each horn antenna and oriented for maximum reception and re-radiation; 
– The forward link signal is generated in only one of two ways: in 
synthesized signals, the baseband command generated by Matlab is 
transferred to the signal generator where it is modulated, amplified and sent 
to the tag via the transmitting antenna; in signals coming from an RFID 
reader, an ALR-9780 reader is set to replace the signal generator; 
– The return link signal is always collected by the receiving antenna, 
observed and analyzed in the RF band on the DSO; 
 

Characterization Platforms for Passive RFID Chips and Tags     47 
– In compliance with the EPC Class-1 Gen-2 standard, the synthesized 
signal carries the Query command. In the case of signals coming from an 
RFID reader, the RFID air interface cannot be parameterized and standard 
handshake is made between reader and tag [EPC]. 
The amplifier was used only in power dependency tests, as will be 
presented in section 3.7.3.3. 
 
Figure 3.6. a) Bistatic configuration in the  
anechoic chamber. b) Equipment setup 
3.3.3. Power budget 
The power budget in the band 868 MHz–922 MHz considering the 
measurement setup of Figure 3.6 is described below. The antenna gain  
AG varies increasingly between 5.69 dBi and 6.69 dBi at 868 MHz and  
922 MHz, respectively:  
– in transmission: losses in cables 1, 2 and 3 including connectors  
are –0.73 dB, –0.73 dB and –1.45 dB, respectively; when the amplifier is 
used, it inserts a gain of 41 dB; 
 

48     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
– in reception: losses in cables 4 and 5 are –0.73 dB and –1.46 dB, 
respectively;  
– the noise level inside the anechoic chamber is approximately  
–110 dBm.  
The power Pout delivered by the RFID tester or the reader varies 
according to the needs of each tag activation. Considering the power budget 
in transmission and reception and the free-space path loss [3.1] at the 
distance R of 1m and the wavelength λ at each frequency in Table 3.1, it is 
possible to calculate each tag sensitivity:

Power tag sensitivity is defined as the minimum power received by the 
tag necessary to activate its chip and wait for an understandable response on 
the reader side. Table 3.2 presents each tag sensitivity at the fundamental 
frequency calculated as Pout minus 28.12 dB in the case of European tags and 
Pout minus 28.58 dB in the case of US tags. These subtraction factors 
correspond to the described power budget.

3.3.5. Radar cross-section and physical surface of a tag 
3.3.5.1. Radar cross-section and tag dimensions 
The radar cross-section (RCS) of the tag or echo area is defined as the 
area intercepting that amount of power which, when isotropically scattered, 
produces at the receiver a density which is equal to that scattered by the 
actual object. The RCS σ for dipole antennas of half a wavelength or less, 
which is the case for common RFID tags, is defined as follows [CON 05]:

where ZL is the impedance of the antenna load, i.e. the chip impedance, ZA is 
the impedance of the tag antenna, Gt is the gain of the tag antenna and RA is 
the real part of ZA. The factor K defines the influence of the chip impedance 
mismatch on the amount of the RCS. A matched polarization between the 
reader and tag antennas is considered in [3.2]. 
 

50     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
It is possible to rewrite [3.2] in terms of the power density of an 
electromagnetic wave incident on the tag antenna in free space represented 
by S, and the power backscattered by the tag in the direction of the reader 
represented by Pback as given in [3.3]

The two states of impedance of the RFID chip, which regulate the 
backscattering modulation technique between the scavenging and reflecting 
conditions, yield two values of K or consequently two values of the RCS. 
Then from [3.6], it is possible to define the differential RCS or ΔRCS as  
ΔRCS = หߪ௦௖௔௩௘௡௚௜௡௚െ ߪ௥௘௙௟௘௖௧௜௡௚หൌ |Δܭ|ܣ௘ܩ௧

functional characteristics of the tag as read range or sensitivity because it is 
related to the efficiency of the backscattering modulation technique  
[BOL 10, DOM 10]. Then, finally, the physical area Ap of the antenna can be

3.3.5.2. Experimental validation 
From [3.6] and [3.8], by considering the physical area of the tag antenna 
for a given tag, the larger the resonance surface, the larger the effective area 
and the higher the RCS. Figure 3.7 shows 20 μs of tag response for the nine 
tags where the modulated backscatter is clearly distinguishable. Tag T1, 
which exhibits a larger resonance surface, has a higher scatter capability than 
the RCS. In an ideal condition when K=1 in the scavenging state, an antenna 
loaded with a complex-conjugate impedance load scatters the same amount 
of power as absorbed by the load, thus causing a maximum ΔRCS. Although 
all tags are illuminated with the same power Pout = 16.75 dBm, it is 
highlighted in Figure 3.7 that the amplitudes, directly related to the ΔRCS, 
vary up to 42%. Pout=16.75 dBm represents the power to activate the tag 
with less sensitivity T4. 
Consequently, there are two factors involved in the |ΔRCS| variations 
[3.7]:  
– the matching degree between the antenna and the RFID chip in the 
scavenging state; 
– the physical area of the antenna.

3.3.6. Optimized PSD analysis of the RFID communication 
3.3.6.1. PSD properties 
The interpretation of the PSD is enhanced due to the contribution of the 
RFID physical layer setting which achieves a periodic sequence of bits on 
the tag response. This implies that the characteristics of the modulated signal 
coming from the tag are enhanced on the observed window. Indeed, in this 
case, the amplitudes of the spectrum are maximal and the BLF is 
distinguishably positioned at 230 kHz from the CW. It should be noted that 
for the following analysis, the power of the tag response will be quantified as 
the amplitude of first side lobe. Figures 3.8–3.10 show examples of the PSD 
calculation while the communication of the reader to the tag is established. 
The PSD at CW fundamental and harmonic frequencies are compared with 
the PSD when no tag is present. In this last case, the observed CW is 
essentially due to the coupling between horns. 
Two operational modes of the passive UHF RFID tag are defined in both 
states of modulation:  
– The structural mode MS is produced when the tag antenna is in the 
matching condition. The scattered power contribution is always constant. In 
this mode, K=1 in [3.2]; 
– The antenna mode MA is produced by the re-radiated power reflected by 
the chip load into the tag antenna. The antenna mode depends on the two 
values that the chip impedance can take. Under ideal matching conditions in 
the scavenging state, the structural mode is equal to the antenna mode. 
The scavenging state can be quantified at the PSD level at the CW 
frequency. Only in the reflecting state does the antenna mode change. The 
PSD level of the tag response in the reflecting state is observed at the BLF. 
In the harmonic analysis, these PSD properties are also valid for analyzing 
the scavenging and reflecting states. 
For tag T5, Figure 3.8 shows the PSD at 915 MHz while Figures 3.9 and 
3.10 show the PSD at the second harmonic (i.e. 1830 MHz) and the third 
harmonic (i.e. 2745 MHz). The tag T5 was chosen because it has a higher 
PSD level at the third backscattered harmonic. In Figures 3.8 and 3.10, the 
tag response with modulated information on the side lobes like a  
typical spectrum of the square waves is clearly seen. In the case of the 

Characterization Platforms for Passive RFID Chips and Tags     53 
second harmonic shown in Figure 3.9, no response was observed at the 
activation power.

3.3.6.2. Matching in the scavenging state 
As shown in Figure 3.8, when there is a tag, the PSD level of the CW at 
the fundamental frequency in the presence of a tag is 6.9 dB higher 
compared with when there is no tag. The 6.9 dB are taken as the total 
contribution of MS+MA. The difference at the third harmonic is 3.27 dB, as 
shown in Figure 3.10. In the PSD analysis, the matching in the scavenging 
state can be quantified by the difference of levels at the CW frequency when 
there is a tag and when there is no tag. The difference has to be minimal 
representing only the RCS in structural mode. Large differences indicate 
mismatch reflections. The difference indirectly assesses the characteristics of 
the RCS from each tag at fundamental and harmonic frequencies. 
Figure 3.11 shows the PSD value of the CW fundamental frequency and 
CW harmonics for five representative tags until the fifth harmonic, 
considering each tag sensibility. The mesh represents the measured CW 
power when no tag is present also until the fifth harmonic. A decreasing  
 
 

Characterization Platforms for Passive RFID Chips and Tags     55 
behavior is observed while the harmonic order increases. The only exception 
is tag T1, which has a second backscattered harmonic weaker than the third, 
revealing scavenging properties at the second harmonic. Tag T5 has the best 
scavenging performance, i.e. the better matching at the third harmonic 
according to the criterion of minimal difference of PSD levels at the CW 
frequency. 
In the performed setup, the PSD calculation at the CW frequency 
represents the coupling between the horn antennas, which reveals CW 
harmonics coming from the RFID tester. Scatter capabilities of each tag vary 
the level of the observed CW, which depends on the RCS of each tag.

3.3.6.3. Harmonic backscattering 
The level at the BLF in the PSD analysis at each CW harmonic represents 
the backscattered harmonics in the reflecting state. It is important to explain 
the basis of harmonic radiation of the tag antenna, usually designed as  
 

56     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
an optimization process of a half-wave dipole at the fundamental frequency. 
Figure 3.12 shows the harmonic current distributions on a half-wave dipole 
operating at the fundamental frequency, which shows that for even 
harmonics the current at the antenna input is zero. Although if even 
harmonics were produced by the RFID chip, they would not be efficiently 
re-radiated since the half-wave dipole would require infinite impedance at 
even harmonics, which is practically impossible [CHA 89]. Figure 3.13 
shows the level contributed by five representative tags on their modulated 
response at each harmonic frequency. In all cases, the fundamental and third 
harmonic responses are predominant. Even though the fifth is an odd 
harmonic, it has a burly distinguishable level. Then, the claim of a 
perceptible third backscattered harmonic carrying information is valid.

3.3.7. Dependency analysis of harmonic scattering 
3.3.7.1. Dependency on operation at the fundamental frequency 
Analyzing the harmonic performance with respect to the results at the 
fundamental frequency, section 3.3.5.1 presents tag T1 with the best 
performance at the fundamental frequency. However, the analysis made in 
section 3.3.6.3 presents tag T5 with the higher third backscattered harmonic. 
The performance of the tag depends basically on the antenna–chip matching 
and its physical characteristics [3.7] at the frequency of interest. Since the 
tag antenna has different designs, some of them can be close to a matching 
situation on some odd harmonics profiting the current distribution over the 
dipole shown in Figure 3.12, especially the third one due to its level. A 
certain degree of matching at the harmonic frequency may cause the antenna 
to re-radiate the harmonics produced by the RFID chip. However, the 
harmonic generation capability is defined by the chip itself. In order to 
quantify the effect of the tag antenna impedance on the level of radiated 
harmonics, the characterization must be performed directly in the chip. This 
topic will be addressed in section 3.4. 
3.3.7.2. Dependency on bit sequence 
Achieving the manipulation of the RFID air interface to reproduce tag 
responses with different bit structures enables the development of a bit 
sequence dependency analysis. The dependency on the sequence of bits on 
the backscattered harmonic is studied by calculating the PSD over a random 
bit sequence, by randomly choosing a portion of the RN16 response instead 
of the preamble. Therefore, the comparison of PSD was made on two 
different sequences when Pout=16.75 dBm. Figure 3.14 shows the PSD 
comparison at the fundamental frequency for tag T4. As expected, the side 
lobes in the periodic sequences are narrow and powerful compared to those 
in the random sequences. The same behavior is observed for the third 
harmonic in Figure 3.15. In order to compare the power levels of the 
modulated tag response until the fifth harmonic from the periodic and 
random sequences, Figure 3.16 shows the data for tag T5. The PSD level of 
periodic signals is higher until the fourth harmonic. In the fifth harmonic, the 
relation is inverse, but close to the noise level. Then, the sequence of bits 
transmitted by the tag directly influences the backscattered harmonics. The 
merit of the air interface configuration is that it can reproduce a tag response 
carrying a periodic sequence of bits over all EPC Class-1 Gen-2 tags 
facilitating the PSD analysis. Looking at the applications, the use of periodic 

Characterization Platforms for Passive RFID Chips and Tags     59 
sequences can be advantageous when the detection of signals from different 
sources and diverse spatial antenna arrangements produces an interfered 
spectrum in which the detection of the desired signal is difficult.

periodic and random sequence responses for tag T5 
3.3.7.3. Dependency on reader power 
Reader power dependency is studied by varying Pout from the minimum 
level to activate the tag with less sensibility until reaching the equipment 
limit or to saturate the tag in certain cases. No low-pass filter (LPF) was used 
at the reader output in order to reproduce a normal scenery in compliance 
with the EPC Class-1 Gen-2 standard regarding the transmitted power level 
at fundamental and spurious bands. For this experience two sources were 
considered: (1) RFID tester and (2) ALR-9780 reader. Figure 3.17 shows the 
comparison of both sources. The second and third CW harmonics from the 
reader are even 14 dB and 2 dB greater than the RFID tester, respectively. 
For the fourth and fifth harmonics, the reader and the RFID tester have 
comparable power levels. 

Characterization Platforms for Passive RFID Chips and Tags     61 
 
Figure 3.17. Comparison of harmonic levels generated  
from the RFID tester and one commercial reader 
A second set of tests was performed by introducing the amplifier after the 
signal generator, which allows evaluation at larger power ranges. The 
amplifier introduces 41 dB of gain. Pout is first set to –24.2 dBm, which 
represents an average power of operation sufficient to work with all 
available tags. An increment of 19.2 dB which means Pout = –5 dBm does 
not affect the strength of the tag response at the fundamental frequency as 
can be seen in Figure 3.18 but only affects the level at the CW frequency. On 
the contrary, Figures 3.19 and 3.20 show that this effect is clearly 
constructive for the second and third harmonics of the tag response. Then, 
the backscattered harmonics directly depend on the power level that the 
reader transmits. Two reasons can explain this effect both based on the 
increment of the harmonic level from the reader: 
– By increasing the reader power, the input impedance of the chip 
changes because of its non-linear behavior and this changes the matching 
with the antenna. Depending on this, the shunt transistor, which regulates the 
internal supply voltage of the digital part, receives power to activate it and 
works until its upper power limit [LUK 07]; 

62     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
– The tag could respond to the harmonic Query. The effect in which the 
tag responds at various frequencies is called backscattering frequency 
diversity and was reported in [MIN 11, HIS 07].

this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/andia/non-linearites.zip 
3.3.7.4. Dependency on frequency hopping 
The frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) technique is based on 
the automatic hopping of the CW frequency at brief time intervals. The 
frequency is chosen in a pseudo random way from a set of frequencies 
covering a much wider band than the bandwidth required to transmit the 
signal containing the useful data. In the US, according to the current Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) regulation, the FHSS can be used to 
sweep the frequency band from 902 MHz to 928 MHz with 500 kHz width 
per channel [EPC]. Figure 3.21 shows the PSD level at CW fundamental 
frequencies over the entire US band for tags T1, T4 and T5. The top curves 
represent the PSD at the CW frequency and bottom curves represent the PSD 
level at the BLF. The CW level varies 3dB over the entire band. However, 
the bottom curves are almost constant. As was described before, the 
impedance of the RFID chip varies according to the received power. Then,  
 
 
 
 

64     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
this variation is capable of helping or harming the chip performance at the 
fundamental harmonic depending on the impedance bandwidth of the tag 
antenna. In this case, the 3 dB variations on the CW level do not affect  
the tag response in the US band. Figure 3.22 shows the PSD level at the third 
harmonic for the same tags T1, T4 and T5. The PSD level at the BLF on the 
third harmonic varies until 10dB while the PSD level at the BLF varies 5dB. 
The non-constant level of the tag response at the third harmonic is consistent 
since the tag impedance bandwidth is not tuned over this band. The 
variations of the PSD level at the BLF on the third harmonic band show an 
indirect relation with the FHSS channel. The indirect relation states that 
there is a major cause: it is in fact the matching degree at the third harmonic. 
The PSD level at the BLF also depends on the channel conditions that are 
different in each band due to the fading phenomenon [COL 98]. Therefore, 
there is no direct dependency on the FHSS technique.

3.3.8. Limitations of tag characterization by radiated measurements 
A practical experiment to measure the non-linearities in the RFID UHF 
system was described throughout section 3.3. The measurement procedure is 
based on the PSD analysis performing a temporal acquisition directly in the 
RF band while the communication from the tag to the reader is fully 
established. By setting the Query parameters, it is possible to manipulate the 
RFID physical layer in order to facilitate the PSD interpretation. The PSD 
calculation reveals harmonics on the return signal consequence of the not 
treated non-linearity effects of the RFID chip. It was also noted that 
harmonics are generated by the reader in the forward signal. The 
uncontrolled non-linearity in the current UHF RFID technology allows the 
tag to generate harmonic signals carrying information without constraints to 
the EPC Global Class-1 Gen-2 standard. The backscattered harmonics are 
independent of the FHSS transmission technique but depend on the power  
 
 
 

66     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
sent by the reader and the sequence of bits that the tag transmits. To 
investigate the effect of the tag antenna at the fundamental frequency on the 
level of backscattered harmonics, a deeper analysis at chip level is necessary.  
The analysis made on this section considers the entire tag (antenna and 
RFID chip) as the EUT. The analysis evaluates the non-linearity 
characteristic of a UHF RFID EPC Class 1 Gen 2 tag without any specific 
consideration of the kind of the chip used. In order to directly assess the 
harmonic generation from the chip, the next section will focus on the heart 
of the matter, i.e. the characterization of the RFID chip. 
3.4. Characterization of RFID chips–conducted measurements 
In passive UHF RFID systems, the challenge is always to develop 
reduced size and cheap tags. For this purpose, new test platforms, 
characterization methods and prototype techniques are definitely required to 
accurately characterize the tag performance and propose design 
improvements. The existing test platforms, such as in [SUN 09, SUN 10, 
CAT 12, DED 13, CAT 11, NIK 09a, NIK 09b] are based on the 
measurement of, at that time, traditional features of the tag, e.g. the chip-
antenna integration [SUN 09], impedance matching condition [SUN 10, 
CAT 11, NIK 09a, NIK 09b] or differential radar cross-section (ΔRCS) and 
sensitivity [CAT 12, DED 13, CAT 11, NIK 09a]. In addition, most of the 
methods to characterize the RFID chip are performed without activating the 
chip during measurements [SUN 09, SUN 10, NIK 09a, NIK 09b] and 
always at the fundamental frequency. 
Commercial test benches such as Tagformance from Voyantic [TAG] and 
RFID Xplorer from CISC Semiconductors [RFI] are the plug and play 
solutions addressed primarily to industrial RFID actors who are looking for 
tag design optimization using the tag activation threshold as the key 
performance indicator. Depending on the test requirements and parameters 
for evaluation or optimization, limited by standard functionalities, one of the 
reported laboratories or commercial test benches solutions could be suitable. 
However, when exploring for new functionalities of standard RFID tags and 
measuring advanced parameters, especially those caused by their non-linear 
behavior, existing test platforms and methods are not suitable. 
 

Characterization Platforms for Passive RFID Chips and Tags     67 
Previous sections showed the existence of modulated backscattering 
signals backscattered by the tag at the harmonic frequencies of the CW. So 
far, it is known that the diode-based rectifier operation performed by the 
RFID chip determines the non-linear behavior of the chip resulting in 
harmonic signal production [DEV 05, BOL 10] where the impedance 
modulation is still present, producing a redundant backscattering 
modulation. This concept is presented in Figure 3.23, showing an RFID tag 
backscattering information not only at the fundamental frequency (e.g. 868 
MHz) but also, for example, at the third harmonic (i.e. 2604 MHz). Further 
details about the rectifier architecture and operation will be discussed in 
Chapter 4. 
 
Figure 3.23. Illustration of the presence of multiple channels  
in the tag-to-reader communication link. The impedance  
modulation is still present in the harmonic signal 
As was experimentally demonstrated in previous sections by means of 
radiating measurements, commercial tags radiate some of the reflected 
harmonic signals generated by the rectifier, due to the independent design of 
the antenna and the RFID chip [RAO 05]. In order to delimit and 
characterize the source of non-linearities in RFID tags, the definition of a 
specific test platform, which enables accurate measurements during RFID 
chip operation in a wide frequency range (including harmonics), is needed. 
With this in mind, this section aims to meet two main objectives:  
– to define a new RFID non-linear test platform (RFID-NTP) to perform 
a thorough characterization and a study of the non-linear phenomena 
(particularly harmonic signals carrying information during an RFID 
communication); 

68     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
– to carry out an experimental study to show the effect of the non-linear 
treatment from the tag antenna side (basically based on antenna–chip 
matching experiences at different bands). 
3.4.1. Non-linear characterization platform 
Regarding 
the 
feature 
functionalities 
of 
the 
above-reported 
characterization platforms, three groups of contributions are highlighted 
below as a guide to developing the envisaged RFID-TP: 
– so far, all contributions have reported measurement techniques and 
methods only at the fundamental frequency; 
– most of the contributions do not allow activation of the RFID chip 
while characterizing it [SUN 09, SUN 10, NIK 09a, NIK 09b], with the only 
exception being the platform reported in [LUK 07], which uses a special 
fixture to hold the RFID chip; 
– the work reported in [NIK 09a] and [NIK 09b] proposes a simple 
fixture, by means of using standard 50 Ω SMA connectors to hold the RFID 
chip without special matching. 
The measurement procedure presented in this section combines two 
techniques: [NIK 09a] for the simple chip fixing and [LUK 07] for 
measurement in temporal and frequency domains while the chip is activated. 
In addition, the measurement is performed in a wide frequency range that 
allows a characterization until the fourth harmonic (i.e. 868 MHz). The 
waking up of the chip, according to the EPC Class-1 Generation-2 UHF 
RFID standard [EPC], was done as in the measurement setup described in 
section 3.3. The analysis method is based on the measurement of the PSD. 
Unlike the radiated measurements presented in section 3.3, the RFID-NTP 
includes a vectorial characterization of the RFID chip. Consequently, one of 
the contributions of the RFID-NTP is the ability to measure both impedance 
modulation states (scavenging and reflecting) in a wide frequency range. 
3.4.2. System operation description 
The block diagram of the RFID-NTP is shown in Figure 3.24. Two main 
parts are highlighted: the first one consists of specialized equipment for  
 

Characterization Platforms for Passive RFID Chips and Tags     69 
microwave measurements and the so-called RFID tester; the second one is 
based on two impedance tuners connected in series and provides the 
complex conjugate of the chip impedance of the scavenging state which, in 
fact, is the optimum antenna impedance. The last part is the so-called 
antenna impedance emulator. With the described configuration, a complete 
characterization can be performed under full communication between RFID 
tester and chip. The setup of the RFID-NTP shown in Figure 3.25 is 
described below.

characterize the backscattered harmonics by RFID chips

3.4.2.1. RFID chip fixture 
RFID chips were fixed over 50 Ω SMA connectors [NIK 09a]. Soldered 
connections and gluing using conductive ink connections are possible. The 
chip fixtures and calibration kit are shown in Figure 3.26(a). 
 
Figure 3.26. a) RFID chips and calibration kit.  
b) LPF used to reject harmonics from the RFID tester 
3.4.2.2. Antenna impedance emulator 
Two impedance tuners Microlab SF-30F are connected in series to 
provide matching between the 50 Ω RFID tester and the RFID chip. When 
the matching is achieved, the chip is in the scavenging state and, once 
activated, it switches between the two modulation states. The details are 
shown in [LUK 07]. 
3.4.2.3. RFID tester 
– An Agilent N5182A Vector Signal Generator (VSG) is used to generate 
and send the Query command (1000) [EPC] at 868 MHz.  
– A 20 dB LPF is connected at the RF output of the VSG in order to filter 
its harmonics and ensure the chip harmonic response is self-generated. 
Figure 4.4(b) shows the adopted LPF.  
 
 
 

Characterization Platforms for Passive RFID Chips and Tags     71 
– An Agilent N5224A Performance Network Analyzer (PNA) is used as 
an external source in the VSG. After the Query command is sent, the PNA 
determines the impedance of the chip during the scavenging and reflecting 
states over a temporal sweep at the frequencies of interest. The use of the 
PNA allows performing a vector characterization of the RFID chip. 
– A first C123E-20 ATM 20 dB directional coupler is used in order to 
inject the signal coming from the VSG (input port of the coupler) to the PNA 
(transmitted and coupled ports of the coupler). This setup allows the proper 
configuration of the external source for the PNA [AGI 06]. 
– A second C123E-20 ATM 20 dB directional coupler allows visualizing 
the chip response from the coupled port, on the oscilloscope, and to separate 
it from the CW. The visualization allows setting the optimal position of the 
impedance tuners by minimizing the CW level. The direct port goes to the 
PNA. 
– A 12 GHz DSO Agilent 91204A (40 Gsamples/s) connected to the 
coupled port of the second coupler allows us to clearly observe the chip 
response. In addition, a PSD analysis is performed over the time window to 
assess the level response of the chip. 
– Output power, timing, synchronization, triggering and data acquisition 
are controlled by a Matlab program running on the host PC. 
3.4.2.4. Calibration 
The flow diagram shown in Figure 3.27 describes the calibration and 
measurement procedure used for each chip. The minimum activation power 
for a given chip was found by an iterative up-and-down process until the 
PSD detected a tag response. In the calibration step, a first traditional 
calibration at the measurement reference plane shown in Figure 3.24 was 
done using the PNA E-cal module [KEY 14]. After this, the de-embedding 
of the SMA connector was performed by means of a second calibration at 
the same plane, now using the pre-defined short-open-load (SOL) kit shown 
in Figure 3.26(a). In the power budget calibration, the losses of the  
directional couplers, cable and connector must be considered. Finally, the 
characterization of harmonic responses consists of applying the same 
procedure, but now by setting the temporal sweep of the PNA and the PSD 
analysis in the DSO to the frequency of the harmonic. Note that the VSG 
only transmits at the fundamental frequency of 868 MHz and the chip 
activation is always observed at this frequency. 

72     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
This process was repeated for each chip under test. The data acquisition 
was automated by a Matlab script which uses the Agilent Command Expert 
tool [TEC] to easily program the interconnection between equipment, scope 
options and sweep parameters. 
 
Figure 3.27. Flow diagram of the measurement procedure in the RFID-NTP 
3.4.3. Activation threshold and impedance measurement 
The RFID-NTP described in section 3.4 was used to measure and 
characterize several RFID chips. As an example, this section presents the 
measurement results for three commercial RFID chips: (1) G2XM NXP 
SOT505-1 [NXP 13], (2) G2XM NXP SOT1040-AA1 [NXP 13] with strap 
and (3) Impinj Monza 5 [IMP] extracted from the commercial inlay AKtag 
[TAG]. The results of the PSD analysis in the DSO, allowing the observation 
of the chip response in a frame, are shown in Figure 3.28.  

Characterization Platforms for Passive RFID Chips and Tags     73 
 
Figure 3.28. Harmonic characterization method in the DSO. The visualization allows 
the optimal position of the impedance tuners to be set by minimizing the CW level 
A power sweep was performed to find the chip activation power while 
keeping the impedance tuners fixed at the position found during calibration. 
For each power step, the response level and chip input impedance for the 
fundamental and its harmonics up to the fourth were measured. Figure 3.29 
shows the response level at the fundamental frequency for the three chips. 
The waking up point for each chip determines its minimum operating  
power, also known as chip sensitivity. For these three chips, the sensitivity 
varies between –13.2 dBm and –11.5 dBm. A chip sensitivity of −15 dBm, 
measured at the chip pads, is reported in datasheets [NXP 13]. The 
difference from the results presented here is due to the losses on the test 
fixture, considering that on-chip measurements have slightly higher accuracy 
compared to this method. In the case of chip 3, a saturation point at higher 
power levels is observed. This is due to the shunt control that regulates the 
internal supply voltage for the digital part of the chip. The saturation is 
above 8.8 dBm for this chip. 
Figure 3.30 shows the measured impedances during the scavenging state 
for chips 1 and 3 at the fundamental frequency. Impedance results are in 
good agreement with values reported in the datasheets (see Table 3.4) at the 
activation power. Although chips 1 and 2 have the same IC component, they 
have different packages, which explains the difference its impedance values. 
The optimum antenna impedance is the complex conjugate of the chip 
impedance at the sensitivity point shown in Figure 3.29. Quite significant 
changes in the impedance can be observed while increasing the input power. 
These changes show the non-linear behavior of the chip, more precisely due 

74     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
to the rectifier characteristics [DEV 05, ROB 12]. A relatively constant 
impedance can be observed at low input power levels, once the chip is 
activated. This is explained by the fact that, as electromagnetic energy 
harvesters, RFID chips are also optimized to start operating at low input 
power. The non-linear effect depends on the number of rectifier stages used 
by each RFID chip [BOA 13].

3.4.4. Harmonic characterization 
The harmonic response levels were measured for the three chips until the 
fourth harmonic by performing the PSD analysis at the same frame response. 
The results are shown in Figure 3.31. As already discussed in section 3.3 and 
confirmed here, the third harmonic is predominant for all the chips under 
test. It is worth noting that, even until the fourth harmonic, a modulated 
response is detected. This becomes clearer for an input power above 3 dBm 
in the case of chips 1 and 3. The details of the activation power are shown in 
Table 3.5.

3.4.4.1. Harmonic treatment tests 
In this section, a treatment of the non-linearities is proposed by using an 
impedance tuner known as an antenna impedance emulator, as shown in 
Figure 3.24, and hereafter called the antenna part. In the design process of 
RFID tags, only the impedance value at the fundamental frequency is 
considered [AND 13]. Theoretically, this is enough to ensure the operation at 
the desired frequency. However, no special attention is paid to the harmonics 
produced by the chip. RF criteria state that the harmonics should be filtered, 
for example, in order to increase the purity of the RF-to-DC conversion 
performed by the rectifier part and thus providing a greater read range since 
a clean DC signal provides more power to the chip. The aim of this section is 
to evaluate the effects produced at the fundamental frequency by the  
non-linear behavior of the chip, by changing the matching condition between 
antenna part and chip in a wide range of frequencies. 
The experience is based on observing the chip response and its 
harmonics, by activating the real-time PSD analysis in the DSO (see Figure 
3.28) and by setting the impedance tuners to a position that produces a 
change in the level of the fundamental frequency and/or in its harmonics. 
This process can be considered as a practical experimentation of the HB 
method used in circuit simulators to analyze non-linear components  
[AGI 06, AGI 11, KEY 14]. 
The performance of the chip while tuning the impedance of the antenna 
part is evaluated. Figure 3.32 shows the harmonic responses of chip 1 until 
the fourth harmonic, in a scenario where the harmonics are increased by 
tuning the impedance of the antenna part. This is achieved at the expense of 
a 1.5 dB reduction on the chip sensitivity and 7 dB reduction on the chip 
response at the fundamental frequency. Table 3.6 compares the results 
before and after the harmonic treatment.

Figures 4.11 and 4.12 show the input impedance of chip 1 in both 
modulation states after the harmonic treatment for the fundamental and its 
third harmonic, respectively. These measurements were performed at the 
new activation power. At the third harmonic, the resistive part decreases, and 
the reactance becomes more capacitive compared to the impedance at the 
fundamental frequency. Moreover, the difference between the modulation 
states is lower which means that, in a radiating scenario, the ΔRCS [SKA 09] 
will be smaller than the one at the fundamental frequency.

Characterization Platforms for Passive RFID Chips and Tags     79 
The results presented in Table 3.6 clearly show that an increase in the 
second and third harmonic results in slightly diminished performance at the 
fundamental frequency. 
3.4.5. Result exploitation 
After the chip is completely characterized, it is possible to export the 
scattering parameters measured with the RFID-NTP for a wide frequency 
range. Therefore, antenna designers can use the scattering parameters in 
order to optimize the antenna design using an electromagnetic CAD tool  
and ensure, for example, the complete filtering of backscattered harmonics. 
Indeed, the complex reflection coefficient of the RFID tag ρ෤, defined in 
[3.9], can be calculated for each impedance state [NIK 07, BOL 10]:

[3.9] 
where ܼ௔ൌܴ௔൅݆ܺ௔ is the complex antenna impedance and ܼ஼ is the

Therefore, a trade-off or independent optimization of the read range (load 
factor (LF) defined in [3.10]) and/or the ΔRCS (modulation efficiency (ME) 
defined in [3.11]) of the RFID tag can be performed at the design stage

scavenging and reflecting states, respectively. 
On the contrary, it is interesting to note that both states of modulation are 
visible even at the third harmonic. This observation validates the hypothesis 
of redundant information originating on the same chip. Therefore, the design 
of a tag antenna radiating the fundamental signal and the third harmonic can 
be envisaged using the same LF and ME design parameter approach. It is 
worth noting the two main drawbacks to consider in the harmonic 
exploitation: (1) the low power of the third harmonic response and (2) the 
small ΔRCS.

3.5. Summary 
The uncontrolled non-linearity in the current UHF RFID technology 
allows the tag to generate harmonic signals carrying information without 
constraints to the EPC Global Class-1 Gen-2 standard. The analysis made in 
this chapter considers the entire tag as the EUT (antenna and RFID chip), i.e. 
radiated measurements, and also the chip alone, i.e. conducted measurements. 
Methods to configure the RFID air interface and to ease the spectral 
analysis of the tag response were described and later on used for the radiated 
and conducted chip characterization. The measurement procedures presented 
here introduce vector information about the signal allowing an evaluation of 
the RFID chip impedance in full operation mode and in a large frequency 
range. 
The performance of the RFID chip and the real effect of the harmonics 
were evaluated by measuring harmonic compensation with a practical 
emulation of the antenna impedance. The harmonic treatment experiments 
would be the analogy of the HB method used for the simulation of non-linear 
circuits. 
Subsequent lines of research can be undertaken by properly filtering the 
harmonics to improve the read range and/or the differential radar cross-
section with the benefit of generating the whole RFID tag in existing 
applications. The analysis of the non-linearity of UHF chips presented here 
can be extended to any kind of Class-1 Generation-2 RFID chip, and it can 
be taken into account for the tag antenna design. 
Besides, and contrary to traditional approaches, additional efforts to exploit 
the third harmonic response by the specialized tag antenna design promise 
new applications of and improvements to the existing ones, allowing a 
redundant communication from the tag to the reader. Nevertheless, the ability 
of the reader to collect and process harmonics should be enhanced to make this 
exploitation a reality. These topics together with experimental and parametric 
analysis are the core of Chapter 5.

Modeling the Harmonic  
Signals Produced by RFID Chips 
The main objective of this chapter is to perform an in-depth study of the 
non-linear behavior of passive RFID chips, and to show that the produced 
non-linearities can be exploited to benefit the operational techniques of 
passive UHF RFID systems. A theoretical analysis of the harmonic 
production from passive RFID chips and the effect of the matching network 
and the tag antenna on the backscattering harmonic is performed. A  
new harmonic tag model that offers a maximum profit from the signals 
generated by the chip at fundamental and third harmonic frequencies  
is proposed. The theoretical analysis is confronted with radiated and 
conducted measurements. 
4.1. Introduction 
As long as the antenna and the chip are independently designed  
[RAO 50], and due to the non-linear behavior of the RFID chip [NIK 09, 
DEV 05, BOL 10], the tag antenna will radiate some of the harmonic 
currents of the CW that feed the chip. These harmonics are also carrying the 
impedance modulation effect, notably producing then a redundant 
backscattering modulation. The underlying theoretical basis of these 
phenomena was explained and experimentally demonstrated in Chapter 3 by 
means of radiated measurements considering the whole tag and by 
conducted measurements in which a test bench was directly connected to the 
RFID chip.

82     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
In order to complete the experimental approach presented in Chapter 3, 
this chapter aims to perform a theoretical analysis of harmonic signals 
produced by the RF section of passive RFID tags. The analysis pinpoints in 
the operation of a traditional tag working at the fundamental frequency of 
the system (f0), and also in the operation of a new tag able to enhance the 
backscattered signal strength at its third harmonic (3f0), hereinafter the so-
called harmonic tag (HT). 
The chapter explains the harmonic production of passive RFID chips, and 
the effects of the matching network and tag antenna on harmonic 
backscattering phenomena. The theoretical analysis is performed in three 
stages: (i) the calculation of a general expression for the current in the 
rectifier part of RFID chips; the expression comprises fundamental and 
harmonic components; (ii) the study of the matching network used in 
traditional RFID tags in order to evaluate the harmonic backscattering 
strength; (iii) the study of a new matching network architecture that 
enhances the backscattering strength at 3f0 maintaining the operation at f0, 
therefore constituting the HT operation theory. The analysis presented in this 
section uses lumped components to model the operation of a distributed 
impedance matching network integrated in antennas used in passive RFID. 
4.2. Analysis of harmonic currents in RFID chips 
4.2.1. Review of Dickson analysis 
The most extended architecture used to study the rectification process in 
UHF RFID is the Dickson charge pump and its derived equations [DIC 76, 
USA 04, BAR 06, CUR 05]. Although the rectifier architecture used in this 
chapter is very similar to the Dickson charge pump, it has some important 
differences [BAR 09]. Since UHF tags operate with significantly lower 
signal levels and higher frequency than the original Dickson analysis, some 
modifications must be made to the RF-to-DC equation proposed by Dickson. 
The original Dickson analysis assumes constant forward voltage drop of the 
rectification device, the so-called “threshold voltage”, although this forward 
voltage drop is actually a function of the load current of the rectifier. This 
variation is not significant for large voltage swings across the diode as is the 
case for the charge pump application. However, in passive UHF RFID, the  
 
 

Modeling the Harmonic Signals Produced by RFID Chips     83 
RF input voltage is very small, on the same order of the forward voltage 
drop. As a result, the non-linear forward voltage drop has significant impact 
on the RF-to-DC equation. A parametric non-linear analysis theory has been 
developed to incorporate the effect of the non-linear forward voltage drop. It 
was first applied to predict the RF-to-DC conversion for single-diode 
rectifiers in [HAR 92] and was later expanded to multi-stage rectifiers in 
[DEV 05]. 
The multi-stage voltage multiplier model and the analysis method used in 
this chapter are supported by several works that use similar architectures to 
predict the RF-to-DC conversion for rectifiers in UHF RFID applications, 
being aware of the low RF input voltage present in this technology [DEV 05, 
KAR 03, DEV 05, SAN]. Figure 4.1 shows the RF section of a passive RFID 
tag with a two-stage voltage multiplier, hereinafter referred to as rectifier. 
The rectifier circuitry is composed of a cascade of N-stage voltage 
multipliers. 
 
Figure 4.1. Passive tag architecture 
Because of the non-linear effects of the rectifier part of the RFID chip, the 
current in the antenna ܫ௔௡௧ presents components at frequencies that are integer 
multiples of the operation frequency. Indeed, in the scavenging state, the  
 

84     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
input voltage induced in the tag antenna and then conducted to the rectifier at 
f0, generates an input current ܫ௜௡ dominantly constituted by the odd harmonic 
components of f0. Figure 4.2 shows the Schottky diode model and its different 
configurations for the analysis.

the 2N diodes are in parallel. d) DC equivalent circuit: the capacitors do not allow the

4.2.2. Calculation of the harmonic currents 
In order to determine the general expression of the input current to the 
rectifier, ܫ௜௡ in Figure 4.2(b), it is necessary to introduce the current–voltage 
expression of the diode:

where ܫ௦ is the saturation current of the diode, ܸௗ is the voltage at the diode

300 K. ்ܸൌ݇ܶ/݁, where ݇ is the Boltzmann constant, ݁ is the electron

It should be noted that this model does not consider the parasitic effects of

If the capacitors in the rectifier are well-dimensioned, with ܸ௜௡ being a 
sinusoidal voltage with a frequency f0 and an amplitude ܸ଴ at the input of the 
rectifier, it is reasonable to consider that the rectifier presents the following

[4.6] 
From [4.6], it is observed how the even RF components of ω଴ are 
eliminated due to the opposite sense of currents in each diode at each voltage 
doubler stage (RF analysis shown in Figure 4.2 (c)). In general, this 
phenomenon explains the odd harmonic predominance in voltage doublers. 
In addition, in an N-stage rectifier, the total capacitance, hereinafter called 
ܥ௘௤, is equal to 2ܰܥௗ, and if the matching network (Figure 4.1) is well-
dimensioned, the current contribution through internal capacitors ܥௗ in [4.6] 
is eliminated since ܥ௘௤ is compensated by the shunt inductance of the 
matching network. The operation and design of the matching network are 
detailed in the next section. 
The first components of the input current of the rectifier described in 
[4.6] are shown in Figure 4.3 in the logarithmic scale when using 
representative values ܰൌ6,  ்ܸൌ0.025 ܸ,  ܸ௨ൌ1 ܸ, and ܫௌൌ10–଻ A  
[AAZ 09]. It can be seen that the amplitude current component at f0 (i.e. I10) 
and the amplitude current component at 3f0 (i.e. ܫଷ଴) are close to each other.  
Focusing the analysis on the components at f0 and 3f0, Figure 4.4 shows 
the ratio ܫଷ଴/ܫଵ଴ in the logarithmic scale. The ratio is an intrinsic 
consequence of the non-linear nature of diode-based devices. From [4.6], the 
rectifier produces harmonic currents which the ratio does not depend on the 
parameters ܰ, ்ܸ, ܸ௨, ܫௌ but only on ܸ଴. From Figure 4.4, it can be seen, for 
instance, when ܸ଴/ܸ௧൒6 ሺܸ଴൒0.15 ܸሻ, the amplitude of ܫଷ଴ is half of the 
amplitude of ܫଵ଴ and they become closer as ܸ଴ increases. For values of  
ܸ଴൒0.44 ܸ, the difference between ܫଷ଴ and ܫଵ଴ is less than 1 dB. The  
non-linear effect in rectifier devices is higher when ܸ଴ increases, which leads 
to a current amplitude at 3f0 closer to the current amplitude at f0.

4.3. Third harmonic in traditional RFID tags 
4.3.1. Impedance matching network for f0 
Given the capacitive nature of RFID chips at f0 due to the diode-based 
rectifier circuit [DEV 05, BOL 10, SAN], an impedance matching network is 
always introduced between the RFID chip and a pure resistive antenna 
(dipole of approximately 73 Ω). Figure 4.5 shows the typical matching 
network for a passive RFID tag. The RFID chip impedance is represented by 
the parallel configuration of a capacitance ܥ௘௤ and a resistance ܴ௘௤. The first 
element of the matching network is the shunt inductance ܮᇱ that compensates 
ܥ௘௤ and represents the traditional inductive loop used in RFID antenna 
design [MAR 08] (ܥ௘௤ describes the capacitive nature of the RFID chip). 
Once the chip reactance is canceled, the remaining high shunt resistance ܴ௘௤ 
(approximately 1.8 kΩ [IMP]) needs to be transformed to the comparatively 
low series resistance of a dipole antenna, hereinafter ܴ஺ [BEH 98]. The LC 
network is often used to perform the transformation as follows: (i) ܥ 
transforms the shunt resistance of the RFID chip ܴ௘௤ to a smaller series 
value matching it to ܴ஺, being ܥൌܳ/ሺ߱଴ܴ௘௤ሻ; (ii) ܮ cancels ܥ, with 
ܮൌܴܳ஺/ω଴. The parameter ܳ defines the quality factor of the LC network 
and it is bounded to the resistance transformation ratio between chip and 
antenna. In other words, ܳ defines the performance of the LC network as a 
function of the power transferred between the antenna and the chip, and vice 
versa at f0, which is given by

Figure 4.6 shows the transmission coefficient of the LC network for 
different values of ܳ, keeping ܴ௘௤ fixed. A higher ܳ ensures a better power 
matching at 868 MHz, therefore higher isolation at frequencies different 
from f0.

For a color version of this figure, see www.iste.co.uk/andia/non-linearites.zip 
It is worth noting that the assumption of capacitive impedance for the 
chip (ܴ௘௤ and ܥ௘௤) and pure resistive impedance for the antenna (ܴ஺) is 
realistic. Indeed, passive RFID chips and rectifier diode-based circuits have 
in general capacitive impedance, typically of the order of 20 − j150, 
approximately 868 MHz [MAR 08, IMP, NXP]. Regarding the antenna, the 
analysis considers a resonant dipole with a dimension close to a half-wave 
length (i.e. zero imaginary component at the resonant frequency). 
4.3.2. Influence of Q in the backscattered signal at 3f0 
The effect of ܳ on the signal radiated by traditional tag antennas at 3f0 is 
modeled using the architecture shown in Figure 4.5. With ܸ௔௡௧ being the open 
circuit voltage of the tag antenna and ܸ௜௡ the input voltage of the rectifier, both 
at f0, and assuming a lossless matching network, the delivered input

Figure 4.8 shows the law decay of the power ܲଷ at 3f0 with respect to the 
power ܲଵ at f0, as a function of ܳ and the ratio ܸ଴/ܸ௧. Two major patterns 
can be distinguished:  
– the power level at 3f0 approaches the power level at f0 as the input 
voltage to the rectifier ܸ଴ increases; 
– the power level at 3f0 approaches the power level at f0 as ܳ decreases. 
It is expected that with a higher ܳ, the rectifier input voltage at f0 is also 
higher, which leads to a greater non-linear effect, thereby causing the 
rectifier to produce a higher component at 3f0. However, a higher ܳ also 
ensures a higher attenuation at frequencies different from f0. To summarize, 
when ܳ is higher, so, is the suppression of the power transmitted from the 
chip to its antenna at 3f0.

The harmonic power can be potentially radiated if the antenna structure 
allows it, i.e. profiting from the current distribution of harmonics in a 
specific antenna structure [AND 13]. According to the proposed model, a

traditional RFID tag having a dipole antenna structure, which has a current 
distribution at 3f0 different from zero at the input and a distributed matching 
network with ܳൌ4, radiates a signal at 3f0, i.e. 22.3 dB, which is lower than 
the signal at f0. This model explains why certain commercial tags backscatter 
a signal at 3f0 with stronger level than others, certainly depending on the tag 
antenna structure as evidenced in section 3.3 of Chapter 3 for the tag Rafsec 
MemoryStick [UPM].

The new element introduced is the series inductance ܮଷ௙ that resonates 
with both the original LC network and ܥ௘௤ at 3f0. The new matching network 
should be dimensioned choosing an ܮଷ௙ which does not affect the traditional 
operation at f0, i.e. ܮଷ௙ should act as a short circuit at f0. In the same way, the 
dimensioning criteria have to consider that the shunt inductance ܮᇱ should 
not intervene in the operation at 3f0, i.e. ܮᇱ should act as an open circuit at 
3f0. The first step to choose the ܮଷ௙ value is to calculate the inductance 
necessary to compensate the chip capacitance at 3f0 (inductive matching), 
and depending on the values of the original LC network, ܮᇱ should be  
tuned to resonate at 3f0. Realistic values for the proposed model are

distributed matching network that cancels the RFID chip reactance at f0 and 
3f0, the difference between the backscattered power by the HT at 3f0 and  
f0 depends only on the intrinsic non-linear behavior of the chip (Figure 4.4) 
and is shown in Figure 4.11(b) at a certain level of the input voltage ܸ଴.

Experimental tests reported in section 3.4 of Chapter 3 have shown the 
feasible enhancement of the signal generated by the chip at 3f0 using an 
antenna impedance emulator. The so-called harmonic treatments are based 
on emulating proper matching networks that could enhance the response at 
3f0 compared to the case of an optimum emulated antenna at f0 having the 
same chip. An enhancement of 11 dB on the response at 3f0 is reported to 
perform conducted measurements. 
4.5. Summary 
A theoretical analysis of the harmonics produced by the non-linear 
behavior of passive UHF RFID chips has been presented in this chapter. The 
analysis based on a modified version of the Dickson rectifier considers 
different input voltages and it is valid to analyze the chip behavior when low 
input signals such as the ones used in passive RFID are present. 

Modeling the Harmonic Signals Produced by RFID Chips     97 
This chapter has explained the particular predominance of even or odd 
harmonics depending on the architecture of the rectifier circuit, which 
determines the canceling or not of currents in the electrical analysis. Indeed, 
a single diode will produce all the harmonics with predominance of those 
ones of low order, i.e. the second harmonic. However, if the rectifier is 
composed of voltage doubler stages (where the number of diodes is a 
multiple of two), an odd harmonic predominance is present. 
The antenna–chip impedance matching is treated with a lumped network 
that models the operation of antenna structures that includes a distributed 
matching network. The theoretical analysis is confronted with the operation 
of traditional tags reported in Chapter 3. A new harmonic tag antenna model 
that comprises a matching network that fully exploits the fundamental and 
third harmonic signals generated by EPC Class-1 Gen2 RFID chips is 
introduced. The analysis of this new HT is also confronted with 
experimental harmonic treatment tests reported in section 3.4 of Chapter 3 
and confirms the feasible exploitation of the third harmonic signal of passive 
RFID chips. In order to give an example, the most intuitive application could 
be the exploitation of harmonic signals as information carriers that establish 
frequency diversity from tag to reader, without breaching the standard 
regulations. Such a concept establishes a potential foundation for new 
applications that the chip self-generated harmonic signal with redundant 
information can offer. This idea will be highlighted in Chapter 5 with several 
prototypes and also other possible concepts where the third harmonic is seen 
as an energy source.

Applications: Augmented RFID Tags 
This chapter unfolds, from an experimental approach, the new concept of 
exploiting the harmonic signals generated by the non-linear behavior of 
traditional passive UHF RFID chips. In this chapter, two innovative ideas are 
explored considering the third harmonic as either an energy source or an 
information source carrying the identification signal. Specifications, 
methodology and experiments are explained for two kinds of augmented 
tags: (i) tags with harmonic communication using the EPC Class-1 Gen2 
RFID protocol and (ii) tags with harmonic harvesting to feed supplementary 
low consumption electronics. Practical design aspects and evaluation metrics 
in compliance with standard regulations for EPC Class-1 Gen2 RFID are 
presented. The building of an equivalent low-profile circuit with RF 
performance similar to that of a commercial RFID chip is explained. The 
performance of the solutions is illustrated by simulation and measurements. 
In addition, a thorough parametric study is carried out for all the prototypes, 
especially with respect to the antenna structure, the kind of chip, the received 
power and the read range. 
5.1. Introduction 
As discussed in Chapter 1, RFID technology and UHF tags have reached a 
remarkable level of performance in terms of chip sensitivity, tag read range, 
inlay size and flexibility to fit a variety of items to be tracked. It is also a 
standardized technology that allows unitary identification and low cost of

production. These very interesting features favor the implementation of 
RFID solutions in thousands of applications and domains such as 
traceability, logistics and access control. RFID has become ubiquitous in 
industry and our daily life (ticketing, payment, passports, car keys, etc.). It is 
also intensively used for health and hospital monitoring and personal 
assistance. However, in all these applications, the duty of the tag is to return 
an ID to the reader and achieve the unambiguous identification only. Over 
the last few years, with the development and generalization of wireless 
solutions, new concepts have entered the field of applications. Among these 
concepts, the paradigm of the Internet of Things (IoT) is probably the most 
effective in terms of application management and optimization of 
performance. The perspective of RFID in terms of new paradigms and the 
IoT is more and more under consideration worldwide. Indeed, passive UHF 
tags are based on RFID chips that require –22dBm only for activation. They 
exhibit read-ranges of more than 25 meters. These performances allow them 
to appear as an ideal candidate to implement the last few meters of the IoT. 
To do so, the tags must be augmented in terms of functionalities to perform 
more than identification. The transformation of RFID tags into augmented 
tags is very effective for wireless networks. Indeed, the use of the 
standardized RFID communication protocol will allow designers to exploit 
the normalized RFID commands to define new commands suitable for 
monitoring augmented tags. There are several ways to transform a UHF 
RFID tag into an augmented tag. They can be grouped into three categories. 
The first one will exploit the sensitivity of the tag antenna to the physical 
change that appears in its near-field region. Such a technique can be used for 
sensing purposes. The second category involves the integration of an 
external device to the RFID chip like a sensor. This second category is more 
related to the behavior of the RFID chip and the variation of its electrical 
response as a function of some external parameters such as RF power and 
temperature. In that case, we exploit the non-linear properties of the RFID 
chip. Different methods of tag augmentation, based on non-linearities of the 
RFID chip, are discussed in the following sections of this chapter. It is worth 
noting that the augmentation becomes interesting if the cost of tags is 
maintained low and the interrogation system is enriched and updated by 
additional commands to collect the parameters related to the new 
functionalities acquired by RFID tags.

5.2. Harmonic communication in passive UHF RFID 
As partially introduced in Chapter 2, the study and exploitation of non-
linearity in diode-based devices is not new. Approaches based on a one-bit 
system in which the harmonic or intermodular components serve to indicate 
tag presence without a specific communication protocol are known as 
harmonic radar. Used as a tracking solution, the invention was patented in 
1975 [SHE 75] opening the path for several derived applications, e.g. in 
insect tracking [COL 04]. With the boom of RFID systems, the  
harmonic radar concept has been recently re-purposed. In [GOM 07,  
SON 14], a tag response is achieved by exploiting the intermodulation 
phenomenon of a diode. In [FAN 10], a specific non-linear RF circuit is 
developed with the aim of enhancing the harmonic strength compared with 
multiplier diodes used at 10 GHz. The circuit integrated to an antenna 
conforms to a harmonic transponder of one bit and later the transponder is 
used for accurate indoor ranging [YUN 14]. The authors of [RAS 14,  
RAS 14] have studied and generalized the design techniques for harmonic 
transponders based on a single detector or varactor diode. The concept was 
adopted for low-cost solutions using paper substrates and inkjet printing 
technology [ALI 10, ORE 11] or even an eco-friendly solution using an 
organic diode [VIR 14]. Another exploitation idea [ROM 09] proposes the 
detection of counterfeit RFID cards based on their electromagnetic 
characteristics rather than the digital information that they transmit. In this 
approach, one of the stages considers the electromagnetic signature that 
harmonic signals produce. Electromagnetic energy harvesting is an emerging 
field where the non-linearity of diode-based devices is also being exploited. 
The authors of [TRO 09, COL 14, BOA 13, BOR 14] have proposed power-
optimized waveforms to improve the range and reliability of RFID systems. 
By using specially designed signal waveforms at the transmitting terminal 
that somehow excite the non-linear diode behavior of rectifying diodes in a 
more efficient manner, the RF-to-DC conversion efficiency of the diode can 
be increased. In the same field, the work reported in [LAD 14] proposes a 
millimeter-wave rectenna at 35 GHz that also harvests the harmonic signals 
generated by its rectifier. The proposed solution enhances the RF-to-DC 
conversion efficiency. 
In the specific field of passive UHF RFID, the experimentation on 
backscattered harmonics was first introduced in 2009 [NIK 09], but no 
additional research efforts were followed, probably because of the evidenced 
low power level and limitations on the characterization method. 

102     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
Contrary to the conventional paradigm in RF communication circuits 
where non-linearities are undesired and their level is highly reduced  
[DEV 05, BOL 10], this section develops the concept of a new 
communication function by exploiting non-linearities of passive EPC Class-
1 Gen2 RFID chips. The exploitation of harmonic signals as information 
carriers establishes frequency diversity from tag to reader, without breaches 
in standard regulations. The benefit of the frequency diversity is the 
possibility to use a spectrum which has much reduced self- and multi-path 
interference, therefore countering multi-path and leakage effects at 
reception, but not a read range enhancement. The developed concept 
establishes a foundation for new potential applications that the self-generated 
harmonic chip signal with redundant information can offer. With such a 
motivation, this chapter aims to meet two specific objectives: 
– to define exploitation policies when the harmonic communication 
between the harmonic tag (HT) and the reader is envisaged. The policies 
treat regulation definitions, considerations on the reader side, metrics to 
evaluate the HT performance and design guidelines for the HT; 
– to explain the HT design and operation with a real HT design example 
and a deep parametric study at different powers, frequencies and with 
respect to read range performance. 
The theoretical analysis presented in Chapter 4 has shown the possibility 
of increasing the backscattering strength at 3f0, i.e. to exploit the harmonic 
generation of passive RFID chips by properly matching the impedance of the 
antenna. This section aims to present considerations on the use of HTs in a 
tag-to-reader harmonic communication regard. Indeed, it is intended to 
declare the diversity in frequency where signals from tag-to-reader at f0 and 
at 3f0 carry the same information. Aspects such as deployment regulations, 
harmonic reader operation considerations, HT evaluation metrics and HT 
design guidelines are unfolded. 
5.2.1. A review of the regulations 
5.2.1.1. Regulations at f0 
In order to make possible and favor the use of the HT, e.g. regarding the 
compatibility with other systems, the parent design policy is to respect current 
standards and local regulations on passive UHF RFID [EPC, ETS 08].  
 

Applications: Augmented RFID Tags     103 
In that regard, since dual-band operation is desired (at f0 from the passive 
UHF RFID system, i.e. in Europe 868 MHz and at 3f0, i.e. 2604 MHz), 
reader and tag spectrum mask regulations must be accomplished. 
No change is envisaged on the transmitter side of the RFID reader. In 
other words, HTs should operate with RFID readers that comply with the 
spectrum mask regulations [EPC 15]. In the same manner, the tag spectrum 
mask defined in [ETS 08] should be respected. The first side lobe of the tag 
response signal should not exceed the effective radiated power (ERP)  
of −20 dBm at f0, and nor should all the other spurious signals like its 
harmonics. 
5.2.1.2. Regulations at 3f0 
In Europe, the spectrum regulations allocate the frequency band of 2500–
2690 MHz to broadband mobile services (e.g. Long-Term Evolution (LTE) 
and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WIMAX) with 
transmitters of tens of watts and operation distances up to 4 Km) [ECC 12]. 
In other regions (e.g. where the harmonic frequency 3f0 = 2745 MHz), the 
band of 2700-2900 MHz is commonly allocated to meteorological and air 
traffic radar systems with high power (the equivalent isotropically radiated 
power could be in the order of 109 watts) [ECC 12, NTI 14]. Studies, based 
on worst case assumptions (i.e. line-of-sight conditions), have shown that 
there is potential interference from mobile services to radar and vice versa. 
This will depend on the deployed factors such as frequency separation, 
antenna orientation and distance (in the order of kilometers). Nevertheless, 
mobile and radar systems are still compatible [ECC 12]. 
Given the backscattering modulation nature of passive UHF RFID 
systems, even if the tag response at 3f0 is enhanced for the harmonic 
communication approach, it remains weak (the equivalent isotropically 
radiated power in the order of 10-11 watts at few meters) [AND 14] and does 
not represent an incompatibility issue compared with the possible radar 
effects over the mobile service. If reader and tag mask regulations are 
respected at f0, the operation at 3f0 ensures the compliance with regulations.

5.2.2. Harmonic reader considerations 
In a reader-to-HTs communication scenario, some considerations should 
be taken into account for the dimensioning of the harmonic branch receiver 
of an envisaged RFID harmonic reader. Specific details in the baseband 
treatment and the analog-to-digital conversion are out of the scope of this 
work, and can be taken as a future line of research. However, some 
directives on the harmonic RFID reader design can be stated. A critical issue 
in the design of traditional RFID readers (i.e. working at f0) is the 
suppression of the carrier wave signal that unintentionally leaks into the 
received path due to the use of common isolation techniques as circulator or 
couplers. The reader has to transmit a strong carrier wave signal to supply 
passive tags with sufficient operating power. The response of the tag on the 
other hand is generated by passive backscattering, which is achieved by a 
modulation of the RFID chip input impedance. As only a small fraction of 
the power incident upon the tag is reradiated, the signal received by the 
interrogator antenna is very weak compared with the transmitted carrier 
wave signal [MAY 09]. Therefore, the reduction of the transmitted leak is 
crucial and leads traditional reader architectures that aim to increase the 
reception sensitivity of RFID readers [MAY 09, LAS 09, MAY 09]. 
From measurement results in passive UHF RFID [AND 13], the carrier 
wave in reception at 3f0 is around 60 dB below the carrier wave at f0. Using 
harmonic backscattering, in case of a receiver at 3f0, the limitations imposed 
by the carrier wave leakage do not represent a great inconvenience. Indeed, 
the conditions are suitable to design a receiver with higher sensitivity than 
the traditional receivers at f0. Some noise may result from 3f0 leakage due to 
the synchronization circuitry at reception but it is much smaller than the 
circulator or coupler leakage at f0 [YUN 14]. As in traditional passive RFID, 
the overall system performance in the harmonic communication scenario is 
limited by the tag. Thus, exploiting the harmonic signal produced by RFID 
chips at 3f0 with the proper antenna design offers a gain in the tag-to-reader 
power link budget at 3f0. 
5.2.3. Harmonic tag design 
In the intention to integrate the antenna–chip impedance matching 
network directly in the antenna design, the RFID antenna design is widely 
documented 
(impedance 
matching, 
size-reduction 
techniques, 
etc.)  

Applications: Augmented RFID Tags     105 
[MAR 08, RAO 05]. In the case of the HT, the main difference with respect 
to traditional tag antennas is the dual-band operation. As discussed in 
section 4.4, the HT should include a distributed matching network that 
cancels the RFID chip reactance at f0 and 3f0. Depending on the envisaged 
application, some antenna parameters can be optimized with respect to 
others (size, directivity, materials, etc.). The HT design process is illustrated 
in a flow chart shown in Figure 5.1. As in traditional RFID [RAO 05], the 
design requirements are linked to the envisaged application (size, directivity, 
read range, operation conditions, materials of the tagged object, etc.). 
 
Figure 5.1. RFID HT antenna design process 
Having fixed the material, the design of an HT antenna begins by 
importing the scattering parameters of the chips in the scavenging state into 
a 3D electromagnetic simulator [AND 14]. The impedance of the RFID chip 

106     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
at 3f0 is still capacitive [AND 14], and therefore techniques similar to the 
inductive loop matching used at f0 can be applied. 
Regarding the antenna structures, useful designs and techniques used for 
rectennas and harmonic radar can be applied in the design of the HT 
antennas [HEM 14, SCH 14, RAS 14, RAS 14] because of the common idea 
of inductive compensation of capacitive diode-based circuits. Under this 
criterion, the chosen antenna structure should include two inductive loops, 
each one to cancel the capacitive effects of the chip at f0 and 3f0. The 
simulation is usually led by structure optimization based on the design 
requirements (impedance matching, antenna gain, read range, de-tuning 
effects). Starting with the impedance matching at f0 and after at 3f0, certain 
changes in the dimensions of the resonant structures at f0 could be necessary; 
nevertheless, the optimization by simulation facilitates the procedure once 
the structure operation is mastered. Finally, some prototypes should be 
fabricated and tested in order to validate the design requirements. 
5.2.4. Metrics to evaluate the harmonic RFID tags 
The evaluation of the HT performance is based on radiated measurements 
performed in a confined environment. Similar testing environments to those 
used for traditional passive RFID can be used [NIK 12], but some 
considerations should be made on the methods used, i.e. using power 
spectral density analysis (PSD) to quantize the HT response. Specific details 
about the measurement methodology and RFID air interface setting used to 
evaluate harmonic signals can be found in Chapter 3. A calibrated power 
budget should allow performing accurate measurements of the HT response 
at f0 and at 3f0. 
The tests reported in this chapter use the measurement setup shown in 
Figure 5.2. An anechoic chamber with bi-static configuration (1 m distance 
between horn antennas and the tag) is connected to the RFID Test-Platform 
(RFID-TP). The RFID-TP performs a PSD analysis in real time at f0 and at 
3f0. The results reported in this chapter consider the following directives 
regarding the power budget and measurements: 
– HT sensitivity at different frequencies: the necessary ERP power sent 
by the RFID-TP to activate the HT is considered (i.e. transmitted power 
before the antenna). The ERP power is calculated using the power approach 
defined in [FED 15]. Since the measurement setup is completely calibrated 

Applications: Augmented RFID Tags     107 
and controlled, the ERP is known. This consideration allows us to evaluate 
the HT performance independently of the kind of reader antenna used;  
– HT response at different RFID-TP powers: the HT response is 
evaluated in terms of the isotropic received power (i.e. values calibrated to a 
receiving antenna of 0 dBi gain) as a function of the Equivalent Isotropically 
Radiated Power (EIRP) transmitted by the RFID-TP. Furthermore, in the 
measure of the HT response, the PSD analysis considers the addition of 
power from both first side lobes of the modulated response, contrary to 
calculations explained in Chapter 3, where only one side lobe is considered. 
It is worth noting that the harmonic response exists conditioned to the 
existence of the response at f0;  
– HT read range performance: the read range is calculated using the law 
of decay 20log(d), where d is the distance between tag and reader beyond 
1 m (1 m is defined by the calibrated setup in the anechoic chamber) and 
considering a radiated level of 35 dBm EIRP for the RFID-TP [ETS 08]. 
Therefore, the calculation of the HT response at f0 and at 3f0 beyond 1 m is 
possible and it is compatible with the methods used in the literature [RAO 
05]. For the read range evaluation, a 6 dBi antenna gain is considered for the 
EIRP of the RFID-TP. This analysis allows the representation of the read 
range for a given sensitivity of the reader receiver at f0 and 3f0.

configuration; b) anechoic chamber configuration

5.2.5. Application case and experimental results: harmonic tag 
design example 
The requirements for the HT in this example are: (1) a maximum read 
range at f0 = 868 MHz and f0 = 2604 MHz; (2) an antenna size comparable to 
the dimensions of existing RFID antennas, and (3) the use of low-cost 
materials and prototype techniques. The materials chosen are polyethylene 
terephthalate (PET) with 3.2 permittivity and 0.05-mm thickness for the 
substrate as in traditional RFID tag inlays and aluminum as a trace 
conductor. Regarding the impedance at both bands, the design example uses 
two kinds of chips: (1) G2XM NXP SOT1040-AA1 [NXP 13] with 
measured impedances of 19−j178 Ω at f0 and 9.2−j54.2 Ω at 3f0 and (2) a 
Monza chip with measured impedances of 20−j170 Ω at f0 and 3.4−j29.4 Ω 
at 3f0 (conducted measured details in Chapter 3). The next step is to choose 
an antenna structure as reference where the double inductive loop matching 
technique can be applied. The following section pinpoints the design 
procedure for two kinds of antennas. 
5.2.5.1. Antenna design 
5.2.5.1.1. Yagi-Uda structures 
A modified Yagi-Uda antenna following similar structural approaches as 
reported in [SCH 14] was designed. Figure 5.3 shows the Yagi-Uda HT 
prototype composed of three main parts:  
– Fundamental resonator: the resonant structure at f0 is a curved dipole 
conforming a loop (Figure 5.3(a)), that, at the same time, serves as an 
inductive loop for the impedance matching at f0 [MAR 08]; 
– Harmonic resonator: the resonant structure at the third harmonic is a 
dipole joint to an inductive loop (Figure 5.3(b)), for the conjugate chip 
impedance matching at the third harmonic; 
– Reflector: a reflector at the rear of the antenna (Figure 5.3(c)) serves to 
increase the directivity at the harmonic frequency; and, at the same time, its 
position and dimensions allow tuning the resistance of the antenna. 

Applications: Augmented RFID Tags     109 
 
Figure 5.3. HT prototype. a) Fundamental resonator;  
b) harmonic resonator; and c) reflector 
The harmonic resonator and the fundamental resonator are joined by two 
parallel lines, where in each line, one port of the chip is connected. The 
antenna can be tuned by trimming the dipoles and the reflector, the distance 
between the parallel lines a3, and the size of the inductive loops. Table 5.1 
summarizes the optimum design parameters.

110     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
The simulated reflection coefficient Γ of the harmonic antenna 
normalized to the chip impedance is depicted in Figure 5.4. The conjugate 
impedance chip matching was achieved at two frequencies, with Γ = −14.5 dB 
at 868 MHz, and Γ = −10.1 dB at 2604 MHz. This dual-band matching 
represents the main difficulty during the HT design process, and triggers in 
small bandwidths. The simulated realized gain at 868 MHz and at 2604 MHz 
is of 2.5 dBi and of 2.9 dBi, respectively. It is worth noting that different 
dual band antenna structures can be used [JIA 10, HUC 13]. 
The simulated directivity in the plane E (xy) and plane H (zy) is depicted 
in Figure 5.5 and Figure 5.6, respectively. The pattern at f0 is comparatively 
closer to an omnidirectional pattern. By contrast, at the third harmonic, the 
pattern is slightly directive due to the antenna structure which improves the 
harmonic performance in one direction.

In order to enhance the performance of the HT and profiting from the 
options that Yagi-Uda structures offer, a new version of the antenna above 
presented, and with the same materials, is also developed. This new version 
incorporates a director element to increase the directivity of the antenna. 
Figure 5.7 shows the structure for the Yagi-Uda HT with a director, which is 
now composed of four main parts:  
– fundamental resonator: it has the same operation functions described in 
the HT version without a director (Figure 5.7(b)); 
– harmonic resonator: it has the same functions described in the first 
version (Figure 5.7(a)); 
– reflector: it has the same serving functions as the previous version 
(Figure 5.7(c)); 
– director: it is located at the front of the antenna (Figure 5.7(d)), which 
aims to increase the directivity at the harmonic frequency.

The position and dimension of the director are optimized by simulation, 
with the same tuning policies as the HT version without a director, 
mentioned above, being followed for other structure elements. Table 5.2

Table 5.2. Yagi-Uda antenna type with a director: design parameters 
With this structure arrangement, a hybrid directivity of the HT with a 
director is composed of:  
– a quasi-omnidirectional pattern at f0, i.e. the directivity at 868 MHz is 
now 2.18 dBi, slightly higher than the 1.8 dBi reported in the HT without a 
director; 
– a directive pattern at 3f0, i.e. the directivity at 2604 MHz is 6.31 dBi, 
being also slightly higher than the 6 dBi reported in the HT without a 
director.  
Readings at f0 and/or the third harmonic frequency for the HT with hybrid 
directivity introduce an information data unit, because they consider the HT 
positioning with respect to the reader. Figure 5.8 and Figure 5.9 show the 
directivity of the HT with and without a director in the plane E (xy) and 
plane H (zy), respectively.

5.2.5.1.2. LF-inverted structures 
A modified LF-inverted antenna is designed [JIA 10] on substrate PET 
with permittivity of 3.2 and 0.05 mm thickness. Each part of the planar 
inverted-F structure is designed and optimized to be able to resonate at the 
UHF band centered on 868 MHz. The inverted-L part of [JIA 10] becomes 
here a complete loop going back to the ground, each part of which, along 
with the distance between the inverted-F, is optimized to have a resonance at 
2604 MHz. The capacitive impedances seen by the antenna at f0 and at 3f0 
are reduced by creating inductive loops in the ground. Figure 5.10 presents 
the structure of the antenna hereafter called HT2. Table 5.3 summarizes all 
the optimum design parameters for this structure.

Results for directivity in the plane E (xy) and plane H (xz) are depicted in 
Figure 5.11 and Figure 5.12, respectively. With this structure arrangement, 
the HT is also composed of a quasi-omnidirectional pattern at f0 and a 
directive pattern at 3f0, with 1.44 dBi and 6.01 dBi directivity, respectively.

5.2.5.1.3. Theoretical analysis of the HT sample 
The HT with Yagi-Uda structure is chosen for this analysis. In order to 
estimate the Q factor of the distributed matching network included in the HT 
example, from [4.7] it is necessary to know Req and RA for each HT. Req for 
each chip is obtained by converting the series RC impedance measured to a 
shunt RC equivalent model. Thus, an Req = 1.7 kΩ and an Ceq = 1.03 pF is 
obtained. The calculation of RA is not straightforward, given that antenna 
structures already consider an integrated matching network, and its input 
impedance in a resistive design is unknown. Nevertheless, simulations were 
carried out to approximate the values of RA. In the case of the HT example, 
the simulation mainly considers: (1) a fulfilled conductor for the 
fundamental resonator, shown in Figure 5.3(b), avoiding the internal 
inductive gap effect and (2) a feeding port at the middle of the fundamental 
resonator. An RA = 61.7 Ω is obtained for the chosen antenna, allowing us to 
calculate a quality factor Q at f0 , equal to 5.2 and Q* the one at 3f0, equal to 
2.1 for the HT prototype. In agreement with the analysis presented in section 
4.4, the HT example offers a similar treatment to the signals produced by the 
chip at f0 and at 3f0.

5.2.5.2. Experimental results 
In this section, results from parametric analysis on the HT prototypes are 
presented. The methods and setup are detailed as follows: 
– HT under test: four different configurations of HT using the two kinds 
of antenna structure described in section 5.2.5 are studied. Henceforth, the 
notation HT1 refers to tags with the Yagi-Uda structure, and HT2 refers to 
tags with the LF-inverted structure. In addition, from the study performed in 
section 3.2, and as a comparative reference, the so-called commercial T5  
tag with the best performance at the harmonic band was chosen for the 
study. The four HT configurations under test are detailed in Table 5.4. 
– HT prototyping: all the HTs were fabricated on a PET substrate with 
3.2 permittivity and 0.05 mm thickness. The common trace conductor is 
aluminum, and the chip mounting technique is flip-chip [RAO 00]. For each 
HT configuration shown in Table 5.4, five samples were fabricated with the 
same procedure and conditions in order to realize a fabrication sensitivity 
study. To be meaningful, only the most representative results will be 
reported.  
– Measurement setup: the performance of the prototypes was evaluated in 
an anechoic chamber with the same RFID Test Platform (RFID-TP) and 
configuration used in section 3.2 (1 m distance between RFID-TP and tag). 
It is worth noting that the RFID-TP considers the communication protocol 
between reader and tag while tests are performed [EPC 15]. 
– The HTs under test were evaluated under a parametric analysis 
performed on three main parameters: (1) performance of the HTs at the UHF 
RFID band, the results of which are shown in section 5.2.5.2.1; (2) 
performance of the HTs at different powers sent by the RFID-TP, at f0 and at 
3f0, the results of which are shown in section 5.2.5.2.2; and (3) performance 
of the HTs at different reading distances, at f0 and at 3f0, the results of which 
are shown in section 5.2.5.2.3. 
– Results for each one of the studied parameters are organized considering 
four main features: (1) fabrication sensitivity, (2) bandwidth, power or read 
range, in each parameter case, (3) kind of chip used, and finally, (4) the 
performance of the HT compared with the commercial tag T5. 
– All figures use the same legends to represent each HT configuration in 
a different type of line. The straight line represents the results for the tags of 
type HT1 (or HT2-M), the dashed line represents the results for the tags of

type HT1-D (or HT2-N) and the symbol line represents the results for the tag 
T5. Different colors of the same type of line correspond to a different sample 
of the same HT configuration.

5.2.5.2.1. Performance of the HTs in the UHF RFID band 
Following the nomenclature presented in Table 5.4, Figure 5.13 and Figure 
5.14 show the Effective Radiated Power (ERP) transmitted by the RFID-TP, 
as a function of the frequency, respectively, for the Yagi-Uda structure and the 
LF-inverted structure. Each HT sensitivity is evaluated in terms of the ERP 

120     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
(transmitted power before the antenna). The ERP evaluation allows us to 
perform a general analysis, independent of the kind of reader antenna used. 
The results of the analysis are summarized as follows: 
– Fabrication sensitivity: design directives for all HTs imposed a first 
resonance centered in 868 MHz. From Figure 5.13 and Figure 5.14, in both 
structure cases, a de-tuning effect is observed, mainly due to the capacitive 
effect introduced by the flip-chip mounting process. Despite the evidenced 
de-tuning, the performance of the HTs is always evaluated at 868 MHz and 
its third harmonic. 
Comparing both kinds of structures, HT1 tags are most sensible to the 
manufacturing process due to the smaller dimensions. As shown in  
Figure 5.13, for the same structure (HT1 or HT1-D) and the same kind of 
chip, an approximately 15 MHz variation in the resonance can be observed.  
– Bandwidth: with 20 MHz, the narrower bandwidth is for HT1 tags, 
compared with the 65 MHz bandwidth for HT2 tags. 
– Kind of chip: tags with a Monza 5 chip (HT2-M) in Figure 5.14 have 
better performance in terms of the lowest activation power in the whole 
frequency band studied. These results are a consequence of the different 
sensitivities reported in data sheets for both kinds of studied chips. 
– Comparison with commercial tag: the commercial tag T5 reports a 
wider bandwidth. Regarding the activation sensitivity, HT2-M tags have a 
better performance than T5.

5.2.5.2.2. Performance of the HTs at different powers transmitted by 
the RFID-TP 
The HT response is evaluated in terms of the isotropic received power 
(values calibrated to a receiving antenna of 0 dBi gain) as a function of the 
EIRP transmitted by the RFID-TP. Furthermore, in the measure of the HT 
response, the power spectral density analysis considers the addition of power 
from both first side lobes of the modulated response, contrary to results 
reported in Chapter 3, where only one side lobe is considered. 
Figures 5.15 and 5.16 show the results at f0 for the tag configurations of 
type HT1 and tag configurations of type HT2, respectively. Figures 5.17 and 
5.18 show the same results at 3f0. It is important to note that the harmonic 
response exists conditioned to the existence of the response at f0, as a non-
linear phenomenon of the RFID chip. The results of the analysis are 
summarized as follows: 
– Fabrication sensitivity: considering the analysis frequency at 868 MHz 
and its third harmonic, the effects due to the manufacturing process in the  
 
 
 

122     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
HTs performance is analyzed. A direct effect on the activation power that 
relies on the antenna–chip impedance matching is reported. From Figure 
5.15, the tags of type HT1 (having all the same chip) are more sensitive with 
a 5 dB difference in the activation power (horizontal axis) than those of type 
HT2, as shown in Figure 5.16. The tags of type HT2 are in general less 
sensitive to manufacture processes due to straight and relatively large 
structure details. Indeed, the distributed matching network dimensions for 
the tags of type HT1 (Table 5.1: lx, ly, w, a3, a4, b4, b5 and b6) are shorter 
than those for the tags of type HT2 (Table 5.3: g1-g6). The same behavior is 
repeated at the third harmonic frequency, as shown in Figures 5.17 and 5.18; 
– Tag response level: once activated, the tags of type HT1, shown in 
Figure 5.15 (all having the same chip), present a 5 dB higher response level 
than those of type HT2, shown in Figure 5.16. The reason is the higher gain 
of Yagi-Uda designs. Among the tags of type HT1, as expected, HT1-D tags 
have a 2 dB higher response level than HT1-S tags, due to the director 
element. The behavior is also repeated at the harmonic frequency, shown in 
Figure 5.17, reaching in the best case a third harmonic response of −77 dBm 
for HT1-D. Lower harmonic responses are shown for the tags of type HT2 in 
Figure 5.18.  
– Kind of chip: besides the lower activation power of Monza 5 chips, the 
kind of chip also influences the hysteresis of the tag response. Indeed, for 
NXP-UCODE chips, the tag response remains quasi-constant upon 
activation even if the reader power increases as can be seen for HT1 and 
HT1-D in Figure 5.15 and HT2-N in Figure 5.16. On the contrary, for 
Monza 5 chips, the tag response increases with the reader EIRP, reaching a 
constant or saturated level at higher powers. A similar behavior is also 
observed at the third harmonic frequency in Figures 5.17 and 5.18. This 
behavior is intrinsically related to the internal (and proprietary) circuit 
architecture of each manufacturer, specifically the voltage regulator design 
[DEV 05]. 
– Comparison with commercial tag T5: in all cases, the proposed HTs 
have better performance (lower activation power and higher tag response) 
than the commercial tag T5, at f0 and 3f0.

5.2.5.2.3. Parametric study on read range 
Using the passive RFID read range equation [RAO 05] and considering 
the measured sensitivity of each HT, the tag response level at the receiver 
side is measured at f0 and at 3f0. These measures consider a power 
transmitted by the RFID-TP (EIRP) of 35 dBm [ETS 08]. This analysis 
allows the representation of the tag read range for a given sensitivity of the 
receiver. 
Figures 5.19 and 5.20 show the results at f0, for the tags of type HT1 and 
type HT2, respectively. Figures 5.21 and 5.22 show the same results for the 
third harmonic frequency. The results of the analysis are summarized as 
follows: 
– Fabrication sensitivity: the manufacturing process introduces an effect 
on the read range, which is different on each kind of HT configuration. From 
Figure 5.19, as expected, the tags of type HT1 are the most sensitive with a 
difference of 5.5 m read range (horizontal axis). The tags of type HT2 are in 
general less sensitive to this parameter. A similar behavior is observed at the 
third harmonic frequency in Figures 5.21 and 5.22. 
– Read range: when a simultaneous operation is aimed, the third 
harmonic response limits the read range of HTs at f0. For the case of HT1 
tags in Figure 5.21, a read range larger than 5 m at the harmonic frequency is 
achieved if a receiver sensitivity of −90 dBm is attained [WAN 07]. For the 
case of HT2 tags in Figure 5.22, a read range of nearly 4 m at 3f0 is achieved 
with the receiver sensitivity of −90 dBm. 
– Kind of chip: the chip sensitivity favors the read range at f0, reaching 
for the Monza 5 chip a maximum of 9 m (HT2-M in Figure 5.20) if the 
receiver sensitivity is −70 dBm. Contrary to the harmonic frequency, the 
hysteresis effect of NXP-UCODE chips triggers at higher harmonic response 
levels, which favors the feasibility of the receiver sensitivity. 
– Comparison with commercial tags: higher read ranges at f0 and its third 
harmonic were achieved by the proposed HTs compared with tag T5. From 
Figure 5.21 or 5.22, if the receiver sensitivity was −90 dBm, barely 2 m read 
range is calculated for the commercial tag T5.

5.2.6. Summary: harmonic tag 
Operation concepts for harmonic communication considering current 
regulations, harmonic readers, design guidelines for HTs and methods for its 
evaluations are discussed in section 5.2.5. The work on exploiting the 
response at the third harmonic by specific tag antenna design was 
experimentally demonstrated using HT design examples. The evaluation of 
the prototypes reports a simultaneous read range operation at fundamental 
and third harmonic frequency larger than 5 m. 
The parametric study on the prototypes shows that the HT performance 
can be enhanced with the antenna structure and also the kind of chip. The 
frequency analysis shows that the LF-inverted tags have a wider frequency 
bandwidth than Yagi-Uda tags. Regarding the harmonic response strength, 
tags with the Yagi-Uda structure present a higher response of 5 dB than 
those with the LF-inverted structure. The kind of chip used is clearly an 
advantage in the HT performance enhancement. The chip sensitivity suits the 
read range at the fundamental frequency, reaching in the suitable case 9 m 
for Monza 5 chips, with a reader sensitivity of −70 dBm. Contrary to the 
harmonic frequency, the hysteresis effect of NXP UCODE chips suits the 
feasibility of the reader sensitivity in a third harmonic reception scenery 
because of the clear, higher and constant harmonic response produced by 
this kind of chip. The HTs present higher sensitivity to the fabrication 
process due to the significant electrical dimensions that the structures take 
around the third harmonic. Therefore, special care and mastery of the 
sources of losses are necessary in the fabrication stage to predict the 
performance by simulation. 
Regarding the benefits of the contribution, they are based on the 
frequency diversity operation that uses the modulated third harmonic signal 
produced by the chip, where the spectrum has much reduced self and multi-
path interference. The redundant signal offers to counter multi-path and 
leakage effects at reception. Contrary to the traditional efforts in passive 
RFID, it should be noted that the main contribution of this work is to have a 
second communication channel from tag-to-reader and not to increase the 
read range. 
 

Applications: Augmented RFID Tags     129 
The next section will focus on a different approach for the exploitation of 
the deeply studied harmonics: electromagnetic harmonic energy harvesting. 
5.3. Harmonic harvesting: empowering the RFID tag 
In this section, the second proposition of augmented tags is presented. 
We introduce a new concept enabling the association of a passive UHF 
RFID tag with a commercial sensor, and this, without use of additional 
energy source. The idea relies on the introduced paradigm of the exploitation 
of the harmonics (namely, the third harmonic) produced by passive RFID 
chips to provide frequency diversity, as depicted in section 5.2. Here, a new 
method for exploiting the third harmonic is proposed. It involves harvesting 
the power carried by these commonly wasted harmonic signals to later 
supply power to a sensor. 
This section recalls some theoretical foundations concerning the 
harmonic exploitation in passive RFID and describes the proposed concept 
of harmonic harvesting. The design methodology of the RFID tag harmonic 
harvester, which is based on the study of a non-linear equivalent circuit of 
the RF front-end of passive RFID chips, is detailed. Special attention is 
dedicated to the matching network design. The experimental validation of 
the proposed RFID chip model and the standard metrics to evaluate the 
harvesting performance of the designed circuits are presented. Finally, in 
order to validate the feasibility and to evaluate the performance of the 
augmented tag, an application example in which the energy harvested from 
the third harmonic of a RFID chip is used to supply power to a commercial 
temperature sensor. 
5.3.1. Harmonic generation in diode-based circuits 
Most of the energy-harvesting circuits contain a low-pass filter (LPF) at 
the input that allows the fundamental frequency to enter, and rejects the 
harmonics back into the energy harvester. This technique, very common in 
high-efficiency energy harvester design, allows the maximization of the 
conversion efficiency by confining all the higher order harmonics between 
the LPF and the DC pass filter. Harmonic treatment techniques such as the 
Class-E or Class-F rectifiers [GEO 10] help to confine the energy carried by 
harmonics in order to optimize the conversion efficiency of rectifier circuits.  
 

130     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
The techniques are based on presenting impedances to the rectifier circuit (at 
fundamental and harmonic frequencies), enabling the stored energy in the 
diode not to be self-dissipated, but rather released to the load, and therefore, 
enhancing its RF-to-DC conversion efficiency. The harmonic treatment can 
be addressed in a design stage by simulation tools such as the harmonic 
balance (HB) [GEO 10]. These efficient design techniques can also be used 
in passive RFID tags if antenna and RFID chip are co-designed and 
optimized together as a single device as in the case of efficient rectennas 
[YON 04]. 
However, for industrial interests and practicality of RFID labels 
manufacturing, RFID chips and RFID tag antennas are separately designed 
and optimized only at the regional frequency band of operation (e.g. 868-870 
MHz in Europe or 902-928 MHz in US, 950-956 MHz in some places in 
Asia). Therefore, and in agreement with the theory and measurements 
described in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4, passive RFID chips generate 
harmonics and some RFID tag antennas can radiate these harmonics. 
5.3.2. Techniques to empower the RFID chip and rectifier circuits 
in general 
A state of the art of the techniques to enhance the rectification efficiency 
of electromagnetic energy harvesters is reviewed below: 
– Energy sources and harmonics: with the deployment of wireless sensor 
networks that become ubiquitous, an essential challenge is the energy 
autonomy of sensors. In parallel, in the field of passive RFID where tags are 
wirelessly powered by the reader, the transformation of tags in sensor tags 
(notably tags with embedded sensors) also requires new energy needs. In 
addition, the use of ecofriendly solutions is nowadays a great and strong 
requirement for all electronics design. Besides energy-harvesting solutions 
exploiting sources such as solar energy, human body temperature  
or vibration, two types of approaches based on technically similar 
electromagnetic (EM) sources are conceptually opposed: exploitation of 
ambient EM sources such as Wi-Fi or digital TV signals, often referred to as 
EM energy harvesting (EEH), versus the use of intentional signals as an 
energy source, the so-called wireless power transfer (WPT), whose RFID 
can be seen as a particular case. 

Applications: Augmented RFID Tags     131 
– Harvesting harmonic power: a large number of investigations are being 
focused on wireless power or remote-powering technologies. Therefore, 
WPT has become a refreshed and refocused technique for powering 
electronic devices over distances. A rectenna circuit including antenna and 
rectifier is the most vital component of a microwave power transmission 
system that wirelessly receives microwave power and converts it into DC. 
Rectenna efficiency is mainly determined by its rectifier circuit. Hence, 
designing a high-performance rectifier is a point of interest since it is 
directly related to the quality of a WPT system. Few works are focused on 
the utilization of harmonic signals with energy-harvesting intentions. A 
millimeter-wave rectenna with high-efficiency rectifier operation for 
medium and low levels of RF input power has been proposed in [LAD 14]. 
The second harmonic signal generated by conventional rectifiers operating at 
medium range of RF input power is exploited by a modified voltage doubler 
rectifier that is able to harvest the energy from harmonics. The DC outputs 
of the harmonic harvester and the fundamental harvester are added up at the 
end in a common DC load. 
– Signal design for WPT: several works have proposed the use of specific 
signal in a WPT in order to increase the RF-to-DC conversion efficiency of 
rectifying circuits. The basis behind these phenomena is the non-linear 
behavior of rectifying diodes under different input signals. Indeed, using 
specially designed signal waveforms at the transmitting terminal (that 
somehow excite the diode non-linear behavior in a more efficient way), the 
RF-to-DC conversion efficiency of the diode is increased. 
The phenomena can be generalized by the use of time varying envelope 
signals as an efficient WPT technique, since they are capable of activating 
the rectifying devices for lower average input power levels, compared with 
signals of constant envelope and the same average power. Therefore, signals 
with large peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs) provide higher RF-to-DC 
conversion efficiency than single carrier signals, meaning that for the same 
targeted distance, we need to transmit less power. 
The PAPR (dB) of a waveform can be defined as

௠௔௫ቀ௫మሺ௧ሻቁ
〈௫మሺ௧ሻ〉
 
[5.1] 
 

132     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
where ݔሺݐሻ is the time domain waveform of the signal of interest and the 
symbol “< >” refers to the time average operator. In [COL 14], an interesting 
study regarding the PAPR of three different signals compared with a single 
tone signal was presented. Each signal was used as an input for a rectifier 
circuit optimized at 433 MHz and the results indicate the mentioned 
phenomenon: the higher the PAPR is in the input signal, the higher is the 
rectifier RF-to-DC conversion efficiency. Most of the reported results in the 
literature consider signal levels above –30dBm. However, this behavior 
might be power dependent on a threshold power, for instance, with very 
ultra-low power (below –30 dBm), the PAPR effect might not be significant 
for the rectifier efficiency. 
The signal design for efficient WPT shows that even though high PAPR 
signals are not desired in communication systems due to the distortion that 
these signals suffer when amplified in the transmitter, in EEH systems high 
PAPR signals are desired for improving the RF-to-DC conversion efficiency 
of rectifiers. 
5.3.3. Third harmonic exploitation in passive RFID 
The non-linear i-v characteristic of a diode-based circuit imposes a 
current signal to be composed by fundamental and harmonic components as 
a function of the voltage. Three milestones summarize the theoretical 
analysis of a diode-based RF front-end of passive RFID chips: 
– the analysis of the current produced by passive RFID chips including 
the fundamental and the harmonic components as a function of the signal 
level coming from the reader shows that the current magnitudes  
of fundamental and third harmonic frequencies (so-called f0 and 3f0, 
respectively) become comparable when the input power increases; 
– based on the inductive coupling matching technique, traditional 
matching networks included in tag antennas can attenuate the third harmonic 
by a factor of 17 dB to 32 dB, depending on the antenna quality factor. In 
some cases, the attenuated third harmonic component is backscattered and 
can be detected by the reader, as discussed in Chapter 3; 
 
 

Applications: Augmented RFID Tags     133 
– the design of dedicated matching networks produces an increase in the 
third harmonic backscattering level allowing the design of an RFID tag with 
frequency diversity, i.e. a tag that generates a redundant signal for tag-to-
reader in addition to the traditional one at the fundamental frequency. 
Considering an ideal case, the backscattered level only depends on the 
harmonic production feature of the used chip. Experimental read ranges of 
4.5 m have been reported in section 5.2 for the HT operating at both 
frequencies. 
Instead of re-radiating the information carried by 3f0 as presented in the 
previous section but considering the same theoretical foundations, this 
section proposes a new approach to exploiting 3f0 by means of harvesting its 
carried energy to supply power to attached low-consumption electronics. 
5.3.3.1. Optimal integration of harvesting sections 
The system architecture of the augmented tag is depicted in Figure 5.23. 
It is mainly composed of: (i) the RFID section operating at f0 responsible for 
the RFID communication in compliance with the EPC Class1 Gen2 
standard; (ii) the harmonic harvesting (HH) section operating at 3f0 in charge 
of the power harvesting of the wasted 3f0; (iii) a three-port matching network 
(TPMN) that aims to efficiently redirect the signals at f0 and 3f0 between the 
RFID section, HH section and the tag antenna. 
With similar principles to those used for the design of Class-E or Class-F 
rectifiers, the impedances presented at the RFID section and EEH section 
inputs at fundamental and harmonic frequencies are determined by the 
TPMN operation. The design of the TPMN can be driven by optimization 
tasks thanks to the spectral analysis performed in an electric simulator as 
presented in the next section. The design of the augmented tag aims to 
achieve an optimal performance in terms of wireless communication for the 
RFID section (i.e. maximizing the read range) and DC power generation in 
the HH section (i.e. maximizing the RF-to-DC conversion efficiency). It is 
worth noting that the design of the HH section must be led by the 
cohabitation with the RFID section and its exploitation, considering that the 
performance at a given power level may be different for each section.

Figure 5.23. Proposed RFID tag harmonic  
harvester, the so-called augmented tag 
In order to efficiently integrate the harmonic harvester circuit to a passive 
UHF RFID chip, this section details the design methodology of the 
augmented tag in four sequential steps: (i) the first step is the analysis and 
design of the RFID section based on an equivalent RF front-end of an RFID 
chip; the equivalent model allows us to accurately emulate the non-linear 
operation of the chip by simulation and to efficiently design the whole 
augmented tag; (ii) the second step is the design of the HH section 
considering an estimated input power, i.e. that of 3f0; (iii) the third step is the 
design of the TPMN considering the non-linearity of both the sections, RFID 
and HH; and (iv) the last step is the integration of RFID and HH sections 
with the TPMN to form the augmented tag depicted in Figure 5.23. The 
RFID reader is modeled by an RF source at 868 MHz (corresponding to the 
European band). ADS Keysight tools are used for all simulation studies. 
5.3.3.1.1. RFID chip model 
The RF front-end responsible for the non-linear behavior of a passive 
RFID chip, i.e. its rectifier part, is modeled in order to ensure a coherent 
behavior compared with commercial passive chips. The model is driven by the 
emulation of the input impedance in a wide frequency range including f0 and 
3f0, in order to describe its non-linear features such as harmonic generation 
and impedance power dependency. This feature leads us to consider a specific 
input power from which the design is optimized [GEO 10, YON 04]. The  
 

Applications: Augmented RFID Tags     135 
input impedance of the EM43235 RFID chip in the scavenging state is 
measured with an input power of 0 dBm using similar methods to those 
presented in section 3.3. This input power ensures a 3f0 product exhibiting a 
comparable level, in logarithmic scale, to the one reflected at f0 (see  
section 3.2), besides being enough to activate the RFID chip. The EM43235 
chip is chosen because of its size (TSSOP8 package) that offers an easy 
manipulation in a hybrid modular system. 
Considering datasheet and Spice parameters for all components, a diode-
based voltage doubler with four stages constituting a rectifier circuit with a 
configuration like the one used in the Dickson charge pump to design RFID 
chips [DEV 05] is used to emulate the RFID chip behavior. Figure 5.24 
compares the input impedance of the measured chip with the one of the chip 
model showing an acceptable coherence. 
 
Figure 5.24. Input impedance of the measured chip  
(EM4325) and the associated proposed model 
The optimization of the RF-to-DC conversion efficiency of the RFID 
chip model is performed for a 0 dBm input power at f0, considering the 
circuit matched to a 50 Ω RF source. At this stage, all the lumped 
components of the chip model are defined. A final optimization is performed 
when all sections are connected; as it will be explained in section 5.3.3.2, 
this last optimization does not change the defined RFID chip model. The 
topology and component values of the passive RFID chip model are reported 
in detail in Figure 5.25.

11.4 nH, L5 = 5.25 nH; and a harvesting section with D1, C3 = 2pF, RL3F = 3.3 kΩ 
5.3.3.1.2. Harmonic harvester section  
In order to harvest the power carried by 3f0, a simple rectifier circuit 
based on a single Schottky diode topology is chosen because of its higher 
conversion efficiency compared with multistage topologies [BOA 13]. An 
HH load of 3.3 kΩ is chosen as design requirement because it represents the 
load value of the sensor that will be connected in the application example 
(section 5.3.4). Considering manufacturer parameters, the RF-to-DC 
conversion efficiency of the HH section is initially optimized to –10 dBm 
input power at 3f0 considering the circuit matched to a 50 Ω RF source. The 
only parameter to set here is the DC capacitance C3. A final optimization is 
performed when all sections are connected, as will be explained in section 
5.3.3.2. The topology and the component values are reported in Figure 5.25. 
5.3.3.1.3. Three-port matching network – TPMN 
The TPMN shown in Figure 5.26 has three functions: (i) it matches the 
RFID chip impedance (port 2) to a 50 Ω input at f0 (port 1) ensuring the 
power transfer from the antenna towards the RFID chip; (ii) it redirects the 
3f0 from the RFID chip (port 1) towards the HH section (port 3); and (iii) it 
isolates the antenna input (port 2) from the HH section (port 3) at f0.  
Lumped TPMN 
The non-linear impedances of the chip model and the HH section are first 
determined by large-signal S-parameter (LSSP) simulation. The chip model 

Applications: Augmented RFID Tags     137 
impedance is then matched to the 50 Ω input (RF source) at 0.868 GHz 
through L’1 and C’1. Then, the RFID section using the chip model and the 
HH section impedances are matched at 2.604 GHz by L’2, C’2 and L’3. This 
configuration triggers in the preliminary matching network shown in Figure 
5.26(a). This first configuration does not ensure good f0 isolation at the HH 
section, and could decrease the activation threshold of the RFID chip. 
Therefore, a second structure including inductors L4 and L5 is designed to 
overcome this problem. A final LSSP optimization using this configuration 
is run to obtain the final values of the TPMN shown in Figure 5.26(b).

Distributed TPMN 
Owing to the reduced quality factor of the commercial lumped 
components and the unavailability of their exact required values, based on 
the lumped circuit shown in Figure 5.26(b), a distributed TPMN in 
microstrip technology is designed in order to maximize its performance. 
Duroid 5880 substrate with dielectric permittivity of 2.2, loss tangent of 
0.0009 and thickness of 0.8 mm is used for the prototype with dimensions 
illustrated in Figure 5.27. The reflection coefficients of ports 1 and 3 are 
shown in Figure 5.28(a), and that of port 2 is shown in Figure 5.28(b). 
Transmission coefficients S31, S21 and S32 are shown in Figure 5.29. Their 
values are as expected, and they finally validate the operation principle of 
the TPMN.

5.3.3.2. Harvesting the third harmonic 
The optimum harvesting of the third harmonic is performed by 
integrating the RFID section, HH section and the TPMN to operate all 
together. The integration is simulated using HB analysis. A parametric study 
of the operation of the augmented tag in a wide power range is performed by 
simulation. Setting a power sweep from –20 dBm to 10 dBm at the input at 
f0 (i.e. port 1), the Power Spectral Density (PSD) at the input of the chip 
model (i.e. port 2) and at the input of the HH section (i.e. port 3) is reported 
in Figures 5.30 and 5.31, respectively. 
Piled rows at a given frequency represent the power variations due to the 
sweep power setting. As an illustrative example, when the f0 power injected 
in port 1 is 10 mW, the f0 power conducted at the input of the chip model is 
9.6 mW (Figure 5.30), which demonstrates a good TPMN operation 
transmitting from port 1 to port 2. With the same input power, the conducted 
power at the input of the HH section at 3f0 is 180 µW and the one coupled at 
f0 is only 0.5 µW (Figure 5.31), which confirms the good TPMN isolation 
performance between ports 1 and 3 at f0. The negative values shown in 
Figure 5.30 at 3f0 represent the direction of the signal with respect to the 
output of port 2 (negative values are entering into the TPMN). Its behavior is 
better observed in Figure 5.32, which shows the 3f0 power generated by the 
chip model and calculated at its input (i.e. port 2) as a function of the f0 input 
power. When the f0 input level is 10 mW, the 3f0 power reflected back into 
the TPMN and redirected towards the HH section (i.e. port 3) is 198 µW.

entrance to the harvesting section versus the input power source (dBm) 
Figure 5.33, which unfolds the piled rows observed in Figure 5.31 at 3f0, 
represents the power variation entering into the HH section as a function of 
the f0 input power. Positive values represent the signal flowing in the 
direction of the harvester. From the 198 µW reflected back at port 2, 180 µW 
enter into the HH section and 18 µW are lost in the transmission path (i.e. 
from port 2 to port 3). It is worth noting that these losses are non-linear and 
are significantly lower at low input power levels as shown in Figures 5.32 
and 5.33. Once the operation of the TPMN, considering the RFID section 
(using the chip model) and the HH section connected, is validated, the RF-
to-DC conversion efficiency of each section is optimized by analyzing the 
PSD at f0 and at 3f0 at ports 2 and 3. The only optimization parameters are 
the TPMN dimensions and the value of C3. Optimized results are analyzed 
and compared with the experimental ones in the next section. 
5.3.4. Application case and experimental results 
5.3.4.1. Evaluation of the chip model 
To experimentally validate the proposed design, the first step is to verify 
the behavior of the chip model compared with the real RFID chip sample. 
Two prototypes, one using the chip model and the other using the chip 
sample, are realized using a similar 50 Ω matching network at 
f0 = 0.868 GHz as represented in Figure 5.34. Figure 5.35 compares the 
measured reflection coefficient (S11) of both prototypes. The results indicate 
a relatively good agreement despite a slight shift of the resonant frequency: 
at f0 = 0.868 GHz, the S11 is –14 dB for the chip model and –11 dB for the 
real chip.

model and real chip circuits matched to 50 Ω at 868 MHz 
5.3.4.2. RF-to-DC conversion efficiency using the chip model 
The objective is to evaluate the performance of the HH section circuit in 
terms of RF-to-DC conversion efficiency using the equivalent model of the 
RFID chip. It is worth noting that the evaluation is only possible for the case 
with the chip model because the load of the commercial RFID chip is not 
accessible. For this study, the efficiency is evaluated by comparing the cases 
when only the RFID section is present using the chip model (i.e. the 
considered reference circuit) and when the RFID section using the chip 
model and the HH sections are present (i.e. augmented tag). 

Applications: Augmented RFID Tags     143 
The conversion efficiency is classically defined as the ratio between the 
DC power (ܲௗ௖) consumed by the RL load and the RF power (ܲோி) at the 
input of the circuit. For the reference circuit and the augmented tag, the 
respective efficiencies ߟ௥௘௙ and ߟ are distinguished by the corresponding ܲௗ௖ 
as follows:

[5.3] 
where ܲோி@଴.଼଺଼ is the RF input power at 0.868 GHz, ܲௗ௖_ோ௅ is the power 
dissipated in the load of the chip model circuit and ܲௗ௖_ோ௅ଷி is the power 
dissipated in the load of the 3f0 harvester. Figure 5.36 shows the two 
considered prototypes and the measurement setup composed of a Speedway 
RFID reader that generates a 0.868 GHz signal, an attenuator that is used to 
perform the analysis at an input power ranging from -20 dBm to 10 dBm, 
and a DC-meter voltage.

Figure 5.37. RF-to-DC conversion efficiency of the RFID chip model  
compared with one of the augmented tags calculated as  
in (1) and (2), respectively 
Figure 5.37 shows the conversion efficiency as a function of the input 
power for the two considered prototypes. As the 3f0 level varies with the 
input power at f0, the conversion efficiency of the reference circuit and that 
of the augmented tag for input power levels lower than –5 dBm is similar to 
each other. On the contrary, above –5 dBm, the efficiency is higher for the 
augmented tag because of the higher 3f0 power level produced by the chip. 
The maximum conversion efficiency measured for the reference circuit is 
45%, and for the augmented tag (using the chip model), it is 48%, both at 
10 dBm input power and 0.868 GHz.  
5.3.4.3. RF-to-DC conversion efficiency using a real RFID chip 
The objective of this section is to evaluate the harvesting performance  
of the 3f0 harvester. In this case, the chip model is replaced by the real  
chip sample using the same TPMN used for the model as it is shown in 
Figure 5.38. 
Figure 5.39 compares the measured DC power harvested from 3f0 using 
the real RFID chip sample and the simulated one using the chip model, as a 
function of the f0 input power at port 1.

Figure 5.38. Augmented tag using a real RFID chip 
 
Figure 5.39. DC power harvested from the third harmonic signal  
rectification as a function of the input power source (dBm) 
A maximum power of 39 µW is obtained with the augmented tag using 
the real chip, confirming the validity of the presented design methodology. 
The simulated conversion efficiency for the HH section can be calculated 
from Figure 5.33 (RF input power) and Figure 5.38 (DC output power); for 
instance, at 10 dBm input power and 0.868 GHz, the efficiency is 44%. 
It is worth highlighting that the measured activation threshold of the 
augmented tag, using the setup of Figure 14, is –7.6 dBm, which represents 
an acceptable read range of 5.3 m as estimated in [RAO 05]. It is expected 
that, at this power level, the harvested energy from 3f0 will be almost null as 
shown in Figure 5.33.

5.3.4.4. Harmonic harvesting to power a temperature sensor 
Finally, the objective is now to exploit the sole harmonic harvested power 
by the augmented tag to energize a commercial temperature sensor 
(PSG03551), besides establishing a standard RFID communication. The 
operation is possible thanks to the use of a power management module 
(BQ25504EVM-674) that performs three main functions: (i) the DC–DC 
boosting (active above 320 mV at the input); (ii) the power storage (using a 
100 µF capacitor); and (iii) the output voltage regulation (set to deliver 1 V 
at the output). The temperature sensor consumes a power of 60 µW in 
sensing mode every 10 seconds. The measured input impedance of the 
power management module connected in series with the sensor is 3.3 kΩ.

a commercial temperature sensor: a) augmented tag;  
b) power management module and c) temperature sensor 
 

Applications: Augmented RFID Tags     147 
The setup used in order to evaluate the sensing application in harsh 
conditions is depicted in Figure 5.39. A Speedway RFID reader driven by a 
portable computer (PC) is used to communicate with the augmented tag. 
Regarding the tag side configuration, a 50 Ω UHF monopole antenna is 
connected to the port 1 of the prototype using the real RFID chip, the DC 
output of the HH section is connected to the DC input of the power 
management module, and its output is connected to the temperature sensor. 
In addition, a DC meter is used to measure the voltage delivered by the HH 
section. With a distance of 80 cm between the antenna reader and the 
prototype, and setting an EIRP of 35 dBm in the reader, the HH section is 
able to deliver 320 mV of DC voltage and the power management module 
starts operating and activates the sensor. It is worth noting that at distances 
higher than 80 cm, the sensor is not activated but the RFID communication 
remains established up to a distance of 5 m. 
5.3.5. Summary: harmonic harvesting  
Section 5.3 has presented a relevant new concept based on the energy 
harvesting of wasted harmonic signals produced by standard passive RFID 
UHF chips. The approach involves the exploitation of the third harmonic 
signal generated by a traditional passive RFID chip to produce an additional 
source of power. To design the proposed system, a diode-based voltage 
multiplier circuit is used as the non-linear RF front-end model of a passive 
UHF RFID chip. Furthermore, a specific three-port matching network is 
designed and optimized to properly distribute the different involved signals, 
i.e. to obtain an RFID tag able to provide DC power to an associated sensor 
at the same time as communicating with the reader. The presented 
simulations allow the detailed study of the device integration, in particular 
the efficient redirection of the third harmonic signal from the RFID chip to 
the harmonic harvester circuit. The introduced models for the chip and the 
complete system are also experimentally validated. The system performance 
is fully characterized in terms of DC power and RF-to-DC conversion 
efficiency. Simulated results agree well with the measurement. 
In terms of performance, considering a 3.3 kΩ load, a DC power of  
39 µW is harvested from the third harmonic produced by the RFID chip,  
at 10 dBm input power at the fundamental frequency of 868 MHz in  
Europe. Finally, the proposed system is used to supply DC power to a low 

148     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
consumption temperature sensor. All this was performed without any other 
energy source than the third harmonic produced by the RFID chip.  
Moreover, the concept demonstrated here can be adapted to any other 
RFID chip once it is accurately characterized. As the sensitivity of recent 
chips can be better than –22 dBm [IMP 16, IMP 17], it is expected that 
different scenarios of application can be developed, including the harvesting 
of the weak third harmonic emitted by the reader. Besides, more complexity 
and compactness can be introduced in the RF matching section. Among the 
possible applications, the harmonic harvesting can be used for passive beam 
steering in the tag side. Indeed, as explained in [NIK 17], by switching the 
load of a parasitic radiative element between capacitive and inductive 
impedances, the beam of a director element, tuned next to it, can be steered 
in two opposite directions, i.e. the parasitic switches between the director 
and the reflector. The passive beam steering in the tag could solve many 
reading problems when dense tag sceneries prevent 100% tag detection. In 
this context, a low-consumption switching circuit like the one in [NIK 17] 
can be feed harvesting the harmonic RFID signals. 
5.4. Conclusion 
This chapter discussed the exploitation of non-linear RFID chip 
characteristics to design some augmented tags that are able to achieve more 
functions than standard UHF tags. Of course, the developed augmented tags 
are fully compliant with existing regulations and standards, in particular the 
EPC C1 GEN2 [EPC 15]. To design augmented tags, we exploited the third 
harmonic “naturally” generated by the rectifier section of the RFID chip. 
Two quite different study cases have been considered: harmonic tag and 
harvesting tag. 
The new functionality added by the HT is primarily channel diversity. 
Indeed, without any change in the architecture of the RFID chip, and 
adopting a proper design of the tag antenna to make it operate at both 
fundamental and third harmonic frequency, the tag will backscatter its 
information at the third harmonic too. Therefore, a channel diversity is 
possible with HT. Several scenarios exploiting this channel diversity can be 
defined. They are primarily enabled by the specific design of the dual band 
tag antenna. It is remarkable to note that the read-range at the harmonic 

Applications: Augmented RFID Tags     149 
channel is quite comparable to the read range at the fundamental frequency, 
as it has demonstrated by measurement.  
The new functionality added by the harvesting tag regards the collection 
of a certain amount of power that is usually wasted. Such “additional” power 
is mainly the power generated at the third harmonic frequency due to the 
non-linear response of the rectifier of the RFID chip. At least three different 
scenarios can be envisaged. In the first scenario, the power at the third 
harmonic is rectified and re-injected to empower the RFID tag, for instance, 
to the DC input of chips that have a battery-assisted port. In the second 
scenario, the generated third harmonic is first mixed with an external signal 
like Wi-Fi before rectification and finally feeding the battery-assisted port. 
Such a mixing operation allows the optimization of the conversion-to-DC 
efficiency as it has been demonstrated in [COL 14]. In the third scenario, the 
generated harmonic signal is collected via a passive matching network, then 
rectified and the DC power is used to feed an external circuit like a low 
power sensor. This concept has been demonstrated with a commercial 
temperature sensor.  
It is worth noting that the field of application is larger than the examples 
discussed herein. While the demonstrations presented in this chapter are 
based on a standard RFID chip, it is obvious that RFID chips can be 
designed in order to optimize the exploitation of these harmonics. Despite 
the constraints and technology limitations, the future looks very promising 
for the RFID technology because of its ability to implement the IoT. 

Conclusion 
An Old Technology with a Bright Future 
As Harry Stockman concluded in his landmark paper published in 1948, 
“Evidently, considerable research and development work has to be done 
before the remaining basic problems in reflected-power communication are 
solved, and before the field of useful applications is explored.” Nowadays, 
even if RFID is a widespread technology, it also has solid arguments and 
remarkable potential in terms of new applications and unexpected new 
functionalities. More than seven decades after the invention of the “Thing” 
by L. Theremin, the evolution of RFID, from an identification technique to a 
more ubiquitous and context-aware technology, has been growing very 
rapidly, in particular since the 2000s. 
After the early RFID devices developed in the 1960s for electronic article 
surveillance (EAS), implanted tags for tattooing and identification of pets, or 
toll systems, several technology advances allowed the integration of all the 
RFID circuitry in the passive chip. One of the major developments was that 
an UHF RFID system was performed and patented in the 1990s by IBM 
engineers. The same decade witnessed the emergence of standards, which 
favored the deployment of RFID, in particular for logistics and traceability 
sectors. Some years later, RFID became a part of our everyday life with 
applications in ticketing, access control and e-papers, and so on.. In all these 
developments and applications, only the capabilities of unitary identification 
of RFID were exploited.

152     Non-linearities in Passive RFID Systems 
Coupling the RFID with other technologies such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and 
GPS decoupled the potential of RFID applications, known before as a simple 
identify enabler, and initiated the pre-birth of a ubiquitous and context-aware 
system. Indeed, data fusion and processing allowed the engineers to build 
smart applications which are able to provide more information as well as to 
deliver some predictions that help to make decisions and take specific 
actions. In other words, it is neither more nor less than the concept of the 
Internet of Things (IoT). 
The implementation of the IoT in the real world requires the availability 
of a huge number of node devices, probably some tens of billions. Such 
nodes, in addition to unitary identification capability, should exhibit 
important features such as wireless communication, no battery, sensing 
capabilities and localization, potentially based on green technologies and 
recyclability. Hopefully, they should be as cost-effective as soft and flexible 
labels. Considering the previous features, the only technology that can fit 
them nowadays is the passive RFID technology, in particular in the UHF 
band, for which the read range has recently exceeded 28 m, enabling plenty 
of applications in indoor environments. So, UHF RFID is probably the 
cornerstone for the implementation of the last few meters of the IoT. 
To acquire new functionalities, the hardware and software components of 
the RFID tag should be reinforced and passive ID tags transformed into 
augmented tags. Three complementary methods can be considered for such 
evolution.  
The first method consists of adding specific hardware and circuitry which 
are able to provide extra functions such as sensing. In most cases, such an 
approach requires additional power to feed the added circuitry; therefore, the 
important feature of a batteryless solution is no longer possible. 
The second method exploits the properties of the tag antenna and its 
sensitivity to any change in its near-field region. Such a change can be 
reinforced by loading the antenna with a material sensitive to environmental 
parameters such as moisture, temperature and pressure. This capability has 
been demonstrated by several research groups worldwide. Even if this 
approach is more complex and more challenging than the first method, it 
continues to be considered in several R&D projects. 

Conclusion     153 
The third method is based on exploiting the characteristics of the RFID 
chip, in particular its non-linear response that is generated by the rectifier 
section of the chip. This is the topic discussed in this book. It is 
demonstrated that it is necessary to consider the generation of harmonic 
signals by the rectifier with sufficient power for enabling new functions of 
the RFID tag, without losing any of the standard duties of the tag. By 
exploiting the third harmonic signal, this book reports new functions such as 
channel diversity, energy harvesting and sensor feeding. This third tag 
transformation method appears to be more profitable and rich in terms of 
applications. Indeed, the recent advances in RFID chip technology, 
especially in terms of better sensitivity and new functions such as  
auto-tuning capability, will enable the design of augmented tags and  
allow the implementation of unprecedented smart applications in the near 
future. This is why we can claim that RFID is “an old technology with a 
bright future”.
