 Introduction to SAP Business 
Analytics 
 Analytics is the driving force in today’s business—be it health care, marketing, telecommunications, or 
retail—and, hence, the most vital part of any organization’s strategy. While there are many books that target 
analytics in parts, this book aims to lay down the end-to-end bits of analytics that any organization can 
implement. 
 As the title suggests, the book concentrates on SAP Business Analytics business gains, key features, 
and implementation. In order for organizations to have a 360-degree view of their myriad technologies and 
technical solutions, there has to be a strategy in place to converge all the information into one platform. This 
book explains both the strategy and technical implementation for gathering and analyzing all information 
pertaining to an organization. 
 Key features of the book include the following:
• 
 A 360-degree view of an organization’s data availability and methods to gather and 
analyze the same 
• 
 Strategies that have to be in place to gather relevant data required from disparate 
systems 
• 
 Details about the SAP Business Analytics suite of products 
• 
 Technical implementations to gather data from disparate systems, such as ERP and 
CRM, and mould the information to gain business insights 
• 
 Examples of real-world business cases 
• 
 End-to-end technical implementation of the SAP Business Analytics suite of 
products 
• 
 Real-life practical examples of the technical challenges faced  
• 
 Examples of different industry domains 
 The audience for this book includes Analytics strategists, business intelligence (BI) managers, BI 
architects, business analysts, and BI developers. 
 The book provides a practically oriented knowledge base for implementing SAP Business Analytics 
projects, from understanding the business gains of driving BI at an enterprise level to the how-tos of a BI 
project.

 CHAPTER 1  
 Introduction to Business Analytics 
 Information is advantageous. The more  information we have, the better informed our decisions are. We are 
inundated with information or data in today’s world. With about 40% of the world’s population using the 
Internet, and with that number growing every second, data is ubiquitous. We have moved from being an 
analog world to a very digital one. E-commerce, newspapers, the Internet of things (IoT), music streaming—
all generate huge amounts of data. The art of combining every data footprint and gaining actionable insights 
from that huge cache of data, which helps businesses grow, improves customer experience, and generates 
revenue, is known as business analytics. 
 The intelligence generated from data adds value to businesses, by generating leads, retaining customers, 
increasing revenue generation, gaining competitive advantage, and improving business operations. The data 
from social media helps businesses understand their customers better. By listening to what their customers 
have to say about the products and services they offer, businesses can determine if they are losing customers, 
owing to their competitors’ products fulfilling the consumers’ needs in a much better way.  Market analysis 
data helps organizations to identify new consumer segments that need to be tapped, unexplored markets, 
potentially lucrative geographical segments, and spending trends of consumers and consumer-response 
trends regarding different campaigns. The inventory, web, and other device’s log data helps to promote and 
improve inventory management, data security, fraud detection, IT operations, and online response times, 
which, in turn, result in better utilization of resources, improved consumer experiences, and innovative 
business operations. Business analytics is about providing insights, about driving businesses intelligently—
and in a fact-driven manner. Previously, data resided in silos, and it was next to impossible to combine sales 
data with inventory data in an automated way. It required many manual adjustments, resulting in a long, 
tedious process. But with the advent of business analytics, data integration between different systems is 
relatively easier and provides a holistic view of an enterprise organization’s data. 
 The  process of gathering, combining, exploring, storing, predicting, and utilizing data, and the 
attendant requirements of a robust IT infrastructure to integrate disparate systems such as order-
management systems, ERP, CRM, billing, customer care, market research data, etc., to derive data-driven 
conclusions, is known as business analytics. Business analytics is paramount for organizations wanting to 
keep abreast of the digital revolution that has taken the world by storm. Only those organizations that invest 
in business analytics will lead the pack, as today’s consumers demand personalized attention, while, at the 
same time, their attention span is very short, and there are many competitors vying for the same market. 
 The different processes that analytics encompass are as follows:
• 
 Data storage 
• 
 Data integration 
• 
 Data analysis 
• 
 Data mining 
• 
 Predictive analytics 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO BUSINESS ANALYTICS

• 
 Measuring campaign effectiveness 
• 
 Measuring online behavior through web analytics  
• 
 Data science 
• 
 Master data management 
• 
 Data security and compliance policies 
• 
 IoT 
 To distinguish the abundance of data from every digital touch point, terms such as  big data and  data 
science were coined. But analytics existed way before big data came into the picture. Earlier business analytics 
was known as reporting, dashboard, MI (Management Information) reporting, decision support systems, data 
warehouses, and the like, but it was and is basically data presented in a manner that makes it easy for users 
to arrive at decisions and predict outcomes. Big data and business analytics are being used synonymously, 
but analytics can be implemented irrespective of the amount of data. Any business that has the need for 
improvement—be it in terms of reducing cost, increasing data monetization, enhancing business processes—
should start capturing and analyzing data from relevant systems, in other words, turn to business analytics! 
 The  applications  of analytics are manifold, not merely to web analytics or financial data analysis. 
Analytics is being used to save human lives, by analyzing data from wearable devices that measure vital body 
statistics. This data is also used to further research and development of medicines. Analytics is being used 
in smart homes, providing centralized control of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. 
The data from such systems is analyzed to optimize power utilization. In the retail field, data about customer 
purchase history is being used to send out personalized recommendations to customers. Travel companies 
thrive on good customer reviews, to attract more customers, and data from social media sites has become 
very important in gauging customer sentiments about products and services. 
 With our increased  online presence , we leave a lot of digital footprints all over the Internet—when we 
purchase things, stream movies and music, or participate in online courses or social media. More and more 
companies have begun analyzing that digital footprint data to gain insights into their business. The more 
companies know about their customers, the more they can personalize the products and services they offer to 
their customers. It is not only the data generated by the businesses that is interesting but also that regarding 
customers’ likes and dislikes that can be gathered from social media platforms and business partner sites. 
 But because analytics is about data, data security and protection laws should be abided by. In short, 
analytics is a mélange of several processes like the ones named. Analytics requires integrating several systems 
to enable a holistic view of customer life cycle. Analytics requires data storage management, data security 
compliance systems, predictive modeling functionalities, and neat and interactive data visualization abilities. 
 Implications of Business Analytics 
 Business analytics provides fact-based actionable insights about business data. Fact-based because the data 
is real, collected from the business processes, and customer interactions. Common examples of data-driven 
insights are
• 
 Demographics of customers, by segmentation 
• 
 Popularity of products bought by customers, by analyzing sales data  
• 
 Inventory management, by querying inventory systems 
• 
 Online behavior, by analyzing web analytics data 
• 
 Targeting of customers for revenue generation, based on their purchase history, by 
analyzing historical sales data 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO BUSINESS ANALYTICS
3
• 
 Product recommendation to customers, based on their previous online behavior, by 
using predictive analytics 
 In order to be able to gain the above insights, many technical systems have to be integrated for data 
mining. Data analysis requires data from order management to web analytics to CMS (Content Management 
System)  data , some of it being required to be analyzed in real time. Business analytics implementations 
not only generate revenue and let organizations know their customer needs better but also require that 
organizations have clear strategies, appropriate IT systems that are easy to integrate, and control over their 
products and processes. Defining business rules, processes, and products at an enterprise level that can be 
used as reference data is known as master data management, thereby avoiding confusion. Many organizations 
that have a global presence use different nomenclature for the same processes and products. Implementing 
both a local and a global definition for terms and mapping them to each other is a good practice. 
 For example, in an enterprise organization, payment methods can have both global and local 
definitions. At a global level, payment methods might be broadly classified as
• 
 Web payment 
• 
 Mobile payment 
• 
 Credit card 
• 
 Bank transfer 
• 
 Phone pay 
• 
 SMS (Short Message Service) 
• 
 Company agreement 
• 
 Web payment platform 
 But local definitions could be country-specific, such as in the case of Swish, a payment method used 
exclusively in Sweden. But it could be mapped to a bank transfer. Maintaining the data at both global and 
local levels allows flexibility and analysis of data at different levels. If, for example, a business requirement 
is to follow up on the total number of bank transfers globally, this also can be achieved locally. For example, 
the number of bank transfers using Swish in  Sweden can be also analyzed globally. Business analytics, 
although an IT process, is mainly for the business side, so it should be an area of shared competence 
between IT and business, with typical teams consisting of data architects, data scientists, business 
intelligence developers, and business analysts who liaise with marketing and sales teams and business 
controllers or with chief digital officers and other management staff, based on the business case. 
 Most organizations, even today, have separate business analytics and business divisions, which 
communicate to each other only when the need arises for a business requirement that transcends both 
business and IT. Traditionally, business analysts have analyzed functional requirements to translate these 
to technical specifications, while data analysts are more technical, gathering, cleansing, and analyzing 
data. To increase the analytics throughput of a company, it is vital to combine the business and analytics 
competencies, to be able to analyze the data from a business perspective, so as to draw conclusions about 
consumer behavior, find trends, and, accordingly, implement business decisions with targeted marketing 
campaigns. It is, therefore, good to have business analysts in the marketing and sales divisions, or to train 
sales and marketing managers in analytics, so that they are able to analyze data themselves. There are many 
self-service business analytics tools available that require little or no IT intervention and allow nontechnical 
business users to analyze and slice and dice data in order to gather insights. 
 Successful businesses are the ones that consistently achieve their  KPIs (key performance indicators). 
KPIs are a way of measuring results for a business, by analyzing the main business drivers. The main 
business drivers are not only revenue-generation channels but also business process optimization, cost 
reduction, optimal resource utilization, and an effective product management life cycle. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO BUSINESS ANALYTICS

 KPIs can be defined by
• 
 Pre-defined business processes, revenue margins, and product life cycle milestones  
• 
 Strategic business process optimization, cost effectiveness, and product launches 
guided by quantitative measurement methods  
• 
 Analyzing and comparing the achieved goals and revenue against the set goals    
 Having the right business analytics strategy, based on business goals, is of significant importance. 
Once the business goals and KPIs are clearly defined, a  business analytics strategy can be put in place, 
suited to the business requirements and the need for data analysis. Every organization has unique 
requirements and, therefore, its analytics strategy, which takes into account data storage methodologies, 
the means of data access—such as APIs (Application Programming Interface) or ETL (extraction, 
transformation, and load) , data-visualization tools, and latency and data redundancy to handle exceptions 
and load balancing, has to be designed according to the business requirements of the organization.  
 Challenges Faced 
 Owing to business analytics being able to generate quantifiable facts that provide organizations with a 
foundation for informed decision making, it is not too much trouble to gain buy-ins from stakeholders or 
senior management for a business analytics business case. If stakeholders are presented with an analytics 
blueprint that ensures a  return on investment (ROI) that results in a considerable business gain, the 
stakeholders should be willing to invest in the business case. The challenges, however, arise when the actual 
implementation of an analytics strategy takes place without prior clear roadmaps having been defined. 
 Some of the challenges faced in business analytics are as follows:
• 
 Data integration and too many source systems : Deriving conclusions that cross over 
different technological platforms can be challenging. It is advantageous, then, to choose 
source systems that can be easily integrated into each other and the analytics platform.  
• 
 Data quality issues : Owing to different source systems maintaining data in different 
formats, often there are data-quality issues when integrating data from different 
sources. While it is difficult, organizations should strive to have more standardized 
data in source systems. 
• 
 Data storage due to huge amounts of data : With the ever-increasing amount of 
data, storage becomes an issue. With so many data-storage options available 
today—cloud, on-premise, appliances and distributed file systems—organizations 
should choose storage systems taking into account their business requirements and 
how rapidly their data increases. In some industries such as media, in which it is 
important to track every mouse click to analyze the traffic, the amount of data that 
needs to be stored to generate insights is huge. There needs to be a mechanism to 
handle the storage of data—some operational, some real-time. 
• 
 Response time for data querying : Querying data may lead to latency, if the amount of 
data being retrieved is substantial and complex.  
• 
 Long implementation time periods : Business analytics projects may have long 
implementation durations, depending on all the aforementioned factors, thereby 
misleading the stakeholders in their belief that business analytics yields faster 
results. Iterative processes that deliver value in stages is the right approach.  

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCTION TO BUSINESS ANALYTICS
5
• 
 Lack of data governance and metadata management : This is a very common problem 
in organizations, as the business sides are not very aware of technical complications 
that arise due to lack of routines, business definitions, and data-access rights. IT 
departments can implement the business requirements, but the requirements and 
definitions have to be defined by the business. Any organization has a defined set 
of business rules and entities defined by the business, but definitions may vary if 
there are too many departments involved, or if there are many teams spread out 
geographically. It is imperative to define business entities and rules at an enterprise 
 level  and communicate the same to all departments involved. 
• 
 Lack of knowledge and poor communication between business and IT : While IT can 
certainly come up with technical solutions, the business requirements are handled 
by the stakeholders, taking into account organizational needs. But this could result in 
a tug-of-war between IT and business, if the responsibilities are not made clear. It is 
critical that business and IT have a high-level understanding of business alignment 
and the dependency on each other. 
• 
 No clear strategy in place, hence no clarity on KPIs that drive business : If there are no 
clear KPIs defined, it is a hindrance to analytics implementations, as that implies no 
clarity regarding quantifying goals. If it is not clear what needs to be measured, then 
the analytics project goals cannot be defined. 
 While the technical issues can be solved to a large extent as data storage gets cheaper and innovative 
business analytics tools make data integration easier and cut short implementation durations, it is of 
utmost importance that data strategies and KPIs that define business goals be in place before any analytics 
initiative is undertaken. The C-level executives may have in mind a different set of KPIs that drive the overall 
business, while the middle management may be interested in KPIs that give them insights about efficiency of 
certain business operations. It is critical, therefore, that the analytics implementation takes into account the 
expectations of every team that expects a result and that it  delivers   accordingly.  
 Conclusion 
 Business analytics is a multidisciplinary investment, transcending IT and various business departments and 
involving everyone from top management to the  developers   who deliver the solutions, thereby creating an 
atmosphere that encourages knowledge exchange, cooperation, and data-driven processes. This coordination 
is a side effect of analytics initiatives found across organizations. Measuring, optimizing, and analyzing the 
effects is what analytics is all about, but, to generate value, it entails overcoming lots of business as well as 
technical complexities. But when the data chain does deliver great business insights and value, it becomes 
worth the challenge. The advantages of analytics implementations far outweigh the challenges.

 CHAPTER 2  
 SAP Business Analytics Suite 
of Products 
 The last chapter discussed the emerging market for business analytics, with data being used to gain insights 
into every aspect of businesses, and its growing importance in organizations. Businesses that take advantage 
of business analytics capabilities have an edge with regard to business process optimization and revenue 
generation. 
 With the importance of extracting, integrating, storing, and analyzing data for business advancement 
being at an all-time high, owing to every other organization turning to data for actionable insights, there is a 
huge market for analytics products. There are myriad solutions available in the market that suit the different 
needs of gathering, storing, analyzing, and visualizing data. The crux, however, lies in finding the right fit for 
the job. The key features to looking for the right business analytics product for any given  organization   are as 
follows:
• 
 Ease of integration with other sources : Do not forget the legacy systems that have to 
be integrated. The different versions of software updates required, and the need to 
have other software and operating systems updated to be in sync with them, make 
certain products cumbersome. If a product requires frequent updating, it is probably 
unstable, and the maintenance cost may often outweigh the benefit of some flashy 
features that it may possess. 
• 
 Features and functions that suit the requirements of the organization in question : A 
business analytics product could have the best-in-breed features but may lack some 
particular features that the organization in question requires. In that case, it does not 
fulfill the business needs. 
• 
 Is, preferably, full stack : Because an analytics solution requires several layers of 
product stacks, such as databases, ETL, and reporting and dashboarding tools, 
having a full-stack solution would mean having the same software vendor’s products 
for each of the layers. This certainly makes it easier to have different modules of the 
same product suite, as this eases the integrations between different products, making 
licensing easier and probably cheaper. 
• 
 Promotes self-service : Business requirement implementations entail IT support and 
resources for implementation. Empowering business users with self-service products 
increases organizational effectiveness by reducing the time spent going through 
several business processes to implement new requirements. In order to implement 
self-service, the data access and the technicalities involved must be simplified to 
an extent that allows nontechnical business users to work with minimum technical 
dependency.

• 
 Is mobile : With ever-increasing mobile usage, the need of the hour is to have 
business analytics products that are mobile-adapted. To be able to access data 
anywhere, anytime, online or offline, is essential for business users, for effective and 
quick decision making. 
• 
 Takes a shorter time to market : Business requirements change quickly and, therefore, 
require tools and processes that yield results fast. If the implementation time for a 
business analytics tool is too long, the business requirements may become obsolete 
by the time the implementation phase is completed. In a world of highly demanding 
business requirements, a business analytics tool that has a short implementation 
time is key to serving an organization’s analytics needs. 
• 
 Has a reasonable licensing cost : While choosing an analytics product, licensing costs 
are an important factor to consider. Usually, product vendors have different pricing 
models, each having pros and cons. Organizations should weigh these pros and 
cons and decide which licensing model suits their requirements best, based on the 
number of server installations, the number of developer licenses, and the number of 
end-user licenses required. 
• 
 Offers scalability and flexibility : A product that is scalable is one that is able to handle 
huge amounts of data, add more users, migrate existing systems, and has backward 
compatibility. The amount of data that is gathered in today’s businesses is enormous 
and ever-increasing; therefore, the analytics tool chosen should be able to scale the 
high demands of high- performance organizations. 
 That said, SAP Business Analytics has a full suite of products covering every aspect of analytics, 
from data integration to storage, analyzing data in real time, predicting patterns, and visualization. The 
need to store and analyze data arises from the need to make information available at all levels within an 
organization, providing easy access, which is a  unique selling point (USP)   of SAP Business Analytics’ suite 
of products. SAP Business Analytics is meant for enterprise organizations with large-scale information 
distribution. SAP Business Analytics has such data extraction tools as BusinessObjects Data Services and 
storage in  in-memory databases such as HANA, and includes a number of products for  visualization , such as
• 
  SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence  
• 
 SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards 
• 
 SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio 
• 
 SAP BusinessObjects Lumira 
• 
 SAP BusinessObjects Explorer 
• 
 SAP BusinessObjects Crystal Reports 
• 
 SAP BusinessObjects Analysis

  SAP Predictive Analytics  
 Capabilities of SAP Analytics 
 The capabilities of SAP Business Analytics are manifold, but mainly it distributes data within organizations 
at all levels, irrespective of the size of the organization, promoting faster time to market and ease of use. 
SAP Business Analytics shields the business side from behind-the-scene technical complexities involved in 
integrating, storing, and analyzing data, making it easier for a business to focus on effective decision making. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ SAP BUSINESS ANALYTICS SUITE OF PRODUCTS 
9
 Some key capabilities of SAP Business Analytics are
• 
 Improved business user autonomy : Business users are empowered by being able to 
access data with greater ease and by faster, mostly by drag-and-drop, functions. 
• 
 Better data governance abilities : SAP Analytics products have data-level and user-
level access rights management in place to implement robust data governance. 
• 
 Faster time to market : SAP Analytics products are quicker to implement, as SAP 
understands that businesses are very demanding, and if solutions have a very long 
implementation cycle, they become obsolete. 
• 
 Integration with existing IT infrastructure : SAP Analytics has many plug-ins available 
to integrate with both SAP and non-SAP third-party products. The analytics 
visualization is compatible with databases such as Oracle, SQL Server, and Sybase or 
connected to HANA or Hadoop. Organizations that plan to implement SAP Analytics 
do not have to change data storage in order to be SAP Analytics friendly.  
• 
 Multichannel access to data : SAP Analytics Mobile solutions enables business users 
to access data anywhere, anytime, on the go, both online and offline. SAP Analytics 
Dashboards presents powerful visualizations, including charts and graphs for to 
enable dashboard consumers to check trends on desktops as well as mobile devices. 
 SAP Analytics can be deployed in the cloud or on-premises or on a hybrid of both, according to 
the needs of the organization, thus allowing businesses to focus on their core business, instead of IT 
infrastructure. The cloud solutions provided by SAP follow the data security and worldwide compliance 
policies, which, again, offers an advantage to organizations. 
 Choosing the right analytics tool is not only about being able to create reports and dashboards. If the 
implementation and delivery of analytics projects go smoothly, delivering results early on, the relationship 
between business and IT is improved. SAP Analytics provides the kind of agility that business users are 
looking for: to analyze business data in real time, draw conclusions, take action, and check the response to 
changes made. 
 Introduction to SAP Analytics Tools and the Key  Features 
of Each Tool 
 In a world where business requirements are changing rapidly to accommodate growth—competing with 
start-ups with shorter time-to-market, launching new products faster to have the first mover advantage—
analytics has to keep pace to match the speed. Every business process or product life cycle requires a feedback 
loop, to be able to analyze cause and effect and to improve business processes and cost-effectiveness. This 
feedback loop is enabled by business analytics solutions that make valuable information about businesses 
available in the form of reports and dashboards. 
 The success of analytics projects depends on the underlying layer of data called the data warehouse, 
also known as the  OLAP (online analytical processing) layer. The data warehouse is the repository of data 
fetched from source systems such as CRM, ERP, and sales and marketing systems. Data from OLTP (online 
transaction processing) systems is fetched through an extraction, transformation, and load process that 
extracts data from source OLTP systems and cleanses, formats, and saves it in the data warehouse. The data 
in the data warehouse is then presented in a business user-friendly manner in reports and dashboards. 
Data warehouses store both new and historical data for comparison and trend-analysis purposes, while 
transactional databases store only current data. 
 For example: a bank administers millions of transactions every day, with clients withdrawing and saving 
money, buying financial services, transferring funds, etc. These daily transactions are stored in operational 
databases, also known as OLTP. OLTP databases enable quick data retrieval when the data to be retrieved is 
not too huge. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ SAP BUSINESS ANALYTICS SUITE OF PRODUCTS 
10
 However, if a bank wishes to do some trend analysis related to its most profitable customers or to 
determine what kind of customers make the most number of transactions over a period of time, OLTP 
databases are not able to handle such queries, and, therefore, a data warehouse is required. Data warehouses 
are sufficiently robust, with fewer joins between tables, and they store historical data, facilitating answers to 
such queries as those preceding. Data warehouses store not only historical data but also  data that is blended 
from different source systems, both at a very granular level, such as transaction ID, as well as at an aggregated 
level, such as monthly or yearly turnovers. Having data at a very granular as well as at an aggregated level 
makes it possible for business users to drill up and down and slice and dice data at different levels.  
 Having the strong foundation of a data warehouse enables business users to analyze data in depth. 
Building a data warehouse depends on a well-designed, scalable data model. SAP HANA Data Warehousing 
Foundation complements data warehousing capabilities provided by SAP Business Warehouse, SAP HANA 
Agile Data Marts, and other SAP HANA systems. In order to integrate data from different source systems, 
cleanse its format, and load it into the data warehouse, SAP Data  Services is used as an ETL tool. Once the 
data has been loaded into the data warehouse, visualization tools, such as SAP WebIntelligence, SAP Design 
Studio, and SAP Lumira, are used to visualize the data in an interactive manner. 
 The following sections describe some SAP Business Analytics solutions. 
 SAP  BusinessObjects Business Intelligence Platform 
 The BusinessObjects Business Intelligence platform is a flexible platform for sharing information within the 
organization—from CEOs to data scientists to business users. The complexities of the underlying data are 
shielded by a business user-friendly layer that maps the technical data into corporate business terms. This 
layer is known as the semantic layer. The semantic layer provides information in a way that is familiar to 
business users. For example, employee IDs in a database might be saved either as emp_id or empl_id, which 
 Figure 2-1.  OLAP databases are sourced from multiple OLTP databases 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ SAP BUSINESS ANALYTICS SUITE OF PRODUCTS 
11
is not very clear to a nontechnical user. But renaming emp_id Employee ID in a semantic layer provides 
business users the relevant data from a business perspective. 
 Key features of SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence platform are as follows:
• 
 Self-service access to information : BI developers can publish reports into folders 
that are directly accessible by business users. Business users have the possibility of 
creating their own reports, by connecting to the semantic layer, thereby reducing IT 
dependency and increasing the throughput.  
• 
 Data integration from different sources : These can be merged into one holistic view to 
be presented to the end user. Data sources such as ERP and CRM and order-booking 
systems that have completely different data types and formats can be visualized in a 
BI platform as the semantic layer handles the complexities.  
• 
 Publishing and scheduling functionality : These make large-scale distribution 
possible: BI reports can be shared in different formats, such as Excel or PDF, or can 
be scheduled, so that users receive them in their mailboxes, or published on portals, 
for general consumption. 
• 
 Scalability : Several departments and users in one organization can take advantage 
of a single platform, making the SAP BusinessObjects BI platform scalable. When 
the number of users or the number of business areas that require the visualization 
functionalities of the platform increase or the number of user licenses or added data 
sources have to be taken into account, the BI platform remains one. 
 SAP  BusinessObjects Dashboards  
 SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards provides highly interactive and visually rich dashboards. SAP Dashboards 
provide advanced visualization features such as maps to view geographically distributed data. Color palettes 
further enhance the aesthetic sense, as do integration options to embed the dashboards into portals. 
 SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards provides rich visualizations in the form of graphs, bullet charts, pie 
charts, and scorecards, with such additional features as legends and labels on graphs. 
 SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards has a thin processing layer between the data sources and the 
dashboard front end, making data refresh very quick. This is one of the major requirements of businesses: 
to be able to see business data in real time, in charts and graphs. Easy  integration   with different data sources 
and semantic layers highlight the ease that SAP Dashboards provides.  
 SAP  BusinessObjects Design Studio 
 SAP Business Objects Design Studio enables BI developers to create analysis applications and dashboards 
based on SAP BW, SAP HANA, and semantic data sources, both for desktop and mobile devices. 
 End users can create analysis applications using SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio, eliminating the 
need for BI developers for every new implementation requirement. Design Studio provides drag-and-drop 
features for easy navigation. With a real-time package available, Design Studio makes it possible to pull real-
time data from SAP BW and SAP HANA, to create visualizations in real time. 
 SAP  BusinessObjects Lumira 
 SAP BusinessObjects Lumira enables users to access, transform, and visualize data in a self-service manner 
for ad hoc reporting. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ SAP BUSINESS ANALYTICS SUITE OF PRODUCTS 
12
 The easy interface with drag-and-drop features makes Lumira very user-friendly, even for the least 
technical business user, eliminating the need for extensive training. 
 It is truly a low-cost, end user–friendly tool, with easy sharing options, such as publishing Lumira data 
sets and documents to Lumira cloud, Lumira server, or the SAP BI server. SAP Lumira is mobile-compatible, 
enabling business users to access data in real time. 
 SAP  Crystal Reports 
 SAP Crystal Reports provides businesses with pixel-perfect reports for external consumer needs, such as 
invoices, bank statements, or portfolio letters. 
 SAP Crystal Reports provides smart default formatting options. It also provides multi-source support 
and can combine data from disparate sources and present it as one holistic data set.  
 SAP  BusinessObjects Analysis 
 SAP BusinessObjects Analysis comes in two versions: an edition that integrates Word and Excel for Microsoft 
Office, and one that is accessed from the BusinessObjects Enterprise BI launchpad in a web browser, which 
enables users to access data easily, using workbooks. 
 SAP  Predictive Analytics 
 SAP Predictive Analytics is a statistical analysis and data-mining solution that takes advantage of predictive 
models to discover hidden insights and trends in data, in order to make certain predictions. 
 SAP Predictive Analytics combines SAP InfiniteInsight (as Automated Analytics) and SAP Predictive 
Analysis (as Expert Analytics) to do time series forecasting, outlier detection, trend analysis, classification 
analysis, segmentation analysis, and affinity analysis. 
 SAP Predictive Analytics can handle large volumes of data and perform data analysis by using the R 
statistical analysis language and in-memory data-mining capabilities.   
 Conclusion 
 Every business has unique requirements, which keep changing with time and growth. To support business 
needs, business analytics implementations must always keep abreast of such changes. Therefore, it is 
important to create a scalable data warehouse, with an  ETL design that can easily integrate newer source 
systems and handle loading of additional amounts of data. The visualization tools chosen should be unique 
to each business requirement. Some business processes require that analysts analyze the data themselves. In 
such cases, SAP Business Analysis represents a suitable choice. In other cases, for example, top management 
may have to check weekly market trends without delving into detail, and that need can be addressed by 
using SAP Dashboard. Each business must carefully consider its specific requirements before selecting a 
business analytics tool that fits the bill.

 CHAPTER 3  
 Consolidating Data from Disparate 
Systems for an Analytics Project 
 Analytics discovers patterns in data, by turning raw data into meaningful information. Analytics implies 
being able to generate insights by analyzing data generated by business systems. Because every business has 
several systems that support each business process, it is important that data from these different systems is 
merged before data analysis begins. This is critical to attaining a holistic view of business processes and the 
data generated by them. This chapter explains the importance of merging data and its attendant challenges 
and solutions. 
 Importance of Merging Data from Different IT Systems 
 Every organization, irrespective of industry, has several business processes, each supported by several 
IT products and processes. Each of these IT processes and products yields an insurmountable amount of 
information, as well as insights, which are of paramount importance for any organization. Businesses have 
to rely on data to take decisions regarding investments, improving  customer   relationships, streamlining 
IT processes, optimizing human resources, etc. Before the invention of computers and state-of-the-art 
IT processes and products, organizations relied on paper records in order to improve planning. Because 
data is so important to organizations, a great deal of time and effort is invested in maintaining the quality, 
relevance, and availability of data. 
 Organizations typically have transaction processing systems, CRM systems, billing systems, IT 
networking systems, human resources supporting systems, inventory management systems, and other IT 
systems that are industry-specific. For example, the  health care industry uses systems that monitor heart or 
pulse rates, and that data is invaluable for research purposes. With the growing needs of an organization, 
the number of IT systems supporting business processes also increase, each system providing support for 
specialized business needs. Ever since the Internet came into being, the amount of data has been on the rise, 
and now, with smart phones and digitalization on the rise, businesses are inundated with data. Often, the 
data residing in one IT system is different from the other, making integration between systems an uphill task. 
 A few IT solutions that can be mapped to business processes in any organization, and the integrations 
required for these solutions to be able to function, are discussed in the following sections of this chapter. 
 Order Booking Systems 
 Booking systems are used for creating, managing, and processing orders of any kind, be they related to 
retail, health care, manufacturing, or telecom. Order booking systems serve as the initial interface between 
a business and a customer. There are different ways to track business leads and potential markets by using 
web analytics, but order booking is seen as a confirmation that a lead has been resulted in a customer. Order 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CONSOLIDATING DATA FROM DISPARATE SYSTEMS FOR AN ANALYTICS PROJECT

booking systems have provisions to integrate with other systems, such as ERP, inventory control, billing, 
invoicing, and CRM. It is crucial for business to know the reason behind the conversion of a lead into a 
customer. It could be that certain marketing campaigns lead a potential customer to book an order, such as 
recommending different products on a web site that have caught a customer’s eye. While booking an order, 
front-office representatives are required to check that the product pertaining to the order is available in 
the inventory, requiring integration with the inventory management system. Once the order is booked, the 
product has to be shipped, which, again, requires integration with the logistic software solutions. The order 
booked for a product has to be charged; hence, integration with an invoicing system is crucial.  
 CRM Systems 
 These are responsible for an organization’s engagement with existing and potential customers, for sales, 
marketing, and customer service. One of the main success factors that leverages a high ROI on CRM initiatives 
is to have robust customer master data. CRM relies heavily on customer master data to mail, message, or send 
out notifications about campaigns. It is thus vital not only to have the demographics of customers updated but 
also their preferences and interests. Sending out campaigns to customers who are not interested in certain 
products, or sending out multiple notifications to the wrong customers, can backfire. In order to distribute 
relevant marketing campaigns for lead generation, the CRM systems not only require integration with the 
master data but also integration with ERP, to be aware of the product that the customer owns at present, with 
billing systems to check the customer’s invoicing history. It could be a simple business requirement to remind 
customers about a credit card expiry date. But such a simple requirement gives rise to extracting data from 
multiple systems, including customer master data, billing, invoicing, and e-mail software systems.  
 Billing Systems  
 Billing systems are responsible for collecting consumption data, taking pricing into account, and calculating 
charges for customers. They are also responsible for processing payments and managing debt collection. 
In order to calculate an invoice for a customer, a billing system has to check the product or package that the 
consumer owns currently, the means by which is usually an ERP system or an order booking system. Every 
organization has a pricing strategy, which could very well be embedded into the billing system or stored in 
some other software solution. Billing solutions have to delve into the ERP, and the pricing solutions must 
be able to calculate and invoice the customer. Billing systems are not only used for invoicing but also as a 
resource for accounting systems involving bookkeeping, budgeting, and forecasting. Several organizations 
are required to run a credit history check or establish a credit ranking before granting a customer access to 
their products. This, of course, requires additional integration with external sources for credit evaluation of 
individuals or  businesses that have expressed an interest in becoming potential customers.  
 Campaign Management Systems 
 As software solutions to manage marketing campaigns, campaign management systems usually read 
data from CRM systems, to distribute marketing content to targeted customers. Campaign management 
software solutions also provide reporting or dashboarding functionalities to measure marketing campaign 
effectiveness. A campaign management process involves planning, designing, testing, implementing, 
and execution and analysis of results, which are then useful for optimizing future campaigns. But in order 
to target the right customers with the right campaigns, integration between customer master data, CRM 
systems, invoicing systems, and web analytics is almost unavoidable. The most effective campaigns are those 
that seem tailored to the customer. In order to send out personalized campaigns, businesses are required to 
do deep-dive into customer information from various systems, to gather as much data about the customer 
as possible. E-mail software solutions that send out newsletters and other campaigns to customers could 
 backfire  and result in customers de-registering from the offered services, if not correctly configured with 
inputs from IT solutions that support customer life cycle. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CONSOLIDATING DATA FROM DISPARATE SYSTEMS FOR AN ANALYTICS PROJECT
15
 Web Analytics 
 Web analytics encompasses all tools and software solutions used to measure web traffic and online customer 
behavior, to optimize web usage. Web analytics is used for measuring marketing, sales, UX (user experience), 
landing page, bounce rates, and market research. It is also used to measure the amount of traffic that 
originates from social media sites. Again, web analytics products have to be integrated with solutions such 
as master data or data security solutions to understand the customers that log on to web pages—their usage 
patterns, fraud detection, and access rights. Web analytics is also used to measure lead generation, and the 
data resulting from such measurements is forwarded to CRM and campaign management systems, in order 
to target them better, thus increasing conversion rates for businesses. Capturing clickstream data is a huge 
challenge for businesses, as a web page could potentially generate millions of clicks in minutes, depending 
on the content of the page. Furthermore, if there is a business requirement to combine clickstream data with 
other business data, to generate insights, the solution could encompass several IT systems, making it too 
complex. But, nevertheless, if it is a must for revenue-generation, data integration between systems has to be 
achieved in the most optimal way. 
 Inventory Management 
 Inventory management systems are one of the most important business systems, because they reflect 
business investment and the costs incurred before a product is sold. Front-office representatives or 
salespeople in retail outlets have to rely on the stock available to be able to serve customers better and 
before making commitments with regard to the availability of any product. Inventory management systems, 
in turn, have to be integrated with bookkeeping systems, logistics, ERP, and billing. A mismanaged inventory 
management system can be hazardous to any business; thus, it requires the utmost care and surveillance. 
 Human Resource Management 
 Human resource management (HRM) systems administer attendance, payroll, performance appraisals, 
benefits administration, recruiting, and learning and absence management, to name only a few functions 
related to personnel. HRM systems are a way to keep track of optimal resource utilization in any 
organization. Payroll, absence, and attendance are interdependent, and it eases problems if these modules 
have tight software integration. Payroll and attendance are also used for budgeting and forecasting, requiring 
an additional integration with those systems. Many organizations not only have built payroll, attendance, 
absence, performance appraisals, etc., into their HRMs but also recruitment, hiring, employee self-service, 
and learning management, thus making them quite robust. 
 Master Data Management 
 Master data management, as the name suggests, is the administration of the principal source of the most 
accurate data regarding an enterprise. With innumerable IT systems and tools, data governance is of utmost 
importance to maintain correct information. In fact, master data management should be considered 
paramount in any business. Master data management is used to remove duplicates, redundancies, and errors 
in data. Customer information entered in different systems could have different names or addresses, making 
it difficult to combine the data from multiple sources. Master data is maintained for products, product codes 
and hierarchies, partners, suppliers, locations, customer details, transactions, organization hierarchies, etc. 
Every system, such as billing, ERP, or CRM, should extract the information regarding the preceding from the 
master data, to retrieve correct and up-to-date information. Not only is the data correct and up-to-date, but if 
all systems use the master data as a single source of information, then it makes data integration much easier, 
while reducing redundancy. However, maintaining master data management systems involves a great deal of 
effort to cleanse, govern, and  manage the quality and life cycle of master data.  

CHAPTER 3 ■ CONSOLIDATING DATA FROM DISPARATE SYSTEMS FOR AN ANALYTICS PROJECT
16
 Mobile Apps 
 With the rise in the use of smartphones, most companies have invested in building mobile apps that serve 
customers better while on the go, be they retail companies that send promotional codes and the latest news 
about their products, banks that allow transactions on mobile apps, travel companies that store all of their 
customers’ travel-related documents in one app for easy accessibility, or media outlets that disseminate 
the latest news via mobile apps. The app has to retrieve, from transactional systems, data about customer 
purchase history or customer preferences. The information on the apps about customer interaction is again 
fed back to response systems, to improve the app features, to come up with better pricing strategies, and 
to improve and streamline business processes. Moreover, real-time data becomes important for mobile 
solutions, as customers demand, for example, only the latest news or the latest status related to delivery 
of their package. This real-time demand for information requires analyzing huge amounts of data that is 
retrieved from business systems at the same time as analysis is being undertaken. Real-time analysis of data 
demands that IT systems support data blending in real time, with very little latency. Systems have to handle 
a variety of data, its volume, and the velocity with which it is delivered.  
 Business Analytics 
 Last but not least are business analytics solutions. These incorporate all of the systems and solutions 
previously discussed and must be able to measure and optimize revenue generation, customer acquisition, 
and business gain from a holistic point of view. Business analytics can be used as the foundation for 
decision making, either by humans (e.g., corporate management) or by automated systems (e.g., campaign 
management systems) that distribute campaign content via e-mail to customers, based on their interests, 
the data for which having been fed into business analytics from web analytics or CRM. Business analytics is 
a fact-based science, driving business decisions by gathering, cleansing, and analyzing data from multiple 
source systems, such as those mentioned previously. It is business analytics systems that gather and 
store historic data from each of these business support systems, turning raw business data into valuable 
information that helps businesses support decision making. 
 For example, in order to examine a customer life cycle, increase customer satisfaction, and win 
customer loyalty, organizations have to check related data, from the time the customer bought a product 
or service, his or her invoicing history, past purchase history, membership points, etc. This data resides in 
multiple IT solutions. Adding to the list of traditional IT systems, there are now also mobile apps and web 
analytics data that reveals information about customer online behavior, how they browse products on web 
sites and on mobile apps, what leads to a purchase, and what makes customers abandon shopping carts. So, 
the variety of data that has to be stored and analyzed is increasing, and so is the amount of both structured 
data from traditional IT systems and unstructured data from social media platforms. 
 If data from these multiple systems is not integrated, the business value it generates is minimal. Data 
in silos, such as illustrated in Figure  3-1 , generates very narrow visions of the business. Data duplication, 
redundancy, and mismatch are some of the results of data residing in silos—a complete nightmare for 
enterprise organizations. 
 Figure 3-1.  Data Silos (Source:   https://tobeggardescription.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/silos.png  )       
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CONSOLIDATING DATA FROM DISPARATE SYSTEMS FOR AN ANALYTICS PROJECT
17
 The data in each of these systems contains in-depth information pertaining to the system in question. A 
billing system can also act as a reporting system to provide information about important billing KPIs, such as 
the total number of invoices sent, the total number of payments received on time or delayed. Similarly, an ERP 
system can also provide some basic reporting capabilities, such as the products owned by a certain customer, 
or which are the most popular products bought by customers. These isolated pockets of information do not 
offer sufficient insight into the business as a whole. The data residing in each of these silos is invaluable, no 
doubt, but it does not provide a 360-degree view of a customer or the entire  customer   life cycle. 
 Integrating disparate IT systems to gain business insight is, therefore, imperative. It is not an option but 
a must. A simple query raised by the business, such as finding the product owned and the amount charged 
to the customer, requires the amalgamation of more than two IT solutions, making it cumbersome, if they 
are not already integrated. 
 To be able to function optimally, every IT solution requires integration with several other IT solutions. 
Following is an example of the integration required by an ERP system, in order to obtain the most from all of 
its modules for asset management. ERP requires integration with resourcing, to check the inventory for the 
availability of a product, integration with logistics, for shipping a product, integration with CRM, to ensure 
delivery and track the customer engagement with a product, and integration with financial management, to 
track the invoicing of a product to the customer (see Figure  3-2 ).

 Challenges Faced During Data Integration 
 A typical data integration scenario, such as that illustrated in Figure  3-3 , is a convergence of multiple 
sources, including CRM, billing,  campaign management, social media, and inventory management, into one 
single source for analytics. It may appear simple on the surface, but it is quite daunting to integrate different 
sources of data with different data structures and business rules governing each solution. However, data 
integration leads to insights for increasing cross-selling and up-selling, by blending data at various levels and 
from different divisions of a company. 
 Some of the main challenges posed by data integration across IT systems and solutions and across data 
silos follow. 
 Understanding  Business Needs 
 Taking into account business needs that are the basis for data integration is key. Any organization that 
focused on a data-integration roadmap must map the business requirements to the business processes and 
integrate the tools and solutions that support the same. Data integration is a technical challenge, involving 
time and resources. It is necessary, therefore, to understand the business gain that can be achieved by 
integrating data from disparate systems, efficiently utilizing time and resources. 
 Figure 3-3.  Data integration in an  ETL  process, in  SAP BusinessObjects Data Services 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CONSOLIDATING DATA FROM DISPARATE SYSTEMS FOR AN ANALYTICS PROJECT
19
 Some data integration projects launch even before a business gain has been clearly identified. This 
leads to the project going haywire and to time and resources not being utilized efficiently. Once business 
goals are defined, the processes and data required to ensure them are not very tricky to put in place. 
 The foundation for data integration should be nothing other than a business gain. If the organization 
is clear about the goals that it intends to achieve by data integration, the process of integrating two or more 
systems to acquire the added advantage of data blending  becomes technically do-able. 
 Understanding Data- Quality Issues 
 In a data-integration project, because the sources of data are different and come from different IT solutions, 
the format and structure of data is not the same. Differing data types, formats, and structures present a big 
challenge when integrating data from disparate sources. Moreover, some organizations have operations 
spread out across the globe, introducing the challenge of multilingual text characters. Some software 
solutions do not support certain languages. 
 If we consider the example of integrating customer data from a CRM system and a billing system, it is 
very much possible that some of the data resides in both the systems, giving rise to data duplication. It is 
then of utmost importance to find out which of the data sets is the correct one and refer it to the master data 
and map the differing data records into the same. 
 By focusing on one entity, such as the customer number or the product code, the attributes that lend 
completeness to the entity in question get easier to understand and easier to map from different systems. 
For example, customer ID is present in most IT solutions that save customer information as the single 
unique identity. A customer could have product IDs in ERP systems that point to the products owned by 
the customer; the customer ID in billing could point to the invoicing address credit card number, and 
the method of payment that the customer has chosen; and the customer ID in web analytics points to the 
online preferences and interests the customer has. When gathering data regarding the customer from ERP, 
billing, and web analytics, there should be one data record that displays the customer’s customer ID, billing 
ID, asset ID, and all the attributes associated with the same—billing address, online preferences, products 
owned, invoicing method, etc. 
 If there are cases in which the data contains null values or wrong data, the business has to take 
ownership of the data that flows into business analytics. Business analytics solutions do not create new data; 
they cleanse, transform, and modify data to be presented in a way that makes it easy to draw conclusions 
about customer behavior, product popularity, sales, and marketing.  
 Data  Governance Issues 
 Data governance is the practice of acquiring, cleansing, and distributing data, accessing rights management, 
and maintaining security of data. A typical enterprise organization houses numerous departments, each 
department in turn being run by several software solutions to support business processes (see Figure  3-4 ). 
In order to avoid data duplication and redundancy while also maintaining data security, data governance 
comes into the picture. It is very important to have a master data management system in place that defines 
the key attributes of the core business. 
 For example, if an insurance company has 200 products with 50 subproducts under each one of them, 
this should be clearly defined in a master data store. Every time that a product or a subproduct is referred 
to or has to be validated, it is this master data source that must be used as the single source for validation or 
data reconciliation. If this practice is maintained enterprise-wise, not only does it reduce the overhead of 
maintaining several redundant data stores, but it also eases the distribution and security issues of data. 
 Data governance also handles access rights to the data. Sales and marketing data, even within the same 
organization, can be sensitive information, and not everyone should have access to it. Data governance 
rules clearly define the access levels and rights that different groups or individuals are assigned within an 
organization.

 Maintaining  Historical Records 
 Transaction-based systems usually store snapshots of data, lacking historical records. In business analytics, 
historical data is of utmost importance to check past trends, compare them with prevailing trends, or predict 
future trends. Transaction processing systems such as order booking have to process huge amounts of 
data on the fly, the emphasis being on very fast query processing and maintaining data integrity. But if the 
business requirements are to be able to analyze historical data alongwith fresh real-time data, both have to 
be integrated, blended, and stored in data warehouses. To save data from multiple sources and spanning 
different time periods is challenging and requires maintaining data with business rules that were applicable 
in the past along with data maintained according to updated business rules and, moreover, with differences 
in structure and format. 
 For example, combining historical data from a billing system with tariff plans and pricing strategies 
that were applicable in the past with data from an ERP system with an updated product structure is not 
only complicated to integrate but will also require a lot of data cleansing and processing, in order for useful 
insights to be generated. 
 Storing historical records implies great amounts of data, and that can pose a problem. It becomes 
necessary, then, to choose the kind of scalable hardware that is able to support growing amounts of data. 
     Different Data Formats in  Different   Systems 
 As discussed, data from different sources generates data in different formats, structures, and size. A customer 
ID in a billing system could be a character field with a length 100, while the same customer ID could be a 
numerical field in CRM, thus making integration between the two systems problematic. 
 An integral component of data integration in business analytics is ETL part (extraction, transformation, 
and loading). This is the practice of extracting data from source systems, cleaning and processing it in a way 
that makes it possible to combine data from single or multiple, identical or disparate systems (see Figure  3-5 ). 
 Figure 3-4.  Master data management 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CONSOLIDATING DATA FROM DISPARATE SYSTEMS FOR AN ANALYTICS PROJECT
21
In the preceding example of customer ID from two different systems that have different data structures, it is in 
the ETL process that one of the data types is converted to match the other, to maintain conformity and make 
data integration possible.  
 Data  Integration Techniques 
 To extract data from multiple systems, a data-integration mechanism, such as plug-ins, adapters, and APIs, has 
to be available. Today, most software solutions are equipped with some form of data connector to integrate 
with myriad data sources. Data sources being spread over organizations can be on-premise, cloud-based, or 
remotely situated and have completely different interfaces with which to integrate with multiple systems. 
 The problem arises with the increasing complexity to connect to each of these connectors. A web 
service may very well have APIs available but require much tweaking and coding to be able to integrate with 
another source, demanding additional time and resources. Every day, more and more software solutions are 
offering ingenious ways of offering multisource connectivity.   
 Solutions to Combine Different Data Sources 
 Combining data from multiple heterogeneous systems is an old practice. Comparing Excel sheets stating 
the cost of marketing campaigns against actual sales has been a longtime standard practice. But with new 
age digitalization taking the world by storm, and all business systems being supported by software solutions, 
combining the data from each of the sources is a critical need of contemporary businesses. Combining data 
from multiple business processes yields an enterprise-wide view of data. Integrating financial data from sales, 
marketing, supply chains, and human resources empowers many departments in an organization to plan, 
implement, invest, and optimize their operations much more efficiently, with fact-based figures (see Figure  3-6 ).  
 Figure 3-5.  ETL—extraction, transformation, and  loading of data 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CONSOLIDATING DATA FROM DISPARATE SYSTEMS FOR AN ANALYTICS PROJECT
22
 However, integrating multisource heterogeneous data entails a systematic chain of processes to refine 
data to an extent that it generates information that can be rendered useful by organizations. The following 
sections elaborate the steps used to process data during a data integration process. 
 Data  Cleansing 
 Raw data from source systems is as per the standards and rules applicable in the source system, which may 
not necessarily be the same across all the other systems that have to be integrated. Common fields that have 
to be handled during this stage are date fields. Dates could be defined in different formats, depending on the 
source system. Some enterprise organizations have businesses spread across the globe, each country having 
specific time zones and date formats. Standard business rules that are relevant to all the systems involved 
must be defined before applying cleaning mechanisms. 
 For example, an organization may choose to concatenate first names and last names of customers 
residing in any source system, while combining the sources or adding the country code to all phone numbers. 
 Figure 3-6.  Gathering data from  different source systems in a data warehouse that caters to business analytics 
systems—dashboards, reports, and analytical cubes 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CONSOLIDATING DATA FROM DISPARATE SYSTEMS FOR AN ANALYTICS PROJECT
23
 Removing  Duplicates 
 It is evident that while trying to combine data from multiple sources there is bound to be duplication. Again, 
predefined business rules determine the method used to eliminate duplicate data records. 
 Let’s consider a customer in a CRM system who has purchased multiple products at different time 
periods. If the business requirement is to store every record in order to analyze all the products that a 
customer has purchased during a certain period of time, the multiple records can be considered relevant. 
However, if the business requirement is to save the record pointing to the latest product acquired by the 
customer, then all other multiple records are considered as duplicate and must be eliminated. Similarly, if 
a customer has changed address several times, is it relevant for the business to store all of the customer’s 
previous or only the latest? There could also be scenarios under which the records are identical, such as a 
data record pertaining to customer details that may have the same information as a data record from web 
analytics. In such a case, the business would have to determine which record to discard. 
 Applying Integrated  Business Rules 
 Consider a logistics company that calculates the estimated time of delivery of packages and compares that 
to the actual time in which packages are delivered. It is the business side that determines how the estimated 
and actual time required for delivery of packages is derived, which touch points are to be taken into account, 
and which processes and rules define a delay, etc. 
 If the business requirement is to integrate all the source systems that contain information regarding 
geographic locations that the company delivers to, postal tracking systems, scanned data from handheld 
devices, data quality issues arise, owing to data-redundancy and data-structure differences. Business rules 
are, therefore, critical to maintaining quality and relevance of data. 
 Clearly defined business rules, when mapped to software solutions and systems, are easy to maintain 
and have faster implementation cycles. 
 Maintaining Master Data  Management Systems 
 The importance of master data management systems cannot be overemphasized. With businesses becoming 
increasingly diversified, offering innumerable services at the same time and targeting customers of various 
segments, the increases in complexity become manifold. 
 To mitigate this growing complexity, it is paramount to maintain master data records of all products 
on offer and all geographic locations in which customers can avail themselves of those products. In other 
words, maintaining a single hub, with updated and relevant versions of the key attributes of the business, 
simplifies business execution and presents a single unified view of enterprise information. Maintaining 
master data management aids in synchronizing financial and operational strategy and eases distribution 
of information to a wider audience while reducing costs, by eliminating the overhead associated with 
maintaining several data silos. 
 Avoiding  Data Silos 
 Every company is organized in divisions, departments, or groups, such as sales, technology, and finance, 
that specialize in certain areas. This, of course, results in implementing software solutions that aid the 
specialized processes required by each distinct division or department. These isolated areas of information 
are called silos. 
 Problems arise when the data silos have to be integrated, in order to deliver, across divisions and 
departments, business insights to facilitate up-selling or cross-selling. Each silo has its own set of business 
rules, making data integration with other systems problematic. It is, thus, best to avoid data silos in the first 
place. It helps to take enterprise-wide steps to avoid generating data silos, by having in place an enterprise 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CONSOLIDATING DATA FROM DISPARATE SYSTEMS FOR AN ANALYTICS PROJECT
24
architecture team that examines new IT investments and integration architecture. Businesses often acquire 
new tools to solve short-term business goals that otherwise have a long implementation cycle. These 
short-term solutions gradually turn into permanent data silos. Having an enterprise architecture team that 
centralizes the IT investment roadmap and software solutions reduces clusters of data silos.   
 SAP Business Analytics Tool to Combine the Different Data 
Sources 
 As a leading business analytics product vendor,  SAP has a whole suite of analytics products geared 
specifically either to large and medium-sized organizations. As discussed, to be able to utilize analytics to 
the fullest, organizations must integrate data from disparate systems. Raw data from multiple systems makes 
much more sense when combined to leverage insights. SAP offers SAP BusinessObjects Data Services as a 
tool for data integration, data quality, and data profiling. 
 SAP BusinessObjects Data Services (BODS) facilitates extraction, integration, and transformation of raw 
data from multiple business sources to deliver powerful insights for business gain. 
 Data and systems management tools that IT departments can use to administer BODS include
• 
 BI platform Central Management Console (CMC) 
• 
 Data Services Management Console 
• 
 Data Services Server Manager 
• 
 Data Services Repository Manager 
• 
 License Manager 
 The preceding list of products will be discussed in detail in Chapter   4 . 
 BODS provides integration  support for a number of tools, platforms, and databases, including DB2, 
MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and Teradata; a Universe connection using JDBC or ODBC; and Salesforce 
integration via Salesforce adapter. BODS also provides integration with big data platforms such as Hadoop. 
 In order to utilize the data integration and its quality and profiling abilities, to maintain an optimum 
base for business analytics, clear rules have to be defined with regard to architecture, business rules, 
cleansing, and transforming, as well as version control of code. Some organizations choose to have most of 
the data transformation logic in the ETL tools, making it easy to change or upgrade databases without much 
dependency. But some organizations choose to push querying and data processing to the database level and 
use ETL as a means of data transfer. 
 Irrespective of the approach chosen, clear guidelines have to be defined beforehand for
• 
 Data cleansing and transformation 
• 
 Understanding data dependencies 
• 
 Error handling 
• 
 Applicable business rules 
• 
 Version control between development, test, and production environments 
• 
 Documentation 
 BODS offers a palette of different transformations that can be used while integrating and transforming 
data from multiple sources. The following image (Figure  3-7 ) gives an overview of the functions available for 
data transformation in BODS, including data transfer, date, hierarchy flattening, etc. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CONSOLIDATING DATA FROM DISPARATE SYSTEMS FOR AN ANALYTICS PROJECT
25
 There are also a number of data-quality functions available, such as  Data_Cleanse ,  USA_Regulatory_
Address_Cleanse ,  Match , etc. (See Figure  3-8 .) 
 The BODS architecture,  data connectors, and functions are explained in detail in Chapter   4 . 
 Conclusion 
 You have seen the importance of data integration in business analytics to provide a 360-degree view of 
business data. Business analytics almost always entails integrating several business systems, to turn data into 
insightful information that businesses can act upon. However, easy as it may sound, data blending is far from 
simple. Blending data from different business processes  requires cross-platform data retrieval and storage in 
an enterprise data warehouse that serves as a central repository for all the business analytics requirements 
of an enterprise.

 CHAPTER 4  
 SAP BusinessObjects Data 
Services 
 In this chapter, you will discover the advantages of data integration and the challenges faced in integrating 
data from different systems and in different formats, and some of the proven solutions. The chapter also 
mentions some common data warehousing practices and technical implementations of  ETL   (extraction, 
transformation, and loading). 
 Introduction to SAP BusinessObjects Data Services 
 Data from  structured sources such as ERP, CRM, and order management systems, when combined with 
unstructured data from social media and web logs, generates invaluable insights about any business in 
question. Simple as it may seem, the technical implementation of the same is extremely complex. The 
technical complexities are not just confined to fetching and blending data from different sources, but they 
also involve the way data is stored and data-quality issues. 
 It is a technical challenge to combine different data sources from different technical platforms, because 
data from different sources have different formats. Data quality also becomes an issue when integrating 
different data sources. Most of the time in IT departments is spent in trying to integrate multiple data 
sources rather than in gaining insights by blending data. To manage costs and yet deliver value by tackling 
complexities is key. 
 SAP BusinessObjects Data Services addresses the aforementioned  challenges   of combining data from 
different business sources while maintaining the quality to deliver information. SAP Data Services fetches 
data from different business systems and stores it in a data warehouse that is then used to create reports 
and dashboards to visualize data, thus helping business users with decision making. Different departments 
in organizations often create data silos that are difficult to integrate with other business data. Apart from 
complexities that arise owing to data silos, there are complexities such as data duplication, quality issues, 
and inconsistencies, apart from data types being different.  Data Services helps uncover data-quality issues 
early in the process, by detecting business rule violations in the data flows. Data Services is a single enterprise 
solution that can be implemented for data integration, data profiling, quality checks, and text processing, 
facilitating combining data from multiple disparate sources. SAP Data Services eases the process of accessing 
data from a variety of sources, cleansing and standardizing data in a format that is easily understandable 
by business users. SAP Data Services provides functionality to analyze lineage to determine data sources of 
documents and reports. It also  provides the functionality to conduct an impact analysis for changes in source 
or to allow data stores and version-control capabilities to have control over each object over time. 
 SAP Data Services provides several connectors to access data from various sources through APIs, 
adapters, and connectors. SAP Data Services can access business data from source systems such as ERP 
and CRM, and SAP BW or Salesforce, in the form of files using data connectors or adapters to connect to the

28
source systems. SAP Data Services captures data from SAP Netweaver and  ABAP. Data Services versions 4.2   
onward make it possible to access data from MongoDB and HIVE through adapters and push the data into 
target data stores. 
 A Data Services implementation can adapt to an already existing stack of  technical tools   via web 
services or APIs. Developers and end users can access, create, edit, and combine data from multiple sources 
with Data Services projects, using tools such as:
• 
 Designer 
• 
 Management Console 
• 
 Administrator 
• 
 Impact and Lineage Analysis 
• 
 Operational Dashboard, displaying the status of scheduled  ETL   jobs  
• 
 Auto Documentation 
• 
 Data Validation 
• 
 Data Quality Reports 
 As seen in Figure  4-1 , the  start page of SAP Data Services displays all the options available in the Data 
Services Designer. The start page provides a single platform on which to check the repositories, the release 
notes, SAP community network links, tutorials, etc. 
 To manage the data governance for the SAP Data Services set of tools, IT departments can use such 
integrated tools as the  Central Management Console (CMC) , Data Services Management Console, Server 
Manager, and Repository Manager. 
 Figure 4-1.  The options  provided in the SAP Data Services Designer from the start page

 The CMC (Figure  4-2 ) is used for
• 
 Repository configuration 
• 
 User administration 
• 
 User group administration 
• 
 Application rights 
 Management Console 
 Data Services’ Management Console can be used to schedule, monitor, and execute batch jobs. Other 
functions that can be performed using the Management Console are
• 
 User administration 
• 
 Configuring and managing adapters, such as Salesforce adapters 
• 
 Configuring, starting, and stopping real-time services 
• 
 Configuring Job Server and repository usage    
 In Figure  4-3 , the Data Services Management Console start page displays the options available in the 
SAP Data Services Management Console.

 Server Manager 
 Server managers are used to create, edit, or delete job servers and access servers after installation on both 
Windows and Unix systems. Job servers can be used to manage multiple jobs on several machines to a single 
repository for load balancing and vice versa. Job servers provide the functionality to start and stop Data 
Services services. 
 The Repository Manager, shown in Figure  4-4 , facilitates creation, updating, and version control of local 
and central repositories. 
 Figure 4-3.  The Data  Services Management Console 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS DATA SERVICES
31
 SAP Data Services is accessed and managed through interfaces such as Designer, Repositories, and  Job 
Server. Following is an introduction to each of the interfaces available. 
 SAP  Data Services Designer 
 Designer is a development tool with a graphical user interface. It provides projects, data mappings, 
transformations, and source and target configuration options. 
 In Designer, source data stores such as ERP, CRM, or flat flies from FTP servers, Excel sheets, or 
database connections such as Microsoft SQL server, Oracle, HIVE, or Mongo DB can be specified with 
requisite connection information. The data from these source systems can then be accessed, modified, or 
have business rules applied via Data Services transformations, and validated. Each instance of Designer can 
be used to connect to the local and the central repositories and also to different environments such as test, 
development, or production. 
 Figure 4-4.  Repository Manager in the SAP Data Services Management Console 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS DATA SERVICES
32
 Repository 
 The SAP Data Services repository is the metadata for the source and target data store. Each repository is 
registered in the CMC and is associated with one or more job servers, which run the jobs created. There are 
two types of repositories:
 
 1. 
 Local repository . A local repository is used by an  ETL developer to store 
definitions of objects such as projects, jobs, work flows, and data flows, 
developed locally and accessible only to the developer.  
 
 2. 
 Central r epository . The central repository (see Figure  4-5 ) is a shared object 
library allowing developers to check objects in and out of their local repositories. 
The central repository allows multiple developers to store master copies of 
projects as the single version of truth. Upon development completion, data flows 
and projects are checked into the central repository, to be able to be shared with 
a team of  ETL developers. Figure  4-5 shows how to access the central repositories 
from within the SAP Data Services Designer. 
 An SAP Data Services instance can have multiple repositories, such as one for a test and one for a 
 production  environment. A single SAP Data Services instance can connect to either. Figure  4-6 shows how 
to activate one of the repositories. When a developer develops an  ETL   job in the test environment and, after 
having tested it, has to promote it to the production environment, the job can be added by a right-click to the 
production repository, by switching to the right repository. 
 Figure 4-5.  Central repositories from within SAP Data Services Designer 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS DATA SERVICES
33
 Job Server 
 The SAP Data Services Job Server is responsible for performing extractions from multiple sources and 
complex data transformations, loading and integrating numerous systems such as  ERP   and CRM data, for 
example. While running a Data Services job, the job server retrieves the job from its repository and starts 
an engine to process the job. Jobs can either be run locally and in real time in the local repository or run as 
a batch job, configured in the Management Console. Load balancing can be handled by creating job server 
groups, which distribute the system load optimally. 
 SAP  Data Services Architecture 
 The SAP Data Services architecture consists of various tiers of user interface, platforms, and repositories. 
 SAP offers other products that complement SAP BODS and provide additional SAP BusinessObjects 
enterprise information management solutions. These include

 All the preceding tools can be used in conjunction with Data Services to conduct data profiling, data 
validation, and integration and maintain data governance. Data profiling is the process of verifying that data in 
the source system looks like what it should, even before integrating with other business data. Integrating data 
to be able to draw useful actionable insights requires that data be continuously analyzed and measured, and in 
order to do so in the correct manner, data must be cleansed and transformed according to business rules. 
 Basically, to provide data from which business users are able to take strategic decisions, it has to be
• 
 Accessed 
• 
 Cleansed 
• 
 Transformed 
• 
 Matched 
• 
 Reconciled 
• 
 Standardized 
• 
 Consolidated 
• 
 Analyzed 
• 
 Measured 
• 
 Optimized 
• 
 Automatized 
• 
 Improved 
 To improve data quality and meet business needs is a continuous process, as business requirements 
often change. To keep up with business needs, data transformation has to follow pace. For example, the 
business need at one point of time may require accessing and extracting only the data pertaining to order 
management, but as business requirements change, there may be newer requirements, such as to be  able to 
analyze customer data along with the order details. To perform this new task without disturbing the existing 
architecture, a robust architecture has to be in place from the beginning. A neat  ETL architecture allows the 
introduction of new data sources, without causing any friction to the existing solutions already in place. 
 ETL  architecture consists of the stages through which the  ETL   process goes, as rendered in Figure  4-7 . 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS DATA SERVICES
35
 There are usually three stages after the source system:
 
 1. 
 Raw 
 
 2. 
 Staging 
 
 3. 
 Data Warehouse 
 When fetching data from another business system such as ERP, CRM, or Finance, the first point of 
interaction is usually an FTP server, in which the flat files from the source systems are placed. The data from 
the flat files are read into raw tables that are an exact replication of the data in the source files. 
 The data from the raw tables is then cleansed and transported to the staging tables. Cleansing implies 
formatting the data types to a standardized format. For example, data formats from different source systems 
could be in different formats, or products could be defined in different ways in different source systems. The 
staging area takes care of applying such changes, to make the data ready for the onset of uniform business rules. 
 The next stage in the  ETL   architecture is the data warehouse. The data warehouse in the operational 
databases are normally relational: each table consists of attributes in columns and data values in rows. 
Different tables are joined to each other by relationships, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-
many, which  allow combining of data in different tables. RDBMS (relational data base management systems) 
are designed for transactional systems and not for historical data storage. Being able to query historical 
data is not the only reason for transforming the transactional data into data warehouses. Integrating data 
from different business systems and, at the same time, storing historical events and transactions from every 
system requires a data warehousing solution. 
 Figure 4-7.  The  ETL process, depicting how data is fetched from source systems and saved in a data 
warehouse, and the intermediate steps involved 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS DATA SERVICES
36
 The sharing of customer and sales data among business users is, for example, a case for a data 
warehouse solution. Data in the data warehouse is organized according to a dimensional model in a star 
schema. Star schemas are optimized for querying large data sets and are used in data warehouses and 
data marts to support BI and analytic applications and ad hoc queries for querying large data sets. Within 
the data warehouse or data mart, a dimension table is associated with a fact table by using a foreign key 
relationship. The dimension table has a single primary key that uniquely identifies each member record 
(row). The fact table contains the primary key of each associated dimension table as a foreign key. The fact 
tables contain the numeric measures, which are calculated fields such as sales, quantity, and total number 
of employees. The dimension tables contain attributes that reference the fact tables, such as geography, 
customer, product, etc. (see Figure  4-8 ). For example, sales data, such as revenue and quantity of products in 
the fact table, can be combined with product and geography dimension tables, to determine which products 
were sold and from which geographic location. 
 Star Schema 
 A star schema, as in Figure  4-9 , depicts the fact table, which contains numerical values, called measures, 
joined to dimension tables with a foreign key dependency. A foreign key dependency is a field one table 
that uniquely defines a row in another table. For example, the SalesPersonKey field in the Dimension table 
called  DimSalesPerson points to the one or more rows in the fact table called FactSales. This dependency, in 
business terms, determines the total number of products sold by a particular salesperson.  
 Figure 4-8.  A star schema with the  fact table containing the numerical values and the attributes in the 
dimension tables 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS DATA SERVICES
37
 A star schema takes into account the different levels at which the measures have to be calculated. This 
is known as granularity. For example, in a star schema, Units_Sold can be calculated at day, week, month, 
quarterly, or year levels. Similarly, Units_Sold can be calculated at Store_Number, State_Province, and 
Country levels. Units_Sold, when combined with the Dim_Product table, can yield Units_Sold at Product, 
Brand, and Product category levels. The  aggregation  of the measures occurs at the hierarchical levels of the 
dimensions. Figure  4-10 shows the fact table, which contains such measures as Amount_Sold and Quantity_
Sold. These measures can be calculated weekly, monthly, or yearly. The lowest granularity is that of a day, 
but the amount sold can also be aggregated to the yearly level. 
 Figure 4-9.  The foreign key depencies between the dimension tables and fact table       
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS DATA SERVICES
38
 Granularity in  Dimensional Models 
 The design of a star schema also involves  SCD  (slowly changing dimensions), which maintain changes to 
the attributes in the dimension tables. For example, a customer may change her name. It is important to 
think about the change from a business perspective, if it is vital for the business to store all the changes 
occurring in the dimensions. In real-life implementation, not all the changes are important from a business 
intelligence point of view. It can be interesting for the business to know if a customer moves from one 
location to another or the name of a product changes, in order to keep track of the units sold for the product 
or customer details, regardless of name changes. 
 The challenge for data warehousing is, thus, to be able to cleanse, transform, and integrate data from 
multiple disparate sources that run on different technical platforms and sometimes in different geographical 
locations. Moreover, the data-warehousing solutions have to consider the business rules applied, the slowly 
changing dimensions, and the level of granularity required. 
 There are two approaches to data-warehousing architecture: Bill Inmon architecture and Ralph 
Kimball architecture. A stable and scalable data architecture based either on Ralph Kimball or Bill Inmon 
principles of data warehousing has to be in place to encompass ever-changing business needs. The method 
of architecture that should be chosen depends entirely on the business requirements and the data set-up. 
Bill Inmon advocates an enterprise data warehouse that is segmented into data marts, depending on the 
business intelligence needs for analysis per business area. The Bill Inmon approach is to store all the source 
data in an enterprise data warehouse by means of an  ETL process (see Figure  4-11 ). The enterprise data 
warehouse data is then extracted and stored in  smaller segments, called data marts, which serve specific 
business needs. 
 Figure 4-10.  A  star schema data model, also called a dimensional data model 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS DATA SERVICES

 Ralph Kimball’s approach preaches creation of the data marts initially, which then are merged into an 
enterprise-wide data warehouse, storing data catering to an entire organization (see Figure  4-12 ). 
 Figure 4-11.    The  Bill Inmon architecture

 Ralph Kimball advocates the dimensional model, consisting of a star schema, as discussed previously. The 
 main advantage of a dimensional approach is that the data warehouse is easier for the end user to understand 
and to use. Also, the retrieval of data from the data warehouse tends to be quicker, due to fewer joins.

 Key Features 
 ETL   tools  are not just meant to transfer data from a source system to a target system; they are used for 
integrating, profiling, validating, and consolidating data. SAP Data Services also has a built-in optimizer that 
actually analyzes the  ETL jobs and pushes parts or the whole job to the database for processing, thereby 
load-balancing the job servers involved. If the Data Services job is using two source tables that belong to the 
same database schema and are connected by a join, the Data Services optimizer pushes the join condition 
to the database level, to fetch the data set that fulfills the condition. Data Services provides several functions 
for data cleansing and data validation. The data validation transformation is used to filter data according to 
certain given criteria. 
 Data validations can be tracked in pass or fail tables, to analyze the resulting data that ends up in the fail 
table, as in Figure  4-13 , which shows a data flow design in Data Services Designer. 
 Upon finding the reason for failure, the data can then be rectified and reloaded into the target data store. 
 As shown in Figures  4-14 ,  4-15 , and  4-16 , data validation rules can be handled in Data Services Designer 
very smoothly, by filtering rows that pass the validation rules and also raising alerts for data exceptions 
automatically. The rules can be specified, and the criteria for failure can be specified too, so when the 
data set does not meet the requirements, an exception is raised or e-mail sent. This functionality eases the 
process to manual interventions for data quality checks and exceptions.

 Operational statistics about data validation can be collected for further analysis. 
 SAP Data Services provides an entire library of transformations for data integration, data quality, 
conditional formatting, and text data processing, as shown in Figure  4-17 .

 While running jobs in Data Services, the monitoring window, as shown in Figure  4-18 , displays the 
status of the job run and also the statistics. The statistics displayed are very helpful in determining the time 
taken for each step in the process of extraction, transformation, and loading.

 Data Services provides a tool,  Data Services Object Promotion Management , which can be launched 
from the Administrator in the Data Services Management Console. It is a tool to promote objects and jobs 
between different environments, such as the development environment to the production environment. 
Administrators can transport the objects from a test to a development or to a production environment, using 
this tool to avoid overwriting and breaches in data security. 
 Data Services allows the creation of multiple file formats, using a wizard. Multiple delimited text files 
from either the job server or the local file system can be specified, and the wizard checks for multiple file 
format parameters for the row and column delimiters.  
 Technical Implementation  Details 
 To be able to provide a secure and scalable Data Services and Information Steward environment, the 
following products have to be installed first:
• 
 SAP Business Objects Information Platform Services (IPS), if you only want to use 
features of Data Services or Information Steward 
• 
 SAP Business Objects Business Intelligence platform (BI platform), if you also want 
to use Business Intelligence clients, such as Web Intelligence 
 These products provide platform services, such as SAP Data Services, use the SAP BusinessObjects 
Business Intelligence (BI) platform (or SAP BusinessObjects Information platform services) to exploit the 
scalable architecture that the platform provides. Server processes can be vertically scaled by running several, 
or all, server-side processes on one computer, for cost optimization, or horizontally scaled, by distributing 
the processes over a network of machines. Usually, multiple Data Services job servers or BI platform 
web applications are distributed on separate machines for load balancing and faster execution, thereby 
improving performance. 
 SAP Data Services  Installation 
 Once the  ETL  architecture has been set up, the implementation has to begin. The  ETL   developers build 
the end-to-end data flow of extracting data from source systems, transforming it, and loading it into the 
data marts. This process requires meticulous planning, development, and testing for good end results. An 
iterative process—developing and testing the results in short repetitive steps to get the best outcome—is 
recommended. 
 At least three instances of SAP Data Services present an ideal choice to develop, quality-check, and 
promote jobs to production.  ETL jobs are developed in the development environment, which, upon system 
testing, are promoted to the test environment. The test environment should hold a copy of production data, 
for accurate quality checks on the  ETL data flows. To be more specific about the process of testing, a data 
reconciliation exercise has to be carried out to validate the raw data against the computed data in the data 
warehouse or data marts, after the transformations. A data reconciliation process should convey a high level 
of data accuracy, to consider the  ETL architecture and development as a success. 
 Technical implementations of business intelligence or business analytics requirements begin with a 
business case, in which the business users likely want to analyze data from certain business areas. The next 
step is to capture the high-level requirements and prototype them, to get an approval on the agreement of 
the business case from the end users. Once the design is approved, the process of  exploring the sourcing for 
such analytical dashboards or reports comes into the picture. As explained, the sourcing of data may not be a 
simple task. To analyze a business requirement may entail integrating two or more IT systems. This is where 
SAP Data Services plays an important role. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS DATA SERVICES
46
 Because the data for the analytics dashboards and reports has to be up-to-date, the data content must 
be refreshed periodically. Some analytics solutions require weekly or monthly updates, but some may 
require the data to be refreshed daily. In order to automatize the data refresh, SAP Data Services has the 
functionality to schedule the  ETL jobs in the Management Console. The jobs can, however, be run manually 
from within the Designer interface too. The Management Console interface also provides functionality to 
trace error messages in the logs, which is very helpful for debugging purposes (see Figure  4-19 ). 
 Sample Implementation  
 After having gone through the technical advantages provided by SAP Data Services, let us focus on real-life 
examples of Data Services implementations. As the impact of monetization of data rises, so does the need 
to integrate heterogeneous data sources, to gain insights about the business performance metrics, customer 
behavior, and process optimization. Data for each business process does not necessarily reside on one 
technical platform, further complicating the process of integrating data sources. Businesses usually purchase 
several products to support one single purpose as ad hoc solutions, but soon enough, these ad hoc solutions 
turn into permanent solutions and have to be considered as sources during data consolidation. 
 Consider a telecom company, for example. Telcos typically have data in the following IT systems:
• 
 ERP : ERP systems generally handle data pertaining to product planning, material 
purchasing, inventory control, distribution, accounting, marketing, finance, and 
HR. There are various software vendors that provide ERP products, such as SAP, 
Microsoft, Oracle, Infor, and Epicor. 
• 
 CRM : CRM products cater to a broad range of business needs, such as managing 
customer data, customer interaction, and customer and business support. Some of 
the CRM vendors in the market include Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, Netsuite, 
and Marketo. 
 Figure 4-19.  The monitoring window in  SAP Data Services Management Console 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS DATA SERVICES
47
• 
 Billing : Billing handles the invoicing and revenue aspects of telecom operations. 
Common telecom billing software vendors are Single.eView, LogiSense, and Amdocs 
billing solutions. 
• 
 Mediation : Mediation systems are used to process call detail records (CDRs)for 
billing purposes. Data such as call duration, peak time, and call length are contained 
in CDRs. 
 Some use cases for data-driven marketing and sales include customer segmentation, to improve sales 
and satisfy more customers, and better and personalized tariff plans and credit scoring, to serve customers 
better at point-of-sale outlets. 
 The first business-use case—customer segmentation—requires not only gathering all customer-related 
data from the all the IT systems but also integrating market research data, to find patterns and trends in 
behavior analysis. Customer data resides in the ERP system for the products purchased by a customer, in 
the billing system for the invoicing, in the CRM system for the customer interactions with the company. 
Call detail records are stored in the mediation system and many other systems, such as order management, 
provisioning, etc. 
 In order to be able to segment the customer base, many factors have to be taken into account, and 
conditions must be determined for each segment, such as whether the segment will be based on geographic 
location, income category, or purchase capacity. Often, each segment has to contain detailed data regarding 
the most profitable customers and also potential customers, so that the latter can be converted into 
customers. The data from ERP, billing, and mediation reveals important aspects about the customer, such 
as the products owned, the billing history, how often the customer calls or messages, and at which times 
and from which destinations. If the market research data about customers’ purchase history, income, and 
number of family members can be combined with the internal data, this can yield valuable insights into 
what kind of customers buy the most phones, call most, whether they use streaming services, and how much 
data they consume. 
 The different systems that contain a variety of data regarding the customer are
• 
 ERP : Contains data about the product owned by the customer 
• 
 CRM : Maintains data about customer contact and interaction details 
• 
 Customer Care systems : Maintains data about customer complaints and  interactions   
with the customer care 
• 
 Billing : Contains data about customer invoicing history  
• 
 Mediation : Maintains data about customer call details 
• 
 Market research data : The external data regarding individuals that companies 
usually buy from market research companies. This data is useful in terms of getting 
to know more about customers’ socio-demographics, income, purchase history, etc. 
 To be able to blend data from internal IT systems and market research data, SAP Data Services is the tool 
that can consolidate data from all sources, using business rules and data-quality checks (see Figure  4-20 ).  

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS DATA SERVICES
48
 Data from each of the systems can be fetched in CSV (comma separated values) files and read into 
raw tables. The data in the raw tables should then be formatted and standardized to look as much alike as 
possible, to be able to consolidate. The data from  stage tables should then be stored in the data warehouse 
in a star schema, for quick and easy access via BI analysis tools, to generate insights about business 
opportunities and market conditions. 
 The preceding process of data blending from different businesses can be defined in terms of the 
following steps:
 
 1. 
 Identify the goal and business gain of a business analytics initiative.  
 
 2. 
 Determine the different milestones, and the deliverables in each of the 
milestones that contribute to the bigger roadmap. 
 
 3. 
 Identify the business processes that are involved in each of these milestones.  
 
 4. 
 Identify the supporting IT systems that support each of these business processes.  
 
 5. 
 Identify the data requirements and the IT systems that can deliver the same. 
 
 6. 
 Design the data architecture along with the data integrations required.  
 
 7. 
 Determine the business rules required to transform the data to deliver the 
insights. 
 Figure 4-20.    An  ETL   data flow in SAP Data Services Designer depicting a data integration from three different 
source systems 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS DATA SERVICES
49
 
 8. 
 Build the data flows from source systems into the data warehouse.  
 
 9. 
 Conduct tests and data quality checks to ensure the data integrations function as 
they should and that data integrity is maintained. 
 
 10. 
 Gradually integrate all the data sources required in the entire business analytics 
project. 
 
 11. 
 Operationalize the data flows between all the source systems, setting up alarms 
in case of data lapses. 
 
 12. 
 Maintain the data quality and integrity in the data warehouse by operationalizing 
data checks. 
 Some measures that have to be taken care of in every aspect of a business analytics project are to 
 maintain  data quality and a shorter time to market. Early adoption of new business solutions is made easier 
with quicker deliveries, early on in the project. 
 The second case is that of credit scoring of customers before selling them a service or a handset, in the case 
of in telecom companies. To avoid fraudulent customers or bad debt, it is vital to do some background checks 
about the customer, before selling a service. To facilitate such functionality for sales representatives, there has 
to be a lot of work done in the background, involving BI. Data from billing reveals the invoicing and payment 
details of an existing customer, which, when matched with external data about credit history, generates insights 
about a customer’s income, expenditures, loans, and derogatory information, if any. A credit score can be 
calculated based on a customer’s financial and invoicing history, when aligned with business rules. 
 To be able to build a system that generates credit scoring requires consolidating data from billing, 
mediation, and external sources that generate an overall credit profile of customers. This, again, entails a 
similar architecture of source data and then the  ETL architecture spanning raw, stage, and star schemas. In 
this case, however, it is vital to save historical data of customer credit reports and credit scores, to refer to a 
later stage. This would require implementing the SCD (slowly changing dimension), to be able to store all 
the historical stages of a customer’s credit report and credit score. 
 The technical IT systems involved in such a credit scoring model are as follows:
• 
 ERP : To check the current product owned by the customer and the product inventory 
• 
 Billing : To keep a check on past invoices or any reminders sent to customers  
• 
 Point-of-sale (POS) systems : The systems in stores in which sales agents place orders 
on behalf of customers or check inventory. The POS systems are connected to ERP 
systems. 
• 
 External systems for credit history : Credit history data is usually available in external 
systems that have consumer credit history data. 
 A customer inquiry to purchase a new product or service at a POS triggers a chain of processes, as 
illustrated in Figure  4-21 . The POS communicates with the ERP system, to check the inventory for stock; 
the billing or invoicing system, for the customer’s billing history; and the external credit history data, for the 
customer’s  historic credit data. The data from all the dependent systems are then sent to a credit scoring 
system, to deduce a score for the likelihood of a fraudulent customer.  

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS DATA SERVICES
50
 This score is then fed into the POS for the sales agent to decide whether to provide the customer with 
the desired service or product, depending on the customer’s probability of becoming a defaulter. 
 While the use-case diagram in Figure  4-21 may appear simple, in reality, such a robust solution entails 
a great deal of data integration between several IT systems. In the case of a telecom company wanting to 
implement such a credit-scoring model, IT systems such as ERP, billing, and external systems that house 
credit history have to be integrated through SAP Data Services. Data from each of the systems can be fetched 
by delivering  .csv files onto a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server from the source systems. 
 As in Figure  4-22 , the source IT systems deliver data in  .csv  files on FTP servers. At regular intervals, 
the  ETL jobs run scripts that check the presence of the files on the server. If the files are not found under 
the designated directories, the scripts ensure that an error message gets logged in the server and checks 
again intermittently for new files. If the data files are found, the  ETL   job processes the files by cleansing, 
transforming, and loading them into the  target systems, which, in this case, is the data warehouse. The 
data warehouse could be an Oracle data base or SQL server or any other database from any of the database 
vendors. The data from the data warehouse is then analyzed, using SAP Business Analytics dashboards or 
reporting solutions, to gather insights. 
 Figure 4-21.    The systems that communicate in the background when a customer makes an inquiry at a point 
of sale 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS DATA SERVICES
51
 Taking the example of a credit score, data from the data warehouse is then uploaded into the POS 
system, using the same mechanism of  .csv files on a FTP server. Once the data files from the data warehouse 
containing credit scores are placed on FTP servers, the POS system picks up the data files and uploads the 
data in the system, making the credit scores visible in the POS system for the salesperson in the store. Thus, 
a seemingly simple process involves several business processes and transcends several IT processes and 
systems, to deliver data and relevant information. 
  Figure 4-22.  A process for fetching from source systems files from the FTP server, via  ETL jobs 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS DATA SERVICES
52
 The third use case is that of designing more personalized tariff plans for services provided by telecom 
companies, in order to retain customers. To arrive at tariff plans that are more adapted to the customer 
needs, companies must first determine the customer needs. To do that, companies have to analyze 
customer call data and segment it according to their calling habits or Internet data-consumption habits. 
Data regarding call detail records reveal important insights about the destinations that a certain segment 
of customers call, the time they  call , and the duration that they call. If, for example, there are certain 
segments of customers that call abroad most of the time, then providing these customers with a tariff plan 
with reduced call charges for abroad will help improve customer retention. There could be other customers 
who call most frequently within the family. For such a segment, providing a tariff plan that allows reduced 
charges for family calling would definitely keep interest. 
 As in Figure  4-23 , in order to work out personalized campaigns or tariff plans that are targeted for 
certain customer segments, companies must get to know their customer better. Getting to know the 
customer better can only be achieved by gathering as much data as possible about the customer and 
analyzing the same to understand customer behavior, demographics, preferences, and the risk to churn. 
 In order to gain more insights into customer calling habits, data from ERP, invoicing systems, and CRM 
has to be blended with the  CDR (call detail record) data. ERP, invoicing, and CRM data generate insights 
about the customer’s current tariff plan, the customer’s handset, and invoicing details, while the CDR data 
generates insights about the actual calling details. Integrating the preceding systems involved can help 
in categorizing customers into frequent callers, frequent message senders, customers who mostly call 
abroad, or customers who mostly use their phones to access the Internet. To integrate data from different 
source systems,  ETL  processes have to fetch the source data, transform it  into standard formats that make 
data matching possible, and, finally, store the data in a data warehouse. Data from the source systems are 
extracted using  ETL  tools such as SAP Data Services, then cleansed and formatted in several steps, such 
as those known as raw and stage. The cleansed and transformed data is then stored in data warehouses or 
data marts for further consumption through reports and dashboards, thereby shielding business users from 
behind-the-scene technical complications. 
 Figure 4-23.    Gathering a holistic view of customer data from all business processes and IT systems 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS DATA SERVICES
53
 With all the advantages that SAP Data Services provides for data cleansing, transformation, and 
integration, it is an optimal tool for data integration purposes. As in Figure  4-24 , data from source systems is 
fetched using SAP Data Services, by fetching files from an FTP server.  
 Following are the steps involved in  ETL processes:
 
 1. 
 The  ETL architecture has to be defined with all the data integration points taken 
into account. 
 
 2. 
 The frequency of data loads has to be defined in accordance with how often the 
data from the source system is likely to be refreshed. 
 
 3. 
 The data  warehouse and data mart design has to be finalized before the  ETL 
processes begin. 
 
 4. 
 The business rules that determine the business logic that should be built into the 
 ETL flows should be decided in conjunction with business users. 
 
 5. 
 Data formatting rules should also be defined, along with business user inputs, for 
example, whether all phone numbers should be prefixed with a country code. 
 Figure 4-24.  An  ETL data flow facilitating end-to-end data flow 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS DATA SERVICES
54
 
 6. 
 Once all the data formatting and business logic and the design of target data 
stores, such as the data marts, are defined, the  ETL   work flow build in SAP Data 
Services can start. 
 
 7. 
 The  ETL  work flows, once developed, should be tested for data reconciliation 
and data quality and stress-tested for performance testing. 
 
 8. 
 Data from the data marts and data warehouses can be checked by business users 
with any of the SAP Business Analytics suite of products. 
 
 9. 
 The rule of thumb for any SAP Data Services  ETL implementation is to make sure 
that all the integrations with source system are established and stress-tested in 
the first layer, which is called the raw  layer  or the ingestion layer. The next layer, 
called the staging or transformation layer, transforms data, by applying business 
rules. The third and final layer, which is the data mart or data warehouse layer, 
should be designed keeping in mind reporting and dashboarding needs. The 
ability to drill up and down data depends on the granularity levels defined in the 
data warehouse. 
 Chapter   7  will elaborate the details of an end-to-end business analytics project, from requirement to 
architecture to analytics solutions.

 CHAPTER 5  
 SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform 
 Today, owing to businesses’ expanding online presence, there is an abundance of data. More and more 
consumers use mails and chats for communication and online services to book taxis and flights and tables at 
restaurants. All of this commerce relies on IT services, and, in order to optimize this technology, businesses 
must be able to evaluate their processes by visualizing information. 
 Businesses run on information, which is facilitated by IT systems, in the form of dashboards and 
reports. Business users are able to take strategically correct decisions regarding business investments or 
engagements, based on data. Data has always been vital to business, but in today’s connected world, we are 
inundated with ever-increasing amounts of data. It becomes imperative to empower business users with 
data, which is diverse and huge in volume, in a simple manner. Business users should be able to use data to 
gain insights into their business, and in the least amount of time possible. 
 Story-telling through data is what appeals to decision makers; data is not just about statistics. Because 
companies have realized the value of data, most businesses gather as much of it as possible, for use when 
the need arises. Easy availability of data leads to expectations within the business side of a company about 
insights gained from data. It is usually the responsibility of the IT department to convert raw data into 
information and to distribute the same within the organization, thereby raising awareness of data and 
promoting knowledge-sharing through collaboration among departments. In recent years, mobile solutions 
have seen a steep rise in popularity. This makes it vital that business analytics solutions be mobile-friendly, 
thereby making data available to business users on the go. 
 Introduction to the SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform 
 For a  business analytics tool to be effective, it should have the attributes discussed in the following list.
• 
 An intuitive, easy-to-use interface with drag-and-drop features to facilitate your 
data-driven decision making 
• 
 Easy traceability of communication, inquiries/disputes, splits, adjustments, and 
more 
• 
 Ease of use and the ability to distribute data to a wide audience through reports, 
dashboards, analytics, and self-service business intelligence (BI). Self-service BI lets 
users create their own reports for analysis purposes, rather than wait for IT to help them.  

CHAPTER 5 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS BI PLATFORM
56
• 
 Routine BI reports have to be refreshed every day, to reflect updated and fresh data. 
Instead of manually refreshing the data, reports can be scheduled to run during 
the night, or before office hours begin, so that business users have reports with 
updated data at the start of the day. It is important to automatize processes, such as 
scheduling, to reduce administration costs. Some business analytics tools use third-
party scheduling tools to automate running such tasks as running ETL (extraction, 
transformation, and loading) processes, to extract and load data into data 
warehouses or refreshing reports. It’s always better to choose a business analytics 
tool that has built-in scheduling features, so that an IT department does not have to 
maintain yet another system, i.e., scheduling tool.  
• 
 With the increase in the number of business processes being tracked, the number of 
IT systems that support such processes also increases. The amount of data from each 
such system increases too, resulting in problems with data storage and performance 
issues. If data retrieval is not optimized, it could result in high data latency. It is vital 
to choose a business analytics tool that scales and supports high performance and 
faster data retrieval, to cope with an ever-growing amount and variety of data.  
• 
 Business intelligence tools that have an open architecture integrate better with other 
platforms and software solutions. Open architecture reduces a product’s time to 
market by reducing the implementation time, to integrate a new business analytics 
solution into an existing ecosystem. 
• 
 BI solutions to be implemented must have the flexibility to connect to a wide range 
of databases. Some BI solutions support  databases from the same vendor, making 
it difficult for organizations to implement such solutions. Business analytics tools 
that are widely sought after have the capability to fetch data from multiple sources 
of data. As new databases emerge at an increasing rate, compatibility with a wide 
variety of databases becomes more important. Popular databases that are used by 
most organizations include Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySql, HANA, IBM DB2, 
SAP Sybase, PostgreSQL, Teradata, Amazon Simple DB. 
• 
 As more and more organizations want to be pro-active rather than reactive in their 
approach to customer engagement, real-time data insights are imperative. Business 
analytics tools should be able to handle real-time analytics. A lack of real-time data 
hinders decision making and greatly limits the advantages of BI. 
• 
 Some BI applications require embedding or integrating data or charts from other 
applications. Good BI tools make this process simple and flexible to save time on re-
creating the data flows from scratch. 
• 
 Modern BI tools must support all devices and platforms. BI applications must 
provide a seamless experience for business users, irrespective of device. 
• 
 Operational reporting capabilities designed to support the day-to-day activities 
of the organization, often scheduled to run nightly and delivered via e-mail or 
refreshed on portals, are an important consideration. If a BI tool does not support 
the preceding functionality and requires purchasing  additional   software to support 
e-mail and scheduling, this results in additional costs for the company. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS BI PLATFORM
57
 The SAP BusinessObjects BI platform provides IT departments with an effective means of sharing BI 
content across an entire organization, empowering business users to deep dive into data, in order to make 
informed decisions. 
 The BI platform is used to gain access to the data discovery, dashboards, and reporting features of an 
organization. It is a one-stop platform for the organization to distribute information to a wide audience of 
business users. 
 The following are solution  capabilities provided by the SAP BI platform:
• 
 Data discovery — SAP Lumira : SAP Lumira is a data discovery tool that makes 
combining and visualizing data from multiple sources very easy. Lumira provides 
data-preparation features to edit data, transpose values, rename certain attributes, 
create variables, or create hierarchies in the data set before the data can be 
visualized. Business users of all skill levels can prepare, visualize, and analyze the 
data to identify trends and patterns, with minimum IT help. SAP Lumira can be set 
up on-premise, in the cloud, or on the Web. 
• 
 Reporting — SAP Crystal Reports, SAP BusinessObjects Web Intelligence, and SAP 
BusinessObjects Explorer : Ad hoc and scheduled reporting capabilities are provided 
to business users to deliver meaningful insights that provide real value of data, which 
is consolidated from several IT systems, to business users. Simple to understand yet 
pixel perfect data visualizations that are able to be shared with external customers or 
partners are a key feature of SAP Business Analytics reporting tools. 
• 
 Business intelligence platform — SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform, SAP BusinessObjects 
Analysis edition for Microsoft, and SAP BusinessObjects Analysis edition for OLAP : BI 
platform tools provide reliable self-service access to BI data by business users. The BI 
platform is able to distribute data fast and smoothly to a wide business audience.  
• 
 Mobile analytics solutions — Analytics apps : SAP BI analytics mobile solutions allow 
business users to tap into the data, on the  move  . Mobile analytics also makes access 
to data seamless. 
 The SAP BI platform shields business users from the complexities of data, providing ready-to-use 
business intelligence data insights. The  semantic layer between the data sources and the business layers 
handles the data transformations, making it easier for business users. The semantic layers can manage a 
variety of data types and data sources from different database providers. 
 The SAP BI platform can use single sign on to login to several BI tools, making the experience seamless 
for users of the platform. The BI tools access control, and access to source database connections can also be 
managed on a single BI platform. Figure  5-1 shows a login screen for the SAP BI platform.

 Key Features 
 The SAP BusinessObjects BI platform provides many proven solutions that cater to key performance 
indicators (KPIs) driving business goals. In order to provide a scalable, efficient, and fast-performing 
platform, the SAP BusinessObjects BI platform is supported by a robust architecture in the background. 
 The SAP BI platform is supported by two main BI servers: the Adaptive Processing Server (APS) and 
the Adaptive Job Server (AJS). Much of the behind-the-scenes work done to support the BI platform is 
performed by the Adaptive Processing Server and the Adaptive Job Server. 
 The SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence platform can be thought of as a series of conceptual tiers. 
 Client Tier 
 The client tier is comprised of the desktop client applications that interact with the SAP BusinessObjects BI 
platform to provide a variety of reporting, analytic, and administrative capabilities. Examples include the 
Central Configuration Manager (CCM), Information Design Tool, and SAP Crystal Reports.  
 Web Tier 
 The web tier, consisting of web applications deployed to a Java web application server, provides SAP 
BusinessObjects BI platform functionality to end users through web browsers. Web tier examples include 
applications such as the Central Management Console and BI launchpad. Web Services, a part of the web 
tier, provides SAP BusinessObjects BI platform services, such as session authentication, user privilege 
management, scheduling, search, administration, reporting, and query management functionality, to 
software tools, via the web application server. An example is Live Office.  
 Management Tier 
 The management tier, which is the main tier and, therefore, also known as the intelligence tier, handles 
all the components that make up SAP BusinessObjects BI platform. The management tier consists of 
the Central Management Server (CMS) and the Event Server and associated services. The CMS contains 
configuration, auditing, and operation information. The Central Configuration Management also serves as a 
platform-management tool. Server Intelligence Agent (SIA) is responsible for starting the CMS. The servers 
responsible for the BI platform can be managed from within the CMS and the CCM. Figure  5-3 shows the 
how the SIA can be managed from the CCM.

 Storage Tier 
 The storage tier consists of the IFRS (Input File Repository System) and the OFRS (Output File Repository 
System), which handle the storing of reports and scheduled instances. The IFRS manages files that contain 
information pertaining to reports, such as the following file types:  .rpt ,  .car ,  .exe ,  .bat ,  .js ,  .xls ,  .doc , 
 .ppt ,  .rtf ,  .txt ,  .pdf ,  .wid ,  .rep , and  .unv . The OFRS stores the report scheduled instances created by the 
system, such as the following file types:  .rpt ,  .csv ,  .xls ,  .doc ,  .rtf ,  .txt ,  .pdf ,  .wid , and  .rep . The storage 
tier also manages server cashing, to reduce the I/O, for optimal server usage.  
 Processing Tier 
 The processing tier accesses data in databases to produce reports. The processing tier consists of the APS 
(Adaptive Processing Server), which is responsible for any post-processing of a publication job, including 
PDF merging and publication extension, and the AJS (Adaptive Job Server) is responsible for the Scheduling 
and Publishing Service. 
 Data Tier 
 The data tier contains data for BI reports, for example, report data in relational databases, OLAP data 
sources, and the actual universe files ( .unx and  .unv ) or system databases for the CMS, Auditing Data Store, 
Lifecycle management console, and Monitoring application. 
 Central Management Console 
 Most of the administrative operations for the BI platform are carried out in the web-based tool known as the 
Central Management Console (CMC). Some of the tasks that can be managed in the CMC are user creation, 
user group creation, server management, content promotion from test or development environment to 
production environments, and configuration of security settings. The CMC can also be used to customize 
the BI launchpad. 
 Administrators can log on to the CMC to manage user groups and granted rights. Administrators can 
assign access rights to users or user groups at folder level, universe level, or database connection level. 
 Server management is also done through the CMC. A group of servers run under a single SIA on a host. 
Servers can be created, stopped, and restarted in the CMC. In Figure  5-4 , the CMC home page displays all 
the functionalities available within CMC. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS BI PLATFORM

 Technical Implementation Details 
 The technical functioning of a BI platform implementation depends on the number of users that will access 
the platform, the number of client tools that must be made available, and the number of source systems to 
be integrated. 
 The types of BI platform users are as follows:
• 
 Information consumers : Information consumers are the BI platform users who 
require data in the form of PDFs or Excel, delivered to a portal or their mailboxes. 
Information users do not have to create their own reports or make changes to 
existing reports. This type of user can be classified as Reader Only. 
• 
 Business users : Business users are those who sometimes create simple reports or 
make adjustments in existing reports, to suit their requirements. Business users 
cannot perform complex tasks. 
• 
 Expert users : Expert users are usually the BI developers who are able to create reports 
from scratch and carry out heavy-duty development, both on the semantic layers 
and reporting and dashboard tools. 
 The number of users who need access will have to be defined by the license management. The number 
of servers required to support the BI platform depends on the number of tools that are made available 
through the tool (each service supported by a few number of servers), the number of users that have to 
access the platform, and the amount of content. The IFRS and OFRS sizes have to be adjusted according to 
the size of the content. If many users have to access the platform concurrently, the SAP BI platform-sizing 
guide should be used to derive the correct size and number of servers, to provide a robust, scalable platform. 
Figure  5-5  shows the server management functionalities provided in CMC, namely, configuring, starting, 
and stopping the servers for each service. 
 Figure 5-4.  CMC home page 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS BI PLATFORM

 Example of Implementation 
 The BI platform is, as has been stated, a one-stop platform for a variety of BI tools available to business users 
for business intelligence, including data discovery, reporting, dashboards, and scheduling. The BI platform 
handles the user access and security aspects of data in a very smooth manner. 
 New users can be added and access levels assigned to them individually or added to user groups. User 
groups can be created with certain access levels, to make it easier to add users at the group level. Figure  5-6  
shows user- and access-level management features provided by the CMC. New user groups can be defined, and 
users added to them, and access levels provided to user groups, or users can be edited from within the CMC.

CHAPTER 5 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS BI PLATFORM
63
 Organizations that start with a BI implementation usually start at a small scale, but as the volume of 
data grows over time, so does the number of source business systems that have to be integrated and the 
number of users who require access to the BI platform. In order to streamline the data-access process, there 
has to be a proper scalable data strategy in place, which is easily achieved when
• 
 The amount of data increases 
• 
 The number of data sources increases 
• 
 The number of new users increases 
 The SAP BI platform is a gateway to a number of BI tools that can be made available through a single BI 
platform. 
 Several needs inform business users’ ability to make good business decisions, such as data discovery, 
scheduled reports, or dashboards to check trends. 
 Let us consider an example of a train operator organization. A train operator has several processes 
involved within the business, each having unique needs and IT processes. There are also some business 
requirements that can be met by blending data from various systems. A train operator normally has a 
finance department, a ticketing system in which tickets are booked to keep track of sales, campaign systems 
that manage campaigns, social media management systems, and systems that manage the train timetables. 
Following are some typical business requirements:
• 
 Keeping track of the sales by following up on the number of tickets sold, the amount 
of food and drinks sold on board, and revenue generation through partnerships 
• 
 Accounting and financial management 
• 
 Keeping track of train timetables, trends pertaining to train punctuality, track quality, 
number of maintenance checks carried out  
• 
 Inventory control for onboard services 
• 
 Social media management dashboards 
 In order to fulfill the preceding business requirements, an SAP BI implementation with tools that 
uniquely cater to each of the requirements should be implemented. SAP Lumira is a tool used for data 
discovery, to gain insights about data by easy drag-and-drop and self-service mechanisms. 
 SAP BusinessObjects Explorer and Web Intelligence are the tools for ad hoc and scheduled reports that are 
required by business users on a timely basis, to follow up on finance and accounting or customer acquisitions. 
 SAP Dashboards are used to display trends in regard to the number of customers acquired, sales figures, 
train punctuality, onboard sales, etc. SAP Dashboards is a great tool for data visualization and creating 
interactive dashboards. The dashboards connect to various data sources to display data, using various 
components, such as charts, graphs, and buttons, to help the dashboard consumer identify trends and make 
informed business decisions. 
 In the background, the data sources could be SAP BW running on SAP HANA, which is connected through 
a Bex connector in the IDT (Information Design Tool), or any other database, such as Oracle or SQL Server. 
 The BI platform in this example shields the business users from the complexities of the data sources, the 
connections required, and the underlying server architecture, thereby allowing them to focus on business 
goals. The BI platform has various servers in place to support the BI client tools, such as Dashboards, Web 
Intelligence, Lumira, Crystal Reports, and Explorer. The users and user groups are managed by the SAP BI 
platform on a single platform that leads to data access to various client tools, thereby easing the process for 
both business users and an IT department. 
 An SAP BI implementation in the preceding case can be elaborated as follows:
 
 1. 
 The project should be initiated with a business case outlining the business gains 
of a business analytics implementation. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS BI PLATFORM
64
 
 2. 
 Once the business case has been defined with the goals in mind, the goals can be 
defined as targets during different milestones. 
 
 3. 
 In order to achieve the milestones in an analytics project, the data required 
to achieve the target, the tools required, and the team that will execute the 
implementation have to be defined and in place.  
 
 4. 
 The data visualization requirements have to be analyzed to be able to choose 
the tool that is best suited for a particular requirement. For example, SAP 
BusinessObjects Web Intelligence is a good tool for static reports, while SAP 
Analysis is good for ad hoc analysis that business users can carry out themselves  
 
 5. 
 The ETL architecture and the business rules for data cleansing, formatting, and 
loading have to be defined early on in the process, to ensure data availability for 
analytics. 
 
 6. 
 The financial data from SAP BW, social media data, data from booking systems, 
data from ancillaries, data from partner sites, etc., has to extracted from the source 
systems and loaded into a data warehouse. The data warehouse could be an Oracle 
or Microsoft SQL Server or SAP HANA, or any other vendor database, based on the 
business requirements. The data in the data warehouse is stored in star schemas, 
as in Figure  5-7 , to facilitate data visualization in business analytics tools.  
 Business analytics tools are a means of achieving the goal of spreading knowledge and democratizing 
data within an organization. The key factors that facilitate this, however, are having a well-thought-out 
business analytics strategy roadmap and defining a winning business analytics team that will execute the 
strategy. 
 Figure 5-7.  A star schema design with fact and dimension tables 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS BI PLATFORM
65
 A Business Analytics Strategy Roadmap 
 For a business analytics implementation to be successful at an enterprise level, a business analytics strategy 
defining the goals, the milestones, roles, and business processes that need to be taken into account has to 
be defined first, before deciding on the tool set for implementation. A business analytics strategy should be 
designed to be agile and adaptive and as a continuous process for improvement. 
 A business analytics initiative in an organization starts with creating a business case outlining the 
business gain of such an implementation and the factors that facilitate a successful implementation, as in 
Figure  5-8 . The business case, when approved by the CIO or CTOs after careful scrutiny, leads to a business 
analytics strategy roadmap definition. 
 A more detailed business analytics plan, stemming from the overall strategy defining the data, tools, 
processes, and deliverables at every stage of the project, has to be defined, as in Figure  5-9 . This plan can 
then be refined, to further break down the deliverables into small iterations of development and testing. 
 Figure 5-8.  The factors that define a successful business analytics strategy 
 Figure 5-9.  A high-level business analytics plan 
 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS BI PLATFORM
66
 A business analytics strategy should be aligned with the overall enterprise strategy, to deliver value to 
the business and to the customers. There are certain proven practices that have been widely accepted in the 
BI field, and organizations can take advantage of these best practices by tweaking and implementing those 
bits that suit their business. These can serve as broad guidelines, in terms of things to do and things to avoid 
for ensuring success of the BI initiative. 
 Tasks to ensure success of the BI strategy include the following:
• 
 Creating a business case and outlining the expected advantages of each project, as in 
Figure  5-10 
• 
  Obtaining buy-in from stakeholders is vital, not only to find a sponsor for the 
business case, but also to make the business side adapt to the BI implementation. 
Each of the solution streams, and the value generated from them, has to be 
presented to the stakeholders, to choose the best course of action, taking into 
account the time to market, cost, and agility. 
• 
  Adapting best practices and standards within the industry domain in question 
• 
  Performing a current state, future state, and gap analysis, which in turn will serve as 
the foundation for a BI implementation plan, as diagrammed in Figure  5-11 
• 
  Taking actionable and small steps, instead of big-bang implementations. For 
example, building an ETL data flow that calculates the total amount by multiplying 
the units sold with the unit price. Testing the preceding workflow should include 
checking the data in the source systems and conducting a data reconciliation.  
  Figure 5-11.    Business analytics gap analysis, which serves as the foundation of an analytics strategy 
 Figure 5-10.  Creating a business case for a business analytics implementation 
 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS BI PLATFORM
67
• 
 Defining data and business rules governance, for example, maintaining the master 
data for products in one master data source to avoid duplicate and redundant data 
sources. It should be mandatory to define each product in a product master, along 
with all its attributes, for consumption across an enterprise, using this as the single 
version of truth. 
• 
 Using an iterative implementation approach, testing every step. It is very important 
to unit-test every analytics development, before testing the integration with other 
data flows. If the individual data flows do not function well, overall data quality 
suffers. 
• 
 Working with frameworks and adopting proven methodologies, not by the book, but 
by making adjustments to suit each organization’s business needs  
• 
 Identifying related gaps and issues that hinder the BI implementation from creating 
value 
• 
 Documenting and analyzing the constraints and assumptions that are considered 
while designing a business analytics strategy. The assumptions can change in the 
future, thereby changing the circumstance of implementation of a strategy and 
giving rise to new opportunities that will have to be addressed. 
 The potential issues that have to be avoided when designing a business analytics strategy are as follows:
• 
 It is never advisable to build data silos and person dependency, meaning that team 
members should be able to step into each other’s roles and perform the tasks, which 
can be achieved by knowledge-sharing. 
• 
 A big bang implementation approach is seldom a successful implementation plan. 
It has been proven that an iterative implementation, by incorporating the business 
users’ feedback into the implementation early on, works best.  
• 
 A business analytics roadmap document stating the present and future goals should 
be the basis of a BI strategy. It is not commendable to set on a business analytics 
implementation path without a business analytics roadmap.  
• 
 A business analytics strategy must not only focus on data integration and state of-
the art BI tools. A business analytics strategy should be comprehensive enough, 
including team structure, responsibility sharing, and division of work.  
• 
 A business analytics strategy should not be inflexible. Businesses change their 
business processes pretty often, and having a rigid business analytics framework 
will make it very difficult for the business analytics team and tools to adapt to the 
changes. A business analytics strategy should be constantly tuned and adjusted to 
reflect the changing needs of a business. 
 An as is state should be analyzed to identify problem areas and arrive at a to be plan. Only then should 
an analytics implementation plan be designed. An ideal plan should account for the capacity of both human 
and software resources such as servers, system performance, data quality, data security, metadata control, 
and data-retention policies. For example, high level decisions made about data retention impacts data 
architecture, such as partitioning of the data, as well as technical architecture, such as disk storage. More 
detailed decisions regarding whether all or most of the logic that corresponds to business rules should be 
handled in ETL or in reports has to be outlined, to develop solutions that are uniform across an enterprise. 
 The next section describes the structure and functioning of a business analytics team, which is one of 
the most vital aspects of an analytics implementation.  

CHAPTER 5 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS BI PLATFORM
68
 A Typical BI Team Structure 
 An efficient BI team consists of both technical and business analysts, who help implement the business 
analytics strategy roadmap. By utilizing business and technical experts together, outcomes can generally be 
met sooner and more accurately than if the teams were separate. 
 As in Figure  5-12 , it is vital to clarify and define the team structure, roles, responsibilities, and 
deliverables expected from each team member. This not only ensures right balance of work distribution but 
also helps seal loopholes, if any, in terms of skillsets. 
 Following are the main roles and responsibilities of a business analytics team:
• 
 Business analysts : They are the bridge between the BI and business teams, such as 
marketing, sales, or pricing teams 
• 
 Business subject matter experts : These are the people in the organization who 
work on the source systems, such as marketing, sales, invoicing, and are business-
oriented, therefore being knowledgeable about business data. Typical examples of 
such team members are business controllers. 
• 
 Solution architects : These are the professionals in charge of the design of the data 
warehouse and the technical setup of the business analytics implementation  
• 
 ETL developers : These are team members, specializing in ETL, who understand the 
organizational data and build ETL solutions to achieve business insights. 
• 
 Report developers : These team members develop reports and dashboards to visualize 
data. 
• 
 Data analysts : These are the team members responsible for analyzing data, in 
order to provide business insights, by having a thorough understanding of business 
processes and business data. Business analysts also make good data analysts.    
 Figure 5-12.  Key steps in defining an analytics team structure 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ SAP BUSINESSOBJECTS BI PLATFORM
69
 The preceding roles do not have to be assumed by entirely different people. A solution architect can also 
function as an ETL developer and/or data analyst, thereby spreading knowledge within the organization. 
 A BI team not only works on new development to meet new business requirements but also has to 
maintain the BI operations on a day-to-day basis, for example, ensuring the nightly ETL loads and running 
the reports and dashboards to refresh data. Some organizations have separate teams that take care of BI 
operations and BI development. But it is good practice to rotate the team members within both teams, to 
encourage the spread of knowledge. Peer design review meetings are a good way to spread knowledge and 
get feedback on architecture and data flow designs. 
 A BI team needs to adapt to the best of the best practices within the field of analytics, gaining knowledge 
and reducing latency in delivering business value. 
 A successful business analytics implementation relies not only on the tools, processes, and technical 
architecture but mainly on the overall business analytics strategy and the roadmap defined before the 
inception of the analytics implementation.

 CHAPTER 6  
 SAP Analytics Products 
 In this chapter, you will learn about the various SAP Business Analytics offerings and the business cases for 
the same. While there are myriad business analytics tools, each tool is best suited to a particular use case. 
 Introduction to Each Product 
 Analytics helps to unlock the real value of business data.  Data monetization is a very important aspect of 
today’s digital business. In order to gain the maximum possible advantage from a business’s key performance 
indicators, the business data has to be blended with data from several source systems, to be analyzed and 
generate value that leads to reduced churn, better customer experience, and increased revenue. 
 As illustrated in Figure  6-1 , the parameters that define the success rate of business analytics 
implementations or  practices depend on various factors—from defining the overall goal and strategy to 
understanding the business requirements and finding the right skills for their implementation.  
 Be it media, gaming or financial industries, every organization should be able to leverage data to keep 
a check on key performance indicators, preferably in real time. Gone are the days of running batch jobs to 
update data warehouses that stored historical transactional data. To be able to gain maximum output from 
 Figure 6-1.  The  critical factors that define the success rate of business analytics 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP ANALYTICS PRODUCTS

analytics solutions, organizations have to integrate several disparate systems to gain a 360-degree view of 
their business and customers. For example, to check the value of an entire customer life cycle—the complete 
customer journey from acquisition through all transactions the customer has had with the company—
demands analysis. To analyze the entire customer journey, data from such systems as ERP, CRM, customer 
service, and billing and invoicing must be integrated. Some business requirements are business-critical and 
demanding, which makes it even more important that data be of a high quality, available, and fast to query. 
 Simple,  easy-to-understand data visualization is the demand of the day. C-level executives need a 
beautiful interface with dashboards projecting the KPIs (key performance indicators) that drive business 
goals, while financial analysts have to dig into data and analyze and crunch the numbers themselves. The 
SAP BI Analytics toolset has a solution for every analytics need, be it storytelling through data, pixel-perfect 
reports for external partners, or invoices sent to customers. 
 Business analytics is a continuous method to optimize business processes, improve business efficiency, 
and aid revenue generation. Because it is a continuous process, the  iteration cycle has to be repeated over 
and over. A business analytics process is mainly composed of the following stages (also see Figure  6-2 ):
• 
 Define the problem or the goal of the project 
• 
 Gather data by means of data integrations and ETL work flows 
• 
 Use some of the SAP Business Analytics suite of products to visualize the data 
• 
 Analyze the data to deduce the factors that lead to insights 
• 
 Execute insights generation, to understand the customer base and the product sales 
figures 
• 
 Optimize the processes that lead to better business performance, based on the 
insights generated by business analytics initiatives  
• 
 Once the business processes are optimized, the response from them should undergo 
the same process cycles: gather data, analyze it to understand how the process 
transformations have fared, and optimize them further.  
• 
 This cycle of optimization and testing is an ongoing one for existing business 
processes and IT systems, as well as for any new systems that are introduced into a 
business scenario.

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP ANALYTICS PRODUCTS
73
 SAP Business Analytics tools support the preceding expedient way of functioning at an enterprise level 
by providing quick time-to-market solutions. SAP BI tools are always updated with the latest patches, to keep 
them in sync with the latest market requirements, and all the tools are backward compatible, with previous 
versions to facilitate transitions to newer platforms. SAP BI has a neat licensing model, making it simple to 
purchase new or similar-but-upgraded versions of a business analytics product. 
 The SAP Business Analytics product portfolio is classified into reporting, discovery and analysis, 
dashboards and applications, and office integration, as illustrated in Figure  6-3 . Each category has products 
suited to specific business needs. The reporting needs of an organization deal with routine reporting to 
visualize data in a more detailed format. Discovery and analysis requirements of an organization are met 
by delving deep into data and slicing and dicing it, which is done by analysts.  Dashboards display KPIs and 
metrics  in graphical interfaces. 
 SAP Business Analytics products serve a great number of business requirements, from data discovery to 
mobile apps. Following is a list of business analytics tools, according to their function. 
 Reporting 
 This encompasses gathering and presenting data in a manner that makes it simple to understand the end 
consumer of the information. Reporting empowers end users with the knowledge to becoming expert in 
their area of business. The reporting tools provided by the  SAP Business Analytics suite of products are
• 
 SAP BusinessObjects Web Intelligence 
• 
 SAP Crystal Reports 
• 
 SAP BusinessObjects Explorer 
 Reports can be run by choosing certain time intervals or other filters. Reports are also delivered to 
business users’ mailboxes in the form of PDFs or Excel files or to reporting platform inboxes.  
 Data Discovery and  Analysis 
 SAP Lumira is the SAP process for data discovery, analysis, and visualization that features beautiful 
interactive graphs and infographics for impactful storytelling with data. SAP Lumira is fundamentally a self-
service data visualization application for business users.

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP ANALYTICS PRODUCTS
74
 Owing to the columnar data storage mechanism used by Lumira, it retrieves data very quickly. A column-
oriented database management system (DBMS) stores data tables as sections of columns of data, rather than 
as rows of data. Most relational databases store data in rows. As the column-based databases store only single 
columns of data, rather than entire rows, indexes are generally much smaller than the main table. By scanning 
smaller sets of data, the number of disk operations is reduced, thus making data retrieval faster. 
 Lumira has data-preparation features that are able to fetch data from Excel, SAP HANA, SQL, and SAP 
BW and blend it from these various sources. The data set can be further enriched by creating variables 
or hierarchies to enhance the data visualization and drill through it from the lowest level to the highest 
aggregation. 
 Dashboards and  Applications 
 Design Studio and SAP Dashboards are the SAP dashboard products. Dashboards offer near real-time data 
visualization with capabilities to embed the dashboards into portals or e-mails. Dashboards are also mobile-
compatible, making them available on tablets. 
 Dashboards contain various components, such as charts, graphs, and buttons, that are connected to 
data sources, to fetch data. The graphs and charts help the dashboard’s consumers to visualize data and find 
trends and patterns, in order to make informed business decisions. 
 The main difference between reporting and dashboarding is that reports display a snapshot of the last 
refreshed data, whereas dashboards display near real-time data that is continuously refreshed from source 
systems through data connections. 
 Office Integrations 
 The BusinessObjects Live Office solution integrates seamlessly with Microsoft (MS) Office products. The 
huge advantage of integrating BusinessObjects Live Office into MS Office products is that data consumers do 
not have to learn new analytics tools. They can continue working with tools that they are used to, such as MS 
Excel or MS PowerPoint. Data from BusinessObjects Universes, Crystal Reports, and Web  Intelligence   can be 
fetched into Excel or PowerPoint via BusinessObjects Live Office. 
 Key Features of Each Product 
 Business Intelligence Platform 
 The Business Intelligence platform is one central platform from which to access many of the analytics 
products mentioned in the preceding section. As in Figure  6-2  and Figure  6-3 , Web Intelligence, Crystal 
Reports, and analysis for  OLAP (online analytical processing) and Lumira can be accessed from BI launch 
pad (see Figure  6-4 ). 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP ANALYTICS PRODUCTS
75
 BI launch pad allows users to access various analytics tools with a single login and on a single platform, 
thereby making the BI launch pad user-friendly (see Figure  6-5 ). The other aspect of accessing the analytics 
tools on a single platform makes the data governance easier, as it is only a single platform that requires data 
access rules, rather than individual platforms. 
 The SAP BI platform shields business users from the complexities of data, providing them ready-to-use 
business intelligence data insights. The semantic layer between the data sources and the business layers 
handles the data transformations, making it easier for the business users. The semantic layers can manage a 
variety of data types and data sources from different database providers.

 Business Analytics Tools 
 In this section, we delve into the details of each individual analytics tool. Each SAP Business Analytics tool 
serves some technical and functional requirements, as mentioned in the previous section. Organizations 
have to choose the right tool for the right job, after having analyzed their business requirements and the 
flexibilities provided by the SAP Business Analytics tools. 
 SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio 
 SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio allows designers to create applications for analysis and dashboards, 
based on SAP NetWeaver BW, SAP HANA, and BusinessObjects Universe data sources. Design Studio can be 
accessed as a stand-alone application as well, on the BI launch pad, SAP NetWeaver, or SAP HANA platform. 
Design Studio, apart from the obvious data-visualization functionalities, provides SDK support that enables it 
to access data from several sources. Figure  6-6 shows the home page of the SAP Design Studio designer, from 
which new applications can be created, recently used applications can be launched, and data sources added.  
 SAP Design Studio gives users the flexibility to create analysis applications based on SAP Netweaver, 
SAP HANA, and Universe, for browsers and mobile devices. 
 The main key features of SAP Design Studio are that it
• 
  Offers full support for SAP NetWeaver BW and SAP HANA data models and engine 
capabilities 
• 
  Provides design tools to create applications, thereby eliminating the need for native 
HTML or iPad UI programming skills 
• 
 Can be used locally as well as embedded into the BI platform or integrated into SAP 
 HANA and SAP NetWeaver 
 Figure 6-6.  Design Studio designer home page 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP ANALYTICS PRODUCTS

• 
 Provides SDKs to further customize the default visualization features, thus allowing 
access to a broad range of data sources, such as web services and local files 
 Mobile Business Intelligence— SAP BusinessObjects Mobile App 
 This provides access to insights on the go for business users. SAP Mobile BI supports visualizations on SAP 
BusinessObjects, Web Intelligence, SAP Crystal Reports, SAP BusinessObjects Explorer, SAP Lumira, SAP 
Dashboards, and SAP Design Studio. 
 The SAP Mobile BI app can be customized to meet the specific needs of an organization. SAP Mobile BI 
has extensive features for smarter visualization capabilities, such as graphical cubes, customized maps, etc. 
SAP Mobile solutions are easy to deploy and distribute. Dashboards can be embedded into mobile apps, to 
make analytics a part of transactional apps. Employees are becoming more and more dependent on mobile 
devices, and some organizations also have a BYOD (bring your own device) policy, which makes it even 
more important to have a mobile BI strategy in place.  
 SAP Lumira 
 SAP Lumira is a fast, lightweight, in-memory server, platform, and portal. It facilitates quick deployment and 
sharing of information across departments, without much IT involvement. SAP Lumira can be downloaded, 
installed, configured, and prepared for usage very quickly. The installation process involves just a few clicks. 
 One of the key features of SAP Lumira is its ease of use and negligible learning curve. After having 
explored business data, discovered hidden insights, and created interactive visualizations, it is possible to 
share this content via the SAP Lumira Edge portal. The content resides in the SAP Lumira Edge document 
library and is available for easy viewing and interactive consumption via a web browser. 
 SAP Lumira can be purchased as a personal edition or in the standard edition, the personal edition 
being free for download. The personal edition allows data import from  .xls and  .csv  files, but the standard 
edition allows data import from databases and SAP HANA apart from  .xls and  .csv files. Some other key 
features of SAP Lumira include the following:
• 
 Easy to combine data from disparate sources in huge volumes  
• 
 Allows quick and easy ways to add calculations and groupings of data without any 
scripting or coding involved 
• 
 The data set analyzed in Lumira can be published to the SAP BI platform or exported 
to  .xls or  .csv files, to SAP Explorer (to be used as an information space), or to SAP 
HANA, as an analytic view. 
• 
 SAP Lumira can import data from a multitude of sources, such as  .xls or  .csv files 
and SAP HANA, or Apache Hadoop SAP BW, and freehand SQL query, to connect to 
a database. 
• 
 Data visualizations can be shared as stories, by combining graphics, text, and 
descriptions,  linking to web sites or to another page in the story. 
 SAP  Web Intelligence 
 This feature allows end-user flexibility, by providing trusted data from multiple sources. 
 The SAP Business Intelligence implementation is fairly simple and has a shorter time to market, making 
it very agile and lean. SAP Web Intelligence delivers new reports faster, meeting business requirements at 
an accelerated pace. Both the implementation and the development of new reports is fairly simple, thereby 
eliminating the need for many IT resources previously required.

 SAP  Crystal Reports 
 SAP Crystal Reports allows easy, affordable, self-serve information access to reports, dashboards, and search 
and exploration documents. SAP Crystal Server software delivers secure, personalized information sharing 
through a single semantic layer and server. 
 SAP Crystal Reports can connect to almost any data source—relational or OLAP,  .xls files, and XML. 
 Crystal Reports distribution within an organization can be managed independently with the Crystal 
server or embedded into business processes through office documents or portals, such as Microsoft Office 
and Microsoft SharePoint, or into applications, through  SDKs (software developer kits). 
 Major advantages of Crystal Reports are
• 
 Ease of use with a graphical interface 
• 
 Multisource data support 
• 
 Ability to create feature-rich pixel-perfect reports 
• 
 Ease of integrating Crystal reports into other applications, with SDKs 
• 
 That it is an enterprise reporting solution that can be made available via the Web or 
portals, making distribution to a large audience fairly simple.     
 SAP  BusinessObjects Analysis 
 The SAP BusinessObjects Analysis edition for Microsoft Office is an Office add-in for multidimensional ad hoc 
analysis of OLAP sources in Excel. SAP BusinessObjects Analysis also allows BI presentations in PowerPoint. 
SAP BusinessObjects Analysis connects to SAP BEx queries, SAP NetWeaver BW, and SAP HANA. 
 SAP BusinessObjects Analysis provides the functionality that allows multiple cross tabs in a single Excel 
workbook with data from several sources, with easy-to-use drag-and-drop features. 
 SAP  BusinessObjects Explorer 
 Business Explorer is a simple, intuitive tool to search for and drill down into data in BusinessObjects 
Universe, SAP HANA, or spreadsheets uploaded to the tool. Business Explorer can handle real-time data 
and does not require technical expertise, owing to its simplicity of use. Business Explorer can be accessed 
through the BI launch pad 
 Factors That Should Be Taken into Consideration While 
Choosing the Right Tool 
 As discussed, SAP provides a  plethora of tools and services to serve the analytics requirements of an 
organization. Choosing the right tool for the right job, however, can be an overwhelming experience. Before 
selecting the right tool for the job at hand, organizations should evaluate their analytics needs against the 
tool, to determine the right fit.
• 
 Must-haves : These are the key features that are absolutely necessary for meeting 
a business’s analytics requirements, for example, the use of Hadoop to integrate 
big data. In the era of big data analytics, every customer interaction, every digital 
footprint, every tweet or Facebook share and like has become a vital source for 
generating business insights. To capture data that runs into petabytes, a big data 
solution such as Hadoop is required. SAP HANA allows integration with Hadoop, 
thus blending both structured data from points of sale, supply chains, ERP and CRM 
systems with unstructured data from social media.  

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP ANALYTICS PRODUCTS
79
• 
 Nice-to-haves : The nice-to-have requirements could be defined as the ones that are 
not going to be used in the near future but could be an added value nevertheless. For 
example: being able to export reports into PDF format may not be a necessity, but it 
may be useful at some point of time, so it’s good to know whether an analytics tool 
provides that feature. 
• 
 Not-required : Analytics tools can provide a lot of features that are not useful to an 
organization, thereby making them out of scope for evaluation. For example, a tool 
might provide integration possibilities with SAP NetWeaver, but the organization 
may not have plans ever to implement SAP NetWeaver.    
 Following are some key features of business analytics tools to consider when deciding whether or not a 
tool is the right one:
• 
 Support for multiple data sources. In most organizations, there are multiple IT 
products, and it is a good analytics solution to have support for data integration with 
these sources. 
• 
 Data blending is a very important business requirement today, with more and more 
businesses analyzing the holistic view of a customer with data from multiple sources. 
It is important, therefore, to choose a BI tool that  supports   data blending from 
disparate sources. 
• 
 Web- and mobile-based interfaces are also important criteria to consider. Having a 
web-based interface eases the distribution of information among users, while mobile 
BI is becoming a predominant requirement for busy business users on the go. 
• 
 Visualization features with bars, graphs, pie charts, cross tabs and trend lines are a 
necessity for business users seeking to present data in an interactive way. 
• 
 Time to market is one of the most important factors to consider. If the time taken 
to implement a certain product is too long, it will not solve any near-term business 
requirements, which also could change by the time the product is fully rolled out.  
• 
 SDKs and plug-ins to embed business analytics tools into portals or other 
applications, such as SharePoint, should be considered.  
• 
 Data security is also one of the most important criteria to consider. A business 
analytics tool should be able to provide a means to restrict data access in a 
distributed environment. While most BI tools do provide data-access-granting 
mechanisms, the key is to find a tool that makes the process simple. 
• 
 The ability to export data to a PDF or Excel file or send it as mail attachments directly 
from the analytics tool are some other features to look for in a business analytics tool. 
• 
 Ease of upgrading the tools and the content in an easy manner is essential. 
• 
 Business analytics tools should provide the ability to create variables and formulae, 
drilling data into hierarchies, and easy report-customizing features.  
• 
 Scalability is an important aspect to consider for growing business needs. The 
amount of analytics content, the number of simultaneous users accessing the 
system, and the number of source systems that have to be integrated could increase 
exponentially, and a robust  business analytics toll should be able to handle these 
changes. 
• 
 In-memory capability is also an important business requirement these days, owing 
to huge amounts of data having to be analyzed on the fly. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP ANALYTICS PRODUCTS
80
• 
 Another important aspect to consider while choosing the right business analytics 
tool is learning curve. If a tool requires a huge amount of effort to learn on the part of 
users, then its adoption will be slow. 
 Consideration of all the preceding points while choosing the right tool serves as a guideline. There will, 
of course, be tools that match certain business requirements, but not all. But choosing a business analytics 
solution can mean a huge business investment; therefore, it is important to consider ROI (return on 
investment) before taking the plunge. 
 Implementation Case Study 
 Now that I have discussed the features of some of the main business analytics products offered by SAP and 
those to look for when choosing analytics products, let’s consider a sample implementation. 
 Most organizations have several IT systems supporting the business processes that are their backbone. 
To understand which business processes or sales campaigns yield the most value, organizations have to 
measure the impact of business processes. Analytics is all about identifying and analyzing the factors that 
lead to the highs and lows of business performance, optimizing the processes further and measuring the 
impact of changes. 
 A media house that I worked for has many operations, apart from an online newspaper—online 
advertising, online health clubs, and classifieds. Each of these business areas has several KPIs, as illustrated 
in Figure  6-7 . 
 Each business area is defined separately, supported by different processes, and the KPIs are measured 
differently. For example, digital news sales are defined by the number of new customers acquired, whereas 
sales for online advertising could be both the number of customers that have paid to advertise their services, 
as well as the revenue generated from the number of clicks that each ad generates. The digital news is 
supported by various  IT systems , such as
• 
 Content management systems 
• 
  Web analytics systems to analyze the incoming traffic on the sites  
• 
  Sales systems that handle sales of new subscriptions  
• 
  CRM systems that handle customer data as well as marketing campaigns 
 Figure 6-7.  Business areas of a  media organization and  key performance indicators for each area 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP ANALYTICS PRODUCTS
81
• 
 Invoicing systems that manage invoices sent to customers and accounting systems 
• 
 Ad servers that handle the ads displayed on the sites 
 Each of the preceding systems manages a specific type of function and so has data pertaining to that 
particular function. The data from the preceding systems are stored in some kind of database, and each system 
may allow simple reporting features to display metrics. But for analytics, the data from each business process 
has to be stored in a  data warehouse , which then feeds reports and dashboards, as illustrated in Figure  6-8 .  
 The data from source systems can be fetched using SAP Data Services as explained in Chapter   4 . Ad hoc 
reports are generated using SAP Web Intelligence, which is available to business users on the BI launch pad 
as well as via mail, as PDFs. SAP Lumira is used by the business controllers to analyze sales and marketing 
campaign data. SAP Design Studio is used to visualize the trends in sales and also the online traffic data, 
which provides near real-time data. 
 Business critical data resides in each of the source systems.
• 
 CRM 
• 
 ERP 
• 
 Social Media 
• 
 Invoicing 
• 
 Content 
• 
 Image processing 
 Figure 6-8.  Data from  source systems is stored in a data warehouse that is a central data repository for 
enterprises 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP ANALYTICS PRODUCTS
82
• 
 Contact center 
• 
 Ad servers 
• 
 Campaign systems 
• 
 Web analytics 
 Data in each system  caters to one particular business process, and although some ERP or CRM systems 
provide reporting features, they are pretty basic and do not provide much insight about the business as a 
whole. Therefore, it is imperative to gather data from all the source systems that can add value to customer 
experience or improve business process efficiency. 
 While  fetching data from each of these sources, a few points have to be kept in mind.
• 
 Check the means for data integration. Can flat files be extracted from the source 
systems directly and fed into the ETL flows, or should they be fetched from FTP (file 
transfer protocol) servers, in which case FTP servers would have to be set up. 
• 
 While building the ETL flows, the work flows have to contain business rules and logic 
that the business has to define. As rules often change in today’s dynamic business 
scene, the ETL work flows must be agile enough to adapt to these changes quickly.  
• 
 Business logic often resides in ETL work flows, but some business analytics 
visualizations may require that some of the logic be built into reports. In such cases, 
it must be clearly defined which business rules reside in the data warehouse and the 
ETL work flows and which business rules are to be built in the reporting layer. 
• 
 The data in the data warehouse should be granular enough both to facilitate drilling 
and slicing and dicing of data in the reporting layers and also create calculated fields, 
according to need. 
 Other business domains, such as online advertising, classifieds, and other services, are supported by 
several business processes that cater to specific business  areas and processes. 
 The challenge, however, is maintaining an increasing number of reporting and dashboard 
requirements, growing numbers of users, and the increasing amount of data. In order to resolve these 
issue with increasing business data visualization needs, SAP Lumira and SAP Business Intelligence Live 
Office user licenses can be increased, enabling the business users to analyze data themselves, with little IT 
involvement. This is, of course, an uphill task, initially, but with adequate amount of training and knowledge 
sharing, business can manage some of their data analysis needs by themselves. 
 The  challenges faced by an analytics team are constantly changing. They could involve handling a large 
number of reporting requirements, managing the different data access levels required for adequate data 
security, or adding more data source systems to pump data into the enterprise data warehouse. 
 With the advance of SAP Business Analytics offerings and integration feasibilities with newer data 
sources, data analysis using SAP Business Analytics is the right choice for enterprises. 
 Following are some of the usual  reporting needs of a business:
• 
 Operational reporting : Reports pertaining to the operational status of systems 
• 
 Performance reporting : Reports that provide insights regarding performance of 
products, sales, or campaigns 
• 
 Data validation reporting : Reports that provide information regarding data quality 
• 
 Data reconciliation reporting : Reports such as these provide insights into data 
synchronization in the source system and the target systems. Even if there could 
be business rules applied, the data in the data warehouse and the reports and 
dashboards should still match the data in the source systems. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP ANALYTICS PRODUCTS
83
• 
 KPIs : Last but not the least are the KPIs (key performance indicators). KPIs give a 
clear picture of the business drivers at a glance. KPIs at a very high level could be the 
total customer base or the total number of products sold—weekly, monthly, or by 
year-on-year growth, etc. 
 Figure  6-9  displays the flow of data for a business analytics practice at the enterprise level.  
 A  customer-centric approach to doing business starts with gathering as much data as possible 
about customers, from customer registration forms. When a customer approaches the point of sale, and 
salespeople enter the customer details in an ERP system, the data becomes available for analytics by means 
of ETL flows from the ERP database to the data warehouse. The customer data can then be further refined, 
by adding market research data about customer purchase behavior and also data from the customer 
interaction with the contact center or through invoicing and e-mails sent and responded to. 
 Refining a customer database is an ongoing process that will require much time and effort to keep 
updated. Once data from all customer interactions across all channels is stored in a  data warehouse , which 
could be Oracle, SQL Server, or SAP HANA, the same can be visualized using SAP Business Analytics 
products, as described previously, per the business requirements. For example, using SAP Dashboards for 
KPIs, SAP Web Intelligence for static reporting, or SAP Lumira for analysis. 
 Once the data is visualized by business analysts, business controllers, and C-level executives in reports 
and dashboards, insights that can be used to further improve business processes and optimize products 
are generated. The response data from the optimized systems is again fed back into the data warehouse, to 
analyze the results of optimization. 
 Figure  6-10  shows the different kinds of data generated at different stages of business processes in an 
organization. The data generated at each stage should be stored for further analysis, to gain insights. The 
SAP Business Analytics suite of products can help analyze the data at each stage of the business processes.

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP ANALYTICS PRODUCTS
84
 Using  SAP Lumira , SAP Web Intelligence, or SAP Dashboards to visualize data from the customer 
base, or the data in the data warehouse that contains data from many business source systems, provides an 
understanding of key business drivers. 
 The way data is centered or structured in an organization depends on the kind of business. If it is a 
product company that sells products or services, it is as essential to track the entire life cycle of products as it 
is to track information regarding customers. As shown in Figure  6-11 , data regarding a product development 
life cycle is stored. As well, data about a customer’s interaction with a product, spread across several 
channels, is also stored.

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP ANALYTICS PRODUCTS
85
 The insights that are gained after the business analysts, business controllers, and product analysts have 
analyzed the data are used to enhance product features and further improve customer experience with the 
products. 
 Analytics is defining the way organizations conduct business, the way marketing and sales teams 
market products and services, the way products are developed, and the way organizations perform 
competitive analysis. Data from every single business process should be gathered and stored, to conduct 
trend analysis and performance reporting, not only to better understand the business processes, but also to 
tweak them to increase customer satisfaction. 
 Data from all touch points that the customer uses to interact with businesses should also be gathered, to 
understand customer behavior and to be proactive, rather than reactive, in pleasing the customer. 
 Figure  6-12  sums up the business analytics implementation goals, purpose, and methodology at a very 
high level. 
 Business analytics is concerned with gathering and analyzing data at every stage of business processes, 
to measure and optimize products, processes, and services. SAP Business Analytics products can help 
organizations bridge the gap between business and IT, by helping organizations visualize their data, thus 
improving understanding of their
• 
 Customer base 
• 
  Product offerings and reception 
• 
 Marketing efforts 
• 
 UX design 
• 
 Web behavior 
• 
 App behavior 
• 
 Sales figures 
• 
 Inventory, etc.

 SAP Analytics Product 
Implementation 
 In this chapter, you will learn some practical technical implementations of SAP Business Analytics and some 
industry standards related to business analytics projects. 
 Overview of SAP Analytics Product  Capabilities for Some 
Mainstream Industries 
 As I have discussed, all businesses are supported by a number of IT systems and products that automatize 
the business process, reducing manual intervention. When most of the processes are automatized, business- 
and IT people are able to use their time more efficiently, for innovative purposes within their scope of 
business activity. 
 As in Figure  7-1 , the need for business analytics arises from the fact that businesses have to understand 
their own organizational processes better, to better serve their end customers.  
 For organizations, this results in a continuous process to analyze, understand, conduct tests, and 
evaluate results, in order to facilitate
•

  CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP ANALYTICS PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION
88
• 
 Brand awareness 
• 
 Revenue generation 
• 
 Customer experience 
• 
 Customer loyalty 
 The most common  business areas that require IT support are
• 
 Customer Relationship Management (CRM) 
• 
 Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) 
• 
 Product Life Cycle Management (PLM) 
• 
 Supply Chain Management (SCM) 
• 
 Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) 
 With a lot of focus placed on attracting more traffic to web sites and mobile apps, there is a great deal of 
emphasis on web and mobile analytics recently. Data from all the aforementioned business areas has to be 
integrated into a common platform, to provide a holistic view of a business. 
 SAP provides industry-specific solutions, such as the following:
• 
 SAP for Retail (ISR) 
• 
 SAP for Utilities (ISU) 
• 
 SAP for Public Sector (IS PSCD) 
• 
 SAP for Oil & Gas (IS Oil & Gas) 
• 
 SAP for Telecommunications (IST) 
• 
 SAP for Healthcare (ISH) 
• 
 SAP for Banking (SAP for Banking) 
• 
 SAP for Insurance (SAP for Insurance) 
• 
 SAP Financial Services Network (FSN) 
• 
 SAP Shipping Services Network (SSN) 
• 
 Engineering Construction & Operations (EC&O) 
 Some solutions do come with reporting features, but in order to use advance analytics and data 
mining, SAP Business Analytics products have to be used to gain in-depth insights about business data. As 
in Figure  7-2 , business data resides in IT systems that  support   businesses, namely, ERP, CRM, etc., which 
are then blended using data integration, which fetches data from each of the systems and saves it in a data 
warehouse. The data warehouse then feeds the reports, dashboards, ad hoc analysis, and data mining.  

  CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP ANALYTICS PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION
89
 SAP provides a number of solutions in the SAP Business Analytics suite of products, such as
• 
 SAP BusinessObjects Analysis 
• 
 SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence 
• 
 SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards 
• 
 SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio 
• 
 SAP BusinessObjects Explorer 
• 
 SAP Cloud for Analytics 
• 
 SAP Crystal Reports 
• 
 SAP Crystal Server 
• 
 SAP Lumira 
• 
 SAP Predictive Analytics 
 As shown in Figure  7-3 , SAP has a wide range of advanced analytics offerings. SAP HANA, which is 
SAP’s in-memory database for advanced data processing and flexible data integration services, is a database 
for real-time analytics, with faster data retrieval abilities. Using SAP HANA as the underlying layer for data 
 storage  and retrieval gives big enterprise companies a competitive edge as far as real-time analytics is 
concerned. SAP Data Services enables the data transfer between different solutions and platforms. SAP 
Business Analytics has a whole suite of products that help business users with different needs gain access to 
the information required in a very simple and efficient manner. SAP Business Analytics also supports many 
partner business intelligence (BI) tools and applications.  
 Figure 7-2.  Fundamental principles of business analytics, irrespective of the industry 
 

  CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP ANALYTICS PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION

 Data sources can be very different, depending on the industry in question, and can include real-
time data, unstructured data from social media, IoT (Internet of things) data from sensors and wearables, 
or transactional data from business systems. Some of the source systems could be SAP-based products, 
allowing easier  integration to SAP HANA or SAP Sybase.  Non-SAP products can be integrated with SAP 
HANA, using SAP Data Services as the ETL (extraction, transformation, and loading) tool. Data can be 
analyzed further in SAP Lumira or used for data mining, by using SAP Predictive Analytics.  
 Examples of Some SAP Analytics Implementations 
 Having worked extensively with BI implementations, I have come across a number of successful BI programs 
and projects. The single most important criteria that determines the success of a BI project is getting the 
business requirements right by asking the right questions. It is also important to have a business sponsor 
as part of the  business analytics project , to drive the business case. Typically, a business analytics project 
consists of the following team members:
• 
 A business sponsor, to create a business case for investment and follow up on the 
business value being generated in a project 
• 
 A technical architect, who is well versed not only with industry knowledge but also 
able to translate business requirements into technical solution architecture  
 Figure 7-3.  SAP advanced analytics offerings 
 

  CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP ANALYTICS PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION
91
• 
 Business analysts, to analyze the business requirements and business processes that 
influence the technical design and architecture 
• 
 Business analytics developers, who implement the technical architecture by 
developing data flows from source systems to a common data warehouse and 
develop reports and dashboards 
• 
 Data analysts, who conduct sanity checks to identify data-quality issues. A data 
analyst might also check that the technical implementation of business rules lead to 
correct results. 
 Figure  7-4  illustrates  customer journey mapping , which is a necessary step to identify all the processes 
that a customer has to undertake to avail himself/herself of the products or services a company offers. A 
similar mapping journey can be done to understand the product life cycle and points that are in need of 
reassessment, optimization, and new implementations.  
 The fine lines between different IT systems is getting blurred as data becomes paramount. To gain 
insights, data from several systems must be merged, providing a holistic view. 
 A  business analytics project should have certain encapsulated features, to qualify as a well-
implemented project. As listed in Figure  7-5 , the key steps in a business analytics implementation project 
have to be defined at the inception of a project. 
 Figure 7-4.  Customer journey mapping 
 

  CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP ANALYTICS PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION
92
 The key steps are
 
 1. 
 Mapping a customer or product journey over the entire life cycle  
 
 2. 
 Once the life cycle is plotted, it is easier to identify the business processes that are 
involved at each step of the journey. 
 
 3. 
 Once the business processes are identified, it is not very difficult to understand 
the IT systems that support each business process and the integrations that are in 
place. 
 
 4. 
 Next comes the need to state the to-be data strategy, depending on the business 
goals of the organization. 
 
 5. 
 Once the future goals are defined, it is necessary to take stock of the current data 
structures and systems, to understand the parts that can continue to function 
and the ones that have to be renewed. 
 
 6. 
 A gap analysis has to be done, to understand the new requirements for the 
business processes and the IT systems. 
 
 7. 
 A solution design and IT architecture has to be designed, to deliver the future 
data strategy. 
 
 8. 
 The next step is to identify the skillsets required to deliver such a solution, both 
functionally and technically. 
 
 9. 
 Once the implementation life cycle begins, it is vital to build and test in small 
iterations, to analyze the cause and effect of new implementations. 
 Figure 7-5.  A  typical business analytics roadmap 
 

  CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP ANALYTICS PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION
93
 While it is important to bear in mind the steps that lead to a successful implementation of a business 
analytics project or program, it is also important to understand what the key features that define a successful 
business analytics implementation program are. Some of the key features that a robust  business analytics 
project embodies are as follows:
• 
 Fulfills the business requirements and can adapt easily to newer business needs 
• 
 Adds value in the form of process optimization or cost reduction or generates value 
for the end customer 
• 
 Has a short time to market, reducing the implementation time and yielding value 
very quickly in the process 
• 
 Is flexible enough so that it is easy to refactor or integrate new sources of data  
• 
 Carries low maintenance costs. A solution that requires very detailed supervision 
and is not fault tolerant is not an optimum solution. 
 Owing to  the Internet , the amount of data produced by businesses has been growing constantly. Every 
industry wants to monetize data, to initiate data-driven decisions that expedite revenue generation, enhance 
customer experience, and drive innovation. Analyzing customer data generates information about customer 
preferences and behavior, which, in turn, leads to new market opportunities for some businesses. Many 
organizations have merged or acquired companies that provide services ancillary to their own, in order to 
serve their customers better by providing a complete package of services. 
 Figure  7-6 illustrates the different phases of an analytics project. In order to implement a business analytics 
project, the first step is to ensure that the business analytics program office decides the purpose(s) and goals of 
implementing a business analytics project and obtains a fair understanding of the high-level requirements. In 
the  planning phase , the analytics program office has to gather both the high- and low-level requirements—the 
milestones of the project—and define and put in place the technical team. In the design phase, the technical 
team designs the architecture, the data flow from end to end, and the reporting and dashboarding layouts. 
The actual implementation of the design takes place in the  build phase  , in which the ETL and the reports are 
developed, systems are tested, including by the end user during user acceptance testing. If the end users are 
satisfied with the outcomes, the analytics solution is implemented in production, and thereafter handed over to 
a maintenance team for routine maintenance, upgrading, fixes, and enhancements to the solution.  
 Figure 7-6.  The  different phases in a business analytics project 
 

  CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP ANALYTICS PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION
94
 The implementation cycle, however, is not free of hassles. Requirements change midway, which may 
result in efforts getting wasted or a delay in deadlines, due to new requirements that necessitate new design 
and build efforts. Thus, it is important to maintain some project artifacts, as an issue log and change log, 
to document the issues that come up during any phase of the project and the solution implemented. The 
change log documents all the changes that have occurred during the implementation cycle of a project that 
have resulted in deviations. These artifacts are separate from budget and resource-planning documents. 
 As mentioned, the different phases of an analytics project are shown in Figure  7-6 . In the first phase 
of the project, high-level goals must be determined. In other words, an organization has to be clear 
about its goals in regard to implementing an analytics project and about what the expectations are from 
the implementation. Analytics projects are put into practice to transform quantitative capabilities into 
purposeful and impactful decision making. In order to quantify business goals, KPIs (key performance 
indicators) that effectively measure business goals have to be determined. 
 Railway Company Example 
 One practical example of business analytics are railway companies, which place a lot of emphasis on 
punctuality, onboard experience, and customer service. Let’s consider a hypothetical railway company 
called ABC that has a huge fleet of trains operating between different destinations, sells journeys directly 
to customers (online and via franchisee units), and also serves food and beverages onboard. So, ABC has a 
lot of different services to cater to, potentially making the IT architecture quite complex. There are different 
kinds of insights that can be generated from the business, depending on the need. 
 Some of the main KPIs in such a railway company could be
• 
 Punctuality of the trains 
• 
 Canceled train services 
• 
 Number of trains in transit in real time 
• 
 Sales revenue from ticket sales 
• 
 Sales revenue from ticket sales online 
• 
 Sales revenue from ticket sales via franchisees 
• 
 Sales revenue from onboard sales 
• 
 Peak season sales 
• 
 Social media metrics, such as Facebook likes, comments, shares, and tweets 
• 
 Trend analysis, to check the trends of sales 
 In order to hone in on the preceding KPIs, a number of systems are involved, e.g., ticket booking 
systems, systems that maintain train timetables, systems that maintain actual information about trains 
running at the moment, financial accounting systems, and social media management systems, apart from 
the data warehouse that maintains historic data about the journeys, passengers, and sales figures. 
 Because the amount of data is quite huge, the data retrieval time could be substantial, so to avoid that, 
SAP HANA will be used as the in-memory column-based database. SAP HANA provides the infrastructure 
and tools for building high-performance applications, based on the SAP HANA engine, which is data-source 
agonistic. SAP Data Services is being used as the ETL tool for extraction, transformation, and loading of data 
from different source systems into SAP BW Enterprise Data Warehouse, which enables the data to be pre-
computed, making data retrieval faster in SAP BusinessObjects Web Intelligence and SAP Analysis for Office. 
As far as dashboards used to display the train punctuality KPIs are concerned—trains in transit, number of 
trains undergoing maintenance work, etc.—SAP Design Studio will be used. SAP Design Studio provides 
full and native support of BW BEx queries, direct connectivity to HANA, as well as an advanced scripting

engine, and is suited to mobile devices. Data distribution is also fairly simple and can be managed from SAP 
BI launch pad, which makes the experience seamless for the users of different business analytics platforms. 
SAP Lumira is used as a self-service BI application by business users, to conduct data analysis. All this is 
shown in Figure  7-7 . 
 Self-service BI by  means of SAP Lumira requires some initial technical training on the part of end users 
in the finance team. But once the non-IT business controllers get numbers crunching, using a business 
analytics product, the IT team will be left to implement new business requirements.  
 Media Company Example 
 Another real-life example of SAP Business Analytics implementation is a media company that has state-of-
the-art infrastructure to analyze web traffic data, behavioral analytics, sales and marketing, CRM campaigns, 
and online advertising. 
 Media outlets are no longer traditional print media distribution companies. With advanced technology, 
media companies have to be on their toes, producing content that not only attracts subscribers but also 
creates online platforms on which big brands are able to advertise their products and services. The main 
KPIs that drive the different business areas of a media company are broadly stated as follows:
 Figure 7-7.  SAP Business Analytics implementation example 
 

  CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP ANALYTICS PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION

• 
 Number of visitors to the site 
• 
 Number of downloads of the app 
• 
 Number of visitors per channel (mobile, web) 
• 
 Number of online advertisements booked 
• 
 Number of online advertisements per industry segment 
• 
 Number campaigns sent out 
• 
 Number of campaigns that lead to consumers taking action  
• 
 Number of campaigns that lead to consumers deregistering the e-mails or SMS 
• 
 Number of subscriptions sold 
• 
 Most read articles 
• 
 Most followed authors 
• 
 Highest revenue-generating customers 
 The preceding lists only a few of the KPIs that media companies calculate, but there are a number of 
trend analyses that media outlets have to perform to gain insights about their customer base and the needs 
of potential customers. By analyzing the traffic on web sites, content can be adjusted to attract even more 
traffic, in real time. Media companies also segment and classify their customer base, to better provide quality 
content that is aptly targeted to their audience. A few of the IT systems and products that support media 
companies and their related businesses are
• 
 CMS (content management systems), which handle the content on web sites for 
publishing from a central interface 
• 
 Web analytics tools, to analyze the traffic on sites  
• 
 CRM systems, to manage customer interactions  
• 
 Campaign management systems, to handle campaigns sent to customers as e-mails, 
weekly newsletters, or push notifications on the site or in the mobile app 
• 
 Financial accounting systems, to keep track of finances and bookkeeping 
• 
 Order booking systems, to manage sales orders booked by the sales team 
• 
 Ad servers, which handle displaying of ads on the web sites and the mobile apps 
• 
 Integration platforms, which integrate data from different sources 
• 
 Invoicing systems 
• 
 Data warehouses, which store historic data regarding customer information, 
financial information, invoicing history, ad server details, and distribution details 
 Data from each of these systems is fetched using SAP Data Services as the ETL tool and placed into a 
database, which is an Oracle database but could also be SAP HANA, owing to HANA’s fast performance of 
queries and analytics on very large amounts of data. The first layer of integration is a one-to-one mapping 
from the source systems, but in the subsequent layers, the data is cleansed and modified using business 
rules and then stored in the data warehouse, which handles version controlling of historical data and feeds 
the several reports and dashboards. Version controlling of data means handling the changes in customer or 
product history that are relevant from a business perspective. 

  CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP ANALYTICS PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION

 Once data from source systems is analyzed and insights are gained, the processes are optimized, using 
the feedback. Once the processes are optimized, the new response data can be used for further analysis 
and to gain even newer insights, creating a feedback loop. This kind of experimentation leads to continuous 
improvement of business processes and effectiveness. 
 Once the source data is stored in the data warehouse, the data can be displayed in static reports, using 
SAP Business Objects Web Intelligence or SAP Dashboards. Data can be used for early stage data discovery, 
using SAP Lumira. SAP Predictive Analytics can be used for advanced data exploration. SAP BI launch pad is 
the  central interface used for access rights and administration of users and groups for different SAP Business 
Analytics tools. Depending on the comfort level of users, SAP Business Analytics can be tailored to suit the 
specific business needs. 
 The rules of thumb for any business analytics project are basically the same. As business systems now 
also include data from social media platforms, data from apps, and ratings that customers give to products 
and services, they hold a lot of additional information about customers. Consumer information is no longer 
exclusively about data from structured transactional systems that has to be stored and analyzed in order 
to gain a holistic view of customers and the main business drivers. Now, every data source that leads to an 
insight about a business should be included in an analytics project. 
 The business analytics team members have an important role to play in the implementation life cycle, 
and not just technically. Analytics team members have to understand the entire business process, the factors 
that lead to revenue generation, the marketing campaign targets, the targeted audience, and the potential 
customer base, as well as customer behavior. Some companies also do competitive analysis and analyze 
market research data to better understand the market before even  trying   to increase their market share.   
 Upcoming Trends in Business Analytics 
 With the ever-increasing amount of data and with data being used to drive businesses, data and the insights 
it provides will become even more important in the near future. Companies are getting more tech-oriented, 
in order to reach out and retain customers, using innovative means. The focus is shifting from products 
that companies sell to the customers that are or will be users of these products. Companies will have to 
proactively find means of attracting customers to ensure their loyalty. Because customers today are very 
demanding, it becomes even more important to use data to find the right audience to market products 
and services to. Once customers are acquired, it is important to analyze every aspect of their consumer 
experience, to be able to serve them better and personalize targeted campaigns more efficiently. 
 Some key trends in the business analytics field that seem to be emerging and will likely continue for a 
while are
• 
 Data visualization : This becomes paramount for displaying in a simple manner for 
business users key performance indicators that drive businesses. Data is being used 
to narrate stories about customers and products in brand-building efforts. Data 
visualization makes it easier for both technical and nontechnical users to understand 
data. 
• 
 Mobile business analytics : As the number of devices grows, business analytics 
on mobile is becoming more and more advanced. Mobile business analytics is 
branching out as a platform of its own, rather than as a rudimentary feature of 
business analytics. Mobile solutions are being developed in a way that makes 
consumers’ experience seamless when switching between devices. 
• 
 IoT : In a connected world of smart homes and wearables, business analytics makes 
sense of all the data from multiple sources used to derive insights into process 
optimization and product development. 

  CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP ANALYTICS PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION
98
• 
 Social media management : The way we converse and socialize has changed a lot 
in the past few years. From finding friends to checking reviews about products 
to booking tickets and finding jobs, most day-to-day activities have an online 
touchpoint at some junction. Business analytics will have to develop APIs and 
integration methods to connect to the social media platforms, to analyze the huge 
amount of unstructured data being generated.  
• 
 Cloud analytics : As the amount of data generated increases, so does the complexity 
of storing it. But with the advent of cloud computing, scalability has become easier, 
along with infrastructure maintenance. Business analytics solutions are introducing 
a number of connectors to different types of data sources, cloud sources being one of 
the most important. 
• 
 Data integration : The importance of data blending has been rising as a 360-degree 
view of customer or business life cycles has become paramount. But in order to 
blend data from different sources, data integration is required, which, in turn, 
requires that a business analytics tool provide data connectors to many sources. 
Data integration has to be a simpler process than it is today, to promote the 
democratization of data from disparate sources and make it available to a wider 
audience, without hassles. 
• 
 Self-service BI : As data is the buzzword that has engulfed every single business 
area, business users depend a lot more on data for decision making. It is thus 
imperative to empower business users, who may not be very tech-savvy. So, easy-
to-use business analytics tools are the demand of the day. More and more business 
analytics tools are providing self-service business analytics, so that business users do 
not have to depend on IT intervention for minor requirements. 
 As the analytics field gets more and more advanced, the line between marketing, web analytics, CRM, 
IoT, wearables, gaming, etc., becomes blurred. Omni channel data from every touchpoint contributes to 
insights about customer behavior. Business analytics is the art of combining data from disparate sources and 
making this information available in a way that is simple, easy, and fast, while generating value for business 
drivers. 
 Figure  7-8  shows the way the business analytics products, platforms, and functionalities are evolving. 
There is a lot of thrust on predictive analytics, more  pixel-perfect visualizations  , and traditional BI. The 
thrust, however is more on speed of delivery, in real time. Hence, it becomes very important to choose the 
right hardware, as well as software platforms, to deliver a complete package of solutions to business needs. 
Big data is defined by the three V’s: 
• 
 Variety 
• 
 Velocity 
• 
 Volume 
 The right business analytics should be able to deliver, taking into account the aforementioned three 
 factors of variety, velocity, and volume.

 With the popularity of  columnar databases rising, insights can be gained almost in real time. This in 
itself is a huge leap for the business analytics field. Data can be visualized in real time to analyze the pros 
and cons and causes and effects of different variations in data. This can lead to huge business gains. 
 There are ample reasons for organizations to implement business analytics at the enterprise level. It is a 
matter of choosing the right implementation technique, processes, team, and tools.
