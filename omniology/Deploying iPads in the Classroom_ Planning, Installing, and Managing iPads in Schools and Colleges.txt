Introduction
Apple’s iPad is the most successful tablet computer ever. Almost as easy to use as it is to 
damage (you’ll want to protect your iPads with cases), the iPad is great for computing 
anywhere and everywhere. iPads are also terrific in schools, enabling you to put in each 
student’s hands an easily-manageable but powerful tablet on which the student can do 
everything from learning Internet use to developing essential office software skills, from 
recording live audio to creating backing tracks and producing CD-quality music, and 
from taking photos and shooting video clips to creating high-quality movies.
Who Is This Book For?
This book is for anybody who’s looking to deploy iPads in a classroom or lab situation. 
Most likely you’re a teacher or educator in a school or college, and that’s the scenario this 
book and its examples aim at. But even if your situation and aims for deploying multiple 
iPads are different, you’ll find useful information in this book. For example, you might 
run a community computing club providing Internet access, or you might offer private 
computing lessons to small groups.
What Does This Book Cover?
This book contains nine chapters that take you from planning a classroom deployment of 
iPads to managing the classroom and troubleshooting the iPads when things go wrong.
Chapter 1, “Planning Your Classroom Deployment of iPads,” discusses how to plan 
your deployment of iPads in the classroom. The chapter starts with a quick reality check 
about your school’s plans to add computers to the classroom and then move along to 
practical matters. After that, the chapter makes sure you know the capabilities of iPads 
and how they compare—both favorably and unfavorably—to laptops and desktops. 
The chapter also goes through what you’ll need to do to plan the deployment, starting 
with choosing a deployment model; moving along through choosing which iPads to get, 
deciding whether to supervise them, and choosing how to manage them; and finally 
making sure that your school’s network and Internet connection have enough bandwidth 
to handle the additional traffic that the iPads will generate.
Chapter 2, “Choosing iPads and Accessories,” explains how to choose the right iPads 
for your school’s needs and how to select suitable accessories—chargers, cases, screen 
protectors, mounts, stands, and so on—to enable yourself, your students, and your 
colleagues to make the most of the iPads.

■ Introduction

Chapter 3, “Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers,” teaches you 
essential skills for using an iPad as an administrator or as a teacher. The chapters with 
the basics: you learn how to set up an iPad, how to perform basic power operations, how 
to navigate the interface, how to connect to Wi-Fi networks and so on. Once you know 
those moves, the chapter covers how to configure an iPad’s essential settings manually: 
Notifications, Do Not Disturb, Restrictions, and Accessibility. Toward the end of the 
chapter, you learn about connecting keyboards to the iPad; updating the operating 
system; installing, removing, and organizing apps; and managing both local storage and 
iCloud storage.
Chapter 4, “Managing iPads with Apple Configurator,” walks you through using the 
Apple Configurator app to configure iPads automatically. The chapter starts with a quick 
overview of what you can do with Apple Configurator. You then download the app and 
install it on your Mac, configure the app itself, and then work through the actions it offers: 
connecting and updating iPads, organizing and sorting them, and backing them up and 
restoring them; preparing the iPads for deployment; building configuration profiles and 
applying them to iPads; and creating templates called blueprints and applying them to 
iPads.
Chapter 5, “Managing iPads with Apple School Manager,” teaches you about Apple 
School Manager, Apple’s turnkey service for managing Macs and iOS devices in schools 
and similar institutions. The chapter explains what you need to know about Apple School 
Manager to use it effectively, starting with the fact that you may not need to use Apple 
School Manager directly at all if your school uses an MDM solution that integrates with 
Apple School Manager.
Chapter 6, “Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management,” tells you how to 
manage your school’s iPads with Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions. MDM 
enables you to automate many aspects of deploying, configuring, and controlling iPads, 
so if your school has any serious deployment of iPads, you’ll likely use MDM to manage 
them.
Chapter 7, “Accessing Files and Printing Documents,” explains how to connect your 
school’s iPads to local storage and online storage for accessing existing files and creating 
new files. You also learn how to print from iPads to your school’s printers.
Chapter 8, “Controlling a Lesson with Classroom for iPad,” shows you how to use 
Apple’s Classroom app to manage your students’ iPads directly from your own iPad. 
Classroom is a great tool for running iPad-based lessons, giving you the power to do 
everything from launching the app the students will use for the class to monitoring what 
each student is viewing—or doing—on screen at any moment.
Chapter 9, “Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom,” takes you through 
troubleshooting the problems you’re most likely to experience with iPads in the 
classroom. The chapter starts by looking at how to locate a missing iPad—and how to 
erase it remotely if necessary. It then moves on to resetting an iPad in different ways,

CHAPTER 1
Planning Your Classroom 
Deployment of iPads
This chapter discusses how to plan your deployment of iPads in the classroom. We’ll start 
with a quick reality check about your school’s plans to add computers to the classroom 
and then move along to practical matters. You’ll get to know the capabilities of iPads and 
how they compare—both favorably and unfavorably—to laptops and desktops. We’ll 
then go through what you’ll need to do to plan the deployment, starting with choosing a 
deployment model, moving along through choosing which iPads to get, deciding whether 
to supervise them, and choosing how to manage them. Finally, we’ll discuss making sure 
that your school’s network and Internet connection have enough bandwidth to handle 
the additional traffic the iPads will generate.
Making the Decision to Computerize Classrooms 
or Classes
To deploy iPads or other computers successfully in your school, you should have the 
agreement and cooperation of your colleagues, your students, and perhaps also the 
students’ parents. Although it’s certainly possible to make in isolation the decision to 
computerize and then impose the decision, you’ll typically get much better results if you 
get each group involved in making the decision and supporting its implementation.
Given that you’re reading this book, you’ve perhaps already gotten past this stage 
in the planning process. If so, skip ahead to the next section, “Understanding iPad 
Capabilities.” If not, you’ll probably want to take the following steps, not necessarily in 
exactly this order:
• 
Research the costs and benefits of computerizing one or more 
classrooms or classes
• 
Convince your colleagues of the merits of adding the computers
• 
Get input from students
• 
Build a budget for a pilot scheme and get it approved

Chapter 1 ■ Planning Your Classroom Deployment of iPads

• 
Select a classroom or a class for a pilot scheme
• 
Run the pilot scheme
• 
Review the success or challenges of the pilot scheme and the 
feedback you get from it
• 
Scale up your pilot scheme for full deployment
• 
Budget for the full deployment
• 
Execute the full deployment
• 
Build in a review cycle to gauge successes, failures, and 
improvements needed
DEVELOPING FAQS AND ACCEPTABLE USE POLICIES
As you plan and build out your deployment, you should develop a FAQ—a list of 
frequently asked questions—that you can make available on your school’s website 
as an information resource for students, parents, teachers, and support staff.
The FAQ needs to cover everything from the school’s purpose in deploying the iPads 
through straightforward issues such as startup, login, and basic skills like running 
apps and accessing resources. You should also cover more advanced topics such 
as understanding the restrictions the school has applied to the iPad and the ways 
in which the school can monitor iPad usage. Make sure to publicize the FAQ in 
the school and provide an easy-to-use mechanism for users to submit questions 
for adding to the FAQ. Add a shortcut to the FAQ on each iPad’s Home screen to 
encourage students and teachers to use the FAQ.
You will also need to create two acceptable use policies. The first policy should 
explain the rules under which students use the iPads—what they’re allowed to do, 
what isn’t permitted, and who is responsible for lost or broken iPads. The second 
policy should do likewise for teachers. Students and teachers should sign the 
acceptable use policies to confirm that they accept the rules. For younger students 
and for one-to-one deployments (in which the students typically take the iPads 
home), the students’ parents should also sign the policies.
Understanding iPad Capabilities
As you know, the iPad is a series of tablet computers made by Apple. Since Apple 
launched the first iPad in 2010, it has released various models with faster processors, 
more storage, and higher-resolution screens.

Chapter 1 ■ Planning Your Classroom Deployment of iPads

Apple has also constantly updated iOS, the operating system used by the iPad, 
iPhone, and iPod touch, issuing a major update each year. Version 11 of iOS was released 
in September 2017.
■
■Note   The first three versions of what became iOS were called iPhone OS—iPhone OS 1, 
iPhone OS 2, and iPhone OS 3. At version 4, in June 2010, Apple changed the name to iOS. 
At version 4.2.1, in November 2010, Apple added iPad support to iOS.
iPad Models and Screen Sizes
As of this writing (Fall 2017), the iPad comes in three different models, which have four 
different screen sizes among them:
• 
iPad mini: As its name suggests, this is the smallest iPad. It has a 
7.9-inch screen.
• 
iPad: The iPad takes over from the iPad Air as the midpoint in the 
iPad range. It has a 9.7-inch screen.
• 
iPad Pro: The iPad Pro is a more powerful iPad. It comes in two 
sizes, one with a 10.5-inch screen and the other with a 12.9-inch 
screen.
■
■Note   See Chapter 2 for more specifics on the iPad models.
iPad Apps
The iPad runs apps built for Apple’s iOS operating system. The primary source of apps is 
Apple’s App Store, which you can access either directly through the App Store app that 
comes with iOS or indirectly via either the Apple Configurator deployment tool that Apple 
provides or a third-party mobile device management (MDM) tool. It’s also possible to 
install third-party apps, such as apps that your school has developed.
The iPad as a Consumer Device
At the consumer level, the iPad can work as a standalone device, but you can also sync 
data either directly from a Mac or PC or through an account on Apple’s iCloud service. 
For example, iCloud enables you to sync contact and calendar data, notes and reminders, 
e-mail accounts and photos, and other items. You can also back up some of an iPad’s 
contents to your iCloud account.

Chapter 1 ■ Planning Your Classroom Deployment of iPads
4
The iPad as an Education or Enterprise Device
For education, business, and other organizational uses, the iPad works as a managed 
client. By using the free Apple Configurator app or a third-party tool, you can configure an 
image file containing the operating system set up the way you want it and then apply the 
image file to your school’s iPads. You can also create policies to automatically configure 
the iPads. For example, you can create Wi-Fi payloads to enable the iPads to connect to 
the appropriate Wi-Fi networks at your school, and you can apply restriction payloads 
to impose restrictions on the iPads (such as preventing installation or deletion of apps, 
forbidding the use of specific apps, and so on).
Comparing iPads to Laptops or Desktops
This section looks at how iPads compare to laptops and desktops, given that these are 
typically the most likely alternative technologies for classroom deployment.
COMPARING IPADS TO OTHER TABLETS
You may also need to compare iPads to Windows tablets and Android tablets. Many 
different models of Windows tablets and Android tablets are available, offering a 
wide range of sizes and form factors.
Both Windows tablets and Android tablets offer similar benefits of portability and 
ease of use as iPads—and are equally easy to remove if not secured. Android tablets 
also provide instant on and quick login, whereas Windows tablets turn on quickly 
but typically take somewhat longer to log in because Windows is a larger operating 
system.
Both Windows tablets and Android tablets have apps available for most needs—as 
of this writing, the Play Store, Google’s main source of apps for Android tablets, 
carries more than 3 million apps. Windows tablets have the advantage here, as they 
can typically run any of the full-featured Windows apps that laptops and desktops 
can run, though less powerful tablets may struggle to run complex apps at an 
acceptable speed.
Both Windows tablets and Android tablets enable you to set up multiple user 
accounts on a device, just as you can on desktop and laptop computers. Each user 
has their own storage space and custom settings, and the operating systems allow 
for quick switching among users.
Some Windows tablets and Android tablets are available in ruggedized designs 
suitable for use in schools—or outdoors—without a case. For non-ruggedized 
devices, you will normally want to use cases.
Prices of Windows tablets and Android tablets vary considerably, but in general, you 
can get similar functionality for a lower cost than with an iPad.

Advantages of iPads Compared to Laptops and Desktops
The iPad has several advantages compared to laptops and desktops for use in schools:
• 
Portability: The iPad is designed for handheld use, so students 
and teachers can easily use iPads while at desks or tables and 
while moving around the classroom. The iPad’s portability can 
encourage or facilitate students working in groups.
• 
Ease of use: The iPad’s operating system, iOS, is designed for ease 
of use, and you quickly can bring students (and teachers) up to 
speed with its essentials. Given the popularity of the iPhone, it’s 
likely that some (perhaps most) of your students will possess or at 
least have used iPhones; these students will already know how to 
navigate and use iOS on the iPad.
• 
Apps available for most needs: Apple’s App Store offers more than 
2.2 million apps, a range that covers most known computing 
needs and many others besides. Unless your school and your 
students have extremely specialized needs, your challenge 
probably won’t be finding apps with the capabilities you need; it 
will be finding the best apps with those capabilities.
• 
Instant on and quick login: The iPad wakes up from sleep at the 
press of a button, and the login process is much quicker than 
most laptops and desktops, enabling students to get to work in a 
short time.
• 
Ease of configuration and administration: As you’ll see later in 
this book, Apple and third-party manufacturers provide tools for 
configuring iPads automatically and for running classes on iPads. 
For example, you can apply profiles to iPads to configure specific 
settings and prevent users from customizing certain categories of 
settings while still allowing users to customize other settings.
■
■Note  Similar configuration and administration tools are available for laptops and 
desktops, so although this capability makes it easier for you to deploy iPads in the 
classroom, it doesn’t score significantly over the competition.
• 
Volume Purchase Program for apps and e-books: Apple’s Volume 
Purchase Program simplifies the process of distributing apps and 
e-books to your school’s iPads. You can also reclaim the apps and 
e-books afterward if necessary—for example, when a student 
leaves the school.

Chapter 1 ■ Planning Your Classroom Deployment of iPads

Disadvantages of iPads Compared to Laptops and  
Desktops
If you’re considering iPads as an alternative to laptops or desktops in the classroom, you’ll 
also need to evaluate the disadvantages of iPads compared to laptops or desktops. These 
are the main disadvantages:
• 
Single-user device: Unlike PCs, Macs, and even Android tablets, 
the iPad is a single-user device, not a multiuser device. You can’t 
configure an iPad with multiple user accounts and switch among 
them. This makes it harder to have iPads as shared devices in  
the same way you can share Macs, PCs, and Android tablets  
(but see the nearby Note on Shared iPad). If you’re planning for each 
student to have an iPad as a personal device, this isn’t a problem.
■
■Note  To help work around the limitation of the iPad being a single-user device, Apple 
introduced a feature called Shared iPad in January 2016. Shared iPad quickly sets up an 
iPad for a user by copying that user’s environment and data files from the network when the 
user logs in to the iPad. See Chapter 5 for more information on Shared iPad.
• 
Easy to damage: Apple has designed the iPad as a slim and 
lightweight device that’s dominated by its screen—it’s hardly 
the heavily armored, industrial-style device you might prefer in 
the classroom or out in the wild. (For example, HP’s ProBook 
x360 Education Edition laptop, which is designed to survive 
student use, is built ruggedly enough to meet the MIL-STD-810G 
military standard.) As a result, the iPad is all too easy to damage, 
accidentally or otherwise, and you will normally need to protect 
your school’s iPads with protective cases. Chapter 2 reviews some 
of your options for protecting iPads.
• 
Easy to remove: Being portable and small enough to slip into a 
school bag, iPads are easy to remove from the classroom. You 
may need to tether your school’s iPads using cases that lock onto 
the iPad or secure the iPads with stands. Laptops are similarly 
portable and removable, but many models include a built-in 
Kensington slot that enables you to lock them easily using a 
standard cable. Desktops tend to be far less portable and are 
generally easy to secure.
■
■Note  Chapter 2 discusses some of the hardware you can use to secure iPads.

Chapter 1 ■ Planning Your Classroom Deployment of iPads
7
• 
Cost: Even the least expensive iPad model typically costs more 
than alternative devices, such as Android tablets, Chromebooks, 
or laptop or desktop PCs. Any case or other accessories you add to 
the iPad brings the cost up further.
• 
No hardware keyboard: The iPad doesn’t include a hardware 
keyboard, although you can add one easily enough via the Smart 
Connector built into the iPad Pro models or via Bluetooth. The 
iPad’s on-screen keyboard could hardly be easier to use, but it’s 
adequate only for lightweight text input; few people can touch-
type satisfactorily on it. So if your students will need to enter large 
amounts of text on the iPads—whether for taking notes or for 
original writing—you’ll almost certainly need to add keyboards. 
This means extra expense and effort.
• 
Some key apps and power-user apps are not available: Even 
though the App Store offers a vast range of apps, some of the most 
important apps are not available for the iPad or are available only 
in more limited versions. For many people, the Microsoft Office 
apps are the epitome of this limitation: Even though Microsoft has 
built versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote for iOS 
(and for Android), these versions lack the features and power of the 
Windows and Mac versions. This same limitation applies to various 
power-user apps such as database apps, apps for manipulating 
photographs and editing video to a professional standard, and 
other apps too complex or too specialized to be ported to iOS.
■
■Tip  If you rely on an app that’s available for Windows but not for iOS, you may be 
able to run the app via a remote-desktop app such as Microsoft Remote Desktop (which is 
free). This can be a good solution for specialized but crucial apps, though it’s typically less 
effective than running a suitable app on the iPad itself. You may also be able to use web 
versions of some apps, although such versions tend to have fewer features than the desktop 
versions.
Analyzing Your Needs and Making a Plan
Once you’ve decided that you’ll be deploying iPads rather than another technology, you’ll 
need to work out the best way to deploy iPads. This section covers the main questions you 
should consider to establish your needs and plan the deployment. Consider the following:
• 
What deployment method will you use? Will you get iPads to issue 
to students, iPads to equip a classroom or classbound computer 
carts, or both? Will you get iPads for teachers?
• 
How many iPads will your school get?

Chapter 1 ■ Planning Your Classroom Deployment of iPads
8
• 
If you will equip the teachers with iPads, how will the teachers use 
the iPads?
• 
Will you need to train the teachers to use the iPads? If so, what 
kind of training will you run?
• 
How will you manage the iPads?
• 
How will the iPads fit into your school’s IT system and connect to 
its resources?
• 
Does your school have adequate network and Internet bandwidth 
to handle the increased traffic the iPads will bring?
What Deployment Model Will You Use?
Usually, your first decision is which deployment model you will use. Typically, this means 
choosing between a one-to-one deployment model and a model based on classes or 
classrooms:
• 
One-to-one: In the one-to-one deployment model, you issue an iPad 
to each student in a class or other group. Each student keeps that 
iPad and can store their own files on it. Normally the student gets 
to take the iPad home at the end of the school day so they can use it 
for homework and other study. However, in some cases, the iPad is 
restricted to the school’s premises, so the student checks it out at the 
beginning of the school day and checks it back in at the end.
• 
Class or classroom: In the class or classroom deployment model, 
you outfit a class or a classroom with enough iPads for the largest 
number of students the class or classroom will contain. (Class 
here refers to the group of students; classroom refers to the room.) 
The teacher issues an iPad to each student at the beginning of 
a lesson, and the student logs in to the iPad using a Managed 
Apple ID, causing the iPad to retrieve the student’s files from the 
network. At the end of the lesson, the student saves the files to 
the network and returns the iPad. In this deployment model, the 
iPads may live in the classroom or in another secure location, 
such as a charging and storage cart that you can move from one 
classroom to another as needed.
Whether you decide to issue iPads to students or to classes, you’ll likely want teachers 
to use iPads as well, especially if they’re using Apple’s Classroom app to run lessons  
(see Chapter 8 for more on Classroom). For each teacher who needs an iPad, you can 
choose between issuing an iPad on a permanent or semi-permanent basis and having the 
teacher use an iPad that’s assigned to the class or classroom in which they’ll be teaching. 
There are good arguments for and against both approaches, but issuing iPads to teachers 
enables them to do much more with the iPads and generally delivers greater value.

Chapter 1 ■ Planning Your Classroom Deployment of iPads

How Many iPads Will Your School Need?
After deciding which deployment model to use, you next need to establish roughly how 
many iPads your school will need. You should be able to determine the number easily 
enough based on the deployment model you’ve chosen:
• 
One-to-one deployment: Plan to get one iPad for each student 
involved, plus iPads for teachers or assistants, plus a reserve of 
extra iPads to cover for when students break their iPads, leave 
them at home, or incapacitate them.
• 
Class or classroom deployment: Plan to get one iPad for each of 
the maximum number of students who will be in the class or in 
the classroom, plus an iPad for each teacher or assistant who 
will lead the class. Again, you’ll want a reserve of iPads to handle 
contingencies such as iPads getting damaged or misconfigured, 
or visiting students or teachers requiring extra iPads.
GETTING AND MAINTAINING YOUR RESERVE OF IPADS
How many iPads do you need as a reserve? There’s no hard-and-fast answer, 
because it depends on your situation and your students, but between 10% and 
20% of the base number generally seems to work well. For example, for a class 
of 30 students, a reserve of 3 to 6 iPads would normally cover absentee iPads and 
attrition. But as usual, more would be better.
If money is tight, you may find it hard to get the budget for an adequate reserve of 
iPads in your initial deployment. And you may find that having the iPads do double 
duty as teacher training iPads or instructor iPads gets you further than simply calling 
them reserves.
You should also include at least some new iPads in your IT budget each year. 
Assuming you can buy some new iPads, you can then downgrade some of the 
surviving older iPads to reserve status. This way, you can gradually build up enough 
of a reserve to handle extra demand when it occurs.
Which Models of iPad Will You Get?
Next, you’ll need to decide which models of iPad to get for your deployment. Chapter 2 
looks at the current iPad models in some detail, but at a basic level, your choice will be 
based on the physical size (and screen size) of the iPads and by their power:
• 
iPad mini: The smallest iPad tends to be the best choice for 
younger students with smaller hands and for older students who 
need portability rather than screen size or power.

Chapter 1 ■ Planning Your Classroom Deployment of iPads
10
• 
iPad or 10.5-inch iPad Pro: The mid-size iPad models tend to be 
the best choice for most students and for many teachers. The 
screen size is large enough to display plenty of data, but the iPad 
itself is light enough (even with a protective case) to be easily 
portable. Unless students will need to run apps that require the 
extra power of the iPad Pro, or apps that require the Apple Pencil 
stylus (for example, art apps), choose the iPad model simply 
called iPad.
• 
12.9-inch iPad Pro: The larger iPad Pro model is too large and too 
vulnerable to damage for typical student use—not to mention too 
expensive for most budgets. But teachers may benefit from the 
greater screen size, especially for multitasking and for running 
classes with Classroom.
Will You Have Supervised iPads or Unsupervised iPads?
The next big choice you have to make is between supervised and unsupervised iPads. 
Here’s what those terms mean:
• 
Unsupervised iPad: The iPad’s user controls the iPad’s 
configuration. For example, when a consumer buys an iPad, they 
can set it up to work the way they prefer.
• 
Supervised iPad: You retain administrative control. You can 
configure the iPad using mobile device management (MDM) 
tools and limit the actions the user can take on the iPad.
For most school deployments, you’ll want supervised iPads because supervision  
lets you manage iPads centrally, saving time and effort. Supervision also lets you impose 
extra restrictions on an iPad, such as disallowing the use of specific apps or features  
(for example, you might disallow iMessage or Apple Music, or prevent the user from 
changing the passcode) or placing the iPad into Single App Mode (which limits the iPad 
to running an app that you specify).
■
■Note   If you’re deploying only a handful of iPads, you may choose to keep the iPads 
unsupervised and configure them manually, setting restrictions by working directly on each 
iPad, rather than making the iPads supervised and configuring them via policy. But for more 
than a few iPads, manual configuration quickly becomes a waste of time and effort, both of 
which supervision can save.

Chapter 1 ■ Planning Your Classroom Deployment of iPads
11
How Will Your School’s Teachers Use the iPads?
You’ll also need to consider how the teachers will use the iPads. There are many different 
ways of using an iPad for teaching, but the following tend to be the main uses:
• 
Use the Classroom app to lead lessons: Apple’s Classroom app is 
designed to enable a teacher to organize and manage a class. For 
example, using Classroom the teacher can open a web page or 
a document on all the students’ iPads to ensure that everyone is 
literally on the same page. Classroom also lets the teacher work 
with existing groups of students, such as those using a particular 
app, or create custom groups of students on the fly, switching 
from group to group as needed.
• 
Demonstrating techniques: The teacher can quickly demonstrate 
iPad skills and gestures, app usage, and so on using their own 
iPad to enable a student to perform those moves on their iPad.
• 
Displaying information on a TV or monitor: The teacher can share 
content from their iPad to a TV or monitor connected to an Apple 
TV, enabling all the students to see the content.
• 
Communicating with students: The teacher can communicate 
with students via various means, ranging from communication 
within the Classroom app to standard instant messaging and 
e-mail.
• 
Collecting and grading papers and homework: The teacher can 
collect work from students easily, grade it, and return it.
How Will Your School’s Students Use the iPads?
Students can use iPads to perform a wide range of tasks both at school and (in a one-to-
one deployment) outside it. The following list gives examples of typical tasks that students 
may perform using iPads:
• 
Reading textbooks: Many textbooks are available in electronic 
formats, reducing what students need to carry to and from school.
• 
Researching topics online: Students can access a vast array of 
information resources on the Internet, depending on restrictions 
you’ve applied to the iPads.
• 
Taking notes: The iPad is a great tool for taking notes, either in 
Apple’s lightweight Notes app or in a fuller note-taking app such 
as Microsoft OneNote.
• 
Creating and editing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations: 
Students can use apps such as Apple’s Pages or Microsoft Word to 
create and edit documents, Apple’s Numbers or Microsoft Excel to 
build spreadsheets, and Apple’s Keynote or Microsoft PowerPoint 
to develop presentations.

Chapter 1 ■ Planning Your Classroom Deployment of iPads
12
• 
E-mailing and communicating: The iPad comes equipped 
with Apple’s Mail app for e-mail, the Messages app for instant 
messaging, and the FaceTime app for audio and video calls.  
If necessary, you can add other communications apps that you 
permit the students to use.
• 
Completing and submitting papers and homework: Students can 
use the iPad to complete papers and homework and submit them 
to teachers for marking.
• 
Social networking: Social networking is notorious as a time-sink, 
but it can be useful for organizing and coordinating school-
related events.
• 
Shooting and editing videos: Students can use the iPad’s built-in 
front and rear cameras to shoot video clips and then edit them 
into projects by using Apple’s iMovie app or another app.
• 
Composing, recording, and editing music: Students can use 
Apple’s GarageBand app or another app to compose, record, and 
edit music directly on the iPad.
Which Apps Will You Need to Get?
The iPad comes with plenty of apps to get you and your students started with iPads.  
You can add other apps easily, and you can prevent students from using most of the 
included apps.

■Tip   Spend some time exploring the included apps to evaluate which of them will 
address your students’ needs and which other apps you will need to get. For example, 
if your students will create reports, spreadsheets, and other office documents, evaluate 
whether Pages, Numbers, and Keynote will be suitable. If not, you may need to add 
Microsoft Office apps such as Word and Excel to the iPads.
Understanding Your Options for Managing iPads
This section briefly considers two different ways of managing your school’s iPads: 
manually, using Apple Configurator, or using third-party mobile device management 
(MDM) apps.
Managing iPads Manually
Your first option is to manage the iPads manually—choosing settings directly on the 
devices by working manually with them, as you would with your own personal iPad. This 
hands-on approach is straightforward and can be effective if you have only a few iPads 
to manage. If you have to deal with a full classroom’s worth of iPads, though, you’ll likely 
need to use an automated means of management.
Chapter 3 covers essential iPad skills for administrators and teachers, including how 
to manage iPads manually. For example, you can apply restrictions to prevent an iPad’s 
user from taking undesirable actions, such as installing apps or deleting apps  
(see Figure 1-1).

Chapter 1 ■ Planning Your Classroom Deployment of iPads
15
Managing iPads Using Apple Configurator
Your second option is to manage the iPads using Apple Configurator, an app that Apple 
provides for configuring iPads, other iOS devices, and Apple TV. Apple Configurator runs 
only on Macs, so you need a Mac to be able to use it. Apple Configurator works only with 
devices connected directly to the Mac via USB, whereas many MDM tools can work via 
Wi-Fi as well. But if you can work with these limitations, Apple Configurator is a powerful 
tool for setting up, configuring, and managing iPads for a school or organization.
Chapter 4 explains how to manage iPads with Apple Configurator. Figure 1-2 shows 
Apple Configurator displaying information about iPads connected to a Mac.
Figure 1-1.  When managing iPads manually, you can apply restrictions to prevent the 
user from taking actions you don’t want

Chapter 1 ■ Planning Your Classroom Deployment of iPads
16
Managing iPads Using a Mobile Device Management Tool
Your third option is to manage the iPads using a mobile device management (MDM) 
tool from a third party. You can choose from a wide range of MDM solutions—unless 
your school already has an MDM tool for managing other clients, in which case you may 
be able to add the iPads using that tool. MDM tools vary in their capabilities, such as 
managing different types of clients. But most MDM tools that work with iOS devices can 
tap into all the management features that Apple has built into iOS, which means most of 
the MDM tools you’ll need to consider for managing your iPads have similar capabilities 
for managing iPads.
Chapter 6 covers how to manage iPads with MDM tools. Figure 1-3 shows TabPilot, 
one of the MDM tools discussed in Chapter 6.

Planning to Train Yourself and Your Colleagues
While evaluating the iPad as an educational tool, you’ll likely develop your own iPad 
skills to the point where you need only minimal or self-directed training to use an iPad 
as a teaching tool. But given how important it is for teachers to be not only proficient 
but also confident with iPads in class, you should plan full training on iPad use for all 
your colleagues who will use iPads for teaching. Some staff, especially those who have 
already used iPads, will likely get up to speed with only short sessions of formal training, 
but others may need multiple sessions of individual training to develop the skills and 
confidence required.
■
■Note   Chapter 3 provides in-depth coverage of the iPad skills you and your colleagues 
will need to know. Chapter 8 covers running a class with the Classroom app.
To make your training as effective as possible, get feedback from the teachers you 
train, both at the end of the training session and after they have been teaching with the 
iPad for a few weeks or months. If you will be training many teachers, you’ll likely benefit 
from creating a feedback questionnaire and logging the responses you get. If you know 
Figure 1-3.  TabPilot is a third-party MDM tool that you can use to manage iPads

Chapter 1 ■ Planning Your Classroom Deployment of iPads

you’ll be training only a few teachers, less formal feedback may be all you need to identify 
any areas of the training that need strengthening, other topics from which teachers will 
benefit, and any included information that’s confusing or unnecessary.
■
■Tip   Aim to develop an ongoing process of review and improvement for your iPad 
deployment, training, and teaching. You’ll need to involve teachers, support staff, students, 
and in some cases students’ parents in the process.
Checking Your School’s Wireless Network Infrastructure 
and Bandwidth
Next, you need to make sure that your school’s network infrastructure will be able to 
handle the additional load the iPads will impose on it. You also need to make sure that 
the network and the Internet connection have enough bandwidth for the traffic the iPads 
will cause.
SHOULD YOU BOOST EXISTING NETWORK CAPACITY OR 
ADD A SEPARATE NETWORK FOR IPADS?
If you find that your school’s Wi-Fi network won’t be adequate to handle the extra 
traffic from the iPads you’re planning to add, you may need to decide between 
boosting the capacity of the existing network and adding a separate network to 
handle only the iPads.
Which approach makes more sense for you will depend on the school’s existing 
network and the capacity you need to add to bring the network up to scratch. But if you 
find yourself evaluating this issue, don’t dismiss out of hand the possibility of adding 
a separate Wi-Fi network for the iPads. Rather, look into any benefits that a separate, 
iPad-only network can offer you, such as being able to give the iPads different access 
rules to school resources and the Internet. If your existing network’s management tools 
can identify the iPads and implement filtering for them, that would be an argument in 
favor of beefing up the existing network rather than adding a network.
Determining Whether Your Wireless Network Infrastructure Is 
Adequate
You will need to determine whether your school’s wireless network infrastructure is 
adequate to handle the additional load that the iPads will generate. You will need to 
check four main things:

Chapter 1 ■ Planning Your Classroom Deployment of iPads
19
Verifying the Signal Strength
Check that there is strong Wi-Fi signal everywhere that students and teachers will use the 
iPads in the school. For example, you may need to check the following areas:
• 
Classrooms: Make sure each classroom has a strong Wi-Fi signal.
• 
Other teaching areas: Verify signal strength in other teaching 
areas, such as labs, where students and teachers will be using 
iPads.
• 
Teacher office and lounge: Make sure teachers will have an 
adequate Wi-Fi signal where they prepare their lessons.
• 
Common areas: For a one-to-one deployment, check the signal in 
other areas where students will use their iPads. For example, the 
student lounge and cafeteria will likely need good connectivity.
Although an iPad can transfer data over a weak connection, you’ll get better results 
if the signal is strong, especially when many iPads are sharing the same wireless access 
point. You may have to add wireless access points, repeaters, or antennae to boost the 
signal.
■
■Tip   If your school’s budget permits, overspecify the wireless network—make the 
network more powerful than you currently need—so that you can expand your deployment 
of iPads and other devices easily in the future. Spending money on extra wireless access 
points and other infrastructure up front will generally save you money in the long term by 
reducing performance problems that you’d need to troubleshoot.
Checking for Wireless Dead Spots
While checking signal strength, make sure there are no dead spots—places where there 
is no wireless signal at all. Murphy’s Law guarantees that if there any dead spots, students 
(or teachers) will find they need to use the iPads there. You may need to add wireless 
access points to eliminate dead spots.
■
■Tip   Add to your school’s intranet site a page where students can report low signal or 
dead spots to the network administrators.
Checking the Network Bandwidth
Use a traffic analyzer to measure network bandwidth and see if you need to increase it to 
handle the number of iPads you’re expecting the school to use. To increase bandwidth, 
you may need to add access points or upgrade switches and cabling.

Chapter 1 ■ Planning Your Classroom Deployment of iPads
20
SHARED IPAD MAY CAUSE LARGE TRAFFIC SPIKES
If you will use the Shared iPad feature to allocate iPads to the students in classes, 
you’ll need to plan to handle large spikes in Wi-Fi network traffic. These spikes will 
typically occur at the start of a lesson, when students log in to the iPads and the 
iPads automatically pull their files and settings across the network.
Shared iPad attempts to reduce the amount of traffic by, wherever possible, 
allocating each iPad to a student whose files are currently stored on that iPad. But 
even with this smart allocation, Shared iPad can cause a large amount of network 
traffic, so you should budget for plenty of capacity.
Checking the Capacity for Devices to Connect
Make sure your wireless access points have enough capacity for all the iPads and other 
devices that may connect at once. You may need to add wireless access points in order to 
get enough iPads (and other devices) connected to the network at the speeds you require.
■
■Caution   Take the advertised capacity of enterprise-grade wireless access points with 
a pinch of salt. In real-world use, you’re likely to find that an access point with an advertised 
capacity of 100+ clients can handle only 50 or so clients effectively. Similarly, an access 
point that claims to be able to handle 200 or more clients may not perform well with more 
than, say, 75 active clients. Test the performance of your access points both when you install 
them and when your iPad deployment is up and running.
Determining Whether Your Internet Bandwidth Is Adequate
You’ll also need to determine whether your school’s Internet bandwidth is adequate for 
the increased traffic that the iPads will produce. As you’d expect, bandwidth adequacy 
will depend partly on the speed of the Internet connection and how much of the 
bandwidth the school is using already—if the connection is already maxed out, you can 
be sure that adding the iPad to the demand will make matters worse.
The effect of the iPads will also depend on how the students and teachers are 
using them and what measures you can take to mitigate the amount of traffic the iPads 
generate. For example, students may need to stream videos from YouTube to assist with 
their schoolwork. If each student in a class will need to watch the same video, having a 
caching server can greatly reduce the amount of Internet bandwidth needed. But if each 
student will need to watch their own choice of videos, a caching server won’t help much 
because each video will need to be streamed across the Internet connection.
The nearby sidebar suggests some measures you can take to reduce the Internet 
bandwidth the iPads require.

Chapter 1 ■ Planning Your Classroom Deployment of iPads
21
WAYS TO REDUCE THE INTERNET BANDWIDTH THE 
IPADS REQUIRE
Depending on your network, its configuration, and how your school will use its iPads, 
you may be able to take some of the following measures to reduce the amount of 
Internet bandwidth the iPads consume:
•	
Spread the iPad lessons around the timetable: If the timetable 
permits, schedule the iPad lessons that are likely to cause heavy 
Internet traffic so that they occur at different times rather than 
overlap. This move works better in a class or classroom deployment 
than a one-to-one deployment.
•	
Keep files on your intranet rather than on the Internet: Where 
possible, have students and teachers store files on the school’s 
intranet rather than on the Internet so the files can be downloaded 
and shared quickly without burdening the Internet connection.
•	
Restrict access to websites: iOS includes restrictions that enable 
you to limit the websites an iPad can access. You can choose 
between permitting only specific sites, blocking specific sites, and 
blocking sites that meet certain criteria (such as sites that identify 
themselves as having adult content). See Chapter 3 for details.
•	
Use a caching server: If multiple students will need to access the 
same content on the Internet, a caching server on your network 
can greatly reduce the bandwidth required. Once one client has 
requested the content, and the server has downloaded the content 
and saved it to its cache, the server can provide the content to other 
clients from the cache rather than having to download it again.
•	
Control updates centrally: Assuming you manage the iPads centrally, 
you can schedule iOS and app updates to happen at night, when 
your school’s network is (or should be) less busy.
•	
Prevent or limit cloud backup: The iPad can be configured to back 
up data automatically to Apple’s iCloud service. Automatic backup 
can be a great way for users to avoid losing files if the iPad gets 
lost, stolen, or broken, but it can impose heavy demands on your 
school’s Internet connection. To avoid this problem, you can disallow 
the use of iCloud through policy (restrictions you apply). Disallowing 
iCloud may be easier in a class or classroom deployment than in 
a one-to-one deployment, because in a one-to-one deployment 
students will typically need to back up their iPads to iCloud or 
another online destination for security.

Summary
This chapter discussed in general terms how to plan your deployment of iPads in the 
classroom. It covered the capabilities of iPads and how they stack up against laptops 
and desktops for use in schools. You’re now equipped to decide between a one-to-
one deployment of iPads—issuing an iPad to each student in a class or year—and a 
deployment based on classrooms or classes. You know about the benefits that turning 
iPads into supervised iPads brings, and you’re in a position to choose among managing 
iPads manually, managing them using Apple Configurator, and managing them using a 
third-party MDM tool. You also know you need to determine whether your school has 
robust enough infrastructure and sufficient bandwidth to handle the iPads or whether 
you will need to improve the infrastructure or increase the bandwidth.
In the next chapter, I’ll discuss how to choose the best iPads for your school and how 
to select suitable accessories for the iPads.

CHAPTER 2
Choosing iPads and 
Accessories
In this chapter, we’ll consider how to choose the right iPads for your school’s needs and 
how to select suitable accessories to enable you, your students, and your colleagues to 
make the most of the iPads.
We’ll start by going over the salient features of the current iPad models, from the 
device size and screen size through the amount of storage to the processor and the 
amount of RAM each iPad contains. We’ll then look at how to choose chargers, cases, 
screen protectors, and mounts and stands (if you’ll need them). Finally, we’ll discuss your 
options for adding hardware keyboards to iPads, consider where you will store the iPads, 
and evaluate whether to add the Apple Pencil stylus to any iPad Pro models you get.
Reviewing the iPad Models
Since releasing the first iPad in April 2010, Apple has released a wide variety of iPad 
models. As of Fall 2017, there are three main sizes of iPad:
• 
Small: iPad mini
• 
Medium: iPad and smaller iPad Pro
• 
Large: Full-size iPad Pro

Chapter 2 ■ Choosing iPads and Accessories
24
Figure 2-1 shows the relative sizes of the iPad models.
Device Size, Screen Size, and Resolution
The most obvious differences among the three sizes of iPad models is the physical size of 
the devices and the screens they contain. As is normal for tablet computers, the screen 
dominates the front of the iPad and largely controls the size of the device, with a relatively 
slim bezel (the rim around the screen) taking up the rest of the front.
Table 2-1 shows the dimensions, screen sizes, screen resolutions, and weights of the 
current iPad models.

Amount of Storage
iPads come with different amounts of internal storage. As of this writing, the storage on 
current models ranges from 32 GB to 256 GB; see Table 2-2 for details. Older iPad models 
have had other capacities, such as 16 GB and 64 GB.
WHY DOES A 32 GB IPAD HAVE ONLY 27.5 GB 
AVAILABLE?
When deciding how much storage you need on the iPads, bear in mind that 
the actual amount of storage available on an iPad is substantially less than the 
advertised number. For example, a 32 GB iPad normally has around 27.5 GB of 
free space. Part of the difference is the iPad’s operating system, which consumes 
a couple of gigabytes and which you can’t sensibly do without, and the apps that 
come with the operating system, which Apple makes difficult to remove.
The other reason for the difference is that, like most manufacturers of computers 
and devices, Apple uses decimal (base 10) numbers rather than binary (base 2) 
numbers for measuring storage capacity. In decimal, a gigabyte has 1,000,000,000 
bytes of storage—1000 × 1000 × 1000. But in binary, a gigabyte has 
1,073,741,824 bytes—1024 × 1024 × 1024—or 7.4% more; technically, this is a 
gibibyte, or 1 GiB, but few people use that term. So when Apple describes an iPad as 
having 32 GB of storage, that means it has 32,000,000,000 bytes, which translates 
to 29.8 GB in binary. Add the operating system, and the available space drops to 
27.5 GB.

Chapter 2 ■ Choosing iPads and Accessories
27
■
■Note   The storage on an iPad is fixed and can’t be increased. iPads also don’t include 
SD card slots or other expansion slots for adding storage, so it’s important to assess 
realisitically how much storage your iPads will need. Given that app sizes tend to increase 
rather than decrease, it’s wise to allow extra space over and above current needs.
As you’d likely expect, the more storage an iPad model has, the more it costs.  
So unless you need a lot of storage on the iPads, you’ll probably do best to buy the  
lower-capacity models of the type of iPad your school needs.
Apple designed the iPad models to handle both consumer use and business use 
rather than having different models of iPad for different uses. Both consumers and 
businesses may require large storage capacity, though for different reasons; for example, 
a consumer may want to store many song and movie files on their iPad, whereas a 
businessperson may want to carry documentation, large presentations, or demonstration 
videos.
How much storage your school’s iPads will need will vary depending on how you will 
use the iPads. Here are three examples:
• 
If you will keep the iPads in the classroom, where different 
students use the iPads for different classes, you’ll normally do best 
to keep all data files on the network, where you can back them up 
easily, rather than on the iPads themselves. As a result, you likely 
can get away with small amounts of storage on the iPads: even if 
the students shoot or edit videos on the iPads during lessons, 32 
GB should be plenty of storage.
• 
If each student will have an iPad to take home as a quasi-personal 
device, they will likely need to store more files on them. For such 
iPads, 128 GB is normally a better choice.
• 
If staff members will have dedicated iPads as teaching devices, 
you’ll probably want to allow plenty of storage. If these iPads are 
iPad Pro models, consider going for 256 GB; otherwise, go for 128 
GB. Even on the iPad Pro, 512 GB is usually overkill unless the 
users will be shooting large amounts of video and editing it on  
the iPads.
Video is the item that’s likely to consume the most space on iPads used in the 
classroom. If your students will shoot and edit videos during lessons, but not store the 
videos on the iPads from one lesson to the next, 32 GB may be enough. But if your students 
will shoot and edit video on the iPads over the long term, you will likely want to get 
higher-capacity iPads—especially if the students are working with high-resolution video. 
Table 2-3 shows the resolutions and capabilities of the iPad models’ rear camera, the one 
you’ll normally use for shooting photos and videos. Table 2-4 shows the resolutions and 
capabilities of the front camera, which is designed for selfies and video calling.

figures are approximate, because they depend on the subject matter and how well the

RAM
The iPad models contain different amounts of RAM, as listed in Table 2-6. Each iPad has 
a fixed amount of RAM; the RAM is not upgradeable, even if you have the skills of a repair 
technician. Apple doesn’t promote the amount of RAM as a feature, instead taking the 
position that each iPad has the amount of RAM it needs, and that RAM is something that 
the user doesn’t need to worry about.
As with most computers, having more RAM enables an iPad to process more 
information at once, so it typically improves performance.
Processor
The iPad models use the A series of processors developed by Apple. Recent iPad models 
include motion coprocessors from Apple’s M series as well. The motion coprocessor collects 
data from the iPad’s accelerometers, compasses, and gyroscopes and processes the data.

Chapter 2 ■ Choosing iPads and Accessories
30
As with the RAM, each iPad model comes with a specific processor; you don’t get to 
choose among different processor options for a particular iPad model. Table 2-7 has the 
details. Even so, it’s worth keeping the processor in mind when selecting iPad models. 
Apple gives these performance comparisons:
• 
The 12.9-inch iPad Pro and 10.5-inch iPad Pro have a processor 
2.5 times faster than the A8 processor in the iPad mini. Graphics 
performance in the iPad Pro models is 4.3 times faster than in the 
iPad mini.
• 
The iPad model’s A9 processor is 1.6 times faster than the A8 in 
the iPad mini, and graphics performance is 1.8 times faster.

Touch ID
All current iPad models all have Touch ID, which uses a fingerprint sensor built into the 
Home button as a means of authentication. Some older iPad models, such as the recently 
discontinued iPad mini 2, don’t have Touch ID.
Touch ID is a great feature for anyone who uses the same iPad regularly: it unlocks 
the iPad more quickly and with less effort than typing a passcode. You can register up 
to five fingerprints (or thumbprints), which enables you to use Touch ID even if some of 
your fingertips get rough or abraded. In a school situation, you can have multiple people 
register a fingerprint each—for example, if you want several teachers or technicians to 
be able to unlock the iPads. Touch ID normally works well no matter the orientation in 
which the fingerprint is applied to the Home button, so you don’t have to hold the iPad in 
a particular orientation.
For iPads kept in classrooms and used by many students, Touch ID is less useful: you 
can’t register more than five fingerprints per iPad, so students will need to use passcodes 
to unlock the iPads.

Suggestions for Choosing the Right iPads for Your School
Now that you know the salient features of the three sizes of iPads available, you should 
be in a position to determine which models will best suit your school. Your choice will 
naturally depend on your school, your students, and how you plan to use the iPads. But 
here are general suggestions for consideration:
• 
Younger students: If your students are young and have smaller 
hands, the iPad mini may be a better choice for handheld use 
than the iPad or iPad Pro.
• 
Teenage or older students: The iPad model is usually the best 
choice for general use. If you need more power, go for the 10.5-
inch iPad Pro.
• 
Staff members: The iPad model is usually the best choice for 
general use for staff members too. If staff members will need 
a more powerful tablet, go for one of the iPad Pro models. The 
12.9-inch iPad Pro is great for any staff member who needs more 
screen space to work on documents or monitor what students 
are doing, but it’s large enough to be awkward to carry around, 
especially if you add a protective case.
Normally, each iPad that will be used as a handheld device will need a case, and 
preferably a rugged one. If the iPads will be fixed in place, each will need a mount or 
stand. I talk more about mounts and stands later in this chapter.
Choosing Chargers for Your iPads
Each iPad comes with a charger that connects to the iPad via the same USB cable used for 
connecting the iPad to a computer for management and synchronization. All current and 
recent iPad models use the Lightning connector, which is a small reversible connector 
capable of transferring both power and data. Older iPad models used a larger connector 
called the Dock connector, which Apple originally introduced with the first iPod models.
The iPad’s own charger is almost always the fastest and most consistent way to 
charge an iPad, so it should be your default choice for charging. These are the three main 
alternatives:
• 
Third-party charger: Many third-party manufacturers make 
chargers that can charge an iPad—or several iPads. Unless you 
lose an iPad’s own charger, or the charger stops working, the main 
reason for getting a third-party charger is to charge multiple iPads 
(or other devices) at the same time. You may also want to get a 
second charger for an iPad you use in two locations, such as at 
work and at home.
• 
USB port on computer: You can charge an iPad from the USB port 
on a computer. Charging from a USB port typically takes much 
longer than using the iPad’s own charger, so normally you’ll want 
to do this only in a pinch.

Charging cabinet or cart: For iPads that you’ll keep in your 
classroom, another means of charging is a secure storage cabinet 
that provides charging or syncing capabilities; for iPads that need 
to move from classroom to classroom, you can get a cart instead. 
See the section “Choosing Storage Locations for iPads,” later in 
this chapter, for suggestions.
CRITERIA FOR CHOOSING CHARGERS FOR IPADS
Here are three recommendations for choosing chargers for iPads:
•	
Make sure the charger provides enough power: Many multi-
device chargers are designed to power smaller devices, such as 
smartphones, rather than tablets with large batteries. The standard 
Apple power supply for the iPad is the Apple 12W USB Power 
Adapter, and it takes several hours to charge an iPad fully. So you 
might consider 12W as the baseline per port for charging iPads at a 
reasonable speed.
•	
Make sure the charger is certified by Apple: To verify that the 
charger is both safe to use and compatible with the iPad, get a 
model that’s certified by Apple. Certified models tend to be more 
expensive than uncertified ones, but an uncertified charger has the 
potential to damage the iPad or cause other electrical problems, so 
it may prove a false economy.
•	
Upgrade your charging of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro: The 12.9-inch 
iPad Pro comes with a Apple 12W USB Power Adapter, which takes 
four or five hours for a full charge. If you need to charge this iPad 
model more quickly, go to the Apple Store (online or offline) and get 
the Apple 29W USB-C Power Adapter ($49.00) with Apple’s USB-C 
to Lightning Cable ($19.00 for 1 meter—usually sufficient—or 
$29.00 for 2 meters). The Apple 29W USB-C Power Adapter is 
essentially the MacBook’s power adapter, and you’ll find it listed 
under MacBook Accessories, but it works for the iPad Pro as well. 
(The cable is listed under iPad Accessories.) This combination 
charges the 12.9-inch iPad Pro in two to three hours.
Choosing and Using Cases
Apple’s focus on making its handheld devices thin, light, and beautiful means that they’re 
all too easy to drop and even easier to damage. As a result, most people who buy an iPad, 
an iPhone, or an iPod touch choose to protect their device with a case, even though doing 
so makes the device less thin, less light, and usually less beautiful.

Chapter 2 ■ Choosing iPads and Accessories
33
Normally, you’ll want to get cases for your school’s iPads unless you’re using another 
means of protection, such as mounts or stands (see the next section, “Choosing and 
Using iPad Mounts and Stands”). Students are often insouciant with sleek and expensive 
technology, especially when it belongs to someone else, but each iPad represents a 
capital investment for your school—an investment you’ll presumably want to protect.
You can choose from a bewildering variety of cases, depending on which models 
your iPads are, what kinds of cases you need, and how much you’re prepared to pay for 
them. The following sections introduce you to the four main categories of cases that are 
likely to prove useful for school iPads:
• 
Rugged cases
• 
Smart covers
• 
Flip cases or folio cases
• 
Keyboard cases
WHAT KINDS OF CASES DO YOUR IPADS NEED?
The kinds of cases you need will likely depend on how your school will use the 
iPads. For example, consider the following:
•	
iPads kept in the classroom: iPads that live indoors and are used as 
handheld devices (as opposed to being fixed on stands or mounts) 
will need cases that provide protection against drops, knocks, and 
student exuberance.
•	
iPads used in and outside the school: iPads that venture beyond the 
classroom will need heavy-duty cases, preferably ones that provide 
water resistance as well as drop protection.
•	
iPads issued to students: If the school issues an iPad to each 
student in a class, you may be better off to let each student choose 
a suitable case, either freely or from a pool of available approved 
cases. Letting the student choose the case increases the chance 
that the student will be able to recognize the iPad and perhaps even 
treat it more carefully.
Depending on your situation, you’ll likely have to consider other factors as well  
when choosing cases. For example, for iPads you keep in the classroom and store 
in a security cabinet or cart (see the section “Choosing Storage Locations for iPads,” 
later in this chapter), you’ll also need to make sure that the cased iPads fit in the 
storage slots.

Chapter 2 ■ Choosing iPads and Accessories
34
Evaluating Rugged Cases
Call me overly cautious, but I’ve yet to see a case that’s too rugged for an iPad that will be 
used as a handheld device in a school or out in the wide world. Even a minor drop can do 
severe damage to an iPad, and repairs to iPads are expensive and disruptive. Fortunately, 
case manufacturers have produced a wide range of rugged cases for the various iPad 
models.
Here are three examples of rugged cases for iPads:
• 
OtterBox Defender: One of the heaviest-duty cases around, the 
OtterBox Defender transforms a sleek iPad into a rugged tablet 
somewhat reminiscent of those used by delivery drivers and 
supermarket stock-checkers. The OtterBox Defender (prices start 
from $89.99, available at www.otterbox.com or at major online 
stores) offers what OtterBox calls Certified Drop+ Protection, 
for which you may want to watch the video rather than try the 
experiment yourself. The main part of the case has a rigid internal 
frame with a rubberized outer covering and a built-in screen 
protector. There’s also a hard-shell back that unclips to form a 
stand that can hold the iPad at a shallow angle or a steeper angle, 
either in portrait orientation or landscape orientation.
• 
Griffin Survivor All-Terrain: The Survivor All-Terrain series from 
Griffin Technology (www.griffintechnology.com) is a sturdy 
two-layer case with sealed ports to keep out dust and water. A 
built-in screen protector shields the screen from scratches, and a 
kickstand props up the iPad at either a steep angle or a low angle 
in landscape orientation. The Survivor All-Terrain series starts at 
around $50.
• 
Gumdrop DropTech: The DropTech case series from Gumdrop 
(www.gumdropcases.com), has a rigid internal frame, an outer 
silicone skin, and a built-in screen protector that is replaceable. 
The DropTech iPad Air 2 Case ($59.95) is certified compliant with 
the MIL-STD-810G military specification test, which means that it 
has protected the tablet against 26 drops from a four-foot height. 
Gumdrop sells cases singly or in 10-packs.
Evaluating Smart Covers
A smart cover is a lightweight cover for the iPad’s screen that connects magnetically to 
the side and front of the iPad but leaves the back uncovered. Opening the smart cover 
automatically wakes the iPad, and closing it puts the iPad to sleep. The smart cover folds 
in several ways to make a stand that props the iPad up at angles suitable for typing on the 
onscreen keyboard (a shallow angle) or for watching videos (a steeper angle).
Smart covers are popular because they protect the screen while the iPad is not in use 
and increase the iPad’s bulk by only a little. But because it provides no protection to the 
iPad’s back when the screen is covered, and no protection to the screen when the screen 
isn’t covered, it doesn’t offer enough protection for most classroom use.

Chapter 2 ■ Choosing iPads and Accessories
35
Apple made the original Smart Covers, but various third-party smart covers are 
also available, generally at lower prices than Apple’s—sometimes much lower. Because 
there’s substantial variation in quality among third-party smart covers, it’s a good idea to 
examine them in a physical store before buying.
■
■Note   You can also get smart cases for iPads. As you’d guess, these are cases that 
wake the iPad on opening and put it to sleep on closing.
Evaluating Folio Cases
Folio cases can be a good choice for iPads that need only a moderate amount of 
protection. They’re not usually sufficient for the rough-and-tumble life of iPads shared in 
the classroom, but they may be adequate for iPads issued as personal devices to students 
who can be trusted to take care of them.
There are many kinds of folio cases, but the basic idea is a case that encloses the iPad 
and has a cover that closes over the top. The cover may include magnets and may make 
the case act as a smart case, automatically waking the iPad on opening and putting it to 
sleep on closing. The cover folds back when the iPad is in use, and may do double-duty as 
a stand.
Evaluating Keyboard Cases
If your iPads will be used for creating documents or otherwise entering substantial 
amounts of text, you may want to consider keyboard cases for them. A keyboard case can 
turn an iPad into a sort of touchscreen laptop, enabling a user who can touch-type to 
enter text far more quickly than by using the on-screen keyboard.
You can find a wide variety of different types of keyboard cases. Here are three 
examples to use as a starting point in your research:
• 
Zagg Rugged Book and Slim Book series: The Rugged Book series 
and Slim Book series from Zagg Inc. (www.zagg.com) consist 
of protective cases for the iPad and a detachable Bluetooth 
keyboard. The two-part design enables you to use the iPad 
separately from the keyboard (which Zagg calls Case Mode) or in 
three positions with the keyboard: laptop style (Keyboard Mode), 
with the keyboard as a stand (Video Mode), or with the keyboard 
folded flat beneath the iPad (Book Mode).
• 
Brydge series: Brydge (www.brydgekeyboards.com) makes a series 
of keyboards for iPads and for Microsoft Surface Pro. Of the 
models designed for iPad, the Brydge 9.7 ($129.99) fits the iPad 
(and older models, such as the iPad Air 2, iPad Air, and 9.7-inch 
iPad Pro); the Brydge 10.5 ($139.99) fits the 10.5-inch iPad Pro; the 
Brydge 12.9 ($149.99) fits the 12.9-inch iPad Pro; and the Brydge 
7.9 ($99.99) fits the iPad mini 4.

Chapter 2 ■ Choosing iPads and Accessories
36
• 
Logitech CREATE: The CREATE series of keyboard cases from 
Logitech (www.logitech.com) includes models for the older 9.7-inch 
iPad Pro ($129.99) and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro ($149.99); as of this 
writing, there is no CREATE keyboard for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro.
Choosing Screen Protectors
The touchscreen is one of the most vulnerable parts of the iPad—and one of the most 
expensive parts to replace. You can protect it to some extent with a screen protector. As 
you’ve seen earlier in this chapter, some iPad cases include built-in screen protectors. 
If you’ll be using such cases, you’re all set for screen protectors; if not, you can apply a 
separate screen protector.
DECIDING WHETHER YOUR IPADS NEED SCREEN 
PROTECTORS
Some pundits recommend against using screen protectors, saying that the iPad’s 
Gorilla Glass screen is tough enough to resist most scratches and that heavier-duty 
screen protectors can make the touchscreen harder to use. But in a high-impact 
environment such as a school, iPads usually need as much protection as you can 
give them.
For iPad Pro models that will be used with the Apple Pencil, you may want to  
either skip the screen protector or apply an ultra-thin tempered glass one. It’s a 
good idea to test different types of screen protectors to see which work best with 
the Apple Pencil.
You can choose among three main types of screen protectors:
• 
Plastic screen protectors: Plastic screen protectors are usually 
the least expensive, but can still be effective. You’ll find a wide 
variety of plastic screen protectors on online stores. The thickness 
of the plastic varies, as does the feel of the surface and the 
responsiveness of the touchscreen through it.
• 
Tempered glass screen protectors: Tempered glass screen 
protectors are typically more expensive than plastic screen 
protectors, but they can provide better protection and give the 
iPad’s screen a better feel. Different thicknesses are available, but 
generally thinness is a selling point. You can find a wide variety of 
these too on online stores.
• 
Liquid treatments: Instead of applying a solid sheet of plastic 
or tempered glass, you can apply a liquid coating that, once it’s 
dried, resists grease, dirt, and scratches. Examples include Liquid 
Armor from Dynaflo (around $19.99 at online stores).

Chapter 2 ■ Choosing iPads and Accessories
37
You’ll likely want to try several types and thicknesses of screen protectors to find out 
which work best for you and your school. Apart from the protection and the feel that the 
screen protectors deliver, you’ll likely want to consider how easy they are to apply.
Application is easy in principle:
• 
Clean the screen with a microfiber cloth (which most screen 
protectors include).
• 
Peel the protective plastic off the first side of the screen protector.
• 
Apply the screen protector to the screen, aligning its edges to the 
edges of the iPad’s screen.
• 
Smooth out any bubbles using either a provided tool, a credit 
card, or another straight edge (such as a ruler).
• 
Peel the protective plastic off the second side of the screen 
protector.
As usual, the devil is in the details. Unless you get the screen absolutely clean, bits 
of lint or dust may be trapped under the screen protector. Unless you get the screen 
protector straight, it won’t fit properly. And with most plastic screen protectors or 
tempered glass screen protectors, it’s easy to get bubbles under the film that are difficult 
to remove. So it’s a good idea to buy plenty of extra screen protectors to practice with. 
And if you find applying screen protectors difficult, see whether any of your students are 
already skilled at applying screen protectors—or if they want to develop the skill.
Choosing and Using iPad Mounts and Stands
If your iPads will remain in one place—whether that place is the classroom or 
elsewhere—you might want to use mounts or stands to secure and protect the tablets. 
The right mount or stand can ensure the iPad doesn’t stray from where it’s supposed to 
be, that it doesn’t get dashed against the floor or other unforgiving objects, and that it 
stays connected to power.
■
■Note   Many laptop and desktop computers have a built-in Kensington Security Slot, an 
anti-theft feature that enables you to secure the computer using a Kensington security cable 
that locks into the slot. As of this writing, no iPad model has a built-in Kensington Slot, nor 
is there an equivalent security device. So, to secure an iPad, you need to put it in a mount, 
frame, or enclosure that has a locking mechanism or Kensington Slot.
You can choose from a wide variety of stands and mounts, some designed 
specifically for the iPad family and others for tablets in general. The following subsections 
review the main categories of stands and mounts.

Chapter 2 ■ Choosing iPads and Accessories
38
SUGGESTIONS FOR CHOOSING MOUNTS AND STANDS 
FOR SCHOOL USE
Many mounts and stands are designed for home use rather than business use. These 
vary widely in price, materials, and construction, but—generally speaking—many are 
lightweight and do little more than prop up the iPad at one or more convenient angles. 
Such mounts and stands are designed to be easy to move around as needed, so you 
can use them on the kitchen table, on your desk, in the den, or wherever. The iPad 
may simply be placed in the mount or stand rather than secured in it.
Such mounts and stands are fine for home use, but for school use, you’ll typically want 
mounts or stands that fix—and preferably lock—the iPad in place and that themselves 
are fixed (and perhaps locked) to large or immovable objects, preferably in a way that’s 
hard to undo. You’ll want the mounts and stands to be sturdy enough to withstand 
robust handling themselves; you may also want them to protect the iPads from damage.
This means you’ll be looking for mounts and stands designed and built for 
commercial and industrial uses rather than home use. Such mounts and stands tend 
to be considerably more expensive than ones designed for home use, but the extra 
utility they deliver should more than offset the extra cost.
Desk Mounts
A desk mount enables you to fix an iPad firmly to a school desk, table, or other flat surface. 
You can choose from a wide variety of desk mounts, including these two:
• 
Kensington SecureBack Enclosure and Stand for 9.7-inch iPad 
Models: This enclosure and stand, made by hardware security 
specialist Kensington (http://www.kensington.com), locks the iPad 
firmly in a jacket that connects securely to a stand that provides 360° 
rotation. The enclosure and stand together cost $159.99.
• 
POS Lock Belt and X Lock System: The POS Lock Belt series from  
Proper (www.studioproper.com) enables you to connect an  
iPad, iPad Pro, or iPad mini securely to a variety of stands and  
mounts. The POS Lock Belt—POS is the abbreviation for point  
of sale, not a term of abuse—connects to the iPad and tightens 
with Allen bolts. The POS Lock Belt then connects to a stand or 
mount, such as the POS Swivel Stand, via the X-shaped cutout.
VESA Mounts
You can find various VESA mounts that work with iPads, enabling you to mount the  
iPad on stands, monitor arms, or other devices that have standard VESA fittings.  
(See the nearby sidebar “What Is VESA, and What Is a VESA Mount?” for more 
information on VESA mounts.) VESA mounts can be great if you already have stands, 
monitor arms, or other devices on which you want to mount the iPads. They’re also useful 

Chapter 2 ■ Choosing iPads and Accessories
39
if you need to ensure you have a standard mounting mechanism rather than a custom 
mounting mechanism.
Some VESA mounts are specifically designed for individual iPad models; others work 
with a range of tablets and similar devices. For school use, it’s worth evaluating both, but 
in most cases, mounts designed for the iPad models you’re using will normally work best. 
You’ll normally want to get lockable iPad mounts. Many of these require you to put the 
iPad in a particular enclosure or case.
Here are two examples of VESA mounts for iPads:
• 
Full Metal Jacket 3.0 series and Evolve iPad series: The Full Metal 
Jacket 3.0 series and the Evolve iPad series, both from ArmorActive 
(www.armoractive.com), consist of secure iPad enclosures with 
75 mm and 100 mm VESA mounting holes. Each series includes 
enclosures for 9.7-inch iPad models (such as the iPad, the older 
iPad Air and iPad Air 2, and the older 9.7-inch iPad Pro).
• 
Kensington SecureBack Rugged Enclosure: The SecureBack Rugged 
Enclosure from Kensington (www.kensington.com, $69.99) 
provides an easy way to secure an iPad to a 75 mm VESA mount.
WHAT IS VESA, AND WHAT IS A VESA MOUNT?
VESA is the acronym for Video Electronics Standards Association, a technical 
standards organization that has developed and promoted a wide variety of computer 
display standards since its establishment in 1989. Many of the VESA-developed 
standards, such as the VESA Local Bus video bus and the VESA Advanced Feature 
Connector (VAFC) connector for video cards, have been swamped by the tides of 
technology, but the VESA mount is still extremely widely used.
The VESA mount, formally known as either the Flat Display Mounting Interface 
(FDMI) or VESA Mounting Interface Standard (MIS), has four screw holes on either 
a square or X-shaped mount. VESA mounts use different hole spacings and screw 
sizes for different sizes and weights of displays.
•	
VESA 75: 75 mm × 7 5mm, with M4 screws, for up to 17.5 lbs
•	
VESA 100: 100 mm × 100 mm, with M4 screws, for up to 30.8 lbs
•	
VESA 200: 200 mm × 200 mm, with M6 screws, for up to 110 lbs
•	
VESA 200: 200 mm × 200 mm or larger, with M8 screws, for up to 250 lbs
Most VESA mounts for iPads and other tablets have 75 mm VESA holes, 100 mm 
VESA holes, or both.

Chapter 2 ■ Choosing iPads and Accessories
40
Wall Mounts
Wall mounts enable you to secure iPads to walls and other flat surfaces. You can choose 
between fixed mounts and ones that fold out or slide out, enabling you to reposition  
the iPad.
Here are two examples of wall mounts:
• 
Slimline 10 Wall Mounted Secure Tablet Enclosure: This enclosure 
enables you to mount an iPad or other tablet securely on the 
wall, either simply to display information or to let users interact 
with the device. The Slimline 10 Wall Mounted Secure Tablet 
Enclosure is from imageHOLDERS Ltd. (www.imageholders.com); 
prices start at $299.99.
• 
FlexStand Series iPad Wall Mount with Adjustable Arm:  
This mount, available from Displays2go (www.displays2go.com), 
enables you to lock an iPad securely in the mount and position it 
using the adjustable arm. The FlexStand costs around $150.
Other Mounts and Stands
Apart from desk mounts and stands, VESA mounts, and wall mounts, you can find various 
other types of mounts and stands for iPads. The following list introduces three types of 
mounts and stands you may need to round out your students’ iPad activities:
• 
Floor: A floor stand can be great for using an iPad for activities 
such as music, art, or delivering presentations. Most floor stands 
are mobile rather than fixed, making them relatively easy to knock 
over, so normally you’d want to use them only for staff members 
or your more responsible students.
• 
Tripod mounts: If your students will use the iPads for shooting 
photos or videos, you may want to get tripod mounts. Most tripod 
mounts are designed for home use rather than industrial use, 
so they simply hold the iPad, usually using tension clips, rather 
than locking the iPad into place. If your iPads wear cases, look for 
tripod mounts that fit over the cases; that way, the iPads will have 
a decent amount of protection.
■
■Tip   Tripod mounts can work as an alternative to floor stands. Even if the tripod looks a 
bit odd in the context, it has the advantage that it’s much harder to knock over than a typical 
floor stand.
• 
Car mounts: You can find various types of car mounts for iPads, 
such as mounts that attach an iPad to the front seat headrest. 
Most of these mounts are aimed at the consumer market, but they 
can come in useful for school trips as well.

Chapter 2 ■ Choosing iPads and Accessories
41
Choosing Hardware Keyboards Where Needed
The iPad’s operating system includes a selection of on-screen keyboards. In many apps, 
the default on-screen keyboard appears automatically when you activate a text field, 
so you can start typing without having to summon the keyboard manually. You can 
also display and hide the on-screen keyboard manually as needed. When the keyboard 
is displayed, you can switch among different available modes, such as letters mode, 
numbers mode, and symbols mode.
Typing on the screen works pretty well for casual typing in the classroom. But if you 
or your students need to enter serious amounts of text on the iPad, you’ll probably want 
to connect hardware keyboards, especially if your students can type well.
You can add hardware keyboards by using three means of connection:
• 
Bluetooth
• 
USB
• 
Smart Keyboard for iPad Pro
The following subsections explain these means of connection and how to choose 
among them.
Pros and Cons of Bluetooth Keyboards for iPads
Bluetooth is normally the most convenient way to connect keyboards to iPads in general. 
You have three main options for Bluetooth keyboards:
• 
General-purpose Bluetooth keyboards: Many general-purpose 
Bluetooth keyboards are compatible with iOS—so if you have 
any Bluetooth keyboards, it’s worth trying them. Once you have 
compatible Bluetooth keyboards, you can move them from one 
iPad to another fairly quickly.
• 
Bluetooth keyboards designed for iPads in general: You can 
find many Bluetooth keyboards designed for use with iPads 
or iPhones. Such keyboards have dedicated keys or key 
combinations for actions such as displaying the Home screen and 
changing the audio volume. These keyboards tend to be a little 
more expensive than general-purpose Bluetooth keyboards, but if 
the extra functionality they offer is helpful (and it usually is), the 
extra expense is easy to justify.
• 
Bluetooth keyboards designed for specific iPad models: Your 
third choice is Bluetooth keyboards designed to fit specific iPad 
models. These keyboards are often built into iPad covers or cases. 
Prices range widely, but normally this is the most expensive type 
of Bluetooth keyboard. Keyboards built into covers or cases can 
be a good solution for any iPad that you plan to use mostly  
(or frequently) as a laptop.

Chapter 2 ■ Choosing iPads and Accessories
42
The first time you connect a Bluetooth keyboard to an iPad, you put the keyboard 
into pairing mode, and then usually you enter a pairing code: the iPad displays the code, 
and you must type it on the keyboard to confirm the pairing. Once you’ve done this, 
you can connect and disconnect the keyboard quickly from the iPad by working on the 
Bluetooth screen in the Settings app. See the section “Connecting and Using Bluetooth 
Devices” in Chapter 3 for detailed instructions.
■
■Caution   Some Bluetooth keyboards don’t require a pairing code when pairing 
the device. This makes pairing quicker and works well for consumers who use a single 
Bluetooth keyboard at a time. But if you’re setting up multiple Bluetooth keyboards, you’ll 
need to double-check which keyboard you’re pairing with which iPad. Unless you keep both 
the keyboards and the iPads carefully labeled, things can become confusing.
Bluetooth keyboards have two main disadvantages in the classroom:
• 
Powering the keyboards: Most Bluetooth keyboards are designed 
to run on battery power to avoid having supposedly unsightly 
cables in the way. This is fine, but you’ll need to keep the 
keyboards recharged. That means plugging them in to a power 
source—usually via a USB cable—every few days, depending on 
how much usage they get.
• 
Identifying which keyboard is linked to which iPad: Unless you label 
your Bluetooth keyboards and iPads clearly, and keep a log of which 
keyboard you’ve connected to which iPad, you may find it hard to 
keep straight which keyboard belongs with which iPad. How hard 
this will be depends on your classroom setup. For example, if you 
have the iPads mounted in stands, and the keyboards secured near 
them, you may find it easy to keep the keyboard and iPad pairs 
straight. But if the iPads and keyboards are free to move and you 
need to put them away at the end of the lesson, the day, or the week, 
you’ll need clear labels to keep each pair together.
Pros and Cons of USB Keyboards for iPads
It’s possible to connect some USB keyboards to the iPad by using a Lightning-to-USB 
connector plugged into the iPad’s Lightning port. The keyboard must be compatible with 
iOS and must not draw too much power. If you connect a keyboard that won't work, the 
iPad displays a dialog telling you that there’s a problem—so if you have a Lightning-to-USB 
connector, you can quickly determine which (if any) of your USB keyboards will work.
Connecting a keyboard via USB can be convenient in a pinch, especially if the iPad 
is yours and the keyboard is one that you find comfortable. A bonus point is that the 
keyboard draws power from the iPad, so you don’t need to worry about powering the 
keyboard separately. But USB isn’t normally a great solution for classroom use because 
the Lightning-to-USB connector is easy to damage or break, even if the iPad is secured in 
a mount or a stand.

Chapter 2 ■ Choosing iPads and Accessories
43
Pros and Cons of Smart Keyboards for iPad Pro Models
For an iPad that has Apple’s Smart Connector, such as the iPad Pro, you can connect a 
keyboard that uses this connector. Apple’s own keyboards with the Smart Connector are 
called Smart Keyboard; other companies make Smart Connector–equipped keyboards 
with different names. These keyboards are relatively expensive, and most are designed fit 
a particular iPad model, so (for example) a Smart Keyboard for a 10.5-inch iPad Pro won’t 
fit a 12.9-inch iPad Pro.
SHOULD YOU GET SMART KEYBOARDS?
Smart Keyboards can be great for the iPad, because they give a convenient way 
to enter text quickly. But you’ll likely find that Smart Keyboards are too expensive 
and too easily damaged for use by students. Another problem is that most Smart 
Keyboards provide only a small amount of protection for the iPad, although some 
companies do make heavier-duty Smart Keyboards.
So you may want to get Smart Keyboards only for iPads that are dedicated to 
teachers—or perhaps only for your own dedicated iPad.
Choosing Storage Locations for iPads
If your iPads will remain at school, or in the classroom, you’ll need to choose a suitable 
storage location for them if they’re not secured in stands or mounts. Because the iPad is 
designed to be a portable device, it’s all too easy for someone to remove an iPad from the 
classroom undetected.
Here are suggestions for storing iPads securely in the classroom or school:
• 
Closet: If the classroom has a lockable closet, placing the iPads 
in it at the end of the lesson or end of the school day may be 
adequate. If the closet includes power outlets, you can plug in 
power adapters to charge the iPads. If you need to charge many 
iPads, you’ll probably want to have an electrician outfit the closet 
with extra power outlets.
• 
iPad cart or tablet cart: You can find a wide variety of carts 
designed to secure iPads or other tablets (or laptops such as 
Chromebooks), charge them, and convey them safely from one 
classroom to another.
• 
iPad charging and syncing cabinet: If the iPads will remain in the 
same classroom, consider a charging and syncing cabinet rather 
than a cart. You can find both cabinets designed specifically for 
iPads and cabinets designed to hold tablets and small laptops. 
One example is the Charge & Sync Cabinet for iPad Air, iPad 
and iPad mini from Kensington (www.kensington.com), which 
provides storage for 10 iPads. You can stack two or three Charge & 
Sync Cabinets on top of each other.

Chapter 2 ■ Choosing iPads and Accessories
44
■
■Note   Another possibility for preventing an iPad from wandering is to use a protective 
case, such as the SecureBack M series from Kensington, that lets you attach a standard 
Kensington locking cable. This can be an effective solution for uses where you need the iPad 
to be freely movable over the short distance that the cable permits, but it still exposes the 
iPad to the risk of being damaged by being knocked over.
Evaluating Apple Pencil for iPad Pro
If you decide to buy iPad Pro models for staff or students, you’ll also need to decide 
whether to get the Apple Pencil to use with them. The Apple Pencil is a stylus that’s 
custom designed for the iPad Pro model; it doesn’t work with non-Pro iPad models or 
with other devices, such as the iPhone. So if you don’t have iPad Pro models, you don’t 
need to worry about the Apple Pencil.
The Apple Pencil enables you to interact with the iPad’s touchscreen much more 
precisely than your finger does. The Apple Pencil detects how hard you’re pressing with the 
point, enabling you to draw lines of different weights by varying the pressure. The Apple 
Pencil also calculates the degree of tilt you’re using, and adds more shading when it detects 
that you’re tilting the stylus further. These features work only with apps that are designed to 
support the Apple Pencil, but by now, a good number of such apps are available.
The Apple Pencil is good for drawing and painting apps, but it’s also good for taking 
notes in handwriting and for adding sketches to notes in apps such as the built-in Notes 
app. You can also use the Apple Pencil to draw on attachments in the Mail app—for 
example, to mark up a document or a contract with changes—or to add signatures to  
PDF files.
In the classroom, the Apple Pencil has some obvious disadvantages:
• 
Cost: The Apple Pencil costs $99.
• 
Vulnerability: The Apple Pencil is easy to break and even easier to 
lose. The iPad Pro models themselves don’t have a silo or holder 
for the Apple Pencil, but some iPad Pro cases do have a silo or 
holder.
• 
Power: The Apple Pencil requires charging, either from the iPad 
or from a Lightning adapter. Charging is simple enough, but it’s 
another task you have to ensure gets performed if you plan to 
have your students use the Apple Pencil with iPad Pros. A full 
charge delivers up to 12 hours of use, but you can also get  
30 minutes of use by charging the Apple Pencil for 15 seconds 
from the iPad Pro.
Armed with this information, you should be able to decide quickly whether you, your 
colleagues, and your students will benefit from having the Apple Pencil with the iPad Pro 
or whether Apple Pencil will prove a strain on your resources and your patience.

Chapter 2 ■ Choosing iPads and Accessories
45
Summary
In this chapter, you’ve learned how to choose the right iPads for your school’s needs, 
how to protect the iPads with cases, screen protectors, or mounts and stands, and how 
to accessorize the iPads with keyboards and the Apple Pencil. You’ve also evaluated your 
options for storing the iPads if you’ll keep them in the school rather than issue them to 
students.
In the next chapter, you’ll learn essential iPad skills for administrators and teachers.

CHAPTER 3
Essential iPad Skills  
for Administrators and 
Teachers
In this chapter, you learn essential skills for using an iPad as an administrator or as a 
teacher. We’ll start with the basics, since there’s little worse than missing some vital 
piece of information that people assume is obvious. We’ll cover how to set up an iPad, 
perform basic power operations, navigate the interface, connect to Wi-Fi networks, and 
so on. Once you know those moves, we’ll look at how to configure an iPad’s essential 
settings manually: Notifications, Do Not Disturb, Restrictions, and Accessibility. 
Toward the end of the chapter, I’ll cover connecting keyboards to the iPad, updating the 
operating system, installing, removing, and organizing apps, and managing both local 
storage and iCloud storage.
Unless you’ve never touched an iPad before, chances are that you already know 
some—or perhaps most—of the material that this chapter covers. But even if you’re 
expert with the iPad, have a quick look through the chapter to dig out any nuggets of extra 
information that will benefit you.
Setting Up an iPad
If you’re unboxing new iPads, or if you power on a used iPad and find it displays the 
Hello screen because it’s been erased, you’ll need to go through the setup routine, which 
includes specifying the country or region, connecting the iPad to a Wi-Fi network, and 
implementing security measures. The following list tells you what you need to do on the 
various setup screens:
• 
Hello screen: Press the Home button to get started. On older 
versions of iOS, you swipe a slider across to get started. The 
prompt tells you—in multiple languages—whether to press the 
Home button or to swipe.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
48
• 
Select Your Country or Region screen: Tap the country or region 
whose format settings you want the iPad to use. Normally, this 
will be the country or region where you’re physically located—
for example, if you’re in the U.S.A., you’d normally want to tap 
the United States item. The country or region sets for format for 
items such as time (for example, 12:34 PM), date (as in Saturday, 
November 4, 2017), and currency (such as $4567.89).
■
■Note   On a cellular iPad, you can also tap the Use Cellular Connection button on the 
Choose a Wi-Fi Network screen to start setting up the iPad via the cellular network rather 
than via Wi-Fi. This capability is occasionally useful, but in general, Wi-Fi is easier.
• 
Choose a Wi-Fi Network screen: On this screen, tap the button for 
the Wi-Fi network you want to connect the iPad to. If the network 
has a password, the Enter Password dialog opens, and you can 
type the password and tap the Join button.
■
■Note   If the Wi-Fi network you want the iPad to join doesn’t appear on the Choose a 
Wi-Fi Network screen, but you believe the network is within range of the iPad, the network 
probably hides its name (more formally, the SSID, which stands for service set identifier) as 
a security measure. To connect to the network, tap the Choose Another Network button. The 
Other Network dialog box opens. Type the network’s name (the SSID) in the Name field, tap 
the Security button to open the Security dialog, tap the appropriate button (such as WPA2 
or WPA2 Enterprise), and then tap the Other Network button to return to the Other Network 
dialog box. Type the password in the Password field, and then tap the Join button.
• 
Location Services screen: Tap the Enable Location Services button 
if you want to allow the Location Services feature to determine the 
iPad’s location by using data from crowd-source Wi-Fi hotspots, 
nearby Bluetooth devices, and (for a cellular iPad) GPS and cell 
tower locations. Tap the Disable Location Services button if you 
don’t want the iPad to use Location Services.
■
■Caution   Disabling Location Services prevents you from using Apple’s Find My iPad 
service to locate the iPad if it goes missing. Unless you secure the iPad physically, being 
able to locate it via Find My iPad is normally helpful.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
49
• 
Touch ID screen: From this screen, you can start registering a 
fingerprint for unlocking the iPad without typing a passcode or 
password. If you’re setting up the iPad for yourself, you’ll likely 
want to set up Touch ID. Tap the Continue button, and then 
follow the prompts to register a fingerprint or a thumbprint. If not, 
tap the Set Up Touch ID Later button instead to skip ahead to the 
Create a Passcode screen.
• 
Create a Passcode screen: On this screen, choose and type a six-
digit passcode that you will use to unlock the iPad. If you didn’t 
set up Touch ID, this passcode is your regular way of unlocking 
the iPad, but even if you did set up Touch ID, you’ll need to enter 
the passcode sometimes, such as after restarting the iPad or 
after not using the iPad for a couple of days. If you prefer to use a 
shorter passcode, longer passcode, or an alphanumeric passcode 
(or password, if you like), tap the Passcode Options button and 
see the nearby sidebar titled “Setting a Custom Passcode.”
■
■Note   If you try to set a passcode that contains an obvious sequence, such as 111111 
or 123456, the iPad displays the Are You Sure You Want to Use This Code? dialog (see 
Figure 3-1). Tap the Change button if you want to change the code to something more 
challenging, or tap the Use Code button if you’re determined to use this code.
Figure 3-1.  The iPad displays the Are You Sure You Want to Use This Code? dialog if you 
try to set an easy-to-guess passcode (such as 987654) or a very short one. Tap the Use Code 
button or the Choose New Code button, as appropriate

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
50
SETTING A CUSTOM PASSCODE
By default, the iPad uses a numeric passcode consisting of six digits—long enough 
for reasonable protection against passcode cracking, but short enough to be easy 
to remember and to type when you unlock the iPad. But if you want, you can set a 
numeric code of a different length or an alphanumeric code instead. On the Create a 
Passcode screen, tap the Passcode Options button to display the pop-up menu, tap 
the appropriate button (see the following list), and then follow the prompts:
•	
Custom Alphanumeric Code: Tap this button to create an 
alphanumeric code or password. You can make this code as short 
as a single character if you override the iPad’s warning that the 
code can be easily guessed.
•	
Custom Numeric Code: Tap this button to create a numeric code of 
a length that you choose. Normally, you’d create a custom numeric 
code so that you can use more numbers and get greater protection 
against the password being cracked, but you can also create a 
shorter numeric password if you so choose. If the code is very short, 
you must override the iPad’s warning that the code can be easily 
guessed.
•	
4-Digit Numeric Code: Tap this button to create a numeric passcode 
that’s only four digits long. This is the passcode length that older 
versions of iOS used by default. Four digits aren’t really enough 
to provide effective security for an iPad that contains sensitive 
personal information, but if your iPads don’t contain personal 
information and can’t access any sensitive data, you may feel that a 
four-digit passcode gives adequate protection.
• 
Apps & Data screen: On this screen (see Figure 3-2), you specify 
the method you will use to complete setup of the iPad. You have 
four choices:
• 
Restore from iCloud Backup: This option enables you to 
restore data to the iPad from a backup on Apple’s iCloud 
service. You can use this option both to restore data that 
you’ve backed up from this particular iPad and to restore 
data from another iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch.
• 
Restore from iTunes Backup: This option enables you to 
restore data to the iPad from a backup created on a Mac or 
PC using iTunes. As with the iCloud backup, this backup 
can be one from this particular iPad or from another iPad, 
iPhone, or iPod touch.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
51
■
■Note   An iTunes backup is much more complete than an iCloud backup—so if you have 
the choice between the two, the iTunes backup is the better choice. But normally the iPad 
will have been backed up to either iCloud or iTunes, not to both.
• 
Set Up as New iPad: This option lets you set up the iPad from 
scratch.
• 
Move Data from Android: This option enables you to transfer 
data, such as your Google account and your photos, from an 
Android phone or tablet. You need to install Apple’s Move 
to iOS app on the Android device. This option is handy for 
consumers switching platforms.
Figure 3-2.  On the Apps & Data screen, choose whether to set up the iPad from scratch or 
to restore data from an iCloud backup or an iTunes backup. You can also transfer some 
data from an Android phone or tablet

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
52
After you tap the Set Up as New iPad button, follow through this sequence of screens 
to complete setup:
• 
Apple ID screen: On this screen, type your Apple ID and the 
corresponding password, and then tap the Next button.
■
■Note   On the Apple ID screen, you can tap the Don’t Have an Apple ID or Forgot It? 
button to either get a new Apple ID or retrieve the details for an Apple ID you’ve forgotten. 
You can also tap the Use Different Apple IDs for iCloud and iTunes button to set up the iPad 
to use a different account for iCloud than for iTunes. On the iCloud screen that appears, 
enter the details of the Apple ID you want to use for iCloud, and tap the Next button. Then, on 
the iTunes screen that appears next, enter the details of the Apple ID to use for iTunes, and 
tap the Next button again.
• 
Terms and Conditions screen: Read the terms and conditions—
or tap the Send by E-mail button to send a copy to yourself via 
e-mail—and then tap the Agree button.
• 
Apple Pay screens: The setup routine encourages you to add a 
payment card for the Apple Pay service. If you want to do so, tap 
the Continue button in iOS 11 or the Next button in iOS 10, and 
follow the prompts to position your card in the frame and have the 
iPad’s camera capture the details or enter the details manually. 
When setting up school iPads, you likely won’t want to set up 
Apple Pay. In iOS 11, you can tap the Set Up Later in Settings 
button on the first Apple Pay screen to skip adding a card for now. 
In iOS 10, the first Apple Pay screen contains only the Next button, 
so—whether or not you want to add a means of payment for the 
Apple Pay service—tap it to reach the second Apple Pay screen, 
where you can tap the Set Up Later in Settings button.
■
■Note   If you don’t add a payment card to Apple Pay, the Finish Setting Up Your iPad 
button appears in the Setting app with a red badge to remind you to set up Apple Pay. Tap 
this button to display the Apple Pay screen, and then tap the Set Up Later in Settings button 
to dismiss this reminder.
• 
iCloud Keychain screen: Tap the Use iCloud Security code button 
to display the iCloud Security Code screen, and then type your 
iCloud security code to enable the iPad to use the passwords 
you’ve stored in iCloud Keychain. If you don’t want to set up 
iCloud Keychain, tap the Don’t Restore Passwords button 
instead, and then tap the Continue button in the Don’t Restore 
Passwords? dialog that opens.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
53
■
■Note   iCloud Keychain is a feature for storing passwords and other sensitive 
information securely in your iCloud account so that you can use that information on all the 
devices and computers that log into your iCloud account.
• 
Siri screen: If you want to set up the Siri voice assistant feature 
now, tap the Turn On Siri button and follow the prompts to teach 
Siri to recognize your voice. If you don’t want to use Siri, tap the 
Turn On Siri Later button instead.
• 
Diagnostics screen: Tap the Send to Apple button if you’re 
prepared to let the iPad send diagnostic information to Apple 
automatically. Otherwise, tap the Don’t Send button.
• 
App Analytics screen: Tap the Share with App Developers button 
if you want to let apps send activity and crash data to Apple for 
Apple to share with the apps’ developers. Otherwise, tap the 
Don’t Share button.
• 
Welcome to iPad screen: Tap the Get Started button to display the 
Home screen and start using the iPad.
Startup, Sleep and Wake, Shutdown, and Restart
Here’s how to perform essential power operations on the iPad:
• 
Start up the iPad: Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button on the 
right side of the top of the iPad for a few seconds. Release the 
button when the Apple logo appears on the screen. When the lock 
screen appears, press the Home button to unlock it using Touch 
ID; if the iPad prompts you to enter your passcode, do so.
• 
Put the iPad to sleep: Press the Sleep/Wake button. The iPad also 
normally puts itself to sleep after several minutes of inactivity.
• 
Wake the iPad from sleep: Press the Home button or the Sleep/
Wake button.
• 
Shut down the iPad: Press and hold the Sleep/Wake button for 
several seconds until the “slide to power off” slider appears on 
the screen (see Figure 3-3). Drag the slider to the right. The iPad 
shuts down.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
54
• 
Restart the iPad: There’s no separate command for restarting the 
iPad, so normally you would shut down the iPad and then start it. 
If the iPad stops responding to the touchscreen, you can perform 
a hard restart by holding down the Sleep/Wake button and the 
Home button simultaneously until the iPad restarts and the Apple 
logo appears on the screen.
Navigating the Interface
This section makes sure you know the essentials of navigating the iPad’s interface: how 
to unlock the iPad, navigate the Home screen pages, and use Notification Center, Control 
Center, and Today View. You’ll see how to launch apps, switch among apps, and close 
apps when necessary, how to search the iPad and beyond using Spotlight Search, and 
how to use the iPad’s multitasking features.
Unlocking the iPad
After starting up, the iPad displays the lock screen. You need to unlock the iPad using 
Touch ID or the passcode before you can use most of the iPad’s features. To unlock the 
iPad using Touch ID, press the Home button with a finger you registered for Touch ID. 
If Touch ID doesn’t work, or if you haven’t registered a finger, pressing the Home button 
displays a keypad on screen. Type your passcode on the keypad to unlock the iPad.
■
■Note   From the lock screen, you can access four apps and features without unlocking 
the iPad. Swipe down from the top of the screen to open Cover Sheet in iOS 11 or 
Notification Center in iOS 10, a screen that shows notifications. Swipe left to access the 
Camera app. Swipe right to access Today View, which provides current information (see 
the section “Using Today View,” later in this chapter, for more information). Swipe up 
from the bottom of the screen to access Control Center, which provides quick access to 
essential controls (see the section “Using Control Center,” also later in this chapter, for more 
information).
Figure 3-3.  To shut down the iPad, press and hold the Sleep/Wake button until the  
“slide to power off” slider appears, and then drag the slider to the right

Navigating the Home Screen Pages
After you unlock the iPad at first, the Home screen appears. The Home screen enables 
you to see some status information about the iPad and to launch apps.
The Home screen is a little different in iOS 11 and iOS 10. Figure 3-4 shows the iOS 11 
Home screen with labels on a Wi-Fi–only iPad. Figure 3-5 shows the iOS 10 Home screen 
on a cellular-and–Wi-Fi iPad.

example, 3) appears to the right of the cellular signal icon.
• 
Wi-Fi: The Wi-Fi symbol shows the approximate strength of the 
Wi-Fi network connection, if there is one.
• 
Clock: The clock shows the time.
• 
Bluetooth icon: The Bluetooth icon appears when the Bluetooth 
communications capability is enabled. Bluetooth provides a 
means of connecting devices such as keyboards, headsets, and 
assistive devices.

• 
Battery percentage: The readout shows the battery’s charge 
percentage, such as 83%. You can disable the battery readout 
by choosing Settings ➤ Battery from the Home screen and then 
setting the Battery Percentage switch to Off.
• 
Battery icon: The battery icon shows the battery’s approximate 
charge status graphically. The icon appears green when the 
battery is charging and white when it’s not charging.
• 
Charging indicator: The charging indicator, a lightning symbol, 
appears when the iPad is connected to power and the battery is 
charging.
• 
Home screen wallpaper: The wallpaper is a graphic that provides 
the backdrop for the Home screen. Each Home screen page shows 
the same wallpaper.
• 
App icons: The app icons enable you to launch apps that aren’t 
running or switch to apps that are running.
• 
Badges: A badge is a red circle or rounded rectangle that appears 
on the upper-right corner of an app icon to indicate that there are 
new items, such as app updates or new e-mail messages.
• 
Home screen dots: These dots, between the main part of the Home 
screen and the Dock, show which of the Home screen pages is 
currently being displayed. The leftmost dot represents Today 
View, which you’ll meet in the section “Using Today View,” a little 
later in this chapter. The second dot represents the first of the 
Home screen pages that show apps and folders. The third dot and 
subsequent dots represent other Home screen pages that contain 
apps and folders. You can create other Home screen pages as 
needed to organize the Home screen. You can swipe left or right on 
a Home screen page to display another page. You can also tap the 
dots, but doing so is a precise movement, and they’re easy to miss.
• 
Dock: The Dock is the area at the bottom of the screen that 
contains a handful of app icons. The Dock stays in place as you 
swipe among the Home screen pages that contain apps and 
folders, giving you quick access to your most-used apps. In iOS 10, 
the Dock appears only on the Home screen, but in iOS 11, you can 
display the Dock from other screens as well by performing a short 
swipe up from the bottom of the screen.
• 
Folder icons: You can create folders that contain multiple app 
icons. Folders are useful for grouping related apps (such as music 
apps or productivity apps) or simply for reducing clutter (such as 
a folder for apps you seldom use).
When the Home screen isn’t displayed, you can press the Home button once to 
display the Home screen page you last used. Press the Home button again to display the 
first Home screen page that shows apps and folders.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
58
■
■Tip   You can change the number of Home screen pages displayed. See the section 
“Installing and Removing Apps and Customizing the Home Screen Pages,” later in this 
chapter, for details.
Using Cover Sheet and Notification Center
iOS includes a feature that displays an overview of the notifications waiting for your 
attention. In iOS 11, this feature is called Cover Sheet, whereas in iOS 10 and earlier iOS 
versions it’s called Notification Center. Apart from the name, there are small differences, 
but Cover Sheet and Notification Center largely work the same way.
You can open Cover Sheet or Notification Center by swiping down from the top of 
the Home screen, the lock screen, or many app screens (some apps block opening Cover 
Sheet or Notification Center). Figure 3-6 shows Cover Sheet in iOS 11.
■
■Tip   You can also open Cover Sheet or Notification Center by swiping left in Today View.
Figure 3-6.  Cover Sheet (in iOS 11) and Notification Center (in iOS 10) give you an 
overview of the notifications awaiting your attention. You can swipe a notification to the 
left to display the View button and the Clear button

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
59
You can take the following actions in Notification Center:
• 
Clear a category of notifications: Tap the X button to the right of a 
category such as Earlier Today or Yesterday.
• 
Clear a notification: Swipe the notification to the left, and then tap 
the Clear button that appears.
• 
View a notification in the app that raised it: Tap the notification. 
You can also swipe the notification left and then tap the View 
button, but this method has no advantage over simply tapping the 
notification.
• 
Search your notifications: In Notification Center, tap the Search 
field at the top of the screen, and then type your search term. As of 
this writing, Cover Sheet doesn’t provide search functionality.
• 
Display Today View: Swipe right on Cover Sheet or Notification 
Center to display Today View.
Using Control Center
Control Center is a feature that provides quick access to some of the most important 
controls. Control Center is substantially different in iOS 11 than in iOS 10, so I’ll cover the 
two iOS versions separately.
Using Control Center in iOS 11
In iOS 11, Control Center consists of a single group of controls that appear on the right 
side of the screen when you swipe up from the bottom of the screen. When you swipe up, 
the Dock appears first; when you swipe further, Control Center appears, together with a 
thumbnail for each app that’s running. Figure 3-7 shows Control Center in iOS 11 with 
labels.
■
■Note   Swiping up from the bottom of the lock screen displays only Control Center, not 
the Dock nor the app thumbnails.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
60
The following list explains the controls in Control Center in iOS 11:
• 
Airplane Mode: Tap this button to enable or disable Airplane 
Mode. Enabling Airplane Mode disables Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and (on 
cellular iPad models) cellular connectivity.
• 
Wi-Fi: Tap this button to enable or disable Wi-Fi.
• 
AirDrop: Tap this button to change the status of AirDrop, the 
feature for quickly transferring files wirelessly between computers 
and devices. In the dialog that opens, tap the Receiving Off button, 
the Contacts Only button, or the Everyone button, as needed.
■
■Note   On a cellular-and–Wi-Fi iPad, the Cellular Data icon appears in place of the 
AirDrop icon. To reach the AirDrop icon, press and hold the Connectivity box until it expands.

Launching Apps
Launching an app is straightforward:
	
1.	
Press the Home button to display the Home screen. The iPad 
displays whichever Home screen page you last used; if this 
isn’t the first Home screen page that contains apps, you can 
press the Home button again to display the first page.
	
2.	
If the app’s icon doesn’t appear on the Home screen page 
you’re currently viewing, swipe left or right until you reach the 
right Home screen page.
	
3.	
Tap the app’s icon.
Switching Among Running Apps
The iPad enables you to switch quickly among running apps by swiping, using the App 
Switcher, or using the Home screen. Swiping and using the Home screen work in the 
same way on iOS 11 and iOS 10, but the App Switcher is substantially different in iOS 11 
than in earlier iOS versions.
Swiping Between Apps
To swipe between apps, swipe left or right with four or five fingers to display the next app 
in that direction. This works only if multitasking gestures are enabled on the iPad; see the 
nearby sidebar “Enabling and Using Multitasking Gestures” for instructions on enabling 
them.
ENABLING AND USING MULTITASKING GESTURES
To enable multitasking gestures, press the Home button, tap the Settings icon, tap 
the General button, and then tap the Multitasking button. On the Multitasking screen, 
set the Gestures switch to On.
Once you’ve done that, you can use these three multitasking gestures:
•	
Display the Home screen: Pinch inward with four or five fingers.
•	
Swipe between apps: Swipe left or right with four or five fingers.
•	
Display the App Switcher: Swipe up with four or five fingers.

Using the App Switcher in iOS 11
Here’s how to use the App Switcher in iOS 11:
	
1.	
Swipe up from the bottom of the screen or double-click  
the Home button. The Dock, Control Center, and the  
App Switcher appear (see Figure 3-13).
	
2.	
If necessary, swipe right to display other app thumbnails.
	
3.	
Tap the thumbnail for the app you want to display.
Figure 3-13.  In iOS 11, the Dock, Control Center, and App Switcher appear together.  
Tap the thumbnail for the app you want to display

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
71
Using the App Switcher in iOS 10
Here’s how you use the App Switcher in iOS 10:
	
1.	
Swipe up from the bottom of the screen with four or five 
fingers, or double-click the Home button. The App Switcher 
screen appears, showing the Home screen and the running 
apps as large thumbnails on a carousel (see Figure 3-14). The 
Home screen appears on the right, with the app you were just 
using immediately to its left, and your previous apps to the left 
of that app.
	
2.	
If necessary, swipe right until you can see the thumbnail for 
the app you want to switch to.
	
3.	
Tap the app’s thumbnail. The app appears, and you can 
resume work in it.
Figure 3-14.  In iOS 10, the App Switcher appears as a carousel of large thumbnails, with 
the Home screen on the right

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
72
Switching Apps via the Home Screen
To switch apps via the Home screen, use the same technique as when launching the app: 
press the Home button to display the Home screen, navigate to the Home screen page 
that contains the app’s icon, and then tap the app’s icon.
Closing an App
On the iPad, you don’t normally need to close apps—you can just leave them running 
until you need them again. iOS manages memory efficiently, automatically reclaiming 
memory from apps that you haven’t used for a while so that there’s enough memory for 
the apps you’re currently using and for other apps that you launch.
However, if an app stops responding, or if you actively want to close it for another 
reason, you can easily do so. Follow these steps:
	
1.	
Display the App Switcher by swiping up from the bottom of 
the screen, using one finger in iOS 11 or four or five fingers in 
iOS 10, or by double-clicking the Home button.
	
2.	
Swipe right until you can see the thumbnail for the app you 
want to close.
	
3.	
Swipe the app up off the App Switcher carousel.
Searching with Search
The iPad’s Search feature enables you to locate information either on the iPad itself or on 
the Internet. You can customize Search to narrow down the results it delivers.
■
■Note   In iOS 11, the search feature’s name is Search, whereas in iOS 10 and earlier 
versions, the search feature’s name is Spotlight Search.
To display the Search field, press the Home button to display the Home screen, and 
then draw your finger a short way down the screen, either on open space or on an icon. 
The Search field appears (see Figure 3-15), together with the Siri App Suggestions box  
(by default) and the keyboard.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
73
Start typing your search term or terms. Results appear you type (see Figure 3-16), 
and you can scroll down if necessary to see more. You can tap a result to display that 
item in an app that can open it, or you can tap the Search Web button, the Search App 
Store button, or the Search Maps button at the bottom of the screen to search in another 
location. Tap the Cancel button if you decide to cancel the search instead.

Suggestions in Look Up: Set this switch to Off if you don’t want the 
Siri Knowledge box to appear when you use the Look Up feature 
(where you tap and hold a word and then tap the Look Up button 
on a command bar to display information about the word).
• 
Apps list: Tap the app you want to affect, and then set the Search 
& Siri Suggestions switch on the resulting screen to On if you want 
the app to appear in search results or to Off if you don’t want it to 
appear.
Figure 3-17.  In iOS 11, set the Suggestions in Search switch and the Suggestions in Look 
Up switch to On or Off, as needed. Then tap the button for each app you want to affect and 
set the Search and Siri Suggestions switch on the resulting screen to On or Off, as needed

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
75
Controlling Where Spotlight Search Searches in iOS 10
To control where Spotlight Search searches in iOS 10, choose Settings ➤ General ➤ 
Spotlight Search and choose settings on the Spotlight Search screen. The following list 
explains your choices:
• 
Siri Suggestions: Set this switch to Off if you don’t want the Siri 
Suggestions box to appear under the Spotlight Search field.
• 
Spotlight Suggestions: Set the Suggestions in Search switch to On 
if you want to see Spotlight’s suggestions when you search; for 
example, the Suggested Website item in Figure 3-17 is a Spotlight 
suggestion. Set the Suggestions in Lookup switch to On if you 
want to see Spotlight suggestions when you give the Look Up 
command to look up a selected word.
• 
Search Results: In this box, set the switch to Off for each app for 
which you don’t want to see Spotlight results.
Multitasking
The iPad enables you to display two apps on screen at the same time, which Apple calls 
multitasking. Most recent iPad models offer three types of multitasking:
• 
Slide Over: Slide Over works differently in iOS 11 from iOS 10:
• 
iOS 11: With an app displayed (not the Home screen), swipe 
up from the bottom of the screen to display the Dock. Tap 
and hold the icon for the app you want to open in Slide Over 
view and then drag upward. When the icon expands (see the 
Messages panel in Figure 3-18), release it, and it moves to the 
right side of the screen in Slide Over view (see Figure 3-19). 
The window is floating, and you can drag it by the top handle 
(the short horizontal gray bar) to the left side of the screen if 
you want.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
76
Figure 3-18.  In iOS 11, swipe up to display the Dock, and then tap and hold the icon for 
the app you want to open and drag it upward. When the icon expands, like the Messages 
icon here, lift your finger

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
77
• 
iOS 10: Swipe left from the right side of the screen to open 
the app you were using previously. Figure 3-20 shows an 
example with the Word app in the main part of the screen, 
dimmed because it’s not active, and the Notes app displayed 
on the right side. To display a different app, swipe down on 
the gray handle at the top of the right pane, and then tap the 
appropriate app in the list of apps that appears.
Figure 3-19.  The app you dragged appears in Slide Over view on the right side of the 
screen

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
78
■
■Note   The key difference between Slide Over and Split View is that Slide Over is 
designed to enable you to work quickly with another app (such as your previous app), 
whereas Split View enables you to work in two apps at the same time.
• 
Split View: After opening the apps you want in Slide Over, you can 
switch them to Split view, dividing the screen between them. In 
iOS 11, drag the top handle (the short horizontal gray bar) down 
a short way, and the Slide Over app switches to Split view. You 
can then drag the handle on the vertical bar, dividing the apps to 
adjust the amount of space each app has. In iOS 10, simply drag 
the handle on the vertical bar dividing the apps left to the middle 
of the screen. Both apps become active, and you can work in either 
app by tapping in it (see Figure 3-21). Drag the handle all the way 
to the left or to the right when you want to return to a single app.
Figure 3-20.  Swipe left from the right side of the screen to display your previous app in 
Slide Over view. You can then change the app by swiping down the handle at the top and 
then tapping the app you want

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
79
■
■Note   Split View is available only with some apps. Apps such as Settings don’t support 
Split View.
■
■Tip   Safari has a couple of shortcuts to Split View, enabling you to view two web pages 
side by side. Open Safari from the Home screen as usual. On the touchscreen, tap and hold 
the Tabs button to display the pop-up menu, and then tap Open Split View to open a new 
Safari window side by side with the existing window. On a hardware keyboard, press Cmd-N 
to open a new window in Split View. When you want to leave Split View, tap and hold the 
Tabs button, and then tap Merge All Tabs on the pop-up menu.
Figure 3-21.  In Split View, both apps are active, and you can work in either of them by 
tapping the app you want to work in

• 
Picture in Picture: The Picture in Picture view enables you to 
switch a video or a FaceTime call from full screen to a small 
window that you can move around the screen and that stays on 
top of other apps you open or activate. For example, you can 
continue watching a video while you activate the Messages app 
and send a message to a contact (see Figure 3-22). To switch 
the video to Picture in Picture, press the Home button while 
it’s playing or tap the Picture in Picture button in its lower-right 
corner. You can then activate another app from the Home screen 
or the App Switcher. When you’re ready to return to the video, 
tap the Picture in Picture window, and then tap the Full Screen 
button in its lower-left corner.
Figure 3-22.  The Picture in Picture view enables you to shrink down a video or a FaceTime 
call to a small window that stays on top of other apps and that you can move around the 
screen as needed

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
81
■
■Note   Depending on the tasks you or your students are trying to perform, multitasking 
can be highly useful. When you’re creating content, the on-screen keyboard takes up about 
half the screen, greatly reducing the amount you can see of each app—often enough to 
make multitasking less efficient than switching back and forth between full-screen apps. 
But if you’re using a hardware keyboard instead of the on-screen keyboard, you can see 
enough of each app to make multitasking effective.
Connecting to Wi-Fi Networks
Normally, you’ll configure a connection to a Wi-Fi network during setup, unless you’re 
setting up a cellular-capable iPad and choose to use the cellular connection instead. 
You can configure other Wi-Fi networks afterward either directly on the iPad or by using 
profiles, as discussed in Chapter 4.
Setting Up Another Wi-Fi Network Manually
To set up a Wi-Fi network manually, you work on the Wi-Fi screen in the Settings app. You 
can connect either to a network that broadcasts its network name or to one that doesn’t. 
The following subsections explain how to connect to each type of network in turn.
UNDERSTANDING SSIDS AND OPEN AND CLOSED WI-FI 
NETWORKS
Each Wi-Fi network has a name that identifies it. The name is formally known as a 
service set identifier, abbreviated to SSID. The name can be up to 32 characters or 
32 bytes long. The characters can include upper- and lowercase letters (including 
spaces), numbers, and symbols (such as underscores or periods). An SSID is case 
sensitive, so School_AP1 is different from SCHOOL_AP1.
Most wireless access points come with default names that identify the device’s 
manufacturer or the company that supplies it. If you’re setting up the Wi-Fi network, 
you’ll do best to give each wireless access point a name that makes sense for 
your school or institution so that staff and students can instantly tell whether a 
particular Wi-Fi network is part of the school or not. Unless your school’s buildings 
are surrounded by open space, it’s likely that some Wi-Fi networks from neighboring 
buildings will reach into your school’s buildings. (Similarly, neighboring buildings 
will be able to see any of your school’s wireless networks that reach beyond its 
grounds.)

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
82
A Wi-Fi network can be either open or closed. An open Wi-Fi network is one that 
broadcasts its SSID for all to see; any Wi-Fi–capable device within range will detect 
the network and can attempt to connect to it. By contrast, a closed Wi-Fi network 
doesn’t broadcast its SSID, and anyone trying to connect a device to it must type in 
the correct SSID on the device.
At first sight, preventing a network from broadcasting its SSID appears a reasonable 
security measure. But because Wi-Fi scanning apps and devices can detect the 
SSID of even a closed network, closing a network works only to deter casual access. 
Anyone with a scanning app (which you can get for free) or device can learn the 
SSID in seconds and can then try to connect to the network. In most cases, it’s best 
to create open Wi-Fi networks and implement effective security rather than create 
closed networks.
If you get to choose the SSIDs for your network, you need to balance several 
conflicting factors:
•	
Readability and clarity: Normally, you’ll want to make the names 
readable (rather than gobbledygook) and their meanings clear. This 
way you’ll be able to tell your colleagues and students clearly which 
networks they’re supposed to be using.
•	
Uniqueness in their context: Each SSID should be unique so 
that users and devices can tell which network they’re trying to 
connect to. Some devices assume that an SSID uniquely identifies 
a network. This assumption enables a malefactor to set up a 
malicious Wi-Fi hotspot that uses the same name and password 
as a genuine hotspot nearby, causing devices to connect to the 
malicious hotspot instead of the genuine one. (The malicious 
hotspot can capture information from the devices that connect to it.)
•	
Security: The Wi-Fi router uses the SSID, together with the security 
method you choose, to encrypt the information it transmits. So, 
technically it’s better to choose a longer and more complex name 
than a short name.
Displaying the Wi-Fi Screen in the Settings App
	
1.	
To get started, choose Settings ➤ Wi-Fi from the Home screen 
to the Wi-Fi screen. Figure 3-23 shows the Wi-Fi screen 
without a connection yet established.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
83
Connecting to an Open Wi-Fi Network
If the Wi-Fi network to which you want to connect the iPad is open (broadcasting its 
SSID), follow these steps to connect:
	
1.	
In the Choose a Network box on the Wi-Fi screen, tap the 
button for the appropriate Wi-Fi network. The Enter Password 
dialog opens (see Figure 3-24).
■
■Note  If the Wi-Fi network has no security set, the iPad connects to the network without 
prompting you for the password.
Figure 3-23.  From the Wi-Fi screen in the Settings app, you can connect the iPad to a  
Wi-Fi network manually

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
84
	
2.	
Type the password in the Password field.
	
3.	
Tap the Join button. The iPad connects to the Wi-Fi network, 
and the network’s name appears both on the Wi-Fi button in 
the left column and on a button at the top of the Wi-Fi screen, 
under the button that contains the Wi-Fi switch.
Checking the IP Address and Configuring Wi-Fi Settings
If the Wi-Fi network uses Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to allocate IP 
addresses and network settings, connecting the iPad to the network as explained in the 
preceding section may be all you need to do. But if you need to check the IP address, 
subnet mask, router address, or DNS server addresses, tap the Information (i) button 
at the right end of the Wi-Fi network’s button to display the Information screen. This 
screen is different in iOS 11 and iOS 11. The following sections explain the iOS versions 
separately.
Checking the IP Address and Configuring Wi-Fi Settings  
on iOS 11
In iOS 11, the IP address information appears in the IPv4 Address box on the Information 
screen (see Figure 3-25). The IP Address button shows the IP address, such as 10.0.0.26; 
the Subnet Mask button shows the subnet mask, such as 255.255.255.0; and the Router 
button shows the address of the router used for the connection, such as 10.0.0.1. You 
can copy any of these details by tapping and holding the appropriate button and then 
tapping the Copy button that appears.
Figure 3-24.  In the Enter Password dialog, type the password for the Wi-Fi network and 
tap the Join button

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
85
■
■Note   On iOS 11, set the Auto-Join switch near the top of the Information screen for a 
Wi-Fi network to On if you want the iPad to join this network automatically in the future.
iOS 11 normally configures Wi-Fi connections to get the IP address and connection 
information automatically from a DHCP server. Getting these details automatically is 
usually the best choice, but if you need to configure the IP details manually or set the iPad 
to use the BootP protocol instead, tap the Configure IP button on the Information screen 
and work on the Configure IPv4 screen (see Figure 3-26). For example, tap the Manual 
button to display the Manual IP box, and then type in the IP address, the subnet mask, 
and the router address.
Figure 3-25.  In iOS 11, look at the IPv4 Address box on a Wi-Fi network’s Information 
screen to see the IP address, subnet mask, and router details

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
86
Configuring DNS Servers for a Wi-Fi Network on iOS 11
If you need to configure DNS servers for this Wi-Fi network, tap the Configure DNS 
button in the DNS box on the Information screen for the Wi-Fi network. On the Configure 
DNS screen (see Figure 3-27), tap the Automatic button or the Manual button, as needed. 
If you tap the Manual button, use the controls in the DNS Servers box to set up the list of 
DNS servers:
• 
Remove a DNS server: Tap the red minus button to the left of the 
server, and then tap the Delete button that appears to the right of 
the server.
• 
Add a DNS server: Tap the Add Server button, and then type its  
IP address or its hostname.
Figure 3-26.  On the Configure IPv4 screen, tap the Automatic button, Manual button, 
or BootP button, as needed, to specify the means of configuration. If you tap the Manual 
button, enter the IP address, subnet mask, and router address in the Manual IP box that 
appears

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
87
If necessary, tap the Add Search Domain button to add a search domain—a domain 
name that you supply to enable iOS to convert host names to fully qualified domain 
names. For example, if you add the search domain notionalacademy.com to the iPad’s 
settings, the iPad’s user can access the staff.notionalacademy.com address by entering 
only staff, with the iPad adding the search domain automatically after the unqualified 
name (staff) fails to return a result.
■
■Note   You can enter multiple search domains, separating one from another with 
commas. iOS uses the search domains in the order in which you enter them, so put the most 
important search domain first.
Tap the Save button when you finish setting up the manual configuration on the 
Configure DNS screen.
Figure 3-27.  On the Configure DNS screen in iOS 11, tap the Automatic button or the 
Manual button, as needed. If you tap the Manual button, configure the DNS servers in the 
DNS Servers box and configure any search domains needed in the Search Domains box

Configuring HTTP Proxy Settings for a Wi-Fi Network on iOS 11
If you need to configure proxy settings, tap the Configure Proxy button in the HTTP Proxy 
box on the Information screen for the Wi-Fi network. On the Configure Proxy screen (see 
Figure 3-28), tap the appropriate button and choose the settings needed:
• 
Off: Tap this button to turn off HTTP proxying. You don’t need to 
do anything more.
• 
Manual: Tap this button to enter the proxy details manually. 
Fields appear for you to enter the details. Type the hostname or 
IP address of the proxy server in the Server field, and then type 
the port (such as 80) in the Port field. If the proxy server requires 
authentication, set the Authentication switch to On and then 
type the username in the Username field and the corresponding 
password in the Password field.
• 
Auto: Tap this button to use automatic proxy configuration via a 
Proxy Auto-Configuration file (PAC file for short). In the URL field, 
type the address at which the iPad will find the PAC file.
Figure 3-28.  On the Configure Proxy screen in iOS 11, tap the Off button, the Manual 
button, or the Automatic button, as needed. If you tap the Manual button, enter the server, 
port, and authentication (if necessary). If you tap the Automatic button, enter the URL for 
the Proxy Auto-Configuration file

Checking the IP Address and Configuring Wi-Fi Settings on 
iOS 10
On iOS 10, the Information screen for a Wi-Fi network has three tabs: the DHCP tab, 
BootP tab, and Static tab. Normally, the DHCP tab (see Figure 3-29) appears first.
On the DHCP tab, you can’t change the IP address, subnet mask, or router, because this 
information is set automatically. However, you can change the DNS server addresses, and 
you can add search domains and a client ID if necessary. Here’s what you need to know:
• 
DNS: Tap this field to make it editable, and then edit the 
existing information or delete it and type new information, as 
needed. Normally, you’ll want to provide the addresses of two 
DNS servers, the primary DNS server and the secondary DNS 
server, separating the two with a comma. You can enter the DNS 
server addresses either as IP addresses (as in the example) or as 
hostnames.
Figure 3-29.  Display the DHCP tab of the Information screen for a Wi-Fi network when 
you want to check the IP address, subnet mask, router address, or DNS server addresses

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
90
• 
Search Domains: A search domain is a domain name that you 
supply to enable iOS to convert host names to fully qualified 
domain names. For example, if you add the search domain 
notionalacademy.com to the iPad’s settings, the iPad’s user can 
access the staff.notionalacademy.com address by entering only 
staff, with the iPad adding the search domain automatically after 
the unqualified name (staff) fails to return a result.
■
■Note   You can enter multiple search domains, separating one from another with 
commas. iOS uses the search domains in the order in which you enter them, so put the most 
important search domain first.
• 
Client ID: Tap this button, and then type the client ID you want 
to assign to the iPad. The client ID is a name that you can use to 
make each iPad easier to identify on the network.
■
■Caution   Search domains can be convenient when connecting iPads (or other 
computers) to your school’s network, but don’t use search domains when connecting to a 
public Wi-Fi network, such as a hotspot. In that case, a search domain might cause the iPad 
or computer to connect accidentally to a computer you didn’t intend to access.
Configuring BootP Settings on iOS 10
Apart from the DHCP tab, the screen for a Wi-Fi network has two other tabs: the BootP 
tab and the Static tab.
BootP is short for Bootstrap Protocol, a protocol for assigning IP addresses 
automatically to network devices. BootP can perform a similar role to DHCP, which is 
newer, but BootP can also direct a client to load an operating system image across the 
network from a server, which DHCP can’t. BootP can communicate with a device only 
while that device is starting, whereas DHCP can communicate with a device both during 
startup and after it.
■
■Note   You can’t use BootP to load an operating system image on an iPad or other iOS 
device across the network.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
91
If your Wi-Fi network uses BootP to provide IP addresses, tap the BootP tab on the 
information screen for the network to view the IP address, subnet mask, router address, 
and DNS server addresses. Figure 3-30 shows the BootP tab of the information screen.
You can make two changes on the BootP tab:
• 
DNS: Tap this field to make it editable, and then edit the existing 
addresses or type new addresses, as necessary. Put the address or 
hostname of the primary DNS server first, followed by a comma 
and the address or hostname of the secondary DNS server.
• 
Search Domains: Tap this field and type in any search domains 
you want the iPad to use.
Figure 3-30.  On the BootP tab Wi-Fi networks:IP Address and configuration, iOS 10: of 
the information screen for a Wi-Fi network, you can see the IP address, subnet mask, router 
address, and DNS server addresses. You can edit the DNS server addresses if necessary; you 
can also add search domains

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
92
Configuring Static IP Settings on iOS 10
Instead of having an iPad get its IP address and network settings from a DHCP server or 
a BootP server, you can set the iPad to use a static IP address and network settings. To do 
so, tap the Static tab on the information screen to display its contents (see Figure 3-31), 
and then type in each piece of information needed:
• 
IP Address: Type the IP address, such as 10.0.0.101 or 
192.168.1.200.
• 
Subnet Mask: Type the subnet mask, such as 255.255.255.0.
• 
Router: Type the IP address or hostname of the router, such as 
10.0.0.1 or wireless1.notionalacademy.com; the hostname can 
be only partially qualified if you include the appropriate search 
domain in the Search Domains field, but usually it’s better to 
include the fully qualified address in the Router field.
• 
DNS: Type the IP address or hostname of the primary DNS server, 
followed by the IP address or hostname of the secondary DNS 
server, separating them with a comma.
• 
Search Domains: Tap this field and type in any search domains 
you want the iPad to use.
Figure 3-31.  On the Static tab of the information screen for a Wi-Fi network, you can set a 
static IP address and other network parameters by typing in the details

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
93
Configuring HTTP Proxy Settings on iOS 10
From the information screen for a Wi-Fi network, you can also configure HTTP proxy 
settings for the iPad. You can either specify the proxy settings manually or enter a URL 
from which the iPad can automatically pick up proxy settings.
In the HTTP Proxy section of the information screen, tap the appropriate tab button 
and enter such information as is needed:
• 
Off: Tap this tab button to turn off HTTP proxying. As you’d 
imagine, you don’t need to enter any information.
• 
Manual: Tap this tab button to use manual proxy setup. In the 
Server field (see Figure 3-32), type the hostname or IP address 
of the proxy server, and then type the port (such as 80) in the 
Port field. If the proxy server requires authentication, set the 
Authentication switch to On and then type the username in 
the Username field and the corresponding password in the 
Password field.
• 
Auto: Tap this tab button to use automatic proxy configuration 
via a Proxy Auto-Configuration file (PAC file for short). In the URL 
field (see Figure 3-33), type the address at which the iPad will find 
the PAC file.
Figure 3-32.  To specify proxy settings manually, tap the Manual tab button in the HTTP 
Proxy section of the information screen for the appropriate Wi-Fi network, and then type in 
the information needed

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
94
SETTING PROXY EXCEPTIONS FOR THE IPAD
For some network configurations, you may need to set proxy exceptions—addresses 
for which the iPad shouldn’t use the proxy server.
The iPad’s interface doesn’t give you a way to create proxy exceptions, so you need 
to set the iPad to use Auto proxy configuration and point it to a PAC file that contains 
the exceptions along with the other proxy settings.
Connecting and Using Bluetooth Devices
The iPad includes full Bluetooth functionality, enabling you to connect a wide range of 
Bluetooth devices. For example, you can connect a Bluetooth keyboard to input data, a 
Bluetooth speaker or headset to output data, or a Bluetooth assistive device to provide 
enhanced accessibility for the iPad.
The first time you connect a Bluetooth device, you must pair it with the iPad. After 
you’ve paired the device, you can connect it quickly.
Pairing a Bluetooth Device
Follow these general steps to set up a Bluetooth device:
	
1.	
Turn on the Bluetooth device and put it in pairing mode. How 
you do this depends on the device, but it often involves either 
pressing a dedicated key or a sustained press (such as 10 
seconds) on the master control key.
	
2.	
From the Home screen, choose Settings ➤ Bluetooth to 
display the Bluetooth screen.
	
3.	
Make sure the Bluetooth switch is set to On. The iPad scans for 
Bluetooth devices, and the Devices list shows those it has found 
(see Figure 3-34). This example uses a Bluetooth speaker.
Figure 3-33.  To set the iPad to use automatic proxy configuration, tap the Auto tab button 
in the HTTP Proxy section of the information screen, and then enter the URL at which to 
find the PAC file

the My Devices list on the Bluetooth screen to display the Info screen for the device  
(see Figure 3-36). You can then tap the Disconnect button to disconnect the device.
When you need to reconnect the device, make sure the device is powered on, and 
then tap its button in the My Devices list on the Bluetooth screen.
Forgetting a Bluetooth Device
When you no longer need to use a particular Bluetooth device with an iPad, tell the iPad 
to forget the device. To do so, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Tap the Info (i) icon on the device’s button in the My Devices 
list on the Bluetooth screen to display the Info screen for the 
device.
	
2.	
Tap the Forget This Device button. The Forget dialog opens.
	
3.	
Tap the OK button.
Using AirPlay Mirroring
iOS includes a feature called AirPlay Mirroring that enables you to show what’s 
happening on the iPad’s screen on another device, such as the monitor or TV connected 
to an Apple TV device. AirPlay Mirroring is a popular feature among consumers for 
sharing content, but it can be great for classroom usage as well.
To use AirPlay Mirroring, follow these general steps:
	
1.	
Connect the Apple TV to the TV or monitor via HDMI.
	
2.	
Power on the Apple TV and the TV or monitor.
	
3.	
On the iPad, open the content you want to display. For 
example, open a document that you want to share with others.

open the Screen Mirroring dialog or the AirPlay dialog again, and then tap the Stop 
Mirroring button in iOS 11 or the Turn Off AirPlay Mirroring button in iOS 10.
Transferring Files Using AirDrop
iOS and macOS include a feature called AirDrop that lets you transfer files easily between 
iOS devices and Macs. AirDrop is widely viewed as a consumer-oriented feature, but it also 
works well in the classroom when you need to share files with specific iPads (or their users).
Figure 3-37.  To mirror the iPad’s screen, open Control Center. In iOS 11, tap the Screen 
Mirroring button to open the Screen Mirroring dialog (left); in iOS 10, tap the AirPlay

3.	
In the “Tap to share with AirDrop” area, tap the iOS device or 
Mac you want to send the file to.
	
4.	
If the user of the iOS device or Mac accepts the file, AirDrop 
transfers it. The readout Sent then appears on the recipient’s 
icon in the Tap to share with AirDrop area.
	
5.	
If necessary, tap another icon to send the same file to another 
iPad or Mac. Otherwise, tap outside the Share sheet.
When someone sends you a file, the AirDrop dialog opens (see Figure 3-41), 
telling you the sender’s name and the item type. Tap the Accept or Decline button, as 
appropriate. If you accept the file, the iPad opens it in the default app for that file type 
(assuming there is a default app).
Sending and Receiving Files from a Mac Using AirDrop
To send a file from a Mac using AirDrop, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open a Finder window to the AirDrop folder.
	
2.

Configuring Notifications
The iPad can notify its user about many different types of events, such as incoming 
messages, fresh news stories, and reminders. You can control which apps can raise 
notifications and the style of notifications they can raise. You’ll likely want to configure 
the Notifications settings to make sure your students aren’t distracted by a barrage of 
irrelevant notifications.
	
1.	
To configure Notifications settings, first display the 
Notifications screen (see Figure 3-42) by choosing Settings 
➤ Notifications from the Home screen.
In iOS 11, the Show Previews button appears at the top of the Notifications screen, 
enabling you to choose an overall setting for previews of notifications; you can then 
choose a different preview setting for individual apps as needed. (iOS 10 doesn’t have this 
setting.) Tap the Show Previews button to display the Show Previews screen, and then tap 
the appropriate button:
• 
Always: Tap this button to show previews whether the iPad is 
locked or not.
• 
When Unlocked: Tap this button to show previews when the iPad 
is unlocked but not when it’s locked.
• 
Never: Tap this button to not show previews at all.
Figure 3-42.  From the Notifications screen, you can control which apps can raise 
notifications and which types of notifications they can raise. On iOS 11, you can choose 
whether to show previews of notifications

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
102
Next, tap the button for the app whose notifications you want to configure. The 
screen for the app appears, such as the Messages screen (see Figure 3-43) for the 
Messages app. The contents of these screens vary depending on the app’s features 
and capabilities, but the principles are the same; there are also some small differences 
between iOS 11 and iOS 10. These are the settings you can normally configure:
• 
Allow Notifications: Set this switch to Off if you want to prevent 
the app from raising notifications. All the other controls on the 
app’s screen disappear when you do this, so you can skip the rest 
of the list.
• 
Show in Notification Center: [iOS 10 only] Set this switch to On to 
have this app’s notifications appear in Notification Center.
• 
Sounds: Tap this button to display the Sounds screen, and then 
tap the sound the iPad should play to announce a notification for 
this app. Setting different sounds for different apps can help you 
identify important notifications aurally on your own iPad. For 
classroom use, you’ll often want to choose None on the Sounds 
screen.
■
■Note   Some apps have a Sounds switch rather than a Sounds button. Set the Sounds 
switch to Off if you want to suppress sounds.
• 
Badge App Icon: Set this switch to On if you want the app’s icon to 
display a badge (the red circle or rounded rectangle) showing the 
number of new notifications. Set this switch to Off if you want to 
remove this potential distraction.
• 
Show on Cover Sheet: [iOS 11 only] Set this switch to On if you 
want the app’s notifications to be included on Cover Sheet, the 
screen that shows a list of notifications.
• 
Show in History: [iOS 11 only] Set this switch to On if you want 
the app’s notifications to be included in History, the list of older 
notifications.
• 
Show as Banners: [iOS 11 only] Set this switch to On if you want 
to use either persistent banners or temporary banners (see the 
nearby sidebar, “Understanding the Different Alert Types,” for an 
explanation of these banners). Then tap the Temporary icon or 
the Persistent icon to specify the banner type.
• 
Show on Lock Screen: [iOS 10 only] Set this switch to On if you 
want the app’s notifications to appear on the lock screen.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
103
• 
Alert Style When Unlocked: [iOS 10 only] In this area, choose the 
type of notification for the app: None, Banners, or Alerts. See the 
nearby sidebar, “Understanding the Different Alert Types,” for an 
explanation of banners and alerts.
UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENT ALERT TYPES
iOS offers two different types of alerts, but iOS 11 uses different names for the types 
than iOS 10 uses. These are the two alert types:
•	
Persistent banner (iOS 11), Alert (iOS 10): This is a panel that appears 
at the top of the screen and remains there until you dismiss it.
•	
Temporary banner (iOS 11), Banner (iOS 10): This is a panel that 
appears at the top of the screen for a few seconds and then 
disappears automatically.
Normally, you’ll want to use persistent banners (iOS 11) or alerts (iOS 10) only for 
notifications that are vital for the user see in real time.
• 
Options box: In this box, tap each button and choose settings 
as appropriate. The contents of this box vary depending on 
the app. For example, the Messages Options box contains the 
Show Previews button, which lets you control whether message 
previews appear (the settings are Always, When Unlocked, and 
Off), and the Repeat Alerts button, which lets you control how 
many times an alert reappears—at two-minute intervals—before 
iOS automatically suppresses it if the user doesn’t.

Configuring Do Not Disturb
The Do Not Disturb feature enables you to specify times when incoming calls and 
messages are silenced. You can run Do Not Disturb on a schedule, which is good for  
day-to-day use, but you can also enable the feature manually any time you need it.
To configure Do Not Disturb, choose Settings ➤ Do Not Disturb from the Home 
screen. You can then configure the following settings on the Do Not Disturb screen 
(see Figure 3-44):
• 
Manual: Set this switch to On to enable Do Not Disturb. Normally, 
it’s easiest to tap the Do Not Disturb icon on the iPad Controls 
card in Control Center.
• 
Scheduled: To run Do Not Disturb on a schedule, set this switch 
to On. Tap the From/To button to display the Quiet Hours dialog. 
Tap the From button and set the time dials to the appropriate 
hour and minute for the starting time, then tap the To button and 
set the time dials for the ending time.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
105
• 
Allow Calls From: To specify who (if anyone) can call when 
Do Not Disturb is on, tap this button to display the Allow Calls 
From screen, and then tap the appropriate button: Everyone, 
No One, All Contacts, or a particular group of contacts (such as 
Colleagues).
• 
Repeated Calls: Set this switch to On if you want a second 
FaceTime call from the same person within three minutes to 
ring through. Normally, you’ll want to set this switch to Off. This 
setting is more useful on the iPhone, where you’re more likely to 
receive important calls when Do Not Disturb is on.
• 
Silence: In this box, tap the Always button if you want Do Not 
Disturb to be enforced whether the iPad is locked or not. Tap the 
“Only while iPad is locked” button if you’ll allow interruptions 
when Do Not Disturb is on but the iPad is unlocked (and 
presumably in use).
Figure 3-44.  You can configure the Do Not Disturb feature to run on a schedule or enable 
it manually as needed

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
106
Setting Restrictions on What Users Can Do
iOS provides an extensive range of settings for restricting actions a user can take with 
an iPad. For example, you can prevent a user from using the camera, or allow use of 
the camera but disable FaceTime. You can prevent the user from installing or deleting 
apps or making in-app purchases, and you can lock down privacy settings. You create a 
Restrictions Passcode to prevent unauthorized changes to the restrictions.
To make the most of your school’s deployment of iPads, you’ll almost certainly want 
to understand the options available to you and—most likely—implement at least some 
of them.
Displaying the Restrictions Screen and Setting a 
Restrictions Passcode
To display the Restrictions screen, choose Settings ➤ General ➤ Restrictions from the 
Home screen. Until you enable restrictions, you can access the Restrictions screen 
without having to set or enter a restrictions passcode.
At first, the Restrictions screen appears, as shown in Figure 3-45, with the 
Enable Restrictions button at the top and the switches and buttons for the individual 
restrictions dimmed and unavailable. To get started, tap the Enable Restrictions button 
and then type the Restrictions Passcode—a new passcode you’re creating to protect 
the restrictions—in the Set Passcode dialog that opens. As usual, the Set Passcode 
dialog prompts you to re-enter the Restrictions Passcode to make sure you’ve typed the 
passcode you intended to type.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
107
Figure 3-45.  On the Restrictions screen in the Settings app, tap the Enable Restrictions 
button, and then create your Restrictions Passcode in the Set Passcode dialog that opens
Understanding and Applying Restrictions
Once you’ve set your Restrictions Passcode, the Restrictions screen appears again, now 
with all the switches and buttons enabled. You can then set the following restrictions in 
the Allow section at the top of the Restrictions screen:
• 
Safari: Set this switch to Off if you want to prevent the user from 
using Safari—for example, if you want to prevent the user from 
browsing the web or intend for the user to browse with a different 
browser.
• 
Camera: Set this switch to Off to prevent the user from using 
the Camera feature, either for taking photos and videos or for 
FaceTime and similar apps.
■
■Note   Setting the Camera switch on the Restrictions screen to Off sets the FaceTime 
switch to Off—but it doesn’t do so immediately, as of this writing—it only makes the 
change after you leave the Restrictions screen.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
108
• 
Siri & Dictation: Set this switch to Off to disable the Siri assistant 
and the Dictation feature.

AirDrop: Set this switch to Off to disable the AirDrop feature, 
which provides an easy way to transfer files among iOS devices 
and Macs.
• 
iTunes Store: Set this switch to Off to disable the iTunes Store app, 
which sells music, movies, TV shows, and other media content.
• 
Music Profiles & Posts (iOS 11), Apple Music Connect (iOS 10): 
Set this switch to Off to disable the Connect feature in the Music 
app. Connect is a feature intended to help artists and their fans 
connect with each other, but as of this writing, Apple appears to 
be phasing out Connect.
• 
iBooks Store: Set this switch to Off to disable the iBooks Store app, 
which sells e-books (and provides some e-books for free).
• 
Podcasts: Set this switch to Off to disable the Podcasts app, 
which lets the user stream, download, and play audio and video 
podcasts on a wide variety of topics.
• 
News: Set this switch to Off to disable the News app, which allows 
the user to read news stories from a range of sources.
• 
Installing Apps: Set this switch to Off to prevent the user from 
installing apps from the App Store. Setting this switch to Off hides 
the App Store app in the iPad’s interface.
• 
Deleting Apps: Set this switch to Off to prevent the user from 
deleting apps from the iPad.
• 
In-App Purchases: Set this switch to Off to prevent the user from 
making purchases within apps.
In the Allowed Content section of the Restrictions screen, you can set switches to On 
or Off to enable or disable the following apps and features:
• 
Ratings For: Tap this button to display the Ratings For screen, and 
then tap the country or region whose ratings you want to use—for 
example, United States, Canada, or United Kingdom.
• 
Music, Podcasts & News: Tap this button to display the Music, 
Podcasts & News screen, and then set the Explicit switch to On or 
Off, as needed.
•

Choosing Accessibility Settings
iOS includes an impressive suite of accessibility settings designed to make the iPad, 
iPhone, and iPod touch easier to use for people who suffer from problems with vision, 
hearing, interaction and touch, or learning. Chances are, some of your students will 
benefit from some of the accessibility settings—which means you’ll have to know about 
all the accessibility settings so that you can apply the ones the students need.
Displaying the Accessibility Screen
To display the Accessibility screen, choose Settings ➤ General ➤ Accessibility from 
the Home screen. Figure 3-53 shows the upper part of the Accessibility screen, which 
contains the Vision category and the Interaction category.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
117
Figure 3-53.  The upper part of the Accessibility screen contains the Vision category and the 
Interaction category
Configuring the VoiceOver Feature
The VoiceOver feature lets you have iOS speak the names of items on the screen, enabling 
those with vision problems to navigate the interface. With VoiceOver enabled, iOS’s basic 
behavior changes: instead of tapping an item to activate it, you tap the item to select it, 
which makes VoiceOver place the cursor (a black line) around the item and announce the 
item’s name. You then double-tap the selected item to activate it. To scroll with VoiceOver 
activated, you swipe with three fingers.
To enable VoiceOver, tap the VoiceOver button in the Vision box on the Accessibility 
screen. Then, on the VoiceOver screen (see Figure 3-54), set the VoiceOver switch at the 
top to On. If a confirmation dialog opens, tap the OK button to select it, and then double-
tap the OK button to activate it. Then tap and double-tap the VoiceOver Practice button 
to display the VoiceOver Practice screen, where you can practice VoiceOver gestures until 
you get the hang of them. Tap and then double-tap the Done button when you finish.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
119
■
■Tip   If you’re exploring the VoiceOver settings rather than configuring them for actual 
use, don’t set the VoiceOver switch to On yet. Instead, explore the settings using regular iOS 
gestures and without having VoiceOver announce every item you touch.
Apart from the VoiceOver switch and the VoiceOver Practice button, these are the 
settings you can configure for VoiceOver:
• 
Speaking Rate: Drag this slider to set the rate at which VoiceOver 
speaks its announcements.
• 
Speech: On iOS 11, tap this button to display the Speech screen. 
Here, you can tap the Voice button and choose the voice for 
VoiceOver to use; a few voices are preinstalled, but you can 
download plenty of others. You can tap the Pronunciations 
button to display the Pronunciations screen, which lets you set up 
custom pronunciations—or substitutions—of individual words 
and terms. You can drag the Pitch slider to change the pitch of the 
voice. And you can set the Use Pitch Change switch to On if you 
want VoiceOver to change the pitch of its voice when reading a list 
of items, using a higher pitch for the first item and a lower pitch 
for the last item as an aural clue; set this switch to Off if you prefer 
to have VoiceOver use a constant pitch.
■
■Note   In iOS 10, the Use Pitch Change switch is on the VoiceOver screen, not on the 
Speech screen.
• 
Verbosity: Tap this button to display the Verbosity screen, where 
you can choose which items you want VoiceOver to speak. For 
example, you can set the Speak Hints switch to On or Off, as 
needed; hints are often helpful at first, but you’ll likely want to 
turn them off after a while. Set the Emoji Suffix switch to On if you 
want VoiceOver to add the word “emoji” after an emoji character 
it reads as text.
• 
Braille: Tap this button to display the Braille screen  
(see Figure 3-55), where you can configure settings for using a 
Braille display with the iPad.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
120

• 
Audio: Tap this button to display the Audio screen. Here, you 
can set the Use Sound Effects switch to On or Off, as needed, to 
control whether the iPad plays sound effects as usual; you may 
want to switch off sound effects to avoid them making VoiceOver 
hard to hear. You can also set the Audio Ducking switch to On or 
Off to control whether the iPad ducks (reduces the volume of) any 
audio playing when VoiceOver speaks. Usually, ducking is helpful.
• 
Rotor: Tap this button to display the Rotor screen, which you use 
to configure the Rotor, a quick-access control for settings you 
want to be able to access with a gesture when VoiceOver is turned 
on. You display the Rotor (see Figure 3-56) by placing two fingers 
on the screen and rotating them clockwise or counterclockwise; 
VoiceOver announces the name of the item the Rotor is pointing 
to, and the item’s name appears above the dial. The Rotor screen 
in Settings (see Figure 3-57) enables you to choose which items 
appear on the Rotor and drag them into the order in which you 
want them to appear.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers

• 
Typing Style: Tap this button to display the Typing Style screen, 
and then tap the Standard Typing button, the Touch Typing 
button, or the Direct Touch Typing button to specify the typing 
style. With the Touch Typing setting, you type a character by 
pressing its key as usual, except that VoiceOver puts a black 
selection outline around the key when you tap it. With the Direct 
Touch Typing setting, you tap the key to select it, and then 
double-tap the key to type the character.
• 
Phonetic Feedback: Tap this button to display the Phonetic 
Feedback screen, and then tap the Off button, the Character and 
Phonetics button, or the Phonetics Only button. For example, 
when you select the F key with the Character and Phonetics 
setting, VoiceOver announces “F, Foxtrot”; with the Phonetics 
Only setting, VoiceOver announces “Foxtrot” without the letter.
• 
Typing Feedback: Tap this button to display the Typing Feedback 
screen, and then choose the feedback you want for on-screen 
keyboards in the Software Keyboards box. Your choices are 
Nothing, Characters, Words, or Characters and Words. Then go 
to the Hardware Keyboards box and choose what feedback you 
want—again, Nothing, Characters, Words, or Characters and 
Words—for hardware keyboards you attach to the iPad.
■
■Note   A user who can touch-type typically won’t need either the Characters setting or 
the Characters and Words setting for a hardware keyboard. Usually, the Words setting gives 
the best balance between confirming that the user’s typing is accurate and allowing a fair 
rate of progress.
• 
Modifier Keys: Tap this button to display the Modifier Keys screen, 
and then tap the button for the modifier keys the user will press 
on a hardware keyboard to activate VoiceOver key commands. 
The choice is between using the Caps Lock key on its own and 
using the Control and Option keys together. On most keyboards, 
the Alt key has the same effect as the Option key on a Mac 
keyboard.
• 
Always Speak Notifications: Set this switch to On if you want 
VoiceOver to announce all notifications. Doing so can be helpful 
but may prove overkill.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
123
• 
Navigate Images: Tap this button to display the Navigate Images 
screen, and then tap the Always button, the With Descriptions 
button, or the Never button to control whether and how 
VoiceOver announces images. The Always setting makes 
VoiceOver announce every image, whereas the With Descriptions 
button makes VoiceOver announce only those images that have 
an alternative text description.
• 
Large Cursor: Set this switch to on to have the cursor (the 
selection outline) appear as a thick black line instead of a thin 
black line.
• 
Double-tap Timeout: Tap this button to display the Double-tap 
Timeout screen, and then tap the + and – buttons as needed to 
adjust the timeout. This is the length of time you have to tap twice 
for VoiceOver to register a double-tap. Increase the timeout if 
your double-taps aren’t registering, or decrease the timeout if 
VoiceOver is reading two single taps as a double-tap.
Configuring the Zoom Feature
The Zoom feature enables you to magnify either the entire screen or a part of it so that 
you can see items more clearly. You can configure various zoom settings, including 
setting the maximum zoom level and choosing whether to display the Zoom Controller 
tool that provides quick access to zoom commands.
To get started, display the Zoom screen (see Figure 3-58) by tapping the Zoom button 
in the Vision box on the Accessibility screen in Settings. You can then configure the 
following settings:
• 
Zoom: Set this switch to On to enable the Zoom feature. When 
you do this, the whole screen zooms in if you have set the Zoom 
Region setting to Full Screen Zoom. If you have set the Zoom 
Region setting to Window Zoom, the Lens appears. The Lens is the 
rounded rectangle you see in the lower-left corner of Figure 3-58. 
You move the Lens either by dragging it by its frame or the handle 
(the jellybean-shaped button at the bottom), or by using the Zoom 
Controller, which you’ll meet in a moment.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
124
• 
Follow Focus: Set this switch to On if you want the Lens to 
automatically follow the text you type so you can see what’s 
happening.
• 
Smart Typing: Set this switch to On to make the Zoom feature 
switch automatically to Window Zoom when the keyboard 
appears on screen. The Zoom feature positions the Lens so that 
the active text is zoomed rather than the keyboard being zoomed.
• 
Show Controller: Set this switch to On to display the Zoom 
Controller, the gray circle containing a white dot and four arrow 
buttons pointing up, down, left, and right. With the Zoom 
Controller displayed, you tap it and then drag the white dot in the 
direction you want to pan the zoom, as if the dot were a joystick. 
You can reposition the Zoom Controller by tapping and holding it 
until it expands and then dragging it.
Figure 3-58.  On the Zoom screen in the Settings app, you can enable or disable the Zoom 
feature and configure its settings. In this example, the Lens appears in the lower-left corner 
of the screen, and the Zoom Controller appears on the right side

and then tap the Full Screen Zoom button or the Window Zoom 
button to specify which type of zoom you want to use.
• 
Zoom Filter: If you want to apply a color filter to the zoomed area, tap 
this button to display the Zoom Filter screen, and then tap the filter 
you want: Inverted, Grayscale, Grayscale Inverted, or Low Light.
• 
Maximum Zoom Level: Drag this slider to set the maximum zoom 
level you want to use.
Using Zoom Shortcuts
Once you’ve configured the settings you want for the Zoom feature, you can simply 
leave Zoom turned on and pan either the entire screen or the Lens by swiping with three 
fingers. But you may also benefit from these three moves:
• 
Toggle zoom on or off: Double-tap with three fingers anywhere on 
the screen.
• 
Change the zoom level: Double-tap with three fingers in the 
zoomed area and, on the second tap, draw your fingers up the 
screen to zoom in or down the screen to zoom out.
• 
Display the Zoom dialog: Tap the Zoom Controller or triple-tap 
the screen with three fingers to display the Zoom dialog  
(see Figure 3-59), which contains commands for zooming in or 
out, switching between Full Screen Zoom and Window Zoom, 
resizing the Lens, choosing a Zoom Filter, and showing or hiding 
the Zoom Controller. You can also drag the slider at the bottom of 
the Zoom dialog to adjust the zoom level.

127
Once you’ve enabled Magnifier, you can invoke it at any point by triple-clicking the 
Home button and then tapping the Magnifier button in the Accessibility Shortcuts dialog 
(see Figure 3-61).
Configuring Display Accommodations
The display accommodations in iOS enable you to change the screen’s colors to make 
them easier to view. You can invert the screen’s colors, apply color filters designed to help 
different types of color blindness, and reduce the screen’s white point to make bright 
colors appear less intense.
To get started, tap the Display Accommodations button in the Vision box on the 
Accessibility screen. The Display Accommodations screen appears (see Figure 3-62), 
where you can choose the following three settings:
• 
Invert Colors: In iOS 11, tap this button to display the Invert Colors 
screen. Here, you can set the Smart Invert switch to On to invert 
each color—changing white to black, the blue selection highlight 
to rusty orange, and the green switch color to lazy magenta—for 
all objects except images, other media, and some apps that use 
dark color styles. Alternatively, you can set the Classic Invert 
switch to On to invert all the colors on the screen, not sparing 
images, media, or dark-themed apps.
■
■Note   Inverting the colors can make the screen easier to view in certain lighting 
conditions. You may also find that some students simply like the inverted effect, which 
is reminiscent of early versions of Android before Google beefed up its graphical design 
department.
Figure 3-61.  You can enable and disable Magnifier quickly by triple-clicking the Home 
button and then tapping the Magnifier button in the Accessibility Shortcuts dialog

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers

screen. This switch has the same effect as the Classic Invert switch in iOS 11. iOS 10 
doesn’t have the Smart Invert feature.
• 
Color Filters: Tap this button to display the Color Filters screen 
(see Figure 3-63). Set the Color Filters switch to On, and then tap 
the filter you want to apply: Grayscale, Red/Green Filter, Green/
Red Filter, Blue/Yellow Filter, or Color Tint. For any color filter 
except Grayscale, drag the Intensity slider left or right to adjust the 
intensity. For the Color Tint filter, drag the Hue slider left or right 
to tweak the hue.

Configuring Larger Text and Bold Text
To make the screen easier to read, iOS enables you to change the size of Dynamic Type—
type with size that’s changeable rather than fixed. You can also apply bold text throughout 
the operating system; doing so requires the iPad to restart.
To change the size of Dynamic Type, tap the Larger Text button on the Accessibility 
screen. On the Larger Text screen that appears, set the Larger Accessibility Sizes switch to 
On, and then drag the slider to adjust the size of the type.
To turn on bold text, set the Bold Text switch on the Accessibility screen to On, then 
tap the Continue button in the Applying this setting will restart your iPad dialog.
Displaying Button Shapes
iOS enables you to display the shapes of buttons that otherwise appear only as text and 
arrows, such as the navigation buttons that appear in the upper-left corner of the right 
pane in the Settings app. Set the Button Shapes switch on the Accessibility screen to On if 
you want the buttons to appear as shaded shapes, as you see with the General button at 
the top of Figure 3-64.
Increasing Contrast and Reducing Motion
To make the iPad’s screen easier to read, you can increase the contrast. Tap the Increase 
Contrast button on the Accessibility screen to display the Increase Contrast screen, and 
then set the Reduce Transparency switch and the Darken Colors switch to On.

Displaying On/Off Labels on Switches
The switches in iOS are generally easy to understand—green for On, and white for Off. 
But you can display On/Off labels to make the switches even clearer. To do so, set the On/
Off Labels switch on the Accessibility screen to On. Each switch then shows I when it’s on 
and O when it’s off, as you see on the switches in Figure 3-64.
Choosing Interaction Settings for Accessibility
The Interaction section of the Accessibility screen (see Figure 3-65) enables you 
to configure the Switch Control feature, the AssistiveTouch feature, the Touch 
Accommodations feature, keyboard settings, the Shake to Undo feature, how to route 
audio calls, and how the Home button responds to clicks and presses.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
132
Configuring the Switch Control Feature
The Switch Control feature enables you to use a switch to control the iPad. This feature 
is designed to help users with physical impairments or motor-skills impairments to use 
iPads. Switch Control works by the iPad highlighting each available option on screen in 
turn so that the user can use the switch to select the right option when it’s highlighted. 
iOS enables you to create recipes—sequences of actions similar to macros—for controlling 
switches.
For Switch Control, you can use three types of devices:
• 
External switch: You connect a physical switch device to the iPad, 
either via Bluetooth or via the Lightning port. This switch device 
can have either a single switch or multiple switches.
• 
iPad screen: You can tap anywhere on the iPad’s screen to trigger 
the switch.
• 
iPad camera: You can set the iPad’s screen-side camera to trigger 
the switch when it detects head movement to the left or to the right.
You can use a single type of device or combine multiple types of devices, as needed.

Configuring Keyboard Settings for Accessibility
iOS offers several accessibility settings for hardware keyboards you connect to the iPad. 
You can adjust the rate at which keys repeat when held down, enable the Sticky Keys 
feature for setting a modifier key so you don’t have to keep holding it down for a keyboard 
shortcut, and enable the Slow Keys feature to adjust the length of time between when you 
press a key and the iPad registers the keypress. You can also choose whether to display 
lowercase letters on the on-screen keyboard or keep it uppercase all the time.
To configure keyboard settings, tap the Keyboard button on the Accessibility screen. 
On the Keyboard screen that appears (see Figure 3-81), you can then configure the 
following settings:
• 
Show Lowercase Keys: Set this switch to Off (it’s On by default) to 
make keyboards that normally switch between lowercase letters 
and uppercase letters display uppercase letters all the time.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
147
• 
Sticky Keys: Tap this button to display the Sticky Keys screen (see 
Figure 3-83). Set the Sticky Keys switch to On if you want to enable 
the Sticky Keys feature, which enables you to press a modifier key 
(such as Shift) and have it stay down until you press another key 
(such as A) instead of having to hold down Shift while you press 
the other key (Shift-A, in the example). Set the Toggle With Shift 
Key switch to On if you want to be able to toggle Sticky Keys on or 
off by pressing the Shift key five times in sequence.
■
■Note   The Toggle With Shift Key feature is often useful for conventional use, but it can 
conflict with games that require the Shift key to be pressed repeatedly or held down to 
control movement, violence, or other aspects of gameplay.
• 
Sound: Set this switch to On if you want Sticky Keys to play a 
sound when a modifier key is set (stuck on). The sound can be 
helpful when the user is getting the hang of Sticky Keys, but it may 
prove irksome for experienced users.
Figure 3-83.  On the Sticky Keys screen, you can enable or disable Sticky Keys, choose 
whether to use the Shift key to toggle Sticky Keys, and control whether iOS plays a sound 
when a modifier key is set

Configuring Keyboards for the iPad
As you know, the iPad comes with a variety of on-screen keyboards that pop up 
automatically when you need to enter text—for example, when you select a text field or 
when you start a new note in the Notes app. By default, the on-screen keyboard uses the 
layouts for the region you specified when setting up the iPad, but you can apply different 
layouts as needed.
You can also connect a hardware keyboard to the iPad. Once you’ve done so, you can 
choose your preferred layout for it.
■
■Note   See the section “Choosing Hardware Keyboards Where Needed” in Chapter 2 for 
details on the different types of keyboards you can connect to an iPad.
For both the on-screen keyboard and any hardware keyboard you use, you can 
set up text replacements (which work in a similar way to the AutoCorrect feature in 
the Microsoft Office apps) and configure assistive typing features such as automatic 
capitalization, Caps Lock, and the split keyboard.

establishes the pairing with the keyboard, and the keyboard 
appears in the My Devices list, marked as Connected  
(see Figure 3-99).
You can now start using the keyboard to type text and give commands.
Disconnecting, Reconnecting, and Forgetting a Bluetooth 
Keyboard
When you finish using a Bluetooth keyboard, disconnect it from your iPad. You can do 
this in two ways:
• 
Keyboard. Turn off the keyboard’s power. The iPad then 
disconnects the keyboard after a few seconds.
■
■Note   To avoid running out of battery power, many Bluetooth keyboards switch off 
after a few minutes of inactivity. You can wake some keyboards by pressing a key. On other 
keyboards, you need to switch the power off and then back on.
• 
iPad. From the Home screen, choose Settings ➤ Bluetooth to 
display the Bluetooth screen. In the My Devices list, go to the 
keyboard’s button and tap the Information (i) icon to display 
the control screen for the keyboard. Figure 3-100 shows an 
example of this screen. Then tap the Disconnect button. The iPad 
disconnects the keyboard.
Figure 3-99.  The My Devices list on the Bluetooth screen shows devices you’ve paired with 
your iPad, together with their status, such as Connected or Not Connected. You can tap the 
blue Information (i) button to display information for a device

Figure 3-100.  On the iPad, tap the Disconnect button on the control screen for a Bluetooth 
keyboard to disconnect that keyboard
To reconnect a keyboard, turn it back on. Normally, this is enough to cause the iPad 
to reestablish the connection. If not, choose Settings ➤ Bluetooth from the Home screen 
to display the Bluetooth screen, and then tap the keyboard’s button in the My Devices 
list. When the button’s readout changes from Not Connected to Connected, you can start 
using the keyboard again.
To forget a keyboard, use the same technique as for any other Bluetooth device. 
From the Home screen, choose Settings ➤ Bluetooth to display the Bluetooth screen. In 
the My Devices list, go to the keyboard’s button and tap the Information (i) icon to display 
the control screen for the keyboard. Tap the Forget This Device button, and then tap the 
OK button in the Forget dialog that opens (see Figure 3-101).

Creating Text Replacements and Configuring Assistive 
Text Features
On the Keyboards screen in the Settings app, you can create text replacements and 
configure assistive text features.
Text replacements are strings of text that you want iOS to replace automatically. For 
example, you could create a text replacement that replaces the shortcut thissch with 
your school’s full name. After creating the replacement, you could type the shortcut to 
enter the full name quickly.
To create a text replacement, follow these steps:
	
1.	
On the first Keyboards screen, tap the Text Replacement 
button to display the first Text Replacement screen (see 
Figure 3-102). This screen may contain Apple’s example 
shortcut omw, which expands to the phrase On my way!
	
2.	
Tap the + button in the upper-right corner of the first Text 
Replacement screen to display the second Text Replacement 
screen (see Figure 3-103).
	
3.	
In the Phrase box, type the replacement text.
Figure 3-102.  The first Text Replacement screen shows any existing text replacements.  
Tap the + button in the upper-right corner to start creating a new text replacement
Figure 3-103.  On the second Text Replacement screen, type the phrase and the shortcut, 
and then tap the Save button

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
163
■
■Tip   The Shortcut field on the second Text Replacement screen is marked “Optional” 
because you can create a phrase without a shortcut. Doing so adds the phrase to the 
dictionary, exempting the phrase from spell checking, but doesn’t create a shortcut for it.
	
4.	
In the Shortcut box, type the shortcut for the replacement. 
Normally, you’ll want to keep the shortcut short so you can 
type it easily. Avoid using a real word for the shortcut so that 
you don’t trigger the replacement unintentionally.
	
5.	
Tap the Save button. The first Text Replacement screen 
appears again, now with the new text replacement on it.
To configure assistive text features, set the switches on the first Keyboards screen to 
On or Off, as needed. The following list explains the features:
• 
Auto-Capitalization: Set this switch to On to have iOS capitalize 
the first letter of a new sentence or paragraph.
• 
Auto-Correction: Set this switch to On to have iOS automatically 
correct items in its database of frequent typos, such as correcting 
teh to the.
• 
Check Spelling: Set this switch to On to enable spell checking.
• 
Enable Caps Lock: Set this switch to On to enable the Caps Lock 
feature, which you trigger by double-tapping the Shift key.
• 
Shortcuts: Set this switch to On to enable text replacements.
• 
Predictive: Set this switch to On to enable predictive text. The 
predictive text suggestions appear on the Suggestions bar above 
the keyboard.
• 
Smart Punctuation: [iOS 11 only] Set this switch to On to enable 
smart punctuation, which inserts typographical characters for 
plain typed characters—for example, substituting smart quotes 
(“”) for straight quotes (“”).
• 
Split Keyboard: Set this switch to On to enable the command 
for splitting the keyboard into left and right sections. The split 
keyboard can be good for thumb typing.
• 
Enable Key Flicks: (iOS 11 only.) Set this switch to On to enable 
flicking down on a key on the on-screen keyboard to type the 
character shown in gray above the main character. For example, 
you can flick downward on Q to type 1, flick downward on W to 
type 2, and so on.
• 
“ . ” Shortcut: Set this switch to On to have iOS type a period (.) 
when you type two spaces in quick succession at the end of a word.

Enabling Dictation
iOS’s Dictation feature enables you to dictate text into your iPad with fair speed and 
impressive accuracy. Dictation can be a great way of entering text quickly, but in most 
cases it’s best used by individuals or small groups; if you have a full classroom of students 
trying to dictate text simultaneously, chances are the noise will rapidly reach cocktail-party 
levels, and voice recognition will become difficult.
■
■Caution   iOS implements dictation by recording your input and sending it to Apple’s 
voice-recognition servers, which process the audio and return the corresponding text. For 
most consumers and many businesses, this is simply a practical arrangement that doesn’t 
raise privacy concerns. But if your school has tight privacy policies, you might need to check 
that using dictation on iOS conforms to them.
To enable Dictation, set the Enable Dictation switch at the bottom of the first 
Keyboards screen to On, and then tap the Enable Dictation button in the Enable 
Dictation? dialog (see Figure 3-104).
Once you’ve enabled Dictation, you can use it by tapping the microphone button 
that appears to the left of the spacebar on the keyboard.
Updating the Operating System
Apple frequently issues updates to iOS to resolve security issues, improve performance, 
and add new features. To keep your iPads running well, it’s usually a good idea to apply 
iOS updates soon after Apple releases them. This section shows you how to update iOS 
directly on the iPad.
Figure 3-104.  Tap the Enable Dictation button in the Enable Dictation? dialog to enable 
dictation

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
165
■
■Caution   Software updates sometimes cause incompatibilities and unexpected 
problems. Rather than applying each update the moment it becomes available, you may 
prefer to wait a few days to see if other users report problems with the update. If problems 
occur, wait for an update to the update; if not, install the update.
Updating the Operating System Manually
The most straightforward way to update the operating system on an iPad is by working 
manually. When an update is available, a red badge appears on the Settings app icon on 
the Home screen. The badge normally shows the number 1, unless there are multiple 
updates.
Here’s how to update the operating system manually:
	
1.	
From the Home screen, choose Settings ➤ General ➤ 
Software Update to display the Software Update screen (see 
Figure 3-105). iOS checks automatically for an update, even 
if it’s already established that one is available, because there 
may now be a newer update. If an update is available, the 
update’s details appear; if not, you’ll see a readout saying that 
the software is up to date.
■
■Note   You can tap the Learn More button on the Software Update screen to display the 
About This Update dialog box, which shows fuller details of the fixes and improvements the 
update contains. When you finish looking through the details, tap the Done button to close 
the About This Update dialog box.
Figure 3-105.  The Software Update screen in the Settings app displays any available 
software update for the iPad’s operating system. Tap the Install Now button to start 
installing the update

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
166
	
2.	
If an update is available, but hasn’t yet been downloaded, 
tap the Download and Install button. Otherwise, if there’s an 
update that has been downloaded, tap the Install Now button. 
Either way, the Enter Passcode dialog opens, demanding your 
login passcode.
	
3.	
Type the passcode. The Terms and Conditions dialog opens.
	
4.	
Read the terms and conditions, or tap the Send by E-mail 
button and enter the e-mail address to which you want to 
have them sent so you can add them to your files.
	
5.	
Tap the Agree button. A smaller Terms and Conditions dialog 
then opens.
	
6.	
Tap the Agree button in this dialog as well. The download or 
the update then starts.
Installing and Removing Apps and Customizing 
the Home Screen Pages
Each iPad comes with a suite of built-in apps, such as the Safari app for browsing the 
Web, the Mail app for communicating via e-mail, and the Camera app for taking photos 
and videos. You can install other apps manually from the App Store—and remove any 
apps you find aren’t useful—either by working on the iPad itself or by managing the iPad 
from iTunes.
■
■Note   You can also install and remove apps via policy. For example, if you order 
customized iPads from the Apple Store or via Apple School Manager, the iPads will come 
with the apps and settings you specify.
You can customize the Home screen pages by rearranging the icons on them, 
creating folders, and arranging the icons into folders.
Installing an App Directly on the iPad
Installing an app from the App Store is straightforward. Tap the App Store icon on the 
Home screen to launch the App Store app, and then browse or search to find the app you 
want to install. For example, to find a calculator app for the iPad, tap the Search button at 
the bottom of the screen, and then type a search term (such as calculator). Figure 3-106 
shows the information screen for a calculator app called The Calculator.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
167
■
■Note   If the App Store icon doesn’t appear on the Home screen or when you search for 
it, the iPad has restrictions applied to it. If you manage this iPad directly, choose Settings 
➤ General ➤ Restrictions from the Home screen, enter your Restrictions Passcode when 
prompted, and then set the Installing Apps switch and the Deleting Apps switch to On. Go 
back to the Home screen, and the App Store icon will be present.
If you want to install the app, tap the Get button (for a free app) or the price button 
(for a paid app), and then tap the Install button that replaces the Get button or the price 
button. Sign in if the App Store prompts you to do so. The iPad then downloads the app 
and installs it. While the app is downloading and installing, the Loading icon appears on 
the Home screen (see Figure 3-107).
Figure 3-106.  In the App Store app, tap an app’s button to display the information screen 
for the app. You can then tap the Get button ( for a free app) or the price button ( for a paid 
app) to start the installation

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
168
When the installation is complete, the app’s icon appears on the Home screen, and 
you can launch the app by tapping the icon. If you’re still looking at the app’s information 
dialog in the App Store app, you can tap the Open button (which replaces the Install 
button) to launch the app.
Removing an App Manually from the iPad
It’s easy to quickly remove an app from the iPad:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap and hold an app icon until the icons 
start to jiggle. A gray circle containing a gray X appears at the 
upper-left corner of each app you can delete (see Figure 3-108).
Figure 3-107.  The Loading icon appears on the Home screen while the iPad downloads 
and installs the app
Figure 3-108.  To remove an app, tap and hold its icon on the Home screen until the icons 
start to jiggle, and then tap the X button on the icon

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
169
	
2.	
Tap the X button. The Delete dialog for the app opens  
(see Figure 3-109), warning you that deleting the app will 
delete its data as well.
	
3.	
Tap the Delete button. iOS deletes the app and its data, and 
the app’s icon disappears from the Home screen.
	
4.	
Press the Home button. The icons stop jiggling.
Customizing the Home Screen Pages Manually
You can customize the Home screen pages by rearranging the icons either on the pages 
themselves or by placing the icons in folders you create.
iOS 11 makes customizing the Home screen a little easier than it is in iOS 10—and in 
iOS 11, you can also customize the Dock (which iOS 10 doesn’t have).
In iOS 10, you must first open the appropriate Home screen page for customization 
by tapping and holding an icon on that page. It doesn’t matter which icon you tap 
and hold, but usually it’s easiest to tap and hold an icon that you want to move or that 
you want to put in a folder. When the icons start jiggling, and an X button appears on 
the upper-left corner of the icon for each app you can remove, the page is open for 
customization. You can use this method in iOS 11 as well—and you need to use it for 
moves such as creating a folder and giving the folder a name—but iOS 11 also lets you 
simply tap and hold an icon until it expands momentarily, indicating that it’s movable 
and that you can drag it.
After these preliminaries, you can take the following actions:
• 
Move an icon: Drag the icon to where you want it. The other 
icons move out of the way as needed. Figure 3-110 shows a Home 
screen page open for editing and an icon being dragged in iOS 10. 
To move the icon to a different Home screen page, drag to the left 
or right edge of the screen, wait until the previous page or next 
page appears, and then continue dragging to the desired position.
Figure 3-109.  Tap the Delete button in the Delete dialog to delete the app and its data

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
170
• 
Create a folder: Drag the icon for an app you want to include in 
the folder onto the icon for another app you want to include. 
iOS creates the folder, puts the app icons in it, and suggests a 
name (see Figure 3-111, which also shows iOS 10). You can tap 
the X button to the right of the name to delete the suggestion, or 
simply edit it as needed. When you’re ready to close the folder, tap 
outside it.
Figure 3-110.  After tapping and holding an icon to open the Home screen page for editing, 
you can drag an icon to where you want it

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
171
Figure 3-111.  iOS creates a folder when you drop one icon on top of another. You can edit 
the folder name as needed
■
■Tip   Each folder can contain multiple pages. To move to the next page, drag an icon 
within the folder to the right edge of the folder area.
■
■Note   In iOS 11, you can create a folder by dragging one app’s icon onto another 
without opening the Home screen page for customization. When you do this, though, iOS 
gives the folder a default name and doesn’t give you the option of changing it until you open 
the Home screen page for customization.
• 
Add an app to a folder: Drag the app’s icon to the folder and drop 
it there.
• 
Remove an app from a folder: Tap the folder to open it, and then 
drag the app out of the folder.

Installing and Removing Apps Using iTunes
If you’ve used iTunes to set up an iPad, you can use iTunes to manage the apps on the 
iPad as well. iTunes enables you to browse the App Store easily, buy and download apps, 
and install them on iOS devices.
Browsing and Buying Apps Using iTunes
To browse and buy apps using iTunes, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open iTunes as usual.
	
2.	
Click the Store button on the Navigation bar at the top of the 
window to display the Store screen.
	
3.	
Click the pop-up menu on the right, and then click App Store 
to display the App Store section of the Store.
	
4.	
Click the iPad tab button at the top of the screen to display 
iPad apps rather than iPhone apps (see Figure 3-112).
Figure 3-112.  Select App Store in the pop-up menu on the right side of the Store screen, 
and then click the iPad tab at the top of the screen to display iPad apps. You can then 
browse apps by using the lists or categories, or by searching

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
173
You can then locate the apps you want in any of the following three ways:
• 
Browse by lists: The App Store includes many lists, such as Get 
Productive, Great with Apple Pencil, and New Games We Love.
• 
Browse by categories: Click the Categories pop-up menu (which 
appears as All Categories in Figure 3-112), and then click the 
appropriate category, such as Education, Productivity, or Utilities.
• 
Search by name or keyword: Tap the Search box in the upper-right 
corner of the iTunes window, click the Store tab button instead of 
the In Library tab button, and then type your search terms.
When you locate the right app, click the Get button (for a free app—see Figure 3-113) 
or the price button (for a paid app). Sign in to the Store if iTunes prompts you to do so. 
iTunes then downloads the app to the computer.
Figure 3-113.  Click the Get button (for a free app) or the price button ( for a paid app)

174
Browsing Your Library of Apps
When you want to see all the apps you’ve purchased or downloaded for free from the App 
Store, click the Library tab button in the Navigation bar at the top of the iTunes window. 
The Library screen appears, showing the available apps (see Figure 3-114). The Sidebar 
shows the Library category and the Devices category, in which any iPad appears that is 
connected to the computer.
From the Library screen, you can take the following actions:
• 
View details for an app: Right-click (or Ctrl-click on the Mac) the 
app’s icon and then click Get Info on the shortcut menu. In the 
dialog that opens, look at the Details tab to see the app’s name, 
the developer, and the version. Look at the File tab to see the app’s 
size, its kind (such as iPhone/iPod touch/iPad app), the iCloud 
account that purchased the app and the purchase date, and the 
location and filename of the app file. Click the OK button when 
you finish examining the details.
• 
Open a Finder window to the folder containing an app: Right-click 
(or Ctrl-click on the Mac) the app’s icon and then click Show in 
Finder on the shortcut menu.
Figure 3-114.  Display the Library screen when you want to see all the apps you’ve 
purchased or downloaded for free from the App Store. The Update flash indicates an app 
for which an update is available

175
• 
Display an app’s page in the App Store: Right-click (or Ctrl-click 
on the Mac) the app’s icon and then click Show in iTunes Store on 
the shortcut menu.
• 
Update an app: If an Update flash appears across the upper-right 
corner of the app’s icon, you can update the app by right-clicking 
(or Ctrl-clicking on the Mac) the app’s icon and then clicking 
Update App on the shortcut menu.
■
■Tip   Instead of updating apps individually, you may prefer to update all apps at once by 
working on the Updates tab. See the next section for details.
• 
Delete an app: Right-click (or Ctrl-click on the Mac) the app’s icon, 
click Delete From Library on the shortcut menu, and then click 
the Delete App button in the confirmation dialog that opens.
• 
Install an app: Drag the app from the Library screen to the iPad in 
the sidebar.
Updating Apps in Your Library
The Updates screen enables you to see which apps have updates available. You can click 
the Update All Apps button to update all the apps in a single operation. Alternatively, you 
can update a single app by right-clicking (or Ctrl-clicking on the Mac) its icon and then 
clicking Update App on the shortcut menu.
Installing and Removing Apps Using iTunes
You can quickly install apps on the iPad and remove apps from it by using iTunes. Follow 
these steps:
	
1.	
Connect the iPad to the Mac or PC.
■
■Note  You can connect the iPad either directly, via USB, or via Wi-Fi (if you have enabled 
Wi-Fi sync). USB is usually the fastest and easiest means for syncing an iPad.
	
2.	
Click the iPad button on the Navigation bar at the top of the 
iTunes window. The screens for managing the iPad appear.
	
3.	
In the Settings section of the sidebar, click the Apps item.  
The Apps screen appears (see Figure 3-115).

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
176
	
4.	
Click the Sort pop-up menu under the Apps heading and then 
click the Show Only iPad Apps item instead of the Show All 
Apps item at the bottom of the pop-up menu.
To locate the apps you need, you can sort or search the list of apps. To sort the apps, 
click the Sort pop-up menu under the Apps heading and then click the sort type you want:
• 
Sort by Name: Sorts the apps in alphabetical order.
• 
Sort by Kind: Sorts the apps into three kinds: Universal (apps 
designed to run on all iOS devices), iPad (apps designed to run 
only on the iPad), and iPhone (apps designed to run on the 
iPhone ad iPod touch).
■
■Note   Selecting the Show Only iPad Apps item on the Sort pop-up menu makes the 
Apps list display Universal apps and iPad apps. Normally, selecting Show Only iPad Apps is 
more helpful than sorting by Kind.
Figure 3-115.  On the Apps screen, you can install and remove apps by clicking the buttons 
in the Apps list or by dragging apps to and from the Home screen pages in the Home Screens 
list

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
177
• 
Sort by Category: Sorts the apps into App Store categories such as 
Books, Business, Education, Entertainment, and Finance.
• 
Sort by Date Added: Sorts the apps into reverse date order, so 
the apps added most recently appear at the top of the list. Sort 
by Date Added is useful for quickly locating apps you’ve just 
downloaded.
• 
Sort by Size: Sorts the apps into descending order by size. Sort by 
Size is useful for locating space hogs.
You can also search by clicking the Search field and typing part of an app’s name, a 
keyword in a description, or a category name.
Once you’ve located the apps you’re interested in, you can set apps to be installed or 
removed:
• 
Set an app to be installed: Click the Install button for the app. 
The Will Install button replaces the Install button. The app’s icon 
appears on one of the Home screen pages in the Home Screens 
list on the right side of the iTunes window.
■
■Tip   When you click the Install button, iTunes places the app’s icon in a default position 
on a Home screen page—usually after the last existing app icon. If you want to move the 
app’s icon to a different position, double-click the Home screen page to open that page for 
editing. You can then drag the icons around. Click outside the open page when you’re ready 
to close it.
• 
Set an app to be removed: Click the Remove button for the app. 
The Will Remove button replaces the Remove button, and the 
app’s icon disappears from the Home screen page it was on.
■
■Tip   You can also drag an app’s icon from the Apps list to a particular spot on the Home 
screen page of your choice. You may find this an easier way to control icon placement than 
clicking the Install button and then dragging the icon after iTunes places it.
When you’re ready to commit the changes you’ve made, click the Apply button. 
iTunes syncs the iPad’s apps, installing those you’ve marked for installation, removing 
those you’ve marked for removal, and making other changes you’ve marked (such as 
rearranging app icons).

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
178
Customizing the Home Screen Pages
From the Apps screen, you can customize the Home screen pages in the following ways:
• 
Add a Home screen page: Click the + button at the right end of the 
Home Screens bar. A new page appears at the bottom of the list; 
you may need to scroll down to see it.
• 
Rearrange the Home screen pages: Click the Home screen page 
you want to move, and then drag it up or down the list. When 
rearranging pages, you may find it helpful to zoom the Home 
screen pages out by dragging the slider at the top of the Home 
Screens list to the left.
• 
Remove a Home screen page: You can’t directly remove a Home 
screen page, but iTunes automatically removes any page that 
contains no icons when you apply the changes.
• 
Remove an app: Double-click the Home screen page that contains 
the app’s icon. The Home screen page opens for editing. Move the 
pointer over the icon for the app you want to remove, and then 
click the X button that appears on the upper-left corner of the 
app’s icon.
• 
Create a folder: Double-click the Home screen page that contains 
the first two apps you want to put into the folder. The page opens 
for editing. Drag one app’s icon onto the other app’s icon and drop 
it there. iTunes creates a folder, to which it gives a suggested name 
based on the categories of the apps. Edit the name as needed—or 
type another name—and press the Return key or the Enter key to 
apply it. Click outside the page when you finish editing it.
• 
Put an app in a folder: Double-click the Home screen page that 
contains the app and the folder. The page opens for editing. Drag 
the app’s icon to the folder and drop it there.
Managing Local Storage and iCloud Storage
Each iPad has built-in storage for storing apps and files. When you connect the iPad to an 
iCloud account, the iPad can also store data in iCloud. For example, iCloud-enabled apps 
(such as Pages and Numbers) can store documents in iCloud so that you can access them 
from any iOS device, from Macs, and from most computers. You can also choose which 
other items—such as photos, videos, and backups—to save from an iPad to iCloud.
These features work differently in iOS 11 than in iOS 10, so I’ll cover them in separate 
sections.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
179
Managing Local Storage and iCloud Storage on iOS 11
This section explains how to manage local storage and iCloud storage on iOS 11. First, 
we’ll get an overview of the iPad’s storage situation and how you can manage it and clear 
space when needed. After that, we’ll explore how you manage iCloud storage and how 
you buy more storage if you need it.
Assessing the iPad’s Storage Situation and Managing Local 
Storage
To get an overview of the iPad’s storage situation, display the Home screen and then 
choose Settings ➤ General ➤ iPad Storage. On the iPad Storage screen (see Figure 3-116), 
start by looking at the iPad histogram at the top to see how much space has been used 
and which items—photos, apps, media, books, mail, and other—are using it. The headline 
figure, such as 13.5 GB of 32 GB Used, gives you an idea of the overall picture.
Figure 3-116.  Look at the iPad Storage screen in the Settings app to get an overview of how 
much of the iPad’s local storage is currently in use and how much is still available

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
180
Next, look at the Recommendations box, which shows suggestions for ways you can 
reclaim storage. The recommendations depend on your iPad and its contents, but here 
are three examples:
• 
Offload Unused Apps: Tap the Enable button to turn on the 
Offload Unused Apps feature, which—when storage is low—
automatically deletes you haven’t used for a long time. The 
iPad retains the documents and data for the apps, and you can 
download the apps again from the App Store when you need to 
use them again.
• 
Review iTunes Videos: Tap this button to see a list of videos you’ve 
downloaded from iTunes and that you can delete to recover 
space.
• 
Review Large Attachments: Tap this button to see a list of large 
attachments that are taking up space in the Messages app. If you 
no longer need these attachments, you can delete them to recover 
the space they’re occupying.
Once you’ve dealt with—or decided to skip—the recommendations, look at the list 
of apps and features further down the screen. This list shows the amounts of space the 
apps and features are taking up. The list is in descending order by usage, so look at the top 
of the list to see what’s consuming the most storage. The two items at the top of the list in 
Figure 3-116—the Photos app and the Music App—are frequent offenders.
■
■Note   The Photos app often appears at or near the top of the list on the Storage screen, 
because photos take up a large amount of space and videos can take up a huge amount 
of space. If your iPads tend to run out of space, make a point of reviewing the photos and 
videos on the iPads and removing any that are no longer needed.
From the iPad Storage screen, you can tap the button for an app or feature to display 
more information. For an app that you have installed, iOS displays an Info screen that 
includes the Offload App button for offloading the app (removing the app but keeping its 
documents and data) and the Delete App button for deleting the app (see Figure 3-117). 
If you tap the Delete App button, iOS displays the Delete App dialog to confirm that you 
want to delete the app and all its documents and data; tap the Delete App button in the 
dialog if you want to proceed.

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
181
For a built-in app or a feature that you can’t remove, iOS displays a screen showing 
the name of the app or feature and more information about the space it’s consuming. For 
example, if you tap the Videos button on the iPad Storage screen, you’ll see the Videos 
screen (see Figure 3-118), which shows a Documents & Data readout showing the space 
that videos are taking up. There’s an Edit button that you can tap to switch to Edit Mode, 
but for this app, Edit Mode doesn’t actually let you make any changes.
Figure 3-117.  On the Info screen for an app in iOS 11, you can tap the Delete App button 
to delete the app together with its documents and data, freeing up the storage they’re 
consuming, or tap the Offload App button to delete the app but keep its documents and 
data on the iPad
Figure 3-118.  The information screen for a built-in app or feature shows its name and 
details of the items that are taking up space on the iPad

Chapter 3 ■ Essential iPad Skills for Administrators and Teachers 
182
For some built-in apps and features, you can delete some or all of the data. For 
example, the Safari screen (see Figure 3-119) shows you the amount of space taken up by 
website data, the cache for the Offline Reading List, and the browsing History. You can 
then tap the Edit button to reveal a red minus button on the left of the Offline Reading List 
button; tapping this red minus button reveals a Delete button that you can tap to clear the 
cache for the offline Reading List. Tap the Done button when you finish editing the list.
Managing iCloud Storage and Buying More If Necessary
A standard iCloud account includes 5 GB of storage for free, which is enough for light use, 
especially if the iPad doesn’t need to store many photos and videos. To stay within the 
iCloud storage allowance, you can monitor the amount of space that items are taking up, 
and delete items no longer needed on the iPad. If necessary, you can change the storage 
plan for the iCloud account.
To manage storage, first display the iCloud screen by choosing Settings ➤ Apple ID 
➤ iCloud. The Storage readout at the top of the iCloud screen (see Figure 3-120) shows 
the amount of space occupied and the amount that’s free.
Figure 3-119.  On the Safari screen, you can tap the Edit button to reveal controls for 
deleting the Offline Reading List cache

Getting an Overview of the iPad’s Storage Situation
To get an overview of the iPad’s storage situation, choose Settings ➤ General ➤ 
Storage & iCloud Usage from the Home screen. On the Storage & iCloud Usage screen 
(see Figure 3-126), you can see the following information in the Storage box and in the 
iCloud box:
• 
Used: This readout shows how much space on the iPad is in use.
• 
Available: This readout shows how much space on the iPad is 
available.
• 
Total Storage: This readout shows the total amount of space 
available in the iCloud account that this iPad is using.
• 
Available: This readout shows how much of the total iCloud 
storage is available.
Managing the iPad’s Built-In Storage
To see what’s taking up space in the iPad’s built-in storage, and to free up space if 
necessary, tap the Manage Storage button in the Storage box on the Storage & iCloud 
Usage screen. The Storage screen appears (see Figure 3-127), showing the following 
information:

• 
Apps and features: This list shows the amounts of space that apps 
and features are taking up on the iPad. The list is in descending 
order by usage, so look at the top of the list to see what’s 
consuming the most storage.
■
■Note   The Photos & Camera feature often appears at or near the top of the list on the 
Storage screen, because photos take up a large amount of space and videos can take up a 
huge amount of space. If your iPads tend to run out of space, make a point of reviewing the 
photos and videos on the iPads and removing any that are no longer needed. Look also at 
podcasts—they too can take up a lot of space.
From the Storage screen, you can tap the button for an app or feature to display more 
information. For an app that you have installed, iOS displays an Info screen that includes 
a Delete App button for deleting the app (see Figure 3-128). iOS displays the Delete App 
dialog to confirm that you want to delete the app and all its documents and data; tap the 
Delete App button in the dialog if you want to proceed.

For a built-in app or for a feature, iOS displays a screen showing the name of the 
app or feature and more information about the space it’s consuming. For example, if you 
tap the Calendars & Reminders button on the Storage screen, you’ll see the Calendars 
& Reminders screen (see Figure 3-129), which shows brief information about the events 
and attachments that are taking up space.
For some built-in apps and features, you can delete some or all of the data. For 
example, the Safari screen (see Figure 3-130) shows you the amount of space taken up by 
website data, the cache for the offline Reading List, and the browsing History. You can tap 
the Edit button to reveal a graphical Delete button on the left of the Offline Reading List 
button; tapping this graphical Delete button reveals a textual Delete button that you can 
tap to clear the cache for the offline Reading List. Tap the Done button when you finish

Summary
In this chapter, you’ve learned essential skills for using an iPad as an administrator or as 
a teacher. You know how to set up an iPad from scratch and connect it to Wi-Fi networks 
and Bluetooth devices, how to navigate the interface and restart the iPad, and how to 
configure the settings that are usually most important in the classroom. You also know 
how to connect keyboards, update the operating system, install and organize apps, and 
manage storage both on the iPad itself and on the iCloud account it connects to.

CHAPTER 4
Managing iPads with Apple 
Configurator
In this chapter, we’ll look at how to use the Apple Configurator app to configure iPads 
automatically. We’ll start with a quick overview of what you can do with the app. We’ll 
get the app downloaded, installed, and configured on your Mac, and then work through 
the actions it enables you to take. These actions include connecting and updating iPads, 
organizing and sorting them, backing them up, and restoring them. You’ll see how to 
prepare the iPads for deployment, build configuration profiles and apply them to iPads, 
and create templates called blueprints and apply them to iPads.
As explained in Chapter 1, Apple Configurator is only one of your options for 
configuring iPads automatically. You would normally use Apple Configurator only if your 
school doesn’t have a Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution that can manage 
iPads and other iOS devices. If your school does have an iPad-capable MDM system, you 
would normally use that to configure the iPads.
Understanding What You Can Do with Apple 
Configurator
Apple Configurator is an Apple-developed app for configuring iOS devices—the iPad, 
iPhone, iPod touch, and Apple TV—connected to a Mac via a USB cable. As of this writing, 
the current version of Apple Configurator is version 2, and that’s what the screens in 
this chapter show. Apple Configurator enables you to configure iOS devices—here, we’ll 
assume they’re iPads—in eight main ways:
• 
Install apps and documents: You can install apps and documents 
directly onto a connected iPad.
• 
Configure iPads directly: You can perform some minor 
configuration directly via Apple Configurator, such as changing 
the iPad’s name, modifying its wallpaper, or customizing the 
Home screen layout.
• 
Update iPads: You can update iOS and apps to the latest versions.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
198
• 
Backup and restore iPads: You can back up an iPad and restore an 
iPad from backup—either a backup you’ve made from the iPad 
itself or the backup of a configuration that you want to clone onto 
the iPad. You can also restore an iPad to factory settings.
• 
Create and apply configuration profiles: A configuration profile 
is a file that can contain any of a very wide range of settings for a 
device. You can apply either a single profile or multiple profiles to 
an iPad. For example, you might apply one profile that configures 
networking settings (such as Wi-Fi, VPN, and proxy server) for 
your school and another that sets up specific accounts for e-mail, 
contacts, calendars, and so on. By adding these two profiles 
to your school’s iPads, you can perform a large amount of the 
configuration automatically.
• 
Create and apply blueprints: A blueprint is a template that 
can contain configuration profiles, apps, or both. You can 
build blueprints in Apple Configurator and apply them to the 
appropriate iPads. For example, you might create a blueprint for 
student iPads that contains the two profiles mentioned in the 
previous bullet plus the apps that every student will need.
• 
Make a device a supervised device: Out of the box, an iPad is 
normally an unsupervised device, because the iPad’s owner is free 
to change its configuration. By contrast, a supervised device is one 
over which you retain administrative control. Supervising a device 
gives you tight control over which changes (if any) a user can make 
to the device. Assuming your school buys the iPads that you’re 
deploying, you’ll likely want to supervise the iPads. Table 4-1  
explains the settings that are available only for supervised 
iPads and that you apply through MDM. Some of the settings 
that you can include in configuration profiles are also limited 
to supervised devices; you’ll learn about these in the section 
“Working with Configuration Profiles,” later in this chapter.
• 
Prepare devices for deployment: You can use the Prepare Assistant 
feature in Apple Configurator to quickly set up a large number of 
iPads for deployment to students or staff.

SHOULD YOU USE APPLE CONFIGURATOR,  
MDM, OR BOTH?
Depending on your school’s size and organization, you may find that Apple 
Configurator on its own provides enough configuration and management capabilities 
for your iPads. But if Apple Configurator doesn’t meet all your needs, you can turn to 
a Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution. MDM solutions typically offer greater 
control of the devices you enroll in them, especially after you deploy the devices. 
For example, whereas Apple Configurator requires each device to be connected via 
Table 4-1.  (continued)

USB to the Mac you’re using (you can connect multiple devices at once), most MDM 
solutions can configure devices “over the air” via a Wi-Fi or cellular connection. 
MDM solutions also typically let you distribute custom apps to enrolled devices, 
monitor the apps installed on them, and lock or even erase the devices remotely.
Various MDM solutions are available; we’ll look at some options in Chapter 6. If you 
decide to use an MDM solution, you can either use Apple Configurator along with it 
or use the MDM solution on its own.
Getting Apple Configurator
In this section, we’ll download the Apple Configurator app from the App Store, install it 
on your Mac, and configure it to suit your needs.
■
■Note   Apple Configurator requires a Mac running macOS 10.12.2 or later as of this 
writing. There is no version of Apple Configurator for Windows.
Downloading and Installing Apple Configurator
To download and install Apple Configurator, follow these steps:
	
1.	
On your Mac, open the App Store app from the Dock or from 
Launchpad.

you want Apple Configurator to display the device browser (the 
main window) each time you launch the app. This is usually 
helpful. Deselect this check box if you prefer to open the device 
browser manually when you need it.
Figure 4-2.  In the General preference pane, you can control whether Apple Configurator 
plays sounds for warnings and for task completion and whether the app displays the device 
browser when you launch it. You can also reset all warning dialogs.

Setting Up Your Organizations in the Organizations Preferences 
Pane
In the Organizations preferences pane (shown in Figure 4-3 with two organizations 
added), you can set up the organizations that you’ll use to supervise the iPads. An 
organization is a named item that contains the contact information and supervision 
identity for a supervised device. For example, you might set up an organization 
to represent an entire small school. In a larger school, you might set up multiple 
organizations for different departments or locations.
Figure 4-3.  Work in the Organizations pane in the Preferences window to set up the 
organizations for supervising your school’s iPads
You can add one or more organizations manually or import each organization 
from an existing file. When adding an organization manually, you can choose between 
generating a new supervision identity and choosing an existing supervision identity.

Setting Up Your MDM Servers in the Servers Preferences Pane
If you’re going to use Apple Configurator to enroll your school’s iPads in an MDM 
solution, you can use the Servers preferences pane to specify which servers to use. Some 
MDM solutions enable you to use Apple Configurator to enroll the iPads like this. With 
other MDM solutions, you use other means of enrolling the iPads, such as navigating to 
an enrollment URL in a web browser (such as Safari) or installing a custom enrollment 
app on the iPad.
If you’ll use Apple Configurator to enroll the iPads in MDM, display the Servers 
preferences pane by clicking the Servers button on the toolbar in the Apple Configurator 
Preferences window. At first, the Servers preferences pane usually appears with no 
servers configured, as shown in Figure 4-10.
Figure 4-9.  In the “Choose a password to encrypt the identity” dialog, either type a 
password or click the Password Assistant icon (the key icon) and use the Password Assistant 
dialog to select a password

which the devices can enroll in the MDM. You would get the 
hostname or enrollment URL from the MDM vendor.
	
5.	
Click the Next button. Apple Configurator verifies the 
server’s enrollment URL and fetches the server’s trust anchor 
certificates, certificates used to specify which certificates to 
trust as a basis for the MDM. The third Define an MDM Server 
pane then appears (see Figure 4-12), enabling you to choose 
which trust anchor certificates to add.
Figure 4-11.  In the second Define an MDM Server pane, type the server’s name and the 
enrollment URL

Setting Up Your Tags for Tagging iOS Devices
Apple Configurator enables you to apply tags to iPads and other iOS devices so that you 
can identify them more easily. Apple Configurator comes with predefined color tags, 
much like those you can use in the Finder in macOS, but you can rename the predefined 
tags and create other tags as needed. For example, you might create tags for different 
groups, such as Teachers, Support Staff, and Students, tags for departments, such as 
Science, or tags for particular classes.
Figure 4-12.  In the third Define an MDM Server pane, choose which of the server’s trust 
anchor certificates to add

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator

Connecting, Configuring, and Organizing Your 
iPads
In this section, we’ll look at how to connect iPads to Apple Configurator, view and sort 
the iPads, and perform essential operations such as updating the iPads and backing 
them up. We’ll then go through how to choose advanced settings, how to view and export 
information about the iPads, and how to tag the iPads with keywords, search for them, 
and organize them into groups.
Connecting an iPad to Apple Configurator
To get started using an iPad with Apple Configurator, connect the iPad via the USB cable 
to the Mac on which you’re running Apple Configurator. If the Trust This Computer? 
dialog opens on the iPad (see Figure 4-15), tap the Trust button.

Figure 4-15.  Tap the Trust button in the Trust This Computer? dialog the first time you 
connect an iPad to the Mac on which you’re running Apple Configurator

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
219
■
■Tip   You can either plug the USB cable directly into a USB port on the Mac or into a USB 
hub that’s plugged into the Mac. Using a powered hub enables you to connect multiple iPads 
at once, which is usually faster and more convenient than working on one device at a time. 
For best results, use a powered hub that bears the MFi logo, meaning that it has passed 
Apple’s MFi licensing program. (MFi stands for Made for iPhone/iPod/iPad.)
Once you’ve set the iPad to trust the Mac, the iPad appears in the device browser in 
Apple Configurator. You can then click the iPad to select it. Once the iPad is selected  
(see Figure 4-16), the command buttons on the toolbar become available.
Figure 4-16.  Select the iPad in the device browser in Apple Configurator to enable the 
command buttons on the toolbar. This screen shows the device browser in Collection view, 
which displays a thumbnail for each iPad. The red badge at the upper-right corner of the 
iPad indicates that an update is available.
Viewing and Sorting the Connected iPads
You can view the iPads you’ve connected to Apple Configurator as either a collection or as 
a list, and you can sort the iPads in a variety of different ways.
Collection view shows a large thumbnail for each iPad, whereas List view shows 
a list of iPads with various columns of details, such as the operating system version, 

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
220
iPad model, and iPad capacity; you can customize this list to show the details you want 
to see. List view is good for seeing many iPads at once and getting an overview of their 
configuration.
You can switch views in any of these three ways:
• 
Toolbar: Open the View pop-up menu and click the Collection 
item or the List item.
• 
Menu bar: Open the View menu and click the As Collection item 
or the As List item.
• 
Keyboard: Press Cmd-1 for Collection view or Cmd-2 for List view.
In List view (see Figure 4-17), you can choose which columns of data to display and 
the order in which to display them. To change the columns displayed, Ctrl-click or right-
click one of the currently displayed column headings. On the pop-up menu that appears, 
click to place a check mark next to a column you want to display or to remove the check 
mark from a column you want to remove. Table 4-2 explains the columns.
Figure 4-17.  In List view, you can customize the columns displayed. Click a column 
heading to sort the list by that column.

■
■Tip   You can adjust the width of a column by dragging its right border, but you can’t 
make a column narrower than its column heading. You can change the order of the columns 
by clicking a column heading and dragging it left or right along the heading bar.
In List view, you can sort the iPads quickly by clicking the column heading you 
want to sort by. The right side of the column heading displays a caret (^) to indicate an 
ascending sort or a downward caret (Ú) to indicate a descending sort. You can click the 
same column heading again to reverse the sort order.
In either Collection view or List view, you can sort the iPads either by choosing View 
➤ Sort By from the menu bar or View ➤ Sort By from the toolbar and then clicking the 
appropriate item on the Sort By submenu. In either view, the Sort By submenu shows 
the columns you’ve displayed in List view, so if you want to sort by a column that doesn’t 
appear on the Sort By submenu, go into List view and add that column.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
222
Updating an iPad’s Software
Apple Configurator enables you to update iOS and the apps on one or more iPads easily. 
This feature is very convenient, but because Apple Configurator may need to download 
multiple versions of iOS and apps, the update may take one or more hours, depending on 
the speed of your Internet connection. While the updates are running, you can’t perform 
other tasks in the device browser, so you may want to run the updates overnight or when 
you’re about to leave the office for a while.
To update the iPads, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Connect the iPads to the Mac or to a USB hub connected to 
the Mac.
	
2.	
Launch Apple Configurator if it’s not already running. The 
iPads appear in the device browser.
	
3.	
Select each iPad you want to update.
	
4.	
Give the Update command. You can do this by clicking the 
Update button on the toolbar, by choosing Actions ➤ Update 
from the menu bar, or by Ctrl-clicking or right-clicking in the 
selection and then clicking the Update item on the shortcut 
menu. Apple Configurator checks for available updates and 
displays the Update dialog (see Figure 4-18).
Figure 4-18.  In the Update dialog, open the pop-up menu and choose the “Latest iOS only” 
item, “Apps only” item, or “Latest iOS and Apps” item, and then click the Update button
	
5.	
Open the pop-up menu and choose the “Latest iOS only” 
item, “Apps only” item, or “Latest iOS and App” item, as 
needed. Depending on which updates are available, you may 
have no choice here.
	
6.	
Click the Update button. Apple Configurator downloads the 
updates if it hasn’t already done so. The License Agreement 
dialog then opens.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
223
	
7.	
Read the license information, and click the Accept button if 
you want to proceed. Apple Configurator downloads the latest 
updates and applies them to the iPad.
■
■Note   You may need to enter the iPad’s passcode one or more times during the update 
process.
Changing an iPad’s Name, Wallpaper, or Home Screen
Apple Configurator enables you to rename an iPad, change its wallpaper, and change its 
Home screen. You can make these changes either directly or by using a blueprint. This section 
shows you how to change them directly. The section “Modifying a Device’s Information via a 
Blueprint,” later in this chapter, explains how to make the changes via a blueprint.
BUILDING NAMES FOR YOUR IPADS
To work effectively with your school’s iPads, you’ll need to be able to identify 
them easily, both by looking at the iPads in the flesh (as it were) and by using 
management tools.
To create device names, Apple Configurator lets you use a static value, any of four 
variables in your device, and either or both of two pieces of current information. 
As the static value, you might want to use your school’s name or the department’s 
name. You can not only assign a name to an iPad but also display a name—the 
same name or a different one—on the lock screen.
These are the four variables you can use in names:
•	
Number: This variable enters a number (such as 1) that Apple Configurator 
automatically increments for each device (1, 2, 3, and so on).
•	
Serial Number: This variable enters the iPad’s serial number (which 
is unique).
•	
Type: This variable enters the device type, such as iPad for an iPad.
•	
Capacity: This variable enters the device’s capacity, such as 32 GB 
or 128 GB.
These are the two pieces of information you can use in names:
•	
Port: This enters the device’s current port.
•	
Station: This enters the device’s current station.
By combining the static value, one or more variables, and one or more pieces of 
information, you can assign each iPad a unique name that clearly identifies it.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
224

variables and current information as well as static text to device names.
	
3.	
In the text box, type any static text that you want to have 
at the beginning of the name, such as the school name or 
department name.
	
4.	
Click the Add (+) button to open the pop-up menu. This pop-
up menu contains fields of information you can add to the 
name; Apple Configurator calls these fields tokens.
	
5.	
Click the item you want to add to the name: Number, Serial, 
Type, Capacity, Port, or Station. A blue button containing the 
item appears.
	
6.	
Add other text or items as needed. You can drag an item’s 
button to a different position if necessary.
	
7.	
Click the Rename button. Apple Configurator applies the 
names to the iPads.

Click the Restore button. Apple Configurator restores the iPad 
to factory default settings.
Managing Your Backups
Apple Configurator stores backups in the ~/Library/Application Support/MobileSync/
Backups folder, where the tilde (~) represents your Home folder. Each backup is stored 
in a folder with a 40-character hexadecimal name that Apple Configurator generates 

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
233
automatically. This folder contains 256 folders numbered with sequential hexadecimal names 
(00, 0a, 0b, and so on through ff), three preference list files (Info.plist, Manifest.plist, 
and Status.plist), and a manifest database file (Manifest.db). Each backup can be from 
several hundred megabytes to many gigabytes in size, depending on what the iPad contains.
To get an overview of your backups and to delete any backups you no longer need, 
choose Apple Configurator ➤ Preferences to open the Preferences window, and then 
click the Backups button on the toolbar to display the Backups pane. The Backups pane 
(see Figure 4-27) contains a list of backups that you can sort by clicking the Device, 
Encrypted, or Date column heading. As usual, click the current column heading again to 
reverse the sort direction. To locate a specific backup quickly, you can click in the Search 
box and type a search term.
Figure 4-27.  The Backups pane in Apple Configurator’s Preferences enables you to sort

Viewing Information About Your iPads
List view in the device browser enables you to get an overview of the configuration details 
for multiple iPads quickly. But when you want to zero in on the details of one particular 
iPad, you can use the Quick Look pane or the Info pane instead.
To view details in the Quick Look pane (see Figure 4-29), select the iPad and give the 
Quick Look command in one of these ways:
• 
Keyboard: Press the spacebar or the Cmd-Y keyboard shortcut.
• 
Menu bar: Choose File ➤ Quick Look.
• 
Shortcut menu: Ctrl-click or right-click the iPad and then click the 
Quick Look item.
Figure 4-29.  Open the Quick Look pane when you want to view a brief summary of the 
information for a device

Keyboard: Press Ctrl-I.
• 
Menu bar: Choose File ➤ Get Info.
• 
Shortcut menu: Ctrl-click or right-click the iPad and then click the 
Get Info item.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
236
The Info pane contains a wealth of information broken down into four categories: 
Info, Apps, Profiles, and Console. These categories appear in the sidebar on the left of 
the window, and you can navigate among them as usual by clicking the category you 
want to view.
The Info category (see Figure 4-30) shows the iPad’s name at the top and the 
following three sections of information about the iPad:
• 
About: This section contains details on the device model (such 
as iPad Air 2), capacity (such as 32 GB), state (such as Booted), 
battery charge state (such as 100%), and any tags you’ve applied to 
the device.
Figure 4-30.  The Info category in the Info pane displays detailed information about the 
iPad including technical information and the amount of space used
■
■Note  For a cellular iPad, the CDN, the ICCID, and IMEI also appear in the About section 
of the Info category. The CDN is the phone number for cellular service. The ICCID is the 
Integrated Circuit Card ID, the SIM card’s unique identifier. The IMEI is the International 
Mobile Equipment Identity number, the cellular iPad’s unique identifier.
• 
Tech Info: This section shows the iOS version (such as 10.2 
(14C92)) with an Update button if an update is available, the 
serial number, UDID, and ECID, the MAC addresses for the Wi-Fi

You can select or clear the “Encrypt local backup” check box to 
control whether the backup is encrypted, and click the Change 
Password button to display the dialog for changing the password 
to use for the encryption.
• 
Usage: This section displays a histogram showing how much of 
the iPad’s storage is in use and by which items. For example, a 
blue section at the left end shows the amount of space taken up 
by audio files (such as music).
The Apps category on the Info page displays the third-party apps installed on the 
iPad (see Figure 4-31). You can display the apps either as a collection or as a list by 
clicking the View button on the toolbar and then clicking the Collection item or the List 
item on the pop-up menu, by choosing View ➤ As Collection or View ➤ As List from the 
menu bar, or by pressing Cmd-1 for Collection view or Cmd-2 for List view. Normally, 
List view is the more helpful view, because you can see details such as each app’s version, 
seller, genre, and kind, and you can sort by any column by clicking its heading. To change 
the columns displayed, Ctrl-click or right-click a column heading, and then click the 
appropriate item on the shortcut menu to add a check mark (displaying the column), or 
remove the existing check mark (removing the column from display).
Figure 4-31.  Use the Apps category in the Info pane to see which apps are installed on the 
iPad. List view enables you to see the apps’ version, seller, genre, and kind; you can sort by 
any column by clicking its heading.

■
■Note   To remove an app from the iPad, select the app, press the Delete key, and then 
click the Remove button in the confirmation dialog that opens.
The Profiles category displays the profiles installed on the iPad. You can take three 
main actions here:
• 
Add a profile: If the iPad contains no profile yet, click the Add 
Profiles button, select the profile in the dialog that opens, and 
then click the Add button. If the iPad does contain one or more 
profiles, the Add Profiles button doesn’t appear, but you can add 
other profiles by dragging them in from a Finder window or from 
the desktop.
• 
Remove a profile: Click the profile, press the Delete key or choose 
Edit ➤ Delete from the menu bar, and then click the Remove 
button in the confirmation dialog.
• 
View the profiles as a collection or a list: Click the View button on 
the toolbar, and then click the Collection item or the List item on 
the pop-up menu. Usually, List view is more helpful, because you 
can sort the profiles quickly by clicking the column headings. For 
example, you can click the Removable column heading to sort 
the profiles into those that are removable and those that aren’t. 
You can customize the columns displayed by Ctrl-clicking or 
right-clicking a column heading and then clicking an item on the 
shortcut menu to place a check mark next to it or to remove its 
existing check mark.
The Console category displays the Console pane (see Figure 4-32), which shows a 
list of status updates detailing what is happening with the iPad. You may need to use the 
information in the Console pane to troubleshoot problems that occur with iPads. Apart 
from scrolling up and down to view the information, and selecting information that 
interests you, you can take the following actions using these four button:
• 
Clear: Click this button to clear the information that’s currently 
displayed.
• 
Reload: Click this button to reload the console with the latest data 
from the iPad.
•

Organizing Your iPads in Apple Configurator
To manage your iPads efficiently, you’ll normally want to organize them into different 
administrative groups. For example, you may want to treat iPads issued to staff differently 
from iPads issued to students, or you may want to be able to isolate the iPads that belong 
to each department or to each class.
Understanding the Four Default Groups
Apple Configurator provides the following four default groups that you can access by 
clicking the buttons on the Favorites bar below the toolbar, or by choosing View ➤ All 
Devices, View ➤ Favorites ➤ Supervised, View ➤ Favorites ➤ Unsupervised, or View ➤ 
Favorites ➤ Recovery from the menu bar:
• 
All devices: This group contains all the iOS devices you’ve 
connected to your Mac.
• 
Supervised: This group contains all the connected iOS devices 
that are supervised.
• 
Unsupervised: This group contains all the connected iOS devices 
that are not supervised.
• 
Recovery: This group contains all the connected iOS devices that 
are currently in recovery mode.
Organizing Devices with Tags
Once you’ve customized Apple Configurator’s default tags (see the section “Setting Up 
Your Tags for Tagging iOS Devices,” earlier in this chapter), you can organize your iPads 
by applying tags to them.
To apply a tag, select the iPads to which you want to apply it, click the Tags button on 
the toolbar, and then click the appropriate tag or tags on the Assign tags pop-up menu. If 
the tag you want to apply doesn’t appear in the top part of the Assign tags pop-up menu, 
click the Show All button at the bottom of the pop-up menu to display the hidden tags. 
When you finish applying tags, press the Return key or click outside the pop-up menu.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
243
■
■Note   You can remove a tag by opening the Assign tags pop-up menu, selecting the tag 
(or placing the insertion point after it), and then pressing the Delete key.
After you apply tags to the iPads, you can search by using tags. Click in the Search 
field in the upper-right corner of the Apple Configurator window, start typing the tag 
name, and then click the appropriate item in the Tags section of the Search pop-up menu 
(see Figure 4-35). The tag appears in the Search field as a button, and you can perform the 
search.
Figure 4-35.  To search using a tag, start typing the tag name in the Search box, and then 
click the tag in the Tags section of the Search pop-up menu. You can see tags here to the left 
of the Product Version column.
You can save a search by clicking the Save button at the right end of the Favorites 
bar, typing a name for the saved search in the “Specify the name of your favorites group” 
dialog, and then clicking the Save button. The saved search appears on the Favorites bar, 
where you can click it to perform that search instantly.
■
■Note   To remove a saved search from the Favorites bar, click the button for the saved 
search, drag it into the device window, and drop it there. The button vanishes in a puff of 
smoke.
Preparing iPads for Deployment
Apple Configurator includes a Prepare Assistant feature that helps you prepare iPads and 
other iOS devices for deployment. You can prepare an iPad either manually or by pointing 
it at an MDM solution for automated enrollment. While setting up the preparation 
process, you can choose whether to supervise the iPad or not.
Here, we’ll look first at the process of preparing iPads manually, and then move on 
to pointing an iPad at an MDM solution. The steps for preparing an iPad manually are 
standard, but those for using an MDM solution vary depending on the MDM.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
246
	
7.	
Select the “Supervise devices” check box if you want to 
supervise the iPad or iPads. Normally, you’ll want to 
supervise them in a school setting so that you have in-depth 
management capabilities.
	
8.	
If you select the “Supervise devices” check box, select the 
“Allow devices to pair with other computers” check box if you 
want to allow users to pair the iPads with other computers 
or just with Apple Configurator hosts. For example, if you’re 
preparing iPads to issue to students for individual use, you 
may want to allow the students to pair the iPads with their PCs 
or Macs. But if you’re preparing iPads that will remain in the 
classroom, you likely won’t want them to be able to pair with 
other computers.
	
9.	
Click the Next button. The Assign to Organization pane 
appears (see Figure 4-39).
Figure 4-39.  In the Assign to Organization pane, select the organization that will supervise

Working with Configuration Profiles
Apple Configurator enables you to create configuration profiles to configure iOS 
automatically. A configuration profile is an XML file that contains predefined settings and 
authentication credentials, such as digital certificates. The settings and credentials are 
contained in payloads that you define. For example, you can add a restrictions payload to 
implement restrictions to what the user can do, add a Wi-Fi payload to load the settings 
for one or more Wi-Fi networks onto the iPad, or add a Certificates payload to install 
digital certificates on the iPad.
You can apply various security measures to a profile:
• 
Encryption and signing: You can encrypt and sign a configuration 
profile to make it work with only a specific iOS device.
• 
Locking: You can lock a profile to a device with a password. 
Removing the profile then requires the password—or erasing the 
device entirely and reinstalling iOS.
• 
Account fixing: You can lock an account to a device by configuring 
the account via a profile. For example, you can use a profile to 
configure an Exchange ActiveSync account on an iPad. Once 
you’ve done that, the account is fixed on the iPad unless you 
remove the profile.
CREATING SEPARATE PROFILES FOR CONSTANT 
SETTINGS AND CHANGING SETTINGS
As you’ll see in this section, a profile can contain a huge number of settings—
everything from General settings, such as whether the profile can be removed from 
the device, to Web Clips settings, which create shortcuts on the Home screen to 
specific web pages. By working your way through the different categories in the 
sidebar in Apple Configurator, you can add payloads for each category that you need 
the profile to contain.
It’s easy enough to put all the settings for an iPad into a single profile, but you may find 
it more efficient in the long run to create multiple profiles that you can apply singly or in 
groups, as needed. Usually, it’s best to create a separate profile (or multiple profiles) for 
settings that largely remain constant and another profile (or multiple profiles) for settings 
that change frequently. You can then update the profiles for settings that change 
frequently without needing to change the profiles for settings that remain constant.
Settings categories that remain constant typically include Restrictions, Domains, 
Global HTTP Proxy, Passcode, Wi-Fi, and the various account types—Calendar, 
Subscribed Calendars, Contacts, Exchange ActiveSync, Google Account, LDAP, Mail, 
and macOS Server Account. Settings categories that typically change more often 
include Web Clips, Certificates, and VPN. Some categories, such as AirPrint and 
AirPlay, may fall into either settings group—or both.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
252
Starting a New Profile and Configuring the General 
Settings
To get started creating a new profile in Apple Configurator, choose File ➤ New Profile 
from the menu bar or press Cmd-N. A new window opens for working on the profile. At 
first, the window is called Untitled – Edited.
■
■Tip   When Apple Configurator is running, you can also start a new profile by  
Ctrl-clicking or right-clicking the Apple Configurator icon on the Dock and then clicking New 
Profile on the shortcut menu.
Figure 4-41 shows the profile window. As you can see, the window has two panes. 
The left pane is the sidebar, which contains the list of categories of settings. The right 
pane, the main pane, contains the settings for the currently selected category.
Figure 4-41.  Starting to create a new profile in Apple Configurator

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
253
Normally, it’s a good idea to save the profile immediately, and to keep saving it as 
you create your payloads. Apple Configurator complains if you haven’t added a payload 
to the profile, but you can override this protest. Follow these steps to save the profile:
	
1.	
Press Cmd-S or choose File ➤ Save from the menu bar. A Save 
sheet opens.
	
2.	
Type the profile name in the Save As box. Apple Configurator 
suggests the name in the Name box.
	
3.	
In the Tags box, apply any tags needed. For example, if you 
have tags for different departments, apply the appropriate 
department tag.
	
4.	
Specify the location by using the Where pop-up menu or 
by clicking the button to the right of the Save As box and 
browsing to the appropriate folder.
	
5.	
Click the Save button. Apple Configurator displays a dialog 
warning you that the profile contains no payloads and can’t be 
installed on devices (see Figure 4-42).
Figure 4-42.  If Apple Configurator warns you that the profile contains no payloads, click 
the Save Anyway button
	
6.	
Click the Save Anyway button. Apple Configurator saves the 
profile, and the name appears at the top of the profile window. 
You can then configure the payloads for the profile.
These are the settings you can configure in the General category:
• 
Name: Type the name that you want the iOS device (we’ll assume 
it’s an iPad) to display to identify the profile. For example, for 
the standard iPad profile for a student at Notional Academy, you 
might use a name such as Notional Academy iPad profile for 
student.
• 
Identifier: Type the name to identify the profile on the iPad. Apple 
Configurator suggests a default name based on the name of your 
Mac, but you may prefer to use something more descriptive. For 
example, instead of an identifier such as macserver1.8D0328D6-
0416-4C61-B3B8-216DEC8AEB46, you might use a descriptive 
name such as macserver1.students.general.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
254
• 
Organization: Type the name of your organization—for example, 
Notional Academy. This is an optional field, but normally it’s 
helpful to fill it in.
• 
Description: Type a short description of what the profile is for and 
what it does. The Description field too is an optional field, but 
including it is usually a good idea.
• 
Consent Message: Type any message you want the iPad to display 
to the user as a prompt during the installation of the profile. For 
example, you might enter a message telling the user that they 
must install the profile in order to be able to connect the iPad to 
the school’s Wi-Fi network and to the Internet.
• 
Security: In this pop-up menu, choose whether and (if so) when 
the user can remove the profile from the iPad. Your choices are 
Always, With Authorization, and Never. If you’re keeping the 
iPads under your control, you’ll normally choose either With 
Authorization or Never here.
• 
Automatically Remove Profile: In this pop-up menu, choose 
whether and (if so) when you want the profile to be removed 
automatically from the iPad. Your choices are Never, On date, and 
After interval. The Never setting gives you the tightest control, 
whereas the On date setting and the After interval setting enable 
you to apply a profile that lasts only until a specific date or for a 
specific interval.
Moving Along to the Next Payload
Once you finish configuring settings for the General category, go to the sidebar and click 
the next category you want to configure. If the category is one you haven’t configured yet, 
the profile window displays a box showing the category’s name, a brief summary of what 
it does, and a Configure button (see Figure 4-43). Click the Configure button to display 
the settings available for the category.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
255
The following subsections explain each of the remaining categories in turn.
■
■Note   As you move from one category to another, you may find that the category you 
leave displays a badge (a rounded rectangle containing a number) to its right. A yellow 
badge indicates an optional setting that you’ve left unset or for which you’ve specified an 
unusable value. A red badge indicates a required setting that you’ve left unset or specified 
an unusable value. Apple Configurator warns you about any red badges when you give the 
command to save the profile.
Configuring a Restrictions Payload in the Profile
The Restrictions category enables you to configure a huge swathe of settings, which this 
section explains. You click the three tabs—Functionality, Apps, and Media Content—at 
the top of the Restrictions category to choose the subcategory of restrictions settings you 
want to work with.
Figure 4-43.  For any category you haven’t yet configured, click the Configure button in the 
summary box to display the settings available

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator

Choosing Functionality Restrictions Settings for a Profile
Normally, you’ll want to start by working on the Functionality tab within the Restrictions 
category. Figure 4-44 shows the top part of the Functionality tab.
Figure 4-44.  Configure the settings on the Functionality tab in the Restrictions category 
in a profile in Apple Configurator to specify which functionality is available and which is

• 
Block pop-ups: Select this check box to apply pop-up blocking 
in Safari. This is usually a good idea. (You can control pop-up 
blocking manually by setting the Block Pop-Ups switch in the 
General box in Safari’s preferences.) This check box is available 
only when the “Allow use of Safari” check box is selected.
• 
Accept cookies: In this pop-up menu, choose how to handle 
cookies that websites try to set. Your choices are Never, From 
current website only, From websites I visit, and Always.

apps the user can run

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
265
WHICH COOKIES SHOULD YOU LET THE IPADS ACCEPT?
You may find it hard to decide among the four choices—Never, From current website 
only, From websites I visit, and Always—in the “Accept cookies” pop-up menu on 
the Apps tab of the Restrictions category. Cookies have a bad reputation, but many 
websites rely on them, so it’s not usually wise to select the Never item, because it 
may prevent websites from working correctly. The “From current website only” item 
also tends to be too restrictive. On the other hand, the Always item, which allows 
cookies both from sites that the user visits and third-party cookies attached to those 
sites, is seldom a good choice, because third-party cookies are typically used for 
advertising and tracking users from site to site.
Normally, the best choice is the “From websites I visit” item, which allows cookies 
from the sites that the user visits (also called first-party cookies) but not the third-
party cookies.
• 
Restrict App Usage (supervised only): In this pop-up menu, choose 
“Allow all apps,” “Do not allow some apps,” or “Only allow some 
apps,” as needed. If you choose “Do not allow some apps” or 
“Only allow some apps,” add each app to the list box by clicking 
the Add (+) button, using the “Choose an app” dialog to identify 
the app, and then clicking the Choose button. If you add an app 
that you want to remove, click the app in the list box, and then 
click the Remove (–) button. The “Choose an app” dialog shows 
both system apps and apps on the App Store.
Choosing Media Content Restrictions Settings for a Profile
Next, click the Media Content tab in the Restrictions category to display its controls (see 
Figure 4-46). On this tab, you can configure the following settings:
• 
Ratings region: In this pop-up menu, choose the country or region 
whose ratings system you want to use. For example, choose 
United States.
• 
Movies: In this pop-up menu, choose Allow All Movies, Don’t 
Allow Movies, or one of the available ratings. For example, for the 
United States region, you can choose G, PG, PG-13, R, or NC-17.
• 
TV Shows: In this pop-up menu, choose Allow All TV Shows, 
Don’t Allow TV Shows, or one of the available ratings.
• 
Apps: In this pop-up menu, choose Allow All Apps, Don’t Allow 
Apps, or one of the age ratings, such as 12+.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator

• 
Allow playback of explicit music, podcasts & iTunes U media: Clear 
this check box if you want to prevent the Music, Podcasts, and 
iTunes U apps from playing back media marked as Explicit.
• 
Allow explicit sexual content in iBooks Store: Clear this check box 
if you want the iBooks Store to hide books that are marked as 
containing explicit sexual content.
Figure 4-46.  On the Media Content tab of the Restrictions category, you can choose the 
ratings region, specify the allowed content ratings for movies, TV shows, and apps, and 
decide whether to let the iPad play explicit content
Configuring a Domains Payload in the Profile
Apple Configurator enables you to configure unmarked e-mail domains, managed Safari 
web domains, and Safari Password Autofill domains in a profile. Here’s what these three 
types of domains are:
• 
Unmarked e-mail domain: A domain you specify as being one 
from which the iPad should receive e-mail without marking its 
address. The Mail app marks the e-mail address of any message 
coming from a domain that you haven’t specified as an unmarked 
e-mail domain.
• 
Managed Safari web domain: A domain you specify as being one 
that Safari should consider to contain managed documents.
• 
Safari Password Autofill domain: A domain for which Safari’s 
Password Autofill feature can save passwords.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
267
To configure domains, click the Domains category in the sidebar to display the 
Domains pane. If the Configure button appears, as it does until you start configuring 
domains, click it to display the Domains controls. As you can see in Figure 4-47, this 
contains three boxes: the Unmarked E-mail Domains box, the Managed Safari Web 
Domains box, and the Safari Password Autofill Domains (supervised only) box. Below 
each box is an Add (+) button that you can click to add a domain and a Remove (–) button 
that you can click to remove the selected domain.
Figure 4-47.  The Domains category enables you to specify unmarked e-mail domains, 
managed Safari web domains, and Safari Password Autofill domains

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
268
Configuring a Global HTTP Proxy Payload in the Profile
The Global HTTP Proxy category enables you to specify a proxy server that the iPad will 
use for all HTTP traffic. For example, your school may use a proxy server to restrict access 
to unapproved websites and to cache data for approved websites so that it can return 
their data more rapidly to clients and reduce use of Internet bandwidth.
To set up the global HTTP proxy payload, click the Global HTTP Proxy category in 
the sidebar, and then click the Configure button to display the Global HTTP Proxy pane. 
Figure 4-48 shows the Global HTTP Proxy pane for a manual proxy server.
Figure 4-48.  In the Global HTTP Proxy pane, you can either specify the proxy server’s 
details manually, as shown here, or by directing the iPad to the URL of a proxy server that 
contains a proxy auto-configuration (PAC) file
Go to the Proxy Type pop-up menu and choose Manual or Auto, as needed:
• 
Manual: Choose Manual for a proxy server whose details you’ll 
specify in the pane.
• 
Auto: Choose Auto if you want to direct the iPad to a URL to 
download a proxy auto-configuration (PAC) file instead.
If you choose Manual in the Proxy Type pop-up menu, configure the following 
settings to specify the details:
• 
Proxy Server and Port: Type the hostname or IP address of the 
proxy server in the left box and the port number (such as 80) in 
the right box.
• 
Username: If the proxy server is set to require a username and 
password, type it in this box.
• 
Password: Type the password for the username in this box.
• 
Allow bypassing proxy to access captive networks: Select this check 
box to allow the iPads to connect to known wireless networks 
without going through the proxy server.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
269
If you choose Auto in the Proxy Type pop-up menu, configure the following settings 
in the Global HTTP Proxy pane, whose contents change (see Figure 4-49) when you select 
Auto:
• 
Proxy PAC URL: Type or paste the URL at which the PAC file is 
located.
• 
Allow direct connection if PAC is unreachable: Select this check 
box if you want the iPad to connect directly to URLs if it can’t 
obtain the PAC. Having the iPad connect directly can be a good 
idea, because doing so enables the iPad to ride out temporary 
glitches in the system, but it may hide from you the fact that the 
proxy server isn’t working.
• 
Allow bypassing proxy to access captive networks: As for a proxy 
server you configure manually, select this check box to allow 
the iPads to connect to known wireless networks without going 
through the proxy server.
Figure 4-49.  For automatic proxy configuration, choose Auto in the Proxy Type pop-up 
menu, and then enter in the Proxy PAC URL box the URL at which the iPad will find the 
proxy auto-configuration (PAC) file
Configuring a Content Filter Payload in the Profile
The Content Filter feature enables you to apply one of three types of filter to the iPads:
• 
Plugin (Third Party App): You can configure a third-party filter 
service to provide the filtering. If your school uses a compatible 
third-party filtering service, you’ll likely want to use it.
• 
Built-in: Limit Adult Content: This built-in filter lets you list 
specific URLs that are permitted and URLs that are blocked. The 
filter automatically block sites that identify themselves as having 
adult content, but you can block additional sites as needed. Use 
this filter type if your school doesn’t have a compatible third-party 
filtering service and your students will need to browse the Web to 
research topics.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
270
• 
Built-in: Specific Websites Only: This built-in filter lets you list 
specific URLs that are allowed. These URLs appear as bookmarks 
and are the only sites the iPad can access. This filter type is good 
for providing students with a short list of authorized URLs and 
preventing them from going to other sites.
■
■Caution   Each content filter type works only for supervised iOS devices.
To set up a Content Filter payload, click the Content Filter category in the sidebar, 
and then click the Configure button that appears at first in the Content Filter pane. The 
Content Filter pane then displays the remaining controls.
Configuring the Built-in: Limit Adult Content Filter
If you want to use the Built-in: Limit Adult Content filter, open the Filter Type pop-up 
menu and click the Built-in: Limit Adult Content item. You’ll see the controls shown in 
Figure 4-50.
Figure 4-50.  The Limit Adult Content filter enables you to add a list of specifically 
permitted URLs and a list of extra blacklisted URLs to the list the filter already contains

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
271
In the Permitted URLs box, set up the list of URLs that you want to permit even if the 
filter would normally block them. Click the Add (+) button to add a new line, type or paste 
the URL, and then press the Return key.
■
■Note   Each URL must start with either http:// or https://.
Next, go to the Blacklisted URLs box and set up the list of URLs you want to disallow, 
even if the filter would normally allow them.
Configuring the Built-in: Specific Websites Only Filter
If you want to allow users to visit only specific websites, open the Filter Type pop-up 
menu and click the Built-in: Specific Websites Only item. The Content Filter pane displays 
the controls for specifying the websites (see Figure 4-51).
Figure 4-51.  The Specific Websites Only content filter enables you to limit the iPad to 
reaching only the websites you specify. You create a bookmark for each website, giving 
quick access to it.
You can then create the list of allowed websites in the Specific Websites box like this:
	
1.	
Click the Add (+) button to start creating a new entry.
	
2.	
Type or paste the URL in the URL column.
	
3.	
Type the display name for the bookmark in the Name column.
	
4.	
If you want to put the bookmark in a folder, type the folder 
name and path in the Bookmark column. For example, type  
/Favorites/ to put the bookmark in the Favorites folder.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
272
Configuring a Third-Party Filter
Apple Configurator also enables you to set the iPad to use a third-party filter. To do so, 
open the Filter Type pop-up menu in the Content Filter pane, and then click the Plugin 
(Third Party App) item. The Content Filter pane displays the controls for configuring the 
third-party filter (see Figure 4-52).
Figure 4-52.  The Plugin (Third Party App) filter type enables you to direct the iPad to use a 
third-party filtering service
■
■Note  If the third-party filter requires the iPad to use a digital certificate to authenticate 
itself with the filtering service, add the certificate to the profile’s Certificates payload before 
setting up the Content Filter payload. You can then choose the certificate in the Certificate 
pop-up menu in the Content Filter payload.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
273
Configure the controls on the Content Filter screen following the instructions from 
the provider of the filtering service. The following two fields are required:
• 
Filter Name: In this text box, type the name you want the app itself 
and the device to show for the filter.
• 
Identifier: In this text box, type the bundle identifier for the filter app.
All the other fields and controls are optional, but you’ll typically need to fill in values 
or choose settings for some of them.
If the filtering service provider requires you to use a digital certificate to authenticate 
the devices that use the service, open the Certificate pop-up menu and choose the 
appropriate certificate that you’ve already added to the Certificates payload for this 
profile.
Configuring a Certificates Payload in the Profile
The Certificates category in Apple Configurator enables you to add one or more payloads, 
each containing a digital certificate in the PKCS1 format or the PKCS12 format, to the 
profile. You can use the digital certificates for authentication to services such as Wi-
Fi networks, VPNs, or content filtering services. A digital certificate enables you to 
authenticate a device securely without the user having to type a complicated password or 
passcode.
To get started adding certificates, click the Certificates category in the sidebar, and 
then click the Configure button in the Certificates pane. Unlike with most of the other 
categories, the hidden controls don’t appear at first; instead, a dialog for selecting the 
certificate opens. Navigate to the folder that contains the certificate, click the certificate 
file, and then click the Open button.
The certificate’s details then appear in the Certificate pane (see Figure 4-53), and you 
can complete the payload by entering the certificate name and password:
• 
Certificate Name: In this box, edit the existing name (which 
comes from the certificate file’s name) as needed or type a new 
name. For example, you might want to enter a description of the 
certificate (such as Certificate for VPN Connections) rather than 
the filename.
• 
Password: In this box, type the password that protects the 
certificate file. This is the password set in the certificate file itself.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
274
Once you’ve added one certificate payload to the profile, you can click the Add (+) 
button in the upper-right corner of the Certificate pane to add another certificate payload.
Configuring a Passcode Payload in the Profile
The Passcode category (see Figure 4-54) enables you to enforce your choice of password 
policies on the iPad. Your options include choosing whether to allow simple passcodes 
(such as 1111 or 1234), setting the minimum password length, specifying the maximum 
time before the device automatically locks, and forcing periodic password changes.
Figure 4-53.  In the Certificate pane, rename the certificate with a descriptive name if 
needed, and type the password that protects the certificate file

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
275
These are the settings you can configure in the Passcode pane:
• 
Allow simple value: Select this check box if you want to let users 
use simple password values, such as 9999, 1234, or 9876. iOS bars 
simple passwords by default because they’re too easy to crack, 
but you may find them convenient for iPads that remain in the 
classroom.
• 
Require alphanumeric value: Select this check box if you want to 
force users to use alphanumeric characters in the passcode. This 
setting is good for enterprise security but is likely overkill for iPads 
used by students in the classroom. Alphanumeric passcodes take 
more effort to enter than numeric passcodes, because the user 
must switch among keyboards, so you probably won’t want to use 
them unless the user can normally unlock the iPad using Touch ID.
• 
Minimum passcode length: In this pop-up menu, select the 
minimum passcode length. You can either choose no minimum 
(the -- setting) or a value between 1 and 16. For iPads that will 
remain in the classroom, or at least within the school, four 
characters may be an effective minimum. For iPads that leave 
the school, use the iOS default of six characters as a workable 
minimum unless you need tighter security—in which case, use a 
higher value, such as 10.
Figure 4-54.  Configure a passcode payload to apply your choice of passcode policities to 
the iPad

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
276
• 
Minimum number of complex characters: For enterprise-level 
security, open this pop-up menu and choose the minimum 
number of non-alphanumeric characters the passcode must 
contain. Your choices are 1, 2, 3, and 4. For in-school use, leave 
this pop-up menu set to no minimum (the -- setting).
• 
Maximum passcode age (1–730 days, or none): If you need to 
force users to change password periodically, enter the maximum 
permitted password age in days in this box. For normally use, 
leave this option set to no maximum age (the -- setting).
SHOULD YOU FORCE PERIODIC PASSCODE CHANGES?
Forcing users—and administrators!—to change passwords or passcodes regularly 
used to be staple advice, but most security experts now recommend against it. 
Many users responded by creating pattern-based password sequences (such as 
PwNov017!, PwDec017!, and so on) that scraped over the security hurdles but were 
easy to predict if seen or even hinted at.
Current advice is to not force password changes by setting a maximum password 
age, but to require passwords that are complex enough to be hard to crack. If you 
ever have reason to believe that a passcode has been compromised, you must 
change it immediately.
• 
Maximum Auto-Lock: In this pop-up menu, choose the maximum 
length of time the user can set for the Auto-Lock setting on the 
Display & Brightness screen in the Settings app. You can choose 
no maximum (the -- setting) or 1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes,  
4 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, or 15 minutes.
■
■Tip  For iPads that go outside the school, set a short Maximum Auto-Lock setting, 
such as 1 or 2 minutes, to reduce the risk of the iPad being lost or stolen with its screen 
unlocked. For iPads that stay within the school, choosing the best Maximum Auto-Lock 
setting for your school’s iPads is trickier. On the one hand, setting a maximum of even 15 
minutes is useful for making sure the iPad doesn’t get left with its screen on, running down 
the battery. On the other hand, having the iPads lock automatically during pauses in a lesson 
can cause disruptions, especially if the students don’t know the passcodes to unlock them. 
You can mitigate this problem by setting the Maximum grace period for device lock to a 
modest interval, such as 5 minutes or 15 minutes.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
277
• 
Passcode history (1–50 passcodes, or none): In this box, you can 
enter the number of previous passcodes that you want the iPad 
to retain and block from future use. Leave the box blank if you 
want to allow users to reuse their existing passcodes or recent 
passcodes.
• 
Maximum grace period for device lock: In this box, enter the 
length of time that the user can unlock the iPad without having to 
enter the passcode. Your choices are no maximum (the -- setting), 
Immediately, 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 hour, or 4 hours. 
This is the equivalent of the Require Passcode setting on the 
Touch ID & Passcode screen in the Settings app, although that 
setting works only when the iPad Unlock switch in the Use Touch 
ID For box is set to Off. (Setting the iPad Unlock switch to On 
makes the iPad set the Require Password setting to Immediately.)
• 
Maximum number of failed attempts: In this pop-up menu, you 
can set the maximum number of failed passcode entries to allow 
before erasing the iPad’s contents. This is equivalent to setting 
the Erase Data switch on the Touch ID & Passcode screen in the 
Settings app, except that the Erase Data feature uses a set value of 
10 failed attempts; with the Maximum number of failed attempts 
setting, you can use a lower value if necessary.
■
■Caution  The Maximum number of failed attempts setting is highly useful for enterprise 
devices that contain sensitive information, because it enables you to ensure that the iPad 
erases its contents after the specified number of failed password attempts, which you 
can set as low as 2 if you need hair-trigger wiping. You’re less likely to need this setting 
for iPads in schools; even if your school’s students have iPads as personal devices, you’re 
probably better off requiring strong passcodes than enabling automatic erasure that can be 
triggered by students larking around or by a sibling’s curiosity.
Configuring a Wi-Fi Payload in the Profile
The Wi-Fi category enables you to create payloads that set up Wi-Fi networks 
automatically on the iPad. This is a convenient way of making sure the iPad can connect 
to all the appropriate networks at your school.
To get started configuring the Wi-Fi payloads, click the Wi-Fi category in the sidebar, 
and then click the Configure button in the Wi-Fi pane to display the Wi-Fi controls 
(shown in Figure 4-55 with some settings chosen).

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
278
UNDERSTANDING HOTSPOT, CAPTIVE, AND PRIVATE 
NETWORKS
To make the most of iOS’s networking capabilities, you need to understand the 
terms for different types of Wi-Fi networks and how iOS handles them.
First, a captive network is a network that, when a device connects to it, forces the 
device to display a particular web page, such as a login page. For example, when 
you go to connect an iPad to a captive network, Safari opens automatically and 
displays the login page so that you can provide your credentials and start using 
the network. When an iOS device connects to a captive network, the iOS Captive 
Network Assistant runs behind the scenes, managing the login process.
Second, iOS divides networks into two major categories—hotspot networks and 
private networks:
•	
Hotspot network: A Wi-Fi network that uses the HS2.0/Passpoint 
standard, captive network, or EAP-SIM network. (EAP-SIM is 
the acronym for Extensible Authentication Protocol Subscriber 
Identity Module, a standard for authenticating a device by using its 
Subscriber Identity Module card, usually called a SIM card.)
Figure 4-55.  Use the Wi-Fi pane to configure each Wi-Fi network you want the iPad to be 
able to use

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
279
•	
Private network: Any Wi-Fi network that isn’t a hotspot, including 
iOS Personal Hotspot networks.
When trying to connect to a Wi-Fi network, iOS uses the network types in the 
following order:
1.	
The private network it used most recently
2.	
Another private network
3.	
A hotspot network
This is probably what you would expect, especially if you’ve used an iOS device 
extensively—but what if multiple networks are available? In this case, iOS prefers 
still private networks to hotspot networks, but it ranks each network type by the kind 
of security it uses. Specifically, iOS chooses the networks in the following order:
1.	
A private network that uses EAP security
2.	
A private network that uses WPA security
3.	
A private network that uses WEP security
4.	
A private network that uses no security (an unsecured or open 
network)
5.	
A hotspot network that uses HS2.0/Passpoint
6.	
A hotspot network that uses EAP security
7.	
A hotspot network that uses WPA security
8.	
A hotspot network that uses WEP security
9.	
A hotspot network that uses no security (an unsecured or open 
hotspot) 
Entering the Essential Details for the Wi-Fi Network
To set up a Wi-Fi network, start by filling in the essential details:
• 
Service Set identifier (SSID): Type the network’s SSID (its name).
• 
Hidden Network: Select this check box if the Wi-Fi network is 
hidden. Hidden means that the network isn’t broadcasting its 
SSID; this is also called a closed network.
• 
Auto Join: Select this check if the iPad should automatically 
connect to this network when the network is in range.
• 
Disable Captive Network Detection: Select this check box to 
disable the Captive Network Assistant, which otherwise runs 
automatically when the iPad tries to connect to a captive network.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
280
■
■Note  You’ll see that the Proxy Setup pop-up menu and the Security Type pop-up menu 
also appear. We’ll get to these controls a little later in the chapter.
• 
Network Type: In this pop-up menu, choose the Standard item  
for a regular Wi-Fi network. Choose the Passpoint item for a  
Wi-Fi hotspot that uses the HS2.0/Passpoint standard. Choose the 
Legacy Hotspot item for a Wi-Fi hotspot that uses an older Wi-Fi 
standard.
• 
Fast Lane QoS Marking: In this pop-up menu, choose the Do 
not restrict QoS marking item if you want to disable restrictions 
on Quality of Service (QoS) marking. Choose the Restrict QoS 
marking item if you want to restrict QoS marking.
UNDERSTANDING QOS AND QOS MARKING
In computer networking, Quality of Service (QoS) means prioritizing traffic from 
apps, data types, or users deemed to be more important or time-critical over 
less important or less time-critical apps, data types, or users. For example, an 
administrator might assign high priority to an app that plays a video stream, 
because watching streaming video doesn’t work if the data doesn’t arrive in time or 
sufficiently in sequence. Similarly, Internet audio calls might receive high priority to 
avoid the audio breaking up.
By contrast, e-mail would typically receive low priority, because a modest delay in 
data transmission doesn’t usually much matter to an e-mail message; nor does the 
order in which most of the data packets in the e-mail message arrive matter, as long 
as all the packets arrive in the end so that the e-mail client app can reassemble the 
message. So an administrator might assign e-mail to the best-effort queue (which 
gets data transferred once priority traffic allows) or the background queue (a lower 
priority still).
Quality of Service (QoS) marking lets an administrator prioritize traffic according to 
how important it is that the traffic arrive in real time. On some wireless networks 
that run on Cisco equipment, an administrator can configure a feature called fast 
lane that enables devices running iOS 10 or a later version to detect that the device 
can request special treatment for apps that use QoS marking. In brief, fast lane lets 
an iOS device use QoS marking on some apps while not using it on other apps. The 
Fast Lane QoS Marking pop-up menu in the Wi-Fi pane lets you choose whether to 
restrict QoS marking or disable restrictions on QoS marking.

Setting Up Custom Proxying for This Wi-Fi Network
If you need to set up proxying for this Wi-Fi network that’s different from any proxying 
you set in the Global HTTP Proxy category, open the Proxy Setup pop-up menu and click 
the Manual item or the Automatic item, as needed. The Wi-Fi pane displays controls for 
setting up the proxying.
If you choose the Manual item in the Proxy Setup pop-up menu, fill in the following 
fields:
• 
Server and Port: Type the hostname or IP address of the proxy 
server in the left box and the port number (such as 80) in the right 
box. Both server and port are required.
• 
Username: If the proxy server is set to require a username and 
password, you can type it in this box.
• 
Password: If you enter a username, type the password for the 
username in this box.
If you choose the Automatic item in the Proxy Setup pop-up menu, configure these 
two settings:
• 
Proxy Server URL: Enter the URL at which the iPad will find the 
server and proxy auto-configuration (PAC) file.
• 
Allow direct connection if PAC is unreachable: Select this check 
box to let the iPad connect directly to URLs if it can’t obtain the 
PAC. As with the same setting in the Global HTTP Proxy category, 
letting the iPad connect directly is convenient, because it enables 
the iPad to use the network even if the proxy server is down, but 
it may mean that users can access sites the proxy server would 
normally prevent them from accessing.
Creating Another Wi-Fi Payload
After you finish setting up one Wi-Fi payload, you can click the Add (+) button in the 
upper-right corner of the Wi-Fi pane to start creating another Wi-Fi payload. A second 
Wi-Fi pane appears below the first Wi-Fi pane, and you can fill in the details of the 
network.
Configuring VPN Payloads in the Profile
The VPN category enables you to add one or more payloads of settings that enable the 
iPad to connect to virtual private networks. iOS supports around a dozen types of VPNs, 
which is more than we can cover fully here, but we’ll look at the settings for several of the 
most widely used types of VPNs.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
282
■
■Note   A virtual private network (VPN—the abbreviation also stands for virtual private 
networking, the umbrella term for the technology) enables you to connect two computers 
or devices securely using encryption across an unsecure network. For example, you can 
use a VPN to enable students or teachers to connect securely to the school’s network from 
outside the school (such as from home). You would get the details of the VPN from the VPN’s 
administrator.
To get started creating VPN payloads, click the VPN item in the sidebar, and then 
click the Configure button in the VPN pane. The controls for setting up the VPN payload 
appear. The controls change depending on which VPN type you select in the Connection 
Type pop-up menu, and we’ll look at several examples in the following sections. For now, 
configure these two settings:
• 
Connection Name: Type the name you want the iPad to display for

289
Configuring Another VPN Payload
After you finish configuring one VPN payload, you can click the Add (+) button in the 
upper-right corner of the VPN pane to start configuring another VPN payload. A second 
VPN pane appears below the first VPN pane, and you can enter the details of the VPN 
using the same techniques.
Configuring an AirPlay Payload in the Profile
The AirPlay category lets you create a payload containing passwords to enable an iPad 
to connect to password-protected AirPlay devices. If you want to restrict the iPad to 
connecting to only specific AirPlay devices, you can set up a whitelist of those devices, 
identified by their MAC addresses.
■
■Tip   To find the MAC address of an Apple TV, choose Settings ➤ General ➤ Network 
on the Apple TV and look at the Wi-Fi Address readout or the Ethernet Address readout on 
the Network screen. To find the MAC address or addresses of an AirPort Express, run AirPort 
Utility on a Mac, and then click the AirPort Express to display a pop-up window that shows 
the network name, IP address, and other information. Hold the pointer over the AirPort 
Express’ name at the top of the pop-up window to display a second pop-up window that 
contains the model number and the MAC address for the Ethernet interface, the 2.4 GHz Wi-
Fi interface, and the 5 GHz Wi-Fi interface.
To start creating an AirPlay payload, click the AirPlay category in the sidebar, and 
then click the Configure button in the AirPlay pane. The controls for configuring the 
payload appear in the AirPlay pane (shown in Figure 4-60 with some settings chosen).

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator

2.	
In the Connect area, select the Undiscoverable option button 
if the AirPlay device isn’t discoverable via the Bonjour 
network protocol. If the device is discoverable via Bonjour, 
select the Discoverable (Bonjour) option button instead; 
when you do this, a list box opens showing the available 
AirPlay devices.
	
3.	
If you selected the Undiscoverable option button, type 
the device’s name in the Name box. If you selected the 
Discoverable (Bonjour) option button, click the device in the 
list box.
	
4.	
Type the device’s password in the Password box.
	
5.	
Click the Save button. The device appears in the Passwords 
box in the AirPlay pane.
To add a device to the Whitelist box, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Click the Add (+) button under the Whitelist box. Apple 
Configurator adds a new line to the box.
	
2.	
Type the MAC address of the AirPlay device. Type just the 
letters and numbers, not the colons (or the hyphens that some 
devices show instead of colons).
	
3.	
Press the Return key. Apple Configurator validates the MAC 
address and separates its groups with colons.
Configuring an AirPrint Payload in the Profile
The AirPrint category lets you set up AirPrint printers for the iPad to use. Once the profile 
is installed, the iPad knows where to find the printers and can print to them without 
further setup.
To start creating an AirPrint payload, click the AirPrint category in the sidebar, and 
then click the Configure button in the AirPrint pane. The controls for configuring the 
payload appear in the AirPlay pane (shown in Figure 4-62 with one printer already added).

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
292
Follow these steps to add a printer to the list in the Printers box:
	
1.	
Click the Add (+) button on the left below the Printers box. 
A dialog for adding a printer opens. Figure 4-63 shows this 
dialog with settings chosen.
Figure 4-62.  Set up a payload of AirPrint-capable printers in the AirPrint pane
Figure 4-63.  In this dialog, open the Configure printer pop-up menu and see if the printer 
appears. If so, select it, and then select the IP address in the Host Name or IP Address pop-
up menu; if not, enter the IP address and the resource path manually.
	
2.	
Open the Configure printer pop-up menu and see if the 
printer you want to add appears on it. If so, select the menu 
item for the printer. If not, select the Manually item.
	
3.	
If you selected a printer in step 2, open the Host Name or IP 
Address pop-up menu and select the IP address for the printer 
(it may be selected already). If you selected the Manually item 
in step 2, type the printer’s IP address in the Host Name or IP 
Address box (this control switches between being a pop-up 
menu and a text box). See the nearby sidebar “Getting the 
IP Address and Resource Path for an AirPort Printer” for 
information on getting the IP address and resource path.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
293
	
4.	
In the “Resource path” box, enter the resource path for the 
printer. If you selected the printer in step 2, the resource path 
should be entered in this box already.
	
5.	
Click the Save button. The dialog closes, and the printer 
appears in the AirPrint pane.
■
■Note   If the Save button is unavailable when you’re adding a printer manually, the 
problem is usually that you’ve entered the wrong IP address or resource path for a printer. 
Double-check your entries and correct any mistakes.
GETTING THE IP ADDRESS AND RESOURCE PATH FOR 
AN AIRPRINT PRINTER
To find the IP address and resource path for an AirPrint printer, follow these steps on 
a Mac connected to the appropriate network:
1.	
Click the Launchpad icon on the Dock to display the Launchpad 
screen.
2.	
Type term to display apps containing those letters.
3.	
Click the Terminal icon. A Terminal window opens.
4.	
Type ippfind and press the Return key. Terminal displays a list 
of printers found, such as the following line, where the first part 
(BRN30055C504EFA.local) is the printer name and the second 
part (/ipp/printer) is the resource path.
ipp://BRN30055C504EFA.local.:631/ipp/printer
5.	
Type ping –c 5 followed by the printer name, and then press 
the Return key. (The –c 5 parameter tells the ping command to 
send five packets; if you don’t specify this parameter, ping keeps 
sending packets until you press Ctrl-C to stop it.) Terminal returns 
the printer’s IP address, as in the second and third lines here:
ping -c 5 BRN30055C504EFA.local
PING brn30055c504efa.local (192.168.1.69): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.1.69: icmp_seq=0 ttl=255 time=2.637 ms
You can now enter the IP address (such as 192.168.1.69) and the resource path 
(such as /ipp/printer) in the dialog in the AirPrint pane in Apple Configurator.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator

Configuring a Calendar Payload in the Profile
The Calendar category lets you create payloads of calendar settings that enable the iPad 
to connect to servers that use the CalDAV protocol. CalDAV is the acronym for Calendar 
Extensions to WebDAV, and WebDAV is Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning, a 
protocol for manipulating web content on remote servers. Various online calendars use 
CalDAV to provide calendar services.
CONFIGURING ACCOUNTS FOR INDIVIDUALS OR 
GROUPS
In some of the categories for configuring accounts, you can either create a payload 
for an individual user or a payload that will work with a group of users. As you’d 
imagine, a payload for an individual user belongs only in a profile for that user, so 
normally you’ll want to create payloads for groups of users.
You can create a payload for a group or an individual in the Calendar category, 
the Subscribed Calendars category, the Exchange ActiveSync category, the LDAP 
category, and the Mail category. By contrast, in the Google Account category and the 
macOS Server Account category, you can create a payload only for an individual.
When creating a payload for a group of users, leave the Account Username box 
in the category blank, so that it shows the [set on device] prompt or the 
[optional] prompt. Likewise, leave the Account Password box blank. Each user 
then gets to fill in the appropriate account username and password when setting up 
their profile.
When you do need to configure a profile for an individual user, enter the account 
username in the Account Username box. You can then decide whether to enter the 
password in the payload as well or have the user enter it.
To get started creating a calendar payload, click the Calendar category in the sidebar, 
and then click the Configure button in the Calendar pane. The controls appear in the 
Calendar pane (see Figure 4-64), and you can set up the payload by configuring the 
following settings:
• 
Account Description: Type the descriptive name you want the iPad 
to display for the calendar account.
• 
Account Hostname and Port: Type the hostname or IP address of 
the CalDAV server in the left box and the port number in the right 
box. The default port number is 443 for connections that use SSL 
for security; you can turn SSL on or off by selecting or clearing the 
Use SSL check box at the bottom of the Calendar pane.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
295
• 
Principal URL: Optionally, type or paste the Principal URL for the 
CalDAV account.
• 
Account Username: Optionally, type the username for the 
CalDAV account. Leave this field blank to have the user enter the 
username on the iPad.
• 
Account Password: If you enter the account username, enter the 
corresponding password. Otherwise, leave this field blank to have 
the user provide the password.
• 
Use SSL: Select this check box to make the CalDAV connections 
use SSL. This is normally a good idea for security unless the 
CalDAV server doesn’t support SSL.
Figure 4-64.  Use the Calendar pane to set up one or more calendar payloads
Configuring a Subscribed Calendars Payload in the 
Profile
The Subscribed Calendars category enables you to create payloads that add calendar 
subscriptions to the iPad. For example, you may want to add a calendar subscription to 
your school’s main calendar, or to multiple calendars that the school maintains.
To get started creating a subscribed calendar payload, click the Subscribed 
Calendars category in the sidebar, and then click the Configure button in the Subscribed 
Calendars pane. The controls appear in the Subscribed Calendars pane (see Figure 4-65), 
and you can set up the payload by configuring the following settings:
• 
Description: Type the descriptive name you want the iPad to 
display for the calendar subscription.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
296
• 
URL: Type or paste the URL that contains the subscribed calendar 
file.
• 
Username: Optionally, type the username needed for the 
subscription.
• 
Password: If you enter the username for the subscription, type the 
corresponding password.
• 
Use SSL: Select this check box to make the calendar connection 
use SSL. Usually, this is a good idea unless the calendar server 
doesn’t support SSL.
Figure 4-65.  Use the Subscribed Calendar pane to configure each subscribed calendar 
payload for the profile
Configuring a Contacts Payload in the Profile
The Contacts category lets you add payloads containing settings for connecting to 
CardDAV servers. CardDAV is the acronym for vCard Extensions to WebDAV; it enables a 
client to manipulate contact data on a remote server. For example, you might configure a 
Contacts payload to enable iPads to connect to a school address book.
To get started configuring a contacts payload, click the Contacts category in the 
sidebar, and then click the Configure button in the Contacts pane. You can then configure 
the following controls in the Contacts pane (see Figure 4-66):
• 
Account Description: Type the descriptive name under which you 
want the account to appear on the iPad.
• 
Account Hostname and Port: Type the hostname or IP address of 
the CardDAV server in the left box and the port in the right box. 
The default port for secure connections is 443.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
297
Figure 4-66.  In the Contacts pane, you can create payloads containing contacts accounts 
on CardDAV servers
• 
Principal URL: In this text box, type or paste the Principal URL for 
the CardDAV account.
• 
Account Username: Optionally, type the username for the CardDAV 
account. Leave this field blank if you want the user to fill it in.
• 
Account Password: If you enter the username for the CardDAV 
account, type the account’s password.
• 
Use SSL: Select this check box to make the iPad use SSL for 
communicating with the CardDAV server.
• 
Communication Service Rules: To specify the default app to use 
when calling contacts from the CardDAV account you’re setting 
up, click the Choose button. In the “Choose an app” dialog 
that opens, type the app’s name in the Search box, click the 
appropriate app in the list of results (see Figure 4-67), and then 
click the Choose button. The app then appears in place of the 
Choose button, with a Remove button that you can click if you 
want to change the app.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
298
Figure 4-67.  Use the “Choose an app” dialog to select the default app for Communication 
Service Rules.
■
■Note   You can also search for an app using its bundle identifier. The bundle identifier 
gives the formal name of the app and makes it easy to distinguish from other apps with 
similar app names. The bundle identifier is usually in reverse-DNS notation, such as com.
apple.facetime.
When you finish setting up the first contacts account, you can click the Add (+) 
button in the upper-right corner of the Contacts pane to start configuring another 
contacts account if necessary.
Configuring Exchange ActiveSync Payloads in the Profile
The Exchange ActiveSync category enables you to add one or more Exchange ActiveSync 
accounts to the profile. By preloading the settings on the iPad via the profile, you can 
ensure that the user can access her Exchange account without further configuration.
To start configuring Exchange ActiveSync payloads, click the Exchange ActiveSync 
category in the sidebar, and then click the Configure button in the Exchange ActiveSync 
pane. The controls for configuring the first payload then appear (see Figure 4-68), and 
you can set them as needed for the account:
• 
Account Name: Type the descriptive name you want the iPad to 
display for the Exchange ActiveSync account.
• 
Exchange ActiveSync Host: Type the name of the Microsoft 
Exchange Server to contact.
• 
Use SSL: Select this check box to make the iPad use SSL when 
communicating with the server. This is almost always a good idea, 
and the server may enforce the use of SSL anyway.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator

When you finish setting up the first Exchange ActiveSync account, you can click 
the Add (+) button in the upper-right corner of the Exchange ActiveSync pane to start 
configuring another Exchange ActiveSync account if necessary.
Configuring Google Account Payloads in the Profile
The Google Account category enables you to configure one or more payloads that each 
contain the settings for an individual Google account. The only required field is the 
e-mail address, but you can also specify the account description, the account name, 
and the default app to use for calling contacts from this account. You don’t specify the 
password—instead, the user enters the password when signing in to the account.
Figure 4-68.  Configure one or more Exchange ActiveSync account payloads in the 
Exchange ActiveSync pane

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator

■
■Note  There are two things to note here. First, you’re setting up an individual Google 
account, so you’ll normally want to include Google Account payloads only in individual 
profiles. Second, installing Google accounts via profiles from Apple Configurator works 
only for devices that you supervise using Apple Configurator. If you use an MDM system to 
supervise the devices instead, you need to use install the profiles containing Google account 
payloads through that system.
In the Google Account pane (see Figure 4-69), you can configure the following 
settings to create the payload:
• 
Account Description: Optionally, type a descriptive name for the 
account (such as Google Account).
• 
Account Name: Optionally, type the username the way it should 
appear in the account.
• 
E-mail Address: Type the e-mail address of the Google account. 
This field is required.
• 
Communication Service Rules: To specify the default app to use 
when calling contacts from the CardDAV account you’re setting 
up, click the Choose button. In the “Choose an app” dialog 
that opens, type the app’s name in the Search box, click the 
appropriate app in the list of results, and then click the Choose 
button. The app then appears in place of the Choose button, with 
a Remove button that you can click if you want to change the app.

If you need to set up another Google account, click the Add (+) button in the upper-
right corner of the Google Account pane to display another Google Account pane. You 
can then fill in the settings for this account.
Configuring LDAP Payloads in the Profile
By creating an LDAP payload in a profile, you can set up an iPad to connect automatically 
to an LDAP server. The LDAP category enables you to create one or more LDAP payloads, 
as needed.
To get started creating an LDAP payload, click the LDAP category in the sidebar, and 
then click the Configure button in the LDAP pane. The LDAP pane then displays the rest 
of the controls (see Figure 4-70), and you can set up the account by configuring them. 
These are the controls:

Configuring a macOS Server Account Payload in the 
Profile
The macOS Server Account category enables you to configure one or more payloads 
containing the settings needed to access an account on a macOS server. Once you install 
the profile on an iPad, the user can view and edit existing documents on the server, move 
existing documents to the iPad, and create and save new documents.
■
■Note   In the macOS category, the username is required, creating a payload containing 
the settings for a specific individual account. You can’t create payloads that enable users to 
enter their own usernames.
To start creating a macOS Server Account payload, click the macOS Server Account 
category in the sidebar, and then click the Configure button in the macOS Server Account 
pane. The pane then displays its full set of controls (see Figure 4-73), and you can

Configuring a SCEP Payload in the Profile
SCEP is the acronym for Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol. The SCEP category lets 
you create one or more payloads that enable the iPad to get digital certificates from a 
certificate authority (CA). A certificate authority is a body that issues digital certificates 
for encryption and identification. Major certificate authorities include Symantec (which 
bought VeriSign, a leading CA), Comoda, GoDaddy, and GlobalSign.
To start configuring a SCEP payload, click the SCEP category in the sidebar, and 
then click the Configure button in the SCEP pane. The SCEP pane displays its full set of 
controls (see Figure 4-74), and you can configure them to set up the first payload. These 
are the controls:
• 
URL: Type or paste the base URL for the SCEP server in this box.
• 
Name: In this box, type the name of the instance the iPad will 
used when connecting to the SCEP server. The instance enables 
the server to distinguish between clients.

Configuring a Cellular Payload in the Profile
For cellular iPads, you can use the Cellular category to configure the Default APN (also 
called the Default/Attach APN) and the Data APN for the cellular connection. APN is the 
abbreviation for Access Point Name. An APN specifies where the iPad connects to the 
carrier’s network.
Figure 4-74.  In the SCEP pane, set up one or more payloads to enable the iPad to obtain 
certificates from a certificate authority via Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
311
■
■Caution  Configure a Cellular payload to specify APNs only if your carrier tells you to 
do so. Otherwise, let the SIM card in each cellular iPad control the APNs to which the iPad 
connects.
To start creating a Cellular payload, click the Cellular category in the sidebar, and 
then click the Configure button in the Cellular pane. The Cellular pane displays controls 
for configuring the APNS. The controls change depending on which item you select in 
the Configured APN Type pop-up menu: the Default APN item, the Data APN item, or the 
Default and Data APNs item. Figure 4-75 shows the Cellular pane with the Default and 
Data APNs item selected in the Configured APN Type pop-up menu.
Figure 4-75.  The Cellular category enables you to create a payload that specifies the APNs 
through which a cellular iPad connects to the carrier’s network. You’ll normally not need to 
specify APNs.

Configuring a Notifications Payload in the Profile
The Notifications category lets you configure a single payload that applies notifications 
settings to one or more apps. Much as when configuring notifications interactively, you 
can choose which apps can raise notifications, control whether the notifications appear 
in Notification Center and on the lock screen, control sounds and badges, and choose the 
style for unlocked alerts. A notifications payload applies only to supervised devices.
To get started, click the Notifications category in the sidebar, and then click the 
Configure button to display the Notifications pane (shown in Figure 4-76 with some 
settings already chosen). Then follow these steps:
	
1.	
Click the Add (+) button. The Choose an app dialog opens.

5.	
Select the Allow Notifications check box if you want to allow 
the app to raise notifications. Clearing this check box disables 
the next four check boxes, because they’re relevant only if the 
app is allowed to raise notifications.
	
6.	
Select the Show in Notification Center check box to include 
the app’s notifications in Notification Center (on iOS 10) or 
Cover Sheet (on iOS 11).
	
7.

sound to announce the notifications. You probably won’t want 
these sounds in the classroom.
	
8.	
Select the Badge App Icon check box if you want a badge (a 
red circle or rounded rectangle) showing the number of new 
notifications available in the app to appear on the app’s icon.
	
9.	
Select the Show on Lock Screen check box if you want the 
app’s notifications to appear on the lock screen.
	
10.	
In the Unlocked Alert Style pop-up menu, choose the alert 
style for the app when the iPad is unlocked: None, Banners, 
or Alerts. Banners are the panels that appear at the top of the 
screen for a few seconds before automatically disappearing. 
Alerts are dialogs that remains onscreen until the user 
dismisses them.
	
11.	
Click the Save button to apply your changes. The Notification 
Settings dialog closes, and the app appears in the Notification 
Settings box in the Notifications pane (see Figure 4-79). You 
can then click the + button to start adding another app.

entry in the Notification Settings box in the Notifications pane to open the Notification 
Settings dialog box for the app.
Configuring a Lock Screen Message Payload in the Profile
The Lock Screen Message category enables you to display a message and asset tag 
information on the iPad’s lock screen. Both the message and the asset tag information are 
optional rather than required. The message is primarily for use if the iPad goes missing; 
the asset tag information is to help you identify the iPad easily.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
317
Click the Lock Screen Message category in the sidebar, and then click the Configure 
button to display the controls in the Lock Screen Message pane (see Figure 4-80). You can 
then enter the message and asset tag information:

“If Lost, Return to…” Message: In this box, type the message you 
want to have appear on the lock screen and in the login window.
• 
Asset Tag Information: In this box, type the identifying 
information for the iPad. This information appears at the bottom 
of the lock screen and the login window.
Configuring Web Clips Payloads in the Profile
Apple Configurator enables you to add web clips to an iPad to give the user quick access 
to specific websites. A web clip is an icon that appears on the iPad’s Home screen, like an 
app icon, that makes the web browser display the address set in the web clip. Web clips 
are great for ensuring that your students can access key websites directly from the Home 
screen.
Each web clip counts as a single payload, but you can configure as many of them as 
you need. To set up the first web clips payload, click the Web Clips category in the sidebar, 
and then click the Configure button to display the Web Clip pane (shown in Figure 4-81 
with some settings chosen).
Figure 4-80.  In the Lock Screen Message pane, enter the text for the “If Lost, Return to…” 
message and any asset tag information to help you identify the iPad

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
318
To set up a web clip, choose the appropriate settings for it:
• 
Label: Type a descriptive name for the web clip. Because 
the name appears on the Home screen, a long name will be 
truncated, so it’s best to keep names short.
• 
URL: Type or paste the URL you want the web clip to open.
• 
Removable: Select this check box if you want to allow the user to 
remove the web clip.
• 
Icon: Click the Choose button to open an unnamed dialog for 
selecting the icon. Select the icon file, and then click the Open 
button.
• 
Precomposed Icon: Select this check box if you want the iPad to 
display the icon without added visual effects.
• 
Full Screen: Select this check box to make the web clip appear 
as a full-screen app when the user taps the icon. This is usually 
helpful.
When you finish setting up the first web clip, you can click the Add (+) button in the 
upper-right corner of the Web Clip pane to start creating another.

Saving the Changes to the Profile
If you’ve been working through the categories in order, you should now have finished 
creating the profile. Press Cmd-S or choose File ➤ Save from the menu bar to save the 
profile.
If the profile contains any errors when you try to save it, a dialog opens (see 
Figure 4-82) showing the number of errors. You can click the Save Anyway button to save 
the profile without fixing the errors, but usually it’s best to click the Continue Editing 
button and fix the errors before you forget. Look for the red badges in the sidebar to see 
which categories contain the errors.
Figure 4-82.  This dialog warns you of any errors when you go to save the profile. To fix 
the problems, click the Continue Editing button, and then click each category in turn that 
shows a red badge, as the Wi-Fi category does here.
Signing and Unsigning a Profile
When you finish creating a profile, you can sign the profile with a digital certificate to 
prevent further changes to the profile and to confirm who created the profile. To sign the 
profile, follow these steps:
	
1.	
With the profile open in the profile window, choose File ➤ 
Sign Profile. The dialog shown in Figure 4-83 opens.
Figure 4-83.  You can sign a profile with a digital certificate to prevent changes to it

then select the profile or profiles.
	
4.	
Click the Add button. Apple Configurator starts installing the 
profiles.
■
■Note   If the iPad is locked, Apple Configurator may prompt you to unlock it.
If a dialog opens saying that Configurator requires interaction to install the profile 
because the iPad is unsupervised (see Figure 4-84), you have the three choices shown in 
the following list. You can select the “Apply to all profiles” check box to apply your choice 
to all the profiles:
•

that you cannot remove.
Creating Blueprints to Automate Configuration
Apple Configurator lets you create templates called blueprints to automate the 
configuration of your iPads. In this section, we’ll examine what a blueprint can contain, 
look at how to start creating a blueprint and adding items to it, and then apply the 
blueprint to the iPads that need it.
What Can a Blueprint Contain?
A blueprint can contain various items, including the following:
• 
Configuration profiles containing settings
• 
Apps you want to install
• 
MDM information and MDM supervision identity
• 
Administrative actions, such as enforcing Single App Mode  
on an iPad
Displaying the Blueprint Browser and Starting a New 
Blueprint
To work with blueprints in Apple Configurator, you use the blueprint browser. You can 
switch to the blueprint browser in any of these ways:
• 
Toolbar: Click the Blueprints button on the toolbar and then click 
Edit Blueprints on the pop-up menu.
• 
Menu bar: Choose View ➤ Edit Blueprints.
• 
Keyboard or menu bar: Press Cmd-B or choose File ➤ New Blueprint 
to switch to the blueprint browser and start creating a new blueprint.
If you used the third method to display the blueprint browser, you’ll see a new 
blueprint with a default name such as Untitled or Untitled 1 (see Figure 4-86). If you 
used either other method, click the New button in the lower-left corner of the blueprint 
browser to start a new blueprint.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
323
Figure 4-86.  Click the New button in the lower-left corner of the blueprint browser to start 
a new blueprint, type the name over the default name (such as Untitled), and press the 
Return key.
Type the name for the blueprint over the default name, and then press the Return 
key or click elsewhere to apply the name.
■
■Note   Don’t click the Done button yet, because doing so closes the blueprint browser.
Adding Items to a Blueprint
Now that you’ve started a new blueprint, you can add apps and profiles to it. You can also 
modify the device’s information and choose advanced settings.
Adding Apps to or Removing Apps from a Blueprint
To add apps to a blueprint, you use the same technique as for adding apps to an iPad. 
See the section “Adding Apps to or Removing Apps from an iPad or a Blueprint,” earlier in 
this chapter, for details—but here’s the short version: select the blueprint in the blueprint 
browser, click the Add button on the toolbar and click the Apps item on the pop-up 
menu. Select the app or apps in the dialog, and then click the Add button.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
324
To remove one or more apps from a blueprint, Ctrl-click or right-click the blueprint 
and choose Remove ➤ Apps from the shortcut menu. Alternatively, select the profile and 
choose Actions ➤ Remove ➤ Apps from the menu bar. In the dialog that opens, select the 
apps, and then click the Remove Apps button. In the confirmation dialog that opens, click 
the Remove button.
Adding Profiles to and Removing Profiles from a Blueprint
To add one or more profiles to a blueprint, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Select the blueprint in the blueprint browser.
	
2.	
Click the Add button on the toolbar, and then click Profiles on 
the pop-up menu. A dialog opens for adding profiles.
	
3.	
Select the profile or profiles you want to add.
	
4.	
Click the Add button. Apple Configurator displays a progress 
dialog as it updates the blueprint.
	
5.	
To remove one or more profiles from a blueprint, Ctrl-click 
or right-click the blueprint and choose Remove ➤ Profiles 
from the shortcut menu, or click the profile and then choose 
Actions ➤ Remove ➤ Profiles from the menu bar. In the 
dialog that opens, select the profile or profiles, and then click 
the Remove Profiles button. In the confirmation dialog that 
opens, click the Remove button.
Modifying a Device’s Information via a Blueprint
As you saw in the earlier section “Changing an iPad’s Name, Wallpaper, or Home Screen,” 
you can modify a device’s name, Home screen and lock screen wallpapers, and Home 
screen layout by working on the device. You can also configure these changes in a 
blueprint to make the changes on the iPads to which you apply the blueprint.
To make these changes, select the blueprint in the blueprint browser and give the 
appropriate commands:
	
1.	
Change the device name: Choose Actions ➤ Modify ➤ Device

Choosing Advanced Settings for a Blueprint
You can choose advanced settings for a blueprint the same way you can choose advanced 
settings for an iPad. For example, you can add an Erase All Content and Settings 
command to a blueprint to erase the contents and apply default settings to an iPad, or 
you can add a Use Single App Mode command to make the iPad run in Single App Mode. 
See the earlier section “Choosing Advanced Settings for an iPad or a Blueprint” for details 
on the advanced settings.
Viewing the Information for a Blueprint
As mentioned earlier, when you add items to a blueprint, the blueprint’s icon in the 
blueprint browser stubbornly stays the same, so you can’t see what you’ve added. If you 
make any gross errors, such as trying to add a profile that you’ve already added to the 
blueprint, the blueprint browser will tell you what’s wrong, but otherwise it restricts you 
to a laconic (some might say enigmatic) view.
When you want to get a quick overview of the contents of a blueprint, click the 
blueprint in the blueprint browser and give a Quick Look command by pressing the 
spacebar, choosing File ➤ Quick Look from the menu bar, Ctrl-clicking or right-clicking 
the selection and clicking the Quick Look item on the shortcut menu, or pressing the 
Cmd-Y keyboard shortcut. A pop-up window appears, showing brief details of the 
blueprint (see Figure 4-87). Click elsewhere or press the spacebar again when you want to 
dismiss the pop-up window.
Figure 4-87.  Give the Quick Look command (for example, press the spacebar) to display 
brief details of a blueprint’s contents
To see the full details of what’s in a blueprint, select the blueprint and choose File ➤ 
Get Info from the menu bar, Ctrl-click or right-click the blueprint and click Get Info on the 
shortcut menu, or select the blueprint and press the standard Cmd-I (Get Info) keyboard 
shortcut. The blueprint browser switches to Info view, which reveals the contents of the 
blueprint. Figure 4-88 shows an example of a blueprint in Info view.

Chapter 4 ■ Managing iPads with Apple Configurator
326
As you can see, the sidebar shows different categories of items for the blueprint: Info, 
Apps, and Profiles. As usual, you click the category you want to display in the main part of 
the window.
Here’s what you can do with the Info category selected:
• 
Specify the target devices: Open the Target pop-up menu and 
select the Apple TV item, the iPad item, the iPad, iPhone, and 
iPod touch item, or the iPhone and iPod touch item, as needed.
• 
See the amount of storage needed: Look at the Storage readout.
• 
Verify the Setup settings: Look at the items listed in the Setup area, 
such as Single App Mode. You can click the Remove (X) button to 
the right of an item to remove it.
• 
Verify the Device settings: Look at the items listed in the Device 
area, such as Advanced Options. To remove an item or a group of 
items, click the Remove (X) button to its right.
Similarly, you can review the items in the other categories by clicking the category in 
the sidebar. The Apps category displays a straightforward grid of the apps you’ve added to 
the blueprint, and the Profiles category displays a grid of the profiles in the blueprint. You 
can remove an app or a profile by clicking it, pressing the Delete key, and then clicking 
the Remove button in the confirmation dialog that opens.
To return from the Info view, click the Back button at the left end of the toolbar.
Figure 4-88.  Info view shows the contents of the selected blueprint. Click the Back (<) 
button at the left end of the toolbar to return to the blueprint browser.

Duplicating a Blueprint
When you’ve set up a blueprint exactly the way you need it, you can duplicate it to give 
yourself a quick start on creating a similar one. To duplicate the blueprint, Ctrl-click or 
right-click the blueprint in the blueprint browser, and then click the Duplicate item on the 
shortcut menu.
Apple Configurator gives the duplicate blueprint the same base name, adding a space 
and 1 to the end of the name to differentiate it. You can then click the duplicate blueprint, 
click its name to display an edit box around it, type the new name, and press the Return key.
Applying a Blueprint to an iPad
When a blueprint is ready, you can apply it to the appropriate iPad or iPads. To do so, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	
In the device browser, select the iPad or iPads to which you’ll 
apply the blueprint.
	
2.	
Click the Blueprints button on the toolbar, and then click the 
appropriate blueprint on the pop-up menu. Alternatively, 
choose Actions ➤ Apply from the menu bar, and then click 
the appropriate blueprint on the Apply submenu; or Ctrl-
click or right-click in the selection, click the Apply item on 
the shortcut menu, and then click the blueprint on the Apply 
submenu. A confirmation dialog opens (see Figure 4-89).
Figure 4-89.  Click the Apply button in this dialog to confirm you want to apply the 
blueprint to the iPad or iPads
	
3.	
Click the Apply button. Apple Configurator applies the 
blueprint to the iPad.

Deleting a Blueprint
To delete a blueprint you no longer need, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Switch to the blueprint browser. For example, click the 
Blueprints button on the toolbar and then click Edit 
Blueprints on the pop-up menu.
	
2.	
Select the blueprint or blueprints you want to delete. For 
example, click a blueprint.
	
3.	
Press the Delete key on the keyboard or choose Edit ➤ Delete 
from the menu bar. A confirmation dialog opens.
	
4.	
Click the Remove button. Apple Configurator deletes the 
blueprint.
Summary
In this chapter, you’ve learned to use Apple Configurator to configure iPads automatically. 
You now know what you can do with Apple Configurator, how to install and configure the 
app, and how to perform the various actions it enables you to take. You’ve also learned 
how to create blueprints, how to add apps, profiles, and advanced settings to them, and 
how to apply blueprints to iPads.
In the next chapter, we’ll look at how to manage iPads with Apple School Manager.

CHAPTER 5
Managing iPads with Apple 
School Manager
In this chapter, you’ll learn about Apple School Manager, Apple’s turnkey service for 
managing Macs and iOS devices in schools and similar institutions. This chapter explains 
what you need to know about Apple School Manager to use it effectively—starting with 
the fact that you may not need to use Apple School Manager directly at all if your school 
uses a mobile device management (MDM) solution that integrates with Apple School 
Manager.
I’ll start by covering the essentials of Apple School Manager: what it is, what you 
can do with it, and the roles it includes for school staff and students. I’ll then cover how 
to sign your school up for Apple School Manager, how to get started by running Setup 
Assistant, how to work with locations, user accounts, and classes, how to assign roles to 
user accounts, and how to manage devices.
Understanding the Essentials of Apple School 
Manager
Apple School Manager is a service that Apple provides to help schools deploy Macs 
and iOS devices. Via Apple School Manager, you can configure devices to be enrolled 
automatically in your MDM solution, you can create accounts for your school’s staff and 
students, and you can buy content to deploy on the devices.
Understanding the Two Ways to Access Apple School 
Manager
You can access Apple School Manager in either of two ways:
• 
Directly through the web-based portal: You can log in to Apple 
School Manager through the web-based portal on pretty much 
any computer. You then use Apple School Manager to manage 
your iPads (or other devices) as explained in the main part of this 
chapter.

Chapter 5 ■ Managing iPads with Apple School Manager
330
■
■Note  The Apple School Manager web-based portal supports Safari 7.1.7 or later 
versions on macOS or OS X, Google Chrome 40 or later versions on various operating 
systems, and Microsoft Edge 25.10 or later versions on Windows.
• 
Indirectly through an MDM solution: Many MDM solutions for 
managing iOS devices and Macs feature integration with Apple 
School Manager. In this approach, you enter your Apple School 
Manager details into your MDM solution and then use the MDM 
solution to manage the devices. The MDM solution implements 
the changes in Apple School Manager as needed.
Actions You Can Take with Apple School Manager
With Apple School Manager, you can take a wide range of actions, including the following:
• 
Create accounts for staff and students
• 
Assign accounts to different roles, such as Administrator, 
Manager, Teacher, or Student
• 
Define permissions for those roles
• 
Manage your school’s devices
■
■Note   Apple introduced Apple School Manager with iOS 9.3 in January 2016. If your 
iPads are running an older version of iOS, you’ll need to upgrade to at least iOS 9.3—and 
preferably a later version, such as the current version—if you want to use Apple School 
Manager with them.
Understanding Roles in Apple School Manager
Apple School Manager supports nine different roles that control what different types of 
users can do within the system. You’ll learn the details of roles and their privileges in the 
section “Assigning Roles to Accounts,” later in this chapter, but at this point it’s helpful to 
know a little about the different roles and which other roles (if any) each role can affect.
These are the nine roles, in order from the most powerful to the least powerful:
• 
Administrator: The Administrator runs the system and can make 
changes to other Administrators and all the other roles.
• 
Site Manager: A Site Manager manages an Apple School Manager 
site (a location) and can make changes to other Site Managers 
and all other roles except Administrator.

Chapter 5 ■ Managing iPads with Apple School Manager
331
• 
People Manager: A People Manager can make changes to other 
People Managers and all other roles except Administrator.
• 
Device Manager: A Device Manager can make changes to devices 
but not to other roles.
• 
Content Manager: A Content Manager manages content (such as 
apps and books) but can’t make changes to any roles.
• 
Manager: A Manager can make changes to the Teacher, Staff, and 
Student roles.
• 
Teacher: A Teacher can make changes to only the Student role.
• 
Staff: A Staff member can’t make changes to any roles.
• 
Student: A Student can’t make changes to any roles.
Signing Your School Up for Apple School Manager
If your school isn’t signed up for Apple School Manager, you can sign it up relatively 
easily. You first fill in an application form online. Apple reviews your application and, 
assuming your school qualifies for the program, confirms it. You can then complete the 
enrollment process.
■
■Note   If your school is already part of the Apple Deployment Program, sign in with your 
existing account instead of creating a new account. Then click the Upgrade Now button 
on the Upgrade to Apple School Manager screen to upgrade your account to Apple School 
Manager.
Enrolling Your School in Apple School Manager
To enroll your school in Apple School Manager, go to the Apple School Manager home page 
at school.apple.com. Click the “Not enrolled? Enroll your institution now” link, and then 
follow the prompts to create a new account. You’ll need to provide the following information:
• 
Your school’s location, full address, and phone number
• 
Your school’s legal name
• 
Your school’s type (K–12 or higher education)
• 
Your school’s website (used for verification and to prepopulate 
Managed Apple IDs)
• 
Your first name, last name, and job title (a job title without a name 
isn’t acceptable)
• 
Your work e-mail address

Chapter 5 ■ Managing iPads with Apple School Manager
332
■
■Note  The work e-mail address you provide must not be associated with an iTunes 
account or an iCloud account. It also must not have been used as an Apple ID for another 
Apple service.
• 
The name, work e-mail address, and job title of a verification 
contact, such as the principal or the Head of IT (assuming that’s 
not you)
Getting the Verification Contact to Grant You 
Administrator Access
After you submit your application for enrollment, Apple reviews the information and 
phones your verification contact to confirm the information you’ve provided. Assuming 
all is well, Apple School Manager sends the verification contact an e-mail message with 
the subject line “Thank you for verifying your institution.” This message contains a 
Confirm [Your Name] button that the verification contact can click to confirm you as the 
administrator, plus a Choose Someone Else link that the verification contact can click to 
confirm someone other than you instead.
The message also contains a check box for the verification contact to check. This 
check box approves the administrator (I’m assuming that’s you) as having the authority to 
sign the Apple School Manager terms and conditions on the school’s behalf.
Once your verification contact has jumped through these hoops, you (the 
administrator) receive an e-mail message titled “Enrollment Complete” from Apple 
School Manager.
Setting Up Your Managed Apple ID
When you receive the “Enrollment Complete” message, click the Get Started button in it. 
Your default web browser opens to the page for creating a Managed Apple ID. You’ll need 
to set up a secure password, enter your date of birth, provide a mobile phone number, 
and then enter the verification code sent to your phone.
Running Setup Assistant
Apple School Manager includes a Setup Assistant feature that helps you get started. You 
can either connect your school’s Student Information System (SIS) to your Apple School 
Manager account and import data directly from it—by far the easier approach—or load 
your data into Apple’s CSV templates and upload them to Apple School Manager via 
Secure File Transport Protocol (SFTP). Whichever approach you take, Setup Assistant 
also enables you to add your institution’s details to your school’s Apple School Manager 
account.

Chapter 5 ■ Managing iPads with Apple School Manager
333
■
■Note   CSV is the abbreviation for comma-separated values, a format that’s widely used 
to interchange text-only data such as database records. Each field is separated from the 
next field by a comma.
Importing Student, Staff, and Class Data from Your 
School’s SIS
If your school uses an SIS, you’ll normally want to connect it to Apple School Manager so 
that you can copy information from the SIS to Apple School Manager. When you make 
the first connection to the SIS, you copy the data on students, staff, and classes to Apple 
School Manager. Thereafter, Apple School Manager receives updates from the SIS every 
24 hours, automatically adding any information that has been updated.
To connect to your school’s SIS, follow these steps:
	
1.	
If you don’t currently have Setup Assistant open, click your 
name in the upper-right corner of the screen, and then click 
Setup Assistant on the pop-up menu to open Setup Assistant.
	
2.	
Go to the Find Students, Staff, and Classes heading, and then 
click the Add (+) button.
	
3.	
Click Student Information System (SIS). The pop-up menu 
opens.
	
4.	
Click the type of SIS your school uses.
	
5.	
Click the Connect button. A screen for connecting to that type 
of SIS appears.
	
6.	
Fill in the required information (this depends on the type of 
SIS).
	
7.	
Click the Connect button. Apple School Manager establishes 
the connection and then copies information from the SIS.
■
■Note  If Apple School Manager gives any errors when copying information from the SIS, 
correct the data in the SIS, and then try connecting Apple School Manager to it again.
	
8.	
When Apple School Manager has copied the data, click the 
Review Data button to display the data that will be added to 
Apple School Manager.
	
9.	
Review the data to make sure it looks correct.
	
10.	
Click the Confirm button to confirm adding the data to Apple 
School Manager.

Chapter 5 ■ Managing iPads with Apple School Manager
334
Uploading Data to Apple School Manager via SFTP
If your school doesn’t have an SIS, or has an SIS that isn’t directly compatible with Apple 
School Manager, you can upload data to Apple School Manager via Secure File Transport 
Protocol (SFTP). The data needs to be in CSV files, which you can create from most 
database and spreadsheet apps. Apple School Manager provides template files to help 
ensure you get the data in the format needed.
Getting the SFTP Information
The first step in setting up the SFTP connection to Apple School Manager is running 
Setup Assistant and getting the SFTP information you need. To do so, follow these steps:
	
1.	
If you don’t currently have Setup Assistant open, click your 
name in the upper-right corner of the screen, and then click 
Setup Assistant on the pop-up menu to open Setup Assistant.
	
2.	
Go to the Find Students, Staff, and Classes heading, and then 
click the Add (+) button.
	
3.	
Click the Set Up SFTP button. A screen appears showing the 
URL, username, and password to use for uploading files to 
Apple School Manager via SFTP, plus a Download Templates 
button for downloading the CSV templates.
	
4.	
Note the SFTP information, or enter it directly in the FTP app 
you will use.
Downloading and Filling Out the CSV Templates
Next, download the CSV templates and fill them out with the information on your 
school’s students, staff, and classes. To download the CSV template files, click the 
Download Templates button.
There are six CSV template files:
• 
Students template: You use this template for uploading data on 
student accounts.
• 
Staff template: You use this template for uploading data on staff 
accounts, including teachers.
• 
Courses template: You use this template for uploading course 
information.
• 
Classes template: You use this template for uploading class 
information.
• 
Rosters template: You use this template for uploading class rosters.
• 
Locations template: You use this template for uploading location 
information.

Chapter 5 ■ Managing iPads with Apple School Manager
335
How to Fill Out the Templates
How you fill out the Apple School Manager templates will depend on how your school 
stores the data you will need to upload. The following list summarizes your choices:
• 
Student Information System (SIS): If your school has an SIS that’s 
not directly compatible with Apple School Manager, you should 
be able to export information from the SIS to CSV files. You’ll 
probably need to map the fields manually, specifying which field 
in the CSV file receives the data from which field in the SIS, to get 
the fields in the right order in the CSV files.
■
■Note  If your school has an SIS that’s directly compatible with Apple School Manager, 
you’ll normally be better off linking the SIS to Apple School Manager rather than messing 
around with the templates.
• 
Other database: If your school stores information in a database 
rather than an SIS, you should be able to export the required 
information to CSV files. Again, you’ll need to map the fields 
manually to get them in the right order.
• 
Excel workbook: If your school stores information in an Excel 
workbook, you can set up worksheets that pull together the 
appropriate fields in the right order, and then use the Save As 
command to save them to CSV files.
• 
Manually: Although it’s possible to fill out the CSV templates 
manually in a spreadsheet app (or even a word processing app), 
doing so is so laborious that it’s rarely worthwhile other than for 
testing Apple School Manager.
Filling Out the Students Template
The Students template enables you to import your school’s student accounts into Apple 
School Manager. Table 5-1 explains the fields in the Students template. There are four 
required fields: person_id, first_name, last_name, and location_id. Of these fields, 
only person_id must be unique.

The Courses template enables you to upload information on your school’s courses 
to Apple School Manager. Table 5-3 explains the fields in the Courses template. This 
template has two required fields: course_id (which links classes to the courses that 
contain them) and location_id (which specifies the location to which the course 
belongs).

Filling Out the Classes Template
The Classes template enables you to upload information on your school’s classes to 
Apple School Manager. A class is one of the components of a course and is linked to the 
course by the course_id field, which is required. Also required are the class_id field, 
which identifies the class uniquely in the school’s system, and the location_id field,

Filling Out the Rosters Template
The Rosters template lets you import your class rosters into Apple School Manager. In 
Apple School Manager, a roster is a record that allocates one student to the specified 
class—it’s not the complete list of students in a class. Each student in that class needs his 
or her own roster.

of a class that contains 30 students, you need 30 unique roster_id values, each on its own 
row and accompanied by the class_id number of the class and the student_id number of 
a student. Similarly, each other class needs a unique roster_id value for each student. One 
way to create unique roster_id values is to use the uuidgen command in a shell script in a 
Terminal window on macOS.
Filling Out the Locations Template
The Locations template enables you to import your school’s locations into Apple School 
Manager. This is the simplest of the templates, and you should be able to fill it out quickly. 
Table 5-6 explains the two fields in the Rosters template.
Uploading the Information via SFTP
After filling in the CSV templates, compress them into a zip archive. For example, on 
macOS, open a Finder window to the folder that contains the CSV templates, select the 
templates, and then choose File ➤ Compress 6 Items from the menu bar. This creates a 
file named Archive.zip. You can rename it if you want, but you don’t need to.
Next, establish an SFTP connection using the information you noted earlier. You’ll 
need to use a third-party app, such as Forklift on macOS or FileZilla on Windows, Linux, 
or macOS. Drag the zip archive file to the Dropbox folder, and drop it there. (Just to be 
clear: Dropbox here is the name of the folder in Apple School Manager—it has nothing to 
do with the Dropbox online file-transfer service.)

Chapter 5 ■ Managing iPads with Apple School Manager
341
Once you’ve done this, return to the Apple School Manager window and click the 
Continue button. When the file has uploaded, Apple School Manager warns you if it 
contains errors. If so, you’ll need to fix them, create a new zip archive, and then upload 
it. You can leave the previous zip archive file on the Apple SFTP server—Apple School 
Manager uses the new file you upload.
When you’ve successfully uploaded data without errors, you can click the Review 
SFTP Data button to review the data.
Adding Other Institution Details in Setup Assistant
After you finish importing or uploading data, Setup Assistant displays a screen where you 
can add further data about your school:
• 
Tax Status: Click the Add (+) button next to the Add Institution 
Details heading, then click Add Tax Status. In the Add Tax Status 
pop-up menu, click the appropriate status. Then enter your Apple 
Customer Number or your Certificate ID to enable Apple to verify 
the tax information.
• 
Find Devices: Enter your Apple Customer Number or your 
reseller’s or carrier’s Apple Reseller ID to let you associate devices 
with your MDM solution.
Click the Save button when you finish adding information in Setup Assistant.
Configuring Managed Apple IDs in Setup Assistant
Apple School Manager gives you tools for working with Managed Apple IDs, the 
identifiers that students and staff use to sign in to their iPads, to authenticate themselves 
for Apple services, or to work with Apple School Manager. Whereas standard Apple 
IDs are owned and managed by individual users, Managed Apple IDs are owned and 
managed by schools.
UNDERSTANDING APPLE’S RECOMMENDED FORMAT 
FOR MANAGED APPLE IDS
To reduce confusion, Apple recommends that you set up your school’s Managed 
Apple IDs with a different format than that used for the students’ and staff’s regular 
e-mail addresses. The confusion arises from the fact that, if you use the regular e-mail 
addresses, the students will need to remember two passcodes for the same address: 
the original passcode for e-mail, plus the passcode for the Managed Apple ID.
So, for a school with the domain notionalacademy.com, you might want to use 
e-mail addresses such as a_abrahams@notionalacademy.com and b_brown@
notionalacademy.com, but Apple recommends including the text appleid. after the 
@ sign, giving Managed Apple IDs such as a_abrahams@appleid.notionalacademy 
.com and b_brown@appleid.notionalacademy.com.

Chapter 5 ■ Managing iPads with Apple School Manager
342
Apple School Manager creates Managed Apple IDs when you import user accounts 
from your school’s SIS, import CSV files via SFTP, or create user accounts manually. To 
choose the format for the Managed Apple IDs, follow these steps in Setup Assistant:
	
1.	
Click the Add (+) button next to the Create Accounts and 
Classes heading.
	
2.	
Click the Change Settings button to open the settings for 
editing in the Format window.
	
3.	
In the Domain box, enter the school’s domain (such as 
notionalacademy.com).
	
4.	
Select the “Include ‘appleid’ in the Domain” option if you 
want to place appleid. before the domain name. This is 
normally a good idea.
	
5.	
Click the Save Format button. The Format window closes, 
returning you to Setup Assistant.
	
6.	
Click the Preview Accounts and Classes button to view the 
list of Managed Apple IDs that the settings you’ve chosen will 
generate.
	
7.	
Click the Create Managed Apple IDs button to begin 
generating the Managed Apple IDs.
Working with Locations
Apple School Manager ties user roles to locations. For example, a staff member can be an 
Administrator in one location and a Teacher in another location.
Apple School Manager walks you through the process of creating your school’s initial 
location when you sign up for the service. You can subsequently add other locations as 
needed.
To work with locations, click the Locations item in the sidebar. The list of existing 
locations appears. You can then take the following actions:
• 
Add a location: Click the Add New Location button toward the top 
of the screen. Enter the details for the new location, and then click 
the Save button.
• 
Edit your school’s default password policy location information: 
Click the appropriate location, and then click the Edit button (the 
blue circle showing a pencil icon). Select the default password 
policy you want to apply, and then click the Save button.
• 
Delete a location and transfer its data to another location: Click 
the location you want to delete, and then click the Delete Location 
button. Click the Choose a Transfer Location pop-up menu, and 
then click the location to which you want to transfer the information 
from the location you’re deleting. Click the Continue button to effect 
the transfer and the deletion, and then click the Done button.

Chapter 5 ■ Managing iPads with Apple School Manager

Working with User Accounts and Classes
When you are using Apple School Manager to manage your school’s deployment of 
devices directly, you can set up user accounts either by creating them manually or by 
copying or uploading existing information.
You can also create classes manually if necessary by specifying the students and 
teacher (or teachers) that make up each class.
Working with User Accounts
This section looks at how to create user accounts manually, how to create Administrator 
and Manager accounts, and how to edit user accounts. I’ll also cover how to deactivate 
and reactivate user accounts, how to delete user accounts you’ve created manually, how 
to inspect user accounts, and how to reset the verification phone number for an account.
WHAT INFORMATION DOES A USER ACCOUNT CONTAIN?
A user account can contain the following information:
•	
The account’s status (New, Active, Deactivated, Locked, or Passcode 
Reset)
•	
The first name, middle initial or name, and last name of the user
•	
The user’s Managed Apple ID
•	
The user’s role and location
•	
The Managed Apple ID passcode policy applied to the account
•	
The grade level for a student
•	
The e-mail address for the user
•	
The Person Number and the Person ID
Creating a User Account Manually
If you’re not copying user account information from your school’s SIS or uploading the 
information in CSV files, you can create user accounts manually. To do so, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	
Click the Accounts item in the sidebar.
	
2.	
Click the Add New Account button to display the fields for 
creating a new account.
	
3.	
Enter the first name and last name. This information is 
required.

Chapter 5 ■ Managing iPads with Apple School Manager
344
	
4.	
Enter the middle initial or middle name if appropriate. This 
information is optional.
	
5.	
Select the appropriate role for the account. For example, 
select the Student role for a student. This information is 
required.
	
6.	
Select the location for the account. This information is 
required.
	
7.	
Enter the Managed Apple ID for the account. This information 
is also required.
	
8.	
Enter the grade level if appropriate. This information is 
optional.
	
9.	
Enter the e-mail address if appropriate. This information is 
also optional.
	
10.	
Enter the Person ID if necessary. This information is also 
optional.
■
■Note  A Person ID is a unique identifier used to identify the user in your school’s SIS. A 
Person Number is a unique alphanumeric identifier used to identify the user account.
	
11.	
Enter the Person Number if appropriate. This information, 
too, is optional.
	
12.	
Enter the SIS username, if appropriate. This is also optional.
	
13.	
Click the Save Person button in the lower-right corner of the 
screen.
Creating Administrator Accounts and Manager Accounts
Apart from the Administrator account with which you initially set up your school’s Apple 
School Manager account, you can create up to four more Administrator accounts. For 
security, you’ll normally want to set up at least one other Administrator account in case 
you get locked out of your account.
The process for creating an Administrator account is the same as creating a user 
account (see the previous section): you click the Accounts item in the sidebar, click the 
Add New Account button, and then fill in the fields. The key difference is that you select 
the Administrator role for the account.
Similarly, you can create accounts in the five Manager roles—Manager, Site Manager, 
People Manager, Device Manager, and Content Manager—by selecting the appropriate 
Manager role for each account.

Chapter 5 ■ Managing iPads with Apple School Manager
345
Editing User Accounts
When you need to change the information in a user account, you can edit the user 
account by clicking the Accounts item in the sidebar, selecting the account, and then 
clicking the Edit button (the blue circle showing a pencil icon). Make the changes needed 
(but see the next Caution), and then click the Save button to save them.
■
■Caution   Be careful when editing an account that you’ve imported from your school’s 
SIS or uploaded as a CSV file. In these accounts, you can safely edit only the Managed Apple 
ID field, the Role field, and the Passcode field. Editing any other fields changes the account 
to a manually created account, which prevents you from updating it with new information 
from the SIS or a CSV file.
CONVERTING EXISTING ACCOUNTS TO MANAGER AND 
ADMINISTRATOR ACCOUNTS
Besides creating new Administrator accounts and Manager accounts, you can 
also convert an existing account to a Manager account, and you can convert any 
Manager account that you’ve created manually to an Administrator account.
To convert an account to a Manager account, click the Accounts item in the sidebar, 
select the account (search for it if necessary), and then click the Edit button (the 
blue circle showing a pencil icon). With the account open for editing, select the 
appropriate Manager role and the location in which the user will exercise the role, 
and then click the Save button.
To convert a Manager account to an Administrator account, open the Manager 
account for editing, select the Administrator role and the appropriate location, and 
then click the Save button.
Deactivating and Reactivating User Accounts
You may sometimes need to deactivate a user account to prevent that user from signing in 
with their Managed Apple ID. To deactivate a user account, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Click the Accounts item in the sidebar.
	
2.	
Click the user account you want to deactivate. Search for the 
account if necessary.
	
3.	
Click the Deactivate Account button.
	
4.	
Click the Done button.

Chapter 5 ■ Managing iPads with Apple School Manager
346
■
■Note   You can also deactivate multiple user accounts at once. To do so, click the 
Accounts item in the sidebar, and then select each user account you want to deactivate. In 
the Account Status row, click the Change button, and then click the Deactivate item on the 
pop-up menu. Click the Continue button, and then click the Done button.
■
■Caution   Apple School Manager automatically deletes any account that you leave 
deactivated for more than 30 days, so it’s a good idea to review account status once every 
week or two.
When you need to reactivate a user account, follow the same steps as for deactivating 
a user account, but click the Reactivate Account button instead of the Deactivate Account 
button. You can also reactivate multiple user accounts at the same time by selecting the 
accounts, clicking the Change button in the Account Status row, and then clicking the 
Reactivate item on the pop-up menu. Finish by clicking the Continue button and then 
clicking the Done button.
Deleting User Accounts You Have Created Manually
You can delete user accounts that you’ve created manually in Apple School Manager, but 
you can’t delete user accounts that have been created automatically.
To delete a user account, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Click the Accounts item in the sidebar.
	
2.	
Click the user account you want to delete. You can search for 
the account to locate it.
	
3.	
Click the Delete button. A confirmation dialog opens.
	
4.	
Click the Delete button to confirm the deletion.
	
5.	
Click the Done button.
■
■Note   You can delete multiple user accounts if necessary. To do so, click the Accounts 
icon in the sidebar, and then select each user account you want to delete. In the Account 
Status row, click the Change button, and then click the Delete item on the pop-up menu. 
Click the Continue button to confirm the deletion, and then click the Done button.

Chapter 5 ■ Managing iPads with Apple School Manager
347
Inspecting a User Account
Apple School Manager includes an Inspect feature for inspecting the contents of a 
specific Managed Apple ID, enabling you to check that a device configured for multiple 
users is being used in compliance with your school’s policies. To inspect an account, 
you must hold a higher role in Apple School Manager than the account: For example, a 
Manager can inspect the Teacher, Staff, and Student roles, a Teacher can inspect only the 
Student role, and an Administrator can inspect all the roles below Administrator.
Apple School Manager requires you to create an inspection Managed Apple ID and a 
custom password for each inspection. Follow these steps to create these credentials:
	
1.	
Click the Accounts item in the sidebar.
	
2.	
Click the user account you want to inspect. Search for the 
account if necessary.
	
3.	
Click the Inspect icon (the blue circle showing an eye icon).
	
4.	
Click the Continue button. The inspection Managed Apple ID 
and password appear.
	
5.	
Note the Managed Apple ID and password.
	
6.	
Click the Done button.
You can now use the inspection Managed Apple ID and password to inspect the user 
account. You have 15 minutes to do so before the credentials expire.
Resetting the Verification Phone Number for an Account
For security, Apple School Manager requires a six-digit verification code to supplement 
the Managed Apple ID account passcode for each user account that has Administrator, 
Manager, Staff, or Teacher roles. This code is sent to the phone number you’ve associated 
with the user account.
When you need to reset the phone number for an account, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Click the Accounts item in the sidebar.
	
2.	
Click the user account for which you want to reset the 
verification phone number. Search for the account if 
necessary.
	
3.	
Click the Reset Phone Number button.
	
4.	
Click the Reset button to confirm the change.
The next time the user signs in to their account, Apple School Manager prompts 
them to add the new phone number.

Chapter 5 ■ Managing iPads with Apple School Manager
348
ADDING MULTIPLE VERIFICATION PHONE NUMBERS FOR 
KEY ROLES
If you need to lock down key roles in Apple School Manager, you can add extra 
verification phone numbers. For example, you may want to layer extra security onto 
your Administrator accounts and some Manager accounts.
To do this, go to the Apple ID website, http://appleid.apple.com, and sign in 
using your Managed Apple ID. Go through Two-Step Verification if prompted—for 
example, get a code sent to your trusted iPhone or iPad, and then enter that on the 
website.
Next, go to the Security section of the page, and click the Edit button on the right 
side. Under the Trusted Phone Numbers heading, click the Add Another Phone 
Number button to display the Enter a Phone Number That Can Receive Text 
Messages dialog, enter the phone number, and then click the Continue button. When 
the six-digit code appears, type it in, and then click the Verify button.
Managing Passcodes
You’ll need to spend some of your time in Apple School Manager managing passcodes 
for your school’s user accounts. This section first briefly examines how Apple School 
Manager uses passcodes to secure accounts. I’ll then cover how you set passcode policies 
in Apple School Manager, create new sign-ins for user accounts you’ve imported or 
created, and reset passcodes when users forget them.
Understanding How Apple School Manager Uses Passcodes
When you import user accounts or create them manually, you create a temporary 
passcode for each account. This passcode is good only for the user to sign in with the 
account’s Managed Apple ID—as soon as the user is signed in, Apple School Manager 
walks them through the process of setting their own passcode.
Any student (someone with a user account assigned the Student role) can sign in on 
devices listed in Apple School Manager using their Managed Apple ID and passcode. For 
devices not listed in Apple School Manager, a student can sign in using their Managed 
Apple ID, passcode, and a six-digit verification code.
Apple School Manager has tighter security for accounts that have the Administrator, 
Manager, Staff, or Teacher roles. These accounts require not only the Managed Apple ID 
passcode but also a six-digit verification code. Once you’ve entered this verification code 
on a device, you don’t need to enter it again for 30 days.

Chapter 5 ■ Managing iPads with Apple School Manager
349
Setting Passcode Policies for Apple School Manager
Apple School Manager supports three passcode policies that you can apply to roles:
• 
Standard passcode containing at least eight characters (letters 
and numbers)
• 
Six-digit passcode
• 
Four-digit passcode
Accounts with the Student role can use any of the three passcode policies, but you 
can enforce a particular policy if your school so prefers. Accounts with the Administrator, 
Manager, Staff, or Teacher roles should use a standard passcode; you can change this, but 
it’s better if you don’t.
To control which passcode policy your school’s accounts with the Student role use, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	
Click the Accounts item in the sidebar.
	
2.	
Select the account or accounts you want to affect. If you select 
multiple accounts, they must all have the same role.
	
3.	
Click the Edit button (the blue circle showing a pencil icon).
	
4.	
Click the Passcode Policy pop-up menu, and then click the 
passcode policy you want to apply.
	
5.	
Click the Save button to save the changes.
Creating New Sign-Ins for User Accounts
After importing user accounts into Apple School Manager, or creating new user accounts 
directly in Apple School Manager, you need to create a temporary passcode for each 
account and communicate it to each user. The users can then sign in to their user 
accounts for the first time, and create new passcodes for themselves when Apple School 
Manager prompts them to do so.
To create new sign-ins for user accounts, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Click the Accounts item in the sidebar.
	
2.	
Select the user account or user accounts for which you want to 
create the new sign-ins.
	
3.	
If you selected a single account, click the Create Sign-In 
button. If you selected multiple accounts, go to the Sign-Ins 
row and click the Create button.
	
4.	
When Apple School Manager prompts you how to 
communicate the passcodes, click the .CSV and PDF button 
or the Send as an Email button, as needed:
• 
.CSV and PDF: Click the Download button, and then click the 
8-Up PDF button, the 1-Up PDF button, or the .CSV button, 
as needed.

Chapter 5 ■ Managing iPads with Apple School Manager
350
■
■Note  The 8-Up PDF option creates pages containing 8 users (or, on the last sheet, 
however many are left, fewer than 8). You can print the PDF, cut up the sheets of paper, and 
distribute the sections to the users. The 1-Up PDF option creates a full page for each user. 
The .CSV option creates a comma-separated values file containing five columns: Managed 
Apple ID, First Name, Middle Name, Last Name, and Initial Passcode.
• 
Send as an Email: Select or deselect the option for displaying 
the user’s photo in the e-mail message, and then click the 
Email button. Apple School Manager sends a message 
containing the Managed Apple ID and the initial passcode to 
the e-mail address listed in the user account.
Resetting a Forgotten Passcode
If a user forgets their passcode, you can reset it. Resetting the passcode gives the user a 
temporary passcode, and when they log in with the temporary passcode, Apple School 
Manager prompts them to create a new passcode.
To reset a passcode, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Click the Accounts item in the sidebar.
	
2.	
Click the user account for which you want to reset the 
passcode. As usual, you may want to search to locate the 
account.
	
3.	
Click the Reset Passcode button.
■
■Note  You can reset the passcodes for multiple user accounts at once if necessary. Click 
the Accounts item in the sidebar, select each user account you want to affect, and then click 
the Create button in the Sign-Ins row.
	
4.	
When Apple School Manager prompts you how to 
communicate the passcodes, click the .CSV and PDF button 
or the Send as an Email button, as needed:
• 
.CSV and PDF: Click the Download button, and then click the 
8-Up PDF button, the 1-Up PDF button, or the .CSV button, 
as needed.

Chapter 5 ■ Managing iPads with Apple School Manager
351
• 
Send as an Email: Select or deselect the option for displaying 
the user’s photo in the e-mail message, and then click the 
Email button. Apple School Manager sends a message 
containing the Managed Apple ID and the initial passcode to 
the e-mail address listed in the user account.
Sending Verification Codes to Students
Apple School Manager enables you to send a verification code that permits a student 
to sign in using their Managed Apple ID to an iPad running Shared iPad, to the iCloud 
service using Safari, or to the iCloud preferences pane on a Mac.
To send a verification code, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Click the Accounts item in the sidebar.
	
2.	
Select the user account that needs the verification code.
	
3.	
Click the Verification Code button.
	
4.	
When Apple School Manager prompts you how to 
communicate the verification code, click the .CSV and PDF 
button or the Send as an Email button, as needed:
• 
.CSV and PDF: Click the Download button, and then click the 
1-Up PDF button or the .CSV button, as needed.
• 
Send as an Email: Click the Send as an Email button. Apple 
School Manager sends a message containing the Managed 
Apple ID and the verification code to the e-mail address listed 
in the user account.
■
■Note  You can send verification codes to multiple user accounts if need be. Click the 
Accounts item in the sidebar, select each user account that needs a verification code, and then 
click the Create button in the Verification Codes row. You can then choose between the .CSV 
and PDF option (which includes the capability to create an 8-Up PDF) and the Send as an Email 
option, which sends an e-mail message containing the verification code to each user.
Working with Classes
Your school may create all classes in its MDM solution. If so, you won’t need to create 
classes manually. Otherwise, you can create classes manually as needed by specifying the 
students and teacher (or teachers) that make up each class.

Chapter 5 ■ Managing iPads with Apple School Manager
352
Creating a Class Manually
To create a class manually, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Click the Classes item in the sidebar.

4.	
Click the Delete button. Apple School Manager deletes the 
class.
Assigning Roles to Accounts
Apple School Manager supports various different roles, such as Administrator, Teacher, 
Staff, and Student. Some of the roles can make changes to other roles. For example, the 
Teacher role can make changes to the Student role, whereas the Student role can’t make 
changes to another role; the Administrator role can make changes to all the other roles. 
To control what a particular user account can do, you assign the appropriate roles to the 
user account.
■
■Note   Each role is tied to a location, so you can give a person different roles for 
different locations. For example, you might assign a staff member the Teacher role for one 
location and a different role, such as Manager or Staff, at another location.

Viewing and Editing the Privileges for a Role
When you need to find out which privileges a particular role has, you can view the roles 
assigned to the account, and edit them if necessary.
■
■Note   To view and edit roles, you need to be logged in with an account that has the 
privileges needed to manipulate the roles. Normally, you’d use an account that has the 
Administrator, Site Manager, People Manager, or Manager role.

Chapter 5 ■ Managing iPads with Apple School Manager
359
To view the privileges for a role, and edit the privileges if necessary, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	
Click the Roles item in the sidebar.
	
2.	
Click the role you want to examine. The privileges for the role 
appear.
	
3.	
If you want to see the accounts to which this role has been 
applied, click the Show button (the blue circle showing a 
magnifying glass).
	
4.	
If you need to edit the privileges for the role, click the Edit 
button (the blue circle showing a pencil icon). You can 
then check the check box for a privilege you want to add, or 
uncheck the check box for a privilege you want to remove. 
When you finish, click the Save button to save your changes.
■
■Note   At the risk of stating the obvious, changing the privileges for a role changes the 
privileges for all the accounts to which you’ve applied the role. If you need to give more 
privileges to a particular account without giving them to other accounts, you’re usually 
better off applying to that account a role that confers those privileges rather than adding 
privileges to an existing role applied to that account.
Assign a Role to an Account
To assign a role to an account, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Click the Accounts item in the sidebar.
	
2.	
If you’ll need to filter your search results, click the Filter 
button on the Search bar.
	
3.	
Click in the Search People field.
	
4.	
Type your search criteria. The search results appear.
	
5.	
Select the account or accounts you want to affect.
	
6.	
Click the Edit button (the blue circle showing a pencil icon) to 
open the accounts for editing.
	
7.	
Click the role and location you want to assign to the account.
	
8.	
Click the Save button to save your changes.

Managing Your School’s Devices with Apple 
School Manager
Apple School Manager makes it easy to enroll and deploy iOS devices that your school 
has acquired from Apple, an Apple Authorized Reseller, or carrier. You can enroll devices 
without having to physically prepare them at all: instead, you can order the devices from 
Apple and have them shipped to the users. When the users activate the devices, the 
devices are automatically enrolled in your school’s MDM solution, and the management 
settings, apps, and books you’ve specified are installed automatically on the devices.
Setting Up Your Suppliers in Apple School Manager
If your school will purchase iPads from Apple Authorized Resellers or from carriers, you 
need to get the appropriate information in place to make the iPads show up in Apple 
School Manager.
First, tell the reseller or carrier your school’s DEP Customer ID, and add the reseller’s 
or carrier’s DEP Reseller ID to your account profile, as explained in the next list. The 
DEP Customer ID is your school’s unique identifier. It enables the reseller to submit the 
devices you buy for enrollment in the Device Enrollment Program and in Apple School 
Manager.
To add an reseller’s or carrier DEP Reseller ID to your Apple School Manager 
account, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Click the Locations item in the sidebar. The list of locations 
appears.
	
2.	
Click the location you want to affect. You can search for it if 
necessary.
	
3.	
Click the Settings button.
	
4.	
Click the Device Purchases button.
	
5.	
Click the Add button next to Apple Reseller Number.
■
■Note  If the Add button doesn’t appear, or if it’s dimmed and unavailable, your Apple 
School Manager account may already contain the relevant information.
	
6.	
Type or paste in the reseller number.
	
7.	
Click the Save button.

Chapter 5 ■ Managing iPads with Apple School Manager
361
Tracking Your Device Orders
After you place an order for devices (such as iPads) with an Apple Authorized Reseller or 
a carrier, the reseller or carrier updates Apple with details of the devices. Apple School 
Manager sends you (assuming you’re the administrator) e-mail messages to let you know 
the progress of the order.
■
■Note   The Apple School Manager messages come from the address noreply@email 
.apple.com. Add this address to your contacts or to a whitelist to make sure the messages 
don’t go into your Junk folder.
The e-mail messages have the five subject lines shown in the following list:
• 
Devices Submitted: This message tells you that the reseller or 
carrier has submitted the order.
• 
Devices Pending: This message alerts you to the fact that you 
need to add the reseller or carrier’s DEP Reseller ID to your Apple 
School Manager account.
• 
Devices Available: This message lets you know that the devices are 
available to be enrolled in your Apple School Manager account.
• 
Submission Errors: This message warns you that the reseller’s or 
carrier’s submission to Apple contained errors and that you need 
to follow up with the reseller or carrier to sort out the problem.
• 
Devices Removed: This message tells you that one or more devices 
have been removed from the order submitted by the reseller or 
carrier. You’ll see this message if you return all or some of the 
devices in an order to the reseller or carrier.
Managing Your MDM Servers for Assigning Devices
To assign your devices, you must set up one or more MDM servers, communicate their 
identity to Apple, and authorize them by installing a server token (a digital identifier) on 
each server. How you transfer the token depends on the MDM solution you’re using.
■
■Note   Server tokens last only for a year, so you’ll need to replace them every year with 
new tokens that you generate and download through Apple School Manager. Most MDM 
solutions warn you when your server tokens are about to expire, but some solutions don’t, so 
it’s a good idea to keep a log of when you install server tokens and when you replace them.

Chapter 5 ■ Managing iPads with Apple School Manager
362
Adding an MDM Server
Follow these steps to add an MDM server to your Apple School Manager account:
	
1.	
Click the MDM Servers item in the sidebar.
	
2.	
Click the Add New MDM Server button.
	
3.	
Type a unique name for the server.
■
■Note  You don’t need to use fully qualified domain names (such as mdmserver1 
.notionalacademy.com) for your MDM servers if you don’t want to. If you prefer, you can 
create descriptive names based on where the servers are located, such as Main Building 
MDM Server 1.
	
4.	
Select the public key certificate file, and then click the Upload 
button.
	
5.	
Click the Save button.
	
6.	
Click the Get Token button, and then click the Get Server 
Token item on the pop-up menu.
	
7.	
Upload the server token to the appropriate MDM server, 
following your MDM vendor’s instructions.
	
8.	
Click the Set as Default button if you want this server to be the 
default MDM server for devices you purchase from now on.
Editing and Deleting MDM Servers
Sooner or later, you’ll likely need to edit the details for an MDM server. To do so, click the 
MDM Servers item in the sidebar, and then click the server you want to affect. You can 
then take the following actions on the server:
• 
View the server’s details, including the public key certificate, the 
server token, and the last connected IP address.
• 
View the assigned devices by device type and quantity, and 
download a comma-separated values file containing the assigned 
devices’ serial numbers.
• 
Rename the server.
• 
Make the server the default server, or change the default from this 
server to another server.
• 
Upload a public key certificate.
• 
Generate and download a new server token.

Chapter 5 ■ Managing iPads with Apple School Manager
363
To delete an MDM server, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Click the MDM Servers item in the sidebar.
	
2.	
Click the server you want to delete.
	
3.	
Click the Delete Server button.
	
4.	
Click the OK button in the confirmation dialog that opens.
	
5.	
Click the MDM server to which you want to reassign the devices.
	
6.	
Click the Reassign & Delete button.
Assigning Your Devices to Your MDM Servers
After your reseller or carrier ships your order, you can use the order number to assign 
some or all the devices in the order to one of your MDM servers. To assign devices, follow 
these steps:
	
1.	
Click the Device Assignments item in the sidebar.
	
2.	
Click the button for the device assignment method you want 
to use. You have three options:
• 
Serial Number: Enter the serial number of each device, 
separated by commas. This method is usually convenient 
only for small numbers of devices.
• 
Order Number: Enter the order number. This is usually the most 
convenient way of assigning large numbers of devices.
• 
Upload CSV File: Select the comma-separated values (CSV) file 
that contains the serial numbers for the devices you want to 
add.
■
■Tip  If you need to split the devices in an order between your MDM servers, download a 
CSV file containing all the s	 erial numbers in the order, and then divide that CSV file into 
smaller files containing the groups of devices you need.
	
3.	
Click the Perform Action pop-up menu, click the Assign 
to Server item on the pop-up menu, and then click the 
appropriate server.
	
4.	
Click the Done button.
■
■Note   If you have an Apple Authorized Service Provider replace an iPad or other iOS 
device that was enrolled in Apple School Manager, you can normally enroll the replacement 
device. You can identify the device using its order number, which starts with R because it is 
a replacement. Assign the device manually to your MDM server.

Chapter 5 ■ Managing iPads with Apple School Manager
364
REVIEWING YOUR SCHOOL’S DEVICE ASSIGNMENTS
When you need to see which devices are assigned where, click the Assignment 
History item in the sidebar to display the list of assignments. Then click the Details 
button on an assignment to display the details for that assignment. You can then see 
the following details:
•	
The number of devices in the assignment
•	
The order numbers for the devices
•	
The date each device was assigned or unassigned
•	
The MDM server to which each device is assigned
•	
Who assigned each device to the MDM server
Click the Download button if you want to download a CSV file containing the serial 
numbers of the devices in the assignment.
Unassigning and Reassigning Devices
If you move a device from one location to another, you can unassign the device from its 
current MDM server and assign it to another MDM server.
To unassign a device, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Click the Device Assignments item in the sidebar.
	
2.	
Click the button for the device unassignment method you 
want to use. Your options are the same as for assigning 
devices:
• 
Serial Number: Enter the serial number of each device, 
separated by commas. Use this method for unassigning small 
numbers of devices.
• 
Order Number: Enter the order number. Use this method for 
unassigning a whole order’s worth of devices.
• 
Upload CSV File: Select the comma-separated values (CSV) 
file that contains the serial numbers for the devices you want 
to unassign. This is often the most convenient method of 
unassigning devices.
	
3.	
Click the Perform Actions pop-up menu, and then click the 
Unassign Devices item on the pop-up menu.
	
4.	
Click the Done button.

Chapter 5 ■ Managing iPads with Apple School Manager
365
After unassigning the devices, you can reassign them by assigning them to a different 
MDM server.
Releasing Devices from Apple School Manager
When you no longer need to manage a device with Apple School Manager, you can release 
the device, removing it permanently from the Apple School Manager system. Apple 
School Manager’s terms and conditions require schools to release any devices that they 
no longer own. If, for example, your school transfers ownership of iPads to students when 
they leave the school, you’ll need to release those iPads from Apple School Manager.
■
■Caution   You can never add back a device that you’ve released from Apple School 
Manager, so don’t be tempted to try out the command.
To release one or more devices from Apple School Manager, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Click the Device Assignments item in the sidebar.
	
2.	
Click the button for the device release method you want to 
use. Your options for identifying the devices should seem 
familiar by now:
• 
Serial Number: Enter the serial number of each device, 
separated by commas. Use this method for releasing 
individual devices or small groups of devices.
• 
Order Number: Enter the order number. Use this method for 
releasing a whole order’s worth of devices.
• 
Upload CSV File: Select the comma-separated values (CSV) 
file that contains the serial numbers for the devices you 
want to release. This method tends to give you the greatest 
flexibility.
	
3.	
Click the Perform Actions pop-up menu, and then click the 
Release Devices item on the pop-up menu.
	
4.	
Click the Done button. A confirmation dialog opens.
	
5.	
Select the I Understand That This Cannot Be Undone check 
box.
	
6.	
Click the Release button.
	
7.	
Click the OK button. Apple School Manager releases the 
devices.

Summary
In this chapter, you’ve learned about Apple School Manager, Apple’s one-stop solution 
for deploying and managing Macs and iOS devices in schools. You now know when to 
work directly in Apple School Manager and when to work indirectly through your MDM 
solution instead. When working directly in Apple School Manager, you know how to sign 
up your school, run Setup Assistant to get started, and work with locations, user accounts, 
classes, roles, and devices.
In the next chapter, we’ll look at how to manage iPads using MDM tools.

CHAPTER 6
Managing iPads with Mobile 
Device Management
This chapter discusses how to manage your school’s iPads with mobile device 
management (MDM) solutions. MDM enables you to automate many aspects of 
deploying, configuring, and controlling iPads, so if your school has any serious 
deployment of iPads, you’ll likely be using MDM.
Many different MDM solutions are available, most of which work with not only iOS 
devices (such as iPads) but also with other operating systems for mobile devices, such as 
Android, Windows, macOS, and Windows Phone. There’s a good chance that your school 
has already implemented an MDM solution—in which case, you’ll presumably want to use 
that solution for managing your iPads rather than layering another MDM solution on top.
I don’t know which (if any) MDM solution your school is using, and there’s no way 
this chapter can cover all of them—so the chapter takes a more general approach. We’ll 
start by getting an overview of the MDM solutions available for managing iPads and 
discussing the key differences among them, in case your school doesn’t have an MDM 
solution and you need to choose one. We’ll then look at key aspects of what you can 
do to iPads using MDM solutions, using a couple of MDM solutions for examples. This 
coverage is also general, because although most MDM solutions have similar capabilities, 
they implement those capabilities in different ways.
Understanding and Choosing Mobile Device 
Management Solutions for iPad
As discussed in earlier chapters, Apple has built various management capabilities 
into iOS. You can use Apple Configurator and Apple School Manager to tap into these 
management capabilities, but you can also use third-party MDM solutions. For example, 
you can use MDM to set up an iPad automatically, apply profiles and other restrictions to 
the iPad over the air, locate an iPad if it goes missing, or even wipe a lost iPad remotely.
As of this writing, many different MDM solutions are available that include 
capabilities for managing Apple devices; most tools work for both Macs and iOS devices, 
because macOS also contains extensive management capabilities, and many work for 
other mobile operating systems as well. In this chapter, we’ll concentrate on MDM 
solutions for iOS, because this book is about deploying the iPad.

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
368
You’ll find that most of the MDM tools offer similar functionality with iPads. That’s 
because Apple has made iOS expose a certain set of capabilities to MDM tools, and most 
MDM vendors implement all those capabilities so as to compete effectively with each other.
If you need to choose an MDM solution for your school, your starting point will likely 
be the number of iPads and other devices your school plans to deploy. Chances are, the 
more devices you need to manage, the heavier-duty your MDM will need to be, because 
heavier-duty MDM gives you more management capabilities and can reduce the amount 
of time and effort you need to expend.
Apart from the number of devices, you’ll probably want to concentrate on four key 
differentiating points when choosing an MDM solution:
• 
Cloud-based MDM versus server-based MDM: Some MDM 
solutions work entirely in the cloud: you log in via a web browser 
on whichever computer or device you happen to be using, and 
perform all your administration through the browser. The data is 
stored in the cloud. Other MDM solutions require you to run an 
app on a server locally. Some server-based MDM solutions also 
let you store data in the cloud.
• 
Client operating systems: Some MDM solutions can handle not 
only iOS but also Android, Windows, macOS, and other operating 
systems, such as Windows Phone and Chrome OS. If you’re 
choosing an MDM solution for your school, you’ll presumably 
want it to be able to handle all the operating systems you’re 
currently using and any you plan to add in the foreseeable future.
• 
Cost: Some MDM solutions have straightforward pricing, such as 
$2 per device per month; some have different levels of per-device-
per-month pricing to let you choose the features you need. For 
other MDM solutions, costs are much more opaque, and you may 
need to specify your school’s requirements before you can learn 
the price.
• 
Support for education features in iOS 9.3 and later versions: iOS 
9.3, released in January 2016, added support for Apple School 
Manager (discussed in Chapter 5), for the Shared iPad feature 
(discussed in Chapter 5), and for the Classroom app (discussed 
in Chapter 8). If you need to use any of these features, you’ll need 
an MDM solution that supports them. Table 6-1 summarizes 
the MDM solutions that Apple identifies as fully supporting the 
education features in iOS 9.3 and later versions.

■Note   Various MDM solutions have changed hands and names over the past few years. 
For example, in November 2012, Cisco Systems bought Meraki; in January 2014, VMWare 
bought AirWatch; and in January 2017, LANDESK and HEAT Software merged to form Ivanti 
(www.ivanti.com). Also in early 2017, JAMF Software renamed Casper Suite to Jamf Pro 
and Bushel to Jamf Now. So, if any of the MDM solutions or the websites seems to have 
gone missing, try searching to see if it has been bought, consolidated, or renamed.
Setting Up, Navigating, and Configuring Your 
MDM Solution
If you’re adding MDM to your school, you’ll need to set up the MDM solution you’ve 
chosen, work out how to navigate its interface, and configure it with essential data 
and digital certificates. As you’d imagine, setup, navigation, and configuration vary 
hugely depending on the MDM solution, so this section skates briefly over these topics, 
providing a few examples.
Setting Up Your MDM Solution
Not surprisingly, setting up your MDM solution is entirely different for server-based 
MDM than for cloud-based MDM. For example, for the server-based VMWare AirWatch, 
you’ll need to choose which of several deployment configurations to use—single-server, 
multi-server, or a hybrid configuration—and then install the server software on suitable 
machines. By contrast, with a cloud-based MDM solution such as Meraki Systems 
Manager, you just need to log into your school’s account via a web browser.
Navigating Your MDM Solution
Once you’re logged in to your MDM solution, you’ll need to come to grips with its 
interface. There’s too much variation here to cover sensibly, but the MDM vendors 
usually try to make navigation as straightforward as possible. Here are two examples:
• 
TabPilot: The TabPilot control center is called Control Tower. 
The sidebar on the left side of the window gives you access to 
the Dashboard screen (shown in Figure 6-1), the collapsible 
Organization pane, the collapsible Location pane, and the Status 
screen.

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
371
• 
Meraki Systems Manager: You access most of the commands 
by clicking the Systems manager button or the Organization 
button in the sidebar on the left of the window and then making 
a choice in the pop-up panel that opens. Figure 6-2 shows Meraki 
Systems Manager with the Systems manager pop-up panel open, 
which gives access to three categories of commands: the Monitor 
category, the MDM category, and the Configure category.
Figure 6-1.  TabPilot’s Control Tower features a sidebar on the left that gives you access to 
the Dashboard, items in the Organization category, items in the Location category, and the 
Status screen

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
372
Configuring Your MDM Solution
Either during setup or as you find your way around, you’ll need to perform some 
configuration in your MDM solution. Again, the specifics vary depending on the MDM 
solution, but you’ll normally need to enter information about your organization, choose 
security settings, and so forth.
First, locate the settings you need. For example, in Meraki Systems Manager, you 
click the Organization tab on the left to display the Organization pop-up panel (see 
Figure 6-3). You can then go to the Configure column on the right of the pop-up panel 
and click the appropriate button, such as the Settings button, to bring you to the settings 
screen, such as the Meraki Systems Manager Settings screen shown in Figure 6-4.
Figure 6-2.  In Meraki Systems Manager, you navigate by clicking the appropriate button 
(such as the Systems manager button) in the sidebar on the left and then making a choice 
from the pop-up panel that opens

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
373
Figure 6-3.  In your MDM solution, navigate to the area for configuring settings. For 
example, in Meraki Systems Manager, click the Organization button in the sidebar, and 
then click the Settings button in the Configure column
Figure 6-4.  This Settings screen in Meraki Systems Manager enables you to configure 
organization, security, SAML configuration, administration, privacy, SNMP, and 
Dashboard API access settings

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
374
In this example, you can configure the settings explained in the following list. Most 
MDM solutions have similar settings, although the names vary.
• 
Name: Type your school’s name in this box.
• 
Password expiration: Choose whether to force users to change 
their passwords periodically—for example, every 30 days or every 
90 days. Forcing password changes is usually not helpful unless 
your organization requires you to do so.
• 
Used passwords: Choose whether to prevent users from reusing 
a specific number of recent passwords—for example, the last 10 
passwords.
• 
Strong passwords: Choose whether to force users to choose strong 
passwords or allow them to use weak passwords if they want. 
If users will keep any sensitive or valuable data on their iPads, 
strong passwords are a must.
• 
Account lockout: Choose whether to lock a user account after 
a specific number of failed login attempts. Setting an account 
lockout is good for security, but you’ll need to allow the user a 
reasonable number of attempts to type the credentials accurately.
• 
Idle timeout: Choose whether to log users out automatically after 
a specific number of minutes of activity.
• 
Two-factor authentication: Choose whether to force users to set 
up and use two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication 
is a great security measure for iPads that go beyond the school’s 
boundaries. If the iPads remain within the school, you likely don’t 
need to use two-factor authentication.
• 
Login IP ranges: Choose whether to restrict access to the MDM 
solution to IP addresses in those ranges that you specify. This 
feature can help you to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to 
your MDM solution.
• 
SAML SSO: Choose whether to use Security Assertion Markup 
Language (SAML) for authenticating users and providing a means 
of Single Sign-On (SSO). If you choose the SAML SSO Enabled 
item in the SAML SSO pop-up menu, click the Add a SAML IdP 
link to add a SAML Identity Provider.
• 
Licensing notifications: Choose whether to send licensing 
notifications only to administrators in your organization.
• 
Block Meraki support: Choose whether to block Meraki’s support 
from viewing your organization.
• 
SNMP Version 2C: Choose whether to enable or disable Simple 
Network Management Protocol (SNMP) version 2C.

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
375
• 
SNMP Version 3: Choose whether to enable or disable SNMP 
version 3.
• 
SNMP IP Restrictions: Choose whether to restrict SNMP to 
specific IP addresses or ranges, or to allow SNMP queries from all 
IP addresses.
• 
Dashboard API access: Choose whether to enable access to the 
Cisco Meraki Dashboard API.
As another example, in TabPilot’s Control Tower, you click the Settings button in the 
Organization pane in the sidebar to display the Settings screen (see Figure 6-5). Here, you 
can click the seven tabs across the top to configure the following categories of settings:
• 
System: On this tab, you can choose which country’s Apple App 
Store to use (for example, United States) and enable or disable the 
Apple Classroom app.
• 
Permissions: On this tab (shown in Figure 6-5), you can specify 
the permissions for the Teacher group, the Technician group, the 
Location Admin group, and the Organization Admin group.
Figure 6-5.  Click the seven tabs—System, Permissions, Apple VPP, Apple DEP, 
Backgrounds, Organization whitelist, and Organization blacklist—across the top of 
TabPilot’s Control Tower to access different categories of settings

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
376
• 
Apple VPP: On this tab, you can add your school’s membership in 
Apple’s Volume Purchase Program.
• 
Apple DEP: On this tab, you can add your school’s membership in 
Apple’s Device Enrollment Program. You can also control which 
setup screens the iOS Setup Assistant displays when an iPad is 
being set up.
• 
Backgrounds: On this tab, you can upload and manage 
background images to use in screen layouts.
• 
Organization whitelist: On this tab, you can build a whitelist of 
websites your school permits access to.
• 
Organization blacklist: On this tab, you can build a blacklist of 
websites that your school blocks.
Downloading a Signed Certificate from Apple
Depending on the MDM solution, you may need to add a signed certificate (a digital 
identifier) from Apple before you can start managing iOS devices or Macs. If so, the 
MDM solution normally provides easy-to-follow steps for requesting the certificate and 
installing it. For example, Figure 6-6 shows the APNS (Apple Push Notification Service) 
screen in Meraki Systems Manager, which walks you through these three steps:
• 
Downloading a Certificate Signing Request (CSR for short).
• 
Going to Apple’s Push Certificates Portal, uploading the CSR (thus 
telling Apple which MDM vendor you want to use), and then 
downloading the push certificate. The certificate has the .pem file 
extension.
• 
Uploading the push certificate to the MDM vendor.

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
377
Once you’ve done this, you’ll typically see confirmation that the push notification 
certificate is configured correctly. Figure 6-7 shows the screen you see in Meraki Systems 
Manager.
Figure 6-6.  You may need to add a signed certificate from Apple before you can start using 
MDM. The MDM vendor typically walks you through the process of getting and adding the 
certificate

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management

Managing iPads with MDM
Once you’ve set up your MDM solution and configured its settings, you should be ready 
to start managing your school’s iPads. This section shows actions that you can take with a 
typical MDM solution, again using Meraki Systems Manager and TabPilot for examples. 
As in the rest of this chapter, exactly what you can do will depend on the MDM solution 
you’re using.
Enrolling iPads in Your MDM Solution
Once you’ve added any push notification certificate needed for your MDM solution to 
work (as discussed in the previous section), you can start enrolling your iPads in the 
MDM solution. Depending on the MDM solution, you can usually enroll an iPad in any of 
several ways:
• 
Manually
• 
Using Apple Configurator
• 
Using DEP
Figure 6-7.  The MDM solution tells you when the push notification certificate is configured 
correctly

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
379
Enrolling an iPad Manually
The first way of enrolling iPads in your MDM solution is enrolling them manually. This 
example uses Meraki Systems Manager:
	
1.	
Click the Systems manager button in the sidebar to display the 
pop-up panel.
	
2.	
Click the Clients button in the Monitor column to display the 
Client list screen.
	
3.	
Click the Add Devices button. The Add Devices screen 
appears (see Figure 6-8), offering you the choice between 
using the Mobile Browser method and the iOS App method. 
The Mobile Browser method uses a browser app (such as 
Safari) on the iPad; the iOS App method involves installing a 
custom app on the iPad. In this example, we’ll use the Mobile 
Browser method.
Figure 6-8.  From the Add Devices screen in Meraki Systems Manager, you can add an iPad 
by navigating to the Meraki website and entering a network ID or by scanning a QR code in 
the SM iOS app

Optionally, tap one of the buttons in the Signing Certificates 
box to display the details of that certificate. Tap the Back (<) 
button in the upper-left corner when you’re ready to return to 
the Meraki Management dialog.
	
10.	
When you finish viewing the contents of the profile, tap the 
Install Profile (<) button to return to the Install Profile dialog.
	
11.	
Tap the Install button. The Enter Passcode dialog opens.
	
12.	
Type your login passcode for the iPad to authorize installing 
the profile. A second Install Profile dialog opens.
	
13.	
Tap the Install button. The iPad enrolls the Meraki certificates 
and then displays the Warning dialog (see Figure 6-12) 
to let you know that installing the profile will allow the 
administrator to remotely manage the iPad.

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
382
	
14.	
Tap the Install button. The Remote Management dialog opens 
(see Figure 6-13).

Figure 6-14), confirming that the profile has been installed.

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
383
	
16.	
Tap the Done button. The iPad then displays the Safari 
window again (see Figure 6-15), where the Meraki SM Setup 
page confirms that registration is complete.
Figure 6-15.  The Meraki SM Setup page in Safari confirms that registration is complete for 
this iPad
Figure 6-14.  The Profile Installed dialog opens to confirm that you have installed the 
profile on the iPad
You can now start managing the iPad with Meraki Systems Manager.

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
384
Enrolling an iPad Using Apple Configurator
Some MDM solutions enable you to enroll an iPad by downloading a profile and 
installing it using Apple Configurator. The following example illustrates this process using 
TabPilot.
	
1.	
Click the Device Groups button in the Organization pane in the 
sidebar to display the Device Groups screen (see Figure 6-16).
Figure 6-16.  On the Device Groups screen in TabPilot Control Tower, click the device group 
into which you want to enroll the iPad
Note  Enrolling an iPad using Apple Configurator in TabPilot requires you to select a device 
group. If you haven’t yet created any device groups, click the Create button on the Device 
Groups screen to start creating a new device group. For example, you might create a device 
group for a class or for a classroom.
	
2.	
Click the device group into which you want to enroll the iPad. 
The screen for the device group appears.
	
3.	
Click the Device group details tab to display its contents (see 
Figure 6-17).

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
385
	
4.	
Click the “Click to download” link on the Enrollment profile 
line. Safari downloads the enrollment profile, which causes 
the System Preferences app to open and display a dialog 
prompting you to install the profile (see Figure 6-18).
Figure 6-18.  In this dialog, you can click the Show Profile button to display the profile 
details or click the Continue button to install the profile
Figure 6-17.  On the Device group details tab for the device group, click the “Click to 
download” link on the Enrollment profile line

386
	
5.	
Click the Continue button. A confirmation dialog opens (see 
Figure 6-19).
Figure 6-19.  Click the Install button in the confirmation dialog if you want to install the 
profile, making your Mac trust the MDM provider
	
6.	
Click the Install button, and then authenticate yourself by 
typing your account password and clicking the OK button 
in the authentication dialog that opens. The Profiles screen 
in System Preferences then displays the profile’s details (see 
Figure 6-20).
Figure 6-20.  The Profiles screen shows the details of the profile you installed

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
387
	
7.	
In Apple Configurator, select the iPad or iPads you want to 
enroll.
	
8.	
Choose Actions ➤ Add ➤ Profiles from the menu bar to open 
the dialog for selecting profiles.
	
9.	
Click the profile you downloaded. You’ll normally find it in 
your Downloads folder unless you’ve put it elsewhere. The file 
will have a name such as enroll.mobileconfig.
	
10.	
Click the Add button. Apple Configurator adds the profile to 
the iPad.
Enrolling an iPad via DEP
If your school is signed up for Apple’s Device Enrollment Program (DEP), you can use 
DEP as the easiest way to enroll iPads in your MDM solution.
Before you can enroll iPads using DEP, you must enter your DEP account in your 
MDM solution. How you do this depends on the MDM solution. For example, as you 
saw earlier in this chapter, in TabPilot Control Tower, you click the Settings button in the 
Organization pane in the sidebar, click the Apple DEP tab on the tab bar to display the 
Apple DEP controls, and then click the Add button.
Once you’ve configured the DEP account, enrollment takes place automatically 
during setup. After you power on the iPad, you choose the language on the Language 
screen, choose the region on the Region screen, and connect to a Wi-Fi network on 
the Wi-Fi screen as usual. When the iPad is connected to the Wi-Fi network, a message 
appears saying that your institution will automatically configure the iPad. iOS then 
downloads and installs the MDM profile and walks you through the remaining setup 
steps.
Viewing a List of Clients
Once you’ve enrolled your iPads in the MDM solution, they show up in the MDM 
solution’s client list. How you reach the client list depends on the MDM solution, but it’s 
usually easy enough to find. For example, in Meraki Systems Manager, you can click the 
Systems Manager button in the sidebar and then click the Clients button in the Monitor 
column of the Systems Manager pop-up panel to display the Client list screen (see 
Figure 6-21).

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
388
From a client list, you can take actions such as these:
• 
Select the clients you want to affect: Select the check box for each 
client.
• 
View details for a client: Click the client in the Client list to display 
the details screen (see Figure 6-22).
Figure 6-21.  From the Client list screen in Meraki Systems Manager, you can quickly 
manipulate one or more devices with a single action. You can also display details for a 
particular device

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
389
• 
Apply or remove tags: Use the tag controls, such as the Tag pop-up 
menu in Meraki Systems Manager, to apply tags to the clients or to 
remove existing tags.
• 
Set or clear the location: Use the location controls, such as the 
Location pop-up menu in Meraki Systems Manager, to work with 
the clients’ locations.
• 
Move the clients from one network to another: Use a Move 
command, such as the Move pop-up menu in Meraki Systems 
Manager, to move the selected clients to a different network as 
needed.
• 
Give commands and enable features: Use a feature for giving 
commands, such as the Command pop-up menu in Meraki 
Systems Manager (see Figure 6-23), to give commands such as 
Reboot, Shut Down, Enable Single App Mode, Install available OS 
updates, Sync apps, or Sync profiles.
Figure 6-22.  Display the details screen for a client to zero in on specific information

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
390
• 
Quarantine a client: Use a quarantine feature, such as the 
Quarantine pop-up menu in Meraki Systems Manager, to give 
quarantine-related commands, such as authorizing the use of 
a file that has been quarantined or running a selective wipe of 
quarantined files.
Viewing an iPad’s Device Management or Removing 
Management
Working on an iPad, you can quickly view which device management (if any) has been 
applied. If the device management is not locked in place, you can remove it.
To view the device management, press the Home button to go to the Home screen 
and choose Settings ➤ General ➤ Device Management. On the Device Management 
screen (see Figure 6-24), you can tap the button in the Mobile Device Management box to 
display the details of the device management (see Figure 6-25).
Figure 6-23.  From a command feature, such as the Command pop-up menu in Meraki 
Systems Manager, you can give commands such as Reboot, Shut Down, Install available OS 
updates, or Sync apps

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
391
If the Remove Management button appears, you can tap it to start removing the 
device management. Authenticate yourself by typing your passcode for the iPad in 
the Enter Passcode dialog that opens, and then tap the Remove button in the Remove 
Management dialog that opens next (see Figure 6-26).

device management from the iPad

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
392
After iOS removes the management, the Profile screen appears, either showing any 
remaining profiles that are installed or (if there are none) the readout “No profiles are 
currently installed.”
Separating Devices into Different Groups
MDM solutions typically enable you to separate your devices into different groups so that 
you can treat them differently. For example, you can assign specific apps or access rights 
to a group so that all the group’s devices have those apps and rights.
Using groups can greatly simplify administration, so you’ll likely want to look into 
the grouping features your MDM solution offers. Different MDM solutions not only 
use different terms for grouping but also provide different capabilities. Here are three 
examples:
• 
Jamf Pro: Jamf Pro enables you to create smart mobile device 
groups and static mobile device groups. The smart groups draw 
in all the devices that match the criteria you specify, like a Smart 
Playlist in iTunes. The static groups contain only those devices 
that you specifically assign to them, like non-smart playlists in 
iTunes.
• 
TabPilot: TabPilot provides device groups to which you assign 
devices. Each device can belong to only one device group at a 
time, but you can move devices from one device group to another 
as needed.
• 
Meraki Systems Manager: Meraki Systems Manager provides 
tags that you can apply either manually or dynamically. As an 
administrator, you can create tags manually—for example, you 
might create tags such as “Classroom_25” or “Library”—but 
Meraki Systems Manager also automatically generates tags 
based on device type (for example, “iOS devices” and “Android 
devices”), geofencing (such as “Geofencing – compliant devices”), 
and security policies.
Creating and Managing Users
MDM solutions enable you to create user accounts for different user types, such as 
administrators, technicians, teachers, and students. You can assign different capabilities, 
roles, and permissions to the different user types.
As with most of this chapter, the specifics depend on the MDM solution you’re using. 
For example, TabPilot divides users into Control Tower users, School users, and Apple 
School Manager users. Control Tower users are people who can log into Control Tower 
to perform administrative functions. TabPilot has four types of user roles: Organization 
Admin, Location Admin, Technician, and Teacher. School users are students who won’t 
need to perform any administration and so won’t need access to Control Tower. Apple 
School Manager users are users added through Apple School Manager. Figure 6-27 shows 
the School users tab of the Users screen in TabPilot Control Tower, from which you can 
add and delete users.

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
393
■
■Tip   Instead of adding users manually, you may be able to create them quickly by 
importing a list that you output from your school’s registration database. For example, 
TabPilot enables you to import a list from a comma-separated values (CSV) file.
Managing Apps
MDM solutions enable you to manage apps on your iPads automatically. You can 
typically add apps in three ways:
• 
Add commercial apps through Apple’s Volume Purchase Program 
(VPP)
• 
Add commercial apps directly from the App Store
• 
Add enterprise apps from your school
Assigning Apps with Volume Purchase Program
Most MDM solutions enable you to distribute and manage apps bought with Apple’s 
Volume Purchase Program, or VPP. VPP is usually the easiest and most efficient way to 
handle commercial apps for many iPads.
To use VPP, you need to set up your school’s VPP account in the MDM solution. This 
is a straightforward process that involves downloading the VPP service token file  
Figure 6-27.  To work with users in TabPilot Control Tower, you click the Users button in 
the Organization list in the sidebar, and then click the Control Tower users tab or the School 
users tab on the Users screen

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
394
(an electronic identifier) to the MDM solution. Here are two examples of where to 
perform this process:
• 
Meraki Systems Manager: Click the Systems manager button in 
the sidebar, and then click the VPP button in the MDM column of 
the Systems manager pop-up panel.
• 
TabPilot Control Tower: In the Organization box, click the Settings 
button to display the Settings screen, and then click the Apple 
VPP tab on the tab bar.
After setting up VPP, you can distribute VPP licenses in either of two ways:
• 
Assign licenses to iOS devices: This method uses an iOS device’s 
serial number to identify the device uniquely. Using this method, 
you can push apps to a device without the device having a user 
signed in using an Apple ID. With supervised devices, you can 
install apps “silently”—without the user being notified. You’d 
typically use this method with iPads kept in the classroom and 
shared among students.
• 
Assign licenses to users: This method requires a user to be signed 
in on the iPad with an Apple ID. You’d typically use this method 
with iPads issued to students.
■
■Note   There’s actually a third way to distribute VPP licenses: you can distribute codes 
that users then redeem. But Apple has deprecated this way of distributing VPP licenses—in 
other words, Apple has recommended people no longer use this method—and the other two 
methods are usually better.
Adding Apps from the App Store
You can also add apps from the App Store. This capability is useful both if you school 
doesn’t have a VPP account and when you want to add individual apps to iPads.
For example, in TabPilot Control Tower, you click the Apps button in the Location 
list in the sidebar to display the Apps screen. You can then click the Add app button to 
display the Add app dialog (see Figure 6-28). Here, you can click the VPP Apps tab or 
the App Store tab to display the appropriate controls, search for an app, select its check 
box, and then click the Add button to add it. Select the Free only check box if you want to 
restrict the search to free apps.

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
395
Adding Enterprise Apps
If your school has developed apps in-house for teachers or students, you can distribute 
them as enterprise apps. For example, in Meraki Systems Manager, you go to the Apps 
screen, click the Add new button, and then click the iOS enterprise app item on the pop-
up menu. This brings you to the Enterprise iOS App screen (see Figure 6-29), where you 
identify the app, upload it to Meraki, and specify the devices on which to install the app 
and which options to use for the installation.
Figure 6-28.  In TabPilot Control Tower, you can search for apps on the App Store, 
optionally limiting results to free apps only. When you find an app you want to add,  
select its check box and click the Add button

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
396
Working with Profiles
To configure your school’s iPads, you can apply profiles to them via your MDM solution. 
Most MDM solutions enable you to create new managed profiles and upload profiles 
you’ve created in Apple Configurator. Depending on the MDM solution, you may be able 
to create profiles that are specific to that MDM solution and Apple-specific profiles.
■
■Note   See the section “Working with Configuration Profiles” in Chapter 4 for details on 
creating profiles in Apple Configurator.
For example, in Meraki Systems Manager, you start working with profiles by clicking 
the Systems manager button in the sidebar, and then clicking the Settings button in the 
MDM column. On the “Profiles & settings” screen, click the “Create a profile” button to 
start creating a profile. You can then set the profile’s name, description, removal policy, 
Figure 6-29.  You can use the Enterprise iOS App screen in Meraki Systems Manager to 
upload an enterprise app to your account so that you can load it onto your school’s iPads

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
397
and scope on the Profile configuration tab (see Figure 6-30). (The scope specifies the 
devices to which the profile applies—for example, All Devices, or just specific devices.)
Figure 6-30.  On the “Profiles & settings” screen in Meraki Systems Manager, enter the 
name and description for the profile, specify its removal policy, and choose which devices to 
apply it to
Next, click the Add settings tab and add restrictions to the profile (see Figure 6-31). 
Meraki Systems Manager breaks up the restrictions into different categories than Apple 
Configurator, but you can search to find the restrictions you need.

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
398
Scheduling Software Updates
Most MDM solutions enable you to manage updates to iOS on iPads you’ve enrolled in 
the MDM solution via DEP. This feature enables you to keep your school’s iPads up to 
date no matter where the iPads are physically located.
For example, in Meraki Systems Manager, display the Client list screen by clicking 
the Systems manager button in the sidebar and then clicking the Clients button in the 
Monitor column in the pop-up panel. You can then select the check box for each iPad you 
want to update, click the Command pop-up button, and then click the Install available 
OS updates item on the pop-up menu. In the confirmation dialog that opens, click the OK 
button to proceed.
■
■Tip   If the iPads are on the same network, it’s usually a good idea to stagger the 
updates over a few hours to avoid bandwidth problems.
Figure 6-31.  You can add restrictions and other settings to the profile—for example, 
controlling whether and when the user can use the iPad’s cameras

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management
399
Tracking Misplaced iPads with Lost Mode
Most MDM solutions enable you to use the Lost Mode feature to track down managed 
iPads that have gone missing. You need to enable Lost Mode before you can use it, and—
if you get the iPad back—disable Lost Mode afterward.
As you’d expect, different MDM solutions implement Lost Mode differently, but 
here’s an example using TabPilot:
	
1.	
In Control Tower, click the Device groups button in the 
Organization list to display the Device groups screen.
	
2.	
Click the group that contains the iPad you want to affect. The 
screen for the device group appears, showing the iPads in the 
device group.
	
3.	
Click the iPad to display its details screen. The Device details 
tab appears at first by default (see Figure 6-32).
Figure 6-32.  On the Device details tab for an iPad in TabPilot Control Tower, you click the 
Lost mode button to enable Lost Mode so that you can track the iPad’s location

Chapter 6 ■ Managing iPads with Mobile Device Management

4.	
Click the Lost mode button at the bottom of the screen. The 
“Lost mode”  dialog opens (see Figure 6-33).
Figure 6-33.  In the “Lost mode” dialog in TabPilot Control Tower, enter your contact 
phone number, a message to whoever finds the iPad, and any footnote needed
	
5.	
In the Phone number box, type your contact phone number.
	
6.	
In the Message box, type a message to the person who finds 
the iPad—for example, asking him or her to call the phone 
number to arrange the iPad’s return.
	
7.	
In the Footnote box, type any extra information needed.
	
8.	
Click the Lost mode button. TabPilot Control Tower sends the 
command to put the iPad into Lost mode. The iPad’s screen 
displays the phone number, message, and any footnote you 
set.
	
9.	
Click the Save button to save the changes.
Once you’ve enabled Lost mode, you can learn the iPad’s location by clicking the 
Device Location tab at the top of the details screen for the iPad, and then looking at the 
map that appears.
After you recover the iPad, you turn off Lost mode by clicking the “Disable lost 
mode” button on the Device details tab on the details screen for the iPad.

Summary
In this chapter, you’ve learned about using MDM solutions to manage your school’s 
iPads. You now know which MDM solutions fully support the education features in iOS 
9.3 and later versions. The specifics for most of the actions you can take with MDM vary 
depending on the MDM solution, but we’ve looked at examples of how you perform some 
of the most common actions.
In the next chapter, we’ll look at how to connect the iPads to files, printers, and other

CHAPTER 7
Accessing Files and Printing 
Documents
In this chapter, we’ll look at how to connect your school’s iPads to local storage and 
online storage for accessing existing files and creating new files. We’ll also cover how to 
print documents from iPads to your school’s printers.
We’ll start with local storage, which is typically the best bet for class-based iPad 
deployments. We’ll cover connecting to shared folders on both Windows Server and 
macOS Server. For macOS Server, we’ll also examine how to configure the File Sharing 
service to provide personal folders for iPad users and how to configure the Caching 
service to cache data and speed up network performance. After that, we’ll move on to 
online storage, which is usually the best choice for one-to-one deployments. We’ll go 
through the four leading online storage services—iCloud Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, 
Dropbox, and Google Drive—and how you access them on iPads. Finally, we’ll cover what 
you need to know about printing.
Accessing Files on Local Storage
For class-based iPad deployments, you’ll normally want to provide local storage for 
sharing files so that students can quickly access the files without burdening your school’s 
Internet connection. In this section, we’ll look first at how to access files in shared folders 
on Windows Server before moving on to look at accessing files in shared folders on 
macOS Server. We’ll also go through how to set up the Caching service on macOS Server 
to speed up file access.
Accessing Shared Folders on Windows Server
If your school uses Windows Server to share files, you can set up your school’s iPads to 
access those files.
Windows Server typically shares files via SMB, the Server Message Block protocol. 
As of this writing, iOS doesn’t include a feature for connecting to SMB shares, even in 
the new Files app included in iOS 11, so you’ll need to use a third-party app to make the 
connection. This section uses the FileExplorer app as an example.

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents
404
Getting the FileExplorer App
To get started, install the FileExplorer app on the iPad, either by using the App Store app 
on the iPad itself or by using Apple Configurator or an MDM solution.
■
■Note   FileExplorer comes in two versions, a free version (called FileExplorer) that’s 
limited to connecting to a single Windows share, and a paid version (called FileExplorer Pro, 
for $4.99) without limitations. You may want to use the free version to evaluate FileExplorer, 
but if you decide to use the app seriously, you will likely need to upgrade to FileExplorer Pro.
Once the app is installed, launch FileExplorer by tapping the FileExplorer icon on the 
Home screen. The FileExplorer screen appears (see Figure 7-1).
Figure 7-1.  FileExplorer is a third-party app that enables you to connect an iPad to 
various systems, including shared folders on Windows Server

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents
405
Connecting FileExplorer to a Windows Server Share
To connect FileExplorer to a Windows Server share, tap the New Connection (+) button at 
the top of the left pane in FileExplorer. The New Connections dialog opens (see Figure 7-2).
Tap the Windows button. A dialog opens showing fields for making the connection 
(see Figure 7-3). You can now connect to the shared folder in one of these ways:
• 
Fill in the fields: If you want to control the various aspects of 
the connection, fill in all the required fields in the Connection 
section, fill in optional fields as needed in the Connection section 
and the Connect As section, and set the various switches. Then 
tap the Save button. The following list explains the fields:
• 
Display Name: Type the descriptive name you want 
FileExplorer to display for the share. This field is optional, 
but it’s usually helpful to enter a name that makes clear what 
the shared folder is and what the user will find there.
Figure 7-2.  In the New Connection dialog in FileExplorer, tap the Windows button to start 
connecting to a Windows Server share

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents
406
• 
Host Name/IP: Type the server’s hostname or IP address.
• 
DNS Domain: If the Windows Server system is part of a 
domain, enter the domain name in this field.
• 
Path: In this optional field, enter the path to the shared 
folder.
• 
Port: Enter the port for connecting to the share. The default 
port for connecting to SMB over TCP/IP is 445.
• 
Show Hidden Files: Set this switch to On if you want 
FileExplorer to display hidden files in the shared folder. 
You may want to do this for administrators, but users don’t 
normally need to see hidden files.
• 
Show Admin Shares: Set this switch to On if you want 
FileExplorer to display Windows Server’s hidden 
administrative share points. Normally, you’d want to do this 
only for administrators, not for users.
Figure 7-3.  You can control the various aspects of the new connection by entering the 
details in the Connection section and the Connect As section of this dialog

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents
407
• 
Support DFS: Set this switch to On if you want FileExplorer 
to support DFS, the Distributed File System. You’d want to 
do this if the Windows Server system uses DFS to present 
a single view of shared folders that are located on different 
servers.
• 
User Name: Type the username for the connection—the 
user’s username on the Windows server. If the iPad is 
connecting as a domain member, enter the username 
preceded by the domain name and a backslash, such as 
SCHOOL1\mjones.
■
■Note  The User Name and Password fields are marked as optional because you can 
choose whether to store this information in the connection. Normally, storing the information 
in the connection is helpful, because it enables the iPad to connect to the shared folder 
thereafter without having to re-enter the username and password. If you don’t save the 
username and password in the connection, the user must enter them on the iPad when 
connecting to the shared folder.
• 
Password: Type the password corresponding to the 
username.
• 
Tap the server’s button in the Network Neighborhood section: The 
Network Neighborhood section at the bottom of the dialog shows 
a button for each server or shared folder that the FileExplorer app 
has detected (see Figure 7-4). To connect to the server or shared 
folder using default settings, tap the appropriate button. In the 
Connect As dialog that opens (see the left screen in Figure 7-5), 
tap the Registered User button to connect using a user account.  
In the Login dialog that then opens (see the right screen in  
Figure 7-6), type the user’s username and password for the 
Windows server, and then tap either the Login button  
(to log in without saving the credentials) or the Save & Login 
button (to log in and save the credentials).

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents

Working with Files on a Windows Server Shared Folder
Once you’ve connected FileExplorer to the Windows Server shared folder, the shared 
folder appears in the right pane in FileExplorer (see Figure 7-6). Tap the shared folder to 
display its contents.
Figure 7-5.  Tap the Registered User in the Connect As dialog (left) to connect using a user 
account. In the Login dialog (right), type the username and password, and then tap either 
the Login button or the Save & Login button, as needed
Figure 7-4.  You can also connect to a server or shared folder by tapping its name in the 
Network Neighborhood section at the bottom of the dialog

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents
409
The list of folders and files in the shared folder appears (see Figure 7-7). As usual, 
you can tap a folder to display its contents.
Figure 7-6.  Tap the shared folder to display its contents
Figure 7-7.  Tap a folder in the right pane of FileExplorer to display the folder’s contents
Once you’ve opened a folder, the list of files appears (see Figure 7-8). You can 
navigate the list of files by scrolling up and down, but you can also pull down on the 
screen a little way to display a toolbar of buttons above the file list (see Figure 7-9). You 
can then tap the Name, Date, Size, or Type button to sort the files by that attribute. An 
arrow indicates the sort field, pointing up for an ascending sort (alphabetical order, low 
numbers to high, early dates to later dates) or down for a descending sort. Tap the same 
button again to switch between ascending sort order and descending sort order.

remove Favorite status from the file, swipe left again, and then tap 
the Favorite button once more.
• 
Rename the file: Tap the Rename button to display the Rename 
dialog. Type the new name, and then tap the OK button.
• 
Delete the file: Tap the Delete button to display the Delete dialog, 
and then tap the Delete button in it.
Accessing Files on macOS Server Shared Folders
In this section, we’ll go through how to connect iPads to shared folders on macOS Server. 
macOS Server is designed to work with iOS devices, so we’ll dig into the topic in depth. 
First, I’ll cover setting up file sharing on macOS Server, including setting the File Sharing 
service to create personal folders for iOS users. Then I’ll examine how to use an iPad to 
access files in shared folders on macOS Server.
■
■Note   macOS Server also provides a Caching service that you can use to speed up 
access to files. I cover Caching service in the next main section.
Figure 7-11.  In the Share panel (left), tap the Open In button, and then tap the app in the 
Open In panel (right)

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents
413
Setting Up File Sharing on macOS Server
In this section, we’ll look at how to set up the File Sharing service on macOS Server 
to provide file storage accessible to your school’s iPads. You can set up both personal 
folders—a folder for each iOS user who connects to the server, and accessible only by that 
user—and shared folders that all users or multiple users can access.
Enabling the File Sharing Service
Your first move is to enable the File Sharing service on macOS Server if it’s not already 
enabled. On the Mac that’s running macOS Server, follow these steps to enable File 
Sharing:
	
1.	
In the Server app, go to the Services category in the sidebar. If 
the Services category is collapsed, move the pointer over the 
Services heading, and then click the Show button to expand 
the Services category.
	
2.	
Click the File Sharing item in the Services category to display 
the File Sharing pane (see Figure 7-12).
Figure 7-12.  In the File Sharing pane in macOS Server, set the switch in the upper-right 
corner to On to enable the File Sharing service

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents
414
	
3.	
Set the switch in the upper-right corner to On. macOS Server 
turns on the File Sharing service, and the Status readout 
shows the name under which the server appears in the Finder 
sidebar (see Figure 7-13).
Figure 7-14.  In the File Sharing dialog, choose whether to allow connections from all users 
or only specific users; and from all networks, private networks, or only some networks
Figure 7-13.  When you turn on the File Sharing service, the Status readout shows the 
name under which the server appears in the Finder sidebar
Controlling Which Users and Which Networks Can Access  
File Sharing
Your next move is to specify which users can access File Sharing, and from which 
networks those users can access it. For example, you may want to allow only some users 
to access File Sharing, or you may want to let them access File Sharing only from the local 
network, not across an Internet connection.
To specify which users and which networks can access File Sharing, click the Edit 
Permissions button in the Permissions section of the File Sharing pane. The File Sharing 
dialog opens (see Figure 7-14).
Open the Allow Connections From pop-up menu and choose the All Users item or 
the Only Some Users item, as needed. If you choose the Only Some Users item, the File 
Sharing dialog expands to display a box for adding user accounts from the list of accounts 
set up on the macOS Server system (see Figure 7-15).

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents
415
Set up the list of accounts by clicking the Add (+) button, typing the start of a 
username, selecting the appropriate match in the list that appears, and then pressing the 
Return key.
Next, specify the networks from which those users are allowed to connect to File Sharing. 
Open the When Connecting From pop-up menu, and then click the appropriate item:
• 
All Networks: Select this item to allow the specified users to 
connect from all networks.
• 
Private Networks: Select this item to allow the specified users to 
connect only from private networks—that is, networks that use 
the private IP address ranges.
UNDERSTANDING PRIVATE IP ADDRESS RANGES
There are three private IP address ranges:
•	
10.0.0.0–10.255.255: This is a single class A network that 
contains 16,777,216 IP addresses.
•	
172.16.0.0–176.31.255.255: This is 16 contiguous class B 
networks that contain 1,048,576 IP addresses.
•	
192.168.0.0–192.168.255.255: This is 256 contiguous class C 
networks that contain 65,536 IP addresses.
Normally, your school will already be using one of these private address ranges. 
Selecting the Private Networks item in the When Connecting From pop-up menu sets 
File Sharing to accept connections from whichever of these private address ranges 
the school is using.
Figure 7-15.  If you select Only Some Users in the Allow Connections From pop-up menu, 
click the Add (+) button and add each user to the box that appears

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents
416
• 
Only Some Networks: Select this item to allow the specified users 
to connect only from the networks you specify.
When you select the Only Some Networks item, the File Sharing dialog expands to 
show a box for the networks (see Figure 7-16). The Private Networks item appears in the list 
automatically and is selected at first; you can remove this item by clicking the Remove (–) 
button or by clicking the Add (+) button and then clicking the This Mac button instead.
Figure 7-17.  In the Create a New Network dialog, enter the name for the network, type the 
starting IP address and ending IP address, and then click the Create button
Figure 7-16.  When you select the Only Some Networks item in the When Connecting From 
pop-up menu, you can choose among Private Networks, This Mac, and one or more new 
networks you create
To add another network, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Click the Add (+) button to open the pop-up menu, and 
then click the Create a New Network item. The Create a New 
Network dialog opens (see Figure 7-17).
	
2.	
Type the name for the new network in the Name box.
	
3.	
Type the starting IP address, such as 10.0.0.100, in the Starting 
IP Address box.

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents
417
	
4.	
Type the ending IP address, such as 10.0.0.200, in the Ending 
IP Address box.
	
5.	
Click the Create button.
The new network appears in the box in the File Sharing dialog, and you can add 
other new networks if needed.
When you finish specifying which connections and networks to allow, click the OK 
button to close the File Sharing dialog and return to the File Sharing pane.
Setting File Sharing to Create Personal Folders and 
Configuring Access to Them
Next, in the Personal Folders section of the File Sharing pane, select the Create Personal 
Folders When Users Connect on iOS check box if you want macOS Server to automatically 
create a personal folder for each user who connects to the server using an iOS device. 
Given that you’re deploying iPads, you’ll normally want to do this.
If you’re just using iPads (or other iOS devices) and macOS Server, this is all you need 
do to connect the iPads so that they can create personal folders. But if you’re using other 
platforms, you may need to allow them access to the personal folders as well. To control 
access to the personal folders, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Click the Edit Personal Folder Access button in the File 
Sharing pane. The Personal Folder Access dialog opens  
(see Figure 7-18).
Figure 7-18.  In the Personal Folder Access dialog, specify which protocols to permit to 
access personal folders by selecting the SMB, AFP, and WebDAV check boxes, as needed. 
Select the Only Allow Encrypted Connections check box if you want to permit only 
encrypted connections.
	
2.	
On the Access row, select the appropriate check boxes:
• 
SMB: Select this check box to permit connections to the 
personal folders via the Server Message Block (SMB) 
protocol. SMB is the protocol Windows normally uses for 
accessing files on other computers.
• 
AFP: Select this check box to permit connections to the 
personal folders via the Apple File Protocol (AFP) protocol. 
AFP is the protocol macOS and OS X use by default for 
accessing files on other computers.

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents
418
• 
WebDAV: Select this check box to permit connections to 
the personal folders via the Web Digital Authoring and 
Versioning (WebDAV) protocol. WebDAV is a protocol that’s 
widely used for accessing files across an Internet connection 
rather than a local network connection.
	
3.	
On the Security row, select the Only Allow Encrypted Connections 
check box if you want to permit only encrypted connections to the 
personal folders. Selecting this check box makes the AFP check 
box on the Access row dimmed and unavailable.
	
4.	
Click the OK button to close the Personal Folder Access dialog 
and return to the File Sharing pane.
Setting Up Shared Folders
You can also set up shared folders accessible by all—or some of—the users. To do so, use 
the controls below the Shared Folders box in the File Sharing pane like this:
• 
Add a shared folder: Click the Add (+) button below the Shared 
Folders box. An unnamed dialog for selecting the folder opens. 
Navigate to the folder you want to share, and then click the 
Choose button. The folder appears in the Shared Folders box, and 
you can edit it as explained in the next bulleted paragraph.
■
■Note  You can click the New Folder button in the unnamed dialog to create a new folder 
within the current folder.
■
■Tip  For performance, Apple recommends putting shared folders on a separate drive 
from system drive of the Mac running macOS Server. For example, you might use a second 
hard drive or an external hard drive.
• 
Edit a shared folder: Click the shared folder you want to edit, and 
then click the Edit button (the button with the pencil icon). A 
dialog opens showing the folder’s details (see Figure 7-19). You 
can then take the following actions:
• 
Change the display name of the shared folder: Click in the 
Name box and edit the name. This changes only the name 
that users see for the folder. The folder’s name in the file 
system remains the same.

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents
419
• 
Browse the folder: Click the Browse button. If you’ve made 
any changes, macOS Server prompts you to save them. 
macOS Server then closes the dialog, selects the server in the 
Server list in the sidebar, and displays the Storage tab with 
the folder highlighted.
• 
Change access to the folder: In the Access area, select or 
clear the check boxes as needed. Select the iOS check box 
to allow iOS devices to access the shared folder. Select 
the SMB check box to allow access via SMB, such as from 
Windows PCs. Select the AFP check box to allow access 
via Apple File Protocol, the native Mac protocol; this check 
box is unavailable if you select the Only Allow Encrypted 
Connections check box.
• 
Change permissions for the folder: Use the controls in and 
below the Permissions box to set up the permissions for 
the folder. To add a user or group from the macOS Server 
system, click the Add (+) button below the Permissions box, 
start typing the username or group name on the new line 
that appears in the box, select the user or group from the 
list of matches, and then press the Return key. To remove 
a user or group, click the user or group in the Permissions 
box and then click the Remove (–) button. To change the 
permissions for a user or group, click the pop-up menu on 
the appropriate row in the Permissions box, and then click 
the appropriate item, such as Read & Write, Read Only, Write 
Only, or No Access.
■
■Note  The Write Only permission is for folders used as dropboxes. A user can copy or 
move files to a Write Only folder, but can’t view the contents of the folder.

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents
420
• 
Remove a shared folder: Click the shared folder you want to 
remove, and then click the Remove (–) button below the Shared 
Folders box. The Are You Sure You Want to Remove the Selected 
Share Point? dialog opens (see Figure 7-20). Click the Remove 
button to remove the shared folder.
Figure 7-20.  Click the Remove button in the Are You Sure You Want to Remove the 
Selected Share Point? dialog
Figure 7-19.  When you open a shared folder for editing, you can change the name, specify 
access types, and grant and revoke permissions

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents
421
When you finish configuring the shared folder, click the OK button to close the dialog 
and save the changes.
Using an iPad to Access Files on macOS Server
After setting up personal folders, shared folders, or both on macOS Server, you can 
connect an iPad to the server. You do this by setting up a macOS Server account on the 
iPad. You can set up the account either by working directly on the iPad, as explained in 
the next subsection, or by using policy, as discussed in the second subsection.
Connecting an iPad to macOS Server Manually
To connect an iPad to macOS Server manually, follow these steps on the iPad:
	
1.	
Choose Home ➤ Settings ➤ Mail to display the Mail screen in 
the Settings app.
	
2.	
Tap the Accounts button to display the Accounts screen  
(see Figure 7-21).
	
3.	
Tap the Add Account button to display the Add Account 
screen (see Figure 7-22).
Figure 7-21.  On the Accounts screen in the Settings app, tap the Add Account button to 
start adding a macOS Server account

6.	
Tap the appropriate button:
• 
If the macOS server appears by name, tap its button. A dialog 
opens (see Figure 7-25). Enter the user’s username for the 
macOS Server system and the corresponding password; if 
you want, edit the Description field to make the name more 
descriptive or more helpful, and then tap the Next button.
• 
If the server doesn’t appear by name, tap the Other button 
to display the dialog shown in Figure 7-26. Tap the Host 
Name field and type the server’s hostname or IP address. 
Tap the User Name field and type the username, then tap 
the Password field and type the password. iOS automatically 
enters in the Description field a description derived from the 
Host Name field; you can edit this to make the name more 
descriptive or more helpful. When you finish, tap the Next 
button. iOS attempts to establish a connection to the server.
Figure 7-26.  In this dialog, type the name of the macOS server, enter the username and 
password, improve the description if necessary, and then tap the Next button
Figure 7-25.  In the dialog for a server whose name appears, type the username and 
password, edit the server’s description if desired, and then tap the Next button

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents
424
	
7.	
Once the iPad has connected to the server, the macOS Server 
dialog opens (see Figure 7-27).
	
8.	
Set each switch, such as the File Sharing switch, to On or Off, 
as needed.
	
9.	
Tap the Save button to close the macOS Server dialog and save 
the connection. The server appears in the Accounts pane (see 
Figure 7-28).
Connecting an iPad to macOS Server via Policy
Connecting an iPad to macOS Server manually is useful sometimes, but you’ll normally 
want to use policy instead, either with Apple Configurator or with an MDM solution:
• 
Apple Configurator: Install on the iPad a profile that includes a 
macOS Server Account payload. See the section “Configuring a 
macOS Server Account Payload in the Profile” in Chapter 4.
• 
MDM solution: Use the MDM solution to install a profile that 
includes a macOS Server Account payload. How you do this 
depends on the MDM tool.
Figure 7-27.  In the macOS Server dialog, set the File Sharing switch and any other 
switches to On or Off, as needed, and then tap the Save button
Figure 7-28.  A button for the server appears in the Accounts pane

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents
425
■
■Note   Normally, you’ll create a payload in a profile to set up multiple iPads. In this 
case, each user will enter the username and password for the macOS Server account 
manually when installing the profile. In special cases, you may need to create a custom 
payload containing a payload for an individual user that includes that user’s username and 
password. Doing so is more labor intensive but makes setting up the macOS Server account 
that much easier for the user.
Using Shared Folders on a macOS Server
Once you’ve connected an iPad to macOS Server, you can use the server’s shared folders from 
any app that supports document management. Here’s an example using Apple’s Pages app:
	
1.	
Launch the Pages app. For example, press the Home button 
to display the Home screen, and then tap the Pages icon. 
Normally, when you launch Pages, the Pages screen appears 
by default; if a document opens instead, tap the Documents 
button to display the Pages screen.
	
2.	
Tap the Locations button in the upper-left corner of the Pages 
screen to display the Locations pop-up menu (see Figure 7-29).
	
3.	
Tap the OS X Server button to display the Browse dialog (see 
Figure 7-30).
■
■Note   If tapping the OS X Server button takes you straight to the dialog for a particular 
location other than the location you want to use, tap the Locations button in the upper-left 
corner of the dialog to return to the Browse dialog. You can then tap the appropriate location.
Figure 7-29.  On the Pages screen, tap the Locations button, and then tap the OS X Server 
item on the Locations pop-up menu

Tap the document you want to open. The document opens in 
Pages.
Setting Up Caching Service on macOS Server to Speed Up 
Data Delivery
macOS Server includes a Caching service that you can turn on to speed up data delivery 
on your network. You can configure the Caching service to work for all networks, only 
local networks, or only specific networks you choose. You can choose whether to share 
content with other caching servers, and you can specify whether to cache users’ personal 
iCloud data.
To set up the Caching service, follow these steps in macOS Server:
	
1.	
In the Server app, go to the Services category in the sidebar. If 
the Services category is collapsed, move the pointer over the 
Services heading, and then click the Show button to expand 
the Services category.
	
2.	
Click the Caching item in the Services category to display the 
Caching pane (see Figure 7-33).
Figure 7-32.  Tap the document you want to open from the server

Accessing Files on Online Storage
If your iPads stay within the school’s confines, you may need only local storage, not online 
storage. If so, great—local storage is not only almost always faster than online storage, but 
also doesn’t burden your school’s Internet connection.
But if your school has a one-to-one deployment of iPads, you’ll likely need to keep at 
least some files on online storage so that students can access them as easily when they’re 
outside the school as when they’re at school.
In this section, we’ll look at four major online storage services: iCloud, OneDrive, 
Dropbox, and Google Drive. Each online storage service has pros and cons that you’ll 
likely want to evaluate before deciding which service—or services—to use.
■
■Note   An alternative way of providing students with access to files when they’re outside 
the school is to enable them to access the school’s internal servers across the Internet 
connection, preferably using a virtual private network (VPN) for security. But unless your 
school has a heroically fast Internet connection or you’re dealing with very small numbers 
of students, this means of access is likely to be slow or hamstring the school’s Internet 
connection, or both.
Figure 7-40.  You can wipe the contents of the cache by clicking the Reset button in the 
Caching pane and then clicking the Reset button in the Reset Cache Content? dialog

Comparing iCloud Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, and 
Google Drive
The iCloud Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, and Google Drive online storage services can all 
be effective solutions for schools that deploy iPads. Here’s what you need to know about 
each of them:
• 
iCloud Drive: Apple’s iCloud Drive should be the first online 
storage service you evaluate because iOS includes built-in 
support for it. The iCloud Drive app included in most installations 
of iOS 10, and the Files app built into iOS 11, connect seamlessly 
to iCloud, and any app that includes the iOS document-
management features can connect to iCloud and store data in 
it. If your school uses Apple’s Pages, Numbers, and Keynote 
productivity apps, iCloud is usually the best online storage 
service. Microsoft’s Office apps can also store data on iCloud as 
well as on OneDrive. Each free iCloud account includes 5 GB of 
storage; as of this writing, you can upgrade to 50 GB ($0.99 per 
month), 200 GB ($2.99 per month), or 2 TB ($9.99 per month).
• 
OneDrive: Microsoft’s OneDrive is a natural fit if your school uses the 
Office apps, but it also offers strong all-round performance for storing 
everything from data files to photos and videos online. You can 
access OneDrive through the OneDrive app for iOS. Each OneDrive 
account provides 5 GB of storage for free. If you need more space, 
you can get a 50 GB storage-only OneDrive account for $1.99 per 
month or pay for an Office 365 account that includes more storage.
• 
Dropbox: Dropbox can be a great way to sync your documents, 
photos, and videos automatically across multiple devices and 
platforms—for example, to sync your files across an iPad, an 
iPhone, and one or more PCs. A free Dropbox account, called 
Dropbox Basic, provides 2 GB of storage for free—less than the other 
services mentioned here—but you can earn additional storage by 
encouraging other people to sign up for Dropbox accounts. You can 
also pay for extra space by getting a Dropbox Plus account, which 
provides 1 TB of space for $9.99 (monthly) or $99.99 (yearly).
■
■Note  Higher-educational institutions can also sign up for a Dropbox Education account, 
which gives 15 GB of storage per user but encourages the use of teams. For a team, each 
user’s 15 GB of storage is pooled, allowing individual team members to have more than  
15 GB of files as long as the team’s total stays below its limit.

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents
434
• 
Google Drive: Google’s online storage service, Google Drive, is 
likely to be the best choice if your school uses Google Apps rather 
than Microsoft Office or Apple’s apps for productivity. Google 
Drive offers 15 GB of space for free, but you can upgrade to 1 TB 
for $9.99 per month or 10 TB for $99.99 per month; Google Drive 
even offers 20 TB and 30 TB plans for seriously heavy users. You 
access Google Drive using the Google Drive app.
The downside to these online storage services is that most require you to install an 
app to access them—the OneDrive app for OneDrive, the Google Drive app for Google 
Drive, the Dropbox app for Dropbox, and so on. To help you deal with multiple online 
storage services, we’ll also look at an app that lets you access multiple online storage 
services—and that can even copy files from one online storage service to another.
Accessing Files on iCloud Drive
Each iPad comes fully equipped to access files on iCloud, so you (or the user) need only 
set up the appropriate Apple ID on the iPad. When configuring the iPad directly, you 
can choose settings on the iCloud screen to control which apps can store data in iCloud; 
when configuring the iPad via policy, you can choose whether to allow iCloud documents 
and data and whether to allow managed apps to store data in iCloud.
To browse folders and files stored in the iCloud account the iPad is connected to, you 
can use the iCloud Drive app on iOS 10 (see Figure 7-41) or the iCloud category in the 
Files app in iOS 11 (see Figure 7-42).

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents
435
■
■Tip   In iCloud Drive, you can pull down a short way on the screen to display tab buttons 
for browsing by date, name, or tags, plus a button for switching between a list layout and a 
grid layout.
Figure 7-41.  On iOS 10, use the iCloud Drive app to browse folders and files stored in the 
iCloud account the iPad is connected to

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents
436
When working within an app, you can tap the iCloud Drive button on the Locations 
pop-up menu to display the dialog for browsing iCloud Drive.
Accessing Files on OneDrive
To access files on OneDrive, install the Microsoft OneDrive app either manually from the 
App Store or via policy. Once the app is installed, launch it, and follow the prompts to 
enter the details of the Microsoft account.
■
■Note   You can also access files on OneDrive directly from Microsoft Office apps such as 
Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.
After signing in to OneDrive, you can browse your files, folders, and account details 
easily by tapping the five tabs at the bottom of the screen:
• 
Files tab: This tab (see Figure 7-43) displays the folders and files 
in your OneDrive account. As usual, tap a folder to open it so that 
you can see its contents.
Figure 7-42.  On iOS 11, use the iCloud Drive category in the Files app to browse folders 
and files in iCloud

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents
437
• 
Photos tab: This tab lets you browse your photos all together, by 
albums, or by tags you’ve applied to the photos. You can also 
enable or disable the Camera Upload feature, which automatically 
uploads photos you take with the Camera app.
• 
Recent tab: This tab displays a list of the files you’ve used recently. 
This list is often the most convenient way to resume work on a file.
• 
Shared tab: This tab displays the list of items that you’re sharing 
and lists of items that other OneDrive users are sharing with you. 
You can tap the Enable Notifications link to control whether you 
receive notifications when other people share items with you.
• 
Me tab: This tab enables you to add other Microsoft accounts to 
OneDrive, mark files for offline usage (storing them on your iPad 
and your other devices), see how much storage space you’ve used 
and how much remains available, retrieve files from the Recycle 
Bin, and choose settings for OneDrive.
Figure 7-43.  The Microsoft OneDrive app gives you easy access to your files and folders via 
the five tabs at the bottom of the screen

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents
438
Accessing Files on Dropbox
To access files on Dropbox, install the Dropbox app either manually from the App Store 
or via policy. After installing the app, launch it, and tap the Sign In button to start the 
process of signing in to the Dropbox account. You can then choose setup options, such as 
uploading some photos or backing up all the photos in the iPad’s Camera Roll folder.
Once you’ve signed in to Dropbox, you can use the four tabs at the bottom of the 
sidebar to navigate among your files and folders:
• 
Recents: Tap this tab to see a list of recent files and folders 
arranged in reverse chronological order, so the most recent ones 
appear first. You can tap a button to open that file or folder, or 
tap the down-arrow button to display a pop-up panel containing 
actions you can take with the file or folder. For example, for 
a document file, the pop-up panel contains the Share, Make 
Available Offline, Rename, Copy, Move, and Delete buttons.
Figure 7-44.  The Recents tab in the sidebar of the Dropbox app gives you quick access to 
files you have used recently. You can tap a file’s or folder’s down-arrow button to display a 
pop-up panel of actions you can take with that file or folder.

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents

• 
Files: Tap this button to display an alphabetical list of folders in 
your account. You can then tap a folder to display its contents.
• 
Photos: Tap this button to display the photos you’ve uploaded.
• 
Offline: Tap this button to display the list of files you’ve made 
available offline.
Accessing Files on Google Drive
To access files on Google Drive, install the Google Drive app either manually from the 
App Store or via policy. After installing the app, launch it and follow the prompts to 
connect the Google account. If Two-Step Verification is enabled on the Google account, 
the account holder must verify the connection via another means, such as by entering 
on the iPad a one-time verification code sent to the mobile phone number listed in the 
Google account.
■
■Note   You can also set up a Google account via policy. For example, in Apple 
Configurator, create a Google Account payload specifying the account. However, this means 
of setting up an account is somewhat labor intensive, because you must set up a separate 
payload (and thus a separate profile containing the payload) for each Google account. You 
can’t specify general parameters for the payload and have the user fill in the e-mail address 
for the Google account.
Once the account is connected, Google Drive displays the contents of the My Drive 
folder by default (see Figure 7-45). You can then configure and navigate your account 
using these moves:
• 
Get Notified About New Files prompt: If this prompt appears, tap 
the Turn On button or the No Thanks, button, as needed.
• 
Folders: In this area, tap the folder you want to open.

• 
Files: In this area, tap the file you want to open.
• 
New (+): Tap this button to display the New panel (see 
Figure 7-46). From here, you can create a new folder, upload 
one or more files, upload a photo you take with the camera, or 
create a new Google Docs document, Google Sheets workbook, 
or Google Slides presentation.
Figure 7-46.  The New panel enables you to create a new folder, create a new document, 
workbook, or presentation, upload a photo you take with the iPad’s camera, or upload a file

• 
Menu panel: To navigate from folder to folder, choose settings, 
or manage your notifications, tap the Menu button (the icon 
showing three horizontal lines) in the upper-left corner of the 
screen. Alternatively, simply swipe right from the left side of the 
screen. On the Menu panel (see Figure 7-47), tap the folder you 
want to access, tap the Notifications button to view notifications, 
tap the Settings button to display the Settings dialog, where you 
can review and change settings, or tap the Storage button to 
display the Storage dialog, which shows how much space you’re 
using and how much you have left.
■
■Note   You can also access files on Google Drive directly through the Google Docs apps.
Printing from iPads
Despite the contribution that iPads can make to keeping down the number of schoolbooks 
your students need, the paperless school remains a dream rather than a reality, and your 
students will likely need to print at least some documents from their iPads.
Figure 7-47.  Use the Menu panel to navigate among your folders, choose settings, and

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents

This section discusses which printers you can use for printing from iPads and other 
iOS devices, how to make those devices available via policy, and how to print.
Which Printers Can You Use?
Each iPad comes equipped to connect easily to—and print on—printers that support the 
AirPrint standard developed by Apple. Most current printers and many recent printers 
from major brands such as Brother, Canon, Epson, Konica-Minolta, Lexmark, Ricoh, 
and Samsung support AirPrint. If your school has relatively new printers, there’s a good 
chance at least some of them will have AirPrint.
■
■Note   For a full list of AirPrint-capable printers, visit the About AirPrint page on Apple’s 
website at https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201311.
If your school’s printers don’t support AirPrint, you can AirPrint-enable them in a 
couple of ways:
• 
Add an AirPrint-capable hardware print server: By adding an 
AirPrint-capable hardware print server, you can make non-
AirPrint printers available for printing via AirPrint. For example, 
the Lantronix XprintServer Office AirPrint Mobile Print Server 
($199.95 from the Apple Store) enables wireless printing from iOS 
devices to multiple printers.
• 
Add an AirPrint-capable software print server: You can run a 
software print server on a computer connected to the network to 
add AirPrint capability. Search for AirPrint printer software and 
the computer’s operating system to find out what’s available.
■
■Note   One low-budget possibility is to use a Raspberry Pi computer as a print server. If 
you do so, you can install the Avahi daemon (using the command sudo apt-get install 
avahi-daemon) to add AirPrint capability.
Making Printers Available to iPads via Policy
Once you’ve gotten your AirPrint-capable printers or printing system, you can use policy 
to connect the iPads to the printers. For example, in Apple Configurator, you create an 
AirPrint payload that specifies the hostname or IP address of the printer and the resource 
path to it. See the section “Configuring an AirPrint Payload in the Profile” in Chapter 4 for 
details. Similarly, you can use MDM solutions to connect iPads to printers.

Chapter 7 ■ Accessing Files and Printing Documents
443
Printing to an AirPrint Printer
When your printers are in place, the iPads can print to them. Here’s an example using the 
Pages app:
	
1.	
Open the document you want to print.
	
2.	
Give the Print command. How you do this varies depending 
on the app, but in Pages you tap the More (…) button, and 
then tap the Print item on the More menu (see Figure 7-48).
	
3.	
After you give the Print command, the Printer Options dialog 
opens (see Figure 7-49).
	
4.	
Look at the Printer button to see if the printer you want to use 
is already selected. If so, go to step 6; if not, tap the Printer 
button to display the Printer dialog (see Figure 7-50).
Figure 7-48.  Give the Print command to start the printing process. In Pages, you tap the 
More (…) button, and then tap Print on the More menu.
Figure 7-49.  In the Printer Options dialog, see if the Printer button shows the printer you 
want to use. If not, tap the Printer button to display the Printer dialog.

5.	
Tap the printer you want to use. The Printer Options dialog 
appears again, now with the printer listed on the Printer 
button (see Figure 7-51). The Options button summarizes the 
options that are selected.
	
6.	
To change the number of copies, tap the + or – button to 
adjust the number.
	
7.	
To change the options, tap the Options button. The Options 
area expands (see Figure 7-52), and you can set the controls as 
needed. For example, for the Brother printer shown here, you 
can set the Double-Sided switch and the Black & White switch 
to On or Off, as needed.

Summary
In this chapter, you’ve learned how to connect your school’s iPads to shared folders on 
Windows Server and on macOS Server. You’ve also learned how to set up macOS Server 
to handle iOS clients and how to configure the Caching service on macOS Server to speed 
up network performance by caching data.
Beyond this, we examined how to connect your school’s iPads to the four leading 
online storage services—iCloud Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, Dropbox, and Google Drive—
and how you access these services on iPads. We also covered connecting your school’s 
iPads to printers and printing documents.
In the next chapter, we’ll go through how to run lessons from an iPad using Apple’s 
Classroom app.

CHAPTER 8
Controlling a Lesson with 
Classroom for iPad
In this chapter, you’ll learn to use Apple’s Classroom app to manage your students’ iPads 
directly from your own iPad. Classroom is a great tool for running iPad-based lessons, 
giving you the power to do everything from launching the app the students will use for the 
class to monitoring what each student is viewing—or doing—on screen at any moment.
Classroom includes capabilities such as launching the app or navigating the whole 
class—or selected parts of it—to the web page or book page students will start work on, 
muting or locking iPads, and displaying an iPad’s screen on the monitor connected to an 
Apple TV.
Understanding What Classroom Is and What It 
Does
Classroom is an iPad app that you and your fellow teachers or administrators use to 
organize and control students’ iPads in the classroom and to guide the students’ learning.
Classroom enables you to perform a wide range of actions, of which the following are 
typically the most useful:
• 
Managing classes that have already been set up in your school’s 
MDM solution or in macOS Server
■
■Note   Just a quick reminder—here, the class is the group of students meeting to study 
a subject, not the room in which they meet.
• 
Setting up classes manually
• 
Creating and managing groups of students during a class
• 
Launching the apps you want the students to use

Chapter 8 ■ Controlling a Lesson with Classroom for iPad
448
• 
Making students’ iPads display the website, the page in an iBooks 
book, or the iTunes U course that you want the students to view
• 
Monitoring the screen of a student’s iPad to see what’s happening
• 
Locking an iPad’s screen
• 
Locking an iPad itself to prevent a student from taking further 
actions on it
• 
Displaying an iPad’s screen on a TV or monitor connected to an 
Apple TV
Getting Started with Classroom
Only your instructor iPads—the iPads the teachers will use—need the Classroom app. If 
you haven’t installed Classroom already, go ahead and install it by using either the App 
Store app on the iPad itself or your mobile device management (MDM) solution.
Meeting the Welcome to Classroom Splash Screen
When you launch Classroom, the Welcome to Classroom splash screen appears (see 
Figure 8-1), announcing these four key areas of functionality:
• 
Screen View: Classroom lets you view the screen of any iPad in the 
class.
• 
The Big Screen: Classroom enables you to project a student’s work 
onto a monitor or TV connected to an Apple TV.
• 
Remote Control: You can launch apps, websites, or books on 
each student’s iPad, or on the iPads used by a particular group of 
students.
• 
Peace and Quiet: You can mute any iPad in the class.

Tap the Continue button to dismiss the splash screen and get to work.
Setting Your Teacher Information
When you first launch Classroom, the My Classes screen appears automatically, and the 
Teacher Information dialog opens so that you can enter your details (see Figure 8-2). Type 
your name, and then tap the photo placeholder and add a photo by either tapping the 
Take Photo button and taking a photo or tapping the Choose Photo button and selecting 
an existing photo from your photo library. Tap the Done button after filling in your 
information.
Figure 8-1.  Tap the Continue button on the Welcome to Classroom splash screen to start 
working with Classroom

Chapter 8 ■ Controlling a Lesson with Classroom for iPad

Meeting the My Classes Screen
After setting your teacher information, the My Classes screen appears (see Figure 8-3). 
If you’re using an MDM solution, the My Classes screen shows a button for each class 
assigned to you in the MDM solution. (MDM here includes macOS Server systems.) This 
screen contains only two other controls:
• 
Account icon: This is the icon in the upper-left corner of the screen 
that bears your photo, the picture assigned to your account, or 
a placeholder graphic showing a head outline. You can tap the 
Account icon to display the Teacher Information dialog. Here, 
you can change your name by tapping the field and typing the 
changes. You can change the picture by tapping the thumbnail 
and then tapping Take Photo to take a new photo with the camera 
or tapping Choose Photo and selecting an existing photo. If you 
simply want to get rid of the photo, tap the thumbnail and then 
tap Delete Photo.
• 
Edit button: Tap this button to switch the My Classes screen to 
Edit mode, in which you can rearrange the class buttons. Drag a 
button to where you want it to appear, and then drop it there—
just like rearranging icons on the Home screen in iOS. Tap the 
Done button (which replaces the Edit button) when you finish.
Figure 8-2.  The first time you run Classroom on your iPad, the Teacher Information dialog 
opens for you to enter your name. You can add a photo to help students identify you

Chapter 8 ■ Controlling a Lesson with Classroom for iPad

If your school isn’t using MDM, you’ll see only classes that you’ve created 
manually—in other words, none yet—and a Create New Class button to encourage you to 
get started. Figure 8-4 shows an example of this screen.
Figure 8-3.  At first, the My Classes screen shows all the classes for which you are assigned 
as instructor in your MDM solution
Figure 8-4.  If the Create New ClassClassroom: button and the + button in the upper-right 
corner appear on the My Classes screen, your school’s system is set up for you to create your 
own classes as needed
Setting Up Your Classes in a Non-MDM System
If your school isn’t using MDM to control the iPads, you can create new classes from 
within Classroom—and delete classes if necessary.
Creating a New Class
Follow these steps to create a new class:
	
1.	
On the My Classes screen, tap the Create New Class button or 
the + button. The Create Class dialog opens (see Figure 8-5).

■
■Note   You can edit the details for a class by tapping the Info (i) button that appears next 
to the class on the My Classes screen.
Adding Students to a Class
After creating a new class, you can add students to it. You add students by opening the 
class and then having the students enter an identifying code on their iPads. The students’ 
iPads must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the teacher’s iPad.
Figure 8-5.  Enter the class name in the Create Class dialog. You can assign a color by 
tapping the Color pop-up button and then tapping the color in the Choose a Color pop-up 
panel

In the Allow Teacher To box, the student may be able to control two settings, 
depending on how the iPads are configured:
• 
Lock Apps and Devices: Tap this button to display the Lock Apps 
and Devices screen, and then choose the appropriate setting 
to control whether the teacher can lock apps on the iPad and 
the iPad itself. The choices are Always, Ask (ask the student for 
permission), and Never.
• 
AirPlay and View Screen: Tap this button to display the AirPlay 
and View Screen screen, and then choose the appropriate setting 
to control whether the teacher can use AirPlay to display the 
iPad’s screen on a TV or monitor connected to an Apple TV and 
whether the teacher can view the iPad’s screen. Here, too, the 
choices are Always, Ask, and Never.
Running a Class with Classroom
In this section, we’ll go through how to run a class with Classroom, from opening the 
class at the start of the lesson to ending the class session. Along the way, we’ll examine 
how to work with existing groups and groups you create on the fly, how to get your 
students to the right starting point for a lesson, and the tools Classroom offers to help you 
keep the students and their iPads under control.
Figure 8-11.  After the student joins the class, the class appears in the Classes list on the 
Classroom screen

PREPARING TO GIVE A CLASS WITH SHARED IPAD
To prepare for a class with Shared iPad (rather than a one-to-one deployment), take 
the following steps to get your iPads ready for your students to use:
1.	
Launch the Classroom app if it’s not already running.
2.	
Tap the My Classes button in the upper-left corner of the screen 
to display your classes.
3.	
Tap the appropriate class to open it.
4.	
Choose the students you want to assign to the class by tapping 
the All button, tapping a group button, or tapping the Select 
button and then tapping each individual student you want to 
include.
5.	
Tap the Assign button on the Action bar.
6.	
Tap the iPad group you want to use. Classroom assigns an iPad 
to each student.
■
■Note  When you assign a student group to an iPad group with Shared iPad enabled and 
the students using Managed Apple IDs, Classroom checks to see if any of the iPads in the 
iPad group have been assigned to the students in the student group before. If so, wherever 
possible, Classroom assigns a student to an iPad he or she has used before in order to 
reduce the amount of files the iPad needs to download before the student can use it.
Starting a Class
To start a class, tap the button for the class on the My Classes screen. The screen for the 
class appears, such as the Geography 1 screen shown in Figure 8-12. As you can see, the 
screen contains the following features:
• 
End Class button: Tap this button in the upper-left corner of the 
screen when you’re ready to end the class.
• 
Select button: Tap this button in the upper-right corner of the 
screen to select students whom you want to group or take other 
actions on. (We’ll get to groups and the actions you can take a 
little later in this chapter.)
• 
Add button: In non-MDM classes, this button appears to the left 
of the Open button on the toolbar. You can tap it to start adding 
students to the class.

Chapter 8 ■ Controlling a Lesson with Classroom for iPad

• 
Open button: Tap this button to open a dialog that enables you to 
launch an app on the students’ iPads, locking it if necessary.
• 
Navigate: Tap this button to display the Navigate dialog, which 
enables you to steer students to a page in an iBooks book or to a 
web page in Safari.
• 
Lock button/Unlock button: Tap the Lock button to lock students’ 
iPads; tap the Unlock button (which replaces the Lock button) to 
unlock them again.
• 
Mute: Tap this button to mute the audio output on students’ iPads.
• 
Screens: Tap this button to view the screens of students’ iPads.
• 
Group: Tap this button to start creating a new group of iPads.
• 
All group button: Tap this group button at the left end of the group 
bar to see the list of all the students in the class. For each student 
whose iPad is online, Classroom displays a label indicating the 
app or screen the iPad is showing, such as “Home Screen” if 
the iPad is at the Home screen or “Settings” if the Settings app 
is displayed. For each student whose iPad is offline, Classroom 
displays the label “Offline.”
• 
Buttons for other groups: The group bar also displays a button for 
each other group; you can tap the button to display the students 
in the group. We’ll get to the different types of groups in just a 
moment.
Figure 8-12.  On the screen for a class, you can see which students are online and which are 
offline. You can also see which app or screen each online student is viewing

Chapter 8 ■ Controlling a Lesson with Classroom for iPad
460
We’ll look at how to use all these features in the remainder of this chapter. Before 
that, we’ll look at Classroom’s groups and how you choose the students you want to affect 
by an action you’re taking.
Understanding and Using Groups
For much of your work with Classroom, you’ll use groups. Classroom automatically 
creates a group that contains all the students assigned to a class, but it also creates groups 
based on the apps or screens the students are viewing. Better yet, Classroom enables you 
to create custom groups as needed.
Understanding Classroom’s Three Types of Groups
Classroom supports three types of groups:
• 
All: This group contains all the students in the class.
■
■Note  In a class organized via MDM, the All group contains all the students assigned to 
the class in the system, whether their iPads are online or not. In a class you set up on your 
iPad, the All group contains all the students who have joined the class by typing the class’s 
ID code on their iPads.
• 
Manual group: A manual group contains only those students you 
add to the group. You can create as many manual groups as you 
need, and you can remove them when you no longer need them. 
For example, if you have teams of students working on different 
projects, you might create a separate manual group for each 
project.
• 
Dynamic group: A dynamic group is a group that Classroom 
creates automatically to help you manage the iPads. Classroom 
creates a group for students who are on the Home screen and a 
group for each app the students are using. For example, if some 
of your students are using the iBooks app, Classroom creates a 
dynamic group called iBooks that enables you to work with only 
those students who are using the app.

Chapter 8 ■ Controlling a Lesson with Classroom for iPad
461
Creating a Manual Group of Students
Sometimes, you may need to create a small group of students during a class so that you 
can temporarily manage their iPads separately from the rest of the class. For example, if 
you assign a handful of students to work on a group project, you may want to be able to 
treat those students as a separate group from the rest of the class.
To create a manual group, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Tap the Select button in the upper-right corner of the screen 
to switch to Selection Mode. The Select Students prompt 
appears at the top of the screen (see Figure 8-13).
Figure 8-14.  Tap each student you want to add to the group
Figure 8-13.  When you switch Classroom to Selection Mode, the Select Students prompt 
appears at the top of the screen
	
2.	
Tap each student you want to add to the group. A blue check 
circle appears on each student you tap (see Figure 8-14).

Chapter 8 ■ Controlling a Lesson with Classroom for iPad
462
	
3.	
Tap the Group (+) icon in the Actions list. Classroom adds 
a new group icon to the Group bar, selects its default name 
(Group), and displays the keyboard (see Figure 8-15).
Figure 8-15.  Type the name for the new group, and then tap the Done button
	
4.	
Type the name for the group.
	
5.	
Tap the Done button in the upper-right corner of the screen to 
finish creating the group.
Classroom continues to display the members of the new group.
Changing the Members of a Manual Group
Once you’ve created a manual group, you can change its members easily like this:
	
1.	
Tap the group to select it.
	
2.	
Tap the Edit Group button to open the group for editing.
	
3.	
Add students by tapping their buttons, placing a check circle 
on them.

Chapter 8 ■ Controlling a Lesson with Classroom for iPad
463
	
4.	
Remove students by tapping their buttons, removing the 
check circle from them.
	
5.	
Tap the Done button in the upper-right corner of the screen 
when you finish editing the group.
Removing a Manual Group of Students
When you no longer need a manual group, remove it by tapping and holding the group 
name, and then tapping the Remove button on the pop-up panel (see Figure 8-16).
Figure 8-16.  To remove a manual group of students, tap and hold the group name, and 
then tap the Remove button
Choosing Which Students to Affect
You can take most of the actions in Classroom either for the entire class, for a group of 
students, for an individual student, or for multiple students. You select the group or the 
student before giving the command.
Here’s how to choose whom an action affects:
• 
Entire class: Tap the All button, and then tap the button for 
the action. For example, if you want to open an app for all the 
students, tap the Open button.
• 
Dynamic group or manual group: Tap the button for the group, 
and then tap the button for the action. For example, to mute 
all the iPads that are running GarageBand, tap the GarageBand 
group button, and then tap the Mute button.
• 
Individual student: Tap the button for the student in the All group 
or in another group in which the student appears.

Chapter 8 ■ Controlling a Lesson with Classroom for iPad
464
• 
Multiple students: Tap the Select button in the upper-right corner 
of the screen, and then tap each student, placing a check circle on 
each. You can do this in the All group or any other group.
Opening an App on Your Students’ iPads
Often, the quickest way to get the students started on a task is to open the app needed 
for the task on the students’ iPads. By opening the app centrally from your iPad, you can 
ensure that the students start in the right place with a minimum of messing about.
You can open the same app for each student in the class, for an existing group of 
students, or for students in a new group that you create manually. When opening the app, 
you can lock it in place if necessary, or let the students switch to other apps as needed.
■
■Note   As you’d imagine, the app must be installed on each iPad for you to be able to 
open it.
To open an app on your students’ iPads, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Choose which students you want to affect.
	
2.	
Tap the Open button in the Actions group to display the Open 
dialog (see Figure 8-17).
Figure 8-17.  In the Open dialog, tap the app you want to open for the students. Set the 
“Lock in app after opening” switch to On if you want to lock the students in the app

Chapter 8 ■ Controlling a Lesson with Classroom for iPad
465
	
3.	
Tap the app you want to open. The Open dialog shows the 
result of the action, such as “Opened Notes on 2 iPads” (see 
Figure 8-18).
Figure 8-18.  The Open dialog shows the result of the action and a button for opening the 
app on your teacher iPad
■
■Note  If some of the students’ iPads don’t contain the app you try to open, you’ll see a 
message such as “Failed to open Keynote on 2 iPads” and a list of the iPads (identified by 
student name) with details of the problem, such as “Keynote not installed.”
	
4.	
Tap the Open App on this iPad button if you want to open the 
same app on your iPad. Otherwise, tap the Done button to 
dismiss the Open dialog.
If you’ve just opened an app for only some students in the class, repeat the process 
for each other group that needs a different app launched.
Locking an App to Prevent Students from Changing It
When launching an app on students’ iPads, you can choose to lock the app in position 
after opening it. Locking the app in position prevents the students from closing the app or 
from switching to another app.

Chapter 8 ■ Controlling a Lesson with Classroom for iPad
466
To lock the app, set the “Lock in app after opening” switch in the Open dialog to On. 
When you dismiss the Open dialog, a padlock icon appears next to the app’s name under 
the student’s name (see Figure 8-19).
Figure 8-19.  When you lock students into an app, the padlock icon appears by the app 
icon under the student’s name. Tap the Unlock button to set the students free again
■
■Caution   Before locking students into an app, warn them about the locking. Otherwise, 
students may think that the Home buttons on their iPads have stopped working, because 
there’s no visual indication of the locking. Similarly, tell students when you’ve unlocked 
them from an app—otherwise, they won’t know unless they press the Home button or use 
app-navigation gestures.
When you are ready to give the students freedom of movement again, unlock the 
app:
• 
Unlock the app for all students: Tap the Unlock button on the 
Action bar. The Unlock dialog opens, confirming the unlocking 
(see Figure 8-20); tap the Done button to close it.

Chapter 8 ■ Controlling a Lesson with Classroom for iPad
467
• 
Unlock the app for a group: To unlock the app for a group, tap the 
group’s button, and then tap the Unlock button. Again, the Unlock 
dialog opens to confirm the action.
• 
Unlock the app for multiple students: To unlock the app for 
multiple students, tap the Select button, and then tap each 
student you want to affect. With the students selected, tap the 
Unlock button. Again, the Unlock dialog opens.
• 
Unlock the app for a single student: To unlock the app for a single 
student, tap that student’s button. In the Actions dialog that opens 
(see Figure 8-21), tap the Unlock button.
Figure 8-20.  The Unlock dialog confirms the unlocking action and shows the number of 
iPads that Classroom has unlocked

Navigating to a Web Bookmark, iBook, or PDF
Classroom enables you to navigate students to a bookmarked web page in Safari, to a 
particular page in an e-book, or to a PDF file in the iBooks app.
To navigate students, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Choose which students you want to affect.
	
2.	
Tap the Navigate button on the Action bar to display the 
Navigate dialog box (see Figure 8-22).
Figure 8-21.  Tap the Unlock button in the Actions dialog to unlock the app for a single

Tap the Safari button to navigate to a web page for which you 
have created a bookmark on your iPad, or tap the iBooks button 
to navigate to an e-book or a PDF file. This example uses Safari.
	
4.	
In the dialog that opens, navigate to the bookmark or file, and 
then tap it. Figure 8-23 shows an example using a bookmark. 
Classroom opens the web page, e-book, or PDF on the 
students’ iPads, and displays a dialog showing the number of 
iPads navigated (see Figure 8-24).
Figure 8-23.  Tap the bookmark for the web page you want to open in Safari

Tap the Go to button if you want to display the same item on 
your iPad. Otherwise, tap the Done button.
Locking and Unlocking the iPad Screen
When you need to focus your students’ attention on something other than their iPad 
screens, such as unmissable live instruction you’re delivering, you can lock the screens. 
To do so, select the students you want to affect, and then tap the Lock button on the 
Action bar. For a single student, tap the student’s button to display the Actions dialog, and 
then tap the Lock button.
Classroom displays the Lock dialog (see Figure 8-25) to confirm the locking action. 
Tap the Done button to dismiss it.
Figure 8-25.  Tap the Done button to dismiss the Lock dialog, which confirms the number 
of iPads that Classroom has locked
When you lock the screens, each iPad displays a message saying it has been locked 
by you (see Figure 8-26). When you’re ready to unlock the iPads again, select the students 
you want to affect, and then tap the Unlock button. The unlocked iPads show the lock 
screen, which the students can unlock using their usual unlock method, such as entering 
a passcode or using Touch ID.

Apps and Devices setting, and then tap the Always, Ask, or Never button, as appropriate.
If the student has chosen the Ask setting, the Teacher Wants to View Your Screen 
dialog (see Figure 8-31) opens when you (the teacher) give the View Screen command. 
The student can tap the Allow button to allow this instance, the Always Allow button to 
select the Always item on the AirPlay and View screen, or the Deny button to select the 
Never item on the AirPlay and View screen.
Figure 8-31.  The Teacher Wants to View Your Screen dialog lets the student control 
whether you (the teacher) can view the iPad’s screen
Displaying an iPad’s Screen via Apple TV
Classroom enables you to display an iPad’s screen on a TV or monitor connected to an 
Apple TV. For example, you might need to display an iPad’s screen on a monitor to share a 
student’s document or presentation with the whole class.
■
■Note   Depending on how your school’s iPads are configured, AirPlay may also be 
controlled by the student’s choice of setting on the AirPlay and View screen in the Settings 
app.
To allow an iPad to display its screen via Apple TV, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Tap the appropriate student’s iPad. The Actions dialog opens.

Summary
In this chapter, you’ve learned to use the Classroom app to manage an iPad-based lesson. 
You now know what Classroom is and what it does; you’ve installed Classroom on your 
teaching iPad, and you know how to do everything from starting a class, through opening 
apps and managing the students, to ending the class.
In the next chapter, we’ll look at how to troubleshoot iPads in the classroom.

CHAPTER 9
Troubleshooting iPads in  
the Classroom
In this chapter, I’ll show you how to troubleshoot the problems you’re most likely 
to experience with iPads in the classroom. We’ll start by looking at how to locate 
a missing iPad—and how to erase it remotely if necessary. We’ll then move on 
to resetting an iPad in different ways, which can clear up everything from minor 
ailments to lost passwords. After that, we’ll go over troubleshooting apps, network 
connections, Bluetooth issues, display issues, audio problems, and problems 
connecting to AirPort devices and Apple TVs.
As you’ll know from your experience with computers and devices, many different 
things can go wrong with hardware, software, or both. Some problems have quick and 
easy fixes, whereas other problems—even if they initially appear trivial—may require 
involved steps and take plenty of time to troubleshoot.
This chapter assumes that you’ll be troubleshooting iPads deployed in your 
classroom and that your priority is to keep the iPads running and your classroom 
functioning smoothly. This means you likely won’t have time to dig into the specifics of 
each problem the moment it occurs; instead, you’ll want to work around problems as far 
as possible. To this end, the chapter begins by suggesting a troubleshooting approach that 
assumes you have multiple iPads—preferably more than you need at any one point—that 
you can swap in and out as necessary.
Two Moves to Streamline Troubleshooting  
Your iPads
When something goes wrong with a desktop computer in the classroom, you’ll normally 
need to troubleshoot it soon—if not immediately—in order to keep the classroom 
functioning usefully. Unless your iPads are secured with mounts or stands you can’t 
unlock, you’ll likely have more flexibility in troubleshooting. This means you may be 
better off using a restart-and-replace approach to troubleshooting any problem that you 
can’t instantly resolve.

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
478
Restarting as a Troubleshooting Move
As you no doubt well know, you can clear up many problems with end-user electronics—
from smartphones and tablets to laptops and desktops—by restarting them. The speed 
and simplicity of restarting an iPad means that a restart is often a sensible place to start 
troubleshooting any problem that doesn’t have an immediate fix. A restart usually takes 
less than a minute, and any student can perform it—unless you’ve configured the iPads to 
prevent restarts.
You’ll find that many of the sections in this chapter suggest restarting the iPad either 
as a first move in troubleshooting a problem or as a subsequent move if other options fail.
Replacing an iPad as a Troubleshooting Move
If a restart doesn’t clear up a problem that will prevent the iPad from functioning as 
needed in the classroom, your best bet is to replace the iPad with a spare—as long as you 
have a spare.
If possible, plan and maintain your iPad fleet so that you have one or more spare 
devices that you can swap in when an iPad suffers problems or gets broken.
■
■Tip   Replacement as a troubleshooting move works best when your iPads have a 
standard configuration and you keep all your important files on the network rather than on 
the iPads themselves.
Locating and Dealing with Missing iPads
If an iPad goes missing, you can use Find My iPhone to locate it. Find My iPhone is an 
Apple service that enables you to track not just the iPhone but also the iPad, the iPod 
touch, and Macs. The service is called Find My iPhone because Apple debuted the service 
for the iPhone, but on the iPad the feature is called Find My iPad; on the iPod touch, it’s 
called Find My iPod; and on the Mac, it’s called Find My Mac.
Find My iPhone works via the Apple ID associated with the iPad (or other device). 
You must first enable the feature on the iPad. Then, if the iPad goes missing, you can use 
Find My iPhone to determine where it is. You can then play a sound on the iPad, lock the 
iPad and display a message on it, or erase the iPad and display a message on it.
Turning On the Find My iPad Feature on an iPad
To be able to locate an iPad using the Find My iPhone service, you need to enable the 
Find My iPad feature on the iPad. This section shows you how to enable the Find My iPad 
feature by working on the iPad manually. You can also turn on the Find My iPad feature 
by using Apple Configurator (see Chapter 4), Apple School Manager (see Chapter 5), or 
mobile device management (MDM) tools (see Chapter 6).

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
479
To turn on Find My iPad manually, follow these steps:
	
1.	
From the Home screen, choose Settings ➤ Apple ID ➤ iCloud ➤ 
Find My iPad to display the Find My iPad screen (see Figure 9-1).  
Apple ID is the button that shows your Apple ID name.
	
2.	
Set the Find My iPad switch to On.
	
3.	
If you want the iPad to send its current location to the Find 
iPhone service when its battery is critically low, set the Send 
Last Location switch to On. Enabling this feature is normally 
a good idea, because it may help you track down a misplaced 
iPad whose battery has run out.
Locating a Missing iPad
To locate a missing iPad, you use another computer, tablet, or phone. How you use the 
Find My iPhone service depends on the type of computer or device you’re using:
• 
iOS device: If you’re using another iOS device (an iPhone, iPad, or 
iPod touch) to locate the missing iPad, use the Find iPhone app 
on that device. This app is normally included in an installation of 
iOS; look for it in the Extras folder or simply search for it. The app 
presents a similar interface to that of the Find My iPhone feature 
on the iCloud website. If iOS prompts you to allow the Find 
iPhone app to access your location while you use the app (see 
Figure 9-2), tap the Allow button to enable the app to work fully.
Figure 9-1.  On the Find My iPad screen, set the Find My iPad switch to On to activate the 
Find My iPad feature. You may also want to set the Send Last Location switch to On to 
make sure you can track down the iPad even if its battery runs flat

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
480
• 
Mac, PC, or other computer or device: If you’re using a computer or 
any device other than an iOS device, use the Find iPhone app on the 
iCloud website. Point your web browser at www.icloud.com, sign in 
using your Apple ID and password, and then click the Find iPhone 
icon on the main iCloud screen. (If the iCloud website displays an 
app rather than the main screen, click the app’s name in the upper-
left corner of the screen to display the Apps panel, and then click the 
Find iPhone icon.)
■
■Note   If the Update Your Apple ID dialog opens when you sign in to the iCloud website, 
follow the prompts to update your Apple ID by choosing new security questions. These security 
questions—such as “Where did you go the first time you flew on a plane?”—used to be 
optional, but Apple has made them compulsory to help keep users’ sensitive data secure.
Figure 9-3 shows the Find iPhone app running on an iPad, and Figure 9-4 shows the 
Find iPhone app on the iCloud website. As you can see, the iOS app and the website app 
have similar interfaces, and they work in much the same way. On iOS, the Find iPhone 
app displays a sidebar containing the list of available devices, whereas on the iCloud 
website, the app provides a pop-up panel for selecting the device you want to track. 
Click the All Devices button or the current device’s button in the middle of the toolbar to 
display the pop-up panel, and then tap the appropriate device.
Figure 9-2.  If the Find iPhane app prompts you to allow the iOS device you’re using to 
track down a missing iPad to access your location, tap the Allow button

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
481
■
■Note   You may see duplicate devices in the Find My iPhone list—the service seems 
to err on the side of caution when it has stored what may be multiple records for the same 
device or multiple devices with similar names. Usually, any spurious devices will be marked 
as being offline, so you can ignore them easily enough.
Figure 9-3.  The Find iPhone app runs on the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch and enables 
you to locate iOS devices, Macs, and Apple Watches registered to the Apple ID you log in 
with

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
482
Choosing the Map Type and Zooming as Needed
In either the iOS app or the iCloud app, you can choose the map type you want to view. 
If you’ve used Apple’s Maps app on an iOS device or on a Mac, you’ll already be familiar 
with the three map types:
• 
Standard map: This map shows the road layout, with labels on 
places and landmarks.
• 
Satellite map: This map shows a satellite photo of the area without 
labels on places and landmarks. The satellite photo may be 
several years old, but it may still help you identify a location.
• 
Hybrid map: This map shows the satellite photo with labels on 
places and landmarks. The hybrid map is usually more useful 
than the satellite map for tracking lost devices.
Figure 9-4.  The Find My iPhone app on the iCloud website uses a pop-up panel for 
selecting the device you want to track. Tap the All Devices button or the button bearing the 
name of the current device to open the panel, and then tap the appropriate device

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
483
Here’s how to choose which map type the app displays:
• 
iOS app: Tap the Information (i) button in the lower-right corner 
to display the Information dialog, and then tap the Standard, 
Hybrid, or Satellite button.
• 
iCloud app: Click the pop-up menu button in the lower-right 
corner of the screen, and then click the Standard, Hybrid, or 
Satellite item. The pop-up menu button shows the name of the 
current map type.
You can also zoom the map in and out as needed:
• 
iOS app: Place two fingers (or finger and thumb) on the screen 
and pinch out to zoom in, or pinch in to zoom out.
• 
iCloud app: Click the + button in the upper-left corner of the 
screen to zoom in; click the – button to zoom out.
Selecting the Missing iPad
Once you’ve gotten the map type and zoom to your satisfaction, select the missing iPad by 
tapping it in the sidebar in the iOS app or by tapping the All Devices pop-up menu button 
(or the button showing the name of the current device) and then tapping the iPad on the 
pop-up panel.
■
■Note   After selecting the device on the iOS app, you can tap the Full Screen button (the 
one with two diagonal arrows pointing apart) to expand the map area to full screen, hiding 
the sidebar. Tap the Back button (the < button in the upper-left corner of the screen) when 
you want to display the sidebar again.
Once Find My iPhone has located the iPad, you can display the controls for taking 
actions with it:
• 
iOS app: Tap the device’s icon, making the app show a circle 
around it. Then tap the Actions button at the bottom of the screen 
to display the bar of actions (see Figure 9-5).

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
484
• 
iCloud app: Click the iPad’s icon to select it, and then click the 
Information (i) icon to display the dialog shown in Figure 9-6.
Figure 9-6.  On iCloud, click the icon for the found iPad to display the dialog of actions you 
can take. The battery indicator in the upper-right corner of the dialog shows the state of the 
iPad’s battery
Figure 9-5.  In the iOS app, tap the iPad and then tap the Actions button to display the bar 
of actions at the bottom of the screen

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
485
■
■Note   The Find My iPhone service displays an Old Location flag in the dialog of actions 
if the location the service has for the iPad is an old location rather than a current one. In 
this case, you can check the “Notify me when found” check box to have the Find My iPhone 
service notify you via a pop-up message when it locates the iPad. The Old Location flag also 
appears when the iPad is out of power or has been powered off.
Playing a Sound on the Missing iPad
The Find My iPhone service enables you to play a sound on the missing device. If you see 
from the Find My iPhone information that the missing iPad is somewhere nearby, you 
may want to play a sound to help you locate the iPad. If the Find My iPhone information 
shows the Old Location flag, the iPad likely isn’t able to play a sound.
To play a sound, tap the Play Sound button on the bar of actions in the iOS app or 
in the dialog of actions on iCloud. The sound is an echoing beep at full volume, and 
continues for a minute; if you locate the iPad, you can stop the sound by swiping its alert 
and then tapping the Clear button (if the iPad is locked) or by tapping the OK button in 
the Find My iPad Alert dialog box (see Figure 9-7) if the iPad isn’t locked.
Locking the Missing iPad and Displaying a Message on It
After finding out approximately where a missing iPad is, you may need to make sure it’s 
locked. You can do this by enabling the Lost Mode feature of Find My iPhone. Lost Mode 
also enables you to display a message on the missing iPad. Displaying a message is useful 
for letting somebody who finds it know how to arrange the return of the iPad to you. In a 
pinch, you can also use this feature as a way to identify an iPad among many others in a 
classroom.
The Lost Mode feature works slightly differently on iOS and on iCloud. The following 
subsections cover iOS and iCloud separately.
Figure 9-7.  Tap the OK button in the Find My iPad Alert dialog to stop the sound playing 
once you locate the iPad

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
486
Using Lost Mode on iOS
On iOS, follow these steps to use Lost Mode to lock an iPad and display a message on it:
	
1.	
Tap the Lost Mode button on the bar of actions. The iPad 
dialog opens (see Figure 9-8).
	
2.	
Tap the Turn On Lost Mode button. The Step 1 of 3 dialog 
opens (see Figure 9-9), prompting you to enter a passcode to 
lock the iPad.
Figure 9-9.  In the Step 1 of 3 dialog, type the passcode with which you want to lock the 
iPad
Figure 9-8.  Tap the Turn On Lost Mode button in the iPad dialog to start the process of 
locking a missing iPad and displaying a message on it

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
487
	
3.	
Type a six-digit passcode. The Step 1 of 3 dialog then prompts 
you to type the passcode again for confirmation.
■
■Note   The passcode for locking the iPad must be numbers rather than symbols  
or letters, even though the iPad enables you to display the letters keyboard while the  
Step 1 of 3 dialog is open.
	
4.	
Type the passcode again. The Step 2 of 3 dialog then opens 
(see Figure 9-10), prompting you to enter a contact phone 
number.
	
5.	
Type the phone number at which you can be contacted by 
someone who finds the iPad.
	
6.	
Tap the Next button. The Step 3 of 3 dialog opens (see 
Figure 9-11), suggesting a boilerplate message to someone 
who finds the iPad.
Figure 9-10.  In the Step 2 of 3 dialog, type your contact phone number for the return of the 
iPad, and then tap the Next button
Figure 9-11.  In the Step 3 of 3 dialog, customize the boilerplate messages as needed, and 
then tap the Done button

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
488
	
7.	
Customize the message as needed. For example, you might 
add your name and the school’s name, or a suggestion of how 
to return the iPad to you.
	
8.	
Tap the Done button. The Find My iPhone service locks the 
iPad and displays the message and phone number (if any) on 
it. Figure 9-12 shows an example.
■
■Note   When you recover an iPad on which you’ve activated Lost Mode, you can unlock 
it using your fingerprint (within 24 hours of the last use) or passcode as usual.
Using Lost Mode on iCloud
On iCloud, follow these steps to use Lost Mode to lock an iPad and display a message 
on it:
	
1.	
Tap the iPad’s location to display the dialog of actions.
	
2.	
Tap the Lost Mode button in the dialog of actions for the 
iPad. The first Lost Mode dialog opens (see the left screen in 
Figure 9-13).
Figure 9-12.  In Lost Mode, the Lost iPad message appears on the iPad’s screen, together 
with any text and any phone number you entered

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
489
	
3.	
Type a six-digit passcode to lock the iPad. The first Lost Mode 
dialog then prompts you to re-enter the passcode.
	
4.	
Type the passcode again. The second Lost Mode dialog then 
opens (see the center screen in Figure 9-13).
	
5.	
Optionally, type your contact phone number. Normally, 
entering the phone number is a good idea unless you’re 
certain it’s not needed—for example, because you can see 
that the iPad is in the school buildings and you’ll specify the 
physical location where it should be returned.
	
6.	
Click the Next button. The third Lost Mode dialog opens  
(see the right screen in Figure 9-13).
	
7.	
Optionally, type a message to the person who finds the iPad. 
Again, you’ll normally want to do this.
	
8.	
Click the Done button. The Find My iPhone service locks the 
iPad and displays the message and phone number (if any) 
on it.
Figure 9-13.  In the first Lost Mode dialog (left), type a locking passcode and then confirm 
it. In the second Lost Mode dialog (center), type your contact phone number and click the 
Next button. In the third Lost Mode dialog (right), type a message and then click the Done 
button

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom

Erasing the Missing iPad
The Find My iPhone service also enables you to erase a missing iPad. Under normal 
circumstances, you’d want to erase a missing iPad only if you’ve pretty much given it 
up for lost—for example, if you’ve activated Lost Mode and displayed a message on the 
iPad, but you’ve received no response. The erasure prevents you from tracking the iPad 
any further with the Find My iPhone service, but it still enables you to display a message 
and phone number on the iPad’s screen after it’s erased, so the possibility remains that 
someone might find the iPad and return it to you.
■
■Tip   You can also use the Find My iPhone service to erase an iPad that you haven’t 
lost but whose passcode has been forgotten. See the next section, “Dealing with Forgotten 
Passcodes,” for details.
■
■Note   The main reason for erasing a missing iPad is to prevent anybody who finds it 
from gaining access to sensitive information it contains. If the missing iPad is one of your 
classroom devices and you’ve followed the advice in this book to keep all valuable data on 
the network rather than on the iPads, the iPad may contain little sensitive information in 
the normal sense. But it’s still likely to contain information that might help a malefactor to 
connect to your school’s network or attack it in other ways, so you will usually want to erase 
the iPad if it seems unlikely that you will be able to recover it.
The Erase iPad feature works slightly differently on iOS and on iCloud. The following 
subsections cover iOS and iCloud separately.
■
■Note   If the Find My iPhone service doesn’t have the iPad’s current location, it sets up 
the erase operation to run the next time the iPad connects to the Internet.
Erasing a Missing iPad on iOS
To erase a missing iPad using the Find iPhone app on iOS, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Tap the Erase iPad button. The iPad dialog opens (see 
Figure 9-14), warning you that the iPad’s contents and settings 
will be erased and that you won’t be able to locate or track it.

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
491
	
2.	
Tap the Erase iPad button. The Apple ID Password dialog 
opens.
	
3.	
Type the password for the Apple ID you’re using to track the 
iPad.
	
4.	
Tap the Erase button. The Find My iPhone service instructs 
the iPad to erase its contents.
HOW DOES AN IPAD ERASE ITS CONTENTS?
Like other iOS devices, the iPad stores its data in an encrypted format that requires 
an encryption key to decipher. When you give the command to erase its contents, 
the iPad deletes its encryption key, rendering the data unreadable.
Deleting the encryption key takes only a moment. By contrast, “old-school” methods 
of erasing data involved writing zeroes over all the blocks in the storage. This could 
take several hours, depending on the device’s capacity, and if the process were 
interrupted (either by a human or by power loss, such as the battery running flat), 
some data might remain readable.
Figure 9-14.  This iPad dialog warns you that you can’t locate or track an erased iPad. Tap 
the Erase iPad button if you’re sure you want to proceed

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
492
Erasing a Missing iPad on iCloud
To erase a missing iPad using the Find iPhone app on iCloud, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Click the Erase iPad button in the dialog of actions. The Erase 
this iPad? dialog opens (see Figure 9-15).
	
2.	
Click the Erase button. The first Erase iPad dialog opens, 
prompting you for your Apple ID password.
	
3.	
Type your password.
	
4.	
Click the Next button. The second Erase iPad dialog opens 
(see the left screen in Figure 9-16).
Figure 9-16.  When erasing an iPad via iCloud, you can enter a phone number in the 
second Erase iPad dialog (left) and a message in the third Erase iPad dialog (right)
Figure 9-15.  On iCloud, the Erase this iPad dialog warns you that an erased iPad can’t be 
located or tracked. Click the Erase button if you’re determined to erase the device

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
493
	
5.	
Optionally, type the contact phone number to display on the 
iPad after it has been erased.
	
6.	
Click the Next button. The third Erase iPad dialog opens (see 
the right screen in Figure 9-16).
	
7.	
Optionally, type a message encouraging the person who finds 
the iPad to contact you.
	
8.	
Click the Done button. The Find My iPhone service instructs 
the iPad to erase its contents. The Erased readout appears in 
the dialog of actions (see Figure 9-17), as does the Remove 
from Account button, which you can click to remove the iPad’s 
association to your Apple account.
■
■Note   Erasing an iPad triggers Apple’s Activation Lock feature, which locks an iOS 
device to a particular Apple ID to prevent an unauthorized person from setting up the device. 
See the section “Erasing and Restoring an iPad via iCloud,” later in this chapter, for coverage 
of setting up an iPad on which Activation Lock has been triggered.
Dealing with Forgotten Passcodes
As you know, iOS uses a passcode as a last line of defense for devices even if you enable 
Touch ID. So if you forget the passcode for an iPad—or if one of your students or your 
colleagues forgets the passcode—you have to do some work to get the iPad operational 
again.
Figure 9-17.  The Erased readout appears in the dialog of actions, confirming that the Find 
My iPhone service has instructed the iPad to erase its contents. You can click the Remove 
from Account button if you want to remove the iPad from your Apple account

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
494
To get the iPad working again, you need to erase it. If the iPad has been backed up to 
iTunes, or if it’s been backed up to iCloud and you’ve enabled the Find My iPad feature 
in iCloud, you should be able to restore data to the iPad after erasing it. If the iPad hasn’t 
been backed up, you won’t be able to restore the data.
Erasing and Restoring an iPad via iTunes
If the iPad with the forgotten passcode is one that you’ve backed up to iTunes, you can 
use iTunes to restore the iPad. This is the best way of getting the iPad fully operational 
again, so use it if you have the option. One limitation is that you must be able to turn off 
the Find My iPad feature on the iPad if it’s enabled. See the sidebar “Turning Off Find My 
iPad on the iPad,” later in this chapter, for instructions on turning off Find My iPad.
Erasing and restoring an iPad via iTunes is straightforward, but it may take a while, 
because iTunes may need to download an operating system image to install on the iPad. 
An operating system image is a file that contains the operating system for reinstallation.
Here’s how to erase and restore an iPad using iTunes:
	
1.	
Connect the iPad to your Mac or PC via USB.
	
2.	
If iTunes doesn’t launch (or become active) when you connect 
the iPad, launch or activate iTunes as usual from the Dock or 
Launchpad (on the Mac) or from the Start menu or taskbar 
(on Windows).
■
■Note  If iTunes prompts you for a passcode for the iPad, it means you’re using a 
different computer than the one with which the iPad was last synced. Connect the iPad to 
the right computer instead. If you can’t identify the right computer, you’ll need to erase the 
iPad using Recovery Mode. See the section “Erasing an iPad Using Recovery Mode,” later in 
this chapter, for details.
	
3.	
If iTunes automatically starts backing up the iPad after you 
connect it, allow the backup to finish. If not, run a backup 
manually by following these steps:
a.	
Click the iPad button on the navigation bar at the top of 
the iTunes window to display the iPad’s control screens.
b.	
In the sidebar, click the Summary icon if it’s not already 
selected. The Summary screen appears (see Figure 9-18).

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
495
c.	
In the Backups box, make sure the This Computer option 
button is selected.
d.	
Select the Encrypt Local Backup check box. The Set 
Password dialog opens (see Figure 9-19).
Figure 9-18.  From the Summary screen for an iPad, you can back up the iPad and restore it
Figure 9-19.  In the Set Password dialog, type a strong password to protect the iPad 
backup. On the Mac, you can select the Remember This Password in My Keychain check 
box to store the password securely in your keychain.

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
496
e.	
Type a strong password—preferably 12 characters or 
more, mixing upper- and lowercase letters with numbers 
and symbols—in the Password box and the Verify 
Password box.
f.	
On the Mac, select the Remember This Password in My 
Keychain check box if you want to store the password 
securely in your keychain. (The keychain is a password-
management system built into macOS, OS X, and iOS.) 
This is a good move to ensure you can recover from 
forgetting the password.
g.	
Click the Set Password button. The Set Password dialog 
box closes.
h.	
Click the Back Up Now button. iTunes backs up the iPad.
	
4.	
Click the Restore iPad button. A dialog opens, confirming that 
you want to restore the iPad to its factory settings and erase all 
its contents (see Figure 9-20).
TURNING OFF FIND MY IPAD ON THE IPAD
If iTunes displays a dialog saying that Find My iPad must be turned off before the 
iPad can be restored, click the OK button. Unlock the iPad via Touch ID, go to the 
Home screen, and choose Settings ➤ iCloud ➤ Find My iPad to display the Find My 
iPad screen. Set the Find My iPad switch to Off. In the Apple ID Password dialog that 
opens, type your password, and then tap the Turn Off button.
This is easy enough, but it relies on the iPad having Touch ID—and on you (or an 
available colleague or student) having a registered fingerprint. If the iPad doesn’t 
have Touch ID, or if you don’t have access to a registered fingerprint, you’ll need to 
erase the iPad instead. See the section “Erasing an iPad Using Recovery Mode,” later 
in this chapter, for details.
Figure 9-20.  In this dialog, click the Restore button to confirm that you want to restore the 
iPad to factory settings and erase all its contents

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
497
	
5.	
Click the Restore button. iTunes extracts the software from its 
existing archive, restores it to the iPad, and then displays the 
Welcome to Your New iPad screen (see Figure 9-21).
■
■Note  iTunes stores the most recent system image file for each iOS device you sync 
with the computer. On the Mac, iTunes stores the latest system image file for iPad in 
the ~/Library/iTunes/iPad Software Updates folder, where the tilde (~) represents 
your Home folder. On Windows, iTunes stores the file in the \Users\username\AppData\
Roaming\Apple Computer\iTunes folder, where username is your username. When iTunes 
downloads a new file, it deletes the old one without putting it in the Trash (on the Mac) or 
the Recycle Bin (on Windows). So if you want to keep any of the files in order to be able to 
revert to earlier versions of the iPad firmware, copy the file from this location to somewhere 
else. To make sure you don’t forget to copy a system image file, copy the file immediately 
after iTunes downloads it.
Figure 9-21.  On the Welcome to Your New iPad screen, select the Restore from This Backup 
option button and then select the backup in the pop-up menu

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
498
	
6.	
Select the Restore from This Backup option button.
	
7.	
Open the pop-up menu to the right of the Restore from This 
Backup option button, and then click the backup you want to 
use.
	
8.	
Click the Continue button. If the backup is locked with a 
password, the Enter Password dialog box opens.
	
9.	
Type your backup password in the Password box. If you’re 
using a Mac and you stored the backup password in your 
keychain, iTunes enters the password automatically.
	
10.	
Click the OK button. iTunes restores the backup to the iPad. 
The iPad then restarts and displays the Hello screen.
	
11.	
Press the Home button on the iPad. The Update Completed 
screen appears.
	
12.	
Tap the Continue button, and then follow the prompts on the 
Location Services screen, the Touch ID screen, the Create a 
Passcode screen, the Apple ID screen, the Apple Pay screen, 
and other screens you’ll be familiar with from setting up the 
iPad the first time.
Erasing and Restoring an iPad via iCloud
Your second option for dealing with a forgotten passcode is to use iCloud to erase and 
restore the iPad. This works well as long as you’ve backed up the iPad to the iCloud 
account that you’ll use for the restoration.
Follow the steps in the section “Erasing a Missing iPad on iCloud,” earlier in this 
chapter, to erase the iPad’s contents.
Once you’ve done that, follow these steps to restore the iPad from iCloud:
	
1.	
Turn the iPad on. The Hello screen appears, just like when you 
first set up an iOS device.
	
2.	
Follow through the setup routine, choosing the display 
language and connecting to a Wi-Fi network, until you reach 
the Activation Lock screen (see Figure 9-22).

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
499
	
3.	
Type the Apple ID used to set up the iPad.
	
4.	
Type the password for that Apple ID.
	
5.	
Tap the Next button. The iPad contacts the activation server 
system and verifies the information.
	
6.	
Continue with the setup routine, registering a Touch ID 
fingerprint (optional) and setting a passcode (mandatory), 
until you reach the Apps & Data screen (see Figure 9-23).
Figure 9-22.  On the Activation Lock screen, enter the Apple ID and password associated 
with the iPad, and then tap the Next button

Tap the Agree button. The iPad updates your iCloud settings, 
and then displays the Choose Backup screen (see Figure 9-24).
Figure 9-23.  On the Apps & Data screen, tap the Restore from iCloud Backup button

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
501
	
12.	
In the Latest iPad Backups list, tap the backup you want to 
use. Normally, you’ll want to use the latest backup unless you 
know there’s something wrong with it.
■
■Note  If the Latest iPad Backups list doesn’t show the backup you want to use, tap the 
Show All Backups button to force the iPad to list all available backups. You can also use a 
backup from another device, such as one from an iPhone, by tapping the appropriate button 
in the Other Backups list on the Choose Backup screen.
	
13.	
If the backup includes items purchased on a different Apple 
ID than the one you’re using to set up the iPad again, the iPad 
prompts you to enter the Apple ID used for purchases on the

■Tip  If the Apple ID used for store purchases isn’t yours and you don’t have access to 
this information, tap the Skip This Step button to defer the decision for now.
	
14.	
If you’ve enabled two-step verification for the Apple ID, the 
Verify Your Identify screen appears (see Figure 9-25). Tap the 
appropriate trusted device in the Trusted Devices list, and 
then tap the Send button to send the verification code to that 
device. Then type the code on the Verification Code screen on 
the iPad.
	
15.	
Wait while the iPad restores the data from iCloud. The  
Restore from iCloud screen shows you a progress readout  
(see Figure 9-26).

16.	
After the restoration completes and the iPad restarts, enter 
your passcode to unlock the iPad. You’ll then need to follow 
through a short setup routine, much the same as when you 
install an update to iOS.
Erasing an iPad Using Recovery Mode
Your third option for dealing with a forgotten passcode is to use Recovery Mode to erase 
the iPad using Recovery Mode. You can then set it up again from scratch, but you won’t be 
able to restore data to the iPad unless you have a backup for it in it iTunes—in which case 
you would normally follow the procedure explained in the section “Erasing and Restoring 
an iPad via iTunes,” earlier in this chapter.
Here’s how to erase an iPad using Recovery Mode:
	
1.	
Connect the iPad to your Mac or PC via USB.
	
2.	
If iTunes doesn’t launch (or become active) when you connect 
the iPad, launch or activate iTunes as usual from the Dock or 
Launchpad (on the Mac) or from the Start menu or taskbar 
(on Windows).
Figure 9-26.  The Restore from iCloud screen displays a progress readout as the iPad 
restores data from iCloud

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
504
	
3.	
Force restart the iPad by pressing and holding the Home 
button and the Sleep/Wake button (the power button) until 
the Recovery Mode screen appears. This screen shows the 
Apple Support URL for restoring iPads (http://support.
apple.com/ipad/restore) and a Lightning cable reaching 
toward the iTunes logo, indicating that you should connect 
the iPad to iTunes. Figure 9-27 shows the lower part of the 
Recovery Mode screen.
■
■Caution  When force-restarting the iPad, don’t release the Home button and the Sleep/
Wake button when the Apple logo appears on screen. Wait for a few more seconds until the 
Recovery Mode screen appears.
	
4.	
When iTunes notices the iPad in Recovery Mode, it displays 
the There Is a Problem with the iPad That Requires It to 
Be Updated or Restored dialog (see Figure 9-28). Click the 
Restore button. This causes iTunes to start downloading the 
latest operating system image for the iPad.
Figure 9-27.  The Recovery Mode screen indicates that you’ve put the iPad into Recovery 
Mode. This is the lower part of the screen

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
505
■
■Tip  When you click the Restore button in the There Is a Problem with the iPad That 
Requires It to Be Updated or Restored dialog, you may see an alert dialog telling you that 
software for this iPad is not currently available and advising you to make sure you have the 
latest version of iTunes and try again. If this happens, you’ll need to update iTunes to the 
latest version by using Software Update.
An iPad system image is around 2–3 GB in size, so it takes a few minutes to download 
even if your school has a fast Internet connection. iTunes displays a readout saying that 
it’s downloading the iPad software, but it doesn’t give you a useful progress readout, so 
you’ll need to check periodically to see if it’s finished the download.
In the meantime, the iPad stays in Recovery Mode for only 15 minutes and then 
times out. When iTunes finishes downloading the iPad system image, follow these steps:
	
1.	
If you disconnected the iPad from the Mac or PC, connect it 
again.
	
2.	
If iTunes doesn’t launch (or become active) when you connect 
the iPad, launch or activate iTunes as usual from the Dock or 
Launchpad (on the Mac) or from the Start menu or taskbar 
(on Windows).
	
3.	
Put the iPad back into Recovery Mode by pressing and holding 
the Home button and the Sleep/Wake button until the iPad 
displays the Recovery Mode screen again. When iTunes 
recognizes the iPad, it displays an alert dialog to confirm that you 
want to restore the iPad to its factory settings (see Figure 9-29). 
This alert contains either the Restore and Update button or the 
Restore button, depending on whether the system image that 
iTunes has downloaded contains an update or the same version 
of iOS as the iPad is currently running.

If you want to save the details of the changes, click the Save 
button and specify where to save the file.
	
6.	
Click the Next button. The second iPad Software Update 
dialog opens, showing terms and conditions for using the 
software.
	
7.	
If you want to save the terms and conditions, click the Save 
button and specify where to save the file.
	
8.	
Click the Agree button if you want to proceed. iTunes restores 
the software on the iPad. The Activation Lock screen then 
appears (see Figure 9-31), prompting you for the Apple ID and 
password used to set up the iPad.
	
9.	
Type the Apple ID in the Apple ID box.
	
10.	
Type the password in the Password box. If you’ve forgotten 
the password, click the Forgot? link to have a password-reset 
link sent to you via e-mail.
	
11.	
Click the Continue button. The Welcome to Your New iPad 
screen appears (refer to Figure 9-21).

■
■Note  On the Welcome to Your New iPad screen, you can select the Restore from This 
Backup option button and then choose the appropriate backup in the pop-up menu. This 
enables you to restore the iPad using a backup from another device. (In this section, I’m 
assuming that you’re erasing the iPad because you don’t have a backup of it.)
	
13.	
Click the Continue button. iTunes displays the Sync with 
iTunes screen, and you can click the Get Started button to set 
up syncing. Alternatively, you can disconnect the iPad from 
the computer and set it up manually from scratch.
Resetting an iPad to Cure Various Ills
If an iPad isn’t responding normally, or seems to be running slowly, you may be able 
to restore it to health by resetting some or all of its settings. iOS enables you to reset 
everything from the Home screen layout to all the settings. You can also erase all the 
content and settings on the iPad.
To get started, go to the Home screen and choose Settings ➤ General ➤ Reset to 
display the Reset screen, the top part of which appears in Figure 9-32.
Figure 9-32.  From the Reset screen in the Settings app, you can reset various aspects of 
the iPad’s configuration, such as the Home screen layout, the network settings, or the entire 
range of settings

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
509
From the Reset screen, you can perform six different reset operations: Reset 
All Settings, Erase All Content and Settings, Reset Network Settings, Reset Keyboard 
Dictionary, Reset Home Screen Layout, and Reset Location & Privacy. Table 9-1 explains 
what each reset operation does and when you’d use it.
Table 9-1.  Reset Operations on the Reset Screen in the Settings App
Reset Setting
What It Does
When You’d Use It
Reset All  
Settings
Resets all the iPad’s settings to 
their defaults but doesn’t erase 
the iPad’s contents.
To recover from problems that are 
preventing the iPad from running 
normally. In some cases, you’d use 
another Reset command, such as the 
Reset Network Settings command 
or the Reset Location & Privacy 
command, before resorting to this 
command.
Erase All  
Content and 
Settings
Erases all the iPad’s content  
and restores it to factory 
settings.
To prepare the iPad for selling, 
giving to someone else, or otherwise 
disposing of it. Erasing wipes the 
iPad and restores it to factory 
settings, so someone else can set it 
up from scratch.
Reset Network 
Settings
Restores the network settings 
to their default values. The iPad 
forgets the Wi-Fi networks to 
which it has connected, and 
deletes their passwords. It 
deletes any VPN connections 
you have set up. On a cellular 
iPad, this command also deletes 
any custom APN (Access Point 
Names) you’ve set up.
The iPad’s network settings have 
become corrupted, so it can’t 
connect to networks or the Internet 
consistently.
Reset  
Keyboard 
Dictionary
Resets the keyboard dictionary 
to its default settings. The 
effect of this is to delete all the 
custom words you’ve added to 
the dictionary by typing them 
on the keyboard and rejecting 
suggestions.
When you’ve accidentally added 
incorrect or unsuitable words to the 
keyboard dictionary and the Auto-
Correction feature is suggesting them 
as you type text.
Reset Home 
Screen Layout
Resets the Home screen icons  
to their default settings.
After someone has customized the 
Home screen.
Reset Location  
& Privacy
Resets the Location Services 
commands and the Privacy 
commands to their default 
values.
After someone has customized the 
Location Services settings or the 
Privacy settings. This command gives 
you a quick way to restore the default 
settings without having to adjust 
individual settings manually.

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
510
When you give one of these commands, you’ll see one or more dialogs:
• 
Enter Passcode dialog: For any reset operation except Reset Home 
Screen Layout, the Enter Passcode dialog opens so you can 
authenticate yourself by entering your passcode. This check helps 
avoid unauthorized users performing reset operations.
• 
Enter Passcode dialog for Restrictions passcode: If you’ve applied 
restrictions to the iPad, and the reset is a type that will change or 
remove them, iOS next prompts you for the Restrictions passcode. 
This check makes sure users can’t use a reset operation to remove 
restrictions.
• 
Confirmation dialog or dialogs: Once you’ve passed the security 
checks, a Reset dialog (such as the Reset Settings dialog box 
shown in Figure 9-33) opens to confirm the reset operations. Tap 
the Reset button if you want to go ahead. The Reset All Settings 
command and the Erase All Content and Settings command 
then display a second confirmation dialog to make doubly sure, 
because these commands have extensive effects.
Here’s a bit more detail on two of the Reset commands:
• 
Erase All Content and Settings: This is the heaviest-duty of all 
the reset commands. To execute this command, you need to be 
able to enter the passcode. Also, if the Find My iPad feature is 
enabled, you’ll need to enter the iCloud password for the Apple 
ID associated with the iPad. Neither of these requirements is 
surprising, but together they mean that you can’t use the Erase 
All Content and Settings command to recover from a forgotten 
passcode on an iPad even though one of the Touch ID registered 
fingerprints is available.
Figure 9-33.  The iPad displays a Reset dialog, such as this Reset Settings dialog, to confirm 
the reset operation you’ve chosen. Tap the Reset button to proceed

• 
Reset Location & Privacy: This command resets your Location 
Services settings (including the System Services settings) and

Troubleshooting Power Issues
Much of the space inside each iPad is devoted to the battery, which—under good 
conditions—provides enough power for a full day’s use. The problem you’re most likely to 
encounter is that the battery doesn’t provide as much runtime as you need, so we’ll start 
by looking at the settings you can configure to reduce the iPad’s power draw. We’ll then 
move on to the second most common power problem: the iPad failing to charge.
Reducing Power Draw on the Battery
As with most electronic devices, the amount of runtime the battery delivers depends on 
how you’re using the iPad. For example, shooting video and editing video consume far 
more battery power than working in an Office app. But no matter what you’re doing with 
the iPad, you can reduce the power draw by configuring settings the right way.
Reducing Power Draw Quickly from Control Center
When you need to reduce the power draw quickly, open Control Center by swiping up 
from the bottom of the screen. On iOS 10, if the iPad Controls card doesn’t appear at first, 
swipe left or right as needed to display it. You can then make as many of the following 
changes as needed to reduce the iPad’s power consumption:
• 
Brightness: Drag the Brightness slider to the left to turn the 
brightness down.
• 
Airplane Mode: Tap this button if you want to shut down all the 
iPad’s communications.
• 
Wi-Fi: Tap this button to turn Wi-Fi off.
• 
Bluetooth: Tap this button to turn Bluetooth off.
• 
AirDrop: Tap this button to display the AirPlay dialog, and then 
tap the Receiving Off button to turn AirPlay off.
■
■Note   Turning on Airplane Mode saves a decent amount of power, but in most 
classroom situations, you’ll want to keep Wi-Fi turned on so that the iPads can access the 
network and the Internet. Unless you’re using Bluetooth, turn it off and keep it turned off.
Reducing Power Draw from the Settings App
When you want to make more extensive power savings, dig into the settings in the 
Settings app. This section explains the changes you can make and which changes to make 
when. To get started, tap the Settings button on the Home screen.

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
513
• 
Airplane Mode: Set the switch at the top of the left column on the 
Settings screen to On if you need to turn off all communications.
• 
Wi-Fi: If you can dispense with Wi-Fi, tap the Wi-Fi button in the 
left column, and then set the Wi-Fi switch at the top of the Wi-Fi 
screen to Off.
• 
Bluetooth: Unless you need Bluetooth, tap the Bluetooth button in 
the left column, and then set the Bluetooth switch at the top of the 
Bluetooth screen to Off.
• 
Notifications: Notifications take up only a modest amount of 
power, but to minimize distractions, it’s a good idea to tap the 
Notifications button in the left column and then review all the 
apps allowed to raise notifications. Chances are, you can slim 
down the list of allowed apps without causing the iPad’s user to 
miss any important notifications.
• 
Display & Brightness: Tap the Display & Brightness button in the 
left column to show the Display & Brightness screen, and then 
drag the Brightness slider as far left as you can while still leaving 
the screen at a usable brightness. Set the Auto-Brightness switch 
to On if you want the iPad to adjust the brightness to suit the 
ambient brightness that its sensors detect. Tap the Auto-Lock 
button to display the Auto-Lock screen, and then tap the button 
for the appropriate time interval. You’ll want to strike a balance 
between shutting off the screen when the iPad isn’t being used 
and having the screen go off while students are listening to 
instructions or pondering their next move. Your choices are 2 
Minutes, 5 Minutes, 10 Minutes, 15 Minutes, or Never; Never 
is a useful setting for iPads you’re using to display information 
without user interaction, but it’s a killer for battery runtime.
• 
Privacy: The Privacy settings might seem to have no connection 
to battery runtime, but this is where you can disable the Location 
Services feature or simply prune the number of apps and services 
that are allowed to use Location Services. On the Privacy screen, 
tap the Location Services button to display the Location Services 
screen (see Figure 9-34). You can then set the Location Services 
switch to Off if you want to turn off Location Services altogether, 
but since this prevents the Find My iPhone service from working, 
you probably won’t want to do this. Instead, review the list of apps 
that can use Location Services; if an app doesn’t need Location 
Services, tap the app’s button to display the screen for controlling 
the app’s access, and then tap the Never button. You should also 
review the list of system services that are using Location Services: 
tap the System Services button on the Location Services screen to 
display the System Services screen (see Figure 9-35), and then set 
the switch to Off for any service for which the iPad doesn’t need 
Location Services.

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
514
Figure 9-34.  On the Location Services screen, you can set the Location Services switch to 
Off if you want to disable the feature entirely. Otherwise, review the apps in the lower box, 
disabling any that don’t need Location Services, and then tap the System Services button 
and review the list of system services as well

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
515
Figure 9-35.  On the System Services screen, set the switch to Off for any system service that 
you want to prevent from using Location Services

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
516
■
■Tip   On the System Services screen, make sure the Find My iPad switch is set to 
On. You’ll normally want to leave the Setting Time Zone switch and the Wi-Fi Networking 
switch set to On as well. You should be able to safely turn off the Location-Based Apple Ads, 
Location-Based Suggestions, and Share My Location features.
Dealing with the iPad Not Charging
If the iPad doesn’t seem to be charging when it’s plugged in to a power source, start by 
going back to basics:
• 
Check the connection to the iPad: If the Lightning connector isn’t 
fully inserted in the Lightning port, the iPad may not charge. 
When you connect the Lightning cable, listen for the iPad to give 
the bleep of electronic delight as it discovers the power feed.
■
■Note  Many iPad cases make inserting the Lightning connector in the Lightning port 
tricky, especially heavy-duty cases that provide a flap to cover the Lightning port. With some 
cases, it helps to point a light at the area so that you can see the Lightning port clearly.
• 
Use the iPad’s USB power adapter and USB cable: For best 
results, use the power adapter and cable that came with the 
iPad. Different generations and models of iPads have somewhat 
different power requirements, and though they usually play nice 
with the power adapters, you’ll get the fastest and most reliable 
charging from the adapter that matches the iPad model. If you’re 
using a power accessory, such as a multiport charger, make sure 
it’s certified as being compatible with the iPad.
• 
Check the connection to the power adapter: USB cables and ports 
are easy to connect, but the ports can pick up lint or other gunk 
that the cable then rams in. Clean out any dirt or debris that may 
be preventing the connection.
• 
Use a wall power outlet: A wall power outlet typically gives faster 
and more reliable charging than a USB port on a computer.
• 
Make sure the computer is on and is not asleep: When charging 
from a computer, make sure it’s powered on and not asleep.
If the battery won’t charge when the iPad is connected to its own power adapter, 
and that power adapter is plugged into a wall power outlet that you know is working, the 
battery may need replacing. To find out, get the battery checked out by a technician at an 
Apple Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider.

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
517
DEALING WITH THE LOW-BATTERY SCREEN
If the iPad’s battery has been run very nearly flat, you may see a black screen with 
a red battery icon when you plug the iPad into power. When this happens, give the 
iPad half an hour or more to charge to a usable level before trying to power it on. 
After half an hour, the iPad should be displaying the Charging screen, the one that 
shows a battery gradually being filled.
If—after that half-hour—the Charging screen hasn’t appeared, check the Lightning 
port, the USB cable, and the power adapter for dirt or damage. If the charging 
hardware seems okay, force a restart on the iPad by holding down the Sleep/Wake 
button and the Home button simultaneously for around 20 seconds, releasing 
the buttons when the Apple logo appears on the screen. Try another half-hour of 
charging.
If the Charging screen still doesn’t appear, you’ll need to get the battery checked out 
by a technician.
Troubleshooting Apps
If an app stops responding, you can usually close it by using the App Switcher: double-
click the Home button to display the App Switcher, and then swipe the thumbnail for the 
problem app upward off the screen.
Once you’ve closed the app, try running it again. If the app stops responding again, 
close it by using the App Switcher once more. Then restart the iPad and try again.
If the app continues to give trouble after you restart the iPad, try deleting the app and 
then reinstalling it. Follow these steps:
	
1.	
On the Home screen, tap and hold the app’s icon until the 
apps start jiggling.
	
2.	
Tap the Delete (X) button at the upper-left corner of the app’s 
icon.
	
3.	
In the dialog that opens, tap the Delete button.
	
4.	
Press the Home button to stop the apps jiggling.
	
5.	
Tap the App Store button to launch the App Store app.
	
6.	
Tap the Purchased button at the bottom of the screen to 
display the Purchased list, which shows the apps you’ve 
purchased.
	
7.	
Tap the Not on This iPad tab to display its contents.
	
8.	
Locate the app—search if necessary—and the tap the 
Download icon (the cloud icon).

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
518
Once the download and installation finish, try running the app again.
■
■Note   If the app still crashes after you reinstall it, contact the app’s developer. From the 
Purchased screen in the App Store app, tap the app’s button to display the dialog containing its 
information. Tap the Reviews tab to display its contents, and then tap the App Support link.
Troubleshooting Wi-Fi and Network Connections
To get the most out of your school’s iPads, you’ll need to connect them to the school’s 
network and to the Internet via Wi-Fi. These days, Wi-Fi generally works pretty well—but 
plenty of things can still go wrong. This section shows you the moves you’ll need to keep 
the iPads connected to the network.
Turning Wi-Fi Off and Then On Again
If an iPad can’t connect to a Wi-Fi network, your first move should be to turn Wi-Fi off 
and then on again. Doing so forces the iPad to scan again for Wi-Fi networks.
You can toggle Wi-Fi on and off either from Control Center or in the Settings app:
• 
Control Center: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open 
Control Center. In iOS 10, make sure the iPad Controls card is 
displayed; if not, swipe left to display it. Look to verify that Wi-Fi 
is on; if not, tap the Wi-Fi icon to turn Wi-Fi on. Assuming Wi-Fi is 
on, tap the Wi-Fi icon to turn Wi-Fi off, wait a moment, and then 
tap the Wi-Fi icon again to turn Wi-Fi back on.
• 
Settings app: From the Home screen, choose Settings ➤ Wi-Fi, 
and then set the Wi-Fi switch to Off. Wait a few seconds, and then 
set the switch back to On.
Once Wi-Fi is running again, see if the iPad can connect to the Wi-Fi network. If not, 
continue with the following sections.
Renewing the Lease on a Wi-Fi Connection
If the iPad is using DHCP to get its IP address, your next troubleshooting move is to renew 
the lease. When a DHCP server assigns an IP address to a client device, it does so not 
forever but for a specific length of time, called a lease. The length of the lease depends on 
how the DHCP server is configured—you won’t be able to see the length of the lease on 
the iPad.
Normally, if the client stays connected to the network, the client and the DHCP 
server automatically renew the lease. But sometimes that doesn’t happen, and you may 
need to renew the lease manually.

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
519
To renew the lease, follow these steps:
	
1.	
From the Home screen, choose Home ➤ Settings ➤ Wi-Fi to 
display the Wi-Fi screen.
	
2.	
Tap the Info (i) button to display the screen for the network. 
Figure 9-36 shows an example of this screen, which is titled 
with the network’s name.
	
3.	
Tap the Renew Lease button. On iOS 11, a pop-up panel 
opens showing another Renew Lease button, as shown in 
Figure 9-36; on iOS 10, the Renew Lease dialog opens  
(see Figure 9-37).
Figure 9-37.  Tap the Renew button in the Renew Lease dialog
Figure 9-36.  Tap the Renew Lease button on the screen for the Wi-Fi network to try 
renewing the lease

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
520
	
4.	
Tap the Renew Lease button on iOS 11 or the Renew button on 
iOS 10. The iPad requests a new lease from the DHCP server.
Wait a few seconds and see if the iPad is able to connect to network resources or the 
Internet again.
Forgetting a Wi-Fi Network and Reconnecting to It
Your next troubleshooting step is to tell the iPad to forget the network, and then reconnect 
to it. Forgetting the network removes the password and any other details that the iPad has 
stored about the network.
■
■Note   In theory, you need to forget a Wi-Fi network and reconnect to it only if the 
network’s password or other security mechanism has changed and iOS has for some reason 
failed to prompt you for the new password or security information. But in practice, forgetting a 
network and reconnecting to it can clear up various Wi-Fi problems, so it’s well worth trying.
To forget a Wi-Fi network and reconnect to it, follow these steps:
	
1.	
From the Home screen, choose Home ➤ Settings ➤ Wi-Fi to 
display the Wi-Fi screen.
	
2.	
Tap the Info (i) button to display the screen for the network, 
which is titled with the network’s name.
	
3.	
Tap the Forget This Network button. The Forget Wi-Fi Network? 
dialog opens, also showing the network’s name (see Figure 9-38).
Figure 9-38.  Tap the Forget button in the Forget This Network? dialog to forget a Wi-Fi 
network’s information so that you can try reconnecting the iPad to the network
	
4.	
Tap the Forget button. The iPad forgets the information for the 
Wi-Fi network.
	
5.	
Tap the Wi-Fi button in the upper-left corner of the network’s 
screen to return to the Wi-Fi screen.

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
521
	
6.	
Tap the button for the network you’ve just forgotten. The 
Enter Password dialog opens.
	
7.	
Type the password.
	
8.	
Tap the Join button. The iPad connects to the network, and 
the network’s name appears with a check mark at the top of 
the Wi-Fi screen.
Turning Off Wi-Fi Assist on a Cellular iPad
On a cellular iPad, you may sometimes need to turn off the Wi-Fi Assist feature to sort out 
problems with a Wi-Fi network. Wi-Fi Assist automatically uses the cellular network to

Restarting the iPad
If you’ve worked through the troubleshooting steps in the previous sections, but the iPad 
still won’t connect to the Wi-Fi network, your next move is to restart the iPad. As usual, 
press and hold the Sleep/Wake button until the Slide to Power Off screen appears, and 
then slide the Slide to Power Off slider to the right.
Once the iPad has powered down, press and hold the Sleep/Wake button for a 
couple of seconds until the Apple logo appears on the screen. When the lock screen 
appears, type your passcode to unlock the iPad. Then try connecting to the Wi-Fi network 
again.
Resetting the Network Settings
If even restarting the iPad doesn’t clear up the problem with the Wi-Fi network, you may 
need to reset the iPad’s network settings. This move wipes the network settings clean; 
afterward, you must set up each network again from scratch, either manually or by using 
a profile.
To reset the network settings, follow these steps:
	
1.	
From the Home screen, choose Settings ➤ General ➤ Reset to 
display the Reset screen.
	
2.	
Tap the Reset Network Settings button. The Enter Passcode 
dialog opens.
	
3.	
Type your passcode. The Reset Network Settings dialog opens 
(see Figure 9-40).
	
4.	
Tap the Reset button. The iPad deletes the network settings 
and then restarts.
Figure 9-40.  Tap the Reset button in the Reset Network Settings dialog to delete all the 
network settings on the iPad so that you can set up each network again afresh

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom

5.	
When the lock screen appears, type your passcode to unlock 
the iPad.
	
6.	
From the Home screen, choose Settings ➤ Wi-Fi to display 
the Wi-Fi screen. You can then set up each Wi-Fi network as 
needed. See the section “Connecting to Wi-Fi Networks” in 
Chapter 3 for details.
■
■Note   Resetting the network settings removes any trusted relationships you have set up 
between the iPad and Windows or Mac computers. When you connect the iPad to a Windows 
PC or to a Mac, the iPad and iTunes prompt you to set up a trust relationship between the 
two.
Managing a Network with AirPort Utility
If you’ve installed Apple’s AirPort Utility app on an iPad, you can launch AirPort Utility 
by tapping the Manage This Network button on the screen for a Wi-Fi network, which 
you access from the Wi-Fi screen in the Settings app. This works only for Wi-Fi networks 
created by Apple’s AirPort devices, because these are the only wireless access points that 
AirPort Utility can manage.
■
■Note   Apple’s AirPort range includes three main types of device. The AirPort Extreme 
is a business-class wireless access point. The AirPort Time Capsule is an AirPort Extreme 
with one or more built-in hard drives for backup or sharing files. The AirPort Express is a 
consumer-class device that includes the ability to play audio streamed from iOS devices and 
from iTunes. However, as of this writing, Apple has disbanded the AirPort development team 
and appears to not be updating the devices.
The first time you tap this button, iOS displays a dialog telling you that “’Settings’ 
wants to open ‘AirPort Utility’.” Tap the Open button, and iOS launches and displays the 
AirPort Utility app. As you can see in Figure 9-41, you can tap one of the items shown to 
display information about it.

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
524
Once you’re using the AirPort Utility app, you can start configuring an AirPort device 
in AirPort Utility by tapping the device’s icon to display its Information window, and then 
tapping the Enter Password button in the Device Password dialog. You can then tap the 
Edit button to display the dialog for managing the device (see the example in Figure 9-42). 
The contents of this dialog depend on the AirPort device and model, but may include the 
following items:
• 
Base Station: Tap this button to display the Base Station dialog, 
where you can change the name assigned to the AirPort device 
and set its password.
Figure 9-41.  AirPort Utility, which you can launch by tapping the Manage This Network 
button on a Wi-Fi network’s screen in the Settings app, displays information about the 
AirPort devices and their configuration.

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
525
• 
Network: Tap this button to display the Network dialog, which 
enables you to set the Wi-Fi mode (your options are Create a 
Wireless Network, Extend a Wireless Network, or Off), specify the 
security method (such as WPA/WPA2 Enterprise), set the SSID, 
and set the password. You can also set the Hidden Network switch 
to On if you want to create a closed network rather than an open 
network.
• 
Guest Network: For an AirPort Extreme or AirPort Time Capsule 
model, you can turn on the Guest Network feature, assign a name 
to the guest network, and choose a security method.
• 
Internet Connection: Tap this button to display the Internet dialog, 
where you can configure DHCP, static IP, or PPPoE settings.
• 
Advanced: Tap this button to display the Advanced dialog, 
which includes items such as IPv6, DHCP and Network Address 
Translation (NAT), and access control.
Figure 9-42.  From AirPort Utility’s main dialog, which shows the name of the AirPort 
device, you can configure the base station, Wi-Fi network, guest network (on some devices), 
Internet connection, and advanced features.

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
526
■
■Note   The guest network on an AirPort Extreme or AirPort Time Capsule enables Wi-Fi 
devices to access the Internet but not any local network resources. The access point limits 
the guest network to a modest amount of bandwidth to prevent it from hogging the Internet 
connection. For convenience, you may choose not to implement a security method for the 
guest network or to use an easy-to-remember password that you give out freely to visitors.
Changing the DHCP or Static IP Settings on the iPad
To sort out other problems with the network settings on an iPad, you may need to 
manually configure its DHCP settings, static IP settings, or proxy settings. See the sections 
“Configuring DHCP Settings,” “Configuring Static IP Settings,” and “Configuring Proxy 
Settings” in Chapter 3 for coverage of these topics.
Restarting the Access Point if Possible
If you establish that multiple iPads—and perhaps other Wi-Fi computers or devices—are 
suffering network problems, you may need to restart the access point that’s providing the 
wireless network, or have a colleague restart it for you.
■
■Note   If the access point in question is an Apple AirPort device, you can restart it by 
using AirPort Utility on an iPad. To do so, launch AirPort Utility either from the Home screen 
or by tapping the Manage This Network button on the network’s screen in the Settings app, 
tap the icon for the AirPort device, and then tap the Edit button. In the dialog for the AirPort 
device, tap the Advanced button to display the Advanced dialog, tap the Restart Base Station 
button, and then tap the Restart button in the Restart Base Station dialog that opens to 
confirm the action.
Troubleshooting Cellular Connections
If you have cellular iPad models rather than Wi-Fi–only models, you may sometimes 
need to troubleshoot the cellular connection. The problem you’re most likely to face is 
cellular data not working at all, but it’s possible that you may need to connect the iPad to 
a different cellular access point.

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
527
Troubleshooting Cellular Data Not Working
If an iPad is unable to transfer data over the cellular connection, follow these steps to 
troubleshoot the problem:
• 
Toggle Airplane Mode: Toggle Airplane Mode to make the iPad 
refresh the cellular connection. You can toggle Airplane Mode 
either from Control Center (tap the Airplane Mode icon so that 
it goes orange, wait a few seconds, and then tap it again so that it 
goes gray) or in the Settings app (move the Airplane Mode switch 
at the top of the left column to On, wait a few seconds, and then 
move the switch back to Off).
• 
Ensure cellular data is on: From the Home screen, choose Settings ➤ 
Cellular Data to display the Cellular Data screen (see Figure 9-43). 
Then make sure the Cellular Data switch at the top of the screen is 
set to On.
Figure 9-43.  On the Cellular Data screen, make sure the Cellular Data switch is set to On. 
Then go to the Use Cellular Data For box and make sure the switch is set to On for each app 
you need to use via the cellular network

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
528
• 
Make sure cellular data is enabled for the apps you’re using: Still 
on the Cellular Data screen in the Settings app, look at the Use 
Cellular Data For box and make sure the switch is set to On for 
each app you want to be able to use cellular data.
■
■Tip  Usually the problem with the apps in the Use Cellular Data For box on the Cellular 
Data screen is the other way around—rather than useful apps having cellular disabled, all 
the switches are set to On, even for apps you’d seldom (if ever) need cellular data for, such 
as the built-in Tips app or AirPort Utility (for managing Apple’s AirPort Wi-Fi devices). Take 
a minute to review the apps and make sure that only the apps for which you need cellular 
data are set to use it.
• 
Enable or disable 4G, as needed: From the Cellular Data screen, 
tap the Cellular Data Options button to display the screen that 
should be called Cellular Data Options but at this writing doesn’t 
have a name (see Figure 9-44). On this screen, you can set the 
Enable 4G switch to On or Off, as needed.
• 
Enable or disable data roaming, as needed: On the same unnamed 
screen, set the Data Roaming switch to Off or On, as needed. Data 
roaming usually involves paying extra to the carrier involved, so 
normally, you’ll want to keep Data Roaming turned off all the 
time unless you go somewhere that requires it.
Figure 9-44.  On this screen, which has no title but which you reach from the Cellular Data 
screen, you can enable or disable 4G (or LTE) and data roaming, as needed

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
529
• 
Turn off Wi-Fi Assist: At the bottom of the Cellular Data screen, 
set the Wi-Fi Assist switch to Off unless you need the cellular 
connection to kick in when your current and available Wi-Fi 
networks have limited connectivity.
Connecting a Cellular iPad to a Different Access Point 
Name
Another move you may be able make to resolve cellular problems is to connect the iPad 
to a different access point name (APN) rather than the default APN. Whether you can do 
this depends on the carrier that provided your iPad’s SIM card and the type of cellular 
network the carrier provides. The APN is the identifier for the gateway between a cellular 
network (your carrier’s network, in this case) and another network (in this case, the 
Internet).
Normally, the iPad’s SIM card controls which APN the iPad connects to. You don’t 
normally need to change the APN, but here are a couple of circumstances when you 
might need to change it:
• 
Your school’s IT department provides a special APN for cellular 
devices to use: Usually, this happens only in large schools, 
institutions, or enterprises. In this case, you’d get the details 
you need—APN name, username, and password—from the IT 
department.
• 
Your carrier is altering its infrastructure and needs to move you 
to a different APN: This is relatively unusual. In this case, you’d 
get the APN name, username, and password from the carrier’s 
support staff.
You can connect to a different APN either manually, as described here, or by 
applying a configuration profile that includes the APN) information. Connecting 
manually works only if your carrier allows the settings to be changed on the iPad; if not, 
you can’t reach the settings. Applying a configuration profile works whether your carrier 
permits the change or not.
■
■Caution  If you change the APN manually, you’ll need to change it again after updating 
iOS, because updates restore the default APN settings.
To connect the iPad to a different APN, follow these steps:
	
1.	
From the Home screen, choose Settings ➤ Cellular Data to 
display the Cellular Data screen.
	
2.	
Tap the Cellular Data Options button to display the unnamed 
screen that might be called Cellular Data Options.

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
530
	
3.	
Tap the APN) Settings button to display the APN Settings 
screen (see Figure 9-45).
	
4.	
Tap the APN) field and type the APN name your IT 
department or carrier has given you.
	
5.	
Tap the Username field and type the username.
	
6.	
Tap the Password field and type the corresponding password.
The iPad saves the data automatically—there’s no Save button to tap.
To determine whether the iPad has connected to the cellular network with the new 
settings, tap the Wi-Fi button in the left column in the Settings app, and then set the Wi-Fi 
switch to Off. Then look at the status bar to see whether the cellular icon (such as the 3G 
icon, the 4G icon, or the LTE icon) appears toward the left end.
When you need to restore the default APN settings for your iPad’s carrier, tap the 
Reset Settings button on the APN Settings screen, and then tap the Reset button in the 
Reset dialog that opens (see Figure 9-46).
Figure 9-45.  The APN Settings screen enables you to connect a cellular iPad to a different 
APN (access point name) than the default APN for the iPad’s SIM card. Connecting to a 
different APN is a specialized move that you’re unlikely to need to perform
Figure 9-46.  Tap the Reset button in the Reset dialog to reset an iPad’s cellular settings to

Troubleshooting Bluetooth Issues
On the iPad, as on many other devices, Bluetooth generally works pretty well as long 
as the device is compatible with the iPad. Normally, you’ll discover any compatibility 
problems when you first try to use the device with the iPad. If you can’t get the iPad to 
recognize the device, or if the device and the iPad won’t pair, the device may well not be 
compatible.
■
■Note   See the section “Connecting Bluetooth Devices” in Chapter 3 for instructions on 
pairing a Bluetooth device with an iPad.
Follow these general steps to troubleshoot Bluetooth issues with devices that you’ve 
previously paired and used successfully:
• 
Turn the device off and then on again: How you do this depends 
on the device, so you may need to consult the documentation. 
If the device has only a single button, try holding it down for 
five or more seconds to turn the device off. If that works, release 
the button for a moment, and then hold it down for a few more 
seconds to turn the device back on.
• 
On the iPad, turn Bluetooth off and then on again: The easiest 
way to do this is to open Control Center, tap the Bluetooth icon to 
turn Bluetooth off, and then tap the Bluetooth icon again to turn 
it back on. (On iOS 10, you’ll need to make sure the iPad Controls 
card in Control Center is displayed.) Alternatively, choose Settings 
➤ Bluetooth from the Home screen, and then set the Bluetooth 
switch at the top of the Bluetooth screen to Off and then back to 
On.
• 
Restart the iPad: As usual, press and hold the Sleep/Wake button 
for a few seconds until the Slide to Power Off slider appears, and 
then move the slider to the right. After the iPad powers off, press 
and hold the Sleep/Wake button for a couple of seconds until the 
Apple logo appears on the screen.
• 
Forget the Bluetooth device and then pair with it again: From 
the Home screen, choose Settings ➤ Bluetooth to display the 
Bluetooth screen. Tap the Information (i) button for the device 
to display its screen, tap the Forget This Device button, and then 
tap the OK button in the Forget dialog that opens. Then put the 
device into pairing mode and try pairing it again.
■
■Tip   If you can’t pair the iPad with the device, make sure the device isn’t paired with 
another iPad or other device.

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom

UNDERSTANDING WHICH BLUETOOTH PROFILES THE 
IPAD MODELS SUPPORT
If you’re having trouble pairing an iPad with a Bluetooth device, or getting a paired 
device to work consistently, you may want to check that the iPad you’re using 
supports the Bluetooth profile that the device requires.
In the Bluetooth standards for wireless communication, a Bluetooth profile is a 
specification that gives details for a particular type of communication—for example, 
the Human Interface Device Protocol (HID for short) gives details of how input 
devices such as keyboards, mice, and game controllers can communicate via 
Bluetooth.
The iPad 2 and all subsequent iPad models support the following Bluetooth profiles, 
described with iPad-specific examples:
•	
Hands-Free Profile (HFP 1.6): This profile enables Bluetooth 
headsets and hands-free kits to communicate with the iPad.
•	
Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP): This profile enables the 
iPad to stream high-quality audio to a Bluetooth headset, Bluetooth 
speakers, or a car audio system.
•	
Audio/Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP 1.4): This profile enables 
the iPad to control playback of audio or video files on a compatible 
Bluetooth device. The iPad can browse the selection of files 
available and can give five playback commands: Play, Pause, Stop, 
Next, and Previous.
•	
Personal Area Networking Profile (PAN): This profile enables the iPad 
to send files to other Bluetooth-equipped devices and receive files 
from them.
•	
Human Interface Device Profile (HID): This profile enables input 
devices such as keyboards, mice, and game controllers to 
communicate with the iPad.
The first-generation iPad supports the Advanced Audio Distribution Profile, Audio/
Video Remote Control Profile, Personal Area Networking Profile, and Human Interface 
Device Profile, but it doesn’t support the Hands-Free Profile.

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
533
Troubleshooting Display Issues
On the iPad, the display does double duty, functioning as not only the main output 
device but also the main input device via its touch component. So when the display 
malfunctions, your means of communicating with the iPad are severely limited.
In this section, we’ll look at how to deal with color problems, screen-rotation 
problems, and problems with the screen being blank, unresponsive, or both. We’ll also 
touch on what to do if an iPad’s screen gets cracked.
Dealing with Colors Being Inverted, Grayscale, or Wrong
Normally, the iPad’s screen displays vivid colors, at least if you’ve got the brightness 
turned up far enough. So, if there are problems with the colors—such as the colors being 
muted, inverted, missing, or just plain wrong—you’ll likely notice soon enough.
All these problems are ones that can be produced by the Display Accommodations 
features in the iPad’s Accessibility settings, so start by opening the Settings app and seeing 
if this is the problem. From the Home screen, choose Settings ➤ General ➤ Accessibility 
to display the Accessibility screen, and then tap the Display Accommodations button in 
the Vision box to show the Display Accommodations screen (see Figure 9-47).
Once you’re at the Display Accommodations screen, you can resolve color problems 
quickly enough:
• 
Invert Colors: On iOS 11, if this button shows On, tap it to display 
the Invert Colors screen, set the Smart Invert switch or the Classic 
Invert switch to Off, and then tap the Display Accommodations 
button to return to the Display Accommodations screen. 
On iOS 10, the Invert Colors switch appears on the Display 
Accommodations screen; if this switch is set to On, set it to Off to 
restore inverted colors to normal.
Figure 9-47.  Visit the Display Accommodations screen in the Accessibility section of 
the Settings app to troubleshoot problems with missing or inverted colors, or colors that 
otherwise look wrong

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
534
• 
Color Filters: If the readout at the right side of this button says On, 
tap this button to display the Color Filters screen. Here, you can 
see which color filter is applied—Grayscale, Red/Green Filter, 
Green/Red Filter, Blue/Yellow Filter, or Color Tint. Set the Color 
Filters switch at the top of the screen to Off to turn off the filtering.
• 
Reduce White Point: If this switch is set to On, set it to Off to 
restore the intensity of bright colors.
Troubleshooting the Screen Rotation Being Stuck
If the screen seems to be stuck in portrait orientation or landscape orientation, first make 
sure the app you’re using supports rotation. Some apps are permanently portrait, while 
others are permanently landscape. Most of the built-in apps rotate, so if you need to 
check whether the screen is stuck, try an app such as Notes, Clock, or Settings—or just 
display the Home screen and try turning the iPad.
Once you’ve determined that the screen won’t rotate, look at the right side of the 
status bar to see if the Orientation Lock icon is displayed. (The Orientation Lock icon is 
a padlock with an arrow curling clockwise around it.) If the Orientation Lock icon does 
appear, open Control Center (on iOS 10, display the iPad Controls card if it doesn’t appear 
at first), and then tap the Orientation Lock icon to turn off Orientation Lock.
■
■Note   If the iPad has the physical Side Switch at the top of the right side (in Portrait 
mode), make sure the Side Switch is set to Off to ensure that it’s not locking the orientation.
Dealing with a Blank Screen
If the screen is blank but you believe the iPad is on (for example, because you were just 
using it, or because it’s still playing audio), follow as many of these steps as necessary:
• 
Press the Home button.
• 
Press the Sleep/Wake button a couple of times.
• 
Hold down the Sleep/Wake button for five seconds to try to 
display the Slide to Power Off slider. If it appears, drag the slider to 
the right to power the iPad down. Once it’s powered down, press 
and hold the Sleep/Wake button for a couple of seconds to start 
the iPad again.
• 
Hold down the Sleep/Wake button and the Home button for 
about 25 seconds to force the iPad to restart. When the Apple 
logo appears on the screen, release the buttons, and let the iPad 
continue restarting.

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
535
Dealing with No Response to the Touchscreen
If the touchscreen fails to respond to fingers (or thumbs), your first move should be to 
restart the iPad. Hold down the Sleep/Wake button for five seconds to display the Slide 
to Power Off slider, and then see if the touchscreen registers you moving the slider to the 
right. If so, wait for the iPad to power down, and then press and hold the Sleep/Wake 
button for a couple seconds to restart the device.
If the Slide to Power Off slider doesn’t appear, or if the iPad doesn’t respond to you 
moving the slider, force a restart by holding down the Sleep/Wake button and the Home 
button for about 25 seconds. Release the buttons when the Apple logo appears on the 
screen. Let the iPad finish restarting, and then see if the touchscreen is responding again.
If the touchscreen is still not responding, remove any case or screen protector from 
the iPad and try again. Clean the screen with a lint-free cloth, dampening it slightly with 
water if you need to remove gunk.
If the touchscreen still doesn’t respond after your tender, loving care, you’ll need to 
have a technician look at the iPad.
Dealing with Cracks in the Screen
As you likely know from experience, the screen is typically the most vulnerable hardware 
component of a tablet such as the iPad. So, even if you’ve armored up your school’s iPads 
with heavy-duty cases (as recommended in Chapter 2) or fixed them in position using 
secure mounts or stands (same chapter), some screens may still get cracked.
When this happens, you should plan to get the screen replaced:
• 
If the iPad is under an AppleCare plan, have Apple or an Apple-
certified repair establishment replace the screen.
• 
If the iPad doesn’t have AppleCare coverage, you may be able to 
save money by using less formal services.
• 
If you have technician-level skills, you can replace the screen 
yourself.
■
■Note   If the screen suffers minor cracks rather than full-on crazy paving, you may be 
able to smooth over the damage temporarily by applying a thick screen protector. Even if 
you do this, the damage will typically get worse with use, so plan to get the iPad repaired as 
soon as is practicable.

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
536
Troubleshooting Audio Issues
Normally, an iPad can output good-quality audio through its speakers at a decent 
volume—perhaps louder than you’ll want if students are using the iPads in the classroom. 
An iPad can also output audio to speakers or headphones through its headphone socket, 
to Bluetooth speakers or headphones via the Bluetooth wireless protocol, or to AirPlay 
speakers or an Apple TV via the AirPlay protocol.
This section discusses how to troubleshoot the audio issues your iPads are most 
likely to suffer. These issues include the following:
• 
No audio output: There’s no audio output at all.
• 
No audio output from speaker: There is no audio output from the 
speaker, although headphones work fine.
• 
Audio volume is too low: The audio volume is too low, and you 
can’t turn it up far enough.
• 
Audio is distorted: The sound plays back through the speaker or 
headphones, but it’s distorted.
• 
iPad can’t play audio via AirPlay: The iPad is unable to play 
through AirPlay speakers or speakers connected to Apple TV.
• 
iPad can’t play audio via Bluetooth: The iPad can’t play audio to 
Bluetooth speakers or headphones.
The following subsections show you how to deal with each of these audio issues in 
turn, except for AirPlay, which is covered in the section “Troubleshooting AirPlay and 
Apple TV,” later in the chapter.
Troubleshooting No Audio Output at All
If you’re not getting any audio output at all from the iPad, start by making sure that the 
audio isn’t muted. Usually, the easiest way to check is by pressing the physical Volume 
Up button on the iPad. When you do so, the Volume pop-up should appear briefly in the 
middle of the screen, indicating the current volume (see Figure 9-48).
Figure 9-48.  The Volume pop-up enables you not only to see the current volume but also to 
verify that the Volume Up button and Volume Down buttons are working

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
537
■
■Note   If the iPad is a model that has the Ring/Silent switch at the top of the right side, 
make sure the switch is set to the Ring setting. (The Silent setting shows orange underneath 
the switch, so if you see orange, move the switch to the opposite position.)
Alternatively, or as your next move if you get no response from the Volume Up 
button, open Control Center and check that the Mute icon isn’t red (which indicates that 
muting is turned on). In iOS 10, the Mute icon is on the iPad Controls card, so if the Music 
card appears at first, swipe left to display the iPad Controls card.
After making sure muting isn’t the problem, see which audio output device the iPad 
is using:
• 
iOS 11: Tap and hold the Music box (see the left screen in  
Figure 9-49) until it expands (see the center screen in Figure 9-49), 
and then tap the AirPlay icon in the upper-right corner. In the 
AirPlay dialog that opens (see the right screen in Figure 9-49), 
see which audio output device bears a checkmark; tap the iPad 
button to use the iPad’s speakers.
Figure 9-49.  In iOS 11, tap and hold the Music box (left) to expand it (center), then tap the 
AirPlay icon in the upper-right corner to display the AirPlay dialog (right). You can then see 
which audio output device the iPad is using
• 
iOS 10: After opening Control Center, swipe left to display the 
Now Playing card (see Figure 9-50), and then look at the box on 
the right side to see which audio output device the iPad is using. 
If necessary, tap the iPad button to switch the output back to the 
iPad’s speakers.

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
538
MAKING SURE THE PORTS ARE DRY AND CLEAN
Make sure the iPad’s headphone port is dry, because moisture in the port can trick 
the sensors into detecting headphones when none is plugged in.
If the headphone port is visibly wet—for example, if you can see a drop of water 
protruding from it—use a cotton bud to remove as much water as possible, and 
then use warm air to remove the rest. If the problem is that the iPad has been in 
a steamy environment, try inserting a headphone plug and see if the headphones 
produce sound. If so, try inserting and removing the headphone plug a few times to 
try to clear the problem.
If the iPad is an older model that has the Dock connector port rather than the 
Lightning port, make sure the Dock connector port doesn’t have dust, dirt, or debris 
in it. The Dock connector port is a digital audio output for older models of iPad (and 
iPhone, and iPod), and “foreign objects” in the Dock connector port may make the 
iPad try to output audio through that port instead of through the speakers or the 
headphone port.
Troubleshooting Low Sound Volume
If the iPad is producing only a low volume of sound, the problem may simply be that the 
output volume is turned down. If not, the iPad may have a volume limit imposed. This 
volume limit may have a Volume Limit restriction applied to prevent the limit from being 
changed.
Figure 9-50.  In iOS 10, look at the box on the right side of the Now Playing card in Control 
Center to see which audio output device the iPad is using

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
539
■
■Note   If the iPad is connected to speakers via a cable plugged into its headphone 
socket, make sure the 3.5 mm jack on the cable is fully inserted and that both the jack and 
the headphone socket are free of lint or dirt.
Troubleshooting Low Sound Volume
If the iPad is producing only a low volume of sound, first press the physical Volume Up 
button on the iPad to increase the volume. When you do so, the Volume pop-up should 
appear briefly in the middle of the screen, indicating the current volume.
If you don’t see the Volume pop-up, the Volume Up button may be stuck. Try 
pressing the Volume Down button instead.
■
■Tip   Barring straightforward damage, the Volume Up button and Volume Down button 
are usually more likely to stick if the iPad is in a case. The case’s buttons may themselves 
become stuck, or they may not be aligned correctly with the iPad’s buttons. So, if the iPad 
you’re troubleshooting is wearing a case, try removing the case so that you can manipulate 
the buttons directly.
If pressing the Volume Down button doesn’t display the Volume pop-up, open 
Control Center. On iOS 10, swipe left to display the Now Playing card (unless the iPad 
displays it at first). Then drag the Volume slider to adjust the volume.
Troubleshooting Low Sound Volume Because of a Volume Limit
If the volume controls on the iPad seem to be working correctly, but you still can’t get 
enough volume even if you crank the volume up all the way, chances are that the iPad has 
a volume limit set. The volume limit may simply be set on the Music screen in the Settings 
app, but it’s likely to be imposed with a Volume Limit restriction.
To find out whether a restriction is in place, choose Settings ➤ Music to display the 
Music screen in the Settings app. Tap the Volume Limit button to display the Volume 
Limit screen, and then see if you can move the Max Volume slider. If you can’t move it, a 
restriction is in place.
To lift the restriction so you can change the volume, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Scroll back up the left column in the Settings app, and then 
tap the General button to display the General screen.
	
2.	
Tap the Restrictions button. The Enter Passcode dialog opens.
	
3.	
Type the Restrictions passcode. The Restrictions screen 
appears.

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
540
	
4.	
Scroll down to the bottom of the screen.
	
5.	
In the Allow Changes box, tap the Volume Limit button to 
display the Volume Limit screen.
You can now go back to the Music screen in the Settings app and drag the Max 
Volume slider to increase the volume as needed.
Troubleshooting Distorted Audio Output
If the audio output from the iPad’s speakers is distorted, you need to look into several 
potential causes. The problem may simply be the playback volume, it may be physical, or 
it may be in the iPad’s configuration.
Take the steps in the following subsections to troubleshoot distorted audio output.
Checking the Playback Volume
First, make sure the iPad isn’t playing back at full or near-full volume. As usual, either 
press the Volume Down button and look at the Volume pop-up that appears in the middle 
of the screen, or swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open Control Center—on iOS 
10, swipe left (if needed) to display the Now Playing card—and then check the setting of 
the Volume slider.
Checking for Physical Damage and Foreign Bodies
Once you’ve determined that volume isn’t the problem, look at the speakers to see if 
they’ve sustained physical damage or what doctors and technicians call “foreign bodies.” 
Remove any case the iPad is wearing, and then pick any dust bunnies, gum, or debris off the 
speakers. If necessary, use a can of compressed air to blow dust out of the speaker grille.
Restarting the iPad
If the speakers seem okay but the sound is still distorted, it’s worth restarting the iPad at 
this point. Restarting can clear up a wide variety of problems and normally takes less than 
a minute, so even if it doesn’t work, you have little to lose.
Resetting All Settings
If restarting the iPad fails to remove the distortion from the audio output, you may need 
to reset all settings on the iPad. To do so, follow these steps:
	
1.	
From the Home screen, choose Settings ➤ General ➤ Reset ➤ 
Reset to display the Reset screen.
	
2.	
Tap the Reset All Settings button. The Enter Passcode dialog 
opens.

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
541
	
3.	
Type your main passcode (the one you use to unlock the 
iPad). The first Reset All Settings dialog opens.
■
■Note  If you’ve applied restrictions to the iPad, the Enter Passcode dialog box opens 
again, prompting you to enter your Restrictions passcode. This security check prevents a 
user from using the Reset All Settings move to remove restrictions.
	
4.	
Tap the Reset button. The second Reset All Settings dialog 
opens, double-checking that you want to reset all the settings.
■
■Note  After resetting all settings, you’ll need to configure each Wi-Fi network the iPad 
uses, together with other settings, such as restrictions. See the section “Resetting an iPad to 
Cure Minor Ills,” earlier in this chapter, for more detail on the various types of reset you can 
perform on an iPad.
	
5.	
Tap the Reset button. The iPad restarts, taking longer than 
usual because it wipes the settings clean.
	
6.	
Once the iPad has restarted, unlock it, choose Settings ➤  
Wi-Fi, and then connect to the local Wi-Fi network.
Troubleshooting Mono Audio
If an iPad has stereo speakers but plays audio through only one channel, the problem is 
usually that mono audio has been enabled or that the left-right sound balance has been 
switched to one side. Both these settings belong to the Accessibility settings.
To see if either mono audio or the left-right balance is the problem, follow these steps:
	
1.	
From the Home screen, choose Settings ➤ General ➤ 
Accessibility to display the Accessibility screen.
	
2.	
Scroll down to the Hearing section if you can’t see it at first.
	
3.	
Make sure the Mono Audio switch is set to Off.
	
4.	
Make sure the L–R slider is set to its midpoint.
If this move doesn’t fix the problem, it’s possible that the nonplaying speaker has 
been damaged and needs to be replaced.

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
542
Troubleshooting the iPad Being Unable to Play Audio via 
Bluetooth
If the iPad can’t play audio to a Bluetooth speaker or headset, first verify that the 
Bluetooth speaker or headset appears in the list of devices and that it’s selected for 
playback. Here’s how to do this on iOS 11 and iOS 10:
• 
iOS 11: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open Control 
Center. Tap and hold the Music box until it expands, and then tap 
the AirPlay icon in the upper-right corner. In the AirPlay dialog 
that opens, make sure the Bluetooth speaker or headset has a 
checkmark next to it; if not, tap its button to select it.
• 
iOS 10: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open Control 
Center. If the iPad Controls card appears, swipe left to display the 
Now Playing card, and then look at the box on the right side to 
see which audio output device the iPad is using. If necessary, tap 
the button for the Bluetooth speaker or headset to switch audio 
output to that device.
Once you’ve checked the device, follow the steps in the “Troubleshooting Bluetooth 
Issues,” earlier in this chapter, to resolve the problem.
Troubleshooting AirPlay and Apple TV
AirPlay can be a great way to share audio and video in the classroom. If you run into 
problems with it, you need to make sure the AirPlay device or Apple TV is on and is 
connected to the network, check whether the iPad can see the device, and ensure that 
AirPlay is enabled. The following subsections give you the details.
Making Sure the AirPlay Device or Apple TV Is On
First, make sure that the AirPlay device or Apple TV is powered on and that it’s not 
signaling a problem. For example:
• 
AirPort Express: The AirPort Express displays a green light when 
it’s on and all is well. If you see a yellow light or orange light, try 
restarting the AirPort. You may also need to reconfigure it.
• 
Apple TV: The Apple TV displays a solid white light when it’s on 
and happy. If the LED is flashing, restart the Apple TV, and then 
reconfigure it if necessary.
If you’re trying to play audio, check that the speakers, monitor, or TV are powered on 
and that the volume isn’t set to zero or otherwise muted.
If you’re trying to play video, verify that the monitor or TV is connected to the Apple 
TV and powered on.

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
543
Checking the Network Connection
Next, check the network connection on the AirPlay device or Apple TV. For example:
• 
AirPort Express: If the AirPort Express uses a wired connection, 
make sure a network cable is plugged into its Ethernet port.
• 
Apple TV: Look at the monitor and TV to make sure it’s not 
displaying the message “Your Apple TV is not connected to the 
network.” If this message does appear, either plug a network cable 
into the Ethernet port or choose Settings ➤ General ➤ Network 
and connect to the appropriate Wi-Fi network.
Checking Whether the iPad Can See the AirPlay Device or 
Apple TV
Once you’re sure the AirPlay device or Apple TV is powered on and is connected to 
the network, open Control Center on the iPad and see whether the device or Apple TV 
appears in it. As usual with Control Center, this is different in iOS 11 and iOS 10:
• 
iOS 11: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open Control 
Center. For an Apple TV, tap the Screen Mirroring button and 
see if the Apple TV appears in the Screen Mirroring dialog. For 
an AirPlay device, tap and hold the Music box until it expands, 
tap the AirPlay icon in the upper-right corner to open the AirPlay 
dialog, and then see if the device appears.
• 
iOS 10: Swipe up from the bottom of the screen to open Control 
Center. For an Apple TV, tap the AirPlay Mirroring button on the 
iPad Controls card and see if the AirPlay dialog lists the Apple TV. 
For an AirPlay device, swipe left to display the Now Playing card, 
and then see if the list on the right side includes the device.
If the device appears, you’re in business.
Checking the Wi-Fi Network
For AirPlay to work, the iPad and the AirPlay device or Apple TV must be on the same Wi-
Fi network. To check, choose Settings ➤ Wi-Fi from the Home screen and see which Wi-Fi 
network the iPad is on. If it’s the wrong network, connect to the right one.
Making Sure AirPlay Is Enabled
If you’ve checked that the iPad and the AirPlay device or Apple TV are on the same Wi-Fi 
network, but the iPad still can’t see the device or Apple TV, make sure that AirPlay is 
enabled on the device or Apple TV. For example:
• 
AirPort Express: Run the AirPort Utility app and tap the icon for 
the AirPort Express. Tap the Edit button to open the main dialog 
for configuring the AirPort, and then tap the AirPlay button to 
display the AirPlay dialog (see Figure 9-51). Set the Enable AirPlay 
switch to On, and then tap the Done button.

Chapter 9 ■ Troubleshooting iPads in the Classroom 
544
• 
Apple TV: Choose Settings ➤ AirPlay, and then set the AirPlay 
option to On.
Summary
In this chapter, you’ve learned to deal with a variety of the problems you’re most likely to 
encounter when running a fleet of iPads in the classroom. You now know how to locate 
a missing iPad, lock it and display a message on it, and erase it if necessary. You’ve seen 
how to use iOS’ various reset operations to clear up assorted problems, and how to 
troubleshoot apps, network connections, Bluetooth issues, display issues, and problems 
with audio and with connecting to AirPort devices and Apple TVs.
Figure 9-51.  Set the Enable AirPlay switch in the AirPlay dialog to On to enable AirPlay on 
an AirPort Express.
