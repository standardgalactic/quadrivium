Preface
We are quite proud and very thankful to have produced a book that has been so enduringly popu-
lar. The book has been adopted by universities and colleges around the world, and it has been 
translated into Chinese and Russian.
Both Joel and I (Barry) are pleased to welcome a new co-author for this edition. Dr. Patrali 
Chatterjee (Ph.D. in Management with a major in Marketing) is a Full Professor of Marketing in 
the Feliciano School of Business at Montclair State University. She is currently an officer for the 
American Collegiate Retailing Association (ACRA). She has published her research in several 
academic journals and been featured in business media, as well. Professor Chatterjee has also 
consulted for several Fortune 500 companies.
As we move further into the twenty-first century, our goal is to seamlessly meld the tradi-
tional framework of retailing with the realities of the competitive environment and the emergence of 
high-tech as a backbone for retailing. Retail Management: A Strategic Approach is a cutting-edge 
text, while retaining the coverage and features most desired by professors and students. To remain 
timely, we regularly post material about current events at our blog (www.­bermanevansretail.com), 
which already has more than 1,500 posts and viewers from 180 countries.
Our enthusiasm for teaching and writing remains quite high. We all teach a full schedule 
of undergraduate and graduate courses in the Zarb School of Business at Hofstra University 
(Barry and Joel) and the Feliciano School of Business at Montclair State University (Patrali); 
both schools are fully accredited by AACSB International. We have been all been active in and 
supportive of ACRA. Barry has served as president and is in the ACRA Hall of Fame, while Joel 
has edited several conference proceedings and Patrali is an officer on the board.
The concepts of a strategic approach and a retail strategy remain our cornerstones. We were 
the first authors to take this primary orientation to the teaching of retail management. With a 
strategic approach, the fundamental principle is that the retailer has to plan for and adapt to a 
complex, changing environment. Both opportunities and constraints must be considered. A retail 
strategy is the overall plan or framework of action that guides a retailer. Ideally, it will be at least 
one year in duration and outline the mission, goals, consumer market, overall and specific activi-
ties, and control mechanisms of the retailer. Without a pre-defined and well-integrated strategy, 
the firm may flounder and be unable to cope with the environment that surrounds it. Through our 
text, we want the reader to become a good retail planner and decision maker and be able to adapt 
to change.
Retail Management is designed as a one-semester text for students of retailing or retail man-
agement. Due to the flexible pedagogical elements that accompany the book and the ability of 
the instructor to cover all or selected chapters in the book, Retail Management has been used by 
four-year and two-year schools, in undergraduate and graduate courses, and by business schools 
and nonbusiness schools. In many cases, students will have already been exposed to marketing 
principles. We feel retailing should be viewed as one form of marketing and not distinct from it.
NEW TO THE THIRTEENTH EDITION
Since the first edition of Retail Management: A Strategic Approach, we have sought to be as con-
temporary and forward-looking as possible. We are proactive rather than reactive in our prepa-
ration of each edition. That is why we still take this adage of Walmart’s founder, the late Sam 
Walton so seriously: “Commit to your business. Believe in it more than anybody else.”
For the Thirteenth Edition, there are many changes in Retail Management:
1.	 All data and examples are as current as possible and reflect the current economic and world 
situations as much as possible. We believe it is essential that our book take into account the 
economic environment that has dramatically affected so many businesses and consumers.
2.	 There is now extensive coverage of omnichannel retailing—an evolving practice whereby 
the best retailers understand and seamlessly integrate all of their interactions across channels 
(including stores, online, mobile, social media, and more).

Substantive Changes for the Thirteenth Edition by Chapter
▶
▶Chapter 1 (An Introduction to Retailing). The importance of omnichannel retailing is high-
lighted. We describe Home Depot’s overall strategy and its approach to the complex market-
place. And to properly capture the importance of the economic situation facing retailers today, 
we update the chapter appendix to reflect the state of economy after the worldwide recession 
period: “Understanding the Recent Economic Environment in the United States Around the 
Globe.” The appendix covers the U.S. economy, the global effects of the downturn, the effect 
of the current economic climate on retailing, and strategic options for retailers.
▶
▶Chapter 2 (Building and Sustaining Relationships in Retailing). There is more coverage 
of “value” and “relationships” in retailing—with both customers and other channel members. 
Retailer interactions with customers depend on the customer base and customer service, 
and they have an impact on customer satisfaction; and there are different types of loyalty 
programs. Emerging technologies often enable retailers to form stronger relationships; and 
retailer ethics can stimulate or deter shoppers. The end-of-chapter appendix (“Planning for 
the Unique Aspects of Service Retailing”) reflects current thinking on service retailing.
▶
▶Chapter 3 (Strategic Planning in Retailing). There is greater attention to strategic plan-
ning in today’s marketplace, with numerous examples. The software that supplements the 
section of this chapter devoted to a strategic planning template—Computer-Assisted Strategic 
Retail Management Planning—has been updated and is available for download at our blog  
(www.bermanevansretail.com). The chapter appendix (“The Special Dimensions of Strate-
gic Planning in a Global Retailing Environment”) notes the challenges for retailers operating 
outside their home markets and various trends in global retailing.
▶
▶Chapter 4 (Retail Institutions by Ownership). All of the data on retail ownership formats 
(independents, chain-owned, franchisee-operated, leased departments, owned by manufac-
turers or wholesalers, or consumer-owned) have been updated. The appendix on franchis-
ing opportunities (“The Dynamics of Franchising”) presents current information on various 
aspects of franchising.
▶
▶Chapter 5 (Retail Institutions by Store-Based Strategy Mix). All of the data on store-
based retail strategies have been updated – 14 strategic formats in all that are divided into 
food-based and general-merchandise-based categories. There are numerous new examples.
▶
▶Chapter 6 (Web, Nonstore-Based, and Other Forms of Nontraditional Retailing). The 
emerging and critical omnichannel perspective of retailing is discussed in more detail in this 
chapter than in Chapter 1; and single-channel, multichannel, and omnichannel retailing are 
contrasted. The coverage of online retailing reflects the present state of the Web and mobile 
channels, and includes many examples. There is a fully updated and refocused appendix on 
retail supply chains (“Omnichannel Retailing”) and its impact.
▶
▶Chapter 7 (Identifying and Understanding Consumers). There is a strong emphasis on 
the retailing ramifications of the empowered consumer, as well as consumer characteristics, 
attitudes, and behavior. We include current demographic data on U.S. and foreign consumers, 
consumer profiles, and shopping attitudes and behavior.
▶
▶Chapter 8 (Information Gathering and Processing in Retailing). This chapter looks at 
information flows in a retail distribution channel and notes the ramifications of inadequate 
research. We then describe the retail information system, database management, and data 
warehousing. The barcode discussion is enhanced.
▶
▶Chapter 9 (Trading-Area Analysis). There is new material on geographic information sys-
tems, as well as many new retail applications. We have increased the coverage of the TIGER 
digital mapping system, which is the basis for most geographic information systems’ software.
▶
▶Chapter 10 (Site Selection). We include many new retail applications and examples.
▶
▶Chapter 11 (Retail Organization and Human Resource Management). There is more 
emphasis on employee turnover and the human resource environment in retailing, as well as 
updated coverage of women and minorities in retailing. We also have substantially revised 
some of the organization charts.
▶
▶Chapter 12 (Operations Management: Financial Dimensions). We have new material on 
incremental and zero-based budgeting, as well as updated information on key business ratios, 
financial trends, and resource allocation.

16	
PREFACE
▶
▶Chapter 13 (Operations Management: Operational Dimensions). There is a new discus-
sion of digital payment systems, as well as updated material on operations issues in retailing.
▶
▶Chapter 14 (Developing Merchandise Plans). Innovative practices are highlighted. We 
place greater emphasis on a merchandising-based philosophy and the activities necessary to 
carry it out. There is updated coverage of merchandising practices, the popularity of private 
brands (including a new quiz), and category management.
▶
▶Chapter 15 (Implementing Merchandise Plans). There is enhanced coverage of the power 
of large retailers, RFID (radio frequency identification), logistics, and inventory management.
▶
▶Chapter 16 (Financial Merchandise Management). There is updated coverage of financial 
merchandise management, including unanticipated markdowns.
▶
▶Chapter 17 (Pricing in Retailing). We focus on the retailer’s need to provide value to 
­customers, regardless of its price orientation—and the growing power of the consumer due 
to online comparison shopping.
▶
▶Chapter 18 (Establishing and Maintaining a Retail Image). We place more focus on the 
total retail experience (both in the store and online), retail positioning, and atmospherics and 
Web-based retailers, as well as how to increase shopping time.
▶
▶Chapter 19 (Promotional Strategy). There are many new applications and examples—­
especially with regard to mobile apps and social media—and a strong strategic emphasis on 
the retail promotional strategy.
▶
▶Chapter 20 (Integrating and Controlling the Retail Strategy). There is an in-depth dis-
cussion on integrating the retail strategy in today’s high-tech marketplace, as well as how to 
assess a strategy, with a detailed example based on TJX.
▶
▶Appendix (Careers in Retailing). We emphasize the strong long-term possibilities (through 
2024) for careers in retailing. There is a new table citing 10 retail positions with unique 
responsibilities.
BUILDING ON THE E-VOLUTION OF RETAIL MANAGEMENT: A 
STRATEGIC APPROACH
From a retailer perspective, we see four formats—all covered in Retail Management—­competing 
in the new millennium (cited in descending order of importance):
▶
▶Combined “bricks-and-mortar” and “clicks-and-mortar” retailers. These are store-based 
retailers that also offer online shopping, thus providing customers the ultimate in choice 
and convenience. Virtually all of the world’s largest retailers, as well as many medium and 
small firms, fall into this category; and they are omnichannel retailers. This is clearly the 
fast-growing format in retailing. Even Amazon.com, a long-time online only retailer, is now 
opening some physical stores.
▶
▶Clicks-and-mortar retailers. These are the online-only retailers that have emerged. Rather 
than use their own physical store facilities, these companies promote a “virtual” shopping 
experience: wide selections, convenience, and—sometimes—low prices. Among the firms in 
this category are Priceline—the discount airfare and hotel retailer—and Zappos –the retailer 
of shoes, apparel, and a whole lot more.
▶
▶Direct marketers with clicks-and-mortar retailing operations. These are firms that have 
relied on traditional nonstore media such as print catalogs, direct selling in homes, and TV 
infomercials to generate business. Almost of them have added Web sites to enhance their 
businesses. Leaders include Lands’ End and QVC. These direct marketers will continue to 
see a dramatic increase in the proportion of sales coming from the Web.
▶
▶Bricks-and-mortar retailers. These are companies that rely on their physical facilities to 
make sales. They do not sell online but use the Web for providing information and customer 
service and for image building. Auto dealers typically offer product information and cus-
tomer service online but conduct their sales transactions at retail stores. Firms in this category 
represent the smallest grouping of retailers. Many will need to rethink their approach as 
online ­competition intensifies.
We now have access to more information sources, from global trade associations to gov-
ernment agencies. The information in Retail Management, Thirteenth Edition, is more current 

	
PREFACE	
17	
than ever because we are using the original sources themselves and not waiting for data to be 
published months or a year after being compiled. We are also able to include a greater range of 
real-world examples because of the information at company Web sites.
Will this help you? Yes. You will benefit because our philosophy has always been to make 
Retail Management as reader-friendly, up-to-date, and useful as possible. In addition, we want 
students to benefit from our experiences—in this case, our E-xperiences.
Retail Management: A Strategic Approach, Thirteenth Edition, incorporates many E-features 
in the book; and at our lively and constantly updated blog (www.bermanevansretail.com).
Our blog includes many features that are intended to enrich both the student’s and profes-
sor’s understanding and appreciation of retailing. These include:
▶
▶More than 1,600 blog posts and counting. To stay current, we post multiple times EVERY 
week!
▶
▶A multimedia approach—with embedded videos, colorful infographics (charts with data), 
photos, and links to a huge number of real world sources.
▶
▶Post categories keyed to each of 8 parts of the book.
▶
▶Additional post categories on such important issues as: Careers in Retailing, Global Retail-
ing, Nontraditional Retailing, Online Retailing, Privacy and Identity Theft, Social Media and 
Retailing, and Strategy Mix.
But, that’s not all! Our Web site has career material; and each chapter of the book ends with 
a Web-based exercise.
BUILDING ON A STRONG TRADITION
Besides introducing the E-features just mentioned, Retail Management, Thirteenth Edition, care-
fully builds on its heritage as the market leader in strategic retail management. These features 
have been retained from earlier editions of Retail Management:
▶
▶A strategic decision-making orientation, with many illustrative flow charts, figures, tables, 
and photos. The chapter coverage is geared to the six steps used in developing and applying 
a retail strategy, which are first described in Chapter 1.
▶
▶Full coverage of all major retailing topics—including merchandising, consumer behavior, 
information systems, omnichannel retailing, store location, operations, logistics, service 
retailing, the retail audit, retail institutions, franchising, human resource management, com-
puterization, and retailing in a changing environment.
▶
▶A real-world approach focusing on both small and large retailers.
▶
▶Real-world boxes on current retailing issues in each chapter. These boxes further illustrate 
the concepts presented in the text by focusing on real firms and situations.
▶
▶A numbered summary keyed to chapter objectives, a key terms listing, and discussion ques-
tions at the end of each chapter.
▶
▶Both short cases involving a wide range of retailers and retail practices and comprehensive 
cases.
▶
▶Up-to-date information from such sources as Advertising Age, Businessweek, Chain Store 
Age, Direct Marketing, Entrepreneur, Fortune, Inc., International Journal of Retail & Dis-
tribution Management, Journal of Retailing, Multichannel Merchant, Progressive Grocer, 
Retailing Today, Shopping Centers Today, Standard & Poor’s, Stores, and Wall Street Journal.
▶
▶End-of-chapter appendixes on service retailing (following Chapter 2), global retailing (fol-
lowing Chapter 3), and franchising (following Chapter 4).
▶
▶End-of-text appendix “Careers in Retailing” and a glossary.
HOW THE TEXT IS ORGANIZED
Retail Management: A Strategic Approach has eight parts. Part One introduces the field of retail-
ing, the basics of strategic planning, the importance of building and maintaining relations, and 
the decisions to be made in owning or managing a retail business. In Part Two, retail institutions 
are examined in terms of ownership types, as well as store-based, nonstore-based, electronic, and 
nontraditional strategy mixes. The wheel of retailing, scrambled merchandising, the retail life

PREFACE
cycle, and the Web are covered. Part Three focuses on target-marketing and information-gather-
ing methods, including discussions of why and how consumers shop and the retailing informa-
tion system and data warehouse. Part Four presents a four-step approach to location planning: 
trading-area analysis, choosing the most desirable type of location, selecting a general locale, 
and deciding on a specific site.
Part Five discusses the elements involved in managing a retail business: the retail orga-
nization structure, human resource management, and operations management (both financial 
and operational). Part Six deals with merchandise management—developing and implementing 
merchandise plans, the financial aspects of merchandising, and pricing. In Part Seven, the ways 
to communicate with customers are analyzed, with special attention paid to retail image, atmo-
sphere, and promotion. Part Eight deals with integrating and controlling a retail strategy.
At the end of the text, Appendix: Careers in Retailing highlights career opportunities in re-
tailing. There is also a comprehensive Glossary.

hope you find the book is informative, timely, action-oriented, and reader-friendly. Visit our 
popular blog (www.bermanevansretail.com) for interactive, useful, up-to-date features that 
complement the text—including chapter hotlinks, a study guide, and much more!
In Part One, we explore the field of retailing, establishing and maintaining relationships, and 
the basic principles of strategic planning and the decisions made in owning or managing a 
retail business.
Chapter 1 describes retailing, shows why it should be studied, and examines its special 
characteristics. We note the value of strategic planning, including a detailed review of Home 
Depot (a titan of retailing). The retailing concept is presented, along with the total retail 
experience, customer service, and relationship retailing. The focus and format of the text 
are comprehensive. An appendix, “Understanding the Recent Economic Environment in the 
United States and Around the Globe,” appears at the end of this chapter.
Chapter 2 looks at the complexities of retailers’ relationships—with both customers and other 
channel members. We examine value and the value chain, customer relationships and channel 
relationships, the differences in relationship building between goods and service retailers, the 
impact of technology on retailing relationships, and the interplay between ethical performance 
and relationships in retailing. The chapter ends with an appendix on planning for the unique 
aspects of service retailing.
Chapter 3 shows the usefulness of strategic planning for all kinds of retailers. We focus on 
the planning process: situation analysis, objectives, identifying consumers, overall strategy, 
specific activities, control, and feedback. We also look at the controllable and uncontrollable 
parts of a retail strategy. Strategic planning is shown as a series of interrelated steps that are 
continuously reviewed. A detailed computerized strategic planning template, available at 
our Web site, is described. At the end of the chapter, there is an appendix on the strategic 
implications of global retailing.

Digital technologies such as Web 2.0, social media, and mobile media have dramatically 
altered how businesses and consumers get information, make decisions, communicate, 
transact, and own versus share possessions around the world. In this always-connected, 
24/7/365 competitive retailing landscape, consumers choose how, when, and where they 
want to interact with retailers. Retailers are expected to be proactive and adaptive in 
anticipating their consumers’ needs at the time and utilize an omnichannel approach to 
provide the customer with a seamless shopping experience, whether the customer is shopping 
online from a desktop or a mobile device, by telephone, or in a bricks-and-mortar store. 
Accordingly, in Retail Management: A Strategic Approach, we begin each chapter with a 
discussion of omnichannel perspectives relevant to the retailing topics in that chapter.
How do we distinguish between multichannel and omnichannel experiences? Multichannel 
retailing is associated with a retailer having separate channels—store and Web—as 
alternatives. A traditional multichannel retail environment has few linkages among these 
channel alternatives. Simply put, although shoppers can purchase an item through either 
channel, important linkages among channels may not exist. For example, consumers may 
not be able to view store inventories online, can be charged different prices in each channel, 
cannot arrange for store pickup on a Web order, may not return Web purchases to a local 
store, and a store and Web site can have separate customer databases.
In contrast, omnichannel retailing delivers a consistent, uninterrupted, and seamless brand 
experience regardless of channel or device (store, laptop computer, iPad, smartphone, etc.). 
Omnichannel retailing assumes that there are various shopping journey maps that use mobile, 
Web, and stores quite differently. As an example, product discovery can be Web or social-
media–based, information search can use the Web or in-store observation, and consumers can 
purchase an item via a mobile device but seek to return it to a store. Omnichannel retailing is 
by nature seamless and integrated.
At www.bermanevansretail.com, we’ve set up a dynamic retailing blog with all sorts of 
interesting and current information—retailer links, career opportunities, news about the retail 
industry and individual retailers, and more. Check it out!
Many different kinds of retailers, both large and small, utilize multiple technologies, employ 
social and mobile media to communicate with customers, reinforce their images, introduce 
new locations and merchandise, sell products, run special promotions, and so much more.

 
CHAPTER 1  •  An Introduction to Retailing	
23	
Overview
Retailing encompasses the business activities involved in selling goods and services to consumers 
for their personal, family, or household use. It includes every sale to the final consumer—­ranging 
from cars to apparel to meals at restaurants to movie tickets. Retailing is the last stage in the 
­distribution process from supplier to consumer.
Today, retailing is at a complex crossroad. On the one hand, retail sales are at their highest 
point in history (despite a dip during the 2008–2010 “Great Recession”). Walmart is the lead-
ing company in the world in terms of sales, but Amazon.com, predominately an online retailer 
with few physical stores as of this writing has an annual growth rate of 25 percent compared to  
1 percent for Walmart.1 New technologies are improving retail productivity. There are many oppor-
tunities to start a new retail business—or work for an existing one—and to become a ­franchisee. 
Global retailing possibilities abound, especially for pure-online retailers that can replicate their 
business models globally without the capital costs of store-based retailing.
On the other hand, retailers face numerous challenges. The rise of the U.S. dollar against 
major currencies in recent years has had a major impact on retailers, their suppliers, and con-
sumers around the world. Many consumers are bored with shopping for products or do not have 
much time for it and are spending more for experiences. Some locales have too many stores, and 
retailers often spur one another into frequent price cutting (and low profit margins). Customer 
service expectations are high at a time when more retailers offer self-service, automated systems, 
and omnichannel ordering and pick-up services. Although online E-commerce accounts for only 
7.1 percent of U.S. retail sales, today it is growing at a faster rate and displacing sales revenues at 
stores. Some retailers are still grappling with their omnichannel strategy in terms of capital and 
human resource investments for in-store versus digital formats; coordinating merchandising, pric-
ing, and logistics across channels; and the relative emphasis to place on image enhancement, cus-
tomer information and feedback, and sales transactions. The widespread proliferation of mobile 
and social media technologies has been difficult for many retailers to adapt to in their strategies 
all over the world. These are among the key issues that retailers must resolve:
How can we better serve our customers while earning a fair profit?
How can we stand out in a highly competitive environment where consumers have so many 
choices?
How can we better coordinate our merchandising, pricing, and service strategy across all our 
channels when costs, profit margins, and target segments differ across the channels?
How can we grow our business while retaining a core of loyal customers?
Retail decision makers can best address these questions by fully understanding and applying the 
basic principles of retailing in a well-structured, systematic, and focused retail strategy. That is 
the philosophy behind Retail Management: A Strategic Approach.
Can retailers flourish in today’s tough marketplace? You bet! Just look at your favorite restau-
rant, gift shop, and food store. Look at the success of retailers such as Costco, Starbucks, L Brands 
(whose major brands include Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works), and Amazon.com. What 
do they have in common? A desire to please the customer and a strong market niche. To prosper 
in the long term, they all need a strategic plan and a willingness to adapt—both central thrusts of 
this book. See Figure 1-1.
In this chapter, we look at the framework of retailing, the value of developing and applying 
a sound retail strategy, and the focus and format of the text. A special appendix at the end of this 
chapter examines the impact of the global economic environment on retailers in the United States 
and around the world.
THE FRAMEWORK OF RETAILING
To appreciate the role of retailing and the range of retailing activities, let’s view it from three 
perspectives:
1.	 Suppose we manage a manufacturing firm that makes cosmetics. How should we sell these 
items? We could distribute via big chains such as Sephora or small neighborhood stores, 
have our own sales force visit people in their homes as Mary Kay does, or set up our own 
Visit Amazon.com’s Web 
site (www.amazon.com) 
and see what drives one of 
the world’s “hot” retailers.

stores (if we have the ability and resources to do so). We could sponsor TV infomercials or 
magazine ads, complete with a toll-free phone number.
2.	 Suppose we have an idea for a new way to teach first-graders how to use computer software 
for spelling and vocabulary. How should we implement this idea? We could lease a store in 
a strip shopping center and run ads in a local paper, rent space in a local YMCA and rely on 
teacher referrals, or do mailings to parents and visit children in their homes. In each case, 
the service is offered “live.” But there is another option: We could use an animated Web site 
to teach children online.
3.	 Suppose that we, as consumers, want to buy apparel. What choices do we have? We could 
go to a department store or an apparel store. We could shop with a full-service retailer or a 
discount store. We could go to a shopping center or order from a catalog. We could patronize 
retailers that carry a wide range of clothing (from outerwear to jeans to suits) or firms that 
specialize in one clothing category (such as leather coats). We could surf the Web and visit 
retailers around the globe. We could also look at Facebook and see what other consumers are 
saying about various retailers.
There is a tendency to think of retailing as primarily involving the sale of tangible (physical) 
goods. However, retailing also includes the sale of services and digital goods. And this is a big 
part of retailing! A service may be the shopper’s primary purchase (such as a haircut) or it may 
be part of the shopper’s purchase of a good (such as furniture delivery). Sales in many physical 
goods—product categories such as books, movies, and music—are now dominated by their digi-
tal applications in the format of downloads. Obviously, retailing does not have to involve a store. 
Mail and phone orders, direct selling to consumers in their homes and offices, Web ­transactions, 
kiosks, and vending machine sales all fall within the scope of retailing. In fact, retailing does 
not even have to include a “retailer.” Manufacturers, importers, nonprofit firms, wholesalers, 
and individual artisans on online platforms, such as Etsy.com, act as retailers when they sell to 
final consumers.
Let’s now examine various reasons for studying retailing and its special characteristics.

Reasons for Studying Retailing
Retailing is an important field to study because of its impact on the economy, its functions in dis-
tribution, and its relationship with firms selling goods and services to retailers for their resale or 
use. These factors are discussed next. A fourth factor for students of retailing is the broad range of 
career opportunities, as highlighted with a “Careers in Retailing” box in each chapter, Appendix A 
at the end of this book, and our blog (www.bermanevansretail.com). See Figure 1-2.
THE IMPACT OF RETAILING ON THE ECONOMY  Retailing is a major part of U.S. and world com-
merce. Retail sales and employment are vital economic contributors, and retail trends often mirror 
trends in a nation’s overall economy.
According to the Department of Commerce, annual U.S. retail store sales in 2015 were 
$4.785 trillion—representing one-third of the total economy. During that year, more than one-fifth 
of the world’s retail sales occurred in the United States.2 The weighted-average share of retail 
E-commerce in overall U.S. retail sales has been steadily growing from 3.4 percent in 2007 to 
7.1 percent in 2015.3 Share of online retail sales is slightly higher in Europe at 7.5 percent and 
highest in the Asia-Pacific region at 10.2 percent. Telephone and mail-order sales by nonstore 
retailers, vending machines, and direct selling generate hundreds of billions of dollars in additional 
yearly revenues. Personal expenditures on financial, medical, legal, educational, and other services 
account for another several hundred billion dollars in annual retail revenues.
Durable goods stores—including motor vehicles and parts dealers; furniture, home furnish-
ings, electronics and appliance stores; and building materials and hardware stores—make up 
30 percent of U.S. retail store sales. Nondurable goods and services stores—including general 
merchandise stores; food and beverage stores; health- and personal-care stores; gasoline sta-
tions; clothing and accessories stores; sporting goods, hobby, book, and music stores; eating 
and drinking places; and miscellaneous retailers—together account for 70 percent of U.S. retail 
store sales.
The world’s 250 largest retailers generate more than $4.6 trillion in annual revenues. They 
represent 29 nations. Seventy-six of the largest 250 retailers are based in the United States, 28 
in Japan, 17 in Germany, 16 in Great Britain, and 15 in France. Five of the 250 top retailers are 
nonstore retailers.4 The 10 largest retailers in the United States generate nearly one trillion dol-
lars in annual domestic revenues and more than 1.2 trillion dollars in total worldwide sales. They 
operate over 32,000 U.S. stores. See Table 1-1. Visit our blog (www.bermanevansretail.com) for 
additional information on retailing.
Retailing is a major source of jobs. In the United States alone, 15 million people—about one-
tenth of the total labor force—work for traditional retailers (including food and beverage service 
firms, such as restaurants). Yet this figure understates the true number of people who work in 
retailing because it does not include the several million persons employed by other service firms, 
seasonal employees, proprietors, and unreported workers in family businesses or partnerships.
FIGURE 1-2
Encouraging People 
to Consider a Career 
in Retailing
To attract and retain 
high-quality, motivated 
workers, retailers should 
properly train them, 
empower them to be 
responsive to reasonable 
requests that may “break 
the rules” (without always 
having to ask the boss), 
and reward—and visibly 
recognize—superior 
performance. A key aspect 
of a meaningful reward 
system is an employee’s 
opportunities for upward 
mobility in terms of a 
better job and a bigger 
paycheck (promoting 
from within).

Part 1  •  an overview of strategic retail management
Retailing is the largest private-sector employer in the United States. According to the National 
Retail Federation, anyone whose employment results in a consumer product—from those who 
supply raw materials to manufacturers to truck drivers who deliver goods—counts on retail for 
their livelihood. With 35 million stores and the vast number of suppliers, the retail industry is 
responsible for 42 million jobs, and $1.6 trillion in labor income, and it accounts for $2.6 trillion 
of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).5
From a cost perspective, retailing is a significant field of study. In the United States in 2015, 
on average, 36 cents of every dollar spent in department stores, 47 cents spent in women’s apparel 
stores, and 28 cents spent in pharmacies and drugstores go to the retailers to cover operating costs, 
activities performed, and profits. Costs include rent, displays, wages, ads, and maintenance. Only a 
small part of each dollar is profit. Profit margins in the retail sector vary. Whereas audio/video and 
consumer electronics stores have pre-tax profit margins of 4.2 percent, the pre-tax profit margins 
averaged 2.1 percent for department stores in 2015.6 In its fiscal year ending January 31, 2016, 
Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, had after-tax profits of 3.1 percent of sales.7 Figure 1-3 shows 
costs and profits for Walgreens Boots Alliance, an international drugstore chain.

Two opposing human resources strategies in retailing are (1) 
limiting promotions to only those working within the firm ver-
sus (2) recruiting personnel from competing companies. The 
­promote-from-within strategy reduces employee turnover, 
encourages employee loyalty, and develops specific career paths 
for current employees. It also minimizes the difficulty in training 
new employees on company policies.
The hire-from-outside strategy seeks the best person for the 
position regardless of employment history with the given retailer. 
This strategy encourages firms to adopt new ways of thinking 
and enables a retailer to attract personnel with skills and contacts 
developed at their prior firms.
Under what conditions should a retailer use the hire-from-
outside strategy? How can a retailer using this strategy reduce 
the poor morale from existing staff?

RETAIL FUNCTIONS IN DISTRIBUTION  Retailing is the last stage in a channel of distribution—all 
the businesses and people involved in the physical movement and transfer of ownership of goods 
and services from producer to consumer. A typical distribution channel is shown in Figure 1-4. 
Retailers often act as the contact between manufacturers, wholesalers, and the consumer. Many 
manufacturers would like to make one basic type of item and sell their entire inventory to as few 
buyers as possible, but consumers usually want to choose from a variety of goods and services 
and purchase a limited quantity. Retailers collect an assortment from various sources, buy in large 
quantity, and sell in small amounts. This is the sorting process. See Figure 1-5.
Another job for retailers is communicating both with customers and with manufacturers and 
wholesalers. Shoppers learn about the availability and characteristics of goods and services, store 
hours, sales, and so on from retailer ads, salespeople, and displays. Manufacturers and wholesalers 
are informed by their retailers with regard to sales forecasts, delivery delays, customer complaints, 
defective items, inventory turnover, and more. Many goods and services have been modified due 
to retailer feedback.
For small suppliers, retailers can provide assistance by transporting, storing, marking, adver-
tising, and pre-paying for products. Small retailers may need the same type of help from their 
suppliers. The tasks performed by retailers affect the percentage of each sales dollar they need to 
cover costs and profits.
Retailers also complete transactions with customers. This means having convenient loca-
tions, filling orders promptly and accurately, and processing credit purchases. Some retailers also 
provide customer services such as gift wrapping, delivery, and installation. To make themselves 
even more appealing, many firms now engage in omnichannel retailing, whereby a retailer sells 
to consumers through multiple retail formats (points of contact). Most large retailers operate both 
physical stores and Web sites to make shopping easier and to accommodate consumer desires. 
Some firms provide information and sell to customers through multiple touch points: retail stores, 
mail order, Web sites, tablets, smartphones, and a toll-free phone number. See Figure 1-6.
For these reasons, products are usually sold through retailers not owned by manufacturers 
(wholesalers). This lets the manufacturers reach more customers, reduce costs, improve cash 
flow, increase sales more rapidly, and focus on their area of expertise. Select manufacturers, such 
Sherwin-Williams (www 
.sherwin-williams.com) is 
not only a manufacturer but 
also a retailer.

as Sherwin-Williams, Coach, and Nike, operate retail facilities (besides selling at independent 
retailers). In running their stores, these firms complete the full range of retailing functions and 
compete with conventional retailers.
THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG RETAILERS AND THEIR SUPPLIERS  Relationships among retailers and 
suppliers can be complex. Because retailers are part of a distribution channel, manufacturers 
and wholesalers must be concerned about the caliber of displays, customer service, store hours, and 
retailers’ reliability as business partners. Retailers are also major customers of goods and services for 
resale, store fixtures, computers, management consulting, and insurance.
These are some issues over which retailers and their suppliers have different priorities: control 
over the distribution channel, profit allocation, the number of competing retailers handling suppli-
ers’ products, product displays, promotion support, payment terms, and operating flexibility. Due 
to the growth of large chains, retailers have more power than ever. Unless suppliers know retailer 
needs, they cannot have good rapport with them; so long as retailers have a choice of suppliers, 
they will choose those offering more.

CHAPTER 1  •  An Introduction to Retailing

Channel relations tend to be smoothest with exclusive distribution, whereby suppliers make 
agreements with one or a few retailers that designate the latter as the only ones in specified geo-
graphic areas to carry certain brands or products. This stimulates both parties to work together to 
maintain an image, assign shelf space, allot profits and costs, and advertise. It also usually requires 
that retailers limit their brand selection in the specified product lines; they might have to decline 
to handle other suppliers’ brands. From the manufacturers’ perspective, exclusive distribution may 
limit their long-run total sales.
Channel relations tend to be most volatile with intensive distribution, whereby suppliers sell 
through as many retailers as possible. This often maximizes suppliers’ sales and lets retailers offer 
many brands and product versions. Competition among retailers selling the same items is high; 
retailers may use tactics not beneficial to individual suppliers, because they are more concerned 
about their own results. Retailers may assign little space to specific brands, set very high prices 
on them, and not advertise them.
With selective distribution, suppliers sell through a moderate number of retailers. This com-
bines aspects of exclusive and intensive distribution. Suppliers have higher sales than in exclusive 
distribution, and retailers carry some competing brands. It encourages suppliers to provide some 
marketing support and retailers to give adequate shelf space. See Figure 1-7.
The Special Characteristics of Retailing
Three factors that most differentiate retailing from other types of business are noted in Figure 1-8 
and discussed here. Each factor imposes unique requirements on retail firms.
The average amount of a sales transaction for retailers is much less than for manufacturers. 
The average sales per customer transaction in retailing is low. The average supermarket transaction 
is about $30.00.8 In comparison, Home Depot’s average sales transaction in 2015 was $58.55.9 
The average sales transaction per shopping trip is well under $100 for department stores and 
specialty stores. This low amount creates a need to tightly control the costs associated with each 
transaction (such as credit verification, sales personnel, and bagging); to maximize the number of 
customers drawn to the retailer, which may place more emphasis on ads and special promotions; 
and to increase impulse sales by more aggressive selling. However, cost control can be tough. For 
instance, inventory management is often expensive due to the many small transactions to a large 
number of customers. A typical supermarket has several thousand customer transactions per week, 
which makes it harder to find the proper in-stock level and product selection. Thus, retailers are 
expanding their use of computerized inventory systems.

Part 1  •  an overview of strategic retail management
Final consumers make many unplanned or impulse purchases. Surveys show that a large 
percentage of consumers do not look at ads before shopping, do not prepare shopping lists (or do 
deviate from the lists once in stores), and make fully unplanned purchases. This behavior indicates 
the value of in-store displays, attractive store layouts, and well-organized stores, catalogs, and Web 
sites. Candy, cosmetics, snack foods, magazines, and other items are sold as impulse goods when 
placed in visible, high-traffic areas in a store, catalog, or Web site. Because so many purchases 
are unplanned, the retailer’s ability to forecast, budget, order merchandise, and have sufficient 
personnel on the selling floor is more difficult.
Despite the inroads made by nonstore retailers, most retail transactions (more than 90 percent) 
are still conducted in stores—and will continue to be in the future. Many people like to shop in 
person; want to touch, smell, and/or try on products; enjoy browsing for unplanned purchases; 
feel more comfortable taking a purchase home with them than waiting for a delivery; and desire 
privacy while at home. This store-based shopping orientation has implications for retailers; they 
must work to attract shoppers to stores and consider such factors as store location, transportation, 
store hours, proximity of competitors, product selection, parking, and ads.
THE IMPORTANCE OF DEVELOPING AND APPLYING  
A RETAIL STRATEGY
A retail strategy is the overall plan guiding a retail firm. It influences the firm’s business activities 
and its response to market forces, such as competition and the economy. Any retailer, regardless 
of size or type, should utilize these six steps in strategic planning:
1.	 Define the type of business in terms of the goods or service category and the company’s 
specific orientation (such as full service or “no frills”).
2.	 Set long-run and short-run objectives for sales and profit, market share, image, and so on.

Macy’s (www.macys

UK-based Debenhams has 248 department stores in 28 coun-
tries. It is actively looking to expand its overseas business to 
around 30 percent of its total business. It is achieving this 
through a combination of franchise expansion, enhanced 
­distribution, and online sales. Debenhams opened its largest 
global franchise store in Abu Dhabi and its largest-ever store in

3.	 Determine the customer market to target on the basis of its characteristics (such as gender 
and income level) and needs (such as product and brand preferences).
4.	 Devise an overall, long-run plan that gives general direction to the firm and its employees.
5.	 Implement an integrated strategy that combines such factors as store location, product assort-
ment, pricing, and advertising and displays to achieve objectives.
6.	 Regularly evaluate performance and correct weaknesses or problems when observed.
To illustrate these points, the background and strategy of the Home Depot Corporation—one of 
the world’s foremost retailers—are presented. Then the retailing concept is explained and applied.
The Home Depot Corporation: Successfully Navigating the Omnichannel Landscape10
COMPANY BACKGROUND  Home Depot is the world’s largest home improvement retail chain 
and the ninth largest retailer globally in terms of revenues. It was established in 1978 by Bernie 
Marcus (a pharmacist by training), Arthur Blank (educated as an accountant), Ken Langone (an 
investment banker), and Pat Farrah (who had a merchandising background). The first two Home 
Depot stores opened on June 22, 1979, in Atlanta, Georgia, with the vision of “one-stop shopping 
for the do-it-yourselfer.” Today, Home Depot operates nearly 2,275 stores with over 370,000 
employees in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, and Guam—as 
well as an online business.
Home Depot targets the do-it-yourself (DIY) and professional contractor markets with its 
selection of 40,000 to 600,000 SKUs (stock-keeping units, or machine-readable barcodes), includ-
ing lumber, flooring, plumbing supplies, garden products, tools, paint, and appliances. Home Depot 
also offers installation services for carpeting, cabinetry, and other products. The Home Depot went 
public in 1981, experienced tremendous growth in the 1980s and 1990s, and celebrated the opening 
of its 100th store in 1989. One-third of Home Depot’s total sales in FY 2016 came from California, 
Florida, New York, and Texas.
Home Depot seeks to provide excellent customer service through consistent high-quality 
products, customer service, and competitive pricing. Accordingly, every customer has a bill of 
rights at Home Depot, and this entitles the customer to the right assortment, quantities, and prices, 
along with trained associates on the sales floor who want to take care of customers. Home Depot’s 
vision is driven by a set of eight core values: excellent customer service, building strong relation-
ships, taking care of its employees, giving back, doing the “right” thing, creating shareholder 
value, respecting all people, and exhibiting entrepreneurial spirit.
The Home Depot Corporation’s Strategy: Keys to Success  Throughout its existence, 
Home Depot has adhered to a consistent, far-sighted, customer-oriented strategy—one that has 
paved the way for its long-term achievements.
GROWTH STRATEGY  Home Depot’s current strategy of product authority (continually analyzing 
customer data to better understand consumer preferences), providing a seamless and friction-free 
experience no matter where customers shop, and investing to build a best-in-class supply chain 
network support its dominant position in its industry. Disciplined capital allocation, continuous 
optimization of productivity, and efficient operations allow Home Depot to lower its operating 
costs and increase shareholder wealth.
Although the company operates in markets that are highly competitive in terms of customer 
service, store location, price, and quality, Home Depot has the resources to compete on the basis 
of price, service, and product variety. Competitors include major chains such as Lowe’s, Menard, 
True Value, Ace Hardware, and numerous local retailers. It also faces competition from pure-
online retailers—for example, Amazon—as it moves into adjacent product categories in its quest 
for growth.
TARGETED APPEAL TO MULTIPLE SEGMENTS  Home Depot serves three major market segments:
1.	 Do-it-yourself customers are mostly homeowners and end-users who purchase products to 
complete their projects and repairs by themselves.
2.	 Do-it-for-me customers are homeowners who purchase their products and hire a third party to 
complete their repairs and projects. To these customers, Home Depot is able to offer installa-
tion programs and design services on carpets, countertops, home appliances, and many others.
See the target marketing 
approach of Home Depot 
(www.homedepot.com).

3.	 Professional customers are general contractors, repair people, and small business owners. 
To these customers, Home Depot offers value-added services such as dedicated staff, des-
ignated parking, and bulk pricing. This segment accounts for one-third of sales revenues 
and represents a more recurring and larger sales opportunity compared to the first two retail 
customer segments.
DISTINCTIVE COMPANY IMAGE  Home Depot communicates its vision and image as a one-stop 
shopping experience for the do-it-yourselfer through the extensive width and depth of its product 
portfolio and its store size. Its first stores in Atlanta, Georgia, at around 60,000 square feet each, 
were cavernous warehouses that dwarfed the competition and stocked 25,000 SKUs (much more 
than the average hardware store at that time). Empty boxes piled high on the shelves gave the 
illusion of even more depth in inventory. Although Home Depot still leverages its store size as 
a competitive advantage, it is losing its importance in the omnichannel marketplace. Stores of 
various sizes are continuously redesigned to allow customers to interact more with products and 
to allow the chain to more efficiently stock products.
“Big Orange” is the nickname by which Home Depot is known all over the world. The bright 
orange logo was inspired by crates used to transport freight, keeping in line with the “depot” 
theme. Stamped at an upright angle to symbolize success and in bright orange to help simulate 
activity, the logo appears on signs, equipment, and employee aprons. The Home Depot introduced 
the slogan “More saving. More doing” in the March 18, 2009, circular, replacing “You can do it. 
We can help” which had been used since 2003. Another slogan used in the past 25 years is “The 
Home Depot, Low prices are just the beginning” in the early 1990s. The company advertises 
through TV, flyers, radio, online, and social and mobile media.
STRONG CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR ITS RETAIL CATEGORY  Home Depot’s philosophy of customer 
service—“whatever it takes”—means cultivating a relationship with customers rather than merely 
completing a transaction. The founders define themselves to be “in the people business.” From 
the start, associates offered excellent customer service, guiding customers through projects. After 
undergoing rigorous product knowledge training, store associates began offering clinics so cus-
tomers could learn how to do it themselves. The Home Depot revolutionized the home improve-
ment industry by bringing the know-how and the tools to the consumer, thus empowering them 
and saving them money.
MULTIPLE POINTS OF CONTACT  Home Depot reaches its customers through extensive advertis-
ing, stores in 49 states, a toll-free telephone service center (open 7 days a week, 17 hours a day), 
a Web site, and the use of Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and other social-media sites. 
The retailer has applied the same customer service philosophy to its multichannel initiatives. The 
E-commerce channel is an increasingly vital sales driver for Home Depot, accounting for nearly 
7.2 percent of overall sales revenues. Despite the many advantages of Web-only sales, Home 
Depot was early in recognizing that brick-and-mortar stores play a vital role in driving conver-
sion rates. Stores often double as fulfillment centers. About 40 percent of Web site (homedepot 
.com) orders are fulfilled through its stores. Millions of deliveries are made from stores each year.
Three multichannel programs enable Home Depot to effectively leverage its store network: 
buy online, ship to store (BOSS); buy online, pick up in store (BOPIS); and buy online, return in 
store (BORIS). These omnichannel initiatives enable quicker order pickups and returns, reduce 
customer time, and save on storage and costs. Its fastest growing E-commerce channel is BOPIS. 
E-commerce sales also have a higher average ticket size than the average $55 to $65 in-store pur-
chases, and a higher percentage of BOPIS sales also tends to improve store productivity metrics. 
Orders placed online and delivered to a purchaser’s home have the largest average ticket size 
because these orders typically consist of bulkier items that cannot be picked up in the store and 
are far more costly than smaller items typically purchased in a store.
EMPLOYEE RELATIONS  Home Depot employed 385,000 associates as of the beginning of 2016. 
Employees are expected to share the same vision as Home Depot. Employees are provided with 
many in-house workshops, such as “customers-first” training program and company-sponsored 
programs, to give associates a better understanding of their products and services. Home Depot 
believes its employees are satisfied with the compensation and offers employees the opportunity 
to purchase stock options at a discounted price. Employees are also eligible for medical, dental, 
vision, and life insurance—depending on their status and tenure at the company.

 
CHAPTER 1  •  An Introduction to Retailing	
33	
INNOVATION  The home improvement industry experiences continuous innovation. Home Depot 
introduces new products and services, such as 3D printing, thus allowing it to adapt to the change 
in equipment and consumer preferences. Home Depot’s focus on solving customer problems has 
been a source of innovation and strategic movement into adjacent markets for services by provid-
ing design and installation services for its products as well as third-party resellers, equipment 
rental (e.g., carpet cleaning, small trucks to transport equipment), and home inspection products 
(water, air quality and radiation).
Home Depot collaborates with new and existing manufacturers to enable it to be a one-
stop-shopping destination for home improvement products. It recently broadened the number of 
brands it offers in its appliances department by including Whirlpool, Frigidaire, and Electrolux. 
Additionally, it also introduced innovative new products to its DIY and professional customers 
in most of its departments.
COMMITMENT TO TECHNOLOGY  Home Depot has consistently invested in backend, as well as 
customer-interactive, technologies. It currently operates 18 remote distribution centers in the 
United States, and 33 bulk distribution centers within the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The 
company continuously updates its distribution centers through building logistic competencies and 
improving its inventory management system. Over the past few years, Home Depot has centralized 
its inventory planning and implemented new forecasting technology. Currently, 91 percent of its 
U.S. store products are ordered through a central replenishment system and it hopes to increase 
the number in the coming years.
Home Depot is successfully implementing three multiyear internal initiatives: (1) ­ProjectSync—a 
major supply chain synchronization to reduce average lead time from supplier to shelf; (2) COM—
Home Depot’s order management platform, which provides greater visibility into and improved 
execution of special orders for a more seamless and friction-free experience for customers; and 
(3) FIRST phones—in-store mobile enablement for inventory management, product look-up, 
and business analytics. It even offers line-busting features to speed up checkout for associates  
and customers.
COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT  Home Depot believes in creating shareholder value while being 
responsible and balancing the needs of its communities. Through The Home Depot Foundation, 
community impact grants, and associates’ volunteer time, the retailer strives to have a positive 
impact on communities in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It invites community partici-
pation in practical and educational programs in stores that benefit children and adults. The com-
mitment to environmental sustainability is demonstrated through its sale of energy-efficient and 
sustainable products, recycling practices, and business principles. Home Depot promotes an envi-
ronmentally friendly atmosphere by protecting its employees’ health and safety requirements. It 
has also created a supplier social responsibility program intended to ensure that suppliers observe 
a high standard of social responsibility.
ADAPTATION TO A GLOBAL, OMNICHANNEL WORLD  Due to the difficult economic, political, and 
social conditions in recent years, even outstanding retailers, such as Home Depot, have been 
affected. In 2012, Home Depot closed all seven of its stores in China.
The company outsources some of its products from third-party manufacturers in third-world 
countries with unstable political environments. It may be exposed to trade embargos, increases in 
tariff rates, different tax regulations, and double taxation by the countries that do not have respec-
tive treaties in place to avoid double taxes. Yet, many governments in these countries may have 
incentive programs applicable for Home Depot as an employer of local labor.
Home Depot has capitalized on the digitization in retailing by enabling a secure multichannel 
shopping experience—mobile, in-store, at home, or even on the job site. Its global sales revenues 
have grown substantially to almost $89 billion in fiscal 2016, and its operating income increased by 
12 percent from the prior year to reach $11.8 billion. Home Depot’s performance was boosted by the 
demand for home improvement products, a better housing market, and rising consumer employment.
Growth in the number of big-ticket transactions boosted sales. The company’s multiyear 
productivity enhancement plan also provided some profitability upside. The Home Depot has been 
one of the best-performing stocks in the consumer discretionary sector and the Dow Jones Indus-
trial Average over the past five years. The stock returned an annualized average of 28.5 percent—
almost three times that provided by the S&P 500 Index’s 9.6 percent over the same period.

34 
Part 1  •  an overview of strategic retail management
Although the strong U.S. dollar affected Home Depot’s sales growth in the Canadian and 
Mexican markets, they account for 10 percent of overall sales and are less significant. CEO Craig 
Menear has ambitious goals for FY 2018; his target is $101 billion in sales, with a 14.5 percent 
operating margin and a 35 percent return on invested capital. In 2015, Home Depot acquired Inter-
line Brands, whose product portfolio of home repair and maintenance products is complementary 
to Home Depot’s offerings in home remodeling products and is largely viewed as a good strate-
gic fit. Home Depot expects additional revenue from existing customers’ purchase of repair and 
maintenance products, which are recurring purchases, and a sales upside from Interline Brands’ 
customer base, which will get a tremendous boost from Home Depot’s E-commerce capabilities.
The Retailing Concept
As just described, Home Depot has a sincere long-term desire to please customers. It uses a 
customer-centered, chainwide approach to strategy development and implementation, is value-
driven, and has clear goals. Together, these four principles form the retailing concept (depicted 
in Figure 1-9), which should be understood and applied by all retailers:
1.	 Customer orientation.  The retailer determines the attributes and needs of its customers and 
endeavors to satisfy these needs to the fullest.
2.	 Coordinated effort.  The retailer integrates all plans and activities to maximize efficiency.
3.	 Value driven.  The retailer offers good value to customers, whether it be upscale or discount. 
This means having prices appropriate for the level of products and customer service.
4.	 Goal orientation.  The retailer sets goals and then uses its strategy to attain them.
Unfortunately, this concept is not grasped by every retailer. Some are indifferent to customer 
needs, plan haphazardly, have prices that do not reflect the value offered, and have unclear goals. 
Some are not receptive to change, or they blindly follow strategies enacted by competitors. Some 
do not get feedback from customers; they rely on supplier reports or their own past sales trends.

Suppose a large supermarket chain is revising its approach 
regarding environmental sustainability. Hallmarks of the new 
strategy are to encourage customers to purchase reusable 
plastic shopping bags (available at cost at all registers); to use 
high-efficiency lighting, heating, and air-conditioning systems; 
and to reformulate its private-label products to have minimal 
negative environmental impact (such as selling grains and nuts 
via bins instead of prepackaged bottles). The chain plans to 
heavily promote this strategy via in-store displays, through its 
Web site, and in its freestanding inserts that are distributed by 
local newspapers.
Aside from the positive societal impact, the store sees sev-
eral advantages to this strategy. One, it will appeal to shoppers 
concerned with environmental responsibility. Two, this environ-
mental strategy can position the store favorably with respect to 
competition. And three, the societal strategy is an excellent way 
to reposition its private-label products versus national brands.
Discuss additional pros and cons of this strategy.
ETHICS IN RETAILING
Environmental Sustainability

 
CHAPTER 1  •  An Introduction to Retailing	
35	
The retailing concept is straightforward. It means communicating with shoppers and view-
ing their desires as critical to the firm’s success; having a consistent strategy (such as offering 
designer brands, plentiful sales personnel, attractive displays, and above-average prices in an 
upscale store); offering prices perceived as “fair” (a good value for the money) by customers; and 
working to achieve meaningful, specific, and reachable goals. However, the retailing concept is 
only a strategic guide. It does not deal with a firm’s internal capabilities or competitive advantages 
but offers a broad planning framework.
Let’s look at three issues that relate to a retailer’s performance in terms of the retailing con-
cept: the total retail experience, customer service, and relationship retailing.
THE TOTAL RETAIL EXPERIENCE  The rapid adoption of E-commerce and the proliferation of smart 
mobile devices makes it seem possible to purchase anything, anytime, and have it delivered 
anywhere. Such thinking has fundamentally changed consumers’ shopping habits and expecta-
tions. Almost every customer encounters a total retail experience in his or her retail journey. 
Imagine using a mobile app to purchase a refrigerator while attending a ball game. By the time 
you get home, the refrigerator has been scheduled for delivery. Everything, from the activation 
of the mobile app to receiving the purchase at home, plays a role in the customer’s total retail 
experience.
Most retailers are aware that price has been, and always will be, a key motivator in shopping 
behavior. It is important for retailers to remember, however, that they must provide an appropriate 
customer experience at every touchpoint with the customer to sustain her or his continued loyalty. 
More than ever, shopping is about how to “engage” the customer and how the shopping experience 
makes the customer feel. It is also about driving customer engagement in new and different ways 
to deliver relevant experiences that customers can share with others on social media. The shift in 
consumer expectations is compelling retailers to look at aspects of “who” as opposed to “what” 
they want to be—the competition is now for share of lifetime spending, as opposed to share of 
wallet.11 Retailers with genuine character and interest in listening to and solving their customers’ 
needs, core values, and concern for community are likely to profit the most.
The total retail experience includes all the elements in a retail offering that encourage or 
inhibit consumers during their contact or journey with a retailer. See Figure 1-10. Many ele-
ments, such as the number of salespeople, displays, prices, brand names, mobile app or Web 
page design, accurate product and pricing information, and inventory on hand, are controllable 
by a retailer. Others, such as the adequacy of parking, the speed of a consumer’s Internet con-
nection, and sales taxes, are not. If some part of the total retail experience is unsatisfactory,

Part 1  •  an overview of strategic retail management
consumers may be “turned off” and not make a purchase—they may even decide not to patron-
ize a retailer again if they attribute the failure to be controllable by the retailer. Given the 
widespread use of mobile devices in-store and the propensity to share information, one bad 
retail experience can be quickly shared with many other current and potential consumers via 
social media.
In planning its strategy, a retailer must be sure that all strategic elements are in place. For the 
shopper segment to which it appeals, the total retail experience must be aimed at fulfilling that 
segment’s expectations. A discounter should have ample stock on hand when it runs sales but not 
plush carpeting; a full-service store should have superior personnel but not personnel who are 
perceived as haughty by customers. Various retailers have not learned this lesson, which is why 
some theme restaurants are in trouble. The novelty has worn off, and many people believe the 
food is only fair while prices are high.
A big challenge for retailers is generating customer “excitement” because many people 
are bored with shopping or have little time for it. For example, Build-A-Bear Workshop is the 
­leading and only global company that offers an interactive make-your-own stuffed animal retail-­
entertainment experience. The company currently operates more than 400 Build-A-Bear Workshop 
stores worldwide, including company-owned stores in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada, 
Great Britain, and Ireland, and franchise stores in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, Mexico, and 
the Middle East.
Since 2007, the interactive experience has been enhanced—all the way to CyBEAR® space—
with the launch of Bearville.com, its entertainment destination and virtual world. In September 
2015, Build-A-Bear Workshop launched a new store format and brand refresh as a “multigenera-
tional” brand for millennial parents who first engaged with Build-A-Bear Workshop when they 
were children.
Guests who visit a Build-A-Bear Workshop store still enter a recognizable and distinctive 
teddy-bear–themed environment consisting of eight stuffed animal-making stations: Choose Me, 
Hear Me, Stuff Me, Stitch Me, Fluff Me, Dress Me, Name Me, and Take Me Home. Store associ-
ates, known as Master Bear Builder associates, can share the experience with guests at each phase 
of the bear-making process or they can do it for the guests.12 In addition, guests can enjoy the 
brand’s “play beyond the plush” with entertainment offerings such as the Bearville Alive YouTube 
channel, which features original video content and the launch of mobile apps tied to complemen-
tary products (an enterprise-selling solution), and creates the memories with their friends and 
family that they can share through social media.13
CUSTOMER SERVICE  Customer service refers to the identifiable, but sometimes intangible, activi-
ties undertaken by a retailer in conjunction with the basic goods and services it sells. It has a strong 
impact on the total retail experience. Among the factors comprising a customer service strategy are 
store hours, parking, shopper-friendly store layout, credit acceptance, helpful salespeople, ameni-
ties such as gift wrapping, clean restrooms, reasonable delivery policies, the time shoppers spend 
in checkout lines, and customer follow-up. This list is not all-inclusive, and it differs in terms of 
the retail strategy undertaken. Customer service is discussed further in Chapter 2.
Satisfaction with customer service is affected by expectations (based on the type of retailer) 
and past experience. People’s assessment of customer service depends on their perceptions—not 
necessarily reality; different people may evaluate the same service quite differently. The same 
person may even rate a firm’s customer service differently over time due to its intangibility, 
although the service stays constant. Interestingly, despite a desire to provide excellent customer 
service, a number of outstanding retailers now wonder if “the customer is always right.” Are 
there limits?
RELATIONSHIP RETAILING  The best retailers know it is in their interest to engage in relationship 
retailing, whereby they seek to establish and maintain long-term bonds with customers, rather 
than act as if each sales transaction is a completely new encounter. This means concentrating on 
the total retail experience, monitoring satisfaction with customer service, and staying in touch 
with customers. Figure 1-11 shows a customer respect checklist that retailers could use to assess 
their relationship efforts.
To be effective in relationship retailing, a firm should keep two points in mind. First, it is 
harder to lure new customers than to make existing ones happy; a “win–win” approach is critical. 
For a retailer to “win” in the long run (attract shoppers, make sales, earn profits), the customer

even offers a great online 
shopping experience.

A Customer Respect 
Checklist
When interacting with customers, do employees always say “How may I help you,”
“Please,” and “Thank you”?
Are employees properly trained to service the retailer’s customers?
Do employees listen carefully when customers state their preferences and not push
goods and services that are beyond the shoppers’ interest or budget?
Are employees patient and not condescending when talking to customers?
Is the customer’s time valued?
Do the hours that the retailer is open correspond with the hours sought by customers?
Do the retailer and its employees honor all promises that are made to customers—and
strive not to mislead shoppers?
Do employees avoid being confrontational with customers if the latter make a complaint
about merchandise or service?
Are customer phone calls, E-mails, and other contacts with the retailer directed to the
right employees and handled promptly?
For a retailer that operates both store and online businesses, are policies clearly
stated and distinctions between the two formats with regard to purchase,
shipping, and return policies noted in the store and online?
Does the retailer monitor online customer reviews and social media discussions and work
to resolve any problems that are noted there?
Does the retailer treat every customer respectfully, regardless of age, gender, race,
ethnicity, and other factors?
Does the retailer recognize and reward its most loyal customers?
Does the retailer’s employee review process include how well the employees are rated
by customers?
must also “win” in the short run (receive good value, be treated with respect, feel welcome by the 
firm). Otherwise, that retailer loses (shoppers patronize competitors) and those customers lose 
(by spending time and money to learn about other retailers). Second, due to advances in computer 
technology, it is now much easier to develop a customer database with information on people’s 
attributes and past shopping behavior. Ongoing customer contact can be better, more frequent, 
and more focused. This topic is covered further in Chapter 2.
Newer technologies such as GPS navigation, Global System for 
Mobiles (GSM), Bluetooth, and RFID tracking now enable retailers 
to track the exact location of a customer. “Geofencing” technol-
ogy works outside the store, whereas “iBeacons” allow retailers 
to target a customer within a store.
The various advantages to a retailer that uses these technolo-
gies are plentiful. From a promotional perspective, a retailer can 
send a mobile coupon valid for three hours to a lapsed customer 
who had not purchased an item within 30 days. With iBeacons, 
customers receive targeted information based on their aisle posi-
tion in a store. Thus, a shopper could receive a mobile coupon 
for a cereal brand when in the cereal aisle. Unlike traditional 
coupons that must be clipped and returned; mobile coupons can 
be scanned from smartphones.

THE FOCUS AND FORMAT OF THE TEXT
There are various approaches to the study of retailing: an institutional approach, which describes 
the types of retailers and their development; a functional approach, which concentrates on the 
activities that retailers perform (such as buying, pricing, and personnel practices); and a strate-
gic approach, which centers on defining the retail business, setting objectives, appealing to an 
appropriate customer market, developing an overall plan, implementing an integrated strategy, 
and regularly reviewing operations.
We will study retailing from each perspective but will focus on a strategic approach. Our 
basic premise is that the retailer has to plan for and adapt to a complex, changing environment. 
Opportunities as well as threats must be considered. By engaging in strategic retail management, 
the retailer is encouraged to study competitors, suppliers, economic factors, consumer changes, 
marketplace trends, legal restrictions, and other issues. A firm prospers if its competitive strengths 
match the opportunities in the environment, weaknesses are eliminated or minimized, and plans 
look to the future (as well as the past). Refer to the appendix at the end of this chapter; it examines 
the impact of the current economic situation on retailers and consumers alike.
Retail Management: A Strategic Approach is divided into eight parts. The rest of Part One 
looks at building relationships and strategic planning in retailing. Part Two examines ­retailing 
institutions on the basis of their ownership; store-based strategy mix; and Web, nonstore-
based, and other nontraditional retailing formats. Part Three deals with consumer behavior and 
­information gathering in retailing. Parts Four through Seven discuss the specific elements of a 
retailing ­strategy: planning the store location; managing a retail business; planning, handling, and 
pricing merchandise; and communicating with the customer. Part Eight shows how a retailing 
strategy may be integrated, analyzed, and improved. These topics have special end-of-chapter 
­appendices: the impact of the economy (Chapter 1), service retailing (Chapter 2), global ­retailing 
(Chapter 3), franchising (Chapter 4), and multichannel retailing (Chapter 6). There is also an end-
of-text appendix on retailing careers and a glossary.
To underscore retailing’s exciting nature, four real-world boxes appear in each chapter: 
“Careers in Retailing,” “Ethics in Retailing,” “Retailing Around the World,” and “Technology in 
Retailing.”
In this and every chapter, the summary is related to the 
objectives stated at the beginning of the chapter.
1.	 To define retailing, consider it from various perspec-
tives, demonstrate its impact, and note its special char-
acteristics. Retailing comprises the business activities 
involved in selling goods and services to consumers for 
personal, family, or household use. It is the last stage in 
the distribution process. Today, retailing is at a complex 
crossroad, with many challenges ahead.
Retailing may be viewed from multiple perspectives. 
It includes tangible and intangible items, does not have 
to involve a store, and can be done by manufacturers 
and others—as well as retailers.
Annual U.S. store sales are approaching $5 trillion, 
with other forms of retailing accounting for hundreds 
of billions of dollars more. The world’s 250 largest 
retailers account for more than $4.6 trillion in yearly 
revenues. About 15 million people in the United States 
work for retailers (including food and beverage service 
firms), which understates the number of those actually 
employed in a retailing capacity. Retail firms receive up 
to 40 cents or more of every sales dollar as compensa-
tion for operating costs, the functions performed, and 
the profits earned.
Retailing encompasses all of the businesses and 
people involved in physically moving and transfer-
ring ownership of goods and services from producer to 
consumer. In a distribution channel, retailers perform 
valuable functions as the contact for manufacturers, 
wholesalers, and final consumers. They collect assort-
ments from various suppliers and offer them to custom-
ers. Retailers also communicate with both customers 
and other channel members. They may ship, store, 
mark, advertise, and pre-pay for items. In addition, they 
complete transactions with customers and often provide 
customer services. They may also offer multiple formats 
(multichannel retailing) to facilitate shopping.
Retailers and their suppliers have complex relationships

a distribution channel aimed at the final consumer, and 
they are major customers for suppliers. Channel relations 
are smoothest with exclusive distribution; they are most 
volatile with intensive distribution. Selective distribution 
is a way to balance sales goals and channel cooperation.
Retailing has several special characteristics. The aver-
age sales transaction is small, consumers make many 
unplanned purchases, and most customers visit a store 
location.
2.	 To introduce the concept of strategic planning and 
apply it. A retail strategy is the overall plan guiding the 
firm. It has six basic steps: defining the business, set-
ting objectives, defining the customer market, develop-
ing an overall plan, enacting an integrated strategy, and 
evaluating performance and making modifications. For 
example, Home Depot’s strategy has been particularly 
well designed and enacted, even though it has been 
affected by the tough economy in recent years.
3.	 To show why the retailing concept is the foundation of a 
successful business, with an emphasis on the total retail 
experience, customer service, and relationship retailing. 
The retailing concept should be understood and used by 
all retailers. It requires a firm to have a customer orienta-
tion, use a coordinated effort, and be value driven and goal 
oriented. Despite its straightforward nature, many firms do 
not adhere to one or more elements of the retailing concept.
The total retail experience consists of all elements in a 
retail offering that encourage or inhibit consumers during 
their contact with a retailer. Some elements are control-
lable by the retailer; others are not. Customer service 
includes identifiable, but sometimes intangible, activi-
ties undertaken by a retailer in association with the basic 
goods and services sold. It has an effect on the total retail 
experience. In relationship retailing, a firm seeks long-
term bonds with customers rather than acting as if each 
sales transaction is a totally new encounter with them.
4.	 To indicate the focus and format of the text. Retail-
ing may be studied by using an institutional approach, 
a functional approach, and/or a strategic approach. 
Although all three approaches are covered in this text-
book, our focus is on the strategic approach. The under-
lying principle is that a retail firm needs to plan for and 
adapt to a complex, changing environment.

Part 1  •  an overview of strategic retail management
Understanding the Recent Economic 
Environment in the United States and 
Around the Globe
In this appendix, we present a brief overview of the U.S. and global economic climate. We then 
discuss some of the strategic options that retailers are pursuing and should pursue to sustain their 
business amid the current economic conditions.
The Current Economic Situation in the United States
In 2016, the Census Bureau reported that the average U.S. family’s income was $57,243.When 
adjusted for inflation, the median income level was 1.3 percent lower than its high in January 2008, 
but well above its low in August 2011.1 Median income has climbed since the August 2011 low 
point. A significant factor in the increase in real income is low prices for energy, gasoline, and heat.
The percentage of Americans living in poverty is about 15 percent of the population as of 
2014, nearly 1 million Americans.2 Especially noteworthy has been the growing gap between the 
“best-off” and “worst-off” Americans. The Pew Research Center found that the percentage of 
adults in the highest-income groups grew from 14 percent in 1971 to 21 percent in 2015. ­During 
the same time, the percentage of households in the lowest two categories increased from 25 to 
29 percent. And middle-income households as a percentage of all households declined from 
61 ­percent to 50 percent over the same time interval.3
One widely accepted measure of income inequality is the Gini index, which ranges from 
zero (if all households have the same earnings) to 100 (when all income goes to one person). The 
U.S. Gini index is 45.0, which is in the same range as Jamaica (45.5), Peru (45.3), and Cameroon 
(44.6).4 Countries with a more equal distribution of income as shown by their Gini indices include 
Sweden (24.9), Denmark (24.8), Ukraine (24.6), and Slovenia (23.7). The distribution of wealth in 
the United States is even more unequal. An Organization for Economic Co-operation and Devel-
opment (OECD) report study found that the wealthiest 10 percent of all U.S. households account 
for 76 percent of all the wealth in the country.5
As of 2016, the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.9 percent. This rate is low, but it must be 
tempered with some additional insights. First, only 63 percent of adult Americans are in the labor 
force. This low labor force participation rate is due to large numbers of Baby Boomers who have 
retired, younger residents attending college or graduate school, and people giving up on finding 
work. Second, long-term unemployment is high, as 2.1 million U.S. residents have been unem-
ployed for over 6 months.6 And third, the 4.9 percent unemployment rate does not reflect those 
who are no longer seeking employment or those underemployed (such as being in a part-time job).
The personal savings rate, the percent of each paycheck that is not spent, was at 5.4 ­percent 
as of the end of April 2016. Because consumer spending constituted 68.5 percent of the U.S. 
economy in the fourth quarter of 2015 (up from 65.3 percent at the end of 2000), this is an 
important number to monitor.7 Historically, the savings rate has varied from 4.6 percent as of the 
end of January 2013 to 5.9 percent as of the end of March 2016. At the end of December 2012, 
the savings rate was 6.5 percent.8 The low savings rate highlights the role of the consumer as an 
important factor in economic growth.
As of May 2016, consumer confidence, measured by the University of Michigan’s Index 
of Consumer Sentiment was 94.7. There were only four months since its January 2007 peak in 
which this number was higher. One reason for the higher consumer optimism is the continuing 
anticipation of low inflation due to low interest rates.9 Better consumer confidence is generally 
associated with greater amounts of consumer spending as consumers feel good about their job 
prospects and job security.
With some exceptions, the housing market is showing signs of improvement. A 2016 study 
showed that 1 in every 122 housing units had at least one foreclosure filing (such as a default 
APPENDIX

notice, scheduled auction, or bank repossession) in 2015. This was the second year in a row 
where the foreclosure rate was less than 1 percent of all U.S. housing units. The improvement in 
foreclosure rates was not uniform across the country, however. States with high foreclosure rates 
in 2015 were New Jersey, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and Illinois.10
The Impact of the Downturn on Economies Around the World
The worldwide economic climate is not as strong as in the United States. Growth in emerging 
and developing economies has declined for the fifth year in a row. These economies still make 
up 70 percent of total global economic growth.11 According to the International Monetary Fund, 
three factors continue to affect the global economy: a slowdown in China’s economy, lower 
prices for oil and other commodities, and a possible tightening of the monetary policy in the 
United States.12
In mid-2016, another factor could be added to the preceding list: the decision of Great Britain 
to exit the European Union (also referred to as Brexit, meaning “British exit”). This decision will 
have a significant impact on European economies for several years, and have a smaller effect on the 
United States and Asia. In addition, the Euro-zone financial crises in Greece, Belgium, Italy, ­Ireland, 
and Spain—due to large national debt—affect businesses and consumers there and elsewhere.
The Effect of the Current Economic Climate on Retailing
The data on income and wealth disparity present two distinct market segments: the affluent and 
the “getting by” groups. Affluent groups are attracted to high-quality specialty retailers, fashion 
designers, and designer brands. In contrast, the getting-by segment may purchase less expensive 
products, try and use private-label brands, and postpone purchases. Both groups have become 
more value-conscious as a result of the “Great Recession.” Among the retailers that are doing 
well in this economic climate are deep-discount retailers with their low prices, specialty retailers 
of food products, retailers that attract customers with fresh merchandise in a treasure-hunt experi-
ence, and retailers that use opportunistic purchasing of closeouts.
Off-price apparel chains, such as Marshalls, Burlington Coat Factory (now called simply 
“Burlington”), and T. J. Maxx, have drawn new shoppers because more people have become 
value-driven. In addition, these off-price chains have had significant buying opportunities due to 
overstocked channel members and cancellations of purchases from bankrupt retailers. In an effort 
to increase sales, traditional department stores have developed their off-price outlets, such as Saks 
Fifth Avenue’s Off Saks, Nordstrom’s The Rack, and Macy’s Backstage. These outlets receive 
goods from two sources: closeout and less-than-full merchandise cartons from their own stores, 
and merchandise specially purchased for sales at these outlets.
Since 2008, a number of large retailers have declared bankruptcy. These include ­American 
Apparel (2015), Circuit City (2008), Linens-N-Things (2008), A&P (2015), Radio Shack (2015), 
Blockbuster (2010), Borders (2011), Sbarro (2011 and again in 2014), Friedman’s (2008), 
­Brookstone (2014), and Quiksilver (2015). Numerous other retailers have suffered losses and 
had to run frequent sales to generate business or to close unprofitable stores.
Prior to 2005, U.S. firms had an unlimited amount of time to file a restructuring plan after 
filing for bankruptcy. Since then, these filings have had to be submitted within 18 months. Under 
earlier laws, retailers had 2 years or more (via extensions) to determine which store locations to 
keep. Today, retailers in bankruptcy protection must make store-closing decisions within 210 days. 
Retailers in bankruptcy now are required to pay suppliers and utilities during their bankruptcies. 
Under the older laws, suppliers and utilities had to wait until a company emerged from bankruptcy 
before being paid. Also, due to concerns from lenders who were burnt with mortgage-backed 
securities, troubled retailers have found it much more difficult to get financing. As a result of these 
factors, many retailers that entered bankruptcy over the past decade were unable to restructure and 
were therefore forced to close. A study by AlixPartners found that only 49 of 93 retailers were 
able to emerge from a Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a going concern.13
Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea (A&P) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy two times in a 5-year 
time period: December 2010 and July 2015. As a result of its first bankruptcy, A&P became a 
privately held company after obtaining financing from Goldman Sachs and others. In addition to 
the stores operating under its A&P name, the firm operated supermarkets under the Best Cellars, 

42 
Part 1  •  an overview of strategic retail management
Waldbaum’s, Food Emporium, Super Fresh, Food Basics, and Pathmark brands in six Northeast 
states. Some analysts attributed the chain’s problems to the loss of sales to supercenters such as 
Walmart, membership clubs like Costco, and higher-end retailers such as Whole Foods. Others 
cited problems such as A&P’s high debt, low-profit margins, and inability to finance store renova-
tions for its dated store fixtures and interiors.14 A&P sold off all its stores, remaining merchandise, 
and fixtures as of late 2015, and went out of business.
Some analysts believe that retailers that are not leaders in their respective industry segments 
remain at least somewhat vulnerable to bankruptcy or liquidation. This is especially the case for 
retailers that used heavy debt to fund their expansion during the period when interest rates were 
low and credit availability was high—a temporary occurrence.
Strategic Options for Retailers
Let’s look at several strategic options that are available to retailers to increase their performance 
during these economic times:
▶
▶Rethink existing store formats. A 2015 Nielsen study found that over 18,000 new retail 
stores opened in the United States. Of this number, 88 percent were small-format stores: 
dollar, convenience, and drug.15 These smaller stores have lower inventory requirements due 
to a more limited selection and lower rents, and they are more adaptable to urban locations.
▶
▶Close unprofitable stores. Online sales (especially by Amazon), as well as their own poor 
sales performance, have forced many retailers to close unprofitable stores. As of January 
2016, Sears had just over 700 stores, down from 866 in 2006. Kmart was at 952 stores versus 
over 1,400 stores in 2006. Other major retailers that have been closing stores include Macy’s, 
J. C. Penney, Walmart, and Target.16 The store closings of anchor tenants (such as department 
stores) can have a major impact on adjacent retailers, especially when the closed store was a 
major source of customer traffic.
▶
▶Reexamine the role of price. Value-oriented shoppers (particularly the “worst-off” Ameri-
cans) have become more price-conscious. The greater concern for price is due to a number 
of factors: increased price transparency (due to the ease of checking prices via the Web); the 
absence of sales tax when consumers purchase goods from some out-of-state retailers; and the 
popularity of off-price chains, factory outlets, and sites such as eBay. Traditional retailers can 
respond by price-matching selected competitors (currently done by Best Buy, Target, Home 
Depot, Walmart, and other retailers) and by unbundling prices (offering separate prices for 
the product, delivery, and installation). Some retailers also offer price guarantees in which 
they will reimburse consumers if the price of an item is reduced within a certain number of 
days after purchase.
▶
▶Increase promotional coupons. The number of print and/or digital coupon users have 
remained steady over the past 4 years, but the digital paperless coupon user base has 
grown 27 percent since 2012 to 68.4 million users in 2015. The print coupon user base at 
116.3 ­million still dominates.17 NCH Marketing Services reports that free-standing inserts 
(FSI) account for 92 percent of coupons distributed and represent nearly 50 percent of 
coupons redeemed, whereas digital coupons account for less than 1 percent of distribu-
tion but ­represent nearly 12 percent of redemptions.18 Annually, marketers distribute about 
320 ­billion coupons. More than 62 percent of coupons are for nonfood items. Less than 
1 percent (2.84 billion) of the coupons are redeemed, mostly for food.19 According to NCH 
Marketing Services, more than three-quarters of U.S. consumers regularly use coupons. 
The use of mobile phones for ­in-store coupons is spurring a push toward retailer app-
based ­digital couponing platforms, such as Target’s Cartwheel, CVS’s Pharmacy App, and 
Walmart’s ­Savings Catcher.20
▶
▶Begin the holiday season earlier. One estimate is that stores typically place orders up to 4 to 
7 months in advance. Thus, due to the combined effects of a recession, poor credit availabil-
ity, and/or an atmosphere of consumer caution, stores may acquire 15 to 20 percent or more 
excess holiday inventory. As a result, many retailers promote major holidays well ahead of 
time and conduct special sales events even before a holiday season begins. Many retailers 
now reduce prices on Christmas items before Thanksgiving.

▶
▶Re-introduce layaway plans. The concept of layaways started during the Great Depression 
as a way of enabling customers to purchase items without using a credit card. Through a 
layaway plan, a customer pays the product’s total cost (plus a small fee) in installments 
before being allowed to take the item home. In a traditional layaway program, a customer 
has 30 days to pay for an item after making an initial payment. Although layaway programs 
deny instant gratification to the purchaser, the customer receives the attraction of credit 
cards (being able to purchase an item without paying the full price up front), but with-
out the risk of overextending his or her credit. Until the 2008–2009 economic downturn, 
Kmart was the only major U.S. retailer with a layaway program. Now, Sears, T. J. Maxx, 
­Marshalls, ­Burlington, Toys “R” Us, and Walmart—along with many regional chains and 
local stores—offer layaway programs.

2 Building and Sustaining 
Relationships in Retailing
Chapter 
Objectives
1. To explain what 
value really means and 
highlight its pivotal role 
in retailers’ building and 
sustaining relationships
2. To describe how both 
customer relationships 
and channel 
relationships may be 
nurtured in today’s 
highly competitive 
marketplace
3. To examine 
the differences in 
relationship building 
between goods and 
service retailers
4. To discuss the impact 
of technology on 
relationships in retailing
5. To consider the 
interplay between 
retailers’ ethical 
performance and 
relationships in retailing
In this chapter, we emphasize the importance of value and relationships for retailers. Retailers 
focus on providing a great customer experience through all touchpoints–in-store, online, 
mobile, and customer call centers to create a superior experiential value—the intangible 
psychological and emotional value that attracts new customers and retains existing ones to 
stay competitive in the industry. Research shows that creating experiential value leads to long-
term relationships and higher spending with a retailer in the future.1
Retailers face considerable challenges in maintaining long-term customer relationships when 
consumers expect retailers to “know” what customers have done online and respond to their 
individual demands with personalized assistance and tailored in-store experiences! According 
to TimeTrade’s “Annual State of Retail” survey (http://timetrade.com)2 based on input from 
5,000 consumers and 100 senior retail executives, 59 percent of respondents want store 
associates to know the items in their online shopping carts!3 However, just 24 percent of 
retailers currently have that ability—and only 12 percent are looking to implement it within the 
next 18 months.

Some retailers are trying to distinguish themselves from competitors by deploying technology 
that positions them as collaborators in the consumer’s retail choice. These retailers focus on 
ensuring seamless connections between digital and traditional channels to delivering prompt, 
personalized in-store service. For example:
EyeQ uses a combination of in-store digital signage, advanced facial recognition software, 
and the capabilities of Watson, IBM’s cognitive computing system. When a shopper stops 
to look at an EyeQ digital sign, the sign uses sophisticated facial recognition software, 
and based on facial features and appearance, tailors its product recommendations to the 
viewer’s age and gender. If the shopper gives the system her or his Twitter username, 
Watson can capture the shopper’s most recent 200 tweets, run them through its natural 
language processing capabilities, and slot the customer into a basic personality type. 
Based on that data, not only can the system change the products being recommended, 
but it can also alter the whole experience—background colors, video, music, and so on. 
Personalization does not require the customer to identify himself or herself. The system, 
even without a consumer opting in or providing personal information, can identify a 
repeat visitor by the unique media access control address his or her mobile device sends 
out to find available Wi-Fi. Every time the shopper visits the store, the system learns more 
about her or him, updates parameters, and provides relevant recommendations.4
When shopping in-store, consumers most highly value “prompt service” (54 percent), “a 
personalized experience” (30 percent), and “smart recommendations” (30 percent). The lack 
of prompt assistance will drive most consumers (85 percent) to leave a dressing room—and 
the store—and abandon intended purchases. In sum, customers want to have access to 
retailers on a 24-hour-a-day basis through multiple media platforms—and to be able to offer 
comments, feedback, questions, complaints, and praise that will get prompt and helpful 
responses from retailers.5
Overview
To prosper, a retailer must properly apply the concepts of value and relationship so (1) customers 
strongly believe the firm offers a good value for the money and (2) both customers and channel 
members want to do business with that retailer. Some firms grasp this well. Others still have some 
work to do. Consider GameStop Corp., a global family of specialty retail brands that make the 
most popular technologies affordable through retail stores and repair centers.
As the world’s largest videogame retailer, GameStop Corp. sells new and pre-owned video-
game hardware, physical and digital videogame software, and videogame accessories, as well as 
new and pre-owned mobile and consumer electronics products and other merchandise at its Game-
Stop, EB Games, and Micromania stores. Buying customers’ unwanted games and consoles, 
irrespective of where they were initially purchased, and selling them as “pre-owned” after repair-
ing and certifying them, creates value for the selling customer and the purchasing customer (by 
reducing the cost associated with used goods), as well as being environmentally friendly due to 
its recycling efforts. As of June 2016, GameStop operated about 7,100 stores in the United States, 
Australia, Canada, and Europe, primarily located in shopping malls and strip centers. In July 2015, 
the company acquired Geeknet, Inc. (www.thinkgeek.com),which specializes in selling collect-
ibles, apparel, gadgets, electronics, toys, and other products for technology enthusiasts, general 
consumers, and wholesale customers. Geeknet’s network includes www.kongregate.com, a 
browser-based game site; Game Informer magazine, the world’s leading print and digital video-
game publication; and iOS and Android mobile applications.6
As discussed at the beginning of the chapter, consumers expect more for less, especially from 
their stores than from their online or mobile shopping experience.7 Time- and budget-constrained 
consumers will spend less time shopping, make fewer trips, visit fewer stores, and shop more 
purposefully. Different strokes will satisfy different folks. Consumers will shop for different for-
mats for a variety of needs. Specifically, they will split the commodity shopping trip from the 
value-added shopping trip. Consumers are becoming more skeptical of pricing and advertising

first and foremost—a 
customer-driven retailer.

tactics and more concerned about the environmental impact of their consumption. Under the bar-
rage of sales, price has lost its meaning and gimmicks have lost their appeal. To regain consumer 
confidence, pricing by retailers and manufacturers alike will become transparent, more sensible, 
and more sophisticated. See Figure 2-1.
This chapter looks at value and the value chain, relationship retailing with regard to customers 
and channel partners, the differences in relationship building between goods and service retailers, 
technology and relationships, and ethics and relationships. An appendix on service retailing is 
found at the end of this chapter.
VALUE AND THE VALUE CHAIN
A channel of distribution involves multiple parties: manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, and cus-
tomer. These parties are most apt to be satisfied with their interactions when they have similar 
beliefs about the value provided and received, and they agree on the appropriate payment for that 
level of value.
From the perspective of the manufacturer, wholesaler, and retailer, value is embodied by a 
series of activities and processes—a value chain—that provides a certain value for the consumer. 
It is the totality of the tangible and intangible product and customer service attributes offered to 
shoppers. The level of value relates to each firm’s desire for a fair profit and its niche (such as 
discount versus upscale). Firms may differ in rewarding the value each provides and in allocating 
the activities undertaken.
From the customer’s perspective, value is the perception a shopper has of a value chain. It 
is the customer’s view of all benefits from a purchase (formed by the total retail experience). 
Value is based on perceived benefits received versus the price paid. It varies by type of shopper. 
For example, price-oriented shoppers want low prices, service-oriented shoppers will pay more 
for superior customer service, and status-oriented shoppers will pay a lot to patronize prestigious 
stores.
Why is value such a meaningful concept for every retailer in any kind of setting?
▶
▶Customers must always believe they get their money’s worth, whether the retailer sells $45,000 
Patek Phillipe watches or $40 Casio watches.
▶
▶A strong retail effort is required so that customers perceive the level of value provided in the 
manner the firm intends.
▶
▶Value is desired by all customers; however, it means different things to different customers.
▶
▶Consumer comparison shopping for prices is easy through ads and the Web. Thus, prices have 
moved closer together for different types of retailers.
▶
▶Retail differentiation is essential so a firm is not perceived as a “me too” retailer.
FIGURE 2-1
The Key to Long-
Term Customer 
Satisfaction: 
Meeting 
Expectations
In today’s highly 
competitive retailing 
enviornment, companies 
must do everything they 
can to generate and 
maintain a distinctive 
edge. To attract customers 
and gain their loyalty, 
it is no longer enough 
to “satisfy” them; they 
need to be “wowed.” 
This requires (a) an 
in-depth understanding of 
target shoppers’ desires; 
(b) the proper mix of 
merchandise, customer 
service, and prices for 
those shoppers; and (c) 
supportive, ongoing 
customer interaction. 
These are not easy tasks.

▶
▶A specific value/price level must be set. A retailer can offer $100 worth of benefits for a $100 
item or $125 worth of benefits (through better ambience and customer service) for the same 
item with a $125 price. Either approach can work if properly enacted and marketed.
A retail value chain represents the total bundle of benefits offered to consumers through a 
channel of distribution. It comprises shopping location and parking, retailer ambience, the level 
of customer service, the products/brands carried, product quality, the retailer’s in-stock position, 
shipping, prices, the retailer’s image, and other elements. As a rule, consumers are concerned with 
the results of a value chain, not the process. Food shoppers who buy online via Peapod care only 
that they receive the goods ordered at the promised time, not about the steps needed for the home 
delivery of food at the neighborhood level.
Some elements of a retail value chain are visible to shoppers, such as display windows, store 
hours, sales personnel, and point-of-sale equipment. Other elements are not visible, such as store 
location planning, credit processing, company warehouses, and many merchandising decisions. 
In the latter case, various cues are surrogates for value: upscale store ambience and plentiful sales 
personnel for high-end retailers; shopping carts and self-service for discounters.
There are three aspects of a value-oriented retail strategy: expected, augmented, and poten-
tial. An expected retail strategy represents the minimum value chain elements a given customer 
segment (e.g., young women) expects from a type of retailer (e.g., a mid-priced apparel retailer). 
In most cases, the following are expected value chain elements: store cleanliness, convenient 
hours, well-informed employees, timely service, popular products in stock, parking, and return 
privileges. If applied poorly, expected elements cause customer dissatisfaction and relate to why 
shoppers avoid certain retailers.
An augmented retail strategy includes the extra elements in a value chain that differentiate 
one retailer from another. As an example, how is Saks different from Sears? The following are 
often augmented elements: exclusive brands, superior salespeople, loyalty programs, delivery, 
personal shoppers and other special services, and valet parking. Augmented features complement 
expected value chain elements, and they are the key to continued customer patronage with a par-
ticular retailer.
A potential retail strategy comprises value chain elements not yet perfected by a competing 
firm in the retailer’s category. For example, what customer services could a new upscale apparel 
chain offer that no other chain offers? In many situations, the following are potential value chain 
elements: 24/7 store hours (an augmented strategy for supermarkets), unlimited customer return 
privileges, full-scale product customization, instant fulfillment of rain checks through in-store 
orders accompanied by free delivery, in-mall trams to make it easier for shoppers to move through 
enormous regional shopping centers, and a doorman. The first firms to capitalize on potential 
features typically gain a head start over their adversaries. Barnes & Noble and Borders accom-
plished this by opening the first book superstores, and Amazon.com became a major player by

Buyers are often contrasted with category managers. Buyers usu-
ally evaluate suppliers, negotiate purchases, and match inventory 
levels with sales prospects. They need to understand and properly 
respond to sales trends, seasonality, fashion influences, and price 
concerns among shoppers.
Whereas a buyer may be responsible for a range of prod-
ucts for a supermarket such as prepackaged lettuce, spinach, 
and carrots; a category manager’s responsibility can extend 
to all produce. Category managers also have greater sales 
and marketing responsibilities. This includes space allocation, 
assortment planning, display planning, and discussing joint 
promotions with key suppliers. A good category manager for 
a supermarket should think in terms of meal solutions versus 
frozen foods.

PART 1  •  AN OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC RETAIL MANAGEMENT
There are five potential pitfalls to avoid in planning a value-oriented retail strategy:
▶
▶Planning value with just a price perspective. Value is tied to two factors: benefits and prices. 
All major discounters now accept credit cards because shoppers want to purchase with them.
▶
▶Providing value-enhancing services that customers do not want or will not pay extra for. 
Ikea knows most of its customers want to save money by assembling furniture themselves.
▶
▶Competing in the wrong value/price segment. Neighborhood retailers generally have a tough 
time competing in the low-price part of the market. They are better off providing augmented 
benefits and charging somewhat more than large chains.
▶
▶Believing augmented elements alone create value. Many retailers think that if they offer a 
benefit not available from competitors that they will automatically prosper. Yet, they must 
never lose sight of the importance of expected benefits. A movie theater with limited parking 
will have problems even if it features first-run movies.
▶
▶Paying lip service to customer service. Most firms say, and even believe, customers are always 
right. Yet, they may act contrary to this philosophy—by having a high turnover of salespeople, 
charging restocking fees for returned goods that have been opened, and not giving rain checks 
for out-of-stock items.
To sidestep these pitfalls, a retailer could use the checklist in Figure 2-2, which poses a num-
ber of questions that must be addressed. The checklist can be answered by an owner/corporate 
president, a team of executives, or an independent consultant. It should be reviewed yearly or more 
often if a major development, such as the emergence of a strong competitor, occurs.
RETAILER RELATIONSHIPS
In Chapter 1, we introduced the concept of relationship retailing, whereby retailers seek to form 
and maintain long-term bonds with customers, rather than act as if each sales transaction is a new 
encounter with them. For relationship retailing to work, enduring value-driven relationships are 
needed with other channel members, as well as with customers. Both jobs are challenging. See 
Figure 2-3. Visit our blog for posts related to relationship retailing issues (www.bermanevansretail 
.com).

CHAPTER 2   •  Building and Sustaining Relationships in Retailing

Customer Relationships
Loyal customers are the backbone of a business. Thus, it is important that retailers retain their loyal 
customers through repeated sales in a trusting relationship. Loyalty has two unique ­dimensions—
attitudinal and behavioral—and each contributes differently to retailers’ revenues, profits, and 
market share.8 Customers who are attitudinally loyal will have a higher tendency to spread positive 
word-of-mouth recommendations to friends and family on social media, have a higher commit-
ment to the retailer, and not be reluctant to pay more for products at a particular retailer.
Customers who are behaviorally loyal will have a higher tendency to continue purchasing 
from a particular retailer. Behavioral loyalty may also be a manifestation of inertia (or inertial 
loyalty) due to high switching costs associated with changing retailers. Although both attitudinal 
and behavioral loyalty are important to achieve business goals and to sustain the position in the 
marketplace, a retailer’s positioning strategy (discussed in Chapter 3) will influence which dimen-
sion needs to be strategically managed. Attitudinal loyalty should be emphasized if the objective 
is to charge higher prices, whereas behavioral loyalty should be more important if the objective is 
to increase market share or profits.9
In a competitive industry such as retailing, many consumers show divided behavioral loyalty 
to more than one retailer for a single category need. Here’s why: You have satisfied customers. 
“That’s good, right? Well, yes for the short term the customer[s] will continue purchasing. While 
a loyal customer is a satisfied customer, the converse is not necessarily true. Real loyalty [or 
attitudinal loyalty]—much harder to earn than mere satisfaction—tells you that your customer 
wants to stick with you over the long haul and will share that feeling with others.”10 Retailers need 
to develop and strategically manage loyalty programs to cultivate behavioral loyalty (discussed 
later in this chapter). But in the long term, it’s not necessarily enough. Customers who spend a 
lot can defect to the retailer providing lower prices or better service and enroll in multiple loyalty 
programs. Attitudinal loyalty derives not from hum-drum “good” transactions but from exceed-
ing customer expectations on a repeated basis and delightful experiences that make shoppers so 
emotionally devoted that they want to share their experience by telling others.
In relationship retailing, there are four factors to keep in mind: the customer base, customer 
service, customer satisfaction, and loyalty programs and defection rates. Let’s explore these next.
THE CUSTOMER BASE  Retailers must regularly analyze their customer base in terms of popula-
tion and lifestyle trends, attitudes toward and reasons for shopping, the level of loyalty, and the 
mix of new versus loyal customers.

PART 1  •  AN OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC RETAIL MANAGEMENT
As reported by the Census Bureau, the U.S. population is aging. One-fourth of households 
consist of only one person, one-seventh of people move annually, most people live in urban and 
suburban areas, middle-class income has been rising very slowly, and African American, Hispanic 
American, and Asian American segments are expanding. Thus, gender roles are changing, shop-
pers demand more, consumers are more diverse, there is less interest in shopping, and time-saving 
goods and services are desired.
Future retail trends will be driven by the Millennials (Generation Y), who have surpassed 
Baby Boomers as the largest generation. According to the Pew Research Center, there are about 
75 million Americans born between the early 1980s and the late 1990s; and they defy easy cat-
egorization, for they are the most racially diverse generation the United States has experienced.11 
Millennials have an elevated sense of idealism and are concerned how brands and retailers perform 
on social responsibility, sustainability, gender equality, and fair trade.
In their quest for growth in market share and sales revenue, many retailers typically focus 
on one side of customer value—delivering value. The customer is king (or queen) and every-
thing must be done to deliver superior value and to delight him (or her). Astute retailers balance 
this view with the other side of customer value—receiving value. This is achieved by attracting 
and retaining those customers who provide value in the form of profits to the firm through their 
transactions.
It is worth more to nurture relationships with some shoppers than with others. These are the 
retailer’s core customers—its best customers—loyal, satisfied customers who get high value 
from the retailer and generate high profits for the retailer. These core customers are the most 
desirable, are resistant to competitors’ enticements of better deals, and deliver long-term profits. 
At the other extreme are the “lost causes” who don’t value the retailer’s goods or services and 
are not profitable.12 They cost the retailer more than they are worth because they frequently 
complain and return products, spread bad word of mouth, misuse promotions, and lower staff 
morale through their interactions. It does not make economic sense for the retailer to acquire 
them in the first place. Losing these customers may reduce market share but lead to improved 
profitability and higher levels of retailer performance. “Free-riders” (customers who are highly 
satisfied with the company but not highly profitable) and vulnerable customers (profitable but 
not satisfied with the retailer) can be managed through customer relationship management strate-
gies. Charging higher prices and reducing services for free-riders can increase profitability. It is 
important for retailers to identify unmet needs of vulnerable customers and consider whether it 
will be profitable to satisfy them; otherwise, competitors will poach them away.
Retailers need to identify their best customers and see what characteristics differentiate 
these profitable customers from all the rest. Next, the retailer should determine whether it 
makes economic sense to pursue a differentiated offering to free-riders and vulnerable cus-
tomers and to fine-tune strategies for the consumers who are most likely to yield profitable 
customers.
A retailer’s desired mix of new versus loyal customers depends on that firm’s stage in its life 
cycle, goals, and resources, as well as competitors’ actions. A mature firm is more apt to rely on 
core customers and supplement its revenues with new shoppers. A new firm faces the dual tasks 
of attracting shoppers and building a loyal following; it cannot do the latter without the former. 
If goals are growth-oriented, the customer base must be expanded by adding stores, increasing 
advertising, and so on; the challenge is to do this in a way that does not deflect attention from 
core customers. Although it is more costly to attract new customers than to serve existing ones, 
core customers are not cost-free; they must be service properly. If competitors try to take away 
a retailer’s existing customers with price cuts and special promotions, that retailer might pursue 
the competitors’ customers in the same way. Again, regardless of what action is taken, all retailers 
must be careful not to alienate core customers.
CUSTOMER SERVICE  As described in Chapter 1, customer service refers to the identifiable, but 
sometimes intangible, activities undertaken by a retailer in conjunction with the goods and ser-
vices it sells. It has an impact on the total retail experience. Consistent with a value chain philoso-
phy, retailers must apply two elements of customer service. Expected customer service is the 
service level that customers want to receive from any retailer, such as basic employee courtesy. 
Augmented customer service includes the activities that enhance the shopping experience and 
give retailers a competitive advantage.

	
CHAPTER 2   •  Building and Sustaining Relationships in Retailing	
51	
The attributes of personnel who interact with customers (such as politeness and knowledge), 
as well as the number and variety of customer services offered, have a strong effect on the rela-
tionship created. Although planning a superior customer service strategy can be complex, a well-
executed strategy can pay off in a big way.
Some retailers realize customer service is better if they utilize employee empowerment, 
whereby workers have the discretion to do what they believe is necessary—within reason—to satisfy 
the customer, even if this means bending the rules. The founders of Home Depot made a strategic 
decision to train employees to form enduring customer relationships rather than push for incremental 
sales gains. As a result, the retailer grew very quickly because of its outstanding customer service. 
Home Depot’s core value, “Taking care of our people,” states that the company encourages associ-
ates to speak up and take risks, recognizes and rewards good work performance, and leads and 
develops employees so that they may grow. Home Depot believes that the key to its success and its 
competitive advantage in the marketplace is treating people well—starting with employees, who in 
turn ensure that customers are treated well. However, Home Depot’s American Customer Satisfac-
tion Index rating tumbled to the bottom in the home-improvement category when it faced a high-
profile credit-card security breach in the fall of 2014.13 That rating has risen since then.
To apply customer service effectively, a firm must first develop an overall service strategy 
and then plan individual services. Figure 2-4 shows one way a retailer may view the customer 
services it offers.
DEVELOPING A CUSTOMER SERVICE STRATEGY.  A retailer must make the following vital decisions.
What customer services are expected and what customer services are augmented for a particular 
retailer? Examples of expected customer services are credit for a furniture retailer, new-car preparation 
for an auto dealer, and a liberal return policy for a gift shop. Those retailers could not stay in business 
without these services. Because augmented customer services are extra elements, a firm could serve its 
target market without such services, but using them will enhance its competitive standing. Examples 
are home delivery for a supermarket within a 1-hour window, an extended warranty for a used auto 
dealer, and free gift wrapping for a toy store. Each firm needs to learn which customer services are 
expected and which are augmented for its situation. Services that are viewed as expected customer 
services for one retailer, such as delivery, may be viewed as augmented for another. See Figure 2-5.
What level of customer service is proper to complement a firm’s image? An upscale retailer 
would offer more customer services than a discounter because people expect the upscale firm to 
have a wider range of customer services as part of its basic strategy. Performance would also be 
different. Customers of an upscale retailer may expect elaborate gift wrapping, valet parking, an 
in-store restaurant, and a ladies’ room attendant, whereas discount shoppers may expect cardboard 
gift boxes, self-service parking, a lunch counter, and an unattended ladies’ room. Customer service 
categories are the same; performance is not.
Should there be a choice of customer services? Some firms let customers select from various 
levels of customer service; others provide only one level. A retailer may honor several credit cards 
or only its own. Trade-ins may be allowed on some items or all. Warranties may have optional 
extensions or fixed lengths. A firm may offer 1-, 3-, and 6-month payment plans or insist on 
immediate payment.
AutoZone (www 
.autozone.com) has a 
unique style of customer 
service.
Nordstrom (www

believes in empowering 
its employees to better 
serve customers.

PART 1  •  AN OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC RETAIL MANAGEMENT
Should customer services be free? Two factors cause retailers to charge for some customer 
services: First, delivery, gift wrapping, and some other customer services are labor intensive, and 
second, people are more apt to be home for a delivery or service call if a fee is imposed. Without 
a fee, a retailer may have to attempt a delivery twice. In settling on a free or fee-based strategy, a 
firm should (1) determine which customer services are expected (these are often free) and which 
are augmented (these may be offered for a fee); (2) monitor competitors and profit margins; and 
(3) study the target market. In setting fees, a retailer must also decide if its goal is to break even 
or to make a profit on certain customer services.
How can a retailer measure the benefits of providing customer services against the cost of the 
services? The aim of customer services is to enhance the shopping experience in a way that attracts 
and retains shoppers—while maximizing sales and profits. Thus, augmented services should not 
be offered unless they increase total sales and profits. A retailer should plan augmented customer 
services based on its experience, competitors’ actions, and customer comments; when the costs of 
providing these customer services increase, higher prices should be passed on to the consumers.
How can customer services be terminated? When a customer service strategy is set, shoppers 
are apt to react negatively to any customer service reduction. Yet, some costly augmented customer 
services may have to be dropped. In that case, the best approach is to be forthright by explaining 
why the customer services are being terminated and how customers will benefit via lower prices. 
Sometimes a firm may use a middle ground, charging for previously free customer services (such 
as clothing alterations) to allow those who want the services to still receive them.
PLANNING INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER SERVICES.  After a broad customer service plan is outlined, indi-
vidual customer services need to be planned. A department store may offer credit, layaway, gift 
wrapping, a bridal registry, free parking, a restaurant, a beauty salon, carpet installation, dressing 
rooms, clothing alterations, restrooms and sitting areas, the use of baby strollers, home delivery, 
and fur storage. See Table 2-1 for a range of typical customer services.
Most retailers let customers make credit purchases; and many firms accept personal checks 
with proper identification. Consumers’ use of credit rises as the purchase amount goes up. Retailer-
sponsored credit cards have three key advantages: (1) The retailer saves the fee it would pay for 
outside card sales, (2) people are encouraged to shop with a given retailer because its card is usu-
ally not accepted elsewhere, and (3) contact can be maintained with customers and information 
learned about them. There are also disadvantages to retailer cards: Startup costs are high, the firm 
must worry about unpaid bills and slow cash flow, credit checks and follow-up tasks must be

Providing Extra Value for Customers
Retailers that offer extra services to customers often stand out in the marketplace. For example, a given 
retailer could offer free repairs on the products it sells (a) and also allow consumers to tag QR codes via their 
smartphones so they can learn more about products within the store (b).

performed, and customers without the firm’s card may be discouraged from shopping at that par-
ticular retail store. Bank and other commercial credit cards enable small and medium retailers to 
offer credit, generate added business for all types of retailers, appeal to mobile shoppers, provide 
advertising support from the sponsor, reduce bad debts, eliminate startup costs for the retailer, and 
provide data. Yet, the cards charge a transaction fee and do not yield loyalty to a retailer.
Most bank cards and retailer cards involve a revolving credit account, whereby a customer 
charges items and is billed monthly on the basis of the outstanding cumulative balance. An option 
credit account is a form of revolving account; no interest is assessed if a person pays a bill in full when 
it is due. When a person makes a partial payment, he or she is assessed interest monthly on the unpaid 
balance. Some credit card firms (such as American Express) and some retailers offer an open credit 
account, whereby a consumer must pay the bill in full when it is due. Partial, revolving payments are 
not permitted. A person with an open account also has a credit limit (although it may be more flexible).
For a retailer that offers delivery, there are three decisions: the transportation method, equip-
ment ownership versus rental, and timing. The transportation method can be car, van, truck, rail, 
mail, and so forth. The costs and appropriateness of the methods depend on the products. Regarding 
transportation equipment ownership, large retailers often find it economical to own their delivery 
vehicles. This also lets them advertise the company name, have control over schedules, and use their 
employees for deliveries. Small retailers serving limited trading areas may use personal vehicles. 
Many small, medium, and even large retailers use shippers such as UPS if consumers live away from 
a delivery area and shipments are not otherwise efficient. And finally, for the timing of delivery, 
the retailer must decide how quickly to process orders and how often to deliver to different locales.
For some firms, alterations and installations are expected services—although more retailers 
now charge fees. However, many discounters have stopped offering alterations of clothing and 
installations of appliances on both a free and a fee basis. They feel the services are too ancillary 
to their business and not worth the effort. Other retailers offer only basic alterations: shortening 
pants, taking in the waist, and lengthening jacket sleeves. They do not adjust jacket shoulders 
or width. Some appliance retailers may hook up washing machines but not do plumbing work.
Within a store, packaging (gift wrapping)—as well as complaints and returns handling—can 
be centrally located or decentralized. Centralized packaging counters and complaints and returns 
areas have advantages: They may be located in otherwise dead spaces, the main selling areas are 
not cluttered, specialized personnel can be used, and there is a common policy. The advantages of 
decentralization are that shoppers are not inconvenienced, they are kept in the selling area (where 
a salesperson may resolve a problem or offer different merchandise), and extra personnel are not 
required. In either case, clear guidelines as to the handling of complaints and returns are needed.

PART 1  •  AN OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC RETAIL MANAGEMENT
Gift cards encourage shopping with a given retailer. Many firms require gift cards to be spent 
and not redeemed for cash. Trade-ins also induce new and regular shoppers to visit the store or 
its Web site. People may feel they are getting a bargain. Trial purchases let shoppers test products 
before purchases are final.
Retailers increasingly offer special customer services to their regular customers. Sales events 
(not open to the general public) and extended hours are provided. Mail and phone orders are 
handled for convenience.
Other useful customer services include a bridal registry, interior designers, personal shoppers, 
ticket outlets, free (or low-cost) and plentiful parking, water fountains, pay phones, baby strollers, 
company-sponsored social media, restrooms, a restaurant, babysitting, fitting rooms, a beauty 
salon, fur storage, shopping bags, information counters, and layaway plans.
A retailer’s willingness to offer some or all of these services indicates to customers a concern 
for them. Therefore, firms need to consider the impact of excessive self-service. Research shows 
that some shoppers think self-service technologies (SSTs) are used by service providers to cut 
costs rather than extend customer service. Thus, service managers need to provide a clear reason 
for using SSTs to stimulate customers’ attribution of higher benefits and convenience.14
CUSTOMER SATISFACTION  Customer satisfaction occurs when the value and customer service 
provided through a retailing experience meet or exceed consumer expectations. If the expectations 
of value and customer service are not met, the consumer will be dissatisfied. “Retail satisfaction 
consists of three categories: shopping systems satisfaction, which includes availability and types of 
outlets; buying systems satisfaction, which includes selection and actual purchasing of products; and 
consumer satisfaction, which is derived from the use of the product. Dissatisfaction with any of the 
three aspects could lead to customer disloyalty, decrease in sales, and erosion of the market share.”15
Only “very satisfied” customers are likely to remain loyal in the long run. How well are 
retailers doing in customer satisfaction? Many have much work to do. The American Customer 
Satisfaction Index (www.theacsi.org) annually questions thousands of people to link customer 
expectations, perceived quality, and perceived value to satisfaction. Overall, department and dis-
count stores generally have scores from 66 to 82, supermarkets from 67 to 86, and specialty retail 
stores from 65 to 81 (on a scale of 100). Gasoline stations usually rate lowest in the retailing 
category (with scores around 70). To improve matters, retailers should consider engaging in the 
activities shown in Figure 2-6.
Most consumers do not complain to the retailer when dissatisfied; they just shop elsewhere. 
Why don’t shoppers complain more? (1) Most people feel complaining produces little or no posi-
tive results, so they do not bother to complain, and (2) complaining is not easy. Consumers have to 
find the party to whom they should complain, access to that party may be restricted, and written 
forms may have to be completed.
To obtain more feedback, retailers must make it easier for shoppers to complain, make sure 
shoppers believe their concerns are addressed, and sponsor ongoing customer satisfaction surveys. 
As suggested by software firm StatPac, retailers should ask such questions as these and then take 
corrective actions:
1.	 “Overall, how satisfied or dissatisfied are you with the store?”
2.	 “How satisfied or dissatisfied are you with the price of the items you purchased?”
3.	 “How satisfied or dissatisfied are you with the quality of the merchandise?”
4.	 “Please tell us something we could do to improve our store.”16

surveys (www.statpac

satisfaction.

LOYALTY PROGRAMS AND DEFECTION RATES  Consumer loyalty (frequent shopper) programs 
reward a retailer’s best customers, those with whom it wants long-lasting relationships. These pro-
grams have been shown to enhance consumers’ purchase frequencies and volumes. An example of 
a loyalty program is after your membership card is punched nine times, indicating that you’ve had 
nine pancake breakfasts, your tenth pancake breakfast is free. Loyalty programs vary dramatically, 
based on number of visits, reward timing, reward type, reward value, behavior before and after 
redemptions, accumulation of credits toward the award, the behavioral unit used to track purchase 
behavior (e.g., points, miles flown, nights stayed, dollars, number of purchases/visits, etc.), the 
redemption policy of rewards, and the reward program enrollment fee. Academic research shows 
that consumers who pay a fee to participate in loyalty programs have more favorable attitudes 
toward the programs and higher behavioral loyalty, focus more on the benefits associated with 
program enrollment, and perceive the programs as a better value than consumers who enroll in a 
loyalty program for free.17
For retailers, fee-based programs increase consumer revenue after enrollment (in addition 
to the revenue generated from the fee). In general, the higher the program fee, the lower the con-
sumers’ willingness to join. When membership fees are nominal (or free), simple dollar and point 
accrual work best, as these programs lead to the highest joining intentions and keep the consumer 
focused on cost/benefit assessments of the program (rather than the price of the program).18 Simple 
accrual systems allow for easy conversions and should make the ultimate reward seem closer to 
obtaining and more attractive, enhancing the cost/benefit ratio for customers. Retailers who offer 
higher fee-based loyalty programs are more likely to attract members when they offer complex 
accruals—the accrual of multiple points per dollar spent to encourage consumers to consider the 
benefits of reward membership holistically.
Retailers in categories with less differentiation (e.g., airlines and supermarkets) offer loyalty 
programs with the goal of increasing repeat business and profitability. In these cases, a decision 
to join a loyalty program may have a big impact by increasing customer perceptions of switching 
costs that increase behavioral loyalty. Firms can collect customer contact and socio-demographic 
information when they sign up, and track browsing and purchase behavior that they can use to 
personalize offers and strengthen the exchange with customers.19
From the shopper’s perspective, there are five types of reward categories:20
1.	 Economic rewards include price reductions and purchase vouchers. These rewards attract 
price-sensitive customers and induce them to buy more. Dunkin Donuts DDPerks program 
members receive a free beverage after earning 200 Points ($40 in spending) on qualifying

purchases. Members receive promotional E-mails with dollars off selected food or beverage 
items automatically applied when they use the mobile app or loyalty card in stores.21
2.	 Hedonistic rewards include things such as points that can be exchanged for spa services or 
participation in games or sweepstakes. These rewards have more emotional value and will 
attract people who shop for pleasure.
3.	 Social-relational rewards include things such as mailings about special events or the right to 
use special waiting areas at airports. Consumers who want to be identified with a privileged 
group will value these kinds of rewards.
4.	 Informational rewards include things such as personalized beauty advice or information on new 
goods or services. These rewards will attract consumers who like to stick with one brand or store.
5.	 Functional rewards include things such as access to priority checkout counters or home 
delivery. Consumers who want to reduce the time they spend shopping will value these most. 
Dunkin Donuts DDperks rewards members can use the On-The-Go mobile app to order 
ahead and skip the line at the store.
What do good customer loyalty programs have in common? Their rewards are useful and 
appealing, and they are attainable in a reasonable time. Referrals (through social media or direct 
invites) are rewarded, as well as frequent shopping behavior (the greater the purchases, the greater 
the benefits). Each year, Starbucks Rewards members start at the Green Level and earn two stars 
for each $1 spent until they accumulate 300 stars for Gold status. The latter members earn free 
beverages for every 125 stars and other benefits until the end of the year.22 Rewards that are unique 
to particular retailers and not redeemable elsewhere are more effective. Rewards stimulate both 
short- and long-run purchases. Customer communications are personalized. Frequent shoppers 
feel “special.” Participation rules are publicized and rarely change.
When a retailer studies customer defections (by tracking databases or surveying consumers), 
it can learn how many customers it is losing and why they no longer patronize a firm. Customer 
defections may be viewed in absolute terms (people who no longer buy from the firm at all) and 
in relative terms (people who shop less often or who have reduced their average purchase quan-
tity). Each retailer must define its acceptable defection rate. Furthermore, not all shoppers are 
“good” customers. A retailer may feel it is okay if shoppers who always look for sales, return 
items without receipts, and expect fee-based services to be free decide to defect. Unfortunately, 
too few retailers review defection data or survey defecting customers because of the complexity 
of doing so and an unwillingness to hear “bad news.”
Channel Relationships
Within a value chain, the members of a distribution channel (manufacturers, wholesalers, and retail-
ers) jointly represent a value delivery system, which comprises all the parties that develop, produce, 
deliver, and sell and service particular goods and services. These are the ramifications for retailers:
▶
▶Each channel member is dependent on the others. When consumers shop with a certain retailer, 
they often do so because of the retailer as well as the products it carries.
▶
▶All activities in a value delivery system must be enumerated and responsibility assigned.
▶
▶Small retailers may have to use suppliers outside the normal distribution channel to get items 
they want and gain adequate supplier support. Large firms may be able to buy directly from 
manufacturers; smaller firms may have to buy through wholesalers handling such accounts.
▶
▶A value delivery system is as good as its weakest link. No matter how well a retailer performs its 
activities, it will still have unhappy shoppers if suppliers deliver late or do not honor warranties.
▶
▶The nature of a given value delivery system must be related to target market expectations.
▶
▶Channel member costs and functions are influenced by each party’s role. Long-term coopera-
tion and two-way information flows foster efficiency.
▶
▶Value delivery systems are complex due to the vast product assortment of superstores, the 
many forms of retailing, and the use of multiple distribution channels by some manufacturers.
▶
▶Nonstore retailing (such as mail order, phone, and Web transactions) requires a different 
delivery system than store retailing.
▶
▶Due to conflicting goals about profit margins, shelf space, and so on, some channel members 
are adversarial—to the detriment of the value delivery system and channel relationships.
When they forge strong positive channel relationships, members of a value delivery sys-
tem better serve each other and the final consumer. Here’s how: Walmart and Sam’s Club work 
closely with suppliers to drive out unnecessary costs in order to pass savings to their shoppers.23 
Starbucks (www 
.starbucks.com/card/
rewards) has a strong 
loyalty program for its 
customers.

Ace Hardware’s cooperative structure allows its buyers to negotiate with the power of over 4,800 
locations, so that store owners have a significant advantage over nonaffiliated stores.24
One relationship-oriented practice that some manufacturers and retailers use, especially 
supermarket chains, is category management, whereby channel members collaborate to manage 
products by category rather than by individual item. Successful category management is based on 
these actions: (1) Retailers listen better to customers and stock what they want, (2) Profitability 
is improved because inventory more closely matches demand, (3) By being better focused, shop-
pers find each department to be more desirable, (4) Retail buyers have more responsibility and 
accountability for category results, (5) Retailers and suppliers share data and are more computer-
ized, (6) Retailers and suppliers plan together. See Figure 2-7 for various factors that contribute 
to effective channel relationships, Category management is discussed further in Chapter 14.
THE DIFFERENCES IN RELATIONSHIP BUILDING BETWEEN 
GOODS AND SERVICE RETAILERS
Consumer interest in services makes it crucial to understand the differences in relationship building 
between retailers that market services and those that market goods. This applies to store-based and 
nonstore-based firms, those offering only goods or services, and those offering goods and services.
Goods retailing focuses on the sale of tangible (physical) products. Service retailing involves 
transactions in which consumers do not purchase or acquire ownership of tangible products. Some 
retailers engage in either goods retailing (such as hardware stores) or service retailing (such as 
travel agencies); others offer a combination of the two (such as Best Buy selling PCs and offering 
fee-based Geek Squad services). The latter format is growing. Consider how many drugstores 
have equipment to process digital photos, how many department stores have cafés, how many 
hotels have gift shops, and so on.
Service retailing encompasses such diverse businesses as personal services, hotels and motels, 
auto repair and rental, and recreational services. In addition, although several services have not been 
commonly considered a part of retailing (such as medical, dental, legal, and educational services), 
they should be when they entail final consumer sales. There are three basic kinds of service retailing:
▶
▶Rented-goods services, whereby consumers lease and use goods for specified periods of 
time. Tangible goods are leased for a fixed time, but ownership is not obtained and the goods 
must be returned when the rental period is up. Examples are Hertz car rentals, carpet cleaner 
machine rentals from a supermarket, and video rentals at Redbox kiosks.
Ace (www.acehardware 
.com) prides itself on 
strong relationships with 
its suppliers.

PART 1  •  AN OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC RETAIL MANAGEMENT
▶
▶Owned-goods services, whereby goods owned by consumers are repaired, improved, or 
maintained. In this grouping, the retailer providing the service never owns the good involved. 
Illustrations include watch repair, lawn care, and an annual air-conditioner tune-up.
▶
▶Nongoods services, whereby intangible personal services are offered to consumers who 
then experience the services rather than possess them. The seller offers personal expertise 
for a specified time in return for a fee; tangible goods are not involved. Some examples are 
accountants, stockbrokers, travel agents, real-estate brokers, and personal trainers.
Please note: The terms customer service and service retailing are not interchangeable. Customer 
service refers to the activities undertaken in conjunction with the retailer’s main business; they 
are part of the total retail experience. Service retailing refers to situations in which services are 
sold to consumers.
Four unique aspects of service retailing impact relationship building and customer retention: 
(1) The intangibility of many services makes a consumer’s choice of competitive offerings more 
difficult than with goods, (2) the service provider and his or her services are sometimes inseparable 
(thus localizing marketing efforts), (3) the perishability of many services prevents storage and 
increases risks, and (4) the human nature involved in many services makes them more variable.
The intangible (and possibly abstract) nature of some services makes it harder for a firm to 
develop a clear consumer-oriented strategy, particularly because many retailers (such as opticians, 
repairpeople, and landscapers) start service businesses on the basis of their product expertise. The 
inseparability of the service provider and his or her services means the owner-operator is often 
indispensable and good customer relations are pivotal. Perishability presents a risk that in many cases 
cannot be overcome. Thus, revenues from an unrented hotel room are forever lost. Variability means 
service quality may differ for each shopping experience, store, or service provider. See Figure 2-8.

time they buy a service so that customers do not leave if a popular 
employee goes elsewhere.
• Call customers after a service is performed to demonstrate the ﬁrm’s 
interest in them.
• Carefully plan each work day to optimize service visits or calls.
• Be prepared to do alternative tasks if the weather is bad.
• Oﬀer appropriate other services that are popular during oﬀ-seasons.
• Be willing to work longer hours during peak periods and fewer hours 
during slower times.

	
CHAPTER 2   •  Building and Sustaining Relationships in Retailing	
59	
Service retailing is much more dependent on personal interactions and word-of-mouth com-
munication than goods retailing. According to Professor Leonard Berry, building customer–firm 
relationships benefits both parties: “For services that are personally important, variable in quality, 
and/or complex, many customers will desire to be relationship customers.” For example, finan-
cial, insurance, and hairstyling services have characteristics “that would cause many customers 
to desire continuity with the same provider, a proactive service attitude, and customized service 
delivery.”25
Figure 2-9 highlights several factors that consumers may consider in forming their percep-
tions about the caliber of the service retailing experience offered by a particular firm. The appendix 
at the end of this chapter presents an additional discussion on the unique aspects of operating a 
service retailing business.
TECHNOLOGY AND RELATIONSHIPS IN RETAILING
Technology is beneficial to retailing relationships if it facilitates a better communication flow 
between retailers and their customers, as well as between retailers and their suppliers, and there 
are faster, more dependable transactions.
These two points are key in studying technology and its impact on relationships in  
retailing:
1.	 In each firm, the roles of technology and “humans” must be clear and consistent with the 
goals and style of that business. Although technology can facilitate customer service, it may 
become overloaded and break down. It is also viewed as impersonal by some consumers. 
New technology must be set up efficiently with minimal disruptions to suppliers, employees, 
and customers.
2.	 Shoppers expect certain operations to be in place, so they can rapidly complete credit transac-
tions, get feedback on product availability, and so on. Firms have to deploy some advances 
(such as a computerized checkout system) simply to be competitive. By enacting other 
advances, they can be distinctive. For instance, consider the paint store with computerized 
paint-matching equipment for customers who want to touch up old paint jobs or who threw 
out their old paint can without saving the custom color number.
Throughout this book, we devote a lot of attention to technological advances via our “Tech-
nology in Retailing” boxes and in-chapter discussions. Here, we look at technology’s effects in 
terms of electronic banking and customer–supplier interactions.

PART 1  •  AN OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC RETAIL MANAGEMENT
Electronic Banking
Electronic banking involves both the use of automatic teller machines (ATMs) and the instant 
processing of retail purchases. It allows centralized recordkeeping and lets customers complete 
transactions 24 hours a day, 7 days a week at bank and nonbank locations—including home or 
office. Besides its use in typical financial transactions (such as check cashing, deposits, with-
drawals, and transfers), many retailers now use electronic banking. These retailers accept some 
form of electronic debit payment plan (discussed further in Chapter 13), whereby the purchase 
price is immediately deducted from a consumer’s bank account by computer and transferred to 
the retailer’s account.
Worldwide, there are more than 3 billion ATMs—450,000 in the United States alone—and 
people make several billion ATM transactions yearly (there are 800 transactions, on average, per 
month per ATM machine).26 These automated machines are located in banks, shopping centers, 
department stores, supermarkets, convenience stores, hotels, and airports, as well as on college 
campuses and other sites. With sharing systems, such as the Cirrus, Maestro, and Plus networks, 
consumers can make transactions at ATMs outside their local banking areas and around the world.
The widespread acceptance of the smart card, which contains an electronic strip that stores 
and modifies customer information in real time, is important for retailers and shoppers alike. A 
smart card includes an embedded integrated circuit chip and communicates with a reader through 
physical contact or with a remote contactless electromagnetic field that energizes the chip and 
transfers data between the card and the reader.27
The adoption of Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay apps since 2014 through NFC-
enabled mobile devices allow for contactless payments. Contactless payment transactions do not 
require physical contact between the consumer payment device and the physical point-of-sale 
(POS) terminal. The consumer holds the NFC-enabled mobile device in close proximity (less 
than 2 to 4 inches) to the merchant POS terminal and the payment account information is com-
municated wirelessly (via radio frequency).28
Customer and Supplier Interactions
Technology is changing the nature of retailer–customer and retailer–supplier interactions. See 
Figure 2-10. If properly implemented, benefits accrue to all parties. If not, there are negative 
ramifications. Here are several illustrations.
Retailers widely use point-of-sale scanning equipment. Why? By electronically scanning 
products (rather than having cashiers “ring up” each product), retailers can quickly complete trans-
actions, amass sales data, give feedback to suppliers, place and receive orders faster, reduce costs, 
and adjust inventory. There is a downside to scanning: the error rate. This can upset consumers, 
especially if they perceive scanning as inaccurate. Yet, according to research on scanning, scanner 
errors in reading prices occur very infrequently; although consumers believe most errors result in 
overcharges, overcharges and undercharges are equally likely. One way to assure consumers is to 
display more information at the point of purchase.
One type of point-of-sale system involves self-scanning (which is discussed further in 
Chapter 13). Here’s how a basic customer-operated point-of-sale system—a self-scanning 
checkout—works: Shoppers do not interact with a human cashier (although a supervisor is 
usually nearby to assist the customer) because these shoppers scan merchandise themselves, 
insert coupons in designated slots, use an electronic cash register to process a cash, credit, or 
debit payment, and bag their merchandise themselves. The display at a self-scanning check-
out is typically touchscreen and visual. Items are placed on a flatbed scanner that reads each 
item’s barcode; for produce, the item category is entered, the item weighed, and the price 
then processed by the scanner. If the shopper forgets to scan an item, an alarm will alert the 
supervisor.29
The combination of self-scanning and mobile technologies in the form of scan-as-you-shop 
yield a form of self-checkout. Also, customers can scan items as they select items from store 
shelves and add to their cart using a smartphone app. They can tap to redeem the digital coupons 
offered by the retailer’s loyalty program that they had selected earlier. Those customers can pay 
at a self-checkout unit using cash or saved payment data from their mobile wallet, get a receipt, 
and get cash back—as in an ATM—before exiting the store. It is an easier, quicker, and automated 
experience for customers and allows retailers to standardize payments, reward redemptions, and

personalize product recommendations based on prior purchases via mobile marketing campaigns 
to the individual customer.30
Other technological innovations also influence retail interactions. Here are three examples:
▶
▶Many retailers think they have the answer to the problem of finding the perfect gift—the 
electronic gift card. Sales revenues in the gift card industry are over $100 billion annually. 
Almost 93 percent of consumers have received or given a gift card each year. Gift cards spur 
buyers into making new purchases, often within the first 90 days, and most consumers spend 
more than the gift card amount.31 Some retailers now offer a gift-card exchange to customers 
who can swap physical gift cards issued by other firms (sometimes competitors) at a dis-
count.32 Retailers promote and sell gift cards as a means to increase sales, improve cash flow, 
and manage inventory. Retailers may even offer virtual gift cards through Web sites and mobile 
apps delivered to recipients by E-mail, text, Facebook post, or tweet.
▶
▶Interactive electronic kiosks (discussed in Chapter 6) are widely used and accounted for 
more than 40 percent of the $1.2 billion global interactive kiosk market as of 2014.33 Smart 
kiosks equipped with sensors are able to collect and analyze data from customers, display 
product recommendations, and place orders to customers engaged through the entire path 
to purchase. Reasons for smart kiosk popularity include increased customer preference for 
self-service (e.g., hotels, airports, restaurants); a better interaction of customers with kiosks 
in stores to place online orders (e.g., Lands’ End, Staples); access to product information 
(e.g., Staples); and the ability to customize products (e.g., Dr. Scholl’s FootMapping kiosks). 
Smart kiosks reduce or eliminate the need for in-store personnel to do mundane tasks, thus 
reducing costs. However, mobile apps pose a threat to kiosks. Many tasks performed at 
kiosks can be done using smartphone apps that require very low investments for retailers.

gift card (www

PART 1  •  AN OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC RETAIL MANAGEMENT
Some kiosk-mobile–integrated uses like Amazon Lockers use mobile apps to communicate 
passcodes and locations to customers and kiosks as dispensing or collection centers that 
interact with them.34
▶
▶More retailers are using Web portals to exchange information with suppliers. For example, 
ChainDrugStore.net serves a network of pharmacy stakeholders through its industry Web site, 
hub.pharmacyfocus.com, to provide efficient pharmacy purchasing, dispensing, reimburse-
ment, and contracting. These portals provide a set of online tools designed to streamline com-
munications, drive analytics and proprietary business intelligence, and manage the day-to-day 
data requirements of a pharmacy network. They work with more than 300 manufacturers, 
wholesalers, and managed care organizations to positively impact pharmacy purchasing, 
dispensing, reimbursement, and contracting strategy by secure online communications, ana-
lytics, and proprietary business intelligence tools. ChainDrugStore.net is the link with more 
than 100,000 stores and pharmacies.35
ETHICAL PERFORMANCE AND RELATIONSHIPS IN RETAILING
Ethical challenges fall into three interconnected categories: Ethics relates to the retailer’s moral 
principles and values. Social responsibility involves acts benefiting society. Consumerism entails 
protecting consumer rights. “Good” behavior depends not only on the retailer but also on the 
expectations of the community in which it does business.
Throughout our book, “Ethics in Retailing” boxes and chapter discussions provide an oppor-
tunity to look at ethical issues. Here, we study the broader impact of ethics, social responsibil-
ity, and consumerism. Visit our blog for posts on ethical challenges (www.bermanevansretail 
.com).
Ethics
In dealing with their constituencies (customers, the general public, employees, suppliers, competitors, 
and others), retailers have a moral obligation to act ethically. Furthermore, due to the media attention 
paid to firms’ behavior and the high expectations people have today, a failure to be ethical may lead 
to adverse publicity, lawsuits, the loss of customers, and a lack of self-respect among employees.
When a retailer has a sense of ethics, it acts in a trustworthy, fair, honest, and respectful man-
ner with each of its constituencies. Executives must articulate to employees and channel partners 
which kinds of behavior are acceptable and which are not. The best way to avoid unethical acts 
is for firms to have written ethics codes, to distribute them to employees and channel partners, 
to monitor behavior, and to punish poor behavior—and for top managers to be highly ethical in 
their own conduct. See Figure 2-11.
Society often may deem certain behavior to be unethical even if laws do not forbid it. Most 
observers would agree that practices such as these are unethical (and sometimes illegal, too):
▶
▶Raising prices on scarce products after a natural disaster such as a hurricane.
▶
▶Not having adequate merchandise on hand when a sale is advertised.
▶
▶Charging high prices in low-income areas because consumers there do not have the transpor-
tation mobility to shop out of their neighborhoods.
A new tabletop technology promises to feed customers’ phones 
while they’re feeding their appetites. Called Entercharge, the 
tabletop smart system was introduced in 2016 and underwent 
testing at 30 Los Angeles restaurants. The device won the Master-
Card Challenge at the 2014 Fintech Hackathon, then spent a year 
in the pilot stage, conducting initial testing at a trendy downtown 
L.A. juice bar, Green Grotto. While Entercharge functions as a 
phone-charging station, the version debuting in spring 2016 uses 
iBeacons and Bluetooth for bill payment and customer couponing 
via smartphones. In addition, Entercharge will establish a “smart 
restaurant” experience, where the kiosk recognizes returning din-
ers’ phones and creates a personalized dining experience.

▶Selling alcohol and tobacco products to children.

▶Having a salesperson pose as a market researcher when engaged in telemarketing.
▶
▶Defaming competitors.
▶
▶Selling refurbished merchandise as new.
▶
▶Pressuring employees to push high-profit items, even if these items are not the best products.
▶
▶Selling information from a customer database to other parties.
Many trade associations promote ethics codes to member firms. For example, here are some 
provisions of the Direct Marketing Association’s ethics code:
Article 1: “All offers should be clear, honest, and complete.”
Article 8: “All contacts should disclose the name of the sponsor and each purpose of the con-
tact; no one should make offers or solicitations in the guise of one purpose when the intent is 
a different purpose.”
Article 24: “No sweepstakes promotion should represent that a recipient or entrant has won a 
prize or that any entry stands a greater chance of winning a prize than any other entry when 
this is not the case.”
Article 32: “Firms should be sensitive to the issue of consumer privacy.”36
Social Responsibility
A retailer exhibiting social responsibility acts in the best interests of society—as well as itself. 
The challenge is to balance corporate citizenship with a fair level of profits for stockholders, 
management, and employees. Some forms of social responsibility are virtually cost-free, such 
as having employees participate in community events or disposing of waste products in a more 
careful way. Some are more costly, such as making donations to charitable groups or giving away 
goods and services to a school. Still others mean going above and beyond the letter of the law, 
such as having free loaner wheelchairs for persons with disabilities besides legally mandated 
wheelchair accessibility to retail premises.
Most retailers know socially responsible acts do not go unnoticed. Although the acts may not 
stimulate greater patronage for firms with weak strategies, they can be a customer inducement for 
those otherwise viewed as “me too” entities. It may also be possible to profit from good deeds. If a 
retailer donates excess inventory to a charity that cares for the ill, it can take a tax deduction equal 
to the cost of the goods plus one-half the difference between the cost and the retail price. To do 
this, a retailer must be a corporation and the charity must use the goods and not sell or trade them.
The Direct Marketing 
Association makes its 
complete ethics code 
available at its Web site 
(www.dmaresponsibility 
.org/Guidelines).

PART 1  •  AN OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC RETAIL MANAGEMENT
There are some fine examples of socially responsible retailers. Ronald McDonald House 
Charities (RMHC) has been McDonald’s Charity of Choice since 1974. During its national fun-
draisers, RMHC has collected over $200 million in donations from customers at participating 
restaurants. Portions of the operating costs of RMHC are funded by McDonald’s owners/opera-
tors. McDonald’s founded Ronald McDonald House so families can stay at a low-cost facility 
instead of a costly hotel when seriously ill children get medical treatment away from home. 
Ronald McDonald House Charities has served 5.7 million children and their families in its 334 
RMHC facilities.37
Target and CVS are among the firms that no longer sell cigarettes. Walmart has specific envi-
ronmental goals related to reducing waste sent to landfills, obtaining electricity from renewable 
energy resources, reducing emissions, and developing a more sustainable food system.38 In 1999, 
Whole Foods Market was the first supermarket chain to collaborate with the Marine Stewardship 
Council, the leading certification program for sustainable wild-caught seafood. Whole Foods has 
also stopped selling especially vulnerable species of fish.
Consumerism
Consumerism involves the activities of government, business, and other organizations to pro-
tect people from practices infringing on their rights as consumers. These actions recognize that 
consumers have basic rights that should be safeguarded. As President Kennedy said more than 
50 years ago, consumers have the right to safety (protection against unsafe conditions and haz-
ardous goods and services); the right to be informed (protection against fraudulent, deceptive, 
and incomplete information, advertising, and labeling); the right to choose (access to a variety of 
goods, services, and retailers); and the right to be heard (consumer feedback, both positive and 
negative, to the firm and to government agencies).
Here are some reasons that retailers and their channel partners need to avoid business prac-
tices violating these rights and to do all they can to understand and protect them:
▶
▶Some retail practices are covered by legislation. One major law is the Americans with Dis-
abilities Act (ADA), which mandates that persons with disabilities be given appropriate access 
to retailing facilities. As Title III of the Act states (www.ada.gov/cguide.htm), “Public accom-
modations [retail stores] must comply with basic nondiscrimination requirements that prohibit 
exclusion, segregation, and unequal treatment. They also must comply with specific require-
ments related to architectural standards for new and altered buildings; reasonable modifica-
tions to policies, practices, and procedures; effective communication with people with hearing, 
vision, or speech disabilities; and other access requirements. Additionally, public accommoda-
tions must remove barriers in existing buildings where it is easy to do so without much dif-
ficulty or expense, given the public accommodation’s resources.” The ADA affects entrances, 
vertical transportation, width of aisles, and store displays. See Figure 2-12.
▶
▶People are more apt to patronize firms perceived as customer-oriented and not to shop with 
ones seen as “greedy.”
▶
▶Consumers are more knowledgeable, price-conscious, and selective than in the past. Online 
customer reviews and social media now attract a lot of shopper interest.
▶
▶Large retailers may be viewed as indifferent to consumers. They may not provide enough 
personal attention for shoppers or may have inadequate control over employees.
The Ronald McDonald 
House program (www 
.rmhc.org) is one of 
the most respected 
community outreach 
efforts in retailing.
Learn more about ADA 
(www.ada.gov).
UK high-street supermarkets have been taking the lead in work-
ing with local communities. Tesco has in-store food collection 
points for donations to local food banks, while Asda, Aldi, and 
Sainsbury’s donate their surplus food stocks to charities. Marks 
and Spencer has set up clothes recycling schemes. Many of the 
retailers have been involved in one-off schemes such as Morri-
sons donating $23 million of gardening equipment to over 26,500 
schools. Tesco shoppers who bought new school uniforms saw 
a second school uniform donated to a child in the region of the 
world where the uniform was manufactured. Marks and Spen-
cer’s Global Community Programme provided training to people 
in regions where products were sourced by the chain.

▶
▶For some shoppers, the increasing use of self-service causes frustration.
▶
▶Innovative technology is unsettling to many consumers, who must learn new shopping behav-
ior (such as how to use electronic video kiosks).
▶
▶Retailers are in direct customer contact, so they are often blamed for and asked to resolve 
problems caused by manufacturers (such as defective products).
One troublesome issue for consumers involves how retailers handle customer privacy. A 
consumer-oriented approach, with elements such as these, can reduce negative shopper feelings:
1.	 Consumers should be clearly informed about the way that each company handles its custom-
ers’ data. This involves transparency (full disclosure).
2.	 Consumers should be able to decide what kinds of information they want to receive from the 
company being asked to opt-in (choose to received information) rather than having to opt-in 
(by actively informing a firm that no information should be sent).
3.	 Consumers should feel confident that their personal are protected and kept secure by the 
company, and that only limited information is passed on to third parties (such as shippers).
4.	 Consumers should able to correct any personal data stored on them that they believe to be 
incorrect.
5.	 Consumer feedback on their personal private information should be promptly and properly 
addressed by the company.39
To avoid customer relations problems, many retailers have devised programs to protect con-
sumer rights without waiting for government or consumer pressure to do so. Here are some examples.
More than 45 years ago, the Giant Food supermarket chain built on the consumer bill of four 
rights stated by President Kennedy, which it still follows today: (1) the right to safety; (2) the right 
to be informed; (3) the right to choose;  and the (4) right to be heard. It has added a fifth right: the 
right to redress, which offers shoppers a money-back guarantee policy on products.40
In recent years, wireless phone service retailers have become much more aggressive in 
­competing with one another—especially the big four of AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint. 
They run television and other ads all the time. In an attempt to stand out, especially against giants 
AT&T and Verizon, T-Mobile decided to add a consumerism thrust to its company positioning by 
devising the industry’s first customer bill of rights. T-Mobile’s consumer bill of rights focuses on 
such issues as not having to sign a service contract, offering the ability to grade to a new phone at 
any time, allowing unused data to carry over, allowing free roaming around the world, and more.41
A number of retailers have enacted programs to test merchandise for such attributes as value, 
quality, misrepresentation of contents, safety, and durability. Sears, Walmart, Macy’s, and Target

are just a few of those doing testing. Among the other consumerism activities undertaken by many 
retailers are setting clear procedures for handling customer complaints, sponsoring consumer 
education programs, and training personnel to interact properly with customers.
Consumer-oriented activities are not limited to large chains; small firms can also be involved. 
A local toy store can separate toys by age group. A grocery store can set up displays featuring 
environmentally safe detergents. A neighborhood restaurant can cook foods in low-fat vegetable 
oil. A sporting goods store can give a money-back guarantee on exercise equipment, so people 
can try it at home.
Chapter Summary
1.	 To explain what value really means and highlight its 
pivotal role in retailers’ building and sustaining rela-
tionships. Sellers undertake a series of activities and 
processes to provide a given level of value for the con-
sumer. Consumers then perceive the value offered by 
sellers, based on the perceived benefits received ver-
sus the prices paid. Perceived value varies by type of 
shopper.
A retail value chain represents the total bundle of 
benefits offered by a channel of distribution. It com-
prises shopping location, ambience, customer service, 
the products/brands carried, product quality, the in-
stock position, shipping, prices, the retailer’s image, 
and so forth. Some elements of a retail value chain are 
visible to shoppers; others are not. An expected retail 
strategy represents the minimum value chain elements 
a given customer segment expects from a given retailer 
type. An augmented retail strategy includes the extra 
elements that differentiate retailers. A potential retail 
strategy includes value chain elements not yet perfected 
in the retailer’s industry category.
2.	 To describe how both customer relationships and chan-
nel relationships may be nurtured in today’s highly 
competitive marketplace. For relationship retailing to 
work, enduring relationships are needed with other 
channel members as well as with customers. More 
retailers now realize loyal customers are the backbone 
of their business.
To engage in relationship retailing with consumers, 
these factors should be considered: the customer base, 
customer service, customer satisfaction, and loyalty 
programs and defection rates. In terms of the customer 
base, all customers are not equal. Some shoppers are 
worth more nurturing than others; they are a retailer’s 
core customers.
Customer service has two components: expected 
services and augmented services. The attributes of 
personnel who interact with customers, as well as the 
number and variety of customer services offered, have 
a big impact on the relationship created. Some firms 
have improved customer service by empowering per-
sonnel, giving them the authority to bend some rules. In 
devising a strategy, a retailer must make broad decisions 
and then enact specific tactics as to credit, delivery, and 
so forth.
Customer satisfaction occurs when the value and 
customer service provided in a retail experience meet 
or exceed expectations. Otherwise, the consumer will 
be dissatisfied.
Loyalty programs reward the best customers—those 
with whom a retailer wants to develop long-lasting rela-
tionships. To succeed, they must complement a sound 
value-driven retail strategy. By studying defections, a 
firm can learn how many customers it is losing and why 
they no longer patronize the firm.
Members of a distribution channel jointly represent a 
value delivery system. Each one depends on the others; 
and every activity must be enumerated and responsibil-
ity assigned. Small retailers may have to use suppliers 
outside the normal channel to get the items they want 
and gain supplier support. A delivery system is as good 
as its weakest link. A relationship-oriented technique 
that some manufacturers and retailers are trying, espe-
cially supermarket chains, is category management.
3.	 To examine the differences in relationship building 
between goods and service retailers. Goods retailing 
focuses on selling tangible products. Service retailing 
involves transactions where consumers do not purchase 
or acquire ownership of tangible products.
There are three kinds of service retailing: rented-
goods services, where consumers lease goods for a 
given time; owned-goods services, where goods owned 
by consumers are repaired, improved, or maintained; 
and nongoods services, where consumers experience 
personal services rather than possess them. Customer 
service refers to activities that are part of the total retail 
experience. With service retailing, services are sold to 
the consumer.
The unique features of service retailing that influ-
ence relationship building and retention are the intan-
gible nature of many services, the inseparability of 
some service providers and their services, the perish-
ability of many services, and the variability of many 
services.

4.	 To discuss the impact of technology on relationships 
in retailing. Technology is advantageous when it leads 
to an improved information flow between retailers and 
suppliers, and between retailers and customers, and to 
faster, smoother transactions.
Electronic banking involves both the use of ATMs 
and the instant processing of retail purchases. It allows 
centralized records and lets customers complete trans-
actions 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, at various sites. 
Technology is also changing the nature of supplier–
retailer–customer interactions via point-of-sale equip-
ment, self-scanning, electronic gift cards, interactive 
kiosks, and other innovations.
5.	 To consider the interplay between retailers’ ethical per-
formance and relationships in retailing. Retailer chal-
lenges fall into three related categories: Ethics relates to 
a firm’s moral principles and values. Social responsibil-
ity has to do with benefiting society. And consumer-
ism entails the protection of consumer rights. “Good” 
behavior is based not only the firm’s practices but also 
on the expectations of the community in which it does 
business.
Ethical retailers act in a trustworthy, fair, honest, and 
respectful way. Firms are more apt to avoid unethical 
behavior if they have written ethics codes, communicate 
them to employees, monitor and punish poor behav-
ior, and have ethical executives. Retailers perform in a 
socially responsible manner when they act in the best 
interests of society through recycling and conservation 
programs and other efforts. Consumerism activities 
involve government, business, and independent organi-
zations. Four consumer rights are basic: to safety, to be 
informed, to choose, and to be heard.

Questions for Discussion
1.	 Value is embodied by a series of activities and processes—a 
value chain. This provides a certain value to the consumer. 
What does the value chain comprise, and what features are 
readily recognizable as far as consumers are concerned?
2.	 There are five potential pitfalls to avoid in planning a 
value-oriented retail strategy. Discuss these three:
a.	Planning value with just a price perspective.
b.	Providing value-enhancing services that customers do 
not want or will not pay extra for.
c.	Competing in the wrong value/price segment.
3.	 How do new and mature retailing businesses differ in 
terms of their treatment of core customers?
4.	 How would you differentiate between expected and aug-
mented customer service provisions? Why does customer 
service rely on the abilities of employees?

tion with your favorite restaurant?
6.	 As a retailer, how would you reward social media refer-
rals by customers?
7.	 What are the unique aspects of service retailing? Give 
an example of each.
8.	 What are the pros and cons of ATMs? As a retailer, 
would you want an ATM in your store? Why or why not?
9.	 Will the time come when most consumer purchases are 
made with self-scanners? Explain your answer.
10.	 Describe three unethical, but legal, acts on the part of 
retailers that you have recently encountered. How have 
you reacted in each case?
11.	 Differentiate between social responsibility and consum-
erism from the perspective of a retailer.
12.	 How would you deal with consumer concerns about pri-
vacy in their relationships with retailers?
Web-Based Exercise
Chinese shopping behavior focusses on price, and main-
stream retailers tend to emphasize deals and promotions to 
avoid profit reduction through haggling. Do some research 
on Chinese retail consumers and suggest how retailers 
could manage their relationship with consumers. How do 
Chinese consumers view their relationships with retailers?

APPENDIX
Planning for the Unique Aspects of 
Service Retailing
We present this appendix because service retailing in the United States and around the world 
is growing steadily and represents a large portion of overall retailing. U.S consumers spend 60 
percent of their after-tax income on such services as travel, recreation, personal care, education, 
medical care, and housing. Over 84 percent of the labor force works in services. Consumers spend 
billions of dollars each year to rent such products as power tools and party goods (coffee urns, 
silverware, wine glasses, etc.). There are 86,000 beauty and barber shops; 480,000 restaurants; 
and 53,000 commercial child care and 21,000 nonprofit child care facilities.1 Although automa-
tion has substantially reduced manufacturing labor costs, many services remain labor-intensive 
due to their personal nature.
Here, we look at the abilities required to be a successful service retailer, how to improve the 
performance of service retailers, and the strategy of a Baldrige Award winner.
Abilities Required to Be a Successful Service Retailer
The personal abilities required to succeed in service retailing are usually quite distinct from those 
in goods retailing, as shown here:
▶
▶With service retailing, the major value provided to the customer is some type of retailer ser-
vice, not the ownership of a physical product produced by a manufacturer.
▶
▶Specific skills are often required, and these skills may not be transferable from one type of 
service to another. Television repair technicians, beauticians, and accountants cannot easily 
change businesses or transfer skills. The owners of appliance stores, cosmetics stores, and 
toy stores (all goods retailers) would have an easier time than service retailers in changing 
and transferring their skills to another area.
▶
▶More service operators must possess licenses or certification to run their businesses. Barbers, 
real-estate brokers, dentists, attorneys, plumbers, and others must pass exams in their fields.
▶
▶Owners of service businesses must enjoy their jobs and have the aptitude for them. Because 
of the close personal contact with customers, these elements are essential and hard to fake.
Many service retailers can operate on lower overall investments and succeed on less yearly 
revenues than goods retailers. A firm with four outdoor tennis courts can operate with one worker 
who functions as clerk/cashier and maintenance person. A tax-preparation firm can succeed with 
one accountant. A watch repair business needs one repairperson. In each case, the owner may 
be the only skilled worker. Operating costs can be held down accordingly. On the other hand, a 
goods retailer needs a solid product assortment and inventory on hand, which may be costly and 
require storage facilities.
The time commitment of a service retailer differs by type of business opportunity. Some busi-
nesses, such as a self-service laundromat or a movie theater, require a low time commitment. Other 
businesses, such as house painting or a travel agency, require a large time commitment because 
personal service is the key to profitability. More service firms are in the high rather than the low 
time-investment category.
Improving the Performance of Service Retailers
Service tangibility can be increased by stressing service provider reliability, promoting a con-
tinuous theme (the Hertz #1 Club Gold), describing specific results (a car tune-up improving 
gas consumption by 1 mile per gallon), and offering warranties (hotels giving automatic refunds 
to unhappy guests). Airlines have Web sites where customers can select flights and make their 
reservations interactively. These sites are a tangible representation of the airlines and their logos.
Demand and supply can be better matched by offering similar services to market segments 
with different demand patterns (e.g., tourists versus residents). This can be done by offering 

	
CHAPTER 2   •  Building and Sustaining Relationships in Retailing	
69	
new services with demand patterns that are countercyclical from existing services (cross-country 
skiing during the winter at Denver golf resorts); new services that complement existing ones 
(beauty salons adding tanning booths); special deals during nonpeak times (midweek movie the-
ater prices); and new services not subject to existing capacity constraints (a 10-table restaurant 
starting a home catering service).
Standardizing services reduces their variability, makes it easier to set prices, and improves 
efficiency. Services can be standardized by clearly defining each task, determining the minimum 
and maximum times needed to complete each task, selecting the best order for tasks to be done, 
and noting the optimum time and quality of the entire service. Standardization has been success-
fully applied to such firms as quick-auto-service providers (oil change and tune-up firms), legal 
services (for house closings and similar proceedings), and emergency medical care centers. If 
services are standardized, there is often a trade-off (e.g., more consistent quality and convenience 
in exchange for less of a personal touch).
Besides standardizing services, retailers may be able to make services more efficient by 
automating them and substituting machinery for labor. Thus, real-estate attorneys often use word-
processing templates for common paragraphs in house closings. This means more consistency 
in the way documents look, time savings, and neater documents with fewer errors. Among the 
service firms that automate at least part of their operations are banks, car washes, bowling alleys, 
airlines, phone services, real-estate brokers, and hotels.
One way that services can increase customer loyalty is by better understanding and react-
ing to shopper complaints. This strategy enables a service operator to rectify problem areas that 
would otherwise be unknown. It also makes it possible for the service operator to offer restitution 
to the consumer so that he/she will remain loyal. Unfortunately, too often, a dissatisfied customer 
will find it easier to switch to a competitor (or complain to friends and family) as opposed to 
complaining to the service operator. Retailers can reduce the negative effect of a service-related 
failure by (1) apologizing, (2) reviewing the complaint, (3) fixing the problem and following up 
to show concern, (4) documenting the problem so that the poor situation will not recur, and (5) 
communicating with these customers and treating them in a fair manner. Employee politeness and 
sincerity are closely related to customer satisfaction following a service failure.2
The location of a service retailer must be carefully considered. Sometimes, as with TV 
repairs, house painting, and lawn care, the service is “delivered” to the customer. The firm’s 
location becomes a client’s home, and the actual retail office is rather insignificant. Many clients 
might never even see a service firm’s office; they make contact by phone or personal visits, and 
customer convenience is optimized. The firm incurs travel expenses, but it also has low (or no) rent 
and does not have to maintain store facilities, set up displays, and so on. Other service retailers 
are visited on “specific-intent” shopping trips. Although a customer may be concerned about the 
convenience of a service location, he or she usually does not select a skilled practitioner such as 
a doctor or a lawyer based on the location. It is common for doctors and attorneys to have offices 
in their homes or near hospitals or court buildings. A small store can often be used because little 
or no room is needed for displaying merchandise. A travel agency may have six salespeople and 
book millions of dollars in trips, but fit into a 500-square-foot store.
Satisfaction-based pricing recognizes and reduces customer perceptions of uncertainty that 
service intangibility magnifies. It involves service guarantees, benefit-driven pricing, and flat-
rate pricing.3 Relationship pricing encourages long-term relationships with valuable customers. 
It entails long-term contracts and price bundling. Efficiency pricing shares cost savings with 
customers that arise from the firm’s efficiently executing service tasks. It is related to the concept 
of cost leadership.
Negotiated pricing occurs when a retailer works out pricing arrangements with individual 
customers because a unique or complex service is involved and a one-time price must be agreed 
on. Unlike traditional pricing (whereby each consumer pays the same price for a standard service), 
each consumer may pay a different price under negotiated pricing (depending on the nature of 
the unique service). A moving company charges different fees, depending on the distance of the 
move, who packs the breakable furniture, the use of stairs versus an elevator, access to highways, 
and the weight of furniture.
Contingency pricing is an arrangement whereby the retailer does not get paid until after 
the service is performed and payment is contingent on the service’s being satisfactory. A real-
estate broker earns a fee only when a house purchaser (who is ready, willing, and able to buy) is 

70	
PART 1  •  AN OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC RETAIL MANAGEMENT
presented to the house seller. Several brokers may show a house to prospective buyers, but only 
the broker who actually sells the house earns a commission. This technique presents risks to a 
retailer because considerable time and effort may be spent without payment. A broker may show 
a house 25 times, not sell it, and therefore not be paid.
Dynamic pricing uses data from customers, as well as ongoing analyses of reservations (such 
as airlines and hotels), to vary prices on a customer-by-customer basis. Prices can differ for the 
same service, such as airline travel, based on when a customer makes a reservation (early or late), 
the time of day and day of the week of the flight, and whether the service provider feels it needs 
to reduce price to fill otherwise empty facilities (seats on a plane or at a show).4
One customer type is often beyond the reach of some service firms: the do-it-yourselfer. And 
the number of do-it-yourselfers in the United States is growing, as service costs increase (and due 
to the slow-growth economy). The do-it-yourselfer performs repairs on his or her car, paints the 
house, mows the lawn, and makes all vacation plans. Goods-oriented discount retailers do well by 
selling supplies to these people, but service retailers suffer because labor is done by the customer.
The Strategy of Pal’s Sudden Service: Baldrige Award  
Winner5
The Baldrige Award is given by the president of the United States to businesses—manufacturing 
and service, small and large—and to education and healthcare organizations that apply and are 
judged to be outstanding in seven areas: leadership; strategic planning; customer and market focus; 
measurement, analysis, and knowledge management; human resource focus; process manage-
ment; and results. One of the few retailers to win the award is Pal’s Sudden Service—based in 
Kingsport, Tennessee—a privately owned, quick-service restaurant chain with 26 locations and 
about 1,000 employees (as of 2016). The firm distinguishes itself by offering competitively priced 
food of consistently high quality, delivered quickly, cheerfully, and without error.
At Pal’s, customer waiting time from placing an order to picking it up is four times faster than 
the second-fastest quick-serve U.S. restaurant; at the drive-up window, where orders are placed, 
the average turnaround time is 12 seconds. Despite the speedy service, Pal’s makes an error only 
once in every 3,600 orders. That is 10 times better than the average fast-food restaurant.
Pal’s has a process for every organizational and operational activity. Its Business Excellence 
Process is the key integrating force and ensures that customer needs are met in each transaction. 
Carried out under the leadership of Pal’s top executives and its owner-operators, this process spans 
all facets of operations from strategic planning (done annually) to online quality control.
The company’s success in significantly reducing turnover among frontline production and 
service personnel, most of whom are between the ages of 16 and 18 and work part-time, is a big 
advantage. Job candidates must pass a 60-question psychometric test before being considered 
for training. Owner-operators and assistant managers have primary responsibility for training, 
based on a four-step model: Show it, do it, evaluate it, and perform it again. New employees get  
120 hours of training before working on their own and must be certified for each specific job 
task. At the assistant manager level, job turnover is 1.4 percent; at the front-line level it is  
just 32 percent.

Strategic Planning  
in Retailing
Strategic planning in retailing is a complex process with a number of intertwined factors, 
both controllable and uncontrollable. Previously, retailers were focused on in-store marketing 
by trying to influence consumers’ buying decisions as they shopped—typically through 
flashy product displays, special promotions at the end of the aisle, and attention-grabbing 
packaging on the shelf.
Today, many consumers approach their shopping differently, and retailers need to plan 
and adapt their strategies accordingly. Consumers not only go online to shop; they also go 
online to begin the shopping process and sometimes just to hear what others have to say. 
The dominance of the online channel in some retail categories such as consumer electronics, 
travel, and entertainment has damaged, and in some cases obliterated, business models 
of established retailers and led to the popularity of pure online firms. In other product 
categories, where the online channel has been less disruptive, the ongoing digitization 
due to mobile and social-media technologies is forcing additional planning and investment 
in retailers’ omnichannel strategies as consumers use channels and devices (laptops, 
smartphones, and tablets) interchangeably and seamlessly during their search and purchase 
process. Retailers have no control over this usage. Developing long-term relationships with 
customers or brand intimacy is the key. Brand intimacy describes an essential relationship 
between a person and a brand (this can include retailers). Brand intimacy transcends usage, 
purchase, and loyalty. According to brand agency MBLM, the Brand Intimacy Agency  
(www.mblm.com), intimate brands create enhanced business performance.

PART 1  •  AN OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC RETAIL MANAGEMENT
So, which brands succeed at developing intimate connections? That depends on gender. 
Women connect with a broad and more mature staple of brands that involve more aspects 
of their daily lives. Among female consumers, Apple is the most intimate brand followed by 
Disney, Amazon, Whole Foods, and Toyota, according to MBLM. The top five brands for men 
are Harley-Davidson, Apple, Toyota, Nintendo, and Lexus. Rina Plapler, a MLBM partner, insists 
that how people form bonds with brands transcends gender. “It’s important to see the types of 
brands that women tend to connect with and how age and income influence brand choices. It 
helps retailers to better promote goods and services and form deep brand attachments.”
Age and income play a large role in determining brand preferences. Among female Millennials 
ages 18 to 34, the top five brands are Apple, Amazon, Sephora, Target, and Whole Foods; 
18- to 34-year-old men select Nintendo, Samsung, PlayStation, Xbox, and YouTube as their top 
five. Women earning $34,000 to $49,000 are most connected, with L’Oréal, Revlon, and Dove 
in their top five. Among those with incomes of $50,000 to $75,000, leaders include Apple, 
Starbucks, Olay, Coca-Cola, and Netflix. And for those earning $75,000 to $150,000, Apple, 
Sephora, Amazon, Target, and Clinique top the list.1
Overview
In this chapter, we cover strategic retail planning—the foundation of our book—in detail. As noted 
in Chapter 1, a retail strategy is the overall plan or framework of action that guides a retailer. 
Ideally, it will cover at least 1 year and outline the retailer’s mission, goals, consumer market, 
overall and specific activities, and control mechanisms. Without a defined and well-integrated 
strategy, a firm may be unable to cope with the marketplace. The U.S. Small Business Administra-
tion recommends that every business, irrespective of whether it intends to seek financial support 
from lenders or investors, should have comprehensive and thoughtful business plan. It serves as 
a roadmap for the next 3 to 5 years and helps thoughtful and objective decision making on many 
key business elements, including:
(1) What you will need to do to get started and what resources (time, money, etc.) you will 
need to expend. (2) What it will take for your business to make a profit and how long that 
will take. (3) What information potential customers, vendors, and investors will need to know 
in order for you to effectively market your business. Many other factors critical to business 
success depend on your plan: outside funding, credit from suppliers, management of your 
operation and finances, promotion and marketing of your business, and achievement of your 
goals and objectives. The U.S. Small Business Association provides a step-by-step interac-
tive guide Business Plan Tool to help entrepreneurs get started on their planning process.2
The process of strategic retail planning has several attractive features:
1.	 It provides a thorough analysis of the requirements for doing business for different types of 
retailers.
2.	 It outlines retailer goals.
3.	 A firm determines how to differentiate itself from competitors and develop an offering that 
appeals to a group of customers.
4.	 The legal, economic, and competitive environment is studied.
5.	 A firm’s total efforts are coordinated.
6.	 Crises are anticipated and often minimized or avoided.
Strategic planning can be done by the owner of a firm, professional management, or a com-
bination of the two. Even among family businesses, the majority of high-growth companies have 
strategic plans.
The steps in planning and enacting a retail strategy are interdependent; a firm often starts 
with a general plan that gets more specific as options and payoffs become clearer. In this chapter, 
we cover each step in developing a retail strategy, as shown in Figure 3-1. Given the ­importance 
of global retailing, a chapter appendix explores the special dimensions of strategic planning 
in a global environment. Visit our blog (www.bermanevansretail.com) for several links on  
strategic planning.

SITUATION ANALYSIS
Situation analysis is a candid evaluation of the opportunities and threats facing a prospective or 
existing retailer. It seeks to answer two general questions: What is the firm’s current status? In which 
direction should it be heading? Situation analysis means being guided by an organizational mission, 
evaluating ownership and management options, and outlining the goods/service category to be sold.
A good strategy anticipates and adapts to both the opportunities and threats in a changing 
business environment. Opportunities are marketplace openings that exist because other retail-
ers have not yet capitalized on them. Ikea does well because it is the pioneer firm in offering a 
huge selection of furniture at discount prices. Threats are environmental and marketplace factors 
that can adversely affect retailers if they do not react to them (and, sometimes, even if they do). 
Single-screen movie theaters have virtually disappeared because they have been unable to fend 
off multiscreen theaters. Movies available via pay-per-view services and streaming movies by 
subscription services like Netflix and Amazon are additional threats to the movie theater industry.
A firm needs to spot trends early enough to satisfy customers and stay ahead of competi-
tors, yet not so early that shoppers are not ready for changes or that false trends are perceived. 
Merchandising shifts—such as stocking fad items—are more quickly enacted than changes in a 
firm’s location, price, or promotion strategy. A new retailer can adapt to trends easier than existing 
ones with established images, ongoing leases, and space limitations. Well-prepared small firms 
can compete with large retailers due to their nimbleness.
In situation analysis, especially for a new retailer or one thinking about a major strategic 
change, an honest, in-depth self-assessment is vital. It is all right for a person or company to be 
ambitious and aggressive, but overestimating one’s abilities and prospects may be harmful—if it 
results in entry into the wrong retail business, inadequate resources, or misjudging competitors.
Organizational Mission
An organizational mission is a retailer’s commitment to a type of business and to a distinctive 
role in the marketplace. It is reflected in the firm’s attitude toward consumers, employees, sup-
pliers, competitors, government, and others. A clear mission lets a firm gain a customer following

and distinguish itself from competitors. Figure 3-2 highlights some inspirational quotes from 
prominent executives that retailers should keep in mind when devising their missions.
One major decision is whether to base a business around the goods and services sold or 
around consumer needs. A person opening a hardware business must decide if, in addition to 
hardware products, a line of bathroom vanities should be stocked. A traditionalist might not carry 
vanities because they seem unconnected to the proposed business. But if the store is to be a do-it-
yourself home improvement center, vanities are a logical part of the mix. That store would carry 
any relevant items the consumer wants.
A second major decision is whether a retailer wants a place in the market as a leader or a 
follower. It could seek to offer a unique strategy, such as Taco Bell becoming the first national

quick-serve Mexican food chain. Or it could emulate practices of competitors but do a better job 
executing them, such as a local fast-food Mexican restaurant offering five-minute guaranteed 
service and a cleanliness pledge.
A third decision involves market scope. Large chains often seek a broad customer base (due 
to their resources and recognition). It is often best for small retailers and startups to focus on a 
narrower customer base, so they can compete in a local versus a regional marketplace.
Although the development of an organizational mission is the first step in the planning pro-
cess, a firm’s mission should be continually reviewed and adjusted to reflect changing company 
goals and a dynamic retail environment. Here is an example of how Amazon’s organizational 
mission has evolved since it launched online in July 1995.
Its initial mission was to use the Internet to transform book buying into the fastest, easiest, 
and most enjoyable shopping experience possible.3 Since then, Amazon has grown in sales 
revenues ($100 billion in 2015)4 and in product offerings to be the seventh largest retailer 
in the world. As a result, its mission statement has become much broader, but the focus and 
commitment to customer satisfaction and the delivery of an educational shopping experi-
ence has remained.5
Ownership and Management Alternatives
An essential aspect of situation analysis is assessing ownership and management alternatives, 
including whether to form a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation—and whether to start 
a new business, buy an existing business, or become a franchisee.6 Management options include 
owner-manager versus professional manager and centralized versus decentralized structures. There 
is no one best ownership type for a retailer; the type of legal structure impacts taxation, personal 
liability, record keeping, and the ability to raise money. The limitations of a particular form of 
ownership can often be overcome. For instance, a sole proprietor can buy insurance coverage to 
reduce liability exposure. Astute entrepreneurs re-evaluate their choice of entity as their business 
evolves. The Small Business Association (SBA) and an experienced attorney or tax advisor are 
valuable sources of information and advice for a business.7
A sole proprietorship is an unincorporated retail firm owned by one person. All benefits, 
profits, risks, and costs accrue to that individual. It is simple to form, fully controlled by the owner, 
operationally flexible, easy to dissolve, and subject to single taxation by the government. It makes 
the owner personally liable for legal claims from suppliers, creditors, and others; it can also lead 
to limited capital and expertise.
A partnership is an unincorporated retail firm owned by two or more persons, each 
with a financial interest. Partners share benefits, profits, risks, and costs. Advantages include 
the following: Responsibility and expertise are divided among multiple principals, there is a 
greater capability for raising funds than with a proprietorship, the format is simpler to form 
than a corporation, and it is subject to single taxation by the government. Depending on the 
type of partnership, it can make owners personally liable for legal claims, can be dissolved 
due to a partner’s death or a disagreement, it binds all partners to actions made by any indi-
vidual partner acting on behalf of the firm, and it usually has less ability to raise capital than 
a corporation.
See how the Neiman 
Marcus Web site (www 
.neimanmarcus.com) is 
consistent with its upscale 
mission.
The skill set of retail executives needs to match the needs of the 
organization, as well as the life-cycle stage of the firm (growing, 
mature, or decline). Multiple-unit organizations (such as Saks 
Fifth Avenue and Off Saks, a discount unit of the parent organi-
zation) may have different objectives (such as moderate growth 
at Saks Fifth Avenue versus higher growth at Off Saks, based 
on sales per store unit as well as additional units). Likewise, 
an emerging retail format, Peapod (a home delivery service for 
groceries) requires different manager types than a traditional 
supermarket (such as corporate owner Stop & Shop). Fast-
growing units should be headed by “builders,” mature units by 
“maintainers, and declining businesses by “undertakers,” who 
specialize in selling off or redeploying assets in other locations 
and business units.
Develop job descriptions for the three different types of 
managers.

PART 1  •  AN OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC RETAIL MANAGEMENT
A corporation is a retail firm that is formally incorporated under state law. It is a legal entity 
apart from individual officers (or stockholders). Funds can be raised through the sale of stock; 
legal claims against individuals are not usually allowed; ownership transfer is relatively easy; the 
firm is more assured of long-term existence (if a founder leaves, retires, or dies); the use of pro-
fessional managers is encouraged; and unambiguous operating authority is outlined. Depending 
on the type of corporation, it is subject to double taxation (company earnings and stockholder 
dividends), faces more government rules, can require a complex process when established, may 
be viewed as impersonal, and may separate ownership from management. A closed corporation 
is run by a limited number of persons who control ownership; stock is not available to the public. 
In an open corporation, stock is traded and available to the public.
Sole proprietorships account for 74 percent of U.S. retail firms filing tax returns, partnerships 
for 6 percent, and corporations for 20 percent. Yet, sole proprietorships account for just 5 percent 
of total U.S. retail store sales, partnerships for 10 percent, and corporations for 85 percent.8
Starting a new business—being entrepreneurial—offers a retailer flexibility in location, 
operating style, product lines, customer markets, and other factors, and involves planning and 
implementing a strategy that is fully tailored to the owner’s desires and strengths. There may be 
high construction costs, a time lag until the business is opened and then until profits are earned, 
beginning with an unknown name, and having to form supplier relationships and amass an inven-
tory of goods. Figure 3-3 presents a checklist to consider when starting a retail business.
Buying an existing business allows a retailer to acquire an established company name, a 
customer following, a good location, trained personnel, and facilities; to operate immediately; 
to generate ongoing sales and profits; and to possibly get good lease terms or financing (at low

interest rates) from the seller. A few disadvantages are that fixtures may be older, there is less 
flexibility in enacting a strategy tailored to the new owner’s desires and strengths, and the growth 
potential of the business may be limited. One issue that must be examined in purchasing is the 
valuation of a firm’s existing inventory. Figure 3-4 shows a checklist to consider when purchasing 
an existing retail business.
By being a franchisee, a retailer can combine independent ownership with franchisor sup-
port such as strategic planning assistance; a known company name and loyal customer following; 
cooperative advertising and buying; and a regional, national, or global (rather than local) image. 
However, a franchisee contract may specify rigid operating standards, limit the product lines 
sold, and restrict supplier choice; the franchisor company is usually paid continuously (royalties); 
advertising fees may be required; and there is a possibility of termination by the franchisor if the 
agreement is not followed satisfactorily.
Strategically, the management format also has a dramatic impact. With an owner-manager, 
planning tends to be less formal and more intuitive, and many tasks are reserved for that person 
(such as employee supervision and cash management). With professional management, planning 
tends to be more formal and systematic. Yet, professional managers are more constrained in their 
authority than an owner-manager. In a centralized structure, planning clout lies with top manage-
ment or ownership; managers in individual departments have major input into decisions with a 
decentralized structure.
A comprehensive discussion of independent retailers, chains, franchises, leased departments, 
vertical marketing systems, and consumer cooperatives is included in Chapter 4.
Goods/Service Category
Before a prospective retail firm can fully design a strategic plan, it selects a goods/service 
­category—the line of business—in which to operate. Figure 3-5 shows the diversity of goods/
service categories. Chapter 5 examines the attributes of food-based and general merchandise store 
retailers. Chapter 6 focuses on Web, nonstore, and other forms of nontraditional retailing.

growing firms as they plan 
their strategies.

PART 1  •  AN OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC RETAIL MANAGEMENT
It is advisable to specify both a general goods/service category and a niche within that cat-
egory. Mercedes dealers are luxury auto retailers catering to upscale customers. Wendy’s is a chain 
known for its quality fast food with a menu emphasizing hamburgers. Motel 6 is a chain whose 
strength is inexpensive, clean, and centrally located hotel rooms with few frills.
A potential retail business owner should select a type of business that will allow him or her 
to match personal abilities, financial resources, and time availability with the requirements of 
that kind of business. Visit our blog (www.bermanevansretail.com) for links to many retail trade 
associations that represent various goods/service categories.
Personal Abilities
Personal abilities depend on an individual’s aptitude—the preference for a type of business and 
the potential to do well; education—formal learning about retail practices and policies; and experi-
ence—practical learning about retail practices and policies.
An individual who wants to run a business, shows initiative, and has the ability to react 
quickly to competitive developments will be suited to a different type of situation than a person 
who depends on others for advice and does not like to make fast decisions. The first individual 
could be an independent operator in a dynamic business such as apparel; the second might seek 
partners or a franchise and a stable business, such as a stationery store. Some people enjoy cus-
tomer interaction; they would dislike the impersonality of a self-service operation. Others enjoy 
the impersonality of mail-order or Web retailing.
In certain fields, education and experience requirements are specified by law. Stockbrokers, 
real-estate brokers, beauticians, pharmacists, and opticians must all satisfy educational or experi-
ence standards to show competency. For example, real-estate brokers are licensed after a review of 
their knowledge of real-estate practices and their ethical character. The legal designation “broker” 
does not depend on the ability to sell or have a customer-oriented demeanor.
Some skills can be learned; others are inborn. Accordingly, potential retail owners have to 
assess their skills and match them with the demands of a given business. This involves careful 
reflection about oneself. Partnerships may be best when two or more parties possess complemen-
tary skills. A person with selling experience may join with someone who has the operating skills

to start a business. Each partner has valued skills, but he or she may be unable to operate a retail 
entity without the expertise of the other.
Financial Resources
Many retail enterprises, especially new, independent ones, fail because the owners do not ade-
quately project the financial resources needed to open and operate the firm. Table 3-1 outlines 
some of the typical investments for a new retail venture.
Novice retailers tend to underestimate the value of a personal drawing account, which is 
used for the living expenses of the owner and his or her family in the early, unprofitable stage of 
a business. Because few new ventures are immediately profitable, the budget must include such 
expenditures. In addition, the costs of renovating an existing facility often are miscalculated. 
Underfunded firms usually invest in only essential renovations. This practice reduces the initial 
investment, but it may give the retailer a poor image. Merchandise assortment, as well as the 
types of goods and services sold, also affects the financial outlay. Finally, the use of a partnership, 
corporation, or franchise agreement will affect the investment.
Table 3-2 illustrates the financial requirements for a hypothetical used-car dealer. The initial 
personal savings investment of $300,000 would force many potential owners to rethink the choice 
of product category and the format of the firm: (1) The plans for a 40-car inventory reflect this 
owner’s desire for a balanced product line. If the firm concentrates on subcompact, compact, and 
intermediate cars, it can reduce inventory size and lower the investment, (2) the initial investment 
can be reduced by seeking a location whose facilities do not have to be modified, and (3) fewer 
financial resources are needed if a partnership or corporation is set up with other individuals, so 
that costs—and profits—are shared.
The U.S. Small Business Administration (www.sba.gov) assists businesses by guaranteeing 
thousands of loans each year. Such private companies as Wells Fargo and American Express also 
have financing programs specifically aimed at small businesses.
Time Demands
Time demands on retail owners (or managers) differ significantly by goods or service category. 
They are influenced both by consumer shopping patterns and by the ability of the owner or man-
ager to automate operations or delegate activities to others.
Many retailers must have regular weekend and evening hours to serve time-pressed shoppers. 
Gift shops, toy stores, and others have extreme seasonal shifts in their hours. Mail-order firms and 
those selling through the Web, which can process orders during any part of the day, have more 
flexible hours.
Some businesses require less owner involvement, including gas stations with no repair ser-
vices, coin-operated laundries, and movie theaters. The emphasis on automation, self-service,

standardization, and financial controls lets the owner reduce her or his time. Other businesses, 
such as hair salons, restaurants, and jewelry stores, require more active owner involvement.
Intensive owner participation can be the result of several factors:
▶
▶The owner may be the key service provider, with patrons attracted by his or her skills (the 
major competitive advantage). Delegating work to others will lessen consumer loyalty.
▶
▶Personal services are not easy to automate.
▶
▶Due to limited funds, the owner and his or her family must often undertake all operating 
functions for a small retail firm. Spouses and/or children work in 40 percent of family-owned 
businesses.
▶
▶In a business that operates on a cash basis, the owner must be around to avoid being cheated.
Off-hours activities are often essential. At a restaurant, some foods must be prepared in 
advance of the posted dining hours. An owner of a small computer store cleans, stocks shelves, 
and does the books during the hours the firm is closed. A prospective retail owner also has to 
examine his or her time preferences regarding stability versus seasonality, ideal working hours, 
and personal involvement.
OBJECTIVES
After situation analysis, a retailer sets objectives, the long-run and short-run performance targets 
it hopes to attain. This helps in strategy and translates the organizational mission into action. A 
firm can pursue goals related to one or more of these areas: sales, profit, satisfaction of publics, 
and image. Some retailers strive to achieve all these goals; others attend to a few and want to 
achieve them really well. Think about the array of goals for the Kroger Company: competitive 
pricing while maintaining profitability, long-term sales growth, and reducing operations costs.9
Sales
Sales objectives are related to the volume of goods and services a retailer sells. Growth, stability, 
and market share are the sales goals most often sought.
Kroger (www.kroger.com) 
is one of the leading food-
based retailers in the United 
States.

CHAPTER 3  •  Strategic Planning in Retailing 	
81	
Some retailers set sales growth as a top priority. They want to expand their business; therefore, 
they may place less emphasis on short-run profits. The assumption is that current investments 
will yield future sales and profits. A firm that does well often becomes interested in opening new 
units, expanding channel coverage and enlarging revenues. However, management skills and the 
personal touch are sometimes lost with overly fast expansion.
Stability is the goal of retailers that emphasize maintaining their sales volume, market share, 
price lines, and so on. Small retailers often seek stable sales that enable the owners to make a 
satisfactory living every year without downswings or upsurges. And certain firms develop a loyal 
customer following and are intent not on expanding but on continuing the approach that attracted 
the original consumers.
For some firms, market share—the percentage of total retail-category sales contributed by a given 
company—is another goal. It is often an objective only for large retailers or retail chains. The small 
retailer is more concerned with competition across the street than with total sales in a metropolitan area.
Sales objectives may be expressed in dollars and units. To reach dollar goals, a retailer can 
engage in a discount strategy (low prices and high unit sales), a moderate strategy (medium prices 
and medium unit sales), or a prestige strategy (high prices and low unit sales). In the long run, 
having unit sales as a performance target is vital. Dollar sales by year may be difficult to compare 
due to changing retail prices and inflation; unit sales are easier to compare. A firm with sales 
of $350,000 3 years ago and $500,000 today might assume it is doing well, until unit sales are 
computed: 10,000 then and 8,000 now.
Profit
With profitability objectives, retailers seek at least a minimum profit level during a designated 
period, usually a year. Profit may be expressed in dollars or as a percentage of sales. For a firm 
with yearly sales of $5 million and total costs of $4.2 million, pre-tax dollar profit is $800,000 and 
profits as a percentage of sales are 16 percent. If the profit goal is equal to or less than $800,000, 
or 16 percent, the retailer is satisfied. If the goal is higher, the firm has not attained the minimum 
desired profit and is dissatisfied.
Firms with large capital expenditures in land, buildings, and equipment often set return on 
investment (ROI) as a goal. Return on investment is the relationship between profits and the invest-
ment in capital items. A satisfactory rate of return is pre-defined and compared with the actual 
return at the end of the year or other period. For a retailer with annual sales of $5 million and 
expenditures (including payments for capital items) of $4 million, the yearly profit is $1 million. 
If the total capital investment is $10 million, ROI is $1 million/$10 million, or 10 percent per year. 
The goal must be 10 percent or less for the firm to be satisfied.
Operating efficiency may be expressed as 1– (operating expenses/company sales). The higher 
the result, the more efficient the firm. A retailer with sales of $2 million and operating costs of $1 
million has a 50 percent efficiency rating ([1– ($1 million/$2 million)]). Of every sales dollar, 50 
cents goes for nonoperating costs and profits, and 50 cents for operating expenses. The retailer 
might set a goal to increase efficiency to 60 percent. On sales of $2 million, operating costs would 
have to drop to $800,000 ([1– ($800,000/$2 million)]). Sixty cents of every sales dollar would 
then go for nonoperating costs and profits, and 40 cents for operations, which would lead to better 
profits. If a firm cuts expenses too much, customer service may decline; this in turn might lead 
to a decline in sales and profit.
Satisfaction of Publics
Retailers typically strive to satisfy their publics; that is, their stockholders, customers, suppliers, 
employees, and government. Stockholder satisfaction is a goal for any publicly owned retailer. 
Some firms set policies leading to small annual increases in sales and profits (because these goals 
can be sustained over the long run and indicate good management) rather than ones based on 
innovative ideas that may lead to peaks and valleys in sales and profits (indicating risky decisions). 
Stable earnings lead to stable dividends.
Customer satisfaction with the total retail experience is a well-entrenched goal at most firms 
now. Policies of caveat emptor (“Let the buyer beware”) or “the absence of complaints indicates 
that customers are satisfied” will not work in today’s competitive marketplace. Retailers must 
listen to criticism and adapt. If shoppers are pleased, other goals are more easily reached. Yet, for 
many retailers, other objectives rate higher than customer satisfaction in their list of priorities.

82	
PART 1  •  AN OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC RETAIL MANAGEMENT
Good supplier relations is also a key goal. Retailers must understand and work with their sup-
pliers to secure favorable purchase terms, new products, good return policies, prompt shipments, 
and cooperation. Relationships are very important for small retailers due to the many services 
that suppliers offer them.
Cordial labor relations is another goal that is often critical to retailers’ performance. Good 
employee morale means less absenteeism, better treatment of customers, and lower staffing turn-
over. Relations can be improved by effective selection, training, and motivation.
Because all levels of government impose rules affecting retailing practices, another goal 
should be to understand and adapt to government rules. In some cases, firms can influence rules 
by acting as members of large groups, such as trade associations or chambers of commerce.
Image (Positioning)
An image represents how a given retailer is perceived by consumers and others. A firm may be 
seen as innovative or conservative, specialized or broad-based, discount-oriented or upscale. The 
key to a successful image is that consumers view the retailer in the manner the firm intends.
Through positioning, a retailer devises its strategy in a way that projects an image relative to 
its retail category and its competitors and that elicits a positive consumer response. A firm selling 
women’s apparel, for example, could generally position itself as an upscale or mid-priced specialty 
retailer, a traditional department store, a discount department store, or a discount specialty retailer, 
and it could specifically position itself with regard to other retailers carrying women’s apparel.
Two opposite positioning philosophies have gained popularity in recent years: mass mer-
chandising and niche retailing. Mass merchandising is a positioning approach whereby retailers 
offer a discount or value-oriented image, a wide and/or deep merchandise selection, and large 
store facilities. Walmart has a wide, deep merchandise mix, whereas Dick’s Sporting Goods has 
a narrower, deeper assortment. These firms appeal to a broad customer market, attract a lot of 
customer traffic, and generate high stock turnover. Because mass merchants have relatively low 
operating costs, achieve economies in operations, and appeal to value-conscious shoppers, their 
continuing popularity is forecast.
In niche retailing, retailers identify specific customer segments and deploy unique strategies 
to address the desires of those segments rather than the mass market. Niching creates a high level 
of loyalty and shields retailers from more conventional competitors. Babies “R” Us appeals to 
parents with very young children, whereas Catherines Stores has fashions for plus-size women. 
A niche retailing approach will have a strong future because it lets retailers stress factors other 
than price and have a better focus. See Figure 3-6.
Because both mass merchandising and niche retailing are now popular, some observers call 
this the era of bifurcated retailing. They believe this may mean the decline of middle-of-the-
market retailing. Firms that are neither competitively priced nor particularly individualistic may 
have more difficulty competing.
Let’s further examine the concept of positioning through these two examples:
▶
▶The bebe apparel chain designs, develops, and produces contemporary women’s apparel and 
accessories targeted to 18- to 35-year-old sophisticated, hip, body-conscious women who seek 
current fashion trends to suit their lifestyle needs.10
▶
▶The underpinning of Trader Joe’s food stores’ strategy is to provide “value.” The firm offers 
everyday low prices on all the items it sells without the need for “loyalty” cards, clubs, or 
gimmicks. Trader Joe’s focuses on what matters: “great food + great prices = value.”11
Babies “R” Us (www 
.babiesrus.com) has a very 
focused strategy and an 
online tie-in with Toys  
“R” Us.
Trader Joe’s (www 
.traderjoes.com) is a 
shopping haven for 
consumers looking for 
distinctive, fairly priced 
food items.
Devising retail plans is now easier with the increased sophisti-
cation of planning software. Popular software include Sales 
and Marketing Pro (www.bplans.com), MPlans (www.mplans 
.com), and SmartTools: Fast Marketing Plan (http://www 
.­marketingprofs.com/smarttools). A lot of retail planning software 
contains templates that suggest how each element of a plan can 
be completed. Some templates include blog posts, articles, case 
studies, and checklists; help in enabling users to easily prepare 
PowerPoint presentation; and much more.
As a startup retailer, how would you use such software?

Figure 3-7 shows a retail positioning map based on two shopping criteria: (1) price and ser-
vice and (2) product lines offered. Our assumption: There is a link between price and service (high 
price equals excellent service). Upscale department stores (Neiman Marcus) offer outstanding 
customer service and carry prestigious designer apparel. Traditional department stores (Sears) 
focus more on appliances, tools, auto repair, and private-label apparel. Discount department stores 
(Walmart) carry a broad variety of product lines and rely on self-service. Membership clubs 
(Costco) have a limited selection in a number of product categories. They have very low prices

and warehouse type surroundings. Upscale specialty stores (Tiffany) offer outstanding customer 
service and focus on one general product category. Traditional specialty stores (Gap) have a 
trained sales staff to help customers and focus on apparel needs for the entire family. Discount 
specialty stores (Old Navy) rely more on self-service and focus on one general product category. 
Power retailers (Ikea) offer moderate service, low prices, and a huge assortment within one general 
product category.
Selection of Objectives
A firm that sets clear goals and devises a strategy to attain them improves its chances of success. 
An example of a retailer with clear goals and a proper strategy to attain them is Papa John’s, the 
4,900-outlet pizza chain that has stores in all 50 U.S. states and 37 countries. As reported at its 
Web site (www.papajohns.com), Papa John’s focuses on customers. It seeks to generate strong 
brand loyalty via “(a) authentic, superior-quality products, (b) legendary customer service, and 
(c) exceptional community service.”
IDENTIFICATION OF CONSUMER CHARACTERISTICS AND NEEDS
The customer group sought by a retailer is called the target market. In selecting its target market, 
a firm may use one of three techniques: mass marketing, selling goods and services to a broad 
spectrum of consumers; concentrated marketing, zeroing in on one specific group; or differ-
entiated marketing, aiming at two or more distinct consumer groups, with different retailing 
approaches for each group.
Supermarkets and drugstores define their target markets broadly. They sell a wide assortment 
of medium-quality items at popular prices. In contrast, a small upscale men’s shoe store appeals 
to a specific consumer group by offering a narrow, deep product assortment at above-average 
prices (or in other cases, below-average prices). A retailer aiming at one segment does not try to 
appeal to everyone.
Department stores are among those seeking multiple market segments. They cater to several 
customer groups, with unique goods and services for each. Apparel may be sold in a number of 
distinct boutiques in the store. Large chains frequently have divisions that appeal to different 
market segments. Darden Restaurants operates Olive Garden (Italian), LongHorn Steakhouse 
(emphasis on beef entrées), Capital Grill (American-style with “relaxed elegance”), Seasons 52 
(seasonal grill and wine bar), Bahama Breeze (Caribbean-style), Eddie V’s (seafood), and Yard 
House (food and craft beer) restaurants for customers with different food preferences.
After choosing the target market, a firm can determine its best competitive advantages and 
devise a strategy mix. See Table 3-3. The significance of competitive advantages—the distinct 
competencies of a retailer relative to competitors—must not be overlooked. Some examples will 
demonstrate this:

▶
▶Tiffany seeks affluent, status-conscious consumers. It puts stores in prestigious shopping 
areas, offers high-quality products, uses elegant ads, has extensive customer services, and has 
rather high prices.
▶
▶Kohl’s targets middle-class, value-conscious shoppers. It locates mostly in suburban shopping 
areas, offers national brands and Kohl’s brands of medium quality, features good values in 
ads, has some customer services, and charges below-average to average prices.
▶
▶T. J. Maxx, an off-price store chain, aims at extremely price-conscious consumers. It locates 
in low-rent strip shopping centers or districts, offers national brands (sometimes overruns and 
seconds) of average to below-average quality, emphasizes low prices, offers few customer 
services, and sets very low prices.
The key to the success of each of these retailers is its ability to define customers and cater to their 
needs in a distinctive manner. See Figure 3-8. Retailers are better able to select a target market 
and satisfy customer needs if they have a good understanding of consumer behavior. This topic is 
discussed in Chapter 7.
OVERALL STRATEGY
Next, a retailer develops an in-depth overall strategy. This involves two components: the aspects 
of business the firm can directly affect and those to which the retailer must adapt. The former are 
called controllable variables, and the latter are called uncontrollable variables. See Figure 3-9.
A strategy must be devised with both variables in mind. The ability of retailers to grasp and 
predict the effects of controllable and uncontrollable variables is greatly aided by the use of suit-
able data. In Chapter 8, information gathering and processing in retailing are described.
Controllable Variables
The controllable parts of a retail strategy consist of the categories in Figure 3-9: store location, 
managing a business, merchandise management and pricing, and communicating with the cus-
tomer. A good strategy integrates these areas, which are covered in depth in Chapters 9 through 19.

PART 1  •  AN OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC RETAIL MANAGEMENT
STORE LOCATION  A retailer has several store location decisions to make. The initial one is 
whether to use a store or nonstore format. Then, for store-based retailers, a general location and 
a specific site are determined. Competitors, transportation access, population density, the type of 
neighborhood, nearness to suppliers, pedestrian traffic, and store composition are considered in 
selecting a location. See Figure 3-10.
The terms of tenancy (such as rent and operating flexibility) are reviewed and a build, 
buy, or rent decision is made. The locations of multiple outlets are considered if expansion 
is a goal.
MANAGING A BUSINESS  Two major elements are involved in managing a business: the retail 
organization and human resource management, and the operations management. Tasks, poli-
cies, resources, authority, responsibility, and rewards are outlined via a retail organization struc-
ture. Practices regarding employee hiring, training, compensation, and supervision are instituted 
through human resource management. Job descriptions and functions are communicated, along 
with the responsibility of all personnel and the chain of command.
Operations management oversees the tasks that satisfy customer, employee, and management 
goals. Financial aspects of operations involve asset management, budgeting, and resource alloca-
tion. Other elements include store format and size, personnel use, store maintenance, energy man-
agement, store security, insurance, credit management, computerization, and crisis management.
MERCHANDISE MANAGEMENT AND PRICING  In merchandise management, the general quality 
of the goods and services offering is set. Decisions are made as to the width of assortment (the 
number of product categories carried) and the depth of assortment (the variety of products in any 
category). Policies are set with respect to introducing new items. Criteria for buying decisions

(how often, what terms, which suppliers) are set. Forecasting, budgeting, and accounting proce-
dures are outlined, as is the level of inventory for each type of merchandise. Finally, the retailer 
devises procedures to assess the success or failure of each item sold.
With regard to pricing, a retailer chooses from among several techniques; and it decides 
what range of prices to set, consistent with the firm’s image and the quality of goods and services 
offered. The range of prices within each product category is determined, such as stocking carry-on 
luggage from $39 to $99. The use of markdowns is planned in advance: how often goods will be 
on sale and at what reduction from the usual selling price.
COMMUNICATING WITH THE CUSTOMER  An image can be created and sustained by applying 
various techniques.
Physical attributes, or atmosphere, of a store and its surrounding area influence consumer 
perceptions. The impact of a storefront (building exterior or home page for a Web retailer) should 
not be undervalued, as it is the first physical element seen by customers. Once inside, layouts and 
displays, floor colors, lighting, scents, music, and sales personnel also contribute to a retailer’s 
image. Customer services and community relations generate a favorable image.
The right use of promotional tools enhances sales performance. Tools range from inex-
pensive flyers for a take-out restaurant to an expensive national ad campaign for a franchise 
chain. Three forms of paid promotion are available: advertising, personal selling, and sales 
promotion. A retailer can gain free publicity if stories about it are written, televised, broadcast, 
or blogged.
Uncontrollable Variables
The preceding discussion outlined controllable parts of a retail strategy, but uncontrollable vari-
ables must also be kept in mind. Uncontrollable parts of a strategy consist of the factors shown 
in Figure 3-9: consumers, competition, technology, economic conditions, seasonality, and legal 
issues. Farsighted firms adapt the controllable parts of their strategies to take into account factors 
beyond their immediate control.
CONSUMERS  A skillful retailer knows it cannot alter demographic trends or lifestyle patterns, 
impose tastes, or “force” goods and services on people. The firm learns about its target market 
and forms a strategy consistent with consumer trends and desires. It cannot sell goods or services 
that are beyond the desired price range of customers, that are not wanted, or that are not displayed 
or advertised in the proper manner.
COMPETITION  There is often little that retailers can do to limit the entry of competitors. In fact, 
a retailer’s success may encourage the entry of new firms or cause established competitors to 
modify their strategies to capitalize on the popularity of a successful retailer. A major increase 
in competition should lead a company to re-examine its strategy, including its target market and 
merchandising focus, to ensure that it holds a competitive edge. A continued willingness to satisfy 
customers better than any competitor is fundamental. Retailers should define competition broadly. 
Sales of perishables at Target, home cleaning supplies by Staples, and home delivery of groceries 
by AmazonFresh all constitute competitive threats to a supermarket chain.
Rituals, a cosmetics and fragrance company based in the Nether-
lands, has nearly 400 stores in 21 countries and recently opened 
a New York location. It planned to open 80 new stores worldwide 
in 2016 alone and uses payments company Adyen systems for 
both online and in-store payments. Adyen has facilitated Ritual’s 
entering new countries and accepting new forms of payment. 
Rituals currently accepts 20 different forms of payment, includ-
ing major credit cards, country-specific payment alternatives, and 
bank transfers. Adyen’s systems take care of back-office issues 
and put all the data into one interface. Reconciliation statements 
are consolidated each week.

PART 1  •  AN OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC RETAIL MANAGEMENT
TECHNOLOGY  Computer systems are available for inventory control and checkout operations. 
There are more high-tech ways to warehouse and transport merchandise. Toll-free 800 numbers 
are popular for consumer ordering. And, of course, there is the Web. Nonetheless, some advance-
ments are expensive and may be beyond the reach of small retailers. For example, although small 
firms might have computerized checkouts, they will probably be unable to use fully automated 
inventory systems. As a result, their efficiency may be less than that of larger competitors. They 
must adapt by providing more personalized service.
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS  Economic conditions are beyond any retailer’s control, no matter how 
large it is. Unemployment, interest rates, inflation, tax levels, and the annual economic growth 
(known as gross domestic product, or GDP) are just some economic factors with which a retailer 
copes. In outlining the controllable parts of its strategy, a retailer needs to consider forecasts about 
international, national, state, and local economies.
SEASONALITY  A constraint on certain retailers is their seasonality, as well as the possibility 
that unpredictable weather will play havoc with sales forecasts. Retailers selling sports equip-
ment, fresh food, travel services, and car rentals cannot control the seasonality of demand or bad 
weather. They can diversify offerings to carry a goods/service mix with items that are popular in 
different seasons. Thus, a sporting goods retailer can emphasize ski equipment and snowmobiles 
in the winter, baseball and golf equipment in the spring, scuba equipment and fishing gear in the 
summer, and basketball and football supplies in the fall.
LEGAL RESTRICTIONS  Table 3-4 shows how each controllable aspect of a retail strategy is affected 
by the legal environment.
Retailers that operate in more than one state are subject to federal laws and agencies. The 
Sherman Act and the Clayton Act deal with monopolies and restraints of trade. The Federal Trade 
Commission deals with unfair trade practices and consumer complaints. The Robinson-Patman 
Act prohibits suppliers from giving unjust merchandise discounts to large retailers that could 
adversely affect small ones. The Telemarketing Sales Rule protects consumers.
At the state and local levels, retailers have to deal with many restrictions. Zoning laws prohibit 
firms from operating at certain sites and demand that building specifications be met. Blue laws limit 
the times during which retailers can conduct business. Construction, smoking, and other codes are 
imposed by the state and city. Licenses to operate some businesses are under state or city 
jurisdiction.
For more information, contact the Federal Trade Commission (www.ftc.gov), state and local 
bodies, the Better Business Bureau (www.bbb.org), the National Retail Federation (www.nrf 
.com), or a group such as the Direct Marketing Association (www.the-dma.org).
Integrating Overall Strategy
At this point, the firm has set an overall strategy. It has chosen a mission, an ownership and man-
agement style, and a goods/service category. Goals are clear. A target market has been designated 
and studied. Decisions have been made about store location, managing the business, merchandise 
management and pricing, and communications. These factors must be coordinated to have a con-
sistent, integrated strategy and to account for uncontrollable variables (consumers, competition, 
technology, economy, seasonality, and legal restrictions). The firm is then ready to do the specific 
tasks to carry out its strategy productively.
SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES
Short-run decisions are now made and enacted for each controllable part of the strategy in 
Figure 3-9. These actions are known as tactics and encompass a retailer’s daily and short-term 
operations. They must be responsive to the uncontrollable environment. Here are some tactical 
moves a retailer may make:
▶
▶Store location. Trading-area analysis gauges the area from which a firm draws its customers. 
The level of competition in a trading area is studied regularly. Relationships with nearby 
retailers are optimized. A chain carefully decides on the sites of new outlets. Facilities are 
actually built or modified.
The FTC has a publication 
on why “Competition 
Counts” (www.ftc 
.gov/tips-advice/
competition-guidance/
competition-counts).

TABLE 3-4  The Impact of the Legal Environment on Retailing*
Controllable Factor Affected
Selected Legal Constraints on Retailers
Store location
Zoning laws restrict the potential choices for a location and the type of facilities constructed.
Blue laws restrict the days and hours during which retailers may operate.
Environmental laws limit the retail uses of certain sites.
Door-to-door (direct) selling laws protect consumer privacy.
Local ordinances involve fire, smoking, outside lighting, capacity, and other rules.
Leases and mortgages require parties to abide by stipulations in tenancy documents.
Managing the business
Licensing provisions mandate minimum education and/or experience for certain personnel.
Personnel laws involve nondiscriminatory hiring, promoting, and firing of employees.
Antitrust laws limit large firm mergers and expansion.
Franchise agreements require parties to abide by various legal provisions.
Business taxes include real-estate and income taxes.
Recycling laws mandate that retailers participate in recycling for various materials.
Merchandise management and pricing
Trademarks provide retailers with exclusive rights to the brand names they develop.
Merchandise restrictions forbid some retailers from selling specified goods or services.
Product liability laws allow retailers to be sued if they sell defective products.
Lemon laws specify consumer rights if products, such as autos, require continuing repairs.
Sales taxes are required in most states, although tax-free days have been introduced in some 
locales to encourage consumer shopping.
Unit-pricing laws require price per unit to be displayed (most often applied to supermarkets).
Collusion laws prohibit retailers from discussing selling prices with competitors.
Sale prices must be a reduction from the retailer’s normal selling prices.
Price discrimination laws prohibit suppliers from offering unjustified discounts to large 
retailers that are unavailable to smaller ones.
Communicating with the customer
Truth-in-advertising and truth-in-selling laws require retailers to be honest and not omit key 
facts.
Truth-in-credit laws require that shoppers be informed of all terms when buying on credit.
Telemarketing laws protect the privacy and rights of consumers regarding telephone sales.
Bait-and-switch laws make it illegal to lure shoppers into a store to buy low-priced items and 
then to aggressively try to switch them to higher-priced ones.
Inventory laws mandate that retailers must have sufficient stock when running sales.
Labeling laws require merchandise to be correctly labeled and displayed.
Cooling-off laws let customers cancel completed orders, often made by in-home sales, within 
three days of a contract.
* This table is broad and omits a law-by-law description. Many laws are state or locally oriented and apply only to certain locales; the 
laws in each area differ widely. The intent here is to give the reader some understanding of the current legal environment as it affects 
retail management.
The Federal Trade Commission’s (www.ftc.gov) “Guide against 
Deceptive Pricing” lists several forms of deceptive price advertis-
ing: former price comparisons, comparable value price adver-
tising, advertising price reductions based on suggested selling 
prices, and bargain offers. The guide states that the former price 
for a good should be an actual price at which it was offered to 
the public on a regular basis for a reasonably substantial time. 
Price-based advertising is deceptive in these situations: A men’s 
clothier uses shows manufacturers’ suggested prices online, so it 
appears that its prices are discounted from the clothier’s regular 
prices (which they are not). A department store promotes kitchen 
appliances at 20 percent off a manufacturer’s suggested list price, 
although that price does not correspond to the actual selling 
price in its geographic area.
Discuss how a large Web-based retailer can avoid false adver-
tising litigation.

PART 1  •  AN OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC RETAIL MANAGEMENT
▶
▶Managing the business. There is a clear chain of command from managers to workers. An 
organization structure is set into place. Personnel are hired, trained, and supervised. Financial 
management tracks assets and liabilities. The budget is spent properly. Operations are system-
ized and adjusted as required.
▶
▶Merchandise management and pricing. Assortments in departments and the space allotted 
to each department require constant decisions. Innovative firms look for new merchandise 
and clear out slow-moving items. Purchase terms are negotiated and suppliers sought. Sell-
ing prices reflect the firm’s image and target market. Price ranges offer consumers some 
choice. Adaptation is needed to respond to higher supplier prices and react to competitors’ 
prices.
▶
▶Communicating with the customer. The storefront and display windows, store layout, and 
merchandise displays need regular attention. These elements help gain consumer enthusiasm, 
present a fresh look, introduce new products, and reflect changing seasons. Ads are placed 
during the proper time and in the proper media. The deployment of sales personnel varies by 
merchandise category and season.
The essence of retailing excellence is building a sound strategy and fine-tuning it. A firm 
that stands still is often moving backward. Tactical decision making is discussed in detail in 
Chapters 9 through 19.
CONTROL
In the control phase of strategic planning for retailers, a review takes place (Step VI in  
Figure 3-1), as the strategy and tactics (Steps IV and V) are assessed against the business mission, 
objectives, and target market (Steps I, II, and III). This procedure is called a retail audit, which 
is a systematic process for analyzing the performance of a retailer. The retail audit is covered 
in Chapter 20.
The strengths and weaknesses of a retailer are revealed as performance is reviewed. The 
aspects of a strategy that have gone well are maintained; those that have gone poorly are revised, 
consistent with the mission, goals, and target market. The adjustments are reviewed in the firm’s 
next retail audit.
FEEDBACK
At each strategic stage, an observant management receives signals or cues, known as feedback, as 
to the success or failure of that part of the strategy. Again, refer to Figure 3-1. Positive feedback 
includes high revenue, a high percentage of customers renewing annual membership in a member-
ship (warehouse) club, and low employee turnover and absenteeism. Negative feedback includes 
falling sales revenue, low membership renewals, and high employee turnover and absenteeism. 
Retail executives look for positive and negative feedback so they can determine the causes and 
then capitalize on opportunities or rectify problems.
A STRATEGIC PLANNING TEMPLATE FOR RETAIL 
MANAGEMENT
A detailed, user-friendly strategic planning template, Computer-Assisted Strategic Retail 
Management Planning, appears at our Web site (www.pearsonhighered.com/bermanevans). 
This template, based on Figure 3-1, enables you to build a strategic plan. You may apply the 
template to one of the scenarios provided—or devise your own scenario. You have the option 
of printing each facet of the planning process individually, or printing the full plan as an 
integrated whole.

•	 Long term
•	 Fashion-forward image with the store’s target market.
•	 Exclusive relationships with some well-known and some emerging designers.
•	 Low-rent location in comparison to a regional shopping center.
•	 Excellent supplier relationships.
•	 Loyal employees.
•	 Excellent relationships within the community.
•	 Weaknesses
•	 Current
•	 Difficulty in recruiting appropriate part-time personnel for peak seasonal periods.
•	 Small store space limits selection. Too often, the tailor does major alterations.
•	 Long delivery times for certain French and Italian designers.
•	 Lack of a computer-based information system that would better enable it to access key information concerning inventory, 
sales, customer preferences, and purchase histories.
•	 Limited expertise in social media.
•	 Long term
•	 Limited bargaining power with vendors due to small orders. This affects prices paid, as well as access to “hot-selling” 
clothing.
•	 Suburban strip mall location reduces its trading area. There is little tourist trade.
•	 Over-reliance on the owner-manager, and on several key employees.
•	 No long-term management succession plan.
•	 Opportunities
•	 Current
•	 Hire another experienced tailor to create a custom-made clothing department.
•	 Hire an assistant to better coordinate trunk and fashion shows. This would solidify Sally’s reputation among fashion-
forward shoppers and in the community.
•	 Take over an empty adjacent store to increase size by 50 percent.
•	 Enhance the Web site. This would enable it to appeal to a larger trading area, promote more events (such as a fashion 
show), and provide links to designers.
•	 Long term
•	 Larger store increases the ability to expand the number of designers, as well as the product lines carried. This would 
improve Sally’s bargaining power with suppliers.
•	 Custom-made clothing department to appeal to customers who dislike “ready-to-wear apparel” and to customers with 
highly individualized tastes.
•	 Expanded market due to enhanced Web site.
•	 Threats
•	 Current
•	 Rumors that Bloomingdale’s, a fashion-based department store, may soon locate a new store within 10 miles of Sally’s. 
This could affect relationships with suppliers as well as customers. Bloomingdale’s offers one-stop shopping and has a 
flexible return policy for unaltered merchandise with its labels intact.
•	 Local recession’s impact on revenues.
•	 Long term
•	 Many customers in their 50s and 60s. Some are close to retirement; others intend to spend more time in Florida and Ari-
zona during the winter. The retailer needs to attract and retain younger shoppers.

3.	 Objectives
•	 Sales: Achieve sales volume of $4 million per year.
•	 Profit: (a) Achieve net profit before tax of $300,000. (b) Increase inventory turnover from 4 times a year to 6 times a year. (c) 
Increase gross margin return on inventory (GMROI) by 50 percent through more effective inventory management.
•	 Positioning: (a) Reposition store to appeal to younger shoppers without losing current clientele. (b) Increase acceptance by 
younger shoppers. (c) Establish more of a Web presence.
•	 Satisfaction of publics: (a) Maintain store loyalty among current customers. (b) Increase relationship with younger designers 
selling less costly, younger apparel. (c) Maintain excellent relationship with employees.
4.	 Identification of Consumers
•	 Choice of target market approach
•	 Mass marketing: This is not a mass-market retailer.
•	 Concentrated marketing: This is Sally’s current target market strategy.
•	 Differentiated marketing: Sally’s might consider attracting multiple target markets: its current fashion-forward customers 
seeking designer apparel and accessories in a full-service environment; younger, professional customers who desire more 
trendy clothing; and fashion-forward customers who desire custom-made clothing.
5.	 Overall Strategy
•	 Controllable variables
•	 Goods/service strategy: Merchandise is fashion-forward from established and emerging designers. Fashion accessories 
include such items as scarves, belts, and hats. The retailer has no plans to sell ladies’ shoes or pocketbooks. Most of the 
designer merchandise is selectively distributed. A planned custom-made clothing department would enable Sally’s to attract 
hard-to-fit and hard-to-please shoppers. Custom-made clothing shoppers would have a wide variety of swatches and fashion 
books from which to choose.
•	 Location strategy: Sally’s currently occupies a single location in a suburban strip mall. This site has comparatively low rent, 
is within 10 miles of 80 percent of the store’s customers, has adequate parking, and has good visibility from the road.
•	 Pricing strategy: Sally’s charges list price for all of its goods. Included in the price are full-tailoring service, as well as a per-
sonal shopper for major customers. Twice a year, the store has a 50 percent off sale on seasonal goods. This is followed by 
70 percent off sales to clear the store of remaining off-season inventory.
•	 Promotion strategy: Sally’s sales personnel are well-trained and highly motivated. They know key customers by name and 
by their style, color, and designer preferences. Sally’s plans to upgrade its regular fashion and trunk shows where new styles 
are exhibited to current customers and potential customers. Sally’s also maintains a customer database. The best customers 
are called when suitable merchandise arrives and are allowed to preview it. Some other customers are contacted by mail. The 
improved Web site will feature the latest styles, the Web address of major designers, color availability, and more. Sally’s has 
a display listing in the Yellow Pages.
•	 Uncontrollable variables
•	 Consumer environment: Business is subject to the uncertainty of the acceptance of new fashions by the target market. 
Although Sally’s wants to attract two additional segments (custom-made clothing buyers and younger buyers), there is no 
assurance that it will be successful with these target markets. The store needs to be careful that in seeking these new seg-
ments, it does not alienate its current shoppers.
•	 Competitive environment: The rumored opening of a fashion-oriented department store in the area would significantly affect sales.
•	 Legal environment: Sally’s is careful in fully complying with all laws. Unlike some competitors, it does not eliminate sales 
taxes for cash purchases or ship empty boxes out-of-state to avoid sales tax.
•	 Economic environment: Local recessions can reduce sales substantially.
•	 Technological environment: Sally’s is in the process of investigating a new retail information system to track purchases, 
inventories, credit card transactions, and more.
6.	 Specific Activities
•	 Daily and short-term operations: Sally’s matches competitors’ prices, promptly corrects alteration issues, has longer store hours 
in busy periods, and offers exclusive merchandise.
•	 Responses to environment: Sally’s acts appropriately with regard to trends in the economy, competitor actions, and so forth.
7.	 Control
•	 Evaluation: A new retail information system will better enable Sally’s to ascertain fashion trends, adjust inventories to reduce mark-
downs, and contact customers with specific offerings. Sales by color, size, style, and designer will be more carefully monitored.
•	 Adjustment: The retail information system will enable Sally’s store to reduce excess inventories, maximize sales opportunities, 
and better target individual customers.

PART 1  •  AN OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC RETAIL MANAGEMENT
1.	 To show the value of strategic planning for all types of 
retailers. A retail strategy is the overall plan that guides 
a firm. It consists of situation analysis, objectives, iden-
tification of a customer market, broad strategy, specific 
activities, control, and feedback. Without a well-con-
ceived strategy, a retailer may be unable to cope with 
environmental factors.
2.	 To explain the steps in strategic planning for retailers. 
Situation analysis is the candid evaluation of opportu-
nities and threats. It looks at the firm’s current mar-
ketplace position and where it should be heading. This 
analysis includes defining an organizational mission, 
evaluating ownership and management options, and 
outlining the goods/service category.
An organizational mission is a commitment to a 
type of business and a place in the market. Ownership/
management options include sole proprietorship, part-
nership, or corporation; starting a business, buying an 
existing one, or being a franchisee; owner management 
or professional management; and being centralized or 
decentralized. The goods/service category depends on 
personal abilities, finances, and time resources.
A firm may pursue one or more of these goals: sales 
(growth, stability, and market share); profit (level, return 
on investment, and efficiency); satisfaction of publics 
(stockholders, consumers, and others); and image/posi-
tioning (customer and industry perceptions).
Next, consumer characteristics and needs are deter-
mined, and a target market is selected. A firm can sell to 
a broad spectrum of consumers (mass marketing); zero 
in on one customer group (concentrated marketing); or 
aim at two or more distinct groups of consumers (differ-
entiated marketing), with separate retailing approaches 
for each.
A broad strategy is formed. It has controllable vari-
ables (factors a firm can directly affect) and uncontrol-
lable variables (factors a firm cannot control and to 
which it must adapt).
After a general strategy is set, a firm makes and 
implements short-run decisions (tactics) for each con-
trollable part of that strategy. Tactics must be forward-
looking and respond to the environment.
Through a control process, strategy and tactics are 
evaluated and revised continuously. A retail audit sys-
tematically reviews a strategy and its execution on a 
regular basis. Strengths are emphasized and weaknesses 
minimized or eliminated.
An alert firm seeks out signals or cues, known as 
feedback, that indicate the level of performance at each 
step in the strategy.
3.	 To examine the individual controllable and uncontrolla-
ble elements of a retail strategy, and to present strategic 
planning as a series of integrated steps. There are four 
major controllable factors in retail planning: store loca-
tion, managing the business, merchandise management 
and pricing, and communicating with the customer. The 
principal uncontrollable factors affecting retail planning 
are consumers, competition, technology, economic con-
ditions, seasonality, and legal restrictions.
Each stage in the strategic planning process needs to 
be performed, undertaken sequentially, and coordinated 
in order to have a consistent, integrated, unified strategy.
4.	 To demonstrate how a strategic plan can be prepared. 
A comprehensive, user-friendly strategic planning tem-
plate, Computer-Assisted Strategic Retail Management 
Planning, appears at our Web site. This template uses 
a series of drop-down menus to build a strategic plan.

Questions for Discussion
1.	 Strategic planning can be done by the owner of a firm, 
professional management, or a combination of both. 
Why is strategic planning attractive?
2.	 How might a retailer go about identifying and quantify-
ing the key opportunities and threats it faces?
3.	 What are the pros and cons of setting up a new retail 
operation as a sole proprietor?
4.	 Develop a checklist of likely financial investments for a 
new retail venture. What are the most common funding 
methods for these investments?
5.	 Why do retailers frequently underestimate the financial 
and time requirements of a business?
6.	 Draw and explain a positioning map showing the kinds 
of retailers selling tablets such as the iPad and Kindle 
Fire.
7.	 Discuss local examples of retailers applying mass 
marketing, concentrated marketing, and differentiated 
marketing.
8.	 A footwear retailer located in a seasonal coastal resort 
wants to choose the most appropriate ways to target their 
market. Which would you choose, mass, concentrated 
or differentiated marketing? Explain each approach as 
well as the reason for your choice of targeting method.
9.	 A competing bicycle store has a better location than yours. 
It is in a modern shopping center with a lot of customer 
traffic. Your store is in an older neighborhood and requires 
customers to travel farther to reach you. How could you 
use a merchandising, pricing, and communications strat-
egy to overcome your disadvantageous location?
10.	 Describe how a retailer can use fine-tuning in strategic 
planning.
11.	 How are the control and feedback phases of retail strat-
egy planning interrelated? Give an example.
12.	 Should a catalog-based men’s wear retailer use the 
strategic planning process differently from an Internet 
retailer? Why or why not?
Web-Based Exercise
Visit the Web site of Angie’s List (www.angieslist.com): 
“More than three million households nationwide check 
Angie’s List reviews to find the best local service provid-
ers, like roofers, plumbers, handymen, mechanics, doctors, 
and dentists.” Describe and evaluate the company’s strategy 
based on the information you find there. Why do you think 
Angie’s List has been so successful?

The Special Dimensions of Strategic 
Planning in a Global Retailing 
Environment
There are about 270 countries and dependent areas—with more than 7.3 billion people and a 
$115 trillion economy—in the world. The United States accounts for less than 5 percent of the 
world’s population and about 16 percent of the worldwide economy. Although the United States 
is a huge marketplace, there are also many other opportunities. Annual worldwide retailing sales 
have reached about $25 trillion—and they are growing. When we talk about the global environ-
ment of retailing, we mean both U.S. firms operating in foreign markets and foreign retailers 
operating in U.S. markets.
The global strategic planning challenge is clear: “It is time to focus on a portfolio of coun-
tries—with different levels of risk, at different stages of maturity, and with distinctive consumer 
profiles—to balance short- and long-term opportunities.”1
Yearly, A. T. Kearney ranks 30 developing nations on a 0- to 100-point Global Retail Develop-
ment Index (GRDI) scale. Higher-ranked countries represent better opportunities to enter or 
expand in that market. The GRDI scores are based on four attributes: market attractiveness (25 
percent), country and business risk (25 percent), market saturation (25 percent), and time pressure 
(25 percent).2 Table A3-1 shows the GRDI scores for the top 10 performing foreign countries.
When embarking on an international retailing strategy, firms should consider the various 
factors shown in Figure A3-1.
Opportunities and Threats in Global Retailing
For participating firms, there are wide-ranging opportunities and threats in global retailing.
Opportunities
▶
▶Foreign markets may be used to complement domestic sales.
▶
▶Foreign markets may represent growth opportunities if domestic markets are saturated or 
stagnant.
▶
▶A retailer may be able to offer goods, services, or technology not yet available in foreign 
markets.
▶
▶Competition may be less in some foreign markets.
Michigan State 
University has a Web site 
(www.globaledge.msu 
.edu) that is an excellent 
source of information on 
global business practices.

Factors to Consider 
When Engaging in 
Global Retailing
Store location factors
• Availability of desirable
    areas and sites
• Lease/purchase terms
• Level of transportation
    facilities
• Hours of operation
Pricing factors
• Level
• Use of set pricing versus
    negotiable pricing
• Typical purchase terms
International
retailing
strategy
Merchandising factors
• Width and depth
    of assortment
• Merchandise quality
• Level of innovativeness
• Availability and caliber 
    of suppliers
• Inventory control
Operations factors
• Availability and caliber
    of personnel
• Appropriate management
    style
• Facilities (e.g., availability
    of air-conditioning)
• Expected pilferage rates
Consumer factors
• Retailing preferences
• Population trends
• Predominant language
• Level and distribution
    of income
• Level of literacy/education
• Cultural values and life-
  style patterns
Institutional factors
• Ownership form
• Goods/service category
• Existing channels of
    distribution
• Level of competition
• Level of technology (e.g.,
    media, transportation
    network)
• Government restrictions
• Desirability of a
  standardized approach
Image and promotion factors
• Store atmosphere
• Interior layout and displays
• Advertising
• Personal selling
▶
▶There may be tax or investment advantages in foreign markets.
▶
▶Due to government and economic shifts, many nations are more open to the entry of foreign firms.
▶
▶Communications are easier than before. The Internet enables retailers to reach customers and 
suppliers well outside their domestic markets.
Threats
▶
▶There may be cultural differences between domestic and foreign markets.
▶
▶Management styles may not be easily adaptable.
▶
▶Foreign governments may place restrictions on some operations.
▶
▶Personal income may be poorly distributed among consumers in foreign markets.
▶
▶Distribution systems and technology may be inadequate (e.g., poor roads and lack of refrig-
eration). This may minimize the effectiveness of the Web as a selling tool.
▶
▶Institutional formats vary greatly among countries.
▶
▶Currencies are different. The countries in the European Union have sought to alleviate this 
problem through the euro, a common currency, in most of their member nations.
Standardization: An opportunity and a threat
In devising a global strategy, a retailer must pay attention to the concept of standardization. Can 
the home market strategy be standardized and directly applied to foreign markets, or do personnel, 
physical facilities, operations, advertising messages, product lines, and other factors have to be 
adapted to local conditions and needs? Table A3-2 shows how the economies differ in 15 countries.

98	
PART 1  •  AN OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC RETAIL MANAGEMENT
U.S. Retailers in Foreign Markets
Discussed here are three of the many examples of U.S. retailers with high involvement in foreign 
markets.
Toys “R” Us has more than 750 Toys “R” Us, Babies “R” Us, and Side-by-Side stores abroad. 
In addition to company-owned stores, Toys “R” Us licenses 250 stores in 20 countries and jurisdic-
tions. In these markets, such as Indonesia, South Africa, Turkey, and United Arab Emirates, the 
firm emphasizes licensing rather than direct corporate ownership. Why? This enables it to better 
tap the local knowledge of franchisees in certain markets while still setting corporate policies.3 
Toys ‘R” Us also has an online presence in 19 countries and jurisdictions.
The majority of McDonald’s restaurants are outside the United States. Sales at McDonald’s 
foreign outlets in over 100 foreign nations account for two-thirds of total revenues. Besides 
Europe, McDonald’s has outlets in such nations as Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, 
China, Colombia, Egypt, Greece, India, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Pakistan, Russia, 
South Africa, South Korea, Spain, and Uruguay. To appeal to foreign tastes, McDonald’s adapts its 
menu around the world. For example, its French units sell macaroons, offer blue-cheese burgers, 
and offer a wide choice of sauces for french fries.4
Amazon.com has rapidly expanded globally by introducing dedicated Web sites for specific 
nations. They include Canada (www.amazon.ca), China (www.joyo.com), France (www.amazon 
.fr), Germany (www.amazon.de), Great Britain (www.amazon.co.uk), Japan (www.amazon.co.jp), 
and Spain (www.amazon.es). Although these sites all have the familiar Amazon Web design, they 
differ by language, products offered, and currency.
Foreign Retailers in the U.S. Market
Although the revenues of U.S.-based retailers owned by foreign firms are hard to measure, they 
equal several hundred billion dollars annually. Foreign ownership in U.S. retailers is highest for 
general merchandise stores, food stores, and apparel and accessory stores. Examples of U.S.-based 
retailers owned by foreign firms are shown in Table A3-2. A large number of foreign retailers 
have entered the United States to appeal to the world’s most affluent mass market. Here are three 
examples.

The Netherlands’ Royal Ahold and Belgium-based Delhaize Group recently merged into 
Ahold Delhaize. Royald Ahold operates Stop and Shop, Giant Foods, and Martin’s Food Markets. 
It also owns Peapod, the online food retailer. Delhaize Group’s U.S. operations include Food 
Lion and Hannaford supermarkets. The combined operation will result in the creation of one of 
the largest grocery chains in the United States, with over 6,500 stores. The merger is subject to 
approval by the Federal Trade Commission.
Luxottica, an Italian firm, operates more than 7,200 optical and sunglass stores in over 150 
countries in North America, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America, and Europe. It has the 
highest market share in the U.S. optical retail market with its LensCrafters, Pearle Vision, and 
Sunglass Hut stores. Luxottica also operates leased departments at Sears Optical and at Target 
Optical stores in the United States. Luxottica’s annual total 2015 revenue (including eyeglass and 
sunglass manufacturing) exceeded $10 billion (U.S.).5
Ikea is a Swedish-based home-furnishings retailer operating more than 300 stores in 37 
nations. In 1985, Ikea opened its first U.S. store in Pennsylvania. Since then, it has added nearly 
40 other U.S. stores in such cities as Baltimore, Chicago, Elizabeth (New Jersey), Hicksville (Long 
Island, New York), Houston, Los Angeles, San Diego, Seattle, and Washington, DC. The firm 
offers durable, stylish, ready-to-assemble furniture at low prices. Stores are huge, have enormous 
selections, include a playroom for children, and other amenities. Today, Ikea generates 94 percent 
of its sales from international operations, and 15 percent of total company sales are from its North 
American stores.6
Although the revenues of U.S.-based retailers owned by foreign firms are hard to measure, 
they reach several hundred billion dollars annually. Foreign ownership in U.S. retailers is highest 
for general merchandise stores, food stores, and apparel and accessory stores. Examples of U.S.-
based retailers owned by foreign firms are shown in Table A3-3.

PART 1  •  AN OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC RETAIL MANAGEMENT
Short Cases
Case 1: Retailers MUST Be Future-Oriented*
When children’s organic food manufacturer Happy Family 
wanted to reimagine the retail aisle, the stakes were high. “We 
looked at how people shop this section,” says Riddhish Kan-
kariya, Happy Family’s vice-president of strategy and insights. 
“Do they shop based on brand, on organic versus non-organic, 
on type of food, or on age?”
To answer those questions, Happy Family turned to virtual 
reality, creating four scenarios to gather data from 800 shop-
pers. “There is no way, if we had not done this virtually, that 
we’d have been able to get these numbers,” Kankariya adds. 
While it may seem that Happy Family reached into the future, 
virtual and augmented reality are already transforming retail 
from store design to signage.
“It’s definitely one of the hottest technologies right now,” 
says David Evans, commercial director of Kantar Retail Virtual 
Reality. “It’s hot in the marketplace, but it’s not a fad. VR has 
been around for a long time, so it’s had time to mature.” “Retail-
ers need to look at virtual reality not as some addition, but as 
how the Web is going to evolve,” notes Mary Spio, founder of 
CEEK VR. “When we first started working with brands to do 
online video, we had Web 1.0—just text, pictures. The brands 
that embraced video early could attract a wider user base. That’s 
the same way that retailers can and should look at virtual reality.”
The world has been waiting for hardware to catch up—and 
some major manufacturers released virtual reality devices in 
2016. As that happens, more customers may expect virtual and 
augmented reality when shopping online. “The next step will 
be to move to V-commerce, which will become a part of the 
omnichannel strategy,” says Mark Hardy, CEO of InContext 
Solutions, which focuses on shopper insights via virtual real-
ity. “‘Can I jump in and look at the ingredients or parts of the 
product? Can I actually put it on and see what it looks like in 
a different scenario? It will help with some of the shortfalls 
in E-commerce, upselling, cross-selling, and providing a more 
engaging and individualized experience.”
Happy Family’s research is just the beginning of how 
companies use—and plan to use—virtual reality. Working 
with InContext, Kankariya sees more possibilities. “When we 
showed the virtual technology to our CEO and founder, her 
first thought was, ‘There are so many ways we can use this to 
test packaging or design. So many ways of engaging with our 
audience,”’ he remarks.
“At the macro level,” says Hardy, “it starts with store 
design, the flow, the adjacencies, and extends down to the 
micro level, product, category, displays, and signage. There are 
two levels for retailers wanting to create a new store. They can 
take the current footprint and play around with it, to reinvent 
the experience in current stores. Or they can create an entire 
new building footprint.” There are reasons to do so virtually. “If 
you create it in a physical world, your competition knows what 
you’re doing before you understand the impact of the strategy.” 
And without having to build fixtures or stock a single product, 
retailers can allow “customers” to “shop” a virtual store while 
measuring their behavior and what, how and why they buy.
Augmented reality “is adding a layer of the virtual realm 
to your reality, immediately delivering an enhanced experience 
that provides unprecedented value,” comments Yoni Nevo, CEO 
of augmented-reality-visualization platform Cimagine. “It can 
give the consumer contextual information, showing products 
before purchase, thus enabling the consumer to have confidence 
to make a more informed decision to buy faster. The ability to 
add the virtual layer to a user’s reality provides significant value 
to brands, retailers, and manufacturers.”

1.	 What do you think are the best uses of VR for retailers 
today? What are the limitations?
2.	 Is the typical retailer ready for VR? Why or why not?
3.	 How can VR enhance a firm’s ability to generate a great 
total retail experience and relationship retailing?
4.	 Even if a retailer is not ready for VR, what can it learn from 
this case?
Case 2: Stores That Accommodate Those with 
Physical Limitations*
Fifty million people, age 65 and older, represent one-seventh of 
the U.S. population, according to the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services Administration for Community Living.
“We account for all of the requested shoppers when design-
ing a new space, which can vary depending on the retailer, loca-
tion, and demographics,” states Christopher Studach, creative 
director at King Retail Solutions. “In the case of seniors, there 
are several elements that we consider when designing. One key 
area is good lighting that improves product visibility and read-
ability. Seniors can also have a difficult time with contrast, so 
large swings from light to dark areas within the store can cause 
frustration and risks for senior shoppers.”
According to Studach, King Retail Solutions also focuses 
on the size, location, and makeup of categories that are of spe-
cial interest to seniors, particularly lifestyle and health-related 
categories, with the goal of providing an easy way to locate 
hard-to-find items. “For example,” he notes, “how many times 
have you searched with frustration for that one small package 
of vitamin K that is thoughtfully buried among hundreds of 
similar small packages?”
A current trend among retailers, he adds, is to use every inch 
of space for merchandising, but for areas in which seniors have 
particular interest, it’s important to consider product height and 
not force seniors to stoop or bend down to merchandise placed 
too low, and also to try to place heavier products at a height that 
makes them easier to load into a cart. “Designer trends tend 
to lean toward ghostly pale text in graphics and signs, some-
times with barely legible font sizes. When considering a senior

shopper, we need to back off from that trend and have a better 
font size and contrast. The goal should be to convey a genuine 
sense of compassion through functionality as well as aesthet-
ics,” says Studach.
David Yehuda, president of DY Design Inc., stresses that 
efficient store design benefits all customers, regardless of age or 
disability, and makes their shopping experience more pleasant and 
comfortable. “Layouts and traffic flow are designed for the ease 
of all customers, as well as the efficiency of the store and its prod-
ucts,” he says. “Placing enough room between the checkouts, uti-
lizing signage with letters large enough to be seen and read by all, 
and applying lighting that illuminates signage, in addition to giv-
ing the products a punch of color and vibrancy, are all important.”
Yehuda believes that applying universal design principles 
benefits the senior population as well as people in other life 
stages and age groups. “Specifying slip-resistant flooring is 
another smart consideration for the young to the old,” he notes, 
“with toddlers running around and seniors often walking with 
canes or using walkers or wheelchairs.”
Good design choices are recommended by the designer 
and need to be approved by the store owner, Yehuda points out. 
Regulations, codes, and laws at the local, state, and federal lev-
els exist and influence these decisions, ensuring, for example, 
that wheelchair users have enough space to navigate through 
doors comfortably and safely. “Entryways are of huge impor-
tance,” he stresses. “If an entryway does have stairs, a ramp 
must be installed. Also required are handicapped toilets, which 
must be clearly marked and come equipped with handrails, an 
important safety measure.”
Improved technology in the future will afford seniors—and 
all shoppers—quicker and easier access to check prices and 
check out their food items, he says, and store designers will use 
their creativity to develop innovative graphics and store décor 
from natural and sustainable building materials.
Questions
1.	 Relate the material in this case to the value chain and the 
value delivery chain.

considered as expected customer services or augmented 
customer services? Why does this distinction matter?

this case?

apparel store chain.
Case 3: Is the Proliferation of Job Titles Helping or 
Hurting?*
The phrase is familiar: “Too many chiefs, not enough Indians.” 
In retailing, where so many firms employ thousands of people, 
the adage hardly seems applicable. Then again, the CEO and 
other C-suite regulars are now sharing the “chief” prefix with 
a growing list of colleagues. Macy’s has a chief digital officer, 
Kohl’s has a chief customer officer, and Target has a chief infor-
mation security officer. In recent years, there’s been a rise in the 
number of chief customer and chief digital officers hired; some

zine, June 2015, pp. 22–24. Reprinted by permission.
predict that an upsurge in chief content and chief social officer 
appointments is next.
Retail experts say these new positions reflect the fast-
paced change within an industry jumping headfirst into digital 
transformation. The newly appointed chiefs are tasked with cre-
ating business agility, tearing down function-focused silos, and 
applying their skills to the ever-mounting mission of exceeding 
customer expectations.
Nevertheless, there are those who are wary. Is the influx 
of new titles creating more silos than it is removing? Do the 
new chiefs have a boardroom seat? Will these roles be required 
10 years from now—or is this a fad? Not all the newly minted 
chiefs are regulars in the executive boardroom, but most are 
reporting to the CEO in some capacity.
“Data show that from the mid-1980s to 2010, the average 
C-suite doubled. Today that continues,” says Eamonn Kelly, a 
director with Deloitte Consulting. “Almost all the growth has 
been in functional, specialized areas. The goal is to transform 
a business to remain competitive and to focus on the customer 
holistically. Still achieving that coherence and alignment across 
multiple strategies is a challenge.”
Maryam Morse, national retail practice leader for Hay 
Group, maintains that the retail executive team “needs to be 
close to where innovation and change are happening, and, 
thus, we’re seeing more positions at the top. It’s not about 
E-­commerce or technology. It’s about putting the customer at 
the core of decision making.”
It’s become commonplace to link industry trends to the 
transformation of the customer experience and the rise of digital 
technology. Several years ago when the role of marketing began 
taking on amplified importance, the position of chief marketing 
officer quickly took root and discussions about collaborating with 
the CIO reached a fevered pitch. Overnight, it seemed, CMOs 
were tasked with leading dramatic change within their organiza-
tions while technology continued to evolve at a rapid-fire pace.
At many companies, the CMO realized that delivering a 
seamless experience to today’s customer—making shopping 
more personalized and communicating with engaging con-
tent—would require more exacting functional expertise.
“Different skill sets and organizational structures are 
needed in a digitally driven world,” says Susan Hart, co-leader 
of Spencer Stuart’s global retail, apparel, and luxury goods prac-
tice. “The idea that one single person can do it all may require a 
change in perception. That’s part of why we’re seeing not just a 
chief digital officer, but a chief content officer and a chief analyt-
ics officer. Tasking people to take on these specialized roles is 
intended to move the retailer closer to the customer.”
“The number of new chiefs in retail is more a reaction to 
new developments in the industry than expanding the C-suite,” 
comments Tom Cole, partner in the retail and consumer group 
at Kurt Salmon. “There are perhaps more pyramid heads than in 
the past, but they’re still reporting up to the CEO or the COO.” 
He adds that naming chiefs goes a long way toward clarifying 
responsibilities. “It designates who’s at the top of the pyramid 
and it sends a clear signal—both internally and externally—
about the importance of the role inside that retail company.”
Morse concurs. “Titles reflect company strategy. Elevating 
‘customer experience’ or ‘security’ responsibility to a ‘chief’ 
sends a message about where the retailer is making its bets and 
what it values.”

Case 4: Competition and Quick Foodservice*
Consumers have a need for convenient, quick, high-quality pre-
pared foods. As traditional convenience store (c-store) products 
slip in demand, c-store operators must place a stronger empha-
sis on prepared foods to improve profits. A growing number of 
c-store chains are providing high-quality, quick food supported by 
appealing, food-forward marketing. For quick-service restaurants 
(QSRs), this means many c-stores are now direct competitors.
Grocery stores are also focusing on prepared foods. Gro-
cery retailers were once very different from restaurants, serv-
ing customers’ needs for in-home meal preparation. But today, 
prepared, ready-to-eat meals and snacks are readily available in 
this channel. Grocery stores’ prepared meals offer quality and 
are growing in variety.
C-stores and grocery stores, historically different, now 
compete in the same space as traditional QSRs for the same 
customer and the same occasion. Most customers use multiple 
channels to purchase food for immediate consumption. Fewer 
than one in four U.S. consumers are exclusive QSR users for 
these meal occasions. Those who are exclusive QSR customers 
are just as likely to dine in or take away as other QSR users. 
Off-premise visits made by exclusive QSR buyers are likely 
vulnerable to shifts to other channels. The extent of the cus-
tomer-sharing, as seen through NPD research, demonstrates the 
channel blurring happening among retail and traditional quick 
foodservice segments.

Foodservice Heats Up,” Convenience Store News, January 2016, pp. 72,

Quick and convenient food from c-stores and grocery 
stores incrementally adds customers to the fast food/foodser-
vice market. Further, the number of fast-food purchases made 
by customers using these outlets is more than six visits higher in 
an average four-week period. Traditional QSRs offering morn-
ing meals are most likely to feel the impact of c-stores on their 
customer base. These occasions are likely in-and-out, grab-and-
go visits where convenience and fast service trump QSR chain 
preference.
Between-meal purchases/snacks is another competitive 
time of the day. C-stores hold their highest share of these product 
categories: coffee, snacks, breakfast foods, and soft drinks. Prod-
uct offerings vary, with some c-store chains emphasizing pre-
pared foods more than others. Grocery stores hold a high share 
of purchases of chicken, side dishes, and salads. They provide a 
ready-to-consume meal for the family —easy, convenient, and 
an opportunity to meet the needs of multiple family members.
Retail foodservice at c-stores and grocery stores is growing 
and expected to continue to grow. This growth delivers new and 
very different insights about the structure of the quick food-
service market from a consumer perspective. Consumers have 
a need for convenient, quick, high-quality prepared foods and 
whichever channel fills that need is where they will visit.
The challenge for all retailers offering quick-serve food is 
to find the best way to stand out among a diverse set of competi-
tors in order to grow market share. Figures 1 through 3 provide 
more information on the competitive battle. Note: Wawa is a 
c-store chain.

still space on the far side of the glass ceiling, and efforts like 
this can help lead to breakthrough.
Give Customers an Insider’s View
New York’s Fashion Week is the place where trendsetters come 
together. Now a fashionista in Iowa or Montana can do the 
same—without leaving the couch.
When Lauren Conrad’s collection for Kohl’s made its 
debut at the September 2015 Fashion Week, the actress-turned-
designer’s company wanted to bring along a few thousand 
friends. Using Conrad’s active and robust social media presence 
(nearly 11 million followers among several social-media sites) 
to issue invites, Kohl’s hosted the fashion show on the video 
streaming site Periscope. Those watching could chat and com-
ment live, or they could shop: The fashion items were instantly 
available for online purchase.
Traffic to Kohl’s Web site increased 600 percent during 
the show, and viewers even got a backstage peek before show 
time. It is just further proof that today’s consumers want to feel 
personally connected to a brand, and to feel that the brand likes 
them back.
Show Appreciation
Never forget: Little gestures can go a long way in helping 
employees feel valued and appreciated. Barbara Bradley Baek-
gaard, co-founder and chief creative officer of Vera Bradley, has 
maintained a personal touch throughout the impressive growth 
of her handbag, luggage, and accessories to $509 million in 
annual sales.
She recently told Fortune: “My father always said, ‘In 
business, you sell yourself first, your company second, and 
the product third; and he was right. Business is all about 
forming relationships and having a company that reflects 
your values.”
So how does that play out? Baekgaard told the magazine 
that when the company first started, the leadership would put 
$50 cash in employees’ birthday cards and instructed, “This 
has to be spent on you.” As the company has expanded to 3,000 
employees, there’s still a $50 bill in each card. “Finance asks 
every year if we can just put the money in people’s paychecks, 
and I say no,” she said. “When you have found money in cash, 
it’s just more meaningful.”
Give Associates an Insider’s View
Kohl’s gets another mention here, hosting a question-and-answer 
session with designer Vera Wang, who visited the ­retailer’s new 
Innovation Center near headquarters in Menomonee Falls, Wis-
consin. Associates in IT, store design, purchasing, and supply 
chain operations—who began moving into the new center in 
the summer—had the chance to interact with Wang and Kevin 
Mansell, Kohl’s chairman, president, and CEO.
The event, which Kohl’s called an opportunity to learn 
from the industry’s top talent, is part of Kohl’s multiyear Great-
ness Agenda strategy, which has “Winning Teams” as one of 
the core components. It is a realization that the retailer of the 
Ideas Worth Stealing*
Introduction
Feeling a day late and a dollar short for the retail innovation 
party? Not to worry; STORES has you covered. This year’s ros-
ter of the top “ideas worth stealing” offers copious opportunities 
for catching up. Retailers, small and large, have had a banner 
season of creatively making things work in this increasingly 
demanding industry—and many of their inspired concepts can 
be scaled up or down to fit other companies. Here, we celebrate 
their successes while broadening the guest list of possibility. 
Cheers!
Coalesce Product, Lifestyle, and Experience
Consider looking at marketing through a different lens. Warby 
Parker’s #seesummerbetter campaign encouraged consumers to 
“enjoy the ride” of the season by downloading a map of must-
see destinations across the United States, along with a Spotify 
playlist. Woven throughout, naturally, were the hottest styles in 
sunglasses. The free offerings were the perfect fit for a company 
founded on the premise that eyeglasses are too expensive; the 
fun, quirky graphics were aligned with the creative energy for 
which the company has become known. Destinations included 
Cadillac Ranch in Amarillo, Texas; Stax Museum of American 
Soul Music in Memphis, Tennessee; and the world’s largest 
ketchup bottle in Collinsville, Illinois, among others (including 
the company’s stores).
Warby Parker, incidentally, was named Fast Company’s 
Most Innovative Company of 2015, lauded for being the first 
great made-on-the-Internet brand. Warby Parker continues to 
expand its bricks-and-mortar presence with great success—so 
a road trip or two may well be in order.
Empower Success for Others
A sizable part of business is competition—but not all. Rent the 
Runway and global financial services provider UBS teamed 
up in 2015 to help women entrepreneurs across the country 
build high-growth, high-impact businesses through Project 
Entrepreneur.
Launched in September 2015 as the first initiative of the 
nonprofit Rent the Runway Foundation, Project Entrepreneur 
is a venture competition open to those beyond ideation and 
intending to build a high-growth company using an existing 
prototype or beta technology. The top 200 finalists attended an 
April 2016 workshop in New York, with three winning teams 
awarded $10,000 each and given a spot in a 5-week accelerator 
program. A series of free educational summits also took place.
Rent the Runway CEO Jennifer Hyman notes that despite 
the many entrepreneurial women founding businesses, only 4 
percent generate $500,000 or more in annual revenue. There’s

future will rely more heavily on associates than ever. Investing 
in developing their skills—and giving them access to top-notch 
experts—develops a lot more commitment than comes with just 
a steady paycheck.
Build Lasting Relationships through Innovative  
Memberships
At their best, neighborhood coffee shops are all about commu-
nity, the chance to see familiar faces over a steaming hot cup 
o’ joe. One New York City coffee shop, however, has expanded 
that idea—forgive us— quite a latte. Greenwich Village’s Fair 
Folks & a Goat is based on a subscription model: $25 a month 
gets members as many coffees, teas, and lemonades as they 
desire.
The shop, which opened in 2012, also features clothing, 
art, home design pieces, and other items that consumers don’t 
have to be members to purchase. Members do receive discounts 
on select merchandise, as well as invitations to various events 
and “access to a community and a home away from home.” 
A second location has been added in the East Village, and the 
community continues to expand; referred friends receive a free 
month’s membership. We can raise a mug to that.
Relearn to Sell Commodities
It’s been said that we live in a disruptive environment. Who 
knew that a bra needed disrupting? Fashion label Chromat and 
designer Becca McCharen have been doing just that.
McCharen’s background in architecture and urban design 
is focused on the human body, specifically in making architec-
turally structured foundations for garments like bras, swimwear, 
sportswear, and lingerie. Sure, it may be the more outlandish 
designs—such as architectural cages—that get the attention, 
especially when they appear on Beyoncé during a Super Bowl 
performance or at the Video Music Awards, but it’s the func-
tional aspects of some pieces that deserve notice.
In 2015, Chromat teamed with Intel to create two pieces 
using the technology company’s Curie Module: a bra that opens 
vents to cool down the body when it senses heat and sweat, and 
a 3D-printed dress that measures adrenaline levels and expands 
to mimic the “fight or flight” mode. It is proof that, in this dis-
ruptive age, even the most basic products are going high-tech 
and retailers will need to rethink sales strategies.
Foster Community with Shared Memories and Stories
A long time ago, in a boardroom far, far away, a Target leader 
must have fondly remembered space adventures gone by. In 
addition to hosting a “Shop the Force” event to promote Lucas-
film’s “Star Wars: Episode VII—The Force Awakens” with toys, 
apparel, and other items related to the film starting at midnight 
on September 4, 2015, the retailer offered a “Share the Force” 
experience both online and in stores.
In stores, consumers were given the opportunity to 
enjoy photo ops, giveaways, and demos of Star Wars toys on 
September 5. Online at SharetheForce.com, those consum-
ers were able to turn memories into “holograms” among the 
stars. The collected memories will eventually be archived at 
Lucasfilm (which is owned by Disney). It is a place, as Darth 
Vader might say, we can all meet again, at last. The circle is 
now complete.
Fight Unfairly for Shelf Space
There is no doubt that getting a new product onto a store’s 
shelves is a daunting task. Without proper placement, the prod-
uct simply won’t succeed. But barkTHINS, a chocolate snack, 
did anything but play fair: It used samples of its product to 
sweet-talk its way onto the store shelves.
Working with brand growth strategists at Switch, bark-
THINS hired area brand managers, typically health-conscious 
chocolate lovers, in select markets. The company not only 
stocked the area brand managers with samples of the product, 
but brand managers were allowed to negotiate with retailers when 
necessary. BarkTHINS was able to keep an eye on the progress 
of the area brand managers using a dashboard to monitor account 
visits, demos performed, and incremental retail sales. In today’s 
competitive environment, different strategies are required.
Confront Gender Stereotypes and Sexism
Nearly two-thirds of Brazilian women don’t agree with the way 
they are portrayed in advertising, according to a creative activ-
ism group. That’s likely impacted by the fact that only 10 per-
cent of the country’s advertising creatives are women. So what 
do you do with a product like beer? It depends: Is it Cerveja 
Feminista?
This “feminist beer,” introduced in 2015 by a group called 
65/10 in conjunction with Beauvoir Brewing, is as much a conver-
sation starter as it is a beverage. It’s a red ale, somewhere between 
the darker beers typically associated with men and the blonder 
brews associated with women. The label is in no way gender-
specific. But the conversation is rich. Cerveja Feminista has been 
covered by Fast Company, The Independent, and others, in stories 
that speak as much about women’s treatment as the beer. A Bra-
zilian a woman is killed every 90 minutes by domestic violence. 
The group 65/10 asserts that when women are objectified, they 
are considered possessions—which eventually leads to brutality.
Shake Up Perceptions
As an upscale retailer well entrenched in successful marketing 
initiatives, Nordstrom would be forgiven for playing it safe, 
especially where new technology is concerned. That relation-
ship with the tried and true became somewhat complicated in 
2015: To promote its summer sale, Nordstrom took to the roof 
with a 3D installation, mimicking its Leith leopard-print body 
dress as part of one giant Instagram post.
A 55-foot version of the dress, including a 25-foot-long 
wooden hanger, was installed on the roof of Nordstrom’s Seat-
tle flagship location. The entire installation—which included a 
woman walking across the roof wearing the leopard dress—was 
filmed by drones and posted live on social-media accounts. A 
time-lapse video of the installation was also created and shared 
via Instagram. This type of comprehensive social-media cam-
paign may not have resonated with its typical affluent customer, 
but Nordstrom was laying the groundwork to develop the next 
generation of shoppers.
Make the Most of Instagram
A picture is worth a thousand . . . sales? Visual commerce plat-
form Curalate has joined forces with eBay Enterprise to launch 
Like2Buy, which lets users click directly from Instagram photos 
to E-commerce product pages.

PART 1  •  AN OVERVIEW OF STRATEGIC RETAIL MANAGEMENT
The best part? The easy-to-deploy system works for pub-
lishers of all sizes, so the partnership gives users fast access to 
more than 100,000 publishers in the eBay Enterprise Affiliate 
Network. One publisher, according to Curalate, found that 60 
percent of visitors clicked through to relevant content, as well 
as spent 37 percent more time on the site than that publisher’s 
average mobile visitor.
eBay Enterprise considers the effort a “huge opportunity” 
to remove barriers from the buying experience, since 30 percent 
of total E-commerce spending is driven by mobile devices. It’s 
exactly what we all need: More reasons to spend time perusing 
photos.
Craft an Experience—and Listen for Cues

a revolution in bespoke menswear, attempting to know its cus-
tomers well enough to create “the best experience possible,” 
according to CEO and co-founder Colin Hunter. “We want our 
team to be observant hosts and hostesses, so we try to pick up 
on the small cues that naturally come up in conversation.”
Style preferences, clothing needs, and personal interests 
all help determine the best offerings. As for the customer data, 
that’s taken care of through NetSuite’s integrated customer 
relationship management, financial, inventory, and order man-
agement software. Hunter considers the partnership a “game-
changer,” allowing Alton Lane to track and access data as 
effortlessly as striking up a chat.
Take Advantage of Cutting-Edge Technology
Maybe it’s time for the Internet of Things (IoT) to move to 
the storefront. London’s Dandy Lab has done just that, using 
Cisco’s IoT technology and third-party software. The storefront 
was originally designed as a home for small independent Brit-
ish fashion designers, and while that is still at the base of the 
products, technology is used to drive sales.
Because people like a good story with their purchases, a 
customer can pick up a product, place it on a near-field com-
munication terminal, and see more about the brand on a large 
flat screen. Tablet-sized screens are embedded into the walls, 
displaying price, product details, and stock levels when an item 
is held in front of the screen. Another area allows a customer 
to show a product, color, or pattern and receive advice on other 
items that might pair—or clash—with it. In today’s increas-
ingly wired world, the Dandy Lab serves as something of a 
playground for retail’s next big wave.
Create a New Definition of “Showrooming”
Beijing-based Li Ning Company Limited (named for its 
founder, famed Chinese Olympic gymnast Li Ning) recently 
upped its game with a new model: physical showrooms where 
sporting goods customers can touch and feel products, but 
not buy.
The shift to online-only purchasing, as part of a strategy to 
overcome losses in recent years, has allowed the popular brand 
to keep thousands of locations open but distribute goods from a 
single warehouse, according to Bloomberg. That means reduc-
tions in costs plus improvements in inventory management. 
During the first month the strategy garnered the equivalent of 
$3.5 million in sales.
Li Ning is not alone in its approach. According to Bloom-
berg, Haier Electronics also featured display-only inventory in a 
number of its stores across China, and Hong Kong-based online 
clothing retailer Grana opened showrooms in Singapore, Aus-
tralia, and the United States in 2016.
Get Exposure in New Ways
When HGTV wanted to furnish its 2015 Urban Oasis, it turned 
to Overstock.com’s shelves. Overstock provided furniture, 
home décor, sporting goods, clothing, and accessories for the 
1,300-square-foot bungalow in Asheville, North Carolina. 
It wasn’t just the contest winner who came out on top. The 
Urban Oasis giveaway received Overstock contributions for its 
$500,000 grand-prize package awarded to one lucky viewer, 
and Overstock got additional exposure from the heavily pro-
moted giveaway.
Overstock received an added bonus: Since it provided more 
than furnishings (including a kayak), Overstock got to show its 
extensive lifestyle products. In addition to the television show, 
which offered a tour of the bungalow, and advertising, a dedi-
cated Web page featured copious images of the products used 
to pull the look together.
This is just one step in a blossoming relationship between 
Overstock and HGTV. The two also paired up on the TV shows 
“Vacation House for Free” and “Holiday House 2015.” The 
retailer took full advantage, creating dedicated Web pages that 
allowed viewers to shop and purchase the looks used on the 
programs.
Strategize Traditional Standbys
With the ever-increasing customization of retail, traditional ad 
circulars can seem a bit too one-size-fits-all. But personalized 
digital media company Catalina has introduced My Favorite 
Deals, allowing those circulars to be tailored for individual 
shoppers based on past purchases.
Delivered in-store, online, through E-mail, and on cell 
phones, My Favorite Deals brings five or more of the most rel-
evant offers to shoppers, increasing sales, driving retail trips, 
and building loyalty. Catalina found that 66 percent or more of 
weekly shoppers don’t buy a single item from a typical circular; 
with My Favorite Deals, retailers have seen an increase of up to 
1.5 percent in sales to targeted shoppers and an incremental lift 
of 1.5 to 5 percent in sales of promoted items.
Better yet, Catalina touts, My Favorite Deals needs no 
hardware or system changes for retailers, and the firm’s network 
already includes more than 28,000 U.S. grocery, drug, and mass 
merchandise stores.
Take Advantage of “X” Month
It seems like every day, week, and month offers some special 
theme. When it came time for Family Meals Month, midwest-
ern grocer Hy-Vee was ready to provide a solution to one of the 
greatest barriers to family meals: someone to plan and cook them.
The Dinner Crasher promotion selected a family shopping 
in selected stores to have a Hy-Vee chef and dietician “crash” 
dinner and create a custom dinner experience. After the family 
was selected in the store, dietary needs and preferences were 
discussed with the crash taking place later that week.

In Part Two, we talk about the organizational missions, ownership and 
management alternatives, goods/service categories, and objectives of a broad range of retail 
institutions. By understanding the unique attributes of these institutions, better retail strategies 
can be developed and implemented.
Chapter 4 examines the characteristics of retail institutions on the basis of ownership type: 
independent, chain, franchise, leased department, vertical marketing system, and consumer 
cooperative. We also discuss the methods used by manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers 
to obtain control in a distribution channel. A chapter appendix has additional information on 
franchising.
Chapter 5 describes retail institutions in terms of their strategy mix. We introduce three key 
concepts: the wheel of retailing, scrambled merchandising, and the retail life cycle. Strategic 
responses to the evolving marketplace are noted. Several strategy mixes are then studied, with 
food and general merchandise retailers reviewed separately.
Chapter 6 focuses on nonstore retailing, electronic retailing, and nontraditional retailing 
approaches. We cover direct marketing, direct selling, vending machines, the Web, video 
kiosks, and airport retailing. The dynamics of Web-based retailing are featured. A chapter 
appendix covers the emerging area of omnichannel retailing in more depth.

Store-based retail firms may operate as few as one facility—such as a local pizza shop—or 
as many as several thousand locations—such as the Subway fast-food chain with more than 
44,000 outlets around the world. Differences in scale, product portfolio mix, and product life 
cycle stage of the products carried; consumers’ pre-purchase, purchase, and post-purchase 
information and service needs; distribution channel structure; and laws and regulations 
contribute a retailer’s choice of ownership structure.
Most states have laws restricting the ability of auto dealers to sell new cars directly to 
consumers. These laws require that new cars be sold only through franchised dealers. 
Franchise agreements typically give a dealer an exclusive right to operate in a specific 
geographic area. Geographic protection enables a retailer to invest in a franchised location 
with the knowledge that its facilities will not directly compete with nearby dealers. Geographic 
protection also protects traditional dealers from direct price competition.

In contrast to the auto franchising model, Tesla Motors bypasses the franchise dealer network 
by selling cars directly to the consumer through Tesla-owned and operated retail centers. Tesla 
says it operates a different business than a traditional car manufacturer. (1) Unlike traditional 
dealers, Tesla does not stock unordered cars in inventory. It only builds cars based on customer 
orders. (2) Since Tesla’s technology is innovative, it needs time to explain product features. 
Dealers would not have salespeople that were as informed as Tesla’s or as willing to answer all 
questions. (3) Regular dealers often make more money by selling extended warranties and via 
financing than on the actual sale of the car. Tesla does not offer these services. (4) Automotive 
antitrust laws were designed to prevent manufacturers from competing with existing dealers. 
Tesla has no existing dealers. (5) Tesla pays sales personnel a salary; dealers pay them on a 
commission basis. The commission structure may encourage salespeople to seek higher prices 
from consumers and/or to sell them more costly cars and accessories than needed. And (6) 
Tesla says direct distribution lowers costs over dealer franchised networks.1
Overview
A retail institution is the basic format or structure of a business. In the United States, there are 
2.4 million retail firms (including those with no payroll, whereby only the owner and/or family 
members work for the firm), and they operate 3.2 million establishments. An institutional discus-
sion shows the relative sizes and diversity of different kinds of retailing, and indicates how various 
retailers are affected by the external environment. Institutional analysis is important in strategic 
planning when selecting an organizational mission, choosing an ownership alternative, defining 
the goods/service category, and setting objectives.
We examine retail institutions from these perspectives: ownership (discussed in this chapter); 
store-based strategy mix (Chapter 5); and nonstore-based, electronic, and nontraditional retailing 
(Chapter 6). Figure 4-1 shows a classification method for various retail institutions. An institu-
tion may be placed in more than one category: A department store may be part of a chain, have a 
store-based strategy, accept mail-order sales, and operate a Web site.
Please interpret the data in Chapters 4, 5, and 6 carefully. Some institutional categories are 
not mutually exclusive; thus, care should be taken in combining statistics so that double counting 
does not occur. We have drawn in the data in these chapters from a number of government and 
nongovernment sources. Although data are as current as possible, not all information corresponds 
to a common date. Census of Retail Trade data are collected only twice a decade. Furthermore, 
our numbers are based on the broad interpretation of retailing used in this book, which includes 
auto repair shops, hotels and motels, movie theaters, real-estate brokers, and others who sell to 
the final consumer.
RETAIL INSTITUTIONS CHARACTERIZED BY OWNERSHIP
Retail firms may be independently owned, chain-owned, franchisee-operated, leased departments, 
owned by manufacturers or wholesalers, or consumer-owned.
Although retailers are primarily small (three-quarters of all stores are operated by firms with 
one outlet and more than one-half of all firms have two or fewer paid employees), there are also 
very large retailers. The five leading U.S.-based retailers annually total $700 billion in U.S. sales 
alone and employ about 3 million people in the United States. Ownership opportunities abound. 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau (www.census.gov), women own one million retail firms, 
African Americans (men and women) 120,000 retail firms, Hispanic Americans (men and women) 
185,000 retail firms, and Asian Americans (men and women) 200,000 retail firms.
Each ownership format serves a marketplace niche, if the strategy is executed well:
▶
▶Independent retailers capitalize on a highly targeted customer base and please shoppers in a 
friendly, informal way. Word-of-mouth communication is important. These retailers should 
not try to serve too many customers or enter into price wars.
▶
▶Chain retailers benefit from their widely known image and from economies of scale and mass 
promotion possibilities. They should maintain their image chainwide and not be inflexible in 
adapting to changes in the marketplace.

112	
PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
▶
▶Franchisors have strong geographic coverage—due to franchisee investments—and the moti-
vation of franchisees as owner-operators. They should not get bogged down in policy disputes 
with franchisees or charge excessive royalty fees.
▶
▶Leased departments enable store operators and outside parties to join forces and enhance the 
shopping experience, while sharing expertise and expenses. They should not hurt the image 
of the store or place too much pressure on the lessee to generate store traffic.
▶
▶A vertically integrated channel gives a firm greater control over sources of supply, but it 
should not provide consumers with too little choice of products or too few outlets.
▶
▶Cooperatives provide members with cost savings due to pooled purchasing and joint own-
ership of a warehouse. They should not expect too much involvement by members or add 
facilities that raise costs too much.
Independent
An independent retailer owns one retail unit. We estimate that there are 2.3 million independent 
U.S. retailers—accounting for about one-quarter of total store sales. Seventy percent of indepen-
dents are run by the owners and their families; and those firms generate just 3 percent of U.S. 
store sales (averaging under $100,000 in annual revenues) and have no paid workers (there is no 
payroll).
The high number of independents is associated with the ease of entry into the marketplace, 
due to low capital requirements and no, or relatively simple, licensing provisions for many small 
retail firms. The investment per worker in retailing is usually much lower than for manufacturers, 
and licensing is pretty routine. Each year, tens of thousands of new retailers, mostly independents, 
open in the United States.
The ease of entry—which leads to intense competition—is a big factor in the high rate of 
failures among newer firms. One-third of new U.S. retailers do not survive the first year, and 
two-thirds do not continue beyond the third year. Most failures involve independents. Annually,

Toolkit (www.toolkit.com)

the independent retailer.

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has a Small Business Development Cen-
ter (SBDC) to assist current and prospective small business owners (www.sba.gov/content/

state) and more than 900 local SBDCs, satellites, and specialty centers. The purpose is to assist 
“small businesses with financial, marketing, production, organization, engineering, and technical 
problems and feasibility studies.” Centers offer free counseling, seminars and training sessions, 
­conferences, and information through the Internet, as well as in person and by phone. The SBA

In succession planning, a retailer develops a detailed plan as to a 
future change in leadership. Succession planning is crucial for any 
business that can unexpectedly lose a key executive due to illness, 
early retirement, incapacity, or accident. The need for succession 
planning is especially crucial for independent retailers because 
only one-third of family-owned businesses survive from one 
generation to the next. Here are some tips for a family-owned 
retailer: (1) Involve the successor in planning and decision making 
during a transition period, (2) Determine whether the successor 
needs more training and compensation, (3) Draft a legal docu-
ment outlining all terms of succession.
List other items that need to be discussed in the succession 
plan.

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF INDEPENDENTS  Independent retailers 
have various advantages and disadvantages. The following are among the advantages:
▶
▶There is flexibility in choosing retail formats and locations and in devising strategy. Because 
only one location is involved, detailed specifications can be set for the best site and a thorough 
search undertaken. Uniform location standards are not needed, as they are for chains, and 
independents do not have to worry about stores being too close together. Independents have 
great latitude in selecting target markets. Because they often have modest goals, small seg-
ments may be selected rather than the mass market. Assortments, prices, hours, and other 
factors are then set consistent with the segment.
▶
▶Investment costs for leases, fixtures, workers, and merchandise can be held down; and there 
is no duplication of stock or personnel. Responsibilities are clearly delineated within a store.
▶
▶Independents frequently act as specialists in a niche of a particular goods/service category. 
They are then more efficient and can lure shoppers interested in specialized retailers.
▶
▶Independents exert strong control over their strategies, and the owner-operator is often on 
the premises. Decisions are centralized and layers of management personnel are minimized.
▶
▶There is a certain image attached to independents, particularly small ones that chains cannot 
readily capture. This is the image of a personable retailer with a comfortable atmosphere in 
which to shop.
▶
▶Independents can easily sustain consistency in their efforts since only one store is operated.
▶
▶Independents have “independence.” They do not have to fret about stockholders, board of 
directors meetings, and labor unrest. They are often free from unions and seniority rules.
▶
▶Owner-operators typically have a strong entrepreneurial drive. They have made a personal 
investment and there is a lot of ego involvement. Research shows that independent retailers 
are more likely to “put customers’ interests first.” Their personal interaction with customers, 
flat organizational structure, and limited resources lead to efficient and effective customer-
oriented planning that improves profitability.3
These are some of the disadvantages of independent retailing:
▶
▶In bargaining with suppliers, independents may not have much power because they often buy 
in small quantities. Suppliers may even bypass them. Reordering may be difficult if minimum 
order requirements are high. Some independents, such as hardware stores, belong to buying 
groups to increase their clout.
▶
▶Independents generally cannot gain economies of scale in buying and maintaining inventory. 
Due to financial constraints, small assortments are bought several times per year. Transporta-
tion, ordering, and handling costs per unit are high.
▶
▶Operations are labor intensive, sometimes with little computerization. Ordering, taking inven-
tory, marking items, ringing up sales, and bookkeeping may be done manually. This is less 
efficient than computerization. In many cases, owner-operators are unwilling or unable to 
spend time learning how to set up and apply computerized procedures.
▶
▶Due to the relatively high costs of TV ads and the broad geographic coverage of magazines 
and some newspapers (too large for firms with one outlet), independents are limited in their 
access to certain media. Yet, there are various promotion tools available for creative inde-
pendents (see Chapter 19).
▶
▶A crucial problem for independents is overdependence on the owner. All decisions may be 
made by that person, and there may be no management continuity when the owner-boss is ill, 
on vacation, or retires. Financial concerns like how to pay bills, collect accounts receivables, 
and make payroll or the bank loan can overwhelm an independent retailer. This can also affect 
employee morale and long-run success.4
▶
▶A limited amount of time is allotted to long-run planning because the owner is intimately 
involved in daily operations of the firm.
Chain
A chain retailer operates multiple outlets (store units) under common ownership; it usually engages 
in some level of centralized (or coordinated) purchasing and decision making. In the United States, 
there are more than 110,000 retail chains that operate about 1 million establishments.

CHAPTER 4  •  Retail Institutions by Ownership	
115	
The relative strength of chain retailing is great, even though the number of firms is small (less 
than 5 percent of all U.S. retail firms). Chains today operate about 30 percent of retail establish-
ments, and because stores in chains tend to be considerably larger than those run by independents, 
chains account for roughly three-quarters of total U.S. store sales and employment. Although the 
majority of chains have 5 or fewer outlets, the several hundred firms with 100 or more outlets 
account for more than 60 percent of U.S. retail sales. Some big U.S. chains have at least 1,000 
outlets each. There are also many large foreign chains, as seen in Figure 4-3.
Chain dominance varies by type of retailer. Chains generate at least 75 percent of total U.S. 
category sales for department stores, discount department stores, and grocery stores. On the other 
hand, stationery, beauty salon, furniture, and liquor store chains produce far less than 50 percent 
of U.S. retail sales in their categories.
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF CHAINS  There are numerous competitive 
advantages for chain retailers:
▶
▶Many chains have bargaining power due to their purchase volume. They receive new items 
when introduced, have orders promptly filled, get sales support, and obtain quantity discounts. 
Large chains may also gain exclusive rights to certain items and have private-label goods 
produced under the chains’ brands.
▶
▶Chains achieve cost efficiencies when they buy directly from manufacturers and in large vol-
ume, ship and store goods, and attend trade shows sponsored by suppliers to learn about new 
offerings. They can sometimes bypass wholesalers, which results in lower supplier prices.
▶
▶Efficiency is gained by sharing warehouse facilities, purchasing standardized store fixtures, 
and so on; by centralized buying and decision making; and by other practices. Chains typi-
cally give headquarters’ executives broad authority for personnel policies and for buying, 
pricing, and advertising decisions.
▶
▶Chains use computers in ordering merchandise, taking inventory, forecasting, ringing up 
sales, and bookkeeping. This increases efficiency and reduces overall costs.
▶
▶Chains, particularly national or regional ones, can take advantage of a variety of media, from 
TV to magazines to newspapers to online blogs.
▶
▶Most chains have defined management philosophies, with detailed strategies and clear 
employee responsibilities. There is continuity when managerial personnel are absent or retire 
because there are qualified people to fill in and succession plans in place. See Figure 4-4.
▶
▶Many chains expend considerable time on long-run planning and assign specific staff to plan-
ning on a permanent basis. Opportunities and threats are carefully monitored.
Chain retailers also have a number of disadvantages:
▶
▶After chains are established, flexibility may be limited. New nonoverlapping store sites may 
be hard to find. Consistent strategies must be maintained throughout all units, including prices, 
promotions, and product assortments. It may be difficult to adapt to local diverse markets.
▶
▶Investments are higher due to multiple leases and fixtures. There is higher investment in 
inventory due to the number of store branches that must be stocked.
▶
▶Managerial control is complex, especially for chains with geographically dispersed branches. 
Top management cannot maintain the control over each branch that independents have over

The simplest loyalty program is a variation of “buy 10, get 1 
free.” Paper-based cards are the simplest to implement, but they 
don’t provide retailers with a customer database to track pur-
chases. The second program provides rebates to customers based 
on their cumulative purchases. A major disadvantage is that the 
retailer’s database contains no information on a customer except 
purchase activity. However, most major retailers have rewards 
trackers in their mobile apps. The most sophisticated programs 
track consumers by segment based on purchase history. Digitally 
enabled rewards program can customize promotions. They can 
also induce customers to upgrade to more profitable goods or 
services, decrease time between visits, or reward customers for 
feedback on social media.

their single outlet. Lack of communication and delays in making and enacting decisions are 
particularly problematic.
▶
▶Personnel in large chains often have limited independence because there are several manage-
ment layers and unionized employees. Some chains empower personnel to give them more 
authority.
Franchising5
Franchising involves a contractual arrangement between a franchisor (a manufacturer, whole-
saler, or service sponsor) and a retail franchisee, which allows the franchisee to conduct business 
under an established name and according to a given pattern of business. The franchisee typically 
pays an initial fee and a monthly percentage of gross sales in exchange for the exclusive rights to 
sell goods and services in an area. Small businesses benefit by being part of a large, chain-type 
retail institution.
In product/trademark franchising, a franchisee acquires the identity of a franchisor by 
agreeing to sell the latter’s products and/or operate under the latter’s name. The franchisee operates 
rather autonomously. There are some operating rules, but the franchisee sets hours, chooses a loca-
tion, and determines facilities and displays. Product/trademark franchising represents 60 percent 
of retail franchising sales. Examples are auto dealers and many gasoline service stations.
With business format franchising, there is a more interactive relationship between a fran-
chisor and a franchisee. The franchisee receives assistance on site location, quality control,

accounting systems, startup practices, management training, and responding to problems besides 
the right to sell goods and services. Prototype stores, standardized product lines, and coopera-
tive advertising foster a level of coordination previously found only in chains. Business format 
franchising arrangements are common for restaurants and other food outlets, real-estate, and 
service retailing. Due to the small size of many franchisees, business formats account for about 
80 percent of franchised outlets, although just 40 percent of total sales (including auto dealers). 
See Figure 4-5.
McDonald’s (www.aboutmcdonalds.com/mcd/franchising.html) is a good example of a busi-
ness format franchise arrangement. The firm provides franchisee training at Hamburger Univer-
sity, a detailed operating manual, regular visits by service managers, and brush-up training. In 
return for a 20-year franchising agreement with McDonald’s, a traditional franchisee generally 
must put up a minimum of $500,000 of nonborrowed personal resources and typically pays ongo-
ing royalty fees totaling at least 12.5 percent of gross sales to McDonald’s.
SIZE AND STRUCTURAL ARRANGEMENTS6  Although auto and truck dealers provide more 
than one-half of all U.S. retail franchise sales, few sectors of retailing have been unaffected by 
­franchising’s growth. In the United States, there are more than 3,000 retail franchisors doing busi-
ness with 350,000+ franchisees. They operate 850,000 franchisee- and franchisor-owned outlets, 
employ several million people, and generate one-third of total store sales. In addition, hundreds of  
U.S.-based franchisors have foreign operations, with tens of thousands of outlets.
About 85 percent of U.S. franchising sales and franchised outlets involve franchisee-
owned units; the rest involve franchisor-owned outlets. If franchisees operate one outlet, they 
are ­independents; if they operate two or more outlets, they are chains. Today, a large number of 
franchisees operate as chains.
As Figure 4-6 shows, three structural arrangements dominate retail franchising:
1.	 Manufacturer-retailer. A manufacturer gives independent franchisees the right to sell goods 
and related services through a licensing agreement.
2.	 Wholesaler-retailer.
a.	 Voluntary. A wholesaler sets up a franchise system and grants franchises to individual 
retailers.
b.	Cooperative. A group of retailers sets up a franchise system and shares the ownership and 
operations of a wholesaling organization.
3.	 Service sponsor-retailer. A service firm licenses individual retailers so they can offer specific 
service packages to consumers.

Selected Factors 
for Prospective 
Franchisees to 
Consider
Owning a franchise 
comes with defined costs, 
franchisor controls, and 
contractual obligations.

COSTS: In exchange for the
right to use the franchisor’s name
and beneﬁt from the franchisor’s
assistance, you will pay various
costs.
• Initial franchise fee and other expenses 
• Continuing royalty payments 
• Advertising fees 
FRANCHISOR CONTROLS:
To ensure uniformity, franchisors
often control how franchisees do
business. These controls may restrict
the ability to use your own judgment.
• Site approval
• Design or appearance standards
• Restrictions on goods/services sold
• Restrictions on method of operation
• Restrictions on sales area
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS:
Contracts last for the number of
years stated. You can lose the
right to your franchise if you don’t
comply with the contract.
• A franchisor can terminate the agreement for a
  variety of reasons.
• Renewals are not automatic. The franchisor may
  decline to renew or oﬀer a renewal that doesn’t
  have the same terms as the original contract.

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF FRANCHISING  Franchisees receive several 
benefits by investing in successful franchise operations:
▶
▶They own a retail enterprise with a relatively small capital investment.
▶
▶They acquire well-known names and goods/service lines.
▶
▶Standard operating procedures and management skills may be taught to them.
▶
▶Cooperative marketing efforts (such as regional or national advertising) are facilitated.
▶
▶They obtain exclusive selling rights for specified geographical territories.
▶
▶Their purchases may be less costly per unit due to the volume of the overall franchise.
Some potential problems do exist for franchisees:
▶
▶Oversaturation could occur if too many franchisees are in one geographic area.
▶
▶Due to overzealous selling by some franchisors, franchisees’ income potential, required mana-
gerial ability, and investment may be incorrectly stated.
▶
▶They may be locked into contracts requiring purchases from franchisors or certain vendors.
▶
▶Cancellation clauses may give franchisors the right to void agreements if provisions are not 
satisfied.
▶
▶In some industries, franchise agreements are of short duration.
▶
▶Royalties are often a percentage of gross sales, regardless of franchisee profits.
The preceding factors contribute to constrained decision making, whereby franchisors limit 
franchisee involvement in the strategic planning process.
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has a rule as to disclosure requirements and business 
opportunities (www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/amended-franchise-rule-faqs) 
that applies to all U.S. franchisors. It is intended to provide adequate information to potential 
franchisees prior to their investment. Although the FTC does not regularly review disclosure 
statements, nearly 20 states check them and may require corrections. Several states (including 
Arkansas, California, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, 
Nebraska, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin) have fair practice laws that do 
not let franchisors terminate, cancel, or fail to renew franchisees without just cause. The FTC has 
a franchising Web site (https://goo.gl/ivfnSW), as highlighted in Figure 4-7.

Franchisors accrue lots of benefits by having franchise arrangements:
▶
▶A national or global presence is developed more quickly and with less franchisor investment.
▶
▶Franchisee qualifications for ownership are set and enforced.
▶
▶Agreements require franchisees to abide by stringent operating rules set by franchisors.
▶
▶Money is obtained when goods are delivered rather than when they are sold.
▶
▶Because franchisees are owners and not employees, they have more incentive to work hard.
▶
▶Even after franchisees have paid for their outlets, franchisors receive royalties and may sell 
products to the individual proprietors.
Franchisors also face potential problems:
▶
▶Franchisees harm the overall reputation if they do not adhere to company standards.
▶
▶A lack of uniformity among outlets adversely affects customer loyalty.
▶
▶Intrafranchise competition is not desirable.
▶
▶The resale value of individual units is injured if franchisees perform poorly.
▶
▶Ineffective franchised units directly injure franchisors’ profitability that results from selling 
services, materials, or products to the franchisees and from royalty fees.
▶
▶Franchisees, in greater numbers, are seeking to limit franchisors’ rules and regulations.

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
Leased Department
A leased department is a department in a retail store—usually a department, discount, or ­specialty 
store—that is rented to an outside party. The leased department proprietor is responsible for all 
aspects of its business (including fixtures) and normally pays a percentage of sales as rent. The 
host retailer earns a steady income renting out extra space and the leased department gets market 
access at a smaller footprint at a lower negotiated cost. The store sets operating restrictions for 
the leased department to ensure overall consistency and coordination.7
Leased departments (sometimes called “stores within a store” or kiosks with even smaller 
footprints) are used by store-based retailers to broaden their offerings into product categories 
that often are on the fringe of the store’s major product lines. They are most common for in-store 
beauty salons; banks; photographic studios; and shoe, jewelry, cosmetics, watch repair, and shoe 
repair departments. Leased departments are also popular in shopping center food courts. They 
account for $20 billion in annual department store sales. More luxury brands, such as Gucci and 
Dior, are leasing out departments to have greater control over the way their products are sold. Data 
on overall leased department sales are not available.
The stores-within-a-store concept provides host retailers and their lessees with ­opportunities 
to cross-market their brands and reach new demographics. Leased spaces can add excitement to 
the customers’ shopping experience, add variety to the retailer’s product assortment, and ­encourage 
customers to linger longer and make impulse purchases. The success and failure of this ­strategy 
for the retailer depends on the choice of the right retail partners, making sure they complement 
the host retailer and have the potential to attract a new customer base for the host retailer. The 
strategy must also be supported by an appropriate level of advertising by both the host retailer and 
retail partners to generate awareness of the locations of the leased department stores. A ­successful 
example is Sephora, which has operated leased departments in J.C. Penney stores since 2006. 
Sephora’s presence has helped energize and reinvent Penney’s image.
Here are other examples: CVS bought the rights to run Target’s pharmacies and health clinics 
at 1,660 locations for $1.9 billion; it rebranded them as CVS with added digital healthcare tools. 
This increased CVS’s retail footprint by 20 percent and helped capture pharmacy purchases made 
in general merchandise stores. Target can offer customers integrated pharmacy services with CVS 
expertise, and focus on improving performance in its core product areas.8 Finish Line offers an 
exclusive shoe line in its almost 600-branded shops at Macy’s department stores. As a result, Fin-
ish Line has enjoyed strong sales and Macy’s has seen an increase in foot traffic.9
For retailers facing declining sales, leasing out space may be part of a retrenchment strategy, 
to reduce their footprint while generating stable income. Sears hosts the trendy Forever 21, a 
women’s fashions business. Walmart Realty says it has almost 400 in-store leases ready for some 
well-matched retailer that sees a benefit in letting “Walmart’s repeat customers become [their] 
repeat customers.” Retailers in Europe and Asia have used the concept extensively—nearly all 
major Chinese retailers are really a conglomeration of ever-changing smaller stores that stand up 
in competition or are pruned from the landscape.10
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF LEASED DEPARTMENTS  From the stores’ 
perspective, leased departments offer a number of benefits:
▶
▶The market is enlarged by providing one-stop customer shopping.
▶
▶Personnel management, merchandise displays, and reordering are undertaken by lessees.
▶
▶Regular store personnel do not have to be involved.
▶
▶Leased department operators pay for some expenses, thus reducing store costs.
▶
▶A percentage of revenues is received regularly.
There are also some potential pitfalls from the stores’ perspective:
▶
▶Leased department operating procedures may conflict with store procedures.
▶
▶Lessees may adversely affect stores’ images.
▶
▶Customers may blame problems on the stores rather than on the lessees.
For leased department operators, there are these advantages:
▶
▶Stores are known, have steady customers, and offer immediate sales for leased departments.
▶
▶Some costs are reduced through shared facilities, such as security equipment and display 
windows.
CVS (www.cvs.com/
target) has flourished 
with its leased department 
relationship at Target.

	
CHAPTER 4  •  Retail Institutions by Ownership	
121	
▶
▶Their image is enhanced by their relationships with popular stores.
▶
▶The operators have greater control over their own image and selling strategy than if the retail-
ers act as the resellers.
Lessees face these possible problems:
▶
▶There may be inflexibility as to the hours they must be open and the operating style.
▶
▶The goods/service lines are usually restricted.
▶
▶If they are successful, stores may raise rent or not renew leases when they expire.
▶
▶In-store locations may not generate the sales expected.
An example of a thriving long-term lease arrangement is one between Luxottica and Macy’s. 
Luxottica started with Sunglass Hut shops in Macy’s stores in 2009 to offer optical products and 
services to Macy’s customers. Sunglass Hut shops have grown to 670 Macy’s locations; and in 
April 2016, Luxottica agreed to establish LensCrafters shops in 500 Macy’s locations.11
Vertical Marketing System
A vertical marketing system consists of all the levels of independently owned businesses along a 
channel of distribution. Goods and services are normally distributed through one of these systems: 
independent, partially integrated, and fully integrated. See Figure 4-8.
Although the Federal Trade Commission (www.ftc.gov) has 
specific requirements that govern legal behavior by franchises, 
there are some gray areas (legal activities that may be unethical) 
concerning franchisor strategies. For example, many contracts 
between franchisors and franchisees do not give a franchisee 
an exclusive territory. Also, franchisees may be required to buy 
goods from the franchisor. And some franchisors may retain the 
most profitable locations as company-operated units, rather than 
sell them to franchisees.
Comment on the above from the perspective of franchisor-
franchisee relationships

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
In an independent vertical marketing system, there are three levels of independently owned 
firms: manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. Such a system is most often used if manufacturers 
or retailers are small, intensive distribution is sought, customers are widely dispersed, unit sales 
are high, company resources are low, channel members seek to share costs and risks, and task 
specialization is desirable. Independent vertical marketing systems are used by many stationery 
stores, gift shops, hardware stores, food stores, drugstores, and many other firms. They are the 
leading form of vertical marketing system.
With a partially integrated system, two independently owned businesses along a channel 
perform all production and distribution functions. It is most common when a manufacturer and 
a retailer complete transactions and shipping, storing, and other distribution functions in the 
absence of a wholesaler. This system is most apt if manufacturers and retailers are large, selective 
or exclusive distribution is sought, unit sales are moderate, company resources are high, greater 
channel control is desired, and existing wholesalers are too expensive or unavailable. Partially 
integrated systems are often used by furniture stores, appliance stores, restaurants, computer 
retailers, and mail-order firms.
Through a fully integrated system, one firm performs all production and distribution func-
tions. The firm has total control over its strategy, direct customer contact, and exclusivity over 
its offering; it also keeps all profits. This system can be costly and requires a lot of expertise. In 
the past, vertical marketing was employed mostly by manufacturers, such as Avon and Sherwin-
Williams. At Sherwin-Williams, its own 4,100 paint stores account for nearly 60 percent of total 
company sales.12 Today, more retailers (such as Kroger) use fully integrated systems for at least 
some products.
Some firms use dual marketing (a form of multichannel retailing) and engage in more than 
one type of distribution arrangement. Thus, firms appeal to different consumers, increase sales, 
share some costs, and retain a lot of strategic control. One example is Sherwin-Williams which sells 
Sherwin-Williams paints at company stores, but it sells Dutch Boy paints in home-improvement 
stores, full-line discount stores, hardware stores, and others. See Figure 4-9. As another example, 
in addition to its traditional standalone outlets, Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins share facilities 
in numerous locations, so as to attract more customers and increase the revenue per transaction.
Besides partially or fully integrating a vertical marketing system, a firm can exert power in a 
distribution channel because of its economic, legal, or political strength; superior knowledge and 
abilities; customer loyalty; or other factors. With channel control, one member of a distribution 
channel dominates the decisions made in that channel due to the power it possesses. Manufactur-
ers, wholesalers, and retailers each have a combination of tools to improve their positions relative 
to one another.
Manufacturers exert control by franchising, developing strong brand loyalty, pre-ticketing 
items (to designate suggested prices), and using exclusive distribution with retailers that agree to

and nonfood products in its

certain standards in exchange for sole distribution rights in an area. Wholesalers exert influence 
when they are large, introduce their own brands, sponsor franchises, and are the most efficient 
members in the channel for tasks such as processing reorders. Retailers exert clout when they 
represent a large percentage of a supplier’s sales volume and when they foster their own brands. 
Private brands let retailers switch vendors with no impact on customer loyalty, as long as the same 
product features are included.
Strong long-term channel relationships often benefit all parties. They lead to scheduling effi-
ciencies and cost savings. Advertising, financing, billing, and other tasks are greatly simplified.
Consumer Cooperative
A consumer cooperative is a retail firm owned by its customer members. A group of consumers 
invests, elects officers, manages operations, and shares the profits or savings that accrue.13 In the 
United States, there are several thousand such cooperatives, from small buying clubs to Recre-
ational Equipment Inc. (REI), with $2.5 billion in annual sales. Consumer cooperatives have been 
most popular in food retailing. Yet, the 500 or so U.S. food cooperatives account for less than 1 
percent of total grocery sales.
Consumer cooperatives exist for these basic reasons: Some consumers feel they can operate 
stores as well as or better than traditional retailers. They think existing retailers inadequately fulfill 
customer needs for healthful, environmentally safe products. They also assume existing retailers 
make excessive profits and that they can sell merchandise for lower prices.
Recreational Equipment Inc. sells outdoor recreational equipment to 5.5 million mem-
bers and other customers. It has about 140 stores, a mail-order business, and a Web site  
(www.rei.com). Unlike other cooperatives, REI is run by a professional staff that adheres to 
­policies set by the member-elected board. There is a $20 one-time membership fee, which allows 
customers to shop at REI, vote for directors, and share in profits (based on the amount spent by 
each member). REI’s goal is to distribute a regular dividend to members.
Cooperatives are only a small part of retailing because they involve consumer initiative and 
drive, consumers are usually not expert in retailing functions, cost savings and low selling prices 
are often not as expected, and consumer boredom in running a cooperative frequently occurs.
As an REI member (www 
.rei.com/membership/
benefits), look at what $20 
will get you!
Recently, KFC (originally called Kentucky Fried Chicken) opened 
a futuristic restaurant in Shanghai’s National Exhibition and Con-
vention Center. It was designed to be digitalized. KFC refers to 
this store as “Original +”—the firm’s designated name for KFC’s 
traditional fried chicken recipe. The highlight of this store is the 
presence of two voice-activated robots named “dumi.” They 
enable customers to order and pay for their meal. The robots, 
developed by Baidu (a China-based company), turn their bodies 
and heads when interacting with a customer. The robots can-
not accept payment, but they can display a QR (quick response) 
code. The customer can pay by scanning the code with a mobile 
payment app.
Are these robots just a novelty or the wave of the future? 
Explain your answer.

Chapter Summary
1.	 To show the ways in which retail institutions can be clas-
sified. There are 2.4 million retail firms in the United 
States operating 3.2 million establishments. They can be 
grouped on the basis of ownership, store-based strategy 
mix, and nonstore-based and nontraditional retailing. 
Many retailers can be placed in more than one category. 
This chapter deals with retail ownership. Chapters 5 and 
6 report on the other classifications.
2.	 To study retailers on the basis of ownership type, and to 
examine the characteristics of each. About 70 ­percent 
of U.S. retail establishments are independents, each 
with one store. This is mostly due to the ease of entry. 
Independents’ competitive advantages include their flex-
ibility, low investments, specialized offerings, direct 
strategy control, image, consistency, independence, and 
entrepreneurial spirit. Disadvantages include limited 

124	
PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
bargaining power, few economies of scale, labor inten-
sity, reduced media access, overdependence on owner, 
and limited planning.
Chains are multiple stores under common owner-
ship, with some centralized buying and decision ­making. 
They account for 30 percent of U.S. retail outlets but  
75 percent of retail sales. The advantages of chain stores 
are bargaining power, functional efficiencies, multiple-
store operations, computerization, media access, well-
defined management, and planning. The problems they 
often are inflexibility, high investments, reduced control, 
and limited independence of personnel.
Franchising embodies arrangements between franchi-
sors and franchisees that let the latter do business under 
established names and according to detailed rules. It 
accounts for one-third of U.S. store sales. Franchisees 
benefit from small investments, popular company names, 
standardized operations and training, cooperative mar-
keting, exclusive selling rights, and volume purchases. 
They may face constrained decision making, resulting in 
oversaturation, lower-than-promised profits, strict con-
tract terms, cancellation clauses, short-term contracts, 
and royalty fees. Franchisors benefit by expanding their 
businesses, setting franchisee qualifications, improving 
cash flow, outlining procedures, gaining motivated fran-
chisees, and receiving ongoing royalties. They may suf-
fer if franchisees hurt the company image, do not operate 
uniformly, compete with one another, lower resale values 
and franchisor profits, and seek greater independence.
Leased departments are in-store locations rented to 
outside parties. They usually exist in categories on the 
fringe of their stores’ major product lines. Stores gain 
from the expertise of lessees, greater traffic, reduced 
costs, merchandising support, and revenues. Poten-
tial store disadvantages are conflicts with lessees and 
adverse effects on store image. Lessee benefits are well-
known store names, steady customers, immediate sales, 
reduced expenses, economies of scale, an image associ-
ated with the store, and more control over their strategy. 
Potential lessee problems are operating inflexibility, 
restrictions on items sold, lease nonrenewal, and poorer 
results than expected.
Vertical marketing systems consist of all the levels 
of independently owned firms along a channel of dis-
tribution. Independent systems have separately owned 
manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. In partially 
integrated systems, two separately owned firms, usually 
manufacturers and retailers, perform all production and 
distribution functions. With fully integrated systems, 
single firms do all production and distribution func-
tions. Some firms use dual marketing, whereby they are 
involved in more than one type of system.
Consumer cooperatives are owned by their customers 
who invest, elect officers, manage operations, and share 
savings or profits. They account for a tiny piece of retail 
sales. Cooperatives are formed because consumers think 
they can do retailing functions, traditional retailers are 
inadequate, and prices are high. They have not grown 
much because consumer initiative is required, expertise 
may be lacking, expectations have frequently not been 
met, and boredom occurs.
3.	 To explore the methods used by manufacturers, whole-
salers, and retailers to exert influence in the distribution 
channel. Even without an integrated vertical marketing 
system, channel control can be exerted by the most pow-
erful firm(s) in a channel. Manufacturers, wholesalers, 
and retailers each have ways to increase their impact. 
Retailers’ influence is greatest when they are a large part 
of their vendors’ sales and private brands are used.

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
The Dynamics of Franchising
This appendix is presented because of franchising’s strong retailing presence and the exciting 
opportunities in franchising. Over the past two decades, annual U.S. franchising sales have more 
than tripled! Here, we go beyond the discussion of franchising in Chapter 4 and provide informa-
tion on managerial issues in franchising and on franchisor–franchisee relationships.
Consider this, for example: In 1999, Tariq and Kamran Farid opened their first Edible 
Arrangements store in East Haven, Connecticut. The initial franchised store opened dur-
ing 2001 in Waltham, Massachusetts. Now, due to franchising, Edible Arrangements has 
over 1,200 stores worldwide, mostly franchised. The firm was recently ranked number 9 on 
Forbes magazine’s “Top Franchises for the Money” and number 1 in its category in “Entre-
preneur Magazine’s Franchise 500” (for nine consecutive years) and also regularly appears 
in Entrepreneur’s “Top 50 of the “Fastest-Growing Franchises,” and “America’s Top Global 
Franchises,”1
How about Dunkin’ Donuts? It is the number 1 retailer of hot and iced regular coffee-by-the-
cup in the United States and the largest coffee and baked goods chain in the world. Dunkin’ Donuts 
sells over 1.7 billion cups of coffee per year with 70 varieties of donuts and over a dozen coffee 
beverages (as well as bagels, breakfast sandwiches, and other baked goods).There are over 8,000 
franchised Dunkin’ Donuts in the United States and an additional 3,200 shops in over 32 countries 
throughout the world. Financial requirements are a minimum net worth of $500,000 and a mini-
mum liquid capital of $250,000.2
U.S. franchisors are situated in over 170 countries, a number that is rising due to these fac-
tors: U.S. firms see the foreign market potential. Franchising is accepted as a retailing format in 
more nations. And trade barriers are fewer due to such pacts as the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, which makes it easier for firms based in the United States, Canada, and Mexico to 
operate in each other’s marketplaces.
The following Web sites will give you more information on franchising:
▶
▶Federal Trade Commission (https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/
consumers-guide-buying-franchise)
▶
▶International Franchise Association (http://www.franchise.org/)
▶
▶Small Business Administration (https://www.sba.gov/starting-business/how-start-business/
business-types/franchise-businesses)
Managerial Issues in Franchising
Franchising appeals to franchisees for several reasons. Most franchisors have easy-to-learn, stan-
dardized operating methods that they have perfected. Also, new franchisees do not have to learn 
from their own trial-and-error method. Additionally, franchisors often have facilities where fran-
chisees are trained to operate equipment, manage employees, keep records, and improve customer 
relations; there are usually follow-up field visits.
A new outlet of a nationally advertised franchise (such as Burger King) can attract a large 
customer following rather quickly and easily because of the reputation of the firm. And not only 
does franchising result in good initial sales and profits but it also reduces franchisees’ risk of 
failure if the franchisees affiliate with strong, supportive franchisors.
Investment and startup costs for a franchised outlet can be as low as a few thousand dollars 
for a personal service business to as high as several million dollars for a hotel. In return for its 
expenditures, a franchisee gets exclusive selling rights for an area; a business format franchisee 
gets training, equipment and fixtures, and support in site selection; as well as supplier negotiations, 
advertising, and so on. Besides receiving fees and royalties from franchisees, franchisors may sell 
goods and services to them. This may be required—more often, for legal reasons, such purchases 
are at the franchisees’ discretion (subject to franchisor specifications). Each year, franchisors sell 
billions of dollars’ worth of items to franchisees.
Look at the “Franchise” 
section of Edible 
Arrangements’ Web site 
(www.ediblearrangements

Table A4-1 shows the franchise fees, startup costs, and royalty fees for new franchisees at 10 
leading franchisors in various business categories. Financing support—either through in-house 
financing or third-party financing—is offered by most of the firms cited in Table A4-1. In addition, 
with its guaranteed loan program, the U.S. Small Business Administration is a good financing 
option for prospective franchisees, and some banks offer special interest rates for franchisees 
affiliated with established franchisors.
Franchised outlets can be bought (leased) from franchisors, master franchisees, or existing 
franchisees. Franchisors sell either new locations or company-owned outlets (some of which may 
have been taken back from unsuccessful franchisees). At times, they sell rights in entire regions or 
counties to master franchisees, which deal with individual franchisees. Existing franchisees usually 
have the right to sell their units if they first offer them to their franchisor, if potential buyers meet 
all financial and other criteria, and/or if buyers undergo training. Of interest to prospective fran-
chisees is the emphasis a firm places on franchisee-owned outlets versus franchisor-owned ones.
One last point regarding managerial issues in franchising concerns the failure rate of new 
franchisees. For many years, it was believed that success as a franchisee was a “sure thing”—and 
much safer than starting a business—due to the franchisor’s well-known name, its experience, 
and its training programs. However, some recent research has shown franchising to be as risky as 
opening a new business. Why? Some franchisors have oversaturated the market and not provided 
promised support, and unscrupulous franchisors have preyed on unsuspecting investors.
Figure A4-1 has a checklist by which potential franchisees can assess opportunities. In using 
the checklist, franchisees should also obtain full prospectuses and financial reports from all fran-
chisors under consideration, and talk to existing franchise operators and customers.
Franchisor–Franchisee Relationships
Many franchisors and franchisees have good relationships because they share goals for company 
image, operations, the goods and services offered, cooperative ads, and sales and profit growth.
Nonetheless, for several reasons, tensions do sometimes exist between various franchisors 
and their franchisees:
▶
▶The franchisor–franchisee relationship is not one of employer to employee. Franchisor con-
trols are often viewed as rigid.
▶
▶Many agreements are considered too short by franchisees.
▶
▶The loss of a franchise often means eviction, and the franchisee gets nothing for “goodwill.”
▶
▶Some franchisors believe their franchisees do not reinvest enough in their outlets or care 
enough about the consistency of operations from one outlet to another.
▶
▶Franchisors may not give adequate territorial protection and may open new outlets or allow 
other franchisees to locate near existing ones.

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
▶
▶Franchisees may refuse to participate in cooperative advertising programs.
▶
▶Franchised outlets up for sale must usually be offered first to franchisors, which also have 
approval of sales to third parties.
▶
▶Some franchisees believe franchisor marketing support is low.
▶
▶Franchisees may be prohibited from operating competing businesses.
▶
▶Restrictions on suppliers may cause franchisees to pay more and have limited choices.
▶
▶Franchisees may band together to force changes in policies and exert pressure on franchisors.
▶
▶Sales and profit expectations may not be realized.
Tensions can lead to conflicts—even litigation. Potential negative franchisor actions include 
ending agreements; reducing marketing support; and adding red tape for orders, data requests, and 
warranty work. Potential negative franchisee actions include ending agreements, adding competi-
tors’ items, not promoting goods and services, and not complying with data requests.
Although franchising has been characterized by franchisors having more power than fran-
chisees, this inequality is being reduced. First, franchisees affiliated with specific franchisors 
have joined together. For example, the Association of Kentucky Fried Chicken Franchisees and 
National Coalition of Associations of 7-Eleven Franchisees represent thousands of franchisees. 
Second, large umbrella groups, such as the American Franchisee Association (www.franchisee 
.org) and the American Association of Franchisees & Dealers (www.aafd.org), have been formed. 
Third, many franchisees now operate more than one outlet, so they have greater clout. Fourth, 
there has been a substantial rise in litigation.

Better communication and better cooperation help resolve problems. Two progressive tactics 
are the International Franchise Association (www.franchise.org/mission-statementvisioncode-of-
ethics), which has an ethics code for its franchisor and franchisee members, founded on the prin-
ciple that each franchisor–franchisee relationship requires mutual commitment by both parties. 
The National Franchise Mediation Program seeks to resolve franchisor–franchisee disagreements. 
All mediation efforts are voluntary, confidential, nonbinding, and informal: “Typically, disputes 
that are mediated are concluded expeditiously at moderate cost compared to disputes that are 
arbitrated or litigated. Since its inception in 1993, a success rate of approximately 90 percent has 
been achieved in mediations in which the franchisee agreed to participate and in which a mediator 
was needed. Many cases are resolved without intervention of a mediator.”3

mixes
In virtually every retail format, there is a great deal of competition. Here, we cover a total of 14 
different retail formats—six are food-oriented and eight are focused more on nonfood goods 
and services. What is clear is that more shoppers than ever are interested in low prices, and 
many retail formats have adapted accordingly. One such format is the factory outlet.
In the past, manufacturers set up factory outlet stores to recoup some of the costs associated 
with the manufacturing of defective merchandise. Many of the goods sold in these stores were 
broken lots (incomplete selections), seconds (minor rips in clothing or scratches on appliances), 
and gently used products that were returned by retailers and final consumers.
This manner of business was a far cry from the current factory outlet approach operated by 
retailers such as Brooks Brothers, Ralph Lauren, Gap, and Coach. Today’s outlets may be located in 
shopping centers, and feature attractive atmosphere, well-trained salespeople, and fitting rooms. 
Today, there are even large shopping areas that feature nothing but factory outlet stores, such as 
the Kittery Outlets in Maine, in which there are more than 120 outlets. Another selling point for 
factory outlets now is that most accept credit cards and have return and exchange privileges.
Factory outlet stores usually receive items from two sources: planned and opportunistic. The 
planned sources consist of goods made especially for outlets (often with lower-quality fabrics 
and less tailoring). These sources enable outlet stores to have a wide selection of merchandise 
throughout the year. This kind of merchandise also helps outlet stores attract a more price-
conscious shopper. Opportunistic purchases are based on closeouts, returns from department

stores, overstocks, and broken lots. A major benefit of these goods is that they encourage 
shoppers to treasure hunt (visit the store frequently).
Some firms prefer to sell at factory outlets rather than at closeout retailers such as Marshall’s, 
Off Saks (discount unit of Saks Fifth Avenue), and The Rack (discount unit of Nordstrom’s). 
Selling through company-owned and operated factory outlets gives the seller greater control 
over both the final selling price and the store locations where the discounted goods are sold. 
Some firms, however, are concerned that sales of heavily discounted goods at factory outlet 
locations will anger traditional department and specialty stores.
Overview
In Chapter 4, retail institutions were described by ownership. In this chapter, we cover three key 
concepts in planning a retail strategy: wheel of retailing, scrambled merchandising, and retail life 
cycle. We then look at how retail strategies are evolving and study the strategies of several store-
based formats. Chapter 6 deals with nonstore-based, electronic, and nontraditional strategies.
CONSIDERATIONS IN PLANNING A RETAIL STRATEGY MIX
A retailer may be categorized by its strategy mix, the firm’s particular combination of store loca-
tion, operating procedures, goods/services offered, pricing tactics, store atmosphere and customer 
services, and promotional methods.
Store location refers to the use of a store or nonstore format, placement in a geographic 
area, and the kind of site (such as a shopping center). Operating procedures include the person-
nel employed, management style, store hours, and other factors. The goods/services offered may 
encompass many product categories or just one; quality may be low, medium, or high. Pricing 
refers to the use of prestige pricing (creating a quality image), competitive pricing (setting prices 
at the level of rivals), or penetration pricing (underpricing other retailers). Store atmosphere and 
customer services are reflected by the physical facilities and personal attention, return policies, 
delivery, and more. Promotion involves activities in such areas as advertising, displays, personal 
selling, and sales promotion. By combining the elements, a retailer can devise a unique strategy.
To flourish today, a retailer should strive to be dominant in some way. The firm may then 
reach destination retailer status, whereby consumers view the company as distinctive enough 
to be loyal to it and go out of their way to shop there. We tend to link “dominant” with “large 
geographic footprint.” Yet, both small and large retailers can be influential in different ways, by 
dominating their consumer’s choices based on time, money spent, or status upheld. As shown here, 
there are many ways to be a destination retailer, and combining two or more approaches can yield 
even greater appeal for a given retailer:
▶
▶Be price-oriented and cost-efficient to attract price-sensitive shoppers.
▶
▶Be upscale to attract full-service, status-conscious consumers.
▶
▶Be convenient to attract those consumers who want shopping ease, nearby locations, or 
extended hours.
▶
▶Offer a dominant assortment in the product lines carried to appeal to customers interested in 
variety and in-store shopping comparisons.
▶
▶Offer superior customer service to attract those frustrated by the decline in retail service.
▶
▶Be innovative or exclusive and provide a unique way of operating (such as kiosks at airports) 
or carry products/brands not stocked by others to reach people who are innovators or bored.
Before looking at specific strategy mixes, let’s consider three concepts that help explain the 
use of these mixes: the wheel of retailing, scrambled merchandising, and the retail life cycle—as 
well as the ways in which retail strategies are evolving.
The Wheel of Retailing
According to the wheel of retailing theory, retail innovators often first appear as low-price opera-
tors with low costs and low profit margin requirements. Over time, the innovators upgrade the 
products they carry and improve their facilities and customer service (by adding better-quality 

132	
PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
items, locating in higher-rent sites, providing credit and delivery, and so on), and prices rise. As 
innovators mature, they become vulnerable to new discounters with lower costs—hence, the wheel 
of retailing.1 See Figure 5-1.
The wheel is based on four principles: (1) Many price-sensitive shoppers will trade customer 
services, wide selections, and convenient locations for lower prices. (2) Price-sensitive shoppers 
are often not loyal and will switch to retailers with lower prices. In contrast, prestige-oriented 
customers enjoy shopping at retailers with high-end strategies. (3) New institutions are frequently 
able to have lower operating costs than existing formats. (4) As retailers move up the wheel, they 
typically do so to increase sales, broaden the target market, and improve their image.
For example, when traditional department store prices became too high for many consum-
ers, the growth of the full-line discount store (led by Walmart) was the result. The full-line 
discount store stressed low prices because of such cost-cutting techniques as having a small 
sales force, situating in lower-rent store locations, using inexpensive fixtures, emphasizing 
high stock turnover, and accepting only cash or check payments for goods. Then, as full-line 
discount stores prospered, they typically sought to move up a little along the wheel. This meant 
enlarging the sales force, improving locations, upgrading fixtures, carrying a greater selection 
of merchandise, and accepting credit. These improvements led to higher costs, which led to 
somewhat higher prices. The wheel of retailing again came into play as newer discounters, 
such as off-price chains, factory outlets, and permanent flea markets, expanded to satisfy the 
needs of the most price-conscious consumer. More recently, we have witnessed the birth of 
discount Web retailers, some of which have very low costs because they do not have “brick-
and-mortar” facilities.
As indicated in Figure 5-1, the wheel of retailing reveals three basic strategic positions: low 
end, medium, and high end. The medium strategy may have some problems if retailers in this 
position are not perceived as distinctive. In a mature format such as department stores, competitors 
at the higher-end and lower-end can steal market share from a middle-of-the-road retailer such as 
Sears. Its merchandising strategy of selling a vast array of mid-priced goods and services, and a 
failure to anticipate and react as department stores have diverged into two separate approaches 
(one at the low end and one at the high end), is threatening its survival as a retailer.2 Figure 5-2 
shows the opposing alternatives in considering a strategy mix.
The wheel of retailing suggests that established firms should be wary of adding services or 
converting a strategy from low end to high end. Because price-conscious shoppers are not usu-
ally loyal, they are apt to switch to lower-priced firms. Furthermore, retailers may then eliminate 
the competitive advantages that initially led to profitability. This occurred with the retail catalog 
showroom, a now defunct retail format.

Scrambled Merchandising
Whereas the wheel of retailing focuses on product quality, prices, and customer service, scrambled 
merchandising involves a retailer increasing its width of assortment (the number of different prod-
uct lines carried). Scrambled merchandising occurs when a retailer adds goods and services that 
may be unrelated to each other and to the firm’s original business. See Figure 5-3.
Scrambled merchandising is popular for many reasons: Retailers want to increase overall 
revenues; fast-selling, highly profitable goods and services are usually the ones added; con-
sumers make more impulse purchases; people like one-stop shopping; different target markets 
may be reached; and the impact of seasonality and competition is reduced. In addition, the 
popularity of a retailer’s original product line(s) may decline, causing it to scramble to main-
tain and grow the customer base. For example, although Starbucks’ in-store coffee sales are 
still strong, it now faces more competition in the coffee market from Dunkin’ Donuts (www 
.dunkindonuts.com), McDonald’s (www.mcdonalds.com), and other chains that have upgraded 
their offerings. Today, Starbucks (www.starbucks.com) carries many items outside its original 
coffee business, including pastries, hot breakfasts, salads, sandwiches, smoothies, and even 
wine at some locations.
Scrambled merchandising is contagious. Drugstores, bookstores, florists, kitchenware stores 
and gift shops are all affected by supermarkets’ scrambled merchandising. A significant amount 
of U.S. supermarket sales are from general merchandise, health and beauty aids, and other non-
grocery items, such as pharmacy items, magazines, flowers, and kitchen items. In response, 
drugstores and others are pushed into scrambled merchandising to fill the sales void caused by 
supermarkets. Drugstores have added toys and gift items, greeting cards, batteries, and cameras. 
This then creates a void for additional retailers, which are also forced to scramble.
How much of a practitioner 
of scrambled merchandising 
is Brookstone (www 
.brookstone.com)?
McDonald’s (www.mcdonalds.com) is expanding in Russia. It 
signed an agreement with Alexander Govor, a Siberian business-
man, to grow beyond the Ural region. McDonald’s has worked 
with other Russian partners in the past, such as awarding the 
right to open stores in transportation hubs to Razvitie ROST com-
pany. To increase sales at existing restaurants, McDonald’s now 
accepts Mir credit cards. To reduce the impact of currency swings 
and import restrictions, McDonald’s plans to obtain all poultry, 
beef, and potatoes from Russian sources as of 2018.
Describe other strategies that can be used to increase 
McDonald’s presence in Russia.

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
The prevalence of scrambled merchandising means greater competition among different types 
of retailers, and distribution costs are affected as sales are dispersed over more retailers. There are 
other limitations to scrambled merchandising, including the potential lack of retailer expertise in 
buying, selling, and servicing unfamiliar items; the costs associated with a broader assortment 
(including lower inventory turnover); and the possible harm to a retailer’s image if scrambled 
merchandising is ineffective.
The Retail Life Cycle
The retail life cycle concept states that retail institutions—like the goods and services they sell—
pass through identifiable life stages: introduction (early growth), growth (accelerated develop-
ment), maturity, and decline. The direction and speed of institutional changes can be interpreted 
from this concept.3 Take a look at Figure 5-4. The figure shows the five stages of the retail life cycle, 
with a brief description of each. Examples of each stage are shown at the bottom of the figure.
Let’s examine the retail life cycle as it applies to individual institutional formats and highlight 
specific examples. During the first stage of the cycle, introduction, there is a strong departure from 
the strategy mixes of existing retail institutions. A firm in this stage significantly alters at least 
one element of the strategy mix from that of traditional competitors. Sales and then profits often 
rise sharply for the first firms in the new category. At this stage, long-run success is not assured. 
There are risks that new institutions will not be accepted by shoppers, and there may be large 
initial losses due to heavy investments.
One retail format in the innovation stage is the online flash-sale retail Web site. Many flash-
sale Web sites specialize in selling few items in limited sizes and colors of high-end brand apparel 
at significantly lower-prices for a short time—often a few hours—to bargain-seeking customers 
who subscribe to their service.
The early category leader was Gilt Groupe (www.gilt.com), which was launched in the United 
States in 2007 and is owned by Hudson’s Bay. Others include Rue La La (www.rulelala.com), 
Ideel (www.ideel.com), Haute Look (www.hautelook.com), The RealReal (www.therealreal.com), 
and Zulily (www.zulily.com), which caters to mothers and young children and is the only publicly 
traded company in this category.4 During the economic downturn starting in 2008, store sales of 
high-end brands dropped dramatically, which resulted in manufacturers and retailers needing to

find buyers quickly to unload excess inventory of high-end products. This provided the perfect 
opportunity for flash sales to emerge and succeed in the market.
The economy and consumers’ financial situations have since improved and demand for high-
end items has increased. Some high-end brands scaled back production during the recession and 
are now more conservative about increasing production despite higher demand. Given the lower 
volume of liquidated high-end goods, and the purchasing power of off-price retailers such as  
T. J. Maxx, which can make early buys, some flash-sale sites are struggling to get inventory. 
Sparser selections and higher shipping rates compared to larger apparel retailers have led to a 
slowdown in growth.5 Flash sites are adapting by merging with larger players, diversifying into 
multiple product categories such as art, household goods (Beyond the Rack), and consignments 
(The RealReal) or to a hybrid retail model—offering curated collections (Trunk Club) or personal 
closet service (Gilt Groupe).6
In the growth stage, both sales and profits exhibit rapid growth. Existing firms expand geo-
graphically, and newer companies of the same type enter. Toward the end of accelerated develop-
ment, cost pressures (to cover a larger staff, a more complex inventory system, and extensive 
controls) may begin to affect profits.
The interactive electronic video kiosk is an institution in the growth stage. Today, kiosks sell 
everything from clothing to magazines to insurance to personal computers (PCs). Kiosks come 
in many forms: self-checkout machines; ticketing kiosks (at amusement parks, parking facilities, 
movie theaters, etc.); check-in kiosks (at hotels); food-ordering kiosks; postal kiosks (to mail 
packages and letters); and miscellaneous kiosks (such as DVD rental). According to one research 
report, U.S. retail revenues generated by kiosks exceeded $1 trillion as of 2015.7 This format is 
examined further in Chapter 6.
The third stage of the retail life cycle, maturity, is characterized by slow sales growth for the 
institutional type. Although overall sales may continue to go up, that rise is at a much lower rate 
than during prior stages. Profit margins may have to be reduced to stimulate purchases. Maturity 
is brought on by market saturation caused by the high number of firms in an institutional format, 
competition from newer institutions, changing societal interests, and inadequate management

skills to lead mature or larger firms. Once maturity is reached, the goal is to sustain it as long as 
possible and not to fall into decline.
The beer, wine, and liquor store—a specialty store—is in the maturity stage; sales are rising, 
but slowly compared to earlier times. This is due to competition from membership clubs, mail-
order wine retailers, and supermarkets (in states allowing wine or liquor sales); changing lifestyles 
and attitudes regarding alcoholic beverages; a national 21-year-old drinking age requirement; and 
limits on nonalcoholic items that these stores are permitted to sell in some locales.
The final stage in the retail life cycle is decline, whereby industrywide sales and profits for a 
format fall off, many firms abandon the format, and newer formats attract consumers previously 
committed to that retailer type. In some cases, a decline may be hard or almost impossible to 
reverse. In others, it may be avoided or postponed by repositioning the institution.
After peaking in the 1980s, the retail catalog showroom declined thereafter; it vanished in 
the United States in 1998 as the leading firms went out of business. With this format, consumers 
chose items from a catalog, shopped in a warehouse setting, and wrote up orders. Why did it fade 
away? Many other retailers cut costs and prices, so showrooms were no longer low-price lead-
ers. Catalogs had to be printed far in advance. Many items were slow-sellers or had low margins. 
Some people found showrooms crowded and disliked writing orders, a lack of displays reduced 
browsing, and the paucity of apparel goods held down revenues. Note: Great Britain’s Argos chain 
(www.argos.co.uk), part of Home Retail Group, operates 845 catalog showrooms, making it the 
largest general goods retailer in Great Britain.8
On the other hand, conventional supermarkets have slowed their decline by placing new 
units in suburban shopping centers, redesigning interiors, lengthening store hours, offering lower 
prices, expanding the use of scrambled merchandising, closing unprofitable smaller units, and 
converting to larger outlets.
The life-cycle concept highlights the proper retailer response as formats evolve. Expansion 
should be the focus initially, administrative skills and operations become critical in maturity, and 
adaptation is essential at the end of the cycle.
HOW RETAIL INSTITUTIONS ARE EVOLVING
Forward-looking firms know their individual strategies must adapt as retail institutions evolve 
over time. Complacency is not appropriate. Many retailers have witnessed shrinking profit mar-
gins due to intense competition and consumer interest in lower prices. This puts pressure on 
them to tighten internal cost controls and to promote higher-margin goods and services while 
eliminating unprofitable items. Let’s examine how firms are reacting to this formidable challenge 
through mergers, diversification, and downsizing, as well as cost containment and value-driven 
retailing.
Mergers, Diversification, and Downsizing
Some retail firms use mergers and diversification to sustain sales growth in a highly competitive 
environment (or when the institutional category in which they operate matures). For stronger 
firms, this trend is expected to carry over into the future.
Mergers involve the combination of separately owned retail firms. Some mergers take place 
between retailers of different types, such as the ones between Sears (the department store chain) 
and Kmart (the full-line discount store chain) and between upscale Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & 
Taylor (both owned by mainstream Hudson’s Bay). Other mergers occur between similar types of 
retailers, such as two banks (Bank of America acquiring Commerce Bank) and supermarket chain 
Royal Ahold merging with Delhaize Group. By merging, firms can jointly maximize resources, 
enlarge their customer base, improve productivity and bargaining power, limit weaknesses, and 
gain competitive advantages. It is a way for resourceful retailers to grow more rapidly and for 
weaker ones to enhance their long-term prospects for survival (or sell assets).
With diversification, retailers become active in businesses outside their normal operations, 
perhaps adding stores in different goods/service categories. That is why Bed Bath & Beyond now 
owns and operates Christmas Tree Shops (a bargain store chain), Harmon, and Harmon Face 
Values (discount store chains that emphasize cosmetics and health-and-beauty aids), as well as 
buybuy BABY (a store chain with 20,000-plus items targeted to parents of infants and young 
children).
With its various retail 
chains, Bed Bath & Beyond 
(http://goo.gl/93ZQFN) is a 
retailing dynamo.

Although the size of some retail chains has grown due to mergers and diversification, not all 
firms have done well with that approach. Even though stronger firms are expanding, we are also 
witnessing downsizing—whereby unprofitable stores are closed or divisions are sold off—by 
retailers unhappy with performance. Because Kmart’s diversification efforts had poor results, it 
closed or sold its ventures outside the general merchandise store field (including Borders book-
stores, Builders Square, Office Max, Payless shoe stores, and Sports Authority). It also closed 
many Kmart stores after merging with Sears.
The interest in downsizing will likely continue. Various retailers have overextended them-
selves and do not have the resources or management talent to succeed without retrenching. In their 
quest to open new stores, certain firms have chosen poor sites (having already saturated the best 
locations). Retailers such as Barnes & Noble are more interested in operating fewer, but larger, 
stores and more effectively using the Web. Supermarket retailers are finding they can do better if 
they are regional rather than national.
Cost Containment and Value-Driven Retailing
With a cost-containment approach, retailers strive to hold down both initial investments and 
operating costs. Many use this strategy due to intense competition from discounters, the need to 
control complicated chain or franchise operations, high land and construction costs, the volatility 
of the economy, and a desire to maximize productivity. The mature, highly saturated market; a 
slow-growth environment; competitive pressure to serve customers through multiple channels; 
and firms’ inability to raise prices make it imperative for retailers to drive down costs. They must 
examine every aspect of their businesses to streamline processes and costs. See Figure 5-5.
Cost containment can be accomplished by one or more of these approaches:
▶
▶Standardize operating procedures, store layouts, store size, and product offerings.
▶
▶Use secondary sites, freestanding units, and locations in older strip centers or occupy sites 
abandoned by other retailers (second-use locations).
▶
▶Place stores in smaller communities where building regulations are less strict, labor costs are 
lower, and construction and operating costs are reduced.
▶
▶Use inexpensive construction materials, such as bare cinder-block walls and concrete floors.
▶
▶Use plainer fixtures and lower-cost displays.
▶
▶Buy refurbished equipment.
▶
▶Join cooperative buying and advertising groups.
▶
▶Encourage manufacturers to finance inventories.
▶
▶Use shipping techniques that reduce inventory carrying costs.
Ocean State Job Lot has a 
cost-containment approach 
that even extends to its 
austere Web site (www 
.oceanstatejoblot.com).

Cutting Costs 
Wherever Possible
Given the thin profit 
margins for supermarkets 
and many other retailers, 
every penny of costs 
saved really matters. With 
regard to shopping carts, 
there are two associated 
costs that retailers want to 
reduce: paying employees 
to scour the parking lot 
to collect stray carts and 
the replacement costs of 
stolen and damaged carts.

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
A driving force behind cost containment is the quest to provide good value to customers. 
However, value is typically subjective. It can be based on price, quality, service, convenience, 
or a combination of them. Price usually has a big role in what shoppers purchase and the firms 
they patronize. The pricing strategies of some retailers—especially discount retailers—­encourage 
people to look for bargains and to be wary of sale prices. Smart shoppers have learned that price 
may not be a true measure of quality. They can get good quality with everyday low pricing.9

Food-Oriented Retailers
The following food-oriented strategic retail formats are described next: convenience store, con-
ventional supermarket, food-based superstore, combination store, box (limited-line) store, and 
warehouse store.
CONVENIENCE STORE  A convenience store is typically a well-located, food-oriented retailer 
that is open long hours and carries a moderate number of items. The store facility is small (only 
a fraction of the size of a conventional supermarket) and has average to above-average prices and 
average atmosphere and customer services. The ease of shopping at convenience stores and the 
impersonal nature of many large supermarkets make convenience stores particularly appealing to 
their customers, many of whom are male.
There are more than 154,000 U.S. convenience stores (excluding stores where food is a small 
fraction of revenues), and total annual sales are $215 billion (excluding gasoline).10 7-Eleven (www 
.7-eleven.com), Circle K (www.circlek.com), Casey’s General Store (www.caseys.com), and Wawa 
(www.wawa.com) are major food-based U.S. convenience store chains. Speedway (www.speedway 
.com) is a leading gasoline service-station–based convenience store chain with 2,770 outlets.11
Items such as milk, eggs, and bread once represented the major portion of convenience store 
sales; today, healthy food options such as packaged salads and fresh whole or cut fruits and veg-
etables are generating the fastest growth in sales.12 Sandwiches, tobacco products, snack foods, 
soft drinks, general merchandise, beer and wine, ATMs, and lottery tickets are also key items. 
Lately, many convenience stores are adding prepared foods. Gasoline generates 30 percent or more 
of total sales at most of the convenience stores that carry it.
This format’s advantages are its usefulness when a person does not want to travel to or shop 
at a supermarket, when fill-in items and gas are needed, when store hours are long, and when 
drive-thru windows are available. Many shoppers visit multiple times a week, and the average 
transaction is small. Due to limited space, stores get frequent deliveries and have high handling 
costs. Buyers are less price-sensitive than at other food-oriented stores.
The convenience stores industry does have problems: Some areas are saturated with stores; 
some stores have become too big, making shopping less convenient; supermarkets now offer 
longer hours and more nonfood items; a decrease in tobacco purchasing, which is a big sales 
category; and some chains have had financial woes.
CONVENTIONAL SUPERMARKET  A supermarket is a self-service food store with grocery, meat, 
and produce departments and a minimum annual sales of $2 million. Included are conventional 
supermarkets, food-based superstores, combination stores, box (limited-line) stores, and ware-
house stores. See Figure 5-6.
7-Eleven (www.7-eleven

store category.

A conventional supermarket is a departmentalized food store with a wide range of food 
and related products; sales of general merchandise are rather limited. This institution started more 
than 85 years ago when it was recognized that large-scale operations would let a retailer combine 
volume sales, self-service, and low prices. Self-service enabled supermarkets to cut costs as well 
as increase volume. Personnel costs were reduced, and impulse buying increased. The car and 
the refrigerator contributed to the supermarket’s success by lowering travel costs and adding to 
the life span of perishables.
For several decades, overall supermarket sales have been about 70 to 75 percent of U.S. 
grocery sales, with conventional supermarkets now yielding a fraction of total supermarket sales. 
There are over 26,000 conventional units, with annual sales of $420 billion.13 Chains account for 
the great majority of sales. Among the leaders are Kroger (www.kroger.com), Safeway (www 
.safeway.com), and Publix (www.publix.com), although a number of these firms’ stores are now 
food-based superstores. Many independent supermarkets are affiliated with cooperative or volun-
tary organizations such as IGA (www.iga.com) and Supervalu (www.supervalu.com).
Conventional supermarkets generally rely on high inventory turnover (volume sales). Their 
profit margins are low. In general, average gross margins (selling price less merchandise cost) are 
20 to 22 percent of sales, and net profits are 1 to 3 percent of sales.
These supermarkets face intense competition from other food stores: Convenience stores 
offer easier shopping; food-based superstores and combination stores have more product lines and 
greater variety within them, as well as better margins; and box and warehouse stores have lower 
operating costs and prices. Delivery-based food services such as Fresh Direct and AmazonFresh 
offer the convenience of online ordering and in-home scheduled delivery. Membership clubs 
(discussed later), with low prices, also provide competition—especially now that they have many 
expanded food lines. Variations of the supermarket are covered next.
FOOD-BASED SUPERSTORE  A food-based superstore is larger and more diversified than a con-
ventional supermarket but usually smaller and less diversified than a combination store. This 
format originated in the 1970s as supermarkets sought to stem sales declines by expanding store 
size and the number of nonfood items carried. Some supermarkets merged with drugstores or 
general merchandise stores, but more grew into food-based superstores. There are 12,000 food-
based U.S. superstores, with sales of $280 billion.14
A food-based superstore occupies at least 30,000 to 50,000 square feet of space, and 20 to 25 
percent of sales are from general merchandise, such as garden supplies, flowers, small appliances, 
and DVDs. It caters to complete grocery needs, along with fill-in general merchandise.

	
CHAPTER 5   •  Retail Institutions by Store-Based Strategy Mix	
141	
Like combination stores, food-based superstores are efficient, offer a degree of one-stop shop-
ping, stimulate impulse purchases, and feature high-profit general merchandise. They also have 
other advantages: It is easier and less costly to redesign and convert supermarkets into food-based 
superstores than into combination stores. Many people feel more comfortable shopping in true 
food stores than in huge combination stores. Management expertise is more focused.
Numerous U.S. supermarket chains have turned more to food-based superstores. They have 
expanded and remodeled existing supermarkets and built new stores. Many independents have 
also converted to food-based superstores.
COMBINATION STORE  A combination store unites supermarket and general merchandise in one 
facility, with general merchandise accounting for 25 to 40 percent of sales. The format began in 
the late 1960s and early 1970s, as common checkout areas were used for separately owned super-
markets and drugstores or supermarkets and general merchandise stores. The natural offshoot was 
integrating operations under one management. The thousands of U.S. combination stores (includ-
ing supercenters) have annual sales of several hundred billion dollars.15 Combination store leaders 
are Meijer (www.meijer.com), Fred Meyer (www.fredmeyer.com), and Albertson’s (www 
.albertsons.com).
Combination stores are large, from 30,000 up to 100,000 or more square feet. This means 
operating efficiencies and cost savings. Most consumers like one-stop shopping and will travel 
the extra distance to patronize them. Impulse sales are high. General merchandise often has better 
margins than food items. Supermarkets and drugstores have commonalities in customers served 
and the low-price, high-turnover items sold. Drugstore and general merchandise customers are 
drawn to the store more frequently.
A supercenter is a combination store blending an economy supermarket with a discount 
department store. It is the U.S. version of the even larger hypermarket (the European institution 
pioneered by firms such as Carrefour [www.carrefour.com] that did not succeed in the United 
States). As a rule, the majority of supercenter sales are from nonfood items. Stores usually range 
from 75,000 to 150,000 square feet in size, and they stock up to 50,000 or more items—much 
more than the 30,000 or so items carried by other combination stores. Walmart and Target both 
operate a growing number of supercenters.
BOX (LIMITED-LINE) STORE  The box (limited-line) store is a food-based discounter that focuses 
on a small selection of items, moderate hours of operation (compared with other supermarkets), 
few services, and limited manufacturer brands. This type of store carries under 2,000 items, few 
refrigerated perishables, and few sizes and brands per item. Items are displayed in cut cases, and 
prices are shown on shelves or overhead signs. Customers bag their own purchases. Box stores rely 
on low-priced, private-label brands. Their prices are 20 to 30 percent below those in supermarkets.
The box store originated in Europe and was exported to the United States in the mid-1970s. 
The growth of these stores has not been as anticipated, and sales have actually fallen modestly 
in recent years. Some other food stores have matched box-store prices. Many people are loyal to 
manufacturer brands, and box stores cannot fulfill one-stop shopping needs. There are 2,500 box 
stores in the United States, with sales of $14 billion.16 The leading box store operators are Save-
A-Lot (http://save-a-lot.com) and Aldi (www.aldi.com).
Meijer’s (www.meijer.com) 
combination stores are quite 
popular with shoppers. 
They carry 120,000 items.
If you answer YES to the following questions, you may want to

work for a broad range of retailers, attend trade shows, predict 
sale and fashion trends, forecast sales, negotiate purchase terms 
with vendors, and constantly adjust price levels to match demand 
for specific products.

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
WAREHOUSE STORE  A warehouse store is a food-based discounter that offers a moderate num-
ber of food items in a no-frills setting. It appeals to one-stop food shoppers, concentrates on 
special purchases of popular brands, uses cut-case displays, offers little service, posts prices on 
shelves, and locates in secondary sites. These stores began in the late 1970s. There are now 1,700 
U.S. stores with $70 billion in annual sales.17
The largest warehouse store is known as a superwarehouse. There are more than 600 of them 
in the United States. They have annual sales exceeding $20 million each, and they contain a variety 
of departments, including produce. High ceilings accommodate pallet loads of groceries. Ship-
ments are made directly to the store. Customers pack their own groceries in these types of stores. 
Superwarehouses are profitable at gross margins far lower than for conventional supermarkets. 
The leading super warehouse chain is Cub Foods (www.cub.com).
Many people do not like shopping in warehouse settings. Also, because products are usually 
acquired through special deals, brands may be temporarily or permanently out of stock. Table 5-2 
shows selected characteristics for the food-oriented retailers just described.
General Merchandise Retailers
We now look at the general merchandise retail formats highlighted in Table 5-1: specialty store, 
traditional department store, full-line discount store, variety store, off-price chain, factory outlet, 
membership club, and flea market.
SPECIALTY STORE  A specialty store concentrates on selling one type of goods or service line, 
such as young women’s apparel. It usually carries a narrow but deep assortment in the chosen cat-
egory and tailors the strategy to a given market segment. This enables the store to maintain a better 
selection and sales expertise than its competitors, which are often department stores. Investments 
are controlled, and there is a certain amount of flexibility. Among the most popular categories 
of specialty stores are apparel, personal care, auto supply, home furnishings, electronics, books, 
toys, home improvement, pet supplies, jewelry, and sporting goods.
Consumers often shop at specialty stores because of the knowledgeable sales personnel, the 
variety of choices within a given category, customer service, intimate store size and atmosphere

(although this is not true of the category killer store), the lack of crowds (also not true of the 
category killer store), and the absence of aisles of unrelated merchandise that they must pass 
through. Some specialty stores have elaborate fixtures and upscale merchandise for affluent shop-
pers, whereas others are discount-oriented and aim at price-conscious consumers. See Figure 5-7.
Total specialty store sales are tough to determine because these retailers sell virtually all kinds 
of goods and services, and aggregate specialty store data are not compiled by the government. Spe-
cialty store leaders include Home Depot (home improvement), Best Buy (consumer electronics), 
Staples (office supplies), Toys “R” Us (toys), GameStop (videogames), and Bed Bath & Beyond 
(household furnishings and small appliances).
One type of specialty store—the category killer—has gained particular strength. A category 
killer (also known as a power retailer) is an especially large specialty store. It features an enor-
mous selection in its category and relatively low prices. Consumers are drawn from wide geo-
graphic areas. Home Depot (www.homedepot.com), Barnes & Noble (www.barnesandnoble.com), 
Sephora (www.sephora.com), and Staples (www.staples.com) are among the chains almost fully 
based on the concept. Not only is Sephora the leading chain of perfume and cosmetics stores in 
France but it also has more than 1,900 stores in 29 countries around the world (including 360 
stores located in North America). Sephora’s stores sell a broad range of brands in such product 
categories as makeup, skin care, fragrances, bath and body lotions, lip care, and hair care. In addi-
tion, Sephora has its own private label.18
Nonetheless, smaller specialty stores (even ones with under 1,000 square feet of space) can 
prosper if they are highly focused, offer strong customer service, and avoid imitating larger firms. 
Shoppers looking to purchase products quickly may not want to spend the time and effort to search 
through multiple categories and brands at a huge category-killer store and instead may prefer to 
shop at a smaller specialty store. Some categories of merchandise, such as high-tech consumer 
electronics products, require greater support from specially trained, knowledgeable employees 
than the support typically offered at category-killer stores.
Any size specialty store can be adversely affected by seasonality or a decline in the popularity 
of its product category. This type of store may also fail to attract consumers who are interested in 
one-stop shopping for multiple product categories.
TRADITIONAL DEPARTMENT STORE  A department store is a large retail unit with an extensive 
assortment (width and depth) of goods and services that is organized into separate departments 
for purposes of buying, promotion, customer service, and control. It has the most selection of 
any general merchandise retailer, often serves as the anchor store in a shopping center or district, 
has strong credit card penetration, and is usually part of a chain. To be classified as a department 
store, a retailer must sell a wide range of products (such as apparel, furniture, appliances, and 
home furnishings), and selected other items (such as paint, hardware, toiletries, cosmetics, photo 
equipment, jewelry, toys, and sporting goods) with no one merchandise line predominating.
Two basic types of retailers meet the preceding criteria: the traditional department store and 
the full-line discount store. Together, they generate about $680 billion in U.S. revenues annu-
ally.19 The traditional department store is discussed next, followed by coverage on the full-line 
discount store.
The focus of specialty 
stores is sometimes as 
narrow as the Joy of Socks 
(www.joyofsocks.com).

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
At a traditional department store, merchandise quality ranges from average to quite good. 
Pricing is moderate to above average. Customer service ranges from medium levels of sales help, 
credit, delivery, and so forth to high levels of each. For example, Macy’s (www.macys.com) targets 
middle-class shoppers interested in assortment and moderate prices, whereas Bloomingdale’s 
(www.bloomingdales.com) aims at upscale consumers through more trendy merchandise and 
higher prices. Few traditional department stores sell all of the product lines that the category used 
to carry. Many place greater emphasis on apparel and may not carry such lines as furniture, elec-
tronics, and major appliances.
Over its history, the traditional department store has contributed many innovations, such as 
advertising prices, enacting a one-price policy (whereby all shoppers pay the same price for the 
same item), developing computerized checkouts, offering money-back guarantees, adding branch 
stores, decentralizing management, and moving into suburban shopping centers. However, in 
recent years, the performance of traditional department stores has lagged far behind that of full-
line discount stores. Today, traditional department store sales ($170 billion annually) represent 
one-quarter of total department store sales. These are some reasons for traditional department 
stores’ difficulties:
▶
▶Price-conscious consumers are more attracted to discounters and online stores than to tradi-
tional department stores.
▶
▶These stores no longer have exclusive brands for many of the items they sell.
▶
▶The growth of shopping centers has aided specialty stores because consumers can engage in 
one-stop shopping at several specialty stores in the same shopping center. Department stores 
do not dominate the smaller stores around them as they once did.
▶
▶Specialty stores often have better assortments in the lines they carry.
▶
▶Customer service has deteriorated. Often, store personnel are not as loyal, helpful, or knowl-
edgeable as in prior years.
▶
▶Some stores are too big and have a lot of unproductive space and low-turnover 
merchandise.
▶
▶Many department stores have had a weak focus on market segments and a fuzzy image.
▶
▶Such chains as Sears have repeatedly changed strategies, confusing consumers as to their 
image. (Is Sears a traditional department store chain or a full-line discount store chain?)
▶
▶Some companies are not as innovative in their merchandise decisions as they once were.
Traditional department stores need to clarify their niche in the marketplace (retail position-
ing); place greater emphasis on customer service and sales personnel; present more exciting, 
better-organized store interiors; use space better by downsizing stores and eliminating slow-selling 
items; and open outlets in smaller, less developed towns and cities (as Sears has done). They can 
also centralize more buying and promotion functions, do better research, and reach customers 
more efficiently (by such tools as targeted mailing pieces). See Figure 5-8.

FULL-LINE DISCOUNT STORE  A full-line discount store is a type of department store with these 
features:
▶
▶It conveys the image of a high-volume, low-cost outlet selling a broad product assortment for 
less than conventional prices.
▶
▶It is more apt to carry the range of general merchandise once expected only at department 
stores, including electronics, furniture, and appliances—as well as auto accessories, garden-
ing tools, and housewares.
▶
▶Shopping carts and centralized checkout service are provided.
▶
▶Customer service is not usually provided within store departments but at a centralized area. 
Products are normally sold via self-service with minimal assistance in any single department.
▶
▶Nondurable (soft) goods often feature private brands, whereas durable (hard) goods empha-
size well-known manufacturer brands.
▶
▶Less fashion-sensitive merchandise is often carried.
▶
▶Buildings, equipment, and fixtures are less expensive; and operating costs are lower than for 
traditional department stores and specialty stores.
Annual U.S. full-line discount store revenues are $510 billion (including general 
­merchandise-based supercenters and leased departments), roughly 75 percent of all U.S. depart-
ment store sales. Together, Walmart (www.walmart.com) and Target (www.target.com) operate 
7,400 full-line discount stores (including supercenters) in the United States alone.20
The success of full-line discount stores is due to many factors. They have a clear customer 
focus: middle-class and lower-middle-class shoppers looking for good value. The stores fea-
ture popular brands of average- to good-quality merchandise at competitive prices. They have 
expanded their goods and service categories and often have their own private brands. Full-line 
discount stores have worked hard to improve their image and provide more customer services. 
The average outlet (not the supercenter) tends to be smaller than a traditional department store, 
and sales per square foot are usually higher, which improves productivity. Some full-line discount 
stores are located in small towns where competition is less intense. Facilities may be newer than 
those of many traditional department stores.
The greatest challenges facing full-line discount stores are the competition from other retail-
ers (especially lower-priced store discounters, category killer stores, and Web-based retailers such 
as Amazon.com and eBay), too rapid expansion of some firms, saturation of prime locales, and 
the dominance of Walmart and Target (as Kmart has fallen dramatically from its heyday). The 
industry has undergone a number of consolidations, bankruptcies, and liquidations.
VARIETY STORE  A variety store handles an assortment of inexpensive and popularly priced 
goods and services, such as apparel and accessories, costume jewelry, notions and small wares, 
candy, toys, and other items in the price range. There are open displays and few salespeople. The 
stores do not carry full product lines, may not be departmentalized, and do not deliver products. 
Although the conventional variety store format has faded away, there are two successful spin-offs 
from it: dollar discount stores and closeout chains.
Sephora’s new flagship store in San Francisco melds consum-
ers’ physical and digital worlds in a way that shoppers haven’t 
seen until now. It’s being called a “phygital” makeover. Visitors 
may digitally interact at the Beauty Workshop, where makeup 
enthusiasts can stream YouTube how-to videos at 12 designated 
stations. It’s also possible for visitors to sit down with Sephora’s 
glam squad for a workshop-style session and try out new prod-
ucts—all while using the screens to inspire and engage. Another 
aspect of the new flagship is a digital Beauty Board, where the 
latest user-generated beauty trends and looks are shown on a 
shoppable screen. Beauty bloggers have proven to be especially 
engaged; the trend is not as prominent among fashionistas.
How quickly do you think other retailers will follow Sephora’s 
“phygital” lead? Why?

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
Dollar discount stores sell similar items to those in conventional variety stores but in plainer 
surroundings and at much lower prices. They generate $40 billion in yearly sales. Dollar General 
and Dollar Tree (which acquired Family Dollar in 2015) are the two leading dollar discount store 
chains. The two firms operate over 26,000 stores and have about $35 billion in annual sales. 
Closeout chains sell similar items to those in conventional variety stores but feature closeouts and 
overruns. They account for $8 billion in sales annually. Big Lots (www.biglots.com) is the leader 
in that category with about 1,460 stores and annual sales of $5.2 billion.21
The conventional variety store format (which included Woolworths and McCrorys) pretty 
much disappeared from the U.S. marketplace in the mid-1990s after a long, successful run. What 
happened? There was heavy competition from specialty stores and discounters, most of the stores 
were older facilities, and some items had low profit margins. At one time, Woolworths had 1,200 
variety stores with annual sales of $2 billion.
OFF-PRICE CHAIN  An off-price chain features brand-name (sometimes designer) apparel and 
accessories, footwear (primarily women’s and family), linens, fabrics, cosmetics, and/or house-
wares and sells them at everyday low prices in an efficient, limited-service environment. It fre-
quently has community dressing rooms, centralized checkout counters, no gift wrapping, and 
extra charges for alterations. The chains buy merchandise opportunistically, as special deals occur. 
Other retailers’ canceled orders, manufacturers’ irregulars and overruns, and end-of-season items 
are often purchased for a fraction of their original wholesale prices. The total sales of U.S. off-
price apparel stores are $55 billion. The biggest chains are T. J. Maxx (www.tjmaxx.com) and 
Marshalls (www.marshalls.com) (both owned by TJX), Ross Stores (www.rossstores.com), and 
Burlington Coat Factory, now advertised as Burlington (www.burlingtoncoatfactory.com).
Off-price chains aim at the same shoppers as traditional department stores do—but with 
prices reduced by 40 to 50 percent. Shoppers are also lured by the promise of new merchandise 
on a regular basis. See Figure 5-9.
The most crucial strategic element for off-price chains involves buying merchandise and 
establishing long-term relationships with suppliers. To succeed, the chains must secure large 
quantities of merchandise at reduced wholesale prices and have a regular flow of goods into the 
stores. Sometimes manufacturers use off-price chains to sell samples, products that are not doing 
well when they are introduced, and remaining merchandise near the end of a season. At other 
times, off-price chains employ a more active buying strategy. Instead of waiting for closeouts and 
canceled orders, they convince manufacturers to make merchandise during off-seasons and will 
pay cash for items early. Off-price chains are less demanding in terms of the support requested 
from suppliers; they do not return products and they pay promptly.
Off-price chains face some market pressure because of competition from other institutional 
formats that run frequent sales throughout the year, such as temporary pop-up stores and factory 
outlets. In addition, they have disadvantages associated with discontinuity of merchandise, poor 
TJX (www.tjx.com) 
operates two of the biggest 
off-price apparel chains:  
T. J. Maxx and Marshalls.

management at some firms, insufficient customer service for some shoppers, and the shakeout of 
underfinanced companies.
FACTORY OUTLET  A factory outlet is a manufacturer-owned store that sells closeouts, discontin-
ued merchandise, irregulars, canceled orders, and sometimes in-season, first-quality merchandise. 
Manufacturers’ interest in outlet stores has risen for four basic reasons:
1.	 Manufacturers can control where their discounted merchandise is sold. By placing outlets in 
out-of-the-way spots with low sales penetration of the firm’s brands, outlet revenues do not 
affect relationships with key specialty and department store accounts.
2.	 Outlets are profitable despite prices being up to 60 percent less than customary retail prices. 
Profits are due to low operating costs—few services, low rent, limited displays, and plain 
store fixtures—and selling more merchandise made especially for outlet stores.
3.	 The manufacturer decides on store visibility, sets promotion policies, removes labels, and 
ensures that discontinued items and irregulars are disposed of properly.
4.	 Because many specialty and department stores are increasing private-label sales, manufactur-
ers need revenue from outlet stores to sustain their own growth.
More factory stores now locate in clusters or outlet malls to expand customer traffic, and 
they use cooperative ads. The states with a large number of outlet centers are California, Florida, 
Texas, Pennsylvania, and New York. The largest U.S. factory outlet mall is Woodbury Common 
Premium Outlets (located in Central Valley, New York) with 904,000 gross leasable square feet.
There are more than 200 outlet malls nationwide.22 Firms with a major presence include 
Phillips-Van Heusen Corp. (Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, and Arrow); Ascena Retail Group 
(Dress Barn, Maurices, Justice, Lane Bryant, and Catherines); Gap Inc. (Gap and Banana Repub-
lic); JAG Footwear; and Carter’s, Inc. (children’s clothing). Worldwide factory outlet sales equaled 
$46 billion in 2015.
Large outlet centers are in Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, 
and other states. There are more than 15,000 U.S. factory outlet stores representing hundreds of manu-
facturers, many in outlet malls. These stores have $27 billion in U.S. yearly sales, with three-quarters 
from apparel and accessories. Firms with a mall presence include Bass (footwear); Polo Ralph Lauren 
(apparel); Levi’s (apparel); Nike (apparel and footwear); Samsonite (luggage); and Totes (rain gear).
When deciding whether to utilize factory outlets, manufacturers must be cautious. They must 
evaluate their own retailing expertise, the investment costs, the impact on existing retailers that 
buy from them, and the response of consumers. Manufacturers do not want to jeopardize their 
products’ sales at full retail prices.
MEMBERSHIP CLUB  A membership (warehouse) club straddles the line between whole-
saling and retailing. It appeals to price-conscious consumers, who must be members to shop 
there. Some members are small business owners and employees who pay a membership fee 
to buy merchandise at wholesale prices. They make purchases for use in operating their firms 
or for personal use and yield 60 percent of club sales. Most members are final consumers 
who buy for their own use; they represent 40 percent of club sales. They must pay an annual 
fee to be a member. Prices may be slightly more than for business customers. There are over 
1,500 U.S. membership clubs, with annual sales to final consumers of $75 billion. Costco www 
.costco.com) and Sam’s Club (www.samsclub.com) generate over 90 percent of industry sales.23
Category killers such as Home Depot, Sephora, and Barnes & Noble 
have bargaining power with their suppliers, particularly small ones. 
Here are some examples of misuse of bargaining power: (1) Requir-
ing preferential terms such as slotting fees, quantity discounts, 
markdown allowances, and extended payment terms. (2) Ask-
ing suppliers for special SKU designations so consumers cannot 
demand price adjustments based on price-matching guarantees. 
(3) Demanding that suppliers have private-label goods sold under 
the retailer’s name as a condition for purchasing the supplier’s other 
brands. (4) Requiring suppliers to ship goods directly to customers.
As a small retailer, how would you react to the bargaining 
power of category killers?

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
The operating strategy of today’s membership club centers on large stores (up to 100,000 or 
more square feet), inexpensive sites, opportunistic buying (with some product discontinuity), a 
fraction of the items stocked by full-line discount stores, little advertising, warehouse-style fix-
tures, wide aisles to give forklift trucks access to shelves, concrete floors, limited delivery, and 
low prices. A typical club carries general merchandise, such as consumer electronics, appliances, 
computers, housewares, tires, and apparel (35 to 60 percent of sales); food (20 to 35 percent); and 
sundries, such as health and beauty aids, tobacco, liquor, and candy (15 to 30 percent). It may 
have a pharmacy, photo developing, a car-buying service, a gas station, and other items once seen 
as frills for this format. Inventory turnover is several times that of a department store.
The major retailing challenges relate to the allocation of efforts between business and final 
consumer accounts (without antagonizing one group or the other and without presenting a blurred 
image), the lack of interest by many consumers in shopping at warehouse-type stores, the power 
of the two industry leaders, and the potential for saturation caused by overexpansion.
FLEA MARKET  At a flea market, many retail vendors sell a range of products at discount prices 
in plain surroundings. It is rooted in the centuries-old tradition of street selling—shoppers touch 
and sample items, and haggle over prices. Vendors used to sell only antiques, bric-a-brac, and 
assorted used merchandise. Today, they also frequently sell new goods, such as clothing, cosmet-
ics, watches, consumer electronics, housewares, and gift items. See Figure 5-10.
Many flea markets are in nontraditional sites such as racetracks, stadiums, and arenas. Some 
are at sites abandoned by other retailers. Typically, vendors rent space; depending on location, a 
flea market might rent individual spaces for $30 to $100 or more a day. Some flea markets impose 
a parking fee or admission charge for shoppers.
There are a few hundred major U.S. flea markets, but overall sales data are not available. The 
credibility of permanent flea markets, consumer interest in bargaining, a broader product mix, 
availability of brand-name goods, and low prices all contribute to the format’s appeal. A popular 
site is the Rose Bowl Flea Market (www.rgcshows.com/rosebowl.aspx), which is open the second 
Sunday of each month. It regularly features 2,500 vendors and attracts 20,000 shoppers a day. The 
only restricted items are “food, animals, guns, ammunition, pornography, and services requiring 
physical contact.” A vendor space costs from $60 to $250 for 1 day.
At a flea market, price haggling is common, cash is the predominant currency, and many 
vendors gain their first real experience as retail entrepreneurs. One twenty first-century trend 
involves nonstore, Web-based flea markets such as eBay (www.ebay.com), eBid (www.ebid 
.com), ­OnlineAuction (www.onlineauction.com), and Skoreit! (www.skoreit.com). Online auction 
sites account for several billion dollars in sales annually and are popular among bargain hunters.
Sam’s Club (www 
.samsclub.com) is 
Walmart’s membership club 
division. It has lower prices 
and plainer settings than 
Walmart’s full-line discount 
stores.

CHAPTER 5   •  Retail Institutions by Store-Based Strategy Mix	
149	
Many traditional retailers believe flea markets represent an unfair method of competition 
because the quality of merchandise may be misrepresented, consumers may buy items at flea 
markets and return them to other retailers for higher refunds, suppliers are often unaware their 
products are sold there, sales taxes can be easily avoided, and operating costs are quite low. Flea 
markets may also cause traffic congestion.
The high sales volume from off-price chains, factory outlets, membership clubs, and flea 
markets is explained by the wheel of retailing. These institutions are low-cost operators appeal-
ing to price-conscious consumers who are not totally satisfied with other retail formats that have 
upgraded their merchandise and customer service, raised prices, and moved along the wheel.
Chapter Summary
1.	 To describe the wheel of retailing, scrambled merchan-
dising, and the retail life cycle, and to show how they can 
help explain the performance of retail strategy mixes. 
A retail strategy mix involves a combination of factors: 
location, operations, goods/services offered, pricing, 
atmosphere and customer services, and promotion. To 
flourish, a firm should seek to be dominant in some way 
and reach destination retailer status.
Three important concepts help explain the perfor-
mance of diverse retail strategies. According to the 
wheel of retailing, retail innovators often first appear 
as low-price operators with low costs and low profit 
margins. Over time, they upgrade their offerings and 
customer services and raise prices. They are then vulner-
able to new discounters with lower costs that take their 
place along the wheel. With scrambled merchandising, 
a retailer adds goods and services that are unrelated to 
each other and its original business to increase overall 
sales and profits. Scrambled merchandising is conta-
gious and often used in self-defense. The retail life cycle 
states that institutions pass through identifiable stages of 
introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. Strategies 
change as institutions mature.
2.	 To discuss ways in which retail strategy mixes are 
evolving. Many institutions are adapting to market-
place dynamics. These approaches have been popular 
for various firms, depending on their strengths, weak-
nesses, and goals: mergers, by which separately owned 
retailers join together; diversification, by which a retailer 
becomes active in businesses outside its normal opera-
tions; and downsizing, whereby unprofitable stores are 
closed or divisions sold. Sometimes, single companies 
use all three approaches. More firms also utilize cost 
containment and value-driven retailing. They strive to 
hold down both investment and operating costs. There 
are many ways to do this.
3.	 To examine a wide variety of food-oriented retail-
ers involved with store-based strategy mixes. Retail 
institutions may be classified by store-based strategy 
mix and divided into food-oriented and general mer-
chandise. Fourteen store-based strategies are covered in 
this chapter.
Food-oriented store-based retailers include the fol-
lowing: A convenience store is well located, is open long 
hours, and offers a moderate number of fill-in items at 
average to above-average prices. A conventional super-
market is departmentalized and carries a wide range of 
food and related items, there is little general merchan-
dise, and prices are competitive. A food-based superstore 
is larger and more diversified than a conventional super-
market but smaller and less diversified than a combina-
tion store. A combination store unites supermarket and 
general merchandise in a large facility and sets competi-
tive prices; the food-based supercenter (hypermarket) is 
a type of combination store. A box (limited-line) store 
is a discounter focusing on a small selection, moderate 
hours, few services, and few name brands. A warehouse 
store is a discounter with a moderate number of food 
items in a no-frills setting that can be large.
4.	 To study a wide range of general merchandise retail-
ers involved with store-based strategy mixes. A specialty 
store concentrates on one goods or service line and has a 
tailored strategy; the category killer is a special kind of 
specialty store. A department store is a large retailer with 
an extensive assortment of goods and services. The tradi-
tional department store has a range of customer services 
and average to above-average prices. A full-line discount 
store is a department store with a low-cost, low-price 
strategy. A variety store has inexpensive and popularly 
priced items in a plain setting. An off-price chain fea-
tures brand-name items and sells them at low prices in 
an austere environment. A factory outlet is manufacturer-
owned and sells closeouts, discontinued merchandise, 
and irregulars at very low prices. A membership club 
appeals to price-conscious shoppers who must be mem-
bers to shop. A flea market has many vendors offering 
items at discount prices in nontraditional venues.

and Other Forms of 
Nontraditional Retailing

Objectives
1. To contrast single-
channel, multichannel, 
and omnichannel 
retailing
2. To look at the 
characteristics of the 
three major retail 
institutions involved 
with nonstore-based

direct marketing
3. To explore the 
emergence of electronic 
retailing through the 
Web
4. To discuss two other 
nontraditional forms of 
retailing: video kiosks 
and airport retailing
As both multichannel and Web-only retailers look to ramp up their online revenues, many of 
them may be missing out on a huge opportunity. Why? A big challenge is for these retailers 
to effectively coordinate their E-commerce efforts with their social-media activities. Too often, 
the two formats are not integrated well—and sometimes not interrelated at all.
Omnichannel retailers have integrated operations across all of their multiple channels and 
seek to maximize a firm’s total performance across these channels. One popular logistics 
strategy in omnichannel marketing is for shoppers to buy online and pick up the item(s) at 
the store. This enables them to receive products immediately without incurring shipping 
charges. What are the advantages for the retailer? Consumers buying online and picking 
up the merchandise allows the retailer to sell related items (batteries, cables, extended 
warranties, etc.) as well as trade up customers to more related, higher-margin goods when 
they arrive at the store.
Kohl’s is among a number of retailers that has a buy online, pick up in-store program. “We 
see it as an advantage. [Convenience is] part of our core DNA, so having someone be able to 
place an order and then just drive in and pick it up—we’ve seen very positive reactions from 
our customers,” says Krista Berry, executive vice-president and chief digital officer for Kohl’s.

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
Kohl’s buy online, pick up in-store program was initially limited to desktop and laptop 
computer users. However, after the service went mobile, it reached the more than 
7 million shoppers who had already downloaded the Kohl’s app. Kohl’s can use the app’s 
wallet function to deliver personalized messages and offers that can be scanned and 
redeemed in stores.
According to consultant Paul McFarren, “The size of the retail operation is an important 
factor” in implementing the buy online, pick up in-store feature. “Retailers need a 
sophisticated inventory management program that is able to accurately depict the number of 
units in stock at each store location. Retailers also need adequate personnel to set aside online 
purchases at the store level”.1
Overview
In this chapter, we contrast single-channel, multichannel, and omnichannel retailing. We also look 
at nonstore-based retailing, electronic retailing, and two other types of nontraditional retailing: 
video kiosks and airport retailing. These formats affect current and new store retailers. Visit our 
blog (www.bermanevansretail.com) for posts on these topics.
When it begins, a retailer often relies on single-channel retailing, whereby it sells to con-
sumers through one retail format. That one format may be store-based (a corner shoe store) or 
nonstore-based (catalog retailing, direct selling, or Web retailing). As the firm grows, it may turn 
to multichannel retailing, whereby a retailer sells to consumers through multiple retail formats.
To optimize efficiency and enhance customer experiences, the best retailers turn to omnichan-
nel retailing, and deliver a consistent, uninterrupted, and seamless experience regardless of chan-
nel or device. As noted in Chapter 1, omnichannel retailing assumes that various shoppers’ journeys 
use mobile, Web, and stores differently. Product discovery can be Web– or social-media–based, 
information search can use the Web or in-store observation, and consumers can buy via a mobile 
device and return the product to a store. For example, according to recent research, Web users are 
most apt to discover small businesses online than via any other mode, including word-of-mouth.2
The differences between multichannel and omnichannel retailing must be understood. 
Although both types of retailers sell through multiple channels, there is seldom integration or 
coordination among the separate channels or devices at a multichannel retailer. In addition to 
competing against other retailers, such a company may find its channels are competing against 
each other. Prices, SKU designations, and customer return policies may differ across channels at a 
multichannel retailer. A multichannel retailer also seeks to maximize the performance of each sep-
arate channel. For that firm, a store manager and a Web executive may compete against each other. 
Sometimes, multichannel retailers do not allow consumers to buy goods online and return them to 
a local store. They are also less likely to have integrated databases that can determine a customer’s 
purchases across channels.
Omnichannel retailing, on the other hand, focuses on consumers’ use of multiple devices 
and channels throughout the consumer’s retail journey to a single purchase. A multichannel 
approach may reward customers for purchases through each separate channel, but an omnichan-
nel approach rewards customers for purchases made through all channels. An example of an 
omnichannel strategy is a retailer’s Web site or mobile app containing information on in-store 
product availability, the aisle location of specific goods, the ability to reserve the goods online 
for in-store pickup, and text notifications with promotional codes to be redeemed in local stores. 
Omnichannel retailers also encourage in-store shoppers access to “endless aisles” that use kiosks 
to place online orders for store pickup or to be shipped home. See Table 6-1.
Retail leader Walmart sells at stores (including Walmart, Sam’s Club, and Neighborhood 
Market), multiple Web sites (including www.walmart.com), and a Web-to-store format whereby 
customers purchase online and pick up products at the nearest store. Figure 6-1 shows examples 
of single-channel, multichannel, and omnichannel retailing. An end-of-chapter appendix explores 
omnichannel retailing in more detail.
Why have we introduced this concept here? Because even though some nonstore-based firms 
are “pure players” (single-channel retailers), a rapidly growing number of firms have combined 
store and nonstore retailing to actively pursue multichannel retailing—and then, ominchannel 
From its roots as a full-
line discount store chain, 
Walmart (www.walmart 
.com) has become a master 
of omnichannel retailing.

retailing. As new digital channels emerge and customer preferences for various channels evolve, 
more retailers are exploring new ways to reach the right customer with the right message through 
the right channel at the right time. The best retailers know that the secret to omnichannel retailing 
success is to invest in new channels, develop a channel integration roadmap, more intensely use 
customer analytics, enhance Web sites, and develop better marketing communications.3
Retailers—single-channel, multichannel, and omnichannel—engage in nonstore retailing 
when they use strategies that are not store-based to reach consumers and complete transactions. 
Nonstore retailing sales in the United States exceed $530 billion. The fastest-growing form of 
direct marketing involves electronic (including mobile) retailing. U.S. Web retailing sales were 
$319 billion in 2015. Web-influenced offline sales were $1.55 trillion in that same year.4 See 
Figure 6-2.
Nontraditional retailing also comprises video kiosks and airport retailing—two key formats 
not fitting neatly into “store-based” or “nonstore-based” retailing. Sometimes they are store-based; 
other times they are not. What they have in common is their departure from traditional retailing 
strategies.

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
DIRECT MARKETING
In direct marketing, a customer is first exposed to a good or service through a nonpersonal 
medium (direct mail, TV, radio, magazine, newspaper, computer, tablet, or mobile device) and 
then orders by mail, phone, or fax (and increasingly by computer, smartphone, or tablet. Annual 
U.S. sales are more than $475 billion (including the Web), and more than half of American adults 
make at least one such purchase a year. Japan, Germany, Great Britain, France, and Italy are 
among the direct-marketing leaders outside the United States. Popular products are gift items, 
apparel, magazines, books and music, sports equipment, home accessories, food, and insurance.
In the United States, direct-marketing customers are more apt to be middle class. Mail shop-
pers are more likely to live in areas away from malls. And, because they want to avoid traffic and 
save time, phone shoppers are more likely to live in upscale metropolitan areas. The share of 
direct-marketing purchases made by men has grown: The average consumer who buys direct 
spends several hundred dollars per year, and he or she wants convenience, unique products, and 
good prices.
Direct marketers can be divided into two categories: general and specialty. General direct-
marketing firms, such as Neiman Marcus (with its mail-order and Web businesses) and QVC (with 
its cable TV and Web businesses), offer a full line of products and sell everything from clothing to 
housewares. Specialty direct marketers focus on more narrow product lines. L.L. Bean, Publishers 
Clearinghouse, and Franklin Mint are among the thousands of U.S. specialty firms. See Figure 6-3.

CHAPTER 6   •  Web, Nonstore-Based, and Other Forms of Nontraditional Retailing

Direct marketing has a number of strategic business advantages:
▶
▶Many costs are reduced—even low startup costs are possible; inventories are reduced; no dis-
plays are needed; a prime location is unnecessary; regularly staffed store hours are not impor-
tant; a sales force may not be needed; and business may be run out of a garage or basement.
▶
▶It is possible for direct marketers to have lower prices (due to reduced costs) than store-based 
retailers. A huge geographic area can be covered inexpensively and efficiently.
▶
▶Customers shop conveniently—without crowds, parking congestion, or checkout lines. And 
they do not have safety concerns about shopping early in the morning or late at night.
▶
▶Specific consumer segments are pinpointed through targeted mailings.
▶
▶Consumers may sometimes legally avoid sales tax by buying from direct marketers not having 
retail facilities in their state (however, some states want to eliminate this loophole).
▶
▶A store-based firm can supplement its regular business and expand its trading area (even 
becoming national or global) without adding outlets.
Direct marketing also has its limits, but they are not as critical as those for direct selling:
▶
▶Products cannot be examined before purchase. Thus, the range of items purchased is more 
limited than in stores, and firms need liberal return policies to attract and keep customers.
▶
▶Firms may underestimate costs. Catalogs can be costly. Computer systems must track ship-
ments, purchases, and returns, and keep lists current. A 24-hour phone staff may be needed.
▶
▶Even successful catalogs often draw purchases from less than 10 percent of recipients.
▶
▶Clutter exists. Each year, billions of E-mails and catalogs are mailed in the United States 
alone.
▶
▶Printed catalogs are prepared well in advance, causing difficulties in price and style planning.
▶
▶Some firms have given the industry a bad name due to delivery delays and shoddy goods.
The Federal Trade Commission’s “30-day rule” is a U.S. regulation that affects direct market-
ers. It requires firms to ship orders within 30 days of their receipt or notify customers of delays. 
If an order cannot be shipped in 60 days, the customer must be given a specific delivery date and 
offered the option of canceling an order or waiting for it to be filled. The rule covers mail, phone, 
fax, and computer orders.
Despite its limitations, long-run growth for direct marketing is projected. Consumer interest 
in convenience and the difficulty in setting aside shopping time will continue. More direct mar-
keters will offer 24-hour ordering and improve their efficiency. Greater product standardization 
and the prominence of well-known brands will reduce consumer perceptions of risk when buying 
from a catalog or the Web. Technological breakthroughs, such as purchases on smartphones, will 
attract more and more consumer shopping.
Due to its vast presence and immense potential, our detailed discussion is intended to give 
you an in-depth look into direct marketing. Let’s study the domain of direct marketing, data-
base retailing, emerging trends, steps in a direct marketing strategy, and key issues facing direct 
marketers.

If you go to a retailer’s Web site and it offers one-click payment, 
shows inventory availability at a local store, remembers your 
home address, and contains product reviews from users, then 
thank the retailer’s Web site team. Web experts create an overall 
Web design, write code, incorporate sound and videos, check 
download times, plan for search engine optimization, and ensure 
that site features operate on different devices (smartphones, 
tablets, and laptops) and with different operating systems. Each 
device and operating system needs a similar appearance because 
many people channel hop from laptop, tablet, and smartphones 
in their purchase journey.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that, from 2016 to 
2024, the demand for Web developers will grow by 27 percent. 
During this period, 39,500 new jobs will be created. The median 
salary for Web developers is over $63,000.

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
The Domain of Direct Marketing
As defined earlier, direct marketing is a form of retailing in which a consumer is exposed to a 
good or service through a nonpersonal medium and then orders by mail, phone, fax, computer, 
or mobile media. It may also be viewed as a “data-driven, cross media, interactive, multichannel 
process for building and cultivating mutually beneficial relationships between companies and 
their customers and prospects.”5
Accordingly, we do include these following forms of direct marketing: any catalog; any mail, 
TV, radio, magazine, newspaper, phone directory, fax, or other ad; any computer-based or mobile 
app transaction; or any other nonpersonal contact that stimulates customers to place orders by 
mail, phone, fax, or computer (including interactive TV and mobile).
We do not include these as forms of direct marketing: (1) Direct selling—consumers are 
solicited by in-person sales efforts or seller-originated phone calls and the firm uses personal 
communication to initiate contact. (2) Conventional vending machines, whereby consumers are 
exposed to nonpersonal media but do not complete transactions via mail, phone, fax, or computer; 
they do not interact with the firm in a manner that allows a database to be generated and kept.
Direct marketing is involved in many computerized kiosk transactions; when items are 
shipped to consumers, there is a company–customer interaction and a database can be formed. 
Direct marketing is also in play when consumers originate phone calls, based on catalogs or ads 
they have seen.
The Customer Database: Key to Successful Direct Marketing
Because direct marketers often initiate contact with customers (in contrast to store shopping trips 
that are initiated by the consumer), it is imperative that they develop and maintain a comprehensive 
customer database. They can then pinpoint their best customers, make offers aimed at specific 
customer needs, avoid costly mailings to nonresponsive shoppers, and track sales by customer. 
A good database is the major asset of most direct marketers, and every thriving direct marketer 
has a strong database.
Database retailing is a way to collect, store, and use relevant information about customers. 
Such information typically includes a person’s name, address, background data, shopping inter-
ests, and purchase behavior. Although databases are often compiled through large computerized 
information systems, they may also be used by small firms that are not overly computerized.
Reports on database retailing show that collecting individual-level customer data (ILCD) 
about online and store-based shopping behavior helps retailers more efficiently select and contact 
customers. Gathering ILCD also assists retailers in personalizing content and offers, enhancing 
customer experience, and improving purchase conversion of individual consumers or business 
buyers via individually interactive media (IIM) and other touchpoints. When a company can link 
customer purchases to the offers that spurred them, the data provide valuable clues for personal-
izing the goods, services, and promotional offers that should be offered next to those particular 
customers and prospects. Knowing more about target audiences’ particular attitudes, propensities, 
and household composition provides clues about the channels, messages, and timing for the next 
offer.6 Database retailing is discussed further in Chapter 8.
Emerging Trends
Several trends are relevant for direct marketing: the evolving activities of direct marketers, chang-
ing consumer lifestyles, increased competition, the greater use of omnichannel retailing, the newer 
roles for catalogs and TV, technological advances, and the interest in global direct marketing. 
Online retailing is discussed in depth later in this chapter.
EVOLVING ACTIVITIES OF DIRECT MARKETERS  Over the past several decades, these direct market-
ing activities have evolved:
▶
▶Web and mobile technology has moved to the forefront in all aspects of direct marketing—
from lead generation to order processing.
▶
▶Multiple points of customer contact are offered by most firms today.
▶
▶There is an increased focus on database retailing.
▶
▶The emergence of database–driven direct marketing services is helping newer and smaller 
firms enter and diversify into new markets at a lower cost than in the past years.7
▶
▶Firms now have well-articulated and widely communicated privacy policies.

	
CHAPTER 6   •  Web, Nonstore-Based, and Other Forms of Nontraditional Retailing	
157	
CHANGING CONSUMER LIFESTYLES  Consumer lifestyles in the United States have shifted, mostly 
due to the numerous women who are now in the labor force and the longer commuting time to 
and from work for suburban residents. Many consumers no longer have the time or inclination 
to shop at stores. They are attracted by the ease of purchasing through direct marketing. Some of 
the factors consumers consider in selecting a direct marketer are:
▶
▶Company reputation (image)
▶
▶Ability to shop whenever the consumer wants
▶
▶Types of goods and services as well as the assortment and brand names carried
▶
▶Availability of a toll-free phone number or Web site for ordering
▶
▶Credit card acceptance
▶
▶Speed of promised delivery time
▶
▶Competitive prices
▶
▶Satisfaction with past purchases and good return policies
▶
▶Customer reviews and comments at retail sites and through social media
INCREASED COMPETITION AMONG FIRMS  As direct marketing sales have risen, so has competi-
tion; although there are a number of big firms, such as Guthy/Renker (www.guthy-renker.com), 
which has marketed such products as Proactiv acne solution, there are also thousands of small 
ones. According to the Direct Marketing Association, there are thousands of U.S. mail-order (and 
E-mail–based) companies alone.
Intense competition exists because entry into direct marketing is easier and less costly than 
entry into store retailing. A firm does not need a store; can operate with a small staff; can use 
low-cost 1-inch magazine ads, send brochures to targeted shoppers, and have an inexpensive Web 
site. It can also keep a low inventory and place orders with suppliers after people buy items (so 
long as it meets the “30-day rule”).
About one of every two new direct marketers fail. Direct marketing lures small firms that may 
poorly define their market niche, offer nondistinctive products, have limited experience, misjudge 
the needed effort, have trouble with supplier continuity, and get consumer complaints.
GREATER USE OF MULTICHANNEL AND OMNICHANNEL RETAILING  Today, many stores add to 
their revenues by using ads, brochures, catalogs, and Web sites to obtain mail-order, phone, and 
computer-generated sales. They see that direct marketing is efficient, targets specific segments, 
appeals to people who might not otherwise shop with those firms, and needs a lower investment 
to reach other geographic areas than opening branch outlets.
Neiman Marcus Group is a good example of a luxury store-based retailer that has flourished 
with its distinctive omnichannel approach. It uses its strong print catalog experience to drive 
omnichannel efforts. Its catalogs, such as “The Book” for Neiman Marcus and “BG Magazine” 
for Bergdorf Goodman, play an important role in bringing the firm to life in a very tactile way to 
customers. Neiman Marcus started selling online through its Web site in 1999; today it accounts 
for 24 percent of total business. The company still asserts that there is a niche in the market for 
catalog services, and that catalogs play a role in moving customers across the demographic spec-
trum through the purchase cycle. Neiman Marcus has successfully leveraged data and insights 
gained from its catalogs, its vendor relationships, and its fulfillment infrastructure in its E-com-
merce efforts.8
NEWER ROLES FOR CATALOGS AND TV  Direct marketers are recasting how they use their catalogs 
and their approach to TV retailing. We are witnessing three key changes in long-standing catalog 
tactics: (1) Many firms now print “specialogs” in addition to or instead of the annual catalogs 
showing all their products. With a specialog, a retailer caters to a particular customer segment, 
emphasizes a limited number of items, and reduces production and postage costs (a specialog is 
much shorter than a general catalog). Each year, such firms as L.L. Bean and Travelsmith send 
out separate specialogs by market segment or occasion. (2) To help defray costs, some companies 
accept ads from noncompeting firms that are compatible with their image. (3) To stimulate sales 
and defray costs, some catalogs are sold in bookstores, supermarkets, and airports, as well as at 
company Web sites. The percentage of consumers buying a catalog who actually make a purchase 
is far higher than that for those who get catalogs in the mail.
Television retailing has two major components (not including interactive TV shopping, which 
is now emerging): shopping networks and infomercials. On a shopping network, programming 
Spiegel (www.spiegel 
.com) has largely been a 
direct marketer since the 
early 1900s. It faces more 
competition now than ever 
before.

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
focuses on merchandise presentations and sales (often by phone). The two biggest players are 
cable giants QVC and Home Shopping Network (HSN), with combined annual worldwide rev-
enues of $12.4 billion. QVC has access to a global TV audience of 350 million households, HSN 
to 94 million. They feature jewelry, women’s clothing, and personal-care items and do not focus 
on leading brands. Most items must be bought when they are shown to encourage shoppers to 
act quickly. Both firms have active Web sites (www.qvc.com and www.hsn.com) and mobile 
apps. Nearly half of their U.S. sales revenues (40 percent HSN and 49 percent QVC in 2015) are 
E-commerce orders, with mobile accounting for half of QVC’s E-commerce revenues.9
An infomercial is a program-length TV commercial (typically, 30 minutes) for a specific 
good or service that airs on cable or broadcast television, often at a fringe time. As they watch an 
infomercial, shoppers call in orders, which are delivered to them. Infomercials work well for 
products that benefit from demonstrations. Good infomercials present detailed information, 
include customer testimonials, are entertaining, and are divided into timed segments (since the 
average viewer watches only a few minutes at a time) with ordering information displayed in every 
segment. Infomercials account for several billion dollars in annual U.S. revenues. Popular info-
mercials include those for the Total Gym, Life Lock, Proactiv Acne Treatment, Shark Rocket, and 
Copper Chef. The Electronic Retailing Association (www.retailing.org) is the trade association 
for infomercial firms.
TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES  The technology revolution has improved operating efficiency as 
well as enhanced sales opportunities:
▶
▶Market segments are better targeted. Through selective binding, bigger catalogs are sent to 
the best customers and shorter catalogs to new prospects.
▶
▶Advances in computerized database technology has made it both easier and less costly to 
selectively reach individual customers.
▶
▶Firms inexpensively use computers to enter mail and phone orders, arrange for shipments, 
and monitor inventory on hand.
▶
▶Huge, automated distribution centers efficiently accumulate and ship orders.
▶
▶Customers dial toll-free phone numbers or visit Web sites to place orders and get information. 
The cost per call for the direct marketer is quite low.
▶
▶Consumers can conclude transactions from more sites, including kiosks at airports and train 
stations.
▶
▶Cable and satellite programming and the Web offer 24-hour shopping and ordering.
▶
▶In-home, at-work, and leisure-time Web-based shopping transactions can be conducted.
MOUNTING INTEREST IN GLOBAL DIRECT MARKETING  More retailers are engaged with global 
direct marketing because of the growing consumer acceptance of nonstore retailing in other coun-
tries. Among the U.S.-based direct marketers with a significant international presence are Brook-
stone, Eddie Bauer, Lands’ End, and Williams-Sonoma.
Outside the United States, annual direct-marketing sales (by both domestic and foreign firms) 
amount to hundreds of billions of dollars. Direct-marketing trade associations—each represent-
ing many member firms—exist in such diverse countries as Australia, Brazil, China, France, 
Germany, Japan, Russia, and Spain. In Europe alone, there are well over 10,000 direct-marketing 
companies; and the emerging Indian direct-marketing arena features numerous firms, domestic 
and international.10
George Foreman became a 
very rich man through  
his infomercials  
for grills (www 
.georgeforemancooking 
.com).
Lands’ End has Web sites 
to service customers around 
the world, such as its 
French site  
(www.fr.landsend.com). 
Because of Lands’ End’s 
customer commitment, this 
site is in French.
A recurring issue underlying all Web-based transactions con-
cerns the legal responsibility of online sellers to collect sales tax. 
The general guideline is that online retailers are not required 
to collect sales tax in states where they have no physical pres-
ence. A number of states have recently enacted laws that require 
large online retailers to collect sales tax from all purchasers in  
those states. Under the current sales tax collection process, 
Web-based retailers with no presence in a state have a signifi-
cant price advantage equal to the sales tax. This is especially the 
case in those states where the sales tax states equals or exceeds 
7 percent.
As a store-based retailer, how you deal with this issue?

The Steps in a Direct-Marketing Strategy
A direct marketing strategy has eight steps: business definition, generating customers, media 
selection, presenting the message, customer contact, customer response, order fulfillment, and 
measuring results, and maintaining the database. See Figure 6-4.
BUSINESS DEFINITION  First, a company makes two decisions as to its business definition: (1) Is 
the firm going to be a pure direct marketer or is it going to engage in multichannel or omnichan-
nel retailing? If the firm chooses one of the latter two strategies, it must clarify the role of direct 
marketing in its overall retail strategy. (2) Is the firm going to be a general direct marketer and 
carry a broad product assortment or will it specialize in one product category?
GENERATING CUSTOMERS  A mechanism for generating business is devised next. A firm can:
▶
▶Buy a printed mailing list or an E-mail list from a broker. For one mailing, a list usually costs 
up to $50 to $100 or more per 1,000 names and addresses; if printed, it is supplied in mailing-
label format. Lists may be broad or broken down by gender, location, and so on. In purchasing 
a list, the direct marketer should check its currency.
▶
▶Download a mailing list from the Web that is sold by a firm such as infoUSA (www.infousa 
.com), which has data on the home addresses of 100 million U.S. households. With a down-
load, a retailer can use the list multiple times, but it is responsible for selecting names and 
printing labels.
▶
▶Send out a blind mailing to all the residents in a particular area. This method can be expensive 
(unless done through E-mail) and may receive a very low response rate.
▶
▶Advertise in a newspaper, magazine, Web site, or other medium, and ask customers to order 
by mail, phone, fax, or computer.
▶
▶Contact consumers who have bought from the firm or requested information. This is effi-
cient, but it takes a while to develop a database. To grow, a firm cannot rely solely on past 
customers.
MEDIA SELECTION  Several media are available to the direct marketer:
▶
▶Printed and/or online catalogs
▶
▶Direct mail ads and brochures
▶
▶Inserts with monthly credit card and other bills (“statement stuffers”)
▶
▶Freestanding displays with coupons, brochures, or catalogs (such as magazine subscription 
cards at the supermarket checkout counter)
▶
▶Ads or programs in the mass media—newspapers, magazines, radio, TV
▶
▶Banner ads or hotlinks on the Web
▶
▶Video kiosks
In choosing among media, the costs, distribution, lead time, and other factors should be 
considered.
PRESENTING THE MESSAGE  The next step in a direct-marketing strategy is the firm prepares 
and presents its message in a way that engenders interest, creates (or sustains) the proper image,

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
points out compelling reasons to purchase, and provides data about goods or services (such as 
prices and sizes). The message must also contain ordering instructions, including the payment 
method; how to designate the chosen items; shipping fees; and a firm’s address, phone number, 
and Web address.
The message, and the media in which it is presented, should be planned in the same way 
that a traditional retailer plans a store. The latter uses a storefront, lighting, carpeting, the store 
layout, and displays to foster an image. In direct marketing, the headlines, message content, use 
of color, paper quality, personalization of mail, space devoted to each item, return policy, product 
guarantees, and other elements affect a firm’s image.
CUSTOMER CONTACT  For each campaign, a direct marketer decides whether to contact all cus-
tomers in its database or to seek specific market segments (with different messages and/or media 
for each). It can classify prospective customers as regulars (those who buy continuously); non-
regulars (those who buy infrequently); new contacts (those who have never been sought before 
by the firm); and nonrespondents (those who have been contacted but never made a purchase).
Regulars and nonregulars are the most apt to respond to a firm’s future offerings, and they can 
be better targeted because the firm has their purchase histories. For example, customers who have 
bought clothing before are prime prospects for specialogs. New contacts probably know less about 
the firm. Messages to them must build interest, accurately portray the firm, and present meaningful 
reasons for consumers to buy. This group is important if growth is sought.
Nonrespondents who have been contacted repeatedly without purchasing are unlikely to ever 
buy. Unless a firm can present a very different message, it is inefficient to pursue this group. Firms 
such as Publishers Clearinghouse send mailings to millions of people who have never bought from 
them; this is okay because they sell inexpensive impulse items and need only a small response 
rate to succeed.
CUSTOMER RESPONSE  Customers respond to direct marketers in one of three ways: (1) They buy 
through the mail, phone, fax, computer, or smartphone. (2) They request further information, such 
as a catalog. (3) They ignore the message. Purchases are generally made by no more than 2 to 3 
percent of those contacted. The rate is higher for specialogs, mail-order clubs (e.g., for books), 
and firms focusing on repeat customers.
ORDER FULFILLMENT  A system is needed for order fulfillment. If orders are received by mail or 
fax, the firm must sort them, determine if payment is enclosed, see whether the item is in stock, 
mail announcements if items cannot be sent on time, coordinate shipments, and replenish inven-
tory. If phone orders are placed, a trained sales staff must be available when people may call. 
Salespeople answer questions, make suggestions, enter orders, note the payment method, see 
whether items are in stock, coordinate shipments, and replenish inventory. If orders are placed 
by computer or smartphone, there must be a process to promptly and efficiently handle credit 
transactions, issue receipts, and forward orders to a warehouse. In all cases, names, addresses, 
and purchase data are added to the database for future reference.
Order fulfillment can also be conducted through “drop shipping,” wherein manufacturers and 
wholesalers handle packaging, shipping, and inventory storage functions. Drop shipping occurs 
when retailers have a lot of channel power relative to suppliers or when niche goods with low 
demand are sought by consumers. Although consumers may not know that items are drop shipped 
(because the invoice is from the retailer), they still expect the same level of prompt and accurate 
service as other goods shipped directly by the retailer.
In peak seasons, additional warehouse, shipping, order processing, and sales workers sup-
plement regular employees. Direct marketers that are highly regarded by consumers fill orders 
promptly, have knowledgeable and courteous personnel, do not misrepresent quality, and provide 
liberal return policies.
MEASURING RESULTS AND MAINTAINING THE DATABASE  The last step in a direct-marketing 
strategy is analyzing results and maintaining the database. Direct marketing often yields clear 
outcomes:
▶
▶Overall response rate: The number and percentage of people who make a purchase after 
receiving or viewing a particular brochure, catalog, or Web site
▶
▶Average purchase amount:By customer location, gender, and so forth

	
CHAPTER 6   •  Web, Nonstore-Based, and Other Forms of Nontraditional Retailing	
161	
▶
▶Sales volume by product category: Revenues correlated with the space allotted to each prod-
uct in brochures, catalogs, and so forth
▶
▶Value of list brokers: The revenues generated by various mailing lists
After measuring results, the firm reviews its database and makes sure that new shoppers are 
added, address changes are noted for existing customers, purchase and consumer information is 
current and available in segmentation categories, and nonrespondents are purged (when desirable). 
This stage provides feedback for the direct marketer as it plans each new campaign.
Key Issues Facing Direct Marketers
In planning and applying their strategies, direct marketers must keep certain issues in mind. Many 
consumer perceptions of aspects of direct marketing are negative. Nonetheless, in most cases, 
leading direct marketers are rated well by consumers. Factors leading to dissatisfaction include:
▶
▶Delivery problems. Customer dissatisfaction includes late delivery or nondelivery, deceptive 
claims, broken or damaged items, receiving the wrong items, and the lack of information.
▶
▶Clutter or “junk” mail. Most U.S. households report that they do open direct mail, but they 
would like to receive less of it. Firms are concerned about clutter and difficulty in being 
distinctive.
▶
▶Privacy concerns. Many consumers are concerned that their names and other information are 
being sold by list brokers and retailers. They feel this is an invasion of privacy and that their 
decision to purchase does not constitute permission for the retailer to make secondary use of 
their personal data. To counteract this, members of the Direct Marketing Association remove 
people’s names from list circulation if they make a request.11
Multichannel and omnichannel retailers need a consistent image for both store-based and 
direct-marketing efforts. They must also recognize the similarities and differences in each 
approach’s strategy. Postal rates and paper costs makes mailing catalogs, brochures, and other 
promotional materials costly for some firms. Numerous direct marketers are turning more to 
newspapers, magazines, cable TV, and the Web.
Direct marketers must monitor the legal environment. They must be aware that, in the future, 
more states will probably require residents to pay sales tax on out-of-state direct-marketing pur-
chases; the firms will have to remit the tax payments to affected states. New laws will be contested 
by some retailers.
DIRECT SELLING
Direct selling includes both personal contact with consumers in their homes (and other non-
store locations such as offices) and phone solicitations initiated by a retailer. See Figure 6-5. 
Cosmetics, jewelry, vitamins, household goods and services (such as carpet cleaning), ­vacuum 
cleaners, and magazines and newspapers are among the items sometimes sold in this way. 
The industry has $35 billion in annual U.S. sales and employs more than 18.2 million people 
(more than 90 percent of whom work part time). Annual foreign direct-selling revenues are an 
additional $185 billion, generated by more than 100 million salespeople.12 Table 6-2 shows a  
U.S. industry overview.
FIGURE 6-5
Direct Selling via 
Telemarketing
With telemarketing, 
trained salespeople 
interact with customers 
virtually anywhere. They 
describe product features, 
answer questions, 
arrange for payment and 
shipping, and follow-up 
to see if customers 
are satisfied after 
purchasing. However, 
today, many people feel 
that telemarketing is too 
intrusive.

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
A direct-selling strategy emphasizes convenient shopping and a personal touch, and detailed 
demonstrations can be made. Consumers often relax more at home than in stores. They are also apt 
to be attentive and are not exposed to competing brands (as in stores). For some, such as older 
consumers and those with young children, in-store shopping is difficult due to limited mobility. For 
the retailer, direct selling has less overhead cost because stores and fixtures are not necessary.
Despite its advantages, direct selling in the United States is growing slowly:
▶
▶Online transactions are easier and offer many more seller product options for shoppers.
▶
▶More women work, and they may not be interested in or available for at-home selling.
▶
▶The desire for full-time careers and job opportunities in other fields have reduced the pool of 
people interested in direct-selling jobs.
▶
▶A firm’s market coverage is limited by the size of its sales force.
▶
▶Sales productivity is low because the average transaction is small and most consumers are 
unreceptive—many will not open their doors to salespeople or talk to telemarketers.
▶
▶Sales force turnover is high because employees are often poorly supervised part-timers.
▶
▶To stimulate sales personnel, compensation is usually 25 to 50 percent of the revenues they 
generate. This means average to above-average prices.
▶
▶There are legal constraints due to deceptive and high-pressure sales tactics. One is the FTC’s 
Telemarketing Sales Rule (https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0198-telemarketing-sales-
rule). It mandates that firms must disclose their identity and that the call’s purpose is selling.
▶
▶Because door-to-door has a poor image, the industry prefers the term direct selling.
Firms are reacting to these issues. Avon, for example, places greater emphasis on workplace 
sales, offers free training to sales personnel, rewards the best workers with better territories, 
The Direct Selling 
Association (www.dsa 
.org) is working hard to 
promote the image and 
professionalism of this 
retail format.

With the latest products in home automation, such as turbo bikes 
and camera drones, even tech-savvy consumers may have dif-
ficulty figuring out how to use their new toys. Most people can 
relate to this problem. For example, you purchase a new smart-
phone and realize that it may be too smart. Enter Enjoy.com, an 
online retailer that hand-delivers a product, sets it up, and gives 
a tutorial; the entire visit may last up to an hour. Enjoy.com con-
tacts customers ahead of time to understand exactly what help 
the shopper wants. It’s the perfect marriage of online shopping’s 
convenience and the hands-on experience with a trusted tech 
expert that an in-store experience provides. Thus far, Enjoy.com 
has been limited to San Francisco and New York City, where it is 
a shipping option for partners such as AT&T.

pursues more global sales, and places cosmetics kiosks in shopping centers. Mary Kay hires 
community residents as salespeople and has a party atmosphere rather than a strict door-to-door 
approach; this requires networks of family, friends, and neighbors. And every major direct-selling 
firm has a Web site to supplement revenues.
Among the leading direct sellers are Avon and Mary Kay (cosmetics), Amway (household 
supplies), Tupperware (plastic containers), Shaklee (health products), Fuller Brush (small house-
hold products), and Kirby (vacuum cleaners). Some stores, such as J. C. Penney, also use direct 
selling. Penney’s decorator consultants sell a complete line of furnishings, not available in its 
stores, to consumers in their homes (http://goo.gl/MkpvjI).
VENDING MACHINES
A vending machine is a cash- or card-operated retailing format that dispenses goods (such as 
beverages) and services (such as electronic arcade games). It eliminates use of sales personnel 
and allows 24-hour sales. Machines can be placed wherever convenient for consumers—inside or 
outside stores, in motel corridors, at train stations, or on street corners. See Figure 6-6.
Although there have been many attempts to “vend” clothing, magazines, and other general 
merchandise, the vast majority of the $65 billion in annual U.S. vending machine sales involve 
cold beverages, candy, snacks, and confections. The greatest sales at are public places such as ser-
vice stations and at offices; colleges, universities, and elementary schools; factories; and hospitals 
and nursing homes.13 Newspapers on street corners and sidewalks, various machines in hotels and 
motels, and candy machines in restaurants and at train stations are visible aspects of vending but 
account for a small percentage of U.S. vending machine sales. Leading vending machine operators 
are Aramark Corporation and Canteen.
Items priced above $1.50 have not sold well; too many coins are required, and some vending 
machines do not have dollar bill changers. Consumers are reluctant to buy more expensive items 
that they cannot see displayed or have explained. However, their expanded access to and use of 
debit cards are having an impact on resolving the payment issue, and the video-kiosk type of 
vending machine lets people see product displays and get detailed information (and then place a 
credit or debit card order). Popular brands and standardized nonfood items are best suited to 
increasing sales via vending machines.
To improve productivity and customer relations, vending operators are being innova-
tive. Popular products such as french fries are made fresh in vending machines. Machine 
malfunctions are reduced by applying electronic mechanisms to cash-handling controls. 
Microprocessors track consumer preferences, trace malfunctions, and record receipts. Some 
machines have voice synthesizers that are programmed to say “Thank you, come again” or 
“Your change is 25 cents.”
Operators must still deal with theft, vandalism, items out of stock, above-average prices, and 
a perception that vending machines should be used only when a fill-in convenience item is needed.
The Canteen Corporation 
(www.canteen.com) 
has vending machines 
at thousands of client 
locations.

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
Major regulatory issues confronting the industry concern cigarette sales and beverages sold 
at public schools. Prior to age restrictions on cigarettes, cigarette sales at vending machines made 
up 25 percent of vending machine sales. They now comprise 1 percent of vending machine sales. 
New regulations imposed starting in the 2014–15 school year by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids 
Act of 2010 limit sodium, sugar, and calories in all snack items sold at school vending machines.
ELECTRONIC RETAILING: THE EMERGENCE OF THE WORLD WIDE 
WEB
We are living through exciting changes from the days when retailing simply meant visiting a store, 
shopping from a printed catalog, greeting the Avon lady in one’s home, or buying candy from 
a vending machine. Who would have thought a generation or so ago that a person would have 
his or her own personal computer with which to research (“surf” the Web) a stock, learn about a 
new product, search for bargains, save a trip to the store, and complain about customer service? 
These activities are taken for granted today. Let’s look at the Web (or the World Wide Web, as it 
was initially called) from a retailing perspective, remembering that selling on the Web is a form 
of direct marketing.
Our discussion begins with defining two terms that may be confusing: The Internet is a global 
electronic superhighway of computer networks that use a common protocol and that are linked 
by telecommunications lines and satellites. It acts as a single, cooperative virtual network and is 
maintained by universities, governments, and businesses. The World Wide Web (Web) is one way 
to access information on the Internet, whereby people work with easy-to-use Web addresses (sites) 
and pages. Users see words, charts, pictures, and video, and hear audio—which turn their comput-
ers, smartphones, and tablets into interactive multimedia centers. People can easily move from site 
to site by pointing at the proper spot on the screen and clicking a mouse button, or by touching 
the screen. Browsing software, such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and 
Apple Safari—as well search engines such as Google, Bing, and Safari—facilitate “Web surfing.”
Both the Internet and the Web convey the same theme: online interactive retailing. Because 
almost all online retailing is done via the Web, our discussion focuses on these topics: the role of 
the Web, the scope of Web retailing, characteristics of Web users, factors to consider in planning 
whether to have a Web site, and examples of Web retailers. Visit our blog (www.bermanevansretail 
.com) for lots of information on E-retailing.
The Role of the Web
From the vantage point of the retailer, the World Wide Web can serve manyone or more roles:
▶
▶Project a retail presence and enhance the retailer’s image.
▶
▶Generate sales as the major source of revenue for an online retailer or as a complementary 
source of revenue for a store-based retailer.
▶
▶Reach geographically dispersed consumers, including foreign ones.
▶
▶Provide information to consumers about products carried, store locations, usage information, 
answers to common questions, customer loyalty programs, and so on.
▶
▶Promote new products and fully explain and demonstrate their features.
▶
▶Furnish customer service in the form of E-mail, hotlinks, and other communications.
▶
▶Be more “personal” with consumers by letting them point and click on topics they choose.
▶
▶Conduct a retail business in a cost-efficient manner.
▶
▶Obtain customer feedback and reviews, and encourage “conversations” via social media.
▶
▶Foster two-way communication through social media.
▶
▶Promote special offers and send coupons to Web customers.
▶
▶Indicate employment opportunities.
▶
▶Present information to potential investors, potential franchisees, and the media.
The role a retailer assigns to the Web depends on (1) whether its major goal is to communicate 
interactively with consumers, sell goods and services, or engage in both of these activities; (2) 
whether it is predominantly a traditional store-based retailer that wants to have a Web presence 
or a newer firm that wants to derive most or all of its sales from the Web; and (3) the level of 
resources the retailer wants to commit to site development and maintenance. Worldwide, there are 
millions of Web sites and 650,000+ retailers that each generate at least $1,000 in annual sales.

	
CHAPTER 6   •  Web, Nonstore-Based, and Other Forms of Nontraditional Retailing	
165	
The Scope of Web Retailing
The potential for online retailing is enormous: As of mid-2016, there were 314 million Web users 
in North America, 604 million in Europe, 1.6 billion in Asia, 344 million in Latin America/Carib-
bean, 330 million in Africa, and 123 million in the Middle East.14 Well over 90 percent of U.S. 
Web users have made at least one online purchase; and 80+ percent have made at least one online 
purchase in the last 6 months. A decade ago, U.S. shoppers generated 75 percent of worldwide 
online sales; the amount is now one-quarter and falling—as online shopping has grown around 
the globe. Today, Chinese online shoppers spend more than anywhere else.
Forrester, a leading Internet research firm, projects that U.S. shoppers will spend  
$530.1 billion online by 2020. This represents a 57 percent growth from online sales in 2015.15 
The high growth of the Web will not be the death knell of store-based retailing. Instead, it will 
constitute another choice for shoppers, like other forms of direct marketing. There is much higher 
sales growth for “clicks-and-mortar” Web retailing (multichannel and omnichannel retailing) than 
“bricks-and-mortar” stores (single-channel retailing) and “clicks-only” Web firms (single-channel 
retailing). Many shoppers seek a “seamless omnichannel experience,” which enables them to buy 
online, and pick it up in a local store.
Despite economic challenges worldwide, global online revenues have increased steadily to 
$2.05 trillion in 2016 and are expected to reach $3.6 trillion in 2019.16 U.S. online retail revenues 
were $340.61 billion17 and mobile revenues were $89 billion in 2015.18 U.S. retail E-commerce 
sales as a percent of total retail sales has been increasing since 2006, and has a far higher growth 
rate than overall retail sales.19 Mobile commerce surged ahead of computer commerce in terms 
of time spent shopping for the first time in early 2015 (59 percent compared to 41 percent for 
computer); however, it still lags computers in share of online spending (15 percent to 85 percent).20 
Figure 6-7 indicates the percentage of global consumers who have ever made online purchases by 
selected product category. Table 6-3 shows the most attractive countries in the world for online 
retailing, as determined by A. T. Kearney’s Global Retail E-Commerce Index.

As Table 6-3 shows, the Global Retail E-Commerce Index high-
lights investment opportunities around the world. The 2015 index 
gives the highest score to the United State due to its continued 
growth, improving economy, and higher levels of consumer con-
fidence. China, which scored highest in 2014, dropped one posi-
tion in 2015 due to weaker E-commerce growth and concerns 
over infrastructure investments and consumer spending. Brazil 
dropped in rank due to logistics issues, and Argentina declined 
due to government regulations. A co-author of the study noted 
that the future of E-commerce is not online, but in omnichannel 
offerings that link online with store based shopping.

Despite the foregoing data, the Web accounts for only 8 percent or so of U.S. retail sales! 
It will not be the death knell of store-based retailing; rather, it will service as another choice for 
shoppers, like other forms of direct marketing. There is much higher sales growth for “clicks-and-
mortar” Web retailing (multichannel and omnichannel retailing) than “bricks-and-mortar” stores 
(single-channel retailing) and “clicks-only” Web firms (single-channel retailing). Store-based 
retailers account for more than three-quarters of U.S. online sales.
Consumers may switch between retail formats—online or in-store based on their shopping ori-
entation at each purchase occasion. “Order online, pick up in store” is a very profitable retail option. 
Retailers need to respond to consumers’ changing habits. British retailer John Lewis used augmented 
reality to create an “endless showroom” to help its in-store customers browse through thousands 
of products in all varieties, sizes, colors, and fabrics—available in the store and online—and to get 
contextual information. This “endless showroom” enables the customers to make a more informed 
decision and buy faster. The future may mean that less stock is displayed in-store, but it is displayed 
with more flair as more space is available to create displays that make the consumer go Wow!21

	
CHAPTER 6   •  Web, Nonstore-Based, and Other Forms of Nontraditional Retailing

Characteristics of Web Users
Web users in the United States have these characteristics, which are highlighted in Figure 6-8:
▶
▶Gender. There are about as many males as females on the Web; however, females are some-
what more likely to shop online.
▶
▶Age. Those who are ages18 to 29 are most likely to use the Web; those who are age 65 and 
older are least likely.
▶
▶Community type. Suburban and urban residents are slightly more apt to use the Web than 
rural residents.
▶
▶Income. Nearly four-fifths of households with an annual income under $30,000 use the Web; 
in contrast, 99 percent of households with an annual income of at least $75,000 use the Web.
▶
▶Education. Those who have attended college are more likely to use the Internet than those 
who have not, especially those with a high school degree or less.
Following are some key factors for online shoppers regarding their continued patronage. 
(1) Web site design/interaction: All Web site elements (excluding customer service)—including 
navigation, information search, product and price offerings, product availability, order process-
ing, and shipment tracking—impact the informational and experiential value customers seek. (2) 
Reliability: Customers want what they order based on the textual and visual description on the 
retailer’a Web site and delivery of the right product at the right price (billed correctly, etc.) in good 
condition within the promised time frame. (3) Service: Customer service expectations include 
insightful and supportive responses to inquiries and returns/complaints quickly during and after 
the sale. (4) Privacy/security: Shoppers want to know that their personal data are protected and 
to be assured that credit-card payments are secure during and after the sale.22
More Web users can be enticed to shop more often if they are assured of privacy, retailers 
are perceived as trustworthy, sites are easy to maneuver, there are strong money-back guarantees, 
they can return a product to a store, shipping costs are not hidden until the end of the purchase 
process, transactions are secure, they can speak with sales representatives, download time is fast, 
and the retailer has smartphone and tablet apps available.
Factors to Consider in Planning Whether to Have a Web Site
The Web offers many advantages for retailers. It is usually less costly to operate a Web site than 
a store. The potential marketplace is huge and dispersed, yet relatively easy to reach. Web sites 
can be quite exciting, due to their multimedia capabilities. People can visit Web sites at any time, 
and their visits can be as short or as long as they desire. Information can be targeted, so that, for 
example, a person visiting a toy retailer’s Web site could click on the icon labeled “Educational 
Toys—ages 3 to 6.” A customer database can be established and customer feedback obtained.

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
The Web also has disadvantages for retailers. For example, if consumers do not know the 
Web address, it may be hard to find. For various reasons, some people are not yet willing to buy 
online. There is tremendous clutter with regard to the number of Web sites. Because Web surfers 
are easily bored, a Web site must be regularly updated to ensure repeat visits. The more multi-
media features a Web site has, the slower it may be for people with weak Internet connections to 
access. Some firms have been overwhelmed with customer service requests and questions from 
E-mail. It may be hard to coordinate store and Web transactions. There are few standards or rules 
as to what may be portrayed at Web sites. Consumers expect online services to be free and are 
reluctant to pay for them.
There is a large gulf between full-scale, integrated Web selling and a basic “telling”—rather 
than “selling”—Web site. A “telling” site emphasizes information about the retailer and where its 
stores are located; little attention is devoted to facilitating transactions. A “selling” site includes 
the features of a telling site, but is also a dynamic transaction-oriented approach. Many retailers 
have responded by simply transferring their existing strategies to an online channel. Instead, they 
should follow the nine stages highlighted in Figure 6-9.
In addition, to achieve profitable growth in this challenging environment, A. T. Kearney offers 
“10 Steps to Reach Online Sales Excellence.” These steps show how to shape and implement a 
strategy to address both the strengths and weaknesses of online retailing in an omnichannel setting. 
A. T. Kearney clients have seen revenue growth of 40 to 50 percent above the industry average 
when utilizing this approach:23
▶
▶Shape your offering. (1) Define your omnichannel strategy. (2) Shape your assortment to target 
your customer. (3) Optimize pricing strategies.

1.
Be sure there is a customer base interested in you having an online retail business: Who will
shop online? Why? What do they want in online shopping?
2.
Two options when starting are (a) becoming a bricks-and-clicks retailer or (b) beginning as an
online retailer. Note: The ﬁrst option has a customer following and name recognition—at least
among its store-based customers.
3.
Select a distinctive and easy-to-remember Web address (URL). This may be diﬃcult given that
many addresses have already been taken. So be creative.
4.
Design the Web site using do-it-yourself software—or have the site professionally designed by a
specialist—and prepare content to appear on the site. The design must encourage people to
spend time at the Web site and to make purchases. Make the site easy to navigate and have your
competitive advantages stand out. Use photos with good resolution. Have highly visible “about
us,” “products,” “buy,” “add to cart,” and “shipping” buttons. Regularly update content.
5.
Make shopping easy and secure. Oﬀer multiple payment options, with PayPal the simplest format
for smaller retailers (it processes leading credit/debit cards). Have an SSL (secure sockets layer)
certiﬁcate and display it to allay privacy fears. Describe the policies for cancellations, returns,
and shipping. Send E-mails conﬁrming orders and let customers track their orders.
6.
Have logistics in place for storing, shipping, and returning merchandise. Have shippers lined up.
Monitor order fulﬁllment and inventory. Coordinate store and online sales, if engaged in both.
7.
Promote the Web site as much as possible—online and oﬄine. Make sure the site is search
engine optimized (SEO) for Google, Bing, etc., with regard to key words, headings, and so forth.
Use opt-in E-mail to stay in touch with customers.
8.
After the online business is running well, become more engaged with social media. This presents
many opportunities and provides ongoing customer feedback.
9.
Measure Web site performance and revise the strategy as needed. If shopping cart abandonment
(whereby the shopper stops before paying) is high, the causes must be remedied.

Web retailers should carefully consider these recommendations, which build on the preceding 
list. They are compiled from several industry experts:
▶
▶Develop (or exploit) a well-known, trustworthy retailer name.
▶
▶Tailor the product assortment for Web shoppers, and keep freshening the offerings.
▶
▶With download speed in mind, provide pictures and ample product information.
▶
▶Enable shoppers to make as few clicks as possible to get information and place orders.
▶
▶Provide the best possible search engine at the firm’s Web site.
▶
▶Capitalize on information about customers and relationships.
▶
▶Integrate online and offline businesses, and look for partnering opportunities.
▶
▶With permission, save customer data to make future shopping trips easier.
▶
▶Indicate shipping fees upfront and be clear about delivery options.
▶
▶Do not promote items that are out of stock; and let shoppers know immediately if items will 
not be shipped for a few days.
▶
▶Offer online order tracking.
▶
▶Use a secure order entry system for shoppers.
▶
▶Prominently state the firm’s return and privacy policies.
See the checklist in Figure 6-10.
A firm cannot just put up a site and wait for consumers to visit it in droves and then expect 
them to happily come back. In many cases: (1) It is still difficult for people to find exactly what 
they are looking for. (2) The inability of the digital interface to convey spatial, haptic (sense of 
touch), and olfactory cues is a limitation if purchasing products that have experiential attributes. 
Some large retailers provide virtual online experiences in the form of 3D images and videos—
applications that render augmented reality depictions of products; however, this technology is in its 
early stage of development and needs to be user-friendly. (3) Customer service may be lacking. (4) 
Friction and barriers between Web sites and their store operations may occur: “Send someone a gift 
from CompanyA.com and the recipient may be surprised to find it can’t be returned or exchanged

at a Company A store.” (5) Privacy policies may not be consumer-oriented. Many online retailers 
are aggressive in their use of ad-retargeting technology, in which a customer who orders from a 
Web site, clicks on an E-mail newsletter, fills out a survey, or merely browses the Web site finds 
his or her E-mail box stuffed with junk mail.24
Mobile Apps Enabling Online Retailing
The retail industry has been an early adopter of mobile technology; certainly many retailers have 
made mobile applications central to their strategies, operations, and customer communications. 
Almost 30 percent of transactions at U.S. online retailers and travel firms are driven by mobile 
apps.25 Astute retailers recognize that their mobile app strategy is more than transferring Web site 
features and functions to the mobile platform; one in five mobile apps are tried once and never 
opened again.
Any retail mobile app should have the following basic elements: (1) An efficient customer 
login that provides clear reasons for requiring customers to register, collecting minimal infor-
mation to personalize customer experiences, and assuring protection of the information. (2) An 
account management system that allows customers to check and manage their accounts and 
check rewards information quickly, and that provides links to the mobile site for more complex 
information requests. (3) Notifications that engage customers and nurture loyalty; 140-character 
­messaging with personalized data, offers, or reward updates serve as reminders to click on the app 
and connect with the retailer. (4) A “browse products” service that allows customers to browse 
products and check inventory online; omnichannel retailers should enable geotargeting so users 
selecting store pickup automatically default to a local store’s on-hand inventory. (5) A native shop-
ping cart and payment system that allows customers to buy from the mobile app and close the deal, 
instead of bouncing them to the mobile Web site, which can add delays and increase purchase 
abandonment. (6) A store locator that gives targeted information about the local store address 
(connected to a mobile phone mapping app), telephone numbers, and hours.26
Examples of Web Retailing in Action
Amazon.com (www.amazon.com) is one of the largest retailers of any type by revenue; it is the 
largest pure Web retailer in the world, with revenues exceeding $107 billion in 2015, and has tens 
of millions of customers who buy from the firm each year.27 Amazon.com has three distinct lines: 
Business Prime, Marketplace, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). They differ in their customer 
base: AWS serves enterprise customers, Marketplace serves third-party retailers, and Prime serves 
the best retail customers.
Amazon.com started in 1995 as just an online bookseller. Its core business has greatly evolved. 
Amazon Prime is subscription-based—a “physical-digital hybrid” including not just free 2-day 
delivery of over 30 million items in 35 cities around the world but it also offers music, photo stor-
age, the Kindle Owners’ Lending Library, and streaming films and TV shows. For example, Prime 
Video offers exclusive, original, Emmy-award winning shows. Amazon characterizes Prime Video 
as “feeding the Prime flywheel.” Amazon customers who watch Prime Video are more likely to 
convert from a free trial to a paid membership, and more likely to renew their annual subscriptions. 
In 2015, Amazon initiated Prime Day, when Prime members can buy select products at discounted 
price. It is also an effective way to increase Prime customer acquisition and retention.
Through the Amazon Marketplace, more than 70,000 third-party sellers offer their prod-
ucts on Amazon (for a listing fee), increasing the assortment variety for Amazon customers and 
leveraging Amazon’s logistics capability for product delivery. Amazon.com has also produced 
cutting-edge, popular products—Kindle (E-book readers); Firestick and Fire-TV (streaming video 
and music from Amazon, Netflix, YouTube, and others); Dash (one-touch product ordering from 
Amazon; and Echo (a voice-enabled wireless speaker that operates as a home-automation hub).28
At the opposite end of the spectrum from Amazon.com is the specialty business of Seamless 
.com (www.seamless.com). Seamless offers small and large businesses an organized and cost-
cutting way to order food for delivery and pick up from more than 12,000 restaurants and over 
80 cuisine types. It provides interactive tools for the entire process—consolidated ordering and 
invoicing, the monitoring of food and catering expenses, and expense documentation that clients 
can use for tax purposes. Seamless is the nation’s largest online and mobile food ordering com-
pany with more than one million members. It has made ordering food fast and easy for individual 
employees and business administrators by featuring interactive menus, ratings and reviews, and

new restaurants. Office administrators can set ordering “rules” based on expense account allow-
ances for each employee or department on computers or using their mobile applications on mul-
tiple platforms. Seamless serves New York; Washington, D.C.; Boston; Chicago; San Francisco; 
Los Angeles; Philadelphia; London; and other U.S. cities.29
CarMax (www.carmax.com), as highlighted in Figure 6-11, is a leading bricks-and-clicks 
retailer that sells new and used cars and buys used cars. It has 150 retail outlets. On the Web site, 
shoppers can find the cars with the specific features that they want to buy, find out the exact prices 
of those cars (CarMax has no-haggle pricing), find the location of the nearest dealers, and schedule 
appointments to see the value of used cars that customers want to sell to Carmax.30
Dollar Tree (www.dollartree.com), as depicted in Figure 6-12, is another bricks-and-clicks 
retailer with a unique online strategy. It has one of the few sites where customers can shop for 
items priced at $1—the amount of every Dollar Tree product. On the Web site, customers can 
find information on Dollar Tree’s Value Seekers Club, access ads and catalogs, read a company 
blog, shop, and more. Because of its low-price policy, customers can order online and pick up in 
the store for no delivery fee, but they must pay a delivery fee if they want items shipped to them.
Other interesting Web retailing illustrations include eBay (www.ebay.com), Priceline.com 
(www.priceline.com), and uBid.com (www.ubid.com), all of which offer online auctions. Even 
the nonprofit Goodwill has an auction Web site (www.shopgoodwill.com) to sell donated items.

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
OTHER NONTRADITIONAL FORMS OF RETAILING
Two other nontraditional institutions merit discussion: video kiosks and airport retailing. Although 
both formats have existed for years, they are now more popular than ever. They appeal to retailers’ 
desires to use new technology (video kiosks) and to locate in sites with high pedestrian traffic 
(airports).
Video Kiosks
The video kiosk is a freestanding, interactive, electronic computer terminal that displays products 
and related information on a video screen. It often has a touch screen for consumers to make selec-
tions. Retail store kiosks locate items in the store and enhance customer service. They also let 
consumers place orders, complete transactions (typically with a credit card), cross-sell products, 
sell tickets, and arrange for shipping. Kiosks can be linked to retailers’ computer networks or to 
the Web. There are more than 2.5 million video kiosks in use throughout the world, more than one 
million of which are Internet connected. In the United States, they generate $20 billion in annual 
retail sales. It is estimated that kiosks influence $1 trillion in global retail sales annually—by pro-
viding product and warranty information, showing product assortments, displaying out-of-stock 
products, and listing products by price. Transactions at self-service kiosks are growing by more 
than 7 percent in North America, which accounts for the majority of kiosk sales, followed by the 
Pacific Rim, Europe, and the rest of the world.31
How exactly do video kiosks work? They are self-contained, computer-style terminals 
through which self-service shoppers can access information and facilitate transactions. Video 
kiosks can enable self–check-ins at airports, demonstrate products in stores, dispense tickets, offer 
DVD rentals, take and transmit meal orders, and a whole lot more. Kiosk systems use hardware 
designs that can include numerous peripherals, such as touch screens, printers, and barcode and 
QR code scanners. Consumers can use on-screen keyboards for data entry, along with card readers 
and barcode scanners. A thermal printer is the most common output device. Interactive kiosks 
may have a customized, hardened enclosure or be a standard PC that has been repurposed (for 
example, IBM’s Anyplace Kiosk). Almost all video kiosks are interactive.32
Video kiosks can be placed almost anywhere (from a store aisle to the lobby of a college 
dormitory to a hotel lobby), require few employees, and are an entertaining and easy way to shop. 
Many shopping centers and individual stores are putting their space to better, more profitable use 
by setting up video kiosks in previously underutilized areas. These kiosks carry everything from 
gift certificates to concert tickets to airline tickets. For example, Staples has launched omnichannel 
stores that feature endless-aisle kiosks and consultation areas for small-business customers—or 
what the company calls “the future of retail.” Staples said the stores allow it to leverage its real-
estate and digital capabilities. The pilot stores, in Norwood, Massachusetts, and Dover, Delaware, 
also serve as test labs for new goods and services. The move is part of an effort to reduce the size 
of its stores by 15 percent.33
The average hardware cost to a retailer per video kiosk is several thousand dollars plus 
ongoing content development and kiosk maintenance. Hardware prices range from under  
$500 per kiosk to $10,000 to $15,000 or more per kiosk, depending on its functions—the more 
features, the higher the price.34
Airport Retailing
In the past, the leading airport retailers were fast-food outlets, tiny gift stores, and newspaper/
magazine stands. Today, airports are a major mecca of retailing. At virtually every large airport, as 
well as at many medium ones, there are full-blown shopping areas. And most small airports have 
at least a fast-food retailer and vending machines for newspapers, candy, and so forth.
The potential retail market is huge. Worldwide, more than 1,200 commercial airports handle 
nearly 5 billion passengers each year—with North America accounting for one-third of global 
passenger traffic. U.S. airports alone fly millions of passengers each day and employ nearly  
2 million people (who often buy something for their personal use at the airport). There are more 
than 400 primary commercial U.S. airports. Overall, airport retailing generates $45 billion in 
global sales annually, and many airports generate annual retail revenues of at least $50 million.35 
Retail sales at duty-free shops throughout the world are forecast to reach $74 billion in 2019. The 
largest categories of goods sold are personal care and drinks.36 See Figure 6-13.

173	
Airline-related sales at most major airports account for 40 percent of revenue; the remaining 
60 percent is derived from other sources (predominantly retail sales). Most airport hubs are nearing 
full-flight utilization; the only way they can grow is by increasing retail income. Airports in the 
Middle East and Singapore are designed to be luxury retail and family experience destinations. The 
Ark at New York’s Kennedy Airport offers luxury accommodations for pets.37 Airport stores target 
teenagers, women, and bargain shoppers; retailers typically pay 10 percent more rent for the airport 
shopping area. Domestic leisure travelers spend more than an hour, on average, waiting in airports 
after passing security and are likely to buy food and beverages and to shop than those who spend 
less time at the airport. Sales at airports are expected to increase by 73 percent from 2013 to 2019.38
Some of the distinctive features of airport retailing are:
▶
▶There is a large group of prospective shoppers. In an average year, a big airport may have 20 
million or more people passing through its concourses. In contrast, a typical regional shopping 
mall attracts 5 million to 6 million annual visits.
▶
▶Air travelers are a temporarily captive audience at the airport who are looking to fill their 
waiting time, which could be up to several hours. They tend to have above-average incomes.
▶
▶Sales per square foot of retail space are much higher than at regional malls. Rent is about 20 
to 30 percent higher per square foot for airport retailers.
▶
▶Airport stores are smaller, carry fewer items, and have higher prices than traditional stores.
▶
▶Replenishing merchandise and stocking shelves may be difficult at airport stores because they 
are physically removed from delivery areas and space is limited.
▶
▶The sales of gift items and forgotten travel items, from travelers not having the time to shop 
elsewhere, are excellent. Brookstone, which sells garment bags and travel clocks at airport 
shops, calls these products “‘I forgot”’ merchandise.
▶
▶Passengers are at airports at all times of the day. Thus, longer store hours are possible.
▶
▶International travelers are often interested in duty-free shopping.
▶
▶There is much tighter security at airports than before, which has had a dampening effect on 
some shopping.

Chapter Summary
1.	 To contrast single-channel, multichannel, and omnichan-
nel retailing. A new retailer often relies on single-­channel 
retailing, whereby it sells to consumers through one retail 
format. As the firm grows, it may turn to multichannel 
retailing and sell to consumers through multiple retail 
formats. This allows the firm to reach different custom-
ers, share costs among various formats, and diversify its 
supplier base. To optimize efficiency and enhance cus-
tomer experiences, the best retailers turn to omnichannel 
retailing.

174	
PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
2.	 To look at the characteristics of the three major retail 
institutions involved with nonstore-based strategy 
mixes—direct marketing, direct selling, and vending 
machines—with an emphasis on direct marketing. Firms 
employ nonstore retailing to reach customers and com-
plete transactions. Nonstore retailing encompasses direct 
marketing, direct selling, and vending machines.
In direct marketing, a consumer is exposed to goods or 
services through a nonpersonal medium and orders by mail, 
phone, fax, or computer. Annual U.S. retail sales from direct 
marketing (including the Web) exceed $475 billion. Direct 
marketers fall into two categories: general and specialty. 
Among the strengths of direct marketing are its reduced 
operating costs, large geographic coverage, customer con-
venience, and targeted segments. Among the weaknesses 
are a shopper’s inability to examine items before purchase, 
printing and mailing costs, the low response rate, and mar-
ketplace clutter. Under the “30-day rule,” there are legal 
requirements that a firm must follow regarding shipping 
speed. The long-run prospects for direct marketing are 
strong due to consumer interest in reduced shopping time, 
24-hour ordering, the sales of well-known brands, improve-
ments in operating efficiency, and technology.
The key to direct marketing is the customer database, 
with database retailing being a way to collect, store, and 
use relevant data. Several trends are vital to direct market-
ers: consumer attitudes and activities, changing lifestyles, 
more competition, the use of multichannel and omnichan-
nel retailing, the roles for catalogs and TV, technology 
advances, and growth in global direct marketing. Specia-
logs and infomercials are used more by direct marketers.
A direct marketing plan has eight stages: business def-
inition, generating customers, media selection, present-
ing the message, customer contact, customer response, 
order fulfillment, and measuring results and maintaining 
the database. Firms must consider that many people dis-
like shopping this way, feel overwhelmed by the amount 
of direct mail, and are concerned about privacy.
Direct selling includes personal contact with consum-
ers in their homes (and other nonstore sites) and seller 
phone calls. It yields $35 billion in annual U.S. retail 
sales, covering many goods and services. The strategy 
mix stresses convenience, a personal touch, demonstra-
tions, and relaxed consumers. U.S. sales are not going 
up much due to the rise in working women, the labor 
intensity of the business, sales force turnover, govern-
ment rules, and the poor image of some firms.
A vending machine uses coin- and card-operated dis-
pensing of goods and services. It eliminates salespeople, 
allows 24-hour sales, and may be put almost anywhere. 
Beverages and food represent the vast majority of the 
$65 billion in annual U.S. vending revenues. Efforts in 
other product categories have met with customer resis-
tance, and items priced above $1.50 have not done well.
3.	 To explore the emergence of electronic retailing through 
the Web. The Internet is a global electronic superhigh-
way that acts as a single, cooperative virtual network. 
The World Wide Web (theWeb) is a way to access infor-
mation on the Internet, whereby people turn computers 
into interactive multimedia centers. The Web can serve 
various retailer purposes, from projecting an image to 
presenting information to investors. The purpose chosen 
depends on the goals and focus. There is a great contrast 
between store retailing and Web retailing.
The growth of Web-based retailing has been enor-
mous. Annual U.S. revenues from retailing on the Web 
are expected to reach $530 billion in 2020. Nonetheless, 
the Web still garners a small percentage of total U.S. 
retail sales.
Females spend somewhat more time shopping on the 
Web than males do. Internet usage declines by age group 
and increases by income and education level. Shoppers 
are attracted by Web site design, reliability, customer 
service, and security. Nonshoppers worry about the 
trustworthiness of online firms, want to see and handle 
products first, and do not like shipping cost surprises.
The Web offers these positive features for retailers: It 
can be inexpensive to have a Web site. The potential mar-
ketplace is huge and dispersed, yet easy to reach. Sites 
can be quite exciting. People can visit a site at any time. 
Information can be targeted. A customer database can be 
established and customer feedback obtained. Yet, if con-
sumers do not know a firm’s Web address, it may be hard 
to find. Many people will not buy online. There is clutter 
with regard to the number of retail sites. Because Web 
surfers are easily bored, a firm must regularly update its 
site to ensure repeat visits. The more multimedia fea-
tures a site has, the slower it may be to access. Some 
firms have been deluged with customer service requests. 
Improvements are needed to coordinate store and Web 
transactions. There are few standards or rules as to what 
may be portrayed at Web sites. Consumers expect online 
services to be free and are reluctant to pay for them.
A well-developed Web strategy would move through 
nine stages, from determining the customer base to mea-
suring performance. A systematic approach is vital.
4.	 To discuss two other nontraditional forms of retailing: 
video kiosks and airport retailing. The video kiosk is 
a freestanding, interactive computer terminal that dis-
plays products and other information on a video screen; 
it often has a touch screen for people to make selections. 
Although some kiosks are in stores to upgrade customer 
service, others let consumers place orders, complete 
transactions, and arrange shipping. Kiosks can be put 
almost anywhere, require few personnel, and are an 
entertaining and easy way for people to shop. They yield 
$20 billion in annual U.S. revenues.
Due to the huge size of the air travel marketplace, air-
ports are popular as retail shopping areas. Travelers (and 
workers) are temporarily captive at the airport, often 
with a lot of time to fill. Sales per square foot, as well as 
rent, are high. Gift items and “‘I forgot’ merchandise” 
sell especially well. Globally, annual retail revenues are 
$45 billion at airports.

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
Omnichannel Retailing*
As noted at the beginning of this chapter, a retail firm relies on single-channel retailing if it sells 
to consumers through one format such as the Web or a store. In multichannel retailing, a firm has 
separate channels such as a store and the Web. In a traditional multichannel retail environment, 
consumers may not be able to view store inventories online, can be charged different prices in 
each channel, cannot arrange for store pickup on a Web order, or return Web-ordered purchases to 
a local store. With multichannel retailing, the Web site and store customer databases are separate.
In contrast, omnichannel retailing delivers a consistent, uninterrupted, and seamless experi-
ence regardless of channel or devices. Omnichannel retailing assumes customers go through the 
shopping journey very differently by using different combinations of mobile, PC, tablet, and store 
activities. As an example, product discovery can be Web or social media-based, consumers can 
receive product information via the Web or through in-store observation, and consumers can buy 
an item via a mobile device but seek to pick it up and return it to a store (if unhappy). This appen-
dix focuses on omnichannel retailing because so many firms are combining store and nonstore 
retailing—as well as using multiple store formats.
Planning and maintaining a well-integrated omnichannel strategy is not easy. At a minimum, 
it requires setting up an infrastructure that can effectively link multiple channels. A retailer that 
accepts a Web purchase for exchange at a retail store needs an information system to verify the 
purchase, the price paid, the payment method, and the transaction date. That firm also needs a 
mechanism for delivering goods regardless of which channel is used by a customer to purchase.
A December 2015 study of North American retailers sheds some light on the progress these 
firms have made in adopting omnichannel strategies. When asked about the effectiveness of their 
“buy online, pickup in the store” strategy, only 18 percent of respondents stated that this was 
available and working, whereas 24 percent stated that it was available but needed improvement. 
Similarly, 16 percent of the respondents reported that returns were accepted across channels, with 
46 percent of respondents stating that this service was available but needed improvement.1
Home Depot, which annually generates billions of dollars in online sales, is a retailer that 
has been increasing its omnichannel presence. “We not only offered more spring season products 
online, but also leveraged digital media channels to highlight local in-store assortments,” CEO 
Craig Menear told investors and analysts on a conference call, referring to Home Depot’s mobile 
app’s in-store product location capabilities.2
These are some strategic and operational issues for omnichannel retailers to address:
▶
▶What omnichannel cross-selling opportunities exist? A firm could list its Web site on business 
cards, store invoices, and shopping bags. It could also list the nearest store locations when a 
consumer inputs a ZIP code at the Web site.
▶
▶How should the product assortment/variety strategy be adapted to each channel? How much 
merchandise overlap should exist across channels?
▶
▶How well can a distribution center handle direct-to-store and direct-to-consumer shipping?
▶
▶Should prices be consistent across channels (except for shipping and handling, as well as 
closeouts)?
▶
▶How can a consistent image be devised and sustained across all channels?
▶
▶What is the role of each channel? Some consumers prefer to search the Web to determine 
pricing and product information, and then they purchase in a store due to their desire to see 
the product, try it on, and gain the immediacy that accompanies an in-store transaction.
▶
▶What are the best opportunities for leveraging a firm’s assets with an omnichannel strategy? 
Many catalog retailers have logistics systems that can be easily adapted to Web-based sales.
▶
▶Do relationships with current suppliers prevent the firm from expanding into new channels?

Advantages of Omnichannel Retail Strategies
There are several advantages to a retailer’s enacting an omnichannel approach, including the 
selection of specific channels based on their unique strengths, opportunities to leverage assets, 
and opportunities for increased sales and profits by appealing to omnichannel shoppers.
Selecting Among Channels Based on Their Unique Strengths
A retailer with an omnichannel strategy can use the most appropriate channels to sell particular 
goods or services or to reach different target markets. Because each channel has a unique com-
bination of strengths, an omnichannel retailer has the best opportunities to fulfill its customers’ 
shopping desires.
Store-based shopping enables customers to see an item, feel it, smell it (e.g., candles or per-
fumes), try it out, and then pick it up and take it home on the same shopping trip without incur-
ring shipping and handling costs. Catalogs offer high visual impact, a high-quality image, and 
portability (they can be taken anywhere by the shopper). The Web offers high-quality video and 
audio capabilities, an interactive format, a personalized customer interface, virtually unlimited 
space, the ability for a customer to verify in-stock position and order status, and, in some cases, 
tax-free shopping. Mobile marketing devices are always on, always connected, and always with 
the customer; they can be easily personalized and can generate location-sensitive offers.3
In-store kiosks are helpful for shoppers not having Web access. They can lead to less inven-
tory in the store (and reduce the need to stock low-turnover items in each store), can facilitate 
self-service by providing information, and can offer high video/audio quality.
To plan an appropriate channel mix and the role of each channel, retailers must recognize how 
different channels complement one another. Best Buy (www.bestbuy.com), Costco (www.costco 
.com), Staples (www.staples.com), Home Depot (www.homedepot.com), and Walmart (www 
.walmart.com) are just a few of the retailers that have a broader selection of items on the Web to 
encourage consumers to shop online.
Opportunities to Leverage Assets
Omnichannel retailing presents opportunities for firms to leverage both tangible and intangible 
assets. A store-based retailer can leverage tangible assets by using excess capacity in its warehouse 
to service catalog or Web sales; that same firm can leverage its well-known brand name (an intan-
gible asset) by selling online in geographic areas where it has no stores. Store-based retailers can 
also arrange to ship goods ordered online or through mobile devices from closely located stores 
rather than a centralized distribution center.
Opportunities for Increased Sales and Profits by Appealing to Omnichannel 
Shoppers
Omnichannel consumers, on average, spend more and have a higher lifetime value to retailers 
than single-channel consumers. For example, Macy’s found that its omnichannel customers are 
eight times as valuable as customers who confine their shopping experience to a single channel. 
Similarly, Target found that its omnichannel customers are its most valuable, as they spend three 
times more as those who shop in a single channel.4
Developing a Well-Integrated Omnichannel Strategy
A well-integrated omnichannel strategy requires linkages among all the channels. Customers 
should be able to easily make the transition from looking up products on the Web or in a catalog 
to picking up the products in a retail store. If these linkages are not properly established, sales 
can be lost. There should be a good deal of commonality in the description and appearance of 
each item regardless of channel. For example, in-store personnel should be able to verify a Web 
or catalog purchase and arrange for returns or exchanges.
Characteristics common to superior omnichannel strategies include the following: integrated 
promotions across channels; product consistency across channels; an integrated information sys-
tem that shares customer, pricing, and inventory data across multiple channels; a store pickup 
process for items purchased on the Web or through a catalog; and the search for omnichannel 
opportunities with appropriate partners.

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
Integrating Promotions across Channels
Cross-promotion enables consumers to use each promotional forum in its best light. Following is 
a list of some cross-promotion tactics:
▶
▶Include the Web site address on shopping bags, in catalogs, and in newspaper ads.
▶
▶Provide in-store kiosks so customers can order out-of-stock merchandise without a shipping fee.
▶
▶Include store addresses, phone numbers, hours, and directions on the Web site and in catalogs.
▶
▶Make it possible for customers to shop for items on the Web using the catalog order numbers.
▶
▶Distribute store coupons by direct mail, online. and mobile sources; offer catalogs in stores 
and at the Web site.
▶
▶Encourage in-store shoppers to use their smartphones to scan barcodes and get more product 
information.
▶
▶Target single-channel customers with promotions from other channels.
▶
▶Send store-based shoppers targeted E-mails on their mobile device (on an opt-in basis) for 
selected goods and services.
▶
▶Have a strong social media presence.
Ensuring Product Consistency across Channels
Too little product overlap across channels may result in an inconsistent image. However, too much 
overlap may result in a loss of sales opportunities. Omnichannel retailers often use the Web to 
offer very specialized merchandise that cannot be profitably offered in stores. This maximizes 
store space while, at the same time, fulfills specialized needs of niche market segments.
Having an Information System That Effectively Shares Data across Channels
To best manage an omnichannel system, a retailer needs an information system that shares cus-
tomer, pricing, and inventory information across channels:
▶
▶After a customer creates an online bridal registry account at Crate & Barrel, he or she can visit 
any of the chain’s stores and seamlessly synchronize the store’s scanners with their online 
accounts. This makes it easy for customers to add new items to their registry while in the store. 
Customers can also use an in-store computer to modify their product choices.5
▶
▶Rebecca Minkoff—a chain specializing in accessible luxury handbags, accessories, footwear, 
and apparel—utilizes apps to create user profiles that link what customers view online with 
what the customers try on and purchase in stores.6
▶
▶Macy’s recently combined its online and offline marketing operations to create one inventory 
system across channels. This system displays sales data, stock-on-hand, and on-order data.7
Enacting a Store-Pickup Process for Items Purchased on the Web or through a 
Catalog
In-store pickup requires that a retailer’s inventory database be integrated and that the firm has a 
logistics infrastructure that can select and route merchandise to customers. Increasingly, shoppers 
are ordering big-ticket items such as digital cameras, computers, and appliances online but picking 
them up at nearby stores. Consumers favor this approach to avoid shipping and handling charges, 
to reduce their having to navigate through a big-box store, and to avoid wasting time looking for 
items that may be out of stock.
Store pickup often enables shoppers to get items on the same day they make a purchase. 
Many customers also favor in-store pickup so that they can more easily return goods that do not 
meet their expectations.
Searching for Omnichannel Opportunities with Appropriate Partners
The retailer needs to understand that in almost all cases an omnichannel strategy requires added 
resources and competencies that are significantly greater than those demanded by a single-channel 
strategy. Some retailers may conclude that they do not have these competencies or resources; 
­others look for strategic partnerships with firms having complementary resources.

Special Challenges
An omnichannel strategy is not right for every retailer. Not all retailers possess the financial and 
managerial resources to do pursue omnichannel opportunities. A big challenge for many retailers, 
particularly small- to middle-size ones, is the consolidation of their disparate retail management 
systems into one customer-focused system. A 2015 study of retail CEOs found that 75 percent 
of the respondents did not restructure operations to provide customers with seamless shopping.8
Many of today’s leading retailers began with one channel—typically bricks-and-mortar—
and then added phone sales, Web sales, and mobile sales. As a result, these retailers usually 
devised separate information systems for each channel. Thus, each channel had a distinct infor-
mation system with its own set of customer, product, sales, and inventory data. With a move to an 
omnichannel strategy, these retailers’ overall information centers had to be unified. In this way, 
they could determine whether a large Web site or catalog user base exists within the trading area 
of a proposed retail location.
Omnichannel retailers need to maintain the same branding identity for their products across 
diverse channels. Graphic designers need to establish specific guidelines and templates so that 
type fonts, colors, and key design elements are shared across channels. To complicate matters, 
products often look different in a catalog versus on a computer screen due to Web sites and smart- 
phones having lower resolutions than print. The same can be said for variations in colors. This 
may especially affect the purchase of apparel or furniture.
A final potential difficulty is the management of a retailer’s distribution center. Such a center 
requires efficient procedures for handling both large orders that are shipped directly to stores and 
small shipments that are made to thousands or tens of thousands of customers. The system for 
handling large store-based retail purchase orders (which are often full caseloads) is quite different 
from shipping individual items to a customer’s home.

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
Case 1 Do Power Players Rule?*
A power player is any U.S. retailer with sales equal to or greater 
than 10 percent of those of the category leader.
Department Stores 
Department stores have survived the rise of sectors specializ-
ing in narrower product ranges, as well as the challenges of 
discount stores and other off-price retailers, and finally E-com-
merce. Gerald Storch, CEO of Hudson’s Bay, parent of Saks 
Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor, says, “Increasingly, consumers 
don’t think of stores as physical locations, they think of stores 
as brands. The opportunity is to customize on a mass scale so 
you simulate the selling experience on a mobile device.”
Drugstores 
National healthcare questions have been driving a lot of what has 
been going on in the drugstore industry. CVS is moving on several 
fronts: It broadened its pharmacy reach by acquiring Omnicare, 
which distributes prescription drugs to nursing homes, assisted liv-
ing facilities, and so on. CVS has unveiled the makeover of the 
Navarro Discount Pharmacy sites it acquired. Carrying the banner 
“CVS pharmacy y mas,” the South Florida stores feature bilingual 
associates and 1,500+ “trusted Hispanic products.” It also acquired 
Target’s pharmacy businesses for about $1.9 billion.
General Apparel 
Fast fashion has been rising among the ranks of apparel retail-
ers. “There is an underlying sense of rebellion that comes 
through in today’s fashion,” notes Marshal Cohen, chief indus-
try analyst with NPD Group. “The fashion industry has under-
gone one of the most dramatic makeovers in recent history, no 
doubt influenced by the Millennial consumer.”
Home Improvement and Hardware 
These have had to deal with some flooring issues. First, it was 
hardwood laminate flooring that was said to emit formaldehyde 
in excess of California state standards. Soon after, came a study 
of vinyl floor tiles, which found that 58 percent of samples 
bought from large home improvement dealers contained phthal-
ates, several forms of which have been banned from children’s 
products since 2009. The Home Depot clicked on several fronts, 
including online.
Jewelry and Accessories
Signet, which bills itself as the world’s largest retailer of diamond 
jewelry, acquired Zale Corp. The company now operates stores 
and kiosks under a variety of banners, including Kay, Jared, and 
a number of regional brands in its Sterling division, along with 
Zale, Peoples, and Piercing Pagoda in its Zale division. Zale 
operations have been growing same-store sales faster than the 
company as a whole, and Signet expects that to continue.
Mass Merchants 
Amazon has joined the ranks of mass merchant power ­players, 
selling everything from digital downloads to consumer

electronics, toilet paper, books, and groceries. Its limited face-
to-face interaction with consumers belies Amazon’s vast physi-
cal presence around the country, where a network of fulfillment 
centers puts it near to customers. Amazon’s mass market tactics 
include spreading same-day delivery to more segments of the 
population.
Supermarkets
Although mergers and acquisitions have been a way of life, 
grocery remains the most fragmented segment of retailing. Alb-
ertsons took over the remnants of Safeway’s network, covering 
much of North America, and Kroger completed its first full year 
with Harris Teeter stores under its wing. Then, after A&P and 
its affiliate brands were forced into bankruptcy in 2015, it was 
ultimately decided to sell off all the store locations to several 
major chains.
Women’s Apparel
The biggest news was a deal that closed in August 2015—
Ascena Retail Group’s acquisition of Ann Taylor and Loft par-
ent company Ann Inc. Ascena paid $2 billion to bring Ann Inc. 
into a diverse stable of brands that included Lane Bryant, Dress 
Barn, Maurices, and Justice.

Case 2 Will the Favorites of Today Remain 
Popular?*
While competition constantly shifts, the top tier of consum-
ers’ favorite online retailers is stable. There was little move-
ment among the top 10 in a 2015 consumer survey by Prosper 
Insights & Analytics; the full list includes only six relative new-
comers. This allows for greater insights about what motivates 
shoppers, where they like to shop, and what methods retail-
ers are using to draw them in—and it’s all been represented in 
recent research.
So what does it all say—and more importantly, what does 
it all mean? Pam Goodfellow, director of consumer insights 
for Prosper, provides a deeper look at two recent surveys: one 
assessed shoppers’ favorite online retail sites; the other looked 
at consumer behavior. Each provides a clear message about 
where online retailing is today, as well as the fact that consum-
ers still have their “favorites.”
“These are some of the biggest names in retail any-
way,” Goodfellow says. “These are safer retailers for a lot of

consumers to visit. Younger consumers are a little more trusting 
when it comes to online shopping. For Baby Boomers or some-
one a little older, consumers see these as safe retailers when it 
comes to online shopping.”
It’s no surprise that Amazon continues to dominate among 
all age groups, even increasing its share slightly. Millennials 
ranked it even higher. Walmart.com ranks second, although its 
share dropped slightly from 2014; Walmart ranks higher among 
Millennials than it does among Baby Boomers. Does this mean 
Amazon has a lock on online retailing? Goodfellow points to 
Walmart’s status as the top bricks-and-mortar retailer. Still, 
“Walmart has its issues competing with Amazon,” she says. 
“For the foreseeable future, Amazon will be the one to beat. 
But that’s the interesting part of retail: It’s always changing.”
There are newcomers that hope to chip away at big retail-
ers’ dominance. Take Jet, which is tackling both Amazon and 
warehouse clubs. But Amazon has something that could make 
that tough. “Amazon has collected a loyal shopper base,” Good-
fellow says. “Its customer service speaks for itself.” Even if 
Amazon Prime Day drew mixed reviews, “It shows that Ama-
zon is trying different things and still testing.” A final thought 
on Amazon: It increased its share slightly. Goodfellow believes 
“this shows that people are still discovering Amazon.”
It might be easy to gloss over Best Buy’s move to number 
three on the list of favorites. The increase was relatively small, 
though it could signal a solution to an even bigger concern: show-
rooming. “That had a lot of analysts wondering what the future 
was going to look like for Best Buy,” Goodfellow says. “With a 
focus on customer service and the price matching that it’s now 
doing, it has brought some consumers back into the fold.”
Those shopping at Best Buy and Walmart are apt to have 
triggers that drive them to the two Web sites: coupons for 
Walmart shoppers and a cable TV ad for Best Buy shoppers. 
Most triggering events—such as an online ad or text message—
are apt to move a Walmart or Best Buy shopper to the online 
store more than Amazon shoppers who are more apt to be trig-
gered by reading an article.
Data show several key insights about shoppers in general. It’s 
probably no surprise that Best Buy shoppers are the most mobile-
savvy. But what may be surprising is those same shoppers are 
more likely to compare prices or ask for a price match, and are the 
most likely to look at another retailer’s Web site while in the store.

Case 3 Omnichannel Strategies of Top Retailers*
It’s no longer bricks-and-mortar versus E-commerce—
omnichannel is the path to success. Consumers have myriad 
ways to shop, and retailers must keep up. “New [technology]

tools transform the way consumers want to shop,” says Anne 
Zybowski, a vice-president at Kantar Retail. In response, retail-
ers are re-thinking operations, from infrastructure and inventory 
systems to delivery and marketing. As measured by STORES’ 
annual “Top 100 Retailers” report, by Kantar, the evolution of 
retailing displays the survival skills of long-time firms. Chart-
topping stalwarts—Walmart, Kroger, Costco, Home Depot, 
Target, Walgreen, and CVS—have maintained dominance by 
meeting consumers’ changing desires, including for online 
shopping and digital interaction.
Amazon’s ascent continues, and although E-commerce 
has not proven to knock bricks-and-mortar off its pedestal, 
the old “location, location, location” mantra doesn’t carry the 
same weight that it once did. Instead, the two channels continue 
to converge: Store operators are seeing much digital success, 
whereas online merchants—including Amazon—are expand-
ing with showrooms, pop-up shops, and other ways of meeting 
shoppers face-to-face.
“Omnichannel remains aspirational. Today’s omni-shop-
pers know what they want,” Zybowski says, “retailers to offer 
whatever, wherever, whenever they want. When it comes to 
value, they want [to have] their cake and eat it too—they don’t 
expect to pay more for convenience.” The challenge is meet-
ing consumers’ reset expectations. “Retailers must learn how to 
fundamentally transform their business models, ones built for 
maximum efficiency and scale, and transform them into more 
nimble, effective ones,” Zybowski adds.
Tom Cole, of Kurt Salmon Associates, says mobile is key 
in omnichannel’s push to seamless consumer experiences, 
although the mobile transactions’ volume is still low. Retail-
ers need to build to omnichannel via legacy systems already 
in place. “Omnichannel is the new reality whether they engage 
or not. If you’re available where and when consumers look for 
you, great. If not, you lose to someone who is,” says Marge 
Laney, of Alert Technologies. “Online-only retailers lack the 
high engagement that the in-store experience can deliver. 
Offline-only retailers don’t deliver the comfortable experience 
that consumers utilize to make their shopping itineraries.”
“Digital is the connective tissue between online and 
­in-store,” says Claude de Jocas, intelligence group director for 
L2. “Stores have been cast as a liability in an Amazon era, but 
they’ve been making a comeback as something that’s critical to 
a retail strategy.”
Nordstrom is advanced in all facets of its omnichannel 
approach. The retailer has nearly 1 million followers who can 
shop via Instagram; its network of fulfillment centers is grow-
ing. Nordstrom has also launched a “scan-and-shop” feature 
within its catalog app that links readers of the print catalog to 
E- and M-commerce sites. “We hope that scan and shop creates 
a more seamless shopping experience for our customers who 
enjoy browsing our catalogs but also enjoy the many benefits 
technology affords the experience to make it more personal,” 
says spokesman Dan Evans, Jr.
Nordstrom is also connecting with teen shoppers via digital 
mall Wanelo; and in spring 2015, it unveiled a test of a “click-
and-collect” service that included curbside pickup. This com-
plements a more traditional buy online, pick up in-store program 
that Nordstrom has had since 2008. A third service, TextStyle, 
was launched in late May 2015 and involves all of Nordstrom’s

better deliver your retail proposition to drive stronger affinity 
and share with the shopper? How could your vendors help?
Evaluate Your Ecosystem
Once you have a good understanding of shoppers’ needs and key 
drivers, you must assess your own ecosystem. Do you have the 
technology, logistics, data, and organizational resources to operate 
against a unified view of shoppers and their activity across chan-
nels? What are the gaps in your systems that impede delivering 
the quality of experiences that will drive the desired level of shop-
per loyalty and conversion? What frustrations are shoppers com-
municating to your customer service teams or via social channels?
Experiment to Find What Works
At this point, you can then engage in the hard work of determin-
ing which things to experiment against, where to invest, and 
how to restructure your organization to deliver. It can’t be done 
all at once, but each step needs to be able to deliver meaningful 
value for shoppers and make it easier for them to accomplish 
their shopping goals with you.
As with any major new initiative, obstacles stand in the 
way of smooth implementation. Wisner, Muhammad, and oth-
ers point to organizational silos in different departments as one 
challenge to overcome. “There are operational, organizational, 
and experiential issues to resolve,” affirms Channie Mize, gen-
eral manager for the retail sector for Periscope, a McKinsey 
solution. “It’s easier to do multichannel, but that creates silos 
and doesn’t extend to customer service. Also, branding may not 
be consistent across the channels with a multichannel versus 
omnichannel approach.
“In more traditional multichannel environments,” Mize 
continues, “the chief merchant officer controls the merchan-
dising in the physical stores, while the CIO, or ‘head of online,’ 
controls the offering in the online stores. They each have differ-
ent agendas tied to different or misaligned incentive structures. 
This can cause the same retailer to cannibalize itself across 
channels, which inherently provides for less than optimal 
results for the customer.”

Case 4 Omnichannel Food Retailing Still Needs 
Work*
Grocery buying is changing due to the emergence of omnichan-
nel retailing. Consumers want options, and grocers need to be 
ready to provide them. Thus, experts say retailers will have to 
deal with selling price, venue, payment, and customer experi-
ence in all transactional channels. Doing so effectively is easier 
said than done, however.
One who understands that well is Jim Wisner, formerly a 
VP at Jewel Food Stores and Shaw’s Supermarkets. He states 
that omnichannel retailing is being able to operate, in any fash-
ion, when and where the customer wants to interact. That can 
involve customer service via social media, online chat, E-mail, or 
phone; browsing or shopping in-store or online; receiving prod-
ucts via home delivery or in-store pickup, or old-fashioned aisle 
browsing; or making coupons or discounts similar across chan-
nels. “As much as the ultimate goal needs to be a complete inte-
gration of ‘all things at all times,”’ says Wisner, now president of 
Wisner Marketing, “it is important to make sure that each indi-
vidual piece can operate functionally and effectively on its own. 
Pasting an online shopping portal to a Web site that hasn’t been 
redesigned in years or mobile-optimized won’t attract shoppers.”
DyShaun Muhammad, VP of consultancy Catapult, offers 
these three key steps for retailers:
Educate Yourself
Get to know shoppers, especially those who are most valu-
able. What really drives a shopper to actually buy a particular 
category from you? What are the barriers to his or her doing 
more transactions with you? Where do tools like mobile apps, 
flexible fulfillment, digital couponing, and more traditional 
merchandising tools fit in his or her path to purchase for your 
priority categories? How could you best deploy these tactics to

PART 2  •  COMPREHENSIVE CASE	
183	
What Consumers Find Expendable versus 
Untouchable*
Introduction
Consumers say they can cut back on most purchases: What 
won’t they give up? If retailers had to guess the one item most 
consumers say they can’t live without, they’d probably answer 
“Smartphone.” And for the most part, they would be right. 
Although Internet service actually tops the list of “untouch-
ables,” it’s hardly a leap to say that the two are intimately 
linked. Eight in 10 consumers consider Internet service non-
negotiable; 58 percent feel that way about their smartphones.
What Are Consumers Finding Expendable?
Beyond an online connection and a way to access it from the 
palm of their hands, consumers are proving to be a relatively 
agnostic bunch. Hyperinformed, price-savvy, and emboldened 
by a post-recessionary survivor attitude, consumers assert that 
things like a new pair of jeans, dining in upscale restaurants, and 
buying high-end cosmetics or a luxury handbag are expendable.
Much like their grandparents or great-grandparents, many 
of whose attitudes to shopping were shaped by the Great 
Depression, the spending behaviors of today’s shoppers are lia-
ble to be clouded by the recent Great Recession for some time. 
Still, even though they consider many products to be expend-
able, they have no problem spending on the latest smartphone 
or on-demand video streaming. Therein lies the rub.
The good news is that the economy has been bouncing 
back—recent Wall Street hysteria over China and volatile 
oil prices notwithstanding. Although financial experts don’t 
think consumers will revert to their spendthrift ways, the

PART 2
 Comprehensive Case
latest installment of “Expendables vs. Untouchables” research, 
compiled by Prosper Insights and Analytics exclusively for 
STORES, shows clear signs of consumer spending optimism. 
See Tables 1 and 2.
Among the indicators: In 2009 (the first time STORES 
reported on this research), fitness and gym memberships 
were on the chopping block, with 86 percent of respondents 
citing them as expendable. In 2015, that figure slipped to  
79 percent—72 percent among the 18- to 34-year-old cohort. 
In 2013, 73 percent of adults age 18 and older said that 
they planned to forego vacations; in 2015, that figure fell to  
66 percent.
Shopping rebounded a bit as well. When consumers 
were asked how the current state of the U.S. economy has 
affected household spending plans, 40 percent indicated that 
they planned to spend less overall; 23 percent said they would 
be dining out less frequently. In 2014, 45 percent that they 
planned to spend less overall and 28 percent expected to dine 
out less often—notable shifts in shopper attitudes. When asked 
to describe their feelings about the chances for a strong econ-
omy during the next 6 months, 46 percent of adults age 18 and 
older said they were either confident or very confident. See 
Table 3.
The data, which reflect the feedback of nearly 7,000 
consumers across the country, are part of the December 2015 
Monthly Consumer Survey taken by Prosper during the first 
2 weeks of the month.
Ongoing Recovery
“Year over year, the changes have been slim, but when you com-
pare the December 2015 survey to data compiled in December 
2008, it’s evident that consumer attitudes toward spending are 
heading in the right direction,” says Chrissy Wissinger, director 
of communications at Prosper.

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
“Communication trumps just about everything else for 
today’s consumer. They don’t want to be without Internet ser-
vice or their smartphone, and the idea of streaming video on 
demand via Netflix or Hulu has become more important every 
year since we began watching the category. Consumers seem 
more comfortable with their financial situation,” Wissinger 
says. “They’ve made cutbacks over time and now they’re mak-
ing tradeoffs in how they spend.”
NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said he’s seen a trend 
toward more dollars being spent on services versus goods—a 
shift supported by these data. “Consumers are spending on ser-
vices such as smartphone plans and on-demand streaming, and 
there’s some pent-up demand for vacations and entertainment 
in the form of movie tickets and eating out.”
However, “2016 was not expected to be very different from 
2015 in terms of economic growth,” Kleinhenz adds. “Overall 
consumer spending looks good, employment is solid, and there 
don’t appear to be any significant recession risks cropping up 
now. But that said, there are a number of underpinnings that 
need to be closely monitored. Consumer spending has varied in 
certain regions of the country. Changes in housing and health-
care continue to bear watching, as does the aging of the Baby 
Boomer generation and the rise of Millennials.”
Mash-Up
It is generally acknowledged that consumers’ propensity to 
spend varies by age, as do the types of products they purchase. 
Age-wise, Millennials are on the cusp of what experts deem to 
be the sweet-spot for spending—setting up homes, starting a 
family, and so on—but that’s just not typically been the reality.
Burdened by student debt, many in this age group spend 
money primarily on mobile devices and media content. They 
are champions of the sharing economy and sustainability, con-
tent to rent rather than own everything from special ­occasion 
apparel and jewelry to cars. The research aligns: 18- to 34- 
year-old respondents are more likely than any other group to

PART 2  •  COMPREHENSIVE CASE	
185	
consider on-demand video streaming untouchable—42 percent, 
compared with 29 percent of 35- to 54-year-olds. They also 
are less apt to give up their daily cup of gourmet coffee, their 
gym membership, and their costume jewelry as compared with 
other adults.
“Millennials are now the largest generation of potential 
shoppers and they have certain traits that are shaping their buy-
ing habits. They’ve lived through the Great Recession and it 
has had an effect on them: They tend to be frugal,” says Paula 
Rosenblum, co-founder and managing partner at RSR Research. 
“If you ask them if purchasing jeans is expendable, they’ll say 
‘Sure,’ because they can buy another pair from H&M for $20. 
This generation has grown up with fast fashion; and when you 
are buying from those types of retailers, everything becomes 
expendable.”
Rosenblum is quick to point out that although Millenni-
als may be frugal, they are interested in quality, as exemplified 
by their desire to have the latest smartphone and a willing-
ness to invest in items that inspire and speak to their social 
­consciousness. “Part of the reason why department stores 
and some specialty retailers are in a world of hurt is because 
­Millennials don’t want to go into stores and wander; and they 
definitely don’t want to wear logos emblazoned on their chest. 
They favor curated assortments that are in line with who they 
are.” As a result, some long-established retailers “are going to 
have to find a way to reinvent themselves if they expect to return 
to relevancy,” states Rosenblum.
Older and Wiser?
Baby Boomers and beyond are obviously in a somewhat dif-
ferent frame of mind when it comes to determining what’s 
expendable and untouchable. Having spent years amassing 
stuff, they’d prefer to spend money on an experience. Organic 
and gourmet foods are off the table for the 55 and older crowd, 
with 87 and 93 percent checking the expendable box on these 
potential purchases, respectively. And although this age group 
is a target market for the makers of anti-aging products, a 
commanding 92 percent say they can live without high-end 
cosmetics.
There is a silver lining: Among consumers age 55 and 
older, 45 percent designate charitable contributions as untouch-
able. When they dine out, they tend to favor casual sit-down 
restaurants such as Applebee’s, TGI Friday’s, and Ruby Tues-
day. (It helps that some of these places offer special senior dis-
counts.) This age group is also more inclined than any other to 
consider their vacations to be something they can’t live without. 
That’s not surprising when you consider how spread out fami-
lies tend to be today; traveling is one way to reconnect with the 
grandkids.
Older consumers are in sync with the younger generation 
when it comes to Internet service. In fact, 87 percent cite their 
connection as untouchable, which might have something to 
with live chatting with grandkids and monitoring retirement 
funds. However, 62 percent of older consumers say that basic 
cable television is something they can’t live without (while 
many ­Millennials are turning to streaming media for their enter-
tainment, sports, etc.); 33 percent have the same feeling for 
premium cable or satellite television. It appears that once you 
reach age 55, the lion’s share of entertainment takes place in the 
living room recliner, remote in hand—83 percent of these con-
sumers deem movie/theater tickets to be expendable for them.
Tracking Trends
Digging into the research by household income and gender 
yields interesting insights. Among consumers with a house-
hold income of $150,000 or more, 53 percent indicate that hav-
ing their hair cut or colored is an untouchable item—a greater 
­percentage than any other income or age group; 21 percent say 
maid service is untouchable; and 22 percent feel the same way 
about lawn care service. One might expect that more affluent 
consumers would be further inclined to consider fine dining 
untouchable, but that’s not the case. Their propensity to spend 
on fine dining is actually on par with other income segments; 
they also don’t show a particular proclivity for shopping at 
department or specialty stores. See Table 4.
The one category that stands out among this income group 
is the vacation. On average, 34 percent of all respondents con-
sider it to be untouchable; the percentage jumps to 36 percent

PART 2  •  SITUATION ANALYSIS
feel they’ve become more practical and realistic in their pur-
chases; and 46 percent indicate that they focus more on what 
they need rather than what they want. That’s in sharp contrast 
to how men responded; 33 percent say they’ve become more 
practical and 34 percent focus more on needs than wants.
The challenge for retailers is trying to make sense of all of 
these data and make the most of this moment in time. Reading 
between the lines, it’s clear that regardless of age, income, or 
gender, consumers do not appear to have strong ties to stores 
or brands compared to the past. They’re looking for value and 
they take some pride in being thrifty—except when they’re 
upgrading their smartphone, in which case, all budget bets 
are off.
Questions
1.	 Differentiate between expendable and untouchable shop-
ping. Why is this distinction important to retailers?
2.	 As an independent jewelry retailer, what could you learn 
from Table 1? How should you adapt to this?
3.	 Do you think that the revenues of retail cooperatives will go 
up during weak economic times and decline during strong 
economic times? Explain your answer.
4.	 Relate the discussion in this case to the wheel of retailing 
and scrambled merchandising highlighted in Chapter 5.
5.	 Are the research data reported in this case good and/or bad 
for specialty retailers? Explain your answer.
6.	 Present an omnichannel retailing strategy for a retailer of 
your choosing based on the information in this case.
7.	 Are the research data reported in this case good and/or bad 
for online retailers? Explain your answer. As an airport 
retailer, what could you learn from this case? How should 
you adapt to this information?
for the 55-and-older group, but for those with a household 
income of $150,000 and up, 50 percent refuse to give up their 
vacation time. Perhaps the most telling indicator of how well-
heeled consumers are feeling about spending in the near future 
is the feedback provided to the question, “Have you cut back 
on any of the items [included in the survey]?” Slightly more 
than 7 out of every 10 respondents (71 percent) answered “no.”
Gender Trends
The differences between men’s and women’s perception of 
what’s expendable or untouchable are generally not dramatic, 
but they can be eye-opening: 16 percent of men consider gour-
met food untouchable; only 11 percent of women feel the same 
way. Then again, it would be interesting to determine how each 
defines “gourmet.” Nearly 40 percent of men cite a haircut as 
untouchable; among women, 45 percent say taking care of their 
hair is something they’re not willing to forego. Women are more 
inclined to feel that charitable contributions are untouchable; 
men are more likely to consider a new pair of jeans to be an 
item they can’t live without.
The research provides a curious snapshot of gender dif-
ferences when it comes to dining outside the home. Men and 
women are on the same page regarding eating at fast-casual 
restaurants such as Panera Bread; but men are more likely to 
view both fine dining and casual sit-down establishments such 
as Applebee’s as untouchable. When it comes to fast food, 
71 percent of women feel it’s expendable. Men are not quite as 
willing to give up their Big Mac and fries; 34 percent say there’s 
no way they’ll give up their fast-food fix.
Some of the greatest discrepancies between men and 
women are apparent in the responses provided when asked 
about changes they’ve made recently. Nearly 4 in 10 women 

In Part Three, we first present various key concepts for retailers to 
better identify and understand consumers and develop an appropriate target market plan. 
Information-gathering methods—which can be used in identifying and understanding 
consumers as well as in developing and implementing a retail strategy—are then described.
Chapter 7 discusses many influences on retail shoppers: demographics, lifestyles, needs 
and desires, shopping attitudes and behavior, retailer actions that influence shopping, and 
environmental factors. We place these elements within a target marketing framework because 
it is critical for retailers to recognize what makes their customers and potential customers 
tick—and to act accordingly.
Chapter 8 deals with information gathering and processing in retailing. We first consider 
the information flows in a retail distribution channel and review the difficulties that may 
arise from basing a retail strategy on inadequate information. Then we examine in depth the 
retail information system, its components, and recent advances in information systems—with 
particular emphasis on data warehousing and data mining. The last part of the chapter describes 
the marketing research process.

Objectives
1. To discuss why it is 
important for a retailer 
to properly identify, 
understand, and appeal 
to its customers
2. To enumerate and 
describe a number of 
consumer demographics, 
lifestyle factors, and 
needs and desires—and 
to explain how these 
concepts can be applied 
to retailing
3. To examine consumer 
attitudes toward 
shopping and consumer 
shopping behavior, 
including the consumer 
decision process and its 
stages
4. To look at retailer 
actions based on target-
market planning
5. To note some of the 
environmental factors 
that affect consumer 
shopping
Identifying the characteristics of their customers and understanding their behavior patterns are 
vital tasks for retailers to be able to devise and implement the correct strategy and tactics. As 
digital technologies increasingly influence higher proportions of consumer purchase decisions 
online and in-store, retailers have the opportunity to collect and analyze significant amounts of 
data on customer opinions, preferences, and choices at every interaction. They can harness the 
data deluge to derive actionable insights, make better decisions, and take the right action at 
the right place at the right time.
How fast is the online tide, in terms of retailer and customer usage, rising for food items? 
Does that translate to a mushrooming online grocery business? The answer: It depends. New 
research from a company called Brick Meets Click, released in mid-2016, finds that consumers 
are rapidly making online grocery shopping part of their routine. One in five consumers is now 
an active user of online grocery services, with “active” users spending an average of 16 percent 
of their weekly grocery dollars online. The company also reports that 21 percent of surveyed 
shoppers bought groceries online in the preceding month—up from 11 percent in 2013.

Among the competitors in this area are Amazon Fresh, Fresh Direct, Net Grocer, and Peapod. 
Although they differ in their approach, each enables shoppers to choose from a personalized 
Web site that facilitates the reordering of merchandise on a week-to-week basis. They also 
promise delivery within a 1- to 2-hour delivery window.
Steven Pinder, a retail strategist at Kurt Salmon, is more skeptical about future growth in 
online groceries. He acknowledges its foothold in urban markets, but Pinder feels adoption 
rates are slowing. “Bottom line: No one has figured out how to address some of the major 
inhibitors with online grocery,” he says. “Shoppers still can’t test the fruit, substitutions are 
clunky, and shelf in-stocks are problematic.”1
Overview
The success of a retail strategy depends on how well a firm identifies and understands its ­customers 
and how well it forms a strategy mix to appeal to them. This entails identifying consumer char-
acteristics, needs, and attitudes; recognizing how people make decisions; and then devising the 
proper target-market plan. See Figure 7-1. It also means studying environmental factors that affect 
decisions. Consider this:
Today’s consumers are more empowered than ever before. They have numerous options 
with regard to when they shop, where they shop, and how they go about shopping. As a result, 
consumers now have higher expectations about the retailers with which they do business. In such 
a competitive environment, retailers must better understand and service their customers.
In this chapter, we explore—from a retailing perspective—the impact on shoppers of each of 
the elements shown in Figure 7-2: demographics, lifestyles, needs and desires, shopping attitudes 
FIGURE 7-1

Good retailers realize 
that customers (and

to the needs and desires 
of a specific group of

and behavior, retailer actions that influence shopping, and environmental factors. We also look at 
the impact of digital/mobile advances. By studying these elements, a retailer can devise the best 
possible target-market plan and do so in the context of its overall strategy.
Please note: We use consumer, customer, and shopper interchangeably in this chapter.
CONSUMER DEMOGRAPHICS AND LIFESTYLES
Demographics are objective, quantifiable, easily identifiable, and measurable population data. 
Lifestyles are ways in which individual consumers and families (households) live and spend time 
and money. Visit our Web site (www.bermanevansretail.com) for posts on these topics.
Consumer Demographics
Consumers, both as groups and as individuals, can be identified by such demographics as gender, 
age, population growth rate, life expectancy, literacy, language spoken, household size, marital 
and family status, income, retail sales, mobility, place of residence, occupation, education, and 
ethnic/racial background. These factors affect retail shopping and retailer actions.
A retailer should have some knowledge of overall trends, as well as the demographics of its 
own target market. Table 7-1 indicates broad demographics for 10 nations around the world, and 
Table 7-2 shows U.S. demographics by region. Regional data are useful since most retailers are 
local and regional.
In understanding U.S. demographics, it is helpful to know these facts:
▶
▶The typical household has an annual income of $54,000, according to the Federal Reserve. 
The top one-fifth of households earns approximately $100,000 or more; the lowest one-fifth 
earns approximately $20,000 or less.2 If income is high, people are apt to have discretionary 
income—money left after paying taxes and buying necessities.
▶
▶About 12 percent of people move each year; two-thirds of all moves are in the same county.
▶
▶There are about 6.5 million more U.S. females than males; 57 percent of adult females are 
in the labor force.3
▶
▶Most U.S. employment is in services. In addition, there are now more professionals and 
white-collar workers than before and fewer blue-collar and agricultural workers.
▶
▶Approximately 32 percent of all U.S. adults age 25 and older have at least a 4-year college 
degree.4
▶
▶The population comprises many ethnic and racial groups. African Americans, Hispanic 
­Americans, and Asian Americans account for one-third of U.S. residents—a steadily rising 
figure. Each of these groups represents a large potential target market; their total annual 
­buying power is more than $3.4 trillion.5

Part 3  •  Targeting Customers and Gathering Information
Because most retailers are local or operate in only part of a region, they must compile data about 
the people living in their trading areas and those most apt to shop there. For a given business and 
location, the characteristics of the target market (the customer group to be sought by the retailer) 
can be studied on the basis of some combination of these demographic factors—and a retail 
strategy planned accordingly:
▶
▶Market size. How many people are in the potential target market?
▶
▶Gender. Is the potential target market more male or female, or are they equal  
in proportion?
▶
▶Age. What are the prime age groups to which the retailer wants to appeal?
▶
▶Household size. What is the average household size of potential consumers?
▶
▶Marital and family status. Are potential consumers single or married? Do families have 
children?
▶
▶Income. Is the potential target market lower income, middle income, or upper income? Is 
discretionary income available for luxury purchases?
▶
▶Retail sales. What is the area’s sales forecast for the retailer’s goods/services category?
▶
▶Birthrate. How important is the birthrate for the retailer’s goods/services category?
▶
▶Mobility. What percent of the potential target market moves into and out of the trading area 
yearly?
▶
▶Where people live. How large is the trading area from which potential customers can be 
drawn?
▶
▶Employment status. Does the potential target market include working women?
▶
▶Occupation. In what industries and occupations are people in the area working? Are they 
professionals, office workers, or of some other designation?
▶
▶Education. Are potential customers college educated?
▶
▶Ethnic/racial background. Does the potential target market cover a distinctive racial or ethnic 
group?
Consumer Lifestyles
Consumer lifestyles are based on social and psychological factors and are influenced by demo-
graphics. As with demographics, a retailer should first have some knowledge of consumer lifestyle 
concepts and then determine the lifestyle attributes of its own target market.
These social factors are useful in identifying and understanding consumer lifestyles.
▶
▶A culture is a distinctive heritage shared by a group of people that passes on a series of beliefs, 
norms, and customs. The U.S. culture stresses individuality, success, education, and material 
comfort; there are also various subcultures (such as African-, Asian-, and Hispanic-Americans) 
due to the many countries from which residents have come.
▶
▶Social class involves an informal ranking of people based on income, occupation, education, 
and other factors. People often have similar values in each social class.
▶
▶Reference groups, of which there are several types, influence people’s thoughts and behav-
ior. For example, a group that someone wishes she or he belonged to but does not is called 
an aspirational group; a group that a person does belong to is referred to as a membership 
group; and a dissociative group is one in which a person belongs but wishes he or she did not. 
Great Britain’s Customer 
Insight Magazine (www 
.customer-insight.co.uk) 
provides a good perspective 
on emerging consumer 
trends.
In domestic markets, retailers have had to adapt to changes 
in demographics. Tradition target groups have aged, and new 
groups have developed. Music, fashion, luxury goods, and 
health products are all examples of rapidly changing mar-
kets. Proportions of gender, race, religion, and ethnicity are 
constantly changing and need to be addressed for the retailer 
to thrive. These constant changes and adaptations have made 
some of the more established retailers better placed to cater 
for a global market. Other older retailers have floundered and 
failed overseas.
Why might some retailers succeed and other fail to under-
stand the importance of demographics?

Face-to-face groups, such as families, have the most impact. In reference groups are opinion 
leaders whose views are respected and sought.
▶
▶The family life cycle describes how a traditional family moves from bachelorhood to children 
to solitary retirement. At each stage, attitudes, needs, purchases, and income change. Retailers 
must also be alert to the many adults who never marry, divorced adults, single-parent families, 
and childless couples. The household life cycle incorporates life stages for both family and 
nonfamily households.
▶
▶Time utilization refers to activities in which a person engages and the time allocated to them. The 
broad categories are work, transportation, eating, recreation, entertainment, parenting, sleeping, 
and (retailers hope) shopping. Today, the number of dual-earner households continues to increase; 
many people have multiple jobs to maintain the rise in standards of living. This affects retailers in 
that consumers have less discretionary time and therefore allocate less time to shopping.
These psychological factors help in identifying and understanding consumer lifestyles:
▶
▶A personality is the sum total of an individual’s traits, which make that individual unique. 
Traits include a person’s level of self-confidence, innovativeness, autonomy, sociability, emo-
tional stability, and assertiveness.
▶
▶Class consciousness is the extent to which a person desires and pursues social status. It helps 
determine the use of reference groups and the importance of prestige purchases. A class-
conscious person values the status of goods, services, and retailers.
▶
▶Attitudes (opinions) are the positive, neutral, or negative feelings a person has about differ-
ent topics. Attitudes are also feelings consumers have about a given retailer and its activities. 
Does the consumer feel a retailer is desirable, unique, and fairly priced?
▶
▶Perceived risk is the level of risk a consumer believes exists regarding the purchase of a 
specific good or service from a given retailer, whether or not the belief is correct. There are 
six types: functional (Will a good or service perform well?); physical (Can a good or service 
hurt me?); financial (Can I afford it?); social (What will peers think of my shopping here?); 
psychological (Am I doing the right thing?); and time (How much shopping effort is needed?). 
Perceived risk is high if a retailer or its brands are new, a person is on a budget or has little 
experience, there are many choices, and an item is socially visible or complex. See Figure 7-3.  
Firms can reduce perceived risk with information.
▶
▶The importance of a purchase to the consumer affects the amount of time he or she will 
spend to make a decision and the range of alternatives considered. If a purchase is important, 
perceived risk tends to be higher, and the retailer must adapt to this.

Part 3  •  Targeting Customers and Gathering Information
A retailer can develop a lifestyle profile of its target market by answering these questions and 
then using the answers in developing its strategy:
▶
▶Culture: What values, norms, and customs are important to the potential target market?
▶
▶Social class: Are potential consumers lower, middle, or upper class? Are they socially mobile?
▶
▶Reference groups: To whom do people look for purchasing advice? Does this differ by good 
or service category? How can a firm target opinion leaders?
▶
▶Family (or household) life cycle: In what stage(s) of the cycle are most potential customers?
▶
▶Time utilization: How do people spend time? How do they feel about their shopping time?
▶
▶Personality: Do potential customers have identifiable personality traits?
▶
▶Class consciousness: Are potential consumers status-conscious? How does this affect purchases?
▶
▶Attitudes: How does the potential target market feel about the retailer and its offerings in 
terms of specific strategy components?
▶
▶Perceived risk: Do potential customers feel risk in connection with the retailer? Which goods 
and services have the greatest perceived risk?
▶
▶Importance of the purchase: How crucial are the goods/services offered to potential 
customers?
Retailing Implications of Consumer Demographics and Lifestyles
Demographic and lifestyle factors need to be considered from several perspectives. Here are some 
illustrations. By no means do the examples cover the full domain of retailing.
GENDER ROLES  The many working women who put in 60 to 70 hours or more each week between 
their job and home responsibilities have altered lifestyles. Compared with women who have not 
worked outside the home, they tend to be more self-confident and individualistic, more con-
cerned with convenience, more interested in sharing household tasks with spouses or significant 
­others, more knowledgeable and demanding, more interested in leisure activities and travel, more 
involved with self-improvement and education, more appearance-conscious, and more indifferent 
to small price differences among retailers. They are less interested in unhurried shopping.
Due to the number of working women, male lifestyles are also changing. More men now take 
care of their children, shop for food, do laundry, wash dishes, cook, vacuum, and clean the bath-
room. Male grocery and mass merchandise shoppers in the United States are steadily increasing, 
especially with Millennials.6 The generational shift from traditional roles is bolstered by mobile 
E-commerce and millennial men’s savviness with smartphones and shopping apps. In the future, 
there will be still more changes in men’s and women’s roles. The clout and duties of husbands and 
wives will be shared more often. Retailers need to appreciate this trend. See Figure 7-4.

CHAPTER 7  •  Identifying and Understanding Consumers	
195	
CONSUMER SOPHISTICATION AND CONFIDENCE  Many shoppers are now more knowledgeable 
and cosmopolitan; more aware of trends in tastes, styles, and goods and services; and more 
sophisticated. Nonconforming behavior is accepted when consumers are self-assured and better 
appreciate the available choices. Confident shoppers experiment more. For example, today, it may 
be considered an asset to be viewed as “cheap,” which to some shoppers means “smart.” Thus, for 
example, Ikea offers style at low prices, partly since consumers are responsible for self-assembly 
of the furniture they buy. Unlike other fashion-based apparel retailers, Zara has little in-store stock 
and updates its fashion apparel often. These combined strategies motivate Zara customers to visit 
its stores often. This also encourages shoppers to immediately buy an item since they fear that it 
may quickly sell out and not be available on subsequent store visits.7
POVERTY OF TIME  The increase in working women, the desire for personal fulfillment, the job 
commute, and the need for some people to have second jobs has led to many consumers feel-
ing time-pressured. Retailers can react to time-pressured consumers through various strategies. 
Included in those strategies are offering pre-wrapped gift items, store pick-up windows for pur-
chases ordered on the Web, home delivery of groceries ordered online, in-home delivery and instal-
lation of appliances (on one home visit), and longer store hours (including 24/7). See Figure 7-5.
COMPONENT LIFESTYLES  In the past, shoppers were typecast, based on demographics and life-
styles. It is widely recognized that shopping is less predictable and more individualistic now, and 
shopper profiling based traditional segmentation strategies may have low predictive ability for a 
majority of retailers. This shopping profile is more situation-based, hence, the term component 
lifestyle.

A commonality among car dealerships, home builders, and elec-
tronics retailers is the high profit they make on add-ons relative 
to the primary purchase. Car dealers earn more from financing, 
extended warranties, trade-ins, and upgrades (such as remote 
starters and alarm systems) than on the basic car. New home 
builders generate large profits on upgrades (appliances, doors, 
and kitchen cabinets). Electronics retailers often charge high 
prices for extended warranties, as well as batteries and cables. 
What disturbs many consumers is that although the price of a 
car, home, or laptop is transparent and heavily promoted in the 
ads and on Web sites, the price of ancillaries is often not listed. 
These customers want the price of add-ons to be transparent 
before the purchase.
How can a consumer minimize the issues with the sale of 
add-ons?
ETHICS IN RETAILING
Selling Add-Ons

Part 3  •  Targeting Customers and Gathering Information
So-called hybrid consumers are increasingly opting both to trade up to premium products for 
high-involvement, discretionary spending, and to trade down to budget options for low-involvement 
necessities in various product and service categories.8 Retailers with mid-priced alternatives are 
losing share in their polarized consumption basket. It becomes increasingly more complicated for 
retailers when consumers mix luxury and budget products within the same category. Why will they 
buy a luxury auto and then go to Costco for replacement tires? Why will they spend several dollars 
for coffee at Starbucks but feel $1.49 is too high for a fast-food hamburger? The rapid growth of 
store brands underscores how many retailers are responding by managing a brand portfolio that 
includes multiple value propositions, such as a generic, a standard, and a premium brand.
Consumer Profiles
Considerable research has been aimed at describing consumer profiles in a way that is useful for 
retailers. Here are three examples:
▶
▶Boston Proper is an online and catalog retailer that appeals to a customer group that is not well 
served. The retailer’s target market is women aged 35 to 60. It features Bohemian-inspired 
fashions as well as classy, casual, and sports apparel. When Chico’s acquired Boston Proper 
in 2011, the retailer operated online and through catalog sales exclusively. Under Chico’s 
leadership, Boston Proper launched its first stores in 2013 and now has 13 locations in Florida, 
Georgia, North Carolina, and Texas. Chico’s plans to open hundreds of Boston Proper stores 
throughout the United States.9
▶
▶About one-sixth of the people who live in the United States self-identify as Hispanic or 
Latino—up by 2.5 percent from 2010 to 2015, compared to the 2005 to 2010 figure of 
51 million people. Hispanic women will make up about 30 percent of the total U.S. female 
population by 2060. This group is especially important because it represents close to one-fifth 
of the total women’s fashion-based footwear market, according to research by NPD Group. 
One strategy used by retailers seeking to attract this market is to use Hispanic celebrities in 
product branding. Television star Sofia Vergara, on Forbes’s list of the wealthiest women, 
helped launch a product line for Kmart. Similarly, Latina singer Thalia was involved in a 
Macy’s brand launch.10
▶
▶Claritas Prizm segmentation system for marketing (owned by the Nielsen Company) divides 
American households into various lifestyle categories. These are the four wealthiest groups: (1) 
Upper crust—America’s wealthiest lifestyle consisting of opulent empty-nesting couples over 
the age of 50. (2) Networked neighbors—The nation’s second wealthiest lifestyles represent-
ing suburban wealth. This group embraces technology. (3) Movers and shakers—Dual-income 
couples who are highly educated, typically between the ages of 45 and 64. Many of these group 
members are business professionals. (4) Young digerati—Tech-savvy individuals who reside 
in fashionable urban neighborhoods and love trendy restaurants and clothing boutiques.11
CONSUMER NEEDS AND DESIRES
When deriving a target market profile, a retailer should identify key consumer needs and desires. 
To a retailer, needs are a person’s basic shopping requirements consistent with his or her present 
demographics and lifestyle. Desires are discretionary shopping goals that affect attitudes and behav-
ior. A person may need a new car to get to and from work, and he or she might seek a dealer with 
Saturday service hours. A person may desire a Porsche and a free loaner car when the vehicle is 
serviced but be satisfied with a Toyota that can be serviced on weekends and fits within a budget.
When a retail strategy aims to satisfy consumer needs and desires, it appeals to consumer 
motives, or the reasons for their behavior. These are just a few of the questions to resolve:
▶
▶How far will customers travel to get to the retailer? How important is convenience?
▶
▶What hours are desired? Are evening and weekend hours required?
▶
▶What level of customer services is preferred?
▶
▶How extensive a goods/service assortment is desired?
▶
▶What level of goods/service quality is preferred?
▶
▶How important is price?
▶
▶What retailer actions are necessary to reduce perceived risk?
▶
▶Do different market segments have special needs? If so, what are they?

CHAPTER 7  •  Identifying and Understanding Consumers	
197	
Let’s address the last question by looking at three particular market segments that attract retailer 
attention: in-home shoppers, online/mobile shoppers, and outshoppers.
1.	 In-Home Shopping: The in-home shopper is not always a captive audience. Shopping is often 
discretionary, not necessary. Convenience in ordering an item, without traveling for it, is 
important. These shoppers are often active store shoppers as well as affluent, well educated, 
self-confident, younger, and venturesome. They like in-store shopping but have low opinions 
of local shopping. Catalog shoppers have more flexible time requirements. In households 
with young children, in-home shopping is more likely if the woman works part time or not 
at all than full-time working mothers. In-home shoppers may be unable to comparison shop; 
may not be able to touch, feel, handle, or examine products firsthand; are concerned about 
service (such as returns); and may not have a salesperson to answer questions.
2.	 Online/Mobile Shopping: People who shop online are often well educated and have above-
average incomes (as stated in Chapter 6). As we noted earlier, online shopping encompasses 
more than just purchasing online. Using the Toys “R” Us Web site, shoppers can research 
items, check out prices, and place orders. Shoppers can have items shipped to them or can 
pick them up in-store. The retailer has two strong E-commerce Web sites: www.Toysrus.com 
and www.Babiesrus.com. These sites offer customers a large online choice of toys and baby 
products, provide free shipping on items costing $19 or more, and allow in-store pickup for 
online purchases. In addition to its Web sites, Toys “R” Us has over 1,600 company-operated 
stores and an additional 250 licensed stores in 39 countries and jurisdictions.12
3.	 Outshopping: Out-of-hometown shopping, outshopping, is important for both local and 
surrounding retailers. The former want to minimize this behavior, whereas the latter want to 
maximize it. Outshoppers are often young, members of a large family, and new to the com-
munity. Income and education vary by situation. Outshoppers differ in their lifestyles from 
those who patronize hometown stores. They enjoy fine foods, like to travel, are active, like to 
change stores, and read out-of-town newspapers. They also downplay hometown stores and 
compliment out-of-town stores. These are vital data for suburban shopping centers. Outshop-
pers have the same basic reasons for out-of-town shopping whether they reside in small or 
large communities—easy access, liberal credit, store diversity, product assortments, prices, 
the presence of large chains, entertainment facilities, customer services, and product quality.
SHOPPING ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOR
In this section, we look at people’s attitudes toward shopping, where they shop, and the way in 
which they make purchase decisions. The top of Table 7-3 shows how shoppers around the world 
say they would change their retail behavior if they needed to reduce their spending; the bottom 
of the table indicates how global shoppers say they would alter their behavior if they have extra 
money to spend. Notice the differences among people living in different regions of the world.
Attitudes toward Shopping
Research has been done on people’s attitudes and motivations toward shopping. Such attitudes 
have a big impact on the ways in which people act in a retail setting. Retailers must strive to turn 
around some negative perceptions that now exist. We will highlight some research findings here.
SHOPPING ENJOYMENT  Generally, people today do not enjoy shopping as much as they did 
before. However, some consumers enjoy shopping and consider it a pleasant experience. Consum-
ers who seek relaxation and/or fun while shopping may prefer goods and services associated with 
higher prices, such as national brands and popular department stores. Although research on the 
relationship between shopping enjoyment, time spent, and size in the context of physical stores 
has been ambiguous, perceived shopping enjoyment has a significant positive effect on Web visit 
duration and purchase conversion.
So, what does stimulate a pleasurable shopping experience—a challenge that retailers must 
address to increase share of wallet and loyalty? Customers derive shopping enjoyment from their 
assessment of accessibility and in-store atmospherics that include music, lighting, store design, 
window displays, visual merchandising, and personnel. Drivers of shopping enjoyment differ by 
gender—men seek fast, efficient shopping, whereas women often prefer a relaxing atmosphere. In 
the online retailing environment, use of 3D virtual models, close-up pictures, zoom-in functions, 
and mix-and-match capabilities enhance the online shopping experience.13

Part 3  •  Targeting Customers and Gathering Information
ATTITUDES TOWARD SHOPPING TIME  Time pressure and emergency purchase situations are 
important situational influences that impact retail shopping enjoyment and outcomes. Demo-
graphic changes, including the high proportion of dual-income households and the increase in the 
number of earners managing multiple jobs due to wage stagnation, have contributed to chronic 
time pressure. Research shows that shoppers are task-oriented, under time pressure, and likely to 
rely on economic cues such as unit-price data in making product selections.14 Further, retail assort-
ment size and complexity can create perceived time pressure when shopping online or in-store. 
Retailers have often increased their assortments to keep up with changing customer trends and 
face the challenging tradeoff of whether “more is better” or “less is better” in terms of assortments. 
Thus, retailers should not only invest more in store atmospherics (such as music, color, lighting, 
smell, and visual merchandising) but also pay equal attention to the efficiency of store location, 
parking, and sales personnel assistance that may reduce shoppers’ chronic time pressure.”15
CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM AND DISPARITY IN WEALTH EFFECT  There is a disparity in wealth across 
income tiers. Higher-income consumers are more likely to own stocks; and when their investments 
gain, they spend more at luxury retailers. Lower-income consumers are less likely to own stocks 
and the lack of wage growth means that they haven’t seen any improvement in their financial 
standing over the last several years. For them, memories of the recession linger, which has led to 
more cautionary spending habits and the propensity to save the extra cash from lower mortgage 
and energy costs. These consumers have traded down to less expensive brands and shop more at 
discount stores to secure the most value for their dollar; sometimes, they postpone or forgo discre-
tionary big-ticket items. This has led to bifurcated retailing, with high-end and low-end retailers 
doing better than middle-of-the road retailers.16
WHY PEOPLE BUY OR DO NOT BUY ON A SHOPPING TRIP  It is critical for retailers to determine 
why shoppers leave without making a purchase. Some consumers at online stores place items in 
their virtual shopping carts but later abandon them, which can lead to lost sales for high-demand, 
fast-fashion products.17 Research on shopper behavior indicates that shopping goals determine 
the consumer’s retail journey through both physical and online stores. Shopping goals differ

across consumers and across shopping occasions for each consumer based on the complexity 
of product purchase, as well as the time horizon within which the purchase decision needs to 
be made. On some shopping trips, consumers might conduct a goal-directed search to browse 
and collect information; whereas on other occasions, they might compare items and complete 
the purchase. On yet other shopping occasions, they might just enjoy experiential browsing or 
window shopping. Consumers’ shopping goals may also change in response to the shopping 
environment such as product presentations or demonstrations, sensory stimuli such as smell or 
music,18 prices, promotions, salesperson interaction, and the behavior of other shoppers in the 
store.
ATTITUDES BY MARKET SEGMENT  There is considerable academic and commercial research on 
shopper segmentation. Researchers have segmented shoppers in terms of consumer characteristics 
(geo-demographics and psychographics), purchase quantity/variety/frequency, promotion sensitiv-
ity and usage, search behavior, shopping values, multichannel usage behavior, and post-purchase 
behavior.19 One recent study, examining “smart” shopping activities, identified three smart grocery 
shopper segments: involved, spontaneous, and apathetic.
Involved shoppers are apt to be Baby Boomers and prioritize saving time and effort, be 
attracted by retailers that provide good product assortment and price-saving opportunities in 
the form of sales, coupons, or bulk pricing. They spend more time planning stores to visit, but 
engage in minimal information search on products and brand alternatives, hence in-store pur-
chase activities of hedonic value (sampling, in-store café) are essential. Spontaneous shoppers 
are primarily Baby Boomers and least likely to engage in pre-purchase planning and information 
search, but they care more about saving time and effort than apathetic shoppers. The majority 
of apathetic shoppers are Generation Xers, those less likely to be time conscious and more 
likely to have a low marketplace knowledge. This group holds the inherent belief that they are 
smart shoppers. Although they are most likely to engage in online pre-purchase information 
search than the other segments, they are price-conscious but do not plan or respond to in-store 
promotional stimuli.
ATTITUDES TOWARD PRIVATE BRANDS  Many consumers believe private (retailer) brands 
are as good as or better than manufacturer brands. Private label dollar-based market shares 
exceed one-sixth of U.S. and Canadian revenues. Although these market shares are less 
than in Western Europe (where private-label sales are over 30 percent), the majority of  
American and Canadian consumers have positive perceptions of private-label goods: 75 per-
cent of Americans and 73 percent of Canadians view private-label products as a good alterna-
tive to national brands; 74 percent of Americans and 66 percent of Canadians state they are a 
good value; and 67 percent of Americans and 61 percent of Canadians feel they are at parity 
with national brands on quality.20
Where People Shop
Consumer patronage differs sharply by type of retailer. Thus, it is vital for firms to recognize the 
venues where consumers are most likely to shop and plan accordingly.
Many consumers do cross-shopping, whereby they (1) shop for a product category at more 
than one retail format during the year or (2) visit multiple retailers on one shopping trip. The first 
scenario occurs because these consumers feel comfortable shopping at different formats during 
the year, their goals vary by occasion (they may want bargains on everyday clothes and fashion-
able items for weekend wear), they shop wherever sales are offered, and they have a favorite 
format for themselves and another one for other household members. Visiting multiple outlets 
on one trip occurs because consumers want to save travel and shopping time. The increased use 
of retail apps on mobile phones during in-store shopping induces more cross-shopping as retailers 
compete to deploy geo-targeted promotions that activate at competitors’ stores, which attracts 
people to visit competitors’ stores. According to a survey by the National Retail Federation, the 
most planned activity for smartphone users is researching products and comparing prices  
(38 percent of smartphone owners). The second most planned activity on smartphones (28 percent 
of smartphone owners) is looking up information, such as location, store hours, and 
directions.21
Why do some people shop 
at both upscale Tiffany 
(www.tiffany.com) and at 
a membership club such as 
BJ’s (www.bjs.com)?

200 
Part 3  •  Targeting Customers and Gathering Information
Here are some cross-shopping examples:
▶
▶Some supermarket customers also regularly buy items carried by the supermarket at conve-
nience stores, full-line department stores, drugstores, and specialty food stores.
▶
▶Some department-store customers also regularly buy items carried by the department store 
at factory outlets and full-line discount stores.
▶
▶The majority of Web shoppers also buy from catalog retailers, mass merchants, apparel 
chains, and/or department stores.
▶
▶Cross-shopping is high for apparel, home furnishings, shoes, sporting goods, personal-care 
items, and motor fuel. Table 7-4 shows cross-shopping for motor fuel purchases.
The Consumer Decision Process
Besides identifying target market traits, a retailer should know how people make decisions. This 
requires familiarity with consumer behavior, which is the process by which people determine 
whether, what, when, where, how, from whom, and how often to purchase goods and services. 
Such behavior is influenced by a person’s background and traits.
The decision process must be grasped from two different perspectives: (1) what good or 
service the consumer is thinking about buying and (2) where the consumer is going to buy that 
item (if the person opts to buy). A consumer can make these decisions separately or jointly. If 
made jointly, she or he relies on the retailer for support (information, assortments, and informed 
sales personnel) over the full decision process. If the decisions are made independently—what to 
buy versus where to buy—the person gathers information and advice before visiting a retailer and 
views the retailer merely as a place to buy (and probably more interchangeable with other firms).

Those with superior analytical skills and degrees (in marketing, 
market research, statistics, or the social sciences) sometimes seek 
positions in marketing research at major retailers and at mar-
ket research consulting firms. Retail chains and franchises often 
have their own market research staffs. Research studies involving 
consumer behavior may be done continually or one-time occa-
sions. ­Continual studies may focus on customer satisfaction, sales 
forecasts, and loyalty program tracking. One-time studies involve 
research on strategies to solve problems (such as poor sales) and/
or to assess opportunities (national or global expansion plans). 
Examples include store layout planning to maximize sales poten-
tial, real-estate site selection, and private-label brand recognition.
What are the pros and cons of a retailer’s conducting con-
sumer research in-house versus outsourcing these activities?

CHAPTER 7  •  Identifying and Understanding Consumers	
201	
In choosing whether or not to buy a given item (what), the consumer considers features, durability, 
distinctiveness, value, ease of use, and so on. In choosing the retailer to patronize for that item (where), 
the consumer considers location, assortment, credit availability, sales help, hours, customer service, 
and so on. Thus, the manufacturer and retailer have distinct challenges: The manufacturer wants people 
to buy its brand what) at any location carrying it (where). The retailer wants people to buy the product, 
not necessarily the manufacturer’s brand (what), at its store or nonstore location (where).
The consumer decision process has two parts: the process itself and the factors affecting 
the process. There are six steps in the process: stimulus, problem awareness, information search, 
evaluation of alternatives, purchase, and post-purchase behavior. The consumer’s demographics 
and lifestyle affect the process. The complete process is shown in Figure 7-6.
The best retailers assist shoppers at each stage in the process: stimulus (online ads), problem 
awareness (stocking new models), information search (point-of-sale displays and good sales-
people), evaluation of alternatives (noticeable differences among products), purchase (acceptance 
of credit cards), and post-purchase behavior (extended warranties and money-back returns). The 
greater the role a retailer assumes in the decision process, the more loyal the consumer will be.
Each time a person buys a good or service, he or she goes through a decision process. In 
some cases, all six steps in the process are utilized; in others, only a few steps are employed. For 
example, a consumer who has previously and satisfactorily bought luggage at a local store may 
not use the same extensive process as one who has never bought luggage.
The decision process outlined in Figure 7-6 assumes that the end result is a purchase. How-
ever, at any point, a potential customer may decide not to buy; the process then stops. A good or 
service may be unneeded, unsatisfactory, or too expensive. Before discussing the ways in which 
retail consumers use the decision process, we explain the entire process.
Stimulus. A stimulus is a cue (social or commercial) or a drive (physical) meant to motivate or 
arouse a person to act. When a person talks with friends, fellow employees, and others, a social cue 
is received. The special attribute of a social cue is that it involves an interpersonal, noncommercial 
source. A commercial cue is a message sponsored by a retailer or some other seller. Ads, sales 
pitches, and store displays are commercial stimuli. Such cues may not be regarded as highly as social 
ones by consumers because they are seller-controlled. A third type of stimulus is a physical drive. It 
occurs when one or more of a person’s physical senses are affected. Hunger, thirst, cold, heat, pain, 
or fear could cause a physical drive. A potential consumer may be exposed to any or all three types 
of stimuli. If aroused (motivated), he or she goes to the next step in the process. If a person is not 
sufficiently aroused, the stimulus is ignored—terminating the process for the given good or service.
Problem awareness. At problem awareness, the consumer not only has been aroused by 
social, commercial, and/or physical stimuli but she or he also recognizes that the good or service

under consideration may solve a problem of shortage or unfulfilled desire. It may be hard to learn 
why a person is motivated to move from stimulus to problem awareness. Many people shop with 
the same retailer or buy the same good or service for different reasons; they may not know their own 
motivation, and they may not tell a retailer their reasons for shopping there or buying a certain item.
Recognition of shortage occurs when a person discovers a good or service should be repur-
chased. A good could wear down beyond repair, or the person might run out of an item such as 
milk. Service may be necessary if a good (such as a car) requires a repair. Recognition of unful-
filled desire takes place when a person becomes aware of a good or service that has not been 
bought before or a retailer that has not been patronized before. An item (such as contact lenses) 
may improve a person’s lifestyle or self-image in an untried manner, or it may offer new features 
(such as a voice-activated laptop). People are more hesitant to act on unfulfilled desires. Risks 
and benefits may be tougher to see. When a person becomes aware of a shortage or an unfulfilled 
desire, he or she acts only if it is a problem worth solving. Otherwise, the process ends.
Information search. If problem awareness merits further thought, information is sought. An 
information search has two parts: (1) determining the alternatives that will solve the problem at 
hand (and where they can be bought) and (2) ascertaining the characteristics of each alternative.
First, the person compiles a list of goods or services that address the shortage or desire being con-
sidered. This list does not have to be formal. It may be a group of alternatives the person thinks about. 
A person with a lot of purchase experience normally uses an internal memory search to determine the 
goods or services—and retailers—that are satisfactory. A person with little purchase experience often 
uses an external search to develop a list of alternatives and retailers. This search can involve commer-
cial sources such as retail salespeople, noncommercial sources such as Consumer Reports, and social 
sources such as friends. Second, the person gathers information about each alternative’s attributes. An 
experienced shopper searches his or her memory for the attributes (pros and cons) of each alternative. 
A consumer with little experience or a lot of uncertainty searches externally for information.
The extent of an information search depends, in part, on the consumer’s perceived risk regarding 
a specific good or service. Risk varies among individuals and by situation. For some, it is inconse-
quential; for others, it is important. The retailer’s role is to provide enough information for a shopper 
to feel comfortable in making decisions, thus reducing perceived risk. Point-of-purchase ads, product 
displays, and knowledgeable sales personnel can provide consumers with the information they need.
When the consumer’s search for information is completed, she or he must decide whether 
a current shortage or unfulfilled desire can be met by any of the alternatives. If one or more are 
satisfactory, the consumer moves to the next step in the decision process. The consumer stops the 
process if no satisfactory goods or services are found.
Evaluation of alternatives. Next, a person selects one option. This is easy if one alternative is 
better on all features. An item with great quality and a low price is a certain pick over expensive, 
average-quality ones. Yet, a choice may not be that simple, and the person then does an evalua-
tion of alternatives before making a decision. If two or more options seem attractive, the person 
sets the criteria to evaluate and their importance. Alternatives are ranked and a choice is made.
The criteria for a decision are those good or service attributes considered relevant. They may 
include price, quality, fit, durability, and so on. The person sets standards for these characteristics 
and rates each alternative according to its ability to meet them. The importance of each criterion is 
also set, and attributes are often of differing importance to each person. One person may consider 
price as most important while another places more weight on quality and durability.
At this point, the person ranks alternatives from most favorite to least favorite and selects 
one. Sometimes, it is hard to rate attributes because they are technical, intangible, new, or poorly 
labeled. When this occurs, shoppers often use price, brand name, or store name to indicate quality 
and choose based on this criterion. After a person ranks alternatives, he or she chooses the most 
satisfactory one. In situations where no alternative is adequate, a decision not to buy is made.
Purchase act. A person is now ready for the purchase act—an exchange of money or a 
promise to pay for the ownership or use of a good or service. Important decisions are still made 
in this step. For a retailer, the purchase act may be the most crucial aspect of the decision process 
because the consumer is mainly concerned with three factors, as highlighted in Figure 7-7:
1.	 Place of purchase: This may be a store or a nonstore location. Many more items are bought 
at stores than through nonstore retailing, although the latter method is growing quickly. The 
place of purchase is evaluated in the same way as the good or the service: alternatives are 
listed, their traits are defined, and they are ranked. The most desirable place is then chosen.

CHAPTER 7  •  Identifying and Understanding Consumers

Criteria for selecting a store retailer include store location, store layout, service, sales help, 
store image, and prices. Criteria for selecting a nonstore retailer include image, service, 
prices, hours, interactivity, and convenience. A consumer will shop with the firm that has the 
best combination of criteria, as defined by that consumer.
2.	 Purchase terms: These include the price and method of payment. Price is the dollar amount 
a person must pay to achieve the ownership or use of a good or service. Method of payment 
is the way the price may be paid (cash, short-term credit, long-term credit).
3.	 Availability: This relates to stock on hand and delivery. Stock on hand is the amount of an 
item that a place of purchase has in stock. Delivery is the time span between placing an order 
and receiving an item and the ease with which an item is transported to its place of use.
If a person is pleased with all aspects of the purchase act, the good or service is bought. If 
there is dissatisfaction with the place of purchase, the terms of purchase, or availability, the con-
sumer may not buy, although she or he may be satisfied with the item itself.
Post-purchase behavior. After buying a good or service, a consumer may engage in post-
purchase behavior, which falls into either of two categories: further purchases or re-evaluation. 
Sometimes, buying one item leads to further purchases and decision making continues until the 
last purchase. A car purchase leads to insurance; a retailer using scrambled merchandising may 
stimulate a shopper to further purchase after the primary good or service is bought.
A person may also re-evaluate a purchase. Is performance as promised? Do actual attributes 
match the expectations the consumer had? Has the retailer acted as expected? Satisfaction typi-
cally leads to contentment, a repurchase when a good or service wears out, and positive ratings to 
friends. Dissatisfaction may lead to unhappiness, brand or store switching, and unfavorable conversa-
tions with friends and negative online postings. The latter situation (dissatisfaction) may result from 
­cognitive dissonance—doubt that the correct decision has been made. A consumer may regret that 
the purchase was made at all or may wish that another choice had been made. To overcome cognitive 
dissonance and dissatisfaction, the retailer must realize that the decision process does not end with a 
purchase. After-care (by phone, a service visit, or E-mail) may be as important as anything a retailer 
does to complete the sale. When items are expensive or important, after-care takes on greater signifi-
cance because the person really wants to be right. Also, the more alternatives from which to choose, 
the greater the doubt after a decision is made and the more important the after-care. Department stores 
pioneered money-back guarantees so customers could return items if cognitive dissonance occurred.
Realistic sales presentations and ad campaigns reduce post-sale dissatisfaction because con-
sumer expectations do not then exceed reality. If overly high expectations are created, a consumer 
is more apt to be unhappy because performance is not at the level promised. Combining an honest 
sales presentation with good customer after-care reduces or eliminates cognitive dissonance and 
dissatisfaction.
Types of Consumer Decision Making
Every time a person buys a good or service or visits a retailer, she or he uses a form of the deci-
sion process. The process is often undertaken subconsciously, and a person is not aware of its 
use. Also, as was shown in Figure 7-6, the process is affected by consumer characteristics. Older

Part 3  •  Targeting Customers and Gathering Information
people may not spend as much time as younger ones in making some decisions due to experience. 
Well-educated consumers may consult many information sources—increasingly, the Web—before 
making a decision. Upper-income consumers may spend less time deciding because they can 
afford to buy again if they are dissatisfied. In a family with children, each member may have input 
into a decision, which lengthens the process. Class-conscious shoppers may be interested in social 
sources, including social media. Consumers with low self-esteem or high perceived risk may use 
all the steps in detail. People under time pressure may skip steps to save time.
The use of the decision process differs by situation. The purchase of a new home ­usually 
means a thorough use of each step in the process; perceived risk is high regardless of the 
consumer’s background. In the purchase of a fast-food meal, the consumer often skips certain 
steps; perceived risk is low regardless of the person’s background. There are three types of 
decision processes: extended decision making, limited decision making, and routine decision 
making.
Extended decision making occurs when a consumer makes full use of the decision process. 
Much time is spent gathering information and ranking alternatives—what to buy and where to 
buy—before a purchase. The potential for cognitive dissonance is great. In this category are expen-
sive, complex items with which a person has had little or no experience. Perceived risk of all kinds 
is high. Items requiring extended decision making include a house, a first car, and life insurance. 
At any point in the process, a consumer can stop, and for expensive, complex items, this occurs 
often. Consumer traits (such as age, education, an income) have the most impact.
Because their customers tend to use extended decision making, such retailers as real-estate 
brokers and auto dealers emphasize personal selling, printed materials, and other communication 
to provide as much information as possible. A low-key informative approach may be best, so shop-
pers do not feel threatened. Various financing options may be offered. In this way, the consumer’s 
perceived risk is minimized.
With limited decision making, a consumer uses all the steps in the purchase process but 
does not spend a great deal of time on each of them. It requires less time than extended deci-
sion making because a person typically has some experience with both the brand and retailer 
choice of the purchase. This category includes items that have been bought before but not 
regularly. Risk is moderate, and the consumer spends some time shopping. Priority may be 
placed on evaluating known alternatives according to a person’s desires and standards, although 
information search is vital for some. Items requiring limited decision making include a second 
car, clothing, a vacation, and gifts. Consumer attributes affect decision making, but the impact 
lessens as perceived risk falls and experience rises. Income, purchase importance, and motives 
play strong roles.
This form of decision making is relevant to such retailers as department stores, specialty 
stores, and nonstore retailers that want to sway behavior and that carry goods and services that 
people have bought before. The shopping environment and assortment are very important. Sales 
personnel should be available for questions and to differentiate among brands or models.
Routine decision making takes place when the consumer buys out of habit and skips steps 
in the purchase process. He or she wants to spend little or no time shopping, and the same brands 
are usually repurchased (often from the same retailers). This category includes items bought regu-
larly. They have little risk due to consumer experience. The key step is problem awareness. When 
the consumer realizes a good or service is needed, a repurchase is often automatic. Information 
search, evaluation of alternatives, and post-purchase behavior are unlikely. These steps are not 
undertaken so long as a person is satisfied. Items involved with routine decision making include 
groceries, newspapers, and haircuts. Consumer attributes have little impact. Problem awareness 
almost inevitably leads to a purchase.
This type of decision making is most relevant to such retailers as supermarkets, dry cleaners, 
and fast-food outlets. For them, the following strategic elements are crucial: a good location, long 
hours, clear product displays, and, most important, product availability. Ads should be reminder-
oriented. The major task is completing the transaction quickly and precisely.
Impulse Purchases and Customer Loyalty
Impulse purchases and customer loyalty merit special attention. Impulse purchases arise when 
consumers buy products and/or brands they had not planned on buying before entering a store, 
reading a mail-order catalog, seeing a TV shopping show, turning to the Web, and so forth. At 

 
CHAPTER 7  •  Identifying and Understanding Consumers	
205	
least part of consumer decision making is influenced by the retailer. There are three kinds of 
impulse shopping:
▶
▶Completely unplanned. Before coming into contact with a retailer, a consumer has no intention 
of making a purchase in a goods or service category.
▶
▶Partially unplanned. Before coming into contact with a retailer, a consumer has decided to 
make a purchase in a goods or service category but has not chosen a brand or model.
▶
▶Unplanned substitution. A consumer intends to buy a specific brand of a good or service but 
changes his or her mind about the brand after coming into contact with a retailer.
With the partially unplanned and substitution kinds of impulse purchases, some decisions 
take place before a person interacts with a retailer. In these cases, a shopper may be involved with 
extended, limited, or routine decision making. Completely unplanned shopping often relates to 
routine or limited decision making; there is little or no time spent shopping; the key step is prob-
lem awareness.
Traditional store-based strategies to sell impulse goods were to place magazines, gift cards, 
batteries, and candies near cash registers. This strategy is not as successful as in the past as more 
consumers are making purchases online or ordering goods for home delivery through grocery lists 
that do not include these items.22
In studying impulse buying, these are some of the consumer attitudes and behavior patterns 
that retailers should take into consideration:
▶
▶In-store browsing is positively affected by the amount of time a person has to shop.
▶
▶Some individuals are more predisposed toward making impulse purchases than others.
▶
▶The leading reason given by consumers for impulse shopping is to take advantage of a low 
price/bargain. Impulse purchases should no longer be viewed of as frivolous behavior—
increasingly, it is savvy opportunism. See Figure 7-8.
▶
▶Impulse shopping is affected by how stores are arranged. Old Navy reconfigured many of 
its stores so shoppers could move through the stores more easily and be exposed to more 
products.
▶
▶Impulse shopping is influenced by whether consumers believe that discounts are real.
▶
▶Impulse purchasing is not confined to stores. Web-based impulse purchases can be 
increased through various strategies. These include having an attractive and informative 
Web site, making it easy to buy items (such as Amazon’s one-click purchasing), offering 
free shipping, and targeting shoppers based on past purchases, where they live, and media 
consumption.23

Part 3  •  Targeting Customers and Gathering Information
When customer loyalty exists, a person regularly patronizes a particular retailer (store or 
nonstore) that he or she knows, likes, and trusts. This lets consumers reduce decision making 
because they do not have to invest time learning about and choosing the retailer from which to 
purchase. Loyal customers tend to be time-conscious (e.g., shop locally); do not often engage in 
outshopping; and spend more per shopping trip. In a service setting, such as an auto repair shop, 
customer satisfaction often leads to shopper loyalty; price has less bearing on decisions. Applying 
the retailing concept enhances the chances of gaining and keeping customers. This means being 
customer-oriented, coordinated, value-driven, and goal-oriented. Relationship retailing also helps!
The degree of customer loyalty to retailers can be classified according to five groupings: false 
loyalty, inertial loyalty, latent loyalty, premium loyalty, and reciprocal loyalty. In false loyalty, 
customers buy from a retailer only when it is offering special sales or promotions. With inertia 
loyalty, customers are loyal to a retailer mainly by the convenience of its location for store-based 
retailers or the ease of ordering and delivery for Web-based retailers. Latent loyal customers are 
loyal to a retailer, but they are light shoppers. With premium loyalty, people are heavy shoppers 
and advocates for the retailer among friends and family. The most loyal shoppers are reciprocal 
loyal. They have a strong relationship with a retailer by being advocates, through high purchase 
activity and by membership and participation in reward programs.24
Unfortunately, a number of retailers use a one-size-fits-all loyalty program, typically mon-
etary rewards to stimulate repeat visits. Price reductions often do not alter long-run purchase 
behavior for people who desire more personal service or convenience. After buying from a retailer 
because of a limited-time price reduction, some shoppers are apt to return to their usual retailers. 
A better strategy to sustain customer loyalty is to offer tailored rewards, based on what particular 
shoppers desire. Tailored promotions include merchandise and service upgrades, free shipping by 
online stores, and messages through cell phone apps, as well as being more effective in enhancing 
customer engagement and loyalty.25
RETAILER ACTIONS
As noted in Chapter 3, in mass marketing, a firm such as a supermarket or a drugstore sells to 
a broad spectrum of consumers; it does not really focus efforts on any one kind of customer. In 
concentrated marketing, a retailer tailors its strategy to the needs of one distinct consumer group, 
such as young working women; it does not attempt to satisfy people outside that segment. With 
differentiated marketing, a retailer aims at two or more distinct consumer groups, such as men and 
boys, with a different strategy mix for each; it can do this by operating more than one kind of outlet 
(such as separate men’s and boys’ clothing stores) or by having distinct departments grouped by 
market segment in a single store (as a department store might do). In deciding on a target ­market 
approach, a retailer considers its goods/service category and goals, competitors’ actions, the size 
of various segments, the efficiency of each target market alternative for the particular firm, the 
resources required, and other factors. See Figure 7-9.
After choosing a target-market method, the retailer selects the target market(s) to which it 
wants to appeal; identifies the characteristics, needs, and attitudes of the target market(s); seeks to 
understand how its target customers make purchase decisions; and acts appropriately. The process 
to devise a target market strategy is shown in Figure 7-10. Next, we present several examples of 
retailers’ target-market activities.
We now present several examples of retailers’ target market activities.

One of the major applications of big data is personalized rec-
ommendations. It can be used on Web sites and, in the store 
setting, offer targeted offers and discounts. Recommendations 
are based on a customer’s purchasing history or the histories 
of other consumers just like them. The computerized system 
predicts what the customer is likely to buy next and makes the 
recommendation to them. Analysts suggest that Amazon rec-
ommendations generate a revenue uplift of between 10 and 30 
percent. Some retailers use third-party recommendation engines, 
but they will increasingly develop their own.

Retailers with Mass Marketing Strategies
Walgreens drugstore chain and Kohl’s Department Stores engage in mass marketing. We will 
discuss both.
Walgreens Boots Alliance is a global company, with over 13,100 drugstores (Walgreens, 
Duane Reade, Boots, and Alliance Healthcare) in 11 countries. The firm attracts a broad array 
of ­customers. Three-quarters of the U.S. population live within 5 miles of a Walgreens or Duane 
Reade pharmacy. To attract a broad customer base, Walgreens Boots Alliance has convenient store 
locations, offers a broad array of consumer goods in addition to pharmacy and health care needs, 
and has online access. The retailer’s Web sites have an average of 68 million visits per month.26
Kohl’s is a popular general merchandise retailer capitalizing on mass marketing. Key com-
ponents of Kohl’s mass marketing approach include: the sale of moderately priced private-label 
merchandise; exclusive and national brand apparel; and footwear and accessories for women, 
men, and children. Kohl’s has a consistent merchandise mix across all stores (except for some 
differences due to meeting regional preferences).27
Retailers with Concentrated Marketing Strategies
Next, we will discuss Dollar Tree and Claire’s Stores. Both engage in concentrated marketing.
With the acquisition of Family Dollar, Dollar Tree is the leading operator of discount variety 
stores in the U.S. with 13,000 stores in 48 states and 5 Canadian providences. Its Dollar Tree stores 
target lower-middle-income customers in suburban locations. These stores sell all items for $1. 
Dollar Tree has been adding freezers and coolers to drive customer traffic. Its Family Dollar divi-
sion sells general merchandise to a lower-income customer in urban and rural locales. Family 
Dollar stores offer multiple price points, serving customers as their “neighborhood discount store,” 
with great values on everyday items and a convenient shopping experience.28
Claire’s Stores, Inc. operates close to 3,000 stores under the Claire’s and Icing brand names. 
The Claire’s stores specialize in fashionable jewelry and accessories (including earrings, necklaces,

fashion and hair accessories for women (including jewelry, cosmetics, and watches).29
Retailers with Differentiated Marketing Strategies
Last, we’ll focus on Foot Locker, Inc. and Gap Inc. Both engage in differentiated marketing.
Besides its mainstream Foot Locker stores, the parent company (Foot Locker, Inc.) also oper-
ates chains geared specially toward women and children. Lady Foot Locker offers athletic foot-
wear and apparel brands, as well as casual wear and apparel designed for running, walking, toning, 
and fitness. Kids Foot Locker carries “the largest selection of brand-name athletic footwear, 
apparel, and accessories for young athletes. Its stores feature an environment geared to appeal to 
both parents and children.”30
Gap Inc. applies differentiated marketing through its Gap (“clean, classic clothing and acces-
sories to help customers express their individual sense of style”—including Gap, Gap Kids, Baby 
Gap, Gap Maternity, Gap Body, and GapFit collections); Banana Republic (clothing, shoes, hand-
bags, and fashion accessories with detailed craftsmanship and luxurious materials); Old Navy 
(less-expensive fashions and accessories than the Gap, but highly styled); Athleta (women’s active 
and fitness apparel); and Intermix (styles from emerging and established designers).31
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING CONSUMERS
Several environmental factors influence shopping attitudes and behavior, including:
▶
▶State of the economy
▶
▶Consumer confidence about the future
▶
▶Country of residence (industrialized versus developing)
▶
▶Cost of living in the person’s region or city of residence
▶
▶Rate of inflation (how quickly prices are rising)
▶
▶Infrastructure where people shop, such as traffic congestion, the crime rate, and the ease of 
parking
▶
▶Price wars among retailers
▶
▶Emergence of new retail formats
▶
▶Emergence of new technologies
▶
▶Trend toward more people working at home
▶
▶Government and community regulations regarding shopping hours, new construction, con-
sumer protection, and so forth
▶
▶Evolving societal values and norms
▶
▶Digital presence and convenience of shopping at the retailer’s Web site or mobile app
Although all of these elements may not necessarily have an impact on any particular shopper, they 
do influence the retailer’s overall target market.
When planning the retail strategy that they offer their customers, companies should consider 
the customers’ standard of living, including family size; discretionary income after spending for 
health, recreation, and social services; and consumer confidence in their financial future. Unem-
ployment, low wages, crowded living conditions, and physical calamities may bring a drop in 
the standard of living; and an increase in social benefits and higher wages may bring a rise. The 
standard of living varies from nation to nation, and international comparisons are sometimes made 
by analyzing per capita income or any number of other indicators.

marketing—with its

Senza, and Henri Bendel 
units.
Chapter Summary
1.	 To discuss why it is important for a retailer to properly 
identify, understand, and appeal to its customers. To 
properly develop a strategy mix, a retailer must identify 
the characteristics, needs, and attitudes of consumers; 
understand how consumers make decisions; and enact 
the proper target-market plan. It must study environmen-
tal influences, too.
2.	 To enumerate and describe a number of consumer demo-
graphics, lifestyle factors, and needs and desires—and to 

 
CHAPTER 7  •  Identifying and Understanding Consumers

explain how these concepts can be applied to retailing. 
Demographics are easily identifiable and measurable 
population statistics. Lifestyles are the ways in which 
consumers live and spend time and money.
Consumer demographics include gender, age, life 
expectancy, literacy, languages spoken, income, retail 
sales, education, and ethnic/racial background. These 
data usually have to be localized to be useful for retail-
ers. Consumer lifestyles comprise social and psychologi-
cal elements and are affected by demographics. Social 
factors include culture, social class, reference groups, the 
family life cycle, and time utilization. Psychological fac-
tors include personality, class consciousness, attitudes, 
perceived risk, and purchase importance. As with demo-
graphics, a firm can set a lifestyle profile of its target 
market by analyzing these concepts.
There are several demographic and lifestyle trends 
that apply to retailing. These involve gender roles, con-
sumer sophistication and confidence, the poverty of 
time, and component lifestyles. Research has enumer-
ated consumer profiles in a useful way for retailers.
In preparing a target market profile, consumer 
needs and desires should be identified. Needs are 
basic ­shopping requirements, and desires are dis-
cretionary  shopping  goals. A retail strategy geared 
toward ­satisfying consumer needs is appealing to their 
motives—the reasons for behavior. The better needs and 
desires are addressed, the more apt people are to buy.
3.	 To examine consumer attitudes toward shopping and 
consumer shopping behavior, including the consumer 
decision process and its stages. Many people do not 
enjoy shopping and no longer feel high prices reflect 
value. Different segments have different attitudes. More 
people now believe private brands are of good quality. 
Consumer patronage differs by retailer type. People 
often cross-shop, whereby they shop for a product cat-
egory at more than one retail format during the year or 
visit multiple retailers on the same shopping trip.
Retailers should be aware of consumer behavior—the 
process individuals use to decide whether, what, when, 
where, how, from whom, and how often to buy. The con-
sumer’s decision process has two perspectives: (a) the 
good or service the consumer thinks of buying and (b) 
where the consumer will buy that item. These decisions 
can be made separately or jointly.
The consumer decision process consists of stimulus, 
problem awareness, information search, evaluation of 
alternatives, purchase, and post-purchase behavior. It 
is influenced by a person’s background and traits. A 
stimulus is a cue or drive meant to motivate a person 
to act. At problem awareness, the consumer not only 
has been aroused by a stimulus but also recognizes that 
a good or service may solve a problem of shortage or 
unfulfilled desire. An information search determines 
the available alternatives and their characteristics. 
Alternatives are then evaluated and ranked. In the pur-
chase act, a consumer considers the place of purchase, 
terms, and availability. After a purchase, there may be 
post-purchase behavior in the form of additional pur-
chases or re-evaluation. The consumer may have cogni-
tive dissonance if there is doubt that a correct choice 
has been made.
In extended decision making, a person makes full use 
of the decision process. In limited decision making, each 
step is used, but not in depth. In routine decision making, 
a person buys out of habit and skips steps. Impulse pur-
chases occur when shoppers make purchases they had 
not planned before coming into contact with the retailer. 
With customer loyalty, a person regularly patronizes a 
retailer.
4.	 To look at retailer actions based on target market plan-
ning. Retailers can deploy mass marketing, concentrated 
marketing, or differentiated marketing. Several examples 
are presented.
5.	 To note some of the environmental factors that affect 
consumer shopping. Consumer attitudes and behavior 
are swayed by the economy, inflation, the infrastructure 
where people shop, and other factors. Retailers also need 
to consider how the standard of living is changing.

Questions for Discussion
1.	 Comment on this statement: “A competitive retail sector, 
facing an uncertain economic future, is being challenged 
by consumers to compete for their business. In this envi-
ronment, only the fittest and those really listening to 
what their customers really want are likely to survive.”
2.	 Analyze the global population data in Table 7-1 from a 
retailing perspective.
3.	 How could a self-service frozen yogurt chain use the 
U.S. population data presented in Table 7-2?
4.	 Explain how a retailer selling expensive bicycles could 
reduce the six types of perceived risk.
5.	 Why is it important for retailers to know the difference 
between needs and desires?
6.	 Why do some consumers engage in outshopping? What 
could be done to encourage them to shop closer to home?
7.	 Identify the product categories with high cross-shopping. 
What is the reason for this?
8.	 The consumer decision process can be either short and 
decisive or long and involved, depending on the product 
or service and the involvement of the retailer. Outline 
this process and illustrate it with an example of a short 
decision process and a longer one.
9.	 Outline how a retailer could maximize the tendency for 
many consumers to buy impulsively.
10.	 Some retailers engage in differentiated marketing by 
having distinctively separated brands to cater for differ-
ent customer targets. Give local examples and explain 
why this is necessary.

Processing in Retailing
Chapter 
Objectives
1. To discuss how 
information flows in 
a retail distribution 
channel
2. To show why retailers 
should avoid strategies 
based on inadequate 
information
3. To look at the retail 
information system, its 
components, and the 
recent advances in such 
systems
4. To describe the 
marketing research 
process
The best retailers recognize that their decisions should be made after gathering and 
analyzing key information rather than making decisions based on intuition or “gut feelings.” 
We are seeing more and more often that feedback can play a vital ongoing role in this 
process—even with regard to acquiring competitive intelligence.
Although many retailers just pay lip service to customer satisfaction, others employ real 
service efforts. “Lip service retailers” publicly state that customer service is important but 
do not empower employees; or they believe that customer service is going well so long as 
there are no complaints; or they refuse to fund service guarantee programs based on cost 
considerations. In contrast, real service is based on having high customer long-term loyalty 
based on delighting customers.
One way of distinguishing between the two is to see how far a retailer would go for its 
customers. Would it go as far as reporters and other employees at the Boston Globe recently 
did? After hearing repeated subscriber complaints about “widespread delivery problems,” 
the Boston Globe management asked for volunteers in the newsroom to deliver the Sunday 
paper. The response was positively overwhelming. Editors, reporters, Web producers, and 
employees in marketing and advertising arrived at the newspaper’s three distribution centers, 
stacked the Sunday edition in their own cars, and fanned out across the city to deliver the

papers. One reporter said, “It was pretty incredible that so many people were willing to give 
up their sleep because we care so much about our readers.”
There are other stories of retail employees going beyond customer expectations to delight 
customers. In one incident, a Nordstrom tailor did alterations on a garment not purchased at 
Nordstrom’s so a bridesmaid’s dress would properly fit. In another instance, a bellhop at a Ritz 
Carlton drove to the airport to meet up with a guest who left some valuables behind in a hotel 
room. How far would your retailers go to satisfy customers after receiving feedback from them?1
Overview
When a retailer sets a new strategy or modifies an existing one, gathering and analyzing informa-
tion is crucial because it reduces the chances of wrong decisions. The firm can study the attributes 
and buying behavior of current and potential customers, alternative store and nonstore sites, store 
management and operations, product offerings, prices, and store image and promotion to prepare 
the best plan. See Figure 8-1.
Research activity should, to a large degree, be determined by the risk involved. Although it may be 
risky for a department store to open a new branch store, there is much less risk if that retailer is deciding 
whether to carry a new line of sweaters. In the branch store situation, thousands of research dollars and 
months of study may be necessary. In the case of the new sweaters, limited research may be sufficient.
Information gathering and processing should be conducted in an ongoing manner, yielding 
enough data for planning and analysis. Consider this example: More and more, retailers are gath-
ering in-store geofencing and mobile beacon data, and then merging these data with information 
from their more traditional sources. With geofencing technology, retailers can track customers 
away from the store. iBeacon technology enables retailers to track customers inside the store.
They are also studying clickstream data which track behavior from Web sites, E-mail inter-
actions, and point-of-sale data to integrate online and offline behavioral information to obtain 
customer insights and personalize shopper experience across multiple channels.2
This chapter first looks at the information flows in a retail distribution channel and notes the 
ramifications of inadequate research. We then describe the retail information system, database 
management and data warehousing, and the marketing research process in detail.
iTools (www.itools.com)

tools, including multiple 
search engines, a dictionary, 
a thesaurus, a language 
translator, and more.

CHAPTER 8   •  Information Gathering and Processing in Retailing	
213	
INFORMATION FLOWS IN A RETAIL DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL
In an effective retail distribution channel, information flows freely and efficiently among the three 
main parties: supplier (manufacturer and/or wholesaler), retailer, and consumer. This enables the 
parties to better anticipate and address each other’s performance expectations. We highlight the 
flows in Figure 8-2 and describe the information needs of the parties next.
A supplier needs to know different kinds of information. From the retailer, the supplier needs 
estimates of category sales, inventory turnover rates, feedback on competitors, the level of cus-
tomer returns, and so on. From the consumer, the retailer needs to know about attitudes toward 
given styles and models, the extent of brand loyalty, the willingness to pay a premium for superior 
quality, and the like.
A retailer also needs to know different kinds of information. From the supplier, the retailer 
needs advance notice of new models and model changes, training materials for complex products, 
sales forecasts, justification for price hikes, and so on. From the consumer, the retailer wants to 
know why people shop with the retailer, what they like and dislike about the retailer, where else 
people shop, and so on.
And the consumer needs different types of information. From the supplier, the consumer 
needs assembly and operating instructions, the extent of warranty coverage, where to send a 
complaint, and so forth. From the retailer, the consumer needs to know how various alternatives 
compare, where specific merchandise is stocked in the store, the methods of payment accepted, 
the rain check policy when a sale item is out of stock, and so on.
Retailers often play a crucial role in collecting data for other members of the value delivery 
chain because they have the most direct contact with shoppers. They can assist other channel 
members by:
▶
▶Permitting data to be gathered on their premises. Many research firms like to conduct surveys 
at shopping centers because of the large and broad base of shoppers.
▶
▶Gathering specific data requested by suppliers, such as how shoppers react to displays.
▶
▶Passing along information on the attributes of consumers buying particular brands and mod-
els. Because many credit transactions involve retailer cards, these retailers can link purchases 
with consumer age, income, occupation, and other factors.
For the best information flows, collaboration and cooperation are necessary—especially 
between suppliers and retailers. This is not always easy. Managing supply chain systems,

Customer relationship managers typically rely on Universal 
Product Code–generated data (UPC) in conjunction with the 
retailer’s POS system. An important use of point-of-sale (POS) 
equipment is to set up customers’ accounts and collect and 
analyze their purchase history. Point-of-sale systems often look 
at core customer data. These customers are quite loyal to a 
retailer. An effective customer relationship management pro-
gram relies on timely data, enabling a retailer to offer special 
sales and services to the best customers, suggest new items 
based on purchase history, and have special coupon offers to 
former core customers with diminished activity. As an example, 
a supermarket retailer can offer different coupons to consum-
ers whose purchase history favors packaged goods versus those 
who favor organics.
What information skills should a customer relationship man-
ager possess?

processes, and infrastructure and the associated changes to transform legacy store-based opera-
tions to omnichannel is complex and difficult. The lack of visibility across supply chain functions, 
as well as fragmented, incomplete, insufficient data, and/or manual processes of pre-existing 
systems and infrastructure, are not ideally suited for omnichannel functions. This results in the 
limited ability of existing retailers to compete effectively with new retailers deploying systems 
designed for omnichannel operations.3
Fortunately, many retailers are working to improve their information-sharing efforts. And 
as in many aspects of retailing, Walmart is leading the way. Thousands of suppliers have online 
access to Walmart’s database through its password-protected online Retail Link system, which 
handles hundreds of thousands of information queries weekly. Retail Link was developed to 
promote more collaboration in inventory planning and product shipping, and it is a linchpin of 
Walmart’s information efforts.4
AVOIDING RETAIL STRATEGIES BASED ON INADEQUATE 
INFORMATION
Retailers may rely on nonsystematic or incomplete ways of gathering information due to time 
and costs, as well as a lack of research skills. But the results can be devastating. For example:
▶
▶Using intuition. A movie theater charges $10 for tickets at all times. The manager feels that 
because all patrons are seeing the same movie, prices should be the same for a Monday mati-
nee as a Saturday evening. Yet, by looking at data stored in the theater’s information system, 
she would learn attendance is much lower on Mondays. Because people prefer Saturday 
evening performances, they will pay $10 to see a movie then. Weekday customers have to be 
lured, and a lower price is a way to do so.
▶
▶Continuing what was done before. A toy store orders conservatively for the holiday season 
because prior year sales were weak. The store sells out 2 weeks before the peak of the season, 
and more items cannot be received in time for the holiday. The owner assumed that last year’s 
poor sales would occur again. Yet, a consumer survey would reveal a sense of optimism and 
an increased desire to give gifts.
▶
▶Copying a successful competitor’s strategy. A local bookstore decides to cut the prices of 
best-sellers to match the prices of Amazon.com. The local store then loses a lot of money 
and goes out of business because its costs are too high to match the chain. The firm lost sight 
of its natural strengths (personal service, a customer-friendly atmosphere, and long-time 
community ties).
▶
▶Devising a strategy after speaking to a few individuals about their perceptions. A family-run 
gift store decides to have a family meeting to determine the product assortment for the next 
year. Each family member gives an opinion, and an overall “shopping list” is then compiled. 
Sometimes, the selections are right on target; other times, they result in a lot of excess 
inventory. The family would do better by also attending trade shows and reading industry 
publications.
▶
▶Automatically assuming that a successful business can easily expand. A Web retailer does 
well with small appliances and portable TVs. It has a good reputation and wants to add other 
product lines to capitalize on customer goodwill. However, adding custom furniture yields 
poor results. The firm did not first conduct research, which would have indicated that people 
buy standard, branded merchandise via the Web but are reluctant to buy custom furniture 
that way.
▶
▶Not having a good read on consumer perceptions. A florist cuts the price of 2-day-old flow-
ers from $17 to $5 a dozen because they have a shorter life expectancy, but they don’t sell. 
The florist assumes bargain-hunting consumers will want the flowers as gifts or for floral 
arrangements. What the florist does not realize (due to a lack of research) is that people 
perceive the older flowers to be of poor quality. The extremely low price actually turns off 
customers!
What conclusion should we draw from these examples? Inadequate information can cause a 
firm to devise and enact a bad strategy. These situations can be avoided by using a well-conceived 
retail information system and properly executing marketing research.

THE RETAIL INFORMATION SYSTEM
Data gathering and analysis should not be regarded as a one-shot resolution of a single retailing 
issue. They should be part of an ongoing, integrated process. A retail information system (RIS) 
anticipates the information needs of retail managers; collects, organizes, and stores relevant data 
on a continuous basis; and directs the flow of information to the proper decision makers.
These topics are covered next: Building and using a retail information system, database 
management, and gathering information via the UPC (Universal Product Code) and EDI (elec-
tronic data interchange).
Building and Using a Retail Information System
Figure 8-3 presents a general RIS. A retailer begins with its business philosophy and goals, which 
are affected by environmental factors (such as competitors and the economy). The philosophy and 
goals provide guidelines that direct strategic planning. Some aspects of plans are routine and need 
little re-evaluation. Others are nonroutine and need evaluation each time they arise.
After a strategy is outlined, data must be collected, analyzed, and interpreted. If data already 
exist, they are retrieved from files. When new data are acquired, files are updated. All of this 
occurs in the information control center. Based on data in the control center, decisions are enacted.
Performance is fed back to the information control center and compared with pre-set criteria. 
Data are retrieved from files or further data collected. Routine adjustments are made promptly. 
Regular reports and exception reports (to explain deviations from expected performance) are 
shown to the right parties. Managers may react in a way affecting company philosophy or goals 
(such as revamping a passé image or forgoing short-run profits to buy a new computer system).
A retail information system

information, which makes

Retailers used to be most concerned about truck hijacking and 
robberies; today, they are most concerned about cyber theft. 
Unlike stolen inventory, with cyber theft, data can be passed 
along electronically and anonymously among thieves. Among 
the retailers that have had significant credit-card account infor-
mation theft are: Target, CVS, Wendy’s, and Home Depot. 
The average size of a single credit-card data breach incident 
has increased a lot in recent years. Cyber theft has costs for 
retailers, credit-card issuers, and consumers. Even though con-
sumer liability is limited, payment processors are passing more 
costs onto retailers. The greater U.S. retailer use of credit cards 
with embedded chips can reduce fraud and breaches–as they 
have done in Europe–since these embedded cards are more 
secure in the store.
How else should retailers better keep customers’ credit-card 
information secure?

PART 3  •  TARGETING CUSTOMERS AND GATHERING INFORMATION
All types of data should be stored in the control center for future and ongoing use, and the 
control center should be integrated with the firm’s short- and long-run plans and operations. Infor-
mation should not be gathered sporadically and haphazardly but systematically.
A good RIS has several strengths. Information gathering is organized and company focused. 
Data are regularly collected and stored so opportunities are foreseen and crises averted. Strategic 
elements can be coordinated. New strategies can be devised more quickly. Quantitative results are 
accessible, and cost/benefit analysis can be done. Information is routed to the right personnel. Yet, 
deploying a retail information system may require high initial time and labor costs, and complex 
decisions may be needed to set up such a system.
In building a retail information system, a number of decisions have to be made:
▶
▶How active a role should be given to the RIS? Will it be used to proactively search for and 
distribute any relevant data or will it be used to reactively respond to requests from managers 
when problems arise? The best systems are more proactive because they anticipate events.
▶
▶Should an RIS be managed internally or be outsourced? Although many retailers engage 
in RIS functions, some use outside specialists. Either style can work, so long as the RIS is 
guided by the retailer’s information needs. Several firms have their own RIS and use outside 
firms for specific tasks (such as conducting surveys or managing networks).
▶
▶How much should an RIS cost? Retailers typically spend 0.5 to 2.5 percent of their sales on 
an RIS. This lags behind most of the suppliers from which retailers buy goods and services.5
▶
▶How technology-driven should an RIS be? Although retailers can gather data from trade asso-
ciations, surveys, and so forth, more firms now rely on technology to drive the information 
process. With the advent of low-cost personal computers and tablets, inexpensive networks, 
cloud computing, and low-priced software, technology is easy to use. Even a neighborhood 
deli can generate sales data by product and offer specials on slow-sellers. See Figure 8-4.

CHAPTER 8   •  Information Gathering and Processing in Retailing	
217	
▶
▶How much data are enough? The purpose of an RIS is to provide enough information, on 
a regular basis, for a retailer to make the proper strategy choices—not to overwhelm retail 
managers. This means performing a balancing act between too little information and informa-
tion overload. To avoid overload, data should be carefully edited to eliminate redundancies.
▶
▶How should data be disseminated throughout the firm? This requires decisions as to who 
receives various reports, frequency of data distribution, and access to databases. When a firm 
has multiple divisions or operates in several regions, information access and distribution must 
be coordinated.
▶
▶How should data be stored for future use? Relevant data should be stored in a way that makes 
information retrieval easy and allows for adequate longitudinal (period-to-period) analysis.
Larger retailers tend to have a chief information officer (CIO) oversee the RIS. Their informa-
tion systems departments often have formal, written annual plans. Computers are used by virtu-
ally all firms that conduct information systems analysis, and many firms use the Web for some 
RIS functions. Further growth in the use of retail information systems is still expected. There are 
many differences in information systems among retailers, in terms of revenues and retail format.
Thirty-five years ago, most computerized retail systems were used only to reduce cashier 
errors and improve inventory control. Today, they often form the basis for a retail informa-
tion system and are used in surveys, ordering, merchandise transfers between stores, and other 
tasks. These activities are conducted by both small and large retailers. Most small and medium 
­retailers—as well as large retailers—have computerized financial management systems, analyze 
sales electronically, and use computerized inventory management systems. Here are illustrations 
of how retailers are using the latest technology advances to computerize their information systems.
Retail Pro, Inc. markets Retail Pro management information software to retailers. This soft-
ware is used at stores around the world. Although popular with large retailers, Retail Pro software 
also appeals to smaller and specialty retailers due to flexible pricing based on the number of users 
and stores, the type of hardware, payment fraud protection with its partner Cayan POS, customer 
personalization, and business optimization technology for an omnichannel strategy.6
MicroStrategy typically works with larger retailers—including about two-thirds of the top 
500 retailers in the world—to provide merchandising optimization, loss prevention, and customer 
insight analytics; mobile technology for customer engagement; sales training; product informa-
tion; and store operations and security solutions.7
Database Management
In database management, a retailer gathers, integrates, applies, and stores information related 
to specific subject areas. It is a major element in a retail information system, and may be used 
with customer databases, vendor databases, product category databases, and so on. A firm may 
compile and store data on customer attributes and purchase behavior, compute sales figures by 
vendor, and store records by product category. Each of these would represent a separate database. 
Among retailers that have databases, most use them for frequent shopper programs, customer 
analysis, promotion evaluation, inventory planning, trading-area analysis, joint promotions with 
manufacturers, media planning, and customer communications.
Database management should be approached as a series of five steps:
1.	 Plan the particular database and its components and determine information needs.
2.	 Acquire the necessary information.
3.	 Retain the information in a usable and accessible format.
4.	 Update the database regularly to reflect demographic trends, recent purchases, and so forth.
5.	 Analyze the database to determine company strengths and weaknesses.
Information can come from internal and external sources. A firm can develop databases 
internally by keeping detailed records and sorting them. It could generate databases by customer—

data deluge is paramount. Customer information management providers such as Pitney Bowes, 
a leader in this field, leverage their expertise and data collected from their multiple clients and 
industries to facilitate cross-channel and cross-border commerce. Pitney Bowes’ Single Customer 
View service provides a fully integrated 360-degree view of customers to employees. This is done 
by converting company-dispersed customer interaction data into integrated databases; adding 
geodemographic context to customer profiles to uncover timely, actionable insights to help craft 
memorable customer experiences; dynamically tracking customer lifetime value; improving the 
efficiency of customer acquisitions; and, in some cases, ensuring compliance with national and 
international regulations.8
To effectively manage a retail database, these are vital considerations:
▶
▶What are the firm’s database goals?
▶
▶Who will be responsible for data management?
▶
▶What type of information will be collected and produced? What will be its format (images, 
data files, and so on)? Where do you plan to store the data?
▶
▶Is every database initiative analyzed to see if it is successful?
▶
▶Is there a mechanism to flag data that indicates potential problems or opportunities?
▶
▶Are customer purchases of different items or from different company divisions cross-linked?
▶
▶How will data be communicated?
▶
▶Is there a clear privacy policy that is communicated to those in a database? Are there opt-out 
provisions for those who do not want to be included in a database?
▶
▶Is the database updated each time there is a customer interaction?
▶
▶Are customers, personnel, suppliers, and others invited to update their personal data?
▶
▶Is the database periodically checked to eliminate redundant files?
▶
▶Roughly how long should the data be retained? Is it permanent? Will it be updated?9
Let’s now discuss two aspects of database management: Data warehousing is a mechanism 
for storing and distributing information. Data mining and micromarketing are ways in which 
information can be utilized. Figure 8-5 shows the interplay of data warehousing with data mining 
and micromarketing.
DATA WAREHOUSING  One advance in database management is data warehousing, whereby 
copies of all the databases in a firm are maintained in one location and are accessible to ­employees 
at any locale. A data warehouse is a comprehensive compilation of the data used to support man-
agement decision making. According to government sources,
Pitney Bowes (www 
.pitneybowes.com/us) offers 
a number of useful products 
to help firms build and 
manage their databases.
FIGURE 8-5
Retail Database Management 
in Action
The data warehouse is where 
information is collected, sorted, 
and stored centrally. Information is 
disseminated to retailer personnel, as 
well as to channel partners (such as 
alerting them to what merchandise is hot 
and what is not hot) and customers (such 
as telling them about order status). In 
data mining, retail executives and other 
employees—and sometimes channel 
partners—analyze information by 
customer type, product category, and so 
forth in order to determine opportunities 
for tailored marketing efforts. With 
micromarketing, the retailer applies 
differentiated marketing. Focused 
retail strategy mixes are planned for 
specific customer segments—or even for 
individual customers.

CHAPTER 8   •  Information Gathering and Processing in Retailing	
219	
The fundamental attributes of a data warehouse are: Subject-Oriented—A data warehouse 
is organized around high-level business groupings called subjects [such as sales]. 
­Integrated—The data in the warehouse must be integrated and consistent. If two different 
source systems store conflicting data, the differences need to be resolved during the process 
of transforming the source data and loading it into the data warehouse. Time-Variant—A 
key characteristic distinguishing warehouses is the currency of the data. Operational systems 
require real-time views of data, while data warehouse applications generally deal with 
longer term, historical data. They can also provide access to a greater volume of more 
detailed information over a longer time period. Nonvolatile—Data in the warehouse is read-
only; updates or a refresh of the data occur on a periodic incremental or full refresh basis.10
A data warehouse has these components: (1) the data warehouse, where data are actually 
stored; (2) software to copy original databases and transfer them to the warehouse; (3) interactive 
software to process queries; and (4) a directory for the categories of data kept in the warehouse.
Data warehousing has several advantages. Executives and other employees are quickly, eas-
ily, and simultaneously able to access data wherever they may be. There is more companywide 
entrée to new data when they are first available. Data inconsistencies are reduced by consolidating 
records in one location. Better data analysis and manipulation are possible because information 
is stored in one location.
Computerized data warehouses were once costly to build (an average of $2.2 million in the 
1990s) and, thus, feasible only for the largest retailers. Rapid progress in Web 2.0 and cloud tech-
nologies now makes it possible for startup businesses, especially online-only retailers, to access 
data warehouse as a service (DWaaS). It is a cloud-based outsourcing model in which DWaaS ser-
vice providers such as Google (BigQuery), Microsoft (Azure), and Amazon Web Services (AWS) 
configure and manage the hardware, software platforms, and resources a data warehouse requires. 
The small business user uploads its own data and queries it on the Web through application pro-
gramming interfaces (APIs), and pays based on usage for the managed service.11 The user has no 
upfront costs to create, staff to manage, or software or hardware to upgrade, and can easily and 
quickly scale up from small to large in terms of usage and storage. Oracle, NCR-Teradata, and 
IBM provide enterprise-level data warehousing, and DWaaS provides the same to mid-size and 
large firms. Cabela’s, Hudson’s Bay, and 7-Eleven are just a few of the multitude of retailers that 
use data warehousing.12
Dollar Tree’s Family Dollar (www.familydollar.com) discount stores is one of the retailers 
positioning itself for long-term growth and developing an efficient collaborative business intel-
ligence program with suppliers by using a constantly updated retail data warehousing structure 
developed by Retail Solutions (RSi, www.retailsolutions.com). Real-time store-level inventory and 
point-of-sale data at the store/item and category level are provided through a Retail Management 
Solution after cleansing, validation, and standardization through a single portal to Family Dollar and 
its suppliers. Family Dollar can analyze performance by store cluster, price point, and product mix, 
and identify lost sales opportunities. Suppliers can fine-tune forecasting and product allocations, 
and identify distribution voids (e.g., phantom inventory). The micro-level information provides 
suppliers with greater understanding of consumer demand. Increased collaboration with Family 
Dollar lowers inventory-holding costs while providing consumers with the highest service levels.13
DATA MINING AND MICROMARKETING  Data mining is the in-depth analysis of information to 
gain specific insights about customers, product categories, vendors, and so forth. The goal is 
to learn if there are opportunities for tailored marketing efforts that would lead to better retailer 
performance. One application of data mining is micromarketing, whereby the retailer uses dif-
ferentiated marketing and develops focused retail strategy mixes for specific customer segments, 
sometimes fine-tuned for the individual shopper.
Data mining relies on special software to sift through a data warehouse to uncover patterns 
and relationships among different factors. The software allows vast amounts of data to be quickly 
searched and sorted. That is why many firms, such as supermarkets, have made the financial com-
mitment to data mining. The entry of well-funded online players such as Amazon, Google, and 
others has made the competition for grocery share of wallet even more fierce. Grocery has a 
distinct advantage over other forms of retail to leverage predictive analytics because consumers 
typically make frequent shopping trips according to SAS, a provider of business analytics software 
and services. Frequent-shopper card data help grocers track customer purchases over time and

PART 3  •  TARGETING CUSTOMERS AND GATHERING INFORMATION
understand a shopper’s evolving buying behavior. By using behavioral analytics and value seg-
mentation for multiple shoppers within a single household, combined with demographic data, 
retailers can create a more complete picture of that household’s needs and habits, personalize the 
shopping experience with micro-targeted promotions to increase the amount of groceries pur-
chased, improve profit margins, and increase consumer satisfaction.14
Gathering Information through the UPC and EDI
To be more efficient with their information systems, most retailers rely on the Universal Product 
Code (UPC) and many now utilize electronic data interchange (EDI).
With the Universal Product Code (UPC), products (or tags attached to them) are marked 
with a series of thick and thin vertical lines, representing each item’s identification code. An 
item’s UPC includes both numbers and lines. The lines are “read” by scanners at checkout coun-
ters. Cashiers do not enter transactions manually—though they can, if needed. Because the UPC 
itself is not readable by humans, the retailer or vendor must attach a ticket or sticker to a product 
specifying its size, color, and other information (if not on the package or the product). Given that 
the UPC does not include price information, this too must be added by a ticket or sticker.
By using UPC-based technology, retailers can record data instantly on an item’s model num-
ber, size, color, and other factors when it is sold, as well as send the data to a computer that 
monitors unit sales, inventory levels, and so forth. The goals are to produce better merchandising 
data, improve inventory management, speed transaction time, raise productivity, reduce errors, 
and coordinate information.
Since its inception more than 40 years ago, UPC technology has improved substantially. It 
is now the accepted retailing standard. Several billion scans occur every day. The UPC allows 
all stores in the retail sector to identify products and capture information about them. Stores can 
control inventory more efficiently, provide a faster and more accurate checkout for customers, 
and easily gather inventory data for accurate and immediate marketing reports. Virtually every 
time sales or inventory data are scanned by a computer, UPC technology is involved. More than 
200,000 U.S. manufacturers and retailers belong to GS1 US (formerly known as the Uniform Code 
Council), a group that has taken the lead in setting and promoting inter-industry product identi-
fication and communication standards.15 Figure 8-6 shows how far UPC technology has come.
Regular UPC tags may result in errors when scanned by customers for product information 
lookup and be a disadvantage in mobile commerce. To meet the needs of mobile-centric custom-
ers, manufacturers and brand owners are adopting GS1 US Mobile Scan that imprints packages 
with an imperceptible digital watermark (DWcode), that, when scanned with a smartphone app, is 
linked to a mobile-optimized Web address. This provides contextual product information provided 
by the brand. Retailers benefit from faster retail checkout, better supply chain efficiency, and an 
enhanced in-store experience resulting from more information at product locations in aisles and 
inventory. Consumers, anywhere in the world, get information transparency by scanning the UPC 
or package imprinted with a DWcode with their Internet-enabled smartphones. Consumers are 
then able to see a Web page with real-time, brand-authorized product information, pricing, special 
offers, instructional videos, rich media, and additional shopping assistance.16
With electronic data interchange (EDI) and Internet electronic data interchange (I-EDI), 
retailers and suppliers regularly exchange information through their computers with regard to 
inventory levels, delivery times, unit sales, and so on of particular items. As a result, both parties 
enhance their decision-making capabilities, better control inventory, and are more responsive to 
demand. UPC scanning is often the basis for product-related EDI data. Hundreds of thousands 
of firms around the world (led by U.S.-based firms) use some form of the EDI system. Retailers 
use EDI to replace paper-based documents such as purchase orders, invoices, inventory reports, 
shipping notifications, routing requests, and routing instructions to electronic documents sent from 
one computer system to another instantaneously.
Unlike in some other industries, the supply chain in the retail industry is very complicated, 
and has to be flexible and responsive to fluctuations in demand levels, which can differ for each 
SKU (stock-keeping unit); and the number of SKUs may increase each year. A retail supply chain 
cannot afford occasional order delays or “stock-outs”; this it leads to lost sales and raises the risk 
of sending customers to the competition. Vendor-managed inventory (VMI) systems, one of EDI’s 
applications, shorten the replenishment cycle and ensure that accurate and timely information is 
passed on electronically at every stage of the fulfillment cycle by streamlining direct store delivery 
GXS is one of the leaders in 
EDI technology (http://edi 
.gxs.com).

and lowering delivery and labor costs. This ensures that customers always get products when they 
want them (e.g., during promotion events or holidays when demand is very high), yet reduces 
oversupply when demand wanes. Vendor-managed inventory helps retailers strengthen relation-
ships with customers and vendors by reducing check-in times, keeping products stocked consis-
tently, and reducing human errors.17
Many retailers now require potential suppliers to have an EDI solution—either their own or 
via a third-party provider—before they are selected (“onboarded”) as a vendor. Many small and 
medium-sized suppliers and retailers choose cloud-based, third-party EDI solutions for more 
flexibility and faster integration, quicker onboarding of suppliers, reduction of operating costs, 
elimination of manual ordering, and better order management.18 The EDI system is covered further 
in Chapter 15, along with collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment.
THE MARKETING RESEARCH PROCESS
Marketing research in retailing entails the collection and analysis of information relating to 
specific issues or problems facing a retailer. At farsighted firms, marketing research is just one 
element in a retail information system. At others, marketing research may be the only type of data 
gathering and processing.
FIGURE 8-6
Applying UPC Technology to Gain Better Information
Portable UPC scanners are lightweight, highly mobile, and come in various shapes and colors. They all have the same purpose—to 
“read” the information on the UPC label, transmit the data to a computer, compile and store the data, and provide up-to-the-minute 
and detailed reports to retail employees who analyze the data and act accordingly.

PART 3  •  TARGETING CUSTOMERS AND GATHERING INFORMATION
The marketing research process embodies a series of activities: defining the issue or prob-
lem to be studied, examining secondary data, generating primary data (if needed), analyzing 
data, making recommendations, and implementing findings. It is not a single act; rather, it is a 
systematic process. Figure 8-7 outlines the research process. Each activity is done sequentially. 
Secondary data are not examined until after an issue or problem is defined. In Figure 8-7, the 
dashed line around the primary data stage means these data are generated only if secondary data 
do not yield actionable information. The process is described next.
Issue (problem) definition involves a clear statement of the topic to be studied. What infor-
mation does the retailer want to obtain to make a decision? Without clearly knowing the topic to 
be researched, irrelevant and confusing data could be collected. Here are examples of issue defini-
tions for a shoe store. The first one seeks to compare three locations and is fairly structured; the 
second is more open-ended: (1) “Of three potential new store locations, which should we choose?” 
(2) “How can we improve the sales of our men’s shoes?”
When secondary data are involved, a retailer looks at data that have been gathered for 
purposes other than addressing the issue or problem currently under study. Secondary data may 
be internal (such as company records) or external (such as government reports and trade publica-
tions). When primary data are involved, a retailer looks at data that are collected to address the 
specific issue or problem under study. This type of data may be generated via survey, observation, 
experiment, and simulation.
Convenience Store News conducted a study of what time of day people most often visit con-
venience stores. Its 2016 “Realities of the Aisle” consumer research studied 1,501 people who 
shopped at least one time in the prior month. By the time you read this, the data in Table 8-1 will 
be secondary data in nature.19
Secondary data are sometimes relied on; other times, primary data are crucial. In some cases, 
both are gathered. It is important that retailers keep these points in mind: (1) There is great diver-
sity in the possible types of data collection (and in the costs). (2) Only data relevant to the issue 
being studied should be collected. (3) Primary data are usually acquired only if secondary data are 
inadequate (thus, the dashed box in Figure 8-7). Both secondary and primary data are described 
further in the next sections.

CHAPTER 8   •  Information Gathering and Processing in Retailing	
223	
These kinds of secondary and primary data can be gathered for the shoe store issues recently 
stated:
Issue (Problem) Definition
Information Needed to Solve Issue (Problem)
1. Which store location?
1. Data on access to transportation, traffic, con-
sumer profiles, rent, store size, and types of 
competition are gathered from government 
reports, trade publications, and observation by 
the owner for each of the three potential store 
locations.
2. How to improve sales of shoes?
2. Store sales records for the past 5 years by product 
category are gathered. A consumer survey in a 
nearby mall is conducted.
After data are collected, data analysis is performed to assess that information and relate it to 
the defined issue. Alternative solutions are also clearly outlined. For example:
Issue (Problem) Definition
Alternative Solutions
1. Which store location?
1. Each site is ranked for all the criteria (access to 
transportation, traffic, consumer profiles, rent, 
store size, and types of competition).
2. How to improve sales of shoes?
2. Alternative strategies to boost sales are analyzed 
and ranked.
At this point, the pros and cons of each alternative are enumerated. See Table 8-2. Rec-
ommendations are then made as to the best strategy for the firm. Of the available options, 
which is best? Table 8-2 also shows recommendations for the shoe-store issues discussed in 
this section.
Last, but not least, the recommended strategy is implemented. If research is to replace intu-
ition in strategic retailing, a decision maker must follow the recommendations from research 
studies, even if those results seem to contradict his or her own ideas.
Let’s now look at secondary data and primary data in greater depth.

PART 3  •  TARGETING CUSTOMERS AND GATHERING INFORMATION
Secondary Data
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES  Secondary data have several advantages:
▶
▶Data assembly is inexpensive. Company records, trade journals, and government publications 
are all rather low cost. No data collection forms, interviewers, and tabulations are needed.
▶
▶Data can be gathered quickly. Company records, library sources, and Web sites can be 
accessed immediately. Many firms store reports in their retail information systems.
▶
▶There may be several sources of secondary data—with many perspectives.
▶
▶A secondary source may possess information that would otherwise be unavailable to the 
retailer. Government publications often have statistics no private firm could acquire.
▶
▶When data are assembled by a source such as Progressive Grocer, Nielsen, Stores, or the 
government, results are usually quite credible.
▶
▶The retailer may have only a rough idea of the topics to investigate. Secondary data can then 
help define issues more specifically. In addition, background information about a given issue 
can be gathered from secondary sources before undertaking a primary study.
Secondary data also have several potential disadvantages:
▶
▶Available data may not suit the purposes of the current study because they have been collected 
for other reasons. Neighborhood statistics may not be found in secondary sources.
▶
▶Secondary data may be incomplete. A service station owner would want car data broken 
down by year, model, and mileage driven, so as to stock parts. A motor vehicle bureau could 
provide data on the models but not the mileage driven.
▶
▶Information may be dated. Statistics gathered every 2 to 5 years may not be valid today. The 
U.S. Census of Retail Trade is conducted every 5 years. Furthermore, there is often a time 
delay between the completion of a census and the release of information.
▶
▶The accuracy of secondary data must be carefully reviewed. A retailer needs to decide if 
the data have been compiled in an unbiased way. The purpose of the research, the data col-
lection tools, and the method of analysis should each be examined—if they are available 
for review.
▶
▶Some secondary data sources are known for poor data collection methods; they should 
be avoided. When data conflict, the source with the best reputation for accuracy should be 
used.
▶
▶In retailing, many secondary data projects are not retested and the user of secondary data has 
to hope results from one narrow study are applicable to his or her firm.
Whether secondary data resolve an issue or not, their low cost and availability require that 
primary data not be amassed until after studying secondary data. Only if secondary data are not 
actionable should primary data be collected. We now cite secondary data sources for retailers.
SOURCES  There are many sources and types of secondary data. The major distinctions are 
between internal and external sources.
Internal secondary data are available within the company, sometimes from the data bank 
of a retail information system. Before searching for external secondary data or primary data, the 
retailer should look at information available inside the firm.
Through Public Register 
Online (www 
.annualreportservice 
.com), a retailer can learn 
about other firms around 
the globe. Get an annual 
report here. (A free login is 
required.)
Many large retailers have experimented with mobile beacons in 
stores to deliver highly targeted promotions and collect data on 
customer purchase journeys. Understanding how beacon tech-
nology works and what customers can do to protect identifiable 
information is required. Beacons use battery-powered Bluetooth 
Low Energy transmitters to send static pieces of data within a 
short distance (a few inches to 35 feet) to receivers (typically, 
a customer’s smartphone app). The typical beacon promotion 
or message consists of an alphanumeric code identifying the 
retailer), a major ID (particular store of the retailer), minor ID 
(unique for every location within a store), and coded promo-
tion messages. Beacons cannot transmit or collect data or track 
customers if the customer does not have the retailer’s app on a 
smartphone or it is turned off.
How should retailers best use beacons?

TECHNOLOGY IN RETAILING

	
CHAPTER 8   •  Information Gathering and Processing in Retailing	
225	
At the beginning of the year, most retailers forecast and develop budgets for the next 12 
months. This helps outline planned spending for that year. A firm’s prior budget and its success 
in reaching budgetary goals are good sources of secondary data in forming a new budget.
Retailers use sales and profit-and-loss reports to judge performance. Many have data from 
electronic registers that can be studied by store, department, and item. By comparing data with 
prior periods, a firm gets a sense of growth or contraction. Overdependence on sales data may be 
misleading. Sales should be examined along with profit-and-loss data to indicate strengths and 
weaknesses in operations and management and to help lead to improvements.
Through customer billing reports, a retailer learns about inventory movement, sales by dif-
ferent personnel, and sales volume. For credit customers, sales by location, repayment time, and 
types of purchases can be reviewed. Purchase invoices show the retailer’s own buying history and 
enables the retailer to evaluate itself against budgetary goals. See Figure 8-8.
Inventory records indicate the merchandise carried throughout the year and the turnover 
of these items. Knowing the lead time to place and receive orders from suppliers, as well as 
the extra inventory kept on hand to prevent running out at different times over the year, aids 
planning.
If a firm does primary research, the resultant report should be kept for future use (hopefully in 
the retail information system). When used initially, a report involves primary data. Later reference 
to it is secondary in nature since the report is no longer used for its primary purpose.
Written reports on performance are another source of internal secondary data. They may be 
prepared and filed by senior executives, buyers, sales personnel, or others. All phases of retail 
management can be improved through formal report procedures.

PART 3  •  TARGETING CUSTOMERS AND GATHERING INFORMATION
External secondary data are available from sources outside the firm. They should be con-
sulted if internal information is insufficient for a decision to be made on a defined issue. These 
sources are comprised of government and nongovernment categories.
To use external secondary data well, appropriate online databases should be consulted. They 
contain all kinds of written materials, usually by subject or topic heading, for a specified time. 
Here are several databases, chosen for their retailing relevance. They are typically available 
through the Internet (for online access, you must use your company, college, or local library Web 
connection—direct entry to the sites is password-protected):
▶
▶Academic Search Premier/EBSCOhost
▶
▶Business Source Premier/EBSCOhost
▶
▶Dow Jones Factiva
▶
▶Gale’s Business & Company Resource Center
▶
▶Gale Virtual Reference Library
▶
▶Ingenta Connect
▶
▶LexisNexis Academic Universe
▶
▶Mergent Online
▶
▶Plunkett Research Online
▶
▶Standard & Poor’s NetAdvantage
The government distributes many materials. Here are publications chosen for their retailing 
value. They are available in a business library or other large library or through the Web:
▶
▶Annual Retail Trade Survey
▶
▶Consumer Expenditure Survey (Quarterly)
▶
▶U.S. Census of Retail Trade (Every 5 years ending in 2 and 7)
▶
▶U.S. Census of Service Industries (Every 5 years ending in 2 and 7)
▶
▶Monthly Retail Trade and Food Services Sales
▶
▶U.S. Survey of Current Business
▶
▶Other (Registration data such as births, deaths, automobile registrations, etc. Available 
through federal, state, and local agencies.)
Government agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission, provide online pamphlets on 
topics such as franchising, unit pricing, deceptive ads, and credit policies. The Small Business 
Administration provides smaller retailers with online literature and advice. Pamphlets are distrib-
uted free or sold for a nominal fee.
Nongovernment secondary data come from many sources, often cited in reference guides. 
Major nongovernment sources are regular periodicals; books, monographs, and other nonregular 
publications; channel members; and commercial research houses.
Regular periodicals are available at most libraries or by personal subscription. A growing 
number are also available online; some Web sites provide free information, whereas others charge 
a fee. Periodicals may have a broad scope (such as Fortune) and discuss diverse business topics, 
or they may be narrower (such as Chain Store Age) and deal mostly with retail topics.
Many firms publish books, monographs, and other nonregular retailing materials. Some, such 
as Pearson Higher Education (www.pearsonhighered.com), have textbooks and practitioner books. 
The American Marketing Association (www.ama.org) offers information to enhance readers’ busi-
ness knowledge. The Better Business Bureau (www.bbb.org) wants to improve the public’s image 
of business and expand industry self-regulation. The International Franchise Association (www 
.franchise.org) and the National Retail Federation (www.nrf.com) describe industry practices and 
trends, and they act as spokespersons to advocate the best interests of members. Other associations 
can be uncovered by consulting Gale’s Encyclopedia of Associations.
Retailers may also get information from channel partners such as ad agencies, franchise 
operators, manufacturers, and wholesalers. When those firms do research for their own purposes 
and offer some or all of the findings to their retailers, external secondary data are involved. Chan-
nel partners pass on findings to enhance their own sales and retailer relations. They usually do 
not charge for the information.
The last external source is the commercial research house that conducts ongoing studies and makes 
results available to many clients for a fee. This source is secondary if the retailer is a subscriber and does 
not request tailored studies. Information Resources Inc., Nielsen, and Standard Rate & Data Service 
provide subscriptions at lower costs than a retailer would incur if data were collected only for its use.

CHAPTER 8   •  Information Gathering and Processing in Retailing	
227	
Our blog (www.bermanevansretail.com) has posts on online sources of free external second-
ary data—both government and nongovernment.
Primary Data
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES  After exhausting available secondary data, a defined issue 
may still be unresolved. In this instance, primary data (collected to resolve a specific topic at hand) 
are needed. When secondary data are sufficient, primary data are not collected. There are several 
advantages associated with primary data:
▶
▶They are collected to fit the retailer’s specific purpose.
▶
▶Information is current.
▶
▶The units of measure and data categories are designed for the issue being studied.
▶
▶The firm either collects data itself or hires an outside party. The source is known and con-
trolled, and the methodology is constructed for the specific study.
▶
▶There are no conflicting data from different sources.
▶
▶When secondary data do not resolve an issue, primary data are the only alternative.
There are also several possible disadvantages often associated with primary data:
▶
▶They are normally more expensive to obtain than secondary data.
▶
▶Information gathering tends to be more time-consuming.
▶
▶Some types of information cannot be acquired by an individual firm.
▶
▶If only primary data are collected, the perspective may be limited.
▶
▶Irrelevant information may be collected if the issue is not stated clearly enough.
In sum, a retailer has many criteria to weigh when evaluating the use of primary data. In par-
ticular, specificity, currency, and reliability must be balanced against high costs, time, and limited 
access to materials. A variety of primary data sources for retailers are discussed next.
SOURCES  The first decision is to determine who collects the data. A retailer can do this itself 
(internal) or hire a research firm (external). Internal collection is usually quicker and cheaper. 
External collection is usually more objective and formal. Second, a sampling method is specified. 
Instead of gathering data from all stores, all products, and all customers, a retailer may obtain accu-
rate data by studying a sample of them. This saves time and money. With a probability (random) 
sample, every store, product, or customer has an equal or known chance of being chosen for study. 
In a nonprobability sample, stores, products, or customers are chosen by the researcher—based 
on judgment or convenience. A probability sample is more accurate but is also more costly and 
complex. Third, the retailer chooses among four methods of data collection: survey, observation, 
experiment, and simulation. All of the methods are capable of generating data for each element 
of a strategy.
SURVEY  With a survey, information is systematically gathered from respondents by communicat-
ing with them. Surveys are used in many retail settings. In a low-key, interactive manner, Sunglass 
Hut surveys its shoppers and encourages them to share their experiences through an interactive 
device known as Social Sun. Food Lion uses in-store surveys to learn how satisfied customers are 
and what their attitudes are on various subjects.
A survey may be conducted in person, over the phone, by mail, or online. Typically, a ques-
tionnaire is used. A personal survey is face-to-face, flexible, and able to elicit lengthy responses; 
unclear questions can be explained. It may be costly, and interviewer bias is possible. A phone sur-
vey is fast and rather inexpensive. Responses are often short, and nonresponse may be a problem. 
A mail survey can reach a wide range of respondents, has no interviewer bias, and is not costly. 
Slow returns, high nonresponse rates, and participation by incorrect respondents are potential 
problems. An online survey is interactive, can be adapted to individuals, and yields quick results. 
Yet, only certain customers shop online or answer online surveys. The technique chosen depends 
on the goals and requirements of the research project.
A survey may be nondisguised or disguised. In a nondisguised survey, the respondent is told 
the real purpose of the study. In a disguised survey, the respondent is not told the true purpose 
so that person does not answer what he or she thinks a firm wants to hear. Disguised surveys 
use word associations, sentence completions, and projective questions (such as, “Do your friends 
like shopping at this store?”). See Table 8-3.

PART 3  •  TARGETING CUSTOMERS AND GATHERING INFORMATION
The semantic differential—a listing of bipolar adjective scales—is a survey format that 
may be disguised or nondisguised. A respondent is asked to rate one or more retailers on several 
criteria, each evaluated by bipolar adjectives (such as unfriendly–friendly). By computing the 
average rating of all respondents for each criterion, an overall profile emerges. Figure 8-9 shows 
a semantic differential comparing two furniture retailers. Retailer A is a prestigious, high-quality 
store and retailer B is a mid-quality, family-run store. The semantic differential graphically por-
trays their images.
OBSERVATION  The form of research in which present behavior or the results of past behavior 
are noted and recorded is known as observation. Because people are not questioned, observation 
may not require respondent cooperation, and survey biases are minimized. Observation may be 
used in real situations. The key disadvantage of observation is that attitudes are not elicited.

CHAPTER 8   •  Information Gathering and Processing in Retailing	
229	
Retailers use observation to determine the quality of sales presentations (by having research-
ers pose as shoppers), to monitor related-item buying, to determine store activity by time and day, 
to make pedestrian and vehicular traffic counts (to measure the potential of new locations), and to 
determine the proportion of patrons using mass transit.
With mystery shoppers, retailers or their market research partners hire people to pose as 
customers and observe a service or a brand through visits, telephone calls, or Web site interactions. 
These mystery shoppers may evaluate operations, customer service experience, compliance with 
service standards, product availability, price, service calls, sales presentations, and how well store 
environments and displays are maintained. Some firms prefer video mystery shopping to address 
complex and challenging aspects of a service business.20
Observation may be disguised or nondisguised, structured or unstructured, direct or indirect, 
and human or mechanical. In disguised observation, the shopper or company employee is not 
aware he or she is being watched by a two-way mirror or hidden camera. In nondisguised obser-
vation, the participant knows he or she is being observed—such as a department manager watch-
ing a cashier’s behavior. Structured observation calls for the observer to note specific behavior. 
Unstructured observation requires the observer to note all of the activities of the person being 
studied. With direct observation, the observer watches people’s present behavior. With indirect 
observation, the observer examines evidence of past behavior, such as food products in consumer 
pantries. Human observation is carried out by people. It may be disguised, but the observer may 
enter biased notations and overlook behavior. Mechanical observation, such as a camera filming 
in-store shopping, eliminates viewer bias and does not miss behavior.
EXPERIMENT  An experiment is a type of research in which one or more elements of a retail 
­strategy mix are manipulated under controlled conditions. An element may be a price, a shelf 
display, store hours, or some other feature. If a retailer wants to find the effects of a price change 
on sales, only one item’s price is varied. Other strategic elements (location, quantity, etc.) stay the 
same, so the true price effect is measured.
An experiment may use survey or observation techniques to record data. In a survey, ques-
tions are asked about the experiment: Did you buy Brand Z because of its new shelf display? Are 
you buying more ice cream because it’s on sale? In observation, behavior is watched during the 
experiment: Sales of Brand Z rise by 20 percent when a new display is used. Ice cream sales go 
up 25 percent during a special sale.
Surveys and observations are experimental if they occur under controlled situations. When 
surveys ask broad attitude questions or unstructured behavior is observed, experiments are not 
involved. Experimentation can be difficult because many uncontrollable factors (such as weather, 
competition, and the economy) come into play. A well-controlled experiment yields good data.
The major advantage is an experiment’s ability to show cause and effect (a lower price results 
in higher sales). It is also systematically structured and enacted. The major potential disadvantages 
are high costs, contrived settings, and uncontrollable factors.
SIMULATION  A type of experiment whereby a computer program is used to manipulate the 
­elements of a retail strategy mix rather than test them in a real setting is called simulation. Two 
A large-scale study of shopping behavior in the Netherlands 
found that Dutch consumers pursue different paths in the 
purchase journey—getting information, making a purchase, 
receiving delivery, and returning goods—based on the prod-
uct purchased. Fifty-three percent of food shoppers relied 
on product information only in the store. In contrast, 17 per-
cent of electronics product customers used store information 
exclusively. Customers utilize different retail formats to make 
purchases. Eighty-four percent made grocery purchases only 
in stores, compared with 59 percent of electronics purchases. 
Seventy-six percent of grocery purchases were picked up in 
the store versus 46 percent for electronic travel items. Last, 
70 percent of grocery returns are in-store versus 48 percent of 
electronics returns.
Discuss the impact of these findings on an electronics retailer 
pursuing an omnichannel retail strategy.

Studying a Consumer’s Purchase Journey

230	
PART 3  •  TARGETING CUSTOMERS AND GATHERING INFORMATION
kinds of simulation are now being applied in retail settings: those based on mathematical models 
and those involving “virtual reality.”
In the first kind of simulation, a model of the expected controllable and uncontrollable retail 
environment is constructed. Factors—such as effects of a price cut or longer store hours—are 
manipulated by computer (rather than the marketplace) so their effect on the overall strategy and 
specific elements of it are determined. No consumer cooperation is needed, and combinations 
of factors can be analyzed in a controlled, rapid, inexpensive, and risk-free manner. This format 
is gaining popularity as reliable software is increasingly available. However, it is still somewhat 
difficult to use.
In the second kind of simulation, a retailer devises or buys interactive software that lets 
participants simulate actual behavior in as realistic a format as possible. This approach creates a 
“virtual shopping environment.” For example, Facebook’s Oculus Rift VR headset now makes it 
possible to render virtual shopping environments at lower costs; and the glasses can be enhanced 
with eye-tracking capability to make it an efficient shopper research tool. SMI studies on the 
virtual shopper journey using EEGs (which test the electrical activity of the brain) have had par-
ticipants use eye-tracking and real-time consumer behavior in a virtual setting to assess the impact 
of in-store campaigns on buying decisions and how consumers interact with merchandise displays 
and package design before deciding to buy. Participants virtually interact with signs and prod-
ucts displayed in the VR headset as a natural experience; findings can be used to devise real-life 
store campaigns. The simulated space can easily compare several conditions (A/B testing) of 
in-store campaigns and shelf placements.21
1.	 To discuss how information flows in a retail distribution 
channel. In an effective retail distribution channel, infor-
mation flows freely and efficiently among the three main 
parties (supplier, retailer, and consumer). As a result, 
the parties can better anticipate and address each other’s 
performance expectations. Retailers often have a vital 
role in collecting data because they have the most direct 
contact with shoppers.
2.	 To show why retailers should avoid strategies based 
on inadequate information. Whether developing a new 
strategy or modifying an existing one, good data are nec-
essary to reduce a retailer’s chances of making incor-
rect decisions. Retailers that rely on nonsystematic or 
incomplete research, such as intuition, increase their 
probabilities of failure.
3.	 To look at the retail information system, its compo-
nents, and the recent advances in such systems. Use-
ful information should be acquired through an ongoing, 
well-integrated process. A retail information system 
anticipates the data needs of retail managers; continu-
ously collects, organizes, and stores relevant data; and 
directs the flow of information to decision makers. Such 
a system has several components: environment, retailer’s 
philosophy, strategic plans, information control center, 
and retail operations. The most important component is 
the information control center. It directs data collection, 
stores and retrieves data, and updates files.
Database management is used to collect, integrate, 
apply, and store information related to specific topics 
(such as customers, vendors, and product categories). 
Database information can come from internal (company-
generated) and external (purchased from outside firms) 
sources. A key advance in database management is data 
warehousing, whereby copies of all the databases in a 
firm are kept in one location and can be accessed by 
employees at any locale. It is a huge repository separate 
from the operational databases that support departmental 
applications. Through data mining and micromarketing, 
retailers use data warehouses to pinpoint the specific 
needs of customer segments.
Retailers have increased the use of computerized 
retail information systems, and the Universal Product 
Code (UPC) is the dominant technology for processing 
product-related data. With electronic data interchange 
(EDI) and Internet electronic data interchange (I-EDI), 
the computers of retailers and suppliers regularly 
exchange information, sometimes through the Web.
4.	 To describe the marketing research process. Marketing 
research in retailing involves these sequential activi-
ties: defining the issue or problem to be researched, 
examining secondary data, gathering primary data (if 
needed), analyzing the data, making recommendations, 
and implementing findings. It is systematic in nature and 
not a single act.
Secondary data (gathered for other purposes) are 
inexpensive, can be collected quickly, may have several 
sources, and may yield otherwise unattainable informa-
tion. Some sources are very credible. When an issue is 
ill defined, a secondary data search can clarify it. There

are also potential pitfalls: These data may not suit the 
purposes of the study, units of measurement may not be 
specific enough, information may be old or inaccurate, a 
source may be disreputable, and data may not be reliable.
Primary data (gathered to resolve the specific topic 
at hand) are collected if secondary data do not ade-
quately address the issue. They are precise and current, 
data are collected and categorized with the units of 
measures desired, the methodology is known, there 
are no conflicting results, and the level of reliability 
can be determined. When secondary data do not exist, 
primary data are the only option. The potential dis-
advantages are the cost, time, limited access, narrow 
perspective, and amassing of irrelevant information.

Questions for Discussion
1.	 Relate the information flows in Figure 8-2 to a bakery 
near your college or university.
2.	 Why is gathering and analyzing information crucial to 
a retailer that is launching a new strategy or modifying 
an existing one?
3.	 What information does a customer actually demand 
from a retailer?
4.	 What information could a retailer supply to other chan-
nel members?
5.	 In database management, a retailer gathers, integrates, 
applies, and stores information related to specific 
subject areas. Outline how this should be carried out. 
What are the information sources? Provide detailed 
examples.
6.	 One application of data mining is micromarketing. What 
is micromarketing, and how might a retailer use it?
7.	 Cite the major advantages and disadvantages of second-
ary data.
8.	 As a fitness club owner, what kinds of secondary data 
would you use to learn more about your industry and 
consumer trends in working out?
9.	 Cite the benefit of each primary data method: survey, 
observation, experiment, and simulation.
10.	 Develop a 10-item semantic differential for a local furni-
ture store to judge its image. Who should be surveyed? 
Why?
11.	 Why would a retailer use mystery shoppers rather than 
other forms of observation? Are there any instances 
when you would not recommend their use? Why or why 
not?
12.	 Why do you think “virtual shopping” has not taken off 
faster as a research tool for retailers?
Web-Based Exercise
One of the key strategic issues facing traditional retailers 
is failing to have an effective plan to provide an “always 
open” environment. Customers demand an “always open” 
retailer. How is this being handled in your country?  
Use the Internet to identify solutions being used by 
retailers.

PART 3  •  TARGETING CUSTOMERS AND GATHERING INFORMATION
Short Cases
Case 1: Eating Patterns in America*
Household changes will shape the future of eating for years 
to come. The “typical” U.S. consumer and the households in 
which they live are very different from those of 20 years ago. 
The changes are reflected across the spectrum of eating patterns 
today—who, what, when, where, how, and why.
Single-person U.S. households are 38 million strong and 
growing—the highest in history—This represents 55 percent 
of all adult only households. The typical size of an American 
family is 2.5 persons per household, with more than one-quarter 
with children headed by single moms. Smaller households, in 
many cases, are a long-term choice for adults choosing not to 
be married and/or have fewer children. This change has wide-
ranging implications for retailers and manufacturers in terms of 
marketing, merchandising, new product development, packag-
ing, and positioning.
By 2044, the U.S. Census Bureau projects that more than 
one-half of Americans will be in a minority group; by 2060, 
nearly one in five of the total population is projected to be 
foreign-born. The Hispanic population has accounted for more 
than half of the 27-million U.S. population increase in the last 
decade. Hispanics currently represent 18 percent of the total 
U.S. population. Although Hispanics will continue to be a very 
large and growing group, Asians are one of the fastest-growing 
ethnic populations, currently representing 8 percent of the U.S. 
population.
The Millennial generation is more diverse than the preced-
ing generations, with 44 percent being part of a minority race 
or ethnic group. Even more diverse than Millennials are the 
youngest Americans—those younger than 5 years of age. In 
2014, this group became majority-minority for the first time, 
with 50 percent being part of a minority race or ethnic group.
The share of the U.S. population that is considered middle 
income has been shrinking over the last four decades. In the 
past, those in the middle-income group typically moved up

into higher income levels; today, however, the opposite is true. 
Declining or stagnant wages, coupled with a growing income 
gap during the past 15 years, have resulted in many families 
slipping out of the middle class.
If past trends continue, it’s unlikely that recovery from the 
Great Recession will lead to a rebound in the share of adults in 
middle-income households. Since the middle class has fueled 
spending on everything from housing to cars to food purchas-
ing, a smaller middle class has a wide-ranging impact on the 
economy. See Figure 1.
This overview presents just a few of the changing con-
sumer dynamics that will shape the retail marketplace in the 
future—both near and long term. Retailers need to be aware of 
changes in consumer behaviors in order to modify their market-
ing tactics and strategies, and to meet the needs and wants of 
today’s consumers.
Questions
1.	 According to the information in the case, how are American 
demographics changing?
2.	 As a supermarket retailer, how would you address the rise 
in U.S. single-person households?
3.	 As a local gift shop, how would you address the rise of 
Hispanics in the United States?
4.	 What are the implications of Figure 1 for retailers?
5.	 What demographic trends not mentioned in this case should 
retailers address? How?
Case 2: The Convenience Economy Comes of 
Age*
Among the transformations on the retail landscape in the recent 
past, perhaps none was more profound than proliferation of the 
“convenience economy,” in which everything is at the consum-
er’s disposal at the click of a button, according to Chris Bryson, 
CEO of Unata, a leading omnicommerce solutions provider. He

The share of adults who live in middle-income 
households has eroded over time from 61 percent 
in 1970 to 51 percent in 2013, according to a Pew

caused many families to slip out of the middle class.

states, “2015 was the year UberX went from a smaller, unknown 
player to a force driving change across sectors. We’re at a point 
where new business ideas are often described as ‘Uber for      .”’
The convenience economy’s biggest shift, Bryson says, 
“came when major players like Starbucks started embracing it 
with the “Order Ahead mobile app,” which has led to “wide-
spread adoption of this kind of immediate customer transaction, 
and reinforced the need for quick and convenient service on a 
daily basis,” and with it, a huge shift in consumer expectations 
across all sectors.
Retailers of all stripes “are suddenly playing catchup, 
learning how they can incorporate real-time, on-demand trans-
actions into their strategies,” notes Bryson, who founded Unata 
in 2011. The company’s roster of grocery clients includes 
Longo’s, Grocery Gateway, Lowes Foods, Lunds and Byerlys, 
and Raley’s. When asked to elaborate on some examples of the 
convenience economy now catching his eye, and which are the 
most important, Bryson ticks off a shortlist of standouts, includ-
ing the following.
▶
▶UberX/UberEATS: “Consumers don’t have to call to order 
their car/food, take out their wallets to pay, or wait very 
long for their car/food to arrive. They can watch the driver 
travel and arrive live on a map, with the ability to commu-
nicate with their driver at the click of a button.”
▶
▶Starbucks: “The Order Ahead app is simple and easy to 
use, and saves the customer minutes on a daily basis—
which becomes especially valuable on rushed mornings. 
They are reinforcing this type of customer experience on 
a daily basis.”
▶
▶Ritual: “This is a Toronto-based app—expanding in the 
United States—that lets consumers order lunch ahead of 
time from various restaurants near their location. The app 
notifies consumers exactly when they should leave their 
current locale so they arrive at the restaurant just when 
food is ready for pickup, ensuring the food remains as hot 
and fresh as possible. Ritual is a simple and clean user 
experience that lets customers order food in a couple of 
clicks and saves them 5 to 10 minutes a day of waiting 
time.”
▶
▶Amazon Echo and Dash with Prime: “With both Amazon 
Echo and Dash, consumers don’t have to write a shopping 
list, go to their computers, or even pull out their phones to 
make an order, or take out their wallets to pay. With Dash 
buttons, they can order at the click of one button; and with 
Echo, Amazon has taken the click out entirely. It’s the easi-
est possible way for consumers to online shop. Combined 
with Amazon Prime, consumers don’t have to wait long to 
get things that they’ve ordered.”
Although it’s still unclear what the shopper of the future 
will find the most convenient way to shop for groceries, Bryson 
says, “The convenience economy so far tells us that the fewer 
clicks needed, the more adoption there will be, which is why 
we have our eye on Amazon Echo. We’ve seen how quickly 
Uber has changed the landscape, and we expect it to continue 
to change just as quickly in ways we don’t yet know over the 
next few years. Retailers need to focus on setting up their sys-
tems so they can easily flex, adapt, iterate, and connect with 
new systems.”

Case 3: Are Hot Retailers of 2015 Still Hot?*
Differentiation is important for the nation’s fastest-growing 
(“hot”) retailers. These retailers typically come in a variety of 
different flavors, but one thing they have in common is that they 
all do things a little differently—and this helps them get (and 
often) stay ahead of the pack.
Chart-topper Hudson’s Bay is “hot” because at least one 
man in retailing thinks there is still a place for the traditional 
department store. Hudson’s Bay Executive Chairman Richard 
Baker, who bought Lord & Taylor 9 years ago, has assembled 
a conglomerate operating in three countries on two continents.
Runner-up NoMoreRack.com, founded in November 2010 
and offering deep discounts on an array of general merchandise, 
was rebranded as Choxi in 2015 after Nordstrom objected to 
its name (due to possible confusion with its Nordstrom Rack 
off-price division). The new name is a mixture of “chock full” 
and “choice.” It is not a real word in any language — which can 
assist a firm expanding globally.
Number 3, Zulily, has elevated the flash sale model to new 
heights. The company’s early strength was in infant clothing, 
toys, and accessories with a very strict no-returns policy. In May 
2015, Zulily began a test program that allows some customers 
to return some brands of apparel and home linens.
“The Hot 100 is a mix of companies that have balance 
sheets that allow them to make acquisitions or grow organi-
cally,” explains Bryan Gildenberg, the chief knowledge officer 
at Kantar Retail, providers of the Hot 100 data. “Hot 100 retail-
ers can grow more quickly because they understand why people 
are buying. They understand the dynamics of their audience.”
Among those following the acquisition trail is Number 4, 
G-III Apparel Group. Best known as a soft-goods vendor to 
major department and specialty stores, it also operates its own 
retail stores under the Wilsons Leather, Bass, G. H. Bass & Co., 
Vilebrequin, and Calvin Klein Performance banners.
Ranking as Number 5 is Wayfair, the umbrella company 
for five different home furnishings and décor E-commerce 
brands. The firm had a particularly good holiday selling season 
2 years ago, with the active customers in its direct retail busi-
ness reaching 3.2 million at year-end, up 54 percent from a 
year earlier.
Two years ago, Number 7 on the list, Office Depot pur-
chased a major rival in OfficeMax and not too long afterward 
put itself in position to be taken over by Staples, potentially 
reducing the number of office supply superstore operators to 
just one. If the Staples takeover cleared regulatory hurdled, Wall

PART 3  •  TARGETING CUSTOMERS AND GATHERING INFORMATION
Street analysts said they expected at least 1,000 office supply 
stores to be closed around the country. (Authors’ note: Due to 
U.S. government objections, the two companies called off their 
merger in early 2016. For both firms, their physical stores are 
vulnerable to online retailers such as Amazon.com.)
Both Number 8, Signet Jewelers, and Number 9, Men’s 
Wearhouse, acquired major rivals in Zale and JoS. A. Bank, 
respectively. Signet has put together the only national group 
of mall-based popular-priced jewelry stores, and Men’s Wear-
house has achieved pretty much the same among men’s apparel 
retailers after turning the tables on JoS. A. Bank, which had 
tried to take over Men’s Wearhouse.
Together, supermarkets and apparel stores account for 
nearly half of the Hot 100 entries. Most of the Hot 100 super-
markets have “core categories that are growing very quickly,” 
Gildenberg says, such as an emphasis on natural and organic 
foods or a store full of ethnic products.

Case 4: Navigating the Shopper Universe through 
Big Data*
Taking on the challenge of understanding the motivations 
behind why shoppers buy what they buy, and how they buy it, 
could pay off in manifold ways. “There are lifestyle tensions 
that impact shopping behavior for each shopper segment, but 
these tensions often extend beyond the store: time stress, finan-
cial pressure, and information overload,” explains John Esse-
gian, executive vice-president at TNS Global. “Retailers can 
increase their market share with each segment by understanding 
and addressing these important lifestyle tensions.”
TNS Shopper Universe is a large syndicated database 
that maps competition for Grocery, Mass/Supercenter, Club, 
Convenience, Dollar Store, Drug, Natural/Organic, Pet, and 
Home Improvement retailers. It shows how shoppers perceive 
the marketplace, shopper segmentation for targeting, and occa-
sion-based need segmentation detailing what’s most motivat-
ing to shoppers on each trip. The database provides retailers 
and manufacturers with a comprehensive understanding of this 
broad marketplace, and the key drivers of choice for shoppers.
“Shoppers’ functional needs are generally well met,” 
Essegian says. “Yet, opportunities exist to engage shoppers 
more emotionally, such as helping them simplify their lives, 
leveraging modern technology, and creating a more experien-
tial shopping trip.” TNS identifies nine occasion-based need 
states. Just over half of shopping trips, defined by consumer 
needs, are more experience-driven, whereas the rest tend to be 
task-focused.
Experience-Driven Needs 
The experience-focused need states break down as follows: (1) 
Smart Fami1y Fun: These consumers want shopping to be fun, 
relaxing, and productive (so they can take care of family needs). 
They expect enjoyment to be facilitated by technology aids, a 
convenient and pleasant in-store experience, and good value. 
(2) Only the Best: Needs on these shopping trips are for top-tier 
brands, often outside the mainstream, including fresh, healthy, 
and natural products. (3) Rewarding Experience: This shop-
ping is uplifting and inspiring, thanks to the combination of the 
retailer’s values, great staff, and interesting and unique prod-
ucts. (4) Food Safari: Shoppers want this kind of trip to be more 
than just stocking up on staples; they want a little adventure and 
exploration. It’s a chance to try new and different products such 
as exotic, gourmet, organic, and healthy items.
Task-Driven Needs 
Task-focused need states shake out as follows: (1) Weekly Gro-
cery Shopping: These shoppers want every item their family 
needs for the week under one roof. The store needs to have a 
wide selection of packaged and fresh food items. This shopper 
looks to coupons and quality store brands to help stay on bud-
get. (2) Hassle-Free Value: The shopping trip should be easy 
and efficient, providing good deals and incentives while cov-
ering all brand needs, from premium to quality store brands. 
(3) Personal Care Plus: These shoppers are looking for a store 
with a good selection of personal care and household items that 
they can shop at any time of the day or night. They also want a 
good selection of snacks and beverages. (4) All-Around Value: 
These shoppers want a place for stocking up and bargain hunt-
ing, with everyday low prices, great specials, and economical 
package sizes. Hours should be convenient, and it should be a 
place that kids enjoy. (5) Grab and Go: This is about fulfilling 
an immediate need to quickly and easily grab a snack, beverage, 
or fill-in item at a store located on the shopper’s normal route.
Most generalists, such as grocery, mass, and club retailers, 
have an incentive to align to both task-driven and experiential 
need states. Specialty stores tend to be more associated with 
experiential shopping. While each segment participates, to at 
least some degree, more engaged shoppers tend to have more 
experiential needs.

Comprehensive Case
Part 3
How Do You Attract and Satisfy Millennials?*
Introduction
How do you connect with a generation that defies easy 
categorization?
The members of Generation Y (Millennials) have per-
plexed many knowledgeable retailers for more than a decade. 
There is a stereotype that all Millennials are broke 20-some-
things who live with their parents, but that’s only a small seg-
ment of the cohort. Many Millennials are homeowners, married 
with children, and more concerned about their investments and 
saving for college than playing videogames.
If there’s one thing all Millennials have in common, it’s an 
immersion in the digital world. If they weren’t fully born in the 
digital age, they spent formative years and entered early adult-
hood in a rapidly changing environment of phones, computers, 
and devices that connect them to each other and the world.
Large and Diverse
Generation Y will drive the future of retail, and experts say 
retailers’ success will hinge on how they understand and give 
this cohort the experience it desires. Millennials, roughly 
defined as those born between the early 1980s and the late 
1990s, have surpassed Baby Boomers as the largest gen-
eration. The Pew Research Center estimates that there are 
roughly 75 million Americans between the ages of 18 and 
34, and they represent a wide array of characteristics and 
preferences.
Although a younger segment may meet the “broke and 
living at home” stereotype, it doesn’t characterize the genera-
tion as a whole, says researcher Jason Dorsey; all discussions 
around Millennials have to start with knowing their diversity: 
“A [Millennial] could be married in a two-income household 
with two kids or living at home with mom or three roommates. 
You can’t speak to them in the same way!”
A 2015 report by Oracle (the software firm) breaks Mil-
lennials into five different groups:
▶
▶“Up and Comers” represent a diverse group of males with 
high incomes but low awareness levels.
▶
▶“Mavens” are 30-something high earners with a child.
▶
▶“Eclectics” are female free spirits on the lookout for the 
perfect deal and a high level of Amazon awareness.
▶
▶“Skeptics” tend to be gamers focused on social media, sci-
fi films, and fast food.
▶
▶“Trendsetters,” the youngest segment of the generation, 
keep up with the latest and greatest and purchases across a 
wide variety of brands.
Millennials are also the most racially diverse generation, 
with 43 percent identified as non-Caucasian. Multiculturalism 
and a high acceptance of interracial marriage are blurring the 
lines between cultural and racial demographics.
Ryan McConnell, senior vice-president and head of North 
American subscription services for the Futures Company, 
calls the cohort “the Big Blend.” He says categorization along 
the lines of things like race, gender, and sexual orientation is 
disappearing. “If you’re big on categorization, you’re forcing 
people into boxes,” he says, “and that doesn’t bode well among 
Millennials.”
Conflicting data and the complexity of the generation has 
spawned myths about who the Millennials are. A 2013 Accen-
ture report found that the biggest misconceptions related to Mil-
lennials’ preferences in retail were that they only shop online, 
have no loyalty, and treat retailers the same as people on social 
networks. Retailers are discovering, however, that they can be 
the complete opposite.
Unified by Digital
Many Millennials have spent their adulthood ordering goods 
and services, paying their bills, and banking online. They inter-
act with the world through social media; and when it comes to 
retail, they have no tolerance for companies that lag behind in 
technology.
A survey by research firm BI Intelligence found that 40 
percent of Millennials would give up cash completely if they 
could rely on plastic or mobile payments. More than 90 percent 
of those aged 18 to 34 have used a self-service kiosk, according 
to a 2015 study by location-based mobile platform company 
Retale, versus 81 percent of those 35 and older; 72 percent of 
respondents choose self-checkout because they have a limited 
number of items, while 55 percent do so because there is no 
line. Authors’ Note: These numbers do not total to 100 percent 
due to multiple responses.
Interestingly, 20 percent of Millennials (8 percent more 
than other generations) said they choose self-service to avoid 
interacting with cashiers, and yet, the Accenture study found 
that 82 percent of Millennials prefer visiting bricks-and-mortar 
stores.
The 18-to 34-year-olds certainly interact through social 
media. A recent Deloitte (financial consulting) survey found 
that 47 percent use social media while shopping, compared with 
only 19 percent for all other age groups. Another survey by 
Web analytics company SDL revealed Millennials check their 
smartphones an average of 43 times daily, and five out of six 
connect with companies via social media.
Waiting isn’t an option. Same-day delivery would make 64 
percent of Millennials more likely to make a purchase online, 
according to a survey by Coldwell Banker Commercial Affili-
ates, compared with 56 percent of Gen Xers and 40 percent of 
Baby Boomers.
“Time and quality of life can be more important than 
money for Millennials,” says Willy Kruh, global chairman of 
consumer markets at KPMG. “If you don’t grab them in three 
seconds, and if you can’t [provide] next-day delivery, they’re 
gone.”
Millennials are constantly bombarded with so much infor-
mation over so many devices and media that “you have to get 
them with bite-sized information,” he says. “You also have to

PART 3  •  TARGETING CUSTOMERS AND GATHERING INFORMATION
design your Web site in that fashion. They want everything, 
including the [purchase process], to be short and fast.”
Conscientious Consumers
Young people in every generation show an elevated sense of 
idealism, but Millennials have a tendency to put their money 
where their mouth is. Concepts such as social responsibility, 
sustainability, gender equality, and fair trade are more than just 
buzzwords.
A 2015 Nielsen survey revealed three in four Millenni-
als would be willing to pay extra for “sustainable offerings.” 
They’re more likely than other generations to wonder where 
their products come from, how they’re made, and how retailers 
view social issues.
Exclusivity and equality are non-negotiable. Generation Y 
is overwhelmingly progressive, socially liberal, and in favor of 
gay marriage and women’s reproductive rights. “If you are put-
ting out a message that you are not open for everyone, if you’re 
not accepting of different cultures, different lifestyles, and dif-
ferent ways of being, then there’s going to be a real problem” 
for retailers, says Ryan McConnell.
A brand survey by digital ad agency Moosylvania revealed 
that the top five Millennial brands in 2015 were Nike, Apple, 
Samsung, Sony, and Walmart. Of respondents to that survey, 
40 percent said social responsibility played into their criteria, 
whereas 39 percent said the company “shared similar interests.”
A Pew survey on demographics also found Millennials 
are less anchored to traditional institutions. Nearly 30 percent 
claim to have no religious affiliation, compared with 21 percent 
of Gen Xers and 16 percent of Baby Boomers. On the issue 
of politics, 50 percent consider themselves to be independent, 
compared with 39 percent of Gen Xers and 37 percent of Baby 
Boomers.
Millennials place more emphasis on happiness and experi-
ence than on possessions. The generation is leading the “sharing 
economy” through things such as peer-to-peer lending, crowd-
funding, and companies that rent products or offer short-term 
use. They’re more likely to use services such as Airbnb and 
Uber and sites like Neighborgoods, where consumers can rent 
or borrow products from one another.
Although a PricewaterhouseCoopers study found that only 
44 percent of consumers overall are familiar with the sharing 
economy and just 19 percent have engaged in such a trans-
action, those most excited about the sharing economy once 
they’ve tried it are those aged 18 to 24, households with income 
between $50,000 and $75,000, and those with kids in the house 
under age 18.
Many Millennials have shifted to a more simplistic life-
style; 78 percent of respondents in the PricewaterhouseCoo-
pers report said sharing reduces clutter and waste. “Millennials 
aren’t as into accumulating things,” Willy Kruh states. “They 
don’t see things such as a car as status symbols. They’re much 
happier to lease it or rent it, and that preference is having huge 
reverberations in many industries, including retail.”
PricewaterhouseCoopers reports that “today’s consumers 
are finding more satisfaction and status in experiences, rather 
than static material possessions.” McConnell says Millennials 
tend to worry less about being flashy and more about being 
“authentic.” “They have more value for a minimalist lifestyle 
than [Boomers and Gen Xers]. They realize there’s a burden 
that comes with ownership,” he says.
Because Millennials spend more than any other group on 
leisure activities while seemingly struggling in other aspects of 
life, they’re perceived as bad with money. The reality is they’re 
more apt to pay with available funds than use credit cards, 
according to a study by software firm Segmint. Rob Heiser, 
CEO of Segmint, says Millennials are actually very conscious 
about how they spend their money. “Deeper insights into data 
reveal that many Millennials make spending decisions after 
much research and consideration, rather than impulse.”
Higher Expectations
Christopher Donnelly, senior managing director for retail at 
Accenture, says Millennials are “fundamentally not much dif-
ferent than anyone else, except they like doing things digitally.” 
That digital preference has raised the bar for the customer expe-
rience. Much of the generation has always been able to find out 
anything about any product and order from any merchant in the 
world. A study by SDL revealed that nearly 60 percent of Mil-
lennials surveyed expect to engage with a company whenever 
they choose, by any channel they desire.
Sarah Clark, vice-president of product at Mitek Systems, 
says Millennials are leading the adoption of mobile payment 
in retailing. Mitek’s survey with Zogby Analytics found that 
86 percent of Millennials have used their smartphone to make 
a purchase, with 40 percent having spent $100 or less. Nearly 
one-half of the respondents have made the decision on where 
to shop based on a mobile app’s features and functionality. 
They’d also like to make things even easier, with 68 percent 
saying they’d prefer to always use their smartphone camera for 
a mobile capture instead of manually typing information.
“It’s a wake-up call to retailers to continue to focus on 
the mobile experience,” Clark says. “Making things easier is 
extremely important,” as is adopting new technologies as soon 
as they appear. Retailers that wait for months or years to engage 
in the new ways may be seen as too out of touch. Millennials 
“adapt [to technology] very quickly and they expect that retail-
ers will do the same,” she says.
Loyalty: Embracing Change
Millennials have grown up in a world where loyalty is seem-
ingly going by the wayside. Lifelong careers are gone; Alex-
andra Levit, co-author of a Harris Interactive study about the 
future of Millennials’ careers, said the average Millennial may 
work up to 15 jobs in his or her lifetime.
Futures Company’s Ryan McConnell believes that very 
few Millennials are willing to stick with a retailer simply for the 
sake of legacy (past purchase behavior); they need to be moti-
vated by service, brand affiliation, a “message,” or price. “Their 
loyalty can vary by industry,” he says. “You might find loyalty 
for companies such as Apple, but they’ll quickly go somewhere 
else and follow their friends.”
Willy Kruh of KPMG says Millennials may be the “least 
loyal generation” unless a company shows it’s “listening to 
them” and engage in “evolution.” Then, they can become “very 
loyal.”
A November 2015 survey by global strategic branding 
and design firm Landor Associates found that Millennials seek 

	
PART 3  •  COMPREHENSIVE CASE	
237	
long-term relationships with brands that embrace change in 
ways they feel are authentic, foster trust, and are respectful of 
heritage and values. The survey revealed that Millennials expect 
brands to be “agile and navigate a tension between change and 
continuity.” Landor CEO Lois Jacobs comments, “As digital 
natives, Millennials are used to the rapid speed of the market 
and they expect brands to be as well.” She adds, “They have 
shifted the marketing landscape. We no longer live in an era of 
mass marketing.”
According to Ryan McConnell, Millennials have a strong 
sense of individualism, which is a big shift from previous gen-
erations when they were in their late teens and twenties. There’s 
less of a need to be or look exactly like their friends. “Today, 
what’s really hip or cool is being different. There aren’t any 
[unifying] styles,” he says. “There’s an incredible inclusiveness 
about this generation that accepts different lifestyles and ways 
of expressing yourself.”
Most Millennials are more trusting of their friends and 
social media networks than traditional advertising, says Kruh. 
Nearly 90 percent of respondents in McCarthy Group’s Engag-
ing Millennials Study did not like traditional ads, and that lack 
of trust extended to both people and institutions. The Pew 
demographics survey found that when they were asked if people 
can generally be trusted, only 19 percent of Millennials said 
yes, compared with 31 percent of the Gen Xers and 40 percent 
of the Baby Boomers.
And even though 8 in 10 Millennials say they’re generally 
optimistic about their future, 51 percent of them believe they 
will get no benefits from Social Security, whereas 39 percent 
predict they will get benefits at reduced levels.
They’re Not All Broke
Every generation likes to think it had it tougher than those who 
come later. However, Millennials do have a huge mountain to 
climb on almost every economic front. They have lower levels 
of wealth and personal income than Gen Xers and Baby Boom-
ers did at the same stage in their lives; and they are spending far 
more on things like their rent and food than previous genera-
tions did.
Young households are also carrying far higher levels of stu-
dent loan debt. “These things can be a massive drag on spend-
ing,” says researcher Dorsey.” It changes the options they have.”
Millennials are what previous generations might call “late 
bloomers.” They are more likely to live at home longer, and they 
wait longer to get married, longer to have kids, and longer to 
buy a house. According to a report from Goldman Sachs, nearly 
30 percent of them live at home with their parents. Furthermore, 
only 23 percent of Millennials were married and living in their 
own households in 2012, as compared with 43 percent of that 
age group in 1981 and 56 percent in 1968.
That doesn’t mean they don’t have money to spend, how-
ever. On an individual basis, they may spend less on certain things 
than previous generations, but their sheer numbers can make up 
for it in total volume. Kruh says Millennials think with a “differ-
ent cost-benefit analysis.” Experience is essential, and not always 
about whether they can afford it or not. Millennials living at home 
also have a big impact on how their parents shop, by exposing 
them to new technologies and their values around sustainability.
The biggest factors are their core buying power and the 
fact that there will be a “tremendous wealth transfer” in the 
future from Baby Boomers to Millennials. According to Accen-
ture, Generation Y is in line to inherit more than $30 trillion 
from Baby Boomers over the next few decades. As a result, 
researcher Dorsey says because of their current ages, life expec-
tancy, and purchasing patterns, Millennials actually represent 
“the greatest lifetime value of any customer segment you can 
win in retail.” See Figure 1.

Part 4
Choosing a  
Store Location
After a retailer has conducted a situation analysis, set its goals, 
identified consumer characteristics and needs, and gathered adequate information about the 
marketplace, it is ready to develop and enact an overall strategy. In Parts Four through Seven, 
we examine the elements of such a strategy: choosing a store location, managing a business, 
merchandise management and pricing, and communicating with the customer. Part Four 
concentrates on store location.
Besides dealing with the crucial nature of store location for retailers, Chapter 9 outlines a 
four-step approach to location planning. In this chapter, we focus on Step 1, trading-area 
analysis. Among the topics we look at are the use of geographic information systems, the size 
and shape of trading areas, how to determine trading areas for existing and new stores, and 
the major factors to consider in assessing trading areas. Several data sources are described.
Chapter 10 covers the last three steps in location planning: deciding on the most desirable 
type of location, selecting a general location, and choosing a particular site within that 
location. We first contrast isolated store, unplanned business district, and planned shopping 
center locales. Criteria for rating each location are then outlined and detailed.

Trading-Area Analysis
Chapter 
Objectives
1. To demonstrate the 
importance of store 
location for a retailer 
and to outline the 
process for choosing a 
store location
2. To discuss the concept 
of a trading area and its 
related components
3. To show how trading 
areas may be delineated 
for existing and new 
stores
4. To examine three 
major factors in  
trading-area analysis:  
population 
characteristics,  
economic base 
characteristics, and 
competition and the 
level of saturation
Retailers choose store locations based on a wide range of factors, including attributes of 
various trading areas, nearness to other units operated by the same firm and to stores 
operated by competing firms, population characteristics, and more. Likewise, consumers 
choose the locations where they like to shop based on various factors, including overall appeal 
of the area, distance to the store, availability of a choice of retailers and brands, ease of 
parking, and more.
Trading-area analysis for a traditional retailer and a destination retailer are very different. 
Key issues in trading-area analyses by a traditional retailer are its size, competitor locations, 
affinities with other retailers, and travel time. Differences in sales tax between adjacent areas, 
tolls, and traffic congestion can also have a major effect on a traditional store’s trading area. 
The normal rules associated with a trading-area analysis—regarding the population size of two 
cities, travel time, and square footage of selling space—may not directly apply to a destination 
retailer.
A destination retailer, such as Ikea or CarMax, often has a huge trading area based 
on the massive selection, large store size, value proposition, and unique merchandise. 
Destination retailers generate their own traffic and are not as dependent on the influence of 
other retailers; therefore, they can thrive in inexpensive locales. Unlike traditional retailers, 
many shoppers go only to that store on a shopping trip. Hence, there is no spillover traffic to 
adjacent retailers; and destination stores can thrive in inexpensive locales.

Nonetheless, a concern of some property owners is renting space to a destination retailer that 
might have difficulty being successful at that location on such a large scale. Several former 
destination retailers have gone out of business (e.g., Sports Authority and Borders) or lost their 
effectiveness (e.g., Best Buy, Staples, and Toys “R” Us). Some of these stores suffered due to 
competition from Web-based retailers that were able to offer large selections of merchandise 
at lower prices, from price competition by discounters such as Walmart, and/or from digital 
books that enabled customers to conveniently download and bypass traditional booksellers.
Overview
Because over 90 percent of all retail revenues are made at stores (including buying online and 
picking up in the store), the selection of a store location is one of the most significant strategic 
decisions in retailing. Consider the detailed planning of Aldi, the German-based discount food 
chain with more than 30 million customers of 1,500 stores in 32 U.S. states. Aldi’s U.S. expan-
sion plans include opening shopping-mall–based U.S. supermarkets. Except for its shopping mall 
sites, the 20,000-square-foot Aldi store is typical of the retailer. It works closely with developers to 
provide a good presentation of the store and preserve historic aspects of the original redeveloped 
properties. Unlike in Europe, supermarkets in malls are uncommon in the United States. Malls 
offer many benefits, including pass-through regular mall traffic and captive mall employees, as 
well as the opportunity to introduce Aldi to a whole new group of customers.1
This chapter  and the next explain why the proper store location is so crucial, as well as the 
steps a retailer should take in choosing a store location and deciding whether to build, lease, or 
buy. Visit our blog (www.bermanevansretail.com) for store location posts.
THE IMPORTANCE OF LOCATION TO A RETAILER
Location decisions are complex. Costs can be quite high, there is little flexibility once a site is 
chosen, and locational attributes have a big impact on a strategy. One of the oldest retailing adages 
is that “location, location, location” is the major factor leading to a firm’s success or failure. See 
Figure 9-1.
A good location may be substantial enough to allow a retailer to succeed even if its strategy 
mix is mediocre. A hospital gift shop may do well, although its assortment is limited, its prices 
are high, and it does not advertise. On the other hand, a poor location may be such a liability that 
even superior retailers cannot overcome it. A mom-and-pop store may do poorly if it is across 
the street from a category-killer store; although the small firm features personal service, it cannot 
match the selection and prices. At a different site, however, it might prosper.
The choice of a location requires extensive decision making due to the number of criteria 
considered, including population size and traits, the competition, transportation access, parking

Part 4  •  Choosing a Store Location
availability, the nature of nearby stores, property costs, the length of the agreement, legal restric-
tions, and other factors.
A store location typically necessitates a sizable investment and a long-term commitment. 
Even a retailer that minimizes its investment by leasing (rather than owning a building and land) 
can incur large costs. Besides lease payments, the firm must spend money on lighting, fixtures, 
a storefront, and so on.
Although leases of less than 5 years are common in less desirable retailing locations, leases 
in good shopping centers or shopping districts are often 5 to 10 years or more. It is not uncommon 
for a supermarket lease to be 15 or 20 years. Department stores and large specialty stores on major 
downtown thoroughfares occasionally sign leases longer than 20 years.
Due to its fixed nature, the investment, and the length of the lease, store location is the least 
flexible element of a retail strategy. A firm cannot easily move to another site or convert to another 
format. Also, a retailer may be barred from subleasing to another party during the lease period; 
if a company breaks a lease, it may be responsible to the property owner for financial losses. In 
contrast, ads, prices, customer services, and assortment can be modified as the environment (con-
sumers, competition, the economy) changes.
Even a retailer that owns its building and land may also find it hard to change locations. 
It has to find an acceptable buyer, which might take several months or longer, and it may have 
to assist the buyer with financing. It might also incur a loss, should it sell during an economic 
downturn.
A firm moving from to another locale faces three potential problems. (1) Some loyal shop-
pers and employees may be lost; the greater the distance between the old and new sites, the big-
ger the loss. (2) A new site may not have the same traits as the prior one. (3) Most store fixtures 
and renovations at a site cannot be transferred; their value is lost if they have not been fully 
depreciated.
Store location affects long- and short-run planning. In the long run, the choice of location 
influences the overall strategy. A retailer must be at a site that is consistent with its mission, goals, 
and target market for an extended time. It also must regularly study and monitor the status of the 
location as to population trends, the distances people travel to the store, and competitors’ entry 
and exit—and adapt accordingly.
In the short run, a location has an impact on specific elements of a strategy mix. A retailer 
in a downtown area with many office buildings may have little pedestrian traffic on weekends. 
It may be futile to try to sell items such as major appliances there. (Such items are often bought 
jointly by adult household members.) The retailer could either close on weekends and not stock 
certain products or remain open and try to attract customers to the area by aggressive promotion 
or pricing. If the retailer closes on weekends, it adapts its strategy mix to the attributes of the 
location. If it stays open, it invests additional resources in an attempt to alter shopping habits. A 
retailer that strives to overcome its location, by and large, faces greater risks than one that adapts.
Retailers should follow these four steps in choosing a store location:
1.	 Evaluate alternate geographic (trading) areas in terms of the characteristics of residents and 
existing retailers.
2.	 Determine whether to locate as an isolated store in an unplanned business district or in a 
planned shopping center within the geographic area.
3.	 Select the general isolated store, unplanned business district, or planned shopping center 
location.
4.	 Analyze alternate sites contained in the specified retail location type.
The selection of a store location is a process involving each of these steps. This chapter 
focuses on Step 1; Chapter 10 examines Steps 2, 3, and 4.
TRADING-AREA ANALYSIS
The first step in choosing a retail store location is to describe and assess alternate trading areas 
and then choose the best one. A trading area is a geographical area containing the customers and 
potential customers of a particular retailer or group of retailers for specific goods and/or services. 
The size of a trading area typically reflects the boundaries within which it is profitable to sell and/
or deliver products.2 After a trading area is selected, it should be reviewed regularly.

 
CHAPTER 9  •  Trading-Area Analysis	
243	
A thorough analysis of trading areas provides several benefits:
▶
▶Consumer demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are examined. For a new store, the 
study of proposed trading areas reveals opportunities and the retail strategy needed to succeed. 
For an existing store, it can be determined if the current strategy still matches consumer needs.
▶
▶The focus of promotional activities is ascertained, and the retailer can look at media coverage 
patterns of proposed or existing locations. If 95 percent of customers live within 3 miles of a 
store, it would be inefficient to advertise in a paper with a citywide audience.
▶
▶A chain retailer learns whether the location of a proposed new store will reach additional 
customers or take business from existing stores. Suppose a supermarket chain has a store in 
Jackson, Mississippi, with a trading area of 2 miles, and it considers adding a new store, three 
miles from the Jackson branch. Figure 9-2 shows the distinct trading areas and expected store 
overlap. The shaded portion represents the trading-area overlap, where the same custom-
ers are served by both branches. The chain must look at the overall net increase in sales if it 
adds the proposed store (total revised sales of existing store + total sales of new store - total 
previous sales of existing store).
▶
▶Chains anticipate whether competitors want to open nearby stores if the firm does not do 
so itself. That is why TJX has two of its chains, T. J. Maxx and Marshalls, situate within 
1.5 miles of each other in more than 100 U.S. markets, even though they are both off-price 
apparel firms.
▶
▶The best number of stores for a chain to operate in a given area is calculated. How many out-
lets should a retailer have in a region to provide good service for customers (without raising 
costs too much or having too much overlap)? When CVS pharmacy entered Atlanta, it opened 
nine new drugstores in one day. This gave it enough coverage of the city to service residents, 
In the United Kingdom, My Local, the 120-branch convenience 
store run by supermarket chain Morrisons, went into admin-
istration at the end of June 2016. Initially, 90 of the stores, 
employing nearly 1700, were closed, and the rest were bought 
by other retailers. Morrisons had acquired the sites from the 
doomed movie rental retailer Blockbuster when that company 
finally collapsed in 2013. The problem was that few of the sites 
acquired by Morrisons in the deal were prime convenience store 
locations.
Examine your own retail market. Can you identify retail loca-
tions that seem to constantly change hands as a succession of 
retailers fail to make the site work? Why might this be the case, 
and what kind of retailer might work instead?

without placing stores too close together. A major competitive advantage for Canadian Tire 
Corporation is that four-fifths of the Canadian population lives within a 15-minute drive of 
a Canadian Tire store.
▶
▶Geographic weaknesses are highlighted. Suppose a suburban shopping center does an analysis 
and finds that most of those residing south of town do not shop there, and a more comprehen-
sive study reveals that people are afraid to drive past a dangerous railroad crossing. Due to 
its research, the shopping center could exert political pressure to make the crossing safer.
▶
▶The impact of the Internet is taken into account. Store-based retailers must examine trading 
areas more carefully than ever to see how their customers’ shopping behavior is changing 
due to the Web.
▶
▶Other factors are reviewed. The competition, financial institutions, transportation, labor avail-
ability, supplier location, legal restrictions, and so on can each be learned for the trading 
area(s) examined.
The Use of Geographic Information Systems in Trading-Area Delineation and 
Analysis
Increasingly, retailers are using geographic information system (GIS) software, which combines 
digitized mapping with key locational data to graphically depict trading-area characteristics such 
as population demographics; data on customer purchases; and listings of current, proposed, and 
competitor locations. Commercial GIS software lets firms quickly research the attractiveness of 
different locations and access computer-generated maps. Before, retailers often placed different 
color pins on paper maps to show current and proposed locales—and competitors’ sites—and had 
to collect and analyze data.3
Most GIS software programs are extrapolated from the decennial Census of Population and 
the U.S. Census Bureau’s national digital map (known as TIGER—topologically integrated geo-
graphic encoding and referencing).4 TIGER incorporates all streets and highways in the 
United States. TIGER files may be accessed online free using its web-based platform TIGERweb 
or as Shapefiles downloads. TIGERweb’s Web Map Service (WMS) maps may be adapted to 
reflect census tracts, railroads, highways, waterways, and other physical attributes of any U.S. 
area, but they do not show retailers or other commercial entities. Many versions of the TIGER 
data are available for download and adaptation based on level of detail.5 See Figure 9-3 shows the 
breadth of TIGER services.
Mapping software from private firms have many more enhancements than TIGER does. These 
firms often offer free demonstrations, but they expect to be paid for their software. Although GIS 
applications differ by vendor, they generally can be accessed or bought for as little as $100 (or less) 
or for as much as several thousand dollars. They are designed to work with personal computers, 
and allow for some manipulation of trading-area data.
Private firms that offer mapping software include:
▶
▶Alteryx (http://analytics.alteryx.com/spatial-analytics)
▶
▶Autodesk (http://usa.autodesk.com)
▶
▶Caliper Corporation (www.caliper.com)

▶Tele Mart GIS Mapping (www.tele-mart.com/gis-mapping.php)

▶Tetrad (www.tetrad.com)
Many of these companies have free demonstrations at their Web sites.
Geographic information system software can be applied in various ways. A chain retailer 
could learn which of its stores have trading areas with households having a median annual income 
of more than $50,000. That firm could derive the sales potential of proposed new store locations 
and their potential effect on sales at existing stores. It could also use software to learn the demo-
graphics of customers at its best locations and set up a computer model to find potential locations 
with the most desired attributes. A retailer could even use the software to pinpoint its geographic 
areas of strength and weakness.

Part 4  •  Choosing a Store Location
These three examples show how retailers benefit from GIS software:
▶
▶Starbucks uses GIS software from Esri to create and use store location data, maps, and models 
through employee desktops, in browsers, or on mobile devices. A new capability of this soft-
ware is its ability to generate “heat maps” that depict the distribution of Starbucks locations. 
The points on the GIS maps can be grouped on a small scale to analyze regional patterns and 
on a large scale to view patterns within a metropolitan area. The heat maps depict the density 
of Starbucks locations. The Esri-based software provides Starbucks with data on population 
demographics, population density, auto traffic patterns, public transportation, and the types

range of MapInfo GIS 
software (http://goo

GIS mapping software enables retailers and real-estate developers 
to better assess store locations. Geographic information systems 
now incorporate both store and online data to develop a target 
market profile. An omnichannel perspective can be undertaken by 
seeing the impact of additional stores in a market area on online 
sales. GIS software allows sales data to be exported to an Excel 
spreadsheet format for more intensive data analysis. GIS systems 
include lifestyle and demographic customer data to better assess 
locations. The software can help reduce cannibalism among store 
units and show the impact of drive time on stores’ trading-area 
overlap. GIS helps assess compatible retailers. The system also 
show a market’s overall size, as well as population projections.
Could a retailer accomplish the above without using a GIS 
system? Explain your answer.

of nearby stores. Starbucks uses the data in making decisions about new store openings as 
well as menu options tailored to the store.6
▶
▶Walgreens has used GIS technology since 2000. Its new system, called WalMap, contains 
interactive maps that can be used to determine the best place to locate a new store on the 
basis of demographic trends, competitor locations, and sales trend data. This software, which 
can be viewed on an iPad, contains location-specific data so store managers and Walgreens’ 
corporate-level real-estate team can use the information. With the use of mobile devices, 
managers no longer have to print out maps to access important information.7
▶
▶GFK GeoMarketing offers GIS software services that assist international retailers that want 
to expand overseas. The software helps find best locations for store networks, identifying 
regional target groups, and determining product demand. RegioGraph helps retailers analyze 
and visualize their data on digital maps.8
The Size and Shape of Trading Areas
Each trading area has three parts: The primary trading area encompasses 50 to 80 percent of a store’s 
customers. It is the area closest to the store and possesses the highest density of customers to population 
and the highest per capita sales. There is little overlap with other trading areas. The secondary trading 
area contains an additional 15 to 25 percent of a store’s customers. It is located outside the primary 
area, and customers are more widely dispersed. The fringe trading area includes all the remaining 
customers, and they are the most widely dispersed. A store could have a primary trading area of 4 
miles, a secondary trading area of 5 miles, and a fringe trading area of 10 miles. The fringe trading area 
typically includes some outshoppers who travel greater distances to patronize certain stores.
Figure 9-4 shows the makeup of trading areas and their segments. In reality, trading areas do 
not usually follow such circular patterns. They adjust to the physical environment. The size and

shape are affected by store type, store size, location of competitors, housing patterns, travel time 
and traffic barriers (such as toll bridges), and media access. These factors are discussed next.
Two stores can have different trading areas even if they are in the same shopping district or 
shopping center. Situated in one shopping center could be a branch of an apparel chain with a dis-
tinctive image and customers willing to travel up to 20 miles and a shoe store regarded as average 
and customers willing to travel up to 5 miles. When one store has a better assortment, promotes 
more, and/or creates a stronger image, it may then become a destination store and generate a 
trading area much larger than that of a competitor with a “me-too” appeal. To be a desination 
retailer, Dunkin’ Donuts uses the slogan “America Runs on Dunkin’.” A parasite store does not 
create its own traffic and has no real trading area of its own. It depends on people who are drawn 
to the location for other reasons. A magazine stand in a hotel lobby and a snack bar in a shopping 
center are parasites. People patronize the shops but they did not come to the location of these 
shops specifically to make a purchase.
The extent of a store/center trading area is affected by its own size. As a store or center gets 
larger, its trading area usually increases, because store or center size generally reflects the assort-
ment of goods and services. Yet, trading areas do not grow proportionately with store or center 
size. As a rule, supermarket trading areas are bigger than those of convenience stores. Customers 
go to the supermarket because it offers a better product selection; they go to the convenience store 
because of the need for a couple of “fill-in” items. In a regional shopping center, department stores 
usually have the largest trading areas, followed by apparel stores; gift stores have comparatively 
small trading areas. See Figures 9-5 and 9-6.
Whenever potential shoppers are situated between two competing stores, the trading area 
is often reduced for each store. The size of each store’s trading area normally increases as the 
distance between stores grows (target markets do not overlap as much). On the other hand, when 
stores are very near one another, the size of each store’s trading area does not necessarily shrink. 
This store grouping may actually increase the trading area for each store if more consumers are 
attracted to the location due to the variety of goods and services. However, each store’s market 
penetration (its percentage of sales in the trading area) may be low with such competition. Also, 
the entry of a new store may change the shape or create gaps in the trading areas of existing 
stores.

In many urban communities, people are clustered in multiunit housing near the center 
of commerce. With such population density, it is worthwhile for a retailer to be quite close 
to consumers; trading areas tend to be small because there are several shopping districts in 
close proximity to one another, particularly for the most densely populated cities. In many 
suburbs, most people live in single-unit housing, which is more geographically spread out. 
To produce satisfactory sales volume in suburbia, a retailer needs to attract shoppers from a 
greater distance.
The influence of travel or driving time on a trading area may not be clear from the popula-
tion’s geographic distribution. Physical barriers (toll bridges, poor roads, railroad tracks, one-way 
streets) usually reduce trading areas’ size and contribute to their odd shapes. Economic barriers, 
such as different sales taxes in two towns, also affect the size and shape of trading areas.
In a community where a newspaper or other local media are available, a retailer could afford 
to advertise and enlarge its trading area. If local media are not available, the retailer would have to 
weigh the costs of advertising in countywide or regional media against the possibilities of a big-
ger trading area.
Delineating the Trading Area of an Existing Store
The size, shape, and characteristics of the trading area for an existing store—or shopping district 
or shopping center—can usually be delineated quite accurately. Store records (secondary data) 
or a special research study (primary data) can measure the trading area. And many firms offer 
computer-generated maps that can be tailored to individual retailers’ needs.
Store records can reveal customer addresses. For credit customers, the data can be obtained 
from a retailer’s billing department; for cash customers, addresses can be acquired by analyzing 
deliveries, cash sales slips, store contests (sweepstakes), and checks. In both instances, the task 
is relatively inexpensive and quick because the data were originally collected for other purposes 
and are readily available.
Because many big retailers have computerized credit-card systems, they can define primary, 
secondary, and fringe trading areas in terms of the following:
▶
▶The frequency with which people from various geographic locales shop at a particular 
store
▶
▶The average-dollar purchases at a store by people from given geographic locales
▶
▶The concentration of a store’s credit-card holders from given geographic locales

250 
Part 4  •  Choosing a Store Location
Although it is easy to get data on credit-card customers, the analysis may be invalid if cash custom-
ers are not also studied. Credit use may vary among shoppers from different locales, especially if 
consumer traits in the locales are dissimilar. A firm reduces this problem if both cash and credit 
customers are studied.
A retailer can also collect primary data to determine trading-area size. It can record license 
plate numbers of cars parked near a store, find general addresses of those vehicle owners by con-
tacting the state motor vehicle office, and then note them on a map. Typically, only the ZIP code 
and street of residence are given to protect people’s privacy. In license plate analysis, nondrivers 
and passengers—customers who walk to a store, use mass transit, or are driven by others—should 
not be omitted. To collect data on these people, questions must often be asked (survey).
If a retailer desires more demographic and lifestyle information about consumers in particular 
areas, it can buy the data. PRIZM (now owned by Nielsen) is a system for identifying communities 
by lifestyle clusters. It identifies 66 neighborhood types, including “Upward Bound,” “Blue-Chip 
Blues,” and “Suburban Sprawl.” This system was originally based on ZIP codes; it now also 
incorporates census tracts, block groups and enumeration districts, phone exchanges, and postal 
routes. Online PRIZM reports can be downloaded for as little as a few hundred dollars; costs are 
higher if reports are tailored to the individual retailer.
No matter how a trading area is delineated, a time bias may exist. A downtown business 
district is patronized by different customers during the week (those who work there) than on 
weekends (those who travel there to shop). Special events may attract people from great distances 
for only a brief time. Thus, an accurate estimate of a store’s trading area requires complete and 
continuous investigation.
After delineating a trading area, the retailer should map people’s locations and densities—
either manually or with GIS software. In the manual method, a paper map of the area around a 
store is used. Different color dots or pins are placed on this map to represent population locations 
and densities, incomes, and other factors. Customer locations and densities are then indicated; 
primary, secondary, and fringe trading areas are denoted by ZIP code. Customers can be lured 
by promotions aimed at particular ZIP codes. With GIS software, vital customer data (such as 
purchase frequencies and amounts) are combined with other sources (such as census data) to 
yield computer-generated digitized maps depicting primary, secondary, and fringe trading areas.
Delineating the Trading Area of a New Store
A new store opening in an established trading area can use the methods just cited. The discussion 
in this section refers to a trading area with less-defined shopping and traffic patterns. Such an 
area must normally be evaluated in terms of opportunities rather than current patronage and traffic 
(pedestrian and vehicular) patterns. Accordingly, additional tools must be utilized.
Trend analysis—projecting the future based on the past—can be used by examining govern-
ment and other data for predictions about population location, auto registrations, new housing 
starts, mass transportation, highways, zoning, and so on. With consumer surveys, data can be 
gathered about the time and distance people would be willing to travel to various retail locations, 
factors attracting people to a new store, addresses of those most apt to visit a new store, and other 
topics. Either technique may be a basis for delineating alternate new store trading areas.
Three computerized trading-area models are available for assessing new store locations:
1.	 An analog model is the simplest and most popular trading-area analysis tool. Potential sales 
for a new store are estimated on the basis of revenues for similar stores in existing areas, the 
competition at a prospective location, the new store’s expected market share at that location, 
and the size and density of the location’s primary trading area.
2.	 A regression model uses a series of mathematical equations showing the association between 
potential store sales and several independent variables at each location, such as population 
size, average income, the number of households, nearby competitors, transportation barriers, 
and traffic patterns.
3.	 A gravity model is based on the premise that people are drawn to stores that are closer 
and more attractive than competitors’ stores. The distance between consumers and com-
petitors, the distance from consumers to a given site, and store image can be included in 
this model.

CHAPTER 9  •  Trading-Area Analysis

Computerized trading-area models offer several benefits to retailers: (1) They operate in an 
objective and systematic way. (2) They offer insights as to how each locational attribute should 
be weighted. (3) They are useful in screening a large number of locations. (4) They can assess 
management performance by comparing forecasts with results.
More specific methods for delineating new trading areas are described next.9
REILLY’S LAW  The traditional means of trading-area delineation is Reilly’s law of retail gravita-
tion.10 It establishes a point of indifference between two cities or communities, so the trading area 
of each can be determined. The point of indifference is the geographic breaking point between 
two cities (communities) at which consumers are indifferent to shopping at either. According to 
Reilly’s law, more people go to a larger city or community because there are more stores; the 
assortment makes travel time worthwhile. Reilly’s law rests on these assumptions: Two competing 
areas are equally accessible from a major road, and retailers in the two areas are equally effective. 
Other factors (such as population dispersion) are held constant or ignored.
The law may be expressed algebraically as:11
Dab =
d
1 + 2Pb/Pa
where
Dab = Limit of city (community) A’s trading area, measured in miles along the road to city
(community) B
d = Distance in miles along a major roadway between cities (communities) A and B
Pa = Population of city (community) A
Pb = Population of city (community) B
A city with a population of 90,000 (A) would draw people from three times the distance as 
a city with 10,000 (B). If the cities are 20 miles apart, the point of indifference for the larger city 
is 15 miles, and for the smaller city, it is 5 miles:
Dab =
20
1 + 210,000/90,000
= 15 miles
15 miles
5 miles
City A –

Reilly’s law is an important contribution to trading-area analysis because of its ease of cal-
culation. It is most useful when other data are not available or when compiling other data is 
costly. Nonetheless, Reilly’s law has three limitations: (1) Distance is measured only by major 
thoroughfares; some people will travel shorter distances along streets that cross major thorough-
fares. (2) Travel time does not necessarily reflect the distance traveled. Many people are more 
concerned about time than distance. (3) Actual distance may not correspond with the perceptions 
of distance. A store with few services and crowded aisles is apt to be a greater perceived distance 
from a person than a similarly located store with a more pleasant atmosphere.
HUFF’S LAW  Huff’s law of shopper attraction delineates trading areas on the basis of the prod-
uct assortment (of the items desired by the consumer) carried at various shopping locations, travel 
times from the shopper’s home to alternative locations, and the sensitivity of the kind of shopping 
to travel time. Assortment is rated by the total square feet of selling space a retailer expects all 
firms in a shopping area to allot to a product category. Sensitivity to the kind of shopping entails 
the trip’s purpose (restocking versus shopping) and the type of good/service sought (such as cloth-
ing versus groceries).12

Part 4  •  Choosing a Store Location
Huff’s law is expressed as:
Pij =
Sj
(Tij)l
a
n
j
Sj
(Tij)l
where
Pij = Probability of a consumer’s traveling from home i to shopping location j
Sj = Square footage of selling space in shopping location j expected to be devoted to a particular 
product category
Tij = Travel time from consumer’s home i to shopping location j
l = Parameter used to estimate the effect of travel time on different kinds of shopping trips
n = Number of different shopping locations
Note that l must be determined through research or by a computer program.
Assume a leased department operator studies three possible locations with 200, 300, and 500 
total square feet of store space allocated to men’s cologne (by all retailers in the areas). A group 
of potential customers lives 7 minutes from the first location, 10 minutes from the second, and 
15 minutes from the third. The operator estimates the effect of travel time to be 2. Therefore, the 
probability of consumers’ shopping is 43.9 percent for Location 1, 32.2 percent for Location 2, 
and 23.9 percent for Location 3:
 Pi1 =
(200)/(7)2
(200)/(7)2 + (300)/(10)2 + (500)/(15)2 = 43.9,
 Pi2 =
(300)/(10)2
(200)/(7)2 + (300)/(10)2 + (500)/(15)2 = 32.2,
 Pi3 =
(500)/(15)2
(200)/(7)2 + (300)/(10)2 + (500)/(15)2 = 23.9,
If 200 shoppers for men’s cologne live 7 minutes from Location 1, about 88 of them will shop 
there.
These points should be considered in using Huff’s law:
▶
▶To determine Location 1’s trading area, similar computations would be made for shoppers liv-
ing at a driving time of 10, 15, 20 minutes, and so on. The number of shoppers at each distance 
who would shop there are then summed. Thus, stores in Location 1 could estimate their total 
market, trading-area size, and primary, secondary, and fringe areas for a product category.
▶
▶If new retail facilities in a product category are added to a locale, the percentage of shoppers 
living at every travel time from that location who would shop there goes up.
▶
▶The probability of people shopping at a location depends on the effect of travel time. If a 
product is important, such as dressy watches, consumers are less travel sensitive. A l of 1 
leads to these figures: Location 1, 31.1 percent; Location 2, 32.6 percent; and Location 3, 
36.3 percent (based on the space in the cologne example). Location 3 would be popular for 
the watches due to assortment.
▶
▶All the variables are rather hard to calculate; for mapping purposes, travel time must be con-
verted to miles. Travel time also depends on the transportation form used.
▶
▶Since people buy different items on different shopping trips, the trading area varies by trip.
Today, the Huff model is utilized in such GIS software as Esri’s ArcGIS Business Analyst.
OTHER TRADING-AREA RESEARCH  Over the years, many researchers have examined trading-
area size in a variety of settings. They have introduced additional factors and advanced statistical 
­techniques to explain the consumer’s choice of shopping location. Here are some examples.
In his model, Gautschi added to Huff’s analysis by including shopping-center descriptors and 
transportation conditions. Weisbrod, Parcells, and Kern studied shopping-center appeal on the 
basis of expected population changes, store characteristics, and the transportation network. Bell,

Ho, and Tang devised a model with fixed and variable store-choice factors. Rogers examined the 
role of human decision making versus computer-based models in site choice. Rajagopal studied 
shopping attractions, routes to shopping, and establishing customer-centric strategies. Dolega, 
Pavlis, and Singleton extended the retail store attractiveness and catchment model from a single 
store or shopping center to a national network of retail centers.13
CHARACTERISTICS OF TRADING AREAS
After the size and shape of alternative trading areas are determined, the characteristics of those 
areas are studied. Of special interest are the attributes of residents and how well they match the 
firm’s definition of its target market. An auto repair franchisee may compare opportunities in sev-
eral locales by reviewing the number of car registrations; a hearing aid retailer may evaluate the 
percentage of the population 60 years of age or older; and a bookstore retailer may be concerned 
with residents’ education level.
Among the trading-area factors that should be studied by most retailers are the population 
size and characteristics, availability of labor, closeness to sources of supply, promotion facilities, 
economic base, competition, availability of locations, and regulations. The economic base is an 
area’s industrial and commercial structure—the companies and industries that residents depend 
on to earn a living. The dominant industry (company) in an area is important because its drastic 
decline may have adverse effects on a large segment of residents. An area with a diverse economic 
base, where residents work for a variety of nonrelated industries, is more secure than an area with 
one major industry. Table 9-1 summarizes a number of factors to consider in evaluating retail 
trading areas.
Much of the data needed to describe an area can be obtained from the U.S. Bureau of the 
Census, the American Community Survey, Editor & Publisher Market Guide, Standard Rate 
& Data Service, regional planning boards, public utilities, chambers of commerce, local govern-
ment offices, shopping-center owners, and renting agents. In addition, GIS software shows data 
on potential buying power in an area, the location of competitors, and highway access. Both 
demographic and lifestyle information may also be included in this software.
Although the yardsticks in Table 9-1 are not equally important in all location decisions, each 
should be considered. The most important yardsticks should be “knockout” factors: If a location 
does not meet minimum standards on key measures, it should be immediately dropped from 
further consideration.
These are examples of desirable trading-area attributes, according to these two retailers:
▶
▶Duluth Trading Company (www.duluthtrading.com), the Wisconsin-based omnichannel retailer 
of inventive and functional workwear for men and women, has evolved from a small mail-
order business to a national retailer with nine stores and two outlets, and is expanding to other 
states. Duluth Trading analyzes dozens of markets to identify those with the strongest network 
potential based on trading-area analysis, customer segmentation, and proprietary retail mod-
eling. Requirements for a Duluth store include a 10,000- to 15,000-square-foot space with a 
prominent interstate in the vicinity as well as access and visibility from a freeway, preferably 
near other male-oriented stores, with ample and convenient parking. Furthermore, to support its 
­positioning that shopping at Duluth is an experience not just a purchase, it seeks “special, char-
acter-filled places and spaces, including downtown heritage locations suitable for renovation.”14
▶
▶Texas-based Container Store (www.containerstore.com) sells high-end storage and organiza-
tion products. It notes that one bad store location imposes “costs for 5 to 15 years” and oppor-
tunity losses of almost five good stores. It uses predictive analytics with cutting-edge location 
intelligence data to identify optimal locations for stores. Location intelligence leverages data 
from multiple sources relevant to Container Store customers and its lines of business (e.g., 
number of people in a geographic area who drink wine or donate to charity). In addition, it 
uses census-based data GIS (incomes, demographics in a neighborhood, etc.); information 
from consumer credit-card transactions (for example, annual spending in various product cat-
egories in an area); social-media information from LinkedIn (jobs and skills within an area) 
and Facebook (opinions of businesses in the area); mobile beacon data from telecommunica-
tions companies on when and how often consumers visit stores in a neighborhood; and traffic 
density information (how long customers may sit in traffic) to evaluate prospective sites. The 
retailer may decide not to invest in real estate at all and instead develop an online strategy.15

Prior to an area being rediscovered by young urban profession-
als, retail tenants often consisted of small independent retailers 
paying low rents. Many storefronts were unattractive, and there 
were few big retail chains. Ironically, neighborhood gentrification 
is often accompanied by retail vacancies, with some of the retail-
ers responsible for the gentrification of the area being the first to 
move. In some cases, property owners wanted existing tenants 
to pay higher rents. In other instances, those owners sought to 
vacate the retail space in order to sell the building. Some experts 
say there is a retail lag when a neighborhood undergoes gentri-
fication because of retailer reluctance to open new stores until 
redevelopment is more certain. One solution is to offer store-
opening incentives for anchor retailers. This has been done in 
Washington, D.C., and Chicago.
Discuss the pros and cons of city incentives to attract anchor 
retail tenants.

CHAPTER 9  •  Trading-Area Analysis

Several stages of the process for gathering data to analyze trading areas are shown in ­Figure 9-7, 
which includes not only resident attributes but also those of competition. By studying these fac-
tors, a retailer sees how desirable an area is for a new retail business. We next discuss three ele-
ments in trading-area selection: population factors, economic base characteristics, and competition 
and saturation.

Part 4  •  Choosing a Store Location
Characteristics of the Population
Knowledge about population attributes can be gained from secondary sources. They offer data 
on population size, households, income distribution, education, age distribution, and more. 
Since Census of Population and other public sources are so valuable, we briefly discuss them 
next.
CENSUS OF POPULATION  The Census of Population supplies a wide range of demographic 
data for all U.S. cities and surrounding vicinities. Data are organized geographically, starting 
with blocks and continuing to census tracts, cities, counties, states, and regions. There are 
less data for blocks and tracts than for larger units due to privacy issues. The major ­advantage 
of census data is the data on small geographic units. After trading-area boundaries are set, 
a firm can look at data by geographic unit in an area and study aggregate data. There are 
also data categories helpful for retailers wanting market segmentation—including racial and 
ethnic data, small-area income data, and commuting patterns. Data come in many formats, 
including online.
The U.S. Census Bureau’s TIGER computerized database contains extremely detailed physi-
cal breakdowns of areas in the United States. The database has digital descriptions of geographic 
areas (area boundaries and codes, latitude and longitude coordinates, and address ranges). 
Because TIGER data must be used in conjunction with population and other data, GIS software 
is necessary. As noted earlier in this chapter, private firms have devised location analysis pro-
grams, based largely on TIGER. These firms also usually project data to the present and into the 
future.
Major drawbacks of the Census of Population are that it is done only once every 10 years 
and all data are not immediately available. The last full set of U.S. census data is the 2010 
Census of Population, with data released in phases from 2011 through 2013. Thus, census 
material can be dated and inaccurate. Other sources, such as municipal building departments 
or utilities, state governments, other Census reports (such as the Current Population Survey), 
and projections by private firms such as Dun & Bradstreet must be used to update Census of 
Population data.
The value of the Census of Population’s actual 2010 census tract data can be shown by 
an illustration of Long Beach, New York, which is 30 miles east of New York City on Long 
Island’s south shore. Long Beach includes the six census tracts highlighted in Figure 9-8: 4164, 
4165, 4166, 4167.01, 4167.02, and 4168. Although tract 4163 is contiguous with Long Beach, 
it represents another community. Table 9-2 shows various population statistics for each Long 
Beach census tract. Overall, Long Beach is above average in most demographics. However, 
resident attributes in each tract do differ; thus, a retailer may locate in one or more tracts but 
not in others.

CHAPTER 9  •  Trading-Area Analysis	
257	
Suppose a local bookstore wants to evaluate two potential trading areas based on the demo-
graphic data of the census tracts described in Table 9-2. Trading-area A corresponds with tracts 
4164 and 4166. Area B corresponds to tracts 4167.01 and 4168. Population data for these areas 
(extracted from Table 9-2) are presented in Table 9-3. Area A is somewhat different from Area B, 
despite their proximity:
▶
▶The population in Area B is 20 percent larger.
▶
▶Although the population in both areas fell from 2000 to 2010, Area B dropped by a smaller 
percentage.
▶
▶In Areas A and B, the percentage aged 25 and older with college degrees is about equal.
▶
▶The annual median income and the proportion of workers who are managers or professionals 
are a bit higher for Area B.
The bookstore would have a tough time selecting between the areas because they are so 
similar. Thus, the firm might also consider the location of the sites available in Area A and Area 
B, relative to the locations of its existing stores, before making a final decision. It should also 
consider the differences between the census tracts in each proposed location. For example, in 
Area A, a much lower percentage of people are college graduates in tract 4164 than tract 4166.
OTHER PUBLIC SOURCES  There are many other useful, easily accessible public sources for cur-
rent population information, in addition to the Census of Population—especially on a city or 
county basis. These sources typically update their data annually. They also provide some data not 
available from the Census of Population—total annual retail sales by area, annual retail sales for 
specific product categories, and population projections. The biggest disadvantage of these sources

is their use of geographic territories that are often much larger than a store’s trading area and that 
cannot be broken down easily.
One newer national source of annual population data is the American Community Survey, 
which provides “demographic, social, economic, and housing data” for about 1,000 geographical 
areas. The survey has an excellent, user-friendly Web site (www.census.gov/acs/www). On the 
state and local levels, public data sources include planning commissions, research centers at public 
universities, county offices, and many other institutions.
Let us demonstrate the usefulness of public sources through the following example. (Note: 
We obtained all of the information for our example on the Internet—free!)
Suppose a prospective new car dealer investigates three counties near Chicago: DuPage, 
Kane, and Lake. The dealer decides to focus on one source of data available in print and online 
versions: Northern Illinois Market Facts (prepared by the Center for Government Studies, North-
ern Illinois University). Table 9-4 lists selected population and retail sales data for these counties.
What can the dealer learn? DuPage is by far the largest county; Kane is the smallest. Yet, 
the population growth rate from 2000 to 2010 was much higher for Kane. Lake has the highest 
median household income; DuPage has more adult college graduates. Per capita, DuPage residents 
account for 60 percent more retail sales than Kane residents and 21 percent more than Lake’s. 
Lake and DuPage residents both allot more than one-fifth of spending to autos and gas stations; 
Kane residents account for the highest percentage of retail spending at apparel and food stores.
A Cadillac dealer using the data might select DuPage or Lake; a Ford dealer might choose 
Kane. But because the data are broad, several subsections of Kane may really be better choices 
to subsections in DuPage or Lake for the Cadillac dealer. Competition in each area also must 
be noted.
A location decision for a fast-food franchise often requires less data than for a bookstore or 
an auto dealer. Fast-food franchisors often seek communities with many people who live or work 
within three or four miles of their stores. But bookstore owners and auto dealers cannot locate 
merely based population density; they must consider a more complex set of population factors.
ECONOMIC BASE CHARACTERISTICS
The economic base reflects a community’s commercial and industrial infrastructure and residents’ 
sources of income. A firm seeking stability normally ­prefers an area with a diversified economic 
base (a large number of nonrelated industries) to one with an economic base keyed to a single 
major industry. The latter area is more affected by a strike, declining demand for an industry, and 
cyclical fluctuations.
In assessing a trading area’s economic base, a retailer should investigate the percentage of 
the labor force in each industry, transportation, banking facilities, the impact of economic fluc-
tuations, and the future of individual industries (firms). Data can be obtained from such sources 
as Easy Analytic Software, Editor & Publisher Market Guide, regional planning commissions, 
industrial development organizations, and chambers of commerce.
Easy Analytic Software (www.easidemographics.com) offers several inexpensive economic 
reports. It also produces “Census 2010 Reports” that can be downloaded free (after a simple 
sign-in), including Quick Reports, Quick Tables, Quick Maps, Site Analysis, Rank Analysis, and 
Profile Analysis.
Editor & Publisher Market Guide offers annual economic base data for cities, including 
employment sources, transportation networks, financial institutions, auto registrations, newspaper

circulation, and shopping centers. It also has data on population size and total households. The 
data in this guide cover broad geographic areas. The bookstore noted earlier might find the data on 
shopping centers to be helpful. The auto dealer would find the information on the transportation 
network, the availability of financial institutions, and the number of passenger cars to be useful. 
Editor & Publisher Market Guide is best used to supplement other sources.
The Nature of Competition and the Level of Saturation
A trading area may have residents who match desired characteristics of the desired market 
and a strong economic base, yet be a poor site for a new store if competition is too intense. A 
locale with a small population and a narrow economic base may be a good place if competi-
tion is less.

Part 4  •  Choosing a Store Location
When examining competition, these factors should be analyzed: the number of existing stores, 
the size distribution of existing stores, the rate of new store openings, the strengths and weaknesses 
of all stores, the short-run and long-run trends, and the level of saturation.
Over the past 30 years, more U.S. retailers have entered foreign markets due to not as much 
competition. That is why Walmart is now in 28 countries, including Argentina, Brazil, China, 
Mexico, and Nigeria; Home Depot is in Canada, Guam, Mexico, and the Virgin Islands; and 
Baskin-Robbins has stores in Australia, Greece, Indonesia, Malaysia, Russia, and Thailand. Yet, 
in the future, even these locales may become oversaturated due to all the new stores. Furthermore, 
although the Northeast population in the United States has been declining relative to the South-
east and the Southwest—and is often considered to be saturated with stores—its high population 
density (the number of persons per square mile) is crucial for retailers. According to the 2010 
U.S. Census, in New Jersey, there were 1,196 people per square mile; in Massachusetts, 840; in 
Florida, 351; in Louisiana, 105; in Arizona, 57; and in Utah, 34.
An understored trading area has too few stores selling a specific good or service to satisfy 
the needs of its population. An overstored trading area has so many stores selling a specific good 
or service that some retailers cannot earn an adequate profit. A saturated trading area has the 
proper amount of stores to satisfy the needs of its population for a specific good or service, and 
to enable retailers to prosper.
Despite the large number of areas in the United States that are overstored, there still remain 
plentiful opportunities in understored communities. In some product categories, such as furniture, 
there can be a devastating plunge in sales and store closings in many areas during a housing reces-
sion. An economic recovery, low interest rates, improving employment, and rising home sales 
can stoke demand for household furniture. Today, new furniture stores are opening at an unprec-
edented rate in understored areas due to 83 million Millennials at their peak spending age and 76 
million Baby Boomers who need new furniture appropriate for downsized homes and lifestyles.16
MEASURING TRADING-AREA SATURATION  Because any trading area can support only a given 
number of stores or square feet of selling space per goods/service category, these ratios can help 
quantify retail store saturation:
▶
▶Number of persons per retail establishment
▶
▶Average sales per retail store
▶
▶Average sales per retail store category
▶
▶Average store sales per capita or household
▶
▶Average sales per square foot of selling area
▶
▶Average sales per employee
The saturation level in a trading area can be measured against a goal or compared with other 
trading areas. An auto accessory chain could find that its current trading area is saturated by com-
puting the ratio of residents to auto accessory stores. On the basis of this calculation, the owner 
could then decide to expand into a nearby locale with a lower ratio rather than to add another 
store in its present trading area.
Data for saturation ratios can be obtained from retailer records on its performance, city and 
state records, phone directories, surveys, economic census data, Editor & Publisher Market Guide, 
Real-estate careers in retailing are common in large chains 
as well in franchises. Personnel in this area have two major 
responsibilities: (1) trading-area analysis—identifying retail 
areas that are understored relative to their potential and (2) 
site selection—selecting specific sites and negotiating terms 
of occupancy. This box focuses on trading-area analysis. Site-
selection careers are discussed in Chapter 10. Trading-area 
personnel can work in a large retailer’s real-estate department, 
marketing research companies, or in consulting companies and 
real-estate firms. Trading-area analysis is typically an inside job 
that relies on GIS to map a location’s existing customers relative 
to current stores, determines drive times to existing locations, 
shows competitor locations, and highlights barriers (such as 
tolls, bridges, etc.).

Trading-Area Analysis

 
CHAPTER 9  •  Trading-Area Analysis

County Business Patterns, trade publications, and other sources. Sales by category, population 
size, and number of households per market area can be found with other sources.
When investigating an area’s saturation for a specific good or service, ratios must be inter-
preted carefully. Differences among areas are not always reliable indicators of saturation. For 
instance, car sales per capita are different for a suburban area than an urban area because sub-
urbanites have a much greater need for cars. Each area’s level of saturation should be evaluated 
against distinct standards—based on optimum per-capita sales figures in that area.
In calculating saturation based on sales per square foot, a new or growing retailer must take 
its proposed store into account. If that store is not part of the calculation, the relative value of each 
trading area is distorted. Sales per square foot decline most if new outlets are added in small com-
munities. The retailer should also consider if a new store will expand the total consumer market for 
a good or service category in a trading area or just increase its market share in that area without 
expanding the total market.
Next are three examples of how retailers factor trading-area saturation into their decisions:
▶
▶Urban Outfitters (www.urbn.com) is an omnichannel lifestyle specialty retailer that 
operates Urban Outfitters (average store 9,000 square feet); Free People (average store 
1,800 square feet); Anthropologie, Terrain, and BHLDN (average store 7,000 square feet); 
as well as E-commerce Web sites, mobile applications, and catalogs. It competes with online 
and offline stores, including those that sell its wholesale Free People products and chain 
fashion specialty and department stores in competitive domestic and international markets. 
Declines in discretionary spending on fashion, overstored U.S. retail space (where there is 
five times more space per person compared to that of Great Britain, France, and Japan),17 
and more comparison shopping online can force markdowns—a promotional sales environ-
ment—that negatively affect profit margins.
▶
▶The retail drugstore industry is highly competitive. Prescription drug sales account for more 
than half of sales revenues in the industry, but profit margins are low due to insurers and 
Medicare/Medicaid. Rite Aid (www.riteaid.com), the third-largest drugstore chain (with 
4,560 stores) competes with other retail drugstore chains, independently owned drugstores, 
supermarkets, mass merchandisers, discount stores, wellness offerings, dollar stores, and 
mail-order pharmacies. Consolidation in the drugstore industry, the aggressive discounting 
of generic drugs by supermarkets and mass merchandisers (e.g., Walmart), and the increase 
of promotional incentives to drive prescription sales further increase competitive pressures. 
To expand overall profitability and higher market share, Rite Aid acquired pharmacy benefit 
manager (PBM) Envision Rx to access prescription files to see what are likely to be customer 
generators for higher margin “front-end” (e.g., nonprescription) goods and services (such 
as photo printing) and mini-clinics in stores. Rite Aid is rebuilding its real-estate portfolio 
by adding stores to fill out understored trading areas, in addition to store remodels and 
relocations.18
▶
▶Marketing Guidebook (www.marketingguidebook.com) has data for retailers selling food—
including population size, number of households, total food store sales, number of food stores 
by type of retailer (such as supermarkets versus membership clubs), and more—that can be 
used to measure the level of saturation by U.S. city and community.

1.	 To demonstrate the importance of store location for a 
retailer and to outline the process for choosing a store 
location. Location choice is critical due to complex deci-
sion making, high costs, lack of flexibility once a site is 
chosen, and the impact of a site on the strategy. A good 
location may let a retailer succeed even if its strategy mix 
is relatively mediocre.
The selection of a store location includes (1) evaluat-
ing alternative trading areas, (2) determining the best 
type of location, (3) picking a general site, and (4) set-
tling on a specific site. This chapter looked at Step 1. 
Chapter 10 details Steps 2, 3, and 4.
2.	 To discuss the concept of a trading area and its 
related components. A trading area is the geographi-
cal area from which customers are drawn. When shop-
ping locales are nearby, they may have trading-area 
overlap.

262 
Part 4  •  Choosing a Store Location
Many retailers utilize geographic information system 
(GIS) software to delineate and analyze trading areas. 
The software combines digitized mapping with key data 
to depict trading areas. This allows retailers to research 
alternative locations and display findings on comput-
erized maps. Vendors market GIS software, based on 
TIGER mapping by the U.S. government.
Each trading area has primary, secondary, and fringe 
components. The farther people live from a shopping 
area, the less apt they are to travel there. The size and 
shape of a trading area depend on store type, store size, 
competitors, housing patterns, travel time and traffic 
barriers, and media availability. Destination stores have 
larger trading areas than do parasite stores.
3.	 To show how trading areas may be delineated for exist-
ing and new stores. The size, shape, and characteristics 
of the trading area for an existing store or group of stores 
can be learned accurately—based on store records, con-
tests, license plate numbers, surveys, and so on. Time 
biases must be considered in amassing data. Results 
should be mapped and customer densities noted.
Potential trading areas for a new store must often 
be described in terms of opportunities rather than cur-
rent patronage and traffic. Trend analysis and consumer 
surveys may be used. Three computerized models are 
available for planning a new store location: analog, 
regression, and gravity. They offer several benefits.
Two techniques for delineating new trading areas are 
Reilly’s law, which relates the population size of differ-
ent cities to the size of their trading areas; and Huff’s 
law, which is based on each area’s shopping assortment, 
the distance of people from various retail locales, and 
sensitivity to travel time.
4.	 To examine three major factors in trading-area analysis: 
population characteristics, economic base characteris-
tics, and competition and the level of saturation. The 
best sources for population data are the Census of Popu-
lation and other publicly available sources. Census data 
are detailed and specific, but become dated. Information 
from public sources such as the American Community 
Survey may be more current but report on broader geo-
graphic areas.
An area’s economic base reflects the community’s 
commercial and industrial infrastructure, as well as 
residents’ income sources. A retailer should look at the 
percentage of the labor force in each industry, the trans-
portation network, the banking facilities, the potential 
impact of economic fluctuations on the area, and the 
future of individual industries. Easy Analytic software 
and Editor & Publisher Market Guide are good sources 
of data on the economic base.
A trading area cannot be properly analyzed without 
studying the nature of competition and the level of satu-
ration. An area may be understored (too few retailers), 
overstored (too many retailers), or saturated (the proper 
number of retailers). Saturation may be measured in 
terms of the number of persons per store, average sales 
per store, average store sales per capita or household, 
average sales per square foot of selling space, and aver-
age sales per employee.

Chapter 
Objectives
1. To thoroughly examine 
the types of locations 
available to a retailer: 
isolated store, unplanned 
business district, and 
planned shopping center
2. To note the decisions 
necessary in choosing a 
general retail location
3. To describe the 
concept of the one-
hundred percent location
4. To discuss several 
criteria for evaluating 
general retail locations 
and the specific sites 
within them
5. To contrast  
alternative terms of 
occupancy
In recent years, shopping centers have faced intense competition from big-box stores in 
isolated or strip locations, outlet shopping areas, and online retailers—including those with 
traditional store locales. As a result, more shopping-center operators are utilizing social media 
to lure and retain customers.
Research by the Georgia Institute of Technology found that about one-third of malls 
nationwide are considered dead; only one-third are considered truly healthy.1 The large 
continuing number of store closings threaten to affect the vitality of existing shopping centers 
where the closings are located. Among retailers that have implemented and announced store 
closings in the last few years are Macy’s, Sears, Target, J. C. Penney, and Office Depot.
Many closed locations are in shopping centers where the retailer has been an anchor tenant, 
in terms of square footage and its ability to attract customers to the mall. Analysts cite several 
reasons for the store closings: overstoring, the popularity of the Web (especially Amazon), the 
increased competition for shoppers by different store formats, and the attractiveness of small-
store formats (based on fewer product selections).
An important concern when a major traffic-generating store closes is its impact on the 
remaining retail tenants. In addition to image issues associated with an anchor-store vacancy 
is its effect on store traffic. This is especially significant when the closed store had a prominent 
position in the mall. Typically, traffic-generating stores are placed at opposite ends of a mall to 
attract customer traffic. Stores closest to the vacant store may suffer the most.

CHAPTER 10  •  Site Selection	
265	
There are also challenges when renting a store’s vacated space. New tenants may require a 
significant rent reduction in comparison to the previous tenant. Many department stores are 
huge and have multiple levels; other store formats cannot easily adapt to that space.
Overview
After a retailer investigates alternative trading areas (Step 1), it determines what type of location 
is desirable (Step 2), selects the general location (Step 3), and evaluates alternative specific store 
sites (Step 4). Steps 2, 3, and 4 are discussed in this chapter.
Identifying the right location at the right price is critical to success for any retailer. In addition 
to careful planning and conservatively budgeting space needs and requirements, retailers also need 
to consider the following five steps in site selection:2
1.	 Know the characteristics of customer segments shopping at the location. This is critical in site 
selection. Retailers such as Starbucks and Target use specific location and shopper profiles 
that incorporate numerous data points. Firms can use scoring systems to rate “quality” of 
alternative retail sites on factors such as visibility, access, population size, household income, 
and traffic. Predictive analytics can be used to forecast sales performance at low, medium, 
and high location quality retail sites.3 A minimum acceptable score can be applied as the 
baseline and other sites can be evaluated based on marginal contribution to predicted store 
performance. Retailers need to take into consideration the limitations of secondary data and 
model assumptions that may not be applicable to their particular business. Most importantly, 
they must physically verify the store location.4
2.	 Seek out locales with the highest sales potential. The rent charged for a site should reflect 
the sales revenue that can be generated there. Marginal analysis of rent paid versus increase 
in store performance can be used to rule out high-rent sites that are not worth the investment.
3.	 Understand the current state of the retail leasing market to see whether a landlord’s rent is 
fair (reasonable). Evaluating multiple qualified locations as backups is a prudent practice. 
Not only does this help in negotiating for the most preferred choice but if the preferred choice 
does not work out it helps alleviate uncertainty and frustration.
4.	 Research co-tenants in a shopping center or shopping district to see if they are compatible and 
attract customers likely to patronize the new retailer. Pedestrian and vehicular traffic counts 
indicate whether co-tenants are good for the newly arriving retailer. Anchor stores determine 
the basic customer profile of the location, but the type of smaller tenants is equally important.
5.	 Consider the long-term commitment. Leases typically are in force for at least 5 years—and 
many times, longer than that.
TYPES OF LOCATIONS
There are three different location types: isolated store, unplanned business district, and planned 
shopping center. Each has its own attributes as to the composition of competitors, parking, near-
ness to nonretail institutions (such as office buildings), and other factors. Step 2 in the location 
process is to determine which type of location to use.
The Isolated Store
An isolated store is a freestanding retail outlet located on either a highway or a street. There are 
no adjacent retailers with which this type of store shares traffic. The advantages of this type of 
retail location are many:
▶
▶There is no competition in close proximity.
▶
▶Rental costs are relatively low.
▶
▶There is flexibility; no group rules affect operations, and larger space may be obtained.
▶
▶Isolation is good for stores involved in one-stop or convenience shopping.
▶
▶Better road and traffic visibility is possible.
▶
▶Facilities can be adapted to individual specifications.
▶
▶Easy parking can be arranged.
▶
▶Cost reductions are possible, leading to lower prices.
The Small Business 
Administration offers lots 
of advice on site selection 
(www.sba.gov/content/
tips-choosing-business-
location).

266 
Part 4  •  Choosing a Store Location
There are also various disadvantages to this retail location type:
▶
▶Initial customers may be difficult to attract.
▶
▶Many people will not travel very far to get to one store on a continuous basis.
▶
▶Most people like variety in shopping.
▶
▶Advertising expenses may be high.
▶
▶Costs such as outside lighting, security, grounds maintenance, and trash collection are not 
shared.
▶
▶Other retailers and community zoning laws may restrict access to desirable locations.
▶
▶A store must often be built rather than rented.
▶
▶As a rule, unplanned business districts and planned shopping centers are much more popular 
among consumers; they generate most of retail sales.
Large-store formats (such as Walmart supercenters and Costco membership clubs) and 
­convenience-oriented retailers (such as 7-Eleven) are usually the retailers best suited to isolated 
locations due to the challenge of attracting a target market. A small specialty store would prob-
ably be unable to develop a customer following; people would be unwilling to travel to a store 
that does not have a large assortment of products or a strong image for merchandise and/or prices.
Years ago, numerous shopping centers forbade discounters because discounting was frowned 
on by anchor retailers. This forced discounters to seek isolated sites or to build their own centers; 
and they have been successful. Today, diverse retailers are in isolated locales as well as at business 
district and shopping center sites. Retailers using a mixed-location strategy include McDonald’s, 
Target, Sears, Starbucks, Toys “R” Us, Walmart, and 7-Eleven. Some retailers, including many 
gas stations and convenience stores, still emphasize isolated locations. See Figure 10-1.
The Unplanned Business District
An unplanned business district is a type of retail location where two or more stores situate 
together (or in close proximity) in such a way that the total arrangement or mix of stores is not 
due to prior long-range planning. Stores locate based on what is best for them, not the district. 
For example, four shoe stores may exist in an area with no pharmacy. There are four kinds of 
unplanned business districts: central business district, secondary business district, neighborhood 
business district, and string. A discussion of each follows.
CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT  A central business district (CBD) is the hub of retailing in a city. 
It is synonymous with the term downtown. The CBD exists where there is the greatest density 
of office buildings and stores. Both vehicular and pedestrian traffic are very high. The core of a 
CBD is often no more than a square mile, with cultural and entertainment facilities surrounding 
it. Shoppers are drawn from the whole urban area and include all ethnic groups and all classes 
of people. The central business district has at least one major department store and a number of 
FIGURE 10-1

Gas stations often situate 
in locations where they 
are not adjacent to other 
retailers. Favorite spots 
include side roads off 
major highways and 
corners of streets that 
have a lot of vehicular 
traffic. These gas stations 
typically have a small 
convenience store 
(operated by the gas 
stations) on the premises.

specialty and convenience stores. The arrangement of stores follows no pre-set format; it depends 
on history (first come, first located), retail trends, and luck.
Here are some strengths that allow central business districts to draw a large number of 
shoppers:
▶
▶Excellent goods/service assortment
▶
▶Access to public transportation
▶
▶Variety of store types and positioning strategies within one area
▶
▶Wide range of prices
▶
▶Variety of customer services
▶
▶High level of pedestrian traffic (see Figure 10-2)
▶
▶Nearness to commercial and social facilities
In addition, chain headquarters stores are often situated in central business districts.
These are some of the inherent weaknesses of the CBD:
▶
▶Inadequate parking, as well as traffic and delivery congestion
▶
▶Travel time for those living in the suburbs
▶
▶Frail condition of some cities—such as aging stores—compared with their suburbs
▶
▶Relatively poor image of central cities to some potential consumers
▶
▶High rents and taxes for the most popular sites
▶
▶Movement of some popular downtown stores to suburban shopping centers
▶
▶Discontinuity of offerings (such as four shoe stores and no pharmacy)
The central business district remains a major retailing force, although its share of overall sales 
has fallen over the years, as compared with the planned shopping center. Besides the weaknesses 
cited, much of the drop-off of business is due to suburbanization. In the first half of the twentieth 
century, most urban workers lived near their jobs. Gradually, many people moved to suburbs—
where they are often served by planned shopping centers.
A number of CBDs are doing well, however, and many others are striving to return to their 
prior stature. They use such tactics as modernizing storefronts and equipment, forming merchants’ 
associations, modernizing sidewalks and adding brighter lighting, building vertical malls (with 
several floors of stores), improving transportation networks, closing streets to vehicular traffic 
(sometimes with disappointing results), bringing in “razzmatazz” retailers such as Apple stores, 
and integrating a commercial and residential environment known as mixed-use facilities. The 
renewed popularity of living in urban areas by Millennials and Baby Boomers creates retail needs 
that go beyond those of the transient daytime population. Vibrant urban shopping districts with 
mixed-use properties, access to public transport, and entertainment districts appeal to diverse 
lifestyles and are a competitive advantage for cities.5
A good example of the value of a revitalized CBD is Philadelphia, where there has been 
a strong long-term effort under way to make the central city more competitive with suburban 
FIGURE 10-2
The Central 
Business District 
and Pedestrian 
Traffic
One of the main 
advantages of the central 
business district—such as 
the Japanese CBD shown 
here—is the massive 
amount of pedestrian 
traffic that passes by 
retailers. This includes 
tourists, residents, and 
commuters who work in 
the CBD.

Part 4  •  Choosing a Store Location
shopping centers. Consider these facts about Philadelphia’s central business district: $1.5 billion 
is being spent in streetscape, façade, and public-area improvements to construct 5.5 million square 
feet of leasable space. Also, some 27,000 new housing units will be added by 2019, convert-
ing vacant office buildings, factories, and empty lots into condos, apartments, and single-family 
housing. This will result in a transformation of neighborhoods, an increase in population, and 
revitalized retail development. Empty Nesters and Millennials, who make up 40 percent of Phila-
delphia’s center city population, work and live in the city; and the average household income has 
been rising. The influx of such retailers as high-end furniture maker Thos. Moser, Vince, Under 
Armor, Lululemon, Nordstrom Rack, and Bloomingdale’s Outlet is extending the area to nearby 
neighborhoods and ancillary corridors. Many successful E-commerce sites, including Warby 
Parker, Bonobos, and Athleta, are establishing brick-and-mortar stores here.6
Boston’s Faneuil Hall is another long-term CBD renovation success. When developer James 
Rouse took over the site originally called Quincy Market, it had three 150-year-old, block-long for-
mer food warehouses that were abandoned for nearly a decade. Rouse used landscaping, fountains, 
banners, open-air courts, street performers, and colorful graphics to enable Faneuil Hall “America’s 
First Open Marketplace” to capture a festive spirit. Faneuil Hall now combines shopping, eating, and 
entertainment. Today, it has 100 shops and Bull Market pushcart vendors, 13 full-service restaurants, 
35 food stalls, and regular events and entertainment. It attracts 18 million shoppers and visitors yearly.7
Other major CBD revitalization projects have included Annapolis Town Centre (Maryland), 
Branson Landing (Missouri), City Center District (Dallas), Harborplace Baltimore, Peabody Place 
(Memphis), Pioneer Place (Portland, Oregon), Grand Central Terminal (New York City), Tower 
City Center (Cleveland), and Union Station (Washington, D.C.).
SECONDARY BUSINESS DISTRICT  A secondary business district (SBD) is an unplanned shopping 
area in a city or town that is usually bounded by the intersection of two major streets. Cities—
particularly larger ones—often have multiple SBDs, each with at least a junior department store 
(a branch of a traditional department store or a full-line discount store) and/or some larger spe-
cialty stores, besides many smaller stores. This format is now more important because cities have 
“sprawled” over larger geographic areas.
The kinds of goods and services sold in an SBD mirror those in the CBD. However, a sec-
ondary business district has smaller stores, less width and depth of merchandise assortment, 
and a smaller trading area (consumers will not travel as far), and it sells a higher proportion of 
convenience-oriented items.
The SBD’s major strengths include a good product selection, access to thoroughfares and 
public transportation, less crowding and more personal service than in a central business district, 
and placement nearer to residential areas than a CBD. The SBD’s major weaknesses include the 
discontinuity of offerings, the sometimes high rent and taxes (but not as high as in a CBD), traffic 
and delivery congestion, aging facilities, parking difficulties, and fewer chain outlets than in the 
CBD. These weaknesses have generally not affected the SBD as much as the CBD—and parking 
problems, travel time, and congestion are less for the SBD.
NEIGHBORHOOD BUSINESS DISTRICT  A neighborhood business district (NBD) is an unplanned 
shopping area that appeals to the convenience shopping and service needs of a single residential 
area. An NBD contains several small stores, such as a dry cleaner, a stationery store, a barber 
shop and/or a beauty salon, a liquor store, and a restaurant. The leading retailer tends to be a 
Grand Central Terminal 
(www.grandcentralterminal 
.com) is all dressed up and 
open for shopping and 
dining.
There are a number of issues related to retail leasing in a shop-
ping center that pose ethical issues for the developer, major 
tenants, smaller retailers, and consumers. Some issues are due 
to the bargaining power possessed by large retail tenants. Oth-
ers are because of the data available to developers and by bank 
financing requirements. Large retailers may seek to reduce com-
petition via lease terms that restrict specific types of retailers. 
This often restricts category killers or discount stores from 
opening units in a regional shopping center. In a percentage 
lease, a shopping-center developer knows the net sales of all 
tenants. Financing of shopping centers is based on the credit 
rating of retail tenants, which typically excludes small indepen-
dent retailers.

supermarket or a large drugstore. This type of business district is situated on the major street(s) 
of its residential area.
A neighborhood business district offers a good location, long store hours, good parking, and a 
less hectic atmosphere than a central business district or secondary business district. On the other 
hand, there is a more limited selection of goods and services, and prices tend to be higher because 
competition is less than in a CBD or SBD.
STRING  A string is an unplanned shopping area comprising a group of retail stores, often with 
similar or compatible product lines, located along a street or highway. There is little extension 
of shopping onto perpendicular streets. A string may start with an isolated store, success then 
breeding competitors. Car dealers, antique stores, and apparel retailers often situate in strings.
A string location has many of the advantages of an isolated store site (lower rent, more 
­flexibility, better road visibility and parking, and lower operating costs), along with some disadvan-
tages (less product variety, increased travel for many consumers, higher advertising costs, zoning 
restrictions, and the need to build premises). Unlike an isolated store, a string store has competition 
at its location. This draws more people to the area and allows for some sharing of common costs. 
It also means less control over prices and less loyalty toward each outlet. An individual store’s 
increased traffic flow, due to being in a string rather than an isolated site, may be greater than the 
customers lost to competitors. This explains why four gas stations locate on opposing corners.
Figure 10-3 shows a map with various unplanned business districts and isolated locations.
The Planned Shopping Center
A planned shopping center consists of a group of architecturally unified commercial establish-
ments on a site that is centrally owned or managed, designed and operated as a unit, based on 
balanced tenancy, and accompanied by parking facilities. Its location, size, and mix of stores are

related to the trading area served. Through balanced tenancy, the stores in a planned shopping 
center complement each other as to the quality and variety of their product offerings, and the 
kind and number of stores are linked to overall population needs. To ensure balanced tenancy, 
management of a planned center usually specifies the proportion of total space for each kind of 
retailer, limits product lines that can be sold by every store, and stipulates what kinds of firms can 
acquire unexpired leases. At a well-run center, a coordinated and cooperative long-run retailing 
strategy is followed by all stores.
The planned shopping center has several positive attributes:
▶
▶Well-rounded assortments of goods and services based on long-range planning
▶
▶Strong suburban population
▶
▶Interest in one-stop, family shopping
▶
▶Cooperative planning and sharing of common costs
▶
▶Creation of distinctive, but unified, shopping center images
▶
▶Maximization of pedestrian traffic for individual stores
▶
▶Access to highways and availability of parking for consumers
▶
▶More appealing than city shopping for some people
▶
▶Generally lower rent and taxes than CBDs (except for enclosed regional malls)
▶
▶Generally lower theft rates than CBDs
▶
▶Popularity of malls—both open (shopping area off-limits to vehicles) and closed (shopping 
area off-limits to vehicles and all stores in a temperature-controlled facility)
▶
▶Growth of discount malls and other newer types of shopping centers
There are also some limitations associated with the planned shopping center:
▶
▶Landlord regulations that reduce each retailer’s flexibility, such as required hours
▶
▶Generally higher rent than an isolated store
▶
▶Restrictions on the goods/services that can be sold by each store
▶
▶A competitive environment within the center
▶
▶Required payments for items that may be of little or no value to an individual retailer, such 
as membership in a merchants’ association
▶
▶Too many malls in a number of areas (“the malling of America”)
▶
▶Rising consumer boredom with and disinterest in shopping as an activity
▶
▶Aging facilities of some older centers
▶
▶Domination by large anchor stores
There are 115,000 U.S. shopping centers (including convenience, power, lifestyle, and theme 
centers, as well as airport retailing); 1,000 centers are enclosed malls. Shopping center revenues 
exceed $2.4 trillion annually and account for nearly one-half of U.S. retail-store sales (including 
autos and gasoline). About 12.5 million people work in shopping centers. Eighty-five percent 
of Americans over age 18 visit some type of shopping center in an average month. Nordstrom, 
Macy’s, Foot Locker, Gap, Sephora, and Hallmark are among the vast number of chains with a 
strong presence at shopping centers. Some big retailers have also been involved in shopping-center 
development. Sears has participated in the construction of dozens of shopping centers, and Publix 
Supermarkets operates centers with hundreds of small tenants. Each year, numerous new centers 
of all kinds and sizes are built, and retail space is added to existing centers.8 See Figure 10-4.
To sustain their long-term growth, shopping centers are engaging in these practices:
▶
▶Several older centers have been renovated, expanded, and/or repositioned. Cherry Hill Mall 
in Philadelphia; Hamilton Place Mall in Chattanooga; Kentucky Oaks Mall in Paducah, 
­Kentucky; McCain Mall in Little Rock, Arkansas; Westfield Trumbull Shopping Center in 
Trumbull, Connecticut; and Yorkdale Shopping Centre Mall in Toronto, Canada, have all been 
revitalized. Visit our blog (www.bermanevansretail.com) for information on shopping centers.
▶
▶Certain derivative types of centers foster consumer interest and enthusiasm. Three of these—
megamalls, lifestyle centers, and power centers—are discussed a little later in this chapter.
▶
▶Shopping centers are responding to shifting lifestyles. They have made parking easier; added 
ramps for baby strollers and wheelchairs; and included distinctive retailers such as the Apple 
Store, Apricot Lane, BCBG Max Azria, Juicy Couture, MaxMara, Michael Kors, Rue 21, and 
Zumiez. They have also introduced more information booths and center directories.
Shopping centers in some 
form have existed for 
more than 1,000 years.

▶
▶The retailer mix has broadened at many centers to attract people wanting one-stop shopping. 
More centers now include banks, stockbrokers, dentists, doctors, beauty salons, TV repair 
outlets, and/or car rental offices. Centers may also include “temporary tenants” (retailers that 
lease space, often in mall aisles or walkways, and sell from booths or moving carts). Tenants 
benefit from the lower rent and short-term commitment; centers benefit by creating more 
shopping excitement and diversity. Consumers then discover new vendors in unexpected 
places.
▶
▶Open-air malls are gaining popularity because they are less expensive to build, which means 
lower rents and common-area costs. Many people also like the outdoor shopping experience. 
A popular example is the Mall at Partridge Creek, an open-air regional center in Clinton 
Township, Michigan. It is anchored by Nordstrom, Carson’s, and a 14-screen cinema. The 
center has 90 stores and restaurants. What gives it a special flair? “Partridge Creek has ameni-
ties unique to malls in Michigan, including: Bocce ball courts, free Wi-Fi, pop-jet fountains, a 
TV court, and a 30-foot fireplace.”9 Free events—including concerts, Wellness Wednesdays, 
and walking clubs—create community involvement and offer retailers opportunities to engage 
with shoppers.
▶
▶More center developers are striving to build their own brand loyalty. Simon and Westfield 
are among those that have spent millions of dollars to boost their images by promoting 
their own names—with the Simon Mall name prominently featured at its shopping centers. 
Simon (www.simon.com) owns and/or manages 230 properties in North America, Europe, 
and Asia.10
▶
▶Some shopping centers use frequent-shopper programs to retain customers and track spend-
ing. Simon Insiders earn VIP parking spots and invitations to private mall events in addition 
to cash back when they spend more than $1,000 in a month at Simon Property Group malls.11
There are three types of planned shopping centers: regional, community, and neighborhood. 
Their characteristics are noted in Table 10-1, and they are described next.

Unlike trading-area analysis work that can be done at a desk 
with a computer, site-selection jobs require travel to proposed 
sites. These personnel need to compile traffic counts, assess the 
composition of adjacent stores, judge parking adequacy, and 
determine store visibility. Since these employees are involved with 
negotiating leases, they need strong bargaining skills and legal 
knowledge. Some long-term leases have escalator clauses that 
raise rents over time and may require retail tenants to pay all or 
part of increases in real-estate taxes and insurance. Some large 
chains use their legal staff for complex negotiations. Smaller firms 
hire attorneys to negotiate.

Part 4  •  Choosing a Store Location
REGIONAL SHOPPING CENTER  A regional shopping center is a large, planned shopping facility 
appealing to a geographically dispersed market. It has at least one or two department stores (each 
with at least 100,000 square feet) and 40 to 125 or more smaller retailers. A regional center offers 
a very broad and deep assortment of shopping-oriented goods and services intended to enhance 
the consumer’s visit. The market is 100,000+ people who live or work up to a 30-minute drive 
away. On average, people travel under 20 minutes. A significant trend among regional shopping 
centers is to add category killers as anchor tenants to replace closed department stores. General 
Growth Properties has filled 79 of 83 vacant department store locations with such tenants as H&M, 
Dick’s Sporting Goods, and Wegman’s Food Markets.12
The regional center is the result of a planned effort to re-create the shopping variety of a 
central city in suburbia. Some regional centers have become the social, cultural, and vocational 
focal point of a suburban area. They may be used as a town plaza, a meeting place, a concert hall, 
and a place for a brisk indoor walk. Despite the declining overall interest in shopping, on a typi-
cal visit to a regional shopping center, many people spend an average of an hour or more there.
The first outdoor regional shopping center opened in 1950 in Seattle, anchored by a branch 
of Bon Marche, then a leading downtown department store. Southdale Center (outside Minne-
apolis), built in 1956 for Target Corporation (then Dayton Hudson), was the first fully enclosed, 
climate-controlled mall. Today, there are about 1,250 U.S. regional centers of various kinds, and 
this format has popped up around the world (where small stores still remain the dominant force) 
from Australia to Brazil to India to Malaysia.

CHAPTER 10  •  Site Selection

One type of regional center is the megamall, an enormous planned shopping center with 
800,000+ square feet of retail space, multiple anchor stores, up to several hundred specialty 
stores, food courts, entertainment facilities, and a trade area size of up to 25 miles. It seeks to 
heighten interest in shopping and expand the trading area. There are 625 U.S. megamalls in the 
United States.13 The largest is the Mall of America (www.mallofamerica.com) in Bloomington, 
Minnesota. It has three anchors (Macy’s, Nordstrom, and Sears), 520 specialty stores, a 14-screen 
movie theater, a health club, 50 restaurants, a Nickelodeon Universe indoor amusement park, an 
aquarium, and 12,550 parking spaces—with 4.2 million square feet of building space. The mall 
has stores for every budget, attracts between 35 to 40 million visitors yearly (40 percent of visi-
tors are tourists). Beijing, China’s Jinyuan Yansha shopping center (nicknamed the “Great Mall of 
China”) is the largest megamall in the world. It is 1.5 times the size of Mall of America, with over 
1,000 shops and 6 million square feet of space. See Figure 10-5 for another leading megamall.
COMMUNITY SHOPPING CENTER  A community shopping center is a moderate-sized, planned 
shopping facility with a branch department store (traditional or discount) and/or a category killer 
store, as well as several smaller stores (similar to those in a neighborhood center). It offers a 
moderate assortment of shopping- and convenience-oriented goods and services to consumers 
from one or more nearby, well-populated, residential areas. About 20,000 to 100,000 people who 
live or work within a 10- to 20-minute drive are served by this location. There are 10,000 com-
munity shopping centers in the United States.
Better long-range planning occurs for a community shopping center than a neighborhood 
shopping center. Balanced tenancy is usually enforced, and cooperative promotion is more prob-
able. Store composition and the center’s image are kept pretty consistent with pre-set goals.
Two noteworthy variations of the community center (not included in Table 10-1) are the 
power center and the lifestyle center. A power center is a shopping site with (1) up to a half-dozen 
or so category-killer stores and a mix of smaller stores or (2) several complementary stores spe-
cializing in one product category. A power center usually occupies 200,000 to 600,000 square feet 
on a major highway or road intersection. It seeks to be quite distinctive to draw shoppers and better 
compete with regional centers. There are 2,250 U.S. power centers.14 An example of a power 
Mall of America’s 
attractions (www

impressive as the mall 
itself.

center is 280 Metro Center in Colma, California. The center’s tenants include such category-killer 
retailers as Marshalls, Nordstrom Rack, Old Navy, David’s Bridal, and Pier 1 Imports.
A lifestyle center is an open-air shopping site that typically includes 150,000 to 500,000 
square feet of space dedicated to upscale, well-known specialty stores as well as dining and enter-
tainment. The focus is often on apparel, home products, books, music, and restaurants. Popular 
stores at lifestyle centers include Ann Taylor, Banana Republic, Bath & Body Works, Gap, Pottery 
Barn, Talbots, Victoria’s Secret, and Williams-Sonoma. Examples of lifestyle shopping centers 
include Aspen Grove in Littleton, Colorado; Deer Park Town Center in Illinois; Rookwood Com-
mons in Cincinnati, Ohio; and CocoWalk in Coconut Grove, Florida. At present, there are about 
460 such centers in the United States.15
NEIGHBORHOOD SHOPPING CENTER  A neighborhood shopping center is a planned shopping 
facility, with the largest store being a supermarket or a drugstore. Other retailers often include a 
bakery, laundry, dry cleaner, stationery store, barbershop or beauty parlor, hardware store, restau-
rant, liquor store, and gas station. This center focuses on convenience-oriented goods and services 
for people living or working nearby. It serves 3,000 to 50,000 people who are within a 15-minute 
drive (usually less than 10 minutes). See Figure 10-6.
A neighborhood center is usually arranged in a strip. Initially, it is carefully planned and tenants 
are balanced. Over time, the planned aspects may lessen and newcomers may face fewer restrictions. 
Thus, a liquor store might replace a barbershop—leaving a void. A center’s ability to maintain bal-
ance depends on its attractiveness to potential tenants (expressed by the extent of store vacancies). 
In number, but not in selling space or sales, neighborhood centers account for 75 percent of all U.S. 
regional, community, and other shopping centers.
THE CHOICE OF A GENERAL LOCATION
The last part of Step 2 in location planning requires a retailer to select a locational format: isolated, 
unplanned district, or planned center. The decision depends on the firm’s strategy and a careful 
evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative.
FIGURE 10-6

CHAPTER 10  •  Site Selection	
275	
Next, in Step 3, the retailer chooses a broadly defined site. Two decisions are needed here. 
First, the specific kind of isolated store, unplanned business district, or planned shopping cen-
ter location is selected. If a firm wants an isolated store, it must decide on a highway or side 
street. Should it desire an unplanned business area, it must decide on a central business district, 
a secondary business district, a neighborhood business district, or a string. A retailer seeking a 
planned area must choose a regional, community, or neighborhood shopping center—and decide 
whether to use a derivative form such as a megamall or power center. Here are the preferences 
of two retailers:
▶
▶Guitar Center, privately owned by CNL-KKR, operates more than 260 Guitar Center stores in 
44 states and 120 Music & Arts stores in 19 states. Among the Guitar Center stores, 62 percent 
are primary format units, 33 percent are secondary format units, and 5 percent are tertiary 
format units. The retailer selects the store format based on the size of the market in which it 
is located. Primary format stores range in size from 13,000 to 30,000 square feet and serve 
major metropolitan population centers. Secondary format stores range from 8,000 to 14,000 
square feet and serve metropolitan areas not served by primary format stores. Tertiary market 
stores of 5,000 square feet serve smaller populations.16
▶
▶Apple Stores are usually located at high-traffic locations in premium shopping malls and 
urban shopping districts in about a dozen countries, including the United States. Apple owns 
and operates 400 of its own stores, thereby attracting new customers by ensuring a high-
quality buying experience. Stores are designed to simplify and enhance the presentation and 
marketing of Apple products and related items. Store configurations of various sizes have 
evolved to address market-specific demands.17
The second decision is that a firm must select its general store placement. For an isolated 
store, this means choosing a specific highway or side street. For an unplanned district or planned 
center, this means selecting a specific district (e.g., downtown Los Angeles) or center (e.g., La 
Gran Plaza in Fort Worth, Texas).
In Step 3, the retailer narrows down the decisions made in the first two steps and then chooses 
a general location. Step 4 requires the firm to evaluate specific alternative sites, including their 
position on a block (or in a center), the side of the street, and the terms of tenancy. Factors to be 
considered in assessing and choosing a general location and a specific site within that location 
are described together in the next section because many strategic decisions are similar for these 
two steps.
LOCATION AND SITE EVALUATION
Assessment of general locations and the specific sites within them requires extensive analysis. 
In any area, the optimum site for a particular store is called the one-hundred percent location. 
Because different retailers need different kinds of sites, a location labeled as 100 percent for one 
firm may be less desirable for another. An upscale ladies’ apparel shop would seek a location 
unlike one sought by a convenience store. The apparel shop would benefit from pedestrian traffic, 
closeness to major department stores, and proximity to other specialty stores. The convenience 
store would rather be in an area with ample parking and vehicular traffic. It does not need to be 
near other stores.
Figure 10-7 has a location/site evaluation checklist. A retailer should rate each alternative 
location (and specific site) on all the criteria and develop overall ratings for them. Two firms may 
rate the same site differently. This figure should be used in conjunction with the trading-area data 
in Chapter 9, not instead of them.
Pedestrian Traffic
The most crucial measures of a location’s and site’s value are the number and type of people pass-
ing by. Other things being equal, a site with the most pedestrian traffic is often best.
Not everyone passing a location or site is a good prospect for all types of stores, so many firms 
use selective counting procedures, such as counting only those with shopping bags. Otherwise, 
pedestrian traffic totals may include many nonshoppers. It would be improper for an appliance 
retailer to count as prospective shoppers all people passing a downtown site on the way to work. 
Much downtown pedestrian traffic may be from those who are there for nonretailing activities.
Guitar Center (www 
.guitarcenter.com) has a 
well-conceived location 
plan.

276 
Part 4  •  Choosing a Store Location
A proper pedestrian traffic count should encompass these four elements:
▶
▶Separation of the count by age and gender (with very young children not counted).
▶
▶Division of the count by time (this allows the study of peaks, low points, and changes in the 
gender of the people passing by the hour).
▶
▶Pedestrian interviews (to find out the proportion of potential shoppers).
▶
▶Spot analysis of shopping trips (to verify the stores actually visited).
Vehicular Traffic
The quantity and characteristics of vehicular traffic are very important for retailers that appeal 
to customers who drive there. Convenience stores, outlets in regional shopping centers, and car 
washes are retailers that rely on heavy vehicular traffic. Automotive traffic studies are essential in 
suburban areas, where pedestrian traffic is often limited.
As with pedestrian traffic, adjustments to the raw count of vehicular traffic must be made. 
Some retailers count only homeward-bound traffic, some exclude vehicles on the other side of a 
divided highway, and some omit out-of-state cars. Data may be available from the state highway 
department, the county engineer, or the regional planning commission.
Besides traffic counts, the retailer should study the extent and timing of congestion (from 
traffic, detours, and poor roads). People normally avoid congested areas and shop where driving 
time and driving difficulties are minimized.
Parking Facilities
Many U.S. retail stores include some provision for nearby off-street parking. In many business 
districts, parking is provided by individual stores, arrangements among stores, and local govern-
ment. In planned shopping centers, parking is shared by all stores there. The number and quality 
of parking spots, their distances from stores, and the availability of employee parking should all 
be evaluated. See Figure 10-8.

CHAPTER 10  •  Site Selection	
277	
The need for retailer parking facilities depends on the store’s trading area, the type of store, 
the proportion of shoppers using a car, the existence of other parking, the turnover of spaces 
(which depend on the length of a shopping trip), the flow of shoppers, and parking by nonshop-
pers. A shopping center normally needs 4 to 5 parking spaces per 1,000 square feet of gross floor 
area, a supermarket 10 to 15 spaces, and a furniture store 3 or 4 spaces.
Free parking sometimes creates problems. Commuters and employees of nearby businesses 
may park in spaces intended for shoppers. This problem can be lessened by validating shoppers’ 
parking stubs and requiring payment from nonshoppers. Another problem may occur if the selling 
space at a location increases due to new stores or the expansion of current ones. Existing parking 
may then be inadequate. Double-deck parking or parking tiers save land and shorten the distance 
from a parked car to a store—a key factor because customers at a regional shopping center may 
be unwilling to walk more than a few hundred feet from their cars to the center.
Transportation
Mass transit, access from major highways, and ease of deliveries must be examined. For example, 
in a downtown area, closeness to mass transit is important for people who do not own cars, who 
commute to work, or who would not otherwise shop in an area with traffic congestion. The avail-
ability of buses, taxis, subways, trains, and other kinds of public transit is a must for any area not 
readily accessible by vehicular traffic.
Locations dependent on vehicular traffic should be rated on nearness to major thoroughfares. 
Driving time is a consideration for many people. Also, drivers heading eastbound on a highway 
often do not like to make a U-turn to get to a store on the westbound side of that highway.

tend to have plentiful 
free parking—with no 
time limits. However, 
most shoppers want to 
be close as possible to a 
shopping center or store 
entrance. As shown in this 
aerial view of a regional 
shopping center, that 
is not always possible, 
particularly during busy 
periods such as holidays.

Pop-up stores are typically leased for short time periods. Such 
stores have one of two themes: to show exciting new prod-
ucts and styles or to sell-off surplus inventory. Alex Eagle (www 
.alexeagle.co.uk) used a pop-up store for a one-week period in 
Tuscany, located at an exclusive hotel, to highlight a new col-
lection of clothes. Orlebar Brown’s (www.orlebarbrown.com) 
pop-up store in Somerset, England, offered its high-end men’s 
clothing at up to 70 percent off usual prices. Pop-up stores ben-
efit both the retailer and the property owner. The retailer can use 
the store without having to sign a long-term lease. The property 
owner can secure rental income for a space that would otherwise 
be vacant.
How would your site-selection process differ for a pop-up 
versus a traditional store?

Part 4  •  Choosing a Store Location
The transportation network should be studied for delivery truck access. Some thoroughfares 
are excellent for cars but ban large trucks or cannot bear their weight.
Store Composition
The number and size of stores should be consistent with the type of location. A retailer in an 
isolated site wants no stores nearby; a retailer in a neighborhood business district wants an area 
with 10 to 15 small stores; and a retailer in a regional shopping center wants a location with many 
stores, including large department stores (to generate customer traffic).
If the stores at a given location (be it an unplanned district or a planned center) complement, 
blend, and cooperate with one another, and each benefits from the others’ presence, affinity exists. 
When affinity is strong, the sales of each store are greater, due to the high customer traffic, than 
if the stores are apart. The practice of similar or complementary stores locating near each other is 
based on two factors: First, customers like to compare the prices, styles, selections, and services 
of similar stores. Second, customers like one-stop shopping and like to purchase at different stores 
on the same trip. Affinities can exist among competing stores as well as among complementary 
stores. More people travel to shopping areas with large selections than to convenience-oriented 
areas, so the sales of all stores are enhanced.
One measure of compatibility is the degree to which stores exchange customers. Stores in 
these categories are very compatible with each other and have high customer interchange:
▶
▶Supermarket, drugstore, bakery, fruit-and-vegetable store, meat store
▶
▶Department store, apparel store, hosiery store, lingerie shop, shoe store, jewelry store
Retail balance, the mix of stores within a district or shopping center, should also be con-
sidered. (1) Proper balance occurs when the number of store facilities for each merchandise or 
service classification is equal to the location’s market potential, (2) a range of goods and services 
is provided to foster one-stop shopping, (3) there is an adequate assortment within any category, 
and (4) there is a proper mix of store types (balanced tenancy).
Specific Site
Selecting the specific site for the retail store depends on visibility; placement in the location, 
size, and shape of the lot; size and shape of the building; and condition and age of the lot and 
building.
Visibility is a site’s ability to be seen by pedestrian or vehicular traffic. A site on a side street 
or at the end of a shopping center is not as visible as one on a major road or at the center’s entrance. 
High visibility increases store awareness.
Placement in the location is a site’s relative position in the district or center. A corner location 
may be desirable because it is situated at the intersection of two streets and has “corner influence.” 
It is usually more expensive because of the greater pedestrian and vehicular passersby due to 
traffic flows from two streets, increased window display area, and less traffic congestion through 
multiple entrances. Corner influence is greatest in high-volume locations. That is why some  
Pier 1 stores, Starbucks restaurants, and other retailers seek corner sites. See Figure 10-9.
A convenience-oriented firm, such as a stationery store, is very concerned about the side of 
the street, the location relative to other convenience-oriented stores, nearness to parking, access 
to a bus stop, and the distance from residences. A shopping-oriented retailer, such as a furniture 
store, is more interested in a corner site to increase window display space, proximity to wallpaper 
and other related retailers, the accessibility of its pick-up platform to consumers, and the ease of 
deliveries to the store.
When a retailer buys or rents an existing building, its size and shape should be noted. Condi-
tion and age of the lot and the building should be studied, as well. A department store, of course, 
requires much more space than a boutique. It may desire a square site, whereas the boutique 
might prefer a rectangular one. Any site should be viewed in terms of total space needs: parking, 
walkways, selling, nonselling, and so on.
Due to the saturation of many desirable locations and the lack of available spots in oth-
ers, some firms have turned to nontraditional sites—often to complement their existing stores. 
T.G.I. Friday’s, Staples, and Bally have airport stores. Subway has outlets in many Walmarts, 
and Subway and some other fast-food retailers share facilities to provide more variety and to 
share costs.

 
CHAPTER 10  •  Site Selection

Terms of Occupancy
Terms of occupancy—ownership versus leasing, type of lease, operations and maintenance costs, 
taxes, zoning restrictions, and voluntary regulations—must be evaluated for each prospective site.
OWNERSHIP VERSUS LEASING  A retailer with adequate funding can either own or lease premises. 
Ownership is more common in small stores, in small communities, or at inexpensive locations. It 
has several advantages. There is no chance that a property owner will not renew a lease or double 
the rent when a lease expires. Monthly mortgage payments are stable. Operations are flexible; a 
retailer can engage in scrambled merchandising and break down walls. It is also likely that prop-
erty value will appreciate over time, resulting in a financial gain if the business is sold. Ownership 
disadvantages are high initial costs, long-term commitment, and inability to readily change sites. 
Home Depot owns about 90 percent of its store properties.18
If a retailer chooses ownership, the next decision is whether to construct a new facility or 
buy an existing building. Considerations include purchase price and maintenance costs, zoning 
restrictions, age and condition of existing facilities, adaptability of existing facilities, and time 
to erect a new building. To encourage building rehabilitation in towns with 5,000 to 50,000 
people, Congress enacted the Main Street America program (www.mainstreet.org) of the National 
Trust for Historic Preservation. It has a network of statewide, citywide, and regional programs 
actively serving more than 2,000 towns, which benefit from planning support, tax credits, and 
low-interest loans.
The great majority of stores in central business districts and regional shopping centers are 
leased (with Home Depot sometimes being one of the exceptions), mostly due to the high invest-
ment for ownership. Department stores tend to have renewable 20- to 30-year leases, supermarkets 
usually have renewable 15- to 20-year leases, and specialty stores often have 5- to 10-year leases 
with options to extend. Some leases give the retailer the right to end an agreement before the 
expiration date—under given circumstances and for a specified retailer payment.
Leasing minimizes initial investment, reduces risk, provides access to prime sites that cannot 
add more stores, leads to immediate occupancy and traffic, and reduces long-term commitment. 
Many retailers feel they can open more stores or spend more on their strategies by leasing. Firms 
that lease accept limits on operating flexibility, restrictions on subletting and selling the business, 
possible nonrenewal problems, rent increases, and not gaining from rising real-estate values.
Through a sale-leaseback, some large retailers build stores and then sell them to real-estate 
investors who lease the property back to the retailers on a long-term basis. Retailers using 
­sale-leasebacks build stores to their specifications and have bargaining power in leasing—while 
lowering capital expenditures.

Part 4  •  Choosing a Store Location
TYPES OF LEASES  Property owners do not rely solely on constant rent leases, partly due to 
their concern about interest rates and the related rise in operating costs. Terms can be quite 
complicated.19
The simplest, most direct arrangement is the straight lease—a retailer pays a fixed dollar 
amount per month over the life of the lease. Rent usually ranges from $1 to $75 annually per 
square foot, depending on the site’s desirability and store traffic. At some sites, rents can be much 
higher. On New York’s Fifth Avenue, the average yearly rental rate ranges up to $3,500 per square 
foot! This is the world’s highest retail rental rate.20
A percentage lease stipulates that rent is related to sales or profits. This differs from a straight 
lease, which requires constant payments. A percentage lease protects a property owner against 
inflation and lets it benefit if a store is successful; it also allows a tenant to view the lease as a 
variable cost—rent is lower when its performance is weak and higher when performance is good. 
The percentage rate varies by type of shopping district or center and by type of store.
Percentage leases have variations. With a specified minimum, low sales are assumed to be 
partly the retailer’s responsibility; the property owner receives minimum payments (as in a straight 
lease) no matter what the sales or profits. With a specified maximum, it is assumed that a very 
successful retailer should not pay more than a maximum rent. Superior merchandising, promo-
tion, and pricing should reward the retailer. Another variation is a sliding scale: The ratio of rent 
to sales changes as sales rise. A sliding-down scale has a retailer pay a lower percentage as sales 
go up and is an incentive to the retailer.
A graduated lease calls for precise rent increases over a stated period of time. Monthly rent 
may be $4,800 for the first 10 years and $5,600 for the last 10 years of a lease. Rent is known in 
advance by the retailer and the property owner; it is based on expected sales and cost increases. 
There is no need to audit sales or profits, as with percentage leases. This lease is often used with 
small retailers.
A maintenance-increase-recoupment lease has a provision allowing rent to increase if a 
property owner’s taxes, heating bills, insurance, or other expenses rise beyond a certain point. 
This provision most often supplements a straight rental lease agreement.
A net lease calls for all maintenance costs (such as heating, electricity, insurance, and interior 
repair) to be paid by the retailer. It frees the property owner from managing the facility and gives 
the retailer control over store maintenance. It supplements a straight lease or a percentage lease.
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS  After assessing ownership and leasing opportunities, a retailer must 
look at the costs of operations and maintenance. The age and condition of a facility may cause 
a retailer to have high monthly costs, even though the mortgage or rent is low. Furthermore, the 
costs of extensive renovations should be calculated.
Differences in sales taxes (those that customers pay) and business taxes (those that retailers 
pay) among alternative sites must be weighed. Business taxes should be broken down into real-
estate and income categories. The highest statewide sales taxes are in California (7.5 percent) and 
in Indiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Tennessee (7 percent); Alaska, Delaware, 
Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon have no state sales tax.
There may be zoning restrictions as to the kind of stores allowed, store size, building height, 
type of merchandise carried, and other factors that have to be hurdled (or another site chosen). For 
example, many communities believe their local retail economies can handle only so many new 
Tiffany (www.tiffany

with glamour, is one of the 
cornerstone retailers on 
New York’s high-rent Fifth 
Avenue.

Software firms such as Accruent (www.accruent.com), ­LeaseEagle 
(www.leaseagle.com), and VisualLease (www.visuallease 
.com) have automated details involved with complex retail leases. 
Many retailers as well as owners of retail properties use lease 
management software to reconcile a property owner’s billings 
with specific lease clause stipulations, calculate CPI (consumer 
price index—a measure of inflation) escalations, track expense 
increases on year-to-year basis for further review; monitor critical 
dates for lease payment and lease renewal, and generate sales 
reports required for percentage leases.

stores without causing some existing firms to fail. Thus, they have passed zoning regulations or 
store size caps that forbid retail stores from exceeding a given size. This helps local communities 
sustain the vitality of small, pedestrian-oriented business districts, keep commercial retail space 
affordable, and nurture local retailers. Size caps can prevent traffic congestion and overburdened 
public infrastructure. They require all retailers, including retail chains such as Walmart, to build 
stores that are properly sized for the community. Cities that have adopted size caps find that, in 
some cases, retailers that typically build larger stores will opt not to open; in other cases, they will 
design smaller stores. Size caps also ensure that retail space is affordable for local business. 21
Voluntary restrictions are prevalent in planned shopping centers and may include required 
membership in merchant groups, uniform hours, and shared security forces. Leases in regional 
centers have had clauses protecting anchor tenants from too much competition from discounters. 
Clauses may also involve limits on product lines, fees for common services, and so on. Anchors 
are protected because developers need long-term commitments to finance the centers. The Federal 
Trade Commission discourages “exclusives,” whereby only a certain retailer can carry specified 
merchandise, and “radius clauses,” whereby a tenant agrees not to have another store within a 
certain distance.
Because of overbuilding, some retailers are in a good position to bargain over the terms of 
occupancy. This differs from city to city and from shopping location to shopping location.
Overall Rating
The last task in choosing a store location is to compute overall ratings:
1.	 Each location under consideration is given an overall rating based on the criteria in  
Figure 10-7.
2.	 The overall ratings of alternative locations are compared, and the best location is chosen.
3.	 The same procedure is used to evaluate the alternative sites within the location.
It is often difficult to compile and compare composite evaluations because some attributes 
may be positive whereas others are negative. The general location may be a good shopping center, 
but the site in the center may be poor, or an area may have excellent potential but it takes 2 years 
to build a store. The attributes in Figure 10-7 should be weighted according to their importance. 
An overall rating should also include knockout factors—those that preclude consideration of a 
site. Possible knockout factors are a short lease, little or no evening or weekend pedestrian traffic, 
and poor tenant relations with the landlord.

Chapter Summary
1.	 To thoroughly examine the types of locations available 
to a retailer: isolated store, unplanned business district, 
and planned shopping center. After a retailer rates alter-
native trading areas, it decides on the type of location, 
selects the general location, and chooses a particular site. 
There are three basic locational types.
An isolated store is freestanding, not adjacent to other 
stores. It has no competition, low rent, flexibility, road 
visibility, easy parking, and lower property costs. It also 
has a lack of traffic, no variety for shoppers, no shared 
costs, and zoning restrictions.
An unplanned business district is a shopping area 
with two or more stores located together or nearby. Store 
composition is not based on planning. There are four 
categories: central business district, secondary business 
district, neighborhood business district, and string. An 
unplanned district generally has these favorable points: 
variety of goods, services, and prices; access to public 
transit; nearness to commercial and social facilities; 
and pedestrian traffic. Yet, its shortcomings have led to 
the growth of the planned shopping center: inadequate 
parking, older facilities, high rents and taxes in popular 
CBDs, discontinuity of offerings, traffic and delivery 
congestion, high theft rates, and some declining central 
cities.
A planned shopping center is centrally owned or 
managed and well balanced. It usually has one or more 
anchor stores and many smaller stores. The planned 
center is popular, due to extensive goods and service 
offerings, expanding suburbs, shared strategic planning 
and costs, attractive locations, parking facilities, lower 
rent and taxes (except for regional centers), lower theft 
rates, the popularity of malls (although some people are 
now bored with them), and the lesser appeal of inner-city

Part 4  •  Choosing a Store Location
shopping. Negative aspects include operations inflexibil-
ity, restrictions on merchandise carried, and anchor-store 
domination. There are three forms: regional, community, 
and neighborhood centers.
2.	 To note the decisions necessary in choosing a general 
retail location. First, the specific form of isolated store, 
unplanned business district, or planned shopping center 
location is determined, such as whether to be on a highway 
or side street; in a CBD, an SBD, an NBD, or a string; or in 
a regional, community, or neighborhood shopping center. 
Then the general store location is specified—singling out 
a particular highway, business district, or shopping center.
3.	 To describe the concept of the one-hundred percent loca-
tion. Extensive analysis is required in assessing each gen-
eral location and specific sites within it. Importantly, the 
optimum site for a given store must be determined. This 
is the one-hundred percent location; it differs by retailer.
4.	 To discuss several criteria for evaluating general retail 
locations and the specific sites within them. Pedestrian 
traffic, vehicular traffic, parking facilities, transportation, 
store composition, the attributes of each specific site, and 
terms of occupancy should be studied. An overall rating 
is then computed for each location and site, and the best 
one selected.
Affinity occurs when the stores at the same location 
complement, blend, and cooperate with one another; 
each benefits from the others’ presence.
5.	 To contrast alternative terms of occupancy. A retailer 
can opt to own or lease. If it leases, terms are specified 
in a straight lease, percentage lease, graduated lease, 
maintenance-increase-recoupment lease, and/or net 
lease. Operating and maintenance costs, taxes, zoning 
restrictions, and voluntary restrictions also need to be 
reviewed.

Short Cases
Case 1: Are Smaller and Faster Better?*
As the grocery industry diversifies, whose lunch will get eaten? 
The first 365 formatted stores from Whole Foods Market opened 
in mid-2016. Kroger opened the first Main & Vine in February 
2016. Fresh Formats, an Ahold company, debuted bfresh stores 
in fall 2015; and Fresh Thyme Farmer’s Market, which opened 
its first store in 2014, is on course to operate 60 units by 2019. 
Each of these concepts operates in smaller footprint settings. 
There’s an emphasis on fresh foods (especially a large selection 
of produce), along with organic items and artisanal specialties, 
and price points are rooted in value.
Google Express launched in 2016 by offering same-day 
delivery of fruit, vegetables, meat, and more in select San Fran-
cisco and Los Angeles neighborhoods; Whole Foods invested in 
Instacart; and Kroger is expanding online ordering and in-store 
pick-up. Amazon’s Prime Pantry and AmazonFresh initiatives 
are taking a bite out of the food retailing apple, and a grow­
ing number of subscription services—including Blue Apron, 
Plated, and HelloFresh—are angling for a slice of the pie by 
offering meal-in-a-box solutions.
With numerous competitors eating off every section of 
their plate, could traditional supermarkets be in real danger? 
The consensus among supermarket industry experts is “no”—
but it comes with a caveat. “If you define traditional supermar-
kets in terms of Kroger, then they look quite well,” says John 
Rand, senior vice-president of retail insights for Kantar Retail. 
“If you define it in terms of some other chains, then they look 
less well. Some of the top supermarkets in the country are super 
regionals, chains such as Publix, H-E-B, and Wegmans. These 
guys are growing faster than average, so they’re doing just fine.”
Steven Pinder, retail strategist at Kurt Salmon, says consum-
ers “are shifting and changing . . . spending habits across the plat-
forms available to us, but we’re not doing so in grocery nearly as 
quickly or as much as in other formats. Consumers’ adoption of 
technology and omnichannel shopping behavior is not taking off 
in this segment the way those things have in others.”
Not everyone, however, is optimistic about the fate of the 
45,000-square-foot supermarket, with its predictable fresh perim-
eter and center store setup featuring aisles of packaged and canned 
items, frozen foods, and household essentials. “The conventional 
supermarket is a dinosaur,” says Phil Lempert, a food industry 
analyst. “It doesn’t serve the needs of today’s shopper who is 
looking for more exciting offerings.” Lempert identifies two types 
of food stores that are clicking with shoppers: small stores con-
centrating on fresh items, and “grocerants”—stores that blend 
grocery and restaurant. Operators providing sit-down restaurants 
on premises “are also on the rise. Stores like Hy-Vee or Wegmans 
are saying, ‘We’re all things food — sit down and eat a meal now, 
then take home some fresh items to make dinner tomorrow.”’
Against the backdrop of a fast-changing marketplace, some 
legacy banners are ceding share to smaller, more nimble entrants. 
Others, such as Walmart and Kroger, the two biggest in terms

Magazine, April 2016, pp. 24–27. Reprinted by permission. Copyright

of supermarket sales, are refusing to let others eat their lunch. 
AlthoughWalmart has pulled the plug on its 12,000-square-foot 
Walmart Express food and merchandise pilot stores, it is com-
mitted to the food-dominant, 40,000-square-foot Neighborhood 
Market format. Along with the Main & Vine project, Kroger 
operates Turkey Hill Markets and Mariano’s.
Experts say it’s incumbent on retailers to choose a niche. 
Rand divides supermarkets into three segments: premium, 
mainstream, and value. Premium supermarkets are projected 
to pull in about 19 percent of grocery sales from 2015 to 2020; 
mainstream will account for nearly 33 percent, and the value 
segment will be the largest at nearly 48 percent.

Case 2: Organize, Optimize, Synchronize*
To get closer to its customers, American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) 
conducted several site assessments that factored in its customer 
population, order profiles, transportation, and labor costs. Chris-
tine Miller, the firm’s director of operations, says AEO estab-
lished a strategy based on what its road map would look like for 
the next 5 years: A second fulfillment center with omnichannel 
capabilities was needed to support AEO’s continued growth, 
as well as to get physically closer to customers. “Most of our 
customer base, online and in stores, is on the East Coast,” Miller 
says, “and we needed to be closer to our customers.”
The firm also needed to improve direct-to-consumer fulfill-
ment time. With the Kansas facility in the middle of the coun-
try, getting to either coast took too long: On average, Miller 
says AEO took anywhere from 5 to 7 days to deliver an order. 
“Reducing that time was definitely something that was a goal 
for us and a challenge, just based on having that one facility in 
the middle of the country,” she says.
After securing the Hazleton, Pennsylania location, AEO 
selected the Vargo Solutions company to design the opera-
tions of the 1 million-square-foot facility—everything from 
processes to equipment. Vargo synchronizes operations in ful-
fillment centers with its continuous order-fulfillment system. 
Carlos Ysasi, Vargo’s vice-president of systems engineering, 
says the key to efficiency was creating “channel-immune” dis-
tribution centers that use one inventory, one workforce, and one 
fulfillment engine to meet the inventory needs of physical stores 
and E-commerce. “Having separate distribution centers for the 
channels doubles your costs.”

Part 4  •  Choosing a Store Location
Before, workers unloaded incoming trailers to build, move, 
and reorganize pallets, which Ysasi says “required everything to 
be touched multiple times,” and every process had a buffer sys-
tem that needed a lot of space. The new system lets cartons be 
quickly placed on the conveyor and “pulled” anywhere needed 
in the facility. The facility is also free of mobile equipment. 
There is no need for pallet storage or for pallets to move in 
the center. Material handling maximizes up-time and optimizes 
energy efficiency.
Vargo’s continuous order fulfillment enterprise system 
extends functionality beyond traditional warehouse execution 
systems. The system can control all work resources, including 
machinery and associates, and organize, optimize, sequence, 
and synchronize everything across the work process.
All inventory at the Hazleton facility is loaded directly onto 
conveyors in the receiving mezzanine and sent to two sorters 
with automatic variable-speed controls that adjust the through-
put demands. The sorters can automatically detect surges or 
declines in flows and adjust speed to more efficiently accom-
modate activity. Inventory is then routed to pick modules in a 
four-level, 400-foot-long picking structure in a 288,000-square-
foot section of the facility. Operators pull products from the 
conveyors using a radio frequency picking process. Along the 
entire route, conveyors are controlled by photo eyes that sense 
totes, so the conveyor remains off when a product doesn’t need 
to move anywhere.
Sections of motorized roller conveyors are divided into 
small zones that can be independently powered and operated, 
creating an on-demand system that increases energy savings 
and decreases noise. Miller says the system also saves space 
and is easier to use. “There’s not a big motor hanging from the 
conveyors every 10 feet,” she says. “We were able to lower them 
and there’s a big ergonomic benefit for the workers. There’s 
also less maintenance, and they’re efficient because they only 
run when needed.”
With the new distribution center, 90 percent of direct 
orders are fulfilled in 2 to 3 days.

Case 3: Removing Barriers to Cross-Border 
Commerce*
If you ask online retailers what methods of payment they accept, 
most would say credit cards. But a study of global E-commerce 
payments found that in many parts of the world, credit cards 
account for a very small portion of payments made online. The 
conclusion? Retailers need to expand significantly the number 
of payment options they accept if they want to compete success-
fully in the global market.
“The 2015 Global E-Commerce Payments Guide,” by pay-
ments company Adyen, found that cross-border E-commerce 
is growing at a rate more than double that of domestic E-com-
merce; the global market is expected to reach more than $2 
trillion by 2017. Yet, credit cards won’t be used to pay for many 
online purchases. The study found that in China, 1 percent of 
online shoppers pay with international credit-card brands; in 
Germany, only 25 percent use credit cards in making an online 
purchase.
“The main payment method differs a lot around the world, 
and, in order, for a retailer to support a global customer base, 
it must be able to accept a wide range of payment options,” 
says Adyen’s chief commercial officer Roelant Prins. It is 
not always easy for retailers to accept a wide range of pay-
ments because each form comes with its own technical and 
security concerns. “You need for multiple people inside your 
organization—from technology support to customer support 
to marketing—to be aware of differences in payment options 
and how they work. There is a huge mindset that people pay 
by credit card. But if you want to expand internationally, that 
is not always the case. You must be prepared for alternative 
systems.”
For example, China is the largest retail E-commerce mar-
ket in the world. Yet, with just 1 percent of online purchases 
made via international credit cards, Asian payment com-
pany Alipay has about a 48 percent market share; interbank 
network UnionPay accounts for about 14 percent. Tenpay, 
a mobile payment program, accounts for 19 percent of the 
market.
China isn’t the only market with a growing interest in 
mobile shopping. The rate of online payments using mobile 
devices continues to rise around the world, according to Ady-
en’s Mobile Payments Index, which now accounts for more than 
25 percent of all online payments made during the first quarter 
of this year.
Europe leads the world in adopting mobile payments; 29 
percent of online purchases are made via a mobile device. The 
United States showed considerable growth as well, increas-
ing nearly 5 percentage points to 27 percent over one 6-month 
period in 2015 alone. During 2015, Asian markets saw more 
than 20 percent of online transactions conducted on mobile 
devices for the first time.
To deal with the complexity, Prins recommends retailers 
hire a payments firm with global expertise. Even retailers that 
do not want to leave their current payments processors can use 
existing processors for domestic payments and use a global spe-
cialist for foreign sales. In Europe, for example, consumers are 
often directed to a separate site to make payments rather than 
pay directly to the retailer. Settlement can also be different in 
the speed at which retailers receive money and the costs they 
pay to settle a transaction.
Fraud is also a concern, as online sales from certain 
parts of the world represent a much greater payment fraud 
threat than transactions from other areas. Retailers need help 
in assessing and mitigating fraud risk from various foreign 
transactions.

Case 4: Warehouse Management: Right Time, 
Right Place*
There’s an evolution from the existing physical and technical 
warehouse management infrastructure to capabilities offering 
multiple methods to store, pick, and process orders. Dan Grimm, 
solution strategist at JDA, sees progress in a number of areas of 
warehouse management systems (WMS), including value-added 
services (VAS), food safety, the use of voice, and mobile tech-
nology. A VAS (and food safety) example Grimm provides is 
capturing temperature in the nose, middle, and tail of a trailer to 
be sure it’s in the range for refrigerated or frozen food, and indi-
cating whether products can go to the store, require more testing, 
or are rejected. This means standard methods are followed. One 
warehouse trend is the use of voice to replace paper and RF 
(radio frequency) technology, giving retailers better productivity.
Mobility, Grimm notes, has given warehouse supervisors 
the abilities to do their job and be on the floor. “The new mobile 
technology lets them have real-time visibility, make changes from 
a tablet device, and be on the floor with employees, all at once.” 
Trends he anticipates are omnichannel fulfillment and multiple 
methods to store, pick, and process orders; warehouse optimiza-
tion by having better visibility of demand within the network; and 
in-store logistics in which retailers adapt WMS to be used in stores.
Eric Lamphier, a senior director at Manhattan Associates, 
says labor management (LM) issues have been addressed by his 
firm by embedding an LM module inside the WMS solution and 
making the module part of every conversation, including sales, 
implementation, support, and upgrades. Food retailers’ “pioneer-
ing efforts in this area have paid off. Our focal point has been tablet 
capabilities delivered via a hybrid mobile app that provides distri-
bution center managers with real-time data about the operation.”
Reducing total cost of ownership is an ongoing chal-
lenge, according to Lamphier, who says Manhattan Associ-
ates is continuing to advance its Management Center module, 
which handles installation, cloning, monitoring, patching, and 
synchronization for all platform solutions. “These capabilities 
have been shown to lower implementation times and costs so 
our customers can realize benefits more rapidly.”
Lamphier notes that E-commerce order-fulfillment expec-
tations, approaches, and standard operating procedures have 
evolved rapidly over the past decade and require sophisticated, 
nonstop integration between warehouse management and the 
Enterprise Order Management suite. “We expect the future to 
be full of these projects as investments go mainstream, and 
upgrade and replacement cycles transpire.”
At HighJump, territory manager Roger Falkenstein says 
online firms meet the E-commerce challenge by turning the 
store environment into a distribution center, resulting in such 
new requirements as supporting consumer-grade devices, dis-
playing product images to help locate mixed-SKU item loca-
tions, enabling workflows for item substitutions, handling 
variable-weight and -temperature items, and fostering interac-
tion between store associates and customers to manage special 
needs, exceptions, and various delivery methods. “We’ve taken 
our traditional warehouse platform and built applications to 
support store requirements and to drive efficiency, control, and 
visibility throughout the in-store fulfillment process.”
A remaining challenge, as Falkenstein sees it, is the train-
ing of high-turnover staff. Driving efficiency is a priority, and 
grocers are looking for user-friendly tools to train employees 
quickly. “HighJump’s philosophy is to have simple instructions, 
“directing users step by step with optimized workflows and 
minimized walk times. This helps keep the learning curve low 
and labor costs at a profitable level.”
Questions

store location planning.
2.	 Comment on this statement: A key future trend will involve

the entrance is fresh, fresh, fresh.” A wide variety of colorful 
produce is joined by a wall of spices offering a vast array of 
authentic selections.
Some shoppers think the store is bigger than it is, Solis 
notes. “The color package for the remodel is more open and 
vibrant.” We’ve gotten comments like ‘Have you made the 
store larger?”’ That visibility extends to the revamped deli and 
prepared food area, the aforementioned Cocina. Solis says the 
Cocina area used to be framed by a “hacienda-type fixture” that 
is being removed in the ongoing remodelings. “It has really 
opened things up,” he says. “Right from the entrance, you can 
see these departments and the bright colors.”
Further enhancing the visibility in the store was the con-
solidation of the seating in a larger fixed dining area, rather 
than spread around the deli department; the new configura-
tion allows visitors an unobstructed view through produce 
to the deli and bakery. “It’s become a destination to stay 
and eat a meal,” Solis says of the dining area, noting that “a 
lot of people do take food home.” The Cocina offers daily 
breakfast and lunch specials as well as family meal deals. 
On Sundays mornings, it hosts a three-hour live mariachi 
performance.
Authenticity is on full display in the Cocina. “We’re known 
for our authentic Mexican foods, offered daily,” Solis declares. 
On the menu on the day of Progressive Grocer’s visit were 
red and green chilies, carnitas (pork), caldos (Mexican soup), 
menudo (tripe soup), tamales, burritos, and carne asada (con-
sidered by certain locals as the best in town).
“Our chicken category is a substantial part of our busi-
ness,” Solis says. The Cocina offers several varieties—fried, 
grilled, and rotisserie, plus pollo ranchero (peppers and toma-
toes) and pollo chipotle (pepper cream sauce). Seafood includes 
ceviche (citrus-cured seafood), shrimp cocktail, and camaron 
aguachiles (shrimp in lime and chiles), the last of which Solis 
says is “very unique and very authentic.”
A dedicated case offers fresh salsas, pico de gallo, and 
guacamole, some items made in house. Another huge draw for 
the deli is aguas frescas—icy house-made fruit beverages in fla-
vors such as cantaloupe, lemonade, pineapple, and watermelon, 
plus horchata, a creamy rice-milk beverage. “We really hang 
our hat on the authenticity of our aguas frescas,” Solis says. “It 
definitely sets us apart from the others.” The beverage lineup 
also includes champurrado, a popular Hispanic hot chocolate, 
available ready to drink in the deli; there’s also a do-it-yourself 
mix sold in the center of the store.
Sweet Showcase
Authenticity continues into the store’s scratch-bakery selec-
tions. “We do doughnuts, but it’s on a much smaller scale. 
Here, it’s all about the pan dulce,” Solis says, referring to tra-
ditional Mexican sweet bread. It’s offered in many varieties, 
including shell-shaped conchas, sweet and savory empanadas, 
telleras (sandwich rolls), and bollilos (crusty bread rolls). 
There are also cortadillos (sliced cakes in dozens of variet-
ies) and mantecadas, which Solis describes as “like a cupcake 
without any icing, but so moist, a unique flavor. It’s a great 
item for us.”
Autenticidad en Acción: Mexican Delights the Real 
Deal at Food City Remodel*
Introduction
When it comes to food, today’s consumers are more sophisti-
cated and knowledgeable than ever. For a truly rewarding gro-
cery store experience, shoppers want freshness, diversity, and 
authenticity. In response, grocery retailers have “upped” their 
games in those areas, even some value/price operators.
Food City Overview
A case in point is Food City, the 47-unit Mexicentric banner 
owned by Chandler, Arizona–based Bashas’ Family of Stores. 
Its latest remodel—in South Tucson, where the store shares a 
bustling shopping center on Interstate 19 with Target, Home 
Depot, and others—reflects Food City’s commitment to fresh-
ness, authenticity, and, as evidenced by the mariachi band ser-
enading shoppers, a fun community experience.
From food to experience to outreach, Food City lives up to 
its Spanish headline of Autenticidad en Acción, which translates 
as “authenticity in action.” Food City has “a colorful new look 
that we have been rolling out in our store remodels since 2014,” 
explains Mike Solis, the banner’s director of operations. “Along 
with the refreshed décor, we have emphasized the areas that dif-
ferentiate Food City from the rest of the market and best meet 
the needs of our customers.”
Authenticity and connection to community have been on 
display from the start. When the remodel of the North Tuc-
son store was formally unveiled in December 2015, shop-
pers enjoyed food samples along with performances by 
Ballet Folklórico Tapatío dancers and music, including Tuc-
son’s acclaimed mariachi vocalist Monica Treviño.
The store’s signature offerings include the deli depart-
ment’s Cocina (literally, “kitchen”), offering authentic 
Mexican dishes to eat in or to take home; a bakery with the 
traditional pan dulce (sweet bread) and other ethnic selections; 
a tortillería, with on-site production of corn and flour torti-
llas; and a full-service meat department with authentic cuts, 
value-added offerings, and seafood. The remodel also deliv-
ered a reconfigured center store for more shopper-friendly 
navigation.
“Our strategy is to reinvest in our stores by upgrading and 
remodeling them to better serve the needs of our customers,” 
Solis says. “We completed 10 Food City store remodels in 2014 
and an additional 12 store remodels in 2015. We had even more 
store remodels planned for 2016.”
Fresh, Fresh, Fresh
Changes at the Irvington Road store are evident at the front 
door, with the produce department pulled forward to a more 
prominent position. “We moved it right to the entrance,” Solis 
explains. “It’s a huge draw to drive traffic. Our attention at

Part 4  •  Comprehensive Case 
287	
Full-size and single-serve cakes come in traditional tres 
leches, strawberry, chocolate, fan (custard), and chocoflan—
the last of which delivers rich custard over a chocolate-cake 
base. The bakery’s signature cakes are in such flavors as dulce 
de leche, cappuccino, piña colada, strawberry, and cookies and 
cream— all topped with huge strawberries. Parfait cups and 
gelatin with fruit round out the sweet selections.
As in the Cocina, the bakery’s kitchen is on full display. 
“That’s one of the things we’ve been focusing on,” Solis says of 
that enhanced visibility for shoppers. The redesign flip-flopped 
the positions of the self-serve and service bakery counters to 
further open up the kitchen, which also put the cake-decorating 
station at the front counter. Solis notes, “It’s a showcase for 
people to see the works of art we do on our cakes.”
The in-store tortillería, or tortilla bakery, has been a part of 
Food City stores for many years. “We run 19 of these machines 
throughout the company,” Solis says of the mini production 
plant. “Our flour tortillas are head and shoulders above any-
thing else in the market.”
With a 10-day shelf life, the tortillas come in assorted 
sizes and thicknesses for tacos, burritos, and other applications. 
The store also makes tortillas with manteca (lard) in the flour 
for a more traditional flavor profile. Meanwhile, corn tortillas 
come in different varieties for table use and frying. The store 
also makes tortilla chips for sale and serving in the Cocina.
Speaking of corn, Food City is into masa (corn flour) in a 
big way, as it is used widely in the local Hispanic community 
in preparing tamales and menudo. These dishes are made more 
often for the fall and winter holidays, so masa sales double, 
and even sometimes triple, during these periods, Solis notes. 
The store performs regular demonstrations on the sales floor to 
show uses and applications for different varieties of the masa. 
“We sell a lot of it,” Solis says. “This is one of the top-selling 
stores for masa out of all of the units that we have.”
For shoppers going that extra mile toward authenticity at 
home, Food City also sells nixtamal, the corn kernels that are 
ground to make the masa, which are also used to make menudo 
and posole (meat stew with hominy).
Consistency and Variety
There’s more authenticity on display in the meat department, 
which offers a full-service butcher counter, seafood, a wide selec-
tion of Mexican cheeses, the store’s signature chorizo (Mexican 
sausage), and marinated beef and chicken ready for the grill.
The service counter will cut meat to any thickness, but as 
Solis observes, “Our customers like thinner-cut meat.” That’s 
evidenced by the many cased offerings under the Food City 
label, like beef flaps for carne asada, merchandised alongside 
shrink-wrapped trays of cut vegetables for fajitas.
Cuts more familiar to folks outside the Hispanic commu-
nity are joined by local favorites such as oxtails, beef shanks, 
and beef short ribs, which Solis says are popular for making 
soups during colder months, along with neck bones, hearts and 
cheek meat.
The butcher counter also features a “phenomenal” vari-
ety of Mexican cheeses, Solis notes, offering samples of queso 
fresco, panela, cotija, and Oaxaca, the last a popular melting 
cheese (named for the Mexican province) used to make que-
sadillas. Of the value-added chorizo (sausage), Solis says, “It’s 
our in-house recipe, a real signature item.”
Seafood selections—expected to get an annual boost dur-
ing Lent—include tilapia, catfish, swai, cod, red snapper, and 
shrimp. “Tilapia is by far our best-selling seafood, whole or 
fillets,” Solis says.
Fresh chicken cuts are joined by pre-cooked breaded 
chicken wings, nuggets, and patties. “Chicken is a big category 
for us,” Solis reiterates, noting Food City’s “consistency and 
variety.” Solis points out the $19.99 value pack, which offers 
select cuts of beef, pork, and chicken, plus ground beef, valued 
at up to $25. “Our prices really address the price-conscious 
consumer throughout the entire store,” he says. Meanwhile, a 
coffin freezer offers “menudo packs”—bags of beef tripe or 
beef and pig feet, ready for use by folks making the traditional 
Mexican dish at home.
The remodel allowed for a larger meat department, Solis 
notes. “Based on the volume of sales at this store, we shifted 
down” farther along the perimeter, he says. “It definitely helped 
with our pork and chicken sections.”
Improving Shopability
The center of the store was reconfigured as part of the 
remodel, which Solis says required a period of adjustment 
as shoppers and associates got used to the new order of 
things. “We really changed the flow of the categories,” he 
says, explaining that this has helped to enhance “shopability 
around the perimeter.”
Among the key shifts: The beer and salty snack aisles were 
moved to the far end of the store for placement with the carbon-
ated soft drinks. Additionally, the store got rid of its warehouse 
shelving in favor of standard gondolas. End-of-aisle displays 
are massively merchandised. “We have a limited variety of 
SKUs in the center of the store, but we have what our consum-
ers like, and at a great value,” Solis says.
The store’s Hispanic aisle offers “groupings of our Mex-
ican-branded products in several different categories,” Solis 
explains. This row features everything from canned goods to 
crackers to religious figurines. There are myriad varieties of 
pepper — “a strong category for us,” Solis affirms—along with 
chili pastes and powders. There are also aloe vera drinks and 
coconut waters, which he notes “have exploded in popularity.” 
And for those who don’t want to buy authentic ingredients or 
pick some up ready to eat from the Cocina, there’s even canned 
menudo.
Cross-merchandising efforts throughout the store include 
store-brand bread with peanut butter and jelly on one end, and 
mayo and mustard on the other, and jarred nopalitos (cactus) 
displayed near the eggs, a pairing popular among Hispanics 
for Lent, Solis notes. Prominently displayed atop cases around 
the perimeter are 40-quart stockpots used for making menudo 
and tamales.
“The most rewarding part of the grand reopening has to 
be the excitement of our members [employees] and custom-
ers, who are enjoying the new look and feel of the store,” 
Solis declares. Associates’ excitement is no doubt increased 
by their ability to deliver the real deal to those who know the 
difference. “We really give the authenticity to the Hispanic 
consumer,” Solis says. “They can have all their needs met 
here.”

More about the Food City Chain
Arizona’s Food City is a low-price format supermarket chain 
offering a full range of ethnic and Hispanic food varieties along 
with traditional grocery store items. The community-focused 
grocery store chain is known for holding car-seat and water-
safety events, mobile dental clinics, back-to-school immuniza-
tions, backpack giveaways, and other cultural celebrations that 
are very important to the Hispanic community.
Investing heavily in the neighborhoods that it serves, Food 
City also holds annual signature events such as the Copa Food 
City Soccer Tournament and the Food City Tamale Festival. In 
addition, the banner supports many holidays and special events 
important to its shoppers, including Mexican concerts, Three 
Kings Day, Children’s Day, Mexico’s Independence Day (Sep-
tember 16), and Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead).
Dating back more than 60 years, Food City was acquired 
in 1993 by Bashas’ Grocery Store, which has since grown the 
brand from a single store to 47 locations, many of which are 
in metro Phoenix and southern Arizona, home to a significant 
Hispanic community.
Striving to hire people from its surrounding communities, 
Food City has saved and created thousands of jobs in many eco-
nomically challenged neighborhoods. Its diverse employee base 
allows it to serve consumers in their native language, creating a 
gratifying family shopping experience.

In Part Five, the elements of managing a retail enterprise are discussed. 
We first look at the steps in setting up a retail organization and the special human resource 
management environment of retailing. Operations management is then examined—from both 
financial and operational perspectives.
Chapter 11 reports how a retailer can use its organizational structure to assign tasks, 
policies, resources, authority, responsibilities, and rewards to satisfy the needs of the target 
market, employees, and management. We also show how human resource management can 
be applied so that the structure works properly. Human resource management consists of 
recruiting, selecting, training, compensating, and supervising personnel.
Chapter 12 focuses on the financial dimensions of operations management in enacting a 
retail strategy. We discuss these topics: profit planning, asset management (including the 
strategic profit model, other key ratios, and financial trends in retailing), budgeting, and 
resource allocation.
Chapter 13 presents the operational aspects of operations management. We cover these 
specific concepts: operations blueprint; store format, size, and space allocation; personnel 
utilization; store maintenance, energy management, and renovations; inventory management; 
store security; insurance; credit management; computerization; and crisis management.

Superior human resource management in retailing not only requires that a firm hire and 
train good employees but the firm must also keep them motivated. With the high employee 
turnover rate in retailing, this is not an easy task. One estimate is that the cost of replacing 
a $10 per hour retail employee averages more than $3,300.1 Since the turnover rate among 
some retailers can easily exceed 70 percent per year, costs related to employee turnover can 
amount to a very large expenditure.
Strategies a retailer can use to reduce turnover among low-wage employees include:
▶
▶Promote from within. This rewards long-time employees In addition, it lets short-term 
employees directly observe role models who have advanced to managerial positions.
▶
▶Be understanding. Grant exceptions to occasional lateness or absenteeism if there is good 
cause (sickness, family crisis, etc.).
▶
▶Make the job relevant to company goals. Show employees the value of short waiting 
lines, clean facilities, and customer-service–centric employees.

Overview
Managing a retail business comprises three steps: setting up an organization structure, hiring 
and managing personnel, and managing operations—financially and nonfinancially. The first 
two steps of this procedure are covered in this chapter. Chapters 12 and 13 deal with operations 
management.
SETTING UP A RETAIL ORGANIZATION
Through a retail organization, a firm structures and assigns tasks (functions), policies, resources, 
authority, responsibilities, and rewards to efficiently and effectively satisfy the needs of its target 
market, employees, and management. Figure 11-1 shows various needs that should be taken into 
account when planning and assessing an organization’s structure.
As a rule, a firm cannot survive unless its organization structure satisfies the target market, 
no matter how well employee and management needs are met. A structure that reduces costs

preferences will lose market share. Although many retailers perform similar tasks (buying, pric-
ing, displaying, and wrapping merchandise), there are many ways of organizing to conduct these 
functions. The process of setting up a retail organization, shown in Figure 11-2, is described next.
Specifying Tasks to Be Performed
The tasks in a distribution channel must be enumerated and then keyed to the chosen strategy mix 
for effective retailing to occur:
▶
▶Buying merchandise on behalf of the retailer
▶
▶Shipping merchandise to the retailer
▶
▶Receiving merchandise and checking incoming shipments
▶
▶Setting prices and marking merchandise
▶
▶Inventory storage and control
▶
▶Preparing merchandise and window displays
▶
▶Facilities maintenance (e.g., keeping the store clean)
▶
▶Customer research and exchanging information
▶
▶Customer contact (e.g., Web site, personal selling)
▶
▶Facilitating shopping (e.g., convenient location, short checkout lines)
▶
▶Customer follow-up and complaint handling
▶
▶Personnel management
▶
▶Repairs and alteration of merchandise
▶
▶Billing customers and credit operations
▶
▶Handling receipts and financial records
▶
▶Gift wrapping
▶
▶Delivery to customers (e.g., multichannel or omnichannel retailing)
▶
▶Returning unsold or damaged merchandise to vendors
▶
▶Sales forecasting and budgeting
▶
▶Coordination
Dividing Tasks among Channel Members and Customers
Although the preceding tasks are typically performed in a distribution channel, they do not all 
have to be done by a retailer. Some can be completed by the manufacturer, wholesaler, specialist, 
or consumer. Figure 11-3 shows the types of activities that could be carried out by each party. 
Following are some criteria to consider in allocating the functions related to consumer credit.
▶
▶A task should be done by the person who is most competent, and it should be carried out only 
if desired by the target market.
▶
▶For some retailers, liberal credit policies may provide significant advantages over competitors. 
For others, a cash-only policy may reduce their overhead and lead to lower prices.
▶
▶Credit collection may require a legal staff and detailed digitized records—most affordable by 
medium or large retailers. Smaller retailers are likely to rely on bank credit cards.

serving 425,000 restaurants, 
hotels, schools, and other

▶
▶There is a loss of control when an activity is delegated. A credit collection agency, pressing 
for past-due payments, may antagonize customers.
▶
▶The retailer’s institutional framework can affect task allocation. Franchisees are readily able 
to get together to have their own private-label brands. Independents cannot do this as easily.
▶
▶Task allocation depends on the savings gained by sharing or shifting tasks. The credit function 
is better performed by an outside credit bureau if it has expert personnel and ongoing access 
to financial data, uses tailored computer software, pays lower rent (due to an out-of-the-way 
site), and so on. Many retailers cannot attain these savings themselves.
Grouping Tasks into Jobs
After the retailer decides which tasks to perform, they are grouped into jobs. The jobs must be 
clearly structured. Here are examples of grouping tasks into jobs:
Tasks

Displaying merchandise, customer contact, gift wrapping, 
customer follow-up
Sales personnel

While grouping tasks into jobs, specialization should be considered so each employee is 
responsible for a limited range of functions (as opposed to performing many diverse tasks). Spe-
cialization has the advantages of clearly defined tasks, greater expertise, reduced training, and

hiring people with narrow education and experience. Problems can result due to extreme special-
ization: poor morale (boredom), people not being aware of their jobs’ importance, and the need 
for more employees. Specialization means assigning explicit duties to individuals so a job position 
encompasses a homogeneous cluster of tasks.
Once tasks are grouped, job descriptions are constructed. These outline the job titles, objec-
tives, duties, and responsibilities for every position. They are used as a hiring, supervision, and 
evaluation tool. Figure 11-4 contains a job description for a store manager.
Classifying Jobs
Jobs are then broadly grouped into functional, product, geographic, or combination classifications. 
Functional classification divides jobs by task—such as sales promotion, buying, Web design, and 
store operations. Expert knowledge is used. Product classification divides jobs on a goods or ser-
vice basis. A department store hires different personnel for clothing, furniture, appliances, and so 
forth. This classification recognizes differences in personnel requirements for different products.
Geographic classification is useful for chains operating in different areas. Employees are 
adapted to local conditions, and they are supervised by branch managers. Some firms, especially 
larger ones, use a combination classification. If a branch unit of a chain hires its selling staff, but 
buying personnel for each product line are hired by headquarters, the functional, product, and 
geographic formats are combined.
Developing an Organization Chart
The format of a retail organization must be designed in an integrated, coordinated way. Planning 
leaders in the organization need to clearly articulate accountability and decision-making author-
ity for each position or role on the organizational chart, span of control (number of subordinates

According to the UK Office of National Statistics, the number 
of UK workers on zero-hour contracts increased by 20 percent 
in 2016 to just over 900,000. This represents nearly 3 per-
cent of the employed UK workforce. The zero-hour contract 
­workers are not offered guaranteed hours or sick pay. Retail-
ers are amongst those most likely to offer their employees 
zero-hour contracts. On average, the retailer workers work 
for around 25 hours per week. However, over 30 percent of 
them would like to work longer and more predictable hours 
if they were given the option. The British Retail Consortium 
claims that zero-hours contracts are not widely used in the 
retail sector but that certain chains and brands only use this 
form of employment.
Why might a retailer opt for zero-hour contracts? What 
advantages does it offer them?

under a manager’s direct control) for each position, and lateral relationships between positions. 
Aligning individual employee goals with organizational goals and communicating to employees 
how the organizational structure will meet strategic objectives and goals and create sustained 
economic value is key. Managers and their direct reports must jointly identify common goals, 
define each individual’s responsibilities and expectations, and understand how they will be evalu-
ated. Joint goal setting and shared responsibility toward achieving them will increase employee 
motivation and perceived empowerment, and provide a common direction toward achievement 
of organizational goals.
The hierarchy of authority outlines the job interactions within a company by describing the 
reporting relationships among employees (from lowest level to highest level). Coordination and 
control are provided by this hierarchy. A firm with many workers reporting to one manager has 
a flat organization. Its benefits are good communication, quicker problem handling, and better 
employee identification with a job. The major problem tends to be the number of people reporting 
to one manager. A tall organization has several management levels, resulting in close supervision 
and fewer workers reporting to each manager. Problems include a long communication chan-
nel, the impersonal impression given to workers regarding access to upper-level personnel, and 
inflexible rules.
With these factors in mind, a retailer devises an organization chart, which graphically dis-
plays its hierarchical relationships. Table 11-1 lists the principles to consider in establishing an 
organization chart. Figure 11-5 shows examples of basic organization charts.
ORGANIZATIONAL PATTERNS IN RETAILING
An independent retailer has a simple organization. It operates only one store, the owner/manager 
usually supervises all employees, and workers have access to the owner/manager if there are prob-
lems. In contrast, a chain must specify how tasks are delegated, coordinate multiple stores, and 
set common policies for employees. As examples, the organizational arrangements used by inde-
pendent retailers, department stores, chain retailers, and diversified retailers are discussed next.
Organizational Arrangements Used by Small Independent Retailers
Small independents use uncomplicated arrangements with only two or three levels of personnel 
(owner/manager and employees), and the owner/manager personally runs the firm and oversees 
workers. There are few employees, little specialization, and no branch units. This does not mean 
fewer activities must be performed but that many tasks are performed relative to the number of 
workers. Each employee must allot part of his or her time to several duties.
Figure 11-6 shows the organizations of two small firms. In A, a boutique is organized by func-
tion. Merchandising personnel buy and sell goods and services, plan assortments, set up displays, 
TABLE 11-1  Principles for Organizing a Retail Firm
An organization should show interest in its employees. This can be done through job rotation, 
­promotion from within, participatory management, recognition, job enrichment, and so forth.
Employee turnover, lateness, and absenteeism should be monitored, because they may indicate 
­personnel problems.
The line of authority should be traceable from the highest to the lowest positions. In this way, 
­employees know to whom they report and who reports to them (chain of command).
A subordinate should report to only one direct supervisor (unity of command). This avoids  
the problem of workers receiving conflicting orders.
There is a limit to the number of employees a manager can directly supervise (span of control).
A person responsible for a given objective needs the power to achieve it.
Although a supervisor can delegate authority, he or she is still responsible for subordinates.
The greater the number of organizational levels, the longer the time for communication to travel  
and the greater the coordination problems.
An organization has an informal structure aside from a formal organization chart. Informal  
relationships exercise power in the firm and may bypass formal relationships and procedures.

and prepare ads. Operations personnel are involved with store maintenance and operations. In B, 
a furniture store is organized on a product-oriented basis, with personnel in each category respon-
sible for selected activities. All products get proper attention, and some expertise is developed. 
This is important because different skills are necessary to buy and sell each type of furniture.
Organizational Arrangements Used by Department Stores
Many department stores continue to use an organizational arrangement that is an adaptation of the 
Mazur plan, which divides all retail activities into four functional areas.2 In twenty-first century 
terms, these are store management, communications, merchandising, and financial accounting. 
Figure 11-7 shows the modern version of the Mazur plan, as devised by the authors of this book:
1.	 Store management: Operations, customer service, human resources, inventory, “backroom” 
activities, and store maintenance
2.	 Communications: Public relations, advertising, window and interior displays, promotions, 
and online efforts

PART 5  •  MANAGING A RETAIL BUSINESS
general manager and is a staff person; and a controller and a communications manager often staff 
services for merchandisers; but in their disciplines, personnel are organized on a line basis.
The merchandising division is responsible for buying and selling. It is headed by a 
­merchandising manager, who is often viewed as the most important of the area executives. She or 
he supervises buyers, devises financial goals for each department, coordinates merchandise plans 
(so there is a consistent image among departments), and interprets the effects of economic data. 
In some cases, divisional merchandise managers are utilized, so the number of buyers reporting 
to a single manager does not become unwieldy.
In the basic Mazur plan, the buyer has complete accountability for expenses and profit goals 
within a department. Duties include preparing preliminary budgets, studying trends, negotiat-
ing with vendors over price, planning the number of salespeople, and informing sales personnel 
about the merchandise purchased. Grouping buying and selling activities into one job (buyer) may 
present a problem. Because buyers are not constantly on the selling floor, training, scheduling, 
and supervising personnel may suffer.
Branch store growth has led to three Mazur plan derivatives: main store control, by which 
headquarters executives oversee and operate branches; separate store organization, by which each 
branch has buying responsibilities; and equal store organization, by which buying is centralized 
and branches become sales units with equal operational status. The latter is the most popular format.
In the main store control format, most authority remains at headquarters. Merchandise planning 
and buying, advertising, financial controls, store hours, and other tasks are centrally managed to 
standardize the performance. Branch store managers hire and supervise employees, but daily opera-
tions conform to company policies. This works well if there are few branches and the preferences of 
customers are similar to those at the main store. As branch stores increase, buyers, the advertising 
manager, and others may be overworked and give little attention to branches. Because headquarters 
personnel are not at the branches, differences in customer preferences may be overlooked.
The separate store format places merchandise managers in branches, which have autonomy 
for merchandising and operations. Customer needs are quickly noted, but task duplication is pos-
sible. Coordination can also be a problem. Transferring goods between branches is more complex 
and costly. This format is best if stores are large, branches are dispersed, and/or local customer 
tastes vary widely.
In the equal store format, the benefits of both centralization and decentralization are sought. 
Buying—forecasting, planning, purchasing, pricing, distribution to branches, and promotion—is 
centralized. Selling—presenting merchandise, selling, customer services, and operations—is man-
aged locally. All stores, including headquarters, are treated alike. Buyers are freed from managing 
so many workers. Data gathering is critical since buyers have less customer contact.
Organizational Arrangements Used by Chain Retailers
Various chain retailers use a version of the equal store organization, as depicted in Figure 11-8. 
Although chains’ organizations may differ, they generally have these attributes:
▶
▶There are many functional divisions, such as merchandise management, distribution, 
omnichannel, operations, real-estate, personnel, information systems, and sales promotion.
▶
▶Overall authority is centralized. Store managers have selling responsibility.
▶
▶Many operations are standardized (fixtures, store layout, building design, merchandise lines, 
credit policy, and store service).
▶
▶An elaborate control system keeps management informed.
▶
▶Some decentralization lets branches adapt to locales and increases store manager responsibili-
ties. Although large chains standardize most items their outlets carry, store managers often 
fine-tune the rest of the strategy mix for the local market. This empowers the store manager.
Organizational Arrangements Used by Diversified Retailers
A diversified retailer is a multi-line firm operating under central ownership. Like other chains, 
a diversified retailer operates multiple stores; unlike typical chains, a diversified firm is involved 
with different types of retail operations. Here are two examples:
▶
▶Kroger Co. (www.kroger.com) operates supermarkets, warehouse stores, supercenters, con-
venience stores, and jewelry stores; it also has a manufacturing group. The firm owns multiple 
store chains in each of its retail categories. See Figure 11-9.

▶
▶Japan’s Aeon Co. (www.aeon.info/en) comprises superstores, supermarkets, discount stores, 
home centers, specialty stores, convenience stores, financial services stores, restaurants, and 
more. Besides Japan, Aeon has facilities in numerous other countries. It is also a shopping 
center developer.
Due to multiple strategy mixes, diversified retailers face complex organizational consider-
ations. Interdivision control is needed, with operating procedures and goals clearly communicated. 
For example, (1) interdivision competition must be coordinated, (2) resources must be divided 
among divisions, (3) potential image and advertising conflicts must be avoided, and (4) manage-
ment skills must adapt to different operations.
HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN RETAILING
Human resource management involves recruiting, selecting, training, compensating, and super-
vising personnel in a manner consistent with the retailer’s organization structure and strategy mix. 
Personnel practices depend on the line of business, number of employees, store location, and other 
factors. Because good personnel are needed to develop and carry out strategies, and labor costs 
can amount to 50 percent or more of expenses, the value of human resource management is clear.
Retailing in the United States employs 25 million people. Thus, there is a constant need to 
attract new employees—and retain existing ones. For example, as many as 2 million fast-food 
workers are aged 16 to 20, and they stay in their jobs for short periods. In general, retailers need 
to reduce the turnover rate; when workers quickly exit a firm, the results can be disastrous. See 
Table 11-2. Turnover in retail averages around 66 percent for part-time hourly, whereas it drops 
to 27 percent for full-time employees with benefits such as health insurance.3
Consider the approaches of Target, Zappos, and Wegmans Food Markets:

▶Target is committed to employee development and retention. Target challenges employees 
to innovate, collaborate, and efficiently and intelligently provide the best possible shopping

Employees get benefits such as vacation and sick days, a retirement plan, life and disability 
insurance, medical and dental coverage, maternity and paternity leave, tuition reimbursement, 
discounts (40%) on Zappos merchandise, and free shipping. Zappos helps employees stay fit 
by having an on-site fitness center, a yoga studio, weight management programs, and fitness 
challenges. To help employees achieve a work–life balance, Zappos pays for dry cleaning, 
car washes, and oil changes; it even has an on-site library and life coach, health screening, 
and a nap room! Company happy hours, fun events, and healthy on-site catering build team 
and family spirit.5

▶Wegmans Food Markets is the only retailer on the Forbes “100 Best Companies to Work

sharing and compressed work weeks, tuition reimbursement, paid vacations, and substantial

via lateral learning, cross-training, internships, and management training. Wegmans cares 
about the well-being of employees and empowers them to make decisions that customers

The Special Human Resource Environment of Retailing
Retailers face a human resource environment characterized by a large number of inexperienced 
workers, long hours, highly visible employees, a diverse work force, many part-time workers, 
and  variable customer demands. These factors complicate employee hiring, staffing, and 
supervision.
The need for a large retail labor force often means hiring those with little or no prior experi-
ence. Sometimes, a position in retailing represents a person’s first “real job.” People are attracted 
to retailing because they find jobs near to home, and retail positions (such as cashiers, stock clerks, 
and some types of sales personnel) may require limited education, training, and skill. Also, the low 
wages paid for some positions result in the hiring of inexperienced people. Thus, high employee 
turnover and cases of poor performance, lateness, and absenteeism may result.
The long working hours in retailing, which may include weekends, turn off certain prospec-
tive employees. Many retailers now have longer hours because more shoppers want to shop 
­during evenings and weekends. Accordingly, some retailers require at least two shifts of full-time 
employees.
Retailing employees are highly visible to the customer. Thus, when personnel are selected 
and trained, special care must be taken as to their manners and appearance. Some small retailers 
do not place enough emphasis on employee appearance (neat grooming and appropriate attire).
The Bureau of Labor 
Statistics compiles current 
employment data on such 
jobs as retail sales worker 
supervisors and managers 
(www.bls.gov/oco).
RWR Group (www.johnmcaldwell.com/rwr-group), HGA (http://
hga-group.com), and Carter Murray (www.cartermurray.com) 
specialize in the global recruitment of retail executives. Why? 
Demand factors include the need for multinational executives 
to effectively manage global retail operations. The supply stems 
from retail executives seeking foreign experience to better pre-
pare for high-level positions, as well as individuals wanting the 
excitement of living in a foreign country. Some executive search 
firms such as HGA Group specialize in a field of retailing; others 
such as RWR Group are involved in executive placement in a wide 
variety of retail fields. All of these companies have offices in major 
cities throughout the world. Carter Murray, as an example, has 
offices in London, Singapore, Hong Kong, New York, Germany, 
and Australia.

employee of using a global executive recruitment firm.

PART 5  •  MANAGING A RETAIL BUSINESS
It is common for retailers to have a diverse labor force, with regard to age, work experience, 
gender, race, and other factors. This means that firms must train and supervise their workers so 
they interact well with one another—and are sensitive to the perspectives and needs of each other. 
Home Depot’s recruitment strategy includes partnerships with several national nonprofit, govern-
ment, and educational organizations to reach out to the communities it serves and to attract a broad 
range of qualified candidates with diverse backgrounds, including AARP, NAACP, National Urban 
League, National Society of Hispanic MBAs, National Black MBA Association Inc., and several 
U.S. military groups. In addition, Home Depot provides resources to help recruits succeed through 
Associate Resource groups and online tools such as “Military Skills Translator” to help veterans 
identify positions and job descriptions that leverage skills acquired in the military.8
Due to long operating hours, retailers regularly hire part-time workers. In many supermarkets, 
more than half the workers are part-time, and problems may arise. Some part-time employees 
are more lackadaisical, late, absent, or likely to quit than full-time employees. They must be 
closely monitored. Like other firms, retailers hire a large number of Millennials. Although this 
group is generally technologically advanced, Millennials often have ­different work values than 
older employees. A recent Gallup Poll found that Millennials are the least engaged group in the 
work force.9 Here are a number of ways to better motivate Millennials:10
▶
▶Show the firm’s commitment to society and respected charities by supporting volunteerism.
▶
▶Train managers to communicate frequently and openly with Millennials.
▶
▶Get Millennials actively involved in solving important problems.
▶
▶Provide Millennials with mentors.

▶Accommodate Millennials’ needs with flexible hours.
Variations in customer demand by day, time period, or season may cause difficulties. A number 
of U.S. shoppers make major supermarket trips on Saturday or Sunday. So, how many ­employees 
should there be Monday through Friday and how many on Saturday and Sunday? Differences by 
time of day (morning, afternoon, evening), season, and holidays also affect planning. When stores 
are very busy, even administrative and clerical employees may be needed on the sales floor.
As a rule, retailers should consider these points:
▶
▶Recruitment and selection procedures must efficiently generate sufficient applicants.
▶
▶Some training must be short because workers are inexperienced and temporary.
▶
▶Compensation must be perceived as “fair” by employees.
▶
▶Advancement opportunities must be available to employees who view retailing as a career.
▶
▶Employee appearance and work habits must be explained and reviewed.
▶
▶Diverse workers must be taught to work together well and amicably.
▶
▶Morale problems may result from high turnover and the many part-time workers.
▶
▶Full- and part-time workers may conflict, especially if some full-timers are replaced.
Various retail career opportunities are available to women and minorities. There is still some 
room for improvement, however.
WOMEN IN RETAILING  Retailers have made a lot of progress in career advancement for women. 
According to the “2020 Women on Boards,” Ann Inc., Avon, Chico’s, Children’s Place, Estee 
Lauder, HSN (Home Shopping Network), Macy’s, Ulta, and Williams-Sonoma Inc. are among 
the U.S. public firms with 40 percent or more of corporate officers who are women.11 The “2013 
Catalyst Census: Fortune 500 Women’s Representation by NAICS Industry” report notes that 
retailing has the highest percentage of women as corporate officers among the 18 industry groups.
Women have more career options in retailing than ever before, as the following examples 
show. Mary Kay Ash (Mary Kay cosmetics), Debbi Fields (Mrs. Fields’ Cookies), and Lillian 
Vernon (the direct marketer) have founded retailing empires. As of 2016, women were chief 
executive officers in 21 of Fortune 500 companies overall and/or chairpersons of the board of 
such U.S.-based retailers as Enterprise, Home Shopping Network, Ross Stores, Sam’s Club, and 
Victoria’s Secret.12 Let’s look at a brief profile of two of these.
Rosalind Brewer is president and CEO of Sam’s Club. She started her career with Walmart 
in 2006 as regional vice-president of operations. She then was promoted to division president of 
Walmart Southeast, and then president of Walmart East. In 2012, Brewer was named president 
and CEO of Sam’s Club. She earned her bachelor’s degree in chemistry from Spelman College. 
In 2015, Forbes referred to Rosalind Brewer as one of the “World’s 100 Most Powerful Women.”13
See how Avon offers 
“inspiring work” and is 
“empowering women”

As part of her legacy, 
Mary Kay Ash left behind 
a charitable foundation 
(www.mkacf.org).

At Enterprise Holdings Inc., the parent company of Enterprise, Alamo, and National car-
rental service providers with more than $19 billion in annual revenues, Pamela Nicholson has 
been president and CEO since 2013. She is the highest-ranking woman among the world’s largest 
travel companies and has been named to Fortune’s list of “America’s 50 Most Powerful Women 
in Business” every year since 2007. Nicholson graduated from the University of Missouri with a 
bachelor of arts degree and began her career with Enterprise Rent-A-Car in 1981 as a management 
trainee. She has grown the U.S. and international businesses and has been working on a deal with 
Nissan for a car-sharing businesses for students at 90 college campuses.14
Despite recent progress, women still account for a small percentage of corporate officers at 
publicly owned retailers. These initiatives can help to increase the number of female executives:
▶
▶Meaningful training programs
▶
▶Advancement opportunities
▶
▶Telecommuting and flex time—the ability of employees to adapt their work hours
▶
▶Job sharing among two or more employees who each work less than full-time
▶
▶Onsite child care
MINORITIES AND DIVERSITY IN RETAILING  Fortune’s 2016 “100 Best Companies to Work For” 
study listed the top companies’ minority statistics. Among retailers with a high percent of minori-
ties are Ikea (52 percent minorities), Nordstrom (50 percent), Whole Foods (43 percent), CarMax 
(41 percent), Nugget Market (40 percent), Build-A-Bear (35 percent), Container Store (30 ­percent), 
Wegmans Food Markets (21 percent), and REI (17 percent).15
As with women, retailers have done many good things in the area of minority employment, 
but there is still more to be accomplished. Consider these positive examples:
▶
▶CarMax strongly believes in having a diverse work force—and not just because it wants to 
be a good corporate citizen. CarMax knows that employee diversity contributes to its already 
strong competitive advantages. Through such diversity, CarMax has a broader view of the 
marketplace and attracts a greater range of customers. It continuously strives to treat every job 
applicant, employee, customer, and supplier with respect and fairness—regardless of gender, 
race, sexual orientation, age, and various other factors.16
▶
▶Walmart is committed to embracing diversity on all aspects of its organization; from its 
associates to its supplier partners. Through its Supplier Diversity Program,17 Walmart works 
with over 3,000 suppliers owned and operated by minorities, women, veterans, and disabled 
people. In fiscal 2016, Walmart purchased $14.7 billion from women and minority-owned 
businesses.
▶
▶Walgreens shows its commitment to diversity as part of a multipronged effort. It includes 
dealing with a minimum of 8 percent certified minority business firms and 2 percent other 
certified diversified businesses; and it encourages prime suppliers to use diverse suppliers.18
The following list suggests some ways for retailers to even better address the needs of 
­minority workers:
▶
▶Have clear policy statements from top management as to the value of employee diversity.
▶
▶Engage in active recruitment programs to stimulate minority applications.
▶
▶Offer meaningful training programs.
▶
▶Provide advancement opportunities.
▶
▶Have zero tolerance for insensitive workplace behavior.
The Human Resource Management Process in Retailing
The human resource management process consists of these interrelated personnel activities: 
recruitment, selection, training, compensation, and supervision. The goals are to obtain, develop, and 
retain employees. When applying the process, diversity, labor laws, and privacy should be reflected.
Diversity involves two premises: (1) employees must be hired and promoted in a fair and open 
way, without regard to gender, ethnic background, and other related factors; and (2) in a diverse 
society, the workplace should be representative of such diversity.
There are several aspects of labor laws for retailers to satisfy:
▶
▶Do not hire underage workers.
▶
▶Do not pay workers “off the books” (“under the table”).
Fortune annually lists the 
best employers among 
public firms (http://fortune 
.com/best-companies).
McDonald’s (www 
.aboutmcdonalds.com/mcd/
corporate_careers) actively 
encourages diversity and 
understanding.

PART 5  •  MANAGING A RETAIL BUSINESS
▶
▶Do not require workers to engage in illegal acts (such as bait-and-switch selling).
▶
▶Do not discriminate in hiring or promoting workers.
▶
▶Do not violate worker safety regulations.
▶
▶Do not disobey the Americans with Disabilities Act.
▶
▶Do not deal with suppliers that disobey labor laws.
Retailers must also be careful not to violate employees’ privacy rights. Only necessary data about 
workers should be gathered and stored, and such information should not be freely disseminated.
We now discuss each human resource management activity for sales and middle-management 
jobs. For further insights, go to our blog (www.bermanevansretail.com).
RECRUITING RETAIL PERSONNEL  Recruitment is the activity whereby a retailer generates a list 
of job applicants. Table 11-3 indicates the features of several key recruitment sources. In addition 
to these sources, the Web now plays a bigger role in recruitment. Many retailers have a career or 
job section at their Web site, and some sections are as elaborate as the overall sites. Visit Target’s 
Web site (www.target.com), for example. Scroll down to the bottom of the home page and click 
on “more” and then “careers.”
With entry-level sales jobs, retailers rely on educational institutions, ads, walk-ins (or write-
ins), Web sites (including social media), and employee referrals. With middle-management posi-
tions, retailers rely on employment agencies, competitors, ads, and employee referrals. A retailer’s 
usual goal is to generate a list of potential employees, which is reduced during selection. Firms 
that accept applications only from those meeting minimum standards save a lot of time and money.
SELECTING RETAIL PERSONNEL  The company next selects new employees by matching the traits 
of potential employees with specific job requirements. Job analysis and description, the applica-
tion blank, interviewing, testing (optional), references, and a physical exam (optional) are tools 
in the process; they should be integrated.
In job analysis, information is amassed on each job’s functions and requirements: duties, 
responsibilities, aptitude, interest, education, experience, and physical tasks. It is used to select

personnel, set performance standards, and assign salaries. Thus, department managers often act 
as the main sales associates for their areas, oversee other sales associates, have some administra-
tive duties, report to the store manager, are eligible for bonuses, and receive $25,000 to $45,000+ 
annually.
Job analysis should lead to written job descriptions. A traditional job description ­contains a 
position’s title, relationships (superior and subordinate), and specific roles and tasks. Figure 11-4  
showed a store manager description. Yet, using a traditional description alone has been criticized. 
It may limit a job’s scope, as well as its authority and responsibility; not let a person grow; limit 
activities to those listed; and not describe how jobs are coordinated. To complement a traditional 
description, a goal-oriented job description enumerates basic functions, the relationship of each 
job to overall goals, the interdependence of positions, and information flows. See Figure 11-10.

Attributes Required
ANALYTICAL SKILLS: ability to solve 
problems; strong numerical ability for 
analysis of facts and data for planning, 
managing, and controlling.
CREATIVITY: ability to generate and 
recognize imaginative ideas and solutions; 
ability to recognize the need for and be 
responsive to change.
DECISIVENESS: ability to make quick 
decisions and render judgments, take 
action, and commit oneself to completion.
INITIATIVE: ability to originate action 
rather than wait to be told what to do 
and ability to act based on conviction.
LEADERSHIP: ability to inspire others to 
trust and respect your judgment; ability to 
delegate and to guide and persuade 
others.
ORGANIZATION: ability to establish 
priorities and courses of action for self 
and/or others; skill in planning and 
following up to achieve results.
RISK TAKING: willingness to take 
calculated risks based on thorough 
analysis and sound judgment and to accept 
responsibility for the results.
STRESS TOLERANCE: ability to perform 
consistently under pressure, to thrive on 
constant change and challenge.
Retail executives are resilient. As the 
above description should suggest, retailing 
is fast-paced and demanding.
Retail executives are doers. Sales volumes, 
trends, and buying opportunities mean 
continual action. Opportunities for action 
must be seized.
Retail executives are problem solvers. 
Knowledge and understanding of past 
performance and present circumstances 
form the basis for action and planning.
Retail executives are managers. Running a 
business means depending on others to 
get the work done. One person cannot 
do it all.
FLEXIBILITY: ability to adjust to the 
ever-changing needs of the situation; 
ability to adapt to diﬀerent people, places, 
and things; willingness to do whatever is 
necessary to get the task done.
Retail executives are courageous. Success 
in retailing often comes from taking 
calculated risks and having the conﬁdence 
to try something new before someone 
else does.
Retail executives are action people. 
Whether it’s new fashion trends or 
customer desires, decisions must be made 
quickly and conﬁdently in this 
ever-changing environment.
Retail executives are idea people. Successful 
buying results from sensitive, aware decisions, 
while merchandising requires imaginative, 
innovative techniques. 
Retail executives are ﬂexible. Surprises in 
retailing never cease. Plans must be altered 
quickly to accommodate changes in trends, 
styles, and attitudes, while numerous 
ongoing activities cannot be ignored.
Retail executives are jugglers. A variety of 
issues, functions, and projects are constantly 
in motion. To reach your goals, priorities 
must be set and work must be delegated to 
others.

PART 5  •  MANAGING A RETAIL BUSINESS
An application blank is usually the first tool used to screen applicants; it provides data 
on education, experience, health, reasons for leaving prior jobs, outside activities, hobbies, and 
­references. It is usually short, requires little interpretation, and can be used as the basis for prob-
ing in an interview. With a weighted application blank, factors having a high relationship with 
job success are given more weight than others. Retailers using such a form analyze current and 
past employee performance and determine the criteria (education, experience, etc.) best correlated 
with job success (as measured by longer tenure, better performance, etc.). After weighted scores 
are awarded to all job applicants (based on data they provide), a minimum total score becomes 
a cutoff point for hiring. An effective application blank aids retailers in lessening turnover and 
selecting high achievers.
An application blank should be used along with a job description. Those meeting minimum 
job requirements are processed further; others are immediately rejected. In this way, the applica-
tion blank provides a quick and inexpensive method of screening.
The interview seeks information that can be amassed only by personal questioning and obser-
vation. It lets an employer determine a candidate’s verbal ability, note his or her appearance, ask 
questions keyed to the application, and probe career goals. Interviewing decisions must be made 
about the level of formality, the number and length of interviews, the location, the person(s) to do 
the interviewing, and the interview structure. These decisions often depend on the interviewer’s 
ability and the job’s requirements.
Small firms tend to hire applicants based on their performance during interviews. Large firms 
may have multiple stages: candidates who excel at the interview stage may then be required to 
take psychological tests (to measure personality, intelligence, interest, and leadership), and/or 
achievement tests (to measure learned knowledge).19
Tests must be administered by qualified people. Standardized exams should not be used unless 
proven effective in predicting job performance. Achievement tests deal with specific skills or 
information (such as the ability to make a sales presentation), are easier to interpret than psycho-
logical tests, and show direct relationships between knowledge and ability. In administering tests, 
firms must not violate federal, state, and local laws. The federal Employee Polygraph Protection 
Act bars firms from using lie detector tests in most hiring situations (drugstores are exempt).
To save time and operate more efficiently, some retailers—large and small—use computer-
ized application blanks and testing. Advance Auto Parts, Babies “R” Us, Best Buy, CVS, Family 
Tree, Lowe’s, and PetSmart are among those with in-store kiosks that allow people to apply for 
jobs, complete applications, and answer questions. This speeds the process and attracts applicants.
Many retailers get references from applicants that can be checked either before or after an 
interview. References are contacted to see how enthusiastically they recommend an applicant, 
check the applicant’s honesty, and ask why an applicant left a prior job. Mail and phone checks 
are inexpensive, fast, and easy.
Some firms require a physical exam because of the physical activity, long hours, and tensions 
involved in many retailing positions. A clean bill of health means the candidate is offered a job. 
Again, federal, state, and local laws must be followed.
Each step in the selection process complements the others; together they give the retailer a 
good information package for choosing personnel. As a rule, retailers should use job descriptions, 
CVS (https://jobs.cvshealth 
.com) encourages potential 
employees to apply online.
A number job-listing sites exist, such as www.workinretail 
.com, http://retail.jobs.careercast.com, www.findtherightjob.com,  
www.job-application.com, and www.snagajob.com. Although 
each site has unique features, together they generally offer 
job descriptions, locations, and more. Job seekers can print 
out this information; view available positions at multiple retail-
ers; and look up minimum age requirements, hours of opera-
tion, and compensation. Some sites provide E-mail alerts about 
available positions in their geographic areas. Others let job seek-
ers ­selectively look for jobs in specific fields. Still others allow job 
applicants to post their résumés. For retailers, these sites also 
have advantages, including access to a larger applicant pool, the 
ability to compile and screen applicants on a database, and ­better 
matching candidate qualifications with a retailer needs.

application blanks, interviews, and reference checks. Follow-up interviews, psychological and 
achievement tests, and physical exams depend on the retailer and the position. Inexpensive tools 
(such as application blanks) are used in the early screening stages; more costly, in-depth tools 
(such as interviews) are used after reducing the applicant pool. Equal opportunity, nondiscrimina-
tory practices must be followed.
TRAINING RETAIL PERSONNEL  Every new employee should receive pre-training, an indoctrina-
tion on the firm’s history, culture, and policies, job orientation on hours, compensation, the chain 
of command, and job duties. The term onboarding describes the process of integrating new 
­employees into an organization and its culture, and understanding the expectations of their new job. 
New employees should be introduced to co-workers; encouraged to build relationships with a 
diverse network of colleagues; and provided with tools, resources, and knowledge to become 
­successful and productive. A well-designed onboarding process may evolve over an entire year—
from new employee orientation to continuous improvement. It should be modified for specific job 
roles and locations and make the employee feel welcome.20
Training programs teach new (and existing) personnel how best to perform their jobs or how 
to improve themselves. Training can range from 1-day sessions on operating a computerized cash 
register, personal selling techniques, or compliance with affirmative action programs to 2-year 
programs for executive trainees on all aspects of the retailer and its operations:
▶
▶For each new employee, Container Store provides extensive formal training, which includes 
understanding its “Employee First Culture,” systems training, and classes on how to perform 
multiple jobs. Each first-year, full-time employee receives about 260 hours of training. The 
New Store Trainer program has three phases: pre-training (3 weeks prior to opening), post-
support (week of and after grand opening), and post-training (a few weeks after post-support). 
The training ensures that employees are knowledgeable and empowered to offer the customer 
service the retailer is known for in the industry.21
▶
▶Best Buy uses an online “Learning Lounge” (www.bestbuylearninglounge.com) to facilitate 
employee training for new and continuing workers, to keep employees current on the firm’s 
best practices, and to let employees easily communicate with one another. The password-
protected portal is under the auspices of Best Buy’s Retail Training & Development group, 
whose slogan is “grow. perform. succeed.”
Training should be an ongoing activity. New equipment, legal changes, new product lines, 
job promotions, low employee morale, and employee turnover necessitate not only training but 
also retraining. Macy’s has a program called “Clienteling,” which tutors sales associates on how 
to have better long-term relations with specific repeat customers. Core vendors of Macy’s teach 
sales associates about the features and benefits of new merchandise when it is introduced.22
There are several training decisions, as shown in Figure 11-11. They can be divided into three 
categories: identifying needs, devising appropriate training methods, and evaluation.
FIGURE 11-11
A Checklist of 
Selected Training 
Decisions

outside specialist?)

What material (content) should be learned? How should it be taught?
Should audiovisuals be used? If yes, how?
Should elements of the training program be computerized? If yes, how?
How should the eﬀectiveness of training be measured?

310	
PART 5  •  MANAGING A RETAIL BUSINESS
Short-term training needs can be identified by measuring the gap between the skills that 
workers already have and the skills desired by the firm (for each job). This training should prepare 
employees for possible job rotation, promotions, and changes in the company. A longer training 
plan lets a firm identify future needs and train workers appropriately.
There are many training methods for retailers: lectures, demonstrations, videos, programmed 
instruction, conferences, sensitivity training, case studies, role-playing, behavior modeling, and 
competency-based instruction. Some techniques may be computerized, as evidenced by more 
and more firms.. The attributes of the various training methods are noted in Table 11-4. Retailers 
often use more than one technique to reduce employee boredom and to cover the material better.
Computer-based training software is available from a variety of vendors. For example, TiER1 
Performance Solutions has numerous modules that have been used to train retail employees in 
such areas as point-of-sales systems, labor scheduling, customer service, manager training, store 
operations, merchandise management, and more. Among its many clients are CDW, Kroger, 
Macy’s, McDonald’s, Petco, and Wendy’s.
For training to succeed, a conducive environment is needed, based on several principles:
▶
▶All people can learn if taught well; there should be a sense of achievement.
▶
▶A person learns better when motivated; intelligence alone is not sufficient.
▶
▶Learning should be goal-oriented.
▶
▶A trainee learns more when he or she participates and is not a passive listener.
▶
▶The teacher must provide guidance, as well as adapt to the learner and to the situation.
▶
▶Learning should be approached as a series of steps rather than a one-time occurrence.
▶
▶Learning should be spread out over a reasonable period of time rather than be compressed.
▶
▶The learner should be encouraged to do homework or otherwise practice.
▶
▶Different methods of learning should be combined.
▶
▶Performance standards should be set and good performance recognized.
A training program must be regularly evaluated. Comparisons can be made between the 
performance of those who receive training and those who do not, as well as among employees 
receiving different types of training for the same job. Evaluations should always be made in rela-
tion to stated training goals. In addition, training effects should be measured over different time 
intervals (such as immediately, 30 days later, and 6 months later), and proper records maintained.
COMPENSATING RETAIL PERSONNEL  Total compensation—direct monetary payments (salaries, 
commissions, and bonuses) and indirect payments (paid vacations, health and life insurance, and 
retirement plans)—should be fair to both the retailer and its employees. To better ­motivate ­employees, 
some firms also have a profit-sharing plan. Smaller retailers often pay salaries, commissions,

and/or bonuses and have fewer fringe benefits. Bigger ones generally pay salaries, commissions, and/ 
or bonuses and offer more fringe benefits.
Although the hourly federal minimum wage has been $7.25 since July 2009, 45 states have 
their own laws—29 are higher than the federal minimum and two are lower. In 2016, the highest 
minimum wage was in Washington, D.C. ($11.50), and in these states: California and Massachu-
setts ($10.00); Alaska, ($9.75); and Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Vermont ($9.60). Some states 
and cities are phasing in a minimum wage as high as $15.00 per hour. The minimum wage has the 
most impact on retailers hiring entry-level, part-time workers. Full-time, career-track retailing jobs 
are typically paid an attractive market rate; to attract part-time workers in good economic times, 
retailers must often pay salaries above the minimum.
At some firms, compensation for certain positions is set through collective bargaining. 
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 825,000 retail employees are represented by 
labor unions. Yet, union membership varies greatly. Unionized grocery stores account for more 
than one-half of total U.S. supermarket sales, whereas independent supermarkets are not usually 
unionized.
With a straight salary, a worker is paid a fixed amount per hour, week, month, or year. Advan-
tages are retailer control, employee security, and known expenses. Disadvantages are retailer 
inflexibility, the limited productivity incentive, and fixed costs. Clerks and cashiers are usu-
ally paid salaries. With a straight commission, earnings are directly tied to productivity (such as 
sales volume). Advantages are retailer flexibility, the link to worker productivity, no fixed costs, 
and employee incentive. Disadvantages are the retailer’s potential lack of control over the tasks 
­performed, the risk of low earnings to employees, cost variability, and the lack of limits on worker 
earnings. Sales personnel for autos, real-estate, furniture, jewelry, and other expensive items are 
often paid a straight commission—as are direct-selling personnel.
To combine the attributes of salary and commission plans, retailers may pay employees a 
salary plus commission. Shoe salespeople, major appliance salespeople, and some management 
personnel are among those paid this way. Sometimes, bonuses supplement salary and/or commis-
sion, usually for outstanding performance. At Finish Line footwear and apparel stores, regional, 
district, and store managers receive salaries and earn bonuses based on sales, payroll size, and 
theft goals. In certain cases, executives are paid via a “compensation cafeteria” and choose their 
own combination of salary, bonus, fringe benefits, life insurance, stock, and retirement benefits.
A thorny issue facing retailers today involves the benefits portion of employee compensa-
tion, especially as related to pensions and health care. It is a challenging time due to intense price 
competition, the use of part-time workers, and escalating medical costs as retailers try to balance 
their employees’ needs with company financial needs.
SUPERVISING RETAIL PERSONNEL  Supervision is the manner of providing a job environment that 
encourages employee accomplishment. The goals are to oversee personnel, attain good perfor-
mance, maintain morale, motivate people, control costs, communicate, and resolve problems. 
Supervision is provided by personal contact, meetings, and reports.
Every firm wants to continually motivate employees so as to harness their energy on behalf 
of the retailer and achieve its goals. Job motivation is the drive within people to attain work-
related goals. It may be positive or negative. These questions can be used to help predict employee 
behavior, based on their motivation:
▶
▶Do you like the work you do? Does it give you a sense of accomplishment?
▶
▶Are you proud to say you work with us?
▶
▶Does the work expected from you influence your overall job attitude? How?
▶
▶Do physical working conditions influence your overall job attitude? How?
▶
▶Does the way you are treated by your boss affect your job attitude?
▶
▶Do you understand the firm’s strategy?
▶
▶Do you see a connection between your work and the firm’s strategic goals?23
Employee motivation should be approached from two perspectives: What job-related factors 
cause employees to be satisfied or dissatisfied with their positions? What supervision style is best 
for both the retailer and its employees? See Figure 11-12.
Each employee looks at job satisfaction in terms of minimum expectations (“dissatisfi-
ers”) and desired goals (“satisfiers”). A motivated employee requires fulfillment of both factors.

whd/minwage/america.htm)

in every state.

Minimum expectations relate mostly to the job environment, including a safe workplace; equi-
table treatment for those with the same jobs; some flexibility in company policies (such as not 
docking pay if a person is 10 minutes late); an even-tempered boss; some freedom in attire; a 
fair compensation package; basic fringe benefits (such as vacation time and medical coverage); 
clear communications; and job security. These elements can generally influence motivation in 
only one way—negatively. If minimum expectations are not met, an employee will be unhappy. 
If these expectations are met, they are taken for granted and do little to motivate the person to go 
“above and beyond.”
Desired goals relate more to the job than to the work environment. They are based on whether 
an employee likes the job, is recognized for good performance, feels a sense of achievement, is 
empowered to make decisions, is trusted, has a defined career path, receives extra compensation 
when performance is exceptional, and is given the chance to learn and grow. These elements can 
have a huge impact on job satisfaction and motivate a person to go “above and beyond.” Nonethe-
less, if minimum expectations are not met, an employee might still be dissatisfied enough to leave, 
even if the job is quite rewarding.
There are three basic styles of supervising retail employees:
▶
▶Management assumes that employees must be closely supervised and controlled and that only 
economic inducements really motivate. Management further believes that the average worker 
Retail buying is often viewed as an exciting job, especially when 
the goods bought for resale correspond to an employee’s area 
of interest. For example, many fashion-oriented students are 
attracted to an apparel buying position and avid computer users 
may seek buying positions in electronics. Buyer training gen-
erally focuses on technical aspects of buying (such as how to 
evaluate the quality of hand-made carpets for a carpet buyer), 
negotiating skills (setting discounts, markdowns, and credit 
terms), and understanding open-to-buy calculations (that recon-
cile inventory and demand). Some retailers have formal training 
programs, others offer on-the-job training where junior buyers 
receive additional responsibilities over time.
What do you think are the attributes of a good retail buying 
program?

Today, many older adults 
work in retailing—
to supplement their 
retirement benefits, to 
be active, and/or to be 
in a social setting. It 
is important that these

respect and not be placed 
into menial, boring jobs 
that do not make use of 
their skill set. If they are 
unhappy, it may rub off on

lacks ambition, dislikes responsibility, and prefers to be led. This is the traditional view of 
motivation and has been applied to lower-level retail positions.
▶
▶Management assumes employees can be self-managers and assigned authority, motivation is 
social and psychological, and supervision can be decentralized and participatory. Manage-
ment also thinks that motivation, the capacity for assuming responsibility, and a readiness to 
achieve company goals exist in people. The critical supervisory task is to create an environ-
ment so people achieve their goals by attaining company objectives. This is a more modern 
view and applies to all levels of personnel.
▶
▶Management applies a self-management approach and also advocates more employee involve-
ment in defining jobs and sharing overall decision making. There is mutual loyalty between 
the firm and its workers, and both parties enthusiastically cooperate for the long-term benefit 
of each. This is also a modern view and applies to all levels of personnel.
It is imperative to motivate employees in a manner that yields job satisfaction, low turn-
over, low absenteeism, and high productivity. Research in organizational behavior on employee 
motivation suggests that trade-offs among command, autonomy, respect for employees’ need 
for self-determination and economic incentives can improve employee intrinsic motivation and 
performance. Some suggestions include: (1) Empower employees to solve problems. (2) Ask 
employees for their input. (3) Regularly communicate with employees about how they are doing. 
(4) Delegate tasks. (5) Encourage new ideas from employees. (6) Let employees learn from their 
mistakes without being unduly harsh. (7) Show employees what is needed for promotions. (8) 
Provide public recognition of good performance. (9) Seek employee input on company goals and 
how to achieve them.24
Chapter Summary
1.	 To study the procedures involved in setting up a retail 
organization. A retail organization structures and assigns 
tasks, policies, resources, authority, responsibilities, and 
rewards to satisfy the needs of its target market, employ-
ees, and management. There are five steps in setting up 
an organization: outlining specific tasks to be performed 
in a distribution channel, dividing tasks, grouping tasks 
into jobs, classifying jobs, and integrating positions with 
an organization chart.
Specific tasks include buying, shipping, receiv-
ing and checking, pricing, and marking merchandise; 
inventory control; display preparation; facilities main-
tenance; research; customer contact and follow-up; and 
a lot more. These tasks may be divided among retailers, 
manufacturers, wholesalers, specialists, and customers.
Tasks are next grouped into jobs, such as sales per-
sonnel, cashiers, inventory personnel, display personnel, 
customer service personnel, and management. Then jobs 
are arranged by functional, product, geographic, or com-
bination classification. An organization chart displays 
the hierarchy of authority and the relationship among 
jobs, and it helps coordinates personnel.
2.	 To examine the various organizational arrangements 
utilized in retailing. Retail organization structures dif-
fer by institution. Small independents use simple for-
mats with little specialization. Many department stores 
use a version of the Mazur plan and place functions into 
store management, communications, merchandising, and 
financial accounting. The equal store format is used by 
numerous chain stores. Diversified firms have very com-
plex organizations.
3.	 To consider the special human resource environment of 
retailing. Retailers are unique due to the large number 
of inexperienced workers, long hours, employee visibil-
ity, a diverse work force, many part-time workers, and 
variations in customer demand. There is a broad range of 
career opportunities available to women and minorities, 
although improvement is still needed.
4.	 To describe the principles and practices involved with 
the human resource management process in retailing. 
This process comprises several interrelated activities: 
recruitment, selection, training, compensation, and 
supervision. In applying the process, diversity, labor 
laws, and employee privacy should be kept in mind.
Recruitment generates job applicants. Sources 
include educational institutions, channel members, 
competitors, ads, employment agencies, unsolicited 
applicants, employees, and Web sites (including social 
media).
Personnel selection requires thorough job analysis, 
creating job descriptions, using application blanks, inter-
views, testing (optional), reference checking, and physi-
cal exams. After personnel are selected, they go through 

314	
PART 5  •  MANAGING A RETAIL BUSINESS
pre-training and job training. Good training identi-
fies needs, uses proper methods, and assesses results. 
Training is usually vital for continuing, as well as new, 
personnel.
Employees are compensated by direct monetary pay-
ments and/or indirect payments. The direct compensa-
tion plans are straight salary, straight commission, and 
salary plus commission and/or bonus. Indirect payments 
involve such items as paid vacations, health benefits, and 
retirement plans.
Proper supervision is needed to sustain superior 
employee performance. A main task is employee moti-
vation. The causes of job satisfaction/dissatisfaction and 
the supervisory style must be reviewed.

Retailers are always on the lookout for ways to improve their financial performance by more 
efficiently handling their operations. The intense competitive retail landscape, increasing 
consumer expectations for higher levels of service, and lower prices make financial budgeting 
for retail operations a critical function in squeezing out costs and improving productivity.
Two approaches to developing budgets are incremental and zero-based. With incremental 
budgeting, a retailer uses prior budgets as a base line and adjusts prior budget numbers 
to reflect inflation, competition, and other factors. In zero-based budgeting, every expense 
item needs to be justified. For example, a store renovation budgeted number would get 
high scrutiny on the basis of a number of questions. Financial managers would question the 
materials used, the need to close the store for renovations, whether carpeting can remain for 
another year, and so on.
Advocates for zero-based budgeting argue that it has several major advantages over 
incremental budgeting. A fundamental premise of incremental budgeting is that the initial

PART 5  •  MANAGING A RETAIL BUSINESS
budget was prudent. This may not be the case, however. Zero-based budgeting elicits a 
cost containment, cost-conscious philosophy. A zero-based budget may arrive at new and 
innovative solutions as opposed to a ”doing it the old way” mentality. Zero-based budgeting is 
an effective way of getting different functional areas (operations, buying, and finance) to work 
together and to better understand a business from a cross-functional perspective. Nonetheless, 
because of its ease of usage and lesser time commitment, many retailers continue to engage 
in incremental budgeting.
Overview
After devising an organization structure and a human resource plan, a retailer concentrates on 
operations management—the efficient and effective implementation of the policies and tasks 
necessary to satisfy the firm’s customers, employees, and management (and stockholders, if a 
public company). This has a major impact on sales and profits. High inventory levels, long hours, 
expensive fixtures, extensive customer services, and widespread advertising may lead to higher 
revenues. But at what cost? If a store pays night-shift workers a 25 percent premium, is opening 
24 hours a day worthwhile (i.e., do higher sales justify the costs and add to overall profit)?
This chapter covers the financial aspects of operations management, with emphasis on profit 
planning, asset management, budgeting, and resource allocation. The operational dimensions of 
operations management are explored in detail in Chapter 13. A number of posts about financial 
operations may be found at our blog (www.bermanevansretail.com).
PROFIT PLANNING
A profit-and-loss (income) statement is a summary of a retailer’s revenues and expenses over a 
given period of time, usually a month, quarter, or year. It lets the firm review overall and specific 
revenues and costs for similar periods (such as January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2016, versus 
January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2015) and analyze profits. With frequent statements, a firm 
can monitor progress on goals, update performance estimates, and revise strategies and tactics.
In comparing profit-and-loss performance over time, it is crucial that the same time periods 
be used (such as the third quarter of 2016 compared with the third quarter of 2015) due to sea-
sonality. Some fiscal years may have an unequal number of weeks (53 weeks one year versus 51 
weeks another). Retailers that open new stores or expand existing stores between accounting 
periods should also take into account the larger facilities. Yearly results should reflect total revenue 
growth and the rise in same-store sales.
A profit-and-loss statement consists of several major components:
▶
▶Net sales The revenues received by a retailer during a given period after deducting customer 
returns, markdowns, and employee discounts.
▶
▶Cost of goods sold The amount a retailer pays to acquire the merchandise sold during a given 
time period. It is based on purchase prices and freight charges, less all discounts (such as 
quantity, cash, and promotion).
▶
▶Gross profit (margin) The difference between net sales and the cost of goods sold. It consists 
of operating expenses plus net profit.
▶
▶Operating expenses The cost of running a retail business.
▶
▶Taxes The portion of revenues turned over to the federal, state, and/or local government.
▶
▶Net profit after taxes The profit earned after all costs and taxes have been deducted.
Table 12-1 shows the most recent annual profit-and-loss statement for Donna’s Gift Shop, an 
independent retailer. The firm uses a fiscal year (September 1 to August 31) rather than a calendar 
year in preparing its accounting reports. These observations can be drawn from the table:
▶
▶Annual net sales were $330,000—after deducting returns, markdowns on the items sold, and 
employee discounts from total sales.
▶
▶The cost of goods sold was $180,000, computed by taking the total purchases for merchandise 
sold, adding freight, and subtracting quantity, cash, and promotion discounts.

▶
▶Gross profit was $150,000, calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold from net sales. 
This went for operating and other expenses, taxes, and profit.
▶
▶Operating expenses totaled $95,250, including salaries, advertising, supplies, shipping, insur-
ance, maintenance, and other expenses.
▶
▶Unassigned costs were $20,000.
▶
▶Net profit before taxes was $34,750, computed by deducting total costs from gross profit. The 
tax bill was $15,500, leaving a net profit after taxes of $19,250.
Overall, fiscal 2016 was pretty good for Donna; her personal salary was $43,000 and the store’s 
after-tax profit was $19,250. A further analysis of Donna’s Gift Shop’s profit-and-loss statement 
appears in the budgeting section of this chapter.
ASSET MANAGEMENT
Each retailer has assets to manage and liabilities to control. This section covers the balance sheet, 
the strategic profit model, and other ratios. A balance sheet itemizes a retailer’s assets, liabilities, 
and net worth at a specific time—based on the principle that Assets = Liabilities + Net worth. 
Table 12-2 has a balance sheet for Donna’s Gift Shop.
Assets are any items a retailer owns with a monetary value. Current assets are cash on hand 
(or in the bank) and items readily converted to cash, such as inventory on hand and accounts 
receivable (amounts owed to the firm). Fixed assets are property, buildings (a store, warehouse, 
etc.), fixtures, and equipment such as cash registers and trucks; these are used for a long period. 
The major fixed asset for many retailers is real-estate. Unlike current assets, which are recorded at 
cost, fixed assets are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Thus, records may not reflect 
the true value of these assets. Many retailing analysts use the term hidden assets to describe 
depreciated assets, such as buildings and warehouses, that are noted on a retail balance sheet at 
low values relative to their actual worth.
Liabilities are financial obligations a retailer incurs in operating a business. Current liabili-
ties are payroll expenses payable, taxes payable, accounts payable (amounts owed to suppliers), 
and short-term loans; these must be paid in the coming year. Fixed liabilities comprise mort-
gages and long-term loans; these are generally repaid over several years.
A retailer’s net worth is computed as assets minus liabilities. It is also called owner’s equity 
and represents the value of a business after deducting all financial obligations.

PART 5  •  MANAGING A RETAIL BUSINESS
In operations management, the retailer’s goal is to use its assets in the manner providing the 
best results possible. There are three basic ways to measure those results: net profit margin, asset 
turnover, and financial leverage. Each component is discussed next.
Net profit margin is a performance measure based on a retailer’s net profit and net sales:
Net profit margin = Net profit alter taxes
Net sales
At Donna’s Gift Shop, fiscal year 2016 net profit margin was 5.83 percent—a very good percent-
age for a gift shop. To enhance its net profit margin, a retailer must either raise gross profit as a 
percentage of sales or reduce expenses as a percentage of sales.1 It could lift gross profit by pur-
chasing opportunistically, selling exclusive products, avoiding price competition through excel-
lent service, and adding items with higher margins. It could reduce operating costs by stressing 
self-service, lowering labor costs, refinancing the mortgage, cutting energy costs, and so on. The 
firm must be careful not to lessen customer service to the extent that sales and profit would decline.
Asset turnover is a performance measure based on a retailer’s net sales and total assets:
Asset turnover =
Net sales
Total assets
Donna’s Gift Shop had a very low asset turnover, 1.0143—meaning it averaged $1.01 in sales per 
dollar of total assets. To improve the asset turnover ratio, a firm must generate increased sales from 
the same level of assets or keep the same sales with fewer assets. A firm might increase sales by 
having longer hours, accepting online orders, training employees to sell additional products, or 
stocking better-known brands. None of these tactics requires expanding the asset base. Or a firm 
might maintain its sales on a lower asset base by moving to a smaller store, simplifying fixtures 
(or having suppliers install fixtures), keeping a lower inventory, and negotiating for the property 
owner to pay part of the costs of a renovation.
By looking at the relationship between net profit margin and asset turnover, return on assets 
(ROA) can be computed:
 Return on assets = Net profit margin * Asset turnover
 = Net profit after taxes
Net sales

CHAPTER 12  •  Operations Management: Financial Dimensions	
319	
Donna’s Gift Shop had an ROA of 5.9 percent (0.0583 * 1.0143 = 0.059). This return is below 
average for gift stores; the good net profit margin does not adequately offset low asset turnover.
Financial leverage is a performance measure based on the relationship between a retailer’s 
total assets and net worth:
Financial leverage = Total assets
Net worth
Donna’s Gift Shop’s financial leverage ratio was 1.9314. Assets were just under twice the net 
worth, and total liabilities and net worth were almost equal. This ratio was slightly lower than the 
average for gift stores (a conservative group). The store is in no danger.
A retailer with a high financial leverage ratio has substantial debt. A ratio of 1 means it has 
no debt—assets equal net worth. If the ratio is too high, there may be an excessive focus on cost-
cutting and short-run sales so as to make interest payments, net profit margins may suffer, and 
a firm may be forced into bankruptcy if debts cannot be paid. When financial leverage is low, a 
retailer may be overly conservative—limiting its ability to renovate and expand existing stores and 
to enter new markets. Leverage is too low if the owner’s equity is relatively high; equity could be 
partly replaced by increasing short- and long-term loans and/or accounts payable. Some equity 
funds could be taken out of a business by the owner (stockholders, if a public firm).
The Strategic Profit Model
The relationship among net profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage is expressed by 
the strategic profit model, which reflects a performance measure known as return on net worth 
(RONW). See Figure 12-1. The strategic profit model can be used to plan and/or control assets. 
Thus, a retailer could learn the major cause of its poor return on net worth is weak asset turnover 
or financial leverage that is too low. A firm can raise its return on net worth by lifting the net profit 
margin, asset turnover, or financial leverage. Because these measures are multiplied to determine 
return on net worth, doubling any of them would double the return on net worth.
This is how the strategic profit model can be applied to Donna’s Gift Shop:
 Return on net worth = Net profit after taxes

After 2 years of slow growth, Ikea sales rose 11.2 percent in its 
2015 fiscal year. Sales grew fastest in China and Russia, with 
sales growth in Germany at a record level. Same-store U.S. sales 
growth was 4.5 percent. Of the 13 stores it opened in 2015, 
only one was in the United States. The remaining 12 were in 
China, Germany, France, South Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, 
Australia, and Poland. Despite being the world’s largest furniture 
chain, Ikea’s market is far from being saturated. With stores in  
28 countries, Ikea still has no presence in many markets. Although 
online sales exceeded $1 billion Euros in 2015, Ikea currently 
offers online shopping in only 13 of its 28 country locations.

PART 5  •  MANAGING A RETAIL BUSINESS
Overall, Donna’s return on net worth was above average for gift stores.
Table 12-3 applies the strategic profit model to various retailers. It is best to compare firms 
within given retail categories. For example, net profit margins of general merchandise retail-
ers have historically been higher than those of food retailers. Because financial performance 
­differs each year, caution is advised in studying these data. Furthermore, the individual compo-
nents of the strategic profit model must be analyzed, not just the return on net worth. For example,
▶
▶TJX had the highest return on net worth among all 17 retailers shown in Table 12-3. Its net 
profit margin was slightly lower than Gap, Inc., but its asset turnover was quite strong. TJX 
was also slightly more financially leveraged than Gap, Inc.
▶
▶Sears Holdings (including Sears and Kmart) had a very weak return on net worth. Its financial 
leverage and profit margin were especially weak.
▶
▶Staples outperformed Office Depot. It had a stronger profit margin and was not as leveraged.
Other Key Business Ratios
Additional ratios can also measure retailer success or failure in reaching performance goals. Here 
are several key business ratios—besides those covered in the preceding discussion:
▶
▶Quick ratio: Cash plus accounts receivable divided by total current liabilities, those due within 
one year. A ratio above 1-to-1 means the firm is liquid and can cover short-term debt.

▶
▶Current ratio: Total current assets (cash, accounts receivable, inventories, and marketable 
securities) divided by total current liabilities. A ratio of 2-to-1 or more is good.
▶
▶Collection period: Acounts receivable divided by net sales and then multiplied by 365. If most 
sales are on credit, a collection period one-third or more over normal terms (such as 40.0 for 
a store with 30-day credit terms) means slow-turning receivables.
▶
▶Accounts payable to net sales: Accounts payable divided by annual net sales. This compares 
how a retailer pays suppliers relative to volume transacted. A figure above the industry aver-
age indicates that a firm relies on suppliers to finance operations.
▶
▶Overall gross profit: Net sales minus the cost of goods sold and then divided by net sales. 
This companywide average includes markdowns, discounts, and shortages.2
For any retailer, large or small, the goal is to do as well as possible on these key business 
ratios. Areas of weakness must be identified and corrected for the firm to enhance its long-term 
results—and to avoid negative financial results. Table 12-4 describes ways to improve perfor-
mance for each of the preceding ratios, as well as asset turnover and return on net worth.
Financial Trends in Retailing
Several trends relating to asset management merit discussion: the state of the economy; funding 
sources (including initial public offerings); mergers, consolidations, and spin-offs; bankruptcies 
and liquidations; and questionable accounting and financial reporting practices.
Many retailers are affected by the strength or weakness of the economy. During a strong 
economy, high consumer demand may mask retailer weaknesses. But when the economy is weak, 
sales stagnate, cash flow problems may occur, heavy markdowns may be needed (which cut profit 
margins), consumers are more reluctant to buy big-ticket items, and public firms may see their 
stock prices adversely affected.
The housing recession in 2008 and the shallow economic recovery that followed saw deep 
discounting by retailers to lure customers to stores and malls in order to increase revenues, which 
hurt profitability. It also conditioned shoppers to expect discounts every time they purchased or 
they would not shop at all. Many people have remained frugal despite the recovery and continue

TABLE 12-4  Selected Ways for a Retailer to Improve Its Key Business Ratios
Ratios
Causes of Poor Performance
Suggestions to Improve Performance
Quick ratio
Too low a quick ratio indicates too much current 
­liabilities relative to cash and accounts receivable.
Reduce current liabilities by outsourcing delivery and 
­installation, leasing equipment (instead of purchasing),  
and turning over inventory more quickly.
Current ratio
Too low a current ratio indicates too much current 
­liabilities relative to cash, accounts receivable, 
­inventories, and marketable securities.
Reduce current liabilities. Consider outsourcing delivery and 
installation, as well as leasing equipment  
(instead of purchasing).
Collection 
period
Too long a collection period indicates too many 
­slow-paying accounts.
Increase payment requirements for store-credit accounts and 
encourage marginal shoppers to use debit cards, layaway 
programs, and bank cards.
Accounts 
­payable to 
net sales
Too high an accounts-payable-to-net-sales ratio 
­indicates that a firm heavily relies on suppliers to 
finance inventories.
Increase inventory turnover of key items by reducing 
­slow-turnover items, paying accounts payable on time,  
and purchasing more goods on consignment.
Overall gross 
profit margin
Too low an overall gross profit margin indicates a 
­combination of low net sales and a high cost of 
goods sold.
Increase profit margins through better negotiation with 
vendors to reduce the cost of goods sold, lessen the use 
of discounting, avoid “meeting the price” of competition 
tactics, and better focus on merchandise with higher profit 
margins (such as private-label items).
Asset turnover
Too low an asset turnover indicates insufficient  
sales per dollar of assets.
Improve asset turnover by extending store hours, using 
­central warehousing, outsourcing delivery and other 
­services, and leasing instead of purchasing.
Return on net 
worth
Too low a return on net worth indicates  
insufficient profit as a percent of net worth.
Increase gross profit (through better negotiation and by 
­selling a mix of more profitable goods) and lower 
­operating expenses (by eliminating costly services  
that are not valued by consumers).

PART 5  •  MANAGING A RETAIL BUSINESS
to trade down to lower-priced retailers, online retailing, and off-price and discount stores.3 The 
disruptive effect of online retailing has further eroded retailer profitability. To stay competitive, 
many retailers are making investments in upgraded supply chains, digital marketing, information 
technology (both in-store and systemwide), and logistics to implement omnichannel strategies.4 
Margins remain under pressure from discounting, free shipping, price matching, greater expenses 
for ads, the high level of online returns, and expanded store hours.
Three sources of funding are important to retailers. First, because interest rates have remained 
low, many firms have sought to refinance their mortgages and leases—which can dramatically 
decrease their monthly payments. Even though funding has sometimes been tight, due to the 
tougher restrictions imposed by the financial markets, retailers retained some leverage. The weak 
economy led to many retail store vacancies and the rental marketplace has still not fully bounced 
back. Further, prior to the recession, retail developers overbuilt, which created even more vacan-
cies. Although commercial property prices have been steadily increasing since 2008, they have 
now started to plateau despite tight supply.5
Second, shopping center developers often use a retail real-estate investment trust (REIT) to 
fund construction. With this strategy, investors buy shares in a REIT as they would a stock. Until 
the 2008 recession, investors favored REITs because property had historically been a good invest-
ment. Then, during the worst of the economic decline, many REITs struggled and their value fell. 
Nonetheless, the long-term forecast for REITs is good. Most REITS own strip malls and suburban 
shopping centers that fare better during recessions than tied to apartments or office space, and 
they typically have higher returns when domestic consumer spending rise. The limited supply of 
shopping center space in choice areas, the ability to raise rents, and the safe and relatively high 
yields of 2 to 4 percent that a typical REIT investor gets make them a desired investment vehicle.6
Third, a funding source that has gained retailing acceptance over the past 30 years is the ini-
tial public offering (IPO), whereby a privately-owned firm raises money by becoming public and 
selling stock. An IPO is typically used to fund expansion. What do investors look for in an IPO? 
Retailers with sustained high growth rates or profitability or preferably both, with unique goods or 
services, in markets with high barriers to entry are more likely to succeed. Retailers preparing to 
go public need to weigh the risks of public scrutiny of strategies, actions, and security regulations 
versus the rewards of such a move. In considering an IPO, retailers need to look beyond the cur-
rent business landscape and evaluate the long-term profitability of being publicly traded. Despite 
a lackluster IPO market in 2015, retail IPOs performed better than the market average with such 
firms as Duluth Holdings, Etsy, Ollie’s Bargain Outlet Holdings, Shopify, and Xcel going public.7
Mergers and consolidations represent a way for retailers to add to their asset base without 
building new facilities or waiting for new business units to turn a profit. They also present a way 
for weak retailers to receive financial transfusions. For example, in the last several years, Dick’s 
Sporting Goods acquired Gaylan’s, TD Bank acquired Commerce Bancorp, Dollar Tree acquired 
Family Dollar, and Foot Locker acquired Foot Action. These deals were driven by the relative 
weakness of the acquired firms. Typically, mergers and consolidations lead to some stores being 
shut, particularly those with trading-area overlap, and cutbacks among management personnel.
The leveraged buyout (LBO) is a type of acquisition in which a retail ownership change is 
mostly financed by loans from banks, investors, and others. The LBO phenomenon has had a 
big effect on retail budgeting and cash flow. At times, because debts incurred with LBOs can be 
high, some well-known retailers have had to focus more on paying interest on their debts than 
on investing in their businesses, run sales to generate enough cash to cover operating costs and 
buy new goods, and sell store units to pay off debt. Two major retailers involved with LBOs were 
weakened: Toys “R” Us and Barneys New York.
Retailers sometimes consolidate their businesses to streamline operations and improve profits. 
Winn-Dixie, Eddie Bauer, Kmart, Macy’s, Pier 1, Michaels, Sears, and many others have shut 
underperforming stores. Other times, retailers use spin-offs to generate more money or to sell a 
division that no longer meets expectations. Many retailers (Macy’s, Life Time Fitness, etc.) and 
restaurant chains (Darden, Bob Evans, etc.) spin off their real-estate to REITs or external investors 
and then lease them back.8 Retailers may spin off a division for strategic reasons. For example, 
eBay spun off PayPal, its online payments division, because technology advances, growth oppor-
tunities, and challenges for the two business had diverged. As two standalone firms, each is 
now able to compete more effectively in its respective market.9 Unlike a retail-estate spin-off, a 
business unit spin-off or split does not generate additional funds.10 Hot Topic, a popular national

retailer that sells music and pop culture-inspired clothes and accessories for young women spun 
off Torrid, which sells plus-size goth, rave, and punk clothing.11 Supervalu, the grocery retailer is 
spinning off its discount retail chain Save-A-Lot.12
To safeguard against mounting debts, as well as to continue in business, faltering retailers 
may seek bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code (which was 
toughened in 2005). In November 2006, when the economy was quite strong, only 3.8 percent 
of the large retailers tracked by a turnaround consulting firm were facing a high possibility of 
bankruptcy or financial distress. By November 2008, the figure had risen to 25.8 percent.13 Today, 
the figure is much lower (closer to pre-recession percentages), but rising in the retail sector.14
With bankruptcy protection, retailers can renegotiate bills, get out of leases, and work with 
creditors to plan for the future. Declaring bankruptcy has major ramifications: disruptions in sup-
ply (cash payment for stock purchased 20 days prior to bankruptcy); loss of key executives and 
demoralization of those who stay; short time frame to reorganize or sell stores; emergency liquida-
tion of stock in stores that are trimmed; and the legal and financial advisory fees of bankruptcy 
protection. Chapter 11 bankruptcy fends off creditors and lets firms pay off debt and survive what 
may be a temporary upheaval. More than half of large store-based retailers who filed for bank-
ruptcy since 2006 have been liquidated.15 See Figure 12-2.
Since 2008, several large retailers have declared bankruptcy, with some ultimately going 
out of business. These include American Apparel (2015), Circuit City (2008), Linens ‘n Things 
(2008), A&P (2015), Radio Shack (2015), Blockbuster (2010), Borders (2011), Sbarro (2011 and 
2014), Friedman’s (2008), Brookstone (2014), and Quiksilver (2015).16
American Apparel entered into a bankruptcy in which its secured lenders would receive shares 
in the reformed company in exchange for the bonds they held. Extra financing was also obtained 
from participating bondholders to enable American Apparel to keep its manufacturing operations 
functioning and its 130 U.S. stores open. The reorganization would wipe out the holdings of exist-
ing American Apparel stockholders.
Some retailers that focus on teenage consumers have recently struggled. In 2014, for exam-
ple, Wet Seal, Bed Shops, Delia’s, and Body Central declared bankruptcy. Many teenagers have 
switched to shopping with H&M, Zara, and other “fast-fashion” retailers that can quickly stock 
fast-selling fashion items from Asian suppliers.17
When a retailer goes out of business, it is painful for all parties: the owner/stockholders, 
employees, creditors, landlords (who then have vacant store sites), and customers. See Figure 12-3.
As with other sectors of business, over the last few years, some retailers have been heavily criti-
cized for questionable accounting and financial practices. Sometimes, the practices have been illegal. 
For example, Sterling—which owns the Kay, Zales, Jared, and Signet jewelry chains—has been under 
scrutiny because it receives more revenue for sales made with extended-credit servicing plans pro-
vided by its own in-house facility. This may overstate revenues and profits and misleads investors.18

PART 5  •  MANAGING A RETAIL BUSINESS
To avoid questionable or illegal practices, many larger retailers have enacted formal policies. 
At Home Depot, for example, there is a detailed “Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers,” as 
shown here. The code applies to Home Depot’s chief executive, chief financial officer, and other 
high-ranking personnel. Each of these executives must adhere to such practices as the following:
▶
▶Act in all financial and accounting matters in a way that shows honesty, integrity, and fairness.
▶
▶Do not let personal interests override company interests; and avoid conflicts of interest.
▶
▶Report data that have been recorded inaccurately.
▶
▶Be sure that all activities are lawful, accurate, complete, and not intended to mislead.
▶
▶Be proactive in promoting ethical behavior.
▶
▶Responsibly use company resources.19
BUDGETING
Budgeting outlines a retailer’s planned expenditures for a given time based on expected per-
formance. Costs are linked to satisfying target market, employee, and management goals. What 
should labor costs be to attain a certain level of customer service? What compensation will moti-
vate salespeople? What operating expenses will reach intended revenue and profit goals?
There are several benefits from a retailer’s meticulously preparing a budget:
▶
▶Expenditures are clearly related to expected performance, and costs can be adjusted as goals 
are revised. This enhances productivity.
▶
▶Resources are allocated to the right departments, product categories, and so on.
▶
▶Spending for various departments, product categories, and so on is coordinated.
▶
▶Because planning is structured and integrated, the goal of efficiency is prominent.

Going Out of 
Business
Often, when retailers 
go out of business, it is 
because they are “missing 
the mark.” They are not 
properly executing their 
strategies, they lose some 
key suppliers, their cash 
flow is poor, and they 
cannot attract enough 
loyal customers.

Retail financial analysts are responsible for tasks relating to 
profit planning, asset management, and retail budgeting. These 
professionals typically have a degree in accounting, finance, or 
retail management. In addition to knowing both accounting and 
finance, retail financial analysts must be entrepreneurial, com-
fortable working with spreadsheets, and able to understand 
the operation of a retail business. These are a few long-term 
questions retail financial analysts must consider on a daily basis 
and in terms of long-range planning: What costs are associated 
with closing a store? How can asset turnover be improved? Will 
increased sales of private-label goods increase net profit?
What criteria would you use to answer these questions?

▶
▶Cost standards are set, such as advertising equals 5 percent of sales.
▶
▶A firm prepares for the future rather than reacts to it.
▶
▶Expenditures are monitored during a budget cycle. If a firm allots $50,000 to buy new mer-
chandise, and it has spent $33,000 halfway through a cycle, it has $17,000 remaining.
▶
▶A firm can analyze planned budgets versus actual budgets.
▶
▶Costs and performance can be compared with industry averages.
A retailer should be aware of the effort involved in the budgeting process, recognize that 
forecasts may not be fully accurate (due to unexpected demand, competitors’ tactics, and so on), 
and modify plans as needed. The process should not be too conservative (or inflexible) or simply 
add a percentage to each expense category to arrive at the next budget, such as increasing spend-
ing by 3 percent across the board based on anticipated sales growth of 3 percent. The budgeting 
process is shown in Figure 12-4 and described next.
Preliminary Budgeting Decisions
There are six preliminary decisions. First, budgeting authority is specified. In top-down budget-
ing, senior executives make centralized financial decisions and communicate them down the 
line to succeeding levels of managers. In bottom-up budgeting, lower-level executives develop 
departmental budget requests; these requests are assembled and a company budget is designed. 
­Bottom-up budgeting includes varied perspectives, holds managers more accountable, and 
enhances employee morale. Many firms combine aspects of the two approaches.
Second, the time frame is defined. Most firms have budgets with yearly, quarterly, and monthly 
components. Annual spending is planned, and costs and performance are regularly reviewed. This 
responds to seasonal or other fluctuations. Sometimes, the time frame is longer than a year; other times 
it’s shorter than a month. When a firm opens new stores over a 5-year period, it sets construction costs 
for the entire period. When a supermarket orders perishables, it has weekly budgets for each item.
Third, budgeting frequency is determined. Many firms review budgets on an ongoing basis, 
but most plan them yearly. In some firms, several months may be set aside each year for the bud-
geting process; this lets all participants have time to gather data and facilitates taking the budgets 
through several drafts.

PART 5  •  MANAGING A RETAIL BUSINESS
Fourth, cost categories are established:
▶
▶Capital expenditures are long-term investments in land, buildings, fixtures, and equipment. 
Operating expenditures are the short-term expenses of running a business.
▶
▶Fixed costs, such as store security, remain constant for the budget period regardless of the 
retailer’s performance. Variable costs, such as sales commissions, are based on performance. 
If performance is good, these expenses often rise. Figure 12-5 shows that the clock is always 
ticking with regard to the timing of costs.
▶
▶Direct costs are incurred by specific departments, product categories, and so on, such as 
the earnings of department-based salespeople. Indirect costs, such as centralized cashiers, 
are shared by multiple departments, product categories, and so on.
▶
▶Natural account expenses are reported by the names of the costs, such as salaries, and not 
assigned by purpose. Functional account expenses are classified on the basis of the purpose 
or activity for which expenditures are made, such as cashier salaries.
Fifth, the level of detail is set. Should spending be assigned by department (produce), product 
category (fresh fruit), product subcategory (apples), and/or product item (McIntosh apples)? With 
a very detailed budget, every expense subcategory must be adequately covered.
Sixth, budget flexibility is prescribed. A budget should be strict enough to guide planned 
spending and link costs to goals. Yet, a budget that is too inflexible may not let a retailer adapt 
to changing market conditions, capitalize on new opportunities, or modify a poor strategy (if fur-
ther spending is needed to improve matters). Budget flexibility is often expressed in quantitative 
terms, such as allowing a buyer to increase a quarterly budget by a certain maximum percentage 
if demand is higher than anticipated.
Ongoing Budgeting Process
After making preliminary budgeting decisions, the retailer engages in the ongoing budgeting 
process shown in Figure 12-4: 
▶
▶Goals are set based on customer, employee, and management needs.
▶
▶Performance standards are specified, including customer-service levels, the compensation 
needed to motivate employees, and the sales and profits needed to satisfy management. Typi-
cally, the budget is related to a sales forecast, which projects revenues for the next period. 
Forecasts are usually broken down by department or product category.
▶
▶Expenditures are planned in terms of performance goals. In zero-based budgeting, a firm starts 
each new budget from scratch and outlines the expenditures needed to reach that period’s goals. 
FIGURE 12-5
Cash Flow and the 
Ticking Clock
One of the challenges that 
retailers must face is to 
best synchronize revenues 
and costs. The clock is 
always ticking with regard 
to retail buying, inventory 
on hand, personnel, 
and other costs relative 
to when revenues are 
received.

All costs are justified each time a budget is done. With incremental budgeting, a firm uses cur-
rent and past budgets as guides and adds to or subtracts from them to arrive at the coming period’s 
spending. Most firms use incremental budgeting; it is easier, less time-consuming, and not as risky.
▶
▶Actual expenditures are made. The retailer pays rent and employee salaries, buys merchan-
dise, places ads, and so on.
▶
▶Results are monitored: (1) Actual expenditures are compared with planned spending for each 
expense category, and reasons for any deviations are reviewed. (2) The firm learns if perfor-
mance standards have been met and tries to explain deviations.
▶
▶The budget is adjusted. Revisions are major or minor, depending on how closely a firm has 
come to reaching its goals. The funds allotted to some expense categories may be reduced, 
while greater funds may be provided to other categories.

There are small rounding errors.
a Variance in dollars is a positive number if actual sales or profits are higher than expected or actual expenses are lower than 
expected; variance is a negative number if actual sales or profits are lower than expected or actual expenses are higher than expected. 
Variance in percent depends upon the deviation of the actual percent of each budgeted item from the budgeted percent of each item.
As a condition for obtaining a loan and maintain a line of credit, 
banks and other lenders commonly require specific covenants to a 
loan agreement. These may require the borrower to pay expenses 
promptly, submit financial statements, and maintain specific key 
ratios (such as current and quick rations, debt to net worth, and 
return on equity). Retailers not in compliance with these require-
ments can have their loan called in full by the bank or lender, face 
an increase in interest rates, or pay a penalty. Some retailers not 
complying with key ratio requirements have resorted to certain 
unethical practices. These include not marking down unsaleable 
inventories, disregarding bad debts, underestimating tax liabilities, 
charging expenses to future time periods, and deferring necessary 
building maintenance. In other instances, these retailers may choose 
to borrow additional funds without notifying the initial lender.
Discuss the ethics of these actions to avoid compliance issues.

expected and actual results for each profit-and-loss item. Variances are positive if performance is 
better than expected and negative if it is worse.
As Table 12-5 indicates, in dollar terms, net profit after taxes was $7,250 higher than bud-
geted. Sales were $30,000 higher than expected; thus, the cost of goods sold was $15,000 higher. 
Actual operating expenses were $750 lower than expected, while other costs were $2,000 
higher. Table 12-5 also shows results in percentage terms. This lets a firm evaluate budgeted ver-
sus actual performance on a percent-of-sales basis. In Donna’s case, actual net profit after taxes 
was 5.83 percent of sales—better than planned. The higher net profit was mostly due to the actual 
operating costs percentage being lower than planned.
A firm must closely monitor cash flow, which relates the amount and timing of revenues 
received to the amount and timing of expenditures for a specific time. In cash flow management, 
the usual goal is to make sure revenues are received before expenditures are paid.20 Otherwise, 
short-term loans may be needed or profits may be tied up in inventory and other expenses. For 
seasonal retailers, this may be unavoidable. Underestimating costs and overestimating revenues, 
both of which affect cash flow, are leading causes of new business failures. Table 12-6 has cash 
flow examples.
RESOURCE ALLOCATION
In allotting financial resources, the magnitude of various costs as well as productivity should be 
examined. Each has significance for asset management and budgeting.
Learn more about cash flow  
here (www.entrepreneur 
.com/topic/cash-flow- 
management).
TABLE 12-6  The Effects of Cash Flow
A.
A retailer has rather consistent sales throughout the year. Therefore, the cash flow in any given month is 
positive. This means no short-term loans are needed, and the owner can withdraw funds from the firm if 
she so desires:

A retailer has highly seasonal sales that peak in December. Yet, to have a good assortment of merchan-
dise on hand during December, it must order merchandise in September and October and pay for it in 
November. As a result, it has a negative cash flow in November that must be financed by a short-term 
loan. All debts are paid off in January, after the peak selling season is completed:

The Magnitude of Various Costs
As noted before, spending can be divided into two categories. Capital expenditures are long-term 
investments in fixed assets. Operating expenditures are short-term selling and administrative 
costs in running a business. It is vital to have a sense of the magnitude of various capital and 
operating costs.
These are a rough average of capital expenditures (for the basic building shell; heating, ven-
tilation, and air conditioning; interior lighting; flooring; display fixtures; ceilings; interior and 
exterior signage; and roofing) for erecting the following single freestanding store for these 
­retailers: big-box stores (including department stores), $5.65 million; supermarkets, $5.0 million; 
home centers, $2.7 million; and convenience stores—$685,000. Thus, a typical home center chain 
must be prepared to invest $2.7 million to build each new store (which averages more than 
44,000 square feet industrywide), not including land and merchandise costs; the total could be 
higher if a bigger store is built.21
Remodeling can also be expensive. It is prompted by competitive pressures, mergers and 
acquisitions, consumer trends, the requirement of complying with the Americans with Disabilities 
Act, environmental concerns, and other factors.
To reduce their investments, some retailers insist that real-estate developers help pay for 
building, renovating, and fixture costs. These tenant demands reflect some areas’ oversaturation, 
the amount of retail space available due to the liquidation of some retailers and mergers, and the 
interest of developers in gaining tenants that generate consumer traffic (such as category killers).
Operating expenses, usually expressed as a percentage of sales, range from 20 percent or so in 
supermarkets to more than 40 percent in some specialty stores. To succeed, these costs must be 
in line with competitors’ costs. Costco has an edge over many rivals due to lower SGA (selling, 
general, and administrative costs as a percentage of sales): Costco, 10 percent; Walmart, 20 ­percent; 
Target, 20 percent; Kohl’s, 23 percent; Dillard’s, 25 percent; and Macy’s, Inc., 30 percent.22
Resource allocation must also take into account opportunity costs—possible benefits a 
retailer forgoes if it invests in one opportunity rather than another. If a chain renovates 15 existing 
stores at a total cost of $3.5 million, it cannot open a new outlet requiring a $3.5 million invest-
ment. Financial resources are finite; consequently, firms often face either/or decisions.
Productivity
Due to erratic sales revenues, mixed economic growth, high labor costs, intense competition, and 
other factors, many retailers place great priority on their productivity, the efficiency with which 
a retail strategy is carried out. Productivity can be described in terms of costs as a percentage of 
sales, the time it takes a cashier to complete a transaction, profit margins, sales per square foot, 
inventory turnover, and so forth. The key question is: How can sales and profit goals be reached 
while keeping control over costs?
Because different retail strategy mixes have distinct resource needs as to store location, fix-
tures, personnel, and other elements, productivity must be based on norms for each type of strategy

According to some retail experts, front-end products that are sold 
near checkout registers account for 1 percent of supermarket 
sales but 4 percent of the store’s gross profits. Retailers have 
embraced self-scanning due to labor-cost savings and the appeal 
to some customers; but the increased use of self-scanning has 
taken a toll on impulse sales. Customers at a self-scanning regis-
ter have neither the time nor interest in impulse goods (such as 
magazines, beverages, candy, batteries, etc.). In addition, usually 
there are few impulse goods positioned near self-scanners. Super-
markets and drugstores need to carefully analyze the trade-off of 
lower impulse sales and profits in self-scanning equipment with 
the reduction in labor costs. They also need to consider offering 
targeted coupons to self-scanning customers to increase future 
impulse purchases.
What are your conclusions about the self-scanning  
trade-offs? Why?

mix (such as department stores versus full-line discount stores). Sales growth should also be 
measured on the basis of comparable seasons, using the same stores. Otherwise, the data will be 
affected by seasonality and/or the increased square footage of stores.
There are two ways to enhance productivity: (1) A firm can improve employee performance, 
sales per foot of space, and other factors by upgrading training programs, increasing advertising, 
and so forth. (2) It can reduce costs by automating, having suppliers do certain tasks, and so forth. 
A retailer could use a small core of full-time workers during nonpeak times, supplemented with 
part-timers in peak periods.
Productivity must not be measured from a cost-cutting perspective alone. This may under-
mine customer loyalty. One of the more complex dilemmas omnichannel retailers face is how 
to handle online purchases returned to the store. To control the higher costs associated with pro-
cessing online purchases in stores, some retailers have decided not to allow online purchases to 
be returned at their stores. This policy has upset a lot of customers and resulted in most of these 
firms changing their policies.
Here are two examples of strategies that diverse retailers have used to raise productivity:
▶
▶Many firms are using computer software to improve their allocation of shelf space to be more 
productive per square foot. The Winn-Dixie and ShopKo supermarket chains are among those 
that utilize SAS Retail Space Management software.
▶
▶Department store retailer Macy’s, which also owns Bloomingdale’s and BlueMercury, is rely-
ing on cost efficiencies and a flatter, more agile organizational structure to pursue growth and 
regain market share in its core omnichannel businesses. Measures include reducing the store 
portfolio and reinvesting resources online and with stores having the highest sales potential. 
Savings in labor costs will come through a 2 percent reduction in store personnel, back-
office staff, and voluntary separation options for senior executives. Consolidating Macy’s 
Inc. credit and consumer service facilities and reducing budgets for meetings and travel will 
further reduce costs.23
It is vital that retailers, in their quest to become more productive, not alienate their customers 
and diminish the shopping experience. Increasing sales productivity by reducing costs is common, 
but the true challenge in a retailer’s performance is to build productivity profitably.

1.	 To define operations management. Operations manage-
ment involves efficiently and effectively implementing 
the tasks and policies to satisfy the retailer’s customers, 
employees, and management. This chapter covered the 
financial aspects of operations management. Operational 
dimensions are studied in Chapter 13.
2.	 To discuss profit planning. The profit-and-loss (income) 
statement summarizes a retailer’s revenues and expenses 
over a specific time, typically on a monthly, quarterly, 
and/or yearly basis. It consists of these major compo-
nents: net sales, cost of goods sold, gross profit (margin), 
operating expenses, and net profit after taxes.
3.	 To describe asset management, including the strategic 
profit model, other key business ratios, and financial 
trends in retailing. Each retailer has assets and liabilities 
to manage. A balance sheet shows assets, liabilities, and 
net worth at a given time. Assets are items with a mone-
tary value owned by a retailer; some appreciate and may 
have a hidden value. Liabilities are financial obligations. 
The retailer’s net worth, also called owner’s equity, is 
computed as assets minus liabilities.
Asset management may be measured by reviewing 
the net profit margin, asset turnover, and financial lever-
age. Net profit margin equals net profit divided by net 
sales. Asset turnover equals net sales divided by total 
assets. By multiplying the net profit margin by asset 
turnover, a retailer can find its return on assets—which 
is based on net sales, net profit, and total assets. Finan-
cial leverage equals total assets divided by net worth. 
The strategic profit model incorporates asset turnover, 
profit margin, and financial leverage to yield the return 
on net worth. It allows a retailer to better plan and con-
trol its asset management. Other key ratios for retail-
ers are the quick ratio, current ratio, collection period, 
accounts payable to net sales, and overall gross profit 
(in percent).
Important financial trends involve the state of the 
economy; funding sources; mergers, consolidations, and 
spin-offs; bankruptcies and liquidations; and question-
able accounting and financial reporting practices.

4.	 To look at retail budgeting. Budgeting outlines a retailer’s 
planned expenditures for a given time based on expected 
performance; costs are linked to goals. Six preliminary 
decisions are (a) Responsibility is defined by top-down 
and/or bottom-up methods. (b) The time frame is speci-
fied. (c) Budgeting frequency is set. (d) Cost categories 
are established. (e) The level of detail is ascertained. (f) 
Budgeting flexibility is determined.
The ongoing budgeting process then proceeds: 
goals, performance standards, planned spending, actual 
expenditures, monitoring results, and adjustments. With 
zero-based budgeting, each budget starts from scratch; 
with incremental budgeting, current and past budgets 
are guides. The budgeted versus actual profit-and-loss 
statement and the percentage profit-and-loss state-
ment are vital tools. In all budgeting decisions, cash 
flow, which relates the amount and timing of revenues 
received with the amount and timing of expenditures, 
must be considered.
5.	 To examine resource allocation. Both the magnitude of 
costs and productivity need to be examined. Costs can be 
divided into capital and operating categories; both must 
be regularly reviewed. Opportunity costs mean forgoing 
possible benefits if a retailer invests in one opportunity 
rather than another. Productivity is the efficiency with 
which a retail strategy is carried out; the goal is to maxi-
mize sales and profits while keeping costs in check.

Objectives
1. To describe the 
important role of

Digital technologies such as the Web, mobile devices, and social media influence virtually 
every aspect of retailing. Digital interactions accounted for 36 cents of every U.S dollar 
of approximately $22.5 trillion global retail sales in 2015.1 Today, 12 percent of all digital 
retail buying now occurs through mobile devices. Most important are the rapid growth 
in technology-mediated retailing; the disruptive and irreversible pace of technological 
change; the strength of online-only retailers in some product categories; and the increasing 
expectations of the always-on omnichannel customer to pay, buy, and return anything, 
anywhere, at any time, using any device. These factors introduce additional opportunities and 
risks for retail managers and significant implications for retail store operations, which is the 
focus of this chapter.
How would you feel about paying with your face? Using a new system called MasterCard 
Identity Check, the credit-card provider will be able to use face recognition and fingerprint 
scans to better secure online shopping. Known as “selfie pay,” this system uses an image of a 
shopper’s face or fingerprint (instead of a password) to help fend off fraudsters. Users of selfie 
pay must take an initial photo that is converted into a string of 0s and 1s. Those opting to 
pay by “selfie” will have to blink to prove that an old photo is not being used to bypass the 
system. Advocates for selfie pay believe that although it’s possible to change a compromised 
password, it is much harder—if not practically impossible—for most people to change their 
face or fingerprints.2

CHAPTER 13  •  Operations Management: Operational Dimensions	
333	
Overview
Operations management is the efficient and effective implementation of the policies and tasks 
that satisfy a retailer’s customers, employees, and management (and stockholders, if it is pub-
licly owned). Chapter 12 examined the financial dimensions of operations management; this 
chapter covers the operational aspects. This chapter covers the operational aspects of operations 
management.
For firms to succeed in the long term, operational areas need to be managed well. A decision 
to change a store format or to introduce new antitheft equipment must be carefully reviewed 
because these acts greatly affect performance. In running their businesses, retail executives must 
make a wide range of operational decisions, such as these:
▶
▶What operating guidelines are used?
▶
▶What is the optimal format and size of a store? What is the relationship among shelf space, 
shelf location, and sales for each item in the store? How does the company’s online store 
affect store size, assortment, and return policies?
▶
▶How can personnel best be matched to customer traffic flows? How do retailers optimize staff 
size to maximize productivity? What policies should retailers adopt to leverage or counter 
in-store showrooming? What impact do self-service and mobile payment have on revenues?
▶
▶What effect does the use of various building materials have on store maintenance? How can 
energy costs be better controlled? How often should facilities be renovated?
▶
▶How can inventory best be managed? How do online, order online and pick up in store, and 
mobile sales and returns impact inventory decisions? What is the optimal balance between 
satisfying customer needs and having too much selection?
▶
▶How can the personal safety of shoppers and employees be ensured?
▶
▶What levels of insurance (fire, flood, life insurance on key personnel, business interruption) 
are required?
▶
▶How can credit transactions be managed most effectively? How do mobile payment technolo-
gies affect purchase behavior?
▶
▶How can computer systems improve operating efficiency? How can retailers leverage mobile 
technology to enhance consumer experiences and purchase conversions in-store?
▶
▶Should any aspects of operations be outsourced (within the U.S. and/or abroad)?
▶
▶What crisis management plans should there be in an omnichannel, socially connected world?
OPERATING A RETAIL BUSINESS
We now look at the operations blueprint: store format, size, and space allocation; personnel uti-
lization; store maintenance, energy management, and renovations; inventory management; store 
security; insurance; credit management; computerization; outsourcing; and crisis management.
Operations Blueprint
An operations blueprint systematically lists all operating functions to be performed, their char-
acteristics, and their timing. When developing a blueprint, the retailer specifies, in detail, every 
operating function from the store’s opening to closing—and those responsible for them.3 For 
example, who opens the store? When? What are the steps (turning off the alarm, turning on power, 
setting up the computer, etc.)? The performance of these tasks must not be left to chance.
A large or diversified retailer may use multiple blueprints and have separate blueprints for 
such areas as store maintenance, inventory management, credit management, and store displays. 
When a retailer modifies its store format or operating procedures (such as relying more on self-
service), it must also adjust the operations blueprint(s).
Figure 13-1 has an operations blueprint for a quick-oil-change firm. It identifies employee 
and customer tasks (in order) and expected performance times for each activity. Advantages of 
this blueprint—and others—are that it standardizes activities (in a location and between loca-
tions), isolates points at which operations may be weak or prone to fail (Do employees actually 
check transmission, brake, and power-steering fluids in one minute?), outlines a plan that can be 
evaluated for completeness (Should customers be offered different grades of oil?), shows person-
nel needs (Should one person change oil and another wash the windshield?), and helps identify

productivity improvements (Should the customer or an employee drive a car into and out of the 
service bay?).
Store Format, Size, and Space Allocation
Store format decisions include site planning (such as a planned shopping center rather than 
an unplanned business district), construction choices (such as prefabricated materials), store 
size, store design, and store layouts. Some leading retailers use differentiated formats to align 
assortments to specific consumers and segments, to optimize space profitability, and to create a 
­better customer destination. Multiformat apparel and accessories retailer Inditex has Massimo 
Dutti stores (personalized service for affluent men and women); Bershka (targeting a younger  
market with a store resembling a social meeting place); and its core brand Zara (targeting the 
mid-market, age group 20 to 35 with “cheap and chic” offerings). Some firms, including Target 
and Walmart (such as Walmart to Go) are using smaller format stores with lower operating costs 
(for rent, inventory, and lighting) and better access to locations in urban areas—in addition to 
their larger facilities.
A key store format decision for chain retailers is whether to use prototype stores, whereby 
multiple outlets conform to relatively uniform construction, layout, and operations standards. They 
make centralized management control easier, reduce construction costs, standardize operations, 
facilitate the interchange of employees among outlets, allow bulk purchases of fixtures and other 
materials, and convey a consistent chain image. Yet, a strict reliance on prototypes may lead to 
inflexibility, failure to adapt to or capitalize on local customer needs, and too little creativity. 
McDonald’s, Pep Boys, Starbucks, and most supermarket chains have prototype stores.
Together with prototype stores, some chains use rationalized retailing programs to com-
bine a high degree of centralized management control with strict operating procedures for every 
phase of business at all of their outlets. Rigid control and standardization make this technique 
easy to enact and manage, and a firm can add a significant number of stores in a short time. See 
Figure 13-2. Dunkin’ Donuts, Old Navy, Toys “R” Us, and many major supermarket chains use 
rationalized retailing. They operate many stores that are similar in size, layout, and merchandis-
ing. Rationalized retailing also enables consumers to locate merchandise and to feel comfortable 
when visiting a new store.

(www.teamofchoice.com) 
has collaborated with a 
number of retailers to

PART 5  •  MANAGING A RETAIL BUSINESS
Many retailers use one or both of two contrasting store-size approaches to be distinctive 
and to deal with high rents in some metropolitan markets. Home Depot, Barnes & Noble, Sta-
ples, Best Buy, and Dick’s Sporting Goods have category-killer stores with huge assortments 
that try to dominate smaller stores. Food-based warehouse stores and large discount-oriented 
stores often situate in secondary sites, where rents are low and confidence is high that they 
can draw customers. Cub Foods (a warehouse chain) and Walmart engage in this approach. 
At the same time, some retailers believe large stores are not efficient in serving saturated (or 
small) markets; they have been opening smaller stores or downsizing existing ones because 
of high rents.
Getting the right store and shelf-space management strategy is key to driving traffic, retail 
sales revenues, and profitability. Retailers have to understand consumer needs, preferences, and 
purchase behavior across online and offline channels to better “curate” assortments and to opti-
mize their space and assortments. They can use facilities productively by identifying the right 
amount of space, the right number of brands, and the placement of each product category to most 
profitably meet retailer and customer needs. Sometimes, retailers drop merchandise lines because 
they occupy too much space relative to sales, margins, and/or turnover. Today, many department 
stores focus more on apparel and cosmetics and less on electronics, appliances, and home furnish-
ings (such as carpeting and window treatments).
The growth in cross-channel shopping allows retailers to leverage their Web sites as an “end-
less aisle” opportunity to extend their offerings without expanding physical space while lowering 
operating costs. This can support sales of long-tail SKUs (odd sizes, last season’s colors, and so 
on) at full price, without sacrificing shelf space in stores. To ensure cross-channel coordination, 
Gap has been testing an “order-in-store” option in several locations, where store customers can 
place online orders from within the shops with free shipping—if the customer picks up from the 
store at a later date. This presents opportunities for additional purchases and cross-selling. At 
Bonobos stores, a men’s clothing retailer, customers can purchase items, but they do not leave 
with merchandise in-hand; rather, it is shipped to them days later.
With a top-down space management approach, a retailer starts with its total available 
store space (by outlet and the overall firm, if a chain), divides space into categories, and then 
works on product layouts. In contrast, a bottom-up space management approach begins plan-
ning at the individual product level and then proceeds to category, total store, and overall com-
pany levels.
Measures by some retailers to improve store space productivity include vertical displays, 
which occupy less room and hang on walls and/or from ceilings. Formerly free space may have 
small point-of-sale displays and vending machines; sometimes, product displays are in front of 
stores. Open doorways, mirrored walls, and vaulted ceilings give small stores a larger appear-
ance. Up to 75 percent or more of total space may be used for selling; the rest is for storage, rest 
rooms, and so on. Scrambled merchandising (with high-profit, high-turnover items) occupies 
more space in stores and at Web sites than before. By having longer hours, retailers can also use 
space better.
In Canada and the United States, Visa, MasterCard, and Ameri-
can Express account for about 93 percent of all online payments. 
But in Mexico, these three credit-card companies account for only 
44 percent of online payments; cash-based methods account for 
24 percent; and bank transfers account for 22 percent. In addi-
tion, many Mexican credit cards are not enabled for cross-border 
purchases. As a consequence, retailers need to use a local bank 
if they do not have a payments processor with the necessary 
connections. In Germany, credit cards account for a relatively 
small market share: Visa, MasterCard, and American Express 
represent just one-quarter of online purchases; 35 percent come 
from a Europe-wide direct-debit system. Other popular methods 
include local payment companies Sofort and Giropay (16 percent 
combined) and U.S.-based PayPal (10 percent). Open invoices 
account for another 15 percent of payments.
What are the effects of these data on an online retailer seek-
ing to expand in Mexico and Germany?

337	
Personnel Utilization
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, millions of people work in retailing as salesper-
sons, clerks, customer service representatives, cashiers, and other positions. From an operations 
perspective, efficiently utilizing retail personnel is vital:
1.	 Labor costs are high—the largest category of controllable, nonmerchandise costs for most 
retailers, with wages and benefits accounting for up to one-half of operating costs. Forthcom-
ing state and city legislation to raise minimum wages will further lift labor costs.
2.	 High employee turnover means increased recruitment, training, and management costs.
3.	 Poor-performing personnel may have poor sales skills, mistreat shoppers, mis-ring transac-
tions, and make other errors.
4.	 Productivity gains in technology have exceeded those in labor; yet some retailers are still 
labor intensive.
5.	 Labor scheduling is often subject to unanticipated demand. Retailers know they must increase 
staff in peak periods and reduce it in slow ones, but they may still be over- or understaffed if 
weather changes, competitors run specials, or suppliers increase promotions.
6.	 There is less flexibility for firms with unionized employees. Working conditions, compensa-
tion, tasks, overtime pay, performance measures, termination procedures, seniority rights, 
and promotion criteria are generally specified in union contracts.
Because online and mobile shopping account for a larger portion of sales revenues, the role 
of in-store sales personnel has evolved in response to shoppers’ in-store expectations. Retailers are 
increasingly equipping in-store personnel with tablets and smartphones, as well as giving them 
access to customer accounts so they can update data on preferences and anticipated future purchases 
to enhance cross-selling efforts. Instead of resisting showrooming in their stores, some sales staff 
help customers find products, check product reviews, and compare prices using the retailers’ mobile 
apps; order stockouts or irregular-sized products via the retailers’ internal Web sites; and process 
payment using mobile POS on their tablets. All of this is may be done instead of shoppers lining 
up at the cashier. Increasingly, customer service personnel are expected to engage with, respond 
to, and solve customer concerns expressed on blogs, social media, and customer review Web sites.
Tactics to maximize personnel productivity include the following:
▶
▶Hiring process. By very carefully screening potential employees before they are offered jobs, 
turnover is reduced and better performance secured.
▶
▶Workload forecasts. For each time period, the number and type of employees are prede-
termined. A drugstore may have one pharmacist, one cashier, and one stockperson from 
2:00 P.M. to 5:00 P.M. on weekdays and add a pharmacist and a cashier from 5:00 P.M. to 
7:30 P.M. (to accommodate those shopping after work). In workload forecasts, costs must 
be balanced against the possibilities of lost sales if customer waiting time is excessive. The 
key is to be both efficient (cost-oriented) and effective (service-oriented). Many retailers 
use software in employee scheduling. Firms such as Invision (www.invisionwfm.com) have 
devised software to aid retailers in workload forecasting.
▶
▶Job standardization and cross-training. Through job standardization, the tasks of person-
nel with similar positions in different departments, such as cashiers in clothing and candy 
departments, are rather uniform. With cross-training, personnel learn tasks associated with 
more than one job, such as cashier, stockperson, and gift wrapper. A firm increases personnel 
flexibility, reduces employee boredom and the number of employees needed at any time by 
job standardization and cross-training. If one department is slow, a cashier could be assigned 
to a busy one; and a salesperson could process transactions, set up displays, and handle 
complaints. As consumers increasingly turn to mobile devices, in-store employees need to 
be trained to use mobile technology to enhance consumer experiences and improve purchase 
conversion and basket size.
▶
▶Good communications. Employees work best when they are clear about their responsibilities 
and well informed about policies and current company news. See Figure 13-3.
▶
▶Employee performance standards. Each worker is given clear goals and is accountable for 
them. Cashiers are judged on transaction speed and mis-rings, buyers on department revenues 
and markdowns, and senior executives on the firm’s reaching sales and profit targets. Person-
nel are more productive when working toward specific goals.

▶
▶Compensation. Financial remuneration, promotions, and recognition that reward good perfor-
mance will help motivate employees. A salesperson is motivated to “cross-sell” goods (ties 
and shirts with the purchase of a suit) if there is a bonus for related-item selling. Retailers 
using commission-based or two-tier compensation policies (low base pay plus commission 
on sales) may need to update their compensation policies to credit employees who persuade 
in-store shoppers to purchase from the retailer’s Web site as more consumers engage in cross-
channel shopping and in-store showrooming. For example, salespeople at Home Depot stores 
have an incentive to help customers learn how to use the Home Depot mobile app—a mobile-
enabled sale anywhere within the ZIP code of their Home Depot store is credited to that store.
▶
▶Self-service. Self-service reduces personnel costs; however, there is less opportunity for cross-
selling (whereby customers are encouraged to buy complementary goods they may not have 
been thinking about) and some shoppers may feel service is inadequate. Self-service requires 
investments in better displays, popular brands, ample assortments, and products with clear 
labels describing their specifications and features.
▶
▶Length of employment. Generally, full-time workers who have been with a firm for an extended 
time are more productive than those who are part-time or who have worked there for a short 
time. They are often more knowledgeable, are more anxious to see the firm succeed, need less 
supervision, are popular with customers, can be promoted, and adapt to the work environment. 
The superior productivity of these workers normally far outweighs their higher compensation.

Although inventory shrinkage is a major expense for all retail-
ers, high-risk firms such as jewelry and luxury watch stores are 
particularly vulnerable. Large retail chains, especially depart-
ment stores, typically have a high-level executive in charge of 
store security. An ongoing responsibility of the head of security 
is to conduct an annual security audit. This comprises evaluat-
ing security-based hardware such as alarm systems, the use of 
deadbolt locking mechanisms, closed-circuit camera coverage, 
and window gates; electronic article surveillance device usage 
on select items (such as small goods); store signage indicating 
that the store is under 24-hour video surveillance, that no cash 
is left in the store at closing, and that the retailer will undertake 
legal action to prosecute all offenders; security guard training, 
adequacy, and placement; and salesperson training on observ-
ing and reporting suspicious persons, and properly responding 
to a robbery.
How would the job description differ for a head of security 
of a store versus an online retailer?

adjacent to a store [e.g., sidewalks] and interior (windows, walls, flooring, climate control and 
energy use, lighting, displays and signs, fixtures, and ceilings). See Figure 13-4.
The quality of store maintenance affects consumer perceptions, the life span of facilities, and 
operating costs. Consumers do not like poorly maintained stores. This means promptly replacing 
burned-out lamps and periodically repainting room surfaces. Thorough, ongoing maintenance may 
extend current facilities for a longer period before having to invest in new ones. At home centers, 
the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning equipment last an average of 15 years; display fix-
tures an average of 12 years; and interior signs an average of 7 years. Maintenance is costly.4 In 
a typical year, a home center spends $15,000 on floor maintenance alone.
Retail companies spend almost $20 billion on energy every year; however, they have the 
potential to save $3 billion of that amount through effective energy management programs. A 
typical 50,000 square foot retail building in the United States spends around $90,000 each year 
on energy. On average, a store uses 14.3 kilowatt hours of electricity per year, resulting in a cost 
of $1.47 per square foot. Cutting energy costs by just 10 percent can result in a 1.2 to 1.6 percent 
increase in profit margins. The same reduction in an average supermarket would result in a  
16 percent increase in net profit margins. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates 
that $1 in energy savings is equivalent to increasing sales by $59.5
Due to rising costs over the last 45-plus years, energy management is a major factor in retail 
operations. For firms with special needs, such as food stores, it is especially critical. To manage 
their energy resources more effectively, many retailers use a combination of short-term managerial 
practices and strategic, long-term decisions.
Shorter-term managerial actions include:
▶
▶Turning things off. Every kilowatt saved immediately increases profitability.
▶
▶Using temperature control devices. Adjust the interior temperature during nonselling hours.
▶
▶Indoor lighting upgrades. Replace fluorescent lights with LEDs or CFLs (which use only 20 
to 25 percent of the energy of older fluorescents).
▶
▶Parking lots. Use lower wattage lighting in parking lots—but security may be an issue.
▶
▶Changing HVAC filters regularly. Old filters overwork equipment and use more energy.
▶
▶Using sensor lighting. Only utilize lighting when someone is in the room.
▶
▶Using reflective paint on roof. This keeps a building cool.
▶
▶Cleaning and maintaining refrigerators. This helps machinery operate more efficiently.
Strategic longer-term decisions include:
▶
▶Structurally changing buildings. This involves such as actions as energy-efficient windows and 
using glass instead of walls for natural light (which will also reduce cooling costs).

A Checklist of 
Selected Store 
Maintenance 
Decisions
What responsibility should the retailer have for maintaining outside facilities? For instance, 
does a lease agreement make the retailer or the property owner accountable for snow 
removal in the parking lot?
Should store maintenance activities be done by the retailer’s personnel or by outside 
specialists? Will that decision diﬀer by type of facility (e.g., air-conditioning versus ﬂooring) 
and by type of service (e.g., maintenance versus repairs)?
What repairs should be classiﬁed as emergencies? How promptly should nonemergency 
repairs be made?
What should be the required frequency of store maintenance for each type of facility 
(e.g., daily vacuuming of ﬂoors versus weekly washing of exterior windows)? How often 
should special maintenance activities be done (e.g., restriping spaces in a parking lot)?
How should store maintenance vary by season and by time of day (e.g., when a store 
is open versus when it is closed)?
How long should existing facilities be utilized before acquiring new ones? What schedule 
should be followed?
What performance standards should be set for each element of store maintenance? 
Do these standards adequately balance costs against a desired level of maintenance?

PART 5  •  MANAGING A RETAIL BUSINESS
▶
▶Air conditioning/heating. Replace old systems with new energy-efficient units. Install special 
air-conditioning systems that control humidity levels in specific store areas, such as freezer 
locations. to minimize moisture condensation.
▶
▶Installing computerized systems to monitor and coordinate temperature and lighting levels. 
Some chains’ systems even allow designated personnel to adjust the temperature, lighting, 
heat, and air conditioning in multiple stores from one office.
▶
▶Insulating. Through better insulation in constructing and renovating stores, heat and cool air 
are more efficiently controlled.
▶
▶Demand-controlled ventilating. Such a system senses carbon dioxide levels, detects how 
many people are in the store, and saves energy by adjusting ventilation accordingly.
▶
▶Adding a building management system (BMS). This system automatically controls and moni-
tors building service performance and makes changes accordingly.
▶
▶Energy auditing. This entails partnering with an energy expert to assess current usage and 
implement a plan for savings.
▶
▶Installing solar panels. This involves an alternative form of energy.
▶
▶Purchasing Energy Star–approved appliances. These include energy-efficient refrigerators, 
air conditioning, vending machines, hot food cabinets, and so on.
This example shows how seriously some retailers take energy management: Lighting is a 
crucial, if seldom noticed, element in the selling atmosphere for LVMH (the parent company of 
Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Christian Dior, Donna Karan, Marc Jacobs, Bulgari, Sephora, and many 
others), which occupies nearly 11 million square feet of retail space. Seventy percent of its energy 
usage goes into stores, not factories or shipping. Optimal, directional lighting has a powerful 
visual impact that spotlights the aesthetics of luxury products. LVMH’s lighting needs are so 
complex that the firm researched the best options for hue and those least likely to damage wines, 
and then signed agreements with 20 LED lighting suppliers. After measuring the energy used by 
escalators, air conditioning, lighting, and other uses, LVMH realized that computer and digital 
display screens were devouring almost as much as what the company was saving with the utiliza-
tion of LED lightbulbs.6
Besides everyday maintenance and energy management, retailers need decision rules for 
­renovations: How often are renovations necessary? What areas require renovations more ­frequently 
than others? How extensive will renovations be at any one time? Will the retailer be open for busi-
ness as usual during renovations? How much money must be set aside in anticipation of future 
renovations? Will renovations result in higher revenues, lower operating costs, or both?
Inventory Management
Retailers use inventory management to maintain proper merchandise assortment while ensur­
ing that operations are efficient and effective. See Figure 13-5. Channel boundaries are blurring 
for shoppers; they are demanding cross-channel service options such as ordering online with 
in-store pick-up, personalization of products, endless assortments and inventory, and no-cost 
returns across all channels. Most online-only retailers have optimized the location and number of 
distribution centers to be able to offer free 3-day delivery; however, many national retailers can 
leverage their network of stores to offer same-day pick-up if they modernize their inventory and 
Superior energy management can have a big impact on the bot-
tom line. For example, if a store has a 5 percent profit margin, 
a 15 percent reduction in energy costs could increase its profit 
margin to 5.5 to 6 percent. However, retailers face difficult issues 
in attempting to reduce energy costs. Unlike offices and ware-
houses, stores can be open for over 90 hours per week, food 
retailers require refrigeration and freezer units, and some custom-
ers are intolerant of a store’s reducing air-conditioner thermostats 
below 72 degrees. One way to reduce energy usage on a long-
term basis is to build new stores certified by LEED (Leadership in 
Energy & Environmental Design). As compared with traditional 
construction, a LEED-certified building can result in energy and 
water bill savings by as much as 40 percent.
Why do you think that many retailers do not insist on LEED 
construction?

logistics for cross-channel visibility and transfers to prevent stockouts. The item is then likely 
to be closer to the customer so shipping from stores can be more cost-effective than single-item, 
direct-to-customer orders from distribution centers accustomed to larger orders bound for stores. 
Although the role of inventory management in merchandising is covered in Chapter 15, these are 
some operational issues to consider:
▶
▶How can the handling of merchandise from different suppliers be coordinated? In what situ-
ations is cross-docking suitable?
▶
▶Should drop shipping be employed (wherein manufacturers or wholesalers ship goods directly 
to consumers based on orders taken at a retail store or Web site)?
▶
▶How much inventory should be on the sales floor versus in a warehouse or storeroom?
▶
▶How often should inventory be moved from nonselling to selling areas of a store?
▶
▶What inventory functions can be done during nonstore hours?
▶
▶What are the trade-offs between faster supplier delivery and higher shipping costs?
▶
▶What supplier support is expected in storing merchandise or setting up displays?
▶
▶What level of in-store merchandise breakage is acceptable?
▶
▶Which items require customer delivery? When? By whom?
Store Security
Store security relates to two basic issues: personal security and merchandise security. Personal 
security is examined in this chapter. Merchandise security is covered in Chapter 15. Many 
shoppers and employees feel less safe at retail shopping locations than before. That is why 
companies such as ADT offer security support to retailers, including smaller ones (www.adt 
.com/business).
These are among the practices that retailers are utilizing to address this issue:
▶
▶Uniformed security guards provide a visible presence to reassure customers and ­employees, 
and they are a warning to potential thieves and muggers. Some shopping areas have horse-
mounted guards or guards who patrol on motorized Segway Personal Transporters. As 
one security expert noted, “Standard practice is for guards to walk the floor to provide a 
visual reminder that they are there, and report unusual behavior to superiors or to police.”7
▶
▶Undercover personnel are used to complement uniformed guards.

▶
▶Brighter lighting is used in parking lots, which are also patrolled more frequently by guards. 
These guards more often work in teams.
▶
▶TV cameras and other devices scan areas frequented by shoppers and employees.8 See  
Figure 13-6. 7-Eleven stores have an in-store cable TVs and alarm monitoring systems, 
complete with audio.
▶
▶Some shopping areas have curfews for teenagers. This is a controversial tactic.
▶
▶Access to store backroom facilities (such as storage rooms) is tightened.
▶
▶Bank deposits are made more frequently—often by armed security guards.
Insurance
Among the types of insurance that retailers buy are workers’ compensation; product liability; 
fire, accident, property (covering buildings, fixtures. and inventory); liability due to accidents 
on the premises; business interruption insurance (to cover lost earnings due to fire, floods, etc.); 
and crime (due to employees stealing cash and goods [inventory shrinkage]). Many firms also 
offer health insurance to full-time employees, but contributions to premiums differ across retail-
ers. The Affordable Care Act requires employers with 50 or more employees to offer or assist in 
purchases of health insurance for those working more than 30 hours per week. Some firms still 
provide insurance coverage to eligible part-time employees, but others—such as Walmart and 
Target—have discontinued some coverage.
Insurance decisions can have a big impact on a retailer: (1) In recent years, premiums have 
risen dramatically. (2) Several insurers have reduced the scope of their coverage; they now require 
higher deductibles or do not provide coverage on all aspects of operations (such as the professional 
liability of pharmacists). (3) There are fewer insurers servicing retailers today than a decade ago; 
this limits the choice of carrier. (4) Insurance against environmental risks (such as leaking oil 
tanks) are more important due to government rules.
To protect themselves financially, retailers have often enacted costly programs aimed at less-
ening their vulnerability to employee and customer insurance claims from unsafe conditions, as 
well as to hold down premiums. These programs include no-slip carpeting, flooring, and rubber 
entrance mats; more frequent inspection of and mopping wet floors; doing more elevator and esca-
lator checks; having regular fire drills; building more fire-resistant facilities; setting up separate 
storage areas for dangerous items; discussing safety in employee training; and keeping records 
showing proper maintenance activity.

Credit Management
Operational decisions must be made in the area of credit management—for example:
▶
▶What form of payment is acceptable? A retailer may accept cash only, cash and personal 
checks, cash and credit card(s), cash and debit cards, mobile pay, or all of these.
▶
▶Who administers the credit plan? The firm can have its own credit system and/or accept 
major credit cards (such as Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover). It may also 
work with PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Checkout for store and online payments. One 
major innovation in credit management is the availability of free mobile payment apps and 
portable readers such as Square that plug into an iPod, iTouch, iPhone, or iPad that sales staff 
or consumers can use to reduce checkout lines at the cashier terminals.9 Another possibility 
is Touch ID that uses fingerprints in instead of credit cards on selected iPhones and iPads.
▶
▶What are customer eligibility requirements for a check or credit purchase? With a check purchase, 
a photo ID might be sufficient. To open a new credit account, a customer must meet age, employ-
ment, income, and other conditions; an existing customer would be evaluated in terms of the out-
standing balance and credit limit. Credit reports can be obtained from such firms as Transunion, 
Equifax, and Experian. These firms consolidate a consumer’s credit risk using a FICO score.
▶
▶What credit terms will be used? A retailer with its own plan must determine when interest 
charges begin to accrue, the rate of interest, and minimum monthly payments.
▶
▶How are late payments or nonpayments to be handled? Some retailers with their own credit 
plans rely on outside collection agencies to follow up on past-due accounts.
The retailer must weigh the ability of credit to increase revenues against the costs of pro-
cessing payments—screening, transaction, and collection costs, as well as bad debts. If a retailer 
completes credit functions itself, it incurs these costs; if outside parties (such as Visa) are used, 
the retailer covers the costs by its fees to the credit organization.
In the United States, there are 185 million credit-card holders. Total retail use of credit and 
debit cards exceeds $2 trillion. According to U.S. data from CardWeb.com, the average person 
has three bank-issued cards, four retail credit cards, and one debit card. Based on a survey by 
the American Bankers Association and Dove Consulting, payments by credit or debit card now 
account for 53 percent of purchases, versus 43 percent in 1999.
Credit-card fees paid by retailers typically range from 1.5 percent to 5.0 percent of sales for 
Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express, depending on volume and card provider.10 
There may also be transaction and monthly fees. With retailers’ own credit operations, they incur 
all the processing costs; but they also get to collect the interest on unpaid balances. Walmart and 
Sears seek to lower transaction fees by promoting consumer use of debit cards, which are less 
costly for retailers. Debit-card transactions now account for 29 percent of retail card activity versus 
17 percent in 1999 according to the Nilson Report.11
Merchants need to monitor consumer preference for various payment methods—cash, debit, 
credit, check, mobile, and so forth—across generation and income levels. A Federal Reserve study 
from the Diary of Consumer Payment Choice found that the largest share of consumer transaction 
activity is payment by cash (40 percent), debit-card transactions (29 percent), and credit-card 
transactions at 17 percent.12 Paper checks have become an antiquated form of payment. Younger 
consumers and seniors prefer cash or debit cards. 
As just noted, many retailers—of all types—now place great emphasis on a debit-card 
system, whereby the purchase price is immediately deducted from a consumer’s bank account 
and entered into a retailer’s account by a computer terminal. The retailer’s risk of nonpayment is 
eliminated, and costs are reduced with debit rather than credit transactions. The pre-paid gift card, 
a form of debit card, is also popular. For traditional credit cards, monthly billing is employed; with 
debit cards, monetary account transfers are made at the time of purchase. There is some resistance 
to debit transactions by those who like the delayed-payment benefit of conventional credit cards.
As the payment landscape evolves, new operational issues must be addressed:
▶
▶Retailers have more payment options. Online retailers offer many payment choices.13 At store-
based retailers, training cashiers is more complex due to all the payment formats, such as cash, 
third-party and retailer credit and debit cards, personal checks, gift cards, and more. Mobile 
payment systems introduce more complexity into the process.

PART 5  •  MANAGING A RETAIL BUSINESS
▶
▶Visa and MasterCard have settled a lawsuit requiring retailers to accept both credit and debit 
cards, and charging higher interchange fees from retailers for debit cards.
▶
▶Nonstore retailers have less legal protection against credit-card fraud than store retailers that 
secure written authorization. By law, U.S. store retailers were required to update their POS 
terminals to accept chip-based credit and debit cards by October 1, 2015, or risk assuming 
liability for counterfeit cards and lost-and-stolen point-of-sale data.14
▶
▶Credit-card transactions on the Web must instantly take into account different sales tax rates 
and currencies (for global sales).
Technology and Computerization
CUSTOMER-FACING TECHNOLOGIES  Large and small retailers can use a computerized checkout 
to efficiently process transactions and monitor inventory. These UPC-based scanning ­systems 
and computerized registers instantly record and display sales, provide detailed receipts, and 
retain inventory data. They lower costs by shortening transaction time, employee training, mis-
rings, and the need for item pricing. Retailers also have better inventory control, reduced spoilage, 
and improved ordering. They get item-by-item data, which aid in determining store layout and 
­merchandise plans, shelf space, and inventory replenishment.
Recent technological developments include wireless scanners that let workers scan heavy 
items without lifting them, radio frequency identification tags (RFID) that emit a radio frequency 
code when placed near a receiver (which is faster than UPC codes and better for harsh climates), 
speech recognition (that can tally an order on the basis of a clerk’s verbal command), and portable 
card readers. See Figure 13-7.
Retailers face two potential problems with computerized checkouts. First, UPC-based ­systems 
do not reach peak efficiency unless all suppliers attach UPC labels to merchandise; otherwise, 
retailers incur labeling costs. Second, because UPC symbols are unreadable by humans, some 
states have laws that require price labeling on individual items. This lessens the labor savings of 
posting only shelf prices.
Many retailers have upgraded to an electronic point-of-sale system, which performs all the 
tasks of a computerized checkout and verifies check and charge transactions, provides instantaneous 
sales reports, monitors and changes prices, sends intra- and inter-store messages, evaluates personnel 
and profitability, and stores data. A point-of-sale system is often used along with a retail information 
system. Point-of-sale terminals can stand alone or be integrated with an in-store or a headquarters 
computer. As noted in Chapter 2, another scanning option with retailer interest is self-scanning, 
whereby the consumer himself or herself scans items being purchased at a checkout counter , uses 
a portable retailer-provided barcode scanner (e.g., for gift registry), or uses the retailer’s mobile app 
Retail scanning equipment 
comes in a wide variety of 
models and price ranges 
(www.barcodediscount

on a smartphone, and then pays by credit or debit card, and bags items. A potential problem with 
self-scanning involves the possibility for consumer theft by their leaving more expensive items in 
the shopping cart and scanning lower-priced items, or scanning items with the barcode covered by 
one’s hand. Store personnel need to be alert to these and other consumer actions.15 
Retailers are increasingly using telecommunications to aid operations via low-cost, secure, 
in-store transmissions. Retailers use beacon-based technology and applications to push targeted 
geo-tagged and time-sensitive notifications and promotions to mobile phones of customers in 
malls to encourage store visits and purchases. Many stores offer free Wi-Fi so customers may 
scan a barcode for checkout or to check inventory at a nearby location or retailer Web site when 
the item they are looking for is not in stock. Target’s Cartwheel app allows customers to locate 
and page the nearest sales associate for help.
SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGIES  Depending on a retailer’s market size and 
­geography, omnichannel fulfillment can a daunting operation, particularly when customers (not 
the retailer) decide where and how they would like to receive their purchases among the options 
offered by the retailer. See Figure 13-8. Sometimes, a linear, pallet-based supply chain (­customarily 
used for large orders bound for stores) can no longer be restricted to a distribution center. Sales 
associates and store cashiers need authority to send single-line, multiple-category, direct-to-­
consumer orders from demand-driven supply chains that provide store-shelf collaboration with 
store backrooms, distribution centers, and a supplier network. When using Amazon’s DRS tech-
nology, customers can click Dash tags to order from various manufacturers and specialty retail 
partners with a simple button.16
Leading store-centric omnichannel retailers such as Lowes recognize the importance of 
demand-driven supply chains that increase product availability and inventory turnover while reduc-
ing cash-to-cash cycle times and costs to serve.17 The focus is on meeting individual ­consumer 
demand across channels and on collaborating with suppliers to meet that demand cost effectively.
Cloud (or SaaS) inventory control and order-tracking services that enhance visibility in sup-
ply chains are making real-time product fulfillment possible for small and mid-sized retailers. For 
example, ADC’s InterScale Scales Manager is a fully integrated software application that man-
ages produce and fresh foods in supermarkets and convenience stores. The application identifies 
the true cost of goods sold and provides hourly forecasts and production plans in real time, thus 
reducing waste. It can accurately forecast demand for bakery and deli items, hot foods, seafood, 
produce, dairy, meat, frozen food, floral items, and more.18
CAM Commerce Solutions 
(www.camcommerce.com) 
offers very inexpensive 
operations software to small 
retailers in the hope that as 
these retailers grow, they 
will upgrade to advanced 
software.

PART 5  •  MANAGING A RETAIL BUSINESS
Retailers such as Home Depot, Walmart, and J. C. Penney use videoconferencing. This lets 
them link store employees with central headquarters, as well as interact with vendors. Video-
conferencing can be done via satellite technology and by computer (with special hardware and 
software). Audio/video communications can be used to train workers, spread news, stimulate 
worker morale, and so on. Polycom, with its SpectraLink product line, is one of the firms mar-
keting lightweight phones so workers can talk to each other anywhere in a store. Polycom 
clients have included Barnes & Noble, Giant Food, Ikea, Kmart, Neiman Marcus, Rite Aid, and 
Toys “R” Us.
Outsourcing
More retailers have turned to outsourcing for some of the operating tasks they previously per-
formed themselves. With outsourcing, a retailer pays an outside party to undertake one or more of 
its operating functions. The goals are to reduce the costs and employee time devoted to ­particular 
tasks. For example, Limited Brands uses outside firms to oversee its energy use and facilities 
maintenance. Crate & Barrel outsources the management of its E-mail programs. Apple Stores, 
Payless Shoes, and Sports Chalet outsource their information technology services. Kmart uses 
logistics firms to consolidate small shipments and to process returned merchandise; it also out-
sources electronic data interchange tasks. Home Depot outsources most trucking operations. 
Retailers also outsource Web design, product delivery, processing of foreign currency transac-
tions, and completion of tariff paperwork to specialized service providers.
Outsourcing delivers operational competences and the ability to quickly respond to customer 
needs. To combat low margins and commoditization, high-performance retailers leverage out-
sourcing to increase operational effectiveness and lower costs. Outsourcing can range from IT 
infrastructure to business process applications. Many firms see outsourcing as a phased process, 
beginning with infrastructure and ending with business processes managed by a third party. The 
outsourcer can bring industrywide experience, along with specialist knowledge. Economies of 
scale drive down unit costs, as do shared resources. Unpredictable capital costs are replaced with 
variable operational costs.19
Crisis Management
Despite the best intentions, retailers may sometimes be faced with crisis situations that need 
to be managed as smoothly as feasible. Consumer responses to crises depend on the “locus of 
­control”—whether they perceive the causes to be within or outside of the retailer’s control.
Examples of crises brought on by factors outside a retailer’s control include a storm that 
knocks out store power, unexpectedly high or low consumer demand for a good or service, a bur-
glary, a sudden illness of the owner or a key employee, a sudden increase in a supplier’s prices, 
or a natural disaster such as a flood or an earthquake. These can be addressed by good marketing 
communications. However, crises perceived to be within a retailer’s control—such as an in-store 
fire or broken water pipe (poor maintenance), access to a store being partially blocked due to 
picketing by striking workers (poor employee relations), a car accident in the retailer’s parking 
lot, or an in-store data breach compromising customer credit data—can lead to legal and financial 
penalties, undermine consumer trust, and damage a retailer’s image.

Responsibility Report that describes its goals and its accomplish-
ments relative to each goal. Among its recent goals were to 
increase organic food offerings, use more sustainable packaging 
on its private-label packages, increase Energy Star certifications 
in buildings, reduce waste via recycling, lessen greenhouse gas 
emissions, and improve transportation efficiencies (both inbound 
and outbound).

CHAPTER 13  •  Operations Management: Operational Dimensions	
347	
Although many crises can be anticipated, and some adverse effects may occur regardless of 
retailer efforts, these principles are important:
1.	 There should be contingency plans for as many different types of crisis situations as possible. 
That is why retailers buy insurance, install backup generators, and prepare management 
succession plans. A firm can have a checklist to follow if there is an incident such as a store 
fire or a parking-lot accident.
2.	 A clear chain of command for decision making and external communications must be estab-
lished and updated.
3.	 Essential information should be communicated to all affected parties, such as the fire or 
police department, employees, customers, and the media, as soon as a crisis occurs.
4.	 Cooperation—not conflict—among the involved parties is essential.
5.	 Responses should be as swift as feasible; indecisiveness may worsen the situation.
6.	 The firm needs to assess the need for appropriate insurance.
Crisis management is a key task for both small and large retailers. Hence, a thorough con-
tingency plan for responding to a multitude of potential events can mitigate the reputational and 
financial risks of a crisis.20

Chapter Summary
1.	 To describe the important role of operations manage-
ment as a source of competitive advantage in the ­rapidly 
evolving omnichannel retail industry. Operations man-
agement efficiently and effectively seeks to enact the 
policies needed to satisfy customers, employees, and 
management. In contrast to Chapter 12, which dealt with 
financial aspects, Chapter 13 covered operational facets.
2.	 To examine several specific aspects of operating a retail 
business. An operations blueprint systematically lists all 
operating functions, their characteristics, and their timing, 
as well as the responsibility for performing the functions.
Store format and size considerations include use 
of prototype stores and store dimensions. Firms often 
use prototype stores in conjunction with rationalized 
retailing. Some retailers emphasize category-killer 
stores; others open smaller stores. In space allocation, 
retailers deploy a top-down or a bottom-up approach. 
They want to optimize the productivity of store space.
Personnel utilization activities that improve produc-
tivity range from better screening applicants to workload 
forecasts to job standardization and cross-training. Job 
standardization routinizes the tasks of people with simi-
lar positions in different departments. In cross-training, 
people learn tasks associated with more than one job. A 
firm can advance its personnel flexibility and minimize 
the total number of workers needed at any given time by 
these techniques.
Store maintenance includes all activities in managing 
physical facilities. It influences people’s perceptions of 
the retailer, the life span of facilities, and operating costs. 
Managerial actions and strategic planning are needed 
to control energy resources. Besides daily facilities 
management, retailers need decision rules about fre-
quency and manner of store renovations.
Good inventory management requires that retailers 
acquire and maintain the proper merchandise while 
ensuring efficient and effective operations. This encom-
passes everything from coordinating different supplier 
shipments to planning customer deliveries (if needed).
Store security measures protect both personal and mer-
chandise safety. Retailers need to budget adequate resources 
for workers’ compensation, product liability, fire, accident, 
property, officers’ liability, and employee health insurance.
Most U.S. adults use credit cards. Check and credit 
payments generally mean larger transactions than 
cash  payments. One-third of retail transactions are 
in cash, one-sixth by check, and one-half by credit or 
debit card. Retailers pay various fees to be able to offer 
noncash payment options to customers, and there is a 
wide range of payment systems available for retailers.
A growing number of retailers have computerized 
elements of operations. Computerized checkouts and 
electronic point-of-sale systems are quite useful. Self-
scanning is gaining in popularity. Videoconferencing and 
mobile and wireless in-store telephone communications 
play a critical role in enhancing shopping experience. 
With outsourcing, retailers pay another party to han-
dle one or more operating functions. The goals are to 
reduce costs and better utilize employees’ time.
Crisis management must handle unexpected situa-
tions as smoothly as possible. There should be contin-
gency plans, information should be communicated to 
those affected, all parties should cooperate, responses 
should be swift, and the chain of command for deci-
sions should be clear.

Case 4: Retail Shrinkage: A Significant Problem *
A total of 100 retailers participated in the National Retail Federa-
tion’s 2015 “National Retail Security Survey,” representing more 
than 20 retail market categories. The largest sample (24 percent) 
came from retailers seeing $1 billion to $2.49 billion in sales.
“For some time we’ve been looking to compare where the 
shrinkage is coming from, and for the most part the highest 
amount has been internal theft,” Richard Hollinger (the study’s 
co-author) says. “For the first time, we’re actually seeing shop-
lifting exceed the internal numbers.” The efforts to combat 
shrinkage are substantial. Retailers use loss prevention systems 
“almost universally,” but loss prevention budgets represented 
less than 1 percent of overall sales. Specialty apparel retailers 
spent an average of 0.63 percent of sales on loss prevention 
measures; grocery stores used 0.36 percent.
Almost all respondents are pursuing efforts to cut down 
on high-risk employees. Some 89 percent said they’re con-
ducting criminal conviction checks, 86 percent conduct mul-
tiple interviews, and 73 percent verify employment history. 
Men’s and women’s specialty apparel stores and supermar-
kets are pre-employment screening leaders, with 92 percent 
checking criminal convictions and 83 percent verifying past 
employment. Grocery stores and supermarkets reported 100 
percent criminal background checks, with 83 percent test for 
drugs.
Training plays an important role, as do hotlines and incen-
tives. Of those surveyed, 95 percent have an anonymous hot-
line and 88 percent use awareness posters; more than one-half 
offer a variety of training programs and notification systems. 
The leading program continues to be videos (72 percent), but

Magazine (August 2015), pp. 66, 68. Reprinted by permission. Copyright 
2016. STORES Magazine.
more than 55 percent use Internet-based systems and 54 per-
cent offer “honesty incentives.” Employee incentives offer 
great value to loss-prevention strategies, but retailers still must 
prove theft.
All respondents use burglar alarms and 93 percent use digi-
tal video recorders; 66 percent use live hidden closed-circuit 
television. More than 69 percent use point-of-sale data min-
ing to help losses at the till. In-store deterrence—plain-clothes 
detectives (41 percent), receipt checkers (38 percent), and 
signage (36 percent)—are also gaining traction. One-third of 
department stores use acousto-magnetic electronic security 
tags, but all men’s and women’s specialty apparel stores and 
sporting goods retailers use them.
Hollinger believes the best programs are a combination of 
human resources and technology. “We’ve been seeing this for 
years: Hire the best people, train them as well as you can by 
making them aware of the impact of shrinkage, control your 
merchandise to make sure you know where it is and where it’s 
going, and develop a range of technologies to apprehend those 
who are stealing from you,” he says.
In human resources, loss-prevention staff can make a 
budget work and are leaders in diversity. One in four loss-­
prevention managers are women, slightly higher than the 
national trend that sees 22 percent of senior leadership roles 
filled by women. Almost 10 percent of loss-prevention manag-
ers are Hispanic.
The war against Organized Retail Crime (ORC) transcends 
the retail industry and is a national issue. Major cities from 
Minnesota to Utah are forming their own retail crime alliances. 
“The way we should be tackling crime as a whole is by making 
sure we come at it from an organized crime perspective,” St. 
Paul Police Sergeant Charlie Anderson said after formation of 
the Twin Cities Organized Retail Crime Association.
Even with growth in regional and federal assistance, retail-
ers have a responsibility to protect their merchandise and catch 
those who steal. What will loss prevention look like in 2020? “A 
major thing that we’re going to see is a continuing emphasis on 
technology,” Hollinger says. “There’s a continued emphasis on 
trying to find better technologies to monitor and catch shoplift-
ers and employed thieves.”
Questions
1.	 What is the proper mix of humans and technology in pre-
venting shrinkage losses?
2.	 How would a small retailer’s theft avoidance strategy differ 
from that of a large strategy? Why?
3.	 Develop an operations blueprint (see Figure 13-1 for an 
example) to reduce retail theft.

PART 5  •  MANAGING A RETAIL BUSINESS
Although some debate the popularity of subscription ser-
vices, they continue to pop up—promising to simplify every-
thing from the delivery of dinner to razors.
Same-day delivery was expected to move closer to critical 
mass in 2016 as more companies emerged to serve an increas-
ing number of markets. For omnichannel retailers such as 
Macy’s, same-day delivery was considered an important part 
of the value proposition.
Drones and 3D printing are topics du jour in retail circles, 
but were expected to continue to garner more talk than traction 
in 2016. Neither should be overlooked for the simple reason that 
both play to the desire for speed and convenience—two things 
that many consumers consider essential.
Personalization Is Mission-Critical
We live in the Age of the Consumer. Retailers need to explore 
every opportunity to raise the level and quality of contextual, 
personalized experiences. Investments in customer analytics are 
imperative, as is an understanding of where to apply personal-
ization to deliver the biggest bang for the buck.
Shoppers expect tailored offerings, including their savings, 
merchandise, and service transactions. And personalization 
needs to be a consistent omnichannel effort. If retailers can’t 
identify a shopper across various points of interaction, they’re 
on thin ice.
Meanwhile, look for new “disruptors” to play the person-
alization card with aplomb. Stitch Fix is a prime example: By 
blending art, science, and a human touch, the personal stylist 
company projected $200 million in revenue for 2016.
A Digital Core Is Essential
Today’s consumers are firmly in control; they choose how they 
will interact with the various retailers. And although we’d like to 
believe that shoppers can be forgiving, they’re not. Responding 
to these instant gratification customers requires a digital pulse 
to sense and respond to their changing needs, and a digital pulse 
requires a digital core.
A digital core gives companies real-time visibility into 
all mission-critical business practices and processes around 
customers, suppliers, work force, big data, and the Internet of 
Things (IoT). It allows retail businesses to react in an agile and 
hyperaware fashion and enables them to predict, simulate, plan, 
and even anticipate future outcomes.
Experts report that only 37 percent of retailers currently 
have a strategy to create a 360-degree customer view. By 2020 
(if not sooner), all retail store sales will be influenced by digital 
data. Retailers need a digital core to understand all the data that 
move in and out of the company.
Music versus Noise
Big data represent a $33 billion industry; and this is growing 
rapidly. Nine out of 10 retailers believe that big data are essen-
tial to their business operations. Still, it’s how companies distill 
Predicting Retail Trends *
Introduction
Some predictions are a slam dunk. Retail will continue to be 
driven by technology. Science fiction is coming to life in the 
form of robotics and virtual reality. And the Internet will soon 
be embedded everywhere. Another truism: Change is exponen-
tial in retail. Accepting that is the easy part.
Trying to predict what’s next in an industry that moves 
faster and faster—toppling norms and reimagining processes—
is the hard part. In this case are several predictions for 2016. 
Let’s see which ones turned out to be correct.
Predictions of 2016 Retailing Trends
In looking ahead to 2016, experts were asked to predict whether 
2016 would be a “sweet” year for retailers. Would a handful of 
winning ideas drive industry objectives for 2016? Or was the 
idea of trying to predict what was just ahead for the industry 
our version of December insanity?
Economists seemed to agree that indicators pointed to a 
fairly solid 2016. Confidence data were encouraging, unem-
ployment continued to dip, and there didn’t appear to be any 
significant recession risks on the horizon. Presidential elections 
affect consumer sentiment, but historically they tend to have 
little impact on spending, which boded well for retailers.
Still, uncertainties remained. Goldman Sachs’ sobering 
assessment of what was in store for 2016 boiled down to the 
phrase “flat is the new up.” The investment bank forecast 2 to 4 
percent growth and described economic recovery as “running 
in place.”
With a nod to the NCAA basketball tournament’s “Sweet 
16,” we came up with 16 predictions for the retail industry in 
2016. No doubt some would deliver ‘nothing but net’; others 
may have spun around the rim before dropping in, and a few 
may have turned out to be air balls. Still, there’s something to 
be said for making it to the final 16.
Planning for this feature began in mid-July 2015. Every 
conference session, exhibit hall meeting, and phone briefing 
became fodder for determining what may have been on the hori-
zon. A big “thank you” goes to all who shared their insight, took 
the time to teach us about new technology, or set aside a few 
minutes to share their retail vision. We simply couldn’t have 
done it without you.
Convenience, Expedience the Fast Track to Shoppers’ 
Hearts
With consumers able to summon a car ride with a few taps 
on a smartphone, the expectation that everything should be 
simple and frictionless is growing. Companies that save 
shoppers time, simplify routine tasks, and remove friction 
are capitalizing: Think Uber, Apple Pay, lnstacart, and Ama-
zon Prime.

Comprehensive Case
PART 5

	
PART 5  •  COMPREHENSIVE CASE	
353	
Although not every payment innovation was expected to 
catch on, 2016 would find those consumers and retailers willing 
to wade through a sea of change. Biometrics such as finger-
print systems, facial recognition, and iris scanning are being 
introduced. Technology consulting firm Frost & Sullivan fore-
cast that nearly half a billion people will be using smartphones 
equipped with biometric technology by 2017. MasterCard 
announced a program in October 2015 that would enable com-
panies to add credit-card credentials to personal devices such 
as key fobs and smart rings.
Don’t discount the possibilities of RFID (Radio Fre-
quency Identification). The reality of paying by walking under 
an RFID-enabled archway is closer than ever. And resist the 
temptation to dismiss Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies: They 
continue to drive home the message that the next generation 
thinks rather differently about money.
Say “Hi” to “Buy” Buttons on Social Sites
Social networks have moved way beyond their origins. Face-
book, Pinterest, and others have all introduced Buy Buttons, but 
that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Expect fringe platforms such as 
Snapchat, Instagram, and Medium—maybe even Periscope—to 
be nipping at their heels. [Authors’ note: In mid-2016, Twitter 
decided to pull the plug on its Buy Button efforts. This was 
less than a year after Twitter had announced its program with 
great fanfare.]
Having Buy Buttons on some of the fastest-growing social 
networks means shoppers who are interested in Buy Buttons 
will no longer have to ask where to buy. And when retailers take 
away the friction of shopping, customers click to buy.
Even if you’re not ready to leap into social shopping, 
don’t overlook the power of these networks for marketing; lns-
tagram’s advertising revenue from direct viewer shopping was 
expected to exceed $1 billion in 2016.
Partnerships Will Thrive
Gone are the days when retailers kept all their cards close to 
their vest. Partnerships are now the new secret weapon for those 
committed to delivering on the promise of today’s on-demand 
economy.
Walgreens, Target, Walmart, Costco, and 7-Eleven have 
been working with such delivery startups as lnstacart, Door-
dash, and Postmates. Deliv, which billed itself as the bridge to 
the last-mile gap between retailers and their customers, secured 
a retailer roster that already includes Macy’s, Neiman Marcus, 
and Williams-Sonoma.
On the other hand, some experts looked for retailer/
designer collaborations to cool in year 2016 as more shoppers 
grew tired of this once-loved differentiation strategy, and more 
weary of the prevailing inventory management issues. In 2015, 
there was H&M with Balmain, Kohl’s with Thakoon, and Tar-
get introducing Adam Lippes. All are top designers best known 
by just the 1 percent of shoppers who can actually afford their 
collections, not the masses who crave a designer label their 
friends will covet.
Year of the Mobile-Equipped Associate
Providing better customer service and generating more inter-
action with their shoppers can lead to greater retail sales. 
No longer an industry talking point, the concept of arming 
the data into meaningful insights that defines the value of the 
outcomes.
As the physical and virtual retail worlds more fully mesh, 
the challenge for retail companies will be to derive meaning from 
the intersection of multiple sources of data: stores, E-­commerce, 
mobile, social, in-store sensors, and/or wearables. Connect-
ing these data to deliver better customer service, improve the 
­in-store experience, or design a more-engaging mobile app has 
become just basic table stakes.
Retailers that are truly obsessed with their customers, and 
their behavior and characteristics, will more aggressively invest 
in analytics efforts (and software), recognizing that both rev-
enue growth and enhanced customer experiences depend on 
such actions.
Voice Technology to Be Worth Talking About
Have you spoken to Siri lately? How about Alexa, Google Now, 
or Cortana? Voice recognition software is dramatically chang-
ing shopper behavior; and this will be even more true in the 
future. If you’re not listening, you risk being left out of the 
conversation.
Although solid data calculating the benefits of voice-acti-
vated search remain elusive by virtue of the so-far small sample 
size, the fact is that most consumers speak faster than they type. 
As advanced voice technology becomes more accepted by con-
sumers, retailers will need to embrace its greater popularity as 
a search and information tool. Voice-recognition applications 
are simpler and require less effort for the shopper—a winning 
formula for those consumers who have shown time and again 
that they’re willing to adopt technologies that help them sift 
through information or aid in a purchasing decision.
Generation Z to Disrupt Retail
While everyone was paying attention to Millennials, Generation 
Z has been honing their shopping chops. Fitch recently reported 
that by the year 2020 the people born in the late 1990s will 
be the largest group of shoppers worldwide, accounting for 40 
percent of the United States, Europe, and Brazil, Russia, India, 
China (known as the BRIC countries) consumer base.
This group will disrupt retailers with a new set of atti-
tudes, motivations, and behaviors. The Generation Z group is 
the most culturally diverse cohort, considered to be more self-
reliant, solution-oriented, and ambitious than Millennials. It’s 
also made up of impatient shoppers quick to dismiss companies 
that can’t immediately and easily cater to their whims.
Which retailers have the upper hand with Gen Z? None of 
them do at the moment. It’s all about who best meets their needs 
and who delivers something that is perceived to be unique—and 
how quickly the consumers can have what they want.
The Pursuit of “Frictionless” Payments
Consumers typically want payment processes to be simple, but 
delivering a seamless experience from aspiration to purchase 
requires heavy lifting by the supply chain (including retailers). 
Payment option iterations from Apple, Samsung, and Android 
have begun gaining traction, although usage has not been grow-
ing at anticipated rates. The key arbiter of what could be: 60 
percent of consumers pay with smartphones because of loyalty 
benefits (e.g., nearly 15 percent of Starbucks customers pay 
with their phones).

PART 5  •  MANAGING A RETAIL BUSINESS
front-line associates with mobile technology has reached a 
critical mass.
Tech-empowered associates often have considerable 
insight into the available inventory across all stores and distribu-
tion centers; this can save a customer sale in just seconds. With 
their devices in hand, associates have the potential to better 
understand customer preferences based on actual past purchases 
or wish lists.
With great power comes great responsibility: Thus, retail-
ers must better train their associates to be able to use and under-
stand the technology tools, and realize that different people 
shop differently. Not every customer is tech savvy; many visit 
stores for the experience.
IoT Coming on PDQ
The Internet of Things (IoT) became “a thing” in 2014 and 
it’s going to be much bigger as time goes on. The McKinsey 
Global Institute recently forecast that IoT could have a total 
economic impact of $11 trillion annually by 2025—less than a 
decade from now!
Even though much of the talk today is about the use of IoT 
in home appliances and smartphones, the technology really sets 
the stage for major big-data developments—specifically in the 
form of the improved levels of supply chain efficiency and 
inventory management. With IoT, products can communi-
cate how they are actually being used, providing considerable 
insight into customer behavior and preferences.
Although this game-changing technology offers both 
potential cost savings and productivity enhancements, hurdles 
remain. Standards are imperative; the industry must work with 
technology vendors to provide connected, interoperable com-
ponents and systems. Another significant obstacle involves 
security and privacy concerns—protecting both company and 
customer data.
Seeking the Mobile Toothbrush
Forrester Research reported that mobile technology would 
influence about $1 trillion in U.S. spending in the year 2016 
as mobile search, shopping, and social interaction becomes the 
centerpiece of customers’ “always-on” way of life. Meanwhile, 
eMarketer reported that 25 percent of all U.S. E-commerce 
sales would take place via mobile devices by the end of 2016.
According to Forrester, 4.8 billion people globally would 
be using smartphones by the end of 2016. The biggest challenge 
with this occurrence for retailers will be finding a way to effec-
tively carve out a bit of real estate on those devices. Experts 
see mobile optimization eventually rivaling the importance of 
desktop optimization.
In 2016, “deep links” to apps were projected to become 
much more prevalent. Still, the success of mobile apps comes 
down to their ease of use and the speed of purchase. If an app 
is to have real value, it will need to pass the “toothbrush test”: 
It has to prompt the consumer to use it every day.
That Shrinking Feeling
Macy’s planned to shut as many as 40 of its stores in early 2016, 
after closing several dozen over the last few years. [Authors’ 
note: In mid-2016, Macy’s announced plans to close an addi-
tional 100 stores.] Forty stores were on the chopping block at 
J. C. Penney, and Target was going to close 13 units at the end 
of January 2016. Along with these planned store closings, the 
industry will endure shrinking store counts as the office supply 
segment consolidates and Walgreens Boots Alliance swallows 
Rite Aid.
Experts point out that a leaner organization can often 
grow more profitably. Macy’s Backstage locations have begun 
to debut, Walmart’s Neighborhood Markets seem like com-
pact supercenters, and Target is expanding its small-format 
stores, rebranding CityTarget and TargetExpress stores as Tar-
get. Kohl’s plans to open between 5 and 10 smaller stores, 
as well.
One-size rarely fits all in apparel retailing. More retailers 
are realizing the same can be said of their real-estate strategy.
Soon We’ll Have AI Make the Predictions
Retailers envision using the software algorithms that define 
artificial intelligence (AI)—including pattern recognition, 
deep-learning neural networks, and computer vision—to help 
generate the major decisions that help shape consumers’ user 
experience. It can be used for product recommendations, 
dynamic pricing, and promotions, and it gets smarter over time, 
learning from the data.
While AI will become more rooted in the retail industry, 
virtual reality (VR) is also knocking on the door. The goal is to 
use VR to create more immersive, contextual experiences, cus-
tomized to highlight every brand’s assets and strengthen their 
customer relationships.
Regardless, it’s time to test and explore. Even though the 
over-40 set may look askance at virtual reality, younger shop-
pers who have been immersed in videogaming since they were 
knee-high will be more inclined to embrace this new shopping 
experience, being dubbed V-commerce.
New Cybersecurity Threats Looming
The cat-and-mouse game between retailers and cybercriminals 
shows no signs of abating. Hackers will continue to find new 
ways to attack retailers’ networks, and retailers will continue to 
do everything in their power to thwart these attempts.
Europay MasterCard and Visa chip-based credit cards will 
provide an additional line of defense against counterfeit card 
fraud, but expect a chorus of voices (including the NRF’s) to 
continue to argue that not requiring a PIN to complete a transac-
tion makes this a half-step forward at best.
Meanwhile, retailer and consumer concerns are shifting 
to other potentially unprotected opportunities for hackers. 
Merchant data warehouses, unencrypted data transmissions, 
and card-not-present transactions will be under greater 
scrutiny.
As the Internet of Things becomes more established, inno-
vators need to keep an eye on protecting the growing number of 
smart devices. Wider adoption translates into stronger interest 
on the part of criminals looking to steal personal data captured 
by these devices.
The Rise of the Data Scientist
Success in 2016 was expected to boil down to smarter, more 
data-driven decision making. Intuition-based decisions will 
always play a role in retail, but true insight comes from 

	
PART 5  •  COMPREHENSIVE CASE

combining different data sets—points of sale, weather reports, 
web traffic, competitors’ pricing data, and even sensors.
Every merchant and marketer needs to be in sync with 
the ever-connected customer, and they’re challenged to go 
above and beyond brand promises. That requires a continued 
emphasis on breaking down organizational silos and connect-
ing data across and within the retail organization. Consider that 
the entire Uber experience is predicated on data science and 
algorithms—a high bar, indeed.
It’s been said that understanding data science helps mer-
chants speak a language that contributes to the bottom line 
from day 1. Although it’s a huge opportunity, a considerable 
conundrum remains: There is a dearth of data scientists today 
and those retailers looking to tap into this expertise are finding 
that moving from aspiration to action is a longer process than 
anticipated.

In Part Six, we present the merchandise management and pricing aspects 
of the retail strategy mix. Merchandise management consists of the buying, handling, 
and financial aspects of merchandising. Pricing decisions deal with the financial aspects of 
merchandise management and affect their interaction with other retailing elements.
Chapter 14 covers the development of merchandise plans. We begin by discussing the 
concept of a merchandising philosophy. We then look at buying organizations and their 
processes, as well as the major considerations in formulating merchandise plans. The chapter 
concludes by describing category management and merchandising software.
Chapter 15 focuses on implementing merchandise plans. We study each stage in the buying 
and handling process: gathering information, selecting and interacting with merchandise 
sources, evaluation, negotiation, concluding purchases, receiving and stocking merchandise, 
reordering, and re-evaluation. We also examine logistics and inventory management, as well as 
their effects on merchandising.
Chapter 16 concentrates on financial merchandise management. We introduce the cost 
and retail methods of accounting. The merchandise forecasting and budgeting process is also 
presented, as well as the unit control systems. The chapter concludes with the integration of 
dollar and unit financial inventory controls.
Chapter 17 deals with pricing. We review the outside factors affecting price decisions: 
consumers, government, suppliers, and competitors. A framework for developing a price 
strategy is then presented, including objectives, broad policy, basic strategy, implementation, 
and adjustments.

Objectives
1. To demonstrate 
the importance of a

The basis of Chapter 14 is that merchandising plans and decisions must reflect target market 
desires, the retailer’s intended marketplace positioning, and more. Utilized actively as a 
merchandising tool, the Internet can help retailers be better merchandisers and reach out in a 
dynamic way to their customers.
Amazon’s Dash button is a device resembling a thumb drive that facilitates reordering 
frequently purchased consumables such as detergents and toilet paper. Consumers can put 
this wireless device near a washing machine or kitchen cabinet. Reordering is as simple as 
pressing a Dash button.
There are a number of positive elements of this strategy for consumers, Amazon, and 
manufacturers. Consumers can easily reorder goods and avoid carrying them from a local 
store. Since Dash is available only to Amazon Prime members, it serves as an incentive for

consumers to sign on to Prime. Companies pay Amazon $15 for each button deployed, as well 
as a 15 percent commission (above Amazon’s traditional markup). Manufacturers of consumer 
goods generate additional sales due to the ease of shopping and the convenience of delivery. 
Despite its advantages, however, one study found that many consumers who purchase a Dash 
button use it just once every two months.1
Overview
Retailers must have the proper product assortments and sell them in a manner consistent with their 
overall strategy. Merchandising consists of the activities involved in acquiring particular goods 
and/or services and making them available at the places, times, and prices and in the quantity that 
enable a retailer to reach its goals. Merchandising decisions can dramatically affect performance. 
Consider these observations—from two different perspectives:
▶
▶The biggest competitive advantages of an independent retailer is its ability to focus on and 
adapt to consumer needs—thus, offering superior expertise and a high level of customer ser-
vice. In contrast, the big-box retailer is better at cutting costs and thereby offering lower prices 
(sometimes, extremely low prices) for shoppers. By virtue of their size, independent retailers 
can be nimble enough and have better insights to offer high-quality, specialty products that 
attract target customers who value quality, service, and a relaxed, friendly experience rather 
than just low prices. This can insulate a small retailer from price competition and lead to higher 
initial markups—which can make up for low volumes.2
▶
▶Department stores have typically appealed to consumers with broad product assortments 
based on demographics in their trading areas and relied on apparel as the traffic generator 
for their stores. Today, however, department stores are facing significant challenges due to 
declines in spending on apparel as a proportion of discretionary spending and consumers 
migrating to E-commerce and off-price retailers. Department store chains are retooling by 
enhancing their E-commerce offerings, introducing their own off-price brands and smaller 
store formats, and repositioning the store as a destination with experiential services—using 
social media and viral marketing tools to build a more loyal customer base. Specialty stores 
and smaller independent stores, such as Hot Topic and Torrid, that attract alternative shop-
pers are growing and increasingly becoming attractive to mall owners as tenants to replace 
traditional mall anchor tenants.3
In this chapter, the planning aspects of merchandising are discussed. The implementation 
aspects of merchandising are examined in Chapter 15. The financial aspects of merchandising are 
described in Chapter 16. And retail pricing is covered in Chapter 17. Visit our blog site (www 
.bermanevansretail.com) for a broad selection of posts related to merchandising strategies and tactics.
MERCHANDISING PHILOSOPHY
A merchandising philosophy sets the guiding principles for all the merchandise decisions that a 
retailer makes. This encompasses every product decision, from what product lines to carry, to the 
shelf space allotted, to different products, to inventory turnover, to pricing. A retail merchandising 
philosophy can be product-based (using SKU proliferation data to find the most profitable prod-
ucts) and/or consumer-focused (tailoring assortments and merchandising plans to cater to the most 
profitable customers). Product-focused merchandising involves analyzing SKU-level sales per-
formance and profitability metrics to find and invest in the most profitable products based on store 
size, volume, and sell-through for each category. Consumer-focused merchandising involves creat-
ing product assortments based on customer insights, their preferences, and their path to purchase 
based on an analysis of loyalty data, social network signals, shopping patterns, and other potential 
“big data” sources.
Astute retailers use customer segmentation data to identify the segments that are more profit-
able and have a higher lifetime value than others, and to invest in product assortments that reflect 
target market desires, the retailer’s institutional type, marketplace positioning, the defined value 
chain, supplier capabilities, costs, competitors, product trends, and other factors. A merchandise 
plan must specify desired objectives in terms of revenue, gross profit, and inventory turnover in 
percentages and dollars by product groups.4 See Figure 14-1.

Part 6  •  Merchandise Management and Pricing
Costco, the membership club giant, flourishes with its individualistic merchandising phi-
losophy, whereby it offers members very low prices on a limited selection, but broad assortment, 
of national and private brands. Costco’s approach yields high sales revenue through quick inven-
tory turnover. Furthermore, volume purchasing and efficient distribution through depots or ware-
houses (which reduces the handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities) 
stimulate profitable operations at significantly lower gross margins than most other traditional 
wholesalers, mass merchandisers, supermarkets, and supercenters. Costco carries an average of 
approximately 3,700 active stock-keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse, significantly less than 
other retailers. It limits specific items in each product line to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors 
and sells many consumable products in case, carton, and multiple-pack quantities only.5
In forming a merchandising philosophy, the scope of responsibility for merchandise 
­personnel must be stated. Are these personnel involved with the full array of merchandising 
functions, both buying and selling goods and services (including selection, pricing, display, 
and customer transactions)? Or do they focus on the buying function, with others responsible 
for displays, personal selling, and so on? Many firms consider merchandising as the founda-
tion for their success, and buyers (or merchandise managers) engage in both buying and selling 
tasks. Other retailers consider buyers to be skilled specialists who should not be active in the 
selling function, which is done by other skilled specialists. Store managers at full-line discount 
stores often have great influence on product displays but have little impact on whether to stock 
or promote particular brands.
With a merchandising-oriented philosophy, the buyer’s expertise is used in selling, and his 
or her responsibility and authority are clear. The buyer ensures that items are properly displayed 
and that costs are reduced (fewer specialists). He or she is close to consumers due to selling 
involvement. When buying and selling are separate, specialized skills are applied to each task, the 
morale of store personnel goes up as they get more authority, selling is not viewed as a secondary 
task, salesperson–customer interaction is better, and buying and selling personnel are distinctly 
supervised. Each firm must see which format is best for it.
To capitalize on opportunities, more retailers now use micromerchandising and cross-mer-
chandising. With micromerchandising, a retailer adjusts shelf-space allocations to respond to 
customer and other differences among local markets. Dominick’s supermarkets assign shelf space 
to children’s and adult’s cereals to reflect demand patterns at different stores. Walmart allots 
space to product lines at various stores to reflect differences in demographics, weather, and shop-
ping. Micromerchandising is easier today due to the data generated. Tilly’s, a California-based 
specialty retailer of West Coast–inspired lifestyle apparel and accessories, enhances its micromer-
chandising strategy by leveraging customer data from stores, Web site browsing, and transactions, 
mobile apps, catalogs, and third-party data. This enables the retailer to monitor, identify, and 
address customer trends. Individual store profiles for every store in the portfolio are compiled 
to highlight the differences in brand performance, gender, and customer interests. By selecting

relevant third-party and proprietary brands, styles, colors, sizes, and price points based on profiles, 
and then shipping products to its stores multiple times per week, Tilly’s is able to dynamically 
adapt its merchandise allocation strategies to capitalize on individual store differences.6
In cross-merchandising, a retailer carries complementary goods and services to encourage 
shoppers to buy more. That is why apparel stores stock accessories and auto dealers offer extended 
warranties. Cross-merchandising, like scrambled merchandising, can be ineffective if taken too 
far. Yet, it has tremendous potential. Consider this from the perspective of pharmacies, which use 
cross-merchandising to increase revenues by making it easy for consumers to buy complementary 
items during the cold and flu season. Placing items such as cough drops, tissues, and medications 
close together in an aisle not only helps consumers easily find these items if they come in for one 
of them but it also generates in-store (impulse) purchases. Similarly, customers coming to a liquor 
store to buy spirits are more apt to also buy crackers, cheese, and/or glassware if placed together.7 
Cross-merchandising leverages customer preferences for one-stop shopping and the tendency to 
make impulse purchases—and increases the retailer’s overall revenues. The impact of seasonality 
and competition on revenues is reduced.
BUYING ORGANIZATION FORMATS AND PROCESSES
A merchandising plan cannot be properly devised unless the buying organization and its processes 
are well defined: Who is responsible for decisions? What are their tasks? Do they have sufficient 
authority? How does merchandising fit with overall operations? Figure 14-2 highlights the range 
of organizational attributes from which to choose.
Level of Formality
With a formal buying organization, merchandising (buying) is a distinct retail task and requires 
the setup of a separate department. The functions involved in acquiring merchandise and making 
it available for sale are under the control of this department. A formal organization is most often 
used by larger firms and involves distinct personnel. In an informal buying organization, merchan-
dising (buying) is not a distinct task. The same personnel handle both merchandising (buying) 
and other retail tasks; responsibility and authority are not always clear-cut. Informal organizations 
generally occur in smaller retailers.
Advantages of a formal organization are clarity of responsibilities and use of full-time, spe-
cialized merchandisers. The disadvantage is the cost of a separate department. Advantages of an 
informal format are low costs and flexibility. Disadvantages are less-defined responsibilities and 
less emphasis on merchandise planning. Both structures exist in great numbers. It is not critical 
for a firm to use a formal department, but it is crucial that it recognizes the role of merchandising 
(buying) and ensures that responsibility, activities, and operational relationships are defined and 
enacted.
Degree of Centralization
Chain retailers must choose whether to have a centralized buying organization or a decentral-
ized one. In a centralized buying organization, all purchase decisions emanate from one office. 
A chain may have eight stores, with merchandise decisions made at the headquarters store. In a 
ConceptDraw (www.conceptdraw.com), Symphony Gold (www 
.eyc.com), and SmartDraw (www.smartdraw.com) are examples 
of store planning software. Used by store designers, architects, 
and interior designers, the applications enable these design 
professionals to preview and assess alternate store layouts and 
designs in terms of optimal space utilization, visual impact, and 
cost considerations. The applications can also be applied to 
shelf display planograms. ConceptDraw includes templates for 
specific retailers. Its café and restaurant templates contain close 
to 300 objects (such as corner benches, square four-seat tables, 
a hostess podium, and even a salad bar) as well as templates for 
the kitchen area (such as food coolers and ranges with grills). 
­Designers can easily rearrange the elements in these templates, 
as well as substitute different objects.
Discuss specific criteria to assess different store planning 
­software packages.

Part 6  •  Merchandise Management and Pricing
decentralized buying organization, purchase decisions are made locally or regionally. A 40-store 
chain may let each outlet select its own merchandise or divide branches into geographic territo-
ries (such as four branches per region) with regional decisions made by the headquarters store in 
each territory.
Advantages of centralized buying are the integration of effort, strict controls, consistent 
image, proximity to top management, staff support, and volume discounts. Possible disadvantages 
are the inflexibility, time delays, poor morale at local stores, and excessive uniformity. Decentral-
ized buying has these advantages: adaptability to local conditions, quick order processing, and 
improved morale because of branch autonomy. Potential disadvantages are disjointed planning, 
an inconsistent image, limited controls, little staff support, and a loss of volume discounts.
Many chains combine the formats by deploying a centralized buying organization while also 
giving store managers some input. Inditex, the Madrid-based global parent company of retail 
chains such as Zara, Pull & Bear, Massimo Dutti, Bershka, Stradivarius, Oysho, Zara Home, and 
Uterqüe, has more than 7,000 stores in 88 countries and online stores in 29 countries. It uses 
centralized design, buying, and logistics centers for each concept while maintaining flexibility in 
adapting production to local market demand and customer preferences through 11 clusters that 
control the supply chain throughout the various stages of design, manufacture, and retailing.8
Organizational Breadth
In a general buying organization, one or several people buy all the merchandise for the firm. The 
owner of a small hardware store, however, will likely buy the merchandise for his or her store. 
With a specialized organization, each buyer is responsible for a product category. For example, a 
department store usually has separate buyers for girls’, juniors’, and women’s clothes.
A general approach is better if a retailer is small or there are few products involved. A spe-
cialized approach is better if a retailer is large or carries many products. By specializing, there is 
greater expertise and responsibility is well defined; however, costs are higher and extra personnel 
are required.
Personnel Resources
A retailer can choose an inside or outside buying organization. An inside buying organization is 
staffed by a retailer’s personnel, and merchandise decisions are made by permanent employees.

are hired, usually on a fee basis. Most retailers use either an inside or an outside organization; 
some employ a combination.
An inside buying organization is most often used by large retailers and very small retailers. 
Large retailers do this to have greater control over merchandising decisions and to be more distinc-
tive. They have the financial clout to employ their own specialists. At very small retailers, the 
owner or manager does all merchandising functions to save money and keep close to the market.
Ross Stores (www.rossstores.com), the off-price apparel chain that operates Ross Stores 
(1,210 stores in 33 states) and dd’s Discounts (152 stores in 15 states), is an example of a retailer 
with an inside buying organization. The majority of merchandise in these stores are acquired 
through opportunistic purchases created by manufacturer overruns and canceled orders during 
season (“closeouts”) and at the end of a season (“packaways”). Ross operates buying offices in two 
strategic locations, New York City and Los Angeles, the largest U.S. apparel markets. Its buyers are 
in the market daily, sourcing opportunities, negotiating purchases with vendors and manufacturers, 
and strengthening vendor relationships —a critical ingredient in the success of its off-price buying 
strategies. Ross has separate buying organizations for Ross Stores and dd’s Discounts that employ 
700 merchants, merchandise managers, buyers, and assistant buyers across both organizations, 
with an average of about 8 years of experience at other department stores or off-price retailers.9
An outside organization is most frequently used by small or medium-sized retailers or those 
far from supply sources. It is more efficient for these retailers to hire outside buyers than to use 
company personnel. An outside organization has purchase volume clout in dealing with suppliers, 
usually services noncompeting retailers, offers research, and may sponsor private brands. Outside 
buying organizations may be paid by retailers that subscribe to their services or by vendors that 
give commissions. An individual retailer may set up its own internal organization if it feels its 
outside group is dealing with direct competitors or the firm finds it can buy items more efficiently 
on its own.
The Doneger Group (www.doneger.com), founded in 1946, is one of the leading outside buy-
ing firms, with hundreds of retailer clients. Through its Price Point Buying (PPB) division, 
Donegar identifies opportunistic buys and facilitates business relationships between its retail cli-
ents and vendors in the competitive, fast-changing, value-driven retail industry. It is the industry’s 
leading source of global trend intelligence, creative design services, focused and seasonal mer-
chandising direction, expert analysis of the retail business, trend forecasting, and comprehensive 
market information.10
A resident buying office, which can be an inside or outside organization, is used when a 
retailer wants to keep in close touch with key market trends and cannot do so through only the 
headquarters buying staff. Such offices are situated in vital merchandise centers and provide data 
and contacts. Worldwide, several specialized firms operate resident buying offices. For instance, 
the VIB Group, based in Milan, Italy, has a major resident buying office for international retail-
ers. The VIB Fashion Consulting Buying office acts as a local representative of international

clients providing a broad range of services, including market analysis, product portfolio reviews, 
assisting client company buying staff in making the right decisions in tune with local market 
preferences and intricacies, and developing relationships with vendors. VIB also acts in fulfilling 
supply requirements of clients in terms of price and contract negotiations, export documentation, 
compliance with import countries’ legislation, and buying merchandise on their behalf.11 Besides 
the large players, there are many smaller outside resident buying offices that assist retailers.
Today, independent retailers and small chains are involved with cooperative buying to a 
greater degree than before to compete with large chains. In cooperative buying, a group of 
retailers gets together to make quantity purchases from suppliers and obtain volume discounts. It 
is most popular among consumer electronics, food, hardware, and drugstore retailers. One such 
entity is BrandSource, which represents 4,500 member stores that together account for $14 bil-
lion in annual purchases.12 In addition to major appliances, BrandSource-affiliated retailers sell 
consumer electronics, bedding, home furnishings, and floor coverings. The cooperative also plans 
and implements promotional programs, as well as wholesale and retail financing, for its members.
As another cooperative buying illustration, the Federation of Pharmacy Networks (FPN) 
comprises 22 member-buying groups across the United States. It represents more than 15,000 
independent drugstore owners. Other consumer electronics buying groups (in the field of electron-
ics) include Mega Group USA, Nationwide Marketing Group, and NATM Buying Corporation.
Functions Performed
At this juncture, the responsibilities and functions of merchandise and in-store personnel are 
assigned. With a “merchandising” view, merchandise personnel oversee all buying and selling 
functions, including assortments, advertising, pricing, point-of-sale displays, employee utilization, 
and personal selling approaches. With a “buying” view, merchandise personnel oversee the buying 
of products, advertising, and pricing, whereas in-store personnel oversee assortments, displays, 
employee utilization, and sales presentations. The functions undertaken must reflect the retailer’s 
level of formality, the degree of centralization, and personnel resources.
Staffing
The last organizational decision involves staffing. What positions must be filled and with what 
qualifications? Firms with a merchandising viewpoint are most concerned with hiring good buy-
ers. Firms with a buying perspective are concerned about hiring sales managers, as well. Many 
large firms hire college graduates, train them, and promote them to buyers and sales managers.
A buyer is responsible for selecting the merchandise to be carried by a retailer and setting a 
strategy to market that merchandise. He or she devises and controls sales and profit projections for 
a product category (generally for all stores in a chain); plans proper merchandise assortments, styl-
ing, sizes, and quantities; negotiates with and evaluates vendors; and often oversees in-store dis-
plays. He or she must be attuned to the marketplace and travel to the marketplace when needed, be 
able to bargain with suppliers, and be capable of preparing detailed plans. A sales manager typi-
cally supervises the on-floor selling and operational activities for a specific retail department. He 
or she must be a good organizer, administrator, and motivator. A merchandising buyer must possess 
attributes of each. Most retailers believe the critical qualification for good merchandisers is an 
ability to relate to customers and methodically anticipate future needs. In addition, to some extent, 
buyers are involved with many of the remaining tasks described in this and the next chapter.

worldwide. These include catalogs (50 different versions in every U.S. state and in 170 countries); 
retail stores (28 stores and 10 outlets in the United States, 23 stores and outlets in Japan); Web 
sites (in 200 countries); Outdoor Adventures Programs (more than 150,000 U.S. customers); 
and corporate sales. L.L. Bean uses JDA Software’s supply and demand optimization solutions, 
JDA Demand, to get a read on market trends and develop scalable, integrated multiyear plans for 
product design, assortment planning, logistics, and enterprise planning.13
In this section, forecasting is examined from a general planning perspective. In Chapter 16, the 
financial dimensions of forecasting are reviewed. When preparing forecasts, it is essential to distinguish 
among different types of merchandise. Staple merchandise consists of the regular products carried by 
a retailer. For a supermarket, staples include milk, bread, canned soup, and facial tissues. For a depart-
ment store, staples include everyday watches, jeans, glassware, and housewares. Because these items 
have relatively stable sales (sometimes seasonal) and their nature may not change much over time, 
a retailer can clearly outline the quantities for these items. A basic stock list specifies the inventory 
level, color, brand, style category, size, package, and so on for every staple item carried by the retailer.
Assortment merchandise consists of apparel, furniture, autos, and other products for which the 
retailer must carry a variety of products in order to give customers a proper selection. These goods are 
harder to forecast than staples due to demand variations, style changes, and the number of sizes and 
colors carried. Decisions are two-pronged: (1) Product lines, styles, designs, and colors are projected. 
(2) A model stock plan is used to project specific items, such as the number of green, red, and blue 
pullover sweaters of a certain design by size. With a model stock plan, many items are ordered for 
popular sizes and colors, and small amounts of less popular sizes and colors fill out the assortment.
Fashion merchandise consists of products that may have cyclical sales due to changing 
tastes and lifestyles. For these items, forecasting can be hard because styles may change from year 
to year. “Hot” colors often change back and forth. Seasonal merchandise consists of products 
that sell well over nonconsecutive time periods. Items such as ski equipment and air-conditioner 
servicing have excellent sales during one season per year. Because the strongest sales of seasonal 
items usually occur at the same time each year, forecasting is straightforward.
With fad merchandise, high sales are generated for a short time. Often, toys and games are 
fads, such as Star Wars toys that flew off store shelves each time a related movie was released. It 
is hard to forecast whether such products will reach specific sales targets and how long they will 
be popular. Sometimes, fads turn into extended fads—and sales continue for a long period at a 
fraction of earlier sales. Trivial Pursuit board games are in the extended fad category.
In forecasting for best-sellers, many retailers use a never-out list to determine the amount of mer-
chandise to purchase for resale. The goal is to purchase enough of these products so they are always in 
stock. Products are added to and deleted from the list as their popularity changes. Before a new James 
Patterson novel is released, stores order large quantities to be sure they meet anticipated demand. After 
it disappears from best-seller lists, smaller quantities are kept. It is a good strategy to use a combina-
tion of a basic stock list, a model stock plan, and a never-out list. These lists may overlap.
Innovativeness
The innovativeness of a merchandise plan depends on a number of factors. See Table 14-1. An 
innovative retailer has a great opportunity—distinctiveness (by being first to market) and a great 
risk (possibly misreading customers and being stuck with large inventories). By assessing each 
Some retailers such as Gap, Limited, and Trader Joe’s almost 
exclusively sell private brands. Others such as Costco, Sears, Ama-
zon, Target, and Macy’s use a mixed-brand strategy that features 
both national and private brands. In many respects, a buyer of 
private-brand goods has a more complex job than a national-
brand buyer. For example, a private brand can be positioned 
below, at, or above the quality of a national brand. Private-label 
suppliers can be easily switched based on costs, product quality, 
and delivery speed. Also, private-brand buyers must determine 
the value proposition behind the brand. Is it a better value due 
to lower cost? Or is it unique? Private-label buyers need to accu-
rately forecast sales. Unlike national brands, private-brand orders 
cannot be canceled. There are also no markdown allowances 
associated with private brands.
As a private-label buyer of men’s dress slacks for a membership 
club, develop your value proposition relative to national brands.

factor in Table 14-1 and preparing a detailed plan for merchandising new goods and services, a 
firm can better capitalize on opportunities and reduce risks. As shown in Figure 14-6, some apparel 
retailers take innovativeness quite seriously—so do firms such as Brookstone and 7-Eleven:
▶
▶Brookstone offers an eclectic mix of unique, functional, and distinctive consumer products—
ranging from massage chairs to travel electronics to blood pressure monitors—through cata-
logs, Web sites, E-mail marketing, and its 200 retail stores in shopping malls, lifestyle centers, 
and airports. Brookstone provides a fun, interactive shopping experience and an opportunity 
to discover new and ingenious items where customers are encouraged to try products out for 
hands-on shopping.
▶
▶The convenience store format is quite innovative, as shown by 7-Eleven, which began as 
Southland Ice Company in 1927, selling milk, eggs, and bread. Today, 7-Eleven introduces 
new goods and services virtually every week based on the preferences of guests at each 
locale. Stores vary in size from 2,400 to 3,000 square feet and offer a selection of about 2,500 
different goods and services, including food service offerings such as prepared-fresh-daily 
sandwiches; coffee and its popular Big Gulp fountain soft drink; a wide assortment of fruit,

Relevance for Planning
Target market(s)
Evaluate whether the target market is conservative or innovative.
Goods/services growth  
potential
Consider each new offering on the basis of rapidity of initial sales, maximum sales 
potential per time period, and length of sales life.
Fashion trends
Understand vertical and horizontal fashion trends, if appropriate.
Retailer image
Carry goods/services that reinforce the firm’s image. The level of innovativeness should 
be consistent with this image.
Competition
Lead or follow competition in the selection of new goods/services.
Customer segments
Segment customers by dividing merchandise into established-product displays and 
­new-product displays.
Responsiveness to consumers
Carry new offerings when requested by the target market.
Amount of investment
Consider all the possible investments for each new good/service: product costs, new 
­fixtures, and additional personnel (or further training for existing personnel).
Profitability
Assess each new offering for potential profits.
Risk
Be aware of the possible tarnishing of the retailer’s image, investment costs, and 
­opportunity costs.
Constrained decision making
Restrict franchisees and chain branches from buying certain items.
Declining goods/services
Delete older goods/services if sales and/or profits are too low.

Retailers should assess the growth potential for each new good or service they carry: How 
fast will a new item generate significant sales? What are the most sales (dollars and units) to be 
reached in a season or year? Over what period will an item continue selling? One tool to assess 
potential is the product life cycle, which shows the expected behavior of a good or service over 
its life. The basic cycle comprises introduction, growth, maturity, and decline stages—shown in 
Figure 14-7 and described next.
During the introduction stage, a retailer should anticipate a limited target market. The good 
or service will probably be supplied in one basic version. The manufacturer (supplier) may limit 
distribution to “finer” stores. Yet, new convenience items such as food and housewares products 
are normally mass distributed. Items initially distributed selectively tend to have high prices. 
Mass-distributed products tend to involve low prices to foster faster consumer acceptance. Early 
promotion must be explanatory, geared to informing shoppers. At this stage, there are few pos-
sible suppliers.
As innovators buy a new product and recommend it to friends, sales increase rapidly and the 
growth stage begins. The target market includes middle-income consumers who are more innova-
tive than average. The assortment expands, as do the retailers carrying a product. Price discount-
ing is not widely used, but competitors offer a range of prices and customer service. Promotion 
is more persuasive and aimed at acquainting shoppers with availability and services. There are 
more suppliers.
In the maturity stage, sales reach their maximum, the largest part of the target market is attracted, 
and shoppers select from broad product offerings. All types of retailers (discount to upscale) carry 
a good or service in some form. Prestige retailers stress brand names and customer service, while 
others use active price competition. Price is more often cited in ads. Competition is intense.
Decline is brought on by a shrinking market (due to product obsolescence, newer substitutes, 
and boredom) and lower profit margins. The target market may be the lowest-income consum-
ers and laggards. Some retailers cut back on the assortment; others drop the good or service. 
For retailers still carrying the items, promotion is reduced and geared to price. There are fewer 
suppliers.
Many retailers pay a lot of attention to new-product additions but not enough to decide 
whether to drop existing items. Yet, because of limited resources and shelf space, some items have 
to be dropped when others are added. Instead of intuitively pruning products, a retailer should 
use structured guidelines:
▶
▶Select items for possible elimination on the basis of declining sales, prices, and profits, as well 
as the appearance of substitutes.
▶
▶Gather and analyze detailed financial and other data about these items.

▶
▶Consider nondeletion strategies such as cutting costs, revising promotion efforts, adjusting 
prices, and cooperating with other retailers.
▶
▶After making a deletion decision, do not overlook timing, parts and servicing, inventory, and 
holdover demand.
Sometimes, a seemingly obsolete good or service can be revived. An innovative retailer recog-
nizes the potential in this area and merchandises accordingly. Direct marketers heavily promote 
“greatest hits” recordings featuring individual music artists and compilations of multiple artists.
Apparel retailers must be familiar with fashion trends. A vertical trend occurs when a fash-
ion is first introduced to and accepted by upscale consumers and then undergoes changes in 
its basic form before it is sold to the general public. This type of fashion goes through three 
stages: (1) distinctive—original designs, designer stores, custom-made, worn by upscale shoppers; 
(2) ­emulation—modification of original designs, finer stores, alterations, worn by middle class; and 
(3) economic emulation—simple copies, discount stores, mass-produced, mass-marketed.
With a horizontal trend, a new fashion is marketed to a broad spectrum of people at its intro-
duction while retaining its basic form. In any social class, there are innovative customers who 
are opinion leaders. New fashions must be accepted by them, who then convince other members 
of the same social class (who are more conservative) to buy the items. Fashion is sold across the 
class and not from one class to another. Figure 14-8 has a checklist for predicting fashion adoption.
Assortment
An assortment is the selection of merchandise a retailer carries. It includes both the breadth of 
product categories and the variety within each category.
A firm first chooses merchandise quality. Should it carry top-line, expensive items and sell 
to upper-income customers? Or should it carry middle-of-the-line, moderately priced items and 
cater to middle-income customers? Or should it carry lesser-quality, inexpensive items and attract 
lower-income customers? Or should it try to draw more than one segment by offering a variety, 
such as middle- and top-line items? The firm must also decide whether to carry promotional 
products (low-priced closeout items or special buys used to generate store traffic). Several factors 
must be reviewed in choosing merchandise quality. See Table 14-2.
Dollar Tree is the largest single-price-point ($1.00) retailer in North America. Its overall visual 
merchandising strategy encourages a “treasure hunt” orientation to shopping with a selection of 
high-value, low-cost merchandise in attractively designed stores that are conveniently located. Dol-
lar Tree provides a balanced selection of everyday consumables such as candy and food, health and 
beauty care; basic consumables such as paper products and household chemicals; variety merchan-
dise such as toys, stationery, gifts, party goods, greeting cards, an soft goods; seasonal (Valentine’s 
Day, Easter, Halloween, and Christmas merchandise); and closeout and promotional merchandise

Fashion Adoption
Does the fashion satisfy a consumer need?
Is the fashion compatible with emerging consumer lifestyles?
Is the fashion oriented toward the mass market or a market segment?
Is the fashion radically new?
Are the reputations of the designer(s) and the retailers carrying the fashion good?
Are several designers marketing some version of the fashion?
Is the price range for the fashion appropriate for the target market?
Will appropriate advertising be used?
Will the fashion change over time?
Will consumers view the fashion as a long-term trend?

all for $1 each! Consumables and variety goods each account for 45 percent of merchandise. 
Consumables encourage frequent store return visits and increase traffic and sales.15
After deciding on product quality, a retailer determines its width and depth of assortment. 
Width of assortment refers to the number of distinct goods/services categories (product lines) a 
retailer carries. Depth of assortment refers to the variety in any one goods/services category 
(product line) a retailer carries. As noted in Chapter 5, an assortment can range from wide and 
deep (department store) to narrow and shallow (box store). Figure 14-9 shows advantages and dis-
advantages for each basic strategy.
Assortment strategies vary widely. Web retailer Discount Art (www.discountart.com) 
says it is geared to “the artist who demands good-quality art materials, but also appreci-
ates good prices.” But even small retailers with a narrow product assortment, like the one in  
Figure 14-10, need a good selection to draw shoppers. KFC’s thousands of worldwide outlets 
emphasize chicken and related products. They do not sell hamburgers, pizza, or many other 
popular fast-food items. Macy’s department stores feature thousands of general merchandise 
items, and Amazon.com is an online department store with millions of items for sale. This is 
the dilemma that retailers may face in determining how big an assortment to carry. Creating the 
right merchandise assortment that is frequently refreshed, accurately tailored to local market 
and E-commerce customer preferences, and seasonal market demand is essential to maximizing 
ROI and growing top-line sales.16
Retailers should take several factors into account in planning their assortment: If variety is 
increased, will overall sales go up? Will overall profits? How much space is required for each prod-
uct category? How much space is available? Carrying 10 varieties of cat food will not ­necessarily 
yield greater sales or profits than stocking 4 varieties. The retailer must look at the investment 
costs that occur with a large variety. Because selling space is limited, it should be allocated to 
those goods and services generating the most customer traffic and sales. The inventory turnover 
rate should also be studied.

TABLE 14-2  Factors to Take into Account When Planning Merchandise Quality
Factor
Relevance for Planning
Target market(s)
Match merchandise quality to the wishes of the desired target market(s).
Competition
Sell similar quality (follow the competition) or different quality (to appeal to a different 
target market).
Retailer’s image
Relate merchandise quality directly to the perception that customers have of a retailer.
Store location
Consider the impact of location on the retailer’s image and the number of competitors, 
which, in turn, relate to quality.
Stock turnover
Be aware that high quality and high prices usually yield a lower turnover than low 
­quality and low prices.
Profitability
Recognize that high-quality goods generally bring greater profit per unit than  
lesser-quality goods; turnover may cause total profits to be greater for the latter.
Manufacturer versus  
private brands
Understand that, for many consumers, manufacturer brands connote higher quality than 
private brands.
Customer services offered
Know that high-quality goods require personal selling, alterations, delivery, and so on. 
Lesser-quality merchandise may not.
Personnel
Employ skilled, knowledgeable personnel for high-quality merchandise. Self-service 
may be used with lesser-quality merchandise.
Perceived goods/ 
services benefits
Analyze consumers. Lesser-quality goods attract customers who desire functional 
product benefits. High-quality goods attract customers who desire extended product 
benefits (e.g., status, services).
Constrained decision making
Face reality.
a. Franchisees or chain store managers often have limited or no control over product 
decisions.
b. Independent retailers that buy from a few large wholesalers are limited to the range 
of quality offered by those wholesalers.

 
CHAPTER 14   •  Developing Merchandise Plans	
371	
A distinction should be made among scrambled merchandising, complementary goods and 
services, and substitute goods and services. With scrambled merchandising, a retailer adds unre-
lated items to generate more revenues and lift profit margins (such as a florist carrying umbrellas). 
Handling complementary goods and services lets the retailer sell both basic items and related 
offerings (such as stereos and CDs) via cross-merchandising. Although scrambled merchandis-
ing and cross-merchandising both increase overall sales, carrying too many substitute goods and 
services (such as competing brands of toothpaste) may shift sales from one brand to another 
and have little impact on overall retail sales.
These factors are also key as a retailer considers a wider, deeper assortment: (1) Risks, 
merchandise investments, damages, and obsolescence may rise dramatically. (2) Personnel may 
be spread too thinly over dissimilar products. (3) Both the positive and negative ramifications 
of scrambled merchandising may occur. (4) Inventory control may be difficult; overall turnover 
probably will slow down.

A retailer may not have a choice about stocking a full assortment within a product line if a 
powerful supplier insists that the retailer carry its entire line or it will not sell at all to that retailer. 
But large retailers—and smaller ones belonging to cooperative buying groups—are now stand-
ing up to suppliers, and many retailers stock their own brands next to those of the manufacturer.
Brands
As part of its assortment planning, a retailer chooses the proper mix of manufacturer, private, and 
generic brands—a challenge made more complex with the proliferation of brands. Manufacturer 
(national) brands are produced and controlled by manufacturers. They are usually well known, 
are supported by manufacturer ads, are somewhat pre-sold to consumers, require limited retailer 
investment in marketing, and often represent maximum quality to consumers.
Manufacturer brands dominate sales in many categories. Popular manufacturer brands include 
Apple, Coke, Gillette, Levi’s, Microsoft, Nike, Revlon, and Samsung. The retailers likely to 
rely most heavily on manufacturer brands are small firms, Web firms, discounters, and others 
that want the credibility associated with well-known brands or that have low-price strategies (so 
consumers can compare the prices of different retailers on name-brand items). Although they 
face extensive competition from private brands, manufacturer brands remain the dominant type 
of brand, accounting for more than 80 percent of all retail sales worldwide.17 See Figure 14-11.
Private (dealer or store) brands  contain names designated by wholesalers or retailers. They 
are more profitable to retailers, are better controlled by retailers, are not sold by competing retail-
ers, are less expensive for consumers, and lead to customer loyalty to retailers. With most private 
brands, retailers must line up suppliers, arrange for distribution and warehousing, sponsor ads, 
create displays, and absorb losses from unsold items. This is why retailer interest in private brands 
is growing:
▶
▶In dollar sales, private brands account for about 17 percent of U.S. retail revenues; they 
account for 20 percent of unit sales for consumer packaged goods.18 In Europe, the dollar sales 
figure for private brands at grocery stores ranges from 17 percent of retail store revenues in 
Italy to 53 percent in Switzerland.19
▶
▶Private brands are often priced 20 to 30 percent below manufacturer brands. This benefits 
consumers and retailers (whose costs are lower and whose revenues are shared by fewer

parties). In general, gross profits are higher for private brands than manufacturer brands, 
despite their lower prices.
▶
▶At Gap, Old Navy, Limited, Uniqlo, McDonald’s, Aldi, Trader Joe’s, and many other retailers, 
private brands represent most or all of company revenues.
▶
▶At virtually all large retailers, both private brands and manufacturer brands are strong. 
­Amazon.com has plans to sell private-label nuts, teas, spices, coffees, baby foods, and vita-
mins along with millions of manufacturer-branded items. It plans to use such brand names 
as Happy Belly, Wickedly Prime, Presto!, and Mama Bear for its private-label products and 
to restrict purchases to its Amazon Prime customers who pay $99 per year for the service.20 
Take our private brand challenge in Table 14-3.
In the past, private brands were only discount versions of mid-tier products. Today, shoppers 
around the world are more conscious of value and increasingly read ingredient labels on products 
to impute quality. Recognizing that price is not the single differentiator for all shoppers, retail-
ers have invested in developing a wider variety of competitive private-brand offerings. Multitiered 
private label brands target shoppers at the premium, standard, and value price points. In some 
categories, differentiated features of the higher-priced premium private label products make them 
the most expensive and innovative product.21
For example, a premium private brand offered by Harris Teeter (the supermarket chain) is 
H.T. Traders, which is exclusive to the chain. Harris Teeter applies global food and flavor trends 
to its premium private-label products such as olive oil and aromatic gourmet coffee to convey 
superior quality and to cater to consumers who seek quality, novelty, and adventure in their every-
day grocery food purchases.22

By sheer numbers, China’s Gen-Y (born in the 1980s to mid-
1990s) and Gen-Z (born in the mid-1990s to 2000s) are equal 
to the whole population of the United States. No doubt, then, 
that they represent a massive market not only in China itself 
but for global retailers and brands too. In the past, Chinese 
consumers would have favored domestic brands; perhaps they 
could only access these particular ones at the time, and for the 
most part, global brands would have been too expensive as 
alternatives. The Gen-Y and Gen-Z groups grew up in a pros-
perous China. This is a new China that had—to some extent—
opened its doors and was truly international and connected.

Part 6  •  Merchandise Management and Pricing
Care must be taken in deciding how much to emphasize private brands. As previously noted, 
many consumers are loyal to manufacturer brands and would shop elsewhere if those brands are 
not stocked or their variety is pruned. See Figure 14-12.
Generic brands feature products’ generic names as brands (such as canned peas); they are a 
form of private, no-frills goods stocked by some retailers. These items usually get secondary shelf 
locations, have little or no promotion support, may be of less quality, are stocked in limited assort-
ments, and have plain packages. Retailers control generics and price them well below other brands. 
In supermarkets, generics account for under 1 percent of sales. For prescription drugs, where the 
quality of manufacturer brands and generics is similar, generics provide 60 percent of sales.

CHAPTER 14   •  Developing Merchandise Plans	
375	
The competition between manufacturers and retailers for shelf space and profits has led to 
a battle of the brands, whereby manufacturer, private, and generic brands fight each other for 
more space and control. Nowhere is this battle clearer than for mature product categories such as 
paper products at large grocery stores or office products retail chains.23
Timing
For new products, the retailer must decide when they are first purchased, displayed, and sold. For 
established products, the firm must plan the merchandise flow during the year. The retailer should 
take into account its forecasts and other factors: peak seasons, order and delivery time, routine 
versus special orders, stock turnover, discounts, and the efficiency of inventory procedures.
Some goods (e.g., winter coats) and services (snow plowing) have peak seasons. These items 
require large inventories in peak times and less stock during off seasons. Because some people 
like to shop during off seasons, the retailer should not eliminate the items.
With regard to order and delivery time, how long does it take the retailer to process an order 
request? After the order is sent to the supplier, how long does it take to receive merchandise? 
By adding these two periods together, the retailer can get a good idea of the lead time to restock 
shelves. If it takes a retailer 7 days to process an order and the supplier another 14 days to deliver 
goods, the retailer should begin a new order at least 21 days before the old inventory runs out.
Routine orders involve restocking staples and other regularly sold items. Deliveries are 
received weekly, monthly, and so on. Planning and problems are minimized. Special orders 
involve merchandise not sold regularly, such as custom furniture. They need more planning and 
cooperation between retailer and supplier. Specific delivery dates are usually arranged.
Stock turnover (how quickly merchandise sells) greatly influences how often items must be 
ordered. Convenience items such as milk and bread (which are also highly perishable) have a high 
turnover rate and are restocked quite often. Shopping items such as refrigerators and televisions 
have a lower turnover rate and are restocked less often.
In deciding when and how often to buy merchandise, the availability of quantity discounts 
should be considered. Large purchases may result in lower per-unit costs. Efficient inventory 
procedures, such as electronic data interchange and quick response planning procedures, also 
decrease costs and order times while raising merchandise productivity.
Allocation
The last part of merchandise planning is the allocation of products. A single-unit retailer 
chooses how much merchandise to place on the sales floor, how much to place in a stockroom, 
and whether to use a warehouse. A chain also apportions products among stores. Allocation is 
covered further in Chapter 15.
Some retailers rely on warehouses as distribution centers. Products are shipped from suppliers 
to these warehouses, and then they are assigned and shipped to individual stores. Other retail-
ers, including many supermarket chains, do not rely as much on warehouses. They have at least 
some goods shipped directly from suppliers to individual stores.
It is vital for chains, whether engaged in centralized or decentralized merchandising, to have 
a clear store-by-store allocation plan. Even if merchandise lines are standardized across the chain, 
store-by-store assortments must reflect the variations in the size and diversity of the customer 
base, in store size and location, in the climate, and in other factors.
Retailers with liberal return policies may be setting themselves 
up for fraud. Return fraud by consumers can take various forms: 
used merchandise represented as new; merchandise intended 
to be returned at the time of purchase (a costly camera for use 
on a vacation); merchandise bought on sale but returned at full 
price; merchandise bought at other stores; stolen merchandise; 
and more. Fraudulent returns may occur more frequently at 
holiday periods when retailers are overwhelmed with requests. 
In response, some retailers have restocking fees (unless a good is 
defective), monitor customer return frequency to stop frequent 
offenders, and insist on sales receipts or other proof of purchase.
How would you deter fraud at a fine jewelry store, which 
suspects that a high proportion of heavy customers return goods 
directly after use on a special occasion?

Part 6  •  Merchandise Management and Pricing
CATEGORY MANAGEMENT
As noted in Chapter 2, category management is a merchandising technique that some firms—
including supermarkets, drugstores, hardware stores, and general merchandise retailers—use to 
improve productivity. It is a way to manage a retail business that focuses on the performance of 
product category results rather than individual brands. It arranges product groupings into stra-
tegic business units to better meet consumer needs and to achieve sales and profit goals. Retail 
managers make merchandising decisions that maximize the total return on the assets assigned 
to them.
Retailers implement category management by recognizing the interrelatedness of products 
in a category; they then focus on improving the performance of whole product categories rather 
than the performance of individual brands. Some examples might be cheese, clothes, detergent, 
skin care, small animal foods, and athletic wear. Under category management, traditional brand- 
(­vendor-) oriented buyers are replaced with category managers who are responsible for integrating 
procurement, pricing, and merchandising of all brands in a category. These category managers 
jointly develop and implement category-based plans with manufacturers to enhance the outcomes 
for both parties, which is conducive to more collaborative relationships and information sharing. 
Sometimes, the category management leader might be a representative of the dominant supplier 
in the category—for example, cheese (Kraft Food Group); clothes detergent (P&G); skin care 
(L’Oréal); and so on. Suppliers are expected to propose actions (such as new products or promo-
tions) and be rated on their ability to increase total category sales (not just their own brands) and 
shopper satisfaction.24
According to the A.C. Nielsen research firm, good category management involves  
these steps:
1.	 Define the category based on the needs of the target market.
2.	 Assign a role to the category based on several questions: How important is the category to 
the consumer? How important is the category to the retailer? How important is the category 
to the retailer’s competitors? What is the category’s outlook in the marketplace?
3.	 Assess the category to find opportunities for improvement.
4.	 Set performance targets and measure progress with a category scorecard.
5.	 Create a marketing strategy that draws the overarching picture of how to achieve the category 
role and scorecard targets.
6.	 Choose tactics for category assortment, pricing, promotion, merchandising, and supply chain 
strategies.
7.	 Roll out the plan.
8.	 Review performance regularly and adjust as needed.25
A fundamental premise is that a retailer must empower specific personnel to be responsible 
for the financial performance of each product category. As with micromerchandising, category 
management means adapting merchandise for each store or region to best satisfy customers. In 
deciding on the space per product category, there are several crucial measures of performance. 
Comparisons can be made by studying company data from period to period and by looking at 
categorical statistics in trade publications:
▶
▶Sales per linear foot of shelf space: Annual sales divided by the total linear footage devoted 
to the product category.
▶
▶Gross profit per linear foot of shelf space: Annual gross profit divided by the total linear 
footage devoted to the product category.
▶
▶Return on inventory investment: Annual gross profit divided by average inventory at cost.
▶
▶Inventory turnover: The number of times during a given period, usually one year, that the 
average inventory on hand is sold.
▶
▶Days’ supply: The number of days of supply of an item on the shelf.
▶
▶Direct product profitability (DPP): An item’s gross profit less its direct retailing costs 
(warehouse and store support, occupancy, inventory, and direct labor, but not general 
overhead).
Some collaborative aspects of category management are working well, whereas other 
aspects are not—due to the differing roles of manufacturers and retailers in the channel of 
distribution:26

profitability. The horizontal axis classifies brands in terms of unit sales (an indicator of inventory 
turnover). A new manufacturer brand in a category has the potential for high DPP but is not yet 
selling well, whereas a popular manufacturer brand in a category has both high DPP and high unit 
sales. The goal is to move the new manufacturer brand into the upper-right quadrant. A new private 
brand has the potential for good DPP if it can emulate a popular private brand in the category. The 
goal is to improve DPP based on sales by moving to the right-center quadrant. If both new brands 
succeed, while the existing ones stay popular, then sales and profits for the whole category will rise.
MERCHANDISING SOFTWARE
One of the most significant advances in merchandise planning is the widespread availability of 
computer software that gives retailers an excellent support mechanism to systematically prepare 
forecasts, try various assortment scenarios, coordinate data for category management, and so forth. 
In an era when many retailers carry thousands of items, merchandising software is a part of every-
day business life. See Figure 14-14.
Some merchandising software is provided by suppliers and trade associations at no charge—
as part of the value delivery chain and relationship retailing. Other software is sold by marketing 
firms, often for $1,500 or less (although some software sells for $25,000 or more). Let’s discuss 
the far-reaching nature of merchandising software.
General Merchandise Planning Software
Some retailers prefer functionally driven software; others use integrated software packages. The 
Container Store, the national storage and organization specialty retail pioneer, is an example of 
the latter. It utilizes MicroStrategy (www.microstrategy.com), a mobile-enabled platform that 
empowers store employees with real-time business intelligence from inventory systems. The data 
help analyze various store operations, sales performance, customer insights, and customer loyalty 
through easily configured mobile dashboards—without the need for information technology sup-
port. This enables Container Store leadership to access information throughout the firm’s entire 
network of stores and its supplier interface through a MicroStrategy dashboard named “The Score” 
(using the game analogy). Store personnel thus gain insights into trends and data that can be used 
to monitor, maximize, and benchmark performance against store and company goals.27
Forecasting Software
Many retailers use big data (culled from customer insights, loyalty card information, and interac-
tion across multiple channels) and advanced analytical systems to make merchandise forecasts. 
JDA Software (www.jda.com) is one of the firms that offers a wide range of products. Its Retail.
me solution is designed to help retailers forecast, plan, and develop highly localized assortments 
across stores by incorporating the retailer’s in-house customer and supply chain data along with 
third-party information from suppliers, consultants, and the industry. Retail.me is cloud-hosted 
and allows for end-to-end connectivity and synchronization with multiple organizational processes 
for the mobile-enabled omnichannel retailer. Hibbett Sports, a chain with more than 1,000 stores, 
uses the JDA Retail.me application to meet the challenge of planning and managing localized 
assortments across its stores and multiple channels, including mobile apps, to deliver its target 
ROI.28
Firms such as SAS (www.sas.com) offer sophisticated software for retail forecasting pur-
poses. This software can be used to analyze and forecast events that occur over time. Retailers are 
able to discern trends that were not previously noticeable, and they can anticipate ups and downs 
to better plan future activities.29
Innovativeness Software
Today’s software provides detailed data rapidly, thereby allowing retailers to monitor and more 
quickly react to trends. Processes that once took months are now done in weeks or days. Instead 
of missing a selling season, today’s retailers are prepared for the latest craze by crowdsourcing 
new product ideas from generation to concept testing. With crowdsourcing, retailers can raise 
funds online from small investors who do not receive any ownership.
As part of Macy’s (www.macys.com) retail innovation strategy to provide a frictionless omni-
shopping experience for Macys.com and Bloomingdales.com customers, Macy’s Idea Labs is a

excellence in acquiring and retaining Macy’s customers.30
Assortment and Allocation Software
A number of retailers employ merchandising software to better plan assortments. Leading footwear 
and accessories retailer DSW has to ensure that its merchandise assortment keeps pace with fashion 
and style trends. Among its goals are that it has the right sizes in appropriate quantities (or packs) 
delivered at the right time during the fashion cycle to each of its more than 375 stores, E-commerce 
warehouse, and 345 leased departments in U.S. retailers under the Affiliated Business Group banner.
SAS Merchandise Intelligence Solutions software (which includes SAS Size Profiling and 
Pack Optimization) helps DSW managers determine location-specific size and pack optimization 
for each shoe style and for unit replenishment orders in a way that results in fewer markdowns 
while also reducing stockouts. This is particularly effective with seasonal items such as sandals

that have a shorter shelf life than dress shoes. Store managers have greater confidence in ordering 
few quantities of hot seasonal styles while achieving good sales performance and avoiding end-
of-season liquidation. Vendors wary of markdowns and the effect this has on their brand equity 
are cooperative because they are alerted well in advance to the need for different pack sizes.31
Category Management Software
A wide range of software programs is available to help manufacturers and retailers deal with 
category management’s complexities. A few retailers have even developed their own software. 
Programs typically base space allocation on sales, inventory turnover, and profits at individual 
stores. Because data are specific to each store, space allocations reflect actual sales. Here are some 
examples of category management software:

Chapter Summary
1.	 To demonstrate the importance of a sound merchandising 
philosophy. Developing and implementing a merchandise 
plan is a key element in a successful retail strategy. Mer-
chandising consists of the activities involved in a retailer’s 
buying goods and services and making them available for 
sale. A merchandising philosophy sets the guiding prin-
ciples for all merchandise decisions and must reflect the 
desires of the target market, the retailer’s institutional type, 
its positioning, its defined value chain, supplier capabili-
ties, costs, competitors, product trends, and other factors.
2.	 To study various buying organization formats and the 
processes they use. The buying organization and its pro-
cesses must be defined in terms of its formality, degree 
of centralization, organizational breadth, personnel 
resources, functions performed, and staffing.
With a formal buying organization, merchandising is 
a distinct task in a separate department. In an informal 
buying organization, the same personnel handle both 
merchandising and other retail tasks. Multiunit retailers 
must choose whether to have a centralized or a decentral-
ized buying organization. In a centralized organization, 
all purchases emanate from one office. In a decentralized 
organization, decisions are made locally or regionally. 
For a general organization, one person or a few people 
buy all merchandise. For a specialized organization, each 
buyer is responsible for a product category.
An inside buying organization is staffed by a retail-
er’s personnel and decisions are made by its permanent 
employees. An outside buying organization involves 
a company or personnel external to the retailer. Most 
retailers use either an inside or an outside buying orga-
nization; some employ a combination. A resident buying 
office, which can be an inside or outside organization, 
is used when a retailer wants to keep in close touch with 
key markets and cannot do so through the headquarters 
buying staff. Independents and small chains often use 
cooperative buying to compete with large chains.
If a retailer has a “merchandising” view, merchan-
dise personnel oversee all buying and selling functions. 
If it has a “buying” view, merchandise personnel oversee 
buying, advertising, and pricing, while store personnel 
oversee assortments, displays, personnel deployment, 
and sales presentations.
A buyer is responsible for selecting merchandise 
and setting a strategy to market that merchandise. He 
or she devises and controls sales and profit projections 
for a product category; plans assortments, styling, sizes, 
and quantities; negotiates with and evaluates vendors; 
and oversees store displays. A sales manager supervises 
the on-floor selling and operational activities for a spe-
cific retail department. He or she must be a good orga-
nizer, administrator, and motivator.
3.	 To outline the considerations in devising merchandise 
plans: forecasts, innovativeness, assortment, brands, 
timing, and allocation. Forecasts are projections of 
expected retail sales; they form the foundation of mer-
chandise plans. Staple merchandise consists of the regu-
lar products a retailer carries. A basic stock list specifies 
the inventory level, color, brand, and so on for every 
staple item carried. Assortment merchandise consists of 
products for which there must be a variety so custom-
ers have a proper selection. A model stock plan projects 
levels of specific assortment merchandise. Fashion mer-
chandise has cyclical sales due to changing tastes and 
lifestyles. Seasonal merchandise sells well over noncon-
secutive periods. With fad merchandise, sales are high 
for a short time. When forecasting for best-sellers, many 
retailers use a never-out list.

 
CHAPTER 14   •  Developing Merchandise Plans	
381	
A retailer’s innovativeness is related to the target 
market(s), product growth potential, fashion trends, 
the retailer’s image, competition, customer segments, 
responsiveness to consumers, investment costs, profit-
ability, risk, constrained decision making, and declining 
goods and services. Three issues are of particular inter-
est: How fast will a new good or service generate sales? 
What are the most sales to be achieved in a season or a 
year? Over what period will a good or service continue 
to sell? A useful tool is the product life cycle.
An assortment is the merchandise selection carried. 
The retailer first chooses the quality of merchandise. 
The assortment is then determined. Width of assort-
ment refers to the number of distinct product catego-
ries carried. Depth of assortment refers to the variety in 
any ­category. As part of assortment planning, a retailer 
chooses its mix of brands. Manufacturer brands are pro-
duced and controlled by manufacturers. Private brands 
contain names designated by wholesalers or retailers. 
Generic brands feature generic names as brands and are 
a form of private brand. Competition between manufac-
turers and retailers is called the battle of the brands.
For new goods and services, it must be decided when 
they are first to be displayed and sold. For established 
goods and services, the firm must plan the merchandise 
flow during the year. In deciding when and how often to 
buy merchandise, quantity discounts should be consid-
ered. A single-unit retailer chooses how much merchan-
dise to allocate to the sales floor and how much to the 
stockroom, and whether to use a warehouse. A chain also 
allocates items among stores.
4.	 To discuss category management and merchandising 
software. Category management is a technique for man-
aging a retail business that focuses on product category 
results rather than the performance of individual brands. 
It arranges product groups into strategic business units to 
better address consumer needs and meet financial goals. 
Category management helps retail personnel make the 
merchandising decisions that maximize the total return 
on the assets. There is now plentiful PC- and Web-based 
merchandising software available for retailers, in just 
about every aspect of merchandise planning.

Chapter 
Objectives
1. To describe the steps 
in the implementation 
of merchandise plans: 
gathering information, 
selecting and interacting 
with merchandise 
sources, evaluation, 
negotiation, concluding 
purchases, receiving and 
stocking merchandise, 
reordering, and 
re-evaluation
2. To examine the 
prominent roles of 
logistics and inventory 
management in the 
implementation of 
merchandise plans
When enacting merchandise plans, many retail managers have a mantra: “Organize, 
Optimize, Synchronize.” American Eagle Outfitters’ (AEO) new distribution center in Hazelton, 
Pennsylvania, was specifically designed to handle both E-commerce and store fulfillment 
with maximum efficiency. Before the facility was constructed, the company maintained two 
separate distribution centers, neither of which was optimized for the company’s growing 
E-commerce sales. One facility in Kansas provided direct-to-consumer order fulfillment and 
in-store replenishment (handling all women’s AEO and Aerie-branded products); the other, 
near Pittsburgh, exclusively served bricks-and-mortar locations (handling all men’s products 
and footwear and accessories for both genders).
The logistics capabilities of direct-to-consumer order fulfillment and in-store replenishment 
differ greatly as a result of the order size. “Most distribution centers cannot economically ship 
small orders to final consumers. We needed a facility that could serve both and do it more 
efficiently,” says Christine Miller, AEO director of operations. “We also needed redundant 
capabilities for the direct [to store] business.”1

CHAPTER 15   •  Implementing Merchandise Plans	
383	
Overview
This chapter builds on Chapter 14 and covers the implementation of merchandise plans, including 
logistics and inventory management. Sometimes, it is simple to enact merchandise plans. Other 
times, it requires a lot of hard work. A big challenge that retailers face is reaching the proper bal-
ance between out-of-stock (OOS) and too much stock.
Out-of-stocks cost U.S. retailers more than $634 billion in lost retail sales. Overstocks account 
for $472 billion in lost revenues due to markdowns on excess inventory, which hurts margins. 
Increasing online sales, online returns, and order-online/pickup-in-store sales further complicate 
inventory management for omnichannel retailers. A lack of supplier collaboration in terms of their 
flexibility in pack sizes can further constrain retailers. Retailers can leverage customer data and 
advanced supply-chain solutions to develop accurate forecasts, which should also consider the 
impact of external factors such as weather, seasonality, and supplier constraints.2
IMPLEMENTING MERCHANDISE PLANS
The implementation of merchandise plans comprises the eight sequential steps shown in Figure 15-1  
and discussed next.
Gathering Information
After overall merchandising plans are set, more information about target market needs and pro-
spective suppliers is required before buying or rebuying merchandise. In gathering data about 
the marketplace, a retailer has several possible sources. The most valuable is the consumer. By 
regularly researching target-market demographics, lifestyles, product preferences, and potential 
shopping plans, a retailer can learn about consumer demand directly. Loyalty programs and social-
media comments are especially useful in tracking consumer purchases and interests.
Other information sources can be used when direct consumer data are insufficient. Suppliers 
(manufacturers and wholesalers) usually do their own sales forecasts and marketing research (such 
as test marketing). They also know how much outside promotional support a retailer will get. In 
closing a deal with the retailer, a supplier may present charts and graphs, showing forecasts and 
promotional support. Yet, the retailer should remember that it is the party with direct access to 
the target market and its needs.
Retail sales and display personnel interact with consumers and can pass their observations 
along to management. A want book (want slip) system is a formal way to record consumer 
requests for unstocked or out-of-stock merchandise. It is very helpful to a retailer’s buyers. 
Aside from customers, salespeople may provide the most useful information for merchandising 
decisions.
Competitors represent another information source. A risk-averse retailer may not stock an 
item until competitors do and may employ comparison shoppers to study the offerings and prices 
of competitors. The most sophisticated comparison shopping involves the use of Web-based

shopping bots (Web robots) such as mySimon.com, whereby competitors’ offerings and prices 
are tracked electronically. Rakuten.com, for one, constantly checks its prices to make sure that it 
is not undersold. In addition, trade publications report on trends in each aspect of retailing and 
provide another way of gathering data from competitors. Figure 15-2 is an example of a competi-
tion shopping report.
In addition, government sources indicate unemployment, inflation, and product safety data; 
independent news sources conduct their own consumer polls and do investigative reporting; and 
commercial data can be purchased.
To learn about the attributes of specific suppliers and their merchandise, retailers can do the 
following:
▶
▶Talk to suppliers, get specification sheets, read trade publications, and seek references.
▶
▶Attend trade shows that feature numerous exhibitors (suppliers). There are hundreds of trade 
shows yearly in New York. In Paris, the semiannual Prêt à Porter show attracts representa-
tives of more than 700 apparel brands and 50,000 attendees. The National Hardware Show 
in Las Vegas has 2,800 exhibitors and 30,000 attendees each year. The High Point Furniture 
Market in North Carolina has semiannual shows that attract more than 2,000 manufacturers 
and 75,000 attendees—from all 50 states and 110 countries.
▶
▶Visit year-round merchandise marts such as AmericasMart Atlanta (www.americasmart.com); 
California Market Center in Los Angeles (www.californiamarketcenter.com); Dallas Market 
Center (www.dallasmarketcenter.com); and The Mart in Chicago (http://themart.com). These 
marts have daily hours for permanent vendor showrooms and large areas for trade shows.
▶
▶Search the Web. One newer application is GoExhibit (www.goexhibit.com). A trade show 
coordinator can use this Web-based application to create a 3D virtual reality environment of 
a trade show on a Web site. Like a physical trade show, the coordinator can add and design 
booths, modify the exhibit hall layout, and manage exhibit hall features. In addition, the

coordinator can view and analyze trade-show chatter among attendees, as well as traffic 
counts and flow at exhibits—which are difficult to do at a traditional trade show. Attendees 
can access product information visit booths and chat with exhibitors and other attendees. 
Other technology allows exhibitors to stream on-demand webinars 24/7 anywhere in the 
world.3
Whatever information acquired, a retailer should feel comfortable that it is sufficient for good 
decision making. For routine decisions (staple products), limited information may be adequate. 
On the other hand, new fashions’ sales fluctuate widely and require extensive data for forecasts.
Selecting and Interacting with Merchandise Sources
The next step is to select merchandise sources and to interact with them. Three major options exist:
▶
▶Company-owned: A large retailer owns a manufacturing and/or wholesaling facility. A 
­company-owned supplier handles all or part of the merchandise the retailer requests.
▶
▶Outside, regularly used supplier: This supplier is not owned by the retailer but used regu-
larly. A retailer knows the quality of merchandise and the reliability of the supplier from its 
experience.
▶
▶Outside, new supplier: This supplier is not owned by the retailer, nor has the retailer bought 
from it before. The retailer may be unfamiliar with merchandise quality and supplier reliability.
A retailer can rely on one kind of supplier or use a combination (the biggest retailers often 
use all three formats). The types of outside suppliers (regularly used and new) are described in 
Figure 15-3. In choosing vendors, the criteria listed in the Figure 15-4 checklist should be 
considered.
Big Lots, which buys merchandise to stock its national chain of closeout stores, can attest to 
the complicated process of choosing suppliers. An important competitive advantage of its business 
model is to opportunistically purchase quality brand-name merchandise directly from manufactur-
ers, vendors, and, in some cases, bankruptcies, liquidations, and insurance claims at substantially 
lower prices than those paid by traditional retailers. It buys significant quantities of a vendor’s 
closeout merchandise in specific product categories and controls distribution in accordance with 
vendor instructions. In addition, purchases are supplemented with direct import and domesti-
cally sourced merchandise in some departments. The firm purchases 24 percent of merchandise 
directly from overseas vendors, including 20 percent from vendors in China.4
Retailers and suppliers often interact well together, as highlighted in Figure 15-5. Other times, 
there are conflicts. As noted earlier, relationship building can be invaluable. Yet, there remain sore 
points between retailers and suppliers. On the one hand, many retailers have beefed up their use 
of private brands because they are upset when suppliers such as Gucci open their own stores in 
the same shopping centers. Most Gucci sales now come from company-owned and franchised 
shops. On the other hand, many suppliers are distressed by what they believe is retailers’ exces-
sive use of chargebacks, whereby retailers, at their sole discretion, make deductions in their bills 
for infractions ranging from late shipments to damaged and expired goods. Some suppliers have 
even taken their retailers to court over the practice. Attain Consulting Group divides chargebacks 
into three categories:5
▶
▶Intentional deductions are offered by manufacturers to retailers with the goal of increasing the 
revenue of the manufacturers. Examples are discounts, rebates, advertising, and markdown 
allowances that provide retailers with an extra incentive to promote products.
▶
▶Unauthorized deductions are not foreseen by manufacturers. Examples are retailer charge-
backs for alleged merchandise shortages, customer returns to the retailer, and allegations of 
price discrepancies from what the retailer agreed to pay. Some retailers are aggressive in 
applying unauthorized deductions.
▶
▶Preventable deductions can be avoided by manufacturers through better performance. These 
deductions are due to suppliers not fully complying with retailers’ rules as to order fulfillment, 
shipper routing, container labeling, shipment documentation, or E-commerce practices. For 
example, a retailer might require that shipments be labeled with a specific barcode or that 
every item be folded and marked with the suggested retail price.
Selecting merchandise sources must be viewed as a two-way street. Given the growth of 
E-commerce, many manufacturers sell products online directly to customers. Most manufacturers 
Big Lots places emphasis 
on supplier relations (www 
.biglots.com/corporate/
vendors).

386 
Part 6  •  Merchandise Management and Pricing
take into account their retailers’ or resellers’ commercial interests and keep prices on their direct 
E-commerce sites high enough so retailers can still be competitive. Some manufacturers do not, 
however; prices on those manufacturer Web sites may be equal to or lower than retailers’ whole-
sale prices. The retailer has to pay for logistics, warehousing, rent, and employee salaries and 
may not be able to be competitive.6 Many retailers are able to counter the entry of manufacturer 
flagship stores by offering enhanced services and product add-ons.
Evaluating Merchandise
Whatever source is chosen, there must be a procedure to evaluate the merchandise under con-
sideration. Three procedures are possible: inspection, sampling, and description. The technique 
depends on the item’s cost, its attributes, and purchase regularity.
Inspection occurs when every single unit is examined before purchase and after delivery. 
Jewelry and art are examples of expensive, rather unique purchases for which the retailer care-
fully inspects all items.
Sampling is used with regular purchases of large quantities of breakable, perishable, or expen-
sive items. Because inspection is inefficient, items are sampled for quality and condition. A retailer 
ready to buy several hundred light fixtures, bunches of bananas, or inexpensive watches does not 
inspect each item. A number of units are sampled, and the entire selection is bought if the sample

is okay. An unsatisfactory sample might cause a whole shipment to be rejected (or a discount 
negotiated). Sampling may also occur upon receipt of merchandise.
Description buying is used with standardized, nonbreakable, and nonperishable merchandise. 
Items are not inspected or sampled; they are ordered in quantity based on a verbal, written, or pic-
torial description. A stationery store can order paper clips, pads, and printer paper from a catalog 
or Web site. After it receives an order, only a count of those items is conducted.
Negotiating the Purchase
Next, a retailer negotiates purchase terms. A new or special order usually leads to a negotiated 
contract, and a retailer and a supplier carefully discuss all aspects of the purchase. A regular order 
or reorder often involves a uniform contract, because terms are standard or have already been set 
and the order is handled routinely.

388 
Part 6  •  Merchandise Management and Pricing
Off-price retailers and other deep discounters may require negotiated contracts for most pur-
chases. These firms employ opportunistic buying, by which especially low prices are negotiated 
for merchandise whose sales have not lived up to expectations, end-of-season goods, items con-
sumers have returned to the manufacturer or another retailer, and closeouts. TJX is different from 
typical retailers that place merchandise orders well in advance of the selling season. Its buying 
organization has more than 1,000 associates in 15 buying offices in 11 countries and executes an 
opportunistic buying strategy depending on market conditions. This allows TJX to have better 
insights into fashion and market trends, as well as pricing—and it provides more flexibility to 
expand or contract product categories since TJX buys closer to the time merchandise is sold, thus 
reducing the need for markdowns. It acquires merchandise on an ongoing basis from many sources 
so as to offer a desirable and rapidly changing mix of branded designer and other quality merchan-
dise for less than the regular prices for comparable merchandise at department and specialty stores.7
Several purchase terms must be specified, whether a negotiated or a uniform contract is 
involved. These include the delivery date, quantity purchased, price and payment arrangements, 
discounts, form of delivery, and point of transfer of title, as well as special clauses.
Delivery dates and quantity purchased must be clear. A retailer should be able to cancel an 
order if either provision is not fulfilled. The purchase price, payment arrangements, and permis-
sible discounts must also be addressed. What is the retailer’s cost per item (including handling)? 
What forms of payment are permitted (cash and credit)? What discounts are given? Retailers’ 
purchase prices are often discounted for early payments (“2/10/net 30” means there is a 2 percent 
discount if the full bill is paid in 10 days; the full bill is due in 30 days); support activities (setting 
up displays); and quantity purchases. Stipulations are needed for the form of delivery (truck, rail, 
and so on) and the party responsible for shipping fees (FOB factory—free on board—means a 
supplier places merchandise with the shipper, but the retailer pays the freight). Last, the point of 
transfer of title—when ownership changes from supplier to buyer—must be stated in a contract.
Special clauses may be inserted by either party. Sometimes, they are beneficial to both parties 
(such as an agreement about the advertising support each party provides). Other times, clauses are 
inserted by the more powerful party. A major disagreement between vendors and large retailers 
is the latter’s increasing use of slotting allowances—payments that retailers require of vendors 
for providing shelf space, which varies based on number of product facings, prominence on a shelf 
or location within the store. Slotting fees were investigated by the Senate and Federal Trade 
­Commission (FTC) in the 1990s, since they reduce product variety for customers and is anti-­
competitive, a disadvantage for new or small manufacturers. The proprietary nature of negotiations 
on slotting allowances and the ensuing vertical contracts made it difficult for the FTC to ban 
slotting allowances because of lack of empirical evidence.8
Unlike many other retailers, industry leader Walmart does not charge any slotting allowances 
and often gets new products first from suppliers as a result of this policy.
Concluding Purchases
Many medium-sized and large retailers use computers to complete and process orders (based on 
electronic data interchange [EDI] and quick response [QR] inventory planning), and each purchase 
is fed into a computer data bank. Smaller retailers often write up and process orders manually, 
and purchase amounts are added to their inventory in the same way. Yet, with the advances in 
computerized ordering software, even small retailers may have the capability of placing orders 
electronically—especially if they buy from large wholesalers that use EDI and QR systems.
Multiunit retailers must determine whether the final purchase decision is made by central 
or regional management or by local managers. Advantages and disadvantages accrue to each 
approach.
Several alternatives are possible regarding the transfer of title between parties. The retailer’s 
responsibilities and rights differ in each of these situations:
▶
▶The retailer takes title immediately on purchase.
▶
▶The retailer assumes ownership after items are loaded onto the mode of transportation.
▶
▶The retailer takes title when a shipment is received.
▶
▶The retailer does not take title until the end of a billing cycle, when the supplier is paid.
▶
▶The retailer accepts merchandise on consignment and does not own the items. The supplier 
is paid after merchandise is sold.

CHAPTER 15   •  Implementing Merchandise Plans

A consignment or memorandum deal may be possible if a vendor is in a weak position and 
wants to persuade retailers to carry its items. In a consignment purchase, a retailer has no risk 
because title is not taken; the supplier owns the goods until sold. An electronic version (scan-
based trading) is being tried at some supermarkets. It saves time and money for all parties due to 
paperless steps in a purchase. In a memorandum purchase, risk is still low, but a retailer takes 
title on delivery and is responsible for damages. In both cases, retailers do not pay for items until 
they are sold, and they can return them.
Receiving and Stocking Merchandise
The retailer is now set to receive and handle items. This involves receiving and storing, checking 
and paying invoices, price and inventory marking, setting up displays, figuring on-floor assort-
ments, completing transactions, arranging delivery or pickup, processing returns and damaged 
goods, monitoring pilferage, and controlling merchandise. See Figure 15-6. Good distribution 
management is key.
Items may be shipped from suppliers to warehouses (for storage and disbursement) or directly 
to retailers’ store(s). The Walgreens drugstore chain has fully automated warehouses that stock 
thousands of products and speed their delivery to stores. Amazon.com uses U.S. and international 
fulfillment centers and warehouses that it operates itself, as well as fulfillment centers that are 
operated under co-sourcing arrangements.
One important emerging technology that may greatly advance the merchandise tracking and 
handling process for retailers involves an RFID (radio frequency identification) system—a 
method of storing and remotely retrieving data using devices called RFID tags or transponders. 
In an RFID system, information is sent via RFID tags by a reader that uses radio waves. In a pas-
sive system, which is the most often utilized, an RFID reader provides the power for the tag to 
Buyers for membership (warehouse) clubs and off-price chains 
such as Burlington Coat Factory (now known simply as Bur-
lington) and Marshall’s often engage in opportunistic buying. 
Buyers for specialty stores and department stores—who buy 
much of their merchandise from traditional sources—purchase 
merchandise 8 to 10 weeks ahead of the selling season, pur-
chase a full range of sizes and colors, and are strictly governed 
by open-to-buy restrictions. In contrast, opportunistic buyers 
purchase goods from a variety of nonrecurring sources, often 
acquire end-of-season merchandise, may purchase odd lots (bro-
ken sizes), and are less constrained by budgets developed at the 
beginning of a year. Opportunistic buying results in retail prices 
so low that many shoppers can’t resist, even though an item was 
not on their shopping list.
Evaluate the pros and cons of an opportunistic buyer’s pur-
chasing end-of-season merchandise versus broken lots (unequal 
size distributions) for men’s clothing.

communicate with the reader. In an active system, a battery in the RFID tag boosts the effective 
geographic range of the tag and supports other features not available with passive tags, such as 
sensing temperature changes in the environment. Data from RFID tags go through communication 
interfaces to host computers in a manner similar to that involving barcode labels—with data sent 
to computer systems to interpret, store, and act upon.
In comparison to a barcode, an RFID system has greater range and speed. An RFID tag can 
be read from many feet between the tag and a scanner. In addition, unlike a barcode, the RFID tag 
does not have to be passed along the line of sight of the scanner. There are two types of RFID tags: 
passive and active. Passive tags have unpowered chips that are programmed with data. These 
tags must be near a hand-held or fixed-position reader to be read. With passive RFID tags, the tags 
and reader can be purchased from different manufacturers. Active tags are internally powered, and 
can be read from a range of several hundred feet and located in a single central location. These 
tags and machinery are proprietary and must be purchased from the same manufacturer.
One study found that 78 percent of retailers received at least some RFID tagged merchandise 
(mostly apparel and footwear). On average, 40 percent of items made by apparel and general 
merchandise manufacturers have RFID tags.9 Suppliers are responsible for most of the work and 
costs. The costs for an RFID system include computer equipment, network configuration, backup 
systems, software, cabling, and installation. Fortunately, the price of RFID tags has dropped to 
10 cents for a basic passive RFID tag and $15 to $20 for an active RFID tag.10
Macy’s is aware that, even though the accuracy of inventory data is 95 percent or better at 
the warehouse level, it’s very different at the store level. Because of such factors as pilferage and 
errors associated with the checkout procedure (a cashier can scan the same shirt three times, when 
a customer purchases three different colors), inventory accuracy at the store level can be 60 to 
70 percent during the holiday season. Macy’s began using RFID technology in 2011, initially 
to maintain inventory information on a group of products (denim, men’s basics, and women’s 
intimate apparel) that accounted for 30 percent of sales. Due to the RFID success with these goods, 
Macy’s now uses RFID tags to allow fulfillment of omnichannel orders where only one unit is 
shown to be available in-store. Prior to RFID adoption, inventory counts—especially when only 
one unit was listed as being in inventory—were not reliable.11
At present, RFID use is still somewhat limited. It is too early to predict how widespread RFID 
use will be or how long it will take to be accepted by most retailers and their suppliers. Suppliers 
are responsible for most of the work and costs. The current costs for an RFID system range from 
under $100,000 to $300,000 for a small or medium-sized supplier to several million dollars for a 
large supplier. Both retailers (such as Macy’s, Lululemon, and Athletica) and suppliers (such as 
Levi Strauss and Co.) benefit from using RFID systems.
Item-level RFID tagging at the source improves inventory accuracy by up to 80 percent, stock 
visibility and availability, and loss prevention, and allows identification of an item throughout an 
entire supply chain of an omnichannel retailer. RFID tags in apparel retailing can typically cut 
out-of-stocks by up to 50 percent, saving 80 percent of the time needed for inventory management. 
Item-level RFID tagging by suppliers at source also reduces chargebacks, efficiently audits every 
item in cartons without opening them, and reduces inventory audit and packing times.12
As orders are received, they must be checked for completeness and product condition. 
Invoices must be reviewed for accuracy and payments made as specified. This step cannot be 
taken for granted.
At this point, prices and inventory information are marked on merchandise. Supermarkets 
estimate that price marking on individual items costs them an amount equal to their annual profits. 
Marking can be done in various ways. Small firms may hand-post prices and manually keep inven-
tory records. Some retailers use their own computer-generated price tags and rely on pre-printed 
UPC data on packages to keep records. Others buy tags, with computer- and human-readable price 
and inventory data, from outside suppliers. Still others expect vendors to provide source tag-
ging. An inventory system works best when there are more data on labels or tags. With portable 
devices, UPC-based labels can be printed and connected to store computers.
Store displays and on-floor quantities and assortments depend on the retailer and products 
involved. Supermarkets have bin-and-rack displays and place most inventory on the sales floor. 
Traditional department stores have all kinds of interior displays and place a lot of inventory 
off the sales floor. See Figure 15-7. Displays and on-floor merchandising are discussed in 
Chapter 18.

Merchandise handling is not complete until the customer buys and receives it from a retailer. 
This means order taking, credit or cash transactions, packaging, and delivery or pickup. Automa-
tion has improved retailer performance in each of these areas.
A procedure for processing returns and damaged goods is needed. A retailer must determine 
the party responsible for customer returns (supplier or retailer) and situations in which dam-
aged goods would be accepted for refund or exchange (such as the length of time a warranty is 
honored).
As discussed later in the chapter, more retailers are taking aggressive actions to monitor and 
reduce inventory losses. This is a major problem due to the high costs of merchandise theft.
Merchandise control involves assessing sales, profits, turnover, inventory shortages, sea-
sonality, and costs for each product category and item carried. Control is usually achieved 
by preparing computerized inventory data and doing physical inventories. A physical inventory 
must be adjusted to reflect damaged goods, pilferage, customer returns, and other factors. See  
Figure 15-8. A discussion of this topic appears in Chapter 16.
Merchandise receiving and handling is discussed further later in this chapter.
Reordering Merchandise
Four factors are critical in reordering merchandise that the retailer purchases more than once: 
order and delivery time, inventory turnover, financial outlays, and inventory versus ordering costs.
How long does it take for a retailer to process an order and a supplier to fulfill and deliver 
it? It is possible for delivery time to be so lengthy that a retailer must reorder while having a full 
inventory. On the other hand, overnight delivery may be available for some items.
How long does it take for a retailer to sell out inventory? A fast-selling product gives a retailer 
two choices: (1) order a surplus of items and spread out reorder periods or (2) keep a low inven-
tory and order frequently. A slow-selling item may let a retailer reduce its initial inventory and 
spread out reorders.
What are the financial outlays under various purchase options? A large order, with a quantity 
discount, may require a big cash outlay. A small order, although more expensive per item, results 
in lower total costs at any one time because less inventory is held.
There are trade-offs between inventory holding and ordering costs. A large inventory fosters 
customer satisfaction, volume discounts, low per-item shipping costs, and easier handling. It 
also means high investments; greater obsolescence and damages; and storage, insurance, and

opportunity costs. Placing many orders and keeping a small inventory mean a low investment, 
low opportunity costs, low storage costs, and little obsolescence. Yet, there may be disappointed 
customers if items are out of stock, higher unit costs, adverse effects from order delays, a need for 
partial shipments, service charges, and complex handling. Retailers try to hold enough stock to 
satisfy customers yet not having a high surplus. Quick response inventory planning lowers inven-
tory and ordering costs via close retailer–supplier relationships.
Re-evaluating on a Regular Basis
A merchandising plan should be re-evaluated regularly, with management reviewing the buying 
organization and that organization assessing the implementation. The overall procedure, as well 
as the handling of individual goods and services, should be monitored. Conclusions during this 
stage become part of the information-gathering stage for future efforts.
LOGISTICS
Logistics is the total process of planning, implementing, and coordinating the physical move-
ment of merchandise from manufacturer (wholesaler) to retailer to customer in the most timely, 
effective, and cost-efficient manner possible. Logistics regards order processing and fulfillment, 
transportation, warehousing, customer service, and inventory management as interdependent func-
tions in the value delivery chain. If a logistics system works well, firms reduce stockouts, hold 
down inventories, and improve customer service—all at the same time. See Figure 15-9.
Logistics can also be quite challenging. Consider the case of Supervalu, the largest pub-
lic grocery wholesaler in the U. S. as well as a retailer that owns the Cub Foods, Farm Fresh, 
Save-A-Lot, Fresh Market, and other chains. Supervalu is the primary grocery supplier to more 
than 2,000 single-store and independent grocers and the military. Its network of 18 distribution 
centers and more than 11 million square feet of facilities is part of a multitiered logistics system 
that provides order accuracy and strong service while meeting tight delivery schedules. The 
distribution centers offer support for grocery products across a range of categories, including 
meat, deli, bakery, grocery, frozen foods, and dairy, as well as home-and-beauty-care items, gen-
eral merchandise, and pharmacy items. Customer service professionals work around the clock 
to support distribution customers. The center in Denver handles more than 100,000 customer 
contacts monthly.13
In this section, we discuss these logistics concepts: performance goals, the supply chain, 
order processing and fulfillment, transportation and warehousing, and customer transactions and 
customer service. Inventory management is covered in the final section of this chapter.

Performance Goals
Among retailers’ major logistics goals are to:
▶
▶Match the costs incurred to specific logistics activities, thereby fulfilling all activities as 
­economically as possible, given the firms’ other performance objectives.
▶
▶Place and receive orders as easily, accurately, and satisfactorily as possible.
▶
▶Minimize the time between ordering and receiving merchandise.
▶
▶Coordinate shipments from various suppliers.
▶
▶Have enough merchandise on hand to satisfy customer demand, without having so much 
inventory that heavy markdowns will be necessary.

performance.
In recycling (also known as “downcycling”), a product is bro-
ken down and then reconstituted as another product. This 
process requires the expenditure of energy. “Upcycling” trans-
forms an otherwise disposable good into something of higher 
quality. Looptworks (www.looptworks.com) is an example of a 
firm engaged in upcycling. It makes fashion accessories, gear, 
and apparel from textile waste fabrics that would otherwise be 
burned or placed in garbage dumps. Looptworks partners with 
major brands and corporations by providing ecologically based 
solutions to handle those firms’ excess capacity. Among the items 
made from “pre-consumer excess” materials is its MotoTri-Fold 
wallet that is upcycled from materials that were used in motor-
cycle jackets.
Why haven’t more firms engaged in upcycling?

Innovel Solutions, formerly called Sears Logistics Services (SLS), is the sole point of contact 
for virtually all logistical activity at Sears and Kmart. It transports apparel and other products 
from manufacturers’ facilities to store shelves and manages other transportation and warehousing 
services. The nationwide home-delivery business for appliances, electronics, furniture, and home 
improvement goods from 106 delivery hubs in the Sears network is a profit center for the retailer. 
Its 1,100-truck delivery service provides the same service for some rivals, such as Costco.14
Supply Chain Management
The supply chain is the logistics aspect of a value delivery chain. It comprises all the parties 
that participate in the retail logistics process: manufacturers, wholesalers, third-party specialists 
(shippers, order-fulfillment houses, and so forth), and the retailer. For posts related to supply chain 
management, visit our blog site (www.bermanevansretail.com).
Many retailers and suppliers are seeking closer logistical relationships. One technique for 
larger retailers is collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment (CPFR)—a holistic 
approach to supply-chain management among a network of trading partners. According to the 
Voluntary Interindustry Commerce Standards Association, hundreds of leading manufacturers, 
service providers, and retailers (including Best Buy, Kohl’s, Macy’s, J. C. Penney, QVC, Staples, 
Target, Walgreens, and Walmart) have participated in CPFR programs.
Yet, retailers implementing CPFR must take into account the challenges associated with total 
implementation costs and determine whether they are at a competitive disadvantage. Aligning 
business goals and making internal changes can be challenging. Collaborative relationships mean 
that practices benefiting one party must be discontinued or modified if they are not rewarding to 
a partner. Examples include “channel stuffing” or “trade loading,” wherein a retailer is persuaded 
to periodically absorb larger-than-needed replenishment orders to help a supplier. Trust is a major 
hurdle in implementing CPFR, as many retailers and suppliers may be unwilling to share informa-
tion that reduces their ability to negotiate.15
Omnichannel retailers often rely on third-party logistics (3PL), sometimes called outsourc-
ing. Third-party logistics companies work closely with retail businesses of all sizes to provide 
such supply chain processes as warehouse management, transportation of goods, reporting and 
forecasting, and managing return logistics without long-term or inflexible capital costs, leases, or 
staffing. For example, many retailers (including online firms) with cyclical or uneven sales, rapid 
sales growth, or a weak logistics infrastructure rely on UPS Supply Chain Solutions, a division 
of United Parcel Service, as their logistics specialist. This allows the retailers to focus on their 
retail strategy, stay competitive, and be able to maintain profit margins. Logistics specialists can 
optimize distribution and transportation networks, and streamline global supply chains.16
The Web is a growing force in supplier–retailer communications. A number of manufacturers 
and retailers have set up dedicated sites exclusively to interact with their channel partners. For 
confidential data exchanges, passwords, and secure encryption technology are utilized. Target Cor-
poration has a very advanced Web site called Partners Online, which took several years to develop 
and test. At the Web site, vendors can access sales data and inventory reports, accounts payable 
figures, invoices, and report cards on their performance. There are also manuals and newsletters.
Order Processing and Fulfillment
To optimize order processing and fulfillment, many firms now engage in quick response (QR) 
inventory planning, by which a retailer reduces the amount of inventory it holds by ordering 
more frequently and in lower quantity. A QR system requires a retailer to have good relationships 
with suppliers, coordinate shipments, monitor inventory levels closely to avoid stockouts, and 
regularly communicate with suppliers by electronic data interchange (via the Web or direct PC 
connections) and other means.
The CPFR Committee 
(www.vics.org/committees/
cpfr) is actively working to 
expand the use of integrated 
supply chain planning.
Target’s Partners Online 
program (www 
.partnersonline.com) is 
a proactive relationship

CHAPTER 15   •  Implementing Merchandise Plans

For the retailer, a QR system reduces inventory costs, minimizes the space required for 
storage, and lets the firm better match orders with market conditions—by replenishing stock 
more quickly. For the manufacturer, a QR system can also improve inventory turnover and better 
match supply and demand by giving the vendor the data to track actual sales. These data were 
less available in the past. In addition, an effective quick response system makes it more unlikely 
that a retailer would switch suppliers. The most active users of QR are department stores, full-
line discount stores, apparel stores, home centers, supermarkets, and drugstores. Among the firms 
using QR are Dillard’s, Giant Food, Home Depot, Limited Brands, Macy’s, J. C. Penney, Sears, 
Target Corporation, and Walmart.
A QR system works best in conjunction with floor-ready merchandise, lower minimum order 
sizes, properly formatted store fixtures, and electronic data interchange (EDI). Floor-ready mer-
chandise refers to items received at the store that are pre-tagged, with a UPC ticket marked with 
necessary information specified by the retailer such as style, size, type, color, and price (retailer 
price or suggested retail price or both) and placed on hangers so the items can be put directly on 
display without any preparation by retail workers. For example, Nordstrom requires that all mer-
chandise displayed on hangers on the selling floor be shipped on floor-ready hangers, packed to 
prevent wrinkling. Nordstrom’s requirements for floor-ready merchandise differ for its full-line 
stores versus Nordstrom Rack stores. Suppliers must also be able to receive or transmit an EDI 
purchase order. Nordstrom charges an expense offset fee for merchandise not in compliance, so 
merchandise can be moved to the selling floor quickly with minimal handling.17
Quick response also means suppliers need to rethink the minimum order sizes they will 
accept. Although a minimum order size of 12 for a given size or color was once required by sheet 
and towel makers, minimum order size is now as low as 2 units. Also, minimum orders for men’s 
shirts have been reduced from six to as few as two units. The lower order sizes have led some 
retailers to refixture in-store departments. Previously, fixtures were often set up on the basis of 
a retailer’s stocking full inventories. Today, the retailer must make a visual impact with smaller 
inventories.
Electronic data interchange (described in Chapter 8), allows retailers to do QR inventory 
planning efficiently—via a paperless, computer-to-computer relationship between retailers and 
vendors. Research suggests that retail prices could be reduced by an average of 10 percent with 
the industrywide usage of QR and EDI. Lean supply chain management uses Web-based tools to 
implement collaborative, real-time synchronization of product transfers; exchange vital market-
place information; utilize logistics delivery capabilities for faster responses to consumer demand; 
and increase profitability for supply chain partners. Rigorously identifying and eliminating waste 
(all non-necessary activities that do not add value) to continuously improve processes is a vital 
function in lean supply-chain management. Major retailers such as Costco and Walmart—as well 
as their suppliers—use lean supply-chain management to drive down costs and pass savings to 
customers.18
Many firms in the food sector of retailing are using efficient consumer response (ECR) 
planning, which permits supermarkets to incorporate aspects of quick response inventory plan-
ning, electronic data interchange, and logistics planning. Efficient customer response focuses 
on developing a responsive, consumer-driven system in which manufacturers, brokers, and 
distributors work together to maximize consumer value and minimize supply chain costs by 
better transferring data, automating administration processes, and unifying replenishment 
cycles. Although ECR has enabled supermarkets to cut tens of billions of dollars in distribution 
costs, applying it has not been easy. Many supermarkets are unwilling to trade their ability to 
negotiate short-term purchase terms with vendors in return for routine order fulfillment without 
special deals.19
Retailers are also addressing two other aspects of order processing and fulfillment. (1) With 
advanced ship notices, retailers that utilize QR and EDI receive an alert when bills of lading are 
sent electronically as soon as a shipment leaves the vendor. This gives the retailers more time to 
efficiently receive and allocate merchandise. (2) Because more retailers are buying from mul-
tiple suppliers, from multilocation sources, and from overseas, they must better coordinate order 
placement and fulfillment. Home Depot, among others, has added an import logistics group to 
coordinate overseas forecasting, ordering, sourcing, and logistics; and Supervalu is addressing the 
complexity of buying products from so many different countries around the globe.
ECR Europe (www.gs1 
.ch/en/prozesse/studies/
ecr-europe) has taken a lead 
role in trying to popularize 
this business tool.

Transportation and Warehousing
Several transportation decisions are necessary:
▶
▶How often will merchandise be shipped to the retailer?
▶
▶How will small order quantities be handled?
▶
▶What shipper will be used (the manufacturer, the retailer, or a third-party specialist)? 
▶
▶What transportation form will be used? Are multiple forms required (such as manufacturer 
trucks to retailer warehouses and retailer trucks to individual stores)? See Figure 15-10.
▶
▶What are the special considerations for perishables and expensive merchandise?
▶
▶How often will special shipping arrangements be necessary (such as rush orders)?
▶
▶How are shipping terms negotiated with suppliers?
▶
▶What delivery options will be available for the retailer’s customers? This is a critical decision 
for nonstore retailers, especially those selling through the Web.
Transportation effectiveness is influenced by the caliber of the logistics infrastructure (includ-
ing access to refrigerated trucks, airports, waterway docking, and superhighways), traffic conges-
tion, parking, and other factors. Retailers operating outside the United States must come to grips 
with the logistical problems in many foreign countries, where the transportation network and the 
existence of modern technology may be severely lacking.
Some retailers focus on warehouses as central or regional distribution centers. Products are 
sent from suppliers to these warehouses, and then allotted and shipped to individual stores. Claire’s 
Stores has its central buying and store operations offices, as well as its North American distribution 
center, in Hoffman Estates, Illinois. The distribution facility has over 370,000 square feet of space. 
Toys “R” Us has separate regional distribution centers for the U.S. stores and its international 
stores. Most centers are owned; some are leased.
Other retailers, including many supermarket chains, do not rely as much on central or regional 
warehouses. Instead, they have at least some goods shipped right from suppliers to individual 
stores through direct store delivery (DSD).  This approach works best with retailers that also 
utilize electronic data interchange. It is a way to move high turnover, high bulk, perishable prod-
ucts from the manufacturer directly to the store. The items most apt to involve DSD (such as 
beverages, bread, and snack foods) typically have shelf lives of 60 days or less, whereas ware-
housed items have an average shelf life of one year or more. More than one-quarter of the typical 
supermarket’s sales are from items with DSD. Manufacturers or suppliers assume costs and 
responsibility for demand-driven delivery, inventory management, and merchandising; DSD 
trucks are “mobile warehouses” that reduce retailers’ operating costs.20
The advantages of central warehousing are the efficiency in transportation and storage, mech-
anized processing of goods, improved security, efficient merchandise marking, ease of returns,

and coordinated merchandise flow. Key disadvantages are the excessive centralized control, extra 
handling of perishables, high costs for small retailers, and potential ordering delays. Centralized 
warehousing may also reduce the capability of QR systems by adding another step.
Direct store delivery offers retailers the opportunity to grow, increase stock turnover, improve 
cash flow, and drive higher volumes and margins. Suppliers provide value-added services in the 
form of in-store forecasting, shelf-sensing, demand-driven replenishment, trade promotions, and 
co-op funds. A direct-to-store model can help mitigate risks for high-value goods such as jewelry 
that are challenged with security issues and product theft. However, DSD delivery trucks cannot be 
used for products that require pallet display execution or for delivery to small-format convenience 
stores. Tight control of delivery times and customer service to ensure there are no stock-outs 
require a lot of scheduling precision, which means that all DSD channel members must have real-
time access to all relevant interactions, information, and applications— from product availability, 
to scheduling, to sales data, to demand-generating activities. Determining the optimal routes for 
deliveries to multiple retail outlets can be complicated. There are many variables to consider, such 
as traffic patterns, speed limits, distance, and time calculations.21
Customer Transactions and Customer Service
Retailers must plan for outbound logistics (as well as inbound logistics): completing transactions by 
turning over merchandise to customers. This can be as simple as having a shopper take an item from 
a display area to the checkout counter or driving his or her car to a loading area. It can also be as com-
plex as concluding a Web transaction that entails shipments from multiple vendors to the customer. A 
shopper’s purchase of a computer, a tablet, and a refrigerator from Rakuten.com may result in three 
separate shipments. That is why UPS, Federal Express, and others are doing more home deliveries 
of packages. They can readily handle the diversity of shipping requests that retailers often cannot.
Even basic deliveries can have a breakdown. Think of the local pharmacy whose high school 
delivery person fails to come to work one day—or the pizzeria that gets no customer orders 
between 2:00 P.M. and 5:00 P.M. and 25 delivery orders between 5:00 P.M. and 7:00 P.M.
There are considerable differences between store-based and nonstore retailers. Most retail 
stores know that the customer wants to take the purchase or pick it up when it is ready (such as a 
new car). All direct marketers, including Web retailers, are responsible for ensuring that products 
are delivered to the shopper’s door or another convenient nearby location.
Customer service expectations are affected by logistical effectiveness. That is why Amazon 
.com emphasizes excellent logistics and fulfills orders at different levels of service to its direct 
customers (Prime versus regular) to meet its goal of delighting every customer. In the United 
States, its Fulfillment by Amazon service provides storage, packing, and shipping for independent 
merchants selling products on Amazon’s Web site. In 2015, Amazon opened up four university 
brick-and-mortar bookstores and started operating 43 urban U.S. distribution facilities (Prime Now 
hubs and Fresh Delivery stations) to enable click-to-door delivery in 60 minutes or less. Interna-
tional fulfillment is outsourced or cosourced through delivery networks of third-party logistics 
firms and digital delivery. Amazon even owns French package delivery service Colis Prive to serve 
European customers. Its proposed Global Supply Chain initiative will set up a global delivery 
network controlling the flow of goods from factories in China and India to customer doorsteps in 
the United States and Europe.22
Retailers have been fighting against inventory shrinkage for 
decades. But when the “National Retail Security Survey” was 
published every year, they’d see only marginal improvements. Not 
recently, however: The retail industry has seen good improvements, 
although retailers still report tens of billions of dollars in losses. “It’s 
a pretty remarkably low number, which is good news for the retail-
ers,” says Richard Hollinger, an author of the study and professor 
of sociology, criminology, and law at the University of Florida. “Not 
all retailers report their shrinkage, so it’s not a complete examina-
tion of every retailer, but in general it’s a good trend.”
How would you encourage employees to help reduce retail 
inventory shrinkage even further?

Part 6  •  Merchandise Management and Pricing
INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
As part of its logistics efforts, a retailer utilizes inventory management to acquire and maintain a 
proper merchandise assortment while ordering, shipping, handling, storing, displaying, and selling 
costs are kept in check. First, a retailer places an order based on a sales forecast or actual customer 
behavior. Both the number of items and their variety are requested when ordering. Order size and 
frequency depend on quantity discounts and inventory costs. Second, a supplier fills the order and 
sends the merchandise to a warehouse or directly to the store(s). Third, the retailer receives the 
products, makes items available for sale (by removing them from packing, marking prices, and 
placing them on the sales floor), and completes customer transactions. Some transactions are not 
concluded until the items are delivered to the customer. The cycle starts anew as a retailer places 
another order. Let’s look at these aspects of inventory management: retailer tasks, inventory levels, 
merchandise security, reverse logistics, and inventory analysis.
Retailer Tasks
Due to the comprehensive nature of inventory management, and to be more cost-effective, some 
retailers now expect suppliers to perform more tasks or ship floor-ready merchandise, or they 
outsource at least part of their inventory management activities rather than accept warehouse-
ready merchandise as in the 1990s. Today, and in the future, more manufacturers will shift to 
consumer-ready manufacturing where the links between producer and consumer will be more 
direct.23 Here are some examples:
▶
▶Walmart and other retailers count on key suppliers to participate in their inventory manage-
ment programs. Industrywide, this practice is known as vendor-managed inventory (VMI). 
Procter & Gamble even has its own employees stationed at Walmart headquarters to manage 
the inventory replenishment of that manufacturer’s products.24
▶
▶Target Corporation is at the forefront of another trend—store-based retailers doing their own 
customer order fulfillment for their online, especially mobile, businesses (as those businesses 
grow) or partnering with on-demand logistics companies such as Instacart to provide a menu 
of flexible services to customers. Services include regular online delivery, online with 1- to 
2-hour delivery, ship from store, curbside pickup, and Target subscriptions for repeat purchas-
ers. Target’s Cartwheel and Curbside mobile apps account for 40 percent of digital orders and 
go beyond providing promotional discounts to serving in-store customer assistants, creating 
a personalized in-store experience, or offering an ordering portal that provides drive-thru 
service.25
▶
▶According to the National Association for Retail Merchandising Services (www.narms.com), 
well over $3 billion annually in retail merchandising services—ranging from reordering to 
display design—are provided by specialized firms. An example is New Concepts in Market-
ing, which has provided ordering and inventory control, promotional selling, display place-
ment, and other services for such clients as Babies “R” Us, Kmart, Publix, and Sam’s Clubs.
One contentious inventory management activity involves who is responsible for tagging: the 
manufacturer or the retailer? In source tagging, antitheft tags are put on items when they are made, 
rather than at the store. Although both sides agree on the benefits of this, in terms of reduced costs 
and floor-readiness of merchandise, there are disagreements about who should pay for the tags.
Inventory Levels
Having the proper inventory on hand is a difficult balancing act:
1.	 The retailer wants to be appealing and never lose a sale by being out of stock. Yet, it does not 
want to be “stuck” with excess merchandise that must be marked down drastically.
2.	 The situation is more complicated for retailers that carry fad merchandise, handle new items 
for which there is no track record, and operate in new business formats where demand esti-
mates are often inaccurate. Thus, inventory levels must be planned in relation to the products 
involved: staples, assortment merchandise, fashion merchandise, fads, and best-sellers.
3.	 Customer demand is never completely predictable—even for staple items. Weather, special 
sales, and other factors can have an impact on even the most stable items.
4.	 Shelf space allocations should be linked to current revenues, which means that allocations 
must be regularly reviewed and adjusted.

CHAPTER 15   •  Implementing Merchandise Plans	
399	
One of the advantages of QR and EDI is that retailers hold “leaner” inventories because they 
receive new merchandise more often. Yet, when merchandise is especially popular or the supply 
chain breaks down, stockouts may still occur. A Food Marketing Institute study found that even 
supermarkets, which carry more staples than most other retailers, lose 3 percent of sales due to 
out-of-stock goods.
Inventory level planning is discussed further in the next chapter.
Merchandise Security
Each year, tens of billions of dollars in U.S. retail sales—are lost due to inventory shrinkage 
caused by employee theft, customer shoplifting, vendor fraud, organized crime, and administra-
tive errors. According to the National Retail Security Survey 2015, shoplifting accounts for 38 
percent of overall shrinkage, employee theft 34.5 percent, administrative and paperwork errors 
16.5 percent, vendor fraud or error 6.8 percent, and unknown loss 4.2 percent.26
The overall shrinkage for the United States is about 1.4 percent of sales. This means a small 
store with $500,000 in annual sales might lose up to $7,000 or more due to shrinkage, and a large 
store with $20 million in sales might lose up to $280,000 or more due to shrinkage. Thus, some 
form of merchandise security is needed by all retailers. Theft prevention devices include smart 
tagging (which uses radio frequency identification to track stolen goods), exit sensors (that make 
loud sounds when a thief exits the store), and source tagging (tags sewn into garments).
To reduce merchandise theft, there are three key points to consider: (1) Loss-prevention 
measures should be incorporated as stores are designed and built. The placement of entrances, 
dressing rooms, and delivery areas is critical. (2) A combination of security measures should be 
enacted, such as employee background checks, in-store guards, electronic security equipment, and 
merchandise tags. (3) Retailers must communicate the importance of loss prevention to employ-
ees, customers, and vendors—and the actions they are prepared to take to reduce losses (such as 
firing workers and prosecuting shoplifters).
The following activities are reducing losses from merchandise theft:
▶
▶Product tags, guards, video cameras, point-of-sale computers, employee surveillance, and 
burglar alarms are being used by more firms. Storefront protection is also popular. See the 
left side of Figure 15-11.
▶
▶Many general merchandise retailers and some supermarkets use electronic article 
­surveillance—whereby special tags are attached to products so that the tags can be sensed 
by electronic security devices at store exits. If the tags are not removed by store personnel or 
desensitized by scanning equipment, an alarm goes off. Retailers also have access to nonelec-
tronic tags. These are snugly attached to products and must be removed by special detachers; 
otherwise products are unusable. Dye tags permanently stain products, if not removed prop-
erly. See the right side of Figure 15-11.
▶
▶A number of retailers do detailed background checks for each prospective new employee. 
Some use loss-prevention software that detects suspicious employee behavior.
▶
▶Various retailers have employee training programs and offer incentives for reducing merchan-
dise losses. Others use written policies on ethical behavior that are signed by all personnel, 
including senior management. Target has enrolled managers at problem stores in a Stock 
Sensormatic (www 
.sensormatic.com) is a 
leader in electronic security.
A major problem for Web-based merchants with foreign sales 
is the need to process purchases made by foreign shoppers. A 
number of firms specialize in redeeming sales paid for in mul-
tiple foreign currencies. Authorize.Net (www.authorize.net) is 
the largest online payment gateway. In addition to online trans-
actions, Authorize.Net is able to accept foreign credit cards and 
E-checks used in a retail store. It also offers fraud detection, is 
synchronized with QuickBooks, and handles automated recur-
ring billing for subscription-based customers. Authorize.Net 
charges a transaction fee of 2.9 percent plus $.30. There is also 
a nominal one-time set up fee of $49 and a monthly gateway 
fee of $25.

Shortage Institute. Neiman Marcus has shown workers a film with interviews of convicted 
shoplifters in prison to highlight the problem’s seriousness.
▶
▶More retailers are apt to fire employees and prosecute shoplifters involved with theft. Courts 
are imposing stiffer penalties; in some areas, store detectives are empowered by police to 
make arrests. In more than 40 states, there are civil restitution laws; shoplifters must pay for 
stolen goods or face arrests and criminal trials. In most states, fines are higher if goods are 
not returned or are damaged. Shoplifters must also contribute to court costs.
▶
▶Some mystery shoppers are hired to watch for shoplifting, not just to research behavior.
Figure 15-12 presents a list of tactics retailers can use to combat employee and shopper theft, 
by far the leading causes of losses.
When devising a merchandise security plan, a retailer must assess the plan’s impact on its 
image, employee morale, shopper comfort, and vendor relations. By setting strict rules for fitting 
rooms (by limiting the number of garments) or placing chains on very expensive coats, a retailer 
may cause some shoppers to avoid this merchandise—or visit another store.
Reverse Logistics
The term reverse logistics encompasses all merchandise flows from the customer and/or the 
retailer back through the supply channel. It typically involves items returned because of a shop-
per’s second thoughts (also called shopper’s remorse), damaged or defective products, or retailer 
overstocking. In the United States, customer returns alone are estimated by the National Retail 
Federation at about 8 percent of total retail merchandise sales, with $16 billion of returns being 
fraudulent. Sometimes, retailers may use closeout firms that buy back unpopular merchandise (at a 
fraction of the original cost) that suppliers will not take back; these firms then resell the goods 
at a deep discount. To avoid channel conflicts, conditions for reverse logistics should be speci-
fied in advance. U.S. firms spend more than $50 billion per year for handling, transportation, and 
processing costs associated with returns.27
These are among the decisions that must be made for reverse logistics:
▶
▶Under what conditions (the permissible time, the condition of the product, etc.) are customer 
returns accepted by the retailer and by the manufacturer?
▶
▶What is the customer refund policy? Is there a fee for returning an opened package?
The Reverse Logistics 
Association (www 
.reverselogisticstrends.com) 
presents a lot of helpful 
information on this topic at 
its Web site.

Inventory Analysis
Inventory status and performance must be analyzed regularly to gauge the success of inven-
tory management. Recent advances in computer software have made such analysis much more 
accurate and timely. According to surveys of retailers, these are the elements of inventory per-
formance that are deemed most important: gross margin dollars, inventory turnover, gross profit 
percentage, gross margin return on inventory, the weeks of supply available, and the average 
in-stock position.
Inventory analysis is discussed further in the next chapter.

Part 6  •  Merchandise Management and Pricing
1.	 To describe the steps in the implementation of merchan-
dise plans.
(a) Information is gathered about target market needs 
and prospective suppliers. Data about shopper needs 
can come from customers, suppliers, personnel, com-
petitors, and others. A want book (want slip) is helpful. 
To acquire information about suppliers, the retailer can 
talk to prospects, attend trade shows, visit merchandise 
marts, and search the Web.
(b) The retailer chooses firm-owned; outside, regu-
larly used; and/or outside, new supply sources. Relation-
ships may become strained with suppliers because their 
goals differ from those of retailers.
(c) The merchandise under consideration is evaluated 
by inspection, sampling, and/or description. The method 
depends on the product and situation.
(d) Purchase terms may be negotiated (as with oppor-
tunistic buying) or uniform contracts may be used. Terms 
must be clear, including delivery date, quantity bought, 
price and payment arrangements, discounts, form of deliv-
ery, and point of transfer. There may be special provisions.
(e) The purchase is concluded automatically or manu-
ally. Sometimes, management approval is needed. The 
transfer of title may take place as soon as the order is 
shipped or not until after merchandise is sold by the 
retailer.
(f) Handling involves receiving and storing, price and 
inventory marking, displays, floor stocking, customer 
transactions, delivery or pickup, returns and damaged 
goods, monitoring pilferage, and control. Radio fre-
quency identification is an emerging technology.
(g) Reorder procedures depend on order and delivery 
time, inventory turnover, financial outlays, and inventory 
versus ordering costs.
(h) Both the overall merchandising procedure and 
specific goods and services must be reviewed.
2.	 To examine the prominent roles of logistics and inven-
tory management in the implementation of merchan-
dise plans. Logistics includes planning, implementing, 
and coordinating the movement of merchandise from 
supplier to retailer to customer. Logistics goals are to 
relate costs to activities, accurately place and receive 
orders, minimize ordering/receiving time, coordinate 
shipments, have proper merchandise levels, place mer-
chandise on the sales floor, process customer orders, 
work well in the supply chain, handle returns effectively 
and minimize damaged goods, monitor performance, 
and have backup plans.
A supply chain covers all parties in the logistics pro-
cess. Collaborative planning, forecasting, and replen-
ishment uses a holistic approach. Third-party logistics 
is more popular than before. Many manufacturers and 
retailers have Web sites to interact with channel partners.
Some retailers engage in quick-response inventory 
planning. Floor-ready merchandise is received at the 
store ready to be displayed. Electronic data interchange 
lets retailers use QR planning through computerized 
supply chain relationships. Numerous supermarkets 
use efficient consumer response. Several transportation 
decisions are needed, as are warehousing choices. Cer-
tain retailers have goods shipped by direct store deliv-
ery. Retailers must also plan outbound logistics, which 
involves completing transactions by turning over mer-
chandise to the customer.
As part of logistics, a retailer uses inventory manage-
ment. Due to its complexity, and to reduce costs, retailers 
may expect suppliers to perform more tasks or they may 
outsource some inventory activities. Vendor-managed 
inventory is growing in popularity.
Having a proper inventory is a balancing act: A 
retailer does not want to lose sales from being out of 
stock nor does it want to be stuck with excess goods. 
Yearly, tens of billions of dollars in U.S. retail sales are 
lost due to employee theft, customer shoplifting, vendor 
fraud, and errors. Many retailers use electronic article 
surveillance, with tags attached to products.
Reverse logistics involves all merchandise flows from 
the customer and/or the retailer back through a supply 
channel. It includes returns due to damages, defects, or 
poor retail sales.
Inventory performance must be analyzed regularly.

Unanticipated markdowns and reductions from planned selling prices can have a devastating  
effect on profits. Alternatives to markdowns, such as holding goods until the end of 
a selling season in the hope of selling them at full price, can result in a lack of fresh 
merchandise, and a need for higher markdowns to sell goods late in the season. Here are 
some strategies to minimize markdowns:
▶
▶Carefully monitor sales throughout the selling season to determine slow-selling goods. 
Consider the maxim, “Early markdowns are the cheapest.”
▶
▶Employ drop shipping, by sending orders directly to customers from suppliers. This enables 
a retailer to increase sales with no inventory or warehousing expenses of its own.
▶
▶Favor suppliers with quick delivery capability. Domestic suppliers may have an edge over 
imported goods on this criterion.
▶
▶Negotiate markdown allowances with major suppliers.
▶
▶Monitor sales across channels and locations. Cross-channel redistribution can avoid 
markdowns.
▶
▶Respond quickly to unexpected sales declines, such as a warm season for coats.
▶
▶Remember that price matching programs count as markdowns.

CHAPTER 16   •  Financial Merchandise Management	
405	
Overview
Through financial merchandise management, a retailer specifies which products (goods and 
services) are purchased, when products are purchased, and how many products are purchased. 
Dollar control involves planning and monitoring a retailer’s financial investment in merchandise 
over a stated period. Unit control relates to the quantities of merchandise a retailer handles during 
a stated period. Dollar investment is determined before assortment decisions are made.
Well-structured financial merchandise plans offer these benefits:
▶
▶The value and amount of inventory in each department and/or store unit during a given period 
are delineated. Stock is balanced, and fewer markdowns may be necessary.
▶
▶The amount of merchandise (in terms of investment) a buyer can purchase during a given 
period is stipulated. This gives a buyer direction.
▶
▶The inventory investment in relation to planned and actual revenues is studied. This improves 
the return on investment.
▶
▶The retailer’s space requirements are partly determined by estimating beginning-of-month 
and end-of-month inventory levels.
▶
▶A buyer’s performance is rated. Various measures may be used to set standards.
▶
▶Stock shortages are determined, and bookkeeping errors and pilferage are uncovered.
▶
▶Slow-moving items are classified—leading to increased sales efforts or markdowns.
▶
▶A proper balance between inventory and out-of-stock conditions is maintained.
Inventory management at multiproduct, multibrand, and multichannel retailers is extremely 
complicated. However, poor inventory control leads to wasted working capital for unsold goods on 
store shelves or warehouses. Selecting the right inventory management software is very important, 
keeping in mind the industry type, company size, and preference for software type: on-premise 
system, software-as-a-service (SaaS) system, and/or a cloud-hosted system.1
This chapter divides financial merchandise management into four areas: methods of account-
ing, merchandise forecasting and budgeting, unit control systems, and financial inventory control. 
The hypothetical Handy Hardware Store illustrates the concepts.
INVENTORY VALUATION: THE COST AND RETAIL METHODS OF 
ACCOUNTING
Retail inventory accounting systems can be complex because they entail a great deal of data (due 
to the number of items sold). A typical retailer’s dollar control system must provide such data 
as the sales and purchases made by that firm during a budget period, the value of beginning and 
ending inventory, markups and markdowns, and merchandise shortages.
Table 16-1 shows a profit-and-loss statement for Handy Hardware Store for January 1, 2016, 
through June 30, 2016. The sales amount is total receipts over this time. Beginning inventory was 
computed by counting merchandise in stock on January 1, 2016—recorded at cost. Purchases (at 
cost) and transportation charges (costs incurred in shipping items from suppliers to the retailer) 
were derived by adding invoice slips for all merchandise bought by Handy in the period.
Together, beginning inventory, purchases, and transportation charges equal the cost of mer-
chandise available for sale. The cost of goods sold equals the cost of merchandise available for 
sale minus the cost value of ending inventory. Sales less cost of goods sold yields gross profit, 
and net profit is gross profit minus retail operating expenses. Because Handy does a physical 
inventory twice yearly, ending inventory was figured by counting the items in stock on June 30, 
2016—recorded at cost (Handy codes each item).
Retailers have data needs that are different from those of manufacturers. Assortments are 
larger. Costs cannot be printed on cartons unless coded (due to customer inspection). Stock short-
ages are higher. Sales are more frequent. Retailers require monthly, not quarterly, profit data.
Two inventory accounting systems are available: (1) The cost accounting system values mer-
chandise at cost plus inbound transportation charges. (2) The retail accounting system values 
merchandise at current retail prices. Let’s study both methods in terms of the frequency with which 
data are obtained, the difficulties of a physical inventory and record keeping, the ease of settling 
insurance claims (if there is inventory damage), the extent to which shortages can be computed, 
and system complexities.

PART 6  •  MERCHANDISE MANAGEMENT AND PRICING
At our blog site (www.bermanevansretail.com), there are posts related to retail accounting 
and inventory valuation.
The Cost Method
With the cost method of accounting, the cost to the retailer of each item is recorded on an 
accounting sheet and/or is coded on a price tag or merchandise container. As a physical inventory 
is done, item costs must be learned, the quantity of every item in stock counted, and total inventory 
value at cost calculated. One way to code merchandise cost is to use a 10-letter equivalency sys-
tem, such as M = 0, N = 1, O = 2, P = 3, Q = 4, R = 5, S = 6, T = 7, U = 8, and V = 9. 
An item coded with STOP has a cost value of $67.23. This technique is useful as an accounting 
tool and for retailers that allow price bargaining by customers (profit per item is easy to compute).
A retailer can use the cost method as it does physical or book inventories. A physical inven-
tory means an actual merchandise count; a book inventory relies on record keeping.
A PHYSICAL INVENTORY SYSTEM USING THE COST METHOD  In a physical inventory system, 
ending inventory—recorded at cost—is measured by counting the merchandise in stock at the 
close of a selling period. Gross profit is not computed until ending inventory is valued. A retailer 
using the cost method along with a physical inventory system derives gross profit only as often 
as it performs a full merchandise count. Because most firms do so just once or twice yearly, a

Although small retailers generally hire accountants or accounting 
firms to prepare financial statements, larger retailers have staff 
accountants and even dedicated accounting departments. There 
are several advantages to an accountant’s working full-time with 
a major retailer as opposed to working for a CPA firm. There is 
some seasonality with accounting work at a retailer (associated 
with preparing quarterly and annual reports), but it is nothing 
like a traditional CPA firm with a tax-preparation practice. Many 
retail accountants begin their careers with CPA firms and decide 
to switch to retailing-based positions. And even though a large 
retailer’s controller may have earned a CPA, this may not be a 
requirement for lower-level positions. Accountants working for 
retailers may need to rethink some of their methods. Unlike 
manufacturers that value inventories at cost, most retailers value 
inventories at retail value. As a staff accountant for a retailer, 
much attention has to be given to calculating deductions from 
retail value—such as markdowns, stock shortages, and employee 
discounts.
Discuss the advantages of a retailer-based career for a CPA 
working at an accounting firm.

physical inventory system alone imposes limits on planning. In addition, a firm might be unable 
to compute inventory shortages (due to pilferage and unrecorded breakage) because ending inven-
tory value is set by adding the costs of all items in stock. It does not compute what the ending 
inventory should be.
A BOOK INVENTORY SYSTEM USING THE COST METHOD  A book (perpetual) inventory system 
avoids the problem of infrequent financial analysis by keeping a running total of the value of all 
inventory on hand at cost at a given time. End-of-month inventory values can be computed without 
a physical inventory, and frequent financial statements can be prepared. In addition, a book inven-
tory lets a retailer uncover stock shortages by comparing projected inventory values with actual 
inventory values through a physical inventory.2
A book inventory is kept by regularly recording purchases and adding them to existing inven-
tory value; sales are subtracted to arrive at the new current inventory value (all at cost). Table 16-2 
shows Handy Hardware’s book inventory system for July 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016; 
the beginning inventory in Table 16-2 is the ending inventory from Table 16-1. Table 16-2 assumes 
that merchandise costs are rather constant and monthly sales at cost are easy to compute. Yet, 
suppose merchandise costs rise. How would inventory value then be computed?
FIFO and LIFO are two ways to value inventory. The FIFO (first-in-first-out) method logi-
cally assumes old merchandise is sold first, while newer items remain in inventory. The LIFO 
(last-in-first-out) method assumes new merchandise is sold first, while older stock remains in 
inventory. FIFO matches inventory value with the current cost structure—the goods in inventory 
are the ones bought most recently, whereas LIFO matches current sales with the current cost 
structure—the goods sold first are the ones bought most recently. When inventory values rise, 
LIFO offers retailers a tax advantage because lower profits are shown.
In Figure 16-1, the FIFO and LIFO methods are illustrated for Handy Hardware’s snow 
blowers for 2016; the store carries only one model of snow blower. Handy knows that it sold 220 
snow blowers in 2016 at an average price of $320. It began 2016 with an inventory of 30 snow 
blowers, purchased for $150 each. During January 2016, it bought 100 snow blowers at $175 
each; from October to December 2016, Handy bought another 150 snow blowers for $225 apiece. 
Because Handy sold 220 snow blowers in 2016, as of the close of business on December 31, it 
had 60 units remaining.
With the FIFO method, Handy assumes its beginning inventory and initial purchases were sold 
first. The 60 snow blowers remaining in inventory would have a cost value of $225 each, a total cost 
of goods sold of $42,250, and a gross profit of $28,150. With the LIFO method, Handy assumes 
the most recently purchased items were sold first and the remaining inventory would consist of 
beginning goods and early purchases. Of the snow blowers remaining in inventory, 30 would have 
a cost value of $150 each and 30 a cost value of $175 apiece, resulting in a total cost of goods sold 
of $46,000 and a gross profit of $24,400. The FIFO method presents a more accurate picture of the 
cost of goods sold and the true cost value of ending inventory. The LIFO method indicates a lower 
profit, leading to the payment of lower taxes but an understated ending inventory value at cost.
There is a large assortment 
of software (www.capterra 
.com/inventory-control-

inventory calculations.

Tools provides good

PART 6  •  MERCHANDISE MANAGEMENT AND PRICING
The retail method of inventory, which combines FIFO and LIFO concepts, is explained 
shortly.
DISADVANTAGES OF COST-BASED INVENTORY SYSTEMS  Cost-based physical and book systems 
have significant disadvantages. First, both require that a cost be assigned to each item in stock 
(and to each item sold). When merchandise costs change, cost-based valuation systems work best 
for firms with low inventory turnover, limited assortments, and high average prices—such as car 
dealers.
Second, neither cost-based method adjusts inventory values to reflect style changes, end-of-
season markdowns, or sudden surges of demand (which may raise prices). Thus, ending ­inventory 
value based on merchandise cost may not reflect its actual worth. This discrepancy could be 
troublesome if inventory value is used in filing insurance claims for losses.
Despite these factors, retailers that make the products they sell—such as bakeries, restaurants, 
and furniture showrooms—often keep records on a cost basis. A department store with these 
operations can use the cost method for them and the retail method for other areas.
The Retail Method
With the retail method of accounting, closing inventory value is determined by calculating the 
average relationship between the cost and retail values of merchandise available for sale during 
a period. Although the retail method overcomes the disadvantages of the cost method, it requires 
detailed records and is more complex because ending inventory is first valued in retail dollars and 
then converted to compute gross margin (gross profit).
The three basic steps to determine ending inventory value by the retail method are:
1.	 Calculating the cost complement
2.	 Calculating deductions from retail value
3.	 Converting retail inventory value to cost
CALCULATING THE COST COMPLEMENT  The value of beginning inventory, net purchases, 
­additional markups, and transportation charges are all included in the retail method. Beginning 
inventory and net purchase amounts (purchases less returns) are recorded at both cost and retail

levels. Additional markups represent the extra revenues received when a retailer increases selling 
prices, due to inflation or unexpectedly high demand. Transportation charges are the retailer’s 
costs for shipping the goods it buys from suppliers to the retailer. Table 16-3 shows the total mer-
chandise available for sale at cost and at retail for Handy Hardware from July 1, 2016, through 
December 31, 2016, using the costs in Table 16-2.
By using Table 16-3 data, the average relationship of cost to retail value for all merchandise 
available for sale by Handy Hardware—the cost complement—can be computed:
 Cost complement = Total cost valuation
Total retail valuation
 = +299,892
+496,126 = 0.6045
Because the cost complement is 0.6045 (60.45 percent), on average, 60.45 cents of every retail 
sales dollar went to cover Handy Hardware’s merchandise cost.
CALCULATING DEDUCTIONS FROM RETAIL VALUE  The ending retail value of inventory must reflect 
all deductions from the total merchandise available for sale at retail. Besides sales, deductions 
include markdowns (for special sales and end-of-season goods), employee discounts, and stock 
shortages (due to pilferage and unrecorded breakage). Although sales, markdowns, and employee 
discounts can be recorded throughout an accounting period, a physical inventory is needed to learn 
about stock shortages.
From Table 16-3, it is known that Handy Hardware had a retail value of merchandise avail-
able for sale of $496,126 for the period from July 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016. As shown 
in Table 16-4, this was reduced by sales of $422,540 and recorded markdowns and employee 
discounts of $14,034. The ending book value of inventory at retail as of December 31, 2016, was 
$59,552.
To compute stock shortages, the retail book value of ending inventory is compared with the 
actual physical ending inventory at retail. If book inventory exceeds physical inventory, a short-
age exists. Table 16-5 shows the results of Handy’s physical inventory. Shortages were $3,082 
(at retail), and book value was adjusted accordingly. Although Handy knows the shortages were

from pilferage, bookkeeping errors, and overshipments not billed to customers, it cannot learn the 
proportion of shortages from each factor.
Occasionally, a physical inventory may reveal a stock overage—an excess of physical inven-
tory value over book value. This may be due to errors in a physical inventory or in keeping a book 
inventory. If overages occur, ending retail book value is adjusted upward. Inasmuch as a retailer 
has to conduct a physical inventory to compute shortages (overages), and a physical inventory 
is usually taken only once or twice a year, shortages (overages) are often estimated for monthly 
merchandise budgets.
CONVERTING RETAIL INVENTORY VALUE TO COST  The retailer must next convert the adjusted 
ending retail book value of inventory to cost so as to compute dollar gross profit (gross margin). 
The ending inventory at cost equals the adjusted ending retail book value multiplied by the cost 
complement. For Handy Hardware, this was:
 Ending inventory (at cost) = Adjusted ending retail book value * Cost complement
 = +56,470 * 0.6045 = +34,136
This computation does not yield the exact inventory cost. It shows the average relationship 
between cost and the retail selling price for all merchandise available for sale.
The adjusted ending inventory at cost can be used to find gross profit. As Table 16-6 shows, 
Handy’s 6-month cost of goods sold was $265,756, resulting in gross profit of $156,784. By 
deducting operating expenses of $139,000, Handy learns that the net profit before taxes for this 
period was $17,784.

ADVANTAGES OF THE RETAIL METHOD  Compared with other techniques, there are several advan-
tages to the retail method of accounting:
▶
▶Valuation errors are reduced when conducting a physical inventory because merchandise value 
is recorded at retail and costs do not have to be decoded.
▶
▶Because the process is simpler, a physical inventory can be completed more often. This lets 
a firm be more aware of slow-moving items and stock shortages.
▶
▶The physical inventory method at cost requires a physical inventory to prepare a profit-and-
loss statement. The retail method lets a firm set up a profit-and-loss statement based on book 
inventory. The retailer can then estimate the stock shortages between physical inventories and 
study departmental profit trends.
▶
▶A complete record of ending book values helps determine insurance coverage and settle 
insurance claims. The retail book method gives an estimate of inventory value throughout 
the year. Because physical inventories are usually taken when merchandise levels are low, 
the book value at retail lets retailers plan insurance coverage for peak periods and shows the 
values of goods on hand. The retail method is accepted in insurance claims.
LIMITATIONS OF THE RETAIL METHOD  The greatest weakness is the bookkeeping burden of 
recording data. Ending book inventory figures can be correctly computed only if the following 
are accurately noted: the value of beginning inventory (at cost and at retail), purchases (at cost and 
at retail), shipping charges, markups and markdowns, employee discounts, transfers from other 
departments or stores, returns, and sales. Although personnel are freed from taking many physical 
inventories, ending book value at retail may be inaccurate unless all required data are precisely 
recorded. With computerization, this potential problem is lessened.
Another limitation is that the cost complement is an average based on the total cost of mer-
chandise available for sale and total retail value. The ending cost value only approximates the true 
inventory value. This may cause misinformation if fast-selling items have different markups from 
slow-selling items or if there are wide variations among the markups of different goods.
Familiarity with the retail and cost methods of inventory is essential for understanding the 
financial merchandise management material described in the balance of this chapter.
MERCHANDISE FORECASTING AND BUDGETING: DOLLAR 
CONTROL
As we noted earlier, dollar control entails planning and monitoring a firm’s inventory investment 
over time. Figure 16-2 shows the six-step dollar control process for merchandise forecasting and 
budgeting. This process should be followed sequentially since a change in one stage affects all the 
stages after it. If a sales forecast is too low, a firm may run out of items because it does not plan 
to have enough merchandise during a selling season and planned purchases will also be too low.
Designating Control Units
Merchandise forecasting and budgeting requires the selection of control units, the merchandise 
categories for which data are gathered. Such classifications must be narrow enough to isolate 
opportunities and problems with specific merchandise lines. A retailer wishing to control goods 
within departments must record data on dollar allotments separately for each category.
Knowing that total markdowns in a department are 20 percent above last year’s level is less 
valuable than knowing the specific merchandise lines in which large markdowns are being taken. 
A retailer can broaden its control system by combining categories that comprise a department. 
However, a broad category cannot be broken down into components.

PART 6  •  MERCHANDISE MANAGEMENT AND PRICING
It is helpful to use control units consistent with company and trade association data. Internal com-
parisons are meaningful only if categories are stable. Classifications that shift over time do not permit 
comparisons. External comparisons are not meaningful if control units are dissimilar for a retailer 
and its trade associations. Control units may be based on departments, classifications in departments, 
price-line classifications, and standard merchandise classifications. A discussion of each follows.
The broadest practical classification for financial records is the department, which lets a 
retailer assess each general merchandise grouping or buyer. Even small Handy Hardware needs 
departmental data (tools and equipment, supplies, housewares, and so on) for buying, inventory 
control, and markdown decisions. For more financial data, classification merchandising can be 
used, with each department subdivided into further categories for related types of merchandise. 
In planning its tools and equipment department, Handy Hardware can keep financial records on 
both overall departmental performance and the results of such categories as lawn mowers/snow 
blowers, power tools, hand tools, and ladders.
A special form of classification merchandising uses price line classifications—sales, inven-
tories, and purchases are analyzed by price category. This helps if distinct models of a product are 
sold at different prices to dissimilar target markets (such as Handy’s having $50 power tools for 
do-it-yourselfers and $135 models for contractors). Retailers with deep assortments most often 
use price line control.
To best contrast its data with industry averages, a firm’s merchandise categories should con-
form to those cited in trade publications. The National Retail Federation devised a standard mer-
chandise classification with common reporting categories for a range of retailers and products. 
Specific classifications are also popular for some retailers. Progressive Grocer regularly publishes 
data based on standard classifications for supermarkets.
Once appropriate dollar control units are set, all transactions—including sales, purchases, 
transfers, markdowns, and employee discounts—must be recorded under the proper classification 
number. Thus, if house paint is Department 25 and brushes are 25-1, all transactions must carry 
these designations.
Sales Forecasting
A retailer estimates its expected future revenues for a given period by sales forecasting. Forecasts 
may be companywide, departmental, and for individual merchandise classifications. Perhaps the 
most important step in financial merchandise planning is accurate sales forecasting, because an 
incorrect projection of sales throws off the entire process. That is why many retailers use state-of-
the-art forecasting software. Unified Grocers has dramatically improved its inventory productivity 
by using such software from SAS.3
Larger retailers often forecast total and department sales by techniques such as trend analysis, 
time-series analysis, and multiple regression analysis. A discussion of these techniques is beyond 
the scope of this book. Small retailers rely more on “guesstimates,” projections based on experi-
ence. Even for larger firms, sales forecasting for merchandise classifications within departments 
(or price lines) relies on more qualitative methods. One way to forecast sales for narrow categories 
is first to project sales on a company basis and then by department, and finally to break down 
figures judgmentally into merchandise classifications.
External factors, internal company factors, and seasonal trends must be anticipated and taken 
into account. Among the external factors that can affect projected sales are consumer trends, 
SAS software is widely 
used in retailing (www.sas 
.com/en_us/industry/retail.​
html).
Retailers with strong buying power often negotiate markdown 
allowances from vendors. These allowances reimburse retail-
ers for markdowns incurred due to goods sold at less than full 
retail suggested price. Types of markdowns include short-term 
allowances to compensate for lost profits during a special sale 
period; allowances for price reductions from full list price for 
end-of-season merchandise; allowances for price reductions due 
to product defects; and allowances for the short life expectancy 
of perishable goods. Critics of markdown allowances feel that 
large chains may be able to negotiate better deals than smaller 
independent retailers. This raises antitrust issues. Others say these 
allowances may be nothing more than an additional discount. 
And since these allowances may not be properly recorded in a 
retailer’s financial statements, they may overstate profits.
Discuss the advantages and disadvantages associated with 
the use of markdown allowances from a vendor’s perspective.

competitors’ actions, the state of the economy, the weather, and new supplier offerings. For exam-
ple, Planalytics offers a patented methodology to analyze and forecast the relationship among 
consumer demand, store traffic, and the weather.4 Internal company factors that can affect future 
sales include additions and deletions of merchandise lines, revised promotion and credit poli-
cies, changes in hours, new outlets, and store remodeling. With many retailers, seasonality must 
be considered in setting monthly or quarterly sales forecasts. Handy’s yearly snow blower sales 
should not be estimated from December sales alone.
A sales forecast can be developed by examining past trends and projecting future growth 
(based on external and internal factors). Table 16-7 shows a sales forecast for Handy Hardware. 
It is an estimate, subject to revisions. Various factors may be hard to incorporate when devising a 
forecast, such as merchandise shortages, consumer reactions to new products, the rate of inflation, 
and new government legislation. That is why a financial merchandise plan needs some flexibility.
After a yearly forecast is derived, it should be broken into quarters or months. In retailing, 
monthly forecasts are typical. Jewelry stores know December accounts for nearly one-quarter of 
annual sales, whereas drugstores know December sales are slightly better than average. Stationery 
stores and card stores realize that Christmas and other holiday cards generate more than 30 percent 
of seasonal greeting card sales, and Valentine’s Day cards are second with about 15 percent.5
To acquire more specific estimates, a retailer could use a monthly sales index that 
divides each month’s actual sales by average monthly sales and multiplies the results by 100. 
Table 16-8 shows Handy Hardware’s 2016 actual monthly sales and monthly sales indexes. The 
store is seasonal, with peaks in late spring and early summer (for lawn mowers, garden sup-
plies, and so on), as well as December (for lighting fixtures, snow blowers, and gifts). Average 
monthly 2016 sales were $70,000 ($840,000/12). Thus, the monthly sales index for January is 
67[(+46,800/+70,000) * 100]; other monthly indexes are computed similarly. Each monthly 
index shows the percentage deviation of that month’s sales from the average month. A May index 
of 160 means May sales are 60 percent higher than average. An October index of 67 means sales 
in October are 33 percent below average.
After monthly sales indexes are determined, a retailer can forecast monthly sales, based on 
the yearly sales forecast. Table 16-9 shows how Handy’s 2017 monthly sales can be forecast if 
average monthly sales are expected to be $73,423.
Inventory-Level Planning
At this point, a retailer plans its inventory. The level must be sufficient to meet sales expectations, 
allowing a margin for error. Techniques to plan inventory levels are the basic stock, percentage 
variation, weeks’ supply, and stock-to-sales methods.
With the basic stock method, a retailer carries more items than it expects to sell over a speci-
fied period. There is a cushion if sales are more than expected, shipments are delayed, or

customers want to select from a variety of items. It is best when inventory turnover is low or sales 
are erratic over the year. Beginning-of-month planned inventory equals planned sales plus a basic 
stock amount:
Basic stock (at retail) = Average monthly stock at retail - Average monthly sales

planned inventory level
(at retail)
= Planned monthly sales + Basic stock

	
CHAPTER 16   •  Financial Merchandise Management

If Handy Hardware, with an average monthly 2017 forecast of $73,423, wants extra stock 
equal to 10 percent of its monthly forecast and expects January 2017 sales to be $49,193:
 Basic stock (at retail) = (+73,423 * 1.10) - +73,423 = +7,342
 
Beginning@of@January
planned inventory level
(at retail)
= +49,193 + +7,342 = +56,535
In the percentage variation method, beginning-of-month planned inventory during any 
month differs from planned average monthly stock by only one-half of that month’s variation 
from estimated average monthly sales. This method is recommended if stock turnover is more than 
six times a year or relatively stable, since it results in planned inventories closer to the monthly 
average than other techniques:
Beginning@of@month
planned inventory level
(at retail)
=
Planned average monthly stock at retail
*1/2 [1 + (Estimated monthly sales/
Estimated average monthly sales)]
If Handy Hardware plans average monthly stock of $80,765 and November 2017 sales are 
expected to be 4 percent less than average monthly sales of $73,423, the store’s planned inventory 
level at the beginning of November 2017 would be:
Beginning@of@November
planned inventory level
(at retail)
= +80,765 * 1/2 [1 + (+70,487/+73,423)] = +79,150
Handy Hardware should not use this method due to its variable sales. If it did, Handy would plan 
a beginning-of-December 2017 inventory of $94,899, less than expected sales ($99,121).
The weeks’ supply method forecasts average sales weekly, so beginning inventory equals 
several weeks’ expected sales. It assumes inventory is in proportion to sales. Too much merchan-
dise may be stocked in peak periods and too little during slow periods:
Beginning@of@Month
planned inventory level
(at retail)
= Average estimated
weekly sales
* Number of weeks
to be stocked
If Handy Hardware forecasts average weekly sales of $10,956.92 from January 1, 2017, 
through March 31, 2017, and it wants to stock 13 weeks of merchandise (based on expected 
turnover), beginning inventory would be $142,440:
Beginning@of@January
planned inventory level
(at retail)
= +10,956.92 * 13 = +142,440
A major development with point-of-sale (POS) systems is their 
evolution from being used as cash registers to being intercon-
nected with other software systems and portable data storage 
devices. Many retailers use POS systems to manage inventory 
within a single channel or across multiple channels. In addition, 
some POS systems capture relevant data for employee manage-
ment (based on customer activity by time of day and day of week) 
and secure customer data used in market research. TouchBistro 
(www.touchbistro.com) has features needed by specific types of 
retailers, such as food establishments. TouchBistro lets the wait 
staff E-mail the chef with an order via an iPad, denotes shared 
meals, applies discounts, and enables credit-card processing on 
an iPad. The Shopkeep POS system (www.shopkeep.com) accepts 
all types of payments (including Apple Pay), automatically tracks 
inventory, keeps a record of the hours worked by each employee, 
and identifies top-performing employees. This information can be 
tracked on all devices at all times.

PART 6  •  MERCHANDISE MANAGEMENT AND PRICING
With the stock-to-sales method, a retailer wants to maintain a specified ratio of goods on 
hand to sales. A ratio of 1.3 means that if Handy Hardware plans sales of $69,018 in April 2017, 
it should have $89,723 worth of merchandise (at retail) available during the month. Like the 
weeks’ supply method, this approach tends to adjust inventory more drastically than changes in 
sales require.
Yearly stock-to-sales ratios by retail type are provided by sources such as Industry Norms & 
Key Business Ratios (New York: Dun & Bradstreet) and Annual Statement Studies (Philadelphia: 
RMA). These sources will allow a retailer to compare its ratios with those of other firms.
Reduction Planning
Besides forecasting sales, a firm should estimate its expected retail reductions, which represent 
the difference between beginning inventory plus purchases during the period and sales plus ending 
inventory. Planned reductions incorporate anticipated markdowns (discounts to stimulate sales), 
employee and other discounts (price cuts to employees, senior citizens, and others), and stock 
shortages (pilferage, breakage, and bookkeeping errors):
Planned reductions = (Beginning inventory + Planned purchases)
- (Planned sales + Ending inventory)
Reduction planning revolves around two key factors: estimating expected total reductions by 
budget period and assigning estimates monthly. The following should be considered in planning 
reductions: past experience, markdown data for similar retailers, changes in company policies, 
merchandise carryover from one budget period to another, price trends, and stock-shortage trends.
Past experience is a good starting point. The data can then be compared with the performance 
of similar firms—by reviewing data on markdowns, discounts, and stock shortages in trade pub-
lications. A retailer with higher markdowns than those of its competitors could investigate and 
correct the situation by adjusting its buying practices and price levels or improve the training of 
sales personnel.
A retailer must consider its own procedures in reviewing reductions. Policy changes often 
affect the quantity and timing of markdowns. If a firm expands its assortment of seasonal and 
fashion merchandise, this would probably lead to a rise in markdowns.
Merchandise carryover, price trends, and stock-shortage trends also affect planning. If such 
items as gloves and antifreeze are stocked in off seasons, markdowns are often not used to clear 
out inventory. Yet, the carryover of fad items merely postpones reductions. Price trends of product 
categories have a strong impact on reductions. Many full computer systems now sell for less than 
$1,000, down considerably from prior years. This means higher-priced computers must be marked 
down. Recent stock shortage trends (comparing prior book and physical inventory values) can 
be used to project future reductions due to employee, customer, and vendor theft; breakage; and 
bookkeeping mistakes. If a firm has stock shortages of less than 2 percent of annual sales, it is 
usually deemed to be doing well. Figure 16-3 shows a checklist to reduce shortages from clerical 
and handling errors. Suggestions for reducing shortages from theft were covered in Chapter 15.
After determining total reductions, they must be planned by month because reductions as a 
percentage of sales are not the same during each month. Stock shortages may be much higher 
during busy periods, when stores are more crowded and transactions happen more quickly.
Planning Purchases
The formula for calculating planned purchases for a period is:
Planned purchases
(at retail)
= Planned sales for the month + Planned reductions for the month
+ Planned end@of@month stock - Beginning@of@month stock
If Handy Hardware projects June 2017 sales to be $108,666 and total planned reductions to 
be 5 percent of sales, plans end-of-month inventory at retail to be $72,000, and has a beginning-
of-month inventory at retail of $80,000, planned purchases for June are:
Planned purchases
(at retail)
= +108,666 + +5,433 + +72,000 - +80,000 = +106,099

	
CHAPTER 16   •  Financial Merchandise Management	
417	
Because Handy Hardware expects 2017 merchandise costs to be about 60 percent of retail 
selling price, its plan is to purchase $63,659 of goods at cost in June 2017:
Planned purchases
(at cost)
= Planned purchases at retail
* Merchandise costs as a percentage of selling price
 = +106,99 * 0.60 = +63,659
Open-to-buy is the difference between planned purchases and the purchase commitments 
already made by a buyer for a given period, often a month. It represents the amount the buyer has 
left to spend for that month and is reduced each time a purchase is made. At the beginning of a 
month, a firm’s planned purchases and open-to-buy are equal if no purchase commitments have 
been made before that month starts. Open-to-buy is recorded at cost.
At Handy Hardware, the buyer has made purchase commitments for June 2017 in the amount 
of $55,000 at retail. Accordingly, Handy’s open-to-buy at retail for June is $51,099:
 Open@to@buy
(at retail)
= Planned purchases for the month
- Purchase commitments for that month
 = +106,099 - +55,000 = +51,099

PART 6  •  MERCHANDISE MANAGEMENT AND PRICING
To calculate the June 2017 open-to-buy at cost, $51,099 is multiplied by Handy Hardware’s 
merchandise costs as a percentage of selling price:
 Open@to@buy
(at cost)
= Open@to@buy at retail
* Merchandise costs as a percentage of selling price
 = +51,099 * 0.60 = +30,659
The open-to-buy concept has two major strengths: (1) It maintains a specified relationship 
between inventory and planned sales, which avoids overbuying and underbuying and (2) it lets a 
firm adjust purchases to reflect changes in sales, markdowns, and so on. If Handy revises its June 
2017 sales forecast to $120,000 (from $108,666), it automatically increases planned purchases 
and open-to-buy by $11,334 at retail and $6,800 at cost.
It is advisable for a retailer to keep at least a small open-to-buy figure for as long as ­possible—
to take advantage of special deals, purchase new models when introduced, and fill in items that 
sell out. An open-to-buy limit sometimes must be exceeded due to underestimated demand (low 
sales forecasts). A retailer should not be so rigid that merchandising personnel are unable to have 
the discretion (employee empowerment) to purchase below-average-priced items when the open-
to-buy is not really open.
Planning Profit Margins
In preparing a profitable merchandise budget, a retailer must consider planned net sales, retail 
operating expenses, profit, and retail reductions in pricing merchandise:
Required initial
markup percentage = Planned retail expenses + Planned profit + Planned reductions
Planned net sales + Planned reductions
The required markup is a firmwide average. Individual items may be priced according to demand 
and other factors, as long as the average is met. The concept of initial markup is introduced here 
for continuity in the description of merchandise budgeting. A fuller discussion on markup can be 
found in Chapter 17.
Handy has an overall 2017 sales forecast of $881,080 and expects annual expenses to be 
$290,000. Reductions are projected at $44,000. The total net dollar profit margin goal is $60,000 
(6.8 percent of sales). Its required initial markup is 42.6 percent:
 Required initial
markup percentage = +290,000 + +60,000 + +44,000
+881,080 + +44,000
= 42.6,
 
Required initial
markup percentage
(all factors expressed
as a percentage of
net sales)
= 32.9, + 6.8, + 5.0,
100.0, + 5.0,
= 42.6,
UNIT CONTROL SYSTEMS
Unit control systems deal with quantities of merchandise in units rather than in dollars. Informa-
tion typically reveals:
▶
▶Items selling well and those selling poorly
▶
▶Opportunities and problems in terms of price, color, style, size, and so on
▶
▶The quantity of goods on hand (if book inventory is used); minimizes overstocking and 
understocking
▶
▶An indication of inventory age, highlighting candidates for markdowns or promotions
▶
▶The optimal time to reorder merchandise
▶
▶Experiences with alternative sources (vendors) when problems arise
▶
▶The level of inventory and sales for each item in every store branch (This improves the 
transfer of goods between branches and alerts salespeople as to which branches have desired 
products. Also, less stock can be held in individual stores, reducing costs.)

Physical Inventory Systems
A physical inventory unit control system is similar to a physical inventory dollar control system. 
However, the latter is concerned with the financial value of inventory, whereas a unit control 
system looks at the number of units by item classification. With unit control, inventory levels are 
monitored either by visual inspection or actual count. See Figure 16-4.
In a visual inspection system, merchandise is placed on pegboard (or similar) displays, with 
each item numbered on the back or on a stock card. Minimum inventory quantities are noted, and 
sales personnel reorder when inventory reaches the minimum level. This is accurate only if items 
are placed in numerical order on displays (and sold accordingly). The system is used in the house-
wares and hardware displays of various discount and hardware stores. Although easy to maintain 
and inexpensive, it does not provide data on the rate of sales of individual items. And minimum 
stock quantities may be arbitrarily defined and not drawn from in-depth analysis.
The other physical inventory system, actual counting, means regularly compiling the number 
of units on hand. This approach records—in units—inventory on hand, purchases, sales volume, 
and shortages for specified periods. A stock-counting system requires more clerical work but lets 
a firm obtain sales data for given periods and stock-to-sales relationships as of the time of each 
count. A physical system is not as sophisticated as a book system. It is more useful with low-value 
items having predictable sales. Handy Hardware could use the system for its insulation tape:

Perpetual Inventory Systems
A perpetual inventory unit control system keeps a running total of the number of units handled 
by a retailer through record keeping entries that adjust for sales, returns, transfers to other depart-
ments or stores, receipt of shipments, and other transactions. All additions to and subtractions from 
beginning inventory are recorded. Such a system can be applied manually, use merchandise tags 
processed by computers, or rely on point-of-sale devices such as optical scanners.

PART 6  •  MERCHANDISE MANAGEMENT AND PRICING
Point-of-sale systems—which are widely used today, even by many small retailers—feed data 
from merchandise tags or product labels directly to in-store computers for immediate data processing. 
Computer-based systems are quicker, more accurate, and of higher quality than manual ones. A manual 
system requires employees to gather data by examining sales checks, merchandise receipts, transfer 
requests, and other documents. Data are then coded and tabulated. A merchandise tagging system relies 
on pre-printed tags with data by department, classification, vendor, style, date of receipt, color, and/or 
material. When an item is sold, a copy of the tag is removed and sent to a tabulating facility for com-
puter analysis. Since pre-printed tags are processed in batches, they can be used by smaller retailers 
that subscribe to service bureaus and by branches of chains (with data processed at a central location).
Current POS systems are easy to network; they have battery backup capabilities and run with 
standard PCs and software. Many of these systems use optical scanners to transfer data from 
products to computers by wands or other devices that pass over sensitized strips on the items. 
Figure 16-5 shows how barcoding works. As noted earlier, the UPC is the dominant format for 
coding data onto merchandise. This is how to interpret a barcode:
1.	 The numbering system contains two (or possibly three) digits to identify the nation (or region) 
that assigns the manufacturer codes in that geographic area. In the typical UPC code, the 
initial number digit is 0—which is not shown on a label.
2.	 The manufacturer code is a series of distinctive numbers assigned to specific manufacturers 
by the coding authority of the nation or region. All of a given company’s products get the 
same manufacturer code—which is usually five numbers.
3.	 The product code is determined by each manufacturer—which can assign any five-digit 
product codes that it wants to designate different products by that company.
4.	 The check digit is an additional number that helps verify that a specific barcode is scanned 
accurately. It is based on the other digits of a barcode.6
Many retailers combine perpetual and physical systems, whereby items accounting for a 
high proportion of sales are controlled by a perpetual system and other items are controlled by 
a physical inventory system. Attention is properly placed on the retailer’s most important products.
Unit Control Systems in Practice
Conducting a physical inventory is extremely time consuming and labor-intensive. It is also 
­crucial: Having too much stock, or too little, is costly. The consulting firm, First Insight, has found 
that each year U.S. retailers lose about $280 billion due to holding excessive inventory.7 And the 
costs of not having sufficient inventory on hand are estimated to be more than $50 billion annually.
Retailers need to determine the “real” cost of excess, unsold inventory—which means consid-
ering not just the invoice and freight costs but also the cost of capital (the funds invested in unsold 
inventory), inventory-carrying costs (insurance and the cost of occupied space in warehouses 
or selling areas), handling costs, theft rates, product obsolescence if items are not sold quickly, 
and the opportunity cost of lost sales. Together, these inventory-related costs can mount up and

have a big impact on profits. Having too much inventory can be as big a problem (or worse) than 
running out of merchandise, due to both the costs and the markdowns that might be necessary to 
move inventory. In some product categories, the marked-down inventory can cannibalize sales of 
full-price products.8 When all additional costs are taken into account, the total cost can be 25 to 
30 percent more than the unit-cost value of the excess inventory.9
FINANCIAL INVENTORY CONTROL: INTEGRATING DOLLAR AND 
UNIT CONCEPTS
Until now, we have discussed dollar and unit control separately. In practice, they are linked. A 
decision on how many units to buy is affected by dollar investments, inventory turnover, quan-
tity discounts, warehousing and insurance costs, and so on. Three aspects of financial inventory 
control are covered next: stock turnover and gross margin return on investment, when to reorder, 
and how much to reorder.
Stock Turnover and Gross Margin Return on Investment
Stock turnover represents the number of times during a specific period, usually 1 year, that the 
average inventory on hand is sold. It can be measured by store, product line, department, and ven-
dor. With high turnover, inventory investments are productive on a per-dollar basis; items are fresh; 
there are fewer losses due to changes in styles; and interest, insurance, breakage, and warehousing 
costs are reduced. A retailer can raise stock turnover by reducing its assortment, eliminating or 
having little inventory for slow-selling items, buying in a timely way, applying quick response 
(QR) inventory planning, and using reliable suppliers.
Stock turnover can be computed in units or dollars (at retail or cost). The choice of a formula 
depends on the retailer’s accounting system:
 
Annual rate of
stock turnover
(in units)
=
Number of units sold during year
Average inventory on hand (in units)
 
Annual rate of
stock turnover
(in retail dollars)
=
Net yearly sales
Average inventory on hand (at retail)
 
Annual rate of
stock turnover
(at cost)
=
Cost of goods sold during the year
Average inventory on hand (at cost)
In computing turnover, average inventory for the entire period needs to be reflected. Turnover 
rates are invalid if the true average is not used, as occurs if a firm mistakenly views the inventory 
level of a peak or slow month as average. Table 16-10 shows turnover rates for various retailers. 
Gas stations, convenience stores, and grocers have the highest rates. They rely on sales volume 
for their success. Jewelry stores, hardware stores, and some clothing stores have very low rates. 
They require larger profit margins on each item sold and maintain a sizable assortment.
Oracle (www.oracle.com/​
industries/retail/index 
.html) markets sophisticated 
inventory analysis software.
Unlike counterfeit products, gray market goods are authentic 
and sourced through nontraditional channels that are not autho-
rized by manufacturers. In gray marketing, retailers analyze price 
differences for goods sold worldwide, and buy the goods where 
the price differential between normal wholesale price levels and 
foreign market prices is big enough to compensate them for 
shipping, inventory holding costs, and product servicing expenses 
(most manufacturers will not provide warranty-related repairs on 
gray market products). Gray market goods also do not qualify for 
cooperative advertising allowances, rebates, or coupon offers. 
Aside from watches, there is a large gray market presence in 
cosmetics, college textbooks, perfumes, and camera equipment.
As a retailer of fine watches selling from $2,000 to $20,000, 
explain the financial implications of reselling gray market products.

PART 6  •  MERCHANDISE MANAGEMENT AND PRICING
Despite the advantages of high turnover, buying items in small amounts may also result in the 
loss of quantity discounts and in higher transportation charges. Because high turnover might be 
due to a limited assortment, some sales may be lost, and profits may be lower if prices are reduced 
to move inventory quickly. The return on investment depends on both turnover and profit per unit.
Gross margin return on investment (GMROI) shows the relationship between the gross 
margin in dollars (total dollar operating profits) and the average inventory investment (at cost) by 
combining profitability and sales-to-stock measures:
 GMROI = Gross margin in dollars
Net sales
*
Net sales
Average inventory at Cost
 =
Gross margin in dollars
Average inventory at cost
The gross margin in dollars equals net sales minus the cost of goods sold. The gross margin per-
centage is derived by dividing dollar gross margin by net sales. A sales-to-stock ratio is derived 
by dividing net sales by average inventory at cost. That ratio may be converted to stock turnover 
by multiplying it by [(100 - Gross margin percentage)/100].
Gross margin return on investment is a useful concept for several reasons:
▶
▶It shows how diverse retailers can prosper. A supermarket may have a gross margin of 20 per-
cent and a sales-to-stock ratio of 15—a GMROI of 300 percent. A women’s clothing store may 
have a gross margin of 50 percent and a sales-to-stock ratio of 6—a GMROI of 300 percent. 
Both firms have the same GMROI due to the trade-off between item profitability and turnover.
▶
▶It is a good indicator of a manager’s performance because it focuses on factors controlled by 
that person. Interdepartmental comparisons can also be made.
▶
▶It is simple to plan and understand, and data collection is easy.
▶
▶It can be determined if GMROI performance is consistent with other company goals.
The gross margin percentage and the sales-to-stock ratio must be studied individually. If only 
overall GMROI is reviewed, performance may be assessed improperly.

CHAPTER 16   •  Financial Merchandise Management	
423	
When to Reorder
One way to control inventory investment is to systematically set stock levels at which new orders 
must be placed. Such a stock level is called a reorder point, and it is based on three factors.
1.	 Order lead time is the period from the date an order is placed by a retailer to the date mer-
chandise is ready for sale (received, price-marked, and put on the selling floor).
2.	 Usage rate refers to average sales per day, in units, of merchandise.
3.	 Safety stock is the extra inventory that protects against out-of-stock conditions due to unexpected 
demand and delays in delivery. It depends on the firm’s policy toward running out of items.
The formula for a retailer that does not plan to carry safety stock is shown here. It believes 
customer demand is stable and that its orders are promptly filled by suppliers:
Reorder point = Usage rate * Lead time
If Handy Hardware sells 10 paintbrushes a day and needs 8 days to order, receive, and display 
them, it has a reorder point of 80 brushes. It would reorder brushes when the inventory on hand 
reaches 80. By the time brushes from that order are placed on shelves (8 days later), stock on hand 
will be zero, and the new stock will replenish the inventory.
This strategy is proper when Handy has a steady customer demand of 10 paintbrushes daily and 
it takes exactly 8 days to complete all stages in the ordering process. This does not normally occur. 
If customers buy 15 brushes per day in a month, Handy would run out of stock in 5-1/3 days and be 
without brushes for 2-2/3 days. If an order takes 10 days to process, Handy would have no brushes 
for 2 days, despite correctly estimating demand. Figure 16-6 shows how stockouts may occur.
For a retailer interested in keeping a safety stock, the reorder formula becomes:
Reorder point = (Usage rate * Lead time) + Safety stock
Suppose Handy Hardware decides on safety stock of 30 percent for paintbrushes; its reorder 
point is (10 * 8) + (0.30 * 80) = 80 + 24 = 104. Handy still expects to sell an average of

10 brushes per day and receive orders in an average of 8 days. The safety stock of 24 extra brushes 
is kept on hand to protect against unexpected demand or a late shipment.
By combining a perpetual inventory system and reorder point calculations, ordering can be 
computerized and an automatic reordering system can be mechanically activated when stock-
on-hand reaches the reorder point. However, intervention by a buyer or manager must be possible, 
especially if monthly sales fluctuate greatly.
How Much to Reorder
A firm placing large orders generally reduces ordering costs but increases inventory-holding costs. 
A firm placing small orders often minimizes inventory-holding costs while ordering costs may 
rise (unless EDI and a QR inventory system are used).
Economic order quantity (EOQ) is the quantity per order (in units) that minimizes the 
total costs of processing orders and holding inventory. Order-processing costs include computer 
time, order forms, labor, and handling new goods. Holding costs include warehousing, inventory 
investment, insurance, taxes, depreciation, deterioration, and pilferage. Economic order quantity 
calculations can be done by large and small firms.
As Figure 16-7 shows, order-processing costs drop as order quantity (in units) goes up because 
fewer orders are needed for the same annual quantity. Inventory-holding costs rise as the order 
quantity goes up because more units must be held in inventory and they are kept for longer periods. 
The two costs are summed into a total cost curve. Mathematically, the economic order quantity is:
EOQ = A
2DS
IC
where
 EOQ = quantity per order (in units)
 D = annual demand (in units)
 S = costs to place an order (in dollars)
 I = percentage of annual carrying cost to unit cost
 C = unit cost of an item (in dollars)
Handy estimates it can sell 150 power tool sets per year. They cost $90 each. Breakage, insur-
ance, tied-up capital, and pilferage equal 10 percent of the costs of the sets (or $9 each). Order 
costs are $25 per order. The economic order quantity is 29:
EOQ = A
2(150)(+25)
(0.10)(+90) = A
+7,500
+9
= 29
The EOQ formula must often be modified to take into account changes in demand, quantity 
discounts, and variable ordering and holding costs.

CHAPTER 16   •  Financial Merchandise Management	
425	
1.	 To describe the major aspects of financial merchandise 
planning and management. The purpose of financial 
merchandise management is to stipulate which products 
are bought by the retailer, when, and in what quantity. 
Dollar control monitors inventory investment, whereas 
unit control relates to the amount of merchandise han-
dled. Financial merchandise management encompasses 
accounting methods, merchandise forecasts and budgets, 
unit control, and integrated dollar and unit controls.
2.	 To explain the cost and retail methods of accounting. The 
two accounting techniques for retailers are the cost and 
retail methods of inventory valuation. Physical and book 
(perpetual) procedures are possible with each. Physical 
inventory valuation requires counting merchandise at 
prescribed times. Book inventory valuation relies on 
accurate bookkeeping and a smooth data flow.
The cost method obligates a retailer to have care-
ful records or to code costs on packages. This must 
be done to find the exact value of ending inventory 
at cost. Many firms use LIFO accounting to project 
that value, which lets them reduce taxes by having a 
low ending inventory value. In the retail method, clos-
ing inventory value is tied to the average relationship 
between the cost and retail value of merchandise. That 
more accurately reflects market conditions but can be 
complex.
3.	 To study the merchandise forecasting and budgeting pro-
cess. This is a form of dollar control with six stages: des-
ignating control units, sales forecasting, inventory-level 
planning, reduction planning, planning purchases, and 
planning profit margins. Adjustments require all later 
stages to be modified.
Control units—merchandise categories for which 
data are gathered—must be narrow to isolate problems 
and opportunities with specific product lines. Sales fore-
casting may be the key stage in the merchandising and 
budgeting process. Through inventory-level planning, a 
firm sets merchandise quantities for specified periods 
through the basic stock, percentage variation, weeks’ 
supply, and/or stock-to-sales methods. Reduction plan-
ning estimates expected markdowns, discounts, and 
stock shortages. Planned purchases are linked to planned 
sales, reductions, and ending and beginning inventory. 
Profit margins depend on planned net sales, operating 
expenses, profit, and reductions.
4.	 To examine alternative methods of inventory unit con-
trol. A unit control system involves physical units of 
merchandise. It monitors best-sellers and poor-sellers, 
the quantity of goods on hand, inventory age, reorder 
time, and so on. A physical inventory unit control system 
may use visual inspection or stock counting. A perpetual 
inventory unit control system keeps a running total of 
the units handled through record keeping entries that 
adjust for sales, returns, transfers, and so on. A perpetual 
system can be applied manually, by merchandise tags 
processed by computers, or by point-of-sale devices. 
Virtually all larger retailers conduct regular complete 
physical inventories; two-thirds use a perpetual inven-
tory system.
5.	 To integrate dollar and unit merchandising control 
concepts. Three aspects of financial inventory manage-
ment integrate dollar and unit control concepts: stock 
turnover and gross margin return on investment, when 
to reorder, and how much to reorder. Stock turnover is 
the number of times during a period that average inven-
tory on hand is sold. Gross margin return on invest-
ment shows the relationship between gross margin 
in dollars (total dollar operating profits) and average 
inventory investment (at cost). A reorder point calcu-
lation—when to reorder—includes the retailer’s usage 
rate, order lead time, and safety stock. The economic 
order quantity—how much to reorder—shows how big 
an order to place, based on both ordering and ­inventory 
costs.

17 Pricing in Retailing
Chapter 
Objectives
1. To describe the role 
of pricing in a retail 
strategy and to show 
that pricing decisions 
must be made in an 
integrated and adaptive 
manner
2. To examine the 
impact of consumers; 
government; 
manufacturers, 
wholesalers, and 
other suppliers; and 
current and potential 
competitors on pricing 
decisions
3. To present a 
framework for 
developing a retail 
price strategy: 
objectives, broad 
policy, basic strategy, 
implementation, and 
adjustments
Retail price setting can take one of several approaches. Some 
retailers offer deep discounts and no-frills shopping (think Costco), 
others offer everyday low pricing (think Walmart), others offer 
mid-level prices and promote special sales (think Macy’s), and still 
others set prices that are rarely discounted (think Apple stores). 
A new entrant to the retail pricing mix is the “real-time deal,” 
whereby online firms—usually driven by social media—offer deals 
for consumers willing to make a purchase during a defined, short 
time period.
The balance of power in terms of pricing information has shifted 
from the retailer to the consumer due to the Web. A consumer can 
use such sites as True Car (www.truecar.com) for new car pricing, 
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com) for airline and hotel pricing, 
Trivago (www.trivago.com) for hotel pricing, and mySimon.com 
(www.mysimon.com) for pricing data on a wide range of goods. 
Thus, consumers can enter a store knowing the range of prices 
offered by local retailers and Web-based firms. If they forget to 
come prepared with these data, they can usually use a retailer’s 
Wi-Fi to easily obtain pricing information on their smartphones.
These retailing tactics need to be considered as a response to 
consumers’ requests for matching lower prices: Make it easier 
for salespeople to verify lower price offers. Obtain special model 
numbers that are unique to a given store. Stress private-label 
products. Sell brands that are not typically discounted. Charge 
additional fees for services that may not offered by discounters such 
as delivery and installation.

Part 6  •  Merchandise Management and Pricing
Overview
Goods and services must be priced in a way that achieves profitability for the retailer and satisfies 
customers. A pricing strategy must be consistent with the retailer’s overall image (positioning), 
sales, profit, and return on investment goals.
There are three basic pricing options for a retailer:
1.	 A discount orientation uses low prices as the major competitive advantage. A low-price 
image, fewer shopping frills, and low per-unit profit margins mean a target market of price-
oriented customers, low operating costs, and high inventory turnover. Off-price retailers and 
full-line discount stores are in this category.
2.	 With an at-the-market orientation, the retailer has average prices. It offers solid service and 
a nice atmosphere to middle-class shoppers. Margins are moderate to good, and average- to 
above-average–quality products are stocked. This firm may find it hard to expand its price 
range, and it may be squeezed by retailers positioned as discounters or prestige stores. Tra-
ditional department stores and many drugstores are in this category.
3.	 Through an upscale orientation, a prestigious image is the retailer’s major competitive 
advantage. A smaller target market, higher expenses, and lower turnover mean customer 
loyalty, distinctive services and products, and high per-unit profit margins. Upscale depart-
ment stores and specialty stores are in this category.
A key to successful retailing is offering a good value in the consumer’s mind—for the 
price orientation chosen. Every customer, whether buying an inexpensive $4 ream of paper or 
a $40 ream of embossed, personalized stationery, wants to feel his or her purchase represents a 
good value. The consumer is not necessarily looking only for the best price. He or she is often 
interested in the best value—which may be reflected in a superior shopping experience. See  
Figures 17-1 and 17-2.
Consider the universal appeal and consistency of H&M’s strategy. This retailer offers custom-
ers affordable, sustainable, fashionable, and trendy apparel at more than 3,900 stores in 60 cities 
around the world. To fulfill customer needs, H&M follows a two-tier pricing strategy that includes 
offering everyday-low-price products and higher-priced collections in partnership with top design-
ers such as Karl Lagerfeld and Balmain. H&M maintains low prices by offering basic customer 
service with minimal store staff.1
Another factor shaping today’s pricing environment for retailers of all types is the ease by 
which a shopper can compare prices on the Web. When the only way a consumer could do price 
comparisons was by visiting individual stores, the process was time consuming, which limited 
many people’s willingness to shop around. Now, with a few clicks of a computer mouse, a shopper 
can quickly gain online price information from several retailers in just minutes—without leaving 
home. Web sites such as PriceGrabber.com, NexTag, Shopping.com, and mySimon.com make

comparison shopping very simple. Price-comparison mobile apps such as RedLaser, ShopSavvy, 
BuyVia, and Purchx save shoppers money and they predict prices, the likelihood of price cuts, and 
the timing of product releases. Most apps need consumers to snap a photo of a barcode or type a 
SKU to perform a price-comparison search across retailer stores and Web sites.2
The interaction of price with other retailing mix elements can be illustrated by BE’s Toy City, 
a hypothetical discounter. It has a broad strategy consisting of:
▶
▶A target market of price-conscious families that shop for inexpensive toys ($9 to $12)
▶
▶A limited range of quality (mostly end-of-season closeouts and manufacturer overruns)
▶
▶Self-service in an outlet mall location
▶
▶A good assortment supported by quantity purchases at deep discounts from suppliers
▶
▶An image of efficiency and variety
In this chapter, we divide retail pricing into two major sections: the external factors affecting 
a price strategy and the steps in a price strategy. At our blog site (www.bermanevansretail.com), 
there are posts with information on setting a price strategy.
EXTERNAL FACTORS AFFECTING A RETAIL PRICE STRATEGY
Several factors have an impact on a retail pricing strategy, as shown in Figure 17-3. Sometimes, 
the factors have a minor effect. In other cases, they severely restrict a firm’s pricing options.
The Consumer and Retail Pricing3
Retailers should understand the price elasticity of demand—the sensitivity of customers to 
price changes in terms of the quantities they will buy—because there is often a relationship 
between price and consumer purchases and perceptions. If small percentage changes in price lead 
to substantial percentage changes in the number of units bought, demand is price elastic. This 
occurs when the urgency to purchase is low or there are acceptable substitutes. If large percentage

Part 6  •  Merchandise Management and Pricing
changes in price lead to small percentage changes in the number of units bought, demand is price 
inelastic. Then purchase urgency is high or there are no acceptable substitutes (as takes place with 
brand or retailer loyalty). Unitary elasticity occurs when percentage changes in price are directly 
offset by percentage changes in quantity.
Price elasticity is computed by dividing the percentage change in the quantity demanded by 
the percentage change in the price charged. Because purchases generally decline as prices go up, 
elasticity tends to be a negative number:
Elasticity =
Quantity 1 - Quantity 2
Quantity 1 + Quantity 2
Price 1 - Price 2
Price 1 + Price 2
Table 17-1 shows price elasticity for a 1,000-seat movie theater (with elasticities converted to 
positive numbers) that offers second-run films. Quantity demanded (tickets sold) declines at each 
price from $6.00 to $10.00. Demand is inelastic from $6.00 to $7.00 and $7.00 to $8.00; ticket 
receipts rise since the percentage price change exceeds the percentage change in tickets sold. At 
$8.00 to $9.00, demand is unitary; ticket receipts are constant since the percentage change in tick-
ets sold exactly offsets the percentage price change. Demand is elastic from $9.00 to $10.00; ticket 
receipts fall since the percentage change in tickets sold is more than the percentage change in price.
For our movie theater example, total ticket receipts are highest at $8.00 or at $9.00. But what 
about total revenues? If patrons spend an average of $4.00 each at the concession stand, the best 
price is $6.00 (total overall revenues of $10,000). This theater is most interested in total revenues 
because its operating costs are the same whether there are 1,000 or 550 patrons. But typically, 
retailers should evaluate the costs, as well as the revenues, from serving additional customers.
In retailing, computing price elasticity is difficult. First, as with the movie theater, demand 
for individual events or items may be hard to predict. One week, the theater may attract 1,000 
patrons to a movie, and the next week it may attract 400 patrons to a different movie. Second, 
many retailers carry thousands of items and cannot possibly compute elasticities for every one. 
As a result, they usually rely on average markup pricing, competition, tradition, and industrywide 
data to indicate price elasticity.
Price sensitivity varies by market segment, based on shopping orientation. After identifying 
potential segments, retailers determine which of them form their target market:
▶
▶Economic consumers: They perceive competing retailers as similar and shop around for the 
lowest possible prices. This segment has grown dramatically in recent years.

site (www.godiva.com) and

▶
▶Status-oriented consumers: They perceive competing retailers as quite different. They are more 
interested in upscale retailers with prestige brands and strong customer service than in price.
▶
▶Assortment-oriented consumers: They seek retailers with a strong selection in the product 
categories being considered. They want fair prices.
▶
▶Personalizing consumers: They shop where they are known and feel a bond with employees 
and the firm itself. These shoppers will pay slightly above-average prices.
▶
▶Convenience-oriented consumers: They shop because they must, want nearby stores with long 
hours, and may use TV shopping or the Web. These people will pay more for convenience.
The Government and Retail Pricing
Three levels of government may affect domestic retail pricing decisions: federal, state, and local. 
When laws are federal, they apply to interstate commerce. A retailer operating only within the 
boundaries of one state may not be restricted by some federal legislation. Major government rules 
relate to horizontal price fixing, vertical price fixing, price discrimination, minimum price levels, 
unit pricing, item price removal, and price advertising. For retailers operating outside their home 
countries, a fourth level of government comes into play: international jurisdictions.
HORIZONTAL PRICE FIXING  An agreement among manufacturers, among wholesalers, or among 
retailers to set prices is known as horizontal price fixing. Such agreements are illegal under the 
Sherman Antitrust Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act, regardless of how “reasonable” 
prices may be. It is also illegal for retailers to get together regarding the use of coupons, rebates, 
or other price-oriented tactics.
Although few large-scale legal actions have been taken in recent years, the penalties for hori-
zontal price fixing can be severe. A recent horizontal price-fixing case involved Apple and five 
book publishing companies and alleged that together the companies conspired to raise the price 
of E-books to consumers. The judge ruled that the price-fixing conspiracy was a per se violation 
of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The publishers promptly settled the case but Apple decided to 
appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. In March 2016, the Supreme Court held that it would 
not consider Apple’s appeal. The $450 million case action settlement against Apple is in effect.4
VERTICAL PRICE FIXING  When manufacturers or wholesalers seek to control the retail prices of 
their goods and services, vertical price fixing occurs. Until 2007, retailers in the United States 
could not be forced to adhere to minimum retail prices set by manufacturers and wholesalers. 
Federal laws banning this practice were intended to encourage price competition among retailers 
and lower prices for consumers. However, as a result of a 2007 Supreme Court ruling, the situation 
changed significantly. The Supreme Court decision stated that minimum resale price restrictions 
should be judged on a case-by-case basis. Among the factors to be considered are the effect on 
competition, consumer benefits, and other issues.
Minimum resale price agreements are most likely to be found to be anticompetitive if these 
agreements facilitate price fixing at one level of the channel such as at the retailer level. Proof of 
a retail-level agreement often includes evidence that two or more retailers have communicated 
The first outlet of Game Stores (www.game.co.za) opened in 
South Africa during 1970 and offered a wide variety of national 
brands, from electronics to foods (nonperishables and dry grocer-
ies), at discount prices. In 1998, the 28-store chain was acquired 
by Massmart (www.massmart.co.za), a wholesale-and-retail con-
glomerate. In 2011, Walmart purchased a 51 percent stake in 
Massmart. Especially attractive to Walmart was the high growth 
in sub-Saharan African retail markets. By 2016, Game Stores 
operated 135 stores in South Africa and other major African 
markets—including Bostswana, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, 
Namibia, Nigeria, Uganda, and Zambia.
Although Game Stores has been known for its aggressive 
pricing, it has received significant competition in groceries from 
South Africa’s Shoprite and Pick ‘n Pay. These competitors have 
prevented Game Stores from selling food items in shopping malls 
where they have stores. Lease clauses give these competitors the 
exclusive right to sell food in these malls.
Do a Google search and determine the potential of Africa 
for Game Stores.

among themselves, and then asked a common supplier to set minimum resale prices or to punish 
competing retailers that cut prices. In addition, minimum resale price maintenance is not permitted 
when a dominant retailer uses it to hurt competitors.
Today, even though manufacturers and wholesalers may be able to enforce minimum prices at 
the retail level if they choose, most suppliers opt not to do so since they do not want to eliminate 
business with discounters such as Walmart, Target, and Costco.
Manufacturers and wholesalers can also legally control retail prices by one of these methods: 
(1) They can screen retailers. (2) They can set realistic list prices. (3) They can pre-print prices on 
products (which retailers do not have to use). (4) They can set regular prices that are accepted by 
consumers (such as 75 cents for a newspaper). (5) They can use consignment selling, whereby the 
supplier owns items until they are sold and assumes costs normally associated with the retailer. 
(6) They can own retail facilities. (7) They can refuse to sell to retailers that advertise discount 
prices in violation of written policies. (8) A supplier has a right to announce a policy for dealer 
pricing and can refuse to sell to those that do not comply. (9) It cannot use coercion to prohibit a 
retailer from advertising low prices.
PRICE DISCRIMINATION  The Robinson-Patman Act bars manufacturers and wholesalers from 
discriminating in price or purchase terms (such as advertising allowances) in selling to individual 
retailers if these retailers are purchasing products of “like quality” and the effect of such discrimi-
nation is to injure competition. The intent of this act is to stop large retailers from using their 
power to gain discounts not justified by the cost savings achieved by suppliers due to big orders. 
There are exceptions that allow justifiable price discrimination when:
▶
▶Products are physically different.
▶
▶The retailers paying different prices are not competitors.
▶
▶Competition is not injured.
▶
▶Price differences are due to differences in supplier costs.
▶
▶Market conditions change—costs rise or fall or competing suppliers shift their prices.
Discounts are not illegal, so long as suppliers follow the preceding rules, make discounts 
available to competing retailers on an equitable basis, and offer discounts sufficiently graduated 
so small retailers can also qualify. Discounts for cumulative purchases (total yearly orders) and 
for multistore purchases by chains may be hard to justify.
Although the Robinson-Patman Act restricts sellers more than buyers, retailers are covered 
under Section 2(F): “It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in the course of 
such commerce, knowingly to induce or receive a discrimination in price which is prohibited in 
this section.” Thus, a retail buyer must try to get the lowest prices charged to any competitor, yet 
not bargain so hard that discounts cannot be justified by acceptable exceptions. The act applies to 
purchases but not to services or leases.5
MINIMUM-PRICE LAWS  Nearly one-half of the states have minimum-price laws that prevent 
retailers from selling certain items for less than their cost plus a fixed percentage to cover overhead. 
Besides general laws, some state rules set minimum prices for specific products. For instance, 
in New Jersey and Connecticut, the retail price of liquor cannot be less than the wholesale cost 
(including taxes and delivery charges).
Minimum-price laws protect small retailers from predatory pricing, in which large retailers 
seek to reduce competition by selling goods and services at very low prices, thus causing small retail-
ers to go out of business. In one case, three Arkansas pharmacies filed a suit claiming Walmart had 
sold selected items below cost in order to reduce competition. Walmart agreed it had priced some 
items below cost to meet or beat rivals’ prices but not to harm competitors. The Arkansas Supreme 
Court ruled Walmart did not use predatory pricing since the three pharmacies were still profitable.
With loss leaders, retailers price selected items below cost to lure more customer traffic to their 
stores. Supermarkets and other retailers advertise loss leaders to induce customers to visit a store or 
Web site. When the customers are at the store, they will also buy additional items that have higher 
margins, thus increasing overall sales and profits. The loss leader products may result in no profit 
being made but will be made up through the sale of other goods/services that may or may not be 
related to the product. Implementing the loss leader strategy can be risky. Price-sensitive customers 
may not make additional purchases, hence some loss leaders may be conditional bargains requiring 
customers to meet a minimum purchase limit. Pervasive use of loss leaders by retailers can lead to 
downward pressure on prices, so using it to penetrate the market needs to be carefully considered.6

 
CHAPTER 17   •  Pricing in Retailing	
433	
UNIT PRICING  In some states, the proliferation of package sizes has led to unit-pricing laws, 
whereby some retailers must express both the total price of an item and its price per unit of mea-
sure. Food stores are most affected by unit-price rules because grocery items are more regulated 
than nongrocery items.7 There are exemptions for firms with low sales. The aim of unit pricing is 
to enable consumers to compare prices of products available in many sizes. Thus, a 5-ounce can 
of tuna fish priced at $1.35 would also have a shelf label showing this as 27 cents per ounce. And 
a person learns that a 20-ounce bottle of soda selling for $1.00 (5 cents per ounce) costs more than 
a 67.6-ounce (2-liter) bottle for $1.49 (2.2 cents per ounce).
Retailer costs include computing per-unit prices, printing product and shelf labels, and keep-
ing computer records. These costs are influenced by the way prices are attached to goods (by 
the supplier or the retailer), the number of items subject to unit pricing, the frequency of price 
changes, sales volume, and the number of stores in a chain.
Unit pricing can be a good strategy for retailers to follow, even when not required. At many 
supermarkets, the unit-pricing system more than pays for itself because of decreased price-mark-
ing errors, better inventory control, and improved space management.
ITEM PRICE REMOVAL  The boom in computerized checkout systems has led many firms, espe-
cially supermarkets, to push for item price removal—whereby prices are marked only on shelves 
or signs and not on individual items. Instead of the costly price marking of individual items, 
retailers want to rely on scanning equipment that reads pre-marked product codes and enters price 
data at the checkout counter. Their efforts have been successful; in 2011, Michigan removed its 
law—leaving Massachusetts as the only place in the United States with a statewide ban on some 
forms of item price removal. Shelf pricing is now more widely accepted.
Why have retailers opposed item pricing laws? They insist that electronic or manual shelf 
labeling and checkout scanners make prices on individual items redundant. Instead of serving 
customers, salesperson hours are wasted ticketing items with a sticker gun and increased employee 
expenses. Consumerists support them because price tags help customers shop and help them verify 
the prices they are charged at checkout. They also help cashiers reduce checkout errors.8
PRICE ADVERTISING  The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has guidelines pertaining to adver-
tising price reductions, advertising prices in relation to competitors’ prices, and bait-and-switch 
advertising.
A retailer cannot claim or imply that a price has been reduced from some former level (a sug-
gested list price) unless the former price was one that the retailer had actually offered for a good 
or service on a regular basis during a reasonably substantial, recent period of time.
When a retailer says its prices are lower than its competitors’ prices, it must make certain 
that its comparisons pertain to firms selling large quantities in the same trading area. A some-
what controversial, but legal, practice is price matching. For the most part, a retailer makes three 
assumptions when it “guarantees to match the lowest price” of any competing retailer: (1) This 
guarantee gives shoppers the impression that a firm always offers low prices or else it would not 
make such a commitment. (2) Most shoppers will not return to a store after a purchase even if they 
see a lower price advertised elsewhere. (3) The guarantee may exclude most deep discounters and 
online firms by stating that they are not really competitors.
Bait-and-switch advertising is an illegal practice in which a retailer lures a customer by 
advertising goods and services at exceptionally low prices. When the customer contacts the retailer 
(by entering a store, calling a toll-free number, or going to a Web site), he or she is told the good/
service of interest is out of stock or of inferior quality. A salesperson (or Web script) tries to con-
vince the person to buy a more costly substitute. The retailer does not intend to sell the advertised 
item. In deciding if a promotion uses bait-and-switch advertising, the FTC considers how many 
transactions are made at the advertised price, whether sales commissions are excluded on sale 
items, and total sales relative to advertising costs.
Manufacturers, Wholesalers, and Other Suppliers—and Retail Pricing
There may be conflicts between manufacturers (and other suppliers) and retailers in setting final prices; 
each would like some control. Manufacturers usually want a certain image and to enable all retailers, 
even inefficient ones, to earn profits. Most retailers want to set prices based on their image, goals, and 
so forth. A supplier can best control prices through exclusive distribution, not selling to price-cutting 
retailers, or being its own retailer. A retailer can best gain control by being a vital customer, threatening 
to stop carrying items, stocking private brands, or selling gray-market goods (defined soon).

434 
Part 6  •  Merchandise Management and Pricing
Many manufacturers set prices to retailers by estimating final retail prices and then subtract-
ing required retailer and wholesaler profit margins. In men’s apparel, the common retail markup 
is 50 percent of the final price. Thus, a man’s shirt retailing at $50 can be sold to a retailer for no 
more than $25. If a wholesaler is involved, the manufacturer’s wholesale price must be far less 
than $25.
Retailers sometimes carry manufacturers’ brands and place high prices on them so rival 
brands (such as private labels) can be sold more easily. This is called “selling against the brand” 
and is disliked by manufacturers because sales of their brands are apt to decline. Some retailers 
also sell gray-market goods, brand-name products bought in foreign markets or goods trans-
shipped from other retailers. Manufacturers dislike gray-market goods because they are often sold 
at low prices by unauthorized dealers. They may sue gray-market goods resellers on the basis of 
copyright and trademark infringement.
When suppliers are unknown or products are new, retailers may seek price guarantees. For 
example, to get its radios stocked, a new supplier might have to guarantee the $30 suggested retail 
price. If the retailers cannot sell the radios for $30, the manufacturer pays a refund. Should the 
retailers have to sell the radios at $25, the manufacturer gives back $5. Another guarantee is one 
in which a supplier tells the retailer that no competitor can buy an item for a lower price. If any-
one does, the retailer gets a rebate. The relative power of the retailer and its suppliers determines 
whether such guarantees are provided.
A retailer also has other suppliers: employees, fixtures manufacturers, landlords, and 
outside parties (such as ad agencies). Each has an effect on price because of its costs to the 
retailer.
Competition and Retail Pricing
Market pricing occurs when shoppers have a large choice of retailers. In this instance, retailers 
often price similarly to each other and have less control over price because consumers can easily 
shop around. Supermarkets, fast-food restaurants, and gas stations may use market pricing due to 
their competitive industries. Demand for specific retailers may be weak enough so that some 
customers would switch to a competitor if prices are raised much.
With administered pricing, firms seek to attract consumers on the basis of distinctive retailing 
mixes. This occurs when people consider image, assortment, service, and so forth to be important 
and they are willing to pay above-average prices to unique retailers. Upscale department stores, 
fashion apparel stores, and expensive restaurants are among those with unique offerings and solid 
control over their prices.
Most price-oriented strategies can be quickly imitated. Thus, the reaction of competitors is 
predictable if the leading firm is successful. This means a price strategy should be viewed from 
both short-run and long-run perspectives. If competition becomes too intense, a price war may 
erupt—whereby various firms continually lower prices below regular amounts and sometimes 
below their cost to lure consumers from competitors. Price wars are sometimes difficult to end 
and can lead to low profits, losses, or even bankruptcy for some competitors. This is especially 
so for Web retailers.
See how Auto-by-Tel 
(www.autobytel.com) and 
CarsDirect.com (www 
.carsdirect.com) approach 
the selling of cars.
Revenue management systems seek to maximize a retailer’s prof-
its by constantly changing the mix of prices. An airline might 
have multiple prices for adjacent seats on the same plane based 
on when the seats were purchased. A restaurant might offer 
selective discounts on its Web site at times when its reservation 
schedule indicates a low table utilization rate. In contrast, there 
may be no discount seats—on the plane or at the restaurant—if 
a major convention is in town. The popularity of the Web has 
increased the opportunities for revenue management strategies 
by efficiently enabling a retailer to monitor low and high sales 
periods, and to adjust prices accordingly. A retailer’s revenue 
management policies might undermine a consumer’s trust, based 
on the retailer’s desire to maximize profits and to use customer 
satisfaction concepts that stress the lifetime revenue per loyal 
customer. Trust can also be undermined by two customers paying 
disparate prices for a comparable item.

using revenue management tactics?

DEVELOPING A RETAIL PRICE STRATEGY
As Figure 17-4 shows, a retail price strategy has five steps: objectives, policy, strategy, imple-
mentation, and adjustments. Pricing policies must be integrated with the total retail mix, which 
occurs in the second step. The process can be complex due to the often erratic nature of demand, 
the number of items carried, and the impact of the external factors already noted.
Retail Objectives and Pricing
A retailer’s pricing strategy has to reflect its overall goals and be related to sales and profits. There 
must also be specific pricing goals to avoid such potential problems as confusing people by having 
too many prices, spending too much time bargaining with customers, offering frequent discounts 
to stimulate customer traffic, having low profit margins, and placing too much focus on price.
OVERALL OBJECTIVES AND PRICING  Sales goals may be stated in terms of revenues and/or units. 
An aggressive strategy, known as market penetration pricing, is used when a retailer seeks large 
revenues by setting low prices and selling many units. Profit per unit is low, but total profit is high 
if sales projections are met. This approach is proper if customers are price sensitive, low prices 
discourage actual and potential competition, and retail costs do not rise much with volume.
With a market skimming pricing strategy, a firm sets premium prices and attracts custom-
ers less concerned with price than service, assortment, and prestige. It usually does not maximize 
sales but achieves high profit per unit. It is proper if the targeted segment is price insensitive, if 
new competitors are unlikely to enter the market, and if added sales will greatly increase retail 
costs. See Figure 17-5.
Return on investment and early recovery of cash are other possible profit-based goals for 
retailers using a market skimming strategy. Return on investment is sought if a retailer wants profit 
to be a certain percentage of its investment, such as 20 percent of inventory investment. Early 
recovery of cash is used by retailers that may be short on funds, wish to expand, or be uncertain 
about the future.
BE’s Toy City, the discounter we introduced earlier in this chapter, may be used to illustrate 
how a retailer sets sales, profit, and return-on-investment goals. The firm sells inexpensive toys 
and overruns to avoid competing with mainstream toy stores, has one price for all toys (to be set 
within the $9 to $12 range), minimizes operating costs, encourages self-service, and carries a good 
selection. Table 17-2 has data on BE’s Toy City pertaining to demand, costs, profit, and return-
on-inventory investment at prices from $9 to $12. The firm must select the best price within that 
range. Table 17-3 shows how the figures in Table 17-2 were derived. Several conclusions can be 
drawn from Table 17-2:
▶
▶A sales revenue goal would lead to a price of $10. Total sales are highest ($1,040,000).
▶
▶A dollar profit goal would lead to a price of $11. Total profit is highest ($132,000).
▶
▶A return-on-inventory investment goal would lead to a price of $10. Return on inventory 
investment is 127 percent.
▶
▶Although the most items can be sold at $9, that price would lead to the least profit ($55,600).
▶
▶A price of $12 would yield the highest profit per unit ($1.92) and as a percentage of sales, 
but total dollar profit is not maximized at this price.
▶
▶The highest inventory turnover (9.5 times at $9.00) would not lead to the highest total profits.

As a result, BE’s Toy City decides on a price of $11 because it would earn the highest dollar 
profits, while generating good profit per unit and good profit as a percentage of sales.
SPECIFIC PRICING OBJECTIVES  Figure 17-6 lists specific pricing goals other than sales and profits. 
Each retailer must determine its relative importance for its situation—and plan accordingly. Some 
goals may be incompatible, such as “to not encourage shoppers to be overly price-conscious” and 
a “we-will-not-be-undersold” philosophy.
Broad Price Policy
Through a broad price policy, a retailer generates an integrated price plan with short- and long-run 
perspectives (balancing immediate and future goals) and a consistent image (vital for chains and 
franchises). The retailer interrelates price policy with the target market, the retail image, and the 
other elements of the retail mix. These are some price policies from which a firm could choose:
▶
▶No competitors will have lower prices, no competitors will have higher prices (for prestige 
purposes), or prices will be consistent with competitors’ prices.

Part 6  •  Merchandise Management and Pricing
Price Strategy
In demand-oriented pricing, a retailer sets prices based on consumer desires. It determines the 
range of prices acceptable to the target market. The top of this range is the demand ceiling—the 
most that people will pay for a good or service. With cost-oriented pricing, a retailer sets a price 
floor, the minimum price acceptable to the firm so it can reach a specified profit goal. A retailer 
usually computes merchandise and operating costs and adds a profit margin to these figures. For 
competition-oriented pricing, a retailer sets its prices in accordance with those of its competitors. 
The price levels of key competitors are studied and applied.
As a rule, retailers should combine these approaches in enacting a price strategy. The 
approaches should not be viewed as operating independently.
DEMAND-ORIENTED PRICING  Retailers use demand-oriented pricing to estimate the quantities 
that customers would buy at various prices. This approach studies customer interests and the 
psychological implications of pricing. Two aspects of psychological pricing are the price–quality 
association and prestige pricing.
According to the price–quality association concept, many consumers believe high prices 
connote high quality and low prices connote low quality. This association is especially important 
if competing firms or products are hard to judge on bases other than price, consumers have little 
experience or confidence in judging quality (as with a new retailer), shoppers perceive large 
differences in quality among retailers or products, and brand names are insignificant in product 
choice. Although various studies have documented a price–quality relationship, research also 
indicates that if other quality cues—such as retailer atmospherics, customer service, and popular 
brands—are involved, these cues may be more important than price in a person’s judgment of 
overall retailer or product quality.
Prestige pricing—which assumes that consumers will not buy goods and services at prices 
deemed too low—is based on the price–quality association. Its premise is that consumers may 
feel too low a price means poor quality and status. Some people look for prestige pricing when 
selecting retailers and do not patronize those with prices viewed as too low. Saks Fifth Avenue 
and Neiman Marcus do not generally carry low-end items because their customers may believe 
such items are inferior. Prestige pricing does not apply to all shoppers. Some people may be 
economizers and always shop for bargains; and neither the price–quality association nor prestige 
pricing may be applicable for them.
COST-ORIENTED PRICING  One form of cost-oriented pricing, markup pricing, is the most widely 
used pricing technique. In markup pricing, a retailer sets prices by adding per-unit merchandise 
costs, retail operating expenses, and desired profit. The difference between merchandise costs and 
selling price is the markup. If a retailer buys a desk for $200 and sells it for $300, the extra $100 
covers operating costs and profit. The markup is 33-1/3 percent at retail or 50 percent at cost. 
The markup level depends on a product’s traditional markup, the supplier’s suggested list price, 
inventory turnover, competition, rent and other overhead costs, the extent to which the product 
must be serviced, and the selling effort.
Markups can be computed on the basis of retail selling price or cost but are usually calculated 
using the retail price. Why? (1) Retail expenses, markdowns, and profit are always stated as a 
percentage of sales. Thus, markups as a percentage of sales are more meaningful. (2) Manufactur-
ers quote selling prices and discounts to retailers as percentage reductions from retail list prices. 
(3) Retail price data are more readily available than cost data. (4) Profitability seems smaller 
if expressed on the basis of price. This can be useful in communicating with the government, 
employees, and consumers.
This is how a markup percentage is calculated. The difference is in the denominator:
 Markup percentage
(at retail)
= Retail selling price - Merchandise cost
Retail selling price
 Markup percentage
(at cost)
= Retail selling price - Merchandise cost
Merchandise cost
Table 17-4 shows several markup percentages at retail and at cost. As markups go up, the 
disparity between the percentages grows. Suppose a retailer buys a watch for $20 and considers

whether to sell it for $25, $40, or $100. The $25 price yields a markup of 20 percent at retail and 
25 percent at cost, the $40 price a markup of 50 percent at retail and 100 percent at cost, and the 
$100 price a markup of 80 percent at retail and 400 percent at cost.
The following three examples indicate the usefulness of the markup concept in planning:
1.	 A discount clothing store can buy a shipment of men’s long-sleeve shirts at $12 each and wants 
a 30 percent markup at retail.9 What retail price should the store charge to achieve this markup?
 Markup percentage
(at retail)
= Retail selling price - Merchandise cost
Retail selling price
 0.30 = Retail selling price - +12.00
Retail selling price
 Retail selling price = +17.14
2.	 A stationery store desires a minimum 40 percent markup at retail.10 If standard envelopes 
retail at $7.99 per box, what is the maximum price the store should pay for each box?
 Markup percentage
(at retail)
= Retail selling price - Merchandise cost
Retail selling price
 0.40 = +7.99 - Merchandise cost
+7.99
 Merchandise cost = +4.794
3.	 A sporting goods store has been offered a closeout purchase for bicycles. The cost of each bike 
is $105, and it should retail for $160. What markup percentage at retail would the store obtain?
 Markup percentage
(at retail)
= Retail selling price - Merchandise cost
Retail selling price
 = +160.00 - +105.00
+160.00
= 34.4
A retailer’s markup percentage may also be determined by examining planned retail operat-
ing expenses, profit, and net sales. Suppose a florist estimates yearly operating expenses to be 
$55,000. The desired profit is $50,000 per year, including the owner’s salary. Net sales are forecast 
to be $250,000. The planned markup percentage would be:
 Markup percentage
(at retail)
= Planned retail operating expenses + Planned profit
Planned net sales
 = +55,000 + +50,000
+250,000
= 42

If potted plants cost the florist $8.00 each, the retailer’s selling price would be:
 Retail selling price = Merchandise cost
1 - Markup
 =
+8.00
1 - 0.42 = +13.79
The florist must sell about 18,129 plants (assuming this is the only item it carries) 
at $13.79 apiece to achieve sales and profit goals. To reach these goals, all plants must be sold at 
the $13.79 price.
Because it is rare to sell all items in stock at their original prices, initial markup, maintained 
markup, and gross margin should each be computed. Initial markup is based on the original retail 
value assigned to merchandise less the costs of the merchandise. Maintained markup is based 
on the actual prices received for merchandise sold during a time period less merchandise cost. 
Maintained markups relate to actual prices received, so they can be hard to predict. The difference 
between initial and maintained markups is that the latter reflect adjustments for markdowns, added 
markups, shortages, and discounts.
The initial markup percentage depends on planned retail operating expenses, profit, reduc-
tions, and net sales:
Initial markup
percentage
(at retail)
=
Planned retail operating expenses + Planned profit
+ Planned retail reductions
Planned net sales + Planned retail reductions
If planned retail reductions are 0, the initial markup percentage equals planned retail operating 
expenses plus profit, both divided by planned net sales. To resume the florist example, suppose 
the firm projects that retail reductions will be 20 percent of estimated sales, or $50,000. To reach 
its goals, the initial markup and the original selling price would be:
 
Initial markup
percentage
(at retail)
= +55,000 + +50,000 + +50,000
+250,000 + +50,000
= 51.7
 Retail selling price = Merchandise cost
1 - Markup
=
+8.00
1 - 0.517 = +16.56
The original retail value of 18,129 plants is about $300,000. Retail reductions of $50,000 
lead to net sales of $250,000. Thus, the retailer must begin by selling plants at $16.56 apiece if it 
wants an average selling price of $13.79 and a maintained markup of 42 percent.
The maintained markup percentage is:
Maintained markup
percentage
(at retail)
= Actual retail operation expenses + Actual profit
Actual net sales
or
Maintained markup
percentage
(at retail)
= Average selling price - Merchandise cost
Average selling price
Gross margin is the difference between net sales and the total cost of goods sold (which 
adjusts for cash discounts and additional expenses):
Gross margin (in +) = Net sales - Total cost of goods
The florist’s gross margin (the dollar equivalent of maintained markup) is roughly $105,000.

 
CHAPTER 17   •  Pricing in Retailing	
441	
Although a retailer must set a companywide markup goal, markups for categories of mer-
chandise or individual products may differ—sometimes dramatically. At many full-line discount 
stores, maintained markup as a percentage of sales ranges from under 20 percent for consumer 
electronics to as much as 30 to 40 percent or more for jewelry and watches.
With a variable markup policy, a retailer purposely adjusts markups by merchandise 
category.
▶
▶A variable markup policy recognizes that costs of different goods/services categories may 
fluctuate widely. Some items require alterations or installation. Even within a product line, 
expensive items may require greater end-of-year markdowns than inexpensive ones. The high-
priced line needs a larger initial markup.
▶
▶A variable markup policy allows for differences in product investments. For major appliances, 
where the retailer orders regularly from a wholesaler, lower markups are needed than with 
fine jewelry, where the retailer must have a complete stock of unique merchandise.
▶
▶A variable markup policy accounts for differences in sales efforts and merchandising skills. 
For example, a feature-laden food processor may require a substantial effort, whereas a stan-
dard toaster involves much less effort.
▶
▶A variable markup policy may help a retailer to generate more customer traffic by advertising 
certain products at deep discounts. This entails leader pricing (discussed later in the chapter).
One way to plan variable markups is direct product profitability (DPP), a technique that 
enables a retailer to find the profitability of each category of merchandise by computing adjusted 
per-unit gross margin and assigning direct product costs for such expense categories as warehous-
ing, transportation, handling, and selling. The proper markup for each category or item is then 
set. Direct product profitability is used by some supermarkets, discounters, and other retailers. 
However, it is complex to assign costs.
Figure 17-7 illustrates DPP for two items with a selling price of $20. The retailer pays $12 for 
Item A; per-unit gross margin is $8. Since the retailer gets a $1 per unit allowance to set up a special 
display, the adjusted gross margin is $9. Total direct retail costs are estimated at $5. Direct product 
profit is $4 (20 percent of sales). The retailer pays $10 for Item B; per-unit gross margin is $10. There 
are no special discounts or allowances. Because Item B needs more selling effort, total direct retail 
costs are $6. The direct profit is $4 (20 percent of sales). To attain the same direct profit per unit, 
Item A needs a 40 percent markup (per-unit gross margin/selling price), and Item B needs 50 percent.
Cost-oriented (markup) pricing is popular among retailers. It is simple, because a retailer 
can apply a standard markup for a product category more easily than it can estimate demand at 
various prices. The firm can also adjust prices according to demand or segment its customers. 
Markup pricing has a sense of equity given that the retailer earns a fair profit. When retailers have 
similar markups, price competition is reduced. Markup pricing is efficient if it takes into account 
competition, seasonal factors, and the intricacies in selling some products.
COMPETITION-ORIENTED PRICING  A retailer can use competitors’ prices as a guide. That firm 
might not alter prices in reaction to changes in demand or costs unless competitors alter theirs. 
Similarly, it might change prices when competitors do, even if demand or costs remain the same.
Markdown planning is complicated. A markdown made too 
early in a selling season results in less time to sell an item at full 
price, resulting in low profit margins. On the other hand, delay-
ing markdowns until late in an item’s selling season can require 
large markdowns, and also results in stale, slow-selling goods. 
Oracle’s retail markdown optimization software was designed 
to take much of the guesswork out of markdown planning. This 
software recommends candidates for markdowns and specifies 
recommended price reductions based on the inventory risk at 
the end of a selling season. Recommendations are based on 
an item’s product’s life cycle, seasonality, price elasticity, and 
in-season performance—using advanced predictive and simula-
tion techniques. According to Oracle, this software is capable of 
increasing a retailer’s gross margin, overall sales, and inventory 
turnover.

Part 6  •  Merchandise Management and Pricing
As shown in Table 17-5, a competition-oriented retailer can price below, at, or above the 
market. A firm with a strong location, superior service, good assortments, a favorable image, and 
exclusive brands can set prices above competitors. However, above-market pricing is not suitable 
for a retailer that has an inconvenient location, relies on self-service, is not innovative, and offers 
no real product distinctiveness.
Competition-oriented pricing does not require calculations of demand curves or price elastic-
ity. The average market price is assumed to be fair for both the consumer and the retailer. Pricing 
at the market level does not disrupt competition and therefore does not usually lead to retaliation.
INTEGRATION OF APPROACHES TO PRICE STRATEGY  To properly integrate the three approaches—
demand-oriented pricing, cost-oriented pricing, and competition-oriented pricing—questions such 
as these should be addressed:
▶
▶If prices are reduced, will revenues increase greatly? (Demand orientation)

NEW USES FOR CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS  According to a leading research and consulting firm, 
the sales of pre-paid credit and debit cards grew from $12 billion in 2007 to more than $235 bil-
lion in 2015 and accounted for 4 percent of all payment card purchases with retailers.11 This high 
growth rate can be explained by two developments: the increase in the gift card market and the 
greater number of consumers who do not have traditional bank accounts.
Firms such as Home Depot (www.homedepot.com), Gap (www.gap.com), and Nike (www.nike 
.com) offer closed-loop (firm-specific) gift cards. Visa (www.visa.com), MasterCard (www 
.mastercard.com), Discover (www.discovercard.com), and American Express (www.american 
express.com) offer open-loop gift cards that can be redeemed by any merchant.
The growth in pre-paid cards and gift cards has encouraged convenience stores to enter 
the banking business. Stripes (www.stripesstores.com), which operates about 700 convenience 
stores—primarily in New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas—offers a pre-paid credit card in con-
junction with nFinanSe (www.nfinanse.com), a financial services company. For a $2.95 monthly 
fee, Stripes customers can participate in the firm’s credit-card programs. This fee entitles users to 
an unlimited number of purchase transactions, no-cost direct deposit of payroll checks, and 24/7 
customer support. The card is particularly attractive to Stripes because it operates in markets where 
a high percentage of consumers do not have traditional bank accounts. Stripes is now a subsidiary 
of Energy Transfer Partners, the parent company of Sunoco.12
Implementation of Price Strategy
Implementing a price strategy involves a variety of separate but interrelated specific decisions, in 
addition to those broad concepts already discussed. A checklist of selected decisions is shown in 
Figure 17-8. In this section, the specifics of a pricing strategy are detailed.
CUSTOMARY AND VARIABLE PRICING  With customary pricing, a retailer sets prices for goods 
and services and seeks to maintain them for an extended period. Examples of items with customary 
prices are newspapers, candy, arcade games, vending machine items, and foods on restaurant menus. 
In each case, the retailer wants to establish set prices and have consumers take them for granted.
A version of customary pricing is everyday low pricing (EDLP), in which a retailer strives 
to sell its goods and services at consistently low prices throughout the selling season. Low prices 
Bi-Lo (www.bi-lo.com), 
the Southeast supermarket 
chain, offers both everyday 
low prices and regular 
promotions.

are set initially, and there are few or no advertised specials, except on discontinued items or end-
of-season closeouts. The retailer reduces its advertising and product re-pricing costs, and this 
approach increases the credibility of its prices in the consumer’s mind. On the other hand, with 
EDLP, suppliers may eliminate special trade allowances designed to encourage retailers to offer 
price promotions during the year. Walmart, McDonald’s, and Ikea are among the retailers suc-
cessfully using everyday low pricing. See Figure 17-9.
In many instances, a retailer cannot or should not use customary pricing. A firm cannot hold 
constant prices if costs are rising. A firm should not keep prices constant if customer demand varies. 
Under variable pricing, a retailer alters its prices to coincide with fluctuations in costs or consumer 
demand. Variable pricing may offer excitement due to special sales opportunities for customers.
Cost fluctuations can be seasonal or trend-related. Supermarket and florist prices vary over 
the year due to the seasonal nature of many food and floral products. When seasonal items are 
scarce, the cost to the retailer goes up. If costs continually rise (as with luxury cars) or fall (as with 
computers), the retailer must change prices permanently (unlike temporary seasonal changes).
Demand fluctuations can be place- or time-based. Place-based fluctuations exist for retailers 
selling seat locations (such as concert halls) or room locations (such as hotels). Different prices can

be charged for different locales, such as tickets close to the stage commanding higher prices. Time-
based fluctuations occur if consumer demand differs by hour, day, or season. Demand for a movie 
theater is greater on Saturday than on Wednesday. Prices should be lower in periods of less demand.
Yield management pricing is a computerized, demand-based, variable pricing technique 
whereby a retailer (typically a service firm) determines the combination of prices that yield the 
greatest total revenues for a given period. It is widely used by airlines and hotels. A key airline 
decision is how many first-class, full-coach, and discount tickets to sell on each flight. With this 
approach, an airline has fewer discount tickets in peak periods than in off-peak times. The airline 
has two goals: fill as many seats as possible on every flight and sell as many full-fare tickets as it 
can. (An airline doesn’t want to sell a seat for $199 if someone will pay $599!) Yield management 
pricing may be too complex for small firms and requires software
It is possible to combine customary and variable pricing. A movie theater can charge $5 each 
Wednesday night and $9 every Saturday. A bookstore can lower prices by 20 percent for best-
sellers that have been on shelves for three months.
ONE-PRICE POLICY AND FLEXIBLE PRICING  Under a one-price policy, a retailer charges the same 
price to all customers buying an item under similar conditions. This policy may be used together 
with customary pricing or variable pricing. With variable pricing, all customers interested in a 
particular section of concert seats would pay the same price. This approach is easy to manage, 
does not require skilled salespeople, makes shopping quicker, permits self-service, puts consum-
ers under less pressure, and is tied to price goals. One-price policies are the rule for most U.S. 
retailers, and bargaining is often not permitted.
Flexible pricing lets consumers bargain over prices; those who are good at it obtain lower 
prices. Jewelry stores, car dealers, and others use flexible pricing. They post “list prices” but 
shoppers who are able to haggle can purchase at lower prices. Shoppers need prior knowledge to 
bargain well. Flexible pricing encourages consumers to spend more time, gives an impression the 
firm is discount-oriented, and generates high margins from shoppers who do not like haggling. It 
requires high initial prices and good salespeople.13
A special form of flexible pricing is contingency pricing, whereby a service retailer does 
not get paid until after the service is performed and payment is contingent on the service being 
satisfactory. In some cases, such as real-estate, consumers like contingency payments so they 
know the service is done properly. This represents some risk to the retailer because a lot of time 
and effort may be incurred without payment. A real-estate broker may show a house 25 times, not 
sell it, and, therefore, not be paid.
ODD PRICING  In odd pricing, retail prices are set at levels below even dollar values, such as 
$0.49, $4.98, and $199. The assumption is that people feel these prices represent discounts or that 
the amounts are beneath consumer price ceilings. Odd pricing is a form of psychological pricing.14 
Realtors hope consumers with a price ceiling of less than $350,000 are attracted to houses selling 
for $349,500. See Figure 17-10.
Odd prices that are 1 cent or 2 cents below the next highest even price ($0.29, $0.99, $2.98) are 
common up to $10.00. Beyond that point and up to $50.00, 5-cent reductions from the highest even 
price ($19.95, $49.95) are more usual. For more expensive items, prices are in dollars ($399, $4,995).

Part 6  •  Merchandise Management and Pricing
LEADER PRICING  In leader pricing, a retailer advertises and sells selected items in its goods/
services assortment at less than the usual profit margins. The goal is to increase customer traffic 
for the retailer so that it can sell regularly priced goods and services in addition to the specially 
priced items. This is different from bait-and-switch, in which sale items are not sold.
Leader pricing typically involves frequently purchased, nationally branded, high-turnover 
goods and services because it is easy for customers to detect low prices. Supermarkets, home 
centers, discount stores, drugstores, and fast-food restaurants are just some of the retailers that 
utilize leader pricing to draw shoppers. There are two kinds of leader pricing: loss leaders and 
sales at lower than regular prices (but higher than cost). Loss leaders are regulated in some states 
under minimum-price laws.
MULTIPLE-UNIT PRICING  With multiple-unit pricing, a retailer offers discounts to customers 
who buy in quantity or who buy a product bundle. By pricing items at two for $0.75, a retailer 
attempts to sell more products than at $0.39 each. There are three reasons to use multiple-unit 
pricing: (1) A firm could seek to have shoppers increase their total purchases of an item. (If people 
buy multiple units to stockpile them, instead of consuming more, the firm’s overall sales do not 
increase.) (2) This approach can help sell slow-moving and end-of-season merchandise. (3) Price 
bundling may increase sales of related items.
In bundled pricing, a retailer combines several items in one basic price. A digital camera 
bundle could include a camera, batteries, a telephoto lens, a case, and a tripod for $259. This 
approach increases overall sales and offers people a discount over unbundled prices. However, it 
is unresponsive to the needs of customers who vary in their needs and preferences. Many retailers 
offer hybrid bundles that combine complementary products(s) and service(s) for a single price; 
home improvement stores may charge a single price for floor tiles, installation, and disposal 
of previous flooring materials. As an alternative, many retailers use unbundled pricing—they 
charge separate prices for each product or service sold. A TV rental firm could charge separately 
for TV set rental, home delivery, and a monthly service contract. This closely links prices with 
costs and gives people more choice. Unbundled pricing may be harder to manage and may lead 
to people buying fewer related items.15

CHAPTER 17   •  Pricing in Retailing	
447	
PRICE LINING  Rather than stock merchandise at all different price levels, retailers often employ 
price lining and sell merchandise at a limited range of price points, with each point representing 
a distinct level of quality. Retailers first determine their price floors and ceilings in each product 
category. They then set a limited number of price points within the range. Department stores 
generally carry good, better, and best versions of merchandise consistent with their overall price 
policy—and set individual prices accordingly. See Figure 17-11.
Price lining benefits both consumers and retailers. If the price range for a box of handker-
chiefs is $6 to $25 and the price points are $6, $15, and $25, consumers know that distinct product 
qualities exist. However, should a retailer have prices of $6, $7, $8, $9, $10, $11, $12, $13, $14, 
$15, $16, $17, $18, $19, $20, $21, $22, $23, $24, and $25, the consumer may be confused about 
product differences. For retailers, price lining aids merchandise planning. Retail buyers can seek 
suppliers carrying products at appropriate prices and better negotiate with suppliers. They can 
automatically disregard products not fitting within price lines and thereby reduce inventory invest-
ment. Also, stock turnover goes up when the number of models carried is limited.
Difficulties do exist in price lining: (1) Depending on the price points selected, price lining 
may leave excessive gaps. A parent shopping for a graduation gift might find a $30 briefcase to 
be too cheap and a $200 one to be too expensive. (2) Inflation can make it tough to keep price 
points and price ranges. (3) Markdowns may disrupt the balance in a price line, unless all items in 
a line are reduced proportionally. (4) Price lines must be coordinated for complementary product 
categories, such as blazers, skirts, and shoes.
Price Adjustments
Price adjustments enable retailers to use price as an adaptive mechanism. Markdowns and addi-
tional markups may be needed due to competition, seasonality, demand patterns, merchandise 
costs, and pilferage. Figure 17-12 shows a price change authorization form.
A markdown from an item’s original price is used to meet the lower price of another retailer, 
adapt to inventory overstocking, clear out shopworn merchandise, reduce assortments of odds 
and ends, and increase customer traffic. An additional markup increases an item’s original price 
because demand is unexpectedly high or costs are rising. In today’s competitive marketplace, 
markdowns are applied much more frequently than additional markups.
A third price adjustment, the employee discount, is noted here because it may affect the com-
putation of markdowns and additional markups. Although an employee discount is not an adaptive 
mechanism, it influences morale. Some firms give employee discounts on all items and also let 
workers buy sale items before they are made available to the general public.
COMPUTING MARKDOWNS AND ADDITIONAL MARKUPS  Markdowns and additional markups 
can be expressed in dollars or percentages.

.com/marriott-brands.mi), 
Marriott International really 
knows how to use price 
lining.

Part 6  •  Merchandise Management and Pricing
The markdown percentage is the total dollar markdown as a percentage of net sales (in 
dollars). Although it is simple to compute, this formula does not enable a retailer to learn the 
percentage of items that are marked down relative to those sold at the original price:
Markdown percentage = Total dollar markdown
Net sales (in +)
A complementary measure is the off-retail markdown percentage, which looks at the mark-
down for each item or category of items as a percentage of original retail price. The markdown 
percentage for every item can be computed, as well as the percentage of items marked down:
Off@retail markdown percentage = Original price -  New price
Original price
Suppose a gas barbecue grill sells for $400 at the beginning of the summer and is reduced to 
$280 at the end of the summer. The off-retail markdown is 30 percent [(+400 - +280)/+400]. If 
100 grills are sold at the original price and 20 are sold at the sale price, the percentage of items 
marked down is 17 percent, and the total dollar markdown is $2,400.
The additional markup percentage looks at total dollar additional markups as a percentage 
of net sales, whereas the addition to retail percentage measures a price rise as a percentage of 
the original price:
 Additional markup

= Total dollar additional markups
Net sales (in +)

Retailers must realize that many more customers would have to buy at reduced prices for those 
retailers to have a total gross profit equal to that at higher prices. A retailer’s judgment regarding

price adjustments is affected by operating costs at various sales volumes and customer price elas-
ticities. The true impact of a markdown or an additional markup can be learned from this formula:
Unit sales required to
earn the same total
gross profit with a
price adjustment
=
Original markup (,)
Original markup (,)
+/- Price change (,) *
Expected unit
sales at
original price
Suppose a Brother printer with a cost of $50 has an original retail price of $100 (a markup of 
50 percent). A retailer expects to sell 500 units over the next year, generating a total gross profit 
of $25,000 (+50 * 500). How many units does the retailer have to sell if it reduces the price to 
$85 or raises it to $110—and still earn a $25,000 gross profit? Here are the answers:
 Unit sales required
(at +85)
=
50,
50, - 15, * 500 = 1.43 * 500 = 714
 Unit sales required
(at +110)
=
50,
50, + 10, * 500 = 0.83 * 500 = 417
MARKDOWN CONTROL  Through markdown control, a retailer evaluates the number of mark-
downs, the proportion of sales involving markdowns, and the causes. The control must be such 
that buying plans can be altered in later periods to reflect markdowns. A good way to evaluate 
the cause of markdowns is to have retail buyers record the reasons for each markdown and then 
examine them periodically. Possible buyer notations are “end of season,” “to match the price of 
a competitor,” and “obsolete style.”
Through markdown control, a retailer can monitor policies, such as the way items are dis-
played. Careful planning may also enable a retailer to avoid some markdowns by running more 
ads, training workers better, shipping goods more efficiently among branch units, and returning 
items to vendors.
The need for markdown control should not be interpreted as meaning that all markdowns can 
or should be minimized or eliminated. In fact, too low a markdown percentage may indicate that 
a retailer’s buyers have not assumed enough risk in purchasing goods.
TIMING MARKDOWNS  There are different perspectives among retailers about the best markdown 
timing sequence, but much can be said about the benefits of an early markdown policy: It requires 
lower markdowns to sell products than markdowns late in the season. Merchandise is offered at 
reduced prices while demand is still fairly active. Early markdowns free selling space for new 
merchandise. The retailer’s cash flow position can be improved. The main advantage of a late 
markdown policy is that a retailer gives itself every opportunity to sell merchandise at original 
prices. Yet, the advantages associated with an early markdown policy cannot be achieved under 
a late markdown policy.
Retailers can also use a staggered markdown policy and discount prices throughout a selling 
period. One pre-planned staggered markdown policy is an automatic markdown plan, in which the 
amount and timing of markdowns are controlled by the length of time merchandise remains in stock.
A storewide clearance, done once or twice a year, is another way to time markdowns. It often 
takes place after peak selling periods such as Christmas and Mother’s Day. The goal is to clear out 
merchandise before taking a physical inventory and beginning the next season. The advantages of 
a storewide clearance are that a longer period is provided for selling items at original prices and 
that frequent markdowns can destroy a consumer’s confidence in regular prices: “Why buy now, 
when it will be on sale next week?” Clearance sales limit bargain hunting to once or twice a year.
In the past, many retailers would introduce merchandise at high prices and then mark down 
many items by as much as 60 percent to increase store traffic and improve inventory turnover. 
This caused customers to wait for price reductions and treat initial prices skeptically. Today, more 
retailers start out with lower prices and try to run fewer sales and apply fewer markdowns than 
before. Nonetheless, a big problem facing some retailers is that they have gotten consumers too 
used to buying when items are discounted.
One interesting example of markdown management support is Markdown Manager software 
that eBay offers as a service for its sellers (http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/items_on_sale.html).

Part 6  •  Merchandise Management and Pricing
1.	 To describe the role of pricing in a retail strategy and 
to show that pricing decisions must be made in an 
integrated and adaptive manner. Pricing is crucial to 
a retailer because of its interrelationship with overall 
objectives and the other components of the retail strat-
egy. A price plan must be integrated and responsive—
and provide a good value to customers.
2.	 To examine the impact of consumers; government; 
manufacturers, wholesalers, and other suppliers; and 
current and potential competitors on pricing decisions. 
Before designing a price plan, a retailer must study the 
factors affecting its decisions. Sometimes, the factors 
have a minor effect on pricing discretion; other times, 
they severely limit pricing options.
Retailers should be familiar with the price elasticity 
of demand and the different market segments that are 
possible. Government restrictions deal with price fix-
ing, price discrimination, minimum prices, unit pricing, 
item price removal, and price advertising. There may be 
conflicts about which party controls retail prices; and 
manufacturers, wholesalers, and other suppliers may be 
asked to provide price guarantees (if they are in a weak 
position). The competitive environment may foster mar-
ket pricing, lead to price wars, or allow administered 
pricing.
3.	 To present a framework for developing a retail price 
strategy: objectives, broad policy, basic strategy, 
­implementation, and adjustments. This framework 
consists of five stages: objectives, broad price policy, 
price strategy, implementation of price strategy, and 
price adjustments.
Retail pricing goals can be chosen from among sales, 
dollar profits, return on investment, and early recovery of 
cash. Next, a broad policy outlines a coordinated series 
of actions, consistent with the retailer’s image and ori-
ented to the short and long run.
A good price strategy incorporates demand, cost, and 
competitive concepts. Each of these orientations must be 
understood separately and jointly. Psychological pricing; 
markup pricing; alternative ways of computing markups; 
gross margin; direct product profitability; and pricing 
below, at, or above the market are among the key aspects 
of strategy planning.
When enacting a price strategy, specific tools can 
be used to supplement the broad base of the strategy. 
Retailers should know when to use customary and vari-
able pricing, one-price policies and flexible pricing, odd 
pricing, leader pricing, multiple-unit pricing, and price 
lining.
Price adjustments may be required to adapt to inter-
nal and external conditions. Adjustments include mark-
downs, additional markups, and employee discounts. It 
is important that adjustments are controlled by a budget, 
causes of markdowns are noted, future company buy-
ing reflects prior performance, adjustments are properly 
timed, and excessive discounting is avoided.

Case 2: Adapting to the Internet of Things (IoT)*
In an era where customization and personalization are the oper-
ative words in retailing, the challenge to build closer connec-
tions with shoppers has never been greater. Ubiquitous Internet 
connectivity is driving radical transformation of a retail world 
whose epicenter of consumer intelligence, long entrenched in 
the front end and back office, has given rise to a new ecosystem 
of data derived from interconnected devices, many of which 
enable consumers to shop for just about anything without ever 
entering a store.
Not only is it now possible for people to shop for groceries 
without leaving their kitchens; but their refrigerators have the 
ability to make up the shopping lists. “We live in a hypercon-
nected world, where every device, from the phone to the fridge, 
is becoming connected to the Internet,” says Betty DeVita, 
of MasterCard Labs, a partner with Samsung in developing 
its Family Hub refrigerator. This “smart fridge” is equipped 
with the Groceries by MasterCard app, which “shows a major 
enhancement to the Smart Home environment by bringing 
consumers a simple and convenient way to shop for groceries 
directly from their kitchen.”
The Family Hub may be a game-changer for traditional 
grocery retailers, such as Wakefern Foods, which has been at the 
forefront with its popular online delivery and click-and-collect

Short Cases
Case 1: Buyer of Sports Equipment*
Recently, a sporting-goods retail chain posted a job listing for 
the position of Buyer of Sports Equipment. The applicant cho-
sen would work in Pittsburgh. Following is the position descrip-
tion placed at the National Retail Federation Job Board.
Pittsburgh has transformed itself into one of the best “made 
over towns,” evolving from steel to science, and was recently 
declared the “#1 Most Livable City” for the second time in the 
last three years! With a national average of 40 percent lower 
cost of living, Pittsburgh is also sixth in the United States for 
job growth. There are about 3,200 high-tech companies; and 36 
colleges and universities surround the area. With its low crime 
rate, arts and leisure, and sports teams, Pittsburgh appeals to 
audiences of all ages.

Case 3: High Marks by Suppliers and Wholesalers 
for Convenience Stores*
On a broad scale, 2015 was an interesting year for the United 
States and, with the presidential election, 2016 promised to be 
every bit as exciting. The same can be said about the conve-
nience store industry. Based on the results of an outlook survey 
conducted in early November 2015 by the National Associa-
tion for Business Economics, the average forecast for growth 
in 2016 was 2.6 percent, down slightly from 2.7 percent in its 
previous survey conducted in September 2015.
The panel of 49 business economists expected the jobs 
market to continue strengthening in 2016, with unemployment 
dropping to 4.7 percent by the end of 2016, down from 5 per-
cent in December 2015. The experts lowered their earlier fore-
casts on a variety of measures of economic health, including 
housing starts and industrial production. Looking further down 
the road, two-thirds of the business economists surveyed expect 
potential economic growth of between 2 percent and 2.5 percent 
over the next 5 years.
When it comes to convenience and fuel retailing, at least 
one side of the equation entered 2016 with an upbeat attitude. 
As part of the Industry Forecast Study, Convenience Store News 
conducted its first Supplier Forecast Study to complement the 
Retailer Forecast Study. The majority of convenience-store sup-
pliers and wholesalers that participated had a favorable outlook 
when it came to the 2016 economic picture.
Notably, 41.7 percent had a “very positive” view of the 
overall conditions of the U.S. economy, 28.6 percent had a “pos-
itive” view, and 10.4 percent had a “slightly positive” view. On 
the other hand, at the beginning of that year, only a combined 
12.8 percent viewed the U.S. economy of 2016 negatively.
When asked about their particular product categories, the 
supply side of convenience retailing did hedge bets a little. 
Although overwhelmingly positive, those indicating they were 
very positive about their particular product category dipped to 
35.5 percent, followed by 28.7 percent who were positive and 
16.4 percent who were slightly positive. No respondents from 
either the supplier or wholesaler communities said they were 
very negative on their product category, and only 6.5 percent 
said they were slightly negative.
Stacking up the convenience channel against the other 
retail channels they serve, c-store suppliers and wholesalers 
gave convenience high marks for performance. A whopping 
86.7 percent of respondents placed convenience in the positive 
column when asked to rate conditions in the retail channels 
where they work. This rating placed convenience squarely in 
front of all competing channels, with drugstores coming in sec-
ond at a 65.4-­percent positive rating. See Table 1.
The Supplier Forecast Study also asked participants to 
weigh in on what the key factors for retailers’ success in 2016 
would be. New product development, an uptick in consumer 
spending, and growth in store count were the top factors 
cited. The study also asked c-store suppliers and wholesalers 
to list their top concerns for 2016. Although some mentioned 
fad brands and private-label brands, the issues weighing most

services. The supermarket cooperative—whose members oper-
ate 250 ShopRite supermarkets in New Jersey, New York, Penn-
sylvania, Connecticut, Delaware, and Maryland—has teamed 
up with MasterCard to integrate its online grocery shopping 
service, ShopRite from Home, with Groceries by MasterCard, 
which is preloaded in new Samsung Family Hub refrigerators 
and allows consumers to order directly from the fridge using a 
built-in screen.
ShopRite customers can use the appliance’s integrated 
tablet to order groceries from their own kitchens by schedul-
ing in-store pickups or at-home delivery with a few taps on 
the Family Hub refrigerator. Using the Groceries app’s secure, 
easy-to-navigate interface, customers also have the ability to 
add products to a ShopRite shopping basket and pay online. 
Items are added to a cart and paid for in a simple, single check-
out experience that accepts any U.S.-issued credit and debit 
cards. Orders are delivered directly by the merchants and aren’t 
dependent on a third-party or concierge service, making shop-
ping more efficient.
DeVita notes that features such as cameras within the 
fridge and a companion mobile app will allow consumers to 
view contents and shop on the go using the device most con-
venient to them, with the highest level of security. “Multiple 
members of the family can add to the shopping list and build 
a single cart over the week. Final approval and submission of 
the cart is secured through a four-digit PIN to allow more con-
trol and avoid ordering duplicate items. Virtual-aisle shopping 
technology allows consumers to search for their favorite brands 
across multiple grocers. Since the app directly connects grocers, 
consumers are able to access deals and coupons, and there is no 
markup on delivery charges.”
The family cart is intelligent and learns from shopping 
habits, and MasterCard is continuing to work with partners to 
create simple and convenient experiences. “Consumers appre-
ciate the convenience, and merchants value having another 
way to engage with customers and build their brands,” DeVita 
observes.
Groceries by MasterCard was developed in a partnership 
between MasterCard Labs and Samsung. At the 2016 refrig-
erator launch, consumers were able to shop and select their 
needed items and favorite brands from leading online gro-
cer and key integration partner FreshDirect, as well as from 
ShopRite. Groceries by MasterCard is creating a new chan-
nel of consumer engagement for fellow online launch partners 
FreshDirect and MyWebGrocer, whose respective executives 
are equally pumped about the prospects for seamless consumer 
convenience.

Case 4: Data-Driven Pricing*
Retailers are under pressure to improve profitability and gain a 
greater percentage of spending, so it’s not surprising that more 
firms realize the value of price optimization to increase same-
store sales and improve their competitive position. But how can 
retailers best optimize pricing? Experts advise them to move 
away from a “gut-feel” approach to a data-driven pricing strat-
egy. That should lead to the right offer, at the right location, at 
the right price, with the right range of products to gain a greater 
share of shoppers’ wallets.
Karen Dutch of Revionics (a provider of price optimization 
solutions), comments, “Pricing needs to be strategically driven 
and technology-enabled. Demand-based optimization provides 
a granular view of shopper and competitor behavior, blended 
with business and financial strategy and rules, enabling retailers 
to surgically execute competitive positions while maximizing 
profit opportunities.”
One retailer that has validated its approach to price opti-
mization is Roundy’s Supermarkets, the $4 billion operator 
of 150 stores in Wisconsin and Illinois under four banners: 
Mariano’s, Metro Market, Copps, and Pick ‘n Save. “We’re 
looking to increase sales and margins, while improving price 
perception,” states Laura Roehl, vice-president of pricing. 
“Those goals can be at odds with each other, particularly in 
the short term. This is where we saw the need for a data-
driven tool. We also wanted to improve price integrity and 
consistency.”
Roehl cites five lessons from Roundy’s price optimization 
work with Revionics, which enabled its stores “to thrive in  
hypercompetitive markets”:
▶
▶For a smooth transition, pre-work and setup are crucial 
prior to implementation.
▶
▶A review suggests details using knowledge (promotional 
plans, etc.) to complement pricing strategy.
▶
▶Fine-tune the tool after initial installation for better  
results.
▶
▶Document and measure results for management review.
▶
▶Price optimization provides visibility to elasticity in a way 
that was previously unavailable.
“Roundy’s effectively uses the solution with a customer-
focused approach,” notes consultant Mark Kelso, of Price Revo-
lution, who spoke with Roehl at FMI Connect. “Their process 
has resulted not only in improvements in unit movement, sales, 
and gross margin, but has also reduced the amount of time spent 
on developing price recommendations.”
SAS lists several other retailers that have benefited from 
deploying a price optimization strategy:
▶
▶A midsize North American grocer integrates regular price 
and promotional price activity, letting the firm take into 
account promotional activity across a timeline to achieve 
overall pricing goals.
▶
▶A European grocer uses price optimization as part of its 
category review process. It was able to identify a combina-
tion of price increases and price decreases to meet category 
financial objectives.
▶
▶A North American regional grocer used localized segmen-
tation and promotion optimization to develop new circu-
lars customized to neighborhood markets, leading to an 
increased revenue of 3 to 5 percent.
Howard Langer, of Dunnhumby, advocates customer-cen-
tric pricing because consumers respond to prices differently. 
Thus, he notes that retailers need to understand which custom-
ers buy which products, and then set pricing strategies from 
there. “Instead, most retailers evaluate what competitors are 
doing with pricing and product costs. This compare-and-con-
trast strategy will no longer work, as it no longer resonates with 
the consumer—who expect personalized experiences. Until

According to NCR’s Todd Michaud, the biggest mistake a 
retailer can make is adopting price management and optimiza-
tion systems without a price strategy known, understood, and 
thought through before, during, and after implementation. He 
says pricing systems are typically underused by firms, with most 
using only a fraction of available technology, due to a “lack of 
comprehensive pricing strategies.” This can include competi-
tive and loyalty-pricing strategies, private label positioning,

Comprehensive Case
Knocking Off the Knockoffs?*
Introduction
As E-commerce numbers grow, counterfeiters are heading 
online. Producers of knockoff merchandise are busy all year 
long, but the holiday season of 2015 may have set records for the 
sheer volume of bogus goods that entered the marketplace, with 
E-commerce earning the dubious distinction of leading the way.
“The growth of counterfeit merchandise available can be 
directly attributed to the growth of online sales,” says Andrew 
Brodsky, commercial director of NetNames, a firm specializing 
in online brand protection and anticounterfeiting services.
“It’s harder for the counterfeiters to get their products into 
the supply chain headed for bricks-and-mortar stores, but the 
Internet makes it possible for counterfeiters to flourish, as they’re 
hiding behind the anonymity of a Web site or online marketplace.”
“Sophisticated” Web Sites
As retailers ramped up for the holiday selling season, so did 
the counterfeiters targeting shoppers who were searching for 
tremendous deals, suggests Charlie Abrahams, senior vice-
president at MarkMonitor, another firm engaged in enterprise 
brand protection.
“I think [consumers] are more on the lookout for bargains and 
there is no question that searching for ‘cheap brand X’ or ‘sale brand 
X’ plays right into the counterfeiters’ hands, who regularly purchase 
domain names and paid search ads with that sort of nomenclature,” 
Abrahams says. “Talking to the luxury brands in particular, they are 
unlikely to take properties such as ‘cheap brand x.”’
MarkMonitor, in conjunction with research firm Opinium, 
produces an annual survey of consumer online shopping habits. 
Its most recent survey found that nearly one-quarter (24 per-
cent) of consumers have bought a product online that turned 
out to be fake.
According to the 2015 MarkMonitor Online Barometer: 
Global Consumer Shopping Habits Survey, “Younger consum-
ers are more likely to have bought counterfeit goods or said they 
would be willing to do so in the future.” Therefore, the “preva-
lence of buying counterfeit items online looks set to increase 
for the foreseeable future due to those younger consumers.” 
Nearly 40 percent of the survey respondents aged 18 to 34 had 
previously purchased counterfeit items and 42 percent said that 
they would purchase counterfeit items again.
The survey further found that as consumers’ online shop-
ping increases during the holiday season—stepping up by about 
15 percent, on average—counterfeiters display “a high level of 
sophistication in developing Web sites,” so “it can be very dif-
ficult to recognize a genuine site over one selling a counterfeit 
one.” The result is that in the E-commerce channel, “which has 
again broken records” for holiday season selling, “we would 
expect the level of counterfeit sales online to have matched that,” 
Abrahams says. Between Black Friday and Christmas Eve, 2015, 
retail sales (excluding automobiles and gasoline) rose 7.9 per-
cent, while E-commerce sales increased 20 percent compared to 
the prior year, according to MasterCard Advisors’ research data.
In addition to the various types of luxury-branded apparel 
and accessories—typically among the most counterfeited goods 
that are sold in the Web and through the mobile marketplace—
NetNames found that IO Hawk hoverboards and Stars Wars 
merchandise, including an app-enabled BB-8 and the Jedi Mas-
ter Lightsaber, were among the most popular fakes during the 
2015 holiday season. This was discouraging to retailers selling 
authentic merchandise. See Table 1.
“Our general rule of thumb is that the most popular items 
are the ones that are the most likely to be counterfeited,” says 
Brodsky. “Some [genuine] products are faked enough to even 
have YouTube videos about them explaining how to tell if [the 
consumers] have gotten a fake or the real thing.”
The situation can sometimes be dire for sellers of authen-
tic merchandise. For example, when NetNames looked into 
the hoverboards, says Brodsky, “we found that less than one 
percent of all of the online marketplace listings which made 
reference to the 10 Hawk hoverboard brand name actually rep-
resented genuine products.”

There is no end to what can be counterfeited, says Marcella Bal-
lard, a former prosecutor and intellectual property partner at the

the 2016 list was released. “The USTR told Alibaba to make 
serious reforms and get rid of the rampant counterfeit problem 
on its sites; and the American Apparel & Footwear Associa-
tion (AAFA) agrees.” The USTR criticized Alibaba’s enforce-
ment system, saying it is “too slow, difficult to use, and lacks 
transparency.” The AAFA advocated Alibaba’s inclusion on the 
Notorious Markets list, noting that its apparel and shoe man-
ufacturing members “face enormous difficulty working with 
Taobao in solving the problem of counterfeits,” said Duggan. 
“Meanwhile, illegal merchandise continues to proliferate.”
Taobao was removed from the Notorious Markets list 
in December 2012, with the USTR saying then that Taobao 
“worked with rights holders to significantly decrease the list 
of infringing products for sale at its Web site, and committed 
to continue to streamline its complaint procedures to further 
reduce listings of counterfeit products.” Alibaba spent a reported 
$460,000 on lobbying to have Taobao removed from list.
In response to the most recent criticism from the USTR, 
Alibaba hired a former U.S. Justice Department prosecutor and 
experienced anticounterfeiting executive who had previously 
worked with Pfizer and Apple on fake and pirated goods. At 
the time of Matthew Bassiur’s hiring, the Alibaba executive 
chairman and co-founder Jack Ma said in a statement, “We 
will continue to be relentless in our long-term commitment to 
protect both consumers and intellectual property rights owners.” 
Although Alibaba Group is based in China, it is publicly traded 
with shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Alibaba’s anticounterfeiting efforts notwithstanding, in early 
2016, a court in Beijing allowed Louis Vuitton to proceed with 
a lawsuit against three individuals alleged to have offered coun-
terfeit merchandise for sale on Taobao. That the ruling was in 
China may herald a new era in prosecuting counterfeiting cases.
The U.S. Government’s STOPfakes.gov Program**
According to the U.S. government’s STOPfakes Web site (www 
.stopfakes.gov), “STOPfakes.gov was launched to serve as a 
one-stop shop for U.S. government tools and resources on intel-
lectual property rights (IPR). The federal agencies behind 
STOPfakes.gov have developed a number of resources to

Venable law firm in New York. “Mouthwash, batteries, cloth-
ing, pharmaceuticals, brake pads,” she says, “every consumer 
product imaginable is a target of counterfeiters.”
To illustrate her point, she refers to a case involving a ciga-
rette-paper manufacturer that makes its products in one facility 
in France and involves a number of unusual materials, including 
flax fiber and natural gum arabic. Last summer, her firm success-
fully executed seizure orders on both the retailers and wholesal-
ers found to be selling counterfeit Zig-Zag paper products.
Aside from such incidents, Ballard agrees with Brodsky and 
Abrahams that E- and M-commerce [mobile] is where the coun-
terfeiters’ attention is really focused today. “It’s a growth industry,” 
she says. “Chinese counterfeiters have huge global auction sites 
such as Alibaba where they can get their products to consumers.” 
According to Brodsky, “An astounding amount of counterfeit and 
gray-market goods comes from China, which is responsible for 
approximately 70 percent of worldwide seizures of these goods, 
with little evidence that this tidal wave is being stemmed.” He says 
that counterfeit goods are likely to be available on E-commerce 
marketplaces, “either independent sites specifically set up to mar-
ket fakes or on platforms such as Taobao or AliExpress.”
China manufactures goods in so much volume “that it is 
not surprising that a lot of counterfeit merchandise originates 
there,” Abraham says. “When it is sold via Web sites or online 
marketplaces, it will generally be shipped direct to the con-
sumer in individual packages, which is what makes it so hard 
for governments to track and intercept. “The trend toward online 
shopping and direct shipping has severely impacted traditional 
anticounterfeiting physical enforcement programs, which have 
relied on intercepting large shipments of fake merchandise at 
points of entry into a country,” he comments.
The Notorious Markets List
One anticounterfeiting program is the Notorious Markets 
List (www.stopfakes.gov/article?id=Notorious-Market-Lists), 
which contains the names of businesses where the U.S. govern-
ment has determined that much counterfeit merchandise selling 
and copyright infringement occurs. Alibaba Group (which is the 
operator of a number of global Web sites including Aliexpress 
.com, Taobao.com, and Tmall.com, which are among China’s 
largest E-commerce sites) narrowly escaped being relisted on 
the Notorious Markets List released in December 2015 by the 
Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR).
The U.S. government sent a strong warning to Alibaba; 
what it said was, clean up your sites, show us the results, and

In Part Seven, the elements involved in how a retailer communicates with 
its customers are discussed. First, we look at the role of a retail image and how it is developed 
and sustained. Various aspects of a promotional strategy are then detailed.
Chapter 18 discusses the importance of communications for a retailer. We review the 
significance of image in the communications effort and the components of a retailer's image. 
The creation of an image depends heavily on a retailer's atmosphere—which is comprised 
of all its physical characteristics, such as the store exterior, the general interior, layouts, and 
displays. This applies to both store and nonstore retailers. Ways of encouraging customers to 
spend more time shopping and the value of community relations are also described.
Chapter 19 focuses on the promotional strategy, specifically how a retailer can inform, 
persuade, and remind the target market about its strategic mix. In the first part of the chapter, 
we deal with the four basic types of retail promotion: advertising, public relations, personal 
selling, and sales promotion. The second part describes the steps in a promotional strategy: 
objectives, budget, mix of forms, implementation of mix, and review and revision of the plan.

A retailer must have a strong communications strategy to properly position itself in customers’ 
minds—and to nurture their shopping behavior. As soon as customers are attracted, the 
retailer must strive to create a proper shopping mood for them.
Customer expectations keep rising, especially when it comes to in-store shopping. A 
comfortable retail shopping environment that more than satisfied customers several years ago 
is now expected. Today’s on-demand shoppers want to create their own unique shopping 
experiences, according to a Stores’ story on TimeTrade’s “Annual State of Retail Survey,” 
which gathered responses from 5,000 consumers and 100 senior retail executives.
That study suggests that there’s a lot of room for improving the in-store customer experience. 
Only 27 percent of consumers feel big-name retailers try to provide VIP-like service; when 
shopping in-store, consumers most highly value “prompt service” (54 percent), “personalized 
experience” (30 percent), and “smart recommendations” (30 percent). Lack of prompt 
assistance drives the majority of consumers (85 percent) to leave a dressing room—and the 
store—and abandon their intended purchases. And 59 percent of respondents would like store 
associates to know the items in their online shopping carts, yet only 24 percent of retailers 
have that ability.1

CHAPTER 18   •  Establishing and Maintaining a Retail Image	
461	
Overview
A retailer needs a superior communications strategy to properly position itself in customers’ 
minds, as well as to nurture their shopping behavior. When customers have been attracted, the 
retailer must strive to create an engaging shopping experience for them. Various physical and 
symbolic cues can be used to do this. See Figure 18-1. It is imperative to maximize the total retail 
experience for shoppers.
For example, researchers have found that shoppers’ experiences at online retailer Web sites 
drive their expectations of the shopping experience in stores. It is important for retailers to main-
tain “digital parity” in stores by ensuring that the stores are well stocked; providing location-
enabled, easy-to-use, in-store technology to locate and learn about products; and helping customers 
to seamlessly view in-store and online inventory to meet their shopping goals. Retailers need to 
leverage the tangible strengths of physical stores to create interactive and inspired social experi-
ences through theatrical product displays, as well as professional assistance by knowledgeable 
and friendly store associates to maximize the total retail experience for shoppers.2
This chapter describes how to establish and maintain an image. Retail atmosphere, store-
fronts, store layouts, and displays are examined. We also explore the challenge of how to encour-
age people to spend more time shopping and the role of community relations. Chapter 19 focuses 
on the common promotional tools available to retailers: advertising, public relations, personal 
selling, and sales promotion.
Although our discussion looks more at store retailers, the basic principles apply to nonstore 
retailers as well. For a mail-order firm, the catalog cover is its storefront, and the interior layouts 
and displays are the pages devoted to product categories and the individual items within them. For 
a Web retailer, the home page is its storefront, and interior layouts and displays are represented 
by links within the site.
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF RETAIL IMAGE
Image refers to how a retailer is perceived by customers and others, and positioning refers to how 
a firm devises its strategy so as to project an image relative to its retail category and its competitors— 
and to elicit a positive consumer response. To succeed, a retailer must communicate a distinctive, 
clear, and consistent image. Once its image is established in consumers’ minds, a retailer is placed 
in a niche relative to competitors. For global retailers, it can be challenging to convey a consistent 
image worldwide, given the different backgrounds of consumers.
Today’s extensive use of social media by all parties—including customers, the general pub-
lic, the media, suppliers, brands, and retailers themselves—must be thoroughly understood by 
retailers and proper strategies proactively enacted. No firm, of any size or type, is immune from 
the impact of social media content—pro and con—on its image. Social media encompass online

technology tools that allow vast numbers of people to easily communicate with one another via 
the Web and mobile devices. With social media, messages, audio, video, photos, podcasts, and 
other multimedia communications are possible. Social media are discussed further in Chapter 19.
Components of a Retail Image
Many factors contribute to a retailer’s image; it is the totality of them that forms an overall image. 
See Figure 18-2. We studied these factors in earlier chapters: target market, retail positioning, 
customer service, store location, merchandise attributes, and pricing. Our focus in this chapter and 
Chapter 19 is attributes of physical facilities, shopping experiences, community service, advertis-
ing, public relations, personal selling, and sales promotion.

It’s pretty clear that three-dimensional (3D) printing has reached 
an inflection point and is poised to revolutionize many businesses, 
one of which is the shoe business. Adidas recently unveiled a 
3D-printed prototype shoe with a sole composed of latticed lay-
ers. This 3D shoe can accurately replicate the individual shapes of 
wearers’ feet. It takes into account specific pressure points and 
requirements to create more supportive running shoes. Although 
still in the prototype stage, Adidas hopes foot-scanning technol-
ogy will allow consumers to buy running shoes that are highly 
customized and produced in-store. Think about that—retailers 
will be able to customize an item and manufacture it in the store, 
on the spot. When talk turns to reinvention of the store, this 
technology needs to be on the short list.

TECHNOLOGY IN RETAILING
The Dynamics of Creating and Maintaining a Retail Image
Creating and maintaining a retail image is a complex, multistep, ongoing process. It encompasses far 
more than store “atmosphere,” which is discussed shortly. Furthermore, with so many people having 
little time for shopping and others having less interest in it, more retailers understand that they may 
have to entertain shoppers to draw their business. Here are three examples.

	
CHAPTER 18   •  Establishing and Maintaining a Retail Image	
463	
Consider the 145,000-square-foot Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World store in Altoona, Iowa, that 
includes entertainment features such as archery ranges, miniature shooting ranges, aquariums, 
and a 3,500-square-foot area with themed artifacts, antiques, pictures, and memorabilia of hunting, 
fishing, camping, and outdoor recreation. It also has a 15,000-square-foot bowling area—“Uncle 
Buck’s Fishbowl and Grill”—with 12 10-pin lanes and underwater scenery of sharks, stingrays, 
and sea turtles that glow in the dark when guests bowl “under the ocean.” A separate upscale 
“Black Widow Billiards Parlor” features a fireplace with a screen displaying a black widow spider 
spinning its web. All Pro Bass shops strive to be destination stores with a museum, art gallery, 
antique store, aquarium, education center, and conservation and entertainment center. The stores 
engage local communities and customers with taxidermy and wildlife tours, community and Boys 
Scout events, and seminars and workshops on safely experiencing outdoor adventures.3
Jungle Jim’s International Market, with stores in Ohio (Fairfield and Cincinnati), has grown 
from a simple roadside stand to two stores, with more than 200,000-square-feet for each store. 
These stores are food amusement parks and tourist destinations, with over 150,000 different 
items from over 75 countries around the globe; each store employs an average of 350 employees. 
Jungle Jim’s has one of the largest wine collections in the United States, live seafood tanks, an in-
store cooking school, a monorail in its huge parking lot, a gated wildlife preserve with fiberglass 
animals, and a 1,000-person Oscar Event Center. Scattered around the stores are telephone poles 
disguised as giraffes that enable customers to speak to a customer service agent. Approximately 
80,000 shoppers, known as “Foodies,” visit the stores each week to interact with the animatronic 
robots that dispense or move products or sing and tell stories about the food in their sections.4
Nordstrom’s new stores have open floor plans with no segregation between departments, 
designers, or price points, allowing customers to browse seamlessly from one merchandise cat-
egory to another. These stores are wired for a full digital experience. In-store customers will be 
able to use a smartphone app to send apparel to a fitting room without having to search through 
racks. Nordstrom is testing smart fitting-room mirrors with a virtual dressing feature—the mir-
rors show shoppers how they would look in the clothes without physically wearing them. The 
mirrors can recommend accessories, such as a scarf to match a dress. The fitting rooms provide 
videos and side-by-side comparisons of the apparel a shopper tries on. Similar to online retailers, 
the mirrors can collect data on shopper preferences and how they make decisions if customers 
opt-in to the feature.5
Retailers can be classified as occupying the following retail image positions based on their 
leadership on six dimensions (price, location, store interior, product quality, selection, and service): 6
▶
▶Price leaders: These retailers focus on low prices and are more apt to offer self-service and a 
functional store environment. At these retailers, in-store shopping does not go much beyond 
what consumers can experience online. Examples are Walmart and CVS.
▶
▶Location leaders: These retailers are situated at convenient locations; they make their mer-
chandise and services available where customers need them most. Often, they do not offer 
liberal return policies or present innovative products or displays but that does not concern 
their customer base. Examples are Dollar General and a local grocery store.
▶
▶Atmospherics leaders: These retailers offer an outstanding in-store experience. The firms 
typically do not carry a wide range of product lines, and prices are higher, commensurate 
with their image. Examples are Tiffany and Abercrombie & Fitch.
▶
▶Product quality leaders: These retailers offer unique, high-quality merchandise and attractive, 
appealing displays. Examples are Whole Foods and Hallmark/Gold Crown.
▶
▶Selection leaders: These retailers offer good value on the wide range of items they sell and 
are an interesting place to shop. However, they are typically not as exciting as atmosphere 
leaders. They add new items on a regular basis and encourage shoppers to spend more time. 
They do a good job in coordinating in-store and online shopping experiences. Examples are 
Kohl’s and Bed Bath & Beyond.
▶
▶Service leaders: These retailers are conveniently located and offer shoppers good customer 
service. The sales staff has some product expertise, and information is easy to acquire. This 
type of retailer does not have a very exciting in-store environment. It is a good place to buy 
items that are planned in advance. Examples are AutoZone and Lowe’s.
Figure 18-3 shows the image presented by a membership (warehouse) store. Retailers in this 
category are price leaders.

PART 7  •  COMMUNICATING WITH THE CUSTOMER
A key goal for chain retailers, franchisors, and global retailers is to maintain a consistent image 
among all branches and with the Web site. Yet, despite the best planning, a number of factors may 
vary widely among branch stores and affect the image. They include management and employee 
performance, consumer profiles, competitors, convenient locations, parking, safety, the ease of 
finding merchandise, language and cultural diversity among customers in different countries, and 
the qualities of the surrounding area. Sometimes, retailers with good images receive negative pub-
licity. This must be countered in order for them to maintain their desired standing with the public.
ATMOSPHERE
A retailer’s image depends heavily on its “atmosphere,” the psychological feeling a customer gets 
when visiting that retailer. It is the personality of a store, catalog, vending machine, or Web site. 
“Retail image” is a much broader and all-encompassing term relative to the communication tools 
a retailer uses to position itself. For a store-based retailer, atmosphere (atmospherics) refers to 
the store’s physical characteristics that project an image and draw customers. For a nonstore-based 
firm, atmosphere refers to the physical characteristics of catalogs, vending machines, Web sites, 
and so forth. A retailer’s sights, sounds, smells, and other physical attributes all contribute to 
customer perceptions.
A retailer’s atmosphere often influences people’s shopping enjoyment, as well as their time 
spent browsing, willingness to converse with personnel, tendency to spend more than originally 
planned, and likelihood of future patronage. Many people even form impressions of a retailer before 
entering its facilities (due to the store location, storefront, easy accessibility, and other ­factors) or 
just after entering (due to displays, width of aisles, indoor temperature, and other things). They 
often judge the firm prior to examining merchandise and prices.
When a retailer takes a proactive, integrated atmospherics approach to create a certain 
“look”—properly displayed products, stimulating shopping behavior, and enhanced physical 
­environment—it engages in visual merchandising. This includes such factors as the in-store 
layout, the type of fixtures, store display windows, and aisle width—as well as how merchandise 
is visually organized, the types of lighting, in-store signage, the choice of background music, 
the paint on walls and graphics, the type of flooring, and the use of videos on in-store screens—
that encourage the target customer to shop longer. The goal of visual merchandising is to increase 
the sales per square foot.7 The best retailers recognize that they should periodically refresh their 
visual merchandising. See Figure 18-4.
Visit our blog site (www.bermanevansretail) for visual merchandising posts.
A Store-Based Retailing Perspective
Store atmosphere (atmospherics) can be divided into these key elements: exterior, general interior, 
store layout, and displays. Figure 18-5 contains a detailed breakdown of them.

465	
EXTERIOR  A store’s exterior has a powerful impact on its image and should be planned 
accordingly.
A storefront is the total physical exterior of the store itself. It includes the marquee, entrances, 
windows, lighting, and construction materials. With its storefront, a retailer can present a con-
servative, trendy, upscale, discount, or other image. Consumers who pass through an unfamiliar 
business district or shopping center often judge a store by its exterior. Besides the storefront itself, 
atmosphere can be enhanced by trees, fountains, and benches in front of the store. These intensify 
consumer feelings about shopping and about the store by establishing a relaxed environment. 
There are various alternatives in planning a basic storefront. Here are a few of them:
▶
▶Modular structure: A one-piece rectangle or square that may attach several stores.
▶
▶Prefabricated (prefab) structure: A frame built in a factory and assembled at the site.
▶
▶Prototype store: Used by franchisors and chains to foster a consistent atmosphere.
▶
▶Recessed storefront: Lures people by being recessed from the level of other stores. Customers 
must walk in a number of feet to examine the storefront.
▶
▶Unique building design: A round or pyramid-shaped structure, for example.
A marquee is a sign that displays the store’s name. It can be painted or a neon light, printed 
or script, and set alone or mixed with a slogan (trademark) and other information. The marquee 
should attract attention, as El Corte Ingles’ distinctive logo on the front of each of its department 
stores does. See Figure 18-6. Image is influenced because a marquee can be gaudy and flashy or 
subdued and subtle. The world’s best-known marquee is McDonald’s golden arches.

PART 7  •  COMMUNICATING WITH THE CUSTOMER
Store entrances require three major decisions. First, the number of entrances is deter-
mined. Many small stores have only one entrance. Department stores may have four to eight or 
more entrances. A store hoping to draw both vehicular and pedestrian traffic may need at least 
two entrances (one for pedestrians, another near the parking lot). Because front and back entrances 
serve different purposes, they should be designed separately. A factor that may limit the number 
of entrances is potential pilferage.
Second, the type of entrance(s) is chosen. The doorway can be revolving; electric,  
self-opening; regular, push-pull; or climate-controlled. The latter is an open entrance with a cur-
tain of warm or cold air, set at the same temperature as inside the store. Entrance flooring can 
be cement, tile, or carpeting. Lighting can be traditional or fluorescent, white or colors, and/or 
flashing or constant. At the bakery depicted in Figure 18-7, the exterior entrance and displays are 
inviting and designed to reinforce its image for freshness.
Third, walkways are considered. A wide, lavish walkway creates a different atmosphere and 
mood than does a narrow one. Large window displays may be attractive, but customers would not 
be pleased if there is insufficient space for a comfortable entry into the store.
Display windows have two main purposes: (1) to identify the store and its offerings and (2) to 
induce people to enter. By showing a representative merchandise offering, a store can create an 
overall mood. By showing fashion or seasonal goods, it can show it is contemporary. By showing 
sale items, a store can lure price-conscious consumers. By showing eye-catching displays that

have little to do with its merchandise offering, a store can attract pedestrians’ attention. By show-
ing public service messages (such as a sign for the Special Olympics), the store can indicate its 
community involvement.
A lot of planning is needed to develop good display windows, which leads many retailers to 
hire outside specialists. Decisions include the number, size, shape, color, and themes of display 
windows—and the frequency of changes per year. Retailers in shopping malls may not use dis-
play windows for the side of the building facing the parking lot; there are solid building exteriors. 
These retailers believe that vehicular patrons are not lured by expensive outside windows; they 
invest in displays for storefronts inside the malls.
Exterior building height can be disguised or nondisguised. With disguised building height, 
part of a store or shopping center is beneath ground level. Such a building is not as intimidating to 
people who dislike a large structure. With nondisguised building height, the entire store or center 
can be seen by pedestrians. An intimate image cannot be fostered with a block-long building, nor 
can a department store image be linked to a small site.
Few firms succeed with poor visibility. This means storefronts or marquees must be clearly 
visible to pedestrian and/or vehicular traffic. A store located behind a bus stop has poor visibility 
for vehicular traffic and pedestrians across the street. Many retailers near highways use billboards 
to attract attention from those drivers who go by quickly.
In every case, the goal is to have the store or center appear unique and catch the shopper’s eye. 
A distinctive storefront, an elaborate marquee, recessed open-air entrances, decorative windows, 
and unusual building height and size are one set of features that could attract consumers by their 
uniqueness. Nonetheless, uniqueness may not be without its shortcomings. An example is the 
multilevel “shopping-center-in-the-round.” Because this center (which often occupies a square 
city block) is round, parking on each floor level makes the walking distances very short. Yet, a 
rectangular center may have greater floor space on a lot of the same size, on-floor parking may 
reduce shopping on other floors, added entrances increase chances for pilferage, many people 
dislike circular driving, and architectural costs are higher.
As a retailer plans its exterior, the nearby stores and the surrounding area should be stud-
ied. Nearby stores present image cues due to their price range, level of service, and so on. The 
surrounding area reflects the demographics and lifestyles of those who live nearby. An overall 
area image rubs off on individual retailers because people tend to have a general perception of a 
shopping center or a business district. An unfavorable atmosphere would exist if vandalism and 
crime are high, people living near the store are not in the target market, and the area is rundown.
Parking facilities can add to or detract from store atmosphere. Plentiful, free, nearby parking 
creates a more positive image than scarce, costly, distant parking. Some potential shoppers may 
never enter a store if they must hunt for available parking. Other customers may rush in and out 
of a store to finish shopping before parking meters expire. A related potential problem is that 
of congestion. Atmospherics are diminished if the parking lot, sidewalks, and/or entrances are

jammed. Consumers who feel crushed in the crowd spend less time shopping and are in poorer 
moods than those who feel comfortable.
GENERAL INTERIOR  When customers are in a store, various elements affect their perceptions. 
Retailers must plan accordingly:
▶
▶At Anthropologie, owned by parent company Urban Outfitters, every location has its own 
visual display team to select and place each element on site to create an unique atmosphere 
reflecting the “cool home” their customers want. Antique furniture and fixtures, carefully 
sourced from around the world, enhance the sense of stability and entrenchment that customers 
seek to replicate in their own homes, thus driving purchases in-store and online.8
▶
▶Apple has been redesigning some stores to feel more like a town square, replete with trees 
and a courtyard, a fountain, free Wi-Fi, and seating outside the store for up to 200 people that 
will always be open and will host acoustic concerts. These stores will be a destination where 
Millennials want to meet and not just a place to shop. To reflect openness and make customers 
invited, aisles are wider and feature a single Apple product or a facet of the Apple lifestyle. 
There is an open space for classes and presentations, an arboretum, and leather benches where 
customers sit while customer service agents (“geniuses”) repair their products.9
▶
▶Abercrombie & Fitch wants its branded multisensory in-store experience to attract its choosy 
teen customer base and get them to linger longer and buy more products. The retailer uses 
research that shows that people’s sense of smell triggers emotional responses by introduc-
ing its own line of men’s fragrance “Fierce,” which is sprayed in stores to exude a “cool, 
good-looking” image that appeals to both male and female teenagers. This is to encourage 
purchases based on how they feel about the products rather than price. Loud club music is 
used, based on research that shows teenagers can withstand loud club music longer while 
older customers avoid it—further accentuating a youthful image. Rapid tempo in club music 
has also been shown to lead to sensory overload, thus weakening self-control and increasing 
impulsive purchases.10
The general interior elements of store atmosphere were cited in Figure 18-5. They are 
described next.
Popular flooring types used by retailers include carpet, various types of tile, and wood. Atmo-
sphere, ease of maintenance, and initial cost are important considerations.11 A plush, thick carpet 
creates one kind of atmosphere and a concrete floor another. A recent development in retail flooring 
is new printing techniques that allow images (such as company logos) to be transferred onto ceramic 
tile. This enables retailers to have the same design on porcelain tile and less-costly vinyl tile. 
Another development is the use of faux wood floors that resemble wood but have higher durability.
Bright, vibrant colors contribute to a different atmosphere than light pastels or plain white 
walls. Lighting can be direct or indirect, white or colors, constant or flashing. See Figure 18-8.

CHAPTER 18   •  Establishing and Maintaining a Retail Image	
469	
A teen-oriented apparel boutique might use bright colors and vibrant, flashing lights to foster one 
atmosphere, and a maternity dress shop could use pastel colors and indirect lighting to form a 
different atmosphere. Sometimes, when colors are changed, customers may be initially uncomfort-
able until they get used to the new scheme.
Scents and sounds influence the customer’s mood. A restaurant can use aromas to increase 
people’s appetites. A cosmetics store can use perfume scents to attract shoppers. A pet store can 
let animals’ natural scents and sounds woo customers. A beauty salon can play soft music or rock, 
depending on its customers. Slow-tempo music in supermarkets encourages people to move more 
slowly.
Store fixtures can be planned on the basis of both their utility and aesthetics. Pipes, plumbing, 
beams, doors, storage rooms, and display racks and tables should be considered part of interior 
decorating. An upscale store usually dresses up its fixtures and disguises them. A discount store 
might leave fixtures exposed because this portrays the desired image.
Wall textures enhance or diminish atmospherics. Prestigious stores often use raised wallpaper. 
Department stores are more apt to use flat wallpaper, while discount stores may have barren walls. 
Chic stores might have chandeliers, whereas discounters will likely have fluorescent lighting.
The customer’s mood is affected by the store’s temperature and how it is achieved. Insuf-
ficient heat in winter and no air conditioning in summer can shorten a shopping trip. And image 
is influenced by the use of central air conditioning, unit air conditioning, fans, or open windows.
Wide, uncrowded aisles create a better atmosphere than narrow, crowded ones. People shop 
longer and spend more if they are not pushed while walking or looking at merchandise. Although 
in-store kiosks have proven very popular, they sometimes cause overcrowding in tight retail spaces 
or create customer lines if there are not enough kiosks to handle the number of shoppers.
Dressing facilities can be elaborate, plain, or nonexistent. An upscale store has carpeted, 
private dressing rooms. An average-quality store has linoleum-floored, semiprivate rooms. A 
discount store has small stalls or no facilities. For some apparel shoppers, dressing facilities are 
a factor in store selection.
Multilevel stores must have vertical transportation: elevator, escalator, and/or stairs. Larger 
stores may have a combination of all three. Traditionally, finer stores relied on operator-run eleva-
tors and discount stores on stairs. Today, escalators are quite popular. They provide shoppers with 
a quiet ride and a panoramic view of the store. Finer stores decorate their escalators with fountains, 
shrubs, and trees. Stairs remain important for some discount and smaller stores.
Light fixtures, wood or metal beams, doors, rest rooms, dressing rooms, and vertical trans-
portation can cause dead areas for the retailer. These are awkward spaces where normal displays 
cannot be set up. Sometimes, it is not possible for such areas to be deployed profitably or attrac-
tively. However, retailers have learned to use dead areas better. Mirrors are attached to exit doors. 
Vending machines are located near restrooms. Ads appear in dressing rooms. One creative use of 
a dead area involves the escalator. It lets shoppers view each floor, and sales of impulse items go 
up when placed at the escalator entrance or exit. Many firms plan escalators so customers must 
get off at each floor and pass by appealing displays to get to the next level.
Polite, well-groomed, knowledgeable personnel generate a positive atmosphere. Ill-mannered, 
poorly groomed, uninformed personnel engender a negative one. A store using self-service mini-
mizes its personnel and creates a discount, impersonal image. A store cannot develop an upscale 
image if it is set up for self-service. Some malls and retailers use robots with facial recognition 
technology matched with social media feeds to greet shoppers by name as they walk by.12
The merchandise a retailer sells influences its image. Top-line items yield one kind of image, 
and lower-quality items yield another. The mood of the customer is affected accordingly.
Price levels foster a perception of retail image in consumers’ minds, and the way prices are 
displayed is a vital part of atmosphere. Upscale stores have few or no price displays, rely on 
discrete price tags, and place cash registers in inconspicuous areas behind posts or in employee 
rooms. Discounters accentuate price displays, show prices in large print, and locate cash registers 
centrally, with signs pointing to them.
A store with state-of-the-art technology impresses people with its operations efficiency and 
speed. One with slower, older technology may have impatient shoppers. A store with a modern build-
ing (new storefront and marquee) and new fixtures (lights, floors, and walls) fosters a more favor-
able atmosphere than one with older facilities. Remodeling can enhance store appearance, update 
facilities, and reallocate space. It often results in strong sales and profit increases after completion.

470	
PART 7  •  COMMUNICATING WITH THE CUSTOMER
Last, but certainly not least, there must be a plan for keeping the store clean. No matter how 
impressive the exterior and interior, an unkempt store will be perceived poorly. Customers asso-
ciate clean stores with overall store quality and, in the case of stores selling or serving food, the 
ability to sell food safely. Unclean and messy facilities can give customers a reason not to buy.13
STORE LAYOUT  The specifics of store layout are now sequentially planned and enacted.
ALLOCATION OF FLOOR SPACE  Each store has a total amount of floor space to allot to selling, 
merchandise, personnel, and customers. Without this allocation, the retailer would have no idea 
of the space available for displays, signs, rest rooms, and so on:
▶
▶Selling space is used for displays of merchandise, interactions between salespeople and cus-
tomers, demonstrations, and so on. Self-service retailers apportion most space to selling.
▶
▶Merchandise space is used to stock nondisplayed items. At a traditional shoe store, this area 
takes up a large percentage of total space.
▶
▶Personnel space is set aside for employees to change clothes and to take lunch and coffee 
breaks, and for rest rooms. Because retail space is valuable, personnel space is strictly con-
trolled. Yet, a retailer should consider the effect on employee morale.
▶
▶Customer space contributes to the shopping mood. It can include a lounge, benches and/or 
chairs, dressing rooms, rest rooms, a restaurant, a nursery, parking, and wide aisles. Discount-
ers are more apt to skimp on these areas.
More firms now use planograms to assign space. A planogram is a visual (graphical) repre-
sentation of the space for selling, merchandise, personnel, and customers—as well as for product 
categories. It also lays out the retailer’s in-store placement. A planogram may be hand-drawn or 
computer-generated.
CLASSIFICATION OF STORE OFFERINGS  A store’s offerings are next classified into product group-
ings. Many retailers use a combination of groupings and plan store layouts accordingly. Special 
provisions are needed to minimize shoplifting and pilferage. This means placing vulnerable prod-
ucts away from corners and doors. Four types of groupings (and combinations of them) are most 
common:
▶
▶Functional product groupings display merchandise by common end use. A men’s cloth-
ing store might group shirts, ties, cuff links, and tie pins; shoes, shoe trees, and shoe polish; 
T-shirts, undershorts, and socks; suits; and sports jackets and slacks.
▶
▶Purchase motivation product groupings appeal to the consumer’s urge to buy products and 
the amount of time he or she is willing to spend on shopping. A committed customer with 
time to shop will visit a store’s upper floors; a disinterested person with less time will look 
at displays on the first floor. Look at the first level of a department store. It includes impulse 
products and other rather quick purchases. The third floor has items encouraging and requir-
ing more thoughtful shopping.
▶
▶Market segment product groupings place together various items that appeal to a given 
target market. A women’s apparel store divides products into juniors’, misses’, and ladies’

apparel. A music store separates CDs into rock, jazz, classical, R&B, country, and other sec-
tions. An art gallery places paintings into different price groups.
▶
▶Storability product groupings may be used for products needing special handling. A super-
market has freezer, refrigerator, and room-temperature sections. A florist keeps some flowers 
refrigerated and others at room temperature as do a bakery and a fruit store.
DETERMINATION OF A TRAFFIC-FLOW PATTERN  The traffic-flow pattern of the store is then set. A 
straight (gridiron) traffic flow places displays and aisles in a rectangular or gridiron pattern, as 
shown in Figure 18-9. A curving (free-flowing) traffic flow places displays and aisles in a free-
flowing pattern, as shown in Figure 18-10.
A straight traffic pattern is often used by food retailers, discount stores, drugstores, hardware 
stores, and stationery stores. It has several advantages:
▶
▶An efficient atmosphere is created.
▶
▶More floor space is devoted to product displays.
▶
▶People can shop quickly.
▶
▶Inventory control and security are simplified.
▶
▶Self-service is easy, thereby reducing labor costs.
The disadvantages are the impersonal atmosphere, more limited browsing by customers, and 
rushed shopping behavior.
A curving traffic pattern is used by department stores, apparel stores, and other shopping-
oriented stores. This approach has several benefits:
▶
▶A friendly atmosphere is presented.
▶
▶Shoppers do not feel rushed and will browse around.
▶
▶People are encouraged to walk through the store in any direction or pattern.
▶
▶Impulse or unplanned purchases are enhanced.

to follow. The layout of

PART 7  •  COMMUNICATING WITH THE CUSTOMER
The disadvantages are the possible customer confusion, wasted floor space, difficulties in inven-
tory control, higher labor intensity, and potential loitering. Also, the displays often cost more.
DETERMINATION OF SPACE NEEDS  The space for each product category is calculated, with both 
selling and nonselling space considered. There are two different approaches: the model stock 
method and the space–productivity ratio.
The model stock approach determines the floor space necessary to carry and display a 
proper merchandise assortment. Apparel stores and shoe stores are among those using this method. 
The sales–productivity ratio assigns floor space on the basis of sales or profit per foot. Highly 
profitable product categories get large chunks of space; marginally profitable categories get less. 
Food stores and bookstores are among those that use this technique.
MAPPING OUT IN-STORE LOCATIONS  At this juncture, department locations are mapped out. For 
multilevel stores, that means assigning departments to floors and laying out individual floors. 
What products should be on each floor? What should be the layout of each floor? A single-level 
store addresses only the second question. These are some questions to consider:
▶
▶What items should be placed on the first floor, on the second floor, and so on?
▶
▶How should groupings be placed relative to doors, vertical transportation, and so on?
▶
▶Where should impulse products and convenience products be situated?
▶
▶How should associated product categories be aligned?
▶
▶Where should seasonal and off-season products be placed?
▶
▶Where should space-consuming categories such as furniture be located?
▶
▶How close should product displays and stored inventory be to each other?

CHAPTER 18   •  Establishing and Maintaining a Retail Image	
473	
▶
▶What shopping patterns do consumers follow once they enter the store?
▶
▶How can the overall appearance of store crowding be averted?
ARRANGEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS  The last step in store layout planning is arranging indi-
vidual products. The most profitable items and brands could be placed in the best locations, and 
products could be arranged by package size, price, color, brand, level of personal service required, 
and/or customer interest. End-aisle display positions, eye-level positions, and checkout counter 
positions are the most likely to increase sales for individual items. Continuity of locations is also 
important; shifts in store layout may decrease sales by confusing shoppers. The least desirable 
display position is often knee or ankle level, because consumers do not like to bend down.
Although large retailers may sometimes use video-tracking equipment to study shoppers’ 
in-store traffic patterns, that is not feasible for small retailers. Retail store staff can visually track 
shoppers’ behavior in the store. Point-of-sale systems give merchants the ability to track customer 
purchase patterns and allow them to experiment with alternative merchandise placements and 
displays.15
Retailer goals often differ from those of manufacturers. The latter want to maximize their 
brands’ sales and push for eye-level, full-shelf, end-aisle locations, but retailers seek to maximize 
total store sales and profit, regardless of brand. Self-service retailers have special considerations. 
Besides using a gridiron layout to minimize shopper confusion, they must clearly mark aisles, 
displays, and merchandise.
Consider some of the tactics that supermarkets have employed:
▶
▶The area just past the entrance at most supermarkets is a relaxed zone with coffee shops, 
flowers, and bakeries with eye-catching displays and inviting scents to lift customer mood.
▶
▶The bullseye or “thigh to eye” zone is typically occupied by profitable products and brands, 
with specialty brands on the top and store brands at the bottom.
▶
▶“Cereal theory” means placing boxes on lower shelves, which are at eye level for children.
▶
▶Most stores have an “aisle of value” so customers walking past the “superspecials” make 
additional purchases.
▶
▶Store brands do better when located to the left of manufacturer brands since consumers read 
left to right.
▶
▶Dairy, fruits, and vegetables are located at the store perimeter, so customers walking through 
the store are exposed to nonessential items and put items in their carts.
▶
▶Virtually all stores place smaller impulse-type items near cash registers so custom-
ers waiting to pay are enticed to purchase candy, soft drinks in refrigerated cases, and 
magazines.16
INTERIOR (POINT-OF-PURCHASE) DISPLAYS  After the store layout is fully detailed, a retailer 
devises its interior displays. Each point-of-purchase (POP) display provides shoppers with 
information, adds to store atmosphere, and serves a substantial promotional role. Advantages of 
using retail displays include:
▶
▶Displays are persuasive. When located near checkout counters, displays can induce unplanned 
or impulse purchases after the customer has finished grocery shopping but before the customer 
has paid for purchases. There is no need for a salesperson or sales pressure.
▶
▶Displays create the proper placement for new products or promotions. Almost 30,000 new 
SKUs are launched just in supermarkets every year. Manufacturers use displays and in-store 
media to get retailers to display new products prominently to draw attention and educate 
consumers about product availability and attributes. Displays can help customers visualize 
how product benefits can improve their experience and increase of the product being pur-
chased. Some new products don’t have to compete for shelf space and can stand out from 
competitors.17
▶
▶Displays offer flexibility in messaging and placement. Displays can convey the same overall 
strategic message in multiple languages to varying audiences and can be placed in different 
parts of the store throughout the life cycle of the product. Newer plastic, semitransparent, 
interactive displays allow customers to see and feel the difference in product attributes.18
▶
▶Displays enhance the overall shopping experience. Displays can help shape a retail store’s 
image, re-direct store traffic, and bolster merchandising plans.19

PART 7  •  COMMUNICATING WITH THE CUSTOMER
Several types of displays are described here. Most retailers use a combination of them.
An assortment display exhibits a wide range of merchandise. With an open assortment, the 
customer is encouraged to feel, look at, and/or try on products. Greeting cards, books, magazines, 
and apparel are the kinds of products for which retailers use open assortments. In addition, food 
stores have expanded their open displays for fruit, vegetables, and candy; some department stores 
have open displays for cosmetics and perfume. With a closed assortment, the customer is encour-
aged to look at merchandise but not touch it or try it on. Computer software, CDs, and DVDs are 
pre-packaged items that cannot be opened before buying. Jewelry is usually kept in closed glass 
cases that employees must unlock.
A theme-setting display depicts a product offering in a thematic manner and sets a specific 
mood. Retailers often vary their displays to reflect seasons or special events; some even have 
employees dress for the occasion. All or part of a store may be adapted to a theme, such as Presi-
dents’ Day, Valentine’s Day, or another concept. Each special theme seeks to attract attention and 
make shopping more fun.
With an ensemble display, a complete product bundle (ensemble) is presented—rather than 
showing merchandise in separate categories (such as a shoe department, sock department, pants 
department, shirt department, and sports jacket department). Thus, a mannequin may be dressed 
in a matching combination of shoes, socks, pants, shirt, and sports jacket, and these items would 
be available in one department or adjacent departments. Customers like the ease of a purchase 
and envisioning an entire product bundle.
A rack display has a primarily functional use: to neatly hang or present products. It is 
often used by apparel retailers, housewares retailers, and others. This display must be care-
fully maintained because it may lead to product clutter and shoppers returning items to the 
wrong place. Current technology enables retailers to use sliding, disconnecting, contracting/
expanding, lightweight, attractive rack displays. A case display exhibits heavier, bulkier items 
than racks hold. Books, DVD sets, pre-packaged goods, and sweaters typically appear in case 
displays.
A cut case is an inexpensive display that leaves merchandise in the original carton. 
Supermarkets and discount stores frequently use cut cases, which do not create a warm atmo-
sphere. A dump bin—also lacking any comforting atmosphere—is a case that holds piles of 
sale clothing, marked-down books, or other products. Dump bins have open assortments 
of roughly handled items. Both cut cases and dump bins reduce display costs and project a 
low-price image.
Posters, signs, and cards can dress up all types of displays, including cut cases and dump bins. 
They provide information about product locations and stimulate customers to shop. A mobile (a 
hanging display with parts that move in response to air currents) serves the same purpose—but 
stands out more. Electronic displays are also widely used today. They can be interactive, tailored 
to individual stores, provide product demonstrations, answer customer questions, and incorporate 
the latest in multimedia capabilities. These displays are much easier to reprogram than traditional 
displays are to remodel.
A Nonstore-Based Retailing Perspective
Many atmospherics principles apply to both store and nonstore retailers. However, there are also 
some distinctions. Let’s look at the storefront, general interior, store layout, displays, and checkout 
counter from the vantage point of one type of direct marketer, the Web retailer.
STOREFRONT  The storefront for a Web retailer is the home page. Thus, it is important that the 
home page has certain appealing characteristics (see Figure 18-11):
▶
▶Prominently shows the company name and indicates the positioning of the firm
▶
▶Be inviting (a “virtual storefront” must encourage customers to enter)
▶
▶Makes it easy to go into the store
▶
▶Shows the product lines carried
▶
▶Uses graphics as display windows and icons as access points
▶
▶Have a distinctive look and feel
▶
▶Includes the retailer’s E-mail address, mailing address, and phone number
▶
▶Indicates that the retailer is involved with social media
▶
▶Be listed at various search engines

CHAPTER 18   •  Establishing and Maintaining a Retail Image	
475	
GENERAL INTERIOR  As with store retailers, a Web retailer’s general interior sets a shopping 
mood. Colors run the gamut from plain white backgrounds to stylish black backgrounds. Some 
firms use audio to generate shopper interest. “Fixtures” relate to how simple or elaborate the Web 
site looks. “Width of aisles” means how cluttered the site appears and the size of the text and 
images. The general interior also involves these elements:
▶
▶Instructions about how to use the site
▶
▶Information about the company
▶
▶Product icons
▶
▶News items
▶
▶The shopping cart (how orders are placed)
▶
▶A product search engine
▶
▶Locations of physical stores (for multichannel and omnichannel retailers)
▶
▶A shopper login for firms that use loyalty programs and track their customers
STORE LAYOUT  A Web retailer’s store layout has two components: the layout of each individual 
Web page and the links to move from page to page. Web retailers spend a lot of time planning the 
traffic flow for their stores. Online consumers want to shop efficiently, and they get impatient if 
the “store” is not laid out properly.
Some online firms use a gridiron approach, whereas others have more free-flowing Web pages 
and links. Web retailers often have a directory on the home page indicating product categories. 
Shoppers click on an icon to enter the area of the site housing the category (department) of interest. 
Many retailers encourage customers to shop for any product from any section of the Web site by 
having an interactive search engine, whereby a person types in the product name or category and 
is automatically sent to the relevant Web page. As with physical stores, online retailers allocate 
more display space to popular products and brands—and give them a better position. On pages 
that require scrolling down, best-sellers usually appear at the top and slower-sellers at the bottom.
DISPLAYS  Web retailers can display full product assortments or let shoppers choose from tailored 
assortments. This decision affects the open or cluttered appearance of a site, the level of choice,

and possible shopper confusion. Online firms often use special themes, such as Valentine’s Day. 
It is easy for them to show ensembles—and for shoppers to interactively mix and match to create 
their own ensembles. Through graphics and photos, a site can give the appearance of cut cases 
and dump bins for items on sale.
CHECKOUT COUNTER  The checkout process at a Web site can be complex: (1) Online shoppers 
worry more about the security and privacy of purchase transactions than those buying in a store. 
(2) Online shoppers often work harder to complete transactions. They must carefully enter the 
model number and quantity, as well as their shipping address, E-mail address, shipping prefer-
ence, and credit card number. They may also be asked for their phone number, job title, and so 
on, because some retailers want to build their data bases. (3) Online shoppers may feel surprised 
by shipping and handling fees, if these fees are not revealed until they go to checkout.
To simplify matters, Amazon.com has a patented checkout process—a major competitive 
advantage. Amazon.com’s “1-Click” program lets shoppers securely store their shipping address, 
preferred shipping method, and credit card information. Each purchase requires just one click to 
set up an order form.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS  Let’s examine two other issues: how to set up a proper Web site and 
the advantages and disadvantages of Web atmospherics versus those of traditional stores.
New online retailers often have little experience with Web design or the fundamentals of 
store design and layout. These firms typically hire specialists to design their sites. When busi-
ness grows, they may take Web design in-house. These are a few of the many firms that design 
online stores for small retailers: Easy Store Creator (www.easystorecreator.com); Volusion (www 
.volusion.com/ecommerce-web-design); Webfodder (www.webfodder.com); and Wix (www.wix 
.com/ecommerce/website). Wix design and hosting costs for an E-commerce store (www.wix.com/
upgrade/website) are as low as $17 monthly (if one year is paid in advance).
Compared with physical stores, online stores have several advantages. A Web site:
▶
▶Has a huge amount of space (memory) to present product assortments, displays, and 
information
▶
▶Can be tailored to the individual customer
▶
▶Can be modified daily (or even hourly) to reflect changes in demand, new offerings from 
suppliers, and competitors’ actions
▶
▶Can promote cross-merchandising and impulse purchases with little shopper effort
▶
▶Enables a shopper to enter and exit an online store in a matter of minutes
▶
▶Is a good gateway to company-run social media sites
Online stores also have potential disadvantages. A Web site:
▶
▶Can be confusing. How many clicks must a shopper make from the time he or she enters a 
site until a purchase is made?
▶
▶Cannot display the three-dimensional aspects of products as well as physical stores.
▶
▶Requires constant updating to reflect stockouts, new merchandise, and price changes.
▶
▶Is more likely to be exited without a purchase. It is easy to visit another Web site.
▶
▶Can be slow for shoppers with poor Internet connections. In this case, the situation worsens 
as more graphics and video clips are added. [Note: With the widespread use of broadband 
connections, this is not much of an issue today.]
ENCOURAGING CUSTOMERS TO SPEND MORE TIME SHOPPING
Paco Underhill, a pioneer in retail anthropology, advises retailers to encourage consumers to spend 
more time at the store because shopping time (excluding the time spent waiting in a line) is directly 
related to total spending. This insight has been supported by a variety of studies with online and 
store-based retailers that have tried to slow the shopping trip through experiential events and 
shopping environments.20 Our blog site (www.bermanevansretail.com) has posts on this topic.
Among the tactics to persuade people to spend more time shopping are experiential merchan-
dising, solutions selling, an enhanced shopping experience, retailer co-branding, and wish-list 
programs.
The aim of experiential merchandising is to convert shopping from a passive activity into 
a more interactive one, by better engaging customers. See Figure 18-12. For example, customers

at the stores of British-based fashion retailer TopShop can enjoy the London Fashion show using 
Occulus Rift headsets and then buy from the TopShop Collection.21
Origins, owned by Estee Lauder, has been remodeling its stores to encourage customers 
to sample new products, take selfies, and linger in comfortable chairs. Williams-Sonoma hosts 
cooking classes, and A. C. Moore offers weekly craft classes for customers. A local beauty store 
could have a makeup artist come in to show customers how to apply cosmetics and new products. 
Free food samples (Trader Joe’s), live music (Urban Outfitters Inc.), and product demos (Lush) 
can entice customers and keep them in the spending mood. Some stores spray aromas in various 
parts of their stores.22
Solutions selling takes a customer-centered approach and presents “solutions” rather than 
“products.” It goes a step beyond cross-merchandising. At holiday times, some retailers group 
gift items by price (“under $25, under $50, under $100, $100 and above”) rather than by product 
category. This provides a solution for the shopper who has a budget to spend but a fuzzy idea of 
what to buy. Many supermarkets sell fully prepared, complete meals that just have to be heated 
and served. This solves the problem of “What’s for dinner?” without requiring the consumer to 
shop for meal components.
An enhanced shopping experience means the retailer does everything possible to minimize 
annoyances and to make the shopping trip pleasant. Given all the retail choices facing consumers, 
retailers must do all they can so that shoppers do not have unpleasant experiences. Customers at 
some Nestle Nespresso boutiques can experience a redesigned, enhanced, personal one-on-one 
coffee shopping experience with open spaces and Nespresso Coffee Specialists who share their 
expertise, providing tastings, and personally advising customers. These specialists use mobile 
technology to recommend and prepare beverages based on each customer’s prior purchase history, 
the occasion, and their mood to help them explore and expand their coffee experience. Each of 
these boutiques also uses RFID technology so customers can conveniently purchase Nespresso 
coffee sleeves without any staff interaction and offers pick-up desks for online and mobile orders.23
Retailers can also provide an enhanced shopping experience by setting up wider aisles so 
people do not feel cramped, adding benches and chairs so those accompanying the main shopper 
can relax, using kiosks to stimulate impulse purchases and answer questions, having activities 
for children (such as Ikea’s playroom), and opening more checkout counters. What decades-old 
shopping accessory is turning out to be one of the greatest enhancements of all? It is the humble 
shopping cart, as highlighted in Figure 18-13.
Scanner-enhanced shopping carts provide shrinkage-free mobile self-checkout for retailers 
and convenience to customers. A customer can scan each product using the retailer’s app on her 
or his mobile phone before placing it in the online cart. The scanner on the shopping cart finds 
the price associated with the item name and displays the item name and price, and links the cart to  
the customer’s loyalty/mobile app account. This information is sent via Bluetooth, and the cart

and mobile app automatically sync all scanned items. If the customer removes an item, the cart 
will remove the item from the scanned items list and deduct the price from the total price. The 
app on a phone is also be updated accordingly. Pressure sensors at the bottom of the cart prevent 
customers from placing items into the cart without first scanning them; a buzzer will keep beeping 
to remind shoppers to scan the items.24
More firms participate in co-branding, whereby two or more well-known retailers situate 
under the same roof (or at one Web site) to share costs, stimulate consumers to visit more often, 
and attract people shopping together who have different preferences. Here are several examples: 
Subway in Walmart stores, Starbucks in Barnes & Noble stores, joint Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-
Robbins outlets, and numerous small retailers that sell their merchandise through Amazon.com. 
Multiple branded-food retailers that share the same space attract customers who enjoy the ability 
to order food from different menus at one location instead of selecting a stand-alone chain. Coffee 
shops and restaurants in department stores can enhance the overall shopping experience, increase 
the in-store time of shoppers who take a break from their shopping without leaving the store, and 
enhance the potential for unplanned purchases and more sales per square foot.25
Another tactic being implemented by a growing number of retailers is the wish-list program. 
It is a technique that expands on the long-standing concept of a wedding registry, and it can be 
used with virtually any products or life events. Wish lists are being used to great effect by Web 
retailers (and multichannel/omnichannel retailers) to enable customers to prepare shopping lists 
for gift items they’d like to receive from a particular store or shopping center. Amazon.com cus-
tomers use its wish list as a memory aid. Some customers use wish lists to store possible alterna-
tives so they can easily evaluate and winnow them before making their selection. Others use it as 
Consumers seeking to purchase a good or service often seek 
product reviews from such apps as TripAdvisor (www.tripadvisor 
.com); Yelp (www.yelp.com); Open Table (www.opentable.com); 
and Zagat (www.zagat.com). In addition, many consumers search 
product reviews from such firms as Amazon (www.amazon.com) 
and Home Depot (www.homedepot.com), as well as specialty 
retailer sites such as Whole Latte Love (www.wholelattelove.com). 
Despite their popularity, there are some ethical issues associated 
with these product reviews. Although some sites verify that a 
person actually purchased the reviewed item, others do not. This 
enables a competitor to place an unjustified negative review about 
another retailer or product. Many product reviews are based on 
few observer comments. Reviewers are typically not self-ranked 
by such criteria as light versus heavy shoppers or novice versus 
expert. There is typically no oversight in reviewing service recov-
ery strategies made by a manufacturer or retailer in response to 
negative reviews. Readers cannot determine whether the negative 
reviewer was contacted or a replacement product issued.
Develop a policy for placing consumers’ product reviews on 
an electronics chain’s Web site.

a “save for later” list for a future shopping session. Yet others create wish lists explicitly to send to 
friends and family by E-mail or to post a link on Facebook or Twitter to give them gift ideas. Ama-
zon disaggregates wish-list data to develop personalized recommendations for future wish lists 
and also analyzes aggregate data to apply in predictive analysis for its merchandising decisions.26
COMMUNITY RELATIONS
The way retailers interact with the communities around them can have a significant impact on 
both their image and performance. Their stature can be enhanced by engaging in such community-
oriented actions as these:
▶
▶Making sure that stores are barrier-free for disabled shoppers and strictly enforcing handi-
capped parking rules
▶
▶Showing a concern for the environment by recycling trash and cleaning streets
▶
▶Supporting charities and noting that support at the company Web site
▶
▶Participating in antidrug programs
▶
▶Employing area residents
▶
▶Running special sales for senior citizens and other groups
▶
▶Sponsoring Little League and other youth activities
▶
▶Cooperating with neighborhood planning groups
▶
▶Donating money and/or equipment to schools.
▶
▶Carefully checking IDs for purchases with age minimums
Each year, 7-Eleven makes substantial charitable contributions of cash and goods to support 
programs addressing issues such as literacy, reading, crime, and multicultural understanding. It 
also donates hundreds of thousands of pounds of food to local food banks throughout the United 
States. Walmart, Kmart, and Big Lots are among the numerous retailers participating in some type 
of antidrug program. Barnes & Noble, Target, and others participate in national literacy programs. 
Giant Food is just one of the supermarket chains that give money or equipment to schools in their 
neighborhoods.
As with any aspect of retail strategy planning, community relations efforts can be undertaken 
by retailers of any size and format. Many retailers use cause-related marketing to differentiate 
themselves and their products and build customer loyalty in highly competitive markets. Retail-
ers may choose a complementary nonprofit partner or charitable cause that their customers are 
likely to support, such as supermarkets with food banks and pet stores with no-kill animal shelters. 
Sometimes, the charitable organizations give retailers access to their members and the retailers 
donate a percentage of sales or profits to the charities.
Some cause-related marketing efforts by retailers may be met with skepticism by their cus-
tomers. Research shows that utilitarian appeals made individually (such as a cashier asking a 
shopper to donate money to a charity during the checkout process) are met with more skepticism 
than more collective appeals (such as using the store’s pubic announcement system to ask shoppers 
to buy tickets for a walkathon or golf outing).27 Massachusetts-based Jordan’s Furniture has part-
nered with a nonprofit organization to host an annual Adoption Option picnic event at its stores; 
families can meet children in state foster care and learn more about adopting them. The firm also 
sponsors clothing drives and furniture collection events throughout the year for other nonprofits.28
Chapter Summary
1.	 To show the importance of communicating with custom-
ers and to examine the concept of retail image. Cus-
tomer communications are crucial for a store or nonstore 
retailer to position itself in customers’ minds. Various 
physical and symbolic cues can be used.
Presenting the proper image—the way a firm is 
perceived by its customers and others—is an essential 
aspect of the retail strategy mix. And the growing impact 
of social media on a retailer’s image must be appreci-
ated. The components of a firm’s image are its target 
market characteristics, retail positioning and reputation, 
store location, merchandise assortment, price levels, 
physical facilities, shopping experiences, community 
service, advertising, public relations, personal selling,

PART 7  •  COMMUNICATING WITH THE CUSTOMER
and sales promotion. A retail image requires a multistep, 
ongoing approach. For chains, there must be a consistent 
image among branches.
2.	 To describe how a retail store image is related to the 
atmosphere it creates via its exterior, general interior, 
layout, and displays, and to look at the special case of 
nonstore atmospherics. For a store retailer, atmosphere 
(atmospherics) is based on the physical attributes of the 
store utilized to develop an image; it is composed of the 
exterior, general interior, store layout, and displays. For 
a nonstore firm, physical attributes of such factors as 
catalogs, vending machines, and Web sites affect image.
The store exterior is comprised of the storefront, mar-
quee, entrances, display windows, building height and 
size, visibility, uniqueness, surrounding stores and area, 
parking, and congestion. It sets a mood before a prospec-
tive customer even enters a store.
The general interior of a store encompasses its floor-
ing, colors, lighting, scents and sounds, fixtures, wall 
textures, temperature, width of aisles, dressing facili-
ties, vertical transportation, dead areas, personnel, 
self-service, merchandise, price displays, cash register 
placement, technology/modernization, and cleanliness. 
An upscale retailer’s interior is far different from a dis-
counter’s interior—reflecting the image desired and the 
costs of doing business.
In laying out a store interior, six steps are necessary: 
(a) Floor space is allocated among selling, ­merchandise, 
personnel, and customers based on a firm’s overall 
strategy. More firms now use planograms. (b) Product 
groupings are set, based on function, purchase moti-
vation, market segment, and/or storability. (c) Traffic 
flows are planned, using a straight or curving pattern. 
(d) Space per product category is computed by a model 
stock approach or sales–productivity ratio. (e) Depart-
ments are located. (f) Individual products are arranged 
within departments.
Interior (point-of-purchase) displays provide infor-
mation for consumers, add to the atmosphere, and have 
a promotional role. Interior display possibilities include 
assortment displays, theme displays, ensemble dis-
plays, rack and case displays, cut case and dump bin 
displays, posters, mobiles, and electronic displays.
For Web retailers, many principles of atmospherics 
are similar to those for store retailers. There are also key 
differences. The home page is the storefront. The general 
interior consists of site instructions, company informa-
tion, product icons, the shopping cart, the product search 
engine, and other factors. The store layout includes indi-
vidual Web pages, as well as the links that connect them. 
Displays can feature full or more selective assortments. 
Sales are lost if the checkout counter does not function 
well. There are specialists that help in Web site design. 
Compared with traditional stores, Web stores have vari-
ous pros and cons.
3.	 To discuss ways of encouraging customers to spend more 
time shopping. To persuade consumers to devote more 
time with the retailer, these tactics are often employed: 
experiential merchandising, solutions selling, enhancing 
the shopping experience, retailer co-branding, and wish-
list programs.
4.	 To consider the impact of community relations on a 
retailer’s image. Consumers react favorably to retail-
ers involved in such activities as establishing stores 
that are barrier-free for persons with disabilities, sup-
porting charities, and running special sales for senior 
citizens.

Chapter 
Objectives
1. To explore the scope 
of retail promotion
2. To study the elements 
of retail promotion: 
advertising, public 
relations, personal 
selling, and sales 
promotion
3. To discuss the 
strategic aspects of retail 
promotion: objectives,

For retailers, the main elements of their promotion strategy are advertising, public relations, 
personal selling, and sales promotion—topics we cover in this chapter.
Chris Tuff, executive vice-president and director of business development and partnerships 
at 22squared (www.22squared.com), says that marketers looking for the next hot platform 
should consider experimenting with the Imgur, Kik, YikYak, and Venmo social media apps. Tuff 
believes that a campaign created on one of these hot apps can provide a first-mover publicity 
boost.
Imgur (http:imgur.com) lets users upload any kind of media files and share them seamlessly 
with sites such as Reddit (https://www.reddit.com). This app also hosts content. Kik (www.kik 
.com), a messaging app, sends texts and content such as videos to friends and groups. YikYak 
(www.yikyak.com) is an anonymous posting board, popular on college campuses, and Venmo 
(http://venmo.com) is a personal finance app that lets users send money instantly over the 
Internet.
About 40 percent of U.S. teens use Kik, and millions of consumers use Imgur. YikYak users can 
be found at over 2,000 U.S. college campuses. Venmo is especially popular to make and share 
payments (such as splitting a taxi fare).1

CHAPTER 19   •  Promotional Strategy	
483	
Overview
Retail promotion includes any communication by a retailer that informs, persuades, and/or 
reminds the target market about any aspect of that firm. In the first part of this chapter, the elements 
of retail promotion are detailed. The second part centers on strategic aspects of promotion.
Consider the importance of promotion strategy to the brand equity of the second largest pizza 
company in the world—Domino’s Pizza. Its approach to retail promotions is largely influenced 
by its retail positioning strategy and the competitive marketplace. Domino’s reinforces its brand 
in the consumer’s mind with extensive advertising at various media channels and strengthens 
it by marketing affiliations with well-known brands such as Coca-Cola. Its U.S. franchise- and 
company-owned stores invest about $300 million annually in national, cooperative, and local 
advertising. Domino’s domestic stores are required to contribute 6 percent of their annual retail 
sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns. These funds are used for media buys, 
market research, field communications, public relations, commercial production, talent payments, 
and other activities to promote the brand. In addition to the national and market-level advertising 
contributions, domestic stores spend additional funds on local store marketing activities.2
ELEMENTS OF THE RETAIL PROMOTIONAL MIX
Advertising, public relations, personal selling, and sales promotion are the elements of promotion. 
In this section, we discuss each in terms of goals, advantages and disadvantages, and basic forms. 
A good plan integrates these elements—based on the overall strategy. For example, a movie the-
ater concentrates on ads and sales promotion (food displays), whereas an upscale specialty store 
stresses personal selling. See Figure 19-1.
Retailers devote significant sums to promotion. A typical department store, for instance, 
spends up to 4 to 5 percent of sales on ads and 8 to 10 percent on personal selling and support 
services. And most department store chains also invest heavily in sales promotions and use public 
relations to generate favorable publicity and reply to media information requests. We have several 
posts related to the retail promotion mix at our blog (www.bermanevansretail.com).
Advertising
Advertising is paid, nonpersonal communication transmitted through out-of-store mass media by 
an identified sponsor. Four aspects of this definition merit clarification:
1.	 Paid form: This distinguishes advertising from publicity (an element of public relations), for 
which no payment is made by the retailer for the time or space used to convey a message.
2.	 Nonpersonal presentation: A standard message is delivered to the entire audience, and it 
cannot be adapted to individual customers (except with the Web).
3.	 Out-of-store mass media: These include newspapers, radio, TV, the Web, and other mass 
channels, rather than personal contacts. In-store communications (such as displays) are con-
sidered sales promotion.
4.	 Identified sponsor: The sponsor’s name is clearly divulged, unlike publicity. See Figure 19-2.
Amazon has the highest annual dollar advertising expenditures among U.S. retailers—nearly 
$4 billion. However, this represents just 3.5 percent of U.S. sales. Amazon relies on targeted online 
advertising, television advertising, public relations, its Associates program (where participants get 
commissions when their customer referrals result in product sales), cooperative advertising with 
vendors, and price promotions such as percentage discounts off current purchases and inducement 
offers for discounts on future purchases subject to a minimum current purchase.3 Table 19-1 shows 
advertising ratios for several retailing categories.
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RETAILER AND MANUFACTURER ADVERTISING STRATEGIES  Retailers—other 
than national chains and online firms—usually have more geographically concentrated target mar-
kets than do manufacturers. This means they can adapt better to local needs, habits, and preferences. 
However, those retailers cannot utilize national media as readily as manufacturers. Only the largest 
retail chains and franchises can advertise on national TV programs. An exception is direct marketing 
(including the Web) because trading areas for even small firms can then be geographically dispersed.
Retail ads stress immediacy. Individual items are placed for sale and advertised over short 
time periods. Manufacturers are more often concerned with developing favorable attitudes.
Sephora, the European and 
U.S. beauty chain, has a 
well-integrated promotion 
plan—from its colorful Web 
site (www.sephora.com) to 
its stores.

Many retailers stress prices in ads, whereas manufacturers usually emphasize key product 
attributes. In addition, retailers often display several different products in one ad, whereas manu-
facturers are likely to minimize the number of products mentioned in a single ad.

	
CHAPTER 19   •  Promotional Strategy	
485	
Media rates tend to be lower for retailers. Because of this, and the desire of many manufac-
turers and wholesalers for wide distribution, the costs of retail advertising are sometimes shared 
by manufacturers or wholesalers and their retailers. Two or more retailers may also share costs. 
Both of these approaches entail cooperative advertising.
OBJECTIVES  A retailer would select one or more of these goals and base advertising efforts on 
it (them):
▶
▶To grow short-term sales
▶
▶To increase customer traffic
▶
▶To develop and/or reinforce a retail image
▶
▶To inform customers about goods and services and/or company attributes
▶
▶To ease the job for sales personnel
▶
▶To stimulate demand for private brands
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES  The major advantages of advertising are:
▶
▶A large audience is attracted. For print media, circulation is supplemented by the passing of 
a copy from one reader to another.
▶
▶The costs per viewer, reader, or listener are low.
▶
▶A number of alternative media are available (including social media), so a retailer can match 
a medium to the target market.
▶
▶The retailer has control over message content, graphics, timing, and size (or length), so a 
standardized message in a chosen format can be delivered to the entire audience.
▶
▶In print media, a message can be studied and restudied by the target market.

▶Editorial content (a TV show, a news story, etc.) often surrounds an ad. This may increase its 
credibility or the probability it will be read.

PART 7  •  COMMUNICATING WITH THE CUSTOMER
▶
▶Self-service or reduced-service operations are possible because a customer becomes aware 
of a retailer and its offerings before shopping.
The major disadvantages of advertising are:
▶
▶Standardized messages lack flexibility (except for the Web and its interactive nature). They 
do not focus on the needs of individual customers.
▶
▶Some media require large investments. This may reduce the access of small firms.
▶
▶Media may reach large geographic areas, and for retailers, this may be wasteful. A small 
supermarket chain might find that only 30 percent of an audience resides in its trading area.
▶
▶Some media require a long lead time for placing ads. This reduces the ability to advertise fad 
items or to react to some current events themes.
▶
▶Some media have a high throwaway rate. Circulars may be discarded without being read.
▶
▶A 30-second TV commercial or small newspaper ad does not have many details.
The preceding are broad generalities. The pros and cons of specific media are covered next.
MEDIA  Retailers can choose from the media highlighted in Table 19-2 and described here.
Papers (dailies, weeklies, and shoppers) represent the preferred medium for many retailers, 
having the advantages of proper market coverage, short lead time, reasonable costs, flexibility, 
longevity, graphics, and editorial association (ads near columns or articles). Disadvantages include 
the possible waste (circulation to a wider area than necessary), the competition among retailers, 
the black-and-white format, and the appeal to fewer senses than TV. To maintain a dominant posi-
tion, many papers have revamped their graphics, and some run color ads. Free-distribution shopper 
papers (“penny savers”), with little news content and delivery to all households in a geographic 
area, are popular today.
TV ads, which have grown in importance due to the rise of national and regional retailers, 
are far behind papers in retail promotion expenditures and have a lot of competition from digital 
(Web) advertising. Among the advantages are the dramatic effects of messages, large market 
coverage, creativity, and program affiliation (for sponsors). Disadvantages include high minimum 
costs, audience waste, a need for brevity and repetition, and limited availability of popular times 
for nonsponsors. Because cable TV is more focused than conventional stations, it appeals to local 
retailers.
From an advertising perspective, online retailers use Web ads to stimulate awareness and 
E-commerce. For store retailers, the Web provides information to customers about locations, 
describes products carried, lets people order catalogs, and so forth. Retailers have two opportuni-
ties to reach customers: advertising on search engines and other firms’ Web sites; and communicat-
ing with customers at their own sites. Web-based advertising has been growing at a fast pace—and 
will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. See Figure 19-3.
In a White Pages phone directory (in print or online), retailers get free alphabetical listings 
along with all other phone subscribers, commercial and noncommercial. The major advantage 
of the White over the Yellow Pages (in print or online) is that those who know a firm’s name are 
Multichannel promotion managers are often responsible for 
promotional planning and implementation in only one chan-
nel: either in-store or Web based. In contrast, the omnichannel 
promotion manager is involved with both channels. A major 
responsibility of the omnichannel manager is to ensure that 
shoppers receive a seamless experience throughout their pur-
chase journey. This is accomplished through common logos, 
the same prices, and a single customer database that shows 
the customer’s purchase history in both stores as well as on 
the Web. Omnichannel promotion managers need to better 
integrate promotion activity across channels by using Web ads 
clearly listing inventory availability, aisle location, and store 
hours at a local retail store. They may also strive to get heavy 
online customers to shop at a local store via mobile coupon-
ing; give store personnel sales commissions on orders placed by 
them at an in-store kiosk; and offer a common customer loyalty 
program that acknowledges all customer purchases regardless 
of channel.
Describe the pros and cons of using separate promotion 
managers for in-store versus online.

not exposed to competitors. The major disadvantage, in contrast with the Yellow Pages, is the 
alphabetical rather than type-of-business listing. A person unfamiliar with repair services will 
usually look in the Yellow Pages under “Repair.” In the Yellow Pages, firms pay for listings (and 
display ads, if desired) in their category. Most retailers advertise in the Yellow Pages. The advan-
tages include widespread usage by people ready to shop, and the long life (one year or more) of 
the Yellow Pages. The disadvantages are that retailer awareness may not be gained and there is 
a lengthy lead time for new ads. Note: There has been a dramatic shift to online directories and 
away from printed ones.
With direct mail, retailers send catalogs or ads to customers by the mail (including E-mail) 
or private delivery firms. Advantages are a targeted audience, tailored format, controlled costs, 
quick feedback, and tie-ins (including ads with bills). Among the disadvantages are the high 
throwaway rate (“junk mail”), poor image to some people, low response rate, and outdated mailing 
lists (addressees may have moved).
Radio is still used by a variety of retailers. Advantages are the relatively low costs, its value 
as a medium for car drivers and passengers, its ability to use segmentation, its rather short lead 
time, and its wide reach. Disadvantages include no visual impact, the need for repetition, the need 
for brevity, and waste. The use of radio by retailers has increased in recent years.
Transit advertising is used in areas with mass transit systems. Ads are displayed on buses and 
in trains and taxis. Advantages are the captive audience, mass market, high level of repetitiveness, 
and geographically defined market. Disadvantages are the ad clutter, distracted audience, lack of 
availability in small areas, restricted travel paths, and graffiti. Many retailers also advertise on 
their delivery vehicles.
Outdoor (billboard) advertising is sometimes used by retailers. Posters and signs may be 
displayed in public places, on buildings, and alongside highways. Advantages are the large size

of the ads, the frequency of exposure, the relatively low costs, and the assistance in directing new 
customers. Disadvantages include the clutter of ads, a distracted audience, the limited information, 
and some legislation banning outdoor ads.
Magazine usage (in print and online) is valuable for three reasons: the number of larger retail 
chains, the creation of regional and local editions, and the use by nonstore and omnichannel retail-
ers. Advantages are tailoring to specific markets, creative options, editorial associations, message 
longevity, and color. Disadvantages include long lead time, less sense of consumer urgency, waste, 
and declining readership.
Single-page (flyers) or multiple-page (circulars) ads are distributed in parking lots or to con-
sumer homes. Advantages include the targeted audience, low costs, flexibility, and speed. Among 
the disadvantages are the level of throwaways, the poor image to some, and clutter. Flyers are 
good for smaller firms; circulars are best used by larger ones.
Social media have become the digital hub for many retailers’ Web sites. Furthermore, social 
media such as Facebook may provide the sole digital presence for many small retailers that do not 
have a Web site. Advantages include developing interactive relationships with customers; creat-
ing excitement and suggestion selling through sharing of images (Instagram, Pinterest), videos 
(YouTube), and information and promotions (Facebook, Twitter); and providing customer service 
(Yelp), identifying new customers based on their social media profiles (Facebook and Linkedin). 
Disadvantages include the intense competition for customer “likes,” the possibility of negative 
comments, and the lack of methods to measure the impact on sales.
Mobile apps are now being developed by retailers or third-party retail intermediaries (such 
as OpenTable), and then downloaded by customers from iPhones, Android phones, and Windows 
phones. Advantages include the ability to drive traffic to stores; to provide personalized, geo- 
targeted information and time-sensitive promotions (SMS text, Snapchat); to enhance in-store expe-
riences (Home Depot, Nordstrom); to provide out-of-store product interaction ­opportunities; and 
to complete ordering, payments, and purchases through a smartphone without the need for retail 
salesperson interaction. Disadvantages include technological limitations and privacy implications.

Many smartphone-only innovations such as MikMak, the first mobile shopping video network 
app, are redefining impulse buying. MikMak creates 30-second videos (“minimercials”) for its 
retail clients. The videos combine humor and music, and enable one-touch ordering and payment 
from the app and shipping from the sellers.4 Retailers are experimenting with E-commerce chat-
bots integrated into social media messenger apps such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Slack, 
and WeChat (China). Chatbots simulate human conversation to help customers search products, 
to suggest alternatives, and to offer in-app ordering and payment help to complete purchases.5
TYPES  Advertisements can be classified by content and payment method. See Figure 19-4. Pio-
neer ads have awareness as a goal and offer information (usually on new firms, products, or 
­locations). Competitive ads have persuasion as a goal. Reminder ads are geared to loyal cus-
tomers and stress attributes that have made retailers successful. Institutional ads seek to keep 
retailer names before the public without emphasizing the sale of goods or services. Public service 
­messages are institutional.
Retailers may pay their own way or seek cooperative ventures in placing ads. Firms paying 
their own way have total control and incur all costs. With cooperative ventures, two or more par-
ties share costs and decision making.6 Billions of dollars are spent yearly on U.S. cooperative ads, 
most in vertical agreements.
In a vertical cooperative advertising agreement, a manufacturer and a retailer or a 
wholesaler and a retailer share an ad. Responsibilities are specified contractually, and retailers 
are typically not reimbursed until after the ads run. Vertical cooperative ads are subject to the 
­Robinson-Patman Act; similar arrangements must be offered to all retailers on a proportional basis. 
Advantages to a retailer are reduced ad costs, assistance in preparing ads, greater market coverage, 
and less planning time. Disadvantages to a retailer include less control, flexibility, and distinc-
tiveness. Some retailers are concerned about the eligibility requirements to participate and the  
emphasis on the supplier’s name in ads. In response, manufacturers and other suppliers are now 
more flexible and understanding.
With a horizontal cooperative advertising agreement, two or more retailers share an ad. 
A horizontal agreement is most often used by small noncompeting retailers (such as independent 
hardware stores), retailers in a shopping center, and franchisees of a firm. Advantages and disad-
vantages are similar to those in a vertical agreement. Two further benefits are the bargaining power 
of retailers in dealing with the media and the synergies when multiple retailers work together.
When planning a cooperative strategy, these questions should be considered:
▶
▶What ads qualify, in terms of merchandise and special requirements?
▶
▶What percentage of advertising is paid by each party?
▶
▶When can ads be run? In what media?

▶Are there special provisions regarding message content?

▶Do cooperative ads obscure the image of individual retailers?
Public Relations
Public relations entails any communication that fosters a favorable image for the retailer among 
its publics (consumers, investors, government, channel members, employees, and the general 
public). It may be nonpersonal or personal, paid or nonpaid, and sponsor controlled or not con-
trolled. Publicity is any nonpersonal form of public relations whereby messages are transmitted 
through mass media, the time or space provided by the media is not paid for, and there is no identi-
fied commercial sponsor.
The basic distinction between advertising and publicity is that publicity is nonpaid. Thus, it 
is not as readily controllable. A story on a store opening may not appear, appear after the fact, or 
not appear in the form desired. Yet, to shoppers, publicity is often more credible and valuable. 
Advertising and publicity (public relations) should complement one another. Therefore, on some 
occasions, it may be a good idea to try to gain positive publicity before placing ads.
Public relations can benefit both large and small retailers. Although the former often spend 
a lot of money to publicize events such as the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, small firms can 
creatively generate attention on a limited budget. They can feature book signings by authors, 
sponsor school sports teams, donate goods and services to charities, and so forth.
Social media now have a huge impact on a retailer’s public relations efforts and on the pub-
licity it receives. Consider the influence of highly interactive blogging sites (some operated by 
retailers themselves), which now number as many as 300 million worldwide and rapidly spread 
information. Bloggers as influencers may represent real customers who reach a targeted audi-
ence and whose storytelling and opinions are trusted by their followers. They may generate active 
engagement, influence purchase decisions, and help drive return on investment in a way that 
complements other marketing activities of the retailer. The business of blogging has become more 
formalized and is sometimes referred to as “influencer marketing.” Blogger behavior is changing 
in response to the increased accountability of retailers and the availability of improved metrics, 
as evidenced by findings from recent blogger surveys: 7
▶
▶Blogging was often just a hobby; today, it is sometimes a career option, with successful blog-
gers earning a good income. More bloggers post during normal business hours than at other 
times or days. Although small (16 percent), some bloggers write more posts for clients than 
for themselves. More than half of bloggers post content on behalf of clients. Bloggers can be 
classified as hobbyists, professional bloggers, company bloggers who blog on behalf of firms 
for whom they work, and entrepreneurs who blog on behalf of their own firms.
▶
▶Several blogger influence measurement services such as Alexa.com, Blogmetrics (www 
.blogmetrics.org), and others document that competition among bloggers is fierce. A small 
percentage of viewed posts has an inordinate effect on the overall traffic and followers for 
top-ranked bloggers.
▶
▶Most active bloggers post at least weekly, and some write for more than one blog. Collaborat-
ing, contributing, and responding to other bloggers’ content is mutually beneficial–by sharing 
content and sharing followers. For example, Pottery Barn’s holiday catalog is sent to several 
strong influencers, who create a set of images and posts for different channels.
▶
▶Traditionally, nearly 60 percent of blog posts have been between 500 and 1,000 words. How-
ever, longer posts (more than 1,000 words) are often more effective in generating conversions; 
and long-form content is becoming more popular.
▶
▶The time spent writing the typical blog post is more than 2.5 hours per post, with 16 percent 
of bloggers spending more than 4 hours per post and 6 percent of bloggers spending more 
than 6 hours on a typical blog post.
OBJECTIVES  Public relations seeks to accomplish one or more of these goals:
▶
▶To increase awareness of the retailer and its strategy mix
▶
▶To maintain or improve the company image
▶
▶To show the retailer as a contributor to the community’s quality of life

▶
▶To demonstrate innovativeness
▶
▶To resent a favorable message in a highly believable manner
▶
▶To minimize total promotion costs
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES  The major advantages of public relations are:
▶
▶An image can be presented or enhanced.
▶
▶A more credible source presents the message (such as a good restaurant review).
▶
▶There are no costs for message time or space.
▶
▶A mass audience is addressed.
▶
▶Carryover effects are possible (if a retailer is perceived as community-oriented, its value 
positioning is more apt to be perceived favorably).
▶
▶People pay more attention to independent (third-party) sources than to clearly identified ads.
The major disadvantages of public relations are:
▶
▶Some retailers do not believe in spending any funds on image-related communication.
▶
▶There is little retailer control over a publicity message and its timing, placement, and coverage 
by a given medium (particularly with social media).
▶
▶It may be more suitable for short-run, rather than long-run, planning.
▶
▶Although there are no media costs for publicity, there are costs for a public relations staff, 
planning activities, and the activities themselves (such as store openings).
▶
▶The Web can quickly turn a negative local story into a worldwide media blitz.
TYPES  Public relations can be planned or unexpected and image enhancing or image detracting. 
With planned public relations, a retailer outlines its activities in advance, strives to have media 
report on them, and anticipates certain coverage. Community services, such as donations and 
special sales; parades on holidays (such as the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade); the introduc-
tion of “hot” new goods and services; and a new store opening are activities a retailer hopes will 
gain media coverage. The release of quarterly sales figures and publication of the annual report 
are events a retailer knows will be covered.
When unexpected publicity occurs, media report on a company without giving it advance 
notice. TV, newspaper, magazine, Web, and other reporters may anonymously visit retail 
stores and Web sites or call customer service representatives to rate their performance 
and quality. A fire, an employee strike, or other newsworthy event may be mentioned in a 
story. Investigative reports on company practices—such as using suppliers with under-age 
­workers—may appear.
There is positive publicity when media reports are complimentary, with regard to the excel-
lence of a retailer’s practices, its community efforts, and so on. However, the media may also 
provide negative publicity. A story could describe a store opening in less than glowing terms, rap a 
firm’s environmental record, or otherwise be critical. That is why public relations must be viewed 
as a component of the promotion mix, not as the whole mix.
Personal Selling
Personal selling involves oral communication with one or more prospective customers for the 
purpose of making a sale. Retail salespeople include anyone who interacts face-to-face (or via 
the phone) with the shopper in a way that encourages that shopper to make a purchase. The level 
of personal selling used by a retailer depends on the image it wants to convey, the products sold, 
the amount of self-service, and the interest in long-term customer relationships—as well as 
­customer expectations. Retail salespeople may work in a store, visit consumer homes or places 
of work; engage in telemarketing; or engage in real-time online chat.
Customer-service–oriented retailers believe in training superior sales associates. Why? 
First, higher levels of selling are needed to reinforce the retailer’s image as customer-centric. 
Unlike self-service discounters, full-service retailers want their sales staff to frequently interact 
with and advise customers. Second, many retailers want to stimulate cross-selling, whereby 
associates recommend related items to customers. Third, sales associates may be able to “save 
the sale” by suggesting that customers who return merchandise try different colors, styles, or 
quality. And last, salespeople can help foster customer loyalty. Figure 19-5 highlights sales 
associate tips.

this Web site (www.inc

html) are quite helpful.

PART 7  •  COMMUNICATING WITH THE CUSTOMER
OBJECTIVES  The goals of personal selling are:
▶
▶To persuade customers to buy (since they often enter a store after seeing an ad)
▶
▶To stimulate sales of impulse items or products related to customers’ basic purchases
▶
▶To complete customer transactions
▶
▶To feed information back to company decision makers
▶
▶To provide proper levels of customer service
▶
▶To improve and maintain customer satisfaction
▶
▶To create awareness of items also marketed through the Web, mail, and telemarketing
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES  The advantages of selling relate to its personal nature:
▶
▶A salesperson can adapt a message to the needs of the individual customer.
▶
▶A salesperson can be flexible in offering ways to address customer needs.
▶
▶The time commitment of the customer is higher than with advertising.
▶
▶There is less audience waste than with advertising; most people who walk into a store are 
potential customers.
▶
▶Customers respond more often to personal selling than to ads.
▶
▶Immediate feedback is provided.
The major disadvantages of personal selling are that:
▶
▶Only a limited number of customers can be handled at a given time.
▶
▶The costs of interacting with each customer can be high.
▶
▶Customers are not initially lured into a store or onto a Web site through personal selling.
▶
▶Self-service may be discouraged.
▶
▶Some customers may view salespeople as unhelpful and as too aggressive.
TYPES  Most sales positions involve either order taking or order getting. An order-taking sales-
person performs routine clerical and sales functions—setting up displays, stocking shelves, 
answering simple questions, and ringing up sales. This type of selling is most likely in stores that 
are strong in self-service but also have some personnel on the floor. An order-getting salesperson 
is actively involved with informing and persuading customers and in closing sales. This is a true 
“sales” employee. Order getters usually sell higher-priced or complex items, such as real-estate, 
autos, and consumer electronics. They are more skilled and better paid than order takers. See 
Figure 19-6.
A manufacturer may sometimes help fund personal selling by providing PMs (promotional 
or push monies) for retail salespeople selling its brand. This is in addition to regular salesper-
son compensation. Many retailers dislike this practice because their salespeople may be less 
FIGURE 19-5
Tips for Retail Sales 
Personnel
Have the right state of mind and exhibit extreme politeness.
Be knowledgeable about product features, alternative suggestions, prices, company
policies, and so on.
Understand your ability to utilize employee empowerment—and be helpful whenever
you can.
Always greet the customer and make him or her feel comfortable in communicating
with you.
Ask the customer what he or she is looking to purchase and LISTEN to the answer.
Tailor your sales approach to the individual customer and his or her needs.
When appropriate, try to cross-sell related items.
Do not be “pushy.”
Be honest and ethical in all customer interactions.
Never argue with the customer or lose your temper.
If you interact with more than one customer at a time, make sure all customers see that
you are fair with your attention to each one.
Wrap merchandise carefully.
Maintain the appearance of the department; clean up when necessary.
Be pleasant when customers return products and make the experience as “hassle-free”
as possible.

responsive to actual customer desires (if customers desire brands that do not yield PMs for the 
salespeople).
FUNCTIONS  Store sales personnel may be responsible for all or many of the tasks shown in 
­Figure 19-7 and described next. Nonstore sales personnel may also have to generate customer leads 
(by knocking on doors in residential areas or calling people who are listed in a local phone directory).
On entering a store or a department in it (or being contacted at home), a salesperson greets 
the customer. Typical in-store greetings are: “Hello, may I help you?” “Hi, is there anything in 
particular you are looking for?” With any greeting, the salesperson seeks to put the customer at 
ease and build rapport.
The salesperson next finds out what the person wants: Is the person just looking, or is there a 
specific good or service in mind? For what purpose is the item to be used? Is there a price range 
in mind? What other information can the shopper provide to help the salesperson?

PART 7  •  COMMUNICATING WITH THE CUSTOMER
At this point, the salesperson may show merchandise. He or she selects the product most apt 
to satisfy the customer. The salesperson may try to trade up (discuss a more expensive version) or 
offer a substitute (if the retailer does not carry or is out of the requested item).
The salesperson now makes a sales presentation to motivate the customer to purchase. The 
canned sales presentation is a memorized, repetitive speech given to all customers interested 
in a particular item. It works best if shoppers require little assistance and sales force turnover is 
high. The need-satisfaction approach is based on the principle that each customer has different 
wants; thus, a sales presentation should be geared to the demands of the individual customer. It 
is being used more in retailing.
A demonstration can show the utility of an item and allow customer participation. Demonstra-
tions are often used with sound systems, autos, health clubs, and watches.
A customer may have questions, and the salesperson must address them. After all questions 
are answered, the salesperson tries to close the sale and get the shopper to buy. Typical closing 
lines are: “Will you take it with you or have it delivered?” “Cash or charge?” “Would you like 
this gift wrapped?”
For personal selling to work well, salespeople must be enthusiastic, knowledgeable, interested 
in customers, and good communicators. Figure 19-8 cites several ways that retail sales can be lost 
through poor personal selling and how to avoid these problems.8
Sales Promotion
Sales promotion encompasses the paid communication activities other than advertising, public 
relations, and personal selling that stimulate consumer purchases and dealer effectiveness. The 
purpose of a promotional campaign is to build sales in the short term—or sometimes as a long-
term strategy of constant promotional pushes to reach sales goals. It includes displays, contests, 
sweepstakes, coupons, frequent shopper programs, prizes, samples, demonstrations, referral gifts, 
and other limited-time selling efforts outside of the ordinary promotion routine.
The main priority of a sales promotional strategy should be to maximize profit by selling 
as many units as possible at full price within the “prime season,” and then to sell the remaining 
units at lower price. A retail promotion calendar is often based on sales history and a projection 
of the assortment plan for the current period. Then, the retailer plans to use various promotional 
tools to drive greater revenues by creating excitement, urgency, or price satisfaction at various 
times during the selling period. At the start of a season, full-margin sales can be driven by “prime” 
­promotions—displays, upsells, and campaigns designed to promote and sell the intrinsic value and 
unique selling attributes of merchandise. As the season progresses, actual performance is tracked, 
with both better and worse results than planned taken into account. More promotions may then be 
used—such as loss leaders, markdowns, and deals (buy pants to get a polo T-shirt free) to stimulate

Selected Reasons 
Retail Sales Are 
Lost—and How to 
Avoid Them
Poor qualiﬁcation of the customer.     Obtain information from the customer so the sales 
presentation is properly tailored.
Salespersons not demonstrating the good or service.     Show the good or service in use so that 
beneﬁts are visualized.
Failure to put feeling into the presentation.     Encourage salespeople to be sincere and 
consumer-oriented.
Poor knowledge.     Train salespeople to know the major advantages and disadvantages of the 
goods and services, as well as those of competitors, and be able to answer questions.
Arguing with a customer.     Avoid arguments in handling customer objections, even if the 
customer is wrong.
No suggestion selling.     Attempt to sell related items (such as service contracts, product 
supplies, and installation).
Giving up too early.     Try again if an attempt to close a sale is unsuccessful.
Inﬂexibility.     Be creative in oﬀering alternative solutions to a customer’s needs.
Poor follow-up.     Be sure that orders are correctly written, that deliveries arrive on time, 
and that customers are satisﬁed.

as well as via digital and mobile media. In-store media placed in more than 61,000 food, drug, 
mass, and office supply stores, reach up to 75 million households monthly. SmartSource provides 
information, coupons, recipes, rebates, and sweepstakes forms in the store. It also supplies samples 
that generate trial use for nonbrand or noncategory customers, or that influence “switchers” to buy 
the advertised brand over others of which they are aware., or that remind loyal users to buy the 
product. Mobile solutions include the SmartSource Direct2Card that is integrated into a retailer 
mobile app so consumers can download offers to their loyalty cards and then present the cards at 
checkout to have the savings automatically applied.10
OBJECTIVES  Sales promotion goals are:
▶
▶To increase short-term sales volume
▶
▶To maintain customer loyalty
▶
▶To emphasize novelty
▶
▶To complement other promotion tools
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES  The major advantages of sales promotion are that:
▶
▶It often has eye-catching appeal.
▶
▶Themes and tools can be distinctive.
▶
▶The consumer may receive something of value, such as coupons or free merchandise.
▶
▶It helps draw customer traffic and maintain loyalty to the retailer.
▶
▶Impulse purchases are increased.
▶
▶Customers can have fun, particularly with promotion tools such as contests and demonstrations.
The major disadvantages of sales promotion are that:
▶
▶It may be hard to terminate certain promotions without adverse customer reactions.
▶
▶The retailer’s image may be hurt if trite promotions are used.
▶
▶Frivolous selling points may be stressed rather than the retailer’s product assortment, prices, 
customer services, and other factors.
▶
▶Many sales promotions have only short-term effects.
▶
▶It should be used mostly as a supplement to other promotional forms.
TYPES  Figure 19-9 describes the major types of sales promotions. Each is explained here. Point-
of-purchase promotion consists of in-store displays designed to lift sales. Displays may remind 
customers, stimulate impulse behavior, facilitate self-service, and reduce retailer costs if manu-
facturers provide the displays. See Figure 19-10. These data show the extent of displays:
▶
▶We estimate that U.S. manufacturers and retailers together annually spend more than $20 
billion on in-store displays, with retailers using about two-thirds of all displays provided by 
manufacturers.
▶
▶Virtually all retailers have some type of point-of-purchase display.
▶
▶Restaurants, apparel stores, music/video stores, toy stores, and sporting goods stores are 
among the retail categories with above-average use of in-store displays.
Visit the site of Shop!, the 
leading point-of-purchase 
trade association (www 
.shopassociation.org).
Some retailers purchase goods especially for promotions during 
key periods such as pre-Christmas sales, Black Friday, and Cyber 
Monday. Many shoppers defer purchasing items at other times, 
preferring to buy during these special sales—anticipating that 
retailers will offer especially attractive prices at these times. Some 
retailers feature promotional goods that are especially produced 
for these times. For example, although a promotional good could 
be produced by a well-respected television manufacturer, it may 
have a lower resolution monitor and less powerful speakers. 
There are advantages to selling promotional goods for retailers. 
The goods enable retailers to achieve high levels of store traffic, 
to generate high inventory turnover on these goods, and to main-
tain traditional profit margins. These goods also provide retailers 
with an opportunity to trade up consumers to more costly items.
Discuss the pros and cons of promotional goods from a con-
sumer perspective.

Types of Sales Promotion
Point-of-purchase
Window, ﬂoor, and counter displays that allow a retailer to

Sometimes, the displays are supplied by manufacturers.
Type
Description
Contests
Customers compete for prizes by completing a contest (game),
such as a crossword puzzle, a slogan, or a football lottery.
Winning is at least partially based on a correct answer (skill).
Sweepstakes
Similar to a contest, except that participants merely ﬁll out
application forms and the winner is picked at random (chance).
No skill is involved. Direct-mail retailers use this tool quite often.
Coupons
Retailers advertise special discounts for customers who
redeem advertised coupons. Customers clip coupons from
print media or POP displays, and redeem them with the retailer.
Frequent shopper
programs
Customers are given points or discounts based on the dollar
amounts of their purchases. The points are accumulated to
acquire goods or services.
Prizes
Similar to frequent shopper programs, except that the retailer
gives prizes immediately, such as glasses, silverware, and others. 
Usually, one piece of a set is obtained with each purchase.
Samples
Free tastes or smells of items are given to customers.
Demonstrations
Products are shown cleaning up ﬂoors, mixing foods, and so on.
Services are also demonstrated (e.g., judo instructions).
Referral gifts
Presents or gifts are given to current customers when they 
bring in new customers.
Matchbooks, pens,
calendars, shopping
bags, etc.
Items that contain the retailer’s name are given to customers.
Special events
Include fashion shows, autograph sessions with book authors,
art exhibits, and holiday activities (such as children’s rides).
▶
▶Retailers spend one-sixth of their sales promotion budgets on displays.
▶
▶Display ads appear on shopping carts in most U.S. supermarkets. And thousands of super-
markets have electronic signs above their aisles promoting well-known brands.
Contests and sweepstakes are similar; they seek to attract customers who participate in events 
with large prizes. A contest requires a customer to show some skill. A sweepstakes only requires 
participation, with the winner chosen at random. Disadvantages of contests and sweepstakes are 
their costs, customer reliance on these tools for continued patronage, the customer effort, and 
entries by nonshoppers. Together, we project that U.S. manufacturers and retailers spend $2 ­billion 
yearly on contests and sweepstakes.

Each year, hundreds of billions of dollars in coupons—discounts from regular selling prices—
are distributed in the United States, with grocery products accounting for two-thirds of them. 
Consumers redeem $4 billion in coupons annually; retailers receive several hundred million dollars 
for processing coupon redemptions. Coupons are offered through freestanding inserts in Sunday 
papers and placements in daily papers, direct mail, Web sites, smart phones, regular magazines, 
and Sunday newspaper magazines. They are also put in or on packages and dispensed from store 
machines.11
Coupons have four key advantages: (1) In many cases, manufacturers pay to advertise and 
redeem them. (2) According to surveys, about 85 percent of consumers redeem coupons at least 
once during the year. (3) They contribute to the consumer’s perception that a retailer offers good 
value. (4) Effectiveness can be measured by counting redeemed coupons. Disadvantages include 
the possible negative effect on the retailer’s image, consumers shopping only if coupons are 
available, the low redemption rates, coupon clutter, retailer and consumer fraud, and handling 
costs. Due to the large number of coupons distributed, less than 3 percent of them are redeemed 
by consumers.

PART 7  •  COMMUNICATING WITH THE CUSTOMER
Frequent shopper programs foster customer relationships by awarding discounts or prizes 
for continued patronage. In most programs, customers accumulate points (or the equivalent) that 
are redeemed for cash, discounts, or prizes. Programs following these principles are most apt to 
succeed in the following ways:
1.	 Customer data are regularly collected. This enables the retailer to personalize rewards based 
on customer preferences and past purchases. When there are many “lapsed customers” in 
the database, it may be a good tactic to offer an instant reward to encourage these former 
shoppers to return. According to one survey, discounts on merchandise are the most important 
motivator.12
2.	 A loyalty program’s format, rewards, and manner of communications have to be crafted 
to be relevant to the specific customer group. Loyalty programs offered through mobile 
apps can be personalized based on the individual shopper’s purchase history and browsing 
behavior.
3.	 A membership card in a shopper’s wallet can be a constant reminder of the benefits of the 
loyalty program of a given retailer.
4.	 A good loyalty program builds excitement by letting customers know exactly what rewards 
they can expect, how to earn them, and how they are progressing to a reward goal.
5.	 For a loyalty program to reach a high level of customer participation, rewards should be 
readily obtainable and incremental to transform more customers from low value to high 
value.
6.	 When intangible and exclusive services and experiences are provided at higher levels of 
rewards, customers will brag about reaching special membership status. This will pro-
pel even more repeat business and may politely nudge those who are in a lower reward 
category.
7.	 A loyalty program can be used as part of regular digital communications with customers. 
Retailers can send follow-up messages after each purchase and communicate frequently to 
introduce new perks and special offers.13
The advantages of frequent shopper programs for retailers are the loyalty (customers amass 
points only by shopping at a specific firm or firms), the increased shopping, and the competi-
tive edge for a retailer similar to others. However, some consumers feel these programs are not 
really free and would rather shop at lower-priced stores without loyalty programs. These shop-
pers believe it will take too long to gather enough points to earn meaningful gifts, and retail profit 
margins may be smaller if firms with these programs try to price competitively with those without 
the programs.
Prizes are similar to frequent shopper programs, but they are given with each purchase. They 
are most effective when sets of glasses, silverware, dishes, place mats, and so on are distributed 
one at a time to shoppers. These encourage loyalty. Problems are the cost of prizes, the difficulty 
of termination, and the possible impact on image.
Free samples (food tastings) and demonstrations (cooking lessons) can complement personal 
selling. We estimate that more than $2.5 billion is spent annually on sampling and demonstrations 
by U.S. stores—mostly at supermarkets, membership clubs, specialty stores, and department 
stores. They are effective because customers become involved and impulse purchases increase. 
Loitering and costs may be problems.
Referral gifts may encourage existing customers to bring in new ones. Direct marketers, such 
as book and music clubs, often use this tool. It is a technique that has no important shortcomings 
and recognizes the value of friends in influencing purchases.
Matchbooks, pens, calendars, and shopping bags may be given to customers. They differ from 
prizes because they promote retailers’ names. These items should be used as supplements. The 
advantage is longevity. There is no real disadvantage.
Retailers may use special events to generate consumer enthusiasm. Events can range from 
store grand openings to fashion shows. When new McDonald’s stores open, there are typi-
cally giveaways and children’s activities, and there is a guest appearance by Ronald McDon-
ald (a human in a costume). Generally, in choosing a special event, the potential increase 
in consumer awareness and store traffic needs to be weighed against that event’s costs. See  
Figure 19-11.
All sorts of retailers 
participate in online loyalty 
programs; e-Rewards is a 
good example (www 
.e-rewards.com).

PLANNING A RETAIL PROMOTIONAL STRATEGY
A systematic approach to promotional planning is shown in Figure 19-12 and explained next. 
Our blog site (www.bermanevansretail) has posts related to promotional strategy, including word 
of mouth.
Determining Promotional Objectives
A retailer’s broad promotional goals are typically drawn from this list. In developing a promotional 
strategy, the firm must determine which of these are most important:
▶
▶Increase sales.
▶
▶Stimulate impulse and reminder buying.
▶
▶Raise customer traffic.
▶
▶Get leads for sales personnel.
▶
▶Present and reinforce the retailer image.
▶
▶Inform customers about goods and services.
▶
▶Popularize new stores and Web sites.
▶
▶Capitalize on manufacturer support.

▶
▶Enhance customer relations.
▶
▶Maintain customer loyalty.
▶
▶Have consumers pass along positive information to friends and others.
It is vital to state goals as precisely as possible to give direction to the choice of promotional 
types, media, and messages. Increasing sales is not a specific goal. However, increasing sales by 
10 percent is directional, quantitative, and measurable. With that goal, a firm would be able to 
prepare a thorough promotional plan and evaluate its success.
Perhaps the most vital long-term promotion goal for any retailer is to gain positive word of 
mouth (WOM), which occurs when one consumer talks to others—in person, on the phone, by 
E-mail, through social media, or in some other format. If a satisfied customer refers friends to a 
retailer, this can build into a chain of customers. No retailer can succeed if it receives extensive 
negative WOM (such as “The hotel advertised that everything was included in the price. Yet it 
cost me another $50 to play golf”). Negative WOM will cause a firm to lose substantial business.
Both goods- and services-oriented retailers must have positive word of mouth to attract new 
customers and retain existing customers. It has even greater importance given the widespread use 
of social media, where a single negative post or tweet can undo years of careful brand building.14 
For example, many Netflix lapsed members who rejoin the service hear or read word-of-mouth 
messages by existing members. If Netflix does not satisfy existing members, it may not be able 
to attract new members, and the ability to maintain and grow the business will be adversely 
affected.15
Establishing an Overall Promotional Budget
There are five main procedures for setting the size of a retail promotional budget. Retailers should 
weigh the strengths and weaknesses of each technique in relation to their own requirements and 
constraints. To assist firms in their efforts, there is now computer software available.
With the all-you-can-afford method, a retailer first allots funds for each element of the 
retail strategy mix except promotion. The remaining funds go to promotion. This is the weakest 
technique. Its shortcomings are that little emphasis is placed on promotion as a strategic variable; 
expenditures are not linked to goals; and if little or no funds are left over, the promotion budget 
is too small or nonexistent. The method is used predominantly by small, conservative retailers.
The incremental method relies on prior promotion budgets to allocate funds. A percentage is 
either added to or subtracted from one year’s budget to determine the budget for next year. If this 
year’s promotion budget is $100,000, next year’s would be calculated by adjusting that amount. 
A 10 percent rise means that next year’s budget would be $110,000. This technique is useful for 
a small retailer. It provides a reference point. The budget is adjusted based on the firm’s feelings 
about past successes and future trends. It is easy to apply. Yet, the budget is rarely tied to specific 
goals; rather, “gut feelings” are generally used.
With the competitive parity method, a retailer’s promotion budget is raised or lowered 
based on competitors’ actions. If the leading competitor raises its budget, other retailers in the 
area may follow. This method, often employed by both small and large firms, uses a comparison

Thirty-eight percent of Burberry’s sales are to Chinese custom-
ers as compared to 30 percent for its major competitors. As a 
result, winning over Chinese customers is a key part of Burberry’s 
(www.burberry.com) promotional strategy. To build market share 
at a time when the Chinese economy is slowing down, Burberry 
has equipped its stores in China with touchscreens and iPads. 
They display special collections, fashion shows, and Burberry-
produced special events. Burberry also uses WeChat (www 
.wechat.com), a popular Chinese social media site, as an online 
source of information on its luxury goods, such as material on its 
classic collections and new styles, as well as a link to Burberry’s 
Web site. In a recent campaign, WeChat users were eligible to 
win Burberry New Year’s envelopes that were only available for 
in-store pickup.

point and is market-oriented and conservative. It also is imitative, takes for granted that tough-to-
get competitive data are available, and assumes competitors are similar (as to years in business, 
size, customers, location, merchandise, prices, etc.). That last point is critical because competitors 
often need very different promotional budgets.
In the percentage-of-sales method, a retailer ties its promotion budget to revenue. 
A ­promotion-to-sales ratio is developed. Then, during succeeding years, this ratio remains con-
stant. A firm could set promotion costs at 10 percent of sales. If this year’s sales are $600,000, 
there is a $60,000 promotion budget. If next year’s sales are estimated at $720,000, a $72,000 
budget is planned. This process uses sales as a base, is adaptable, and correlates promotion and 
sales. Nonetheless, there is no relation to goals (for an established firm, sales growth may not 
require increased promotion); promotion is not used to lead sales; and promotion drops during 
poor periods, when increases might be helpful. This technique provides excess financing in times 
of high sales and too few funds in periods of low sales.
Under the objective-and-task method, a retailer clearly defines its promotion goals and 
prepares a budget to satisfy them. A goal might be to have 70 percent of the people in its trading 
area know a retailer’s name by the end of a one-month promotion campaign, up from 50 percent. 
To do so, it would determine the tasks and costs required to achieve that goal:
Objective
Task
Cost
1. Gain awareness of 
working women.
Use eight 1/4-page ads in four successive Sunday editions of 
two area papers.
$20,000
2. Gain awareness  
of motorists.
Use twenty 30-second radio ads during prime time on local 
radio stations.
$12,000
3. Gain awareness of 
pedestrians.
Give away 5,000 shopping bags.
$15,000
Total budget
$47,000
The objective-and-task method is the best budgeting technique. Goals are clear, spending 
relates to goal-oriented tasks, and performance can be assessed. However, it can be time consum-
ing and complex to set goals and specific tasks, especially for small retailers.
Selecting the Promotional Mix
After a budget is set, the promotional mix is determined: the retailer’s combination of advertising, 
public relations, personal selling, and sales promotion. A firm with a limited budget may rely on 
store displays, Web site traffic, flyers, targeted direct mail, and publicity to generate customer 
traffic. One with a large budget may rely more on newspaper and TV ads. Retailers often use an 
assortment of forms to reinforce each other. A melding of media ads and point-of-purchse displays 
may be more effective than either form alone. See Figure 19-13.
The promotional mix is affected by the type of retailer involved. In supermarkets, sampling, 
frequent shopper promotions, theme sales, and bonus coupons are among the techniques used 
most. At upscale stores, there is more attention to personal selling and less to advertising and 
sales promotion as compared with discounters. Table 19-3 shows a number of small-retailer 
promotional mixes.
In reacting to a retailer’s communication efforts, consumers often go through a sequence of 
steps known as the, hierarchy of effects, which takes them from awareness, to knowledge, to 
liking, to preference, to conviction, to purchase. Different promotional mixes are needed in each 
step. Ads and public relations are best to develop awareness; personal selling and sales promotion 
are best in changing attitudes and stimulating desires. This is especially true for expensive, com-
plex goods and services. See Figure 19-14.
Implementing the Promotional Mix
The implementation of a promotional mix involves choosing which specific media to use (such as 
Newspaper A and Newspaper B), timing, message content, the makeup of the sales force, specific 
sales promotion tools, and the responsibility for coordination.16
MEDIA DECISIONS  The choice of specific media is based on their overall costs, efficiency (the 
cost to reach the target market), lead time, and editorial content. The retailer’s promotion budget

is important since heavy use of one expensive medium may preclude a balanced promotional mix, 
and a firm may not be able to repeat a message in a costly medium.
A medium’s efficiency relates to the cost of reaching a given number of target customers. 
Media rates are often expressed in terms of cost per 1,000 readers, watchers, or listeners:
Cost per thousand = Cost per message * 1,000
Circulation
A newspaper with a circulation of 400,000 and a one-page advertising rate of $10,000 has a 
­per-page cost per thousand of $25.
In this computation, total circulation is used to measure efficiency. Yet, because a retailer 
usually appeals to a limited target market, only the relevant portion of circulation should be con-
sidered. If 70 percent of readers are target customers for a particular firm (and the other 30 percent 
live outside the trading area), the real cost per thousand is:
 Cost per thousand (target marked) =
Cost per page * 1,000
Circulation * Target market
Circulation
 = $10,000 * 1,000
400,000 * 0.70 = $35.71
Different media require different lead times. A newspaper ad can be placed shortly before 
publication and an online ad can sometimes go “live” almost immediately, whereas a print maga-
zine ad sometimes must be placed months in advance. In addition, the retailer must decide what 
kind of editorial content it wants near ads (such as a sports story or a personal-care column).
Media decisions are not simple. Despite spending billions of dollars on TV and radio com-
mercials, banner ads at search engines, and other media, many Web retailers have found the most 
valuable medium for them is E-mail. It is fast, inexpensive, and targeted. Consider the following 
example.

504	
PART 7  •  COMMUNICATING WITH THE CUSTOMER
To generate greater awareness of Web retailers, costly advertising may be necessary in today’s 
competitive and cluttered landscape. Netflix has a broad mix of marketing and public relations 
programs, including digital and television advertising, affiliates and device partners, and social 
media sites such as Facebook and Twitter to promote its service to potential new members.17
After customers have visited a Web site, the retailer can use explicit opt-in marketing to help 
sustain relationships with the customer. Opt-in marketing involves the customer giving permission 
for the retailer to send marketing materials, which leads to higher receptivity to marketing mes-
sages. Astute marketers collect preference information, so that content and promotional offers in 
an E-mail newsletter are relevant to the customer. This leads to an ongoing, evolving relationship 
between the retailer and the customer.18
TIMING OF THE PROMOTIONAL MIX  Reach refers to the number of distinct people exposed to a 
retailer’s promotion efforts in a specific period. Frequency is the average number of times each 
person reached is exposed to a retailer’s promotion efforts in a specific period. A retailer can 
advertise extensively or intensively. Extensive media coverage often means ads reach many people 
but with relatively low frequency. Intensive media coverage generally means ads are placed in 
selected media and repeated frequently. Repetition is important, particularly for a retailer seeking 
to develop an image or sell new goods or services.
Decisions are needed about how to address peak selling seasons and whether to mass or distrib-
ute efforts. In peak seasons, all elements of the promotional mix are usually utilized; in slow peri-
ods, promotional efforts are often reduced. A massed promotion effort is used by retailers, such  
as toy retailers, that promote seasonally. A distributed promotion effort is used by retailers, 
such as fast-food restaurants, that promote throughout the year. Although they are not affected by 
seasonality in the same way as other retailers, massed advertising is practiced by supermarkets; 
many use Wednesday or Thursday for weekly newspaper ads. This takes advantage of the fact that 
a high proportion of consumers make their major shopping trip on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.
Sales force size can vary by time (morning versus evening), day (weekdays versus weekends), 
and month (December versus January). Sales promotions also vary in their timing. Store openings 
and holidays are especially good times for sales promotions (and public relations).
CONTENT OF MESSAGES  Whether written or spoken, personally or impersonally delivered, mes-
sage content is important. Advertising themes, wording, headlines, use of color, size, layout, and 
placement must be selected. Publicity releases must be written. In personal selling, the greeting, 
sales presentation, demonstration, and closing need to be applied. With sales promotion, the firm’s 
message must be composed and placed on the promotional device.
To a large extent, the characteristics of the promotional form influence the message. A shop-
ping bag often contains no more than a retailer’s name, and a billboard (seen at 55 miles per hour) 
is good for visual effect but can hold only limited information. Yet, a salesperson may be able to 
hold a customer’s attention for a while. A number of shopping centers use a glossy magazine—in 
print and online—to communicate a community-oriented image, introduce new stores to consum-
ers, and promote the goods and services carried at stores in the center. Cluttered ads displaying 
many products suggest a discounter’s orientation, whereas fine pencil drawings and selective 
product displays suggest a specialty store focus.

There are many advantages to the use of mobile coupons as 
compared to the traditional paper format. Mobile coupons 
do not have to be cut, organized, and searched for while in a 
store. They can be redeemed by displaying the coupons on a 
customer’s smartphone. Retailers can use mobile couponing in 
conjunction with geo-fencing applications, whereby the retailers 
can offer select coupon offers to customers within a given dis-
tance of a store. The redemption rate for mobile coupons can be 
as much as 10 percent or more. Effective mobile coupons should 
be capable of being redeemed without printing. They also should 
be based on a customer’s purchase history. A retailer can offer 
special coupons to lapsed customers, brand-loyal customers, or 
customers with special purchase histories (such as those that 
favor organics, prepared foods, local produce).

CHAPTER 19   •  Promotional Strategy	
505	
Some retailers use comparative advertising to contrast their offerings with those of their com-
petitors. These ads help position a retailer relative to competitors, increase awareness of the firm, 
maximize the efficiency of a limited budget, and offer credibility. Yet, they provide visibility for 
competitors, may confuse people, and may lead to legal action. Fast-food and off-price retailers 
are among those using comparative ads.
MAKEUP OF SALES FORCE  Qualifications of sales personnel must be detailed, and these personnel 
must be recruited, selected, trained, compensated, supervised, and monitored. Personnel should 
also be classified as order takers or order getters and assigned to the appropriate departments.
SALES PROMOTION TOOLS  Specific sales promotion tools must be chosen from among those 
that were cited in Figure 19-9. The combination of tools depends on short-term goals and the 
other aspects of the promotion mix. If possible, cooperative ventures should be sought. Tools 
inconsistent with the firm’s image should never be used; and retailers should recognize the types 
of promotions that customers really want.
RESPONSIBILITY FOR COORDINATION  Regardless of the retailer’s size or format, someone must 
be responsible for the promotion function. Larger retailers often assign this job to a vice-president 
who oversees display personnel, works with the firm’s ad agency, supervises the firm’s advertis-
ing department (if there is one), and supplies branch outlets with POP materials. In a large retail 
store, personal selling is usually under the jurisdiction of the store manager. For a promotional 
strategy to succeed, its components have to be coordinated with other retail mix elements. Sales 
personnel must be informed of special sales and know product attributes; featured items must be 
received, marked, and displayed; and accounting entries must be made. Often, a shopping center or 
a shopping district runs theme promotions, such as “Back to School.” In those instances, someone 
must coordinate the activities of all participating retailers.
Reviewing and Revising the Promotional Plan
An analysis of the success of a promotional plan depends on its objectives. Revisions should be 
made if pre-set goals are not achieved. Here are some ways to test the effectiveness of a promo-
tional effort:
Examples of Retail Promotion Goals
Approaches for Evaluating Promotion 
Effectiveness
Inform current customers about new credit plans; 
acquaint potential customers with new offerings.
Study company and product awareness before and 
after promotion; evaluate size of audience.
Develop and reinforce a particular image; maintain 
customer loyalty.
Study image through surveys before and after pub-
lic relations and other promotion efforts.
Increase customer traffic; get leads for salespeo-
ple; increase revenues above last year’s; reduce 
customer returns from prior years.
Evaluate sales performance and the number of 
inquiries; study customer intentions to buy 
before and after promotion; study customer 
trading areas and average purchases; review 
coupon redemption.
Although it may at times be tough to assess promotion efforts (e.g., increased revenues might 
be due to several factors, not just promotion), it is crucial for retailers to systematically study and 
adapt their promotional mixes. Walmart provides suppliers with store-by-store data and sets up-
front goals for cooperative promotion programs. Actual sales are then compared against the goals. 
Lowe’s, the home center chain, applies computerized testing to review thousands of different ideas 
affecting the design of circulars and media mix options. In a suburb of Minneapolis, Supervalu 
runs a “lab store,” a model store not open to the public where the company can test how new 
products look on its shelves and experiment with seasonal displays. Retailers such as Kohl’s are 
testing the effectiveness of newspaper circulars versus digital flyers on in-store sales and 
profitability.19

PART 7  •  COMMUNICATING WITH THE CUSTOMER
1.	 To explore the scope of retail promotion. Retail promo-
tion is any communication by a retailer that informs, 
persuades, and/or reminds the target market about any 
aspect of the retailer through ads, public relations, per-
sonal selling, and sales promotion.
2.	 To study the elements of retail promotion: advertising, 
public relations, personal selling, and sales promotion. 
Advertising involves paid, nonpersonal communication. 
It has a large audience, low costs per person, many alter-
native media, and other factors. It also involves message 
inflexibility, high absolute costs, and a wasted portion 
of the audience. Key advertising media are papers, TV, 
the Web, phone directories, direct mail, radio, transit, 
outdoor, magazines, and flyers/circulars. Especially use-
ful are cooperative ads, in which a retailer shares costs 
and messages with manufacturers, wholesalers, or other 
retailers.
Public relations includes all communications foster-
ing a favorable image. It may be nonpersonal or per-
sonal, paid or nonpaid, and sponsor controlled or not 
controlled. Publicity is the nonpersonal, nonpaid form 
of public relations. Public relations creates awareness, 
enhances the image, involves credible sources, and has 
no message costs. It also has little control over messages, 
is short term, and can entail nonmedia costs. Publicity 
can be expected or unexpected and positive or negative.
Personal selling uses oral communication with one 
or more potential customers and is critical for persua-
sion and in closing sales. It is adaptable, flexible, and 
provides immediate feedback. The audience is small, 
per-customer costs are high, and shoppers are not lured 
into the store. Order-taking and/or order-getting sales-
people can be employed. Functions include greeting the 
customer, determining wants, showing merchandise, 
making a sales presentation, demonstrating products, 
answering objections, and closing the sale.
Sales promotion comprises paid communication 
activities other than advertising, public relations, and 
personal selling. It may be eye-catching, unique, and 
valuable to the customer. It also may be hard to end, neg-
atively affect image, and rely on frivolous points. Tools 
include point-of-purchase displays, contests and sweep-
stakes, coupons, frequent shopper programs, prizes, 
samples, demonstrations, referral gifts, matchbooks, 
pens, calendars, shopping bags, and special events.
3.	 To discuss the strategic aspects of retail promotion: 
objectives, budgeting, the mix of forms, implementing 
the mix, and reviewing and revising the plan. There are 
five steps in a promotion strategy: (a) Goals are stated 
in specific measurable terms. Positive word of mouth is 
an important long-term goal. (b) An overall promotion 
budget is set on the basis of one of these methods: all you 
can afford, incremental, competitive parity, percentage 
of sales, and objective and task. (c) The promotional mix 
is outlined, based on the budget, the type of retailing, the 
coverage of the media, and the hierarchy of effects. (d) 
The promotional mix is enacted. Included are decisions 
involving specific media, promotional timing, message 
content, sales force composition, sales promotion tools, 
and the responsibility for coordination. (e) The retailer 
systematically reviews and adjusts the promotional plan, 
consistent with pre-set goals.

Short Cases
Case 1: Keep It Simple*
“In this omnichannel shopping era, it is more important than 
ever to deliver a simplified shopping experience. Retail brands 
that can deliver the most streamlined experience will drive the 
highest levels of long-term customer loyalty.”
That was the message in branding firm Siegel and Gale’s sixth 
annual Global Brand Simplicity Index, based on responses from 
12,000+ adults across eight countries. The survey asked consum-
ers to rank leading retail brands based on how simple they are, 
why disrupters are gaining ground, and the benefits of simplifying 
customer experiences. “Brands delivering value through stream-
lined customer experiences are learning that simplicity pays off,” 
says Brian Rafferty, global director of insights at Siegel and Gale.
This could be a turning point for companies that have his-
torically struggled with how to connect with the omnichannel 
shopper. By definition, the omnichannel retailing model enables 
shoppers to seamlessly hop across a brand’s physical and digi-
tal touchpoints and procure merchandise just as easily. It has 
also conditioned shoppers to expect to shop across a “brand,” 
rather than individual “channels.” Retailers must adopt and inte-
grate multiple customer touchpoints—whether via Web-based 
kiosks, smartphones, tablets, or mobile apps—to ensure real-
time engagement with customers during their path to purchase.
Merchants must ensure that ordered merchandise can be 
shipped to shoppers’ homes or their desired store for pick-
up. This calls for new fulfillment options designed to make it 
simple to receive orders. “The pace of technology is changing 
in terms of customer expectations, but retailers must keep up 
and seamlessly coordinate channels and operations,” Rafferty 
says. “Retailers need to personalize shopping experiences, and 
give shoppers exactly what they want, when they want it. This 
experience needs to be invisible to the customer. They are not 
interested in processes—they just want a top-notch experience.”
Only a handful of retailers are making strides in customers’ 
eyes— especially in the United States. Grocery chain Publix is 
one of them: Jumping 20 spots in one year and landing third 
on the U.S. simplicity list, Publix touts an “easily navigated 
layout and pays close attention to the customer experience,” 
the study reported.
Publix aside, unconventional sources are outpacing cus-
tomary ones in this area. Shoppers ranked Google as the top 
U.S. retailer choice due to its providing instant information 
when making purchase decisions. Netflix was second, and 
Amazon.com and Zappos.com were fourth and sixth, based on 
free shipping.
For firms on the fence about the power of the simplified, 
informational shopping experience, consider this: 63 percent of 
people are willing to pay more for simpler experiences, and 69 
percent are more apt to recommend a brand because it provides 
simpler experiences and communications, according to the report.
Already inundated with information from conventional 
sources such as point-of-sale stations, the omnichannel busi-
ness model is producing unprecedented levels of unstructured 
data from Web sites, social media, and electronic customer 
touchpoints, including kiosks and mobile devices. That “big 
data” contain intricate nuggets like customer preferences and 
merchandise consumption patterns.
There is no better place for retail brands to find customer-
specific information than in their own loyalty program data-
bases. Understanding what Dunkin’ Donuts shoppers want 
makes it easier for the marketing team to “focus on fewer bigger 
things,” John Costello, CMO of Dunkin’ Brands, says. “We get 
people to focus on the three to five things in their area that make 
a difference,” he said. “Find out what makes a difference, and 
eliminate the little things that create clutter.” Keeping a keen 
eye on these ever-changing factors has helped Dunkin’ Donuts 
claim the seventh spot in the U.S. Simplicity Index.
Questions
1.	 From a retailer perspective, how would you exhibit “sim-
plicity” in an omnichannel world?
2.	 From a consumer perspective, what does “simplicity” mean 
to you? Is it important? Explain your answer.
3.	 Should every kind of retailer—small, large; discount, 
upscale; and so on—strive to be “simplistic”? Why or why 
not?
4.	 Based on this case, what lessons would you recommend for 
your college bookstore?
Case 2: More than Price*
A study released in 2016 by Deloitte, the Food Marketing Insti-
tute, and the Grocery Manufacturers Association shows that 
more than half of Americans surveyed weigh “evolving driv-
ers” in their purchasing decisions—health and wellness, safety, 
social impact experience, and transparency—in addition to the 
traditional drivers of taste, price, and convenience.
“Price is always going to be important; so is quality. But 
what we’re seeing here is a shift from value to values,” says 
Tom Compernolle, principal in the retail practice at Deloitte 
Consulting. “Some chains have hired registered dietitians to 
provide food and nutrition information. Others have showed 
innovation in their organic private-label programs. Even dollar 
stores and other small-store formats use signage to drive home 
environmental and health and wellness messaging.”
Jack Ringquist, global leader of consumer products at 
Deloitte, says today’s supermarket shoppers behave differently 
than even 3 years ago—and their preferences are becoming 
more fragmented than the food industry may have anticipated. 
“At one time health and wellness might have been considered 
outlying values,” he says, but “that’s no longer true. Technology 
has made information so pervasive that shoppers are making 
more informed choices about the foods they eat.”
Viewpoints differ when the conversation turns to Millen-
nials, and the changes this cohort are likely to spur in the chan-
nel. Still, whether folks argue that they’ll abandon traditional 
supermarkets or drag them kicking and screaming into the next

PART 7  •  SHORT CASES

decade, there remain a few truisms. Millennials do not have a 
reputation for loading up their pantry; they’re more inclined to 
think about what they’re going to eat when they get hungry. The 
idea of three traditional meals a day doesn’t mesh with their 
lifestyle; sometimes a protein bar is just right for breakfast, and 
on other days it’s perfect for dinner.
“Millennials don’t bring a lot of preconceived notions 
about foods and meals to the table,” says Phil Lempert, food 
industry analyst. “They like the idea of buying meats at a 
butcher shop. They are passionate about food but short on time, 
so home delivery and meal kits suit them fine. They’re changing 
the dynamics of food retailing because they’re not encumbered 
by all the reasons why they can’t” do things differently.
“The reinvention happening in this space is being driven 
by the consumer[s]. They’ve pushed the traditional supermarket 
operators to ask themselves, ‘How can I be iconic and differ-
ent?”’ says Farla Efros, president of HRC Advisory, Hilco’s 
global retail advisory practice. “Consumers are … time-starved, 
they like online ordering, they prefer to pick [food] up at the 
store on the way home from wherever. It’s up to the traditional 
supermarkets to figure out how to make that happen.”
Prosper Insight and Analytics’ consumer research consis-
tently shows that customers choose to shop at certain super-
markets based on a handful of qualities: In order of importance, 
they are price, location, selection, quality, and fresh produce. 
Price is cited by 73 percent of shoppers, location by 70 per-
cent. “Keep in mind that while new concepts and formats are 
springing up, nearly 20 percent of shoppers make Walmart their 
top choice for groceries—and price is the main driver,” says 
Phil Rist, principal and executive vice-president of strategy at 
Prosper. “At other stores, loyalty cards, fuel/gas rewards, and 
coupons could be significant drivers. The takeaway is really the 
need for marketers to understand what’s important to their cus-
tomers—and what’s not—and to use that to carve their niche.”
Because price is important to many shoppers, value super-
markets such as Aldi can expect growth rates 55 percent higher 
than for premium chains and 228 percent higher than main-
stream supermarkets.

Case 3: Enhancing the In-Store Experience 
through Facial Recognition Software*
The best way to understand what eyeQ is trying to do is to com-
pare it to a conventional digital display. Unless it’s a specialized 
store, that display can’t show shoppers a significant portion of 
* Based on material in Peter Johnston, “Eye Know You!” STORES Maga-
zine, December 2015, pp. 58–60. Reprinted by permission. Copyright

a store’s assortment, so it might instead show a variety: lots of 
fast fades and dissolves, and maybe some panning video of the 
aisles or the escalators. The idea is to keep it moving, so if a 
shopper stands there long enough he or she will see something 
of interest
The digital sign in eyeQ’s system is connected to a cam-
era, a lot of proprietary facial recognition software, and—via 
IBM’s cloud service—Watson. When a shopper stops to look 
at an eyeQ digital sign, the sign looks back at him or her. Then, 
based on facial features and appearance, eyeQ tailors its con-
tent to the viewer’s age and gender. Men between the ages 
of 35 and 45 might see suits, top-end cameras, or fly fishing 
rods; women between the ages of 18 and 30 might see jewelry 
or clothes.
“When somebody approaches the screen,” says Doug 
Bain, the chief revenue officer of eyeQ Insights, “the screen 
is already aware of the baseline information—the age and 
gender of the person—and is ready to make product recom-
mendations.” There’s more, though: If the shopper gives the 
system his or her Twitter user name, Watson can capture the 
most recent 200 tweets, run them through its natural language 
processing capabilities, and slot him or her into one of a selec-
tion of basic personality types. Not only can the system change 
the products being recommended but it can also change the 
whole experience—background colors, video, music, whatever 
it’s got.
The most recent version of eyeQ’s system can even register 
emotion. “It’s categorizing the person’s expression as happy, 
sad, angry, surprised—and to what degree,” says Bain. “Is 
the expression changing dramatically when he or she gets to 
a certain point in the video, or a certain page, or when he or 
she touches the screen? It’s another data point to determine the 
effectiveness of the content.”
As it develops, eyeQ has been working closely with retail 
marketing agency TPN. Manolo Almagro, TPN’s senior man-
aging director for digital and retail technologies, notes that the 
system, even without a consumer opting in or providing her or 
his own information, can identify a repeat visitor by the unique 
media access control address her or his mobile device sends out 
to find available Wi-Fi. “We don’t know the individual’s name,” 
he says, “but we know it’s the same 40-year-old woman who 
was in on Tuesday.”
Almagro adds that further development of the tech-
nology requires some care. “I know you’re interested in a 
certain type of product, I know your age and gender, and I 
know your personality type. This is a level of depth we’ve 
never had before, and we have to ask ourselves, ‘How much 
personalization is too much?’ I want to give enough to make 
the experience more convenient for you, but not so much 
that it becomes creepy. That’s a kind of fine line we have 
to walk.”
At the moment, one retailer has a prototype in place, 
and several consumer package goods companies are experi-
menting with prototypes in the retail space. Shortly, eyeQ 
expects to have a prototype implementation robust enough to 
start to generate some real feedback. Bain says early signs are 
encouraging. “We have data that demonstrate that increased 
engagement with the system does indeed mean increased 
sales.”

4.	 Comment on the privacy issues involved with eyeQ.
Case 4: Revitalizing Customer Loyalty*
There are many ways to maintain customer loyalty, but experts 
say consistent and clear pricing may be the most important. 
Moreover, getting the price right across all products all the time 
is a key ingredient in strengthening shopper loyalty. The trick is 
to do so profitably. “Today’s retailers have a unique opportunity 
to leverage price management and optimization tools to make the 
most profitable decisions,” explains Cindy Kim, vice-president 
of global marketing for Revionics, a Texas-based provider of 
price optimization solutions. “But the advantage is being able to 
tap into the vast amounts of market, competitive, and customer 
data to effectively manage and execute those pricing decisions 
without killing their margins.”
According to Kim, intelligent data can provide a lot of 
value in terms of the types of assortments by stores, demand, 
sensitivity to price, and shopper purchasing behavior and pref-
erences, as well as understanding how competitors are pricing, 
which can affect the shopper at the product level.
Jim Sills, president and CEO of software and services pro-
vider Clear Demand, agrees, adding that customer loyalty is 
driven by price and experience. “It’s a service equation that has 
to be informed by using pricing intelligence, which ensures an 
interconnected and consistent shopping experience. You must 
have rational line structures automated with a rules engine, 
which ensures products are priced rationally—that is, not in a 
way that forces shoppers to trade down because the gap between 
brands is too large. If loyalty really matters to a retailer, consis-
tent, rational pricing strategies must be maintained.”
Also necessary is a better understanding of shopper behav-
ior than that of the competition, asserts Guru Hariharan, CEO 
of Boomerang Commerce, which advises retailers on how to 
make smart pricing decisions to boost profits. What’s more, 
retailers need recommendations based on knowing where to 
hold prices, even when a rival drops its prices. “It’s vital—the 
balance of knowing what price differential your customer will 
allow before making a decision that takes them elsewhere. If a

alty,” Progressive Grocer, February 2016, pp. 114–116. Reprinted by

competitor changes prices at lunchtime, you know the recom-
mendation and act on it—not just for individual products, but 
across interrelated products.”
Todd Michaud, vice-president of NCR global enterprise, 
merchandising, and supply chain solutions, focuses on the link 
between pricing and the ability of retailers to give customers 
personalized offers based on shopping history and preferences, 
which he believes is key to effective loyalty programs. He says 
firms must understand, interpret, and act on shopping data to 
offer the right price or promotion to drive behavior.
Michaud adds that price management systems also must 
integrate into loyalty systems to consume special pricing and 
offers, managing the related complexities, to ensure proper price 
execution. Increasingly important in an omnichannel world is 
“that a customer’s purchase history considers purchases across 
all channels, not just online or in store,” he states.
Experts point to shoppers’ desire for value as another 
link between pricing and customer loyalty. This is important 
regardless of the price sensitivity of various customer seg-
ments. “All customers are cognizant of value,” explains Alan 
Lipson, global retail marketing manager at SAS, a provider 
of business analytics software and services. “Pricing plays a 
role in communicating a firm’s value proposition. It is vital 
to understand which products need to be priced appropriately 
to communicate their value to customer segments. Customers 
will not be loyal to a firm that does not provide value, however 
value is defined.”
Mark Kelso, president of consultancy Price Revolution, 
says, “Price management is the glue that merges each compo-
nent of the retail mix—product assortment, promotion, and the 
merchandising message—into one cohesive offering, improving 
the overall value as perceived by the retailer’s customers.”

Comprehensive Case
Inside the Mind of Shake Shack’s Founder*
Introduction
Danny Meyer is an extremely creative and proactive business 
thinker and entrepreneur. He has demonstrated this throughout 
his career—especially with the introduction and expansion of 
the growing Shake Shack chain. Shake Shack serves a menu 
of premium burgers, hot dogs, crinkle-cut fries, shakes, frozen 
custard, beer, and wine. With its fresh and simple, high-quality 
food, Shake Shack is a fun and lively gathering place with wide-
spread appeal.
Meyer’s Basic Philosophy
“People want the highest quality food, but they don’t want the 
fancy experience anymore,” said Danny Meyer, the chief execu-
tive officer (CEO) of Union Square Hospitality Group and the 
founder of Shake Shack. According to Meyer, some diners are 
saying, “We like our food better when it’s at a hole in the wall.”
Union Square Hospitality Group’s restaurant portfolio 
runs the gamut from such tony New York City eateries as the 
Gramercy Tavern and The Modern at the Museum of Modern 
Art (MoMA), to the classy-casual barbecue joint Blue Smoke, 
to the fast-growing Shake Shack, which started as a hot dog 
stand in New York City’s Madison Square Park and had grown 
to more than 90 locations worldwide by mid-2016. According 
to Shake Shack’s Web site (www.shakeshack.com), at that time, 
it had outlets in 15 states and the District of Columbia, as well 
as in four foreign countries and the Middle East.
Danny Meyer was a special guest at the 2016 Convenience 
Store News Foodservice Summit, held March 15–16, 2016, in 
partnership with Tyson Convenience, where he participated in 
an interactive roundtable discussion with about a dozen other 
leading foodservice executives.
The trailblazing restaurateur noted that in his many travels 
around the world, the best croissant he’s ever tasted was at a 
gas station in Uruguay. “People like to be surprised by high/low 
experiences like that. It’s a wonderful trend for you all,” he said, 
gesturing to the convenience foodservice retail executives and 
chefs gathered around the table.
Meyer, whose restaurants and chefs have earned an unprec-
edented 25 James Beard Awards, had breakfast with the con-
venience store (c-store) retailers after they spent the previous 
day visiting unique food concepts throughout the Big Apple 
on CSNews’ Taste of Manhattan Tour, which included a stop 
at Meyer’s Shake Shack outlet, his uber-successful hamburger 
chain. “We started Shake Shack as a hot dog cart in Madison 
Square Park in 2000,” Meyer recounted, relating how the cre-
ation of the fast-casual chain was “a great experiment in com-
bining capitalism with philanthropy.”
Meyer, then spearheading the rehabilitation of Madison 
Square Park, which had fallen into great disrepair, was asked 
to supervise the operation of a hot dog cart inside an art exhibit 
that was part of the park’s renewal effort. Already operating 
several upscale restaurants near the park and elsewhere in New 
York City, Meyer decided to use the hot dog stand to examine 
“the meaning of hospitality and what that means outside of a 
fancy restaurant.”
Selling Chicago-style hot dogs (hot dogs topped with yel-
low mustard, chopped onions, pickle relish, a dill pickle spear, 
tomato slices, pickled peppers, and celery salt.), the single food 
stand became extremely successful, drawing lines that num-
bered more than 100 people at a time. Four years later, the city 
asked Meyer to operate a permanent 20-foot by 20-foot kiosk 
in Madison Square Park. Interestingly, that original Shake 
Shack kiosk focused on milkshakes, not on the hamburgers. “I 
had no idea it would become so famous for its burgers,” said 
Meyer. “Every year, we had to renovate the kitchens to increase 
space for burgers.” In addition to burgers, the restaurant’s menu 
included its eponymous milkshakes and French fries, and even 
a ‘Shroom Burger. Since the beginning, Meyer has wanted 
“everything at Shake Shack to be ‘craveable’.”
He eventually donated the original building, which cost $1 
million to build, to the park and continues to operate the Shake 
Shack unit as a tenant. The Madison Square Park location’s sales 
continue to grow today. During the summertime, the line typi-
cally reaches to outside the park and the wait time for service 
can be an hour or more. A Web cam on the Shack’s homepage 
shows the length of the current line in real time for that location.
Unlike more aggressive entrepreneurs, Danny Meyer 
waited 5 years before opening a second Shake Shack, this time 
on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. “Shake Shack is the first 
time we did anything for the second time,” commented Meyer, 
whose other restaurants are mainly single-unit locations.
Although he eventually expanded Shake Shack to addi-
tional locations in New York, as well as in Connecticut, 
Washington, D.C., Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massa-
chusetts, New Jersey, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Texas, Meyer 
felt that it was important to make every location unique. “We’re 
proud to be a chain, but who wrote the rule that every link in the 
chain has to be the same?” he asked.
Twenty percent of the menu at every Shake Shack unit is 
localized; and none of the units look the same, he noted, point-
ing to the seats at the New Haven, Connecticut, Shake Shack 
that look like the seats at the city’s historic Yale Bowl football 
stadium. Each Shake Shack unit also carries a wide selection of 
craft beers local to that particular area.
At the 2016 CSNews Foodservice Summit, Meyer had just 
returned from the grand opening of the first California Shake 
Shack in West Hollywood in Los Angeles. With international 
partners, Shake Shack also operates in such locales as Tokyo, 
London, Istanbul, Moscow, Beirut, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha, 
Kuwait City, Riyadh, and Jeddah.
Chick’n Shack Hatched
As Shake Shack has expanded, so too has its menu, leading to 
the recent introduction of the restaurant’s first chicken sand-
wich, the Chick’n Shack—a skinless, marinated chicken breast 
that arrives vacuum-packed to the store and is then freshly bat-
tered and fried, and served with bib lettuce, pickles, and a but-
termilk herb mayo.

PART 7  •  COMMUNICATING WITH THE CUSTOMER
The Chick’n Shack has been an immediate hit. “In Los 
Angeles, we had our busiest opening day in our history,” said 
Meyer, “and the chicken sandwich sold at 80 percent of the 
beef burger.”
At the Foodservice Summit, Meyer asked the c-store 
retailers to share what they saw and experienced during the 
Taste of Manhattan tour. He agreed with them that the eateries 
on the tour illustrated many of the key trends in the foodser-
vice sector, such as the popularity of local, fresh ingredients; 
the importance of being authentic; and the opportunity to 
“make food be theater.” Several of the retailer attendees told 
Meyer they were impressed with the upbeat spirit shown by 
the young people working at many of the restaurants featured 
on the tour.
“Even though we call it ‘work,’ hospitality is a team sport,” 
remarked Meyer, whose first business book, Setting the Table 
(Harper Collins, 2006), was a New York Times bestseller. It 
examines the power of warm and sincere hospitality in restau-
rants, business, and life. “If you think about what sports has in 
common with hospitality, you notice that ballplayers don’t say 
they’re going to work today. They say they’re going to play to 
win. That’s all part of our approach to servant leadership. It’s 
the belief that the power flows from the bottom up, not the top 
down,” he said.
“Lately, we’ve been challenging our teams to think about 
what it would be like if we had no prices for the food on the 
menu and the guest gets a check for how much they enjoyed the 
entire experience,” Meyer continued. “That’s not to diminish 
the importance of food innovation, but if we take food out of 
the equation, how did we make the guest feel?”
Hospitality Included
Meyer made headlines in 2015 with the institution of a “no-
tipping” policy at his restaurant The Modern at New York’s 
MoMA; and he planned to expand the policy to all his eateries 
by the end of 2016. A number of observations and personal 
experiences over the past 20 years led Meyer to launch the 
paradigm-changing policy on November 15, 2015.
[Authors’ note: In the following paragraphs, Meyer’s no 
tipping plan is discussed in detail to highlight the many issues 
involved. However, after just a short time, in 2016, Meyer 
backed off the no-tipping policy due to customer and employee 
dissatisfaction. It turned out that many customers wanted to 
provide tips to ensure the best possible dining service; and the 
waitstaff wanted to earn the tips for giving customers their out-
standing service.]
“I travel around the world to learn about food, and the 
U.S. culture of tipping is unusual,” Meyer relayed to the group. 
“There’s no tipping in Asia, and much less in Europe. Tipping 
came about in the U.S. because we wanted to be more like 
Europe—150 years ago, when really rich people tipped the 
help. It was a power thing.”
A couple of years ago, the adjusted minimum wage for 
tipped employees in New York City became $7.50 per hour. The 
National Restaurant Association intends to make sure no leg-
islation changes that. Meyer, by the way, paid his waitstaff $9 
per hour at that time, $1.50 above the city minimum. [Authors’ 
note: Today, there are ongoing legislative battles throughout 
the country about what the minimum wage hourly rate should 
be in the future.]
“It’s troubled me for the past 20 years. And now, the last 
2 years, we are in the midst of the greatest labor crisis in New 
York City history,” he said. “The disparity between the wages 
of tipped employees and non-tipped employees is huge. The 
average tip in New York City is about 21 percent, which is great 
for tipped employees, but we can’t find enough skilled cooks 
to staff our kitchens.”
Meyer reached his own personal tipping point, so to speak, 
when he found out that he had more Culinary Institute of Amer-
ica–trained chefs working for him as servers than working in his 
kitchens because they couldn’t make enough money as cooks. 
“Because of that, and the fact that I never liked the master/ser-
vant relationship that tipping implies, I decided that someone 
has to take a stand and do something about it,” he said.
So, Meyer enacted the following steps at The Modern, and 
shortly thereafter at Maialino, a Roman trattoria at the Meyer-
owned Gramercy Park Hotel:
▶
▶He gave all cooks a $2-per-hour raise and built a career 
ladder for them.
▶
▶Menu prices were adjusted upward by about 20 percent 
and the policy was branded as “Hospitality Included.” 
Guest receipts no longer had a tipping line.
▶
▶He announced the restaurant would share 13.5 percent of 
its top-line revenues with all employees—tipped and non-
tipped workers.
▶
▶He unfurled the most comprehensive communications pro-
gram in company history, getting input and feedback from 
all employees, holding town hall meetings, and conduct-
ing one-on-ones with affected employees. He shared with 
the employees what they would have made under the old 
tipping system and what they were making under the new 
no-tipping policy.
The bottom line: Cooks were happier with the wage 
increase and tipped employees were “kept whole,” according 
to Meyer. Guests pay about the same. [Authors’ note: Again, 
many customers and tipped employees were not at all happy 
with the new plan.]
After Meyer introduced “Hospitality Included” at The 
Modern, at least eight other top chefs and restaurants in New 
York City have followed suit with similar no-tipping policies. 
[Authors’ note: The number of restaurants switching to a no-
tipping policy has been quite small.] Nonetheless, one expert 
who has been a no-tipping critic, points out some downsides 
in Figure 1.
World-Class Service
Even before the no-tipping experiment, Union Square Hospital-
ity Group was renowned for its world-class customer service. 
The c-store retailers who participated in the 2016 roundtable 
were interested in learning how Meyer’s restaurants are able 
to achieve such a superior level of service from the employ-
ees, and, perhaps more importantly, how practical is it to think 
convenience stores could achieve a superior level of customer 
service with many of its employees making minimum wage or 
just slightly higher?
In response, Meyer shared his hiring philosophy, which 
is to hire people based on their emotional skills, or by having 
what he calls a high “hospitality quotient.” “We don’t view 
high labor costs as something happening to us,” he said. “It’s

Counterpoint

Store News (c) 2016  
(www.csnews.com)
One restaurant critic who originally supported a “service included” policy is now having 
second thoughts. The New York Post’s Steve Cuozzo, a food writer who has long called for 
the end of tipping, acknowledges that it’s far too early to judge results, but he has some 
concerns.
“Owners say customers will pay the same amount as before because slightly higher prices 
to reimburse staﬀ will work out to the same amount as tips,” Cuozzo wrote recently. 
“But not so fast. Diners will surely pay more because tax will now be based on the higher 
amount.”
Cuozzo also points out potential legal issues related to transparency for those restaurants 
who pledge to share revenues with employees, in lieu of tips.
And he even sees problems for restaurant owners whose lease arrangements require 
them to pay rent based on an agreed-upon percentage of revenue over a certain point.
“None of this means we should give up on getting rid of tipping,” concluded Cuozzo. “It’s 
a rotten practice of which Americans are irrationally fond. But every restaurant should 
take a long, hard look before they dive into a pool that might not have a bottom.”

The Hospitality 
Quotient

Store News (c) 2016  
(www.csnews.com)
When interviewing potential new hires, 
managers at all of Danny Meyer’s restaurants 
are trained to look for six “emotional skills.” 
These skills, according to Meyer, add up to
what he calls having a high “hospitality 
quotient.” The six skills are:
Kindness & Optimism
Curiosity
Work Ethic
Empathy
Self-Awareness
Integrity
something we are choosing to do. We feel that it actually drives 
higher sales volume.” Managers at Meyer’s restaurants are 
trained to look for six “emotional skills” when interviewing 
potential new hires. These skills (see Figure 2), with Meyer’s 
commentary, are:
▶
▶Kindness & Optimism: “Skeptics don’t tend to thrive in the 
hospitality business.”
▶
▶Curiosity: “Every day is an opportunity to learn something 
new.”
▶
▶Work Ethic: “I can’t teach you to care about doing things 
right.”
▶
▶Empathy: “What kind of wake do you leave in your path 
as you go through life?”
▶
▶Self-Awareness: “Do you know your own personal weather 
report?”
▶
▶Integrity: “The judgement to do the right thing even if it’s 
not in your self-interest.”
In addition, Meyer offered some final words of wis-
dom and encouragement to the foodservice executives. “The 
smartphone has given people so many choices today. With 
just the touch of their phone, they can communicate, get car 
service, get directions, and order food,” he said. “About the 
only thing it doesn’t do is cook food for you or fill your tank 
with gas.”
The restaurateur acknowledged what he calls “captive 
dining” is a thing of the past. “There are a huge number of 
places to eat. … Today, if I’m eating excellent food in every 
other channel of my life, why wouldn’t I want that quality at 
every place I eat?” He recalled one of his first experiences with 
restaurant-quality food at a convenience store. “I was travel-
ing to Penn State University and had read that Sheetz actually 
cared about the food experience. It didn’t disappoint. Clearly, 
Sheetz didn’t view food as a captive audience experience.”
To the group of c-store retailers, Meyer said, “I’ve prob-
ably done business with most of your companies before just 
traveling around the country, and I really admire what you are 
doing and how your industry is changing, and all of our indus-
tries are changing. There’s more and more interest in food and 
how you make your place so much more than what it once was. 
I think it is a fascinating thing to grapple with.” Based on what 
he’s seen of convenience stores’ improved foodservice around 
the country, he concluded, “You guys are on the right track with 
foodservice, and people are not going to go back to accepting 
lower-quality food at a gas station.”

One of the greatest challenges that retailers face with social media relates to negative 
customer postings. Such postings can rapidly spread, whether true or not, and they can 
have an impact on a retailer’s image and performance. So, both the ramifications of negative 
customer posts and the proper strategy to handle them must be understood.
Research compiled by the American Customer Satisfaction Index (www.theacsi.org) (ACSI), 
found that the year 2015 was characterized by lower customer satisfaction across the board. 
Of the 43 industries tracked by ACSI, 5 improved, 30 declined, and 8 were unchanged. 
According to Claes Fornell, founder of ACSI, “There are exceptions, but the overall trend of 
deteriorating customer satisfaction encompasses nearly every industry and is holding consumer 
spending in check, forcing retailers into steeper or more extended discounts.”

Three of the five industries that improved were Web-based. Social media and online travel 
services also saw improvement in user satisfaction last year. The online travel service industry 
was up 1.3 percent to 78, led by a gain for the combination of smaller travel Web sites, which 
includes the online presence of hotels and airlines. Big gainers in the retail space included 
Amazon, Chick-fil-A, and Nordstrom: All scored 86 on ACSI’s 100-point scale.1
Overview
This chapter focuses on integrating and controlling a retail strategy. We tie together the material 
detailed previously, show why retailers need coordinated strategies, and describe how to assess 
performance.
By integrating and regularly monitoring their strategies, firms of any size or format can take 
a proper view of the retailing concept and create a superior total retail experience. Consider how 
Dick’s Sporting Goods uses a three-pronged retail strategy to stay competitive against the pure 
online players such as Amazon.com and nimble and niche “athleisure” retailers such as Lululemon 
and Athleta, while its competitors Sports Authority and Sports Chalet have failed.
At Dick’s, increased exclusive private-label offerings sold under established brands such as 
Umbro and Maxfli increase store traffic and allow more pricing flexibility. Partnering with athletic 
apparel brands to offer store-within-a-store shops such as Nike Field House and Under Armour 
All-American stores increases store traffic, while reducing operating costs since interior design 
and fixtures are provided by the brands. Opening smaller, less-capital-intensive specialty stores 
such as Field and Stream (focused on hunting and fishing gear) and Chelsea Collective (targeting 
the female customer) that offer unique, tailored, brand experiences helps attract the fast-growing 
and less price-sensitive customer segments.2
As today’s retailers look to the future, they must deal with new strategic choices due to the 
globalization of world markets, economic uncertainty, evolving consumer lifestyles, competition 
among formats, and rapid technology changes such as the advances in mobile and social media. 
See Figure 20-1.
This site (www.bizmove 
.com/marketing/m2c.​
htm) raises a lot of good 
questions for retailers to 
think about in integrating 
their strategies.
FIGURE 20-1
The Need to Evolve 
To succeed in the long 
run, retail formats and 
individual retailers need 
to evolve. The retail life 
cycle is not static; new 
retail concepts regularly 
enter the marketplace 
as other retail concepts 
mature or fade away. 
Being open-minded, 
proactive, and flexible are 
essential for retailers to 
survive and thrive.

Part 8  •  Putting It All Together
Retailers would also be wise to study the strategies of successful firms such as Dick’s Sport-
ing Goods and those facing significant challenges. Consider Sports Authority, once the largest 
U.S. sporting goods chain. Its failure to rightsize itself and to formulate a more focused strategy 
to respond to the competitive threats of E-commerce and omnichannel rivals led to its demise in 
2016. Sports Authority grew in size and scale through mergers, each with distinct cultures, images 
and positioning, and overlapping markets, which resulted in inefficiencies, lower profits, and lower 
sales. Sports Authority’s strategy to counter the disruptive threat of Amazon was simply to match 
prices offered by online retailers, and reduce investments to modernize its store experience and 
merchandise or to enhance in-store sales support. Instead, it incentivized store shoppers to order 
merchandise online at considerable discounts and with free shipping. Although sporting goods 
shoppers came to stores armed with the latest information for the specific products and services best 
suited to their needs and purchase occasions, Sports Authority used mass marketing, which meant 
simplified assumptions regarding its merchandising assortment, product availability, and pricing to 
deal with the true desires of its customers. This muddled strategy met neither the needs of sporting 
enthusiasts—because the merchandise assortment and in-store experience were not specialized 
enough—nor was Sports Authority a destination store for occasional shoppers who found it cheaper 
and more convenient to shop online or at rivals such as Dick’s, Modell’s, and athleisure retailers.3
INTEGRATING THE RETAIL STRATEGY
A major goal of Retail Management has been to describe the relationships among the elements 
of a retail strategy and show the need to act in an integrated way. Figure 20-2 highlights the inte-
grated strategy of TJX, the off-price apparel retailer. TJX has been cited as a “high performance 
retailer”—and it outperforms most retailers. From fiscal 2011 through fiscal 2016, TJX’s sales 
rose every year. And, despite price pressures from the weak economy, its gross margins and profits 
remained strong.4 At our blog site (www.bermanevansretail.com), there are posts on ­integrated 
retail strategies.
Four fundamental factors especially need to be taken into account in devising and enacting 
an integrated retail strategy: planning procedures and opportunity analysis, properly defining 
productivity, performance measures, and scenario analysis. These factors are discussed next.
Planning Procedures and Opportunity Analysis
Planning procedures are enhanced by undertaking three coordinated activities. The process is then 
more systematic and reflects input from multiple parties:
1.	 Senior executives outline the firm’s overall direction and goals. This provides written guide-
lines for middle- and lower-level managers, who get input from various internal and external 
sources. These managers are encouraged to generate ideas at an early stage.
2.	 Top-down plans and bottom-up or horizontal plans are combined.
3.	 Specific plans are enacted, including checkpoints and dates.
Opportunities need to be studied with regard to their impact on overall strategy and not in 
an isolated manner. See Figure 20-3. The growth strategy of retailers expanding globally has 
often been via brick-and-mortar stores. With many global retail markets maturing and significant 
technological disruptions impacting domestic and international markets, retailers need to consider 
whether they prioritize digital or brick-and-mortar expansion or use an omnichannel bricks-and-
clicks approach. Retailers can be successful with any or all of these approaches, but the strat-
egy development process must include understanding the digital potential and brick-and-mortar 
potential of each market, and how it is evolving over time. Retailers must analyze and understand 
their company business models, capabilities, priorities, and preferences before finalizing channel 
strategy decisions.5
A useful retailer tool for evaluating opportunities is the sales opportunity grid, which rates 
the promise of new and established goods, services, procedures, and/or store outlets across a 
variety of criteria. Opportunities can be rated in terms of the integrated strategies the firms would 
follow if those options are pursued. Computer software makes it easy to use such a grid.
Table 20-1 shows a sales opportunity grid for a supermarket deciding which of two salad 
dressings to stock. Brand A is established; Brand B is new. Due to newness, the store believes 
Brand B sales would initially be lower, but first-year sales would be similar. The brands would 
be priced the same and occupy identical space. Brand B requires higher display costs but offers

TJX Companies has a long history, with the ﬁrst T.J. Maxx stores opening in 1977 and the current parent 
company name adopted in 1984. Today, TJX is a public ﬁrm that is oriented to the oﬀ-price retailing of 
apparel and home fashions in the United States and eight other countries. Overall, it operates 3,600 stores 
and 3 E-commerce sites. In its various markets, TJX’s retail chains include T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, Home 
Goods, Sierra Trading Post, Winners, HomeSense, T.K. Maxx, and Trade Secret. These chains all oﬀer 
discounted prices. Annual sales of TJX Companies, which have steadily increased, are nearly $6 billion.
TJX has these major goals: (1) To oﬀer great value through a combination of brands, fashion,
price, quality, and assortment. (2) To be the leader in the oﬀ-price retailing of the product
lines carried by its stores. (3) To grow globally. (4) To expand the store base by up to 50
percent in the long term. (5) To utilize company Web sites to complement the physical stores.
(6) To maintain excellence in operations and merchandising practices and implementation.
Although TJX engages in diﬀerentiated marketing, it does have a base of core customers.
These core customers are typically female, 25 to 54 years old, middle to upper middle in
household income, both fashion- and value-conscious, and also shop at department stores
and specialty stores, as well as online.
TJX’s strategy is consistent with its objectives and the characteristics and desires of 
its target customers. Employees represent a world-class buying work force. Stores 
are less elaborate than those of department and specialty stores. TJX engages in 
opportunistic buying to be able to oﬀer prices 20 to 60 percent less than full-priced 
retailers. Assortments change frequently to stimulate return visits to stores for 
bargain hunters looking for a “treasure hunt” experience. TJX uses a lean inventory 
management approach, whereby stores seldom have excess merchandise on hand. 
Stores are predominately self-service to hold down personnel costs. The ﬁrm is 
ﬂexible.
The TJX buying organization has more than 1,000 employees worldwide. TJX 
has strong relationships with vendors, and it buys from more than 18,000 of 
them. To be in a strong negotiating position, the top 25 vendors of TJX 
account for only 20 percent of the ﬁrm’s purchases. Also, products are sourced 
from more than 100 countries. TJX uses databases and consumer knowledge to 
market speciﬁc products and to communicate to customers in eﬃciently 
stimulating sales across all channels. Its marketing tools include advertising, 
E-commerce sites, social media, and more.
In the past four decades, TJX Companies has had just one year in which 
samestore sales fell from the prior year (none recently). It seeks to 
continuously drive sales and earnings growth. TJX regularly assesses its 
eﬀorts—companywide, as well as by store brand and country. Its 
business model is quite adaptable to the changing economic and retail 
environments, and the ﬁrm is quick to react to new trends and fading 
ones with regard to its merchandise selections.
a larger markup. Brand B would have a greater gross profit and net profit by the end of the first 
year. Based on the overall grid, Brand B is selected. Yet, if the store is more concerned about a 
quick profit, Brand A might be chosen.
Defining Productivity in a Manner Consistent with the Strategy
As we noted in Chapters 12 and 13, productivity refers to the efficiency with which a retail strategy 
is carried out; it is in any retailer’s interest to reach sales and profit goals while keeping control 
over costs. On the one hand, a retailer looks to avoid unnecessary costs. It does not want eight

salespeople working at one time if four can satisfactorily handle all customers. And it does not want 
to pay high rent for a site in a regional shopping center if customers would willingly travel a few 
miles farther to a less costly site. On the other hand, a firm is not looking to lose customers because 
there are insufficient sales personnel to handle the rush of shoppers during peak hours. It also does 
not want a low rent site if this means a significant drop in customer traffic. See Figure 20-4.
Potential trade-offs often mean neither the least expensive strategy nor the most expensive one 
is the most productive strategy; the former approach might not adequately service customers and 
the latter might be wasteful. An upscale retailer could not succeed with self-service, and it would 
be unnecessary for a discounter to have a large sales staff. The most productive approach applies 
a specific integrated retail strategy (such as a full-service jewelry store) as efficiently as possible.
Food Lion (part of the Brussels-based Ahold Delhaize Group) is a leading U.S. retailer—with 
nearly 1,100 supermarkets in 10 Southeast and Mid-Atlantic states. It carries 28,000 nationally 
Many retailers pay a lot of attention to developing strategies, but 
strategy implementation is equally important. Retail auditing mea-
sures the extent to which plans are implemented. This process can 
be conducted by either an in-house staff or outsourced to firms such 
as Field Agent (www.fieldagent.net) or Customer Impact (www 
.customerimpactinfo.com). In-house auditing is commonly used by 
large chains and franchises. Some retailers may prefer to outsource 
this activity to ensure an impartial, objective, and thorough audit. 
Common topics that are audited include inventory availability (par-
ticularly out-of-stock situations), compliance with planograms, pric-
ing accuracy, proper use of displays, cashier-related waiting times, 
and staff satisfaction. These areas are often assessed by observation. 
Other reviews, such as customer feedback and staff reviews, are 
based on interviews and surveys. These can be disguised (mystery 
shoppers assessing a salesperson’s performance) or nondisguised 
(customer satisfaction surveys). Auditing needs to adapt to the type 
of retailer. A restaurant audit would critically evaluate the kitchen 
area to ensure compliance with health codes. In contrast, the audit 
of an appliance retailer would need to evaluate a salesperson’s 
knowledge of the features of different model dishwashers.

and regionally advertised brand name products, as well as high-quality private-label products—as 
key element of its well-integrated strategy. Its supermarkets are directly owned or affiliates in 
a wide variety of store formats—supermarkets, online food delivery, and online order pick-up 
points. Food Lion stores recently underwent extensive remodeling, rebranding (“Easy, Fresh, and 
Affordable”), and a new three-tier pricing scheme that includes weekly “hot sale” items avail-
able to holders of its MVP loyalty card, “WOW” prices on key best-sellers, and “low prices” on 
essential items throughout the store.6
Ahold Delhaize Group’s U.S. chains include Giant Carlisle, Giant Landover, Hannaford, 
Martin’s, and Stop & Shop (New England and New York)—each with a distinct go-to-market 
strategy. Systemwide, the company has responded to a fast-changing retail environment shaped by 
customer trends, increased penetration of online and mobile usage in-store, higher acceptance of 
E-commerce (through ownership of the leading online grocer Peapod), and the fresh and organic 
food concept brand bfresh.7
Performance Measures
By outlining relevant performance measures—the criteria used to assess effectiveness—and setting 
standards (goals) for each of them, a retailer can better develop and integrate its strategy. Among 
the measures frequently used by retailers are total sales, average sales per store, sales by goods/service 
category, sales per square foot, gross margins, gross margin return on investment, operating income, 
inventory turnover, markdown percentages, employee turnover, financial ratios, and profitability.

Part 8  •  Putting It All Together
To properly gauge a strategy’s effectiveness, a firm should use benchmarking, whereby the 
retailer sets standards and measures its performance based on the achievements of its sector of 
retailing, specific competitors, high-performance firms, and/or the prior actions of the firm itself. 
It is necessary to look at internal as well as external standards. The goal of benchmarking is to 
use peer operating results to generate ideas for improving processes, approaches, considering 
technologies to reduce costs, strengthen customer satisfaction and loyalty and increase profits.8
A good free source is the “Monthly & Annual Retail Trade” section of the U.S. Census 
Bureau’s Web site (www.census.gov/retail). It shows about 25 years of data involving a monthly 
comparison of sales, purchases, gross margins, inventories, and inventory-to-sales ratios by retail 
category. In addition to monthly and annual store data, quarterly E-commerce data are reported.
Retailers of varying sizes—and in different goods or service lines—can also obtain compara-
tive data from such sources as the Small Business Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, 
Progressive Grocer, Stores, Chain Store Age, Retailing Today, BizMiner, Dun & Bradstreet, the 
National Retail Federation, Risk Management Association, and annual reports. Those retailers 
can then compare their performance with others.

A popular, independent, ongoing benchmarking survey is the American Customer Satisfac-
tion Index (ACSI; www.theacsi.org), briefly discussed earlier in the chapter. It addresses two 
questions: (1) Are customer satisfaction and evaluations of quality improving or declining in 
the United States? (2) Are they improving or declining for particular sectors of industry and for 
specific companies? The index is based on a scale of 0 to 100. A national sample of more than 
70,000 people takes part in phone interviews, with 250 interviews of current customers for each 
firm studied. In 2015, these were the satisfaction scores for some leading retailers: Amazon.com, 
83; Nordstrom, 82; Costco and Priceline, 81; Applebee’s, 79; Bed Bath & Beyond, 75; Home 
Depot, 73; McDonald’s, 69; and Abercrombies & Fitch, 65.9
There is now great interest in benchmarking service retailers. One well-known measurement 
tool is SERVQUAL, which lets service retailers assess their quality by asking customers to react 
to a series of statements in five areas of performance:10
▶
▶Reliability. Provide services as promised. Dependably handle service problems. Perform ser-
vices right the first time and when promised. Maintain error-free records.
▶
▶Responsiveness. Keep customers informed about when services will be done. Give prompt 
service. Be willing to help customers. Be ready to act on customer requests.
▶
▶Assurance. Employees must instill customer confidence and make customers feel safe 
in transactions. Employees must always be courteous and have the knowledge to answer 
questions.
▶
▶Empathy. Give customers individual attention in a caring way. Have the customer’s best 
interest at heart. Employees should understand customer needs. Provide convenient business 
hours.
▶
▶Tangibles. Use modern equipment. Provide visually appealing facilities and materials associ-
ated with the service. Employees must have a neat, professional appearance.
In reviewing the performance of others, firms should look at the best practices in ­retailing—
whether involving companies in their own business sector or other sectors. For example, the 
Tompkins Supply Chain Consortium (www.supplychainconsortium.com) includes a number of 
retailers. By joining the consortium, member companies get information to help them address 
issues such as:
▶
▶How their economic impact compares to that of their competitors and the needed areas of 
improvement
▶
▶How the competitiveness of their cost structures compare to that of their peers and if they are 
focusing on the right initiatives to optimize results
▶
▶How their operations compare to their peers’ operations in terms of efficiency, and what 
processes (including outsourcing) and technologies are used by leading high-performance 
companies
▶
▶How their peers measure supply-chain performance and how these peers are overcoming 
obstacles and challenges in the supply chain
▶
▶How performance metrics compare to those of their peers and how well they are meeting 
their objectives
▶
▶How their organization structures compare to those of their peers.11
For those retailers expanding internationally, A. T. Kearney (www.atkearney.com), the con-
sulting firm, has devised a Global Retail Development Index (GRDI). It measures the retail 
prospects in emerging countries with regard to four factors: market attractiveness, country risk, 
market saturation, and time pressure. According to the 2015 GRDI, China, Uruguay, Chile, Qatar, 
Mongolia, and Georgia were rated highest. These factors are equally weighted in computing a 
global retail development index score:12
▶
▶Market attractiveness: Based on retail sales per capita, population size, the level of urbaniza-
tion, and the ease of doing business
▶
▶Country risk: Based on political risk, economic performance, debt indicators, and credit rat-
ings, as well as the business costs of crime, violence, and corruption

A retailer can also benchmark its own internal performance, conduct gap analysis, and plan 
for the future. Through gap analysis, a company compares its actual performance against its 
potential performance and then determines the areas in which it must improve. As Figure 20-5 
indicates, gap analysis has four main steps.
Let us apply gap analysis to a hypothetical company, ABC Stores. Table 20-3 indicates its 
financial results for fiscal years that ended in December 31, 2013, through December 31, 2016. 
The data in the table may be used to benchmark ABC Stores in terms of its own performance. 
Between 2013 and 2016, ABC Stores saw sales growth rise, fall, and then rise again. The gross 
margin as a percent of sales remained strong, while operating expenses as a percent of sales 
declined, but saw an increase in 2016. Profitability declined initially and then rose. The current 
ratio declined. Inventory turnover fluctuated, but return on invested capital steadily improved. 
Sales per square foot steadily despite the volatility in its average sale per transaction; and compa-
rable store stores grew consistently. Overall, ABC Stores’ 2013–2016 performance was positive. 
This signals that the ABC Stores Company was successful in addressing gaps in its performance 
in the near term, and is regaining momentum.
To ensure gaps are minimized in relationship retailing, firms should do these tasks:
1.	 Customer insight: Analyze consumer data, such as sales, cost, and profits by segment.
What makes a good retail 
Web site? Companies can 
close the gap by looking at 
these excellent sites (www 
.awwwards.com/20-of-the-
very-best-e-commerce-web-
sites.html).
Retailers can indirectly encourage salespeople to make ques-
tionable ethical decisions. Let’s look at some tactics that may 
encourage unethical behavior. Many retail salespeople are paid 
on a sales commission; this motivates them to recommend more 
costly products than a customer needs. Car dealers often com-
pensate salespeople based on gross profit, rather than sales vol-
ume; this inspires salespeople to take advantage of a customer’s 
poor bargaining skills, immediate need for a new car, and/or lack 
of knowledge of a car’s trade-in value. Sometimes, high sales 
commissions are given for paid services such as extended warran-
ties for appliances and electronics. Retailers may knowingly have 
salespeople sell low-priced brands with poor quality reputations. 
Salespeople may be told to “do whatever it takes” to achieve a 
sale—even make promises they cannot fulfill.
Discuss how a retailer can avoid these and other unethical 
selling practices.

2.	 Customer profiling: Collect and merge transaction and lifestyle data to better under-
stand individual shoppers. Identify noncustomers who fit the profile of the firm’s best 
segment.
3.	 Customer life-cycle model: Analyze shopper behavior at various life stages, and review 
demographics by segment.
4.	 Extended business model: Based on steps (3) and (4), determine which customers to center 
on, how best to interact with them, and the best way to build and sustain relationships.
5.	 Relationship planning: Engage in all points of contact (in person, pickup, delivery, kiosk, 
phone, fax, computer, mobile, tablet) to interact with customers.
6.	 Implementation: Integrate all aspects of the retail strategy.13 
At our blog (www.bermanevansretail.com), we have posts related to benchmarking and gap 
analysis.
Scenario Analysis
In scenario analysis, a retailer projects the future by studying factors that affect long-run perfor-
mance and then forms contingency (“what if”) plans based on alternate scenarios (such as low, 
moderate, and high levels of competition). Given the rapid pace of change in the industry, this is 
an important tool for retailers and one that is used extensively to make projections for the future. 
Retail managers face the challenge of accomplishing their short-term goals while still anticipating 
disruptions that could alter established processes in the future.14 The significant number of recent 
store closings and bankruptcies are an indication of dramatic shifts in consumer buying habits 
and preferences, slow growth in consumer spending despite low unemployment rate, fierce price 
competition, and the pervasive impact of social, mobile, and Internet of Things technology in retail 
processes that benefit nimble, online firms at the expense of traditional retailers.15
Some traditional retailers are downsizing and restructuring to better integrate their supply 
chain so as to provide consistent omnichannel shopping experiences, quality customer service both 
in-store and online, and faster production of merchandise in response to customer trends. Lord & 
Taylor is partnering with quick-time supplier Xcel, which owns proprietary brands and labels and 
provides nimble sourcing to cut delivery time from 9 months to 6 weeks. J. C. Penney will place 
fewer initial orders of its private-label brands with suppliers in Bangladesh at the start of the sea-
son, use consumer data early in the selling season to identify winners, and place additional orders 
for winners only with Central American suppliers who can deliver in 6 weeks. This approach can 
help retailers sell more goods at full price similar to fast-fashion retailers such as Zara.16

Part 8  •  Putting It All Together
In planning for its future, Kohl’s (www.kohls.com) has a clear strategic plan. Here are 
selected elements of that plan:
▶
▶Organizational mission and positioning. Kohl’s is positioned as a family-focused, value-
oriented department store chain with an E-commerce Web site (www.Kohls.com). It offers 
moderately priced apparel, footwear, and accessories for women, men, and children, as well as 
beauty aids and home goods. Stores have a consistent product assortment with some regional 
differences. It features private and exclusive brands (“Only at Kohl’s”), and national brands.
▶
▶Goals. Kohl’s believes several goals are necessary for long-term success. Its strategic frame-
work, referred to as “the Greatness Agenda,” has five initiatives: “amazing product, incredible 
savings, easy experience, personalized connections, and winning teams.” These initiatives are 
expected to increase store and online customer traffic.
▶
▶Basic strategy. Kohl’s has clean, bright stores that offer an easy and desirable shopping 
experience. New mobile and tablet platforms offer an improved in-store digital experience. 
In 2015, Kohl’s launched “buy online, pick-up in store” (BOPUS) in all stores, thus offering 
convenience and driving incremental sales.
▶
▶Merchandising. About one-half of Kohl’s annual sales are from private and exclusive brands; 
the other one-half is from national brands. In the early 2000s, 75 percent of Kohl’s sales 
were from national brands, which have higher selling prices, but lower gross margins, than 
private and exclusive brands. Its private brands (Croft & Barrow, Sonoma Goods for Life, 
and others) are well-established and represent the best value in stores. Despite having lower 
selling prices, private brands generally have higher gross margins. The exclusive brands are 
developed and marketed through license agreements with recognized brands such as Food 
Network, Simply Vera by Vera Wang, and others. Their prices are lower than national brands 
but higher than private-label brands, and gross margins are higher than national brands but 
lower than private brands.
▶
▶Marketing. Kohl’s has a unique “nine-box merchandising grid” (“lifestyle matrix”) to focus 
its offerings and promotion strategy in a way that relates to both consumer lifestyles and 
price points.17

CONTROL: USING THE RETAIL AUDIT
After a retail strategy is devised and enacted, it must be continuously assessed and necessary 
adjustments made. A vital evaluation tool is the retail audit, which systematically examines 
and evaluates a firm’s total retailing effort or a specific aspect of it. The purpose of an audit is to 
study what a retailer is presently doing, appraise performance, and make recommendations for 
the future. An audit investigates a retailer’s objectives, strategy, implementation, and organization. 
Goals are reviewed and evaluated for their clarity, consistency, and appropriateness. The strategy 
Predicting the future is not 
simple (www.futurist.com/
blog).
Best Buy entered the Chinese market in 2006 after buying a 
majority interest in Jiangsu Five Star Appliance, a local retailer. 
In 2011, it closed its 184 Chinese stores, and in 2014, Best Buy 
sold its Chinese operations to a real-estate company. Accord-
ing to one analysis, a key reason for Best Buy’s failure was its 
store rental and channel strategy. Unlike in the United States and 
elsewhere, Chinese retailers more closely resemble real-estate 
firms that rent space to manufacturers. Manufacturers selling 
goods in China more closely resemble retailers in that they man-
age inventories, supervise and motivate salespeople, and pay 
for rent-related expenses. Also, unlike in the United States, an 
­appliance maker selling in China would place all of its products 
(such as dishwashers, air conditioners, and microwaves) in the 
same retail space. Best Buy’s strategy of operating its own stores 
as in other parts of the world was unfamiliar to Chinese consum-
ers, created supply chain conflicts, and resulted in higher prices 
to a cost-conscious market.
Explain how Best Buy could have avoided these issues.

and the methods for deriving it are analyzed. Also, the application of the strategy and how it is 
received by customers are reviewed. The organizational structure is analyzed with regard to lines 
of command and other factors.
Good auditing includes these elements: (1) Audits are conducted regularly. (2) In-depth analy-
sis is involved. (3) Data are amassed and analyzed systematically. (4) An open-minded, unbiased 
perspective is maintained. (5) There is a willingness to uncover weaknesses to be corrected, as 
well as strengths to be exploited. (6) After an audit is completed, decision makers are responsive 
to the recommendations made in the audit report.
Undertaking an Audit
There are six steps in retail auditing. See Figure 20-6 for an overview of the retail auditing pro-
cess, which is described next: (1) Determine who does an audit. (2) Decide when and how often 
an audit is done. (3) Establish the areas to be audited. (4) Develop audit form(s). (5) Conduct the 
audit. (6) Report to management.
DETERMINING WHO DOES THE AUDIT  One or a combination of three parties can be involved: a 
company audit specialist, a company department manager, and/or an outside auditor.

Part 8  •  Putting It All Together
A company audit specialist is an internal employee whose prime responsibility is the retail 
audit. The advantages of this person include the auditing expertise, thoroughness, level of knowl-
edge about the firm, and ongoing nature (no time lags). Disadvantages include the costs (especially 
for retailers that do not need full-time auditors) and the auditor’s limited independence.
A company department manager is an internal employee whose prime job is operations man-
agement; that manager may also be asked to participate in the retail audit. The advantages are that 
there are no added personnel expenses and that the manager is knowledgeable about the firm and 
its operations. Disadvantages include the manager’s time away from the primary job, the potential 
lack of objectivity, time pressure, and the complexity of companywide audits.
An outside auditor is not a retail employee but a paid consultant. Advantages are the auditor’s 
experience, objectivity, and thoroughness. Disadvantages are the high costs per day or hour (for 
some retailers, it may be cheaper to hire per-diem consultants than full-time auditors; the opposite 
is true for larger firms), the time lag while a consultant gains familiarity with the firm, the failure of 
some firms to use outside specialists continuously, and some employees’ reluctance to cooperate.
DETERMINING WHEN AND HOW OFTEN THE AUDIT IS CONDUCTED  Logical times for auditing 
are the end of the calendar year, the end of the retailer’s annual reporting year (fiscal year), or 
when a complete physical inventory is conducted. Each of these is appropriate for evaluating a 
retailer’s operations during the previous period. An audit must be done at least annually, although 
some retailers desire more frequent analysis. It is important that the same period(s), such as 
January–December, be studied to make meaningful comparisons, projections, and adjustments.
DETERMINING AREAS TO BE AUDITED  A retail audit typically includes more than financial 
analysis; it reviews various aspects of a firm’s strategy and operations to identify strengths and 
weaknesses. There are two types of audits. They should be used in conjunction with one another 
because a horizontal audit often reveals areas that merit further investigation by a vertical audit.
A horizontal retail audit analyzes a firm’s overall performance, from the organizational mis-
sion, to goals, to customer satisfaction, to the basic retail strategy mix and its implementation in an  
integrated, consistent way. It is also known as a “retail strategy audit.” A vertical retail audit 
analyzes—in depth—a firm’s performance in one area of the strategy mix or operations, such as  
the credit function, customer service, merchandise assortment, or interior displays. A vertical 
audit is focused and specialized.
DEVELOPING AUDIT FORMS  To be systematic, a retailer should use detailed audit forms. An audit 
form lists the area(s) to be studied and guides data collection. It usually resembles a questionnaire 
and is completed by the auditor. Without audit forms, analysis is more haphazard and subjective. 
Key questions may be omitted or poorly worded. Auditor biases may appear. Most significantly, 
questions may differ from one audit period to another, which limits comparisons. Examples of 
retail audit forms are presented shortly.
CONDUCTING THE AUDIT  Next, the audit itself is undertaken. Management specifies how long 
the audit will take. Prior notification of employees depends on management’s perception of two 
factors: the need to compile some data in advance to save time versus the desire to get an objec-
tive picture and not a distorted one (which may occur if employees have too much notice). With 
a disguised audit, employees are unaware that it is taking place. It is useful if the auditor investi-
gates an area such as personal selling and acts as a customer to elicit employee responses. With a 
nondisguised audit, employees know an audit is being conducted. This is desirable if employees 
are asked specific operational questions and to help in gathering data.
Some audits should be done while the retailer is open, such as assessing parking adequacy, 
in-store customer traffic patterns, the use of vertical transportation, and customer relations. Others 
should be done when the firm is closed, such as analyses of the condition of fixtures, inventory 
levels and turnover, financial statements, and employee records.
An audit report can be formal or informal, brief or long, oral or written, and a statement of 
findings or a statement of findings plus recommendations. It has a better chance of acceptance if 
presented in the format desired by management.
REPORTING AUDIT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO MANAGEMENT  The last auditing 
step is to present findings and recommendations to management. It is the role of management—
not the auditor—to see what adjustments (if any) to make. Decision makers must read the report

thoroughly, consider each point, and enact the needed strategic changes. They should treat each 
audit seriously and react accordingly. No matter how well an audit is done, it is not a worthwhile 
activity if management fails to enact recommendations.
Responding to an Audit
After management studies audit findings, appropriate actions are taken. Areas of strength are con-
tinued and areas of weakness are revised. The actions must be consistent with the retail strategy 
and noted in the firm’s retail information system (for further reference).
Retailers with multiple Web sites and/or a large number of brands or stores are dependent 
on many interconnected processes to ensure optimal customer experience and successful perfor-
mance. The best way of acting upon the results of retail audits is to tailor actions to local market 
conditions and demographics, incorporate variations in product assortment as necessary, engage 
in retail consolidation if appropriate, better handle a new or mature distributor and wholesaler 
network, and tweak go-to-market approaches if appropriate.18
Possible Difficulties in Conducting a Retail Audit
Several obstacles may occur in doing a retail audit. A retailer should be aware of them:
▶
▶An audit may be costly.
▶
▶It may be quite time consuming.
▶
▶Performance measures may be inaccurate.
▶
▶Employees may feel threatened and not cooperate as much as desired.
▶
▶Incorrect data may be collected.
▶
▶Management may not be responsive to the findings.
At present, many retailers—particularly small ones—still do not understand or perform sys-
tematic retail audits. But this must change if they are to assess themselves properly and plan 
correctly for the future.
Illustrations of Retail Audit Forms
Here, we present a management audit form and a retailing effectiveness checklist to show how 
small and large retailers can inexpensively, yet efficiently, conduct retail audits. An internal or 
external auditor (or department manager) could periodically complete one of these forms and then 
discuss the findings with management. The examples noted are both horizontal audits. A vertical 
audit would involve an in-depth analysis of any one area in the forms.
A MANAGEMENT AUDIT FORM FOR SMALL RETAILERS  Under the auspices of the U.S. Small 
Business Administration, a Marketing Checklist for Small Retailers was devised. Although writ-
ten for small firms, it is a comprehensive horizontal audit applicable to all retailers. Figure 20-7 
shows selected questions from this audit form. “Yes” is the desired answer to each question. For 
questions answered negatively, the firm must learn the causes and adjust its strategy.

its performance. Click 
“Our Businesses” and see 
how much information is 
available about the firm’s 
plans and results.
AuditNet (www.auditnet 
.org/audit-library) has a 
number of good resources 
on auditing.
One of the most useful parts of Microsoft’s Office suite is EXCEL 
spreadsheet software. Retail personnel can use EXCEL as a plan-
ning tool. By entering different assumptions for inventory levels, 
inventory turnover, prices and gross margins, and more, retail-
ers can compute return on sales, return on assets, and retail on 
equity. In addition, by using “if, then” or “what, if” assumptions, 
retail managers can estimate the impact of planned markdowns 
on inventory turnover and inventory holding costs. EXCEL is 
also a helpful tool in demand forecasting, assortment planning, 
and monitoring and updating a retailer’s open-to-buy position. 
These activities can be done on a buyer, department, merchan-
dise classification, store, and overall chain level. Because EXCEL 
calculations are often computed on a buyer level, it promotes 
bottom-up planning. A major advantage of bottom-up planning 
is the use of a buyer’s specialized knowledge. Bottom-up plan-
ning also elevates buyer morale.

EXCEL as a planning tool?

A RETAILING EFFECTIVENESS CHECKLIST  Figure 20-8 has another type of audit form to assess 
performance and prepare for the future: a retailing effectiveness checklist. It can be used by 
small and large firms alike. The checklist is more strategic than the Management Audit for Small 
­Retailers—which is more tactical. Unlike the yes–no answers in Figure 20-7, the checklist lets 
a retailer rate its performance from 1 to 5 in each area; this provides more in-depth information. 
However, a total score should not be computed (unless items are weighted), because all items are 
not equally important. A simple summation would not be a meaningful score.
FIGURE 20-8 
A Retailing Effectiveness Checklist
Rate your company’s effectiveness in each of these areas on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being strongly agree (excellent effort) 
and 5 being strongly disagree (poor effort). An answer of 3 or higher signifies that improvements are necessary.
A long-term organizational mission is clearly articulated.
The current status of the ﬁrm is taken into consideration when setting future plans.
Sustainable competitive advantages are actively pursued.
Company weaknesses have been identiﬁed and minimized.
The management style is compatible with the ﬁrm’s way of doing business.
There is a logical short-run and long-run approach to the ﬁrm’s chosen line of business.
There are speciﬁc, realistic, and measurable short- and long-term goals.
These goals guide strategy development and resource allocation.
The characteristics and needs of the target market are known.
The strategy is tailored to the chosen target market.
Customers are extremely loyal.
There are systematic plans prepared for each element of the strategy mix.
All important uncontrollable factors are monitored.
The overall strategy is integrated.
Short-, moderate-, and long-term plans are compatible.
The ﬁrm knows how each merchandise line, for-sale service, and business format stands in
the marketplace.
Tactics are carried out in a manner consistent with the strategic plan.
The strategic plan and its elements are adequately communicated.
Unbiased feedback is regularly sought for each aspect of the strategic plan.
Information about new opportunities and threats is sought out.
After enacting a strategic plan, company strengths and weaknesses, as well as successes and
failures, are studied on an ongoing basis.
Results are studied in a manner that reduces the ﬁrm’s chances of overreacting to a situation.
Strategic modiﬁcations are made when needed and before crises occur.
The ﬁrm avoids strategy ﬂip-ﬂops (that confuse customers, employees, suppliers, and others).
The company has a well-executed Web site or plans to have one shortly.
Chapter Summary
1.	 To demonstrate the importance of integrating a retail strat-
egy. This chapter shows why retailers need to plan and apply 
coordinated strategies, and it describes how to assess suc-
cess or failure. The stages of a retail strategy must be viewed 
as an ongoing, integrated system of interrelated steps.
2.	 To examine four key factors in the development and 
enactment of an integrated retail strategy: planning pro-
cedures and opportunity analysis, defining productivity, 
performance measures, and scenario analysis. Planning 
procedures can be optimized by adhering to a series 
of specified actions, from situation analysis to control. 
Opportunities must be studied in terms of their impact 
on overall strategy. A sales opportunity grid is good for 
comparing various strategic options.
To maximize productivity, retailers need to define 
exactly what productivity represents to them when they 
enact their strategies. Although firms should be efficient, 

532 
Part 8  •  Putting It All Together
this does not necessarily mean having the lowest possible 
operating costs (which may lead to customer dissatisfac-
tion) but rather keying spending to the performance stan-
dards required by a retailer’s chosen niche (such as upscale 
versus discount).
By applying the right performance measures and setting 
standards for them, a retailer can better integrate its strategy. 
Measures include total sales, average sales per store, sales 
by goods/services category, sales per square foot, gross mar-
gins, gross margin return on investment, operating income, 
inventory turnover, markdown percentages, employee 
turnover, financial ratios, and profitability. A. T. Kearney’s 
Global Retail Development Index is good for reviewing the 
retailing prospects in developing countries.
With scenario analysis, a retailer projects the future 
by examining the major factors that will have an impact 
on its long-term performance. Contingency plans are 
then keyed to alternative scenarios. This is not easy.
3.	 To show how industry and company data can be used 
in strategy planning and analysis (benchmarking and 
gap analysis). With benchmarking, a retailer sets its 
own standards and measures performance based on the 
achievements of its sector of retailing, specific competi-
tors, the best companies, and/or its own prior actions. 
Through gap analysis, a retailer can compare its actual 
performance against its potential performance and see 
the areas in which it must improve.
4.	 To show the value of a retail audit. A retail strategy must 
be regularly monitored, evaluated, and fine-tuned or 
revised. The retail audit is one way to do this. It is a sys-
tematic, thorough, and unbiased review and appraisal.
The audit process has six sequential steps: (1) deter-
mining who does the audit, (2) deciding when and how 
often it is conducted, (3) setting the areas to be audited, 
(4) preparing forms, (5) conducting the audit, and (6) 
reporting results and recommendations to management. 
After the right executives read the audit report, necessary 
revisions in strategy should be made.
In a horizontal audit, a retailer’s overall strategy and 
performance are assessed. In a vertical audit, one element 
of a strategy is reviewed in detail. Among the potential 
difficulties of auditing are the costs, the time commit-
ment, the inaccuracy of performance standards, the 
poor cooperation from some employees, the collection 
of incorrect data, and unresponsive management. Some 
firms do not conduct audits; thus, they may find it dif-
ficult to evaluate their positions and plan for the future.
Two audit forms are presented in the chapter: a man-
agement audit for retailers and a retailing effectiveness 
checklist.

PART 8
Case 1: Envision the Future: Part 1*
Note: Following are findings from a study encompassing an 
industrywide retailer survey and interviews by Meridian-
NorthStar Partners and Progressive Grocer; a similar supplier 
survey and interviews; a Web-based survey of 1,000 shop-
pers across age groups by Carbonview Research, a division of 
Stagnito Business Information + Edgell Communications; a 
review of industry learning; and incorporation of “real-world” 
in-market experience.
Changes—including new shopper purchase/delivery 
options, information sources, preferences for Millennials and 
others, and blurring of channels, including retail/“e-tail”—are 
redefining “requirements for success,” as noted by 91 percent 
of retailers and 95 percent of suppliers in an industrywide study.
Market changes are creating entirely new challenges and 
an unprecedented demand for new thinking and solutions. 
“Brick-and-mortar retailers need to come up with a better 
proposition to lure shoppers into their stores,” Chicago-based 
business consultancy Alix Partners told the New York Times. 
“‘Stack it high and let it fly’ doesn’t work anymore. They have 
to figure out how to make shopping fun again.”
The first challenge is Differentiation and Relevance. 
Expanding shopper options—for meal solutions, health and 
beauty, pet, and other categories—are a source of competition, 
especially with Millennials. Up to one-third of all shoppers and 
almost half of Millennials, shop in specialty stores, and online 
creates further challenges. These options are changing require-
ments for success. “We traditionally look at market basket and 
traffic,” said one retailer responding to our survey, “But our 
more fundamental need is differentiation and relevance in a 
world with more shopping options.”
A second challenge is Physical/Virtual Balance. Will the 
store be seen by shoppers, and Millennials in particular, as rel-
evant 5 years from now? The answer is yes, but with a caveat: 
The store must elevate its game. First, the good news: Shoppers, 
and Millennials specifically, feel online shopping will grow 
over the next 5 years, but the physical store will continue to 
play a big role for shopping and pickup. “Shoppers want both 
options—physical and virtual—and the ability to move between 
them,” another retailer responded.
Now, the caveat: A physical store must link to virtual shop-
ping options, but not diminish focus on the first challenge—dif-
ferentiation, relevance, and ability of the store to attract and 
excite people. As one retailer put it, “Focus on the store in an 
omnichannel environment is critical to our long-term survival.” 
A food supplier said, “We are projecting huge online growth, 
but even by 2020, this will only be 3 percent of our sales.”
Category management has played a key role for decades 
and will continue to do so, but today there is also need for an 
approach above this: to address the higher-level needs of shop-
pers and total-store needs of retailers. Shoppers’ needs aren’t 
confined by traditional category boundaries. For retailers, a gap 
exists between solutions developed across 150-plus categories 
and their need to prioritize and integrate these into a unified 
whole to excite and engage shoppers, and differentiate overall 
operations.
Suppliers and retailers both recognize there are limitations 
to category management for future shopper and store manage-
ment needs. “Category management is important, but it’s the 
price of entry, and by definition is more limited in scope and 
the kind of solutions it can provide,” a retailer responded. “You 
can’t win with this.” This higher-level shopper/store approach 
impacts the type and depth of insights that are developed, as 
well as the application of these insights.
While virtually all suppliers today have shopper insights, 
retailers express the need for broader business insights that are 
developed to more fully address both shopper and store needs. 
In addition to deeper and more developed insights, there’s a 
need for applications that identify “white space” beyond cat-
egory definitions, in terms of shopper need states and also retail 
execution.
Questions
1.	 What do you think about the methodology used to gather 
the data for this case? Explain your answer.
2.	 “The first challenge is Differentiation and Relevance.” Why 
is this true for retailers of all types and sizes? Why will this 
be even more difficult in the future?
3.	 “A second challenge is Physical/Virtual Balance.” Why is 
this true for retailers of all types and sizes? Why will this 
be even more difficult in the future?
4.	 What are the pros and cons of optimistic planning about the 
growth of online revenues?
Case 2: Envision the Future: Part 2*
Note: Following are findings from a study encompassing an 
industrywide retailer survey and interviews by Meridian-
NorthStar Partners and Progressive Grocer; a similar supplier 
survey and interviews; a Web-based survey of 1,000 shop-
pers across age groups by Carbonview Research, a division of 
Stagnito Business Information + Edgell Communications; a 
review of industry learning; and incorporation of “real-world” 
in-market experience.
Winning in today’s environment demands more, given the 
blurring of channels, both physical and virtual; the need to focus 
on not just consumer needs but also shopper needs; the retailers’ 
needs to address these in a compelling way; and a shift in the 
industry’s perceived “moment of truth,” from when a shopper 
is in front of a shelf with products to a much earlier point when 
the shopper considers which channel/retailer to shop.
The 2Es are critical today as differentiators—to excite and 
engage shoppers, and address the retailer need for a differenti-
ated image and relevance. Excitement: When shoppers walk 
by a section of the store, does it create a “wow”? An emotional

Part 8  •  Putting It All Together
connection? Does it make them need to enter and check it out? 
Does it provide a compelling alternative to specialty outlets? 
Engagement: The tactic of promotion focuses on communica-
tion to the shopper, but engagement focuses on dialog origi-
nating from the shopper. To compete with restaurant takeout, 
for example, where shoppers often use a mobile device to call 
ahead, is the same option available for your prepared food sec-
tion? With other sections of the store, is there opportunity for 
dialog before, in, and after the store?
Only 50 percent of shoppers indicated that they’re “fully 
or pretty loyal” to their primary grocery store; only 51 percent 
said that they have “high or somewhat high enjoyment” in the 
shopping experience; 41 percent said that it’s “not organized 
to the way I shop”; and 30 percent said, “I don’t think they 
focus on shopper needs when organizing products.” The 2Es 
have the potential to change the game. The “treasure hunt” of 
club stores and the “fun/excitement” in many specialty stores, 
noted in various studies, provide a helpful reference point. In 
our study, more than three-quarters of shoppers indicated that 
they’d be likely to shift “back” to their regular store if it offered 
a more engaging shopping experience.
In a very different business environment, it’s also instruc-
tive to revisit industry “truths” in two areas. The first is percep-
tions of the perimeter and the center store. The perimeter has 
unique elements, but also several others that can be broadly 
applied, such as category integration, visual appeal, informa-
tion/news, “stations,” and more.
The second is perception of a “common look” across the 
store. “Common look can be more weakness than strength,” 
another retailer asserted. “Why should the pet aisle look the 
same as household cleaning or snacks or HBC? These sections 
need to connect with shoppers, not just provide products. A pet 
is a family member. Beverages provide purity, variety, enjoy-
ment. OTC meets treatment and preventive needs.” Creating a 
more exciting, engaging retail experience must take a broader 
approach than trying to solve center store problems with center 
store tactics, or maintaining a common look across the store.
Look at a top-five grocery retailer to illustrate certain 
opportunities, but observations and implications also apply to 
other channels. The store has a typical perimeter, and the cen-
ter store has 24 aisles. There’s a numbered sign at the end of 
each aisle that lists seven to eight product types found in that 
aisle, or almost 200 categories. Signs are the same shape and 
color, and aisles generally use the same “fixturing” and other 
elements. Certain product types (e.g., beverages) occupy three 
entire aisles, but aren’t next to one another. Other product types 
(e.g., HBC, pet, general merchandise) are typically their own 
aisles. End-aisle displays are used, often for items that typically 
don’t align with the product types stocked in the aisles adjacent 
to them.
Questions
1.	 Explain why the 2Es are so important for forward-looking 
retail planning.
2.	 What’s the last retailer—physical store or online store—
that excited you? Describe what excited you. Did this 
encourage you to buy more or pay a quick return visit? 
Why or why not?
3.	 As a shopper, do you want the retailer to engage with you? 
Based on your answer, what should the retailer do to culti-
vate your continuing business?
4.	 What are the pros and cons of a supermarket radically rede-
signing its store interior and layout?

Achieving Excellence in Retailing*
Introduction
The 2016 A. T. Kearney Achieving Excellence in Retail Opera-
tions (AERO) study uncovers both the good and the bad in this 
new era of store operations. The good: a clear and consistent 
trend of “smarter” retail. Survey responses from executives at 
more than 100 global retailers reveal that companies are align-
ing store operations strategies and metrics to the new omnichan-
nel environment and are investing heavily in providing support. 
Pilots and trials are evolving more rapidly and more fulfillment 
options are quickly becoming available across all retail sectors.
The bad: AERO points to the many challenges retailers 
face in effectively adopting these smarter strategies and metrics. 
Although technology is the number-one retail investment today, 
there’s limited visibility on the return on investment. Amid the 
noise of technology investment and omnichannel integration, 
store associates are often overlooked as crucial conduits for 
improved store performance. And importantly, the study points 
to a misalignment between consumer expectations and retailer 
offerings, with retailers investing in services that customers 
may not want, need, or expect, particularly in terms of fulfill-
ment, in-store technology, and social engagement. In seeking 
to be all things to all people, are retailers driving unnecessary 
cost and complexity in their operations?
The 2016 AERO study probes these key trends in retail 
today, offers insightful case studies, and shares our thoughts 
on potential solutions By understanding the new rules of the 
game, improved retail operations can be a path to success in 
this new retail era.
A Smarter Way to Manage Retail Operations
Omnichannel has ushered in the next wave of growth in retail. 
But defining what it exactly is depends on who you’re talking 
to. Is it uniform messaging across channels? Seamless fulfill-
ment across channels? Consistent pricing across channels? All 
of the above? Regardless of how it is defined, any retailer will 
tell you that its impact on retail operations has been incredible.
The AERO findings point to major changes already in 
place in stores to support omnichannel. Eighty-six percent of 
retailers have aligned store strategies and metrics to support an 
omnichannel environment. Store associates are being trained 
on cross-platform engagement, incentivized to sell through 
E-commerce channels, and rewarded for in-store fulfillment.
Training on consumer engagement, education, and sales 
is evolving as retail leaders rethink their stores’ role into 
showrooms, mini-distribution centers, education centers, and 
the like. Gone are the days when a store’s success was based 
solely on the revenue generated within the four walls, with store 
profit and incentive structures refined to include its surrounding

E-commerce business. This has also fundamentally changed 
how store associates need to think about their customers.
Retailers are also getting smarter about when, where, and 
how they test their new concepts in stores. In our 2013 survey, 
we found that 19 percent of retailers had an active pilot pro-
gram; today, the number is above 30 percent. This year’s survey 
finds some retailers are well down the path to a store operations 
toolset to be successful.
John Lewis Case Study  John Lewis, a 150-year-old U.K. 
department store, found a smarter way to manage technology and 
ultimately provide a differentiated service offering to consumers. 
The success started with several pilot programs. It used online 
technologies to pilot an “omnichannel store” that offered the full 
assortment of John Lewis products in a smaller format. Its app 
gave consumers access to 250,000 products, product reviews, 
price matches, wish lists, and videos. In-store iPads and comput-
ers gave consumers access to thousands of products not currently 
in the store, along with fulfillment options to a home or a store. 
And a click-and-collect program allowed customers to buy a 
range of products from John Lewis and other subsidiary brands, 
from clothing to homewares, online and then collect in one trip.
John Lewis’ offering has proved successful. Today, one-
third of sales are from online purchases, worth roughly $1.5 
billion, with growth in that channel of 25 percent. Its click-
and-collect orders have reached 6 million per year, a 17-fold 
increase from 350,000 in 2008, its first year.
Aligning Consumer Expectations and Retailer Offerings
Despite the wave of exciting activity to support omnichannel, 
many bets that retailers are placing in store operations aren’t 
necessarily bringing desired results. Our study points to mis-
alignment between retail offerings and consumer expectations. 
As retailers take leaps forward toward “omnichannel nirvana,” 
consumers are only demanding small steps.
While we expect expectations to shift as more options 
become available and known, the findings point to the need for 
simply getting this basic capability right; more than a third of 
respondents say their company falls short.
For example, we’ve also seen the race to near immedi-
ate shipping times—from next-day to same-day to one-hour 
shipping. Despite this focus, more than three-quarters of con-
sumers surveyed say they merely expect two days or more for 
shipping. Consumers say they are more interested in retailers 
fulfilling their promises—getting products when they were told 
they would—rather than on getting the product immediately. 
See Figure 1.
These issues have dramatic implications on retail opera-
tions—the need for new capabilities, skill sets, and tools, and 
for workflow and incentives to meet omnichannel expectations. 
The missed opportunity is when a retailer’s offering and the 
investments needed to produce it are far separated from cus-
tomer expectations. What consumers value should underpin 
omnichannel investments in store operations—and not merely 
a retailer’s “omnichannel vision.” This will help avoid unnec-
essary cost and complexity, and ultimately reduce consumer 
confusion.

Part 8  •  Putting It All Together
consumers actually expect and what retailers are offering on 
social media. More than 60 percent of retailers say they still 
focus on mining social media to generate value. Two-thirds of 
consumers, on the other hand, say they are not engaging with 
retailers on social media at all; for those that do, the primary 
reason is to get a coupon or a discount. See Figure 3.
Is this another case of misalignment between the retailer’s 
offering and consumer expectations? Consider that more than 
85 percent of consumers say that social-media interactions do 
not lead to store visits; and when asked to rank a number of 
touch points with retailers, consumers ranked social media the 
least valuable out of 13 listed. Store location, product selection, 
and store cleanliness topped the list.
This does not mean that retailers should stop investing so 
much time and effort in social media. Rather, they must refocus 
on doing it right. Retailers that have pulled ahead of the pack 
when it comes to social media engagement and the value they’re 
generating from it are interacting with customers online and 
creating a sense of community.
Warby Parker Case Study  Warby Parker’s eyeglass cus-
tomers are more highly engaged on social media than those 
of typical retailers. Its strong social mission makes it popular 
with the younger population. The company also maintains a 
consistent, recognizable look across eyewear, Web site content, 
and store experience.
It succeeds in its social mission by regularly promot-
ing unique and exclusive events that are apt to be shared on 
social media. It encourages interfacing with social media over 
the “try-on” period. Its #warbyhometryon hashtag gives the 
company an “expert” opinion of what its customers think of 
their eyewear.
Store Associates: The Unsung Heroes of Retail
So much focus today is on the consumer of the future, on new 
and exciting technologies, and on social media engagement, but 
the AERO findings show that the real heroes of store operations 
Technology: Hopes and Frustrations
This year’s study finds once again that retailers are investing 
heavily in technology, yet are still struggling with figuring out 
its value. Technology is the number-one area of investment 
according to respondents in our 2016 study, with nearly every 
respondent saying they will invest in it. Yet nearly 60 percent 
surveyed say their company struggles with executing and mea-
suring its return on investment. These results are slightly better 
than the findings in 2013, yet still quite low. See Figure 2.
So what’s going on here? Why are retailers continuing year 
after year to toss money at technology in an effort to chase after 
the next big thing in retail, yet coming up short?
We believe the answer lies with the focus of these invest-
ments. Ninety percent or so of retail sales still happen within 
the four walls of a physical store. Yet almost none of the invest-
ments we see today are about helping store associates do their 
jobs better. Instead, most focus on consumer-facing technology, 
even though 80 percent of consumers say they experience poor 
service when directly interacting with in-store technology. Just 
because there is a poor service experience today doesn’t mean 
to stop trying. Focusing investments on tools and informa-
tion that enable the employee to better engage with customers 
and meet true customer needs will remain valuable. There is 
an opportunity to close the information gap regarding in-store 
customer interactions (such as preferences based on in-store 
activities), but that will require a greater sense of trust and will-
ingness to share information than we have today.
The retailers that are investing in technology are success-
fully using it to help store associates. It helps ease the burden 
of execution also, as associates are incentivized to learn, adopt, 
and implement new technology solutions to boost productivity, 
sales, and potentially their own commissions.
Social Currency
Another focus area in the age of omnichannel is social media, 
and the value retailers can generate from getting it right.

are in-store associates, and they are often being overlooked. 
Customers say that experience and service have the greatest 
impact on productivity. Yet we consistently find that store asso-
ciates get little investment focus.
Nearly one-half of retailer respondents said employee 
training programs could be “significantly improved.” More 
than 70 percent of retailers expect spans of control to widen in 
the immediate future. And nearly all express concern regard-
ing their workforce’s ability to adapt to a new omnichannel 
environment. In our opinion, it’s not that retailers have had store 
associates with poor skill sets, but rather that they have not had 
the right focus on what it takes to properly support in-store staff.
Store associates are the most important assets retailers 
have; they are central to the future of any store. Investments 
should focus on the core fundamentals of what it takes to sup-
port store associates: training, incentives, career progression, 
and corporate support to meet expectations. Interestingly, about 
three-quarters of retailers plan to invest in more training and 

538 
Part 8  •  Putting It All Together
labor; but right now, the workforce needs more support to do its 
most critical task: deliver superior customer service.
Driving to “Smarter” Retail
With the omnichannel age here, retailers are rapidly evolving 
store operations capabilities to support. How do you know if 
your retail organization is ready to realize its full value?
▶
▶Do you have a defined business strategy linking metrics 
across channels and store formats?
▶
▶Do you use learning stores and pilots for trying out change 
programs to understand the impact of your omnichannel 
investments?
▶
▶How well are you measuring the return on investment 
(ROI) for your retail technology expenditures?
▶
▶Are your online order delivery service levels aligned to 
effectively deliver to your customer when promised?
▶
▶How can you drive more value for you and your customers 
from social media?
▶
▶How are you investing in your in-store associates to set 
them up for success?
The truth is, many retailers are starting to answer these 
questions affirmatively. New strategies are seeking to meet con-
sumer expectations, new metrics are more properly measuring 
and incentivizing store staff, and focused and more frequent 
store pilots are getting answers faster.
However, in their chase for “omnichannel nirvana,” retail-
ers need to get better at the basics of omnichanne—a dedicated 
focus on what the customer wants and needs; support to ensure 
that investments improve store performance; clear reviews about 
returns on investment; and an understanding of how in-store 
associates can be supported. Retail remains a people business. 
Getting that part right remains a critical ingredient for success.
Research Methodology
About the Study  A. T. Kearney’s Achieving Excellence 
in Retail Operations (AERO) study provides insights into how 
retailers globally can improve their operations. This year’s study 
captured more than 100 responses from senior retail executives 
in the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific, offering a view of 
emerging global best practices in store operations. It covers mul-
tiple sectors, including apparel, health and personal care, mass-
market and hypermarket, electronics, food and grocery, and cash 
and carry.
Besides the retailer perspective, this year’s study also 
brings in the consumer view. We surveyed nearly 800 North 
American consumers across demographic backgrounds, and 
their responses provide a clear view of the consumer’s opin-
ion of store operations. In the study, we compare and contrast 
retailer perspectives with those of consumers, identifying what 
is truly important to today’s retail environment.
The study is based on A. T. Kearney’s Store Operations 
Framework; see Figure 4. This framework, which was also used 
to pioneer the 2010 study, evaluates operations across setting 
strategic direction, delivering core value, optimizing expenses, 
and driving lasting change.

Appendix  Careers in Retailing
Overview
A person looking for a career in retailing has two broad possibilities: owning a business or work-
ing for a retailer. One alternative does not preclude the other. Many people open their own retail 
businesses after getting experience as employees. A person can also choose franchising, which 
has elements of both entrepreneurship and managerial assistance (as discussed in Chapter 4).
Regardless of the specific retail career path chosen, recent college graduates often gain per-
sonnel and profit-and-loss responsibilities faster in retailing than in any other major sector of 
business. After an initial training program, an entry-level manager supervises personnel, works 
on in-store displays, interacts with customers, and reviews sales and other data on a regular basis. 
An assistant buyer helps in planning merchandise assortments, interacting with suppliers, and 
outlining the promotion effort. Our blog (www.bermanevansretail.com) has loads of career-related 
materials: We

▶

THE BRIGHT FUTURE OF A CAREER IN RETAILING
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that employment in retailing will grow by about 
7 percent between 2014 and 2024.1 In addition to new positions being available, there will 
be opportunities to advance in a retail career via designated career paths. For example, many 
­employees who started as a retail salesperson have progressed to department level sales managers.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the largest retail employers are general mer-
chandise stores (including warehouse clubs, supercenters, dollar stores, and variety stores), and 
food and beverage stores. The next largest employers include motor vehicle and parts dealers, and 
clothing and clothing accessory stores.
The National Retail Federation offers a lot of valuable advice and resources at its “Retail 
Careers Center” Web site (www.nrf.com/career-center).
OWNING A BUSINESS
Owning a retail business is popular, and many opportunities exist. Most retail outlets are sole 
proprietorships; and many of today’s giants began as independents, including Walmart, Home 
Depot, J.C. Penney, McDonald’s, Sears, Cheesecake Factory, and Mrs. Fields.
Too often, people overlook the possibility of owning a retail business. Initial investments can 
be quite modest (several thousand dollars). Direct marketing (both mail order and online retailing), 
direct selling, and service retailing often require relatively low initial investments—as do various 
franchises. Financing may also be available from banks, suppliers, store-fixture firms. and equip-
ment companies. Furthermore, owning a business gives the operator opportunity to be flexible 
in choosing among retail formats, to serve unique niches, to be independent of stockholders and 
other publics. In many cases, there are few or no licensing standards.
OPPORTUNITIES AS A RETAIL EMPLOYEE
As we’ve noted before, in the United States, tens of millions of people are employed by traditional 
retailers, as well as others who are employed by firms such as banks, insurance companies, and 
airlines. More people work in retailing than in any other industry.

540	
APPENDIX  •  CAREERS IN RETAILING
Career opportunities are plentiful because of the number of new retail businesses that open 
and the labor intensity of retailing. Thousands of new outlets open each year in the United States, 
and certain segments of retailing are growing at particularly rapid rates. Many large retailers also 
plan to open many new stores in foreign markets. The increased employment from new store open-
ings and the sales growth of retail formats (such as supercenters) also mean there are significant 
opportunities for personal advancement for talented retail personnel. Every time a chain opens a 
new outlet, there is a need for a store manager and other management-level people.
Selected retailing positions, career paths, and compensation ranges are described next.
Types of Positions in Retailing
Employment is not confined to buying and merchandising. Retail career opportunities also encom-
pass advertising, public relations, credit analysis, marketing research, warehouse management, 
information technology, human resource management, accounting, and real-estate. Look at our 
Web site for a list and description of a wide range of retailing positions. Some highly specialized 
jobs may be available only in large retail firms.
The type of position a person seeks should be matched with the type of retailer likely to have 
such a position. Chain stores and franchises typically have real-estate divisions. Department stores 
and chain stores usually have large human resource departments. Mail-order firms often have 
advertising production departments. Franchises and fast-growing retailers commonly have large 
real-estate departments. And online firms have Web site design, Web analytics, and large order 
fulfillment departments. If one is interested in travel, a buying position or a job with a retailer 
having geographically dispersed operations should be sought.
Career Paths and Compensation in Retailing
For college graduates, executive training programs at larger retailers offer good learning experi-
ences and advancement potential. These firms often offer careers in both merchandising and 
nonmerchandising areas.
Here is how a new college graduate could progress in a career path at a typical department 
store or specialty store chain: He or she usually begins with a training program (lasting from three 
months to a year or more) on how to run a merchandise department. That program often involves 
on-the-job and classroom experiences. On-the-job training includes working with records, reorder-
ing stock, planning displays, and supervising salespeople. Classroom activities include learning 
how to evaluate vendors, analyze computer reports, forecast fashion trends, and administer store 
policy.
After initial training, the person becomes an entry-level operations manager (often called a 
sales manager, assistant department manager, or department manager—depending on the firm) 
or an assistant buyer. An entry-level manager or assistant buyer works under the direction of a 
seasoned department (group) manager or buyer and analyzes sales, assists in purchasing goods, 
handles reorders, and helps with displays. The new manager supervises personnel and learns store 
operations; the assistant buyer is more involved in purchases than operations. Depending on the 
retailer, either person may follow the same type of career path, or the entry-level operations man-
ager may progress up the store management ladder and the assistant buyer up the buying ladder.
During this time, responsibilities and duties depend on the department (group) manager’s or 
buyer’s willingness to delegate and teach. When a manager or buyer has authority to make deci-
sions, the entry-level manager or assistant buyer will usually have more responsibility. If a firm 
has centralized management, a manager (buyer) is more limited in his or her responsibilities, as 
is the entry-level manager or assistant buyer. Further, an assistant buyer will gain more experi-
ence if he or she is in a firm near a wholesale market center and can make trips to the market to 
buy merchandise.
The next step in a department store or specialty store chain’s career path is promotion to 
department (group) manager or buyer. This position is entrepreneurial—running a business. The 
manager or buyer selects merchandise, develops a promotional campaign, decides which items 
to reorder, and oversees personnel and record keeping. For some retailers, manager and buyer are 
synonymous. For others, the distinction is as just explained for entry-level positions. Generally, a 
person is considered for promotion to manager or buyer after two years.
Large department store and specialty store chains have additional levels of personnel to plan, 
supervise, and assess merchandise departments. On the store management side, there can be group 

	
APPENDIX  •  CAREERS IN RETAILING	
541	
managers, store managers, branch vice-presidents, and others. On the buying side, there can be 
divisional managers, merchandising vice-presidents, and others.
At many firms, advancement is indicated by specific career paths. This lets employees moni-
tor their performance, know the next career step, and progress in a clear manner. Selected retail 
career paths are shown in the careers section of our Web site.
As an illustration of the diversity in retail career paths, Table 1 lists 10 retail positions with 
unique responsibilities. Table 2 lists compensation ranges for personnel in various retailing

Searching for Career Opportunities in Retailing
Various sources should be consulted. These include your school placement office, company 
directories and Web sites (such as www.linkedin.com), ads in your local newspapers, Web net-
working and job sites, and networking (with professors, friends, neighbors, and family members). 
Here are some hints to consider:
▶
▶Incorporate internships into your college experience. This lets you try out different types of 
positions, different types of retailers, different goods/service categories, and different size 
firms. Internship sponsors also can directly see your job-related skills and motivation.
▶
▶Do not “place all your eggs in one basket.” Do not rely too much on friends and relatives. 
They may be able to get you an interview but not a guaranteed job offer.
▶
▶Be serious and systematic in your career search. Plan in advance and do not wait until the 
recruiting season starts at your school to generate a list of retail employers.
▶
▶Use directories with lists of retailers and current job openings. Online listings include Career-

▶Rely on the “law of large numbers.” In sending out résumés, you may have to contact at least 
10 to 20 retailers to get just two to four interviews.
▶
▶Make sure your résumé and cover letter highlight your best qualities. These may include school 
honors, officer status in an organization, work experience, computer skills, and the proportion 
of college tuition you paid. Also aim your résumé and cover letter to each specific potential 
employer. Our Web site shows a sample résumé for an entry-level position in retailing.
▶
▶Show your résumé to at least one professor, your college’s placement office manager, or other 
advisor. Be receptive to their constructive comments. Remember, their goal is to help you get 
the best possible first job.
▶
▶Be professional at social media sites. Companies may look you up at Facebook, LinkedIn, and 
other social media sites. Be careful what you have posted—including the pictures you display.
Preparing for the Interview
The initial and subsequent interviews for a position, which may last for 20 to 30 minutes or longer, 
play a large part in determining if you get a job offer. Thus, you should prepare for all interviews:
▶
▶Adequately research each firm. Be aware of its goods/service category, current size, overall 
retail strategy, competitive developments, and so on.
▶
▶Anticipate questions and plan general responses. “Tell me about yourself.” “Why are you 
interested in a retailing career?” “Why do you want a job with us?” “What are your major 
strengths?” “Your major weaknesses?” “What do you want to be doing five years from now?” 
“What would your prior boss say about you?” In preparation, role-play your answers to these 
questions with someone.
▶
▶Treat every interview as if it is the most important one. Otherwise, you may not be properly 
prepared if the position turns out to be more desirable than you originally thought. And 
remember that you represent both your college and yourself at all interviews.
▶
▶Be prepared to raise your own questions when asked to do so in the interview. They should 
relate to career paths, training, and opportunities for advancement.
▶
▶Dress appropriately and be well groomed.
▶
▶Verify the date and place of the interview. Be prompt.
▶
▶Have a pen and pad (or PDA/smartphone) to record information after an interview is over.
▶
▶Write a note to the interviewer within a week to thank him or her for spending time with you 
and to express a continuing interest in the company.
Evaluating Retail Career Opportunities
Job seekers often place too much emphasis on initial salary or the firm’s image in assessing career 
opportunities. Many other factors should be considered, as well:
▶
▶What activities do you like?
▶
▶Would you regard the position as fulfilling?

UPWARD MOBILITY IN YOUR CAREER: THE CHIEFS  
OF RETAILING2
While it’s become more common to hear about new “chief” roles, determining the specifics of 
what each is responsible for can be tricky. When an employer, a headhunter, or a colleague learns 
someone is a CFO – chief financial officer – a reasonably clear picture of that person’s role 
emerges. If the title is chief experience officer, however, the definition is far less clear.
Susan Hart, co-leader of Spencer Stuart’s global executive search and leadership consulting 
practice, admits that finding the right candidate for these jobs often requires a deep dive into the 
employers’ exact qualifications, but it’s not all that different from other jobs the company is asked 
to fill. “Every company is somewhat unique, so it’s up to us to probe how they operate, how they 
expect this candidate to interface with others in the company, what’s the structure of the job,” she 
says. “We start with a diagnostic, then work to zero in on the right person.”
She says chief digital officers are currently in high demand, and it is a position that could be 
a breeding ground for future retail CEOs. “The 21st-century retail CEO needs to be fluent in all 
things digital, E-commerce, and marketing,” she says. “They need to know how to use data to gain 
customer insight. Oftentimes, much of that is what the chief digital officer is working on today.”
Maryam Morse, national retail practice leader for Hay Group, believes some retailers are 
working through hiccups as they carve out a course for the newly named chiefs to follow. “Firms 
are making the leap by designating a chief digital officer, but most say they’re paving the path as 
they go.” In the past, retail “celebrated and rewarded individual accountability. Now, leaders are 
asked to think differently (to apply companywide thinking to every task) to keep the customer at 
the center.”
That was exactly the case for Kathy Doyle Thomas of Half Price Books. Thomas logged 
several years as vice-president of marketing and development before being named chief strategy 
officer. “Decisions to elevate someone to ‘chief’ are grounded in the importance of a certain 
­business objective — whether that be digital or innovation or whatever,” she says. “There are a 
lot of VPs in retail, and as that organizational structure progressed the need to designate a chief 
became more apparent.”
Thomas views “chief” titles as indicative of executives who are being called upon for more 
big-picture thinking. “As chief strategy officer, I’m charged with exploring any new opportuni-
ties for the company—ranging from new revenue-generating opportunities to exploring outside 
partnerships,” she says. “I’m being asked to come up with new ideas that will increase sales rather 
than focusing my attention on the nuts and bolts of one portion of the company.”
Will those functions and responsibilities be understood and valued outside Half Price Books, 
were she to move on? “That’s hard to say,” Thomas admits. “I would imagine the responsibilities 
of the chief strategy officer would be different from one company to the next. Still, in this role, 
my job is to encourage and to help make things happen, but I don’t necessarily get credit for that. 
For example, I can push for certain divisions to carry different merchandise, but if and when they 
do, that’s something a buyer would be rewarded for. So much of this comes down to recognizing 
how different retail is now from what it looked like even just a few years ago.”
Many experts feel the inclination to name more retail chiefs is a positive trend, but they’re 
guarded about the staying power of the titles. “I see these chief titles as catalytic roles at a point

in time,” Eamonn Kelly, a director with Deloitte Consulting, says. “They’re trying to make a con-
nection between advances in digital and customer and technology. If a firm gets that right and 
embraces customer-centric thinking—that’s a success, and these roles wouldn’t be needed five 
years later. What really matters is the ability to combine a deep understanding of the customer 
with an understanding of how digital technology will drive new sources of customer value. Then 
everyone wins—the customer, the retailer and the industry.”
