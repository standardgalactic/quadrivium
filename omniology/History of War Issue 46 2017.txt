This month Mike spoke with 
his friend, Vietnam veteran 
Sammy L. Davis, about the

I
n the 21st century the battle 
against terrorism has 
seemingly re-deﬁned war for 
a new era, where the streets of 
Western cities are the 
battleﬁelds, and innocent 
civilians are turned into military 
targets. Of course, this form of 
warfare is sadly nothing new.   
In 1980 the Iranian Embassy 
Siege pitted brutal terrorist 
tactics against the elite training 
and professionalism of the 
Special Air Service – all 
broadcast on live television to 
stunned audiences. 
The result showed the world 
the immense capabilities of the 
SAS, who would mostly remain 
anonymous for years. Operation 
Nimrod has since become the stuff of 
legend, and a truly important event in 
military history.

SECOND WAR OF SCOTTISH 
INDEPENDENCE
Although Scotland’s independence was 
ofﬁcially recognised in 1328, the English 
continued to support Edward Balliol – a rival 
claimant to the Scottish throne – against 
the infant David II, 
Robert the Bruce’s 
son. Despite many 
Scottish defeats, 
David managed to 
keep his throne. 
BATTLE OF OTTERBURN
Decades of tension and political instability in England 
encouraged the Scots to invade as far south as 
Durham. At Otterburn, the Scots defeated an 
English surprise night attack that sealed 
the martial reputations of both 
James Douglas and Henry 
‘Hotspur’ Percy.
BATTLE OF HALIDON HILL
After Edward Balliol’s short-lived assumption of 
the Scottish throne after the Battle of Dupplin 
Moor, Edward III of England openly declared 
his support and besieged Berwick. A relieving 
Scottish army was then defeated in Edward’s 
ﬁrst notable victory of his career.

BATTLE OF HOMILDON HILL
in 1400 Henry IV became the last English king to 
personally invade Scotland, but the campaign failed. 
However, Sir Henry Percy heavily defeated an invading 
Scottish force at the Battle of Homildon Hill two years later. 
THE ROUGH

When the Scots 
refused, punitive 
English expeditions 
devastated southern 
Scotland while Mary 
was smuggled away 
to France.
SIEGE OF ROXBURGH CASTLE
James II of Scotland aimed to recapture all 
English castles in Scotland while England 
was preoccupied with the Wars of the Roses. 
However, James was killed when one of his 
cannons exploded while he was besieging 
Roxburgh Castle.

It is estimated that at least 10,000 Scots were 
killed at Flodden and James IV’s death ushered 
in a long period of political instability in Scotland
BATTLE OF FLODDEN
The 9 September, 1513, saw the largest battle to take 
place between England and Scotland after James IV 
invaded Northumberland while Henry VIII was away in 
France. However, James was heavily defeated and killed 
in one of the worst military calamities in Scottish history.

“NEWS OF THE HUMILIATING DEFEAT 
REPUTEDLY HASTENS THE DEATH OF 
JAMES V AND RESULTS IN THE ASCENSION 
OF HIS SIX DAY-OLD DAUGHTER MARY TO 
THE SCOTTISH THRONE”

M
arking the culmination of 
Henry VIII’s policy of ‘Rough 
Wooing’ of Mary to coerce her 
marriage to his son Edward, 
Pinkie Cleugh should be better 
remembered than it is. Even though Henry had 
died in January 1547, the policy was continued 
by Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, Lord 
Protector of the nine-year-old Edward VI. 
Invasion Forces
Somerset invaded Scotland in early 1547 with 
a large army of around 17,000 men, supported 
by a ﬂeet. He marched along the East coast 
of Scotland. To oppose this force the Earl 
of Arran raised an army consisting mainly of 
pikemen and archers. Sources list this army as 
22,000 strong although English sources claim 
it was as large as 36,000 men. Arran brought 
his army to the far bank of the Esk River at 
Musselburgh to bar Somerset’s advance. It 
was a strong position with no vulnerable ﬂank; 
it would need to be assaulted directly. 
Somerset’s army consisted of county levies 
who were either billmen or archers. He also 
had mercenary arquebusiers, an artillery train 
and 4,000 cavalry. Arran too had artillery 
although his was more difﬁcult to manoeuvre. 
He also had 2,000 cavalry, mainly made up of 
Border Reivers.
Somerset advanced and camped not far from 
the Scottish position. The day before the main 
battle, the cavalry were involved in a running 
skirmish and the Scottish cavalry were badly 
beaten and would take no part in the battle the 
following day. 
Battle is joined
Arran held a strong defensive position but his 
cavalry had been rendered ineffective and he was 
vulnerable to the artillery ﬁre of the English. What 
is more, the English ﬂeet anchored in the Firth of 
Forth was also in position to bombard his lines. 
The English could soften up the Scottish forces 
and assault them at their leisure. For these 
reasons, Arran decided to attack the English, 
using his pike formations as a shock weapon in 
three massive columns.
Arran charged his pike formations towards 
the English (who had chosen that moment 
to manoeuvre towards the right, thinking the 
Scottish would remain on the defensive). The 
Scottish formations took the disorganised 
English infantry formations by surprise. If this had 
been purely an infantry battle, Arran could have 
scored a remarkable victory. Two factors favoured 
the English: the ﬂeet and the cavalry. 
The bombardment of the eastern-most pike 
column decimated it and caused it to collide with 
its neighbour as they tried to avoid the naval

gunﬁre. The lightly armed highland archers were 
the worst affected. The two columns combined 
into one and pushed on. Somerset realised that 
he would have to use his cavalry to charge the 
pike formation. This was counter-intuitive as one 
of the pike formation’s main strengths was to 
be able to resist cavalry charges. It was also not 
what his cavalry expected to do and the horses 
were unprepared and unarmoured. 
Somerset, however, did not need his cavalry 
to break the Scottish ranks, but only to engage 
and delay them in order for his infantry, artillery 
and arquebusiers to have time to reorganise. The 
cavalry charged and fought savagely but were 
defeated and forced back, losing their standard 
in the process.
The decisive moment
The cavalry action was enough, however, to halt 
the advance of the Scottish pike formations 
and to provide time for the English infantry and 
artillery to get into position. They now ﬁred deadly 
volleys into the immobile and isolated pike 
formations who had little missile and artillery 
support left. The Scottish resolve evaporated 
and they threw down their pikes to ﬂee. 
The English cavalry, recovered from their 
mauling, pursued the ﬂeeing Scottish forces and 
cut them down without mercy. The English lost 
500 men that day; Scottish losses have been 
estimated as high as 10,000 but probably closer 
to 5,000 with 1,500 taken prisoner. Even though 
thousands of Scottish dead littered the ﬁeld, 
the princess Mary, the purpose of the whole 
expedition, escaped to France.

BATTLE

“THE SITUATION FOR MAURICE WAS NOW DIRE, AND THE 
ANNIHILATION HE HAD FEARED WAS A VERY REAL POSSIBILITY—
WITH HIS LINE OF RETREAT CUT OFF, THERE WOULD BE NO ESCAPE”
As military historians, we are all familiar with battle 
maps showing the dispositions and movements of 
troops in battle. Most of these, however, were written 
by historians who were not present but used the written 
sources, some of whom were not present themselves. 
Many such maps come from centuries later and may 
not be reliable at all. For Pinkie Cleugh, however, we are 
remarkably well informed of the battle (and the whole 
campaign) since the Duke of Somerset’s secretary, 
William Patten, accompanied the expedition and wrote 
an eyewitness account of the campaign, The Expedicione 
into Scotlande of Edward Duke of Somerset, and 
published it less than a year later. Patten’s account 
includes a map of the battle of Pinkie Cleugh and it is 
the earliest eye-witness battle map we possess. The 
map is both familiar and remarkable – it shows the 
troops’ dispositions, and the important aspects of the 
battle, the ﬂeet and the artillery as well as the camps of 
both armies and the decisive moments.

IN THE RANKS
Britain’s wars saw troop types from 
every walk of life involved, 
from heavily armoured knights 
to peasant infantry
20
Left: Reivers were fast, lightly armoured cavalry 
units often with opportunistic tendencies
Units of lowly peasant infantry were equipped with 
the long pike because of its effectiveness against 
cavalry, its relatively cheap cost, and training 
in its use could be quite simple (although some 
units could affect complex manoeuvres too). We 
are told the Scottish pikes at Flodden were ﬁve 
yards in length (4.5 metres). Units of pikemen 
could achieve victory against cavalry and other 
infantry formations (such as at the Battle of Sark 
in 1448) but the Scottish pikemen were decisively 
defeated and shown to be outdated by the English 
billmen at the Battle of Flodden in 1513.
BORDER REIVER
The devastation of the border regions between England and 
Scotland throughout the period saw the rise of groups of men 
who would plunder indiscriminately on both sides of the border. 
They reached as far as Edinburgh and Yorkshire. Whether as 
mercenaries or pressed into service the reivers, known as 
Steel Bonnets from their helmets, formed units of light 
cavalry in armies of the period. They were brilliant 
light cavalry and played an important part in the 
battles of Flodden and Salway Moss in 1542. 
They were also known as ‘prickers’ because 
they could attack with spears and then 
wheel and escape before they could be 
attacked themselves.
THE CONTENTIOUS BORDER BETWEEN 
ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND WAS RULED

SCOTTISH PIKEMAN
A 
great variety of troop types encompassed both sides 
of the conﬂict, including not only knights but lightly 
armoured mounted borderers, wealthy armoured 
infantry, peasant infantry and highlanders. These 
troop types used all manner of weaponry from pikes and bills to longbows 
and two-handed swords. During the period of the wars, warfare developed 
from ‘typical’ medieval battles into the age of gunpowder.

ANGLO-SCOTTISH WARS

From the late 15th century onwards, formations of English yeoman 
or peasant infantry were armed with the bill rather than the pike. 
Recruited from the lowest sections of society, they were usually armoured 
with a steel cap and a quilted jack or brigantine. The bill combined a 
curved blade with a spike on the tip and back of the blade. Although shorter 
than the pike they combined the qualities of both a spear and an axe and their 
formations were more manoeuvrable than pike blocks.
ENGLISH BILLMAN
Drawn from the men of each clan and led by their chieftain, the 
highlanders provided Scottish armies with infantry armed with 
studded targe shield and sword. Others would have wielded the 
two-handed claymore. They would charge enemy 
infantry formation and could be deadly when 
they closed with them. They wore bonnets 
with an eagle’s feather and belted plaid 
and usually had the white cross of St 
Andrew displayed prominently (as 
did all other Scottish infantry). 
The clans were mustered for 
their armies under the feudal 
obligations and maintained their 
ﬁerce ﬁghting style beyond the Anglo-
Scottish wars until it was wiped out in 
the 18th century.

WERE 
MUSTERED 
FOR THEIR 
ARMIES UNDER 
THE FEUDAL 
OBLIGATIONS”

and were notorious

ferocity and 
steadfast courage

W
hen we read of the 
formations of Scottish and 
English armies in the Anglo-
Scottish Wars, we read of 
the levies of the English 
being made of archers and billmen, whereas 
the levies on the Scottish side comprised 
archers and pikemen. The pike and the bill then 
were the deﬁning infantry weapons of the wars. 
The Battle of Flodden in 1513 is often 
described as the victory of the bill over the pike 
and yet the Scottish continued to use the pike 
(such as at Pinkie Cleugh in 1547) and, as an 
infantry weapon, pike formations remained at 
the cutting edge of infantry tactics and survived 
into the 18th century, long after the bill had 
ceased to be used on the battleﬁeld. This, of 
course, had to do with other factors such as 
the rise of infantry ﬁrearms and musketry, but 
the pike was considered essential long after its 
counterpart was rendered obsolete.
The pike
The long, spear-like, pike made an appearance 
in medieval armies from the early 14th century 
onwards, such as the schiltron of Scottish 
armies at Bannockburn in 1314 although its 
origins may stretch back to the Macedonian 
sarissa of Alexander the Great’s armies. 
Scottish pikes could reach 5 yards in length 
(4.5 metres) although others reportedly 
reached as much as 7.5 metres in length. They 
had a heavy wooden shaft (usually ash) and a 
bladed iron head. 
Pikes were designed for two-handed use, 
and infantrymen therefore needed a secondary 
weapon. The appeal of the pike was that they 
were relatively cheap to produce (certainly in 
relation to swords) and could be used with only 
rudimentary training by levies. A pike formation 
could present a mass of iron points towards the 
enemy since the pikes of several ranks could 
project beyond the ﬁrst rank of men. 
This made it ideal for stopping cavalry 
charges although such formations were 
vulnerable in the ﬂanks and were at a 
disadvantage in close combat. These 
weaknesses could be alleviated by combing 
pike formations with other units which offered 
them protection. The pike has been seen 
as primarily a defensive weapon although 
such units were capable of delivering shock 
charges, which were hard to stop. Complex 
manoeuvres could be achieved with pike 
formations although this required a great deal 
more training than available to peasant levies. 
The plight of the Scottish formations during the 
Anglo-Scottish wars revealed the shortcomings 
of pike formations. 
Famous units of pikemen existed such as 
the Swiss and the Landsknechts, and these 
were rightfully feared on the battleﬁelds of 
Europe. The Scottish armies of the period 
brought in French experts to train their men 
in the use of the pike. When the Scottish 
charged in three columns at Pinkie Cleugh, 
that manoeuvre was in emulation of the 
text books and famed Swiss tactics. Used 
correctly the pike provided a potent weapon 
on the battleﬁeld well into the era of ﬁrearms, 
offering protection to musketeers who, in turn, 
offered protection to the pikemen. The pike 
didn’t become truly obsolete until the advent of 
effective bayonets on muskets.
The bill
This English bill was similar to the halberd 
(and many similar weapons) although it had 
a curved blade. These two-handed weapons 
mounted an axe-bladed weapon and spike on 
a shaft, usually 5 to 6 feet in length. Originally 
developed from agricultural tools and designed 
to unhorse mounted opponents, these 
weapons predated the pike, although they went 
through a number of developments such as the 
lengthening of the spike to allow units to deal 
with pike-armed enemies. 
The English continued to use the bill and 
longbow long after continental armies adopted 
the pike, even into the age of the arquebus. 
Like the pike, both bill and halberd were cheap 
to produce and it was relatively easy to train 
men in their use. They also had a distinct 
advantage at close-quarters over the pike. 
Some units (such as Swiss mercenaries) which 
were originally armed with the halberd later 
adopted the pike in the 15th century. Halberds 
and bills remained in use for many centuries 
although they became a primarily symbol of 
status from the 17th century onwards. 
The victory of the English bill over the 
Scottish pike in the battles of the Anglo-
Scottish wars, especially at Flodden and Pinkie 
Cleugh were due to other factors than the 
superiority of the bill over the pike. The victories 
of the English in these battles may have led to 
their preferring the bill and longbow long after 
the rest of Europe had moved to ‘modern’ pike 
and ﬁrearms tactics.
We might consider that the victories of the 
English decided the matter, but which was 
the more effective weapon?

KINGS & WARLORDS

DAVID II
1324-71 SCOTLAND THE CAPTIVE 
GUARANTOR OF SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE
David’s reign fell in the shadow of his more 
famous father, Robert I ‘the Bruce’, the victor 
of Bannockburn. When Robert died in 1329 
Scotland’s independence had been recognised 
by England for just a year and David inherited 
the throne aged only ﬁve years old. The English 
acceptance of Scottish sovereignty was extremely 
reluctant and warfare raged during the 1330s 
while David was sent to France for his safety. 
David returned to Scotland in 1341 and led 
three raids into England to assert his authority 
against Edward III. As an ally of the French, David 
then invaded England in 1346 while Edward was 
campaigning in France. Many monastic lands were 
devastated until David was decisively defeated and 
captured at the Battle of Neville’s Cross.  
The king remained a prisoner in England for 11 
years but when he was released he ruled ﬁrmly in 
Scotland and managed to ensure that his realm 
remained a separate kingdom. 
  
JAMES DOUGLAS, 2ND EARL OF DOUGLAS
1358-88 SCOTLAND THE DETERMINED ENEMY OF THE ENGLISH 
“MANY MONASTIC LANDS WERE 
DEVASTATED UNTIL DAVID WAS 
DECISIVELY DEFEATED”
Douglas came from a ﬁghting family and was an active and powerful ﬁgure in Scottish politics. Unlike 
his king, Robert II, Douglas was keen for war with England and led a series of raids into English 
territory in 1384 and 1385, with French backing. 
The Scots again renewed the intermittent conﬂict with England in 1388 and 
Douglas played a leading role. This was not a national Scottish army but a force 
whose primary allegiance was to the powerful earl. Douglas raided as far south as 
Newcastle upon Tyne where he besieged the town for three days. In one skirmish 
during the siege Douglas’s men captured the pennon of Sir Henry ‘Hotspur’ 
Percy and this loss provoked Hotspur to pursue the withdrawing Scots. The ﬁnal 
clash came at the Battle of Otterburn where Douglas defeated an English night 
attack and Hotspur was captured. However, despite a famous victory Douglas 
had been killed in the ﬁghting.

SIR HENRY PERCY
1364-1403 ENGLAND THE LEGENDARY ‘HOTSPUR’ 
The Percy family were one of the most powerful 
Border warlord dynasties that often led the 
defence of northern England against the Scots. Sir 
Henry Percy was the eldest son of the ﬁrst earl of 
Northumberland and knighted by Edward III in 1377. 
During the 1380s Percy travelled far by ﬁrst ﬁghting 
in Ireland and then crusading in Prussia and Asia 
Minor but his reputation was earned ﬁghting on 
home territory along the Scottish border. 
The Scots nicknamed Percy ‘Hotspur’ as a 
tribute to his advancing speed and readiness to 
attack. Although he was captured and ransomed 
after the Battle of Otterburn, he was known 
as a powerful knight and played a crucial role 
in helping Henry IV usurp the English throne 
from Richard II. As an experienced Warden of 
the East March, Percy inﬂicted a crushing defeat 
on the Scots at the Battle of Homildon Hill. Percy 
subsequently rebelled against Henry IV when 
he felt that his family had not been adequately 
rewarded for their services. Percy was subsequently 
killed at the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403. 
RICHARD, DUKE OF GLOUCESTER
1452-85 ENGLAND THE FINAL CONQUEROR OF BERWICK-UPON-TWEED
Gloucester is better known to history as King Richard III, one of the most notorious monarchs in English 
history. As a military commander he is most famous for being decisively defeated and killed at the Battle of 
Bosworth in 1485, but before his controversial assumption of the crown he was a respected soldier whose 
greatest achievement permanently altered the Anglo-Scottish border. 
As the youngest brother of Edward IV, Gloucester had been a close military subordinate who had 
successfully fought in the Yorkist victories at Barnet and Tewkesbury against the House of Lancaster. At 
Tewkesbury Gloucester had led the vanguard and was both constable and admiral of England. When war 
broke out with Scotland in 1482 Gloucester led the campaign and advanced as far north as Edinburgh where 
he holed up King James III in the capital’s castle. Although he eventually withdrew from Scotland, Gloucester 
had captured the border town of Berwick-upon-Tweed and it became a permanently English town. This was 
highly signiﬁcant as Berwick had previously changed hands 13 times between England and Scotland. 
JAMES IV
1473-1513 SCOTLAND THE TRAGIC RENAISSANCE KING
James IV was one of Scotland’s most capable 
monarchs who brought the Renaissance to his 
small northern kingdom, but he was destined to 
become the most high proﬁle victim of the Anglo-
Scottish Wars. 
Spirited and courageous, James was also a 
highly educated man who could speak several 
languages. He introduced the printing press to 
Scotland in 1505 and was noted for expanding 
the Royal Scots Navy. James founded two royal 
dockyards, increased the size of the ﬂeet and 
EDWARD SEYMOUR, DUKE OF SOMERSET
c.1500-52 ENGLAND THE ‘ROUGH WOOER’ OF SCOTLAND
Seymour is an often forgotten but important 
ﬁgure in British history. As the Lord Protector of 
the boy-king Edward VI of England, Seymour was 
monarch in all but name and before and during his 
protectorate he had a signiﬁcant military impact on 
the Anglo-Scottish Wars. 
Born to an ancient Wiltshire noble 
family, Seymour was the brother of 
Jane who became the third and 
favourite wife of Henry VIII. Seymour 
immediately became a prominent 
courtier as the brother-in-law of Henry and 
uncle to Edward, Prince of Wales, and 
he was created as earl of Hertford in 
1537. He was then steadily given 
larger military appointments 
such as Warden of the Scottish 
following year to force not just the royal marriage 
but also a political union. The 1545 campaign was 
characterised by the punitive destruction of castles, 
monasteries and villages along the route to Kelso 
and Jedburgh but the Scots did not submit. 
Henry VIII died in January 1547 and Seymour 
was appointed duke of Somerset and lord protector 
to his nine-year-old nephew Edward VI. Seymour’s 
regency was initially extremely powerful and he 
even used the royal ‘we’ in reference to himself. 
Defeating Scotland became Seymour’s highest 
priority and he led a 19,000-strong army across 
the border. The Scots were heavily defeated at the 
Battle of Pinkie Cleugh on 10 September 1547 
and Seymour intended to garrison the country and 
introduce Protestantism. However, his ambitious 
plans were thwarted by French intervention and 
growing rebellions and political discontent in 
England. Seymour was eventually executed in 1549 
and his legacy in Scotland was nothing but debts 
and wanton destruction.

Left: Gloucester’s achievement in securing Berwick-upon-Tweed for England was generously rewarded with 
extensive grants of land in Cumberland and the hereditary wardenship of the English West March
Marches, lord high admiral and lieutenant general 
in the north. 
In 1543 Seymour came to prominence during 
a major war known as the ‘Rough Wooing’. The 
conﬂict arose from Henry VIII’s forceful attempt 
to marry the infant Mary, Queen of 
Scots, to his heir Edward. Seymour led 
an English army into Scotland to force 
terms. His forces pillaged Edinburgh for 
two days in 1544 and seized ships in Leith for 
plunder. The English achieved little apart from 
alienating the Scots but Seymour returned the 
cleared Scottish waters of pirates. One of his 
newly commissioned warships, the ‘Great Michael’, 
weighed 11,000 tonnes, was 240 feet in length and 
was the largest ship in Europe at that time.
Nevertheless, James was a rash general who 
led Scotland into a military disaster. In 1513 he 
commanded one of the largest Scottish forces ever 
to invade England but at the Battle of Flodden he 
made poor tactical and strategic decisions. The 
result was a disastrous defeat and around 10,000 
Scottish dead, including the king. 
James IV was the last Scottish monarch to speak 
Gaelic and an Englishman recorded his fatal 
courage at Flodden: “The battle was cruel, none 
spared other, and the king himself fought valiantly”

“THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT ALLOCATED A 
GENEROUS BUDGET AND ORDERED THE SAS TO 
FORM A COUNTER-TERRORIST TEAM AT THEIR BASE 
IN HEREFORD, UK. THE TEAM HAD TO BE READY TO 
MOVE ANYWHERE AT A MOMENT’S NOTICE – THEIR 
OPERATIONAL NAME WAS PAGODA”

On 30 April, 1980, six terrorists stormed 
the Iranian Embassy in London and took 23 
hostages. After days of negotiation, one SAS 
team was tasked with ending the siege. 
This is their story, as told by one of their number
I
n 1976, the Special Air Service (SAS) returned to 
the UK from a secret war in Oman. Their experience 
of ﬁghting an infantry war with artillery and air 
support was of very little use on the streets of 
Northern Ireland and they struggled to ﬁnd a new 
role for themselves. Flexible as always, they found their 
niche in a new ﬁeld of warfare – counter-terrorism. 
At the Munich Olympic Games in 1972, the Palestine 
Liberation Organisation (PLO) murdered 11 Israeli athletes 
and a police ofﬁcer during a botched rescue attempt. This 
tragedy exposed the need for an effective, highly trained 
force that would deal with incidents where hostages 
were held to ransom for political objectives. The British 
Government allocated a generous budget and ordered 
the SAS to form a counter-terrorist team at their base in 
Hereford, UK. The team had to be ready to move anywhere  
at a moment’s notice. Their operational name was ‘Pagoda’.
Between 1970 and 1980, terrorist groups such as West 
Germany’s Baader-Meinhof gang, the Irish Republican 
Army (IRA) and the PLO carried out successful and deadly 
operations. They drew media attention to their issues and 
committed atrocities, while often escaping unmolested. 
The most extreme example occurred on 4 November 1979, 
when Iranian Revolutionary Guards took over the United 
States Embassy in Tehran. Eighteen months later, on 24 
April 1980, President Jimmy Carter sent in US special 
forces to rescue the hostages who had been held for 444 
days. Operation ‘Eagle Claw’ failed, with the tragic loss  
of eight American lives. Following that disaster, the morale 
of the Western world plunged to an all-time low.
Encouraged by the perceived weakness of Western 
democracies, Iraq’s ruler Saddam Hussein looked for an 
opportunity to take advantage in his ongoing war with Iran. 
Sami Mohammed Ali, an ofﬁcer in the Iraqi Secret Service, 
spent the ﬁrst months of 1980 training a six-man team of 
young activists. They came from Arabistan, an oil-rich area 
in the south of Iran. The men wanted autonomy for their 
region following Ayatollah Khomeini’s Islamic Revolution. 
In response to Arabistani demands, the revolutionary 
government of Iran arrested and imprisoned 91 people 
without trial. Sami’s team planned to take over the Iranian 
Embassy at Princes Gate in London and hold the staff as 
hostages. They would demand the release of the Arabistani 
prisoners and draw international attention to their cause.

Sami told his group that other Arab countries 
supported their mission, while also assuring 
them that when their mission was over,  
Arab ambassadors would negotiate their  
safe return to Iraq. 
When Sami’s team arrived in London at  
the beginning of April, he provided them with 
semi-automatic pistols, automatic machine 
pistols and Russian-manufactured hand 
grenades. These were allegedly delivered  
to the UK in Iraqi diplomatic bags. The scene 
was set for yet another terrorist victory.
The siege begins
Sami Mohammed Ali deployed his team in 
London, at 11:30, on Wednesday 30 April, 
1980. He then took a taxi to Heathrow  
Airport to make his escape from the 
country. By pure coincidence, at 11:25, 
embassy staff invited their door guard, 
Police Constable Trevor Lock, to come inside for 
a cup of coffee. While he was inside, the six-man 
terrorist team entered the open door and shot 
a long burst of automatic ﬁre into the ceiling. 
Within minutes they had secured the four-storey, 
54-room building and had taken 23 hostages. 
These included 19 embassy staff, Trevor Lock, 
BBC sound recordist Sim Harris, BBC news 
producer Chris Cramer and Syrian journalist 
Mustapha Karkouti, who had all been inside 
applying for visas. 
The response by the Metropolitan Police, 
under the command of Deputy Assistant 
Commissioner John Dellow, was immediate and 
efﬁcient. The building was secured front and rear 
and all of the adjacent buildings were evacuated. 
Terrorist leader Salim immediately made 
demands for the release of the Arabastani 
prisoners and autonomy for his region. He 
gave a deadline of 24 hours, expiring at noon 
the next day, and threatened to kill all of the 
hostages if his demands were not met.
In Downing Street, Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher’s cabinet assembled at the cabinet 
ofﬁce brieﬁng room known as ‘Cobra’ to discuss 
their response. Thatcher was adamant that she 
would not give in to terrorists, but she would not 
authorise a military assault unless the terrorists 
killed a hostage. Until that happened, her policy 
was to contain the situation, remain calm  
and hope that the police could negotiate the 
release of the hostages and the surrender of  
the terrorists – without casualties.
In Hereford, the Pagoda team were preparing 
for a routine training exercise in Edinburgh with 
the Scottish police. The ﬁrst indication that 
something had changed was when the noon 
move to Scotland was postponed. 
“Big Bob smiled coldly. ‘My Tikka is ready,’ 
he said, closing one eye and squeezing an 
imaginary trigger. At about midday, Major  
[Gullen] called us into the team room… The 
exercise was off.”
 The team spent the following seven hours 
listening to the BBC news and hoping for 
permission to move.
By 19:00, no authorisation had been 
received from the government, so SAS Colonel 
Mike Rose took the initiative and moved his 
men closer to London. All their equipment was 
carried in six white Range Rovers, six Ford 
Transit vans and a large, yellow pan-technician 
truck. They left in small groups with orders 
to rendezvous at the Army Education Corps 
barracks in Beaconsﬁeld some 20 miles 
west of London. By midnight, the teams had 
successfully travelled the 120 miles when  
they were then ofﬁcially authorised to move  
to Regent’s Park Barracks in central London.

“HE GAVE A DEADLINE OF 24 
HOURS, EXPIRING AT NOON THE 
NEXT DAY, AND THREATENED TO 
KILL ALL OF THE HOSTAGES IF 
HIS DEMANDS WERE NOT MET”
Once ofﬁcially sanctioned, the mission was 
then given the code name: NIMROD.
Tension increased on the second day, when 
Iran refused to consider the terrorists’ demands 
and left all negotiations ﬁrmly in the hands of 
the British authorities. As the noon deadline 
approached, the police were left hoping for the 
best, while appeals and promises were made 
by negotiators in the hope of gaining more 
time. “The situation was close to panic,” said 
Sim Harris, “as the hostages believed that 
they were about to die.” Faisal, Salim’s second 
in command, was establishing himself as the 
tough guy. He repeatedly threatened to execute 
the hostages and was seen to pull and replace 
the pin of a hand grenade during moments of 
increased excitement.
While Faisal was establishing his credentials, 
Abbas Lavasani, the Iranian chargé d’affaires, 
was setting out his stall as a zealot. Lavasani 
made it clear that he wanted to be a martyr 
for his religion. Provocative and difﬁcult, he 
was only prevented from being shot in the ﬁrst 
few days of the siege by the intervention of 
Mustapha Karkouti.  
Chris Cramer began to feign illness as soon 
as the siege began, with a performance that 
was so desperate and convincing that he was 
released. Trevor Lock instructed Cramer to give 
as much information as possible to the police 
about the situation inside, including types and 
numbers of weapons and, most importantly, 
the number of terrorists. 
On the evening of day two, SAS troop 
commanders completed a reconnaissance of 
the embassy building and established a holding 
area for the team. The chosen area was only 
one door away from the embassy at numbers 
13-15 Princes Gate – the headquarters of The 
Royal College of General Practitioners. Major

OPERATION NIMROD
Hector Gullen, B Squadron’s commander, 
prepared his men to move at midnight hidden 
in the back of two pan-technician trucks. 
Between 01:00 and 02:00, B Squadron,  
with all of their equipment, moved silently  
into their holding area. The unit claimed 68 
men on the ground including support arms.
On day three, all phone lines to the 
embassy were cut and a ﬁeld phone was 
passed to the building. This move meant 
that Salim could only speak to the trained 
police negotiators and forced him to request 
essentials such as food via the police. By 
controlling his access to the outside world, 
the negotiators hoped to manipulate Salim.
Intelligence services attempted to 
place listening devices inside the 
walls and cavities of the embassy, 
but squeaky noises from hand-
operated drills were heard inside. 
Trevor Lock persuaded Salim that 
this noise was caused by mice, but the 
unconvinced Salim threatened to kill someone 
if the noise didn’t cease. In response to 
his threat, aircraft approaching Heathrow 
were directed to ﬂy over Knightsbridge and 
roadworks with drilling were started nearby. The 
noise was enough to hide the sounds of the 
drills, plus the movements of the SAS on the 
roof, searching for entry points and preparing 
belays for their abseil ropes.
While the SAS waited, half were on immediate 
standby, fully dressed except for their gas 
masks, while the remainder were stripped 
down to overalls so that they could rest. An 
‘Immediate Action Plan’ had been put in place 
as soon as the troops were on the ground.  
If the terrorists started to kill people then six 
eight-man teams would make an entry and 
clear their pre-designated areas, hoping to 
reduce the casualty list to a minimum. As time 
passed, information about the construction 
of the building and intelligence about the 
terrorists was collated so that a more precise 
‘Deliberate Action Plan’ could be developed.
By day four, the Deliberate Action Plan 
started to take form. Photos of the terrorists 
had been obtained from visa applications, 
Cramer had disclosed his information and 
the embassy janitor had identiﬁed armoured 
windows and doors. Blueprints of the building 
were secured from architectural records,  
which showed the exact layout of every room.
Salim used Trevor Lock, Sim Harris and 
Mustapha Karkouti as go-betweens and 
advisers, hoping for insights into the British 
psyche, while they in turn hoped to persuade 
the terrorists to give up. Under his heavy 
overcoat, Lock still had his .38 Smith and 
Wesson revolver with six rounds. Salim 
believed that all British police ofﬁcers 
were unarmed, so Lock had only received a 
rudimentary search during the takeover. The 
weapon weighed heavily on Lock’s mind as 
threats were repeatedly made to “kill a hostage”. 
Mustapha tried to convince Salim that 
surrender now would be a victory – no one 
had been injured and their cause had been 
brought to the world’s attention. Mustapha 
suggested asking for a radio announcement by 
the BBC. Salim still hoped for the intervention 
of Arab ambassadors but relented and asked 
the negotiators to make the suggested 
announcement. The negotiators used this 
moment to barter for the release of one 
hostage – Salim agreed and chose Mustapha. 
An announcement was made at 9pm 
on the BBC World Service. Mustapha was 
released and the terrorists were ecstatic. It 
seemed at this moment that the siege would 
end peacefully – the tension subsided and 
hopes were high. The departure of Mustapha, 
however, had taken an intelligent, mature 
and steady man who spoke Arabic out of 
the equation. When Faisal scribbled “Down 
with Khomeni” on a wall, no one with enough 
inﬂuence was there to stop Lavasani from 
overreacting. He provoked Faisal and brought 
the tension back to a fever pitch. Salim 
returned to his demands for an ambassador in 
the belief that Sami, his handler, had told him 
the truth. Sadly, Salim’s whole team had been 
set up by Iraqi intelligence. No agreements 
had been made and, even in the unlikely event 
that they had, they were denied. This created 
an impasse – there were no ambassadors and 
Salim thought the police were lying to him.
On Monday 5 May, at 11:00, Faisal took 
Lavasani down to the ground ﬂoor, away from the 
other hostages. He tied his hands and blindfolded 
him, then forced him to kneel. Outside the

At the time of the embassy siege, the 22nd Special Air Service 
Regiment was based at Bradbury Lines, Hereford. ‘The Regiment’ 
consisted of four regular Sabre Squadrons – A, B, D and G – all 
identical in makeup with a full complement of 70 men, including 
signallers and support staff. The squadrons rotated every six 
months, becoming the Pagoda team once every two years.  
At the start of April 1980, it was once again the turn of B Squadron, 
with most of the men were on their second or third Pagoda tour.
Training for the Pagoda team consisted of continuous practice 
assaults on buildings, aircraft, trains, ships in harbour and moving 
vehicles. The whole team were trained as assault troops, but half 
were also trained as snipers.

“WITH CONCENTRATED TRAINING AND ALMOST UNLIMITED 
AMMUNITION, THE MEN WERE EXPECTED TO HIT A FOUR-INCH 
CIRCLE IN A HUMAN HEAD FROM FIVE METRES WITHOUT AIMING”
Training took place day and night, ﬁve days a week. 
Repetition and practice were the key words. In a building 
known as ‘the killing house’, soldiers took it in turns to 
sit in chairs surrounded by targets as team members 
assaulted the room with live ammunition. Men stood in 
darkened rooms with their shoulders touching targets 
as comrades wearing gas masks turned, drew their 
weapons and ﬁred live rounds. With concentrated 
training and almost unlimited ammunition, the men 
were expected to hit a four-inch circle in a human head 
from ﬁve metres without aiming. Snipers were able to 
guarantee a head shot at ranges of up to 200 metres.

building, three pistol shots were heard. The SAS 
stood by once again for an immediate assault, 
but time passed and no indication was given 
about what the shots meant.
It was possible that a hostage had been 
killed. In preparation, Major Gullen briefed his 
men on his Deliberate Action Plan. Six teams 
of eight men would silently approach different 
entry points on the ﬁve ﬂoors, from basement 
to roof. Once in position, they would place 
specially shaped frame charges on the 
windows and doors. When all of the groups 
were ready, the command “GO-GO-GO”  
would be given and the assault would begin. 
The shaped charges would direct most of 
the explosive effect outwards, removing the 
entrances and minimising the risk to those 
inside. The groups would enter the building 
and clear their allocated areas – the mission 
was to rescue the hostages. The men were 
reminded about the laws of self-defence 
and what constituted a lawful killing. 
They had to believe that their lives, or 
the lives of those they were trying to 
protect, were in danger for the law 
to support them against charges of 
murder. The prime minister sent  
a message in which she said, “I don’t want  
any martyrs.” In other words – get it right!
At 06.50, Lavasani’s body was 
unceremoniously thrown out of the front door 
and quickly recovered by two plain-clothes 
police ofﬁcers carrying a stretcher. Lavasani’s 
body had two shots to the head and one to  
the chest – he had been executed. Salim made 
another deadline, which he now expected to be 
taken seriously. He wanted the ambassadors 
by 07:00 or he would kill another hostage.
Home Secretary William Whitelaw 
instructed Deputy Assistant Commissioner 
Peter Neivens to give written authority to  
the army to take control. When this note was 
signed at 07:07, it legally sanctioned military 
action and a building assault by the SAS. 
The negotiators played for time, telling Salim 
the ambassadors were on route and that they 
would all be driven to Heathrow as soon as the 
ambassadors arrived. Salim was suspicious, 
but he hesitated long enough for the SAS to get 
into position. At 07:23, Salim was on the phone 
to the senior police negotiator Detective Chief 
Inspector Max Vernon, who said that as  
he saw the SAS approach the building he heard 
a voice in his head singing, “You’re going to die, 
you’re going to die,” over and over and over.
At the rear of the building, the SAS team slid 
over the edge of the roof and began to abseil 
down towards the ﬁrst ﬂoor balcony. Around 
them, other teams approached the back door, 
the top ﬂoor ﬁre exits and the basement doors, 
while a ﬁnal group was approaching the front 
windows – all in full view of a hundred live 
television cameras.
“I crept quietly out of the back door 
of the college and across the concrete 
patio towards the rear door of the embassy. I 
looked ahead of me at Robert as he began to 
insert detonators into the explosives and place 
them on the back door. 
“Then I looked up. Above me, four men began 
to descend slowly from the roof on their abseil 
ropes. Behind me, Big Bob was wielding an 
eight-pound sledgehammer as back up, should 
it be needed to get through the door.
“I gripped my M-5 in both hands and 
thumbed the safety catch, assuring myself 
once again that it was off. The only sounds 
I could hear were the static hissing in my 
earpiece and the sound of my heart pounding 
in my ears. My greatest fear now was of making 
a mistake that might endanger life – especially 
mine. My mind raced. Watch the windows, 
Robin. What do I do if someone looks out now? 
Don’t rush. Is my pistol still in my holster? 
Where is my partner?
“The police dogs, which were being held back 
just inside the doors of the college, began to 
feel the tension in their handlers and started 
barking and howling. ‘Why don’t you shut the 
bastard dogs up?’ I thought. The fear that for 
so long had been my greatest enemy welled up 
inside me like a balloon, waiting to escape from 
my throat. Hello, I thought, I’m glad you’re here. 
Without you, I wouldn’t be functioning at my 
best. I needed to be scared to be alert.” 
At the rear of the building, an unexpected 
mistake occurred when one of the abseillers put 
his foot through a glass window. Salim heard 
the noise and left the telephone to investigate. 
Major Gullen, realising the game was up, gave 
the “GO-GO-GO” early. Troops exploded their 
frame charges, destroying the windows and 
doors. The team on the ground ﬂoor hadn’t

ﬁnished laying their charges and smashed the 
door in with a sledgehammer. Flash bangs were 
thrown inside closely followed by the troops.
Inside, on the ﬁrst ﬂoor, Trevor Lock grabbed 
Salim and drew his pistol. He later recalled the 
surprise in Salim’s eyes when he saw the gun 
that Lock had kept hidden for six days. The 
door burst open and Lock heard a voice telling 
him to move away. In seconds, Salim was dead. 
On the ﬁrst ﬂoor balcony, an abseiller was 
trapped on his rope above the balcony window.  
“I looked up as three bullet holes appeared 
in the window above my head. Dangling on his 
rope, about 12 feet above the balcony and 20 
feet from the ground, was one of the assault 
team. He was stuck. His rope jammed in the 
ﬁgure-of-eight abseil device attached to his 
harness. The curtains beneath him had been 
set on ﬁre by the grenades that had exploded 
when the ﬁrst group had entered. The ﬂames 
were climbing higher and higher and were now 
lapping against his legs. His screams of pain 
sounded over the radio.”
Beneath him, Sergeant Tommy Palmer had 
thrown his ﬂashbang inside and entered the 
building. The ﬂames set his head and gas 
mask alight and he was forced momentarily 
to retreat, but only long enough for him to 
discard the mask and enter the gas-ﬁlled 
building unprotected. He quickly identiﬁed two 
terrorists in the Telex room who had just shot 
and killed Ali Akbar Samadzadeh and wounded 
Ahmad Dadgar. Palmer identiﬁed a grenade and 
promptly killed them.
After entering from the front balcony, John 
McAleese and his group discovered two armed 
terrorists. John’s description of the event was 
simple and concise: “Bang, bang, job done.”
Only two terrorists remained alive. On the 
stairs leading down to the ground ﬂoor, the 
hostages were passed hand-to-hand towards 
the rear doors. Once on the grass at the rear of 
the building, they were all forced to the ground 
and handcuffed. This action controlled all the 
frightened participants and kept them safe 
from further harm.
Back inside, on the stairs, there was a 
scufﬂe – a voice shouted “Grenade!” – Faisal 
had placed himself among the hostages; as he 
reached the ground ﬂoor three men opened ﬁre. 
“Without hesitation I ﬁred one short burst  
of four rounds at his chest. Two other team 
members also opened ﬁre simultaneously. 
Faisal slumped to the ﬂoor with 27 holes 
in him. He didn’t spasm or spurt blood 
everywhere. He simply crumpled up like a 
bundle of rags and died.”
The grenade that he had previously used 
to threaten the hostages rolled from his dead 
hand. The pin was still inserted. The building 
burned ﬁercely as the last hostage departed 
and the remaining soldiers moved outside to 
assist at the hostage holding area. Handcuffed 
on the grass, Sim Harris nodded his head 
vigorously to his left to tell the soldiers that 
the man lying beside him was Fawzi Najad, 
the surviving terrorist. Najad was lifted up and 
moved away towards the building and placed a 
safe distance from the others.
Eleven minutes had passed from initiation  
to completion. During that time, two SAS 
soldiers were injured, one hostage was 
murdered, two were wounded by the terrorists 
and a further 17 hostages were rescued in 
good health. Five terrorists were lawfully killed 
by the SAS and one was captured.
The team quickly handed the situation over to 
the police and returned to their holding area to 
reorganise their equipment. A short time later 
the home secretary arrived to give his thanks. 
He was in tears and said, “I knew it would be 
good, but I never thought it would be this good.” 
Whitelaw had been given an estimate of up to 
20 per cent casualties by SAS Brigadier Peter 
de la Billière. One dead hostage was terribly 
sad, but it was a lot better than ﬁve. William 
Whitelaw wanted to parade the troops to the 
press, but he was politely informed by Major 
Gullen that they wished to remain anonymous.
While the world sat back in wild admiration, 
the SAS stacked their gear and crept into 
the back of their civilian trucks to withdraw 
to Regent’s Park Barracks. There they would 
recover their vehicles and return quickly to 
Hereford. They were still on call and needed to 
be ready – another attack could be waiting to 
happen anywhere, anytime.
At 21:00, while they stacked their kit in their 
vehicles, it was announced that the prime

minister would be visiting to congratulate “her 
boys”. She arrived, accompanied by her husband 
Denis, and personally thanked each man. She 
then joined them to watch a replay of the assault 
on the BBC News at 10. A famous anecdote 
still resounds in the bars of Hereford about 
this moment, when legendary Scotsman John 
McAleese said to the prime minister, “Hey hun, 
get yer f***ing head oot o the wee. I canna see 
the telly.” Some cringed, some laughed, but 
Maggie simply apologised and moved aside.
The team returned slowly in dribs and drabs 
to Hereford. One team arrived late following  
a puncture that drove them into the sanctuary 
of the Heston Service Station on the M4 
motorway. Unfortunately, the tools to change 
their wheel were hidden beneath all their  
guns and equipment. 
“As we were trying to work out what to do,  
I saw an AA van parked about 50 yards away.  
‘I know, I’ll get the AA to change it.’ I said.  
Before anyone could protest, I strolled over and 
asked the AA driver if he had heard about what 
had happened in London that day. He said that 
he had, becoming quite animated about the 
events. ‘Well I’m one of the blokes who did it,’  
I told him, ‘and I have a problem.’ I explained  
our predicament to him and, not sure whether  
to believe me or not, he drove over to take 
a look, probably as much out of curiosity as 
anything else. Confronted by four tired-looking 
heavies, and with the signal from our police 
radio bleeping in the front of the vehicle, he  
was convinced and changed the wheel for us.”
A week later, B Squadron received an 
engraved plaque from the Commander US 
Special Forces, Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The 
plaque read: “To the brave British commandos 
who assaulted the Iranian Embassy in London 
on 5 May 1980. It just goes to show you can’t 
make chicken salad out of chicken shit.”
The assault on the Iranian Embassy was a lift 
for the moral of the free world. A classic special-
forces operation. The foresight of the British 
Government to ﬁnance and support the Pagoda 
team was exceptional. The strong leadership 
and determination of Margaret Thatcher’s 
government ensured that the terrorists would 
never succeed. However, it was the training and 
calibre of the men that made it all possible.
Operation Nimrod ended the era of hostage 
taking in the UK for the next 20 years and, as 
the SAS taught their skills elsewhere, they gave 
the same deterrent to other countries. The 
combination of best man, best management 
and adequate ﬁnancial commitment made them 
the envy of the world. The SAS maintained 
their silence for 22 years until, in 2002, the 
BBC persuaded three of them to reveal the 
truth about those six days, in Louise Norman’s 
documentary, SAS: Iranian Embassy Siege.
The trauma of the events dramatically 
affected most of the hostages and negotiators. 
None of the SAS men, however, were 
psychologically injured by the events on that 
day. The surviving team members know that 
they still hold a special place in British history 
and are proud that they saved so many lives.
Fawzi Najad was sentenced to life 
imprisonment for murder and was released 
after serving 27 years. He now lives peacefully 
as a mini-cab driver in south London.

SIEGE OF

n the early hours of 1 September 1939, 
the German battleship Schleswig-
Holstein ﬁred the ﬁrst shot of World 
War II. The German campaign plan, 
Fall Weiss (Case White) swung into 
action and the world was introduced to a new 
form of warfare that would later be recalled as 
‘blitzkrieg’ (lightning war). 
Although debate continues over how 
meaningful the term is, and how deeply rooted in 
German planning it was, there can be no doubt 
that speed was the deﬁning characteristic of the 
invasion of Poland. On the seventh day of the 
campaign, German tanks were approaching the 
outskirts of Warsaw and the stage had been set 
for a brief yet brutal siege.
The seeds of World War II had been planted 
at the end of the Great War, with Germany 
particularly aggrieved by territorial losses to 
Poland, including the ‘Pomeranian corridor’, 
which split East Prussia from the rest of 
Germany, and the designation of the port of 
Danzig as a free city.
By 1939, Poland was counting on protection 
from France and Great Britain as Germany 
made increasingly bellicose attempts to regain 
its territory. An initiative to pull the Soviet 
Union into an anti-German alliance failed due 
to Polish misgivings over Russian intent and 
on 25 August 1939, the stunning Molotov-
Ribbentrop non-aggression pact placed 
Poland between two rapacious and suddenly 
cooperative powers.

POLAND 1 – 27 SEPTEMBER 1939
The invasion force
In 1939 German Army was not quite the smooth-
running machine it is usually characterised as 
being. As war approached only a fraction of the 
army had been mechanised and the bulk of it still 
relied on horses, bicycles and its own feet. 
By concentrating all of its mechanised 
and motorised divisions on Poland, however, 
Germany was able to create massive local 
superiority. An advantage in tanks of 2,511 
to 615 would no doubt have proved decisive 
enough, but the German campaign plan allowed 
them to enjoy a better than eight-to-one 
advantage at the points of attack.
The tanks involved were not the powerful 
behemoths of the later war years. Tanks 
were utilised in an anti-infantry role and the 
majority were Panzerkampfwagen types I and 
II, armed with machine guns or 20mm cannon 
respectively. There were less than 100 of the 
more powerful PzKpfw III, armed with a 37mm 
gun, while the 75mm-equipped PzKpfw IV was 
used as a ﬁre support platform.
The Germans also enjoyed a signiﬁcant 
advantage in artillery, with 5,805 guns to  
2,065 for the Poles.
What differentiated the German use of 
armour was its massing in panzer divisions 
(combined arms units with tanks as well as 
motorised artillery and infantry). The use of 
high-quality radios was of critical importance, 
as it allowed for a great ﬂexibility in movement 
and rapid responses to problems.
The Germans also enjoyed an advantage in 
manpower of at least 1.5:1, although in reality 
it was greater as Polish mobilisation was never 
really completed.

September 1939

GREAT BATTLES
The birth of ‘blitzkrieg’?
Germany wanted, and needed, a quick victory. 
With Britain and France declaring their support 
for Poland, the campaign would need to be 
fought and won before the western powers 
could react. German divisions could then 
be rushed westwards to face an anticipated 
French offensive.
Polish planning for the campaign took this 
into account. Believing they needed only to buy 
enough time for the French to mobilise and 
launch a massive offensive against Germany, 
their entire strategy was ﬂawed from the start. 
Compounding this ﬂaw was the fact that France 
believed Poland would be able to hold out for at 
least three months.
The Poles therefore called for an initial 
defence of their western territory, followed by 
a planned withdrawal to defensive positions 
along the Vistula River. Such a defence would 
not only signal that Poland was willing to ﬁght 
(and therefore worthy of its promised support 
from France and Britain), but also give time for 
mobilisation of its forces to be completed.
The German plan threw all of this into 
confusion. Whether or not there was a coherent 
acceptance of the concept of blitzkrieg (the 
term itself was almost certainly coined by a 
journalist, not a general), German commanders 
accepted the need to move quickly. This 
paramount objective would overwhelm Polish 
resistance in a matter of weeks.
Invasion
German forces aimed to converge on Warsaw 
from two directions. From the north, Army Group 
North, under Fedor von Bock, marched with 
15 divisions. From the south-west came Army 
Group South, 26 divisions strong, under Gerd 
von Rundstedt. With 630,000 and 886,000 men 
respectively, the two army groups signiﬁcantly 
outnumbered the Polish defenders.
Warsaw was a target from day one. The 
Luftwaffe was tasked with bombing the city, 
but weather conditions on 1 September were 
far from ideal and the spirited defence of the 
Brygada Poscigowa, the ‘Pursuit Brigade’, took 
the German airmen by surprise. The majority 
of Poland’s squadrons had been allocated to 
support its various ﬁeld armies, but the 54 
planes of the Pursuit Brigade, mostly obsolete 
PZL P.11 ﬁghters, downed 16 Luftwaffe aircraft 
on the ﬁrst day of the war.
Losses in the Polish Air Force were 
catastrophic, however, and against the vastly 
superior Messerschmitt Bf 109 and the newly 
introduced Bf 110, as well as defensive ﬁre 
from bombers, the PAF was to lose around 85 
per cent of its aircraft during the short war.
German propaganda insisted that the Polish 
planes had been destroyed on the ground in 
the ﬁrst two days of the ﬁghting, but in fact the 
Poles had wisely scattered their aircraft and 
only unserviceable wrecks had been caught on 
the ground at their main airﬁelds. Nevertheless, 
air defence quickly became limited to anti-
aircraft guns as the PAF was driven from the 
skies. The stage was set for the sinister Stuka 
dive-bomber to write itself into history.
Relatively slow (it would perform disastrously 
in the later Battle of Britain against Hurricanes 
and Spitﬁres), the 340 Stukas of the Luftwaffe 
revelled in the open skies above Poland, 
attacking lines of communication, trains, railway 
lines and other key tactical targets at will and 
becoming in many ways the symbol of blitzkrieg.
The German plan was not running as 
smoothly as their propaganda claimed, 
however. Coordination between the panzer and 
infantry divisions was patchy and the Poles 
were enjoying success with their 37mm anti-
tank weapons, even employing obsolescent 
armoured trains effectively. 
Polish cavalry was still useful due to its 
rapidity of movement, but it was never used in 
full-scale charges against panzers, as German 
propaganda claimed (a successful charge was 
mounted against an infantry unit, but was then 
repelled by advancing German tanks).
Warsaw under attack
Following the confusion of the early days of 
the war, the Germans began to make serious 
advances. Most worrying for the defending 
Poles was that they were unable to retreat 
as quickly as the Germans were advancing. 
Pressure on two Polish armies, Army Lodz 
and Army Prusy, resulted in a gap developing 
between them, wide enough for the Germans to 
race through. By the afternoon of 7 September, 
elements of 1st and 4th Panzer Divisions had 
reached Warsaw.
By now, Luftwaffe raids were having more 
of an effect, and the rubble of destroyed 
buildings dotted the landscape. Distressing 
though this was for the civilian population, 
it actually helped with the preparation of 
defences – the bombed-out buildings provided 
excellent cover for the placement of anti-tank 
guns and artillery pieces.
In addition to this, ditches were dug, rail lines 
ripped up and planted into the ground to form 
rudimentary tank traps, and barricades built. 
Tram cars were toppled over to block roads.
On 8 September, as the defenders waited, 
the rumbling sound of advancing tanks 
began to build as the ﬁrst units of 4th Panzer 
Division advanced cautiously into a hostile 
and unfamiliar environment. The tanks, mostly 
Type I and II panzers, were thinly armoured and 
unable to withstand anything more substantial 
than machine-gun ﬁre. The 37mm and 75mm 
shells ﬁred at them, often at point-blank range 
from behind the improvised defensive works 
on the streets of Warsaw, easily tore through 
the thin armour. Many of 4th Panzer Division’s 
tanks were destroyed in this way before the 
attack was called off. 
The Poles had served notice that they would 
not give up their city without a ﬁght, but how 
determined that ﬁght would be was up for debate. 
The evening before, the Polish commander, 
Edward Rydz-Smigly (who had defended Warsaw

from the Bolsheviks in 1920), had taken 
a fateful decision. Convinced that Warsaw 
was about to be surrounded by the rapidly 
advancing Germans, he ordered the bulk of 
the army command apparatus to relocate to 
Brzesc-nad-Bugiem (Brest-Litovsk). At the worst 
possible moment, with its armies reeling under 
the German onslaught, the Polish command 
structure disintegrated.
The tanks of 4th Panzer Division attacked 
again on 9 September, but were again repulsed. 
Polish defences had been strengthened 
overnight and the ‘Children of Warsaw Brigade’ 
had been recalled to the city, launching a series 
of small night-time raids to keep the Germans 
off balance.
The Polish counterattack
One area in which blitzkrieg left the Germans 
vulnerable was in their susceptibility to counter-
attacks on their exposed ﬂanks. As their 
divisions raced along as fast as they could, 
it was inevitable that some would become 
strung out, and with their focus on what was 
immediately in front of them, a force on their 
ﬂanks might be overlooked.
Just such a situation had arisen with Army 
Poznan. Bypassed by the advancing German 
armies as they had streamed past to the north 
and south, its commander, Tadeusz Kutrzeba, 
had begged for permission to hurl his fresh 
troops against the ﬂank of the advancing 
divisions. Repeatedly, Rydz-Smigly had 
refused but now, with the situation becoming 
desperate, he ﬁnally acquiesced. 
The German Eighth Army was the target, 
blissfully unaware of the danger as intelligence 
had mistakenly reported Army Poznan retreating 
to Warsaw. As evening approached on 9 
September, three Polish infantry divisions, 
ﬂanked by two cavalry brigades, attacked two 
German infantry divisions along the Bzura River. 
After 24 hours of ﬁghting, the Germans were 
forced to withdraw and around 1,500 men were 
taken prisoner.
It was a small victory, but it achieved its 
primary goal – that of buying time for the 
defences of Warsaw to be strengthened and 
for more units to make it safely back to the 
city. Epitomising this was the recall of 1st and

The good news for Warsaw was, of course, 
bad news for Army Poznan, which was quickly 
surrounded. Kutrzeba had hopes of ﬁghting 
his way through to the east, which would have 
allowed the army to reach Warsaw, but instead 
was forced to turn northwards in the face of 
overwhelming enemy forces.

The city is surrounded by 12 German 
divisions. On 25 September a huge artillery 
bombardment, along with bombing raids by 
1,200 Luftwaffe planes, rocks the city.

THE NORTHERN APPROACH
By 15 September the Germans are back, 
this time approaching the city from the north, 
along both banks of the Vistula River. The suburb of 
Praga, on the east bank, is the focus of the assault.

THE FLIGHT OF ARMY POZNAN
Having staged a brave but doomed counter-attack, 
the remnants of Army Poznan ﬁghts its way into Warsaw. 
The attack has bought precious days for the organisation of 
defences in the city, but the situation is increasingly desperate.

FALL OF THE FORTS
A string of obsolescent forts to 
the south of the city, which offer more 
comfort to the civilian population than 
concern for the Germans, are overwhelmed 
by infantry assaults on 26 September. The 
southern route into Warsaw lies open.

THE FINAL SURRENDER
With Hitler ordering that no civilians 
are to be allowed to leave the city, Polish 
commanders recognise the pointlessness 
of further resistance. On the evening of 26 
September talks open with the Germans and 
the city surrenders the following day.

THE LUFTWAFFE STRIKES
On the ﬁrst day of the war, the Luftwaffe bombs 
Warsaw, but determined defence from the two squadrons 
of the Polish ‘Pursuit Brigade’ (which shot down 42 German 
planes in the ﬁrst six days of the war), along with bad 
weather, limits the effectiveness of these initial air raids.
03 
THE PANZERS ARRIVE
On 7 September, German tanks arrive on the 
southwestern outskirts of the city. The following day 
they push into the suburbs at Ochota, but are repulsed 
by anti-tank and artillery ﬁre. The panzers are then 
withdrawn to help deal with a Polish counter-attack.

THE POLISH COMMAND 
WITHDRAWS
Fearing that an encirclement of Warsaw 
is inevitable, Polish commander Eduard 
Rydz-Smigly orders the removal of the 
Polish command headquarters, sparking 
a temporary panic in the city.
FORT MOKOTOWSKI
FORT SZCZESLIWICKI

The siege of Warsaw 
The Polish plan was still to hang on until 
help arrived from France, so keeping ﬁeld 
armies intact was of paramount importance. 
On the same day that Rydz-Smigly had shifted 
the Polish command centre from Warsaw, he 
had issued an ominous order – men within a 
certain age range were also to leave the city.
The inevitable conclusion was that Warsaw 
was being left to its fate, with manpower 
shifted further eastwards, out of reach of 
the advancing Germans. The order was so 
frightening, in fact, that it was ignored, with the 
general in charge of the defence of Warsaw, 
Walerian Czuma, agreeing with the mayor, 
Stefan Starzynski, that the men were needed 
to defend the city.
For the population, it was a terrifying time. 
There was no doubt that the war was going 
badly, even disastrously. Alexander Polonius, 
trapped in the suburbs of the city as the noose 
tightened, told later of the hopelessness 
experienced in the face of German military 
superiority: “At the beginning of the war,” he 
noted, on 8 September, “we were always trying 
to distinguish the colours and markings of the 
planes to see which were the enemy; but now 
few even took the trouble: whatever aeroplanes 
were heard we took it for granted that they  
were German.”
On the same day, Rydz-Smigly had issued an 
order that resistance was to continue. Posters 
appeared throughout the city, urging the 
citizens to arms (Do Broni) and declaring that it 
would be defended to the last man. Retreating 
units were ﬁnding their way into the city and 
there was little doubt that events were reaching 
their critical point.
The city was not yet surrounded, however. 
German forces were closing in from the north, 
but to the west, the Bzura counter-attack was 
44
– the French were not about to move quickly 
and the armies engaged in Poland were free 
to roam at will. Bock’s Army Group North was 
therefore able to move southwards on both 
sides of the Vistula, posing a much more 
serious threat to the Polish defensive positions. 
Third Army was in the vanguard as German 
units again pushed down towards Warsaw.
In the beleaguered city at the time was 
an American journalist, Julien H. Bryan, who 
remained to document the assault. Armed 
with a still camera and a Bell & Howell cine 
camera, he captured images of the city under 
the hammer of the German war machine. 
In particular, the incessant air attacks had 
become a monotonous terror. “By the 12th 
day,” Bryan reported in his documentary ﬁlm 
‘Siege’, “it was absurd even to sound alarms, 
for there was always an air raid.” Bryan’s ﬁlm, 
smuggled out after the city fell, gave a glimpse 
of the work undertaken to construct defences 
and the devastating effects of German 
incendiary bombs, which turned whole blocks 
into infernos.

On 16 September the Luftwaffe 
sent 820 planes against the trapped 
Poles in the ‘Bzura pocket’, who were 
also being pummelled by artillery ﬁre, 
while panzer forces closed in. The end 
was inevitable, and although some units did 
manage to break through a weak spot in the 
German cordon, Army Poznan was virtually 
annihilated. A staggering 120,000 men were 
taken prisoner.
It had been a brave diversion, but the inferior 
communications systems of the Poles had 
proved to be a major handicap. It had also 
only held up the German advance from one 
direction. Out of the north came the two armies 
of Army Group North, closing in once more on 
the ultimate goal of Warsaw.
The city
Warsaw was a city of 1.3 million inhabitants, 
including the largest Jewish population outside 
New York – 350,000 Jews called Warsaw 
home, and most were to suffer a horrendous 
fate in the years that followed the German 
capture of the city.
Ironically, the belief that France would 
quickly launch an offensive on the opening of 
the war had not only misled the Poles, it had 
also hampered German planning. Unwilling to 
have its forces committed too far to the east 
in case they needed to respond quickly to a 
French attack, German commanders had been 
tentative about crossing the Vistula River. By 
the middle of September, reality was dawning 
“350,000 JEWS CALLED WARSAW HOME, AND MOST WERE TO 
SUFFER A HORRENDOUS FATE IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED THE 
GERMAN CAPTURE OF THE CITY”

still tying up Rundstedt’s armies. To the south, 
there was hope in the form of four fortiﬁcations, 
Forts Szczesliwicki, Mokotowski, Dabrowski 
and Czerniakowski. The forts were old, though, 
and Mokotowski had been partially dismantled 
in preparation for being converted to a storage 
facility. They were a comforting presence for the 
civilian population, but they could not hope to 
hold back modern German forces for long.
Keeping the civilian population under control 
was becoming increasingly difﬁcult as the 
nightmarish reality of a siege began to sink in. 
Polonius wrote of bakeries being broken into 
by hungry mobs, while Bryan, the American 
journalist stuck in the city, ﬁlmed the bodies 
of women machine-gunned by German planes 
while foraging for potatoes. “Sleeping is a 
peace-time prejudice,” Polonius wrote in his 
diary on 10 September. “I spent the night in 
hearing the stunning din of heavy vehicles on 
the road, as the rows of lorries and armoured 
cars passed through the village.” Later he 
would write of the terror as his house was 
bombed and strafed.
By 19 September, the city was ﬂooded 
with refugees, begging in the streets and 
being directed to aid stations which were, in 
Polonius’s words, “sheer mockery. There is 
invariably an enormous queue, but no food or 
drink.” The stench of rotting corpses began to 
ﬁll the air.
The fall
Fittingly enough, in what Polonius described 
as “this speediest of all wars”, the end for 
Warsaw came quickly. As the Bzura counter-
attack ﬁzzled out, German forces completed 
the encirclement of the city by 21 September, 
committing 12 divisions to the task.
The short, sharp lessons learned by the panzer 
forces in the earlier street ﬁghting, had helped 
persuade the German command that the capture 
of the city would be best left in the hands of the 
artillery and Luftwaffe. A thousand guns were 
amassed around Warsaw to pummel the city, 
while the air force continued its air raids. 
On 23 September, a major assault was 
beaten back by the desperate Polish defenders, 
but two days later resistance appeared futile 
in the face of a huge artillery bombardment, 
accompanied by bombing raids featuring 1,200 
planes. Warsaw disappeared under a pall of 
smoke, which actually made it difﬁcult for 
Luftwaffe planes to spot their targets, resulting 
in numerous ‘friendly ﬁre’ casualties among 
German ground units.
The forts to the south of the city fell the next 
day, after determined infantry assaults. Fort 
Mokotowski, home to the Polish Broadcasting 
Station, had kept transmitting up to the 25th 
despite being repeatedly targeted from above 
by German bombers.
Resistance was still an option, as fresh 
reserves of ammunition had been transported 
into the city via locomotive, but the cost was 
becoming too high.
“I feel that I am growing abnormal,” Polonius 
wrote as the siege neared its inevitable 
conclusion. “When the guns are ﬁring I feel 
quite assured and light of heart, but I am afraid 
of the silence.” Polish troops had arrived at his 
house on the 26th, setting up a new defensive 
perimeter as the Germans closed in, but the 
following day the soldiers were just as suddenly 
withdrawn. The city had surrendered.

The aftermath
As many as 40,000 civilians had died during the 
savage siege of Warsaw. Following its capture, 
the Jewish population was to suffer most at the 
hands of the German occupiers, ﬁrst forced to 
live in a cramped ghetto (where an estimated 
83,000 would die of disease and starvation) 
and later transported to death camps for more 
organised extermination.
Warsaw’s capture had never been in doubt 
from the moment it was ﬁxed as the target of the 
German offensive, and events elsewhere had 
ensured a similar fate for the entire country. 
The Ribbentrop-Molotov pact, signed just before 
the opening of the war, had called for the partition 
of Poland between Germany and the Soviet Union. 
As Poland hung grimly on, waiting for the promised 
assistance from its allies in the west, Russian 
forces massed along its eastern border.
This army was far inferior to the one that had 
rolled over Poland’s western borders just a few 
weeks earlier. The Soviet army was badly led and 
organised, but it did not need to do much more 
than occupy the territory allotted to it under 
the secret terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop 
pact – Poland had shifted almost all its forces 
to the west to face the Germans. The two great 
armies, unaware that they would shortly be 
pitted against each other, calmly divided Poland 
between themselves. 
The cost of defeat for Warsaw was immense. 
At the end of the war, when Soviet forces 
‘liberated’ the city, they would ﬁnd a population 
of just 174,000.

I
t is a beautiful summer’s day in August 
1944 and six ships of the Royal Navy 
are sweeping the area near Le Havre 
for mines. Despite the dangerous task 
the warm weather is a welcome relief 
for the recent veterans of the notoriously cold 
Arctic Convoys. Some are so relaxed that they 
sunbathe on deck, but a formation of aircraft 
appears out of the sun and suddenly dives 
towards the ﬂotilla. 
This would be an alarming situation if it were 
the enemy, but the sailors are more alarmed 
to see that these are Hawker Typhoons of the 
Royal Air Force and without warning the ﬁghter-
bombers attack their own ships. Explosions 
erupt everywhere and vessels begin to sink. 
Many men have to abandon ship but to make 
matters worse German shore batteries open 
ﬁre and kill vulnerable sailors in the water. By 
the time the Typhoons leave two ships have 
been sunk and hundreds of men are either 
dead or wounded. 
One of the casualties is a young British 
stoker aboard HMS Jason called Claude Sealey.  
Although he became covered in shrapnel 
wounds Sealey survived to recall his horriﬁc 
experiences at the hands of his allies.
Powering a minesweeper
Born in 1923 the teenage Sealey was keen to 
serve in the Royal Navy, “I joined in September 
1940 when I was 17 years old. I got a shore job 
because I was underage and I ran away from 
home to join up. My sister was at the barracks 
gate crying and I was given the choice to either 
go home or stay but I decided to stay. Of course 
I wish I hadn’t that day when I saw her crying.”
When Sealey turned 18 he was transferred 
to general naval service and introduced to the 
ship that he would serve on until 1945. “I went 
in for a stokers course up at Skegness and as 
soon as I came back down to Portsmouth I was 
drafted onto the minesweeper HMS Jason at 
Christmas 1942. The ship was at Leith docks 
near Edinburgh and I was a lone draft – I was 
on my own. I got the train from Portsmouth right 
up to Scotland and picked the ship up. HMS 
Jason was my only ship for the entire war.”
As a stoker, Sealey worked in the bowels 
of the ship to keep it constantly on the move. 
He recalls that discipline was strict: “In the 
boiler room you had a petty ofﬁcer and me as 
a stoker. There were six burners and if they 
signalled from the bridge or engine room that 
they wanted more speed then you’d put more 
burners on to create steam. When the sirens 
alarmed that we were being attacked I was 
always ordered to check the smoke glass. I 
had to go up a ladder and right across the back 
of the boiler to see if it was all clear because 
we weren’t allowed to make smoke. The petty 
ofﬁcer would wait at the bottom of the ladder 
so I couldn’t get out – he wasn’t a nice man.”
Sealey’s duties were split between the boiler 
and engine rooms. “There were two boiler 
rooms mid-ship and the engine room was in 
the stern where the turbines were stored that 
powered the propellers. There was a head and 
a stern turbine with a walkway towards port and 
starboard. At the end was a vat that was used 
for making fresh, clean water that was mainly 
for the boilers.” 
In the engine room Sealey was responsible 
for an important part of the ship’s capabilities. 
“I liked being in the engine room because an 
artiﬁcer and myself would take the throttles. 
This meant we were in charge of the ship’s 
speed. The bridge used to signal down how 
many revs they wanted and we’d open up the 
steam for the appropriate speed.”  
Conditions were hazardous in the lower 
parts of the ship and if it were attacked Sealey 
would have been in great danger, but he had 
little time to feel worried. “I felt vulnerable in 
the boiler room and not so much in the engine 
room but most of the time I didn’t think about it 
much because we were all busy. We just had to 
adapt and get on with it.”
Clearing the way on D-Day
Sealey’s ﬁrst active service was on an Arctic 
Convoy to Russia in August 1943 where he 
sailed to Polyarny, Murmansk and Archangel 
as part of the Allied attempt to supply the 
Soviet Union with arms and equipment. He 
experienced vicious storms, German U-boat 
and air attacks as well as witnessing Russian 
brutality against their own people. 
By the time Sealey returned to warmer waters 
the journey had made him an experienced, if 
weary, seaman. “On the way down from Scapa 
Flow there was a U-boat off the Irish coast 
“THE SAILORS ARE MORE ALARMED

because they used to hang about over there. 
We got the alarm and I remember there was 
an acting petty ofﬁcer who went down on his 
knees and prayed, ‘Please, we’ve got back this 
far, don’t get us now!’ Everybody was terriﬁed. 
Luckily it didn’t come to anything and we got 
back to Portsmouth. After that we did a workout 
for D-Day.”
Sealey was now a leading stoker on HMS 
Jason and as a minesweeper the ship would 
be one of the ﬁrst vessels to sail on 6 June 
but Sealey almost missed his chance to take 
part in the event that changed the war: “Just 
before D-Day you couldn’t see the Isle of Wight 
for ships and we were anchored over there. 
The skipper gave us leave to be back the next 
day. There were three of us and we missed 
the liberty boat to take us back. I was terriﬁed 
and I rang Portsmouth barracks, reported to 
the ofﬁcer on the watch immediately and he 
gave me a letter so we didn’t miss the next day 
because that was the start of D-Day.”
On 6 June 1944, HMS Jason sailed from 
England as part of 1st Minesweeping Flotilla 
(1st MSF). The minesweepers’ responsibility 
was to lead the assault forces onto the 
Normandy beaches and clear the German 
mineﬁeld that protected the area. Ofﬁcially 
codenamed ‘Operation Neptune’, the work of 
the minesweepers was an essential part of 
the beach landing process. German mineﬁelds 
were laid in depth within ten miles of the French 
coastline and the ﬂotilla had to sweep ten 
‘channels’ to the beach assault areas for the 
troops to get through.
HMS Jason was one of 350 different vessels 
to participate in the mine-clearing operation 
and her orders were to clear ‘Channel 9’ of the 
approach route to Sword Beach for Allied troops 
to land. Consequently, the minesweeping 
ﬂotillas led the way for the assault forces as 
Sealey recalls: “We took off on 6 June, more or 
less as dawn was breaking and we swept the 
mines. There were a lot of them and we had 
trawlers that went around shooting them up 
and exploding them.”
France eventually came into view and HMS 
Jason got so close that Sealey could see 
individual landmarks. “As we got nearer to the 
French coast I could see this clock tower at 
Arromanches. I couldn’t see the time on it but I 
could see the tower. We went in as close as we 
dared and then turned to sweep mines again. 
Then all the big ships came in and started 
hammering the coast.” 
Sealey was aware that he was in the 
vanguard of the Allied invasion but at the time 
he found it difﬁcult to absorb the signiﬁcance of 
the moment. “We were right in the forefront of 
the invasion but we were so busy doing things 
that you didn’t think about what was happening. 
The funny thing is when you’re in with a lot of 
men together you’ve got that comradeship and 
you don’t think about yourself.”
The planning of Operation Neptune had been 
meticulous and because of the courageous 
work of the minesweepers relatively few 
warships, transport or landing craft were 
seriously damaged or lost to the mines. All 350 
vessels survived by the end of 6 June, making 
Neptune the most well-executed minesweeping 
operation ever undertaken. The American 
naval commander of the Western Task Force 
Rear Admiral Alan Kirk praised all the Allied 
minesweepers: “It can be said without fear 
of contradiction that minesweeping was the 
keystone in the arch of this operation. All of the 
waters were suitable for mining, and plans of 
unprecedented complexity were required. The 
performance of the minesweepers can only be 
described as magniﬁcent.” 
Nevertheless, HMS Jason’s work was 
not over. Sword Beach was on the eastern 
ﬂank of the Allied assault zone and therefore 
particularly vulnerable to attack from the Le 
Havre area. However, Sealey could not have 
foreseen that the most deadly problem would 
emerge from his own side.
Securing the invasion channels
After D-Day Sealey continued performing 
minesweeping duties and almost had an 
unfortunate incident with part of the invasion 
force. “We kept sweeping mines in the English 
Channel for a long time and then we had a 
mishap with one of the landing craft, which was 
coming across with some tanks and we went 
smack straight into her side!”
Shortly afterwards HMS Jason was deployed 
to the area off Le Havre in late August 1944, 
11 weeks after D-Day. By now, Allied armies 
had advanced well inland but the Germans 
Rear Admiral Alan Kirk 
of the US Navy later 
praised the work of all 
Allied minesweepers on 
D-Day as “magniﬁcent”
“THE PLANNING OF OPERATION NEPTUNE HAD BEEN METICULOUS 
AND BECAUSE OF THE COURAGEOUS WORK OF THE MINESWEEPERS, 
RELATIVELY FEW WARSHIPS, TRANSPORT OR LANDING CRAFT 
WERE SERIOUSLY DAMAGED OR LOST TO THE MINES”

HALCYON-CLASS MINESWEEPERS
CLAUDE SEALEY’S SHIP HMS JASON WAS PART OF AN IMPORTANT BUT UNDERAPPRECIATED 
GROUP OF NAVAL VESSELS THAT CLEARED MINES FROM THE HOSTILE WATERS OF WWII
Between 1934-39 the Royal Navy commissioned 
21 oil-ﬁred minesweepers that became 
designated as Halcyon-class ships. The navy 
had ﬁrst deployed improvised minesweepers 
during the Crimean War but the technology 
developed rapidly during WWI when Flower-class 
minesweeping sloops were introduced. 
By the 1930s the Halcyon-class minesweeper 
was being developed. These vessels had a weight 
displacement that was 175 tonnes less than their 
Grimsby-class sloop counterparts as well as being 
20 feet shorter. Because of the nature of their 
work, the minesweepers needed to be both small 
HMS Halcyon was 
the ﬁrst in her class 
of minesweepers. 
Commissioned in 1934, 
the ship saw action 
at Dunkirk, the Arctic 
Convoys and D-Day
HMS Jason in 1941. Sealey 
served on this Halcyon-class 
minesweeper from 1942-45
in size and have as shallow a draught as possible. 
Consequently, to save weight the ships were only 
provided with the most basic armament including 
small numbers naval or anti-aircraft guns, machine 
guns and depth charges. 
To compensate for the relative lack of weapons 
the minesweepers relied on cover from other 
warships or aircraft for protection. So long as there 
was adequate cover Halcyon-class ships still had to 
continue sweeping for as long as possible even when 
under attack. 
The minesweepers had various deployments 
during WWII including the Atlantic and Arctic oceans, 
the North and Mediterranean seas and home waters. 
Among other actions, Halcyons rescued 14,000 
soldiers from Dunkirk and took part in 78 crossings 
during the Arctic Convoys. By May 1945 nine ships 
had been lost and 578 crew members were killed. 
At the end of the war Winston Churchill recognised 
the minesweepers service with an ofﬁcial statement: 
“The work you do is hard and dangerous. You rarely 
get and never seek publicity; your only concern is to 
do your job, and you have done it nobly. No work has 
been more vital than yours; no work has been better 
done. The ports have been kept open and Britain 
breathed. The nation is once again proud of you.” 
An underwater mine explodes during WWII. The 
role of minesweepers such as HMS Jason were 
essential in reducing the destructive threat of 
German mines on Allied shipping

still held the important port of Le Havre, which 
had heavy shore batteries that continually 
threatened shipping. The Germans also had 
E-boats, midget submarines and explosive 
motorboats at their disposal that could inﬂict 
night attacks at Arromanches where Sealey 
had been sweeping weeks earlier. Despite the 
elapsed time HMS Jason still operated out of 
Arromanches and anchored in the ‘Trout Line’, 
which was a defensive perimeter of warships 
formed around merchant shipping. 
1st MSF consisted of Halcyon-class 
minesweepers that included HMS Harrier, 
Britomart, Hussar, Salamander, Gleaner and 
Jason. Their main task was to clear mines from 
the area between Portsmouth and Arromanches 
at night but on 22 August 1944 their orders 
were changed. The ﬂotilla was now required to 
clear a German ﬁeld of magnetic mines off Le 
Havre, which would enable Royal Navy warships 
to bombard the port and assist the advancing 
Canadian Army. 
Between 22-25 August the ﬂotilla swept 
the mineﬁeld that was about ﬁve miles off 
the French coast between Fécamp and Cap 
d’Antifer before HMS Gleaner and HMS Harrier 
left for repairs. With a reduced number of 
ships the ﬂotilla was expected stay in dock 
at Arromanches but after 24 hours’ rest the 
remaining vessels were ordered to return 
to minesweeping duties. One of Sealey’s 
superiors aboard HMS Jason was the ﬂotilla’s 
navigating ofﬁcer Lieutenant H. G. S. Brownbill 
who later recalled that the redeployment order 
was not unusual. “We knew full well that the 
clearance and search of the area off Le Havre 
had not been completed, and we also knew  
that clearance was also needed to permit a 
heavy force to the area to bombard the Le 
Havre coastal region. I was promised that 
the orders would be amended to allow the 
1st MSF to complete its unﬁnished search 
and clearance. Happy that all was at hand, I 
returned to Jason.” 
After these arrangements were made 
signals of the amended order should have 
been circulated to other service commands. 
All services had to be given advance notice of 
movements at sea by Allied ships so that every 
activity could be accounted for. If all commands 
were well-informed then RAF aircraft based 
on landing strips in Normandy could intercept 
enemy vessels. Unfortunately, this normally 
smooth system of operations would not go to 
plan for the remaining ships of 1st MSF.
‘Friendly’ ﬁre
On 27 August 1944 HMS Jason set off with 
her fellow minesweepers HMS Britomart, 
Salamander and Hussar along with the 
supporting trawlers HMS Lord Ashﬁeld and 
Colsay. Sealey recalls that the weather was 
ﬁne. “We got orders to go off the French coast 
at Le Havre because the Jerries still held that 
part of France on the Seine. We were out there 
sweeping in beautiful hot weather in August.”
HMS Jason was guiding the ﬂotilla and 
ﬂanked by the Britomart and Salamander 
on either side. HMS Hussar was following 
behind while the two trawlers were laying buoy 
lines in the rear. At 1.30pm Sealey recalled 
seeing RAF aircraft appear but in unfavourable 
circumstances. “These aeroplanes came over 
and buzzed us a couple of times and we knew 
they were ours. However before we knew what 
was happening they came back around and 
sunk two of our ships and blew one in half!” 
The aircraft in question were 16 rocket-ﬁring 
Hawker Typhoon ﬁghter-bombers from 263 and 
266 (Rhodesia) Squadrons and 12 supporting 
Supermarine Spitﬁres from a Polish squadron. 
HMS Jason immediately ﬁred her anti-aircraft 
guns before signalling at 1.32pm and 1.34pm, 
“Am being attacked by friendly aircraft.” At the 
same time the other ships were also under 
attack, particularly the Britomart, Salamander 
and Hussar. The ships burst into ﬂames with 
the Britomart listing to port while the Typhoons 
swept around for another attack. 
HMS Jason was raked by aircraft cannon 
ﬁre that disabled the anti-aircraft guns and 
cut the steam pipe that made a loud shrieking 
noise. At 1.37pm the Jason signalled, “Three 
ships hit and in danger of sinking,” while the 
Britomart continued to sink and HMS Hussar 
and Salamander burned heavily. 
Sealey became one of the many casualties 
during the attack. “I got wounded. We were 
attacked by RAF Typhoons ﬁring rockets but 
what hit me was ordinary cannon ﬁre. I was part 
of a watch party that was aft of starboard. It

INCIDENTS OF WWII
THE DESTRUCTIVE POWER OF THE WEAPONS USED BETWEEN 1939-45 INCREASED 
THE CHANCES OF DEVASTATING FRIENDLY FIRE ATTACKS
The friendly ﬁre attack on 1st Minesweeping 
Flotilla off Le Havre was sadly not a unique case 
during WWII and blue-on-blue incidents occurred 
everywhere on land, sea and in the air.
Despite the meticulous planning, accidents 
were strikingly prevalent around the time of the 
D-Day landings. During a simulated exercise on 
28 April 1944 eight LSTs (Landing Ship, Tank) 
were practising landing troops into Lyme Bay, 
“THE THREE SHIPS WERE FILLED WITH THOUSANDS OF ALLIED 
POWS AND PRISONERS FROM NAZI CONCENTRATION CAMPS 
BUT THE RAF DID NOT KNOW THIS AND ATTACKED WITH 
BOMBS, ROCKETS AND CANNON FIRE”
England, when nine German E-boats attacked 
the transports leaving more than 600 Americans 
dead. To make matters worse, in the confusion 
a British cruiser then shelled the landing troops 
with live ammunition that resulted in another 308 
Americans being killed. 
As part of the Normandy breakout in July 
1944 Allied aircraft accidentally bombed 
American positions. The incident was due to 
miscommunications over poor weather conditions 
but the result was 136 American soldiers killed. 
However, worse was to come on 3 May 1945 
(ﬁve days before VE Day) when RAF Hawker 
Typhoons attacked German transport ships SS 
Cap Arcona, Deutschland and Thielbek in the 
Bay of Lübeck. The three ships were ﬁlled with 
thousands of Allied POWs and prisoners from Nazi 
concentration camps but the RAF did not know this 
and attacked with bombs, rockets and cannon ﬁre. 
The Cap Arcona and Thielbek were both sunk and 
at least 7,000 people were killed with only around 
400 survivors. The incident has since become 
known as the deadliest case of friendly ﬁre during 
the war and possibly in history.

was just outside the wardroom where there was 
a ladder that went up to the boat deck. During 
the bombing the area where we were suddenly 
became full of blue sparks ﬂashing and I was 
bowled over on the boat deck. I ended up lying 
on the deck and when I got up there was blood 
everywhere and that was it. I wasn’t wounded 
badly but I was put in the wardroom with the 
other wounded. I had bits of shrapnel in my 
right foot, back and three or four pieces in my 
hip. I had those pieces for ages.” 
After a ﬁnal attack at 1.40pm the aeroplanes 
ﬂew away. The attack had only lasted around 
10 minutes but the RAF left behind burning, 
sinking ships and a sea that was strewn with 
debris and struggling survivors. Tragically, the 
ordeal was not over as Sealey explains: “HMS 
Britomart copped it and she went straight down 
and then HMS Hussar also went down. HMS 
Salamander was blown in half and my ship 
HMS Jason also got hit. At the same the Jerries 
ﬁred from their shore batteries and there were 
all these survivors in the water and their heads 
were being blown off. It was so terrible.”
Despite her own considerable damage HMS 
Jason had taken the lead in rescuing survivors 
from the stricken Salamander and Hussar. 
During the evacuation from the Hussar, Jason’s 
crew put down scrambling nets and rescued 
over a dozen survivors when the German shore 
batteries opened ﬁre. One shell landed 100 
yards from the Jason and forced her to retire 
with sailors still in the water. The ship then laid 
smoke screens to provide cover while it towed 
the Salamander back to Arromanches. 
After returning to Arromanches the Jason 
moved on to evacuate the wounded, including 
Sealey, in what turned out to be a personal 
blessing in disguise. “HMS Jason had quite a 
few holes in her but our skipper steamed us 
into Cherbourg and there was a hospital ship 
ready for us for the wounded including myself. 
We came back over to Portsmouth but instead 
of being sent to the local naval hospital I was 
put on an army train to Basingstoke initially and 
then on to Sedgeﬁeld, County Durham, where I 
met my wife who was a nurse.”
The cover-up
The RAF attack on the 1st MSF had caused 
enormous damage. HMS Britomart and Hussar 
had been sunk while HMS Salamander was so 
badly damaged that she had to be scrapped. 
There was also heavy damage and casualties 
on other ships and in total 117 sailors were 
killed with a further 147-153 wounded. It was the 
largest single naval loss of Operation Overlord 
that was not the result of German action. 
Sealey contends that his attackers knew the 
ships’ identity but had to proceed because of 
pressure from the admiralty. “The planes knew 
who we were after ﬂying around two or three 
times but whoever was ashore in France – an 
admiral apparently – said that shipping should 
not be in that area and that they had to get on 
and do it. In those days you’d sometimes get a 
ship with a British ﬂag up and it would turn out 
to be German so the planes were given strict 
orders to sink whatever was there but they 
knew we were British.”
The tragic incident had occurred because 
of poor communication. Naval ofﬁcers had 
signalled orders for the sweep on 27 August 
but a routine copy had not been sent. The 
ofﬁcer responsible was new in his post and 
his supervisor had not noticed the error. 
Additionally, the naval shore radar was disabled 
that day and consequently the ﬂotilla was not 
spotted moving into the area. 
Despite these errors the RAF had themselves 
expressed doubt about German ships operating 
off Le Havre in broad daylight. The operations 
record book of 263 Squadron stated, “Six 
ships were located at the given pinpoint sailing 
southwest. Four were probably destroyers and 
two motor vessels. Owing to doubt as to the 
identity the controller was asked four times 
whether to attack. The controller said there 
were no friendly ships in the area and ordered 
an attack.” 
Such miscommunication cost many lives 
and there was an immediate cover-up of the 
incident. Sealey recalls, “We didn’t know if 
there was an enquiry, it was all hushed up.”
There had actually been an enquiry at 
Arromanches two days after the incident, which 
concluded that Rear Admiral James Rivett-
Carnac had ordered the RAF attack because 
he had not been informed of the ﬂotilla’s work 
in the area. Three subordinate ofﬁcers were 
subsequently court-martialled with one – Acting 
Commander D N Venables – receiving a severe 
reprimand for not thoroughly checking the 
amended order on 27 August. 
None of this complicated set of badly relayed 
orders was fully explained to victims like 
Sealey and his crew members, who were left 
in the dark over the details. “It was quite some 
afterwards when we knew what had actually 
happened. We weren’t angry with the RAF but 
we did blame the admiral. Somebody should 
have picked a phone and said, ‘We’ve sent 
these minesweepers around there because 
there were still Germans in the area’.”
The admiralty’s embarrassment was so 
acute that recommended bravery awards 
for personnel caught up in the incident were 
almost denied until one outraged senior 
admiral intervened. Nevertheless, the cover-up 
was strictly imposed as Sealey remembers. 
“Afterwards we were told, ‘Do not repeat what 
happened here and by whom.’ We were given 
strict orders not to mention it.”
It was an ignoble end to an avoidable incident 
that had been created by simple errors and 
inexcusable negligence. Men like Sealey from 
the 1st Minesweeping Flotilla had been a crucial 
factor in making the Allied invasion of Europe 
possible and they were ultimately ill-rewarded 
for their hard work and success.

His cavalry slammed into the ﬂank of the Roman forces as they 
assaulted his laager of wagons, taking them completely by surprise. 
Everything was going according to Fritigern’s plan…
T
he Gothic leader Fritigern (or 
Fridigern, perhaps based on the 
Gothic Frithugairns) is, arguably, 
one of the most under-appreciated 
commanders in the ancient world.  
At the head of a complex confederation of  
Gothic tribes, he imposed a devastating defeat 
on the forces of the Eastern Roman Empire  
at the Battle of Adrianople (or Hadrianople),  
in August 378 CE. This victory, against a Roman 
army commanded by the Emperor Valens in 
person, has long been recognised as one  
of the watershed moments of history.
In recent years, there has been some 
revisionism regarding the battle’s signiﬁcance, 
downplaying its impact, but it was once 
considered the moment the Roman Empire 
ended and the Middle Ages began. This 
calamitous day, when the Eastern Roman 
Emperor Valens was killed and his army  
utterly destroyed, was certainly recognised  
by contemporary historians. The Gothic cavalry 
charge that devastated the Roman legions  
has also been seen as the origin of the heavy 
cavalry armies that would dominate warfare  
for more than a millennium. 
These theories are rejected today since they 
assumed the Goths used the stirrup (actually 
introduced to Europe in the 6th Century 
and probably ﬁrst taken advantage of by 
Charlemagne). Accounts of the battle,  
however, have long focused on the failings  
of the Romans and their emperor, rather than on 
any deliberate and intentional plan by Fritigern. 
There are more than enough sources, however, 
to reassess his qualities as a commander.
Investigating the evidence
Multiple sources refer to the catastrophe that 
befell the Roman Empire at Adrianople. The most 
reliable source remains the historian Ammianus 
Marcellinus, a contemporary from Antioch and 
a military veteran, who concluded his history 
of the Roman Empire with Adrianople. There is 
optimism in Ammianus; he states that those 
who called it the worst disaster that ever befell 
the Romans were ignorant of their history. Rome 
had experienced (and recovered from) worse 
disasters. Ammianus believed that the general 
would arise who would overcome the Goths,  
just as they had in crises past. 
Only half of Ammianus’ work survives, but 
this portion deals with the quarter century from 
354 to 378, all within the span of Ammianus’ 
lifetime. The ﬁrst 13 books (which are lost) 
covered the history of the empire from 96 to 
353. Other sources survive in various states, 
such as the histories of Zosimus, Eunapius and 
Jordanes or the church writers Sozomen and 
Socrates. Often, these writers did not focus  
on military history, but they can still be useful. 
Fritigern and Adrianople give lie to the 
common phrase ‘winners write history’

establishment of the Gothic peoples within  
the Roman Empire, their version of events 
does not survive. All our accounts are Roman 
(whether written in Latin of Greek) and this  
has slanted our view of both the battle and  
the man. We therefore have the Latinisation  
of the names of tribes and individuals.  
In many cases, our sources themselves are 
inconsistent; Ammianus names the child king  
of the Greuthungi as both Vithericus (31.4.12) 
and Viderichus (31.3.3). 
Fritigern and the Thervingi
We ﬁrst meet Fritigern in Ammianus as one of 
the leaders of the Thervingian Goths crossing 
into the Roman Empire over the Danube River 
in 376 AD. They, as well as many other tribes, 
were under pressure from the Huns further 
to the east, and had been forced to ﬂee their 
homes. The Thervingian Goths (or simply 
Thervingi) had become Romanised throughout 
the 4th Century through contact with the 
empire. This had been through trade and 
employment in the Roman army. They had  
also been converted to Arian Christianity by 
Wulﬁla earlier in the century.
We get no background on Fritigern when he 
is introduced. Other writers, such as Sozomen 
and Socrates of Constantinople, who both 
wrote histories of the church, introduce him 
earlier, in order to deal with his conversion 
to Christianity. This version has Fritigern as a 
gothic genius

VALENS IN PERSON, HAS LONG

THE WATERSHED MOMENTS 
OF HISTORY”
Although there is no known portrait of Fritigern, certain aspects of Gothic 
clothing, armour and weapons are known. Depictions of the Goths are 
difﬁcult to date precisely to the period of the battle of Adrianople, but 
sculptures showing them earlier in the 4th Century are remarkably similar to 
those that date from later, and even from the 5th Century. The styles of hair, 
helmet, swords and armour here are all typically Gothic for the period and 
drawn from a variety of sources showing Gothic warriors.

rival leader to Athanaric among the Thervingi. 
According to Sozomen (6.37), who names him 
Phritigernes, Fritigern asked Valens for help 
in his war against Athanaric and, in return, 
he and his people converted to the religion of 
the emperor (Valens was also an Arian). This 
version reveals perhaps another reason for the 
Thervingi wanting land within the empire, but 
it also shows high level contact between them 
and the Romans, as well as the high level  
of Romanisation of the Goths at the time. 
The Goths promised obedience to Emperor 
Valens and were invited into the empire to 
be settled in Moesia. Ammianus tells us that 
Valens believed he would have a vast number 
of new recruits and, therefore, an invincible 
army. Ammianus’ judgement (31.4.6) is 
succinct – the ruin of the Roman world was 
brought in with “stormy eagerness” by the 
Romans themselves. His phrase, “the barriers 
of our frontiers were unlocked,” suggests the 
idea that letting the barbarians into Rome 
was a great error. There had been earlier 
settlements of barbarian peoples in the empire, 
however, and modern scholars ascribe many 
more reasons to the fall of the Roman Empire 
than simply letting barbarians settle within 
its borders in 376. For Ammianus and his 
contemporaries, though, this was the moment 
at which, in hindsight, they could pinpoint all  
of their subsequent troubles.

Once the Goths had been settled, Rome’s 
commanders (Maximus and Lupicinus) 
mistreated the new arrivals, extorting vast 
sums for meagre supplies of food. Rather 
than being men of skill and reputation, they 
were, according to Ammianus, men of stained 
reputations. Again, Ammianus summarises 
that “their treacherous greed was the cause 
of all our evils”. Forced by famine and their 
mistreatment at the hands of the Roman 
commanders, Fritigern and the Thervingi 
revolted. At the same time, another tribe,  
the Greuthungi, had gathered on the far bank  
of the Danube and asked if they too could  
be admitted into the empire. They were  
refused, but taking advantage of the revolt, 
also crossed into the empire. 
One of the remarkable aspects of Ammianus’ 
account is how much he blames Roman actions 
for what was to happen at Adrianople. His 
description of Fritigern is full of admiration  
and praise. When ﬁrst mentioned in more than 
passing, he is complimented for “his natural 
cleverness in foresight, protecting himself 
against anything that might happen”. Fritigern 
has providentia or “foresight”, a very Roman trait 
in a commander. He is also described as quick-
witted, crafty and playing both sides – wanting to 
appear as if he were obeying his oath to Valens, 
while at the same time joining up with the 
Greuthungi. Fritigern was invited to a banquet by 
Lupicinus, and his retinue were put to the sword. 
Ammianus has him talk his way out, arguing 
that he could quell the concerns of his soldiers, 
who were becoming unruly outside the town. In 
Jordanes’ Gothic History (136), however, Fritigern 
perceived of the plot against him and escaped, 
cutting his way through the perﬁdious Romans, 
sword in hand, and rescuing his men. Despite 
the romanticism of this account, it seems more 
likely that Fritigern was able to talk his way  
out of an assassination plot. 
Revolt in full ﬂight
Fleeing from this attempt on his life, Fritigern’s 
men immediately began to rampage through the 
countryside of Thrace, taking the supplies they 
had been denied by the Roman commanders. 
Lupicinus mustered his whole force at 
Marcianopolis – the barbarians he faced were 
suffering the effects of famine and were poorly 
equipped. Nonetheless, the Goths charged the 
Roman force without a care for their lives and 
defeated their enemy easily. They were then 
able to arm themselves with Roman weapons, 
armour and shields. 
More Gothic tribes (who had been in service 
in the Roman army) now joined the rebellion 
and they too armed themselves with the 
weapons of the Roman dead, especially at the 
city of Adrianopolis, where there was one of the 
state-owned arms factories, or fabricae. There, 
the chief magistrate, the duumvir, had armed 
the poor and the armourers, but they were 
overcome by the Goths.
Fritigern quickly realised that his men were 
not suited to a siege (he is given the pithy

GOTHIC CULTURE
WE RELY ON GREEK AND LATIN SOURCES FOR THE CULTURE AND INSTITUTIONS 
OF THE GOTHS, WHICH (WE SUSPECT) OFTEN MISUNDERSTOOD BARBARIAN 
CULTURES OR EXPLAINED THEM IN TERMS THAT THEY COULD UNDERSTAND
Gothic culture was made up of a series of tribes, each with its own chieftain. In our sources 
these men are often described as kings. Fritigern is named as one such man, originally 
with another leader, Alavius, but Fritigern soon becomes the main focus of Ammianus’ 
narrative and called ‘king’ or ‘duces’. 
The actual organisation of the confederation of these Gothic tribes was much 
more complex, with each tribe having its own leader and men, but they may 
well have recognised (or even voted for) an overall leader. Fritigern is certainly 
presented in such a manner (even termed their king, despite there also 
being other kings within his confederation). 
In Ammianus and Jordanes we do get the idea that kings could be 
chosen (creating a new dynasty) and sometimes we have evidence  
of a regency by leading nobles (such as that of Althaeus and Spahrax  
of the Greuthungi). 
Athanaric is termed ‘judge’ rather than king of the Thervingi when 
he ﬁrst appears, but he is also called a king later. Indeed, there may 
have been a variety of organisational structures within the Gothic 
tribes, which our sources do not describe. There may have been 
lesser chiefs, like an aristocracy. Several of Fritigern’s commanders 
certainly ﬁt this pattern (Farnobius, Sueridas and Colias). Both 
Fritigern and Alavius are termed ‘duces’ and may have led a large 
section of the Thervingi who abandoned Athanaric. We hear no 
more of Alavius after the banquet of Lupicinus (and it is often  
stated that he was murdered there when Fritigern escaped).

phrase that he “kept peace with walls”) and set 
his men to ravaging the rich and unprotected 
parts of the countryside, and moved into the 
province of Thracia. More and more men joined 
the rebellion, including the Greuthungi leaders 
Alathaeus and Saphrax, who would become  
the commanders of Fritigern’s cavalry. 
Imperial response
The Emperor Valens was at Antioch when 
he learned of the revolt. It was so serious 
that he put off plans in the east and turned 
his attention to the Goths. He sent two 
(unfortunately poor) generals, Profuturus and 
Trajanus, ahead. The scale of the crisis is 
shown by the fact that Gratian, the Emperor 
of the West and Valens’ nephew, sent troops 
under Frigiderius, his commander from 
Pannonia, and then more with his magister 
militum, Richomeres. When these forces 
combined, Richomeres took command of  
the whole force in 377. 
We are told that the Goths had arranged 
their wagons into a circle, (a karagos in Greek). 
The best equivalent seems to be the Afrikaner 
wagon laager seen the during the Boer War. 
Although the Goths moved camp regularly,  
the Roman forces under Richomeres kept  
them under surveillance. When the Goths 
became aware of this shadowing (either 
through observation or deserters), they stayed 
put and summoned all of the marauding bands 
to a central position. This resulted in a stand-
off, though some skirmishes did break out 
among lightly armed troops. 
We are told that all the Goths and their kings 
were keen for war. Eventually, the battle lines 
were joined and there was great slaughter on 
both sides (Ammianus 31.7.13-16). Despite 
this, the battle was indecisive and the 
Romans retreated to Marcianopolis, while the 
Goths withdrew to within their wagon circle. 
Richomeres returned to Gaul to summon more 
troops and Frigiderius to Pannonia. The Romans 
also fortiﬁed the mountain passes to prevent 
a Gothic breakout. The Goths at this juncture 
formed an alliance with some Huns and Halani 
(or Alans), who were eager for the rich spoils to 
be had from the Roman provinces. 
The combined force did break out and 
ravaged the territory of Thrace and the River 
Ister as far as the Hellespont, destroying a 
Roman force commanded by one Brazimeres. 
They next turned on the forces of Frigiderius. 
All of this Gothic activity is described as a 
ravaging, mindless horde, breaking out and 
pouring over the plain of Thrace. It is worth 
remembering, however, that these Goths were 
Romanised to a large extent and had been 
joined by groups who had been resident within 
the empire for some time. We can be certain 
they knew what they were doing and that there 
was a plan behind it. Although we are not 
informed speciﬁcally, the likely author of that 
plan was Fritigern. He was attacking the Roman 
troops that had withdrawn to winter quarters 
individually; a sound strategy.
When the Goths turned on a newly returned 
Frigiderius at the city of Beroea in Thrace, 
however, they found that he was more than a 
match for them. He withdrew to Illyricum and 
came across a Gothic chieftain, Farnobius, 
whom he defeated.

The year of disaster
In the following year, Valens summoned Gratian 
to him, and intended to march at the head of 
an army to Thrace, but Gratian was prevented 
from coming quickly to Valens’ aid due to tribes 
across the Rhine rebelling and therefore tying 
up his time. He defeated these thoroughly 
and then continued east, while Valens himself 
moved from Antioch to Constantinople, 
appointing a new commander, Sebastianus. 
He made preparations and learned that the 
permanent Goth camp was near the city of 
Beroea, but that the countryside was full of 
plundering bands. One was defeated by the 
vigorous Sebastianus and Ammianus’ phrase 
(31.11.5) “Fritigern was greatly alarmed” 
implies that he was in overall command of the 
Goths and probably had been since the start. 
Fritigern summoned all of the tribes together. 
Sebastianus wrote to Valens exaggerating 
his “great success” and, even though he 
knew Gratian was en route, Valens decided 
to face the Goths alone. This is one of the 
main criticisms of Valens’ conduct, especially 
since Gratian had been summoned so that 
the combined armies could face the Goths 
together. It is possible that Valens wanted  
to achieve some military success on his own  
to compete with Gratian’s victories. 
The Goths advanced slowly and cautiously, 
moving their great camp (and coming within 15 
miles of Constantinople). Valens’ skirmishers 
reported that the entire Gothic force was made 
up of no more than 10,000 men. This was a 
grave error and hard to credit that a combined 
force of ‘only’ 10,000 had been causing so 
much trouble in the region. The disaster that 
unfolded at Adrianople can also be blamed 
on this misinformation, plus the Roman 
Emperor and his commanders believing 
it far too readily. Eunapius estimated that 
the Goth numbers were actually 200,000, 
but this is too high. Even 100,000 is 
probably too many, but it was many 
more than 10,000. So, Valens’ force 
of 20 to 30,000 men was probably 
outnumbered and it would be 
assaulting a wagon ‘city’. 
Modern reconstructions have 
the two armies as similar 
in size, in which case the 
superiority of the Gothic 
troops and their tactics are 
even more apparent. It is 
also probable that Fritigern 
was moving his forces in 
various bands or tribes, 
rather than in a single 
mass. Not only would this 
make foraging and grazing 
difﬁcult, it would also make 
his precise numbers more 
difﬁcult to assess. This was 
deliberate; Ammianus talks of 
the Goths fearing a sally against 
“THIS GOTHIC ACTIVITY IS DESCRIBED AS A RAVAGING, MINDLESS 
HORDE, BREAKING OUT AND POURING OVER THE PLAIN OF THRACE”
them (31.11.3), but they had defeated several 
Roman forces already and only single tribes 
had been defeated when they were caught 
alone and isolated.
Encouraged by the small numbers of their 
enemy and his desire to achieve a victory of his 
own, Valens was determined to attack at the 
earliest opportunity. Richomeres arrived from 
Gratian, stating that the emperor was on his 
way and urging Valens to wait. Valens held a 
council of war and, despite several arguments 
being presented in favour of waiting, Valens 
decided to attack immediately.
At this point, an envoy arrived from Fritigern 
(a presbyter and some humble folk, possibly 
monks), requesting Thrace as a new land for 
them and promising a lasting peace if this was 
granted. The various negotiations that followed 
are usually argued to be because Fritigern  
had been outmanoeuvred, but even Ammianus 
thought that Fritigern was simply playing for 
time to summon all his troops to him. Time was 
not on Fritigern’s side, however, and he must 
have known that Gratian was on his way with 
another army to reinforce Valens. 
It seems far more likely that Fritigern had 
another plan and that his actions in sending 
multiple envoys were deliberate; the time  
he needed was a matter of hours rather than 
days. We are even told that Fritigern was full 
of trickery and pretence “all too skilled in craft 
and various forms of deception” (31.12.9). 
With his envoy he sent a private letter asking 
that Valens bring his army close to the Goths, 
ready for war, “to entice them to adopt 
conditions favourable to the Roman 
state” through fear of the Roman army. 
Fritigern’s forces had shown that, 
combined and equipped, they had 
little to fear from the Roman forces 
they had seen up to that point. It 
seems more likely that Fritigern was 
luring Valens into his trap. One 
of Ammianus’ criticisms of 
Valens character was that 
he was a procrastinator 
(31.14.7) and 
Fritigern had 
dealt with 
the emperor 
in person 
before, so 
he may have 
known the 
tenor of the 
man he was 
up against.  
The envoys  
were dismissed 
and the army 
prepared to march.
9 August, 378 CE
The day dawned hot and 
Valens’ army marched 
“with extreme haste” from 
Adrianopolis towards the 
Goths, reaching the wagon

armour would have been the same as  
the Romans he faced

circle at the eighth hour, about two in the 
afternoon. Ammianus tells us that the wagons 
were arranged in a perfect circle, “turned by 
the lathe”. This phrase has not caused any 
historian pause. 
The Gothic position was clearly deliberately 
chosen and carefully drawn up. The Romans 
moved into action on the right, while the 
centre waited, and the left was still deploying. 
Ammianus’ accounts mention at this point 
(31.12.12) that Fritigern’s cavalry under 
Althaeus and Saphrax was far away and, 
because of that, Fritigern sent more envoys. 
Almost universally, this is interpreted to mean 
that his cavalry force was away foraging. This 
cannot be the case since they were to return 
very soon and deliberately charge the Roman 
ﬂank – hardly an action they would be prepared 
to do if they were foraging. 
It seems more likely that Fritigern knew 
exactly where his cavalry were and rather 
than delay because they might arrive in time, 
his playing for time was a matter of minutes, 
allowing them to get into a pre-arranged 
position to deliver their planned charge. This 
seems entirely in keeping with the tricks and 
deception Fritigern was known for and with the 
carefully prepared position of the Gothic laager.
What is more, the ﬁrst envoys sent were 
of low rank and Fritigern knew they would be 
rejected. Ammianus talks of this “pretended 
truce” (31.12.13) to allow the cavalry to return. 
He then adds that in addition to waiting for the 
cavalry, the wait was so that: “Our soldiers 
might be exposed to the summer heat and 
exhausted by their dry throats, while the broad 
plains gleamed with ﬁres, which the enemy 
were feeding with wood and dry fuel, for this 
same purpose.”
 This ‘trick’ of lighting ﬁres is accepted by all 
accounts even though the smoke would affect 
the Goths just as much as it would the Romans. 
One aspect that has not been considered is  
that these ﬁres were in fact intended as a 
signal to the cavalry that all was ready, or even 
a signal from the cavalry that they were coming 
(and if some low-ranking envoys happened to be 
sacriﬁced for this plan, so be it). 
Ammianus then notes (31.12.14) that 
Fritigern, “shrewd to forsee the future and 
fearing the uncertainty of war,” sent a common 
soldier requesting Roman hostages to secure 
the peace he desired. This would seem to be 
yet more playing for time, so this request for 
hostages caused great debate at the tent of 
the emperor. Richomeres volunteered to go as 
hostage. Before he could arrive at the enemy’s 
laager, however, the skirmishers of one of 
the Roman commanders, probably the right 
ﬂank, became heavily engaged with the Goths. 
Ammianus then tells us (31.12.17): “The Gothic 
cavalry, returning with Altheus and Saphrax, 
combined with a band of the Halani, dashed out 
as a thunder-bolt does near high mountains, 
and threw into confusion all those whom they 
could ﬁnd in the way of their swift onslaught, 
and quickly slew them.”
This does not seem to be the arrival of groups 
of cavalry that had been away foraging, but part 
of a deliberate plan to deliver a cavalry charge 
into the enemy’s ﬂank. As such, Fritigern’s 
delaying tactics, as well as his obviously careful 
selection and preparation of the Gothic position, 
were very deliberate. His plan was helped 
immensely by Valens’ eagerness for battle and 
several other mistakes, such as not conducting 
accurate reconnaissance.
The left wing of the Roman army was deserted 
by its cavalry, who ﬂed at the ﬁrst charge, and 
the infantry were crushed. The remainder of 
the Roman force were then pushed together. 
The Gothic infantry then made a charge from 
their wagons (again something that had been 
deliberately planned by Fritigern, rather than 
some spontaneous movement), which broke the 
Roman line and they ﬂed. Zosimus (4.24.2) calls 
the battle an easy victory for the Goths (since 
the Romans were in disarray and overconﬁdent) 
and a massacre. Only a moonless night brought 
an end to the killing. In the aftermath, according 
to Ammianus and Libanius, Valens died from 
an arrow wound and was never found. Another 
version of his demise is that he took refuge in  
an un-walled village or a peasant’s cottage, 
which was burned by the Goths.
The level of the disaster of Adrianople  
is difﬁcult to assess – certainly the Roman 
army of the east had been destroyed and the 
emperor killed. Some estimates say two-thirds 
of the Roman army were killed. Contemporaries 
regarded it as the greatest disaster ever to 
befall them. Ammianus is more balanced than 
that (although the end of the Western Roman 
Empire was only two generations away). The 
Eastern Roman Empire (which we know as 
the Byzantine Empire) and which Adrianople 
affected more than the west, would survive  
for another 1,000 years. The very barbarians 
who visited the disaster of Adrianople upon  
the empire were, however, enlisted to help  
the new emperor, Theodosius I, by 382.
Fritigern seems to have had a reputation 
for tricks and treachery and was clearly 
respected among the Goths as the leader of 
their confederation. If we see Adrianople as 
a deliberate Gothic 
plan played out to 
perfection, combined 
with a series of dire 
Roman mistakes, 
the destruction of 
the Romans seems 
far more explicable. 
And Fritigern’s place 
as an unrecognised 
general of immense 
skill, trickery and 
planning should 
be assured. After 
Adrianople, Fritigern 
all but disappears 
from history, though 
he was still in place 
as the head of the 
confederation. He 
was succeeded by 
Alaric, another great 
Gothic military leader 
who would sack the 
city of Rome in 410.

defensive ﬁre, in April 1917, the German XXV 
Army Corps reported triumphantly: “The tank 
threat has been overcome. The dedicated 
anti-tank guns of the artillery have performed 
brilliantly. There is nothing to be added to the 
subject of tank defence.” A report, meanwhile, 
by 27 Infantry Division proclaimed: “By 
equipping the infantry with K-ammunition and 
a trench cannon, means have been found that 
must mean the end of future tank attacks.”
The thought that Allied armour could be 
failing as a result of capital errors being made 
by the Allies was being drowned out by the joy 
of German success. During the Third Battle 
of Ypres, the feeling of German superiority in 
face of the tank was strengthened even further. 
Again, curtain ﬁre by the artillery and direct ﬁre 
by individual ﬁeld pieces positioned near the 
front lines stalled the advance of British tanks. 
The fact that the German success was 
largely based on the weather and the resulting 
ground conditions, however, remained largely 
unsaid. Nevertheless, in the same month, 
German High Command, suspicious of all the 
triumphant and glossed-over combat reports, 
sent out a despatch asking for true and honest 
information – only with this would it be possible 
to end the tank threat ‘once and for all’. 
Cambrai: morale versus material? 
On the evening of 20 November 1917, the 
German front between Ribécourt and Banteux 
anti-tank capability inﬂuence the location  
of the defensive lines themselves. 
Similarly, trenches of that kind were only 
to be found in front of that particular part of 
the Hindenburg Line. Requests to extend the 
defences further were denied – a mistake that 
would have lasting consequences. Due to their 
sparse and rare use on the battleﬁeld, the 
real threat of the tank had not yet been fully 
understood and German High Command was 
content that sufﬁcient means were in place  
to defeat the Allied offensives expected to  
be launched in the spring of 1917.
When the Nivelle Offensive, in front of Arras 
and at the Aisne, was torn apart by German 
I
n the months following the Battle of 
the Somme, artillery ﬁre – both direct 
and indirect – had shown the greatest 
effect against British tanks, as had the 
specialised K-ammunition, steel core 
bullets ﬁred by riﬂes and machine guns, plus 
bundled charges of multiple hand grenades. 
New specialised artillery pieces and new 
kinds of shells were developed and rushed 
into service while on the battleﬁeld, and in the 
rearward areas behind the lines, new tactics 
and strategies were being developed. 
To raise the spirits of the men and to 
motivate them further, a substantial kill-bounty 
of 500 Reichsmarks was offered to those 
German units that managed to destroy one of 
the iron beasts in combat. In general, German 
High Command believed that bundled charges 
and K-bullets, which were now issued in larger 
numbers, gave the infantry the edge against 
Allied armour. The value of the use of terrain 
was also recognised and put into tactical use 
during the construction of the Siegfriedstellung, 
in front of which triple Panzersperrgräben  
(tank-blocking trenches) formed what  
appeared to be an impregnable obstacle. 
On a strategic level, however, the lines 
for these defences were still drawn out to 
maximise the effectiveness of artillery and 
infantry ﬁre and to secure terrain that offered 
itself as a starting point for German offensives. 
Nowhere along the front did the thought of  
“TO RAISE THE SPIRITS OF THE 
MEN AND TO MOTIVATE THEM 
FURTHER, A SUBSTANTIAL KILL-
BOUNTY OF 500 REICHSMARKS 
WAS OFFERED TO THE UNITS  
OF THOSE WHO MANAGED  
TO DESTROY ONE OF THE  
IRON BEASTS IN COMBAT”
The dawn of tank warfare on the battleﬁelds of the Great War swiftly 
brought about the necessity for new anti-tank tactics and weaponry. 
When the ﬁrst tanks broke through German lines on 15 September 
1916, the defending infantry lacked any effective  
means to combat the new threat

lay battered. Some 142 German guns had 
fallen into enemy hands and the Allied offensive 
had not been repelled by German defensive ﬁre 
before a breakthrough into the German lines 
had been achieved. The element of surprise, 
thick fog and the ﬁrst en masse use of tanks 
had made German anti-tank defences largely 
ineffective. The few exceptions that had scored 
some notable successes against the British 
armour had involved small groups of infantry 
defending village streets and some ﬁeld guns 
ﬁring directly from advanced positions. 
One of these guns would later give rise to the 
so-called ‘Krüger Myth’. At the south-western 
edge of Flesquieres, it was said, a single ﬁeld gun 
of the 108th Artillery Regiment had been brought 
into position where, over the course of the battle 
(and in the last phase manned by a single, death-
defying NCO), it had destroyed no less than 16 
British tanks. 
In a British after-action report, Captain 
Dugdale of the British 6 Division mentioned that 
on the ridge at Flesquieres he could observe a 
battery of German artillery, of which all of the 
guns had been knocked out with the exception of 
one. Next to it lay the body of a German gunner, 
while in front of it stood the wrecks of ﬁve 
tanks, which had obviously been destroyed by 
him during the course of an intense ﬁnal-stand 
battle. Dugdale’s observations were repeated in 
Field Marshal Haig’s dispatch, who also praised 
the gunner’s bravery. 
In Britain, the press was keen to take up 
the story, with the number of tanks increasing 
in every report. Interested in the fact that the 
enemy was singing the praises of one of their 
soldiers, the Germans set out to try to identify 
the unknown gunner. After a lot of debate and by 
using all kinds of source material and personal 
“NEAR ARRAS THE ENGLISH HAVE RUN INTO OUR REARWARD DEFENCES AFTER HAVING ADVANCED 
FOR ABOUT TWO KILOMETRES. THERE, OUR MACHINE GUNS DID THEIR JOB WELL AND STALLED THE 
ENGLISH ATTACK COMPLETELY. IN PANIC, MANY TRIED TO FIND COVER BEHIND ONE OF THEIR TANKS, 
YET THESE MACHINES STOOD HELPLESS ON THE GROUND WHILE THE DEAD PILED UP BEHIND THEM. 
THE EFFECT OF THE TANK HAS BEEN SEVERELY OVERRATED SINCE THEY MADE THEIR DEBUT ON THE 
BATTLEFIELD. THE FIGHTING IN APRIL HAS SHOWN CLEARLY WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM 
THEM. WE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE VULNERABLE AND WHERE WE HAVE TO HIT THEM (…) ON OPEN 
GROUND THEY MOVE FORWARD AT THE SPEED OF A SLOWLY WALKING MAN. OUR BEST WEAPONS 
AGAINST THEM ARE SMALL CALIBRE TRENCH CANNON, WHICH CAN BE USED BY THE INFANTRY.  
NEAR ARRAS, K-AMMUNITION HAS BEEN EFFECTIVELY USED AGAINST THEM HAVING BEEN FIRED 
FROM CLOSE RANGE. FUEL TANK AND CARBURETTOR, BOTH SITUATED ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT 
FRONT SIDE, ARE THE WEAKEST SPOT. ONE SHOT CAN PIERCE THE FUEL TANK AND IGNITE IT,  
IN WHICH CASE THE WHOLE CREW BURNS TO DEATH. MOST IMPORTANT THOUGH IS TO KEEP  
A COOL HEAD AS YOU NEED TO AIM WELL TO ACHIEVE A GOOD HIT.”

accounts, it was Unterofﬁzier Theodor Krüger 
who was ﬁnally, in 1929, named by the Germans 
as the hero in question. Yet this decision was 
not generally accepted. Both in Britain and in 
Germany, the discussion over the existence and 
identity of the mystery German soldier continued 
until the mid-1940s and was one of the main 
reasons why the volume on Cambrai was the 
last of the ofﬁcial British Histories of the Great 
War to be published, in 1948. 
Eventually, it was the National Socialists 
that ensured that a monument to Krüger, the 
Ehrenmal der deutschen Feldartillerie, was 
dedicated and erected to the memory of the 
German Artillery arm in Cologne shortly before 
the outbreak of the Second World War. Today we 
can conﬁdently say that there was no German 
gunner who destroyed 16 British tanks single-
handedly before being killed at his gun, yet the 
story is still accepted and widely circulated. 
Only a day later, on 21 November, the 
German defence started to stiffen. Near 
Cantaing, the Kraftwagen-Geschütze – large 
calibre anti-aircraft guns mounted on lorries – 
were rushed into battle for the ﬁrst time in the 
war, engaging British tanks at long range, then 
rushing away before being subjected to enemy 
retaliation. In Fontaine-Notre-Dame, German 
infantry ﬁghting from the cover of buildings 
and alleyways succeeded in destroying a large 
number of British tanks using K-ammunition 
and bundled charges, while the bloody struggle 
for the village and wood of Bourlon signalled 
the end of successive tank attacks. Perhaps 
this meant that German defensive means were 
sufﬁcient after all?

The heavy blows that had been dealt by Allied 
tanks left no doubt that something needed to 
be done. The mass of orders issued at the front, 
however, were still useless. “Observation,” 
“reconnaissance”, “obstacle construction”  
and “stubborn resistance” could not make  
up for the lack of effective defensive weaponry. 
The construction of obstacles required both 
stable defensive lines and time – two things 
unavailable to the Germans throughout the 
second half of 1918. In some areas, mineﬁelds 
were laid and tank traps were dug, but in 
general, these actions came too late. 
Plans had been made, up to the spring 
of 1919, to issue 30,000 AT-riﬂes, 1,000 AT 
machine guns, smoke and AT hand grenades, 
plus 4,500 37mm cannon of various types. 
The infantry would also have access to 200 
improved 2cm Becker guns and 22 newly 
raised infantry gun batteries. Each pioneer 
company would have been issued with six extra 
ﬂame throwers (that had performed superbly 
in previous engagements). Added to that, the 
design of an 18mm machine gun was ordered.
Yet the German soldiers facing masses 
of modern and effective tanks in the ﬁnal 
months of the First World War had to defend 
themselves with the same makeshift means 
they had used at the Battle of the Somme, 
two years earlier. This time, however, they 
rarely had the protection of a well-entrenched 
position. On 7 November 1918, British ﬂying 
columns supported by armoured cars harassed 
the German retreat and ﬁnally closed the 
storybook of German anti-tank responses 
during the First World War, which, while initially 
superior, had been rendered ineffective by the 
superiority and mass of Allied tanks.

On 30 November, a masterful German 
counterstroke smashed into the worn-out 
troops of Byng’s army. It was a major success 
of new German offensive tactics that not only 
recaptured the ground lost in the previous 
ﬁghting, but also resulted in the capture of 
10,000 prisoners, 716 machine guns, 148 
artillery pieces and, most importantly, 100 
tanks – vehicles that would be evaluated and, 
a few months later, see service against their 
former owners. German troops achieved all  
that without using tanks. 
The counter-offensive had been a victory  
of superior tactics unleashed against a worn-
out and spent foe, but this was more or less 
ignored. At Cambrai, the lesson was clear – 
German morale and tactics had triumphed over 
British material, a major misconception that 
would have far-reaching consequences in the 
second half of the following year. Again German 
High Command ignored critical reports from its 
subordinates that could have been used well  
to draft new and effective defensive strategies.  
All focus was put on the successful second 
phase of the defensive struggle, instead of 
evaluating the real reasons for the initial failure 
of the German defences on 20 November. 
On 12 December, the 119th Infantry Division, 
which had only been thrown into the fray on 
22 November, reported: “Infantry with hand 
grenades, K-bullets and light mine throwers 
has no need to fear even a large-scale tank 
attack.” Even the Gruppe Chaudry, a formation 
that had been at the receiving end of the 
successful armoured British onslaught of 20 
November, reported that the 119th Division 
“repeatedly and successfully faced and repelled 
numerous British tank attacks”. Looking at this 
background, it doesn’t come as a surprise that 
the German Army’s perception of its anti-tank 
capabilities drifted further apart from reality 
with each successive day. 
If the Allies were kept under proper 
observation and if the defensive doctrines 
were followed to the letter, nothing could 
go wrong. The lack of ﬂexibility of masses 
of indirectly ﬁring artillery against a quickly 
advancing mass attack of armour, as 
witnessed on 20 November, was just as 
overlooked as the fact that the existing 
anti-tank weaponry of the infantry was only

“THE FIGHT AGAINST ENEMY TANKS IS OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE. OUR EARLY SUCCESSES HAVE LED TO A CERTAIN 
KIND OF CONTEMPT AND DISDAIN TOWARDS THEM, BUT NOW WE HAVE TO FACE TANKS THAT ARE MORE HEAVILY ARMOURED, 
SMALLER AND MORE AGILE. BUT EVEN THOSE CAN BE OUTFOUGHT – EVENTUALLY, IT IS ONLY THE VIGILANCE AND FIGHTING 
POWER OF THE INFANTRY THAT WILL ALLOW A SUCCESSFUL DEFENCE.”

sufﬁcient to stall small-scale attacks. British 
success at Cambrai on 20 November had only 
been an episode and it would only need minor 
changes in doctrine and equipment to stabilise 
the front for future attacks. It was realised 
that K-bullets and the already planned 13mm 
anti-tank riﬂe alone were not effective enough 
and that a new machine gun in the same large 
calibre was needed. 
In the future, tanks were to be met 
by dispersed ‘nests’ of infantry armed 
with K-ammunition, bundled charges and 
Minenwerfers on low trajectory cradles, 
instead of infantry waiting in rigid defensive 
lines. A mobile defensive reserve of motorised 
anti-tank guns was to be formed and kept in 
readiness, while rearward settlements were to 
be protected by permanently installed, Belgian-
made 5.7cm guns equipped with new armour-
piercing shells. 
1918: material wins
When Germany launched its Spring Offensive 
on 21 March 1918, and assault troops swept 
across the terrain between Croisilles and La 
Fère, crushing Allied resistance wherever it 
was encountered, the Tankschrecken, the Tank 
Fear, seemed to be a thing of the past. The 
frenzied whirl of victory, glory and blood cast 
a pall over the mostly successful defensive 
operations of the Allied armour, which, 
even today, are often described as rather 
meaningless rearguard actions. 
Yet the British tank attacks on 21 March, at 
Épehy and Doignies, on 22 March, near Roisel, 
Épehy and Vaulx-Vraucourt, and on 24 April, 
at Villers-Bretonneux, inﬂicted serious losses 
on the German assault troops, often pushing 
them back towards the positions of the 
foremost German artillery batteries. Only the 
use of massed German artillery laying down 
curtains of defensive ﬁre and German ground 
attack aeroplanes managed to blunt these 
counter attacks. 
Whenever attacking German infantry was 
caught up by British tanks, losses were severe, 
but again reports of these local ﬁascos failed 
to reach the OHL. German Army High Command 
remained blind to the fact that the infantry still 
lacked the means to effectively engage tanks 
in battle. On the other hand, local successes 
of German artillery against tanks, such as at 
Chaudon, on 31 May, and Matz, on 11 June, 
were highlighted and taken as proof that 
German defensive measures were able to cope 
with everything the Allies could ﬁeld. Added to 
the lack of reports on Allied tank successes 
against German infantry came the grinding 
and time-consuming processes of German 
bureaucracy. On 1 June 1918, German troops 
captured the ﬁrst of the new and revolutionary 
French light Renault FT-17 tanks. To those on 
the ground, it was clear that this new design 
was of major importance and so the tank was 
transported back to Avesnes for evaluation.  
The vehicle was tested and a detailed report 
was compiled, but failed to reach the OHL. 
When the FT-17 was ﬁrst used in large 
numbers, on 18 July 1918, it came as an utter 
and devastating surprise. Even then, when the 
power of the tank used en masse had been 
clearly visible to everyone on the battleﬁeld, 
self-deceptive reports were still spread within 
the army. The 78th Reserve Division reported 
on 18 July: “Tanks only exert an inﬂuence on 
morale, both on that of the attacker and that  
of the defender. In general, their appearance  
is only owed to the decline of morale and 
nerves of the attacking troops. Soldiers  
of 1914 would not have needed tanks.”
The reversal of fortune that was initiated 
when General Mangin set his tanks into  
motion from the forest of Villers-Cotterêts,  
on 18 July 1918, came as a surprise to both 
the German troops on the ground and German  
High Command. The French tank arm, which 
seemed to have had little inﬂuence during  
the previous offensive battles, had suddenly 
lunged out a mighty blow, aiming its thrust at 
German troops that had only just given their 
stocks of K-ammunition to “units defending 
more threatened sectors” of the front. 
The lines had not been secured by state- 
of-the-art defensive works and ﬁelds of ﬁre  
were limited. Even the cornﬁelds in front  
of the German lines had not been cut down.  
Only in the last possible moment, when  
French tanks were already engaging the 
German artillery in the rear, did sufﬁcient 
reserves of assault infantry and motorised 
artillery rush in, managing to push the attackers 
back. The same happened again on 8 August, 
near Amiens. While warnings from German 
frontline commanders were being dismissed 
as the hallucinatory fantasies of overly nervous 
combat troops, the Allies had been assembling 
for a major offensive operation. 
When waves of enemy infantry and tanks 
ﬁnally attacked, they were met by German 
defenders who were totally unprepared.  
The infantry hadn’t been supplied with 
sufﬁcient anti-tank weaponry, while the  
German artillery were rendered ineffective

HEROES OF THE VICTORIA CROSS
SAMMY L. DAVIS
D
uring the production of the 1994 
Academy Award-winning ﬁlm 
Forrest Gump, Sammy Davis 
received an interesting telephone 
call at his Illinois home. On the 
other end of the line was a representative of 
the Pentagon.
The caller informed Sammy that the ﬁlm 
company wanted to use still photos and 
archival footage of the 1968 ceremony in 
which President Lyndon B. Johnson presented 
Davis and four other American soldiers 
with the nation’s highest award for valour 
in combat, the Medal of Honor. “They were 
telling me, not asking,” Sammy smiled. 
“When you receive the Medal of Honor you 
kind of become public domain.”
The footage of the ceremony was used in the 
hit ﬁlm – with the head of Oscar-winning actor 
Tom Hanks superimposed on Sammy’s body. “It 
was interesting to see that,” related Davis. “The 
military action in the movie is based on how I 
earned my Medal of Honor, when I was blown 
half out of my foxhole. That was how Forrest 
Gump was shot in the buttocks!”
Since the movie’s debut, Sammy has been 
known as the ‘real Forrest Gump’, and he has 
come to cherish the association. On November 
18, 1967, however, the instinct to survive, to 
help wounded comrades, and to beat back a 
tremendous attack by communist forces were 
foremost in his mind. Not even the numbing pain 
of severe wounds dissuaded him. The future, if he 
lived to see it, was minute by minute.
CHOPPER INTO CHAOS
When Sammy graduated from high school in 
1965, his class set off on a trip to New York 
City. He didn’t join his classmates, though. He 
headed for the recruiting station and joined the 
U.S. Army. Within months, he was assigned 
to Battery C, 4th Artillery, 2nd Battalion, 9th 
Infantry Division and, like many other young 
soldiers, found himself deployed to Vietnam. 
At the time, Southeast Asia was the ﬂashpoint 
for armed conﬂict between the U.S. backed 
pro-Western South Vietnamese government and 
the communist regime of North Vietnam, which 
supported the Viet Cong guerrilla insurgency 
that was a constant and often unseen enemy 
in the ﬁeld.
Well trained in the capabilities and operations 
of the 105mm howitzer and the basic small 
arms that were standard issue in the U.S. 
Army, Sammy and his battery mates were 
given the mission of providing artillery support 
for an infantry offensive against an incursion 
of North Vietnamese troops and Viet Cong 
guerrillas inﬁltrating into South Vietnam from 
the neighbouring countries of Cambodia and 
Laos. The 105mm howitzer was a workhorse 
of American and South Vietnamese forces in 
South Vietnam. While it was light enough for 
theatre tactical transport, it packed a serious 
punch, capable of throwing a 105mm (4.1-inch) 
shell weighing 19.08 kilograms (42.06 pounds) a 
distance of 11,270 metres (7 miles).
On the morning of November 17, 1967, the 
men of Battery C boarded twin-rotored Boeing 
CH-47 Chinook helicopters for the ride to the 
combat zone in an area known as the Plain of 
Reeds. Every inch of space in the big choppers 
was crammed full of 105mm ammunition. The 
howitzers were suspended in slings below the 
choppers’ bellies and swayed with the wind 
and changes in direction. Soldiers of the 5th 
Battalion, 60th Infantry Regiment were to 
serve as support once the artillerymen were 
on the ground.

“They picked us up at 6 a.m., and we ﬂew for 
an hour and a half or so,” Davis remembered, 
“and then started to come down a little lower. 
They set us down in an open spot in the jungle 
along the banks of the Mekong River, all four of 
our guns together, and it became Fire Support 
Base Cudgel.”
The gunners set their quartet of howitzers 
immediately after landing and began ﬁring in 
support of hard-pressed infantrymen already 
locked in close combat with the enemy, which 
may have been North Vietnamese Army regulars 
or Viet Cong. Davis isn’t sure to this day as to 
the composition of the opposing force. “Ofﬁcial 
records say there were about 1,500 Viet Cong,” 
he advised, “but the enemy I fought with that 
night had on North Vietnamese uniforms, and 
at least 10 of them had on Chinese uniforms. 
As soon as we untethered the howitzers from 
the Chinooks, we started ﬁring. Our infantrymen

were literally crying for artillery support. They 
were getting hit really hard. We laid our gun as 
quickly as we could and ﬁred as fast as we could 
unload the ammo from the boxes. We ﬁred all 
day without stopping. Each gun probably ﬁred 
close to 1,000 rounds. I don’t know the record, 
but that is a lot for a 105mm howitzer.”
Ofﬁcial records indicate that the Americans 
were up against at least three companies of 
the 261st Viet Cong Main Force Battalion, a 
reinforced heavy weapons battalion. In the 
late afternoon following the intense session of 
bombardment, the gunners ceased ﬁring and 
went to work on establishing their perimeter on 
the banks of the river and close to the village of 
Cai Lay. Within hours, Fire Support Base Cudgel 
was at least temporarily secured.
“A Huey (Bell UH-1 helicopter) came in that 
afternoon before dark, and a major climbed out 
and gathered 42 of us kids around there and said

that the probability of us getting hit that night 
was 100 per cent,” recalled Sammy. “We thought 
what he meant was that a few mortar rounds and 
some small-arms ﬁre would come in after dark 
and that would be it. That happened a couple of 
times a week, but we had never been involved in 
an attack that was intended to overrun us. That 
had not happened in Vietnam to my knowledge, 
so we thought, ‘What’s the big deal?’”
RAIN OF STEEL
They were wrong. Previous experience was 
nothing like the attack that was to come. In the 
pre-dawn hours of the next day, Private First 
Class Sammy Davis and the rest of Battery C 
were ﬁghting for their lives.
“At 2 a.m., we started getting mortared,” 
he remembered, “and they were raining down. 
The average enemy mortar attack was three to 
ﬁve rounds with 10 being about the maximum. 
SAMMY L. DAVIS

But this one… Wow, it was heavy! At exactly 
2:30, they stopped. There was a strange, eerie 
silence. My gun was right on the riverbank, and 
from across the river we could hear people 
yelling, ‘Tonight you die GI!’ We could see 150 to 
200 people formed up to make a mass assault.”
To defend against the attack, the howitzers 
were loaded with anti-personnel rounds called 
‘beehive’. Each shell contained 18,000 small 
ﬂechettes, or darts, that essentially turned the 
105mm howitzer into a giant shotgun. Davis 
crouched and tried to take cover behind the 
protective shield on the gun carriage. “We 
couldn’t ﬁre until we got conﬁrmation that our 
infantry had withdrawn into our perimeter,” he 
explained. “Finally, we got the command to ﬁre. 
I pulled the lanyard, and the piece went off. The 
enemy had set up rockets and 
ﬁred at my muzzle 
blast. They ﬁred 
a 57mm recoilless riﬂe round that hit the gun 
shield and blew me away from the howitzer. Part 
of that round hit my sergeant, James Gant, in 
the chest, and it blew me half out of my foxhole.”
When the other artillerymen of Sammy’s 
unit saw his gun erupt in smoke and ﬂame, one 
howitzer ﬁred a beehive round at several enemy 
soldiers trying to turn the disabled gun around 
on the Americans. Sammy was hit by friendly ﬁre 
from that discharge.
“They thought all of us were dead,” Davis 
shook his head. “My butt was sticking over the 
sandbags, and that is how ‘Forrest’ got shot in 
the buttocks. I got 30 darts from my thighs to 
my fourth lumbar vertebra, also in one kidney.”
Although he was seriously wounded and 
probably suffering from a concussion, the shock 
of that friendly shell shook Davis out of 
semi-consciousness. “The beehive 
woke me up,” he continued,

WE’RE VIETNAM VETERANS. 
COMBAT VETERANS. HE SAVED 
MY LIFE”

“and some of the guys said later that they saw 
me kind of convulse. I remember being in the 
bottom of that foxhole. I could see tracer ﬁre 
above me. Their lights were pretty, and it was 
November, so I thought about Christmas. I had 
laid there probably 15 or 20 minutes, and then I 
remember hearing a rat-tat-tat, and it seemed to 
be getting closer.”
Despite his wounds, a re-energised Davis 
grabbed his M-16 riﬂe and the 12 ammunition 
clips, 180 rounds, lying nearby. The surging 
enemy soldiers were crossing the river and 
climbing up the bank. After expending all the 
M-16 rounds, he looked for another weapon 
and remembered that Private Martin Hart had 
posted a 7.62mm M-60 machine gun in the next 
foxhole. He crawled over and found the weapon 
along with a box of 1,000 rounds and began 
ﬁring once again.
“As those men came up the riverbank, I 
did my job as a soldier,” Davis offered. “The 
traumatic brain injury I had made it feel like a 
dream. I know now that it was always a different 
guy, but it looked like the same enemy soldier 
getting up again and again after falling in the 
water. I felt like a soldier in hell.”
When he ran out of M-60 ammunition, enemy 
soldiers were still coming up the riverbank. 
Davis looked over at his disabled howitzer and 
believed that he was the only American left 
alive in the vicinity. He scrounged around to ﬁnd 
the components of another beehive round and 
remembered that Sergeant Gant had told his 
crew that to be effective the beehive had to be 
assembled with seven bags of powder in each 
canister before ﬁring. Most of the bags had been 
ripped open by shrapnel and bullets, so Davis 
shovelled powder in by the handful. He loaded 
the gun tube, but there were no operational 
mechanisms to traverse the weapon. Sammy 
simply lifted the battered howitzer and rotated it 
toward the enemy.
Lying in a pool of water with only his nose 
above, Davis waited a moment. “When they 
started over the bank again, the gun went pop,” 
he said, “and then momentarily it shook up and 
down and then went off with the wet powder 
inside. Later, at the artillery school at Fort Sill, 
Oklahoma, it was estimated that I had loaded 
the weapon with a ‘charge 20’, when a ‘charge 
7’ is the maximum for a perfectly working 105. 
When the howitzer fell back down after ﬁring, it 
landed on me and completely broke my back and 
crushed the ribs on my right side.”
ACROSS THE RIVER AND BACK
Incredibly, Davis recovered to see smoke 
lifting from the immediate area. There were no 
enemy soldiers coming forward, but he ﬁred 
the howitzer several more times, expending all 
the beehive and high-explosive shells he could 
gather. The last round he ﬁred at the enemy was 
stuffed with propaganda leaﬂets.
Then, across the haze-shrouded river, Sammy 
saw movement. Specialist 4 Gwendell Holloway 
lay wounded on the other side. “In the light of 
a ﬂare I saw a buddy and said, ‘I’ve got to get 
him’,” he remembered. “He had a hole in his 
head I could lay two ﬁngers in and was shot in 
the back and had shrapnel wounds.”
Unable to swim, Davis used an inﬂatable 
air mattress to paddle to the other side of 
the river, where he found two other wounded 
soldiers. “I saw Jim Deister. He had been shot 
through the ear, and he did indeed live. Billy 
Ray Crawford had lost his left leg. Gwendell 
had put a tourniquet on him. They said the 
North Vietnamese had shot into their foxhole. 
By that time, I had taken a round from an 
AK-47 in the thigh. I asked the Lord for the 
strength to carry all three of them,” he sighed. 
“We headed back toward the river and could 
hear the enemy. I watched them run across in 
front of us, and when one of them saw me, I 
would do my job as they went past us. Then I 
used a riﬂe (Holloway’s M-16) as a club. I took 
Jim across ﬁrst and went back and got Billy 
Ray and Gwendell.”
Miraculously, all four men survived the ﬁerce 
ﬁght, as did Sergeant Gant, patched up with a 
ﬁrst aid kit and later evacuated. Davis refused 
medical treatment ahead of other wounded men.
“The enemy broke contact at 8 in the 
morning,” Sammy recalled, “and by 9 we had 
helicopter dustoffs. Out of the 42 guys we had 
up there, 12 were still standing, including myself. 
My guys loaded me on a helicopter, and I woke 
up later at Camp Zama, Japan, near Tokyo.”
Sometime after he departed, several of 
Sammy’s comrades signed afﬁdavits that 
supported a recommendation for the Medal of 
Honor. He was notiﬁed that the medal would 
be presented by President Johnson, and in an 
unusual gesture was allowed to return to his 
combat unit for a short period of time under  
a direct order from General William 
Westmoreland, commander of American  
troops in Southeast Asia.
On 19 November 1968, a year and a day 
after the ﬁght near Cai Lay, Davis was one of ﬁve 
soldiers who received the Medal of Honor at the 
White House in Washington, D.C. “The president 
stepped into a little room to talk to us before the 
ceremony,” he remembered. “I think he knew we 
were a little nervous. He talked with each one 
of us individually, and we talked about catching 
ﬁsh and eating crawdads. I was stationed at Fort 
Hood, Texas, and he gave me a card and said, 
‘Son, I have a ranch not far from there. Come 
down and see me.’ I got to go to the ranch three 
or four times. The president was never there, but 
his wife, Lady Bird, was. She treated me like a 
mama would.”
Following his discharge from active duty, 
Sammy remained in the National Guard with 
the 682nd Combat Engineer Battalion from 
Lawrenceville, Illinois, until his retirement in 
1984. He remains a busy man, travelling with his 
wife, Dixie, at least 200 days a year, speaking 
to troops in global hotspots such as Iraq, 
Afghanistan, Bosnia and South Korea. He is also 
pleased to present his thoughts on patriotism 
and the cost of freedom to school and civic 
groups across the United States. He leaves his 
audiences with the motto, “You don’t lose, till 
you quit trying!”
Sammy reﬂected, “It is always a privilege to 
sit and sign photos and talk to people, and I 
particularly enjoy meeting school children and 
talking with them. It is part of the obligation I 
hold and part of my job as a Medal of Honor 
recipient. Although my name is on the back of 
the medal, it doesn’t mean it belongs to me. I 
am only the caretaker.”
Now past his 70th birthday, Davis has 
returned to the overgrown battleﬁeld at Cai Lay. 
He has reunited with old comrades and eaten 
cordial dinners with former enemies as an 
ambassador of goodwill half a century after that 
desperate night in 1967. He intends to continue 
travelling, speaking and paying tribute to those 
lost as long as he is able.
The village of Cai Lay, Tien Giang Province, 
Vietnam, near the scene of the desperate battle 
in November 1967, is quiet today

I
t is the morning of Wednesday,  
13 September 1961, and a handful  
of Irish UN soldiers are assembling  
for their daily church service in a mining 
town in central Africa. Although many 
have never left Ireland before, they have  
arrived in the newly established Republic  
of the Congo to prevent the country from 
descending further into a bitter civil war. 
The Irish Army personnel of ‘A’ Company, 
35th Battalion are inexperienced, but they are 
about to receive a rude awakening. The mining 
town is in the heart of rebel territory in the 
breakaway state of Katanga and 156 Irishmen 
are surrounded by thousands of unfriendly 
inhabitants, armed militias and formidable 
mercenaries. As the Mass is held, hostile forces 
in trucks ﬁre shots at the compound. Within  
a few hours, a full-scale siege is underway. 
The mining town in question is a place that 
has been controversial ever since: Jadotville. 
The siege that took place here was borne out  
of extremely complex political circumstances 
and concluded in cover-ups at the highest 
levels. Nevertheless, the actual facts about  
the ﬁve-day battle are remarkable. None of  
the 156 members of A Company were killed 
during the siege and the UN troops managed 
to inﬂict hundreds of casualties on their 
numerically superior enemy. 
By any measure, this was a remarkable feat 
of arms. The soldiers, however, were effectively 
abandoned by the UN High Command and 
eventually forced to surrender. The troops 
subsequently received a cold reception when 
they were released from captivity. Both the  
Irish Army and the UN covered up the incident 
and veterans from Jadotville were unfairly  
made scapegoats for decades afterwards. 
Nevertheless, one veteran called John 
Gorman decided to take matters into his 
own hands. Gorman had been a 17-year-old 
private in 1961, but later led the campaign 
to rehabilitate the men of Jadotville as the 
courageous soldiers that they truly were.  
Today, largely thanks to Gorman’s efforts,  
the siege is now recognised as one of the  
most heroic and wrongfully forgotten stories 
in Irish military history. Gorman is still 
campaigning for his fellow veterans and  
tells a remarkable story of heroism, captivity, 
viliﬁcation and the long road to restored honour. 
An inexperienced force
Born in 1944, Gorman joined the Irish Army 
aged only 15, but by the time he heard about 
the growing crisis in the Congo, he was a fully 
trained and enthusiastic soldier. “I joined the 
army on 22 June 1959 and I went into my 
recruit training, which would have lasted about 
six months. Then you do a three-star course 
that makes you a fully qualiﬁed soldier and  
I was at home on leave when I heard about the 
Congo. I cancelled my leave – I didn’t say why – 
PART I : THE TEENAGE PEACEKEEPER
and went back to Athlone and volunteered  
for the Congo. At that time you would have 
had two or three volunteer battalions because 
everyone was so mad to get out there! I didn’t 
get out until June 1961.”
Fledgling peacekeepers like Gorman knew 
little of the political complexities before his 
deployment. “I was 17 years old at the time and 
knew absolutely nothing. The only thing I knew 
about Africa was bringing a penny into school 
for the babies out there and that was all.” 
Even the reasons for his deployment were not 
adequately explained. “We were not given any 
reasons really, just that there was trouble out 
there and we were going to sort it out.” 
Peacekeeping was a new concept in the early 
1960s and, although Gorman was proud to 
serve in the UN, the Irish Army’s inexperience 
and poor equipment was evident, “I did take 
pride in it, but we went out in really heavy Irish 
Army uniforms from WWII. We were issued out 
there with blue ‘helmets’, which were actually 
just the liners for the helmets and they just had 
‘UN’ on them. We were all young lads and it 
was new to us in a huge way. We’d never seen 
anything like this before and for around 95 per 
cent of us, it would have been our ﬁrst time 
even out of Ireland. The Yanks who ﬂew us  
out there were laughing at our old uniforms and 
I saw them loading these Jeeps and armoured 
trucks into the belly of the plane. I thought, 
‘How in God’s name is this going to get off  
the ground?’ But eventually we did.” 
Deployment to the Congo
The Congo is approximately the size of Western 
Europe and it was impossible for the UN’s 
force of around 20,000 men to cover all areas 
of conﬂict in secessionist Katanga, let alone 
the entire country. They also faced formidable 
opposition from Katanga’s breakaway security 
force, known as the “gendarmerie”, which 
was a militia made up of local tribesmen and 
commanded by white mercenaries. 
Nicknamed “mercs” by the Irish, the 
formidable mercenaries were primarily 
Belgian and French ofﬁcers and NCOs within 
the gendarmerie who were battle-hardened 
veterans of WWII and colonial conﬂicts. The 
native population ominously referred to them  
as “les affreux” (“the terrors”). 
The gendarmeries were headquartered at 
the Katangan capital of Elisabethville (now 
Lubumbashi) but Gorman recalls that the UN 
had no problem from the local population. “The 
ordinary population were fairly OK, but it was the 
mercenaries and their friends in the gendarmerie 
that were the problem. As you can imagine, the 
mercenaries restrained the gendarmerie pretty 
well because they were top soldiers – otherwise 
they wouldn’t have been out there.”
A Company was soon kept busy. “There were 
a few operations carried out before we went 
to Jadotville. Operation Rum Punch was the

He later wrote, “It is a pity that we, who never believed  
in the use of force, must suffer for the blunders of  
little dictators and stupid military leaders. We did not 
come here to shoot Africans, we came to help them…  
I was not prepared to let my men die for nothing”

taking over of the gendarmerie headquarters in 
Elisabethville. We took that over on an August 
morning at 4am. Our task was to get in, take it 
over and let no word get out to the mercenaries. 
We were aiming to capture them all and we did.”
Hundreds of mercenaries had been 
captured but the UN Special Representative 
in the Congo, Conor Cruise O’Brien (who 
by coincidence was also an Irishman) was 
persuaded by Belgian diplomats to release 
them. The situation was not properly explained 
to A Company and Gorman believes it created 
later problems. “The operation went very well 
and we then took the airport in Elisabethville.  
I didn’t think the mercenaries were going to 
leave but there was some dispute with O’Brien 
about letting them go again. If they did leave, 
they were back in action twice as quick to start 
what ended up being the battle at Jadotville.”
Gunﬁre at Mass
After Operation Rum Punch, A Company’s 
next assignment was a posting to Jadotville 
(now Likasi), which was 80 miles north of 
Elisabethville. Their task was to protect the 
white settlers there from a potential massacre, 
but circumstances suggested otherwise. 
Jadotville was a thriving copper mining town 
whose population composed of native miners 
and a substantial white community of engineers 
and merchants. Both communities were broadly 
in support of Katangan independence, while 
the white population in particular sought to 
preserve their commercial interests.
Consequently, the UN was unwelcome, as 
Gorman explains. “We were dug in around the 
airport in Elisabethville and two companies had 
gone into Jadotville: a Swedish company and the 
Irish B Company. They wanted to leave because 
of the hostility towards them so they were taken 
out. The Swedes left ﬁrst and then B Company 
left. We actually saw some members of B 
Company coming out when we were on our  
way in and they were waving at us. Little did  
we know the trouble we were going to walk into!”
The Irish had been given little transport 
and were forced to leave some of their 
ammunition and supplies behind as they drove 
into Jadotville, “We were underequipped and 
unprepared. Everything we had was WWII 
equipment except the FN riﬂes. We went to the 
Congo with Lee Enﬁeld .303 riﬂes and issued 
with FN riﬂes out there. That’s all we had: a few 
anti-tank guns, one or two 60mm mortars and 
Bren and Vickers guns.” 
The commander of A Company, Commandant 
Patrick ‘Pat’ Quinlan, immediately recognised 
the hostile situation and equipment shortage. 
He ordered his men to dig trenches at night 
around their encampment on the outskirts of 
Jadotville. “The mercenaries were patrolling 
every hour past our camp and I remember our 
company commander saying to us, ‘Just act 
normal, as if you’re sitting out in the sun.’

We dug our trenches at night so they did not 
know that we had any positions [prepared].”
Gorman remembers that the Irish defence at 
Jadotville was efﬁcient. “There were only 156 of 
us in total, but we were so well organised and 
dug in. All the trenches were ﬁve-foot deep and 
some had a little step-up in them so that you 
could step up a bit higher. We were very well 
prepared for a bunch of young Irish lads that 
had never been out of the country before – it 
was just amazing.”
On Wednesday, 13 September 1961, the 
majority of A Company was attending a church 
service when shots rang out. “We were at 
Mass at about 7.30am when three small horse 
wagon trucks came up the road and just swung 
into the camp as if they would take it over. But 
(Sergeant) John Monaghan wasn’t at Mass. He 
was shaving and came out with a towel around 
his neck. When he saw what was happening 
he jumped into the Vickers machine gun trench 
and ﬁred three or four bursts over their heads. 
They turned their trucks around and got out of 
there damn quick, but then a couple of hours 
later all hell broke loose.” It was the beginning 
of ﬁve days of intense combat. 
Besieged but brilliantly led
Unknown to A Company, the sudden 
gendarmerie attack had been provoked by 
a major UN operation that morning called 
‘Operation Morthor’. UN units had been 
instructed to take over Katanga and reunite 
it with the rest of the Congo, but the action 
provoked the Katangans into open warfare. 
Astonishingly, Quinlan was unaware of 
Morthor’s existence, as Gorman recalls, “We 
were going into Jadotville as part of Operation 
Morthor, but our company commander didn’t 
“QUINLAN PROMISED THE FAMILIES WHEN WE WERE GOING  
OUT THAT HE WOULD BRING EVERY MAN HOME, AND HE DID.  
HE WAS JUST AN OUTSTANDING GUY”

The early 1960s were one of the most dangerous 
periods of the Cold War, when the world was 
teetering on the edge of catastrophe. In 1961 
alone, construction began on the Berlin Wall and 
the Bay of Pigs Invasion accelerated the tensions 
that would manifest into the Cuban Missile Crisis 
the following year. However, an equally dangerous 
situation had developed in the Congo, which had 
global ramiﬁcations. 
In 1960, the Belgian Congo became an 
independent republic, but the new country was 
immediately faced with civil war. The provinces of 
Katanga and South Kasai seceded with Belgian 
support and when violence erupted, the United 
Nations deployed peacekeepers – including two 
battalions of the Irish Army – to restore order. 
The peacekeeping force was known as the 
‘Organisation des Nations Unies de Congo’ (ONUC), 
but the UN secretary-general Dag Hammarskjöld 
initially refused Congolese prime minister Patrice 
Lumumba’s request to use them against the 
breakaway Katangans. Hammarskjöld wanted the 
ONUC to act as a quasi-police force that would 
integrate, rather than force, the Katangans to remain 
part of the Congo. Lumumba eventually turned to the 
Soviet Union for assistance, but this led  
to his assassination in February 1961. 
One of the men believed complicit in the 
assassination was Katangan leader Moïshe 
Tshombe, who subsequently used Lumumba’s 
Soviet associations to attempt to discredit the 
Congolese government. The UN was now involved 
in a dangerous situation, and its troops came 
under increasingly heavy attack. Nine Irish soldiers 
had already been killed in Katanga during the 
‘Niemba Ambush’ in November 1960. 
Katanga was a global source of minerals, 
including large quantities of diamonds, 10 per cent 
of the world’s copper and 60 per cent of global 
cobalt supplies. Most worryingly for the UN, the 
province produced almost half of the metals needed 
for Western military equipment and was also the 
location of numerous uranium mines, which were 
crucial for the manufacture of nuclear weapons.
Such valuable resources meant that the Congo 
was now a battleground between the Cold War 
powers and the crisis would continue until 1965. 
Nevertheless, despite a subsequent dictatorship  
that lasted until the late 1990s, Katanga remained  
a part of the Congo.

know that he was part of it – the ofﬁcers were 
told not to tell him. He discovered ﬁve minutes 
before the trouble broke out. Just ﬁve minutes 
– it’s not long.”
A Company was now surrounded by 2,000 
to 4,000 mercenaries and gendarmeries, while 
many white townspeople also assisted the 
attack. Heavy ﬁghting broke out from 11.30am 
with the Katangans deploying mortars and 
machine guns. It was Gorman’s ﬁrst experience 
of intense combat, but he was conﬁdent in his 
superiors. “We had great men. I always say to 
people, ‘When you’re young, you don’t know 
fear as older people would.’ You couldn’t see 
the fear that you now see through older eyes, 
but we had great leadership. I must say our 
company commander, the late Commandant 
Pat Quinlan, was an absolutely outstanding 
man. We also had a company sergeant Jack 
Prendergast who was straight as a die but my 
God was he a good soldier. He was a star.” 
Their conﬁdence inspired the young soldiers. 
“We took guidance from the older people and 
saw that they weren’t afraid so we weren’t going 
to be afraid either. It was their ﬁrst time as 
well, but their leadership was just excellent. I 
couldn’t describe it any other way and I still think 
everyday just how they did it so successfully.” 
With few resources to hand, Quinlan’s plan 
was to break up enemy attacks at long range 
before they reached the thick bushes that 
surrounded the UN trenches. He was assisted 
“WHEN YOU SEE SOMEBODY GIVING 
YOU THE LAST RITES IN THE TRENCHES 
YOU THINK, ‘WELL, THIS IS IT’”

Godefroid Munongo, deputy to Katangan 
leader Moïse Tshombe, arrived at Jadotville 
and Gorman remembers the meeting. “We 
were out in the open and so were their lads. 
They probably had our positions taken over 
but Munongo came looking for our company 
commander and met him. I saw our commander 
just pacing up and down and Munongo told him 
he would have to surrender. That was during the 
ceaseﬁre, which was against everything that 
the Geneva Convention ever stood for.”
With virtually no supplies left, a highly 
reluctant Quinlan agreed to a ceaseﬁre  
on Sunday 17 September, but A Company 
would leave no weapons for the enemy.  
“We destroyed our heavy weapons such as  
the Bren guns and Vickers machine guns before 
we handed them in. We took the ﬁring pins out 
and buried them.” 
Quinlan was later severely criticised for his 
superiors for ‘surrendering’, an accusation that 
Gorman felt was entirely unjustiﬁed. “That was 
a laugh because it wasn’t a surrender. The way 
I looked at it then and today is that there was 
nothing more that Quinlan could have done 
unless he got us all killed and then he probably 
would have then been a ‘hero’. However, a 
British brigadier general later read the book 
Siege At Jadotville and said, ‘My God, if he was 
in our army he would be at the top rank and 
when he retired he would have been knighted’ 
Quinlan promised the families when we were 
going out that he would bring every man home, 
and he did. He was just an outstanding guy.” 
An uneasy captivity
The Siege of Jadotville had been a pyrrhic 
victory for the Katangans and mercenaries, 
about 300 to 400 of whom were killed and 
1,000 wounded. By contrast, A Company had 
had no fatalities and only ﬁve men wounded. 
Despite their inexperience, the Irish had 
tactically defeated their opponents and the 
high casualties they had inﬂicted soon became 
“WE HAD GREAT LEADERSHIP. I MUST SAY 
OUR COMPANY COMMANDER, THE LATE 
COMMANDANT PAT QUINLAN, WAS AN 
ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING MAN”
THE SIEGE OF JADOTVILLE
by able soldiers who manned the inadequate 
60mm mortars. “We had great mortar men.  
We had a mortar sergeant who was reckoned to 
be one of the best mortar men in any army, so 
much so that we were calling him ‘Hawkeye!’” 
Over the next few days Gorman fought a 
relentless battle in the trenches and relied 
heavily on his Bren gun. “I always found the 
Bren to be a great weapon because you could 
take down dozens of men in no time. With a 
riﬂe, it was automatic, but I found that the  
FN was better at single shots.” 
The mercenaries, however, began using 
a Fouga Magister jet ﬁghter to strafe the 
Irish trenches and drop bombs. “That was 
frightening. He used to hit us every morning 
and then go on to Elisabethville to hit the UN 
there. When he was coming back at night he 
would hit us as a last thing. He knew exactly 
where we were for the following morning but 
our company commander moved us down and 
we spent all night digging trenches. As soon as 
the jet came back the following morning, he hit 
exactly where he had the evening before, but 
we weren’t there.” 
With minimal food, water and equipment, 
Gorman had little time to recuperate and his 
meals were meagre. “When nightfall came, 
our company sergeant Jack Prendergast would 
come round with a bucket and spoons. He’d 
give you one or two spoons and I remember him 
saying something to me that I’d never forget, 
‘Well young Gorman, this is your ﬁrst dish in  
a trench,’ which was true. That was the way  
we carried on for ﬁve days.”
The gendarmeries and mercenaries began 
taking heavy casualties and started using 
dirty tactics. “At one point, they asked for a 
ceaseﬁre to pick up their dead and wounded 
and our company commander granted that. 
He said that the ceaseﬁre would be for four 
hours, but as soon as they had their dead and 
wounded picked up, they started ﬁring again  
so they broke the ceaseﬁre.” 
The ﬁghting became so intense that Gorman 
thought he might not survive, “Our chaplain 
Joseph Fagan gave us the last rites in the 
trenches, so that was a bit scary because 
you’re not expected to survive. He was a  
lovely man, but when you see somebody giving 
you the last rites in the trenches you think, 
‘Well, this is it.’ But thankfully it wasn’t.”
A reluctant ceaseﬁre
After days of ﬁghting, A Company was running 
extremely low on supplies and ammunition. 
Quinlan had consistently radioed for help and 
reinforcements but the two UN columns sent to 
relieve A Company were numerically insufﬁcient 
and were beaten back across the strategically 
important bridge at Luﬁra. The second column 
of Irish, Indian Gurkha and Swedish troops had 
to ﬁght their way back to Elisabethville and ﬁve 
Gurkhas were killed. Additionally, only one UN 
helicopter had been able to land among the 
garrison with water supplies, but the water was 
undrinkable thanks to the unwashed petrol cans 
they were transported in. A Company was now 
completely isolated and running out of time. 
If he were to prevent any of his men’s lives 
being lost, Quinlan had no choice but to begin 
negotiations with the Katangans for joint patrols 
around Jadotville. However, after previous 
broken ceaseﬁres, he was extremely cautious 
and received no support from his UN superiors. 
“When they didn’t get through our ﬁrst defence, 
they looked for another ceaseﬁre. Quinlan was 
wary of this and radioed the headquarters in 
Elisabethville. He was told there were ceaseﬁre 
talks going on in Elisabethville and that  
they were going very well.  
It was as much to say,  
‘Well if you don’t agree  
to this ceaseﬁre  
and something  
happens here  
in Elisabethville,  
you’ll be to blame.’”

apparent when A Company was taken into 
captivity. “During our handover they brought us 
down to this little village where there were only 
women and children. They were all shouting, 
wailing and crying and making signs that they 
were going to cut our throats. It was only 
afterwards that we discovered that we had 
killed 70 per cent of their husbands.” 
A Company was held in captivity in a prison 
camp in Kolwezi until late October 1961, when 
they were released as part of a UN prisoner 
exchange. According to Gorman, Quinlan had 
even scared his opponents in captivity. “We 
were made to empty out our kitbags when 
a 9mm round came out of (Private) Jack 
Peppard’s kitbag and the guard came round 
and hit him with a riﬂe. We were unarmed, 
of course, but our company commander ran 
straight for him, shook the shit out of him 
and said, ‘You don’t touch my men.’ I think 
they were as much afraid of Quinlan armed or 
unarmed! They were always very wary of him.”
The campaign for justice
Although A Company initially received a warm 
reception when they returned to Ireland 
before Christmas 1961, the Irish Army soon 
hushed up the incident due to the perceived 
embarrassment of Quinlan’s surrender. 
Veterans of the siege were subsequently given 
the derisive nickname of “Jadotville Jacks” 
within the army and the incompetence of the 
Irish and UN high command was covered up. 
One of those that Gorman holds mainly 
responsible for the ﬁasco surrounding Jadotville 
is the UN representative Conor Cruise O’Brien, 
“He didn’t come out of it very good at all. He 
was a civil servant and you never put a civil 
servant in a military man’s job in my opinion 
– he knew absolutely nothing about it. The 
UN secretary-general Dag Hammarskjöld had 
read a few things that O’Brien had written and 
nominated him for the job. Hammarskjöld was 
a good man, but he was killed in a plane crash, 
which created more lies. His reason for going to 
the Congo was to see what went on in Jadotville 
and the Congo, and I believe to ﬁre O’Brien as 
well. His death created more lies.”
Gorman believes that O’Brien deliberately 
covered up his mistakes. “O’Brien later wrote 
a book called To Katanga And Back. He had 
nothing to be proud of at Jadotville and just 
brushed over it slightly once, that’s all. He knew 
he couldn’t be proud of what had happened.” 
The silence surrounding Jadotville continued 
for decades until Gorman decided to set the 
record straight. “Years had passed and I’d 
always promised myself that they can’t get 
away with what they’ve done so I started a 
campaign. Everyone was telling me, ‘You’re 
mad, you’re never going to get anywhere with 
this,’ and that included a retired chief of staff, 
who said, ‘You’re making a fool out of yourself. 
You’re never going to get anywhere with this 
Jadotville thing because it was so tightly 
covered up.’ I said, ‘Well, maybe not but you’ll 
ﬁnd that I will sort it out.’ And I did, I did get 
places thank God.”
By the early 2000s, Gorman’s campaigning 
eventually came to the attention of the Irish 
minister of defence Willie O’Dea. “He phoned my 
house and asked me what went on in Jadotville 
and after we came home and I told him. I said, 
‘Is there anything more you’d like to know 
minister?’ and he said, ‘No, that’s enough.’ 
So I went and met him in Leinster House and 
discussed things with him. He was shocked  
that this was all covered up to save arses.”
Thanks to Gorman’s work, a government 
enquiry was commissioned in 2004 that 
cleared Quinlan and A Company of any charges 
of soldierly misconduct at Jadotville. Gorman 
had presented the veterans’ case to the 
highest echelons of the UN. “I wrote to Koﬁ 
Annan. He was visiting Ireland, so I wrote a 
three-to-four-page letter and emailed it to him 
so that he would have it before he arrived. 
I do believe that he said in his speech to 
the taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, ‘There is some 
unrest among your troops, would you put it 
right please?’ It was a big comedown for the 
hierarchy here to have to bend and show that

they were wrong, because if they were right, 
there was no way that we would have been 
getting anything. But they weren’t right,  
they were wrong.” 
Finally, in 2005, a commemorative stone 
for the soldiers of Jadotville was unveiled at 
Custume Barracks, Athlone and the veterans 
received a scroll for their service. Sadly, Quinlan 
did not live to see this public rehabilitation as 
he had died in 1997, but a portrait of him now 
hangs in the Congo Room at Curragh Camp. 
In 2016, Netﬂix released a feature ﬁlm called 
The Siege Of Jadotville and there was another 
commemorative ceremony to formally recognise 
the soldiers bravery at Custume Barracks. 
Although Gorman is pleased with the 
attention that Jadotville is now receiving, the 
feelings are bittersweet. “Had they done the 
right thing, there would have been no campaign, 
no ﬁlm, no books. There’s been about seven

In June 2017, the Irish government 
announced that a special medal would 
be awarded to the soldiers that fought at 
Jadotville, but Gorman wants no stone left 
unturned. “I actually said, ‘I want to see the 
medal before it’s struck and mostly I want to 
see what’s going to be on it.’ At this point in 
time we’re not just going to take any old medal 
that would just satisfy them and not satisfy us. 
They’re on the run now.” 
The veterans of Jadotville have come a long 
way since their frightening ordeal in 1961 and 
their subsequent mistreatment. Nevertheless, 
Gorman is clear that more still needs to be 
done, not just for the now ageing band of 
surviving veterans, but also for their families, 
“A lot of the veterans were sickened by what 
happened and got very emotional about it, 
and some of them still are. The families of the 
deceased members also worry me because they 
should get an apology from the government for 
what was done. Their fathers and brothers went 
to their graves branded as cowards. Surely it’s 
not too much to stand up and apologise after all 
of this? If I do something wrong to somebody,  
I will go and apologise. That’s the manly thing to 
do. But then, is there a man in the government? 
For want of a better word, they’re dead now and 
they should realise that.”

A
fter World War II, the British 
Army sought a tracked armoured 
personnel carrier that would in 
fact be its ﬁ rst such purpose-
built vehicle. Success was not 
immediate, and numerous prototypes were 
considered before ultimately being disqualiﬁ ed.  
By the late 1950s, however, the Fighting Vehicle 
Development Division of contractor GKN Sankey, 
later BAE Systems Land Systems, delivered 
four prototype and 10 trial vehicles that had 
originated within its unarmoured FV420 Light 
Tracked Vehicle group for evaluation.  
The Army’s replacement for the Alvis FV603 
Saracen wheeled armoured personnel carrier 
was accepted in 1962, and the ﬁ rst production 
vehicles in the new FV430 series, which 
included numerous variants, rolled off assembly 
lines the following year. The most prominent 
of these was the Saracen’s successor, the 
FV432 armoured personnel carrier. Production 
continued until 1971, with approximately 3,000 
examples of the FV432 being completed. 
The FV432 accommodates a crew of 
two with capacity for ten combat loaded 
infantrymen. Notable variants include the 
FV433 Abbot self-propelled gun, which mounts 
a 105mm L13A1 gun in a fully traversing turret; 
the FV434 tracked maintenance carrier, with 
a crew of four and a hydraulic crane with a 
lifting capacity of 3,050 kilograms, or slightly 
more than three tonnes; the FV435 Wavell 
communications vehicle; the radar-equipped 
FV436 command and control vehicle; an 
ambulance version with a capacity of up to 
four stretchers; and the FV439 signals vehicle. 
While numerous armoured vehicles have been 
planned as replacements for the FV432 and 
related models, particularly the FV510 Warrior, 
which made its debut in the early 1980s and did 
succeed it as the Army’s primary troop carrier in 
1988, the FV432 series has undergone several 
upgrades. As many as 1,500 still remain in 
service in support roles, as powerplant and 
armour revisions have kept the type operational 
for more than half a century.

While some FV432 models have been produced 
with petrol and diesel engines, the primary 
powerplant is the 240-horsepower Rolls-Royce 
K60 multi-fuel engine. Introduced in the early 
1960s as a joint development project between 
Rolls-Royce and the Fighting Vehicle Research 
and Development Establishment of the War 
Ofﬁ ce, the K60 was originally touted as the 
equivalent of a 168-horsepower diesel engine 
and drives the FV432 at a maximum road 
speed of 32.4 miles or 53.2 kilometres per 
hour paired with a TX-200-4A semi-automatic 
transmission. The opposed piston, twin 
crankshaft, two-stroke engine proved reliable in 
extremes of temperature and climate and was 
later engineered for use in commercial vehicles.

FV432 ARMOURED PERSONNEL CARRIER
ARMAMENT
The primary weapon of the FV432 armoured 
personnel carrier is the 7.62mm L7 general-
purpose machine gun. Based on the Belgian 
FN MAG system with only minor changes, 
the L7 is capable of a rate of ﬁ re up to 1,000 
rounds per minute with an effective range of 
1,800 metres. The mount for the L7 is located 
on the forward section of the commander’s 
cupola, and the vehicle carries 1,600 rounds 
of belted ammunition. Royal Ordnance was 
the original producer of the L7, however, the 
weapon is now made by German manufacturer 
Heckler & Koch. Command vehicles are also 
likely to carry the Bren 7.62mm light machine 
gun along with 50 magazines of ammunition 
totalling 1,400 rounds.

INTERIOR
The interior of the FV432 incorporates the 
driver’s position forward and to the right.  
The commander sits directly behind the 
driver and is able to survey the surrounding 
ground through a cupola with 360-degree 
traverse and a trio of AFV No. 32 Mark 1 day 
periscopes. The commander also operates 
the cupola-mounted L7 machine gun. The 
engine is positioned to the left of the driver 
with an air intake forward and exhaust pipe 
exiting the hull on the left side. The troop 
compartment is located at the rear of the 
vehicle and allows 10 combat-ready soldiers 
to be seated on benches along the sides.

Although its induction to the British Army dates back to 
the Cold War, the FV432 armoured personnel carrier has 
managed to maintain a presence within the military well into 
the 21st Century, due partially to its versatile hull structure 
and quick conversion to multiple roles, through the use of 
“installation kits” that allow minor modiﬁ cations to be rapidly 
accomplished. While some FV432 systems are no longer 
supported and components have become obsolescent, the 
vehicle served its main purpose from introduction in 1963 
until it was replaced, in 1988, by the FV560 Warrior as the 
primary armoured personnel carrier of the British Army.  
By the late 1990s, most military analysts expected 
the FV432 to be fully retired by 2014, but in 2005 it was 
announced that the vehicle’s service life would extend to at 
least 2020. Plans to relieve the FV432 of its duties entirely 
were shelved as upgrades have continued. Early production

DESIGN
The FV432 bears a striking resemblance to 
the contemporary American M113 armoured 
personnel carrier. The FV432 hull, however, is 
constructed of welded steel, while its counterpart’s 
is of lighter welded aluminum. The steel hull provides 
signiﬁ cant protection against enemy small-arms ﬁ re 
and shell fragments. While there are no gun ports, 
the FV432 is constructed to allow a complement of 
10 combat troops to exit the vehicle and 
establish defensive positions 
swiftly through 
a large rear door.

vehicles were designated as Mark 1, while those with the 
Rolls-Royce K60 multi-fuel engine were known as the 
Mark 2, some of which were equipped with NBC (Nuclear, 
Biological, Chemical) defence systems. In 2002, BAE 
Systems Land Systems introduced an upgrade that 
included a 250-horsepower Cummins B-series six-cylinder 
turbocharged diesel engine and a lighter powerplant that 
allowed for the installation of more protective armour. 
Other modiﬁ cations were made to the transmission, 
and the driver’s tillers were replaced with a yoke steering 
system similar to that of the Warrior. The ﬁ rst of these 
upgraded FV432s reached the Army in 2006.
During the course of its service, the FV432 has been 
deployed with British troops around the world, including 
the Balkans, Operation Desert Storm, the 2003 invasion 
of Iraq, and the subsequent ﬁ ghting against insurgents 
in Afghanistan. During the latter deployments, the FV432 
was found vulnerable to enemy IEDs (improvised explosive 
device) and RPG (rocket-propelled grenade) ﬁ re. Heavier 
armour protection was installed, and the variant was 
dubbed the Mark 3 ‘Bulldog’.

PETER SNOW AND ANN MACMILLAN HAVE WRITTEN A HIGHLY READABLE BOOK ABOUT 
INDIVIDUAL ACTS OF HEROISM AND HUMANITY ACROSS VARIOUS CONFLICTS
Author: Peter Snow & Ann MacMillan Publisher: John Murray Publishers Price: £25 Released: 21 September 2017
WAR STORIES
GRIPPING TALES OF COURAGE, CUNNING AND COMPASSION
War Stories is a fascinating account of ordinary men and women swept 
up in the turbulence of war who rose to the challenges of conﬂict with 
great acts of heroism and courage. 
The book is written by the highly respected broadcaster and journalist 
Peter Snow and his wife Ann MacMillan, who also worked extensively 
in broadcasting and journalism and is the great-granddaughter of David 
Lloyd George. Their combined approach to the content has produced an 
intimate and varied account of fascinating stories of people at war that 
spans four centuries and four continents. 
34 individuals are featured in the book and include Edward Seager, 
who survived the Charge of the Light Brigade, Krystyna Skarbek, who 
was a spy and saboteur during WWII, and Magdalene de Lancey, who 
nursed her dying husband at the Battle of Waterloo. As well as historical 
ﬁgures from the distant past Snow and MacMillan have also interviewed 
living heroes and survivors of war. These include Corran Purdon, who was 
a commando during the ‘greatest ever raid’ on St Nazaire in 1942, Mike 
Sadler, who is one of the last surviving founding members of the SAS 
during WWII, and Ahmed Terkawi, who was forced to escape from Syria 
between 2012-15. 
The book is highly accessible to readers looking for speciﬁc topics 
and is split into helpful sections of interest such as ‘Special Forces’, 
‘Spies and Intelligence’, ‘Couples’ and ‘Compassion’, amongst others. 
Each story is neither too long or too short and leaves the reader wanting 
to know more about these fascinating individuals. War Stories is a very 
engaging and recommendable work that is well paced and contains 
an underlying fascination with how seemingly ordinary people react in 
extraordinary circumstances.

A DISTURBING LOOK INTO THE STRUGGLE FOR IRISH INDEPENDENCE
THE TWELVE APOSTLES
91
A story as complex as Ireland’s quest for 
independence needs to be told from both sides. 
In fact, there are more than two sides, with both 
British and Irish actions and reactions inﬂuenced 
by multiple viewpoints on either side of the Irish 
Sea – there was no single opinion in either camp.
Tim Pat Coogan tackles the Irish side of 
the struggle, focusing on the formation of ‘the 
Squad’, a group of assassins also known as 
the Twelve Apostles. Coogan is up front about 
the fact that Michael Collins, the revolutionary 
leader who set up the band of hit-men, can be 
viewed as either a freedom ﬁghter or a terrorist, 
depending on your viewpoint, but from the ﬁrst 
sentence of this book it is clear how important 
a ﬁgure Coogan believes him to have been: “It 
is my contention,” Coogan writes, “that Michael 
Collins was one of the most extraordinary men 
ever to have been born in Ireland.” Having 
previously written a biography of Collins, Coogan 
is well placed to pass judgement.
It remains a fact, however, that for a British 
reader the book is often an uncomfortable read. 
The early days of the Irish Republican Army are 
inevitably overshadowed by what the organisation 
morphed into, with the bombing of ‘soft targets’, 
including shopping centres, repulsing most 
observers. Even the early days of the organisation 
were marked by the appropriation of goods with 
a note reading ‘Taken in the name of the IRA’ the 
only payment, and assassination of targets freely 
acknowledged to be good and decent men.
But the book is also uncomfortable for the 
detail it provides of British actions, including 
executions, brutality, intimidation and arson. 
A brief book review is no place to get into the 
endless intricacies of a subject as multifaceted 
as this. What can be said without doubt is that 
Coogan is a highly gifted writer who tells an 
engrossing story packed with insight and, in many 
cases, personal experience. He interviewed many 
of the key ﬁgures in the story and clearly has an 
intimate understanding of the period in question.
As well as detailing the formation of the 
Twelve Apostles (a somewhat misleading 
name because there were often more or fewer 
members of the squad), Coogan gives an 
accessible account of the build-up to violence, 
and if his work has a distinct Irish bias that is 
understandable – and there have been plenty 
of works on the subject with a British bias. 
Coogan’s rattling pace, and the fairly modest 
length of the book, mean that the reader can 
gallop through it in a very short time, but that 
does not mean it is lightweight. Based mainly 
on Coogan’s research for his earlier biography 
of Collins, it has been supplemented by 
recently released documents to give a fuller 
understanding of a painful and inﬁnitely complex 
period in British and Irish history.
Uncomfortable reading it may be, but is also 
powerful and, at times, genuinely shocking.

BATTLE FOR ANGOLA

THE END OF THE COLD WAR IN AFRICA c1975–89
REVIEWS
This is a puzzling book. Initial impressions 
are good – it is hefty, packed with text and 
photographs and clearly the product of a vast 
amount of inside information and ﬁrst-hand 
knowledge. Once the reader ventures inside, 
however, problems become apparent.
Venter, a veteran writer with many publications 
to his credit, fails to deﬁne parameters for his 
book, resulting in a sprawling, unmanageable 
work. Even the choice of paper is eccentric, with 
the type of glossy stock generally reserved for 
photographs used throughout.
The introduction seems not to have been 
given even the most cursory edit, being littered 
with tortuous sentences which sometimes 
change tense midway through. Pushing through 
the book quickly starts to feel like hacking 
through dense jungle.
Bafﬂingly, the author chooses to start his 
ﬁrst chapter with a detailed account of a battle 
that took place in 1994, despite the date range 
speciﬁed in his own title. Anybody unfamiliar 
with this conﬂict is left wondering if this is a 
mistake, until the year 1994 pops up again, 
in the next chapter. Venter is ungenerous with 
dates throughout the book, starting many 
chapters with quotes that do not bear a time 
stamp, which might allow the reader to put 
them in some sort of context. 
Civil wars and 
insurgencies are inevitably 
chaotic and confused 
affairs, but Venter has 
made little effort to guide 
his reader, presenting this 
conﬂict in a manner almost 
as chaotic as the actual 
events themselves.
Chapter 14, for example, 
is titled ‘Civil War: The 
Start’. It seems a strange 
point, 220 pages into the 
book, to talk about the

start of the civil war, but it ﬁts in well with the 
seemingly random arrangement of chapters that 
precede and follow it. 
The problem is summed up by the blurb 
on the dust jacket, which proclaims that the 
author ‘covers several ancillary uprisings 
and invasions, including the Herero revolt of 
the early 20th century; the equally troubled 
Ovambo insurrection, as well as the invasion of 
Angola by the Imperial German Army in the First 
World War.’ What events in the First World War 
have to do with the ‘The end of the Cold War in 
Africa c1975–89’ is not clear, and the events 
are not even presented chronologically.
These problems are a genuine shame, 
because it is clear the author knows what he is 
talking about, and there is wonderfully detailed 
information on offer here. A seven-page 
glossary, for instance, might ﬁll some readers 
with foreboding, but serves to demonstrate 
just how deep Venter’s knowledge is. He could 
and should be an authoritative guide to this 
sprawling conﬂict, but appears unable to pick 
out a coherent narrative thread to convince the 
reader he knows where he is going. The result 
is a difﬁcult, at times near-impossible book, 
which only the most dedicated of readers, or 
those with an unquenchable interest in this war, 
will be willing to persevere with for long.

THIS DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE 1961 SIEGE DURING THE CONGO CRISIS IS A POWERFUL STORY OF HEROISM AND INJUSTICE
HEROES OF JADOTVILLE
THE SOLDIERS’ STORY (2ND EDITION)
Author: Rose Doyle Publisher: New Island Books Price: £15.95 Released: Out now
In recent years the 1961 Siege of Jadotville has 
come to wide attention thanks to campaigning 
by veterans and the release of a Netﬂix motion 
picture in 2016. It is a compelling tale of how 
156 Irish UN peacekeepers inﬂicted hundreds of 
casualties against thousands of Katangan rebels 
and mercenaries during the Congo Crisis without 
incurring a single fatality. However, their superiors 
kept the harrowing experiences of the Jadotville 
veterans out of the public eye for decades in a 
notorious episode of military injustice. 
The commander of A Company during the siege 
was Commandant Patrick ‘Pat’ Quinlan. Quinlan 
was a brilliant soldier who kept all of his men alive 
during the siege through a combination of discipline, 
initiative and tactical ﬂair and then doggedly 
protected them during a tense captivity. Although 
Quinlan died in 1997 his niece Rose Doyle has 
written a full account of the siege with extensive 
material support from his son Leo. 
First published in 2006, this second updated 
edition of Heroes Of Jadotville was released in 
2016 and contains substantial interviews, reports, 
journals and letters. The book is a deﬁnitive and 
highly detailed primary source for the siege, and 
Doyle does an excellent job in exposing how the  
Irish peacekeepers became pawns in an 
international struggle for control of secessionist 
Katanga and its mineral wealth. This is important 
for historians of the period, particularly with the 
knowledge that the event was deliberately covered 
up for decades at the highest levels. 
Despite its detail, the book is an engaging read 
and is considerably helped by Doyle’s passionate 
mission to bring the soldiers’ experiences to a 
wider audience. For anybody interested in both 
Irish military history and the Cold War this is 
essential reading. 
“THE BOOK IS A DEFINITIVE 
AND HIGHLY DETAILED PRIMARY 
SOURCE FOR THE SIEGE, AND 
DOYLE DOES AN EXCELLENT 
JOB IN EXPOSING HOW THE 
IRISH PEACEKEEPERS BECAME 
PAWNS IN AN INTERNATIONAL 
STRUGGLE FOR CONTROL OF 
SECESSIONIST KATANGA”

the scooter a good anti-guerrilla weapon
