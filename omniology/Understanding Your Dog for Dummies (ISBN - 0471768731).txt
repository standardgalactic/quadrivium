About the Authors
Stanley Coren is best known to the public for his popular books
on dogs and on general psychological issues. However, within the
scientific world, he’s also a highly respected scientist, a Professor
of Psychology at the University of British Columbia, and a Fellow of
the Royal Society of Canada. 
His engaging writing style and his broad knowledge about the
behavior of dogs and people have made his books The Intelligence
of Dogs, Why We Love the Dogs We Do, What Do Dogs Know?, How
to Speak Dog, The Pawprints of History, How Dogs Think, Why Do
Dogs Have Wet Noses?, and Why Does My Dog Do That? all best-
sellers. Roger Caras, President of the ASPCA, and himself a best-
selling author of dog books, noted “Stanley Coren has an incredible
gift — the ability to take the most complex matters and make it all
seem so simple and clear.” Perhaps this is why Coren was named
Writer of the Year by the International Positive Dog Training
Association and is a sought-after contributor to a number of
national dog and pet magazines, including Pets Magazine, Modern
Dog, AnimalSense, Dog and Puppy Basics, and AKC Gazette.
Many professional associations have recognized Coren’s work with
service dogs, and he’s received awards from several major police
dog organizations, including the California Canine Narcotic Dog
Association and the British Columbia Police Canine Association.
His work with and knowledge of dogs has often caught the atten-
tion of the media, and he’s been the subject of feature articles in
People Magazine, USA Today, Time Magazine, Maclean’s, US News &
World Report, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, San Francisco
Chronicle, Washington Post, and others. His affable manner has also
made him a popular guest with the broadcast media, and he’s been
featured on numerous television programs, including Oprah, Larry
King Live, Dateline, 20/20, Maurie Povich, Good Morning America,
Charlie Rose, and the Today Show. He currently hosts the national
TV series Good Dog! in Canada.
Sarah Hodgson, president of Simply Sarah Incorporated, has been 
a trainer of dogs and their people in Westchester, New York, and
Southern Connecticut for more than 20 years. She’s the author of
eight dog-training books, including Puppies For Dummies, Dog Tricks
For Dummies, Puppies Raising & Training Diary For Dummies, Teach
Yourself Visually Dog Training, You and Your Puppy (co-authored
with James DeBitetto), DogPerfect, 2nd Edition, PuppyPerfect, and
Miss Sarah’s Guide to Etiquette for Dogs & Their People. In addition,
Sarah has produced two videos, patented a dog training leash (the
Teaching Lead), and invented many other products to simplify the
shared lives of dogs and people.

Sarah is frequently featured as a dog training specialist on network
television, radio, and print media, including The New York Times,
NBC, CBS, Animal Planet (Disney syndicate), FOX, CNN, WOR,
Hollywood Pets, Parenthood magazine, and others. She has worked
with many famous persons’ dogs, including TV personality Katie
Couric, actors Richard Gere, Glenn Close, Chazz Palminteri, Chevy
Chase, and Lucie Arnaz; business moguls George Soros, Tommy
Hilfiger, Tommy Mottola, and Michael Fuchs; and sport greats
Bobby Valentine and Alan Houston.
In addition, Sarah is a behavior consultant and education facilita-
tor at the Adopt-A-Dog shelter in Armonk, New York, where she
holds training and socialization programs, conditioning each of 
the dogs within a fully decorated home environment before their
formal adoption. For more information on everything Sarah, visit
her Web site at www.dogperfect.com.
Sarah also writes a weekly column and balances all with her top
priorities: her family and pets!

Introduction
P
repare yourself for a journey into the mind of a dog! No matter
where you start in this book, each page illuminates some facet
of your dog’s life experience: from her unique personality, to how
and why she either focuses on your directions or spirals into an
independent cycle of what you may consider negative behavior.
Though scientific information is the backbone of understanding
your dog’s behavior, our book is a far cry from a boring read!
Upbeat and cleverly written, it brings science into the mainstream,
using language everyone can understand and relate to. When you
walk away from this book, your dog’s behavior will no longer be a
mystery — it will be common sense.
Another unique aspect of this book is that it seamlessly weaves two
schools of thought together. Stanley Coren, a behavioral scientist
who specializes in understanding how dogs think and act, meets
Sarah Hodgson, a dog trainer who specializes in changing dog
behaviors. Our union has been eye-opening for us, and we bring
this magic to you. This book offers something unique: a dog’s-eye
view of everything human. This book reveals how the grace and
willingness of puppyhood can either be nurtured to encourage
cooperative behavior patterns, or distorted, resulting in extreme
reactiveness, destruction, housesoiling, and so on. Whereas Stanley
explains a dog’s perception and experience, Sarah shows you how
to use this knowledge to better your communication with your dog
and immediately recognize a source of conflict or confusion.
Whether you’re picking up this book out of a simple love for dogs,
a drive to understand and communicate with your dog with more
insight, or a tested affection for a puppy that has matured in unpre-
dicted ways, we guarantee you’ll not be let down. In addition to
seeing the world from your dog’s perspective, you’ll develop an
appreciation for her as you gather a toolbox of techniques to train
your dog and/or repair misunderstandings. Be prepared to get
hooked on everything dog, and above all else, enjoy the ride!
About This Book
Everyone envisions a great relationship with their dog, as though
the outcome were guaranteed: Peaceful strolls, interactive play,
calming feelings generated by a pet that brings harmony to family
life and ails the angst of everyday life. If only it were as easy as
wanting it to be so.

If you’re feeling overwhelmed by the prospect of getting a dog or
queasy about your responsibility for the dog you’ve already com-
mitted to, you can relax. This book helps you recognize not only
why your dog behaves in the way she does, but in the most posi-
tive way to encourage her cooperation.
Conventions Used in This Book
We stuck to the following conventions throughout the book:
 To avoid any gender bias, we refer to dogs as both males and
females throughout the text. Except for anything that strictly
relates to behaviors that are specifically male or female, you
can be sure that the information applies to your puppy,
regardless of gender.
 Anytime we introduce a new or scientific term, we italicize it.
 Keywords in lists appear in boldface. Also, when we present a
list of steps to perform, the action you need to take is bold-
face as well.
 Web sites and e-mail addresses appear in monofont to help
them stand out in the text.
What You’re Not to Read
Though we’ve weaved together insightful information throughout
this book, you don’t need to scour each page to learn more about
your dog. After all, who has the time to read a nearly 300-page
book these days? Read one chapter at a time or use it as a refer-
ence throughout your dog’s life, knowing that every page you
digest will enhance your overall understanding of him and thus
improve your relationship.
Even as you read, you can skip bits if you’re pressed for time.
Sidebars (gray boxes of text) include interesting, but non-essential
information. The Technical Stuff and Just For Fun icons also con-
tain insightful, but not necessarily crucial, facts.
Foolish Assumptions
Here’s what we assume about you, our dear readers:
Understanding Your Dog For Dummies 
2

 You know your dog has four paws and a tail, and you love her
dearly.
 You either have a dog now, love dogs but don’t have one now,
or are about to get a dog.
 You don’t want to get your PhD in animal behavior, but desper-
ately want to know more about how your dog interprets life.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into five parts, each one having its own
insightful theme. Here’s a quick rundown.
Part I: The Fascinating World of Dogs
In this first part, you find out about your dog’s individual commu-
nication skills. Like teaching your language to a foreigner, we give
you the tools to understand your dog’s behavior and translate
your thoughts into Doglish, their natural language.
Part II: Embracing Your 
Dog’s Identity
Until you recognize that your dog, whether a mixed breed or pure-
bred, has a distinct identity that makes her unique, her behavioral
quirks can be puzzling — and, at times, frustrating. The first step in
understanding your dog is to respect the honorable task she was
originally bred for and to identify how these inbred impulses will
influence her personality and behavior. We also address the dra-
matic influence of your dog’s sensory experience, as well as the
emotional life and specific needs of a growing puppy. Finally, we
discuss the psychological needs of an aging dog, from the emo-
tional shock at her own physical and sensory decline, to diet sup-
plements that may help to slow the degenerative process.
Part III: Doggie Delinquency
Let the training begin! This part starts out examining the many
positive tools and techniques available to people who train dogs,
highlighting systems that are both effective and encouraging. If
your goal is to have a dog who not only listens to you, but enthusi-
astically chooses your direction over other impulses, the chapters
in this part point the way.

Part IV: Dogs Don’t Misbehave:
Misperceptions and Solutions
In this part, we target the array of frustrations most common to
dog owners, from housetraining a puppy to rehabilitating a fearful
or aggressive dog. Looking at each issue from your dog’s perspec-
tive, we help you see that what you may consider a problem is
often a simple case of misunderstanding, lack of exercise, or 
manageable stress.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Last but not least, we gather together the top-ten lists of the most
common misperceptions and ways to communicate silently. Enjoy!
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, you find icons that appear on the left side of
the page and that point out different types of information. Here’s a
list of the various icons you may encounter:
This icon highlights useful tidbits and helpful advice.
These friendly reminders won’t let any of the important information
slip by.
“Warning, Warning!” Need we say more?
This icon alerts you to facts and technical information that may
not be essential, but they’re interesting to know all the same.
Take note of this icon. Though it may not contain crucial details, it
does highlight a fun fact that’s good to know.

The neatest thing about this book is that you can jump in any-
where. It’s a no-rules reference for anyone who is getting or sharing
their life with a dog. Look to the table of contents, flip to the index,
or simply shut your eyes and open to any page. You’ll find great
topics to read about and new stuff to learn on every page.
Of course, this isn’t to say that you shouldn’t read our book cover
to cover, but it’s not a prerequisite! No matter where you start,
remember that, like children, your dog is a very unique and moti-
vated being who, above all else, wants to be involved in your life
experience.

Part I
The Fascinating
World of Dogs

In this part . . .
E
veryone who takes responsibility for a dog has a
vision of how they’d like their dog to act: from polite
to protective, from mellow to athletic, from interactive 
to aloof. The vision and reality, however, can sometimes
differ measurably. Suddenly, an adorable puppy morphs
into a maturing dog with thoughts of her own and manner-
isms that may not line up with anyone’s expectations.
In this part, you grow to appreciate your dog as a unique
individual, fully equipped by evolution and centuries of
selective breeding with her own set of ideals and inner
drives. This part gives you the understanding you need 
to enjoy, cope with, or change your life with your pet.

here is no greater gift you can offer your dog than to under-
stand her: to walk a mile in her paws. Though money can buy a
lot of dog biscuits and squeak toys, and those obedience classes
will encourage greater responsiveness to you, a lot more is going
on behind the scenes than the simple recognition of the command
“Sit.” This chapter starts you on the journey discovering the mys-
tery that is your dog.
Is Your Dog a Wolf 
in Sheep’s Clothing?
Well, yes and no. Though we go more in-depth in this part, suffice
it to say that dogs approached domestication at their own speed.
There was no cosmic moment when some brave young boy (or
girl), holding a wolf pup, approached their father and said, “Please,
Dad, can we keep it?” Domestication was a slow evolutionary
process that involved the gradual progression from curious wolves
that drew closer to our campfire, to the marked physical changes
that characterize dogs we know today.
People and dogs: Parallel evolution
Our relationship with dogs began during a time when survival was
our only focus. Centered on staying alive, dogs provided personal
protection and hunting assistance.

For eons, dogs and humans evolved in parallel: During the agricul-
tural era, we modified our selection process to produce dogs who
would cull the varmint population and others who would herd live-
stock. As kingdoms grew, massive dog breeds were shaped by a
process of manual selection to guard the castles and aid in wars.
And so on and so on until today, when there are more than 400 dif-
ferent dog breeds that populate our globe, all developed for partic-
ular tasks.
There is only one problem: Except for a few instances, any dog’s
special talents are rarely needed. But don’t tell your dog: It would
be too depressing. He thinks his abilities are still in high demand.
To know your dog, however, still requires you to understand his
original breeding, and respect that his genes are still guiding his
behaviors today. (For more on this topic, see Chapter 6.)
Personality
In Chapter 5, you discover how to identify your dog’s temperament
and how it shapes her understanding of the world you share. For
example, a dominant dog assesses everyone who enters, whereas a
timid dog hides under the table when the doorbell rings. Embracing
your dog’s personality helps you in your effort to orchestrate a
training program to normalize your life together.
Unlike people who learn by listening, your dog is much more attuned
to nonverbal communication, from how you hold your body (espe-
cially in moments of tension or stress) to where you focus your
eyes. Learning your dog’s language will help you understand her
behavior and be understood in kind.
If you consistently look at your dog, she may interpret your inter-
est as a need for leadership. Remember this little jingle: The more
you look at your dog, the less she’ll look to you.
Dog’s devotion to people was hard-wired upon domestication. Your
dog is the only species that will look to and take direction from
another species (that’s us) as if it was their own.
Sensory overload
To really consider life from your dog’s perspective, you need a new
nose. Dogs rely most heavily on their sense of smell to interpret
even the minor aspects of their surroundings, such as when another
animal may have passed through or even the stress hormone of a
visitor in your home.
Part I: The Fascinating World of Dogs 
10

In your dog, our strongest scent, sight, is blurred and limited. Your
dog can only recognize a limited range of colors and is more attuned
to the motion of an object than its particulars. Dogs don’t rely on
the recognition of fine details of objects, but rather they were born
to be hunters with the motto, “If it moves it might be food, and I’ll
chase and catch it!”
There is also a big difference in dog’s hearing abilities, which can
be traced to the evolution of our separate species. Humans are
more sharply attuned to the sound of other human voices, whereas
dogs are capable of hearing higher frequencies and fainter sounds.
Because dogs evolved from hunters, their hearing is more attuned
to the sounds that their potential prey might make.
In today’s society, your dog’s sensory strengths are rarely appreci-
ated. An apartment dog is admonished each time he alerts to the
sound of a footstep; hounds are scolded for getting into the trash;
and all breeds are reprimanded for chasing the family cat. In our
world, dogs are on sensory overload yet are expected to ignore
everything. In Chapter 7, you can experience the world from your
dog’s perspective and also find out about new tasks that are being
set for dogs that take advantage of their special sensory skills.
Age Influences
Whether you have a puppy or older dog, you can appreciate that
time and experience will make a difference in your dog’s behavior.
A young puppy, who is often interpreting many of life’s nuances for
the first time, watches your actions carefully and is influenced by
how you behave. An older dog, however, who has studied many
human responses, may be less influenced by your activities —
unless they’re unusual or unexpected.
In Chapter 8, our puppy chapter, we highlight the way a puppy’s
mind develops and the ideal lessons to introduce at every stage.
Further, we stress the critical importance of early socialization and
how encounters with various people and places can change your
dog’s life — forever.
Dogs age too quickly. Though many of their life processes mirror
ours, their timeline accelerates at ten times our rate. By age 3, your
dog is a mature adult, by 7 most have reached middle age, and by
10, many are heading into their twilight years. It’s a reality that
can’t be ignored or avoided.
In Chapter 9, you can find out how your dog’s internal processes
function throughout maturity and what you can do to ease their
Chapter 1: A Dog for Life: Dog Psychology 101 11

emotional adjustment. Like humans, physical changes are often
accompanied by feelings of defensiveness and fear.
Influencing Your Dog’s Learning
Dogs love to learn and feel connected to group activities. How you
develop as a teacher and translator directly affects their enthusi-
asm for learning and, in turn, for life. Think of each lesson and
highlighted word as though you were teaching a foreigner your lan-
guage. “Sit,” “Wait,” “Down,” and “Good” get lifted beyond mere
command status, to verbal directions that show your dog how to
act in everyday situations.
In Part III, we lay out all the tricks of the trade, exploring learning
influences and emotional responses. In addition, we help you make
sense of the different schools of thought about how to teach your
dog and compare the differences between them — for example,
shaping versus modeling.
There is no one approach to encouraging good behavior: Each dog
is unique and may respond better to one technique than another. A
clearly orchestrated attempt to educate yourself and understand
the different methods available will keep your training effort fresh
and alive. We also examine exactly how your dog assimilates new
information and how you may use this understanding to further
influence her behavior.
Though a dog can recognize up to 165 different directions, your
goals need not be so lofty. In Chapter 12, we outline six directions
that are most useful for navigating your life together (see Table 1-1).
After you have these directions firmly planted in your dog’s memory
bank, they form the foundation for controlling your dog’s behavior.
Their use reassures your dog of her place in your family and her
vital inclusion in your world. There is no greater gift you could
offer your dog than that.

Ain’t Misbehaving!
No matter how livid you feel when your dog disobeys you or dam-
ages prized possessions, you won’t influence her routines until you
sit down and listen to her side of the story. Sure, your half-eaten
shoes cost $95 dollars, but to your dog, its enticing aroma (per-
fume YOU) was impossible to pass by. In this section, we lead you
through the most common frustrations, from housebreaking to
anxiety-driven behavior and on to darker issues such as aggres-
sion, in our efforts to shape your ability to respond in a manner
that your dog understands.
Why dogs act out
Just as people do, many dogs act out when they feel misunder-
stood, restless, or needy. If you walk around claiming that your dog
is reacting out of spite, then, in your mind, her every reaction will
be tainted by that view, even though “spite” is not an emotion dogs
have. If you keep shouting “Bad dog!” every time your dog makes a
wrong move, what option does she have?
Dogs, like children, are motivated by what gets attention. However,
it often appears that dogs can’t differentiate positive attention
from negative. If an action gets a reaction — any reaction — it will
get repeated.
Furthermore, negative attention can be misperceived as being
rough play or confrontation. Thus, a dog who steals from the
counter may feel prize envy when her people react uproariously. A
smart dog will simply wait until their people have left the room,
and then (minus competition) carry the prize off to a more secluded
space.
Chapter 1: A Dog for Life: Dog Psychology 101 13

In Chapter 13, we examine how a dog learns to misbehave and just
what can be done to reverse this trend.
Dissecting daily frustrations
Though you may have a real issue with some of your dog’s behav-
ior, it’s unlikely that she does. Though a pee-stained carpet can
raise your blood pressure, from her point of view the carpet is just
as absorbent as the grass, and whether her accident was moti-
vated by need or distraction, she did what came naturally.
Now, don’t get distressed. We’re not suggesting that you must live
with a dog who urinates on the carpet, or jumps on company, or
chews your slippers, but recognizing that your dog’s behavior isn’t
motivated by spite, vengeance, or guilt can ease your frustration.
Chapter 13 addresses many of the most common complaints dog
owners have about living with their dog, including barking, chewing,
jumping, and housesoiling. Each behavior, though disruptive and
aggravating, may be a perfectly normal sign of a dog that has bonded
well and is trying to get along within the family unit. Although reor-
ganizing her outlook may require some effort and intervention, the
process usually takes less time and is less stressful than coping with
the current frustrations that have become status quo.
When reality bites: Inside 
canine aggression
Aggression is the one behavior that sets a red flag down on any play-
ing field. Though it’s sometimes perfectly understandable, dogs are
simply not allowed to bite human beings, unless of course they’ve
been trained to such ends or are legitimately defending their terri-
tory. Dogs who bite are excluded from activities, relinquished to a
shelter, or euthanized. Before your dog shows any signs of aggres-
sion, it is wise to understand what motivates him and do what you
can to prevent it, either with your dog or other dogs you meet.
Chapter 15 takes a look at the different types of aggression, noting
what may prompt such reactions. You also can discover what you
can do to prevent aggression when it first appears.
No book for home use can address the needs of a dog that is exhibit-
ing a full-blown aggressive response and threatening the safety of
family members. Although we give you the means to recognize the
nature of your dog’s behavior, and even some ways to deal with it, 
if your dog has seriously bitten someone, or is really scaring you
because he is threatening to bite, you must seek professional advice.

 Deciphering and dealing with hunting and chasing instincts
 Peeking into the sex life of dogs
O
ur goal in this chapter, and as a whole, in the entire book, is
to help you understand your dog from his vantage point: to
discover what it must feel like to be a dog and to understand your
role and capacities to shape your dog’s behavior after you’ve
developed empathy for his experience.
Your dog is not merely a four-footed person in a fur coat. Your dog
is also not a wolf in disguise. Though some proponents of dog psy-
chology emphasize the common ancestry between dog and wolf,
your dog is more than a tamed version of any of its wild descen-
dants, be it wolf, jackal, fox, coyote, or dingo. Your dog and these
other canine species do share a lot of characteristics, both in phys-
ical makeup and behavior, but then humans share a lot of physical
and behavioral characteristics with apes, which doesn’t mean that
we are apes (although we do know a guy that we have our suspi-
cions about).
Wolves and dogs are part of the larger group Carnivora (animals
that are meat eaters and mostly live by hunting). Though each has
a secondary classification specifying its distinctions, all are catego-
rized by biologists as canines and members of the same biological
family Canidae.
How Dogs Came to Be Dogs
If you were to line up all animals in the order in which they were
domesticated, you would see that dogs lead the pack. In fact, dogs

were brought into human’s circle well before they even knew how
to grow their own food.
Recent evidence, based on actual fossil substantiation, suggests
that dogs were domesticated between 14,000 and 17,000 years ago
which is much earlier than sheep (11,000 years ago) or cats (7,000
years ago). Domestication seems to have occurred at different
times in different places, with dogs first domesticated in Asia and
Russia, and then separately in the Middle East, Europe, and North
America.
In the beginning
Dogs and humans naturally formed an everlasting relationship.
Both species were hunters that lived and survived through a
dependency on a close-knit hierarchical group. The main advan-
tage humans had over canines, in fact, was the ability to learn and
reason. In comparison to others in the animal kingdom, canines are
intellectually advanced.
Although the wild ancestors of dogs were efficient and daring pack
hunters, they also scavenged when the opportunity arose. Scaven-
ging about human campfires proved fruitful and was certainly less
dangerous than hunting (especially if you usually hunted some of
the larger hoofed animals that could kick, gore, and hurt you).
When the opportunity regularly presented a free meal, wolf packs
would locate a nearby den and take advantage of these leftovers.
Such leftovers were often dumped just outside the camp or village
in heaps that archeologists call middens. For the wolves, middens
were a veritable buffet of free food that was being continually
renewed.
What sensible wolf would rather hunt when such easy pickings
were available? And perfectly happy to oblige, the humans appreci-
ated the value of having another species about that would make
use of their waste, thereby keeping their camp both varmint and
odor free.
Now perhaps if the relationship had just stopped there, no further
domestication would have occurred. However, humans and canines
share another important similarity—namely, both are territorial.
Wild canines came to view the area around the camp as their terri-
tory. As a result, when a threatening wild animal or a marauding
band of strangers came close to the encampment, the canines 
created a commotion. The noise gave enough warning for the
Part I: The Fascinating World of Dogs 
16

inhabitants of the camp to rally some form of defense, which was
especially useful at night. As a result of the vigilance of these
canines, the lives of the nearby humans became much safer.
First move, wolves
Domesticating dogs wasn’t simply a matter of some Stone Age
man’s finding a wolf pup and bringing it home where it would be
fed, sheltered, and treated like a dog. It may sound surprising, but
the first stages of domestication were probably done by the
wolves, themselves.
The only wolves that could benefit from discarded food were those
that could comfortably coexist with humans. If a particular wolf
was aggressive or threatening, he was simply killed by the human
residents as a matter of safety. This process began the genetic
elimination of the most destructive individuals. Animals that were
friendlier and less fearful could stay closer to the settlement. In
addition to free meals, such closeness provided them protection
from predators that preferred to avoid human contact. When these
friendlier canines began to interbreed, they ultimately generated a
race of animals that were much more dog-like. In these new ani-
mals, the genes for tameness were predominant.
Domestication takes more than simply taming a wild animal. A
tame animal allows a human to care for it and accepts human pres-
ence and control to some degree. A domesticated animal, however,
is genetically modified. Humans exert control over its breeding pat-
terns, which leads to an animal that is drastically different in both
physical appearance and behavior than its wild ancestors. Certainly,
no one would ever mistake a Pekingese or a bulldog for a grey wolf
based on what they look like and how they act.
Chapter 2: Understanding Your Dog 17
Don’t try to tame a wolf
Research shows that instantaneous domestication is just not possible. Researchers
have often tried hand feeding wolf puppies from birth and rearing them with a human
family, and the results have been far from satisfactory.
In virtually all the scientific studies, as the wolf cubs matured, they became more
wolf-like in their behavior: The previously “tame” cubs began to stalk and hunt farm
animals, other house pets, and even children, growing ever more socially dominant
and challenging their people for control. Although, as a puppy, such tame wolves
can learn basic obedience commands, they stop responding to them when they’re
adults and begin challenging the authority and status of humans. Many reports tell
of such supposedly domesticated wolves attacking and biting their handlers.

What happened next is best explained by some research done by
the Russian geneticist Dmitry K. Belyaev, who was trying to re-create
the domestication of dogs. He decided not to use wolves because, in
many areas, evidence suggests that domestic dogs have interbred
with wolves and any dog genes would contaminate the data. Instead,
he used another canine species, namely silver foxes. Also, because
silver fox fur is prized for making expensive garments, there was the
potential for some economic benefits if he could domesticate these
foxes and make them easier to raise on a farm.
The only form of genetic manipulation that Belyaev used was simi-
lar to what occurred naturally around prehistoric villages. He
looked for the animals that were the most tame — the least fearful
and aggressive. These animals were the only ones bred for succes-
sive generations. The most tame and friendly animals were bred
with other tame and friendly animals, and after only six genera-
tions, noticeable differences existed between the tame and wild
foxes. After 35 generations, this research created animals that
looked and acted so much like a dog that they could be sold as
pets and live in a human family. If you saw one of them walking
down a street, you’d most likely believe that you were looking at
some exotic breed of domestic dog.
What really happened to change a fox into a dog? Genetic changes
aren’t governed by a simple process. Because of the ways that our
chromosomes are constructed, it turns out that if you want to
change one specific feature genetically, you often end up changing
other characteristics as well. That is exactly what happened when
researchers began to breed foxes in a way that encouraged the
genes associated with friendliness and tameness. It happens that
these traits are linked to other genes so that selective breeding for
tameness actually changed Belyaev’s foxes physically and behav-
iorally. We now know that the resulting genetic mix actually changed
the timing and rate of physical and psychological development 
in these new “dogs” so that they physically appear more dog-like
as well.
Second move, humans
Because the wild canines hanging around the camp (see the pre-
ceding section) were more docile and friendly, some clever Stone
Age person realized that if these canines would protect whole
camps, why couldn’t one protect an individual hut? Protection at a
personal level. Hmmm. . . .
This development turned out to be a fortunate choice because, in
the end, dogs would demonstrate other behaviors that would help
keep early man (and his successors) alive, including

Ever hear the expression, “It’s a three dog night?” It came from
Newfoundland where people would often tuck a dog or two under
the covers to stay warm. Their expression was, “It’s so cold, you’re
gonna need three dogs to keep you warm tonight!” But using dogs,
whose body temperature is higher than humans, as a biological
heat source isn’t limited to this region of the world — all over the
globe dogs are used to keep us warm.
Perpetual puppies
In truth, what the domestication process accomplished was to
arrest dog development in a very puppylike state. In essence,
domestic dogs are the Peter Pans of the canine world.
Chapter 2: Understanding Your Dog 19
Which wild canines became dogs?
More than 30 different species of wild canines are candidates for the first animal
that humans domesticated into a dog, but which species did humans actually take
into their homes and make their closest animal companion?
DNA evidence suggests that the first wild canine that was domesticated was the grey
wolf, though other types of wolves and also jackals, coyotes, wild dogs, dingoes, and
even some varieties of fox got into the mix. As a result, any one dog may have a com-
bination of genes from all these various members of the canine family. Researchers
know this fact because domestic dogs can interbreed with any of these species (the
exception being some of the common fox species, such as the red fox, which have the
wrong number of chromosomes). The offspring from such matings are live, healthy,
and fertile, which is usually taken as evidence that they’re all the same species or,
according to evolutionary theory, at least have a relatively recent common ancestor.
This research suggests that the dog at your side may be some random mix of genes,
perhaps 40 percent wolf, 30 percent jackal, and 30 percent coyote, while another
breed may be 60 percent wolf, 10 percent jackal, 15 percent arctic fox, and 15 per-
cent dingo. No wonder so many different breeds have so many different physical
appearances, behavioral styles, and personalities.

Neoteny refers to certain features normally found only in infants
and young juveniles, but which in certain animals persist into
adulthood.
If you look closely at Figure 2-1, you may note that many of the
physical features of an adult domestic dog resemble those of a wolf
puppy more than those of an adult wolf. Figure 2-1 shows common
physical differences between wolves and dogs that come about
because of neoteny. As you move down the arrow, you move farther
away from adult characteristics and toward more puppylike fea-
tures. Notice that at the very bottom of the figure, you see sort of a
super puppylike dog whose features are even more immature than
those found at all in wolves — at least beyond a newborn pup.

In terms of relationships with dogs, however, the behavioral aspects
of neoteny are most important. Dogs keep a number of puppylike
behaviors that wolves lose as they mature. These puppy behaviors
are what make dogs fine companions, while the adult canine
behavior makes wolves so difficult to tame. Table 2-1 offers an
interesting look at what the adult wolf characteristics are like com-
pared to the wolf-puppy characteristics that you see in dogs.

Behavioral Traits Bred in the Bone
Though no one seriously worries that their pet dog will stalk, kill,
or eat their neighbor, many dogs still get busted for stealing the
roast off the countertop, chasing bicycles, or tipping over garbage
cans. Case in point: Although dogs have been domesticated, their
genetic heritage as hunting predators hasn’t completely disap-
peared. It has, however, as with many other aspects of canine
behavior, been modified in both strength and likelihood of occur-
rence. As in the case of neoteny, different breeds may show more
or less of these behavior patterns (see Chapter 6).
In wolves and other wild canine predators, the hunting sequence is
complete and balanced, with a fairly fixed sequence of behaviors
that occur during a hunt:
1. Searching
2. Stalking
3. Chasing
4. Biting
5. Grabbing
6. Killing
During the process of domestication, and then later by selective
breeding, humans have created specific breeds in which some or
all of these six steps have been changed in their strength — either
made stronger or weaker. Many of these dogs are so driven by
their genetically specified hunting instinct that merely enacting the
behavior is a sufficient reward in and of itself.
 The searching instinct in dogs used for narcotics detection or
search-and-rescue work must be strong enough to keep these
animals hunting for hours in the hope of finding their quarry.
A dog with little searching instinct won’t turn out to be a suc-
cessful detection or search dog.
Part I: The Fascinating World of Dogs 
22

 Chasing is strongest in the sight hounds, such as the grey-
hounds, and you can see the power of this instinct in a dog race.
 Herding dogs, such as Border Collies, use the stalking and
chasing aspects of their hunting instinct to control the move-
ment of sheep and other animals. However, they do not grab,
bite, or kill their charges.
 Corgis carry the behavior a bit further, all the way up to the
biting stage (Step 4) because they regularly nip at animals to
get them moving. Again, grabbing and killing is forbidden.
 Retrievers are expected to search, chase, and grab prey to
bring back to their human hunting companion. However, both
the strength of the biting and their killing instincts must be
toned down because the dogs must not damage the birds they
retrieve.
 In scent hounds, such as Beagles or Bloodhounds, the search-
ing component of their hunting instinct has been increased to
ensure a dedication to the detection, tracking, and finding of
quarry.
 Working terriers used to control rats or go after foxes have
only a weak searching instinct, but their chasing, biting, and
grabbing instincts are all present in full force.
 For some terriers, such as the Staffordshire Bull Terriers or
the American Pit Bull Terriers, the grabbing instinct has been
greatly amplified. These dogs were originally bred to be used
in bull baiting, a blood sport where they were placed in a pit
and required to restrain bulls by biting and hanging onto their
noses to bring them to their knees. Obviously, searching or
stalking was not needed in these animals, so those behaviors
were weakened.
Very often, strong hunting instincts go hand in hand with high
levels of energy and intensity in a dog. Lots of play with balls,
Frisbees, Kongs, or other toys is a good way to use up that energy
while at the same time activating your dog’s natural instincts to
chase, capture, or retrieve a moving object.
Curing the Dog with 
an Overdeveloped 
Chasing Instinct
In some dogs, the chase instinct is so strong that it becomes a
problem. Such dogs chase everything: cars, bikes, skaters, joggers.
Anything that moves seems like it may be prey and triggers the
Chapter 2: Understanding Your Dog 23

chasing component of the hunting instinct. Such behaviors aren’t
only annoying, but may be dangerous, such as when a dog chases
a car down the street and gets hit by a car or chases a person on a
bicycle, causing them to swerve and fall.
If your dog has a strong hunting instinct, you can take some
common-sense precautions to help keep him out of trouble:
 Always leash your dog when he is walking through fields or
yards containing livestock or near playgrounds with active
kids. Also, keep your dog on his leash in places where swiftly
moving vehicles, bikes, or skateboarders can instigate the
chase instinct.
 Don’t allow your dog to stray too far from you when out on
walks.
 Never leave your dog alone with small pets, such as rabbits
and hamsters, infants, toddlers, or small children.
The most general solution to problem chasing behavior involves
taking the dog’s attention away from the situation producing the
behavior and giving him a competing behavior that interferes with
the chase. Initially, the dog must learn a command, such as “Stop
it!”, to halt the chase and turn his attention to you.

How strong is your dog’s hunting instinct?
Are you living with a real predator? Here is a simple test that can help you judge the
degree of your dog’s hunting instinct.
Start by attracting your dog’s attention to a favorite toy. Then toss the toy across
the room and watch his reaction.
He ignores the toy. Don’t bother looking for the wolf in this dog. His hunting instinct
is virtually absent.
He runs after the toy, but does not pick it up. The chase instinct is present but little
else, which indicates a low overall hunting instinct.
He picks up the toy and carries it all the way, or part of the way, back to you. Chase
and grab are present, evidencing a moderate level of hunting instinct.
He pounces on the toy, shaking and chewing it. This reaction is a strong hunting
instinct, with all the main behaviors present. Your dog is still a hunter!
Having a dog with a strong hunting instinct (sometimes called prey drive) is not nec-
essarily a bad thing. Hunting instincts invade every part of a good working dog’s
training, whether tracking, obedience, or protection. Many dog sports, such as fly-
ball or Frisbee, depend upon hunting behaviors and instincts.

The choice of the command to stop chasing is important. When a
child or a cyclist is being chased by a dog, they naturally respond
by shouting “Stop” or “Stop it!” When the dog hears those words
from the person that he’s distressing, he should understand that
he’s being told to break off the chase (without any need to teach
anything to the person being chased).
1. Start with the chase recall.
For this training exercise, you need two people and at least
two of your dog’s favorite retrieving or chasing toys. It may
help to start indoors where there are fewer distractions or
in a quiet enclosed area outdoors.
2. Start by having one person hold the dog and then throw
the toy past the other person, who is standing about 15
feet away.
3. Randomly, say every third or fourth throw, the other
person should catch the toy, hide it out of sight, and, as
the dog starts to run toward him, the person hiding the
toy shouts “Stop it!”
Normally, once your dog realizes the toy has disappeared,
he looks back at you.
4. As soon as that happens, show the dog the other toy,
throw it in the opposite direction, and run in the direc-
tion that you tossed it to make it more likely that the dog
will enthusiastically chase it.
What the dog is learning is that by responding to “Stop it,”
by breaking off the chase and looking at you, good things
are apt to happen.
5. Next put the dog on a long leash and take your dog to a
place that contains things that he usually chases. When
he starts to chase something, yell “Stop it!” and bring
him back to you for some praise and an occasional treat.
The dog gradually learns to break off chasing on command.
When you can roll a ball away from your dog and he doesn’t chase
it when you command him not to, then you know that he’s under
control.
Understanding Your Dog’s Sex Life
Dogs are a lot more sexually promiscuous than their wild cousins.
Compared to wolves, for example, dogs tend to reach puberty
Chapter 2: Understanding Your Dog 25

(sexual maturity) between 7 and 10 months of age, while wolves
are sexually immature until they’re 22 to 24 months of age.
Smaller dogs tend to reach puberty earlier than larger dogs.
Dogs are also a lot more promiscuous than wolves. Generally
speaking, wolves are relatively monogamous, with the leadership
(or alpha pair) forming a sexual partnership with another wolf and
sticking to that relationship fairly exclusively.
Dogs, on the other hand, are philandering Casanovas. They’re
polygamous and are willing to accept multiple sexual partners: an
attribute deliberately selected during the domestication process,
allowing them to breed more freely. (Needless to say, this trait was
a good thing in the eyes of humans because it allowed chosen dogs
to be readily mated with partners selected not by them but by
their breeders.)
Another adjustment that came about through the process of
domestication was a change in dogs’ breeding cycles. Female
wolves come into season and are sexually receptive and fertile
only once per year. Female dogs, on the other hand, come into
season and can be bred twice a year, with few exceptions — namely
dogs that are very close to their “wild ancestors,” such as the
Basenji, which comes into heat only once a year.
Most people don’t know that a male reproductive cycle, at least in
wild canines, occurs. Male wolves are able to breed only during a
short period each year. Between breeding seasons, the male wolf’s
testes actually shrink and become unable to produce sperm. Male
dogs, however, seem to be randy all the time. They’re fertile and
willing to mate whenever a receptive female is available.
For the eight or nine days before ovulation and for the next nine
days when the female dog is fertile, major hormonal changes
occur. Females in heat become more playful around males in gen-
eral, although they also become more aggressive toward males
that they want to reject.
In dog matings, the choice is always up to the female! The most
dominant male doesn’t always get to mate with the female. If she
wants to reject a dominant male, she simply rolls over on her back
or side and refuses to stand for his attentions. Less dominant dogs
who are rejected, however, get nipped and growled at. The female
may also become more aggressive around other females at this
time.
Part I: The Fascinating World of Dogs 
26

The truth about spaying 
and neutering
When dogs are brought to veterinarians to be neutered, the scene
usually involves a wife agreeing to the procedure while her hus-
band sits with his legs crossed and appears uncomfortable. Though
neutering is obviously done to prevent the birth of unwanted pup-
pies, it also affects the behavior of dogs — and almost always for
the better.
In male dogs, the dramatic reduction in hormones after neutering
reduces their desire to mark their territory with urine, to be
aggressive with other male dogs, and to wander from home follow-
ing sexual scents.
In female dogs, the effects are mostly on the twice yearly changes
that occur when she’s in heat, such as protective urges for pup-
pies, or puppy substitutes, such as toys. In female dogs, however,
the reduction in the hormone progesterone, which normally has
calming effects, can exaggerate dominance behaviors in an already
dominant female.
The major benefits to society from spaying female dogs is that it
reduces the overpopulation of unwanted dogs, who eventually end
up living in the streets or euthanized by dog pounds. It also reduces
the likelihood that every hopeful male dog in the neighborhood
will show up at your doorstep or molest you on your walks when
your furry girl goes into heat.
Chapter 2: Understanding Your Dog 27
Domestic overpopulation crisis
In evolutionary terms, dogs are more than a thousand times more successful than
wolves based on their numbers. It is estimated that more than 400 million dogs exist
in the world (which is equivalent to the human populations of the United States,
Canada, Great Britain, and France combined) compared to a worldwide total of only
400,000 wolves.
One reason for dogs’ biological success has to do with their shortened breeding
cycles. An average female dog can have her first litter of puppies when she is only
10 to 12 months of age. It takes 58 to 70 days to have the puppies. The average
number of pups is usually between 6 and 10. Every female dog can have two batches
of puppies each year. Now, if half of these puppies are female, they can also have
pups when they grow up. That means that one female dog and her offspring can
produce 4,372 puppies in just seven years!

Neutering doesn’t affect house guarding, fear biting, and predatory
or territorial aggression.
Now or later? The best age 
to spay or neuter a dog
Science is quite clear that just before puberty is an excellent time
to carry out this procedure. Neutering a dog before it reaches
sexual maturity freezes its personality in its present puppylike
form. If you like your dog’s personality at 6 months of age and your
veterinarian agrees, there is no reason not to neuter him or her at
that age.
Neutering a dog too early (say, at 2 or 3 months) may affect the
dog’s growth patterns as well as his personality. It appears that
certain levels of sex hormones are needed for the dog to grow to
its full size and to allow it to develop some aspects of adult behav-
ior. You see, Mom was wrong — it’s not too much sex that stunts
your growth, but too few sex hormones.
The scent of a female dog in heat can drift over a quarter of a mile
and attract male dogs to her vicinity. The nearness of a sexually
receptive female can make male dogs quite excited and aggressive
toward other male dogs. It can also cause frustration within the
confines of a house, causing otherwise sedentary dogs to wander
well away from home.

Communicating 
with Your Dog
In This Chapter

I
f your dog could talk as you do, she would have a lot to say, both
good and bad. But alas, for better or worse, she cannot. Your
dog’s brain, not her determination or will, limits her ability to use
and understand human dialect. However, your dog can, and will,
communicate in her own unique language, which we call Doglish.
Doglish consists of many elements, the least of which is vocaliza-
tion. Unlike people, dogs watch more than they verbalize. In this
chapter, we reveal how dogs use their body language (and at times,
their voice) to convey mood and meaning.
An English to Doglish Translation
Imagine being a foreigner in a country where you don’t understand
the language. Though you’d be eager to communicate, all your
efforts would be thwarted by the language barrier. Now you know
how your dog feels.
You can think of training your dog like teaching English as a second
language: The better you know your dog’s native tongue, or Doglish,
the easier it is to understand her behavior. More physically expres-
sive than verbal, your dog uses her entire body to convey emotion:
from the top of her ears to the tip of her tail. The following sec-
tions help you translate — by simply observing all elements of her
body language — your dog’s mood, intentions, and desires.

Seeing Eye to Eye
Group interaction is the highlight of your dog’s day, and your eye
contact is a sure sign of acknowledgement. Because your dog can’t
comprehend frustration, your negative eye contact often gets inter-
preted as confrontational play. The result? Many negative situa-
tions are exacerbated.
For example, if jumping gets even a sideward glance, your dog will
jump again to get your attention: a repeat performance is guaran-
teed. If stealing an object ensures a group chase, it will quickly
become your household’s favorite pastime, at least from your
dog’s perspective.
Fortunately, you can also use eye contact to encourage and dis-
courage behavior after you realize how your dog processes your
visual attention.
Here’s what you’re saying with your eyes, whether you realize it 
or not:
 Engaging in excessive eye contact: If you stare at your dog in
adoration, frustration, or merely out of habit, you look like a
follower. Leaders lead; followers watch. Though quiet time
and playful interactions may call for a visual connection,
avoid staring at your dog.
The more you look at your dog, the less she’ll look to you.
Fortunately, the opposite is true, too: The less you look at
your dog, the more she’ll look at you. Be a leader, not a 
follower — give direction, don’t take it!
 Staring: Staring conveys a social challenge, so you’re best off
avoiding this interaction altogether. Use the brush-off tech-
nique: If you’ve given her a direction, follow through by posi-
tioning her as you ignore her visually. If your dog is intent on
this activity, see Chapters 4 and 12.
 Staring while ignoring your direction: One of two things is
going on. Your dog may be trying to challenge your authority
by staring at you as she deliberately ignores a direction. Don’t
take this move personally — it’s just a test. Staring back, how-
ever, will bring you to her level. Instead, brush it off and posi-
tion her.
On the other hand, if your dog is young, new to your training
routines, or simply insecure, she may stare at you in hopes for
more direction. (You can tell the difference by her submissive
posture: ears back, body curved down into a submissive pose.)
Part I: The Fascinating World of Dogs 
30

In this case, position her calmly and consider using the luring
technique described in Chapter 12 to boost her confidence.
 Ignoring your dog: Often, you can extinguish behaviors by
simply ignoring them. Because your dog repeats any behavior
(negative or positive) that gets your attention, try the oppo-
site: Block facial interaction by folding your arms over your
face. Your dog jumps — close shop. She barks for attention —
nobody home. This easy-to-replicate response is a sure signal
that the behavior gets decidedly less attention, not more.
If your dog becomes persistent, it’s a good sign that your efforts
are having an affect. Accustomed to your normal reaction, she’s
determined to get your attention. Some professionals call this an
extinguish burst, but we like to think of it as a sign of doggone 
determination!
Look at your dog when she’s cooperating, not when you’re giving
her instruction. For example, when calling your dog, don’t stare at
her. Either look at the ground (she’ll think you’ve found something
interesting) or turn away as you call out her name. Your trailing
voice will spark her curiosity.
Dogs, like people, use eye contact to assess and reinforce status
and other communications (see Figure 3-1). Table 3-1 identifies
your dog’s thoughts.
Figure 3-1: Dogs also use eye contact to communicate.

How your dog views your language
Are you convinced that your dog understands you — that she “knows” she’s done
something wrong? Though her posture may look like an assumption of guilt, most
dogs are merely afraid when humans berate them.
Think about it. It’s likely that dogs interpret human yelling as barking. When vocal-
ization is loud and excessive, it sounds frantic and bespeaks lunacy, not direction.
Running at a dog is terrifying. Imagine some giant running at you for handling some-
thing you thought was the normal way of reacting. Your dog simply doesn’t respect
material value.
Hitting a dog? Anyone that hits a dog should be ashamed! Poor defenseless 
creature — the only lesson a hit dog will learn is aggression.
A young or uncivilized dog doesn’t know right from wrong any more than a mole
would know whether she dug in the wrong dirt pile. Fortunately, you can teach your
dog what pleases you and how to contain specific impulses, but first you must learn
to speak your dog’s language and respect how she thinks.

heralds a dominant or threatened individual. On the flip side, a
small eye or squinting brow signals passivity and submission.
Please reference the other components of your dog’s posture in
this chapter for a more thorough examination of how body pos-
tures, eye expressions, and tail positions convey a dog’s emotion.
Watch your dog’s brow. Any action that you see in the forehead
region conveys virtually the same emotional response as in a
human’s forehead.
Interpreting Vocal Tones 
and Intonations
Dogs can’t process a great deal of chatter. They can’t talk, but they
can communicate and respond to spoken directions that are given
properly. Table 3-2 outlines what our dogs hear when we speak to
them.

Chapter 3: Communicating with Your Dog 33

Humans learn primarily through auditory recognition: We listen to
directions. Sight is secondary. On the other hand, dogs learn by
watching each other instead of by listening or “talking.” Teach your
dog hand signals for every verbal direction (“Sit,” “Wait,” “Down,”
“Come,” and so on). See Chapter 12 for a chart on corresponding
hand signals.
Making the Most of What You Say
When training your dog, think of your efforts as teaching her the
proper responses to each direction. Training doesn’t give you
license to order your dog about: like a child, your dog is an individ-
ual and makes her own decisions. If you’re confident and support-
ive, she’ll respect you and take direction with joy. If you frustrate
easily and are demanding, she may tune you out and run from you
at every opportunity.
Here are a few more tips for communicating with your dog through
words:
 Think of directions as though you were your dog’s teacher
or coach. Say your directions as you would tell a player to
move to the left or as though you were telling your class to
have a seat or come to the blackboard. Nothing should be
spoken in a tone too dramatized or placating.
 Give directions once. If your dog doesn’t know the direction,
simply position her as if she’s not paying attention.
 Don’t yell at your dog. If you’re frustrated, you may speak
sternly, but keep it short. The phrases “That’s unacceptable”
or “shame on you” spoken and properly timed convey your
disapproval without fanfare or confusion.
 Don’t bother modifying your voice. Speaking in a deep voice
may not come naturally to you, and if you’re faking it, you’ll
likely see your dog giving you the teenage version of an eye roll.
For basic training exercises, see Chapter 12.
Listen to Your Dog’s Voice
Though your dog won’t “talk” to you in English, you can interpret
both her intentions and immediate desires if you know what to
listen for. In Table 3-3, we outline the range of sounds dogs make,
providing you with a human translation and the moods behind
every utterance. Overall, a low pitch indicates a more dominant or
Part I: The Fascinating World of Dogs 
34

threatening stance, whereas a high pitch conveys just the 
opposite — insecurity and fear.
A dog whose pitch or vocalization varies is emotionally conflicted.
Unsure and unable to properly interpret a situation, this dog needs
a lot of direction and interference to feel secure. (Refer to Chapters
12 and 14 for more information.)

Reading Body Talk
Your dog is communicating a lot through her body postures and 
also tuning in to your body language more than you might imagine.
Regulating how you hold your posture and recognizing your dog’s
body language can enable a fluent dialog between the two of you.
Figures 3-2 and 3-3 illustrate common dog postures, and Table 3-4
highlights their translation.
Remember that if your dog is shrunk and low, she’s feeling insecure
or scared. If her weight is pitched forward, she’s confident, on alert,
or in defense mode. If her head is hung low, but her body is relaxed,
the message is loud and clear: “I’m exhausted!”
General rules apply to body posture for both of our species. An alert
upright posture conveys confidence. A sudden rise in stature often
underscores a need to gain control or dominate others. A fully
directed body is often used to issue a threat (although in young or
submissive dogs, it’s used to elicit play or pity). When normally
socialized dogs meet in an open area, they approach at side angles,
which is pacifying and conveys a willingness to greet one another
and get along.
Part I: The Fascinating World of Dogs 
38

Figure 3-2: Common dog postures showing dominance and aggression.
Figure 3-3: Common dog postures showing fear and submission.
Professionally, we’re often asked why an otherwise social dog
becomes aggressive on a leash. When strained, the leash pitches an
otherwise passive body into a defensive pose. To another dog, this
positioning sends an alert and causes defenses to go up. If this dog
is also held by leash in a strangle hold, the tension only escalates.

What is the solution? Dogs must be taught to walk on a loose lead
behind their people. In this position, they naturally take direction

Focus on your dog’s ears. Whether floppy or erect, their various

looked at in relation to other postures, positions, and vocaliza-

Facial signals
Though facial signals may vary slightly based on coinciding ges-
tures or postures, Table 3-6 outlines the scope of emotions that
can be predicted when the facial cues are watched.
As a general rule, the more teeth that show when a dog is growling,
the greater the threat. When a dog’s mouth is open, you should
look at the shape of the opening: A “C” shape is dominant, whereas
drawn lips, with the rear corners pulled back, gestures submission
or fear.

Tail talk
When reading your dog’s tail, you must interpret all motions based
on her tail’s normal resting pose. A Greyhound, for example, car-
ries her tail low when she’s relaxed, as compared to a Malamute,
whose tail is upright and curled when she’s calm. With that said,
generally a higher tail indicates a dominant attitude, whereas a low
tail communicates submission or fear (see Figure 3-4).
Part I: The Fascinating World of Dogs 
44

Figure 3-4: Common tail positions.
Also consider the rate of the wag, because faster motion evidences
a higher level of arousal. The exception to this rule? A trembling
tail, which actually looks as though it’s vibrating. This tail isn’t
“wagging” so much as its signaling intense emotion and excitement.
A wagging tail doesn’t always invite interaction, nor is it always a
gesture of good will. Dogs use their tails (see Table 3-7) in combina-
tion with the many other body signals outlined in this chapter to
convey various “moods,” from pleasure to emotional agitation.

Chapter 4
Seeing Life from Your 
Dog’s Perspective
In This Chapter
 Knowing what your dog thinks about all day long
 Organizing the hierarchy in your home
 Encouraging good manners
 Conditioning your dog to share objects and food
Your dog, regardless of his size or coat color, is hard-wired to
act like . . . well, like a dog. He isn’t a kitten, bunny, guinea pig,
or child. His behavior is unique and predictable: He’ll walk on four
legs, sleep at night, and seek affection. These universal behaviors
can give you a leg up in communicating with and training him.
Our goal in this chapter is to help you recognize your dog’s behav-
ior patterns, understand his communication style, and adjust your
approach to teaching him how to behave. Here, you discover how
to talk “dog” and look at your current situation from his point of
view. This chapter also helps you get a handle on everyday life
immediately, from civilizing your dog’s manners to de-escalating
mismanaged behaviors, such as hyperactivity, assertiveness, fear,
and impulsivity.
Like Person, Like Dog (Similarities
and Differences)
Dogs and people have many things in common. Both species define
their positions based on social interactions, each likes to learn and
know things, and both need to identify their surroundings in order
to feel safe and in control.

Your dog also strives to mirror you; if you’re going out for a walk,
he wants to go. If food is being prepared, your dog wants a piece of
that action as well. When someone visits, your dog needs a formal
introduction. If your dog doesn’t handle these situations well at
this point, don’t despair.
Although many similarities exist between dogs and people, differ-
ences occur, too — chiefly that children mature into adulthood,
while dogs stay very puppy-like and devoted throughout their
lives. Though a puppy matures during his first two years, he won’t
voluntarily leave the home or charge your credit card. A more real-
istic example is that most dogs never learn to share objects unless
they’re taught to do so, and many, in fact, guard possessions from
even the most beloved family member (see Chapter 15). Though
it’s tempting for you to be angry at your dog for this and other
“disobedient” behaviors, once you understand how he thinks,
you’ll have an enlightened view and be more open to performing
the exercises necessary to remedy all of your frustrations.
Your Dog Needs Affection
Dogs like to be praised, and they need feedback and encourage-
ment. Too many dogs live in homes where negative feedback is
their bread and butter, a pattern that leaves many manic from con-
fusion or reactionary out of sheer frustration. Poor dogs! Imagine a
loved one berating you — “This meal is awful,” “That was a bad
toss,” “You’re a lousy spouse, parent, or child . . . .”
We’d love to have a nickel for every time we’ve heard the exclama-
tion, “But he knows he’s wrong!” Dogs simply can’t perceive inter-
action in the way another human would. When a dog looks fearful,
it’s because he is, in fact, afraid. We want to offer you a better,
more cheerful approach to both training your dog and problem
solving, one that leaves you and your dog feeling exhilarated and
connected, not drained.
Your dog needs a lot of organized structure and positive reinforce-
ment in the form of rewards and incentives, which we discuss in
this chapter and throughout the book. If the most common thing
that you’re saying to your dog is “No,” your dog can’t possibly
understand what he can do to make you happy. In Chapter 15, we
talk about the Family Cooperation System, also known as nothing in
life is free. Each time you offer your dog praise, toys, or attention,
simply ask him to sit. In essence, you’re teaching him to say please.
If you’re feeling a little guilty that you haven’t been offering a lot of
positive reinforcement these days, there’s no better time than the
Part I: The Fascinating World of Dogs 
48

present to change! Praise your dog every chance you get! “Good
catch” (don’t worry if he doesn’t fetch quite yet), “Good boy”
(when he’s chewing his toy), “Nice dog” (when he’s relaxing). Your
positive outlook will motivate his cooperation.
Make an Encouragement Chart, shown in Table 4-1, and share it
with family and friends. Teach your dog what he can do to please
you, no matter how insignificant it may seem.

(Teach him things to earn your affection)
Though it’s hard to always act positively when you’re at your wit’s
end, please fake it for awhile. Your dog would rather have positive
attention for behaving well than negative attention for behaving
poorly. If you don’t highlight his strengths, however, he’ll default to
being naughty, because any attention is better than none at all.
Group identity
Dogs so completely identify with their group or “family,” that few
would even know how to cope if left on their own. Ask various
breeds what they’d do if they were suddenly put out on the street
and, although you may get different answers, none would much
enjoy their independence:
 Golden Retriever: Would scramble about for the nearest ball
or stick and drop it eagerly at the nearest foot
Chapter 4: Seeing Life from Your Dog’s Perspective 49

 Border Collie: Would herd all the people within sight into a
tight circle
 Beagle: Would sniff merrily through a crowd until someone
started to follow
 Jack Russell: Would bark fanatically at a mysterious noise in
the corner of a building until a crowd gathered
 Cavalier King Charles Spaniel: Would head for the nearest lap
 Labrador Retriever: Would race into the nearest restaurant,
lie under the table, and wait eagerly for scraps to fall
In short, no dog — not yours, not anyone’s — enjoys solitude. As a
species, dogs glean their identity through interaction. Call them
“groupies,” or put it in more scientific terms, but either way, limit
the amount of time your dog must spend alone.
Some breeds are more sedentary than others, while certain breeds
are bred to work independently. If your schedule demands time
away, see Chapter 6 to find out which breeds will be more apt to
flow with periods of solitude and what you can do to ease their 
isolation.
Using reflection and praise 
to influence behavior
Imagine your dog’s level of energy on a scale from 1–10, where 1
equals sleep and 10 is an excessively hyper, fearful, or aggressive
response. Now, further split the scale into two zones: the contained
Part I: The Fascinating World of Dogs 
50
Pet status and isolation
Only recently have people had the expectation that dogs adjust to long periods of
alone time. For most of the 20th century, no leash laws existed — hard to imagine,
but true. Dogs were left out on the back porch during the day and often left to run
free at night.
Long ago, most dogs weren’t even considered pets. They were domesticated and
bred to aid man in tasks that clearly advanced society, from herding sheep, to guard-
ing property and towns, to hauling supplies in wagons or sleds.
The evolution of dogs as “pets” has come with the expectation that they put their
working genes to rest (which isn’t entirely possible), as well as a growing aware-
ness of their psychological and emotional needs. For more information on breed-
specific information, see Chapter 6.

happy zone (1–7) and the detached, chaotic zone (8–10). Your goal
in understanding and training your dog is to help him learn to func-
tion with enough presence of mind to live with you predictably and
comfortably — in other words, to operate in the 1–7 zone.
Do you suspect that your dog is operating in the 8–10 zone all too
often — for example, when the doorbell rings, the kids come home,
or just when you’re sitting down to relax in front of the television?
Of course, you’d like your dog to simply reflect your energy level:
that he rest when you’re relaxed, accompany you when you go out-
side to walk or play with him, and otherwise entertain himself when
you’re occupied. Though this level of attention is asking a lot of an
untrained dog, once educated, a dog naturally mirrors your
timetable.
In Chapter 13, we discuss specific responses to discourage prob-
lem behavior, but for now, suffice it to say, whatever behaviors you
pay attention to will tend to be repeated. If your dog responds to a
direction or chews a toy and you praise him for that, he’ll remem-
ber. If your dog’s acting wild or repeating mischief and your frus-
tration leaks out, he’ll respond to negative attention just as easily
and repeat the very behaviors that are driving you crazy.
How Hierarchy Differs 
from Democracy
Your dog looks to you and your family in much the same way he
would seek inclusion in a group of dogs. This truth places dogs, 
on a whole, above other species in their loyalty and focus for our
direction. Defining his life’s orientation to your group activity, he
focuses on his position within your family, and yet reflects his posi-
tion in hierarchical terms, not as a democracy. This defining differ-
ence between our two species must be fully embraced. Democracy
is an ineffective model when civilizing a dog.
Choose your role now! Either be the leader of the group and 
give your dog direction, or he will — out of his desire to keep the
family or pack system working — take over the leadership role and
train you.
In a group, someone must take charge and make the important
decisions.
Chapter 4: Seeing Life from Your Dog’s Perspective 51

A hierarchal analogy, in human terms, is team play. At the top is a
single captain or co-captains, and then below them is a hierarchy
of players, which is based on their seniority, strength, and poten-
tial. The captain’s role is to organize the space and activity of each
player to highlight his talents. In turn, the players strive to get
along and work together towards a collective goal.
It’s in their genes
Most people wouldn’t ignore a toddler who looked at them with a
confused expression, but those same people may overlook a simi-
lar expression coming from their dog. Because dogs are genetically
programmed, especially when young, to look for direction, the
opportunity to capitalize on their devotion is in the human’s
hands. When ignored, a dog often repeats whatever behavior got
him attention previously, creating a hard-to-break cycle.
Teach your dog three directions that you can use whenever he
looks to you for direction:
 Get your ball.
 Let’s find your bone!
 Sit/settle down.
If your dog hasn’t learned these directions, look carefully at the
upcoming “Giving direction” section and then direct him to the
object or into position. Praise his cooperation, even as you’re help-
ing him respond appropriately.
When your dog stares at you, he is often looking for guidance.
Constant adoration makes your dog restless. Acting out soon fol-
lows, often in the form of house-soiling, destructive chewing, or
stealing objects.
A better approach is to teach your dog the instructions in the
upcoming “giving direction” section, so that you can give him guid-
ance when he looks for it.
If your puppy has been assertive from the get-go, he’s likely to
have a more dominate, leadership-oriented personality. This puppy
needs a consistent take-charge approach. If you feel that you’re
losing the training battle, practice the exercises in Chapter 12, get-
ting a professional to help you, if required.
Part I: The Fascinating World of Dogs 
52

If your dog developed these traits during his adolescence or later,
he has taken the leadership role only because you did not. So you
need to change your behaviors to regain your status, and although
you need to be consistent, this dog will be grateful that you’re
taking over this demanding job. Being a leader is hard work!
Chapter 4: Seeing Life from Your Dog’s Perspective 53
There is a leader born to every litter
In each litter of puppies, a leader is born — one who is easily identified by 8 weeks
of age. This puppy is demanding at meal times, assertive when playing, and bossy.
In a human family, this puppy exhibits this same attitude, quickly determining just
who he can boss around. If you suspect that you may have a strong personality type
under your roof, ask yourself the questions listed in the following table and check
the appropriate response.

Asserting benevolent authority
If you suspect that your dog is organizing your routines, you’ll
need to reorganize the hierarchy. Unless you want to be dog
trained, the first step in the process is deciding that you want to do
it and reassuring yourself that you can do it. Attitude is everything.
If you feel yourself floundering, see whether you can find the answer
to your issues by checking for help in this book’s index or calling
in a professional to help.
Your dog is pre-programmed to accept direction, so in many ways
you’re already ahead of the game.
Defining your space
Dogs define their role based on social and spatial definition. If you
walk around, step over, or move out of your dog’s way, your mes-
sage is loud and clear: Your mindful avoidance communicates your
respect for your dog’s authority. Stop right there and try the fol-
lowing exercises:
 Teach your dog “Excuse me.” Your dog identifies your rela-
tionship based on spatial deference: Either you move out of
his way, or he moves out of yours. Teach him to respect your
space immediately! If he’s in your way, say “Excuse me” and
nudge him gently with your foot until he moves. If he cuts in
front of you, walk straight into him until he shifts out of your
way. Is he leaning against you excessively or inappropriately?
Say “Excuse me” and use your leg to push him off until he
respects your personal space.
 Condition your dog to lie on the sidelines. Have you got a
dog who always positions himself underfoot? Aside from
being dangerous, his intrusion is a cry for attention. Provide
him with a proper area in each room of your house and iden-
tify it with bedding and toys. If he’s reluctant to stay there,
check out the upcoming “Assign play stations in each room”
section.
The two preceding exercises are important lessons in civility, and
even more essential if you’re living with a problem dog (see Part IV).
If you ask your dog to move and he growls at you, stop. This is a
sign that it’s time to refer to Chapter 15 on aggressive problems to
see what you can do or to go to the phone immediately and call for
professional help. Actively aggressive behaviors require expertise
that may go beyond the scope of this book.
Part I: The Fascinating World of Dogs 
54

Encourage all your friends and family to take part in your efforts to
civilize your dog. If your dog ignores any of them, step in to rein-
force their directions. Your dog must learn to respect everyone.
Giving direction
Everyone knows that a small toddler needs lots of direction, inter-
action, and patience. Dogs do, too. The key difference is that chil-
dren are programmed to communicate with words, whereas dogs
are not, although they can learn to respond to sound cues and
hand signals (see Figure 4-1). You need to teach your dog the
proper response for a series of everyday directional cues. Here are
six cues to get you and your dog started:
 Name: Help your dog create a positive association to his
name. Call out your dog’s name whenever you come home or
to highlight a positive moment, such as when you’re offering a
treat, loving pats, or playtime with a favorite toy.
Don’t call your dog for unpleasant activities, such as isolation
or unwanted grooming. If you do, he just might hear “Come”
and think run! If “Come” has a reverse effect, stop using it. Use
Chapter 4: Seeing Life from Your Dog’s Perspective 55
Don’t be afraid to use a leash
We hear it all the time . . . .
“I want my dog to join me, but he’s so unmanageable. We try, but after a short bit,
we have no choice but to shut him away by himself again. If he’d learn to behave,
he’d get a lot more freedom.”
If the thought of letting your dog loose leaves you shaking in your shoes, you’ve
probably gotten yourself caught in a vicious cycle. You may not realize that, ironi-
cally, it’s the prolonged periods of isolation that result in your dog’s impulsivity and
mischief.
Here’s one solution: Use your leash indoors. Find an appropriate training collar (see
Chapter 11) and use a collar and leash ensemble to lead him through your home.
Use the directions in this chapter to teach him his manners and socialize him to
each room.
The leash is not a cruel devise; think of it as synonymous with holding a child’s hand.
What’s cruel and confusing is forced isolation. Once your dog is cooperating, let
him drag the leash behind him so that you can easily grab it if needed for additional
control. When you’re sure his manners have improved and he’s acting civilly, you
can dispense with the leash — but not before you’re certain that it’s no longer
needed.

a treat cup and also check out the other training techniques in
Chapter 12. Of course, you could just keep your dog on leash.
Call your dog as you’re walking away from him or when you’re
hidden from sight to peak his interest. Shake a cup of treats
while saying his name to encourage his enthusiasm for listen-
ing and following you. Though initially he’ll respond for the
food, you’ll eventually condition a positive cooperative habit.
Ultimately, you can phase out food treats and replace them
with praise and petting.
 Ball and/or toy: Often during the day, your dog may look to
you for ideas. If you say nothing, his restlessness may lead to
mischief. Instead, teach him these words. Each time you play
with him or give him a chew, repeat a word like “Toy” or “Bone.”
 Sit, please: A dog who sits politely is, in essence, saying
please. Teach your dog to sit by either enticing him with a
treat held near his nose and moved back over his head or by
placing pressure on his waist muscles with your thumb and
forefinger as you put gentle upward pressure under his chin.
Teach your dog that he must sit before rewards, food, or
attention.
 Wait/okay: This direction tells your dog to freeze and wait for
your next cue. Use it at thresholds and curbs or when enter-
ing or exiting your home, a building, or your car. To teach it,
either control your dog on a leash or hold him steady, pulling
back as you say “Wait,” and then releasing him with “Okay.”
 Follow me: This direction simply reminds your dog that
you’re the leader and will make all the directional decisions
for both of you. More than a dominance gesture, your leader-
ship efforts convey your willingness to be his guardian and
protector. If your dog’s taken this role, use a leash and a
proper training collar to manage him (see Chapter 11). Also
consider using treats, a treat cup, or a clicker to inspire his
cooperation (see Chapter 11).
 Settle down: This direction encourages your dog to relax. As
often as possible, direct your dog to a mat or comfortable
rug/bed and provide him with a displacement activity, such as
a bone or toy, which will distract him and keep him from idly
wandering about. You can use it both in your home or when
traveling about. Whether your dog is restless at your dinner
hour or quiet time, or you’re waiting your turn at the veteri-
narian, this familiar direction will give your dog a sense of
calm.

Figure 4-1: Basic directions can help you organize your day. Encourage your dog
to sit before giving him anything pleasant. Always lead your dog through the
door. He should not leave the home “den” without your accompaniment. Teach
your dog to follow your lead.
Establishing your social status
Your dog is programmed to accept you and your family as if they
were other dogs. He depends on the social structure you create to
make him feel connected and safe. If you communicate direction to
him and provide for his needs with consistency, he will look to you
to interpret other situations as well. If your dog is unclear as to
what you want or you get frustrated with him often, he may per-
ceive you as a moody adolescent dog instead of a leader. Even
worse, your dog may decide that you’re an unreliable or incompe-
tent leader, which is bound to make him insecure and frustrate
him. When this happens, later behavior problems are virtually
guaranteed.
Chapter 4: Seeing Life from Your Dog’s Perspective 57
Was that out of spite?
Do you think your dog behaves poorly out of spite? Think again. Although the authors
agree that dogs repeat behavior that get them attention (good or bad) and often act
out of anxiety when left alone, dogs don’t react out of spite.
Dogs aren’t dishonest or mean. The conclusion that your dog is vengeful will do
nothing for your relationship — such thoughts only result in bad energy in the home.
Ask not what your dog is doing wrong, but what you may not be doing right.

Practice the exercises in the following sections to reestablish your
social status.
Assign play stations in each room
Your home is nothing more then a big den to your dog. How you
establish routines indoors affects your relationship more than any
activities or training programs you’re involved in.
Think of providing your dog with a play station like offering a guest
in your home a chair. Your dog doesn’t know where to go in your
house until you tell him; when you do, he’ll feel welcome, calm,
and included. If you don’t, he’ll likely misbehave, which provokes
your negative attention. Because your negative reaction can be
interpreted as a controlled or restrained confrontation, your dog
may think his freedom is an invitation to play!
Here’s how to give your dog a play station:
1. Decide the rooms your dog will be welcome in.
If you have to isolate him now but want him to share, say,
the whole house or the downstairs area, take strides imme-
diately toward this goal.
2. Go into each room and select a spot on the floor (or a sec-
tion of a chair/sofa) for your dog to call his own.
For our purposes, we call this area a play station.
3. Identify that location with a rug, a flat mat, or bedding,
and place a few of your dog’s favorite bones or toys on it.
4. Introduce your dog to his special area.
Bring him into the room on a leash if he’s too fidgety and
say “Settle down” (see the earlier “Giving direction” sec-
tion) as you lead him to his play station. Sit with him and
encourage him to focus on his things. Give him lots of
attention and feed him treats.
Bring your dog with you to these places often. If he won’t stay at
his play station, make sure that he’s had a good romp and time to
potty and then hold him still with a leash or secure a leash to
something immovable.
Restraint at the door
From your dog’s perspective, your main door is the mouth of his
den. Whoever orchestrates comings and goings runs the show. If
your dog barges through or reacts inappropriately when visitors
arrive, he’ll assume he’s in charge.
Part I: The Fascinating World of Dogs 
58

In essence, you may be paying the mortgage or rent on a very elab-
orate dog house! Changing this situation is easy enough, but to do
so, consistency is a must:
1. Teach your dog to follow you in and out of the door.
Initially, manage him on a leash and teach him to properly
respond to the directions “Wait” and then “Okay.” (See the
earlier “Giving direction” section.)
2. Teach your dog a proper greeting ritual, remembering
that good manners start at home.
Ignore your dog if he behaves in an overexcited or inappro-
priate manner when you or other family members arrive.
(For more tips on responding to jumping or nipping, see
Chapter 13.) If he’s been confined alone in a crate, pen, or
room, don’t speak to him until he’s calmed down or is
chewing on a toy. After he’s calmed down considerably,
brace him as you greet him (see Figure 4-2), with your
thumb clipped over the underside of his collar to prevent
him from jumping up.
Figure 4-2: Bracing a dog during greetings.
To create a greeting station, choose a location 6–15 feet from the
door. This location is the place where you’ll send your dog before
opening the door when company arrives. Teach your dog the term
“Go back” ahead of time, leading him to the area and telling him to
“Wait” while you open and shut the door.
Chapter 4: Seeing Life from Your Dog’s Perspective 59

If your dog doesn’t stay put when no one is present, he won’t sit
still when they are. In this case, affix a leash on an immovable
object. When you send him back from the door, secure him on the
leash. Practice doing this when no one is there, then with your
family, and each time someone calls. (If your dog is distractingly
rowdy, aggressive, or fearful, please refer to Part IV.) Release your
dog after you’ve welcomed the visitor and only when he’s calmed
down.
The goal is that your dog mirror and mimic your response to new-
comers. Your dog isn’t the leader, you are. You can shape his
responses by establishing your authority in this way.
Reinforcing Good Manners
Teaching your dog new behavior shouldn’t be an exercise confined
to 15-minute periods throughout the day. As you teach your dog
new words, implement them into your daily routine as soon as pos-
sible, and come up with a list of constants — directions that high-
light everyday activities, such as going “Upstairs,” to the “Car,” or
out for a “Walk.”
Identifiable words add a punch of excitement to your dog’s day,
similar to being in a foreign country and finding an individual who
speaks your language. Good manners flow from calm, consistent
directions.
To reinforce good manners, don’t forget to
 Follow through. If you give a direction, reinforce it. Praise
your dog for cooperating or position him if he ignores you.
 Give directions once. If you repeat yourself, your dog will
catch on and will not respond immediately.
 Keep your expectations in check. Just because your dog
behaves well with you doesn’t mean he’ll mind his manners
when the doorbell rings or you visit family. Keep a leash on
your dog if necessary and/or reinforce all your directions
immediately.

Dog’s Identity

B
eyond your simple communication and empathetic
effort lies something that you can’t touch: your dog’s
instinctive, and innate, personality encoded at birth. Once
her temperament — whether shy, comic, or bold — is
deﬁned (at 7 weeks of age), you can modify it, but not
extinguish it. In this part, we help you gauge your expecta-
tions and modify your mannerisms to improve your daily
interactions, providing handy worksheets and visual iden-
tiﬁcation charts to help you recognize what your dog is
trying to say or do, and to give you the means to modify
your dog’s behavior.

Individuality
In This Chapter

 Understanding canine personality types
 Evaluating your dog’s personality
L
ike snowflakes and paw prints, every dog is unique. Their
actions and responses are what make up their personality.
Broken down, a dog’s personality is made up of three compo-
nents that blend together to create the individual: genetic 
drives and instinctive traits, emotional responses, and behav-
ioral tendencies.
As you teach your dog and expose her to various settings and 
situations, you can predict her responses based on her personality.
For example, if you have a shy dog, you don’t need a crystal ball to
foresee her response when a stranger comes to call. On the other
hand, if your dog is assertive and outgoing, you can easily antici-
pate her reaction if you were to bring her to a picnic. Identifying
your dog’s personality can help you in your training endeavors,
from the directions you teach to how you can extinguish undesir-
able behaviors.
Pet dogs don’t exist alone, nor can they just “pick up” information
from human language naturally. The first step in any humane
endeavor to live happily with your dog must be to identify her per-
sonality and then create a training regimen that empathizes with
her learning style and abilities.

Identifying Your Dog’s Personality
The various kennel clubs around the world divide their recognized
dog breeds into groups. The American Kennel Club has seven such
divisions, which group dogs according to function. The Hound
group, for example, links dogs who are designed to hunt prey.
Though you can reference more information on each breed in
Chapter 6, simply being aware of the various tasks your dog was
bred to fulfill provides invaluable information about his genetic
drives and instinctive traits.
Although breed characteristics are a matter of genetics, individual
dogs within any given breed can have vastly different personality
traits, from shy to laid-back to bossy. For example, if you’re observ-
ing a litter of cairn terriers, you can predict that each puppy would
be alert to sounds and love to dig. However, the shy puppy would
be more responsive to your interference than would the self-
assured one.
Part II: Embracing Your Dog’s Identity 
64
Spaniels are from Venus, and 
terriers are from Mars
At the end of the day, the real foundation for your dog’s personality is encoded in his
genes. In essence, his personality won’t vary much over his lifetime. This knowl-
edge can give you a pretty good idea of how your dog will act in many different sit-
uations and does allow you greater flexibility to influence his behavior. For example,
if you have an active dog that is overstimulated in social settings, simply hoping he’ll
calm down is not an effective training technique. Exercising him a few hours before
the event, teaching him to fetch, and arriving with a favorite toy, however, are effec-
tive ways to encourage a high-energy dog’s cooperation.
As far as breed-specific tendencies go, recognizing the passions and limitations of
your dog’s breed or mix of breeds also helps you select appropriate games, dis-
placement activities to distract him so that he stops an unwanted behavior (which
may include offering chew toys and such), and training exercises patterned to be
consistent with his predispositions.
Compare two breeds: a golden retriever and a German Shepherd. Retrievers are a
highly sociable breed, with few serious thoughts save, “Could you please just toss
the ball one more time — pleeaaassse.” German Shepherds, on the other hand, are
dignified, territorially proud, and mindful of other’s social intent. Mix these two
breeds, and you’ll notice their difference immediately. Whereas the German
Shepherd will be reserved and spatially respectful, the retriever will throw herself
on everyone just to be acknowledged.

The Puppy Personality Test
The following personality form is a generic test generally offered to
puppies between the ages of 7 weeks and 6 months of age. You can
also apply the test to older dogs, with appropriate modifications,
to take into account the dog’s size or potential for being snappish
or fidgety.
Each part of the test focuses on specific issues that, when exam-
ined as a whole, outline personality characteristics that make a
certain breed or individual puppy ideal for a particular person’s
interest. For example, the traits that make a good guard or protec-
tion dog aren’t those that would make for a good pet in a house full
of young children.
Puppy personality tests were developed to predetermine appropri-
ate candidates for service work — for example, Guide Dogs for the
blind — as an economic necessity because no one wanted to
spend time and money training dogs that wouldn’t successfully
finish the course and fulfill the work requirements. Over time,
behaviorists modified these tests for the general public; William
Campbell and Joachim and Wendy Volhard are names to be recog-
nized in this effort.
Preparing for the test
The test is ideally administered by someone unfamiliar to the 
dog in an unfamiliar environment because you’re interested in 
the dog’s initial reactions to someone he doesn’t know. If you’re
meeting the puppy for the first time, and you’re confident in your
ability, simply ask the breeder or facility to grant you access to a
private room to employ the following series of exercises.
If you’re familiar with the dog or puppy, ask a friend or a profes-
sional to give the test. If you’d like to observe, please do so from a
window or distant area in the room so as not to influence the dog’s
reaction to the tester.
Gather these materials for the personality test:
 A stopwatch or a clock with a second hand
 A crumpled ball of paper, a bit smaller than a tennis ball
 A metal pot and spoon
 A leash and collar
 A towel or a rag with a long piece of string attached like a leash

 An umbrella, preferably one that opens using a spring-release
mechanism

Giving the test
This test generally takes 10–15 minutes and should be administered
when the dog is relaxed, such as after a nap, but before mealtime.
(Please check the shelter’s time schedule and make the appoint-
ment ahead of time.) Limit the noise and visual distractions when
testing the dog or puppy.
Test 1: This exercise measures the dog’s social attraction to
humans. The tester kneels on the floor to be level with the puppy 
to appear less threatening (see Figure 5-1). The assistant carries the
puppy into the room and places her about 3 or 4 feet from the tester,
facing him or her. As soon as the dog is on the floor, the tester calls
her. However, don’t use the dog’s name or the word “Come.” The
tester should attract the dog by using a sing-song or playful “Puppy,
puppy, puppy” perhaps assisted by lightly clapping his hands.
If the pup comes to the tester, put a check mark in column S. If she
acts anxious, runs and hides, or stays and whimpers, put a check
in column N. If she ignores the tester or wanders off on her own
agenda, mark column I. If she comes readily but then jumps up on
the tester or mouths or nips his hands, or if she doesn’t come at 
all but growls, check column A.
Test 2: This exercise, which looks at the pup’s attention and will-
ingness to follow or stay with a person, is also a test of social
attraction. The tester stands and verbally encourages the dog to
follow by saying “Puppy, puppy, puppy” (not the dog’s name) as
the tester walks forward and pats her leg (see Figure 5-2).
If you’re testing an older dog, avoid using familiar terms, such as
“Heel,” “Come,” or “Let’s go.”
Chapter 5: Identifying Your Dog’s Individuality 67
Can you modify your dog’s personality?
While you can’t change your dog’s genetic makeup and the predispositions that
make up his personality, you can certainly influence many of his behaviors. A dog
that is naturally dominant and aggressive can learn to control those behaviors in
many circumstances; a dog that is naturally shy and fearful can learn to deal with
frequently occurring events that initially frightened him.
In Chapter 11, we provide tools and techniques that can be effective in shaping
behaviors, and in Chapters 8 and 12, we outline specific socialization, training, and
problem-solving exercises to help you positively influence your dog’s personality.

Figure 5-1: Test 1 for social attraction involving approaching a person.
If the dog follows readily, check S. If the dog runs away or doesn’t
move while acting anxiously or whimpering, check N. If she doesn’t
follow at all or wanders off without any signs of nervousness,
check I. If she follows immediately, but gets underfoot while
mouthing or nipping at the tester’s feet, check A.
Tests 3 through 5 measure the balance of dominant and submissive
traits and a puppy/dog’s willingness to accept human leadership
when socially or physically forced to submit or comply.
Using these tests on a mature dog that has a history of aggression
is both unwise and unsafe. If you’re testing an older dog, conduct
these tests carefully. Immediately terminate any test in which the
dog growls or snarls, entering a check in the A column and moving
on to the next test, or terminating the test session if you feel the
least bit threatened.
Test 3: This exercise involves kneeling on the floor and gently rolling
the pup onto its back so that his legs are pointing up, as in Figure 5-3.
The assistant starts the stopwatch while the tester’s hand exerts 
just enough pressure on the dog’s chest to keep her on her back. 
The tester should look directly at the dog with a nonsmiling but 
nonthreatening expression. If the dog looks away, don’t force eye
contact. When the assistant indicates that 30 seconds have passed,
the test is over, and the puppy should be released immediately.
If the pup initially struggles but then settles down or gives up,
check S. If the pup doesn’t struggle and tries to avoid eye contact,
whimpers, or dribbles urine, check N. If the dog struggles a bit on
and off throughout the time period and doesn’t seem to be settling
down, check I. If the dog struggles fiercely throughout the 30 sec-
onds, or if the dog tries to bite or growls at any point, check A.

68

Figure 5-2: Test 2 for social attraction involving following a person.
Figure 5-3: Test 3 for social dominance when the puppy is restrained.
Test 4: This next test measures a dog’s forgiveness, so it must be
done immediately after Test 3, because the dog has just been phys-
ically restrained and may hold a grudge for that. It begins with the
tester kneeling down and placing the puppy in a sitting position in
front of him, as shown in Figure 5-4. The dog should face the tester,
Chapter 5: Identifying Your Dog’s Individuality 69

not directly, but at an angle of about 45 degrees. Now the tester
should begin to stroke the pup slowly and gently with one hand
starting at the head and continuing down to the tail. All the while,
the tester should talk quietly to the dog, while leaning with his face
close enough for the puppy to lick it if she wants to.
If the dog snuggles closer to the tester and tries to lick his face or
squirms a bit and licks the tester’s hands, check the S column. If
the dog rolls over and then licks the tester’s hands or tries to move
away, check N. If the pup growls, mouths, or nips, check A. If the
dog seems unresponsive, neither approaching nor moving away,
and seems unconcerned and uninterested, check I.
Test 5: This social dominance test measures a dog’s response
when she’s placed in a vulnerable position. The evaluator bends
over the puppy, who is facing in the opposite direction, and lifts
her so that her legs are just off of the ground (see Figure 5-5). An
assistant can time 30 seconds before the pup is returned to the
ground. (Obviously you can’t easily do this test with larger dogs.)
If the pup is relaxed and doesn’t struggle, or if she struggles briefly
and then settles down, check S. If the pup doesn’t struggle but
whimpers or runs away when placed back on the ground, check N.
If the pup struggles fiercely for most of the interval, runs away
when placed back on the ground, or growls, nips, mouths, or barks
while being held or when returned to the ground, check A. If the
dog seems unresponsive and simply wanders away as if nothing
happened when returned to the ground, check I.
Figure 5-4: Test 4 for social forgiveness.
Part II: Embracing Your Dog’s Identity 
70

Figure 5-5: Test 5 for social dominance when puppy doesn’t have control.
Test 6: This test involves retrieving, which shows a dog’s willing-
ness to work with people. The evaluator kneels, placing the puppy
just in front of his knees, as shown in Figure 5-6. Dangle a crum-
pled-up ball of paper (slightly smaller than a tennis ball) in front 
of the puppy’s face — tease the dog, as well as verbally bait her:
“Do you want it?” The moment the puppy shows any interest, toss
the ball 3 feet in front of her. If the puppy sets out to retrieve it, the
evaluator should back up a few feet and cheer the puppy back to
his side.
If the puppy returns (even part way) with the paper or if she drops
the paper but still comes back to the tester, check S. If the pup
chases the paper ball and then stands over it and doesn’t return,
or if she starts to chase the paper and then loses interest, check I.
If the pup fails to chase the paper at all, moves away from the
tester (and the paper), or seems simply uninterested and doesn’t
move toward the paper ball, check I. If the pup chases the paper,
picks it up, and then runs away, check A.
Chapter 5: Identifying Your Dog’s Individuality 71

Figure 5-6: Test 6 for willingness to retrieve.
Test 7: This exercise focuses on a puppy’s touch sensitivity, noting
that a dog who is too touch sensitive is often hard to handle. It
involves pinching the pup’s ear flap three times, starting with
medium force, with the next pinch being medium hard, and the last
very hard. The tester should practice beforehand on himself (not
the pup) by squeezing the forefinger of one hand between the
thumb and forefinger.
Make sure that the squeeze doesn’t involve gouging with fingernails.
The tester should grasp the flap of the dog’s ear between his
thumb and forefinger and give the first pinch, followed by the
second and third separated by about two seconds (see Figure 5-7).
If the pup responds to the first or second pinch by whimpering or
yelping, stop the test immediately and check column N. If at any
point the pup growls, mouths, or nips, stop immediately and check
A. If, on the second or third pinch, the pup tries to pull her head or

What does retrieving have to 
do with personality?
Clarence Pfaffenberger developed a puppy evaluation test to determine the prob-
able success of puppies chosen to guide the blind. Until the mid-1940s, when he
first became involved in Guide Dog selection and training, only 9 percent of the dogs
successfully finished the training program. When Pfaffenberger started a testing
program, he found that the best single indicator of whether a dog would success-
fully complete the program was whether she would retrieve as a puppy.
Pfaffenberger believed that retrieving at this age was really a test of willingness to
work for and with humans.

body away, or turns to look at your face without any other
response, check S. If the pup seems unresponsive or uncaring
during the whole test, check column I.
Figure 5-7: Test 7 for touch sensitivity.
Test 8: This exercise focuses on a puppy’s threshold of excitement
as it relates to unfamiliar sounds. When applying this test, the
puppy should face away from the direction of the sound and not
interact with the evaluator until the exercise is finished. An assis-
tant hidden from view should give three sharp raps of a metal
spoon against a metal pot and should then freeze in position,
avoiding eye contact with the dog (see Figure 5-8).
If the dog acts interested and moves toward the sound or obvi-
ously listens and orients her head curiously in the direction of the
sound, even if she seems startled at first, check S. If the pup barks
in the direction of the sound or growls or mouths the assistant,
check column A. If the pup cringes, backs off, or tries to hide,
check N. If the pup locates the sound but stays in place and barks,
enter a check mark in column S. If the pup ignores the sound com-
pletely or only gives a quick flick of its head in the direction of the
sound and then looks away, check I.
Test 9: This test measures a pup’s reaction to unusual, but nonthreat-
ening, events. Initially, an assistant stands off to the side, holding on
to the end of a string tied to the end of a towel. The assistant then
jerks the towel in regular intervals toward himself (see Figure 5-9).
If the dog looks at the test object, displays curiosity by approach-
ing, or tries to investigate it, check S. If the dog ignores the test
object, check I. If the dog lunges, stands fast and barks at the
towel, growls, or attacks it, check A. If the pup shies away or hides
from the towel, check N.
Chapter 5: Identifying Your Dog’s Individuality 73

Figure 5-8: Test 8 for sound sensitivity.
Figure 5-9: Test 10 for reaction to potentially threatening events.
Test 10: This exercise tests a puppy’s reaction to a perceived
threat. The assistant should position himself about 6 feet from 
the dog, quietly holding an umbrella (one that opens on a spring
release is best). Now the evaluator should turn the pup so that
she’s facing in between the assistant and the tester, as shown in
Figure 5-10). When the puppy is looking toward the assistant, she
should open the umbrella quickly, quietly setting it on the floor
without looking or addressing the puppy.
Part II: Embracing Your Dog’s Identity 
74

If the dog reacts but regains its composure within a moment and
then approaches to investigate the umbrella, check S. If the dog
stands and barks, or approaches and growls or snaps at the
umbrella, check A. If the dog tries to run or hide, check N. If the
dog shows little or no interest in the umbrella, check I.
Test 11: The next test measures possessiveness.
If the puppy you’re testing has many checks in the “A” column, be
mindful of her reaction. An aggressive puppy may bite if her growls
aren’t met with an immediate withdrawal. If the puppy/dog growls,
consider this candidate seriously: She’ll require mindful and con-
sistent training and isn’t suitable for a family with any exposure to
young children.
Place a bowl on the floor and add kibbles to it. When the pup has
started to eat, use a long stick, broom handle, or baseball bat to
pull the bowl away from her, as shown in Figure 5-11. If the pup
looks at you and wags her tail expectantly, put a check in the S
column. If she runs away or acts as if she is now too upset to eat,
check N. If she growls, barks, bites the stick, or jumps on you to
get the food back, check A. If she acts as if she’s uninterested in
the food after all, check I.
Figure 5-10: Test 9 for reaction to novel events.
Test 12: If the puppy you’re evaluating is comfortable on a leash
and collar, lead her to an unfamiliar room or, if inoculated, outside.
Observe your candidate’s behavior as you walk around the block
or circle the house. Try to find birds, cats, squirrels, or people for
the puppy to encounter. If the pup stays close to you even though
she’s showing a curious interest in things going on around her,
Chapter 5: Identifying Your Dog’s Individuality 75

check S. If the pup acts nervous and scared and tries to run from
any encounter, check N. If the pup barks and lunges at everything,
check A. If the pup acts uninterested in anything that you try to
point out to her and shows interest in only occasional things that
she finds for herself, check I.
Figure 5-11: Test 11 for social dominance and guarding of possessions.
Evaluating Your Adult Dog
If you’ve shared life with a dog for some time, you already know a
lot about her personality. If you haven’t given it much thought, we
encourage you to use the following questionnaire to determine
your dog’s personality. This test is designed to measure the per-
sonality of an adult dog (actually, any dog older than 6 months)
who has lived with you for at least one month.
Of course, as every parent knows (whether your child walks on
two legs or four), you may have a bit of bias. As you ponder these
behavioral adjectives, check with a family member or friend. The
purpose of this test is for you to learn the real nature of your dog’s
personality.
This test is made up of a set of words or short phrases, which 
are descriptions that can apply to a dog. For each one, your task 
is to consider whether that description applies to your dog. If it
does, then simply put a check mark next to it. If not, leave that
word blank and go on to the next. Check all items that describe
your dog.

Scoring the personality tests
Both the puppy and adult personality tests use the same final score
sheet and general interpretation scheme. For the puppy personality
test, the scoring is quite simple. Using the score sheet in Table 5-2,
simply count the number of check marks in the column marked S,
Chapter 5: Identifying Your Dog’s Individuality 77

and enter that total on the line marked S below. Count the check
marks in columns N, A, and I, and enter their totals, respectively, in
the score sheet, and you’re now ready for interpretation.
Table 5-2
Personality Score Totals
Interpretation
Enter Total
S
Sociable, responsive, adaptable, 
and people-oriented
N
Nervous, shy, or unsure
A
Dominant, aggressive, or controlling
I
Independent, indifferent, 
and uninvolved 
For the adult personality test, look back at the list of items. Notice
that each item has a little number superscripted just behind it.
These numbers are your scoring codes. First go through the list
and count all the items you checked that have the number 1 code.
(Remember, you’re counting the total number of checks, not
adding the scores.) That total is entered on the line marked S in
the score sheet. Next count all the items you checked with the
number 2 code, and this total is entered in the line marked A. The
total number of items that you checked with the number 3 code
goes on the line marked I, and the total with the number 4 code
goes on the line marked N.
Interpreting the personality tests
For each of the tests, you can look at the total scores and get a gen-
eral overview of the dog’s personality. The category that has the
largest total score shows what kind of a dog you’re dealing with
and allows you to generally predict what you may expect from her.
For the puppy test, the general personality classification is the
kind of dog the pup will mostly grow up to be. However, because
the dog is still young, its personality can still be somewhat shaped
and modified by how you treat it and the kinds of experiences that
it has in the future and as it matures.
For the adult test scores, we’re looking at a broader range of
behaviors so that we can be a bit subtler in our description of the
dog. In essence, the adult has had more time and experience in the
world, which has molded her behavior so that we can pick up on
some nuances and shadings.
Part II: Embracing Your Dog’s Identity 
78

We’re measuring four basic dimensions:
 Sociability (scale S) is really more than its name suggests. An
important aspect of this personality dimension is friendliness
and a desire to interact with others — what some researchers
may call a pack drive.
Dogs that score high on this dimension bond well with people,
and because they look to humans (or other dogs) for guidance
and feedback, they’re extremely adaptable. These dogs are
probably best for first-time owners and people who want a 
low threat, low hassle, and friendly family pet.
Chapter 5: Identifying Your Dog’s Individuality 79
Some interesting combinations
At times, the adult personality scale allows a greater range of interpretation
because each dimension can go up to a score of 15, and a score on one dimension
doesn’t affect the scores on the others. A score of 11 to 15 is considered high. A
score of 5 or less is low, while scores between 6 and 10 are midrange. Here are a
few special combinations:
High Sociability, High Dominance, Low Nervousness, and Low Independence:
These dogs enjoy working, have a strong sense of themselves, and aren’t easily
stressed. Highly motivated, these dogs require a delicate balance of firmness and
structured inclusion to bring out the best in them.
Medium Sociability and Dominance with Low Nervousness and Low
Independence: These are easily trained dogs who are easy to get along with and
aren’t easily flustered or distracted. This combination makes good all-around dogs.
High Sociability, Low Dominance, Low Nervousness, and Low Independence:
These dogs are laid-back and loving, seldom, if ever, frantic or hyper, and an ideal
pet for families or novice dog owners.
Assertive/Aggressive: Two combinations of personality scores may be difficult to
deal with in the wrong environment. The first is the dog with High Dominance and
High Nervousness with Low Sociability and Low Independence. This dog is highly
reactive when startled, and, when fearful, may snap out at anyone — friend, family,
or stranger. This dog may also show displaced aggression when overstimulated,
striking out at anyone if she’s unable to attack the source of her frustration.
The second troublesome personality combination is the dog with High Dominance
and High Independence with Low Sociability and Low Nervousness. This dog is
often more focused on her own needs than on the collective dynamics of her group.
Unless coached with persistence, this dog may use aggression to modify others
and as a means to get his way.

 Nervous/Shy (scale N) is a measure of both how submissive
and how reactive a dog is. A high score indicates a puppy/dog
who is notably reactive to change or stimulation. Common
adjectives include “shy,” “timid,” and “skittish.” Common 
complaints include “easily frightened,” “afraid of men with
hats (or beards or glasses),” “frightened by the sound of
trucks (or vacuums, thunder, or crowds),” “uneasy around
children (or large dogs or flickering lights),” and so on.
Unless extensively socialized, these dogs are unpredictable
and react to any fluctuation in their schedule or unexpected
events. Though not a family dog candidate, this dog can flour-
ish with a steady trainer and predictable environment, as
found with single people, an adult couple, or older persons
without grandchildren. In these settings, these dogs are often
affectionate and needy: a good match for the right person.
The greater the score in the N range, the more unsteady the
dog will be when interrupted or stressed. This dog necessi-
tates more patience and support and isn’t recommended for
families or social people who intend to bring their dog along
with them wherever they go.
 High scores in the Aggressive/Dominant (scale A) area indi-
cate dogs that are active and pushy and who may not hesitate
to use aggression to get or keep what they want. Common
adjectives include “dominant,” “pushy,” and “snappish.”
Common complaints are “suspicious of men in raincoats 
(or dark-skinned men, or men smoking),” “aggressive toward
children (or puppies or any other dogs),” “snatches treats,”
“barks at strangers,” “jumps assertively,” and “watches
strangers in the home.”
Dogs in this category require careful watching and a lot of
training to put them under control. Untrained or mismanaged,
these dogs may assert themselves over whomever they can:
children and other pets decidedly not excluded. In the right
home, however, these dogs can be managed, trained, and
appreciated. A high score in this area indicates a high-intensity
performance drive. Active, curious, and driven, these dogs
excel at specific activities, such as agility or flyball, or service
tasks, such as tracking or bomb detection. Though not dogs
for the average family or novice handler, they can make good
reliable companions who will devote themselves to a handler
that is just a little more dominant than they are.
If your dog has bitten you or anyone else, please get 
professional help. Active aggression is beyond the scope 
of this book.
Part II: Embracing Your Dog’s Identity 
80

 Dogs with high scores in the Independent (scale I) dimension
can be standoffish, stubborn, and uncooperative, committing
to family affairs on their terms alone. Comfortable with their
own agenda, these dogs relate to people when prompted by a
positive source, such as food or a favorite activity. Many of
the instinctive breeds (from the Terrier or Hound groups, for
example) score high on this scale, as they weren’t bred to
work with man, but rather on their own, tracking or hunting
game. Lest anyone discard this group of dogs altogether,
they’re ideal for many situations, such as living with people
who are busy or away from home for regular stretches.
Dogs that score high on the independence range are often
more distractible, prioritizing their environment over human
direction.

Interpreting Your Dog’s
Breed-Specific Traits
In This Chapter

 Sorting out mixed breeds
 Predicting dog behaviors from breeds
I
n this chapter, we take the word breed and look at its value in
helping you understand your dog. If you’ve ever watched a dog
show, you’ve probably noticed a lot of different types of dogs
prancing around the ring all prim and proper, some with little
bows, others with their fur sculpted like ornamental hedges. In
case you have the idea that a breed is nothing more than a fashion
statement, we’ll take the time to educate you on the psychological,
emotional, and physical needs and differences between each and
every dog breed you see.
What Are Dog Breeds?
The essence of creating specific breeds of dogs was to guarantee that
useful characteristics were passed on from one generation to the
next. Careful breeding records were kept for each puppy, tracing its
genetic lineage and establishing a group of dogs that were purebred.
The job of kennel clubs is to file and organize all the breeding
records of each dog, and to record every mating to ensure that
there has been no outbreeding, which is simply defined as mixed
matings between dogs of different recognized breeds. Kennel clubs
also establish the standard of the breed, which is simply a descrip-
tion of what the ideal dog of a particular breed should look like,
what its distinctive natural behaviors are, and what its personality
or temperament should be like.

The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognizes around 160 breeds of
dogs categorized into seven groups: sporting dogs, hounds, working
dogs, terriers, toy dogs, nonsporting dogs, and herding dogs. The
AKC is sort of the Microsoft of dog clubs and serves as the standard
around the world, so we refer to its listing throughout the book.
The AKC also has a Miscellaneous Class for breeds recognized in
other countries or by other kennel clubs, but that aren’t yet recog-
nized by the kennel club. Nearly every year, one or more breeds
are recognized and moved from the Miscellaneous Class to one of
the other groups, and additional new breeds are added to the
Miscellaneous Class.
Several breeds of dogs were created based on their aesthetic
appearance alone. The Cairn Terrier and West Highland White
Terriers, for example, started out as the same breed. In each litter,
some dogs were white, and some weren’t. Because the whites pro-
duced other white-colored dogs when interbred, they were sepa-
rated into two distinct breeds. Structurally and behaviorally, the
two breeds remain virtually identical. The Norfolk and the Norwich
Terriers are another example of breeds that only differ in the shape
of their ears (Norwich has pricked ears and Norfolk floppy ears).
This division of dogs based solely on appearance is a distortion 
of what breeds are all about. Dogs were originally domesticated
because they had skills and behavioral traits that made them useful.
What makes this important for understanding the psychology of
dogs is that creating a breed was originally an attempt to create
lines of dogs that had predictable behaviors and temperaments.
A New Breed of Dog Classification
In the interests of presenting breeds according to their behavior
and psychology, we divide the AKC’s seven groupings into 
Part II: Embracing Your Dog’s Identity 
84
Checking out the top dog shows
Westminster Kennel Club and Crufts are two world-renowned dog shows that high-
light the top dogs in each breed recognized in their kennel club roster. Crufts, the
largest dog exhibition event in the world (attracting more than 20,000 entries each
year), began in England in 1886. The Westminster Dog Show (whose winners are
considered to be the top dogs in North America) is held at Madison Square Gardens
in New York and began its competitions in 1877. Check them out on television or in
person if you’re able.

subgroups. Each group is based on a dog’s breed’s individual
behavioral characteristics.
For example, we divide the dogs in the herding group into drovers
(who work more independently and move flocks over great 
distances) and herd minders (who move flocks about the farm, 
generally under the guidance of a shepherd). Behaviorally speak-
ing, drovers are more independent and likely to roam, where as
herders are intensely focused and stay centered about their flock.
Sporting dogs
Sporting dogs are bred to help man hunt. Though blasting a
defenseless duck from the sky likely isn’t necessary for survival,
don’t tell your dog. He still views his purpose with high regard.
Fortunately, you don’t have to take up hunting to keep one of these
dogs happy: a tennis ball or Frisbee works just fine. However,
knowing specifically what your dog was bred to hunt can help 
you better understand your dog’s behavior.
The Labrador and Golden Retrievers are among the most com-
monly used service dogs, assisting blind or handicapped people,
and also detecting drugs or explosives and assisting in search-and-
rescue tasks.
Go to England, and you’ll find the hunting dogs under the title Gun
Dogs. In America, they’re referred to as sporting dogs.
The sporting group actually contains five different types of dog,
each of which has somewhat different purposes and thus may be
expected to have different behavior patterns:
 Retrievers: Dogs in this group are bred to retrieve fallen
game, which turns out, in family life, to be a dog who is alert,
has a good memory, and is eager to participate and please.
Because their intended purpose demanded close human 
contact and direction, retrievers are sociable and attentive.
Chesapeake Bay Retriever, Curly Coat Retriever, Flat Coat
Retriever, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, Miniature
Poodle, Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, Standard Poodle.
 Pointers: These scouts of the dog world have an attentive eye
and nose for game. Though they work more independently
than a retriever, and certainly have been bred to expend more
energy in the pursuit of quarry, the pointers are patient —
originally so patient they would hold a pointing pose until 
the hunter got into position and (finally) released. Brittany
Spaniel, English Pointer, German Shorthaired Pointer, German
Wirehaired Pointer, Pointer, Wirehaired Pointing Griffon.
Chapter 6: Interpreting Your Dog’s Breed-Specific Traits 85

When a pointer finds game, it exhibits a behavior that contra-
dicts evolution. Instead of rushing forward to capture its
quarry, a pointer freezes in position with its head pointing 
to where it believes the quarry is hiding.
 Setters: Pointers and setters have a lot in common. Think of
setters as being faster and more exuberant versions of point-
ers. Their name comes from an old English alternative for the
word sitter. Like pointers, their job was to find the game and
then indicate its position to the hunter by sitting or crouching
down and looking directly at it. They then had to hold that
position until the hunters had time to drop a net over the
covey of birds. English Setter, Gordon Setter, Irish Setter.
 Spaniels: These are high-energy hunting dogs that have been
bred to quarter the field to find and flush game. When they’re
working, they dash around searching for scents. However,
when they find their quarry, they don’t wait for the hunter,
but simply charge at the birds to cause them to take flight so
that the hunter can take his shot. When their hunting genes
are no longer in high demand, exercise and interaction will 
be! American Water Spaniel, Clumber Spaniel, Cocker Spaniel,
English Cocker Spaniel, English Springer Spaniel, Field Spaniel,
Irish Water Spaniel, Sussex Spaniel, Welsh Springer Spaniel.
The name spaniel was given to them because of their friendly,
loving nature. The span in spaniel is for Spain, which at the
time was considered to be the nation of lovers.
 Multipurpose hunting dogs: Some hunters set their sights on
creating an all-around, multipurpose hunting dog who would
do all the main functions, such as pointing, flushing, and
retrieving game. These stunning adaptations, basically mixing
other dogs from the preceding groups, have all the general
demands of a sporting dog, yet all the benefits, too. Portuguese
Water Dog, Vizsla, Weimaraner.
These manipulations of dogs continue today, and there is now
a line of Pointing Labrador Retrievers, which, as the name
indicates, not only retrieve but point as well and they may
someday be a separate breed.
Hounds
“You ain’t nothing but a hound dog” doesn’t actually reflect favor-
ably on these loving, though independent, dogs. Hounds are also
hunting dogs, but were designed to work without human guidance
Part II: Embracing Your Dog’s Identity 
86

or intervention. The human hunter is only needed if the game finds
refuge in a den, burrow, or tree or is too large and dangerous for
the dogs to kill. In all other cases, these hounds are supposed to 
be able to dispatch their target when they catch it, without any
human help. How does this play out in today’s society? These dogs
are still motivated chiefly by their passions, though they’re often
amiable and happy-go-lucky.
Hounds naturally fall into two clear groupings:
 Scent hounds: These dogs are supposed to track their quarry
by the faint odor they leave as they move over the landscape.
Their noses are highly developed for this purpose. American
and English Foxhounds, Basset, Beagle, Black and Tan
Coonhound, Bloodhound, Harrier, Otterhound.
 Sight hounds: These dogs have keen eyesight and tremendous
speed. Their task is to visually locate their quarry in the 
distance and run it down. Afghan Hound, Basenji, Borzoi,
Greyhound, Irish Wolfhound, Saluki, Scottish Deerhound, Whippet.
Though we don’t depend on hounds for our sustenance, their
instinct to hunt is still very much intact. Let a scent hound (such
as a beagle) loose, and he’s likely to disappear, whatever the ter-
rain, as he follows some interesting smells. Unharnessed, a sight
hound won’t be able to resist the temptation of chasing after a
mobile tidbit, which may be a neighbor’s cat or a kid on a skate-
board. Best to keep these dogs leashed in open areas at all times.
Chapter 6: Interpreting Your Dog’s Breed-Specific Traits 87
The fastest animal in the world?
When creating special-purpose dogs, humans developed some breeds that can run
much faster than wolves or other wild animals. The fastest of these are the sight
hounds, and the greyhound is the gold medalist. While the average dog can run
about 19 miles per hour, greyhounds can run at speeds of 35 to 40 miles per hour.
You may have heard that the cheetah is the fastest animal in the world, because it
can dash at speeds around 65 mph. However, this speed is reached only for short
runs that may last a few seconds and seldom covers more than an eighth of a mile.
Greyhounds, however, can run at their top speed for distances as great as 7 miles.
That means that although the cheetah can win the short sprint race, in any long
race, the greyhound will leave him way behind, panting in the dust. So who really is
the fastest animal in the world?

Working dogs
Working dogs like to . . . work. They’re a task-oriented group that
feels most fulfilled when they have a job. Though each dog in this
group shares a practical function, the behaviors and tempera-
ments needed for varying tasks can be quite varied and different:
 Guard dogs: These dogs were originally designed to protect
livestock or territories without any human direction. Though
a person may not desire such a devoted guardian in their
home today, this point needs to be driven home. Both then
and now, a human didn’t have to be home to trigger defensive
reactions. Bullmastiff, Dalmatian, Great Dane, Great Pyrenees,
Komondor, Kuvasz, Mastiff, Rottweiler.
 Personal-protection dogs: Although these dogs are also guard
dogs, they differ in that they’re supposed to work intimately
with people, under direct human control. Think of it this way:
A guard dog is like an automated security system, while a 
personal-protection dog is more like a human body guard.
Boxer, Doberman Pinscher, Giant Schnauzer, Rhodesian
Ridgeback, Standard Schnauzer.
 Draft dogs: These dogs were bred to pull carts and carry
packs. Most people have difficulty recognizing how important
dogs were for transportation prior to the invention of motor
vehicles. Dog-drawn carts were perfect for old cities where
streets were often too narrow for a horse cart to negotiate.
Furthermore a working man could keep his dog in his house
with his family, with no need to have a stable and outbuild-
ings. Bernese Mountain Dog, Newfoundland, Saint Bernard.
The Rottweiler actually began as draft dog, pulling butchers’
carts and then guarding it while the butcher was inside
making deliveries. After awhile, however, its guarding func-
tions became more important so we now classify its breed 
as a guard dog instead of a draft dog.
 Spitz-type dogs: These northern dogs are bred to withstand
cold temperatures, and many were intended to pull sleds.
These dogs have pricked ears, sharp muzzles, a flowing tail
that curls high over their backs, and often dense insulating
coats. That tail carried high may be all that distinguishes
some of these dogs from arctic wolves, and their tempera-
ment often reflects this upbringing as well because they’re 
frequently suspicious of strangers and are very concerned
about dominance and status in their social life. Akita, Alaskan
Malamute, Chow Chow, Keeshond, Norwegian Elkhound,
Samoyed, Schipperke, Siberian Husky
Part II: Embracing Your Dog’s Identity 
88

Terriers
Terriers may be big, small, and every size in-between. These tena-
cious, spirited dogs add punch to the word “zing.” Bred originally
to keep homes and farms vermin-free, they bring their original
feistiness and heart into the 21st century. As history progressed,
certain breeds were streamlined, and the “fight” was accentuated
in certain breeds that were ultimately changed into fighters for 
the amusement of humans. Though this “sport” still continues in
underground circles, the current breeders of the fighting terriers
have been mindful to diminish this impulse by selective breeding.
Terriers fall into two main groups:
 Vermin hunters: The majority of terriers were purchased and
bred to rid homes and farmland of all sorts of pests — from 
a lowly mouse to foxes, badgers, and other poultry-killing
vermin. Many of the breeds were deliberately kept small and
agile to meet the task of digging underground, or wriggling
their way into burrows or dens to find their targets. The coats
of the terrier also played into their design because their
rough, hard, or wiry coats can protect them against abrasion
from rocks and rough ground and also provide a kind of armor
against the teeth of their quarry.
The size differential also gives a clue into the exercise require-
ments of the individual breed, as short-legged terriers were
carried in a basket on horseback during hunts, whereas larger
terriers were designed to run with horses and hounds on the
hunt. Airedale Terrier, Australian Terrier, Bedlington Terrier,
Border Terrier, Boston Terrier, Cairn Terrier, Dachshund, Dandi
Dinmont Terrier, Irish Terrier, Kerry Blue Terrier, Lakeland
Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Miniature Schnauzer, Norfolk
Terrier, Norwich Terrier, Parson Jack Russell Terrier, Scottish
Terrier, Sealyham Terrier, Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier, Silky
Terrier, Skye Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Welsh Terrier, Wire
Fox Terrier, West Highland White Terrier.
 Fighting dogs: Some dogs were bred specifically to partici-
pate in blood sports. They were put into arenas (called pits)
and forced to fight bulls, bears, or other dogs. The natural
scrappiness of the terrier was enhanced to make these dogs
tough and willing to fight. American Staffordshire Bull Terrier,
Bull Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier.
Expecting a terrier not to bark may be the definition of asking too
much. Specifically, all terriers were bred to bark, and barking is
part of the definition of a terrier’s behavior. Though the necessity
to alert a hunter to the location of the quarry by barking isn’t often
Chapter 6: Interpreting Your Dog’s Breed-Specific Traits 89

sought after by terrier owners, it comes with the package. Though
you may be able to curb the tenacity (see Chapter 13), the urge to
be heard will never go away completely.
Toy dogs
Though decidedly not toys, each of the dogs in this group were bred
for one purpose and one purpose alone: to be cuddled. Though they
are quintessential companions and require less exercise than larger
dogs, these breeds still have the heart and mind equivalent to that
found in much bigger dogs. Though the urge to baby these dogs 
may be overwhelming, hold off spoiling them until you have some
structure in place. Otherwise, as they say, you’ll pay the price.
Affenpinscher, Bichon Frise, Brussels Griffon, Bulldog, Cavalier King
Charles Spaniel, Chihuahua, English Toy Spaniel, French Bulldog,
Italian Greyhound, Japanese Chin, Lhasa Apso, Maltese, Miniature
Pinscher, Papillion, Pekingese, Pomeranian, Pug, Shih Tzu, Tibetan
Spaniel, Tibetan Terrier, Toy Poodle, Yorkshire Terrier.
Herding dogs
The herding dog group contains dogs that were used, at least origi-
nally, to herd, drive, and protect livestock. Though those traits
aren’t often necessary, don’t tell a herding dog. Task-oriented and
driven, they’ll find something to herd or protect — and watch out.
If you don’t provide a proper outlet, the one they may be herding
or protecting just might be you! There are actually two types of
herding dogs:
 Drovers: These hardy dogs were bred to drive sheep and
cattle over long distances, often with minimal or no direction
from humans for long periods of time. Australian Cattle Dog,
Bouvier Des Flandres, Briard, Cardigan Corgi, Pembroke Corgi.
 Herd minders: These dogs were indispensable to shepherds
because of their ability to keep herds of animals together 
and to move them short distances. They work closely with,
and under the direction of, a human shepherd. At home, this
turns into a dog who will either look to you and your family 
as a sheep or a shepherd. In short, you better train, or be
trained. Australian Shepherd, Bearded Collie, Belgian Malinois,
Belgian Shepherd, Belgian Tervuren, Border Collie, Collie,
German Shepherd Dog, Old English Sheepdog, Puli, Shetland
Sheepdog.
Part II: Embracing Your Dog’s Identity 
90

Nonsporting dogs
The American Kennel Club originally had only two groups of dogs,
sporting dogs and nonsporting dogs. The current AKC classification
is much broader in scope. However, it still keeps this group as a
sort of catchall for breeds it has problems classifying.
In our manuscript, we’ve chosen to eliminate this classification
and sort these breeds into the preceding groups.
Predicting Behavior from Breed
Using the preceding 16 group classifications of dog breeds, we
apply some scientific research out of the University of British
Columbia that estimates that one half of the genetic makeup of 
any dog is genetically based.
In that study, 98 dog experts were surveyed and asked to rate 
the breeds on 22 aspects of their behavior. After much statistical
analysis, it was found that, in reality, five important behavior
dimensions existed, and systematic differences occurred among
the various breed groups on these dimensions. The following 
sections look at these ratings to see how the different dog 
breeds stack up.
Chapter 6: Interpreting Your Dog’s Breed-Specific Traits 91
Mixed breed dogs — the “love child”
If knowing a dog’s breed allows you to predict a dog’s behavior, how can you assess
the behavior of a mixed breed dog?
Fortunately, based on research from the Jackson Laboratories in Bar Harbour,
Maine, indicators suggest that form predicts function. It seems that data shows that
a mixed breed dog is most likely to act like the breed that it most looks like. Thus, if
a Labrador Retriever/Poodle cross looks much like a Labrador Retriever, it will prob-
ably act much like a Labrador Retriever. If it looks more like a Poodle, its behavior
will be very Poodle-like.
The more of a blend that the dog’s physical appearance seems to be, the more likely
that the dog’s behavior will be a blend of the two parent breeds.

Intelligence and learning ability
The first important dimension is a measure of how easily a dog
learns and solves problems, which is generally what people mean
by intelligence. It also indicates how easy it will be to teach the
dog obedience commands and to perform service activities, which
some dog experts refer to as trainability.
The experts list herding dogs and retrievers at the top of the list in
intelligence, which probably explains why the top-ten lists of dogs in
obedience competitions tend to be dominated by Border Collies,
Shetland Sheepdogs, and Labrador and Golden Retrievers (see Table
6-1). It also probably explains why German Shepherds, Labrador
Retrievers, and Golden Retrievers are frequently the preferred breeds
for service dogs, guide dogs for the blind, and other complex tasks.

Dominance and territoriality
Think of this area as a measure of how “hard” or “soft” your dog 
is in its personality. It’s actually a measure of how assertive and
possessive a dog is. The dogs that are high on this trait make good
watch dogs and guard dogs (see Table 6-2). However, they may also
be demanding, possessive, and pushy. They may guard their pos-
sessions, such as food and toys, vigorously. They’re also willing to
use aggression against people and animals if it suits their purposes.
Dogs low on this trait are unchallenging and nonthreatening.

This trait refers to the dog’s emotional state in the sense of how

moods may rapidly fluctuate from confident to cautious and so on.
A dog that is low on this trait may be much more difficult to excite,
but once excited, it takes much longer to calm down.

or quickly and forcefully grab a treat from its owner’s hand.
Because experts feel that all breeds are capable of periods of high

A
ll animals interpret their environment through a complex 
mingling of information filtered through their five senses:
sight, hearing, smell, touch, and taste. What separates one species
from another is the degree to which each of these senses is used.
Humans, for example, depend primarily on sight to interpret their
environment; a dog, on the other hand, relies heavily on her sense
of smell. To fully comprehend a dog’s life experience, a person
must be willing to look at their environment and daily sensory
stimulation from their dog’s perspective.
Sight, Psychology, and Survival
The human eye is built around the same general design as the
dog’s eye: Both contain cornea, pupil, lens, and retina. Still, major
differences between them affect how images are perceived. People
rely on their visual sense to interpret incoming information about
the world, and our brains use more space and more neurons to
process visual information than they do for any other sense. Dogs
do not process images this way; for them the world is more of an
off-colored and blurred landscape.
A dog’s primary use of sight is to process motion, a skill vital to
their ancestors’ survival. Dependent on the sustenance of hunted
game, their eyes evolved into sharp motion detectors. You’re most
likely to see this skill activated when a dog follows the trajectory of
a toy or chases other animals.

If you’d like to speed up your dog’s learning process, add signals
with a broad motion component to your verbal directions (see
Chapter 12). These hand cues increase your dog’s visual attention
to you and align with her species-engrained impulse to watch a
leader figure for instruction.
Are dogs colorblind?
One of the things that people seem to be most curious about when
it comes to what their dog can see is whether their pup can see
colors. The simple answer that scientists give, namely that dogs
are colorblind, is usually misinterpreted as meaning that dogs see
no color but only shades of gray. This assumption is wrong.
Colorblindness, to the scientist, means that at least one of the
three color receptors found in the normal eye (we have red, 
green, and blue receiving cones) isn’t working. Thus, with only

Hand shy?
Though some dogs are hand shy as a result of being hit, many dogs veer away from
the hand for another reason, namely their evolutionary instinct to avoid sudden
approach or attack. The sight of a human approaching straight on, tone high pitched,
eyes wide open and glaring, often sets a dog’s reactionary impulses in motion. Even
a hand suddenly reaching to pat a dog may spell hesitation or withdrawal.
When you first approach a dog, she’ll be unable to reason your intentions. Speak to
the person at the end of her leash first, and if she says that the dog’s friendly, kneel
down and extend your hand at her nose level. If she turns her head away, respect
her and back off. If she sniffs it, you may pet her from the side or just beneath her
line of vision.
If your dog is suffering hand shyness, offer her a spoonful of a lickable reward or
canned food with one hand as you reach repetitively with your other hand to pat
her head.
Do you have a small dog that backs away from your approach? Do not keep fol-
lowing her: You’ll look like a predator! Shake a treat cup or toy as you kneel down
and encourage her to come to you.
And please, no matter how frustrated you may feel with your dog’s behavior, don’t
run after your dog to catch her. She will run, not out of disrespect, but out of sheer
panic. The light of her life, the one she turns to for reason, is now the one hunting
her. Flip to Part IV to discover a healthier approach to problem solving.

two functioning color systems, an individual can still see colors,
but the range is limited, and he confuses certain colors that a
normal person can perceive as distinct. This situation is the same
with dogs. They do see colors, and they see them well enough 
to help guide their behaviors. However, the colors they see are 
neither as rich nor as many as those seen by humans.
Figure 7-1 shows what a human sees when looking at a rainbow or
a color spectrum and also what a dog sees. Instead of seeing the
rainbow as violet, blue, blue-green, green, yellow, orange, and red,
a dog would see it as dark blue, light blue, gray, light yellow, darker
yellow (sort of brown), and very dark gray. To put it simply, in
addition to gray, black, and white, dogs see the colors of the world
as basically yellow and blue. They see violet, blue, and a cool blue-
green as blue; greenish hues as gray; warm yellow-green, yellow,
and orange as yellow; and red as shades of gray.
Figure 7-1: The colors a human and a dog see when viewing a rainbow.
Do dogs have night vision?
Three attributes of the canine eye allow for clear vision after dark.
The most recognizable is the dog’s pupil, which is much larger
than a human’s. Because the pupil is the opening that lets light into
the eye, the big pupil gives the dog better light-gathering ability.
Still, this skill doesn’t come without a cost. The wide pupil pre-
vents clear focusing on images and objects, and depending upon
their distance, they may appear blurry: A smaller pupil is needed
to have good depth of field.

Chapter 7: Sensory Perceptions 97

The other aspect of a dog’s eye that allows for a wide field of vision
depends upon optics. The dog has a bigger cornea (the clear part
of the eye that bulges out), which allows the collection of more
light. The dog also has a larger lens, which gathers the light from
the cornea and focuses the images that enter the eye. Together
these optical components collect more light and allow better night
vision than is found in the human eye.
Ever wondered why your dog’s eyes reflect in the night, especially
when flashed by oncoming headlights or when spotted by a flash-
light? The effect comes from a component of the eye called the
reflecting tapetum. This mirrorlike surface is located behind the
retina, reflects light not yet absorbed by the light receptor cells,
and gives the light-collecting cells in the retina a second chance at
responding to faint images.
Try this little experiment to discover how different life looks from
the eyes of your dog. Smear a face-sized piece of cellophane with a
light coating of petroleum jelly and look around. Although you can
still make out the general outlines of objects, a lot of the smaller
details are blurred and perhaps even lost.
What about vision on the move?
Dogs have one visual advantage over humans: They can see
moving objects better and faster than we can. This particular skill
is obviously an evolutionary advantage for a hunter who has to
detect his prey and run it down. One study of 14 police dogs found
that the dogs could recognize an object when it was moving 
Part II: Embracing Your Dog’s Identity 
98
Which way did it go?
Walk into any pet store, and you may be immediately drawn to a vibrant orange-
colored object. These brightly colored toys (the color of a utility cone) are becom-
ing increasing popular, although for reasons you may not have imagined. You see,
unless a dog watches the trajectory of the thrown toy, he may run right by it, and
though he may find it by using his nose, he is often puzzled why he can’t see it.
The reason is quite simple. For the dog, the bright orange color of the toy is seen as
nearly the same grayish color as the green grass on which the toy landed. In other
words, it becomes virtually invisible to your pup! The designers of these toys are
clearly concerned about whether the dog’s owner can find the toy easily in the store,
rather than whether the dog can see it clearly on the grass!

even at a distance of over a half a mile, but if that same object 
was stationary and much closer, they had much more difficulty
identifying it.
A dog’s heightened sensitivity to motion explains why some dogs
like to watch TV. The motion elicits their predatory instincts and
causes many dogs (especially hounds and terriers) to jump up and
respond any time a vehicle or animal races across the screen.
Hearing the World
Your dog’s sense of hearing is actually more important to her than
her eyesight. Though she relies on sight for locating and allowing
the grabbing of a moving object, she determines the identity and
relative location of objects by sounds coming from them.
Wild canines with pricked ears can move them to help determine
the location and direction of sounds. Meanwhile, the changes in
sound qualities traveling through the air and deflecting around the
ear flap can help precisely determine the distance away of their
prey or other pack members.
Hearing capacities in comparison
A person’s and dog’s hearing capacities are quite different. While
most people believe that dogs have better hearing than humans,
it’s not the case for all sounds. Rather, the dog’s advantage is 
in her capacity to respond to a far broader range of auditory 
experiences.
To fully grasp the difference in auditory perceptions, it’s helpful to
understand how a noise is recognized by the brain. The noises that
enter the ear can be described as waves: The lower the pitch of the
sound, the lower the frequency of the sound pressure peaks that
hit the ear; the higher the pitch, the greater the frequency of the
wave’s undulations.
The pitch of a sound (high versus low notes) is indicated in a
measurement known in professional circles as a Hertz, or Hz, and
it’s really nothing more than the number of sound pressure peaks
that hit the ear in a second. Sounds that are important for under-
standing human speech range from about 500 to 4,000 Hz, and
humans have ears with their peak sensitivity in that range. Dogs’
hearing isn’t any better than humans for these sounds. The highest
notes that a human can hear are around 20,000 Hz.
Chapter 7: Sensory Perceptions 99

Dogs, on the other hand, evolved from a species that hunted for
survival. Thus, their hearing had to be sensitive to the high-
pitched sounds of animals rustling in the leaves and brush and
emitting scrabbling noises in hidden spaces. For this reason, the
hearing range of dogs extends to much higher frequencies than our
own, to between 47,000 Hz and 60,000 Hz, depending on the breed
and the conformation of a given dog’s ears. It’s not that dogs have
better hearing sensitivity than humans do; it’s simply that they can
hear higher frequency sounds than people can, which gives them a
much broader range of hearing.
Recently, an accurate measure of a dog’s hearing capacity was
made possible by the development of a hearing test known as
Brainstem Auditory Evoked Response (BAER). BAER measures 
the electrical activity in the inner ear and in the neural pathways
that send sound information to the brain. With small electrodes
attached to a dog’s head, short bursts of sound were put into her
ear, and her brain’s response was recorded by a computer.
Calling all cat lovers. This mighty hunter, whose entire sustenance
may depend upon small rodents that make squeaky sounds, can
hear sounds that are 5,000 to 10,000 Hertz higher than can dogs.
Breeds, genetics, and deafness
Some dogs are born with a predisposition toward poor hearing 
or deafness. Research done at Louisiana State University in Baton
Rouge involving nearly 17,000 dogs showed that it’s the dog’s coat
color that is associated with congenital deafness. The genetic
defect that produces deafness is closely linked with the genes that
produce coats that are white, roan (a dark color coat that has been
liberally sprinkled with white), and piebald (spotty, especially
black and white) colors in dogs.
Part II: Embracing Your Dog’s Identity 
100
Freeze
Many of the animals that were hunted by the dog’s wild ancestors evolved a set of
behaviors to take advantage of their visual limitation. Specifically, when being pur-
sued, the prey animals would simply freeze in place. Because of a canine’s lack of
visual acuity, when something is motionless, it becomes virtually invisible. Try this
one out on your dog. Stand very still at a distance of around 20 feet and see whether
your dog responds to you. Remember, the moment you move, the game is over.

The classic example of a piebald dog is the Dalmatian. In this
breed, 22 percent are deaf in one ear, and 8 percent are deaf in
both ears, amounting to an amazing 30 percent born with some
form of hearing deficit. In some breeds of dogs, the white, roan, 
or piebald genes are found in certain individuals, but not others.
For example, a Bull Terrier can be either white or have prominent
color patches. Among those Bull Terriers who are white, the rate 
of congenital deafness is 20 percent, while for those with color
patches, it’s only around 1 percent.
Table 7-1 shows common breeds of dogs that are likely to have
congenital deafness either in one or both ears. The problem usu-
ally becomes apparent in the first month or two of the dog’s life.

Odd as it seems, deafness in a dog can often go unnoticed by its
owner. One of the authors of this book had a Cavalier King Charles
Spaniel named Wiz who had become quite deaf, yet visitors seldom
noticed because he was always present to greet arriving people
Chapter 7: Sensory Perceptions 101
Eyes and ears
Just as coat color makes a difference, eye color also can indicate the likelihood of
deafness in some breeds. Dogs with blue eyes are more likely to be susceptible to
congenital deafness. For example, in Dalmatians with blue eyes, the rates of deaf-
ness can run up to 50 percent. For this reason, some kennel clubs (such as those in
Canada) try to discourage the breeding of blue-eyed Dalmatians by barring them
from the dog show ring.

and always showed up when the other dogs in the house were
called for a treat. The trick was that he was living with two other
dogs who bustled around actively. Seeing and feeling their move-
ments gave him enough information to know what was going on
without his actually being able to hear human sounds.
Often the first sign of hearing impairment in a dog is subtle — it
shows up as an inability to locate sounds accurately. For example,
your dog may act confused when you call her, and she can’t see
you. She may look around uncertainly and come to you only when
she finally lays eyes on you. Or you may notice that when a loud
noise occurs, she swings her head first to the wrong side, away
from the direction that the sound occurred, or acts confused as 
to where the sound came from. Sometimes, this loss of ability to
locate sounds is an indication that your dog has lost hearing in
only one ear, and that her other is still functioning. However, it 
may indicate a more general loss of hearing.
To test your dog’s hearing accuracy, stand behind her and out 
of sight and then either squeak a toy, whistle, or bang two pots.
(Make sure that you’re out of sight and that your dog is unaware 
of your presence.) A normal dog pricks its ears or turns its head 
or body toward the source of the sound.
A newborn puppy is unable to process sound and, in fact, relies on
touch and heat sensors to locate its mother. At three weeks of age,
a puppy’s ears open, although nearly another month is needed for
her to develop mature auditory sensors. When testing for dimin-
ished auditory perception, delay any hearing tests until the pup is
at least six weeks of age for the sake of accuracy.
Part II: Embracing Your Dog’s Identity 
102
Noise pollution
The reason why dogs (and humans) tend to lose their hearing with increasing age is
due to prolonged exposure to loud sounds. Deep in the inner ear, in a structure called
the cochlea, tiny hair cells flex to register the arrival of sounds. Unfortunately, exposure
to loud sounds can cause these hairs to break. Once damaged, a hair cell doesn’t grow
back, so for each hair cell lost, an animal’s hearing ability is diminished.
Some breeds seem to be more predisposed to the deafness associated with aging
than others, particularly hunting dogs, such as retrievers. Though a sensible hunter
wears ear protection to prevent the damaging sounds of gun shots to his own ears,
the same isn’t provided for the dog, and we now know that the sounds of gunshots
can contribute to the late-life loss of hearing in working hunting dogs.

What a Dog’s Nose Knows
A dog’s nose not only dominates her face, but her brain, as well. 
In fact, a dog relies on her sense of smell to interpret her world, in
much the same way as people depend on their sight. Although this
contrasting world view may be hard to imagine, know that your
dog interprets as much information as you do. However, she does
much of this by smelling an object or animal, not by staring at it.
Born to sniff
To gain more respect for your dog’s olfactory ability, compare it to a
person’s nose. Inside the nose of both species are bony scroll-shaped
plates, called turbinates, over which air passes. A microscopic view of
this organ reveals a thick, spongy membrane that contains most of
the scent-detecting cells, as well as the nerves that transport infor-
mation to the brain. In humans, the area containing these odor ana-
lyzers is about one square inch, or the size of a postage stamp. If you
could unfold this area in a dog, on the other hand, it may be as large
as 60 square inches, or just under the size of a piece of typing paper.
Though the size of this surface varies with the size and length of
the dog’s nose, even flat-nosed breeds can detect smells far better
than people. Table 7-2 shows the number of scent receptors in
people and several dog breeds.
A dog’s brain is also specialized for identifying scents. The percent-
age of the dog’s brain that is devoted to analyzing smells is actu-
ally 40 times larger than that of a human! It’s been estimated that
dogs can identify smells somewhere between 1,000 to 10,000 times
better than nasally challenged humans can.

Your dog’s unique nose
Your dog’s nose has a pattern of ridges and dimples that, in combi-
nation with the outline of its nostril openings, make up a nose print
believed to be as individual and unique as a human being’s finger-
prints. Companies even register nose prints as a way of identifying
and helping to locate lost or stolen dogs, a system that is now
being used by kennel clubs around the world.
Part II: Embracing Your Dog’s Identity 
104
Nose work
Human beings have taken advantage of the dog’s wonderful sense of smell to 
perform many important jobs. Some of the better and less well known of these jobs
include
 Detecting drugs, explosives, and weapons
 Tracking lost individuals and fleeing criminals
 Searching for survivors (and dead bodies) after a natural disaster, accident, or
manmade calamity
 Finding termite infestations in homes
 Searching for smuggled food products
 Searching for hydrocarbons (like gasoline or other flammable fluids) that may
have been used in cases of arson
 Finding mold and spores that may cause disease in residences and other buildings
 Detecting oil and gas pipeline leaks, even if the leak is in a pipe buried 30 feet
underground
 Telling by scent when an animal has ovulated, which is useful for dairy farmers
because cows have such a short period in which they’re fertile and can breed.
Recent evidence shows that dogs can detect cancer by scent. Dogs have been reli-
ably trained to find melanoma-type cancers and are able to do so much earlier than
other methods can diagnose it. Current research is being done to see whether blad-
der and prostate cancer can be detected by having the dogs sniff urine samples, and
whether lung cancer can be detected by having dogs sniff a person’s exhaled air.
Finally, some dogs are very sensitive to human moods and can be trained to pick up
the scent changes associated with human emotions. This skill allows them to be
very good at assisting psychotherapists and to assist police in detecting when a
person is lying. Research on this issue is continuing, but there is a suggestion that
dogs may actually be more reliable lie-detectors than the commonly used electronic
apparatus.

If you want to take a nose print from your dog just for fun, it’s quite
simple: Wipe your dog’s nose with a towel to dry its surface. Pour
food coloring onto a paper towel and lightly coat your pet’s nose
with it. Then hold a pad of paper to her nose, making sure to let
the pad’s sides curve around to pick up impressions from the sides
of the nose, as well. You may have to try a couple of times until
you get the right amount of food coloring and the right amount of
pressure to produce a print in which the little patterns on the nose
are clear.
The food coloring is nontoxic and is easily removed. Never use ink
or paint, or you may have to explain to your friends why your dog
has a green or blue nose.

his chapter helps you understand the needs of your growing
puppy. Here, you find all the information on how she thinks
and how best to gauge your expectations at each developmental
stage. During your puppy’s early months, the best investment of
time is to socialize her to all life’s nuances. Advanced obedience
lessons can wait, but you have a short window of opportunity to
ensure that she’s comfortable with the world around her.
Puppies are like developing children in many ways. Your puppy’s
neediness must be your priority, as you help to shape her impulse
control and communication skills. For now, her love and attach-
ment to you is directly reflective on your daily interactions. Do it
once and do it right.

Creating a Lifelong Bond
Everyone who gets a puppy envisions an idealized relationship — 
a lifelong bond that fulfills all the reasons the puppy was adopted in
the first place: to be a buddy for the children, a protection dog, a

Part II: Embracing Your Dog’s Identity 
108
simple companion, and so on. This fantasy isn’t unusual or even
unhealthy, but it is a fantasy. The truth of the matter is that puppies
mature gradually, and their adult behavior is directly influenced by
daily interactions and experiences. A lot of time, patience, and
understanding go into raising a puppy. The more you can learn
about your individual puppy’s needs and learning patterns, the
greater your chance for mutual respect.
Is the experience of adopting a puppy already leaving you feeling
overwhelmed and enslaved to your newest family member? It may
help to know that most people feel this way at some point. Your only
mistake may be in setting your expectations beyond your puppy’s
capacity. Organize both your schedule and your surroundings to
prevent mishaps to ensure that you can both meet your puppy’s
needs and have time for yourself, too.
An alternative is adopting an older dog, or at least one that is past
the puppy stage. The advantage is that someone else will have put
in the hard work of living through the puppy stage. The disadvan-
tage is that you don’t have the opportunity to shape your pet’s
behavior exactly as you want, from the beginning.
Initially, your attention will encourage any behavior, so use this
fact to your advantage and give your puppy every opportunity to
behave well. Puppy-proof your home, leaving appropriate toys out
to encourage good chewing habits; brace your puppy (see Chap-
ter 4) to condition four-footed greeting manners; and use treat cups
and other gadgets to motivate good behavior (see Chapter 10).
If you have a young puppy, please spend more time encouraging
her, rather than discouraging her, using the simple games and
tricks mentioned throughout this chapter.
Meeting your puppy’s needs
A puppy has the same survival needs as a young baby — and the
same dependency on others to provide for them. Each day, she
needs to eat, drink, sleep, go to the bathroom, and play. All her
needs are equal: If one is overlooked, you pay a high price. Babies
cry when they need something. For puppies, the signs that they’re
in need can include restlessness, whimpering, or even nipping.
Meeting your puppy’s needs goes a long way in the bonding process.
The person who is most consistently there to take care of a puppy’s
needs will be revered. Try to read your puppy’s signals so that you

Chapter 8: Meeting the Needs of Your Growing Puppy 109
can address her needs before they become intrusive. Good observa-
tion on your part can teach you your pup’s “native language,” and
many of those signals will persist throughout life. Once you know
them, you can understand what your pet is feeling and avoid 
problems that may arise if his needs aren’t met.
Puppies need a lot of sleep. If a puppy is overtired, she’ll display all
the signs of a colossal meltdown: random motions, wild nipping,
even snapping at the hands that hold her. If you suspect that your
puppy is reacting out of exhaustion, don’t correct her. Calmly
escort her to a quiet area, leaving her with a chew toy.
Providing early lessons
Puppies are eager to know things and are naturally conditioned to
look to a leader for direction. Though you may be unaware, you
carry a lot of weight in your puppy’s eyes: Be the leader or puppy
parent that you would hope for.
Puppies have a short attention span: Keep lessons short and
weave them into your daily interaction with them versus setting
specific times aside, especially in the early months. Choose a word
a week, such as “Sit” or “Give,” saying it to your puppy interac-
tively as discussed throughout this book.
Refer to Chapter 10 for a thorough description of positive training
tools, such as treat cups, snack packs, and clickers. These items
are equivalent to the candy and toys of our fondest childhood
memories.
The detrimental effect of discipline
Many of the most common frustrations with puppies (especially young puppies) are
created by over-disciplining. Although this mistake is quite innocent, shouting “No”
at a puppy under the age of 5 to 6 months is equivalent to yelling at a 1-year-old
baby. The very person the puppy turns to protect her and interpret her new world
has turned on her. The result is either panic, which people mistake as understand-
ing, or a defensive stance that instills confrontation, not cooperation.
Are you wondering how you can teach your puppy right from wrong? The short
answer is that a very young puppy can’t grasp these concepts: Life is simply too
new. Simply reward the behaviors that you like and ignore the others for now.

Conditioning
Conditioning is the process of pairing a behavior to a word cue, until
your puppy connects the two. For example, if you say “Get busy” as
your puppy is eliminating, eventually this phrase prompts her to
potty. Sound too good to be true? You can teach many behaviors
and lessons this way! Just catch the action that you want while it’s
in progress, attach a label to it, and then reward the pup.
You may use treats to reward your puppy’s behavior initially, but
phase off treating every time within a few weeks. Directions aren’t
really learned until they can be prompted without food.
Leash training
Even if you don’t foresee using the leash often, your puppy should
feel comfortable with it, as many situations require it (visiting the
veterinarian, vacationing, and so on). Begin conditioning early!
 Initially supervise your puppy wearing a collar and then
attach a leash and let her drag it for short, 10-minute periods.
She may play with or carry it; don’t interfere.
 When your puppy no longer reacts to the leash or collar, pick
up the leash and follow her about. Tug on it gently to intro-
duce the feeling of pressure.
 Using treats and enthusiasm, coach her to follow you. When
your puppy cooperates, say “Let’s go” and reward her.
Ringing bells and other housetraining signals
Often puppies understand the concept of going outside, but are
unclear how to signal their people’s attention at the door. As you go
to the door, say “Outside,” using the same door whenever possible.
Secure a bell at your puppy’s nose level and tap it with your finger,
or encourage a “Let me out” signal, such as barking just before
opening the door.
Stairs
Many puppies are initially afraid of going up or down the stairs due
to their physical awkwardness and a fear of the heights involved
due to depth perception. At first, carry the pup up the stairs, and
place him on the next to the last step, and encourage him up by
patting the floor on the step ahead and giving treats. The same
goes for going downstairs. Carry the pup to the next to the last
step and encourage him to complete the short journey down.
When he’s comfortable with two steps, go to three, and so on until
he’s confident walking the entire staircase — up or down!

Word association
The best way to introduce directions to your puppy is by associat-
ing them with positive games and experiences. Here are some fun
and cheerful conditioning games:
 Name game: Place several treat cups about the house or use a
positive alerting signal like clapping or a whistle. Call your
pup’s name after a short separation, kneeling down to bring
yourself to her eye level. If she stops short, run away from her
and clap your hands and repeat her name — she’ll follow out
of curiosity! If other people want to join you, offer them a treat
cup — and call your puppy from person to person.
If you repeat your puppy’s name when you want to isolate or
groom her, you may notice that she stops getting excited
when you call out to her. Stop in your tracks! Only call her by
name for positive interactions.
 Sit, please: Teach your puppy to sit whenever she wants
attention, toys, food, and so on.
Don’t demand her response — simply position her as you
direct her: Gently squeeze her waist muscles just below her
ribs as you lift up her chin.
 Proper greeting: Puppies jump up to get closer to your face.
Help your puppy learn a more acceptable greeting ritual.
Whenever you greet your puppy or are introducing her to
someone new, brace her by looping your thumb over the
bottom of her collar and holding her waist to prevent jumping
as you repeat the direction, “Say, hello.” Another option is the
reverse yo-yo, as illustrated in Figure 8-1. Leave a 4-foot leash
on your puppy and step on it before greeting your company. If
your puppy does jump, he’ll be brought down: Introduce him
when he’s calmer. (For more insights, see Chapter 13.)
 Natural come: Say your dog’s name and “Come” when you
and your puppy reunite. Place treats in your pocket or wear a
snack pack and reward your puppy when she chooses to
check in with you. As you hand her a reward, say “Come.”
Within weeks she’ll be conditioned that “Come” means you’re
close, and she, herself, will race over to close the gap.
The biggest mistake puppy people make is to teach this com-
mand when they’re standing apart from their puppy. A puppy
then learns that “Come” highlights separation, not togetherness.
Chapter 8: Meeting the Needs of Your Growing Puppy 111

Figure 8-1: Using the reverse yo-yo technique during greeting.
You may give your puppy freedom in a fully enclosed area. If you’re
playing in an open field or yard, leave a long line (see Chapter 10)
on her to supervise her wanderings.
Preventing Problems
You’ve probably seen an aggressive, hyper, or fearful dog. Though
each may look different to you, each dog is showing signs of stress
experienced in puppyhood.
Watch for signals of your puppy’s confusion or stress, such as
hyperactivity, excessive barking, jumping, or nipping. Intervention
will help your puppy mature into a well-mannered family member.
For more thorough discussions about problem behaviors and their
solutions, refer to Chapter 13.
Aggressive puppy
An assertive puppy can either develop into a protective family
member or into a dog who will use aggression to make a point. The
choice is up to you. If you think your puppy has this potential, ask
yourself:
 Does she bait you to play tug-of-war?
 Is she relentless in her demand for attention?
Part II: Embracing Your Dog’s Identity 
112

 Does she refuse to relinquish toys or food and growl or snap if
you try to take them?
 Will she grab you with her mouth to prove a point or bark
back when you correct her?
Though her earliest attempts at being the boss (in her puppy
litter) may have been successful, show her that she is not the
leader under your roof:
 Use a head halter, such as a Halti or Gentle Leader, to better
control her.
 Consider using time-outs (see Chapter 13) whenever the pup
gets uppity. Direct him by voice or collar and simply say,
“Time-out” while you place him into his kennel crate or a safe
but uninteresting room such as the bathroom.
 Teach her other manners, such as sitting when she wants a
toy or treat and lying down quietly with a bone when you’re
preoccupied.
 Only attend to your puppy when she’s respectful of you.
If your puppy threatens or snaps at anyone, seek professional
help. Although we can help control aggression (see Chapter 15),
a full-blown aggressive response that threatens injury to someone
requires instant attention and is beyond the scope of this book.
Hyper puppy
If your puppy has trouble with impulse control, you may mistak-
enly diagnose her as having an attention disorder. It’s not unheard
of for a dog to suffer from this affliction, although it’s rare. Most
hyperactivity results from inadvertent interactions given to a
smart, energetic puppy. Eager to please, these puppies interpret
any attention as positive and often note that wild behavior gets the
biggest rise from those whom they love the most. If mania works,
then mania it will be . . . in spades.
To avoid developing a manic puppy and a frustrated owner, simply
place your dog in a time-out. The duration of time-out is determined
by how long it takes him to calm down. Usually 3 to 5 minutes are all
that’s needed.
Timid puppy
Is there a more pitiful sight in the world than a frightened puppy?
Of course, the immediate human reaction is to smother this puppy
Chapter 8: Meeting the Needs of Your Growing Puppy 113

with love and affection. That, however, isn’t an effective reaction.
Puppies interpret our intention by how we look and not by what
we’re saying: A lowered posture communicates fear, direct focus is
questioning, and high-pitched tones are a clear sign of panic. To
your puppy, you look scared, too.
What a frightened puppy needs is a confident leader, so play the
part: Stand tall and act cool.
Brace your puppy by kneeling down and holding her in a sit posi-
tion or by holding her on a leash.
Whenever possible, step back from the stimulus to the point where
your puppy is comfortable and be an example of confidence.
Use the socialization steps in this chapter to expose her to all that
life has to offer, turning your “don’t-wanna-do-it” puppy into a can-
do dog.
Socializing Your Puppy
Your first priority is to socialize your pup. You’ll have plenty of time
to “train” her later, but only a small window of opportunity to famil-
iarize her with life’s nuances. If you miss out on experiences during
this impressionable period (from birth to 14 weeks of age), many
common situations and events will be unfamiliar to your puppy.
What is unknown may provoke a whole host of undesirable
responses, ranging from fear to aggression. During the socialization
process, your puppy fills her memory bank with people and places
that they successfully and safely encountered, and this will allow
her to remain stable and confident. This section explains how to
make socializing your puppy a positive experience for both of you.
Your puppy’s brain is still developing even though she’s 12 weeks
or more of age. Though she will sleep a lot, her waking hours are
spent absorbing experiences like a young child absorbs language.
It is possible to begin introducing your puppy to new experiences
as early as 4 weeks of age. After 14 weeks of age, your puppy will
be more rigid in her associations and less impressed by your exam-
ple. Use Table 8-1 to monitor your socialization program.

Chapter 8: Meeting the Needs of Your Growing Puppy 115
Developmental stages
Puppies mature a lot like children, going through similar stages of development that
are prompted by both self-awareness and hormonal release. Though certain stages
can drag on, they won’t last forever, and believe it or not, some day these puppyhood
gripes will be a distant memory.
Infant (8–12 weeks): Also known as the angelic stage, most puppies sleep a lot and
are relatively calm and observant when interacting. Though you can “train” your
puppy at this age, her reactions are less learned than quick responses to get your
attention. This phase is the ideal time to get your puppy to focus on lifelong routines,
such as where to potty, what to chew, and where her resting areas are in each room.
Terrible Twos (13–18 weeks): This stage heralds an immediate fall from grace as
your puppy develops a growing awareness of both herself and the world around
her. Though your puppy may seem sassy and defiant, don’t give up on her just yet:
These are all signs of normal development and are often her way of dealing with
her own emotional stress.
Learn creative ways to direct her impulsivity and then let time and maturity take its
course. Focus on play training and basic manners like sitting for rewards and alert-
ing to her name. Lastly, don’t set yourself up for disappointment: Keep your home
puppy-proofed and her schedule consistent.
Budding adolescent (4 1/2 months–8 months): For some puppies, this stage is the
most trying. Old puppyhood problems re-emerge with a new twist: control. This
stage is when your puppy is determining her place in your household: Does she
watch you or direct you?
Now is the time to introduce the concept of “No” (see Chapters 3 and 12) and struc-
tured lesson time. All directions should be reinforced throughout the day so that
your budding adolescent can learn that your directions aren’t debatable.
Puberty (8 months–11 months): Puberty is a nightmare for any species. Remember
that your puppy is on an endless hormonal rollercoaster. You’ll have to endure this
time. If you lose your patience, it will set you back, as your puppy is looking to you
for a steady reaction. Repetitive lessons, a well-organized exercise plan, and con-
tainment around heavy distractions (for example, fenced area or leash) are musts.
Young adult (11 months–18 months): If you’ve kept up with your puppy’s lessons,
you’ll clearly note that the end is in sight. Some days your puppy behaves like a well-
mannered dog. Your role now is to follow through when your puppy ignores you,
position her if she chooses to go her own way, bring her into unfamiliar environ-
ments often to highlight your worldliness and leadership skills, and stay on top of her
lessons.

Creating a positive association
Take a cheerful attitude along when you’re socializing your puppy,
as your example will help her feel comfortable in the world around
her. Use treats, toys, and patience — whatever it takes to keep
your puppy’s attention centered on you, as many new distractions
can be frightening at first. Routine exposure will calm her reaction,
and the time will be well spent: Your puppy will develop confi-
dence in your worldliness and direction. Keep these things in mind
as you socialize her:
 Use the right leash and collar. When you’re out and about, con-
dition your puppy to the direction “Let’s go.” Find an effective
collar (for rambunctious puppies consider a head collar, such as
a Halti or Gentle Leader) or a no-pull harness (see Chapter 10),
as they guide your puppy without putting undo strain on her
developing neck or back, and use a 4- to 6-foot leash.
Avoid using long retractable leashes when socializing your
puppy. This long lead gives your puppy far too much slack
and endangers her safety near roadways. Such leashes are,
however, useful when exercising your puppy in a field or on a
beach instead.
 Focus on their curiosity. Most puppies stop in their tracks
from time to time, refusing to move or freaking out when pre-
sented with a new situation. If you focus on your puppy at this
time, you’ll cement her fear. Instead, relax your body and look
Chapter 8: Meeting the Needs of Your Growing Puppy 117

inquisitive by approaching the person/object when possible.
Focus your attention on your puppy only when she warms to
a situation, even if it takes several exposures.
 Try coaxing gadgets. Using favorite treats and toys while you
socialize your puppy is a given, but you may want to consider
other gadgets, such as treat cups, clickers, and targeting
wands (see Chapter 10). You can use these associations to
lure your puppy closer to a distraction that makes her wary
and to reward her when she exhibits confidence.
 Repeat exposures. Some puppies are hard headed: If they
don’t like something, they stand firm. These pups need
repeated exposures and positive modeling before they’ll relax
their guard. Consider a street grate, for example. The image
confuses their depth perception and arrests the motions of
even the most confident puppy. If your puppy refuses to go
near one, don’t avoid it. Create a can-do puppy by seeking out
a grate each day and sitting by or on it as you lure your puppy
closer with treats. Repeated exposure will do the trick —
soon, your puppy will “catch your confidence” and approach
with curiosity, not fear.
Does the thought of spending time socializing your puppy away
from home seem like too much bother to you? If you’re fortunate
enough to live within a private enclosure, and you don’t take the
time to expose your puppy to other places, objects, and people,
she may run the risk of territorial aggression or outside world pho-
bias (growing wary of anything not found at her home base). If you
ever want your dog to meet people and go to other places, you
must do it or else spend the rest of the dog’s life dealing with fears
and aggression.
Exploring places
Dogs are more home loving than people are and are truly content
to spend all of their lives in the same locale. Though your dog may
be content to never stray beyond the boundaries of your home,
neighborhood, and surrounding area, for her to do so is unrealistic.
You’re certain to take your dog out if only to the veterinarian or to
the kennel during your holiday, although most people enjoy social-
izing with their dog elsewhere, too.
The surest way to guarantee your puppy’s easy transition from one
environment to another is by taking her with you often. If you live
in the country, go to the city. If you’re an urban dweller, go find
some clean fresh air. Take your puppy to town, beaches, and in any
Part II: Embracing Your Dog’s Identity 
118

dog-friendly building or store. Use the following directions to lead
her about, always playing the role of the social director. (Go to
Chapter 3 for more instruction on how to teach your puppy these
directions.)
 “Follow” or “Let’s go”: This direction says, “I’m the leader,
protector, and guardian — follow me!” When your puppy is
walking behind you or standing behind you, she’ll feel safe
and protected.
 “Wait” and “Okay”: Use this duo at all curbs, stairs, car
doors, and thresholds, telling your puppy to stop at your side
and look up to you before proceeding. These directions also
communicate your reliability, saying, “Let me look ahead to
make sure that we’re safe.”
 “Sit”: When you’re around distractions, your living-room
champion may suddenly forget basic directions like “Sit.”
Don’t despair — she’s just distracted. Position your puppy,
teaching her to focus on your directions.
 “Stay”: This direction instructs your puppy to be still. If she’s
unable to cooperate (for example, during a greeting), either
brace her or stand on the leash. If you’re relaxing or eating,
encourage stillness by sitting on the leash.
 “Under”: Say this direction when you’re sitting on a chair or
bench, luring your puppy underneath your feet or the table
leg with a toy or treat. This covered space helps your puppy
feel protected and safe, and she will, in turn, be calmer.
 “Back”: If your puppy pulls to walk in front of you, say, “Back”
as you direct her behind you. If this direction proves too diffi-
cult to master, review the proper handling of the leash and
your collar choice (see Chapter 10). Make the appropriate
changes.
Use these foundation words for all your socializing experiences.
Familiar words instill focus and trust.
Meeting other people
Whether you desire a friendly dog or hope that your puppy devel-
ops protection skills, socialization is critically important. A well-
socialized dog has a broad horizon, having met all sorts of people,
and isn’t easily derailed by new experiences. This dog has learned
to trust her people’s responses and can easily identify those per-
sons who have bad intentions.
Chapter 8: Meeting the Needs of Your Growing Puppy 119

If your puppy hasn’t met children by the time she’s a few months
old, you’ll notice her alarming reaction when she’s confronted by
them. Children smell different and look and move differently, too.
Though each dog’s response is unique, many will act defensively
or aggressively or exhibit active fear of children. Once they’ve
passed the impressionable stage (up to 14 weeks old), you’ll have
far less ability to positively influence their behavior.
Exposing to sounds
Your puppy is more acutely aware of sounds than you can imagine.
We encourage you to expose your puppy to many different sounds.
If a certain sound startles your puppy, kneel down and brace her by
holding her chest and back. Repeat “Stay” in a calm voice if she’s
familiar with the direction; if your puppy is unable to relax, step
back a comfortable distance, outside of her red zone — the dis-
tance away from the object at which she feels comfortable (see
Figure 8-2). If possible, modify the sound or mute it and engage your
dog in welcomed activities, such as treat-based lessons and games.
Most puppies are startled when experiencing their first thunder-
storm. Your initial reaction to your puppy’s fear is critically impor-
tant. If you coddle her, she’ll grow fearful, as your posture and tone
conveys the equivalent of fear and confusion. A better approach is
to act completely unbothered, standing tall and moving about as if
nothing were going on. If your puppy doesn’t adopt your attitude,
move into a small room, read, or chat on the phone. Above all else,
stay calm. When she’s less stressed, praise, play, and reward her to
encourage more outward focus than inward fear.
Part II: Embracing Your Dog’s Identity 
120
Surfaces
Imagine life without shoes. Your dog walks on bare paws every day: New and unfa-
miliar surfaces will always give her reason to pause. Expose your puppy to as many
surfaces as possible.
If your puppy acts confused or startled when you walk onto a new surface, don’t
drag her across it. Stop and sit a short distance from her and urge her to you with
treats or a toy. When she gets to you, reward her for a few seconds, then place her
back on the floor, and move a few feet away. Repeat the process several days in a
row — spreading treats on the floor to override her trepidation.

Figure 8-2: Recognizing your dog’s red zone.
Introduce your puppy to as many indoor and outdoor sounds as
possible. A vacuum cleaner can be as alarming as a siren if your
puppy is unfamiliar with it. Use treats to measure her comfort
zone: If she doesn’t take them, she’s in panic mode, so move back.
Introducing objects
The gift of socializing your puppy is the mutual benefit of being
familiar with and relaxed around all life has to offer. Always remem-
ber that your puppy sees new objects differently than you do. For
her to feel comfortable with anything, she must sniff it; her nose
works like your eyes. For example, if you see a leaf bag blowing in
the wind, you can interpret the sight from afar. Your puppy, on the
other hand, can’t. If it’s a first encounter, he may act startled or
even defensive until he’s willing to come close enough to sniff it.
The goal in early socialization is to build up your puppy’s bank of
experiences so that throughout her life, she’ll be less surprised by
the variety of things that life will throw at her. Refer to Table 8-2 or
Chapter 8: Meeting the Needs of Your Growing Puppy 121

create your own list of objects that you’re likely to come across in
your daily adventures. Introduce your puppy to these objects one
at a time, always keeping in mind the following:
 If your puppy is startled, discover her red zone.
 Give her direction and treats at this distance. If she’s still
unable to focus on you or the food, back away until she can.
 When you’re able, investigate the object yourself. Kneel down
and pretend to sniff it — your puppy will trust in your bravery.
 As your puppy gets more familiar with the object, walk by it
swiftly saying, “Let’s go.” Look straight ahead — your puppy
will focus on your confidence.
Avoid the temptation to soothe your puppy if she’s fearful. She’ll
interpret your soothing as submissive fear or confusion; instead of
soothing her, it will underscore her concern.
Meeting other animals
No one wants a dog who’s either afraid of other animals or danger-
ously aggressive with them. To an undersocialized dog, however,
the “unfamiliar” is always a potential danger, which can prompt a
host of unpredictable behaviors.
Ask friends, neighbors, and other family members to bring over a
variety of pets to meet and handle your puppy while still on a leash
to allow you full control. Stay calm, modeling behavior that you
want your puppy to emulate.
If you can visit a farm or walk along a horse path or fence, do so.
The more animals your puppy sees during this socialization time,
the less they will worry him throughout your lives together.

Reading and Communicating
as Your Dog Ages
In This Chapter
 Knowing how old your dog really is
 Checking for and adapting to age-related changes in hearing and vision
 Coping with the effects of aging on a dog’s mind
A
s your dog ages, he’ll adapt and change because of his own
life experience. However, as time takes its toll, he’ll process
this information less efficiently. In this chapter, we lead you
through your dog’s aging process, helping you gain insight into
age-related changes in your dog’s mind and behavior. Simple
awareness can instill empathy leading you to modify your environ-
ment and communicate in a manner befitting the dignity of an
older dog.
Discovering Your Dog’s True Age
The rate at which a dog ages depends a lot upon his size. Large
dogs age more slowly when they’re young and take longer to lose
their impish ways and achieve sexual and social maturity.
However, by the time they’re around 3 years old, they’ve caught up
with smaller breeds, and from then on, they age significantly faster.
It’s this pattern of aging that ultimately results in smaller dogs
having a much longer life span than larger dogs. At the behavioral
level, this faster aging process also means that large dogs will start
to act like senior citizens much earlier.
Table 9-1 combines results from a number of different studies to
allow you to convert your dog’s actual age to its human equivalent
in years. To find your dog’s equivalent age in human years, simply
find its actual age and then check under the column corresponding
to its weight in pounds.

The old-fashioned folksy way of estimating a dog’s age, suggesting
that every 1 year of a dog’s life is equivalent to 7 years of a human
life, was really just a rough guess based on the fact that the aver-
age life span of a dog was estimated at that time to be around 10
years and the average life span of a human was around 70 years.

Other factors seem to affect aging, too. The shape of a dog’s face is
one such example: Dogs with sharp, pointed faces that look like
wolves generally have longer lives and seem to age more slowly.
Dogs with very flat faces, such as bulldogs and pugs, often have
shorter lives and age more quickly. Of course, a dog who is well
cared for can often live much longer than average for its size,
shape, and breed.
Part II: Embracing Your Dog’s Identity 
124

Not only can your dog’s age predict her life span, it can do the
same for her behavior as well. The numbers in Table 9-1 give you
an estimate of the mental age of a dog in human years, allowing
you to judge how a dog may behave in certain situations or under
particular stress.
Human thought processes slow down sharply at around 55 years of
age. The giant breeds, such as the Saint Bernard, start showing the
kinds of thought patterns, problem-solving changes, and learning
problems that we associate with humans who are that age when
the dog is somewhere between 5 and 7 years of age. Other big dogs
(not quite as large as the giant breeds), such as the Alaskan
Malamute, start thinking like seniors between 6 and 8 years of age.
The medium breeds, such as the Cocker Spaniel, won’t start acting
like seniors until 7 to 9 years of age, while the smaller breeds, such
as a Yorkshire Terrier, won’t act like seniors until they’re 9 to 11
years of age.
Of course, there can be a wide variety in the abilities and behav-
iors of dogs the same age, even within a single breed. Certain indi-
vidual dogs seem to age more rapidly, while others go many years
past when we may expect. Like people who remain active and
engaged, dogs who use their brain and mind seem more vital as
they progress into their golden years.
Battling an Aging Body
Dogs and humans age similarly both psychologically and physi-
cally, though with dogs, the process is accelerated. As the body
matures, it stiffens and grows progressively weaker. Aging dogs
move less quickly and are less agile as the process of growing
older limits their flexibility and coordination. No less loving, an
older dog grows more dependent on the care and affection of his
family to stay connected to life.
When Stan’s old dog Wizard lost his ability to jump up onto the
bed where he had slept next to his master all of his life, Stan
simply built a set of carpeted stairs that he placed next to the
bottom of the bed. This adjustment allowed Wizard to hobble up
and rest next to his companion’s feet as he’d always done.
Older dogs are more prone to diseases and other conditions
related to their overall decline. Because any discomfort will result
in changes in behavior, it becomes increasingly critical for older
dogs’ guardians to nurture their existence. Detecting distress in an
older dog isn’t always easy, as he doesn’t show the same symp-
toms that humans do.
Chapter 9: Reading and Communicating as Your Dog Ages 125

As a species, dogs generally have a higher tolerance for discomfort
than people do, leading many people to falsely assume that their
dog is fine when he’s not. Although people are quick to communi-
cate the slightest distress, encouraging social support and medical
help, dogs are more likely to adopt behaviors that hide their pain
from plain view.
In essence, your dog hides his pain to appear to be more in control
of the situation, thus making it difficult for you to recognize when
your dog is hurting.
Many observable physical cues indicate pain. Though an obvious
yelp or whimper would seem the first signal, if your dog is crying
out, then the pain has reached a level of intensity that has broken
through his protective barriers and his normal reserve. This is a
dog that is hurting so badly that he doesn’t care who knows it. In
most cases, however, the signs are less obvious:
 Excessive panting and rapid breathing occur, even when the
dog is at rest and not heat-stressed.
 The dog may shiver or tremble.
 Sometimes, the dog may appear to be extremely restless and
change positions frequently while lying down or sitting. At the
other extreme, he may appear extremely reluctant to change
body positions.
 The dog may pull away when being touched, may appear to
be guarding one part of his body, and may even show unchar-
acteristic aggression, growling or threatening when touched
or even approached.
 Licking or chewing at painful areas is also common.
 You may see body cues, such as twitching, limping, or a frozen
appearance.
 Dogs in pain often lose their appetite.
More subtle signs include rapid heart rate, dilated pupils, and a
rise in body temperature.
If your dog is showing any of these signs, see your veterinarian
immediately.

Diminishing Awareness
The effects of age are much the same on dogs and humans: joints
wear out, systems break down from overuse, and faculties lose their
functionality over time. Though the affects of time are universal,
diminished sight and hearing can have a major effect on the human-
animal bond. Fortunately, you can easily modify your environment
and communication style to prevent this possible source of stress
and ensure that he lives out his golden years happily.
One simple method is to always train your dog using both hand
signals and voice commands at the same time. That way if age
weakens his hearing he can still respond to your signals, and if his
sight dims he can still respond to your voice.
When hearing fades
Hearing loss is commonly a result of physical wear and tear. In the
inner ear (the cochlea), tiny hairlike cells bend to register the
arrival of sounds. Unfortunately, this repeated bending and flexing
over the years of a dog’s life can cause a weakness in the material
and the hair can break, just like a wire coat hanger that has been
bent in the same place many times. Once these hairs are damaged,
they don’t grow back, so for each hair cell that is damaged, the dog
loses a bit of his hearing ability.
Of course, age isn’t the only reason why the hair cells that register
sounds break. Hair cell damage is often the result of exposure to loud
sounds and is more common in dogs who have been exposed to gun-
shot noises in hunting or who have lived in cities and been exposed
to high levels of urban noise. In addition, chemicals can play a role,
particularly exposure to various common solvents (cleaning fluids,
paint thinners, and plastic solvents), which can accelerate damage
to the cells in the ear. A lifetime of minor stresses explains why
most dogs in the 12- to 15-year-old range show some evidence of
hearing loss.
Knowing the signs of hearing loss
Simple observation of your aging dog can usually tell you whether
his hearing is failing:
 Your dog seems to ignore your calls, especially when out of
sight or distracted.
 Your dog sleeps more soundly than he used to, instead of bolt-
ing awake at a loud noise.
Chapter 9: Reading and Communicating as Your Dog Ages 127

 Your dog awakens with a growl or a snap if touched while
sleeping.
 Outdoors, your dog may appear to be oblivious to the sound
of approaching cars.
 Personality changes may occur, such as the dog appearing to
be more fearful, dependent, lethargic, edgy, or snappish.
Living with a hearing-impaired dog
Your dog’s world will change drastically as his hearing fades,
although you can take some relatively simple steps to ease this
transition:
 Most dogs rely on hearing to locate family members, so a
hearing loss often leads to a sense of isolation, which can give
a formerly confident dog bouts of separation anxiety and per-
haps even bring on episodes of panic.
For an easy solution, wear perfumed body lotion, scented per-
fume, or aftershave. Because your dog’s sense of smell is his
most robust sensory system and suffers least from the aging
process, the scent you wear makes you a lot easier to track
down. Furthermore, because scents tend to persist in the air
and cling to surfaces, your dog will recognize that you’ve been
nearby recently, and feeling your presence in the vicinity will
comfort him even if he can’t hear you.
 To wake a deaf dog without startling him, use your dog’s
sense of smell to avoid startling him from a sleep. When you
approach your sleeping dog, hold your hand near his nose for
a few seconds. Your scent will penetrate his sleeping brain,
and he’ll awaken when he recognizes your scent. Reach out to
pet him only after he has roused naturally.
You can get a deaf dog’s attention in several ways, although shout-
ing at increasing decibels is not one of them:
 Thump on the floor with your foot or slap a wall or some solid
furniture, which causes vibrations that the dog can sense.
 Wave your arms vigorously, because dogs’ eyes are sensitive
to movement.
 Wear a small flashlight or a laser pointer on a lanyard around
your neck. A bright moving light quickly causes the dog to
turn to you.
 If your dog is outside (enclosed) at night and you want to call
him in, turning your porch light off and on serves as a good
signal.
Part II: Embracing Your Dog’s Identity 
128

 Obviously, if you’re close to your dog, you can always touch
him. However, it’s important to always touch him in the same
place so that he recognizes that it is a signal and not a poten-
tial threat. The shoulder or top of the head are ideal.
Always leash a hearing-impaired dog when walking him in an unen-
closed area, such as the park. In these areas, a long or retractable
leash is ideal because it still allows the dog to run and play but
gives his owner control over him. Buy a dog tag that states, “Help
me home. I’m deaf,” and includes an updated phone number,
should he mistakenly get loose.
Chapter 9: Reading and Communicating as Your Dog Ages 129
Other sources of hearing loss
In some cases, what appears to be age-related hearing loss may actually be due to
other factors that can be remedied. The dog’s ear canal is much longer than that of
humans, and it takes a right angle turn as it reaches the eardrum. This shape, unfor-
tunately, is ideal for collection of debris. Wax, dirt, and hair build up in the canal and
create a plug that keeps the sound from reaching the eardrum. This same debris
can also attract ear mites, which in turn can cause ear infections (called otitis). All
these factors can result in swelling and fluid accumulation that can effectively block
much of the sound from reaching the middle ear.
Dogs that spend a lot of time in the water (especially pond or lake water that may
not be clean) are most susceptible to these problems. Furthermore, those long
floppy ears that look so appealing on dogs like hounds and spaniels also tend to
trap moisture and limit air circulation, which can turn the ear into a good breeding
ground for infections.
As in most cases, visible signs and symptoms usually suggest a problem with a dog’s
ears:
 The dog frequently shakes its head or scratches its ears.
 Touching the dog’s ears causes him to pull away or whimper.
 You can smell a putrid ear odor when you sniff.
 The dog walks with her head uncomfortably cocked to the side.
Lift the flap of the dog’s ear or check closely on a dog with pricked ears. You’re look-
ing for normal ears that are pink with a small amount of amber wax. (The wax actu-
ally helps to protect the ear canal.) Warning signs include any discharge, blood
blisters, excess reddening, or crumbly material.
These symptoms should prompt a call to your dog’s veterinarian. It is often the case
that a good ear cleaning and perhaps a course of antibiotics may well clear up hear-
ing difficulties.

Put a bell on your dog. Though the bell is useless to a deaf dog, it
allows you to hear your dog when he’s on the move. This sound
allows you to find him more easily because he clearly can’t hear
you when you call.
When vision fades
Vision often fails in older dogs, although for more varied reasons
than the mechanical wear and tear most common in hearing loss:
 Chemical changes: As a dog ages, changes occur in the pro-
teins that make up the lens of his eye. These chemical modifi-
cations create inflexibility that limits the eyes’ focusing ability.
Even under the best of conditions, a dog’s vision for near
details is poor, but when the composition of the lens protein
shifts, he becomes even more farsighted. Though some focus-
ing ability may remain, it may take more time for the dog to
recognize objects and people.
 Aperture dysfunction: Another visual impairment occurs
when the pupil of the eye (through which light passes) loses
its ability to open and close efficiently. The inability to adjust
the size of the pupil in relation to given light conditions
degrades the quality of the visual image.
 Nuclear sclerosis: For most owners, the most visible change in
the dog’s eye is a haziness that appears on the lens of an older
dog’s eyes, called nuclear sclerosis. On the bright side, this con-
dition doesn’t affect sight much, unless this cloudiness becomes
dense (when it appears to be almost white). An inexperienced
viewer may mistake this cloudiness for the condition known as
cataracts.
Part II: Embracing Your Dog’s Identity 
130
Why deaf dogs bark so much
A common problem with deaf dogs is excessive barking. While they obviously can’t
hear their own barks well, they still recognize the sensation barking creates and a
human’s reaction to their behavior. If their barking is effective in attracting atten-
tion, they’ll continue to bark, and often bark louder in an attempt to hear themselves
as they once could. Though the root cause of hearing-loss barking is often a feel-
ing of confusion or social isolation, a human comforting the deaf dog that is bark-
ing noisily actually makes him more anxious about his predicament.
A much more effective strategy is to put the dog in a small room or his kennel until
the barking stops. Wait for a pause in the barking of 30 seconds or more and then
let him out and reward his now quiet behavior.

Cataracts are the single leading cause of blindness in older
dogs; please seek a professional’s opinion if you suspect your
dog is suffering. You do have medical options.
 Cataracts: A cataract in a dog’s eye results when cells within
the lens of his eye become dark and opaque over time.
Cataracts are often the result of events occurring in the dog’s
life. They can be the result of diabetes, nutritional deficiencies,
exposure to certain toxins, or injuries to the eye. In addition,
simple exposure to the ultraviolet light in bright sunshine can
trigger cataracts. Hereditary factors are also involved, and sev-
eral dog breeds, such as Cocker Spaniels, Poodles, and Lhasa
Apsos, have a predisposition toward cataracts.
Veterinary science has recently developed effective surgical
treatments and can implant a prosthetic device similar to the
one used to restore human vision. These treatments are effec-
tive, though costly.
 Glaucoma: The second major condition that causes blindness
in dogs is glaucoma. It is caused by an increase in fluid pres-
sure, which then damages the neural tissues in the eye that are
responsible for registering light. Normally, fluid is drained
away at the same rate it enters the eye, but in glaucoma, the
outlet for the fluid is narrowed or closed. Aging dogs with high
blood pressure are most susceptible to this condition.
If the glaucoma is detected early, drugs and surgery can often
hold off any loss of vision for quite a while, although the long-
term success is disappointingly low. In glaucoma, as in
cataracts, heredity is also a factor. Some dog breeds, including
Cocker Spaniels, Siberian Huskies, Basset Hounds, and Beagles,
appear to be especially susceptible to these problems.
Detecting failing vision
People often mistakenly think that their dog’s loss of vision was a
sudden occurrence. However, most dogs lose their sight gradually.
Though some people don’t recognize their dog’s failing sense until
it’s virtually too late to affect change, you can often detect several
signs that signal a loss of vision as your dog ages:
 Loss of interest in or the ability to retrieve or chase balls
 More cautious when climbing steps
 Hesitancy when jumping onto or off of furniture
 Going up or down curbs is accompanied by a cautious or
high-stepping gait
 The dog may stop running and resort to walking nearly every-
where
Chapter 9: Reading and Communicating as Your Dog Ages 131

 Personality changes, including increased fearfulness,
increased dependency on the owner, increased lethargy,
decreased playfulness, and sometimes more snappish or
aggressive behavior
If you notice any changes in your dog’s behavior or visual aware-
ness, please make an appointment to see his veterinarian. Many
treatable conditions affect vision.
Living with a blind dog
Blind dogs can live comfortably. Some take quite a while to even
recognize the full limitations of their handicap, since sight usually
diminishes progressively and isn’t a dog’s primary sense.
To help your blind dog live happily, take these steps to provide a
new map of her living space. You will become like Annie to Helen
Keller:
 Attach short directional word or phrases to daily routines.
Verbal cues reassure your dog and help him feel connected to
your daily interactions. Your voice will both guide and reas-
sure him (see Chapters 3 and 12).
 Create landmarks for your dog, keeping daily objects, such as
dog bowls and bedding, in the same place. In addition, avoid
relocating furniture, TVs, or radios to prevent any disorienta-
tion that may result when the dog’s mental map is disrupted.
 Use carpet runners to create a “road” to familiar rooms.
 Use different scents to map out locations or forbidden areas.
For example, you can use scented oils or powders to cue your
dog to avoid ledges or locate important places in a room.
When you travel, these same scents can comfort and guide
him in an otherwise unknown environment.
 If your dog is distressed at not being able to find you, wear a
familiar scent or clip a small bell to your wrist or belt loop.
 Return objects to where they belong. Things that are left out
are opportunities for collisions that may disorient your dog
and lead to anxiety or fearfulness.
 If your dog is an outdoor pet, don’t plan major landscape 
projects.
 If your dog is disoriented, lead him to a favorite anchoring spot,
such as a familiar bed, and pet him calmly until he’s settled
down.
Part II: Embracing Your Dog’s Identity 
132

 Going up and down stairs is difficult for blind dogs. Install car-
peting and chaperone your dog until he feels confident: Hold
his midsection gently as you support his weight and/or lead
him up each step by luring him with a favorite treat (see
Chapter 12).
The most important tool in dealing with a blind dog is the leash.
Think of the leash as giving you the ability to hold your dog’s hand.
Your dog will feel more secure because he knows where you are.
Leashing the dog can be helpful even in the house until he gets
adjusted. The dog should certainly be walked on the leash because
his owner is now his eyes.
Feeling socially isolated is a problem with blind dogs just as it is
with deaf dogs. Most dogs seem reassured if they know where their
owners are. A dog that has been free to roam the house may have
to be confined at night. Securing your dog next to your bed at night
or using a crate is an ideal solution.
Once the dog gets used to the routine and has a mental map of his
world, he’ll do fine. Many dogs happily go around their homes and
live a happy life despite their blindness. In fact, many do it so well
that visitors don’t even notice that the dog is blind.
Remembering the Aging Mind
Your dog’s personality and behavior will change as she grows
older, and although some dogs may lose the zest for life, it’s not a
necessary or even normal part of dogs growing older.
In today’s society, where dogs are nurtured as never before,
they’re, living longer. Better nutrition and medical services ensure
that dogs are often making it well into their senior years, and
because of that we’re seeing more of the degenerative conditions
equated with aging, including arthritis, heart disease, cancer, dia-
betes, and even dementia.
Alzheimer’s disease in dogs?
A medical condition known as Canine Cognitive Dysfunction (CCD)
causes the same kind of disorientation, physiological brain alter-
ation, confusion, memory loss, and personality changes that
humans face with Alzheimer’s disease. CCD is sometimes referred
to as old dog syndrome, brain aging, doggie dementia, or senility.
Chapter 9: Reading and Communicating as Your Dog Ages 133

The symptoms of this age-related mental problem are usually quite
clear to a dog owner. The dog
 Stops responding to his name or other known directions
 Stares blankly into space or at walls
 May repeat behaviors, such as dragging a toy from room to
room, or pacing or wandering aimlessly but using the same
route or pattern around tables and chairs
 May get stuck in corners, or around furniture, needing assis-
tance to get out
 May sometimes appear lost or confused, even in familiar sur-
roundings, or when put out to relieve himself may seem to
forget why he was there
 May experience changes in social behavior, such as no longer
trying to get attention, no longer caring about being petted, or
walking away when receiving affection
 May have changes in sleep patterns, including sleeping more
during the day and wandering around at night instead of
sleeping
 May sometimes forget his housetraining, even to the point of
having accidents indoors immediately after coming inside
 May be easily agitated and begin vigorously barking for no
apparent reason
Seldom does a dog show all these symptoms, but any dog that
shows two or more of them may well be developing CCD.
Solutions for a fading mind
Several behavioral interventions can keep mental decline at bay
even as your dog ages.
 Pattern training and repetition is reassuring to an older dog.
Once a dog has established a regular routine, he’ll hold to that
pattern through his older years. Familiar directions encourage
your dog’s participation in daily activities and give him security
and comfort.
Old dogs can still learn, and they love the attention and the
opportunity to please you and earn rewards. Though it may
take more time and patience, recent research shows that
older dogs are eager to learn new routines.
Part II: Embracing Your Dog’s Identity 
134

Older dogs have a hard time unlearning learned behavior pat-
terns, such as jumping on guests or not barking at strange
noises. Those lessons are better addressed while the mind is
still impressionable.
 Perhaps the most exciting work about the aging mind is the
finding that our day-to-day experiences affect the very struc-
ture of our brains and may allow us to counteract the effects
of age on our brains. Researchers at the University of Toronto
studied a group of aging Beagles in order to see how changing
the day-to-day experiences of older dogs would affect their
minds. Provided with a cognitive enrichment program, the dogs
were challenged with learning tasks and puzzles, such as find-
ing hidden food rewards, five to six days a week.
This stimulation went on for a year, at which point each dog
was tested for mental awareness and new skill learning capac-
ities. The dogs in this group universally showed better per-
formance in learning and problem solving tasks than did their
littermates who had not had these additional experiences.
Dealing with your dog at home is simple. From the earliest days of
living with your dog, you should stimulate him by giving him things
to learn, problems to solve, and new experiences. However, when
your dog grows older, you should make an effort to increase,
rather than decrease, your dog’s activities:
 Provide mental stimulation in as many ways as you can.
 Play with your dog.
 Go for short walks, especially in new places.
 Talk to your dog.
 Pet your dog and socially interact with her.
 Try to teach your dog something new each week.
If you’re willing to put up with a bit of controlled destruction,
create problems to solve by putting kibbles or treats inside an old
towel, rag, or crumpled plastic jug and allow the dog to tear the
item apart to get to the food inside. The cardboard rolls that toilet
paper and paper towels come on are great for this activity. Put
some kibble in them, crumple the ends, and let the old dog tear
apart the “toy” to get to the food.
Turning your dog’s meals into searches can also be useful. Divide
the dog’s meal into small portions, each in a plastic container, and
hide them around the house to keep your dog actively searching
for a while. If you can put up with the potential mess, simply toss
some nonmessy bits of food around a room or yard and encourage
the dog to find them.

here is so much more to training dogs these days, 
and you may need more than a standard chain and a
six-foot leash! If your goal is to have a dog who not only
listens to you, but enthusiastically chooses to respond to
your directions rather than to his natural impulses, this
part points the way. You can use many tools, techniques,
and tricks to shape your dog’s learning experience. Born
with an innate desire to please those he respects, your
dog will focus on your direction if your lessons are inspira-

f you’ve ever ogled over a seemingly perfectly trained or well-
mannered dog, the first thing to know is that the dog’s behavior
wasn’t developed overnight. Happy, sociable, well-mannered dogs
aren’t born that way — their demeanor reflects patient, consistent
training techniques. The good news is that this process is within
your reach and can be a lot of fun. With the right approach, atti-
tude, and training tools, raising a puppy or training an adult dog
can be a fascinating learning experience.
In this chapter, we introduce you to training tools and techniques
that put a positive spin on everything from potty training to obedi-
ence lessons so that your dog will not just learn, but learn joyfully.
(For actual commands and training exercises, see Chapter 12.)
If a dog impresses you and the handler seems approachable, com-
pliment them and ask how they ended up with such a lovely com-
panion. Dog lovers cherish their bragging rights; if they live in your
area, you might discover a good school, technique, or trainer to
help you.

Choosing Training Tools 
and Gadgets
When we began our careers, you didn’t see much variety in training
tools beyond a metal chain collar and 6-foot leash. Nowadays, shop-
ping for your dog is as much fun as taking a child to the candy store.
The toys are colorful, noisy, and creative. In the collar and leash sec-
tion, lengths, style, and colors abound. Most excitedly, training sec-
tions contain gadgets, devices, and equipment to aid everyone and
any dog, regardless of age, personality, or learning capacity.
The joy of new-age training tools and gadgets is that many of them
assist your dog’s learning ability, thus considerably shortening the
time it takes your dog to learn a new behavior. It may take weeks
for a puppy to associate sitting with your repeated direction,
although it will take only minutes to associate a clicker sound with
a tasty reward (see Figure 10-1).
Figure 10-1: Use the clicker to highlight moments when your dog is relating to
you. Always follow the sound of a click with a food reward.

Collars
Different pieces of training equipment affect your dog’s learning
and can shape how she relates to and associates with your direc-
tion. For example, a proper teaching collar is meant to condition
cooperative behavior or to discourage incorrect responses. Table

personality, size, and temperament.

Retractable leads can cause incidents when used near roadways or
in crowded situations. Less controllable than a standard leash, a
retractable lead can malfunction, leaving the handler out of control.
If your dog chews through cloth or leather leashes, you can use a
chain leash to eliminate the habit. Once your dog is unsuccessful
in chewing through the chain, her determination to chew any
restraint should be cured. However, chain leashes are heavy and
can cut your hands if you’re trying to restrain a very active dog
with one.

dog is a much more cooperative and cheerful companion.

Who is leading whom?
The average daily walk is an excellent example of how things get misunderstood
between our species. When an uneducated dog pulls a person by her leash, the
person often mistakenly assumes that the dog is stupid; otherwise, she wouldn’t
choke herself.
The dog (rarely dumb) is learning a very different lesson, however: that being near
their person is asphyxiating. The more she pulls to get away, the greater the restraint
and the more determined she is to break free. If this dog should escape, she’ll have
little to no incentive to return. Use this chapter to discover an effective training collar
and Chapter 3 or 12 to discover more appropriate techniques to teach your dog to
follow your lead.

Clicker-happy training
The clicker is a small handheld device that, when depressed, issues
a sharp clicking sound much like a louder version of the sound of a
shutter camera. When this sound is paired with a food reward, an
association occurs, causing the sound itself to become rewarding.
When highlighting desired behaviors, the clicker speeds up your
dog’s learning and amplifies her enthusiasm for the training
process.
Why is the clicker such an effective training tool? The sound is
sharp and distinct — different from any other sound heard during
a normal day and meant just to signal a reward. Purposely tied to a
treat, this sharp sound highlights what is to come when it’s per-
fectly timed to reinforce a specific behavior. Once your dog learns
the behavior, she’ll achieve what every dog dreams of: the power
to control you. But this time, she’ll be controlling you with perfect,
praiseworthy routines.
Clicker training is most effective for those dogs who are food moti-
vated and for people who are organized enough to apply the tech-
nique either throughout the day, on an outing, or during organized
lesson times. Though the ideal is to use the click-treat association
all day every day while conditioning learned associations, few
people have that presence of mind. Still, the clicker is an effective
tool, even if used with only periodic regularity.
You can use the clicker to shape every behavior from simple direc-
tions, such as “Sit” and “Wait,” to complex routines like housetrain-
ing and tricks. When using the clicker, pair each individual click
with a food reward, timing each click to the moment your dog hits
a position or finishes a sequence or behavior. Table 10-3 lists sev-
eral ways to use the clicker-reward system.
Table 10-3
Clicker-Reward System
Command
Action
Sit
Holding the clicker in one hand and a treat in the
other, lure your dog into the sit position by raising
the treat above her head. As your dog shifts into
position, say “Sit,” click, and reward her.
Down
From a sitting position, take the treat hand and
lure your dog into position by dropping your hand
from her nose to between her front paws. As she
shifts, say “Down,” click, and treat.
Part III: Doggie Delinquency 
146

Command
Action
Follow or Let’s go
Tie a leash around your waist, positioning your
dog on a consistent side — say to your left. Hold
the clicker in your left hand, treats in your right,
and your right arm over your left thigh to lure your
dog into the proper following position. Say
“Follow” or “Let’s go,” click, and reward her posi-
tion at your heel.
Come
Come is the classic disconnection-reconnection
sequence. When your dog is apart from you, the
goal is to have a word cue to induce your dog to
come close to you. When out in an enclosure or
on a drag lead, click and reward the instant your
dog chooses to check in with you. If you have a
dog who seems oblivious to your presence, insti-
gate her interest, not by badgering her, but by
snooping in the grass or playing with her favorite
toy or by giving another pet attention. When she
saunters over, say “Come” as you click and
reward her.
The purpose of the clicker is to highlight the moment your dog
responds correctly, not as a command to actually trigger a behav-
ior. For example, if your goal is to have your dog come when you
call, click and reward when she’s at your side, not when she’s a dis-
tance from you. Though she may come initially in response to your
click, she’ll lose interest over time.
You can also use the click-reward system to highlight good behav-
ior, such as good chewing, greeting, or housetraining habits. To do
so, either keep a clicker and treats with you at all times (wearing a
fanny pack is a good idea because it saves on soggy-treats-in-the-
laundry mishaps) or place several cups around the house with
ready clickers and treats. Each time your dog is chewing an appro-
priate toy, behaving well with children or other pets, greeting
others respectfully, or eliminating in the right location, click and
treat her.
Although nothing is as exhilarating as seeing your dog make a
quick clicker connection, it’s important to orchestrate its disap-
pearance lest you or your dog become clicker dependent.
If you think of your dog’s brain as a blank CD, you’ll note that your
interactions create behavioral memories that are replayed again
and again. The use of the clicker simply speeds up your dog’s 
Chapter 10: Inspiring Behavior with Motivational Techniques 147

association and memory for chosen words and/or signal cues.
Once this process is completed, however, you need to phase off
both the sound of the clicker and the reward so that you’ll be able
to call up these responses simply by word or visual prompting.
The best approach is two weeks on, two weeks to phase out.
During the first two weeks, use your clicker to highlight a chosen
behavior or behaviors, such as housetraining or teaching your dog
to “Sit.” Each time she successfully responds, click and reward her.
After two weeks of focused reactions, begin to phase out the click-
treat response intermittently: Click-treat every other time, then
every third repetition, and back to one for one so that your dog
doesn’t know when she’ll be rewarded with a click-treat response.
Continually reward your dog with verbal praise, petting, or playful
interaction to ensure her continued enthusiasm. During this two-
week period, begin to eliminate the clicker response entirely so
that you’re able to direct her without food or a sound reward.
Targeting
Targeting uses an object as a pointer to direct your dog to a speci-
fied spot or in a certain direction. Targeting techniques help teach
your dog basic training sequences and more advanced moves, as
well as help you improve her behavior and social skills.
Targeting applies the behavior-reward system by using an object to
guide a dog’s focus:
 Target disc: Though commercial discs do exist, a discarded
container lid is adequate. For this intended purpose, a dog is
taught to step on or nose the lid and is rewarded each time
she does. Once the association is clear, you can use the lid to
enable a variety of learned behavior:
• Promote good household manners or confidence with
unfamiliar people or settings, chiefly by teaching the dog
where to stand or sit during meals, quiet times, and
doorbell greetings.
• Aid advanced obedience lessons, agility exercises, and
household manners by placing the disc at greater dis-
tances from the handler.
• If the dog is taught to nose the disc, it may be hung on
furnishings or attached to persons to teach behaviors
such as closing an open cabinet, approaching a person,
or nosing a ball.
Part III: Doggie Delinquency 
148

 Target stick: A target stick is basically a sort of baton or
pointer. Like a disc, you can purchase a commercial stick,
although you can use other objects (such as the end of a long
spoon or child’s toy) as well. With this tool, you can teach a
dog to move toward or follow the stick with her nose, a
process that most often involves the reward of food. You can
then maneuver the stick to
• Encourage a dog’s response to basic directions, such as
“Sit,” “Down,” or “Follow.”
• Aid a dog in more complex training sequences, such as
those associated with agility.
• Help a dog overcome fears or phobias, as experienced
with people or objects (street grates, unusual objects).
 Point training: Like targeting, this technique applies a station-
ary lure to help a dog move to where the handler wants him,
thus the dog can be used to indicate a specific person or a par-
ticular location that the dog should approach. Initially paired
with a food reward, a dog is taught the pointer can ultimately
be replaced by her handler’s index finger. Although the reach of
the finger may be shorter than a target stick, it’s always handy
and can be used to signal basic training exercises.
Magical learning tools
We find two teaching tools indispensable: treat cups and snack
packs. You can use them to condition cooperative behavior,
reward good manners, and encourage your friends and family to
take part in your dog’s education:
 Treat cup: Take a cup or empty plastic container. Fill the con-
tainer half full with bits of a chosen food reward. Shake the
cup and reward your dog until he associates the sound with
treats. (Cut a hole in the lid for easy distribution.) Use the
treat cup as described throughout this book, but especially to
condition a quick sitting response, appropriate greeting man-
ners, and a cheerful “Come.”
 Snack packs: Use a fanny pack or an otherwise designated
pouch. Fill it with treats and a clicker if you’re utilizing one.
Use it as described throughout this book, but especially to
condition your dog to interact politely. If your dog barks,
jumps, or paws at you for a reward, ignore her. Only reward
good manners, such as sitting calmly in front of you or chew-
ing on a toy or bone.
Chapter 10: Inspiring Behavior with Motivational Techniques 149

Using a Reward System
Dogs, like people, love rewards; however, different things motivate
each dog. Some dogs will do back flips for a flake of cereal, while
others demand chopped liver. Some love a toy above all else, while
others (though rare) are justly satisfied with quality attention.
Treats and toys
If you’re on the fence about using treats to condition your dog’s
good behavior and responsiveness, it may help to know that you’ll
not be using treats forever. Food is initially offered to help your
dog understand your direction. Think of it less like a bribe and
more like a positive reward to highlight good behavior, or perhaps
simply pay for a job well done.
Once a particular direction is understood, you can phase out treats
and replace them with petting and verbal praise.
Rank toys and treats. If your dog will sit happily for a Cheerio but
does back flips for dried liver, set aside this high-ranking snack for
more difficult behaviors, such as coming outside or ignoring a
temptation (for example, another dog). Rank toys with the same
focus on finding one that trumps all others.
If you’re averse to using treats or your dog simply doesn’t like
them, you’re not alone. There are many theories of dog training,
and the first thing to note is that they all work to some extent and
also reflect the attitudes and beliefs of the trainers. If you’d like to
Part III: Doggie Delinquency

Where does your dog’s heart lie?
To discover which reward holds top billing with your dog, do the following test:
Ask two friends (whom your dog knows) to stand 10 feet apart. Give one a cup of
treats and the other a favorite toy. Bring your dog into the room and have them simul-
taneously try to lure and then reward her. Repeat this exercise three times.
Take the chosen reward from the last exercise and now ask the other person to
simply kneel down and call to your dog sweetly, rewarding her with affection when
she responds. Repeat this several times.
Prioritize your rewards, using the most attractive one for difficult sequences, but
using the others intermittingly or when applicable to mix it up.

use praise or toys to motivate your dog’s cooperation instead of
treats, then do it with gusto, selecting a word to highlight the
moment your dog cooperates. However, the psychological research
is quite clear, suggesting that food works faster and is easier for
inexperienced trainers to use.
Step 1: The treat connection
Your dog doesn’t have to mind you. She’ll choose whether to listen,
especially when she’s off leash. Using treats motivates learning, and,
once the behavior is conditioned, a verbal direction is sufficient to
encourage a response. To flow seamlessly from using treats to relying
on verbal directions and praise, follow this pattern:
 Introduce your dog to one new word or sequence at a time.
Say the direction as you lure your dog into position with a
treat or toy. If your dog is confused, stop saying the direction
and simply concentrate on luring him into place. After he
moves into position reliably, say the word the moment he
cooperates.
 In addition, say the direction anytime you see your dog
moving into the position naturally. For example, if you’re
working on “Down,” say it anytime you see your dog lying
down naturally. Praise her verbally or with loving attention.
 Show family members and friends how to give your dog
direction and prompt good manners, providing everyone
with treats and toys, so that your message transfers.
Step 2: Phasing out treats
As your dog show signs of learning a command — for example,
moving into the down position quickly and without pause or con-
frontation — over-exaggerate a hand signal that will enable you to
direct your dog visually as well as verbally. Phase out treat-
dependence as you stagger your rewards so that they come every
other response, and eventually in an irregular pattern. Keep up the
praise and verbal appreciation.
If you’re using a clicker, pair each click with a food reward. After a
behavior is learned, you may phase out the clicker by using it only
intermittently. Though you can use food without a clicker, don’t click
without a food reward, lest the sound lose its dramatic influence.
Once your dog has learned a direction, reward her intermittently.
This system keeps her attention sharp, while highlighting the
verbal direction over the reward.
Chapter 10: Inspiring Behavior with Motivational Techniques 151

Meals
At times, we recommend using a dog’s regular feeding to encour-
age good behavior by dispensing food one bit at a time for good
behavior. In these situations, a person can elevate his or her social
standing while conditioning civility. Note that practice sessions
with the dog/puppy must be coordinated to your regularly sched-
uled mealtimes. Use a dog’s meal when you want to
 Calm an assertive puppy/dog’s personality
 Bond with a stressed shelter/abused dog
 Encourage a timid puppy/dog’s confidence
 Associate the direction “Come” positively
A few other training tools, namely the clicker and the snack pack,
are especially useful in this process and can accelerate your dog’s
behavioral memory. (See the section “Choosing Training Tools and
Gadgets,” earlier in this chapter.) With this method, you may use
food to motivate your dog’s cooperation throughout the day. Over
a two-week period, you can gradually phase out treating for every
correct response. Because your dog will be unsure when the food
reward is going to be offered, his attention will remain sharp. Don’t
forget to praise him each time, though.
Part III: Doggie Delinquency 
152
Timing your treat
The timing of your reaction can help or hinder your dog’s learning capacity. To
understand this concept, ask someone to toss a ball into the air. Mark the moment
the ball reaches its highest mark by saying “Yes” or by depressing a clicker. Repeat
this exercise until your timing is perfect.
Now relate this exercise to your dog’s capacity to understand your desire: If you’re
trying to teach your dog to sit versus jump, you’ll want to mark or click the second
her bottom hits the floor. Your reward will guarantee a repeat performance. On the
other hand, if you mark the moment she jumps, she’ll just as willingly repeat that
behavior instead.

Tailoring Your Rewards to 
Your Dog’s Personality
Regardless of your dog’s priority, the Reward System works by
increasing your dog’s focus on the learning task and the speed at
which she can identify your intention, and linking it to a specific
word or signal. If the goal is to have your dog “Sit” or “Potty” 
when directed, then you must offer a reward when your dog acts
appropriately.
You should also reward your dog based on his personality type.
Assertive
Some dogs are assertive because of their breed (see Chapter 6), while
in others it’s an individual personality trait (Chapter 5). In each litter
of puppies, one or two puppies are generally bossy and controlling
by nature. These puppies bring the same level of intensity into their
human family. How can you tell whether you have a dominant puppy?
If your puppy ignores or defies you often, stands in your way, or goes
to great lengths to control situations (from greeting visitors to dis-
rupting your quiet time), she’s exhibiting a dominant personality.
Please note that these behaviors aren’t signs of a “bad” dog, just
one who has a strong sense of herself and prefers to give direction
rather than take it. Fortunately, you can condition good behavior
without breaking this dog’s spirit. Use Chapters 3 and 12 to set rea-
sonable boundaries and then begin with these exercises:
 Use a fanny pack filled with treats to center your dog’s focus
and encourage her to accept direction as a positive interac-
tion, instead of issuing corrections, which are perceived as
confrontational.
 Teach your dog “Excuse me” by moving her out of your way
when she’s in it. There’s no faster way to remedy her delusions
of grandeur than to remind her constantly that she needs to be
more mindful of where you are, versus the other way around.
 Design a lesson plan (see Chapter 12) to highlight the direc-
tions most essential to your day. Reward each cooperative
response. If you’re using food rewards, consider employing a
clicker as well.
 Once your dog is responding eagerly to your directions,
involve other family members. Chaperone children, using a
leash to enforce a respectful reaction to each direction.
Chapter 10: Inspiring Behavior with Motivational Techniques 153

Fearful
Timid dogs often look abused, although that’s not always the case.
By nature, some dogs have a low self-esteem, which may be an
unintended result of how the dog is treated in their home environ-
ment. For example, dogs rarely approach each other from head on
unless they’re playing or attacking. Some dogs (especially the
smaller ones) are cautious when approached and often back up
defensively. If the person persists in trying to reach or touch him
by following or chasing, the dog often becomes afraid and assumes
a submissive posture to ward off the “attack.”
Shouting is another example of miscommunication. Though a natu-
ral expression of human anger, this loud reaction (perceived as
barking) can spell terror to a puppy/dog with low self-esteem.
Part III: Doggie Delinquency 
154
Getting your dog to “Come”
Though your dog’s response to the direction “Come” is not the be-all or end-all of
the training process, it’s especially important if your goal is off-lead control. Though
Chapter 12 outlines the lesson “Come,” you can use your dog’s meals to create a
positive association to the word.
Avoid repeating or overusing “Come”: come inside, come while walking, and come
before isolation or unpleasant handling experiences. Overuse dilutes its intended
meaning and often turns your dog off just as a nagging spouse would. Your dog
should think of “Come” as the human phrase equivalent of “Huddle.” Here are two
options:
 Place your dog’s meal in your pocket or fanny pack. Either let your dog free in
an enclosed yard or place her on a drag lead. Each time your dog returns to
you, say “Come,” and then praise and reward her with a handful of her meal.
Once your dog learns where her food stash is, she may Velcro to your side.
Consider ways to encourage separation, such as throwing a toy or introducing
another person or dog, or simply ignoring her until she loses interest.
 Fill a treat cup with kibble and run away from your dog as you call out her name.
Reward your togetherness, linking “Come” to receiving a reward and playing a
fun game as well.
As your dog quickly associates “Come” with being together, begin to say “Come”
as your dog is in the process of running over to you. If you’re having trouble prompt-
ing your dog’s return, don’t call her repetitively or run at her in a huff. Instead, act
like another dog, either kneeling to poke inquisitively at the ground, or by taking out
a treat cup or favorite toy and pretending to reward yourself.

Consider these thoughts and options:
 Reflect on the situations that initiate fear reactions for your
dog and use her meals or treats to create a positive associa-
tion to each.
 If your dog backs up when you reach down to hold/pet her,
turn sideways and kneel down at her level avoiding all eye
contact. Feed her handfuls of food as you caress the side of
her head with your free hand. Also engage other family and
friends to approach and pet her as you portion out her food.
 Dogs often back away when approached with a leash or to be
medicated. Teach your dog the directions “Sit” and “Wait”
(see Chapters 3 and 12) and link food to these directions.
Practice simply approaching her, waiting to actually medicate
or handle her until you’ve regained her trust.
Rescue dogs
Regardless of their age or situation, a dog that is rescued, having
been abandoned or in a shelter, can have emotional problems due
to the experience. Some dogs act manic, but that behavior is
simply a mask for their being emotionally out of control. Even the
best shelter situations are jarring, often prompting defensiveness
and confusion (see Chapter 15).
Fortunately, dogs are an incredibly forgiving species and are eager
to bond with new families and people who provide for and love
them. Though these dogs need special consideration, many need
merely to be reintroduced to the routine of everyday life. Here are
a few tips to initiate your bond together:
 Give your dog’s meal at the time of normal feeding to solidify
your constant presence in her world and condition coopera-
tive behavior. This approach goes a long way in shaping both
her understanding of, and response to, your direction.
 If you have children, let them play a role in the reconditioning
process. Place the treats/meal in a cup, and with the children,
approach the dog when she is eating, resting on a mat, or
chewing an appropriate toy. If she growls, stop immediately
and call for help.
 Play training is essential with rescue dogs as the intensity of
their former situation often overshadows their ability to have
fun. Use treat cups to call your dog back and forth from one
person to the next as you use her name. Hide from your dog
and/or run away from her as you shake the cup — all the
while rewarding and praising her.
Chapter 10: Inspiring Behavior with Motivational Techniques 155

Many rescue dogs equate the directional tone used in training with
past corrections or disapproval. As you teach your dog new direc-
tions like “Sit” and “Down,” lure her with her meal as described in
Chapter 15; be generous with your praise, too.
Shaping Behaviors
You can break down many learned behaviors, from “Come” and
“Down” to agility sequences and tricks, into several separate actions,
allowing you to teach each separately before linking them altogether.
The direction “Down,” for example, can be broken into three
sequences: looking down, moving the legs forward, and finally low-
ering the body into position. The direction “Come” also links three
actions together: When a dog is called from a distance, she must
respond to her name, leave the area and run toward the person,
and, finally, slow down as she gets close and fully reconnects.
Any sequential behavior can be taught step by step before linking
the steps together. This technique is ideal for young puppies or for
dogs who are unable or unwilling to concentrate on the overall
request. Building on your dog’s success rate instantly lightens
what can otherwise be a stressful situation.
In addition, simply saying a direction as your dog repeats a behav-
ior enables you to practice shaping techniques throughout the day.
Luring with food
You may use food to practice luring. To lure your dog, simply think
of the lure as attached to your dog’s nose by a short thread. Then
consider her movements to discover how to maneuver the food to
lure her into a specific position (see Table 10-4).
When luring, move the reward very slowly. Jerky motions encour-
age jumping or moving and can confuse your dog. Though she may
not catch on right away, she’ll focus on the goal when you repeat
the luring motion.

Down
From a sitting position, take the lure from your dog’s nose
straight down to the floor between her paws. Say
“Down” as her elbow contacts the floor.
Stand
From a sitting or down position, take the lure and hold it
between the bottom of your dog’s nose and his lip. Draw
the lure up and out at a slight angle until your dog stands;
say “Stand” at this time.
Follow
Hold the lure in your right hand and cross it in front of
you to your left side. Hold the lure at your dog’s head
level, saying “Follow” as he moves along cooperatively.
Come 
When using a lure to encourage “Come,” work indoors
initially when your dog is eager to interact with you. Take
the lure in front of your dog’s nose and back up as you
call out “Come.” Kneel down and reward your dog as
you pet her lovingly. “Come” should always encourage
her desire to be with you.
Using pressure points to direct
Your dog has many pressure points on her body that, when touched
gently, will induce her into a specific position (see Table 10-5).
Avoid manhandling or jerking your dog around as it is both unnec-
essary and hurtful.

Place the flat of your thumb between your dog’s shoulder
blades, applying constant pressure. If she braces against
you, lift one of her paws up gently to create a tripod
effect. Say “Down” as she moves into position.
Forward
When moving your dog forward, hold her steadily with
your right hand as you tuck her tail between her hind
legs. Say “Forward” as she moves ahead of you.
(“Forward” is helpful when leading a dog into a crate.)

If you’re moving your dog side to side, hold her head

Stand
To stand your dog, tickle the underside of her belly along
her last rib and pull her buckle forward under her chin
with your right hand. Say “Stand” as she stands steadily
in a relaxed fashion.
Modeling as an example
Modeling can refer to both behavior and training. An obvious exam-
ple of negative modeling is the chaos that often ensues when visi-
tors arrive. If you rise to your dog’s level of excitement, then you’re
modeling her reaction. For an example of positive modeling, con-
sider the same situation as you remain calm, only including your
dog after she models you by calming down. Though it may take
many repetitions to note an improvement, it will come.
Modeling for training can be as goofy as lying down to encourage
the same or as inclusive as using a well-trained dog to mirror the
proper response to a new student.
Stay calm in any situation that confuses, excites, or startles your
dog. Though your interaction may be heartfelt, reassuring pos-
tures and tone often convey confusion. Stand tall as though noth-
ing were out of the ordinary: Your dog will feel secure in your
confidence and learn to mirror your reaction in all situations.

 Creating consistency

 Letting your dog teach himself
D
ogs and people really do want the same thing: They want to
get along and spend time together. Unfortunately, no one can
enjoy an ill-mannered dog, which leads to a vicious cycle: left at
home or corralled into a kitchen, this dog learns nothing about
the world and how to behave. When finally invited into the family
circle, the dog is simply bursting with excitement but has never
been adequately educated to know what to do. So his hyperactivity
becomes annoying to his human family, resulting in further isola-
tion but no further learning.
To survive as a good human companion, a dog must learn what to
do in his life. He must not only learn how to respond to formal
commands, such as “Sit,” but he must learn to interpret and 
appropriately respond to human signals and frequently occurring
situations. Given the opportunity, a dog will spend his entire life
learning, and we must recognize that we’re consciously or uncon-
sciously teaching him all of the time. Understanding how your dog
learns allows you to shape his behavior to make him a better and
happier companion.
Consistency Counts
If you want a well-trained and civilized dog, you, and everyone who
lives with you, should be consistent in your behaviors involving
your dog. The first thing that you should do is to always use a
word or phrase to signal what you want your dog to do. If you’re

Part III: Doggie Delinquency 
160
going upstairs with him, say, “Upstairs.” If you’re going to put a
leash on him, say, “Leash on.” If your words always signal actions,
the dog soon learns to pay attention to the sounds coming from
your mouth because they signal what he’s supposed to do next.
Always use the words before you act so that the dog can learn the
meaning of your language. Everyone in your family must use the
same words. If the aim is to get the dog off the sofa, make sure that
everyone knows that you’re all going to use the word “Off.” If one
person yells “Get away” and another “No!”, this inconsistency only
confuses matters. Whether you’re starting your journey with a
young pup or an older dog doesn’t matter as much as maintaining
a consistent approach.
Dogs respond very well to routines and repetition. Consider your
morning ritual: rising out of bed, taking a shower, eating breakfast,
letting the dog out, drinking coffee. When was your routine set?
Probably in childhood. Whatever the sequence, you repeat the rou-
tine, quite unconsciously, day after day.
Shaping your dog’s behavior is no different. Dogs actually love rou-
tines even more than you do: The more regular their schedule and
the greater your predictability, the greater their feelings of safety
and security and the more likely they are to behave in a coopera-
tive fashion.
Begin by establishing routines around your dog’s basic needs:
eating, drinking, resting, playing, and eliminating. Assign a word
and a specific routine for each need, creating a chart to help your
household follow through (see Table 11-1). Though your dog’s
schedule will vary slightly throughout maturity, the constancy of
these words and routines will tie him to the certainties of his
everyday life and give you a mutual language base.

Reconnecting

Remember, your dog doesn’t speak English (see Chapter 3).
Though she listens to you, most of what you say sounds like gib-
berish. When a word pops in that she recognizes, it’s as exciting to
her as our hearing recognizable words when in a foreign land.
Though you need to take time out of your day to teach your dog
the proper responses to your directions (for example, Sit-Stay),
once she’s learned those responses, you can use the directions
throughout the day. Practicing these exercises with your dog is like
your being taught in school the skills you need for everyday life:
Counting fruit or balancing your checkbook can be thought of as
learning to stay or behaving appropriately when greeting someone
or on an outing.
Also, make sure that everyone understands that your dog loves
attention. He’ll repeat anything that guarantees interaction and,
like a human child, he can’t distinguish negative from positive. If a
response guarantees anyone’s reaction, it will be repeated: If you
put his food dish down when he sits calmly, then he’ll sit calmly. If
you ignore hyperactivity and only interact with your dog when he’s
rational and responsive, then your dog will learn to behave rationally.
Of course, the reverse is also true: If a dog’s demanding posture is
responded to, he’ll learn those undesirable behaviors just as quickly.
Monitoring Human Behavior
Inconsistency will create confusion in your dog’s mind and often
intensifies her reactivity. All the people in your dog’s life should
know the rules and words to use around your dog.
Imagine trying to understand what to do based on the reactions
that you get to your behavior. Imagine trying to work out the rules
if one person insists on consistency while another welcomes chaos.
Under such circumstances you or your dog won’t be able to deter-
mine how best to behave when meeting someone new. In dogs, such
inconsistency for different people in their lives invariably snowballs
into maniac anxiety, and the resulting confusion guarantees only
one thing: that your dog will not be welcomed into polite society or
be the star attraction at family gatherings as he’d loved to be.
Of course, as anyone who has shared their life with a dog will tell
you, that friends and family members can be the hardest “dogs”
to train. Everyone has their own ideas as to how to control dog
behavior, and many people are, by nature, very strong willed.
Shouting, “Don’t let him jump!” (or similar epithets) at someone to
rally their support will fall on deaf ears: No one likes to hear the
words “don’t” or “no.”

It’s hard for some people to see the downside to ecstatic joy. When
asked, they’ll tell you that the wild greeting they get from their dog
at the door is one of the highlights of their day. Unfortunately, per-
mitting and, in effect, rewarding hyperactivity takes its toll: A dog
who manically greets his own people will greet everyone that way.
Furthermore, if the dog suffers from separation anxiety, even the
sound of someone nearing the door is likely to trigger hyperactive
anticipation, which, when unfulfilled, may result in destructive
behavior.
If you’re trying to change the behaviors of people when interacting
with your dog, it’s sometimes easier if you control the dog’s behav-
ior. Do the problems arise when your kids get off the bus, or your
partner walks in from a long day at the office, or your friend who
just adores your dog comes for a visit? If you can predict their
arrivals, considering leading your dog to the door to greet them as
described in Chapters 3 and 12 or, alternatively, diverting your
dog’s attention with a new toy. If you can prevent your dog’s manic
behavior, then it has no chance to be rewarded, and your dog’s
calm demeanor may help change the expectations of the humans
in your life. Some things to try include
 Substitute a response by refocusing your dog’s attention on
another object, such as a treat cup or clicker. In the case of
doorway excitement, teach your dog to sit when you shake a
cup filled with treats and then practice at the door, shaking
the cup as you open, shut, and knock on the door yourself.
When your dog is fully conditioned to the sound, ask visitors
to shake the cup, rewarding your dog for sitting quietly.
Of course, you can’t train everyone
In a perfect world, you’d be able to control everyone, consistency would reign, and
your dog would never be confused. Alas, it’s no perfect world out there and, try as
you might, some people just won’t heed your advice. If it’s an occasional stranger
on the street, don’t worry about it, but if it’s a live-in companion that interacts fre-
quently with your pup, then you must come up with a plan.
If your companion encourages jumping, exercise your dog prior to his or her inter-
action with your pet to tone things down a bit. If he urges your dog to jump on the
furniture, agree upon one piece of furniture and teach your dog that the others are
off-limits. If feeding from the table is the main issue, be sure to feed your dog first
and reward her for staying on her bed during meals.
Be creative and think outside of the box: You’ll find there’s always another way
around your problems with both four-footed and two-footed dogs.

 Try pitching your goal with a positive zinger, such as, “We’re
training our dog to say hello politely, which involves four
paws on the floor.” If you explain your goal this way, then
teaching your dog becomes a group effort rather than an
order, and most people like the opportunity to give the dog a
treat for behaving. (See Chapter 13 for more information.)
 Teach your dog a greeting trick, such as paw, belly up, or roll
over. Everyone can teach these cheerful interactions, and
they’re a wonderful way to break the ice and initiate positive
interaction from the get-go.
Living with Kids and Dogs
Got kids? Your family dog will be one of their childhood memories,
which puts the pressure on you to ensure that your dog is a civi-
lized companion. Because the lion’s share of the responsibility is
resting squarely on your shoulders, here are a few techniques to
encourage their participation and self-control:
 Become a treat hero. If your dog or puppy enjoys treats or
(even better) food, place a handful in a cup and let your child
dole them out when the dog responds to simple commands
like “Sit” or “Come.” Work through the directions in Chapter 12,
transferring the directional skills to your entire family. Phase
off using the treat cup after a week of cooperative responses.
At this time, shake the cup only half the time as you position
and praise your dog’s cooperation. Although you’ll gradually
reduce the number of treats, remember that praise and pet-
ting should be continued as a reward.
 Encourage more than you discourage. Kids (like dogs) are
very sensitive to language and tone. When you discourage
their behavior, you are, in essence, throwing a wet blanket on
their relationship with your dog. Be creative, teaching them
appropriate games to play and using treats to shape more
positive interactions. Focus on what your children are doing
right with their dog. If you have to step in to control the inter-
action, immediately help them find a more positive activity so
that you can end on a high note.
 Create activity charts. Kids are so easy to please: Sometimes
just an activity chart with stickers for getting the dog to
respond to simple commands or perform simple tricks can be
enough to prompt their eager participation. If you’re unsure
how best to motivate your children to cooperate, ask their
teachers for suggestions.
Chapter 11: Helping Your Dog Learn from Everyday Living 163

Part III: Doggie Delinquency 
164
 Catch the team spirit. Kids (like dogs) love to be a part of a
project! Try dispersing the responsibilities of caring for your
dog so that not all the tasks rest on one person’s shoulders.
You will have to help out one way or another, but when
encouraged to help, children feel needed and empowered.
Table 11-2 outlines some age-appropriate activities.
Don’t involve your children if your dog has shown any signs of
aggression. Dogs naturally dominate young children: Asking
them to care for an aggressive dog is putting them in grave
danger. Get professional help.
 Creatively contain your dog. Create play stations for your dog
(see Chapter 3) in each room, securing him when he’s unable to
contain himself. When you can supervise the interaction, ask
your children to race about, thereby teaching your dog how to
displace her urge to chase by offering her a favorite toy/bone
for remaining calm. Provide a crate or secure a quiet area and
take your dog there when the children are overwhelming or
when her behavior is clearly evidencing that she’s out of 
control. Think of this area not as a punishment zone, but as
a quiet room where she can go to unwind. When dogs get
stirred up, it’s often due to being overstimulated or overtired.
If you’re raising a puppy or teaching your old dog some new tricks,
your children may seem to undermine the very principles you’re
working hard to instill. Don’t get mad: after all they’re kids. Think
back: Did you always follow your parents’ direction? On the whole,
children, like puppies, are playful and interactive, and both are
very attuned to negative attention. It may be simply that your dog
views your kids more like playmates than respected leaders.
Please consider the following:
 If you get frustrated with your child, you’ll look as though
you’re frustrated with your dog, too. Sure, we know you’re
yelling at your child, but your dog can’t decipher the focus of
your feelings. Your reaction may lead her to feel more anxious
or aggressive when your children are present, and may ulti-
mately create a feeling of sibling rivalry between them.
 Try not to tense up when your dog and child/children are
together. This reaction is understandable to us; however, your
dog isn’t human. If the tension is notable only when the child
and dog are together, then (in the dog’s mind) the child brings
tension.
 Don’t lock up your dog when your children’s friends come
to play. Your dog won’t understand why and will get hyper or
assertive whenever their friends come to call. Think of other
creative options, such as leashing your dog, using treat cups

to encourage contained greeting, or enclosing her in an open
playpen or crate until she is accustomed to the new visitor.

Age-Appropriate Activities
Age
Activity
2–4
(Adult supervision is required at all times. All activities must be
closely supervised.) Scoop the dry meal into a bowl: As they get
older, they can instruct the dog to sit as they put the meal down.
This age can also play simple games, such as fetching thrown
toys, with the help of an adult.
4–10
(Condition your dog to all games and training activities ahead of
your child’s involvement. Adult supervision is still required.)
Games like soccer or Frisbee tossing can be a sure fit for chil-
dren of this age, and their natural enthusiasm for play can go a
long way toward tiring out your dog. Joint walks can give you
time to be together, and even the act of scooping the poop can
be shared! Of course, you can allocate feeding responsibilities,
although do keep a check-off chart handy to ensure that your
dog’s needs aren’t overlooked.
10 and Up 
(Use your judgment. If you can’t hold onto your dog, don’t ask
your children to walk him.) Children this age should be encour-
aged to care for the dog as though it was their baby. Passing on
this or other training books can help them understand how their
dog/puppy develops, thinks, and learns. If possible, sign up for a
training class together and watch your child handle your dog:
Your heart will swell at their success.
Chapter 11: Helping Your Dog Learn from Everyday Living 165
Early stress syndrome
Irresponsible breeders often push for the early adoption of puppies. While the cute
factor of a 6-week-old puppy can’t be disputed, it should be criminal to take such a
young pup away from her mom. Undeveloped and emotionally weak, such a puppy
will likely be brought into a home where people (unless educated) will coddle them
ad nauseum. Too often, the result of this heartfelt adoration is the development of
a Super Alpha: a puppy who never learns respect for anyone. These puppies are
often excessively nippy and may show aggression prematurely. If these behaviors
aren’t arrested, the puppy may become a danger to live with and show behaviors
that look as if he has a split personality: lovely when seeking a resource like food
or attention, demonic when interrupted. If this description sounds familiar, please
seek professional help.

166
Avoidance 101
No one likes to feel discomfort. Most people will go to great measures
to avoid pain or disappointment and, as parents we strive to protect
our children from physical and emotional harm. Your dog’s instinct
to protect himself from harm is no different. Still, it’s here that we
must examine the differences in our species, since sometimes what
we consider as emotional support is often misconstrued by your
pup, and your efforts to “discipline” her may, in fact, not be com-
municating any useful information..
Soothing your dog’s fear
When your dog shows fear or discomfort, your immediate impulse
may be to soothe her. It’s heartfelt, but detrimental, too. Remember,
your dog doesn’t understand the reasoning behind human behav-
ior and emotions: He merely reads your posture, eye contact, and
tone of voice.
When we comfort an animal, we lower both our body and our head,
speak in a moderated tone, and look concerned; to a dog, these
body cues bespeak utter panic. To a dog, we look cornered, trapped,
and cowering — enforcing their fear rather than assuaging it.
A better approach to soothing a dog’s anxiety is to mimic canine
confidence and let your dog hang in the shadow of your protection
until he feels safe enough to stand on his own. To do so:
 Teach your dog “Back,” directing him there whenever you
anticipate a reaction or when his posture bespeaks caution.
Leaders, lead.
 Use the direction “Under” (see Chapter 3) if you’re sitting,
directing your dog under your legs instead of propping him on
your lap or allowing him to dance about in front of you.
 Instruct your dog to “Follow” (see Chapter 12) whenever
walking in unknown terrain or near a roadway. This message
conveys guardianship and lets your dog depend on your 
protection.
 Use “Stay” to teach your dog to be still. This direction helps
to contain his flight impulse and concentrates his attention on
your pose.
 Stand confidently in the face of any distraction. If the object
of your dog’s fear is stationary, let his leash go loose, approach
it, and feign sniffing. As dogs see by sniffing, your reaction
shows him how to overcome his fears while instilling confi-
dence in your authority.

When discipline instills fear
No one wants to frighten their dog, but many people do just that,
often under the guise of disciplining them.
The truth of the matter is that puppy-rearing philosophies lag
behind the newest theories on child-rearing, and we all would
do well to take note. For example, physical abuse in response to
parental frustration is illegal. Even the suspicion of emotional
abuse will have school officials taking note.
Unfortunately, the same doesn’t hold true with the raising of pup-
pies. People still yell at their dog or puppy, though these methods
have been proven ineffective. Others are locked into a vicious
cycle of physical corrections, though they have no educational
value and often instill aggression or make matters worse. If the
goal of discipline is to teach a dog better manners, then the effort
to communicate as much must be closely examined. Here’s what
doesn’t work and why:
 Hitting: When a hand is raised in frustration, a dog immediately
seizes on the rapid motion and not on any other previous
behavior. The predatory response part of her brain that acti-
vates upon seeing motion is an entity unto itself: Any prior
impulses are abandoned. When the hand makes contact
(and stings the skin), that feeling must also be interpreted.
Because hitting has no real world template (after all, dog’s
don’t hit each other), fear is often shown as an appeasement
gesture. The true emotional damage comes into the relation-
ship, however, when it is the very person who is attacking
her that a dog needs to turn to when life doesn’t make sense .
Sound like abuse? You’re right — it is — and completely 
ineffective.
 Yelling: Yelling is barking to a dog. Loud and interruptive, it
will likely stop a dog in her tracks and may even cause an
appeasement gesture, although neither is a sure sign of com-
prehension. Please reference Chapter 3 for more insight.
 Chasing: Chasing a dog is insane and has no retentive value,
save to guarantee a repeat performance. Put the shoe on your
foot for a moment and imagine being chased by an enraged
400 pound gorilla who was also the very one you depended on
for life’s sustenance. A dog has no other option but to process
this reaction as a game or offer an appeasement gesture so
extreme as to assure your pity. Nothing can be learned, and
while this predatory attack is damaging emotionally, it com-
monly results in manic displacement activities.

The ingredients of a good correction
The goal of any correction is to discourage behavior: Whether your
dog is nipping, jumping, counter-cruising, or barking, the strategy
you develop to react to the behavior either supports or extin-
guishes the behavior.
Before attempting to resolve a behavior that distresses you, make
a short list of what your dog really likes, from attention to play to
treats. Next, list your frustrations, why your dog is repeating those
behaviors, and what exactly you’d like your dog to do instead (see
Table 11-3).

Encouraging self-training
Dogs, like children and people, learn through cause and effect. If you want to get
rid of a specific behavior, consider why your dog is doing it in the first place. Is he
jumping up to get your attention or to get a resource or make himself comfortable?
If these reactions are effective, he’ll do them again.
If, however, when he jumps up, your hands consistently raise to cover your face
and you ignore him, she won’t keep jumping up for attention. If, at the same time, you
encourage her to sit or fetch a toy and give her attention for that, she’ll soon aban-
don jumping for sitting or play. If she jumps on the counter to steal food and noth-
ing is there or she finds a distasteful snack (bread laced with wasabi sauce, for
example), she’ll avoid this activity all together.
With regards to jumping on the furnishings, your dog’s just as much of an oppor-
tunist as you are: Offer her a comfortable alternative, such as a floor pillow or dog
bed, and when you can’t be there to control his choice, place something on the fur-
nishings that make comfort impossible.

Next, outline the three ingredients of a good correction and how
you can implement them:
 A good correction should be seen as coming from the envi-
ronment, not from you. At no point should your dog see
the correction as coming from the person upon whom she
relies most.
 A good correction should cause a withdrawal in group 
interaction. The best corrections should cause an immediate
departure or an emotional withdrawal of attention. (See
Chapter 13.)
Your attention is what most strongly motivates your dog’s
behavior.
 Any good correction must end in prompting an appropriate
displacement activity. Never just tell your dog what he has
done wrong; show him what he should have done instead.
“Get your ball,” “Give kisses,” “Outside.” Though the direc-
tions you give are individual to the infraction, each should
allow you to reconnect with your dog and teach him what he
should be doing instead.

I
n this chapter, you not only discover how to teach your dog
basic directions, but you find out what each exercise conveys
from your dog’s perspective. Though other books cover obedience
exercises for competition at dog shows or focus on age appropri-
ate puppy training, this book looks at daily interactions and the
basic skills necessary to live peaceably with your dog. Dogs, like
kids, need a sense of structure and predictability to feel safe and
connected, but unlike children, they aren’t born prewired to under-
stand our language: We must teach them. Think of educating your
dog like teaching a foreigner English as a second language; be
patient and encouraging.
I’m the Leader! Follow Me!
When walking your dog, one of you leads, while the other follows.
Though you may not consider this scenario to be of consequence,
your dog does. From her perspective, the two of you constitute a
pack, a team, if you will. When you leave your home to explore life
beyond the den, there are untold possibilities. One of you simply
must be the decision-maker.
If you walk your dog on a leash, the restriction is immediately
noted. Your dog will choose to either trot at your side, trusting in
your authority, or she will strain forth, eager to give direction and
determined to break free of the asphyxiating restraint — a posture
that ensures an alertness to all distractions.

Part III: Doggie Delinquency 
172
If your dog has any protective instincts, your inattention will
convey a dependence on his leadership. In this role, he’ll react to
whatever sight he deems unsafe, whether real or imagined. Though
reactions run the spectrum from aggression to fear, all convey a
perceived sense of duty.
If your dog is allowed to run free and is known to roam, he’ll mark
strategic points as he wanders, claiming a territory that may be
quite large. On leash or off, he’ll alert to and/or address anyone
who enters this area. If he’s confined, he’ll still react to what he
considers incursions on his turf and noises and sights from his
enclosure. Common reactions to the stress of watching activities
from his confinement may include barking, destructive chewing,
digging, or marking.
Near-sighted and visually limited (see Chapter 4), the world looks
filtered and distant to your dog. He depends on his sense of smell
to recognize places. Though his olfactory recognition is a powerful
tool, it’s not comparable to our vision as a long-range interpreter.
Unfamiliar objects “appear” foreign and can’t be identified until
they’re thoroughly sniffed. When possible, let your dog smell an
unfamiliar item. Otherwise, teach him to follow you so that you’re
perceived as the social director. The only thing your dog really
needs to focus on is you!
The good news is that you can avoid many common frustrations
by teaching your dog to follow your lead, passively conveying your
role as your dog’s guardian and protector. As you work with him,
remember that he’s programmed to look to you for direction:
Use hand signals with your directions as often as possible (see
Figure 12-1).
Whoever is in front is in charge
The first ingredient necessary to train your dog involves improving
your attitude. Be the one to watch! If you act confidently, like a
respected coach with good ideas, your dog will admire you and
respond to your direction.
Whoever is in front is in charge. The first step in conditioning good
behavior is to ensure that, inside your home den and out, your dog
follows and looks for your direction.

Chapter 12: Happy Training, Happy Tails 173
Figure 12-1: Use hand signals with your directions.
The “Follow” command says, “I’m the leader follow me.” Initially
practice this form of direction in a low-distraction room or a quiet
outdoor area:
1. Place your dog on a leash and fitted collar.
See Chapter 10 to help you determine which leash and
collar are best for your dog.
2. Call out your dog’s name and the direction “Follow” as
you move about in a clockwise circle pattern.
If your dog tugs forward on the leash, either guide him
back using your leash or simply reverse your direction and
stride away, leaving the dog behind you at the end of his
leash and forcing him to recognize that he’s no longer in
front but now must run to catch up with you.

Part III: Doggie Delinquency 
174
3. Slap your leg periodically as a body signal and praise
and/or treat your dog to reward his cooperation.
When walking your dog, throw your shoulders back, stick
your chest out, and smile. If you poke along or putter, your
dog will be concerned and hesitate. Keep your pace lively
and consistent, and he’ll eagerly anticipate following your
direction.
4. Repeat the dog’s name “follow” periodically and praise
her cooperation.
5. As your dog alerts to this word cue, use it in increasingly
more distracting environments.
6. Continue to use treats or click-treat combinations to
encourage your dog’s cheerful cooperation.
For more on rewarding your dog and using a clicker, see
Chapter 10.
7. Once your dog is familiar with the “Follow” direction,
reinforce this skill on walks outside of your home 
and yard.
What “training” and “civility” 
have in common
Does the concept of training your dog seem like a downer — something you do to
him, rather than for or with him? Many people cringe at the thought of ordering their
dog about.
Though we fully understand your hesitation, we must speak up for your dog. Just
feeding, loving, and giving him shelter aren’t enough: He longs for the direction. Like
a child, he depends on you to civilize him and to teach him the best ways to act in
every situation. When you do so, you become his hero.
As a young dog, he’ll be unable to contain his impulses, but allowing unruly displays
isn’t kind. If you don’t train him to behave, he’ll become a brat. Your dog needs you to
teach him how to manage each feeling, emotion, or impulse as it arises. Replace the
word “training” with “civilizing” and then embrace your real responsibility to your
dog: teacher, friend, coach, and hero, your direction is his ticket to a wonderful life.
Ask yourself, which dog has the greater freedom — the one that has never been
trained and therefore must be left at home because his misbehaving is a problem,
or the one that has been well trained and can accompany you anywhere? A well-
trained dog is not only civilized, but he’s earned his freedom.

Chapter 12: Happy Training, Happy Tails 175
Encourage your dog to walk to one side and be consistent. Dogs
are as habitual as humans. Once they learn a walking position in
relationship to you, they’ll rarely vary. If you’re right-handed, walk
your dog on the left. Though it may seem awkward at first, it’s
better that your dog not get in the way when you’re manipulating
objects.
Permission training
When walking your dog, you may come to crosswalks, roadways,
or streams. Teach your dog to stop and look to you frequently for
permission before moving into new terrain. This exercise ensures
adequate containment skills and enforces a feeling of trust and 
protection. When your dog stops and waits for your permission,
you’re communicating your responsibility and that you’ll ensure
his safety before proceeding into new environments.
When you get to a thoroughfare, curb, or other passageway, get
your dog to stop moving by either telling him to “Sit” or “Wait.”
(If your dog is unfamiliar with these commands, see Chapter 4.)
Here are a few pointers to keep in mind about permission training:
 If your dog doesn’t sit or stand still, brace him as described in
Chapter 4.
 Be still until your dog is sitting or standing calmly.
 Say “okay” and proceed with confidence.
Meeting and greeting
As you progress to walking your dog in more distracting environ-
ments, you’re likely to encounter other pets, as well as human
admirers. Don’t let your dog drag you across the yard or road to
greet anyone. Not only is this unsafe behavior, it’s extremely rude
and could easily result in disaster.
A far better approach is to teach your dog to “Sit” or “Wait” for
your permission. Once forewarned, if the other party is willing, you
may release your dog with the direction “Okay.” This training is all
part of the dog learning to act only on your permission. To do it
effectively, you may need to teach your dog to harness his impulses
(see the next section).

Teaching Impulse Control
Keeping impulses in check is hard for anyone, and more so for
your dog who responds much like a young child. Expecting him to
ignore that squirrel in the front yard or that roast on your counter-
top is like asking a young child to ignore cookies just sitting out on
a tray in plain view. Expecting your dog to ignore a distraction, for
no other reason than your saying so, takes a high level of control
and an even higher level of respect for you. The three ingredients
that go into mastering impulse control are
 Maturity: Maturity is the result of both experience and biolog-
ical setting. A distraction becomes increasingly less enticing
the more often your dog experiences it. As your dog ages, psy-
chological and physiological changes will have a relaxing
effect on his personality as well.
 Your interaction: If you correct your dog when he’s reacting
to a distraction, he’ll think you’re supporting him or competing
for a prized item. Instead, focus on your surroundings, inter-
vene, or just distract him before your dog has taken matters
into his own hands.
 T & C: In professional circles, T & C stand for time and 
consistency, the two necessary ingredients to learn any skill.
The more you expose your dog to distractions, routinely pro-
viding the same direction and structure, the faster he’ll
become conditioned to events and react automatically.
Verbal discouragements
“No” must be taught as a direction, not a correction. Using “No” as
a punishment will only confuse your dog, who really doesn’t have
the mental or emotional capacity to understand the concept of
being bad. Even though he’s a relatively simple and spontaneous
creature, your dog can learn to harness specific impulses out of
trust in your direction and respect for your authority. Just like a
child can adapt to a set structure, so can your dog. To teach him
“No,” place him on a leash and rig a situation to prompt his inter-
est, such as placing a tissue on the floor or a tray of snacks on the
coffee table. As you approach the distraction, watch your dog’s
ears, nose, and/or eyes to determine his focus. The moment he
alerts to a distraction, lightly tug the leash and either slap your leg
or rap loudly on the wall (with your hand). Don’t interact with your
dog until he’s pulled away from the distraction and then redirect
him to a positive activity and praise him warmly.
Part III: Doggie Delinquency 
176

If you correct your dog in the midst of an action, he’s likely to
interpret your attention as interactive, not instructional. Instead,
set up situations that allow you to correct your dog the moment he
even considers a misdeed. If you’re too late, you’re far better off
saying nothing and simply containing your dog until such time as
your communication will make a lasting impression.
This may sound silly, but it works. If the thing that commonly dis-
tracts or attracts your dog is an inanimate object, such as a tissue or
a sandwich, slap and angrily admonish it by saying “Bad Sandwich!”
Don’t look at your dog. Following several repetitions, dogs often
come to avoid or look away from the punished object.
Here are a few other directions to offer:
 No! This direction must carry a tone of finality that your dog
will learn to respect. Use it very selectively for impulsive
actions that will endanger your dog or others.
 Don’t even think about it! If you catch your dog warily eyeing
or sniffing an item or activity, he’s considering it. Nip it in the
bud with a well-toned, growl-sounding utterance, “Don’t even
think about it!” If he’s unimpressed, back yourself up with a
firm leash tug and set up situations to allow practice of this
direction.
For example, once your dog has learned to avoid the counter-
tops, leave a sandwich close to the edge. Place a can full of
pennies just in front of the plate to facilitate your interference
should he ignore you. As you leave the room, look seriously at
your dog and instruct “Don’t even think about it.” If you hear
the can rustle, come back into the room swiftly.
If your dog hasn’t nabbed the sandwich, slap the table and
say “Bad Table,” and then direct your dog back to a bone or
bed. Repeat this process in two days and again until this
direction begins to make an impression.
If your dog is too quick and is enjoying his prize, let him have
it as you flip back a few paragraphs and review how to teach
the direction “No.”
An untrained dog often needs a leash tug to maintain control.
Think of a leash as an extension of your hand, which is always in
contact with your dog — which is the way your dog thinks of it!
The tug, however, should be gentle. It’s a reminder that you’re in
contact with him, and is a way of getting his attention; it’s not a
punishment.
Chapter 12: Happy Training, Happy Tails 177

In addition to general praise, teach your dog a specific word or
phrase, such as “Yes” or “Good dog,” to tell him that you’re pleased
and to reinforce his cooperation. In the early stages, follow each
“Yes” or “Good dog” with a treat or other reward. After a while, just
the sounds of the words will get a happy response from your dog,
and you can use the word as a reward, even if the dog is off leash
and some distance away.
Teaching the down
The direction “down” asks your dog to move into a vulnerable,
submissive pose. Initially, he may not be a big fan of this direction,
especially if he doesn’t think of you as the leader of his pack. Your
first job is to convey a sense of neutrality, so that your dog neither
fears the direction nor reacts defensively. As you practice, he’ll be
more cooperative in familiar, peaceful environments and around
distractions.
When teaching down, give the direction once. It is important to get
your dog used to responding to one-word commands. Also succes-
sively repeating any direction changes the command: “Down, down,
down” sounds different than the direction “Down.”
Start with the dog sitting beside you. If your dog is unfamiliar with
this direction, use lures to guide him into position. For example,
show him a treat and then move it from a position above his head
in a downward arc that ends a foot or so in front of the dog’s paws
at the level of the floor. As he lowers himself to the floor, say “Down”
as you release the prize. Don’t be concerned if he pops up immedi-
ately: You can teach the “Stay” command another time.
When your dog is routinely cooperating, hold the reward in your
other hand as you say “Down” and give him a hand signal that
looks like the motion you used to lure him down. If he doesn’t coop-
erate, you might physically correct him by using the pressure
point (between his shoulder blades), pause as you bring the treat
to his mouth, and then praise and reward him. Incrementally
increase the duration of the pause: When your dog is showing
signs of self-control, say “Stay” during the pause.
When you’re luring your dog into this position, slowly move 
the prize downward from your dog’s nose directly between his
front paws. Point training, as described in Chapter 10, is ideal for 
Part III: Doggie Delinquency 
178

signaling all your directions: Point as you lure and then continue to
use this signal as you faze off luring him.
 Straight back down: Once your dog is cooperating with
the preceding command, kneel next to him or sit at his side in
a low chair. Keep your back straight: Your goal is to direct him
from an upright posture. If you don’t eliminate your bending,
it will become a body cue necessary for his cooperation.
In this posture, don’t lower your hand to the floor, but signal
him by moving your hand in a short downward movement in
front of his face. If your dog stops moving when your hand
stops, use your free hand to press him into position gently.
 Standing down: Once you’ve completed the preceding com-
mand, gradually begin to direct your dog when you’re in a
standing pose. If necessary, bend at your knee or curtsy in
order to lower your body without bending your back. Use
“Stay” once your dog has lowered himself, sliding a leash
under your foot to anchor him if he fidgets, and repositioning
him until you release him with “Okay.”
 Distraction down: As you bring this direction into normal
everyday situations, you may notice that your dog is notably
less responsive. Although she may react immediately in the
quiet of your home, when distracted, this direction can take
on a whole new meaning. Loss of face, end of interaction, sub-
mission . . . your dog may look at you like you’ve never met.
Don’t be discouraged, and above all else, don’t repeat your-
self! By keeping a few treats in your pocket at all times, you
can turn any situation where the dog isn’t responding into a
training opportunity. Eventually, the dog learns that the same
commands have the same meanings and potential for rewards
in every situation.
Stay
This direction instructs your dog to stay put and contain his
impulses. In addition to enhancing his focusing skills, long-distance
stays can help to ease separation anxiety (see Chapter 14).
Chapter 12: Happy Training, Happy Tails 179

Part III: Doggie Delinquency 
180
It’s best to begin in a low-distraction environment where your dog
can concentrate on learning this skill:
1. Begin with your dog in a “Sit” position.
2. Turn around so that you’re in front of your dog with his
nose close to your knees.
3. Quickly flash an open palm signal in front of his face,
confidently tell him to “Stay.”
4. If he moves, tell him to “Sit” again, repeating the “Stay”
command and the hand signal.
In the beginning, you can expect him to hold his position only for a
few seconds. Later, you can stretch out the time and increase your
distance from him.
Keep your lessons short, upbeat, and fun to ensure your dog’s
interest and enthusiasm. Simplify each exercise, building your
dog’s confidence before proceeding to more difficult distractions
or long durations. If your dog routinely breaks the command, con-
sider whether you’re asking too much of him. Make the exercise
easier by making the stay times shorter, thus enabling his success
rather than setting him up for failure.
In addition to short, concentrated lessons, practice the “Stay” 
exercise with the dog at various distances from you throughout
the day.
Settle down
Use the “Stay” command for short periods where you want your
dog to hold a position and not move. If you want to have your dog
simply remain in a particular place, but don’t care much whether
he sits or lies down, and you intend to leave him for a relatively long
time, use the “Settle down” command. To teach this command:
1. Secure a short 3-foot leash in a familiar area, such as a
play station (see Chapter 3).
Place bedding and toys within reach.
2. Bring your dog to this area, directing him with a phrase,
such as “Go lie down.”
3. Secure the pre-attached leash to his regular collar or har-
ness, helping him to sit or lie down.

4. Instruct him to “Settle down” (see Chapter 4).
If your dog is nervous, stay close by him until he seems
more settled. Walk about the room or relax nearby. Don’t
pay attention to him if he whines or barks in protest,
though you may praise him when he’s chewing a toy or
resting calmly.
5. Once your dog is comfortable with this routine, instruct
him to “Settle down” and leave the room for gradually
increasing periods of time (not to exceed 30 minutes).
If he protests wildly, watch him in order to prevent injury
or household destruction. Then continue practicing until
he’s more comfortable settling down with you in the room.
If your dog seems agitated upon your return, don’t look at
or address him until he’s calmed down. Remember, you
reinforce whatever you pay attention to. Concentrate your
attention on your dog only when he is calm. He’ll quickly
learn to accept your departures or chew his bone, which is
an appropriate activity to relieve anxiety.
Reconnection
Your dog’s response to the command “Come,” or to any command
when he is off leash, depends upon his desire to be near you.
This pack mentality stems from a dog’s social instinct to reconnect
with and look to others before acting. Provided your dog respects
your direction, and has confidence in your control, he will respond.
Taught in an upbeat, fun manner, the following instructions will
ensure that the direction “Come” will be one your dog’s favorites.
The indispensable “Come”
Being able to bring your dog to you when he’s at a distance is one
of the most vital things that you must teach him. It can save his life
if he’s moving toward a dangerous place or situation. If he doesn’t
respond to your call, your dog really can’t be considered to be
under control.
Psychologically, however, responding to your “Come” command
isn’t easy. Consider what you’re asking your dog to do when you
ask him to come. You demand that he curtail his activities instantly.
Then he’s suppose to drop everything and race over to you full
Chapter 12: Happy Training, Happy Tails 181

Part III: Doggie Delinquency 
182
throttle — a wholly unnatural behavior whether you’re dog or
human. If that weren’t enough, your dog is then supposed to gauge
his speed and do a perfect four-point stop at your feet. And then,
well maybe you’ll offer him praise or a little treat. It takes a lot of
effort and self-control for a dog to respond, especially if your dog is
young or untrained.
Try this little “Come” exercise on your significant other. Wait until
he’s fully engrossed in a pleasurable activity, such as golfing, read-
ing, or watching the television. Call out his name. Does he look up?
Regardless, ask him to come with you. Any luck? Unlikely!
If you habitually use this term to call the dog to you when you
want to punish or scold him, then don’t be surprised if he doesn’t
respond or even turns and runs.
To teach or reteach this direction, divide “Come” into three parts,
working on each part separately before uniting the entire exercise:
1. Encourage your dog to cheerfully alert to his name.
Call his name as you shake a treat cup, wave a toy, or use
your clicker (Chapter 10). Call his name in an inviting
manner to encourage his enthusiasm. Avoid using your
dog’s name if you’re preparing to isolate or groom him.
“Come” should always invite generous tail wagging.
2. To teach your dog that “Come” means togetherness, not
separation, use this direction whenever you’re physically
interacting or rewarding him.
Suddenly, “Come” becomes a welcome command, rather
than an uncertain one.
3. Now use the word “Come” to bring the dog with you from
a distance.
Begin calling him on leash from short distances. Call your
dog’s name, cheering him on when he responds to you, or
pat your legs or back away to encourage him to move and
then praise him or give him a treat when he responds.
“Come” should be your dog’s favorite direction. Don’t call your dog
every other second. If you default to “Come” as a means of control-
ling or curtailing your dog’s every move, he won’t like it. Come
must be a welcome invitation to reconnect.
When your dog is running at you from a distance, use the human
exclamation point (arms enthusiastically thrown up in the air), the
praise words “Yes” or “Good dog” or a quick clap of your hands to
signal your delight.

Off-leash control
The goal of off lead training is that your dog responds to you with a
higher priority than he gives to anything else. Dog owners often
desire off-leash long before a dog is mature or fully capable of con-
taining his impulses. This level of control requires a comfortable
response to all directions, including “No,” which, when used appro-
priately, can arrest an instinct to chase or explore. As you practice
your distance skill, use an extendible leash or long line to restrict
your dog’s freedom to roam while you work on your greater dis-
tance control.
Please don’t allow your dog off leash near civilization. Even a well-
trained dog can lose focus and dart off impulsively, racing into a
street and putting himself in danger or frightening children or
others who don’t know him.
As your dog learns to take direction, he’ll become more focused
and fully entwined with your daily interactions. He’ll grow increas-
ingly aware of your moods and what distracts you. Your dog may
note that you don’t follow through with your directions when 
company visits, or that off leash you don’t have the same level
of control.
If your goal is to have a responsive, off-leash dog, pay close atten-
tion to your behavior. When practicing your long-range skills, be
mindfully aware to only ask your dog to do something when you
can follow through, when you’re sure that he’ll respond correctly,
or when you’re able to enforce your command.
Chapter 12: Happy Training, Happy Tails 183
How to make this lesson fun
Steer clear of making “Come” a serious direction. The more your dog views this
direction as fun, the more you’ll guarantee his quick response when it matters most.
Use it throughout the day when you’re playing with or treating your dog.
Run away come game: Place your dog on a drag leash (Chapter 10) inside or out.
When you have his attention, run away from him as you say “Come.” Vary the dis-
tance of the chase, kneel down, and give him a treat and a pat.
Hide and seek: You can play this one-on-one or with a partner. With treat cup in
hand, wait for your dog to be distracted and then hide behind a tree or sofa. Call
your dog’s name and shake the cup, ducking out if you sense your dog is confused.
When he finds you, say “Come” and reward him.

The first three things to work on are your dog’s name, “Wait” and
“okay,” and “Let’s go”:
 Name: A dog’s name should really mean “Look at me. The next
sound that comes out of my mouth is an instruction for you.”
It should precede any command. Thus “Lassie, sit” or “Lassie,
down” is proper grammar when talking to your dog, while
“Sit, Lassie” isn’t because the dog will be looking at you and
waiting for a command that has already disappeared into the
ether.
A quick check-in is all you’re looking for here — the human
equivalent of looking up from an activity when your name is
called. When your dog looks to you, give him a cheer. If he
continues by coming to you, you may offer a treat, although
you don’t require this response. If your dog ignores you, leash
him and issue a light tug, or step close to him and touch him
to attract his attention or even hold the leash and step off in
the opposite direction. Ignoring your calling his name isn’t an
option.
 Wait and okay: This duo of commands instructs your dog to
stop in his tracks. A sudden freeze in motion is your goal.
Vary the time he must remain still before releasing him with
“Okay!”
 Let’s go!: This direction is slightly looser than “Follow,” which
instructs your dog to walk by your left side. “Let’s go!” doesn’t
direct your dog to your side per se, but does encourage him
to follow you. Use it whenever you’re changing directions. If
your dog is unresponsive, simply leave him on lead and give
him a light reminder tug; like other directions, not following
you is not an option.
Remember the direction “Come” is a three-part exercise. If you call
out your dog’s name and he ignores you, he’s unlikely to respond to
“Come.” Should he ignore your call, give a light tug on his leash and
repeat his name. Once you have his attention, say “Yes” or “Good”
and then call “Come” as you either kneel down or run backward to
encourage his cooperation. If your dog races over but doesn’t slow
down to reconnect with you, whip a treat out of your pocket and
show it to him to lure him in. After all, “Come” is supposed to mean
“We’re together, and when we are, good things happen to obedient
puppies!”

Misbehave:
Misperceptions 
and Solutions

In this part . . .
T
hough a dog’s misbehavior can be frustrating at times,
when you boil it down, it is often a sign of restlessness,
discomfort, or a need for attention. Most often it is a reac-
tion to a breakdown in communication between the dog and
his owner or the lack of leadership or an organized family.
In this part, you get insight into your dog’s perspective: 
not only why he does what he does, but what he’s trying to
communicate when he does it. Through this understanding,
you discover appropriate ways to extinguishing the “bad”
behavior, while simultaneously encouraging more appropri-
ate ways for your dog to communicate his frustrations. In
addition, you get the tools to cope with the set of anxiety-
related and aggressive behaviors that are most likely to
damage the relationship between you and your dog.

P
roblem behavior is a very subjective thing. Of course, chew-
ing on the carpet is a universal issue, as is housesoiling, but
many people enjoy a lively, spirited dog jumping on them when
they come home and don’t mind a few unearthed holes in the front
yard. In this chapter, we put a few common frustrations under the
microscope, looking at each from your dog’s perspective and offer-
ing simple straightforward remedies if, in fact, you’re seeking one.
Personal Philosophy and 
the Problem Dog
Consider two 4-month-old Cairn terriers who have started to do
what growing terriers normally do — namely bark at every sound
near your door, your window, your front walk, your street, your
city. Remember, terriers are born to bark (see Chapter 6). Whether
any given behavior that a dog displays is a problem is a matter of
psychology — not psychology of the dog, but rather the psychologi-
cal reactions of the people who live with and interact with that dog.
Sonya Brown is a young woman working her way up in an advertis-
ing firm. She has been living with one of these terriers, Toto, for
nearly eight weeks, and she’s beginning to think that purchasing
this lively puppy was a major mistake. She wanted a playful and

affectionate dog, and Toto is certainly that. However, the dog’s con-
tinuous barking is becoming very annoying. Toto barks at every-
one and everything, and it seems to her that she can no longer
have a phone conversation with friends or business associates
without being interrupted by her noisy dog.
Compare this to Sibyl White, a school teacher, who bought Toto’s
littermate. This pup, Ozzie, was supposed to keep her semi-invalid
mother company, especially while Sibyl was at work. Sibyl’s mother,
Edith, was always a timid woman, and she became anxious about
moving to the city to be with her daughter after her husband died
and her health became worse. Edith had heard stories about how
urban gang members and hardened thieves would break into homes
that they thought were unoccupied or easy marks and often injure
any occupants that they found. For this elderly woman, Ozzie’s
alertness and noise were a great comfort, and, when not on alert,
he would provide her with another form of comfort by resting
close to her and allowing himself to be petted. Edith showed Sibyl
an article that said that the likelihood that a home would suffer a
break-in was massively reduced by simply having a dog that barked
inside — regardless of the size of the dog. Sibyl could not remem-
ber her mother feeling this secure since she had moved to the city.
With each outburst of barking, Edith would say, “Ozzie’s just doing
his job. He’s letting them know that this house is protected.”

188
When mechanics conquers psychology
Many times a mechanical solution is better than a behavioral solution, so it always
helps to look at the possibility of changing the environment rather than the dog.
Consider the following quick mechanical solutions to common dog behavior problems:
 The dog gets into kitchen cabinets: Solved by childproof locks on cabinet doors.
 The dog races out the door when it’s opened: Solved by slipping the leash on
the dog before opening the door.
 The dog chews shoes: Solved by keeping shoes you’re not wearing in the closet.
 The dog cruises the counter for food: Solved by keeping the dog out of the kitchen
when you’re not present or putting food away rather than leaving it on the counter.
(If the dog tries to get food from the counter when you’re present, a sharp “No!”
reinforced with a loud sound, like a pot hitting the floor, usually works.)
 The dog jumps on the bed and tries to sleep with people: Solved by closing the
bedroom door or putting the dog in a kennel beside the bed.
None of these solutions require a Harvard degree. Look around and see whether you
can change the environment to quickly eliminate the unwanted behavior, and you
may be able to save lots of training time or the cost of hiring an animal behaviorist.

Both dogs are exhibiting the same behaviors. However, Sonya con-
siders the behavior a problem while Sibyl feels that she has the
perfect dog for her situation. The issue isn’t just what the dogs are
doing, but more importantly, it’s how the dogs’ owners interpret
and respond to the behavior.
No matter what kind of behavior problem your dog has, the
options open to you are the same ones available to everyone:
 Live with the behavior. Obviously, if the behavior isn’t both-
ering you, as in the case of Sibyl and her mother, you don’t
have a problem, and life can go on undisturbed. If the problem
bothers you a little, then you can reorganize yourself and your
environment to eliminate the immediate annoying effect of the
behavior and be satisfied with that. Thus, if Sonya normally
talks on the phone in the kitchen where Toto barks at the
kitchen window, she can simply walk into the living room.
 Let the dog continue the behavior, but change how you
feel about it. Changing a person’s attitudes and emotional
responses to a dog’s behaviors is sometimes easier than you
may imagine. For example, Sonya is a woman living alone.
Perhaps if she were shown that article about how a barking
dog reduces the rate of burglary and home invasions, then
she might come to be comforted at the sound of Toto’s pro-
tective barking.
In our casebook, we have an example of changing attitudes
toward a dog’s behavior involving a woman named Sharon
and her manic retriever. Sharon’s pet was a Labrador
Retriever named Magnet who, like all Labs, was extremely
sociable and loved to retrieve. Magnet would drive Sharon
crazy by picking up anything that he found on the floor and
carrying it to her. Plush toys, stray slippers, socks, and maga-
zines all ended up being offered to her. Then one day Magnet
showed up with a pair of glasses that Sharon’s daughter had
dropped, and another day he appeared with the car keys that
she had been frantically looking for. It was then that Sharon
realized that perhaps this behavior was not all bad. She has
now even turned Magnet’s retrieving behavior into a game.
She’ll walk into a room and happily call, “Magnet, find stuff!”
and the dog scours the floor for anything laying around. It helps
her keep the house neat, recover lost items, and redefine her
dog’s behavior so that it’s no longer a problem but rather
simply something that her dog does.
 Don’t change the dog’s behavior, but change the environment
so that the behavior is limited, blocked, or is no longer seen
as a problem. Many people, when confronted with a behavior
problem, tend to focus too much on the behavior. Consider
the story of Kevin and Noodles.
Chapter 13: Addressing and Solving Problem Behavior 189

Kevin shared his life with a lovely, though garbage-obsessed,
collie, aptly named Noodles. In every regard, Kevin loved his
dog, though he was plagued by the frustration of her garbage
escapades each morning when he left to run errands. No matter
how long he’d be out, he’d come home to find the kitchen
floor strewn with refuse. Though he had attempted every
remedy from yelling at her to dragging her over to the scene
and hitting her, nothing worked.
However, the real solution was easy and obvious, once Kevin
was convinced to look at his own involvement in this cycle.
Because Kevin’s reaction frightened Noodles, she grew more
nervous as he got ready to leave. Equipped with more appropri-
ate toys like chews and treat cubes, Kevin was also encouraged
to take one simple step that cured the issue in one instant.
He purchased a garbage can with a latched lid.
 Change the dog’s behaviors so that they match what you
believe to be appropriate. Actually, this approach is the psy-
chological or training option that most people immediately
think about. The rest of this chapter focuses on solutions of
this sort; however, note that you have to make certain choices
when you decide to change the dog’s behaviors:
• How much time do you want to spend? Often, completely
changing a dog’s behavior can be time consuming or
involve an expensive dog trainer.
• How drastically do you want the behavior changed?
Often, a small amount of training can greatly reduce, but
not completely eliminate, a dog’s problem behavior.
Suppose that your dog is messing in the house every day —
obviously a problem. Do you require that your dog never,
ever eliminate in the house again, or can you put up with one
accident every month or so? The first solution may be very
laborious and time consuming, while the second may be
accomplished quite quickly. Of course, adopting the second
alternative may require that you also have to change your atti-
tudes a bit to accept an occasional transgression by your pet.
 Get rid of the dog. Your original reason to get your dog was
to improve your life and give your dog a good home. If neither
is the case — your life quality is not great and your home is
less than ideal for a dog’s lifestyle — then it’s time to rethink
matters. If you’re unwilling to cope with problem behaviors,
to take the time to modify them, or to change your attitude to
accommodate such a situation, then everyone may be better
off if you found your dog a different household that will appre-
ciate all her special qualities. It’s a difficult choice to make,
but please keep your family’s and your dog’s interests and
happiness at heart.

It may well be that you got the wrong breed of dog for your needs
and living conditions (such as Sonya who may be better off with a
breed of dog that seldom barks), or, sadly, you may be at a time
and place in your life where you’re better off without a dog.
Denning Your Dog
Having an enclosed area, such as a crate, sectioned off playpen or
room, or stationed corner (see Chapter 4 ), is useful as it provides
your dog with a sense of security and comfort in your home. Your
dog’s wild cousins lived in a den, either a hollow area (enclosed on
all sides except one), cave, or a deliberately dug-out hole. This den
provided comfort and security, and was a safe place to go when its
occupants chose to be undisturbed. Inside your home, the crate or
small-secluded area is simply a substitute for the den.
Crates come in several materials and sizes, as do playpens. Whether
you purchase or manufacture a den, or choose to enclose your dog
in a small gated room, the area should be large enough in which to
stand, turn around, and lie with outstretched paws. Place a soft bed-
ding material in this area, provided your dog doesn’t chew or soil it.
Although the crate (such as those shown in Figure 13-1) may look
like a cage to a human, most dogs actually like them. Locate your
crate in a familiar room, ideally placing it at your bedside at night
and in a populated room during the day.
Figure 13-1: Typical kennel crates. Drape a sheet over three sides of wire crates
to give it a denlike feeling.
The fastest way to encourage your puppy into his kennel is with
food lures and a reward system. Once all hesitation is gone, direct
your dog with a verbal cue, such as “In your house.” If you’re
teaching an older dog, gradually increase the amount of time she’s
Chapter 13: Addressing and Solving Problem Behavior 191

expected to stay. Initially shut the crate door for just a minute or
two and reward her for her accomplishment. Next, close the door
and try leaving the room for a few moments. Return, give her a
treat, and let her out. Then gradually increase the time away from
your pet.
If your new puppy or dog is whining in the crate at night, deter-
mine whether anything is wrong or if she’s in physical discomfort.
(Puppies under 12 weeks should be taken out in the middle of the
night if they whine.) If nothing is wrong, ignore your dog because
your attempts at comforting provide attention, which is rewarding
to the dog, and thus the whining will become a habit.
Silencing Excessive Barking
Rewind to ancestral times, and you’ll quickly note that a dog’s
barking was one of the chief assets of the canine/human union.
More vocal alert than a wolf who howls at night, a dog’s bark pro-
vided warning to our primitive ancestors.
Though dogs still bark out their alarm or warning, few people
appreciate the depth of their skill and devotion to this task.
Furthermore, dogs that bark continuously at night, in their yard,
in an empty home or apartment, at every dog or person that they
see, and so on are considered a nuisance and often bring unwanted
attention from the community and even fines for breaking anti-noise
bylaws. This situation may pose a problem for the ever-eager, con-
stantly vigil, and slightly bored dog of our modern era.
Every dog behaviorist’s casebook is filled with complaints that
go something like this: “My dog barks at every little thing, even
when I’m at home. She stands at the door or window and barks.
I tell her to stop, I shout at her to be quiet, but nothing stops her.
I think my trying to correct her may even be making her barking
worse!”
Dogs bark as part of defending their territory, so it’s quite natural
for a dog to bark more when he’s at home than when he’s away
from home. It is important to understand what is triggering the
barking response and what the dog is trying to tell you.
Barking is an alarm sound (see Chapter 3). There is no threat of
aggression signaled by the dog unless it’s mixed with growls.
The most common bark heard around the house involves rapid
strings of two to four barks with pauses between each set, sound-
ing something like “Woof-woof . . . Woof-woof-woof . . . Woof-woof.”
You can translate this classic alarm bark as, “Call the pack.

Something is going on that should be looked into.” It indicates that
the dog senses something nearing or outside the home and is
trying to bring it to the attention of his pack and pack leader. The
problem is that most people fail to recognize that the dog is trying
to communicate to them and that what’s required is an answer.
Because the dog is being noisy, they usually try to silence their pet
by shouting, “Be quiet,” “Stop that noise,” “Shut up!” This response
is exactly the wrong one because the dog interprets your yelling as
“Woof-woof . . . Woof-woof-woof . . . Woof-woof.” Instead of reassur-
ing him, your involvement now confirms that you feel the same
way that he does, so don’t be surprised that your dog feels he’s
done the right thing and continues to bark — perhaps even louder.
After all, you’re encouraging it!
The appropriate way to stop his barking is to recognize that his
noise is really a signal with a specific meaning. He wants you to
investigate something. A more appropriate response is to look out
the window or check the door where he’s barking. Then calmly tell
him, “Good guarding,” give him a pat, and call him back over to you
when you sit down again. He’ll interpret this sequence as, “I asked
the leader of the pack to check things out, and my leader sees no
problem. Therefore, I don’t need to continue barking.” Eventually,
“good guarding” will quiet him and bring him to your side.
Notice that this solution doesn’t prevent barking. It’s normal for your
dog to bark at animals and people that come onto your property or
approach your door. Many cities have gone so far as to define this
type of barking as “reasonable” when they’ve drafted laws con-
cerning nuisance barking. You don’t want to completely eliminate
the barking because it serves the useful purpose of alerting you to
someone’s presence. However, you do want to stop it quickly and
keep it under control, and communication is the way to do so.
Dogs that bark at neighbors
When your dog barks at a neighbor, he’s protecting his territory.
Although his protection is warranted, the neighbors are there to stay,
so it is better for everyone if you resolve this daily confrontation.
The trick is to arrange things so that the neighbors are no longer
seen as trespassing marauders. Follow this simple three-step
process:
1. Introduce your dog to the neighbors on common or neu-
tral ground, such as the area between the two properties.
Let the dog make the first move to sniff or greet your neigh-
bor, who should stand still and not stare or reach until
Chapter 13: Addressing and Solving Problem Behavior 193

the dog has settled down. If your dog is fearful or overly
aggressive, handle him on a leash and bribe his acceptance
of them with a treat or toy. If he doesn’t relax, seek profes-
sional help. Don’t force him onto anyone, or he may react
in self-defense.
2. Have the neighbors come into your yard and stay for a bit.
Be sure that they interact with your dog. Have them use his
name, call him a few times, offer him treats, play a bit of
fetch, and so on.
3. Have the neighbors return to their own yard with some
of the treats that you have provided and then have them
approach the fence.
They should talk happily to the dog, use its name, and offer
him a treat through the fence. If it is a solid fence, any
crack or knothole will do.
Remind the neighbors that if your dog does bark at them again, they
should just use her name and approach the fence to say “Hello.”
Remember, the dog usually only barks to warn of strangers, and
now the neighbors should no longer fit into this category.
Excessive barking in the yard
Many dogs bark when left alone outside. Though barking can drive
everyone to distraction, the typical approach of screaming rarely
has the desired effect. The solution lies in examining why this bark-
ing occurs in the first place.
First recognize that dogs are social animals and are most comfort-
able and happy when they’re in the presence of others, whether
people or other dogs. Second, consider your home as your dog’s
den. Isolated from entry, your dog is frustrated, lonely, and bored,
which can easily escalate to fear and insecurity if the surrounding
environment is noisy or unpredictable.
The solution to this kind of barking is simple: Limit your dog’s out-
door isolation and bring the dog inside the house. Even if your
schedule leaves him alone, you can enclose him in a crate or room
and be assured that he’ll be much happier surrounded by sights
and smells that are associated with his family.
If your dog does bark when you’re away, remember that a barking
dog in a home reduces the rate of burglary to one-seventh of the
normal rate. A barking dog can be quite useful because he’s now
protecting your home!

Other nuisance barking
Dogs that love to bark — at moving objects, noises, and sights —
and those who seem to bark just for the fun of it are the hardest
group to quiet. The first step in controlling the persistent noise is
to help bring attention to the sounds they’re making. Like chatty
children, their motto may be, “I bark, therefore I am.”
The most clever and quickest way to turn off unwanted barking is
to teach the dog to bark on command! One simple way to do so is
to follow this training routine:
1. Place your dog on leash and attach the leash to a fence or
other stationary object.
2. Stand a few feet away and tease him with a toy; when the
dog gets excited and/or frustrated and starts to bark,
immediately give the direction “Speak” and then give the
toy as a reward.
3. When the dog is consistently barking to the word
“Speak” with the toy as a reward, switch the reward —
first to a treat and later to a verbal praise.
4. At the end of a barking tirade, say “Quiet” and then
reward him; after your dog recognizes “Quiet,” move a
short distance away.
Learning this step may take several repetitions. Be patient.
5. When your dog responds appropriately to your com-
mands, return to give the reward.
Eventually, you can move farther away and change to
verbal rewards.
6. Finally, with a pocket full of treats, take the dog out to 
situations where he normally barks; each time he begins
to bark, vary the duration he’s allowed to sound off
before instructing “Quiet.” Reward his cooperation
immediately.
You can use the “Quiet” command as an off switch to stop most
barking when you’re present. However, the length of time that the
dog stays quiet will depend upon what you do next. Distracting the
dog with play, attention, or a brief training session can help keep
him focused on you rather than the bark-inducing situation.
Eventually, his silence will evolve into longer periods of silence
and greater self-control on the part of your pet.
Chapter 13: Addressing and Solving Problem Behavior 195

Barking in the car
Dogs often turn into frantic barkers when left alone in the car due
to two factors:
 A dog’s natural instinct when something startles or frightens
them is to run away, which can’t happen while riding in a car.
Barking is an attempt to call his pack mates back for help.
 The car becomes the limits of their territory, and its compact
area must be vigorously defended. Because no help is arriv-
ing, the barking may change to a combination of warning and
threats. When the object that worried him, such as a person
walking by, moves away, it rewards your dog and makes it
more likely that he’ll bark again in a similar situation.
Manic behavior in the car can be annoying and frighten passing
pedestrians. If the car is moving, the dog noisily ricocheting around
the interior can distract the driver and even lead to accidents.
The simplest solution to this problem actually takes less time
to present than it takes to describe the behavior problem itself.
This is the perfect place to use the dog’s kennel crate. If you have a
hatchback car, van, or station wagon, just pop the kennel crate in
the back. If you have a sedan and a small- to medium-sized dog,
you can put the kennel crate on the back seat and secure it from
moving during sudden stops by using a strap or the seatbelts. Now
all that you need to do is to put the dog into the crate with a treat
and a chew toy. The kennel walls will screen many of the exciting
sights from view, which helps some dogs. However, the major ben-
efit is that the dog understands that the crate is his den, and he’s
always safe, secure, and undisturbed in his den. With no threats or
anxiety, he has no need to bark, and the problem is solved.
Chewing
Chewing is as natural to dogs as touching is to kids and people.
To recognize your dog’s motivation in chewing, consider his age,
as well as outside disturbances that often trigger the chewing in
adult dogs:
 Curiosity: Very young puppies (up to 12 weeks) mouth to expe-
rience new objects, much as young babies want to touch and
hold anything within reach. The best approach is to puppy-
proof your home, clearing shelves and anything else within
Part IV: Dogs Don’t Misbehave: Misperceptions and Solutions 
196

your puppy’s grasp. If he gets an object, calmly remove it and
replace it with an appropriate item, such as a treat or chew
toy. Don’t issue even a verbal admonishment at this age. It will
make no sense and create friction in your household; it’s like
yelling at a 6-month-old baby for pulling your hair.
 Teething: Young puppies do teethe, just like children. Their
“milk teeth” (or first set of choppers) are displaced by the
arrival of their permanent set, causing itching, pain, and
sometimes bleeding. This is usually about the time your
puppy may start chewing the furnishings or molding. Frankly,
this reaction makes perfect sense: If he can’t locate a toy
immediately, at least he always knows the whereabouts of a
table leg or wall. Regardless, you need to arrange areas for
your dog in each room, equipping each spot with desirable
chew toys (and tying them down so they’re not carried off). In
addition, spray your items at risk with a distasteful solution.
The teething stage is also the time when many dogs learn
the artful game of grab-and-go, and who can blame them?
It’s fun and exciting to grab an object and entice you to chase
after him for it. Because the behavior is primarily attention-
getting, the best response is to simply walk away or leave
your home for three minutes. At another time, prompt your
dog’s interest by placing the object nearby and walking him
toward it on leash. The moment he shows interest in it, tug
the leash back and say, “No.” Then direct your dog to a more
appropriate activity.
We often liken excessive chewing in adult dogs to an adolescent
acting out: The behavior itself represents a deeper unrest, and the
worst thing you can do is scold your dog after the fact. To address
this issue, you must first determine whether the behavior is age-
appropriate; if not, ask yourself what environmental disturbances
or changes in your relationship may have prompted this restless
behavior. If chewing has evolved recently, consider whether it’s
occurring due to boredom, frustration/anxiety, or attention seeking.
(We cover alternatives to these situations in Chapters 14 and 15.)
Putting a Damper on Jumping
In movies and cartoons, it may be funny when the big dog heads
directly to the woman in white clothes, jumps up to greet her, knocks
her down, and leaves muddy footprints on her dress. In real life,
however, this behavior is rarely welcomed. How you stop it depends
on what’s prompting your dog to jump up in the first place.
Chapter 13: Addressing and Solving Problem Behavior 197

Your dog may have many reasons for jumping up. If jumping
occurs during greeting rituals, his intention is to make contact
with your face.
Because attention (negative or positive) reinforces behavior, many
people unintentionally reward jumping. Any reaction that involves
touching is considered interaction. Do you find yourself pushing or
grabbing your dog’s coat as he leaps about? You may be encourag-
ing this behavior.
Some training books suggest harsh measures, such as kneeing the
dog in the chest when he jumps on you. Such methods don’t work
very well, and even when they do, they only stop the dog from
jumping on the person who punishes him for it.
Greeting jumping
It’s important that you praise your dog for sitting instead of jump-
ing. However, it’s equally important that the dog be completely
ignored when jumping. Don’t say, “Bad dog” or “No” because that
means that you’re paying attention to him, and attention is reward-
ing. Don’t push the dog away because touch is rewarding. Simply
act as if the dog isn’t there, except when you’re telling the dog to
sit. When the dog does sit, lots of attention and rewards are the
result.
Part IV: Dogs Don’t Misbehave: Misperceptions and Solutions 
198
Competing behaviors
To stop a dog’s annoying jumping, all that you need to do is to find a “competing
behavior” that is incompatible with the act of jumping. In dogs, the easiest com-
peting behavior for jumping and a variety of other active behaviors is to have the dog
sit. One reason why it’s easy is because most people have already taught their dog
to sit when given a verbal command or a hand signal. Obviously, if the dog is sitting,
he can’t be jumping at the same time.
To get rid of jumping behaviors as a greeting, simply tell the dog to “Sit” when you
walk in the door or greet the dog in the morning. Praising, petting, or offering a bit
of a treat serves as a reward.
Another example of a competing behavior is when dogs jump onto the furniture.
They’re seeking a soft comfortable place to rest, so providing a dog bed or floor
cushion in the same room is the solution. The dog must be shown this alternative
and placed there if he jumps on the sofa. Obviously, the dog can’t rest on the sofa
and his bed simultaneously!

If ignoring your dog is ineffective, fold your arms over you face
and continue to ignore him until he’s stopped and calmed down.
Redirect him to sit or to fetch a toy.
Company jumping
If your dog is jumping on other people and you’re present, the
solution is simple — just tell your dog to sit before he jumps,
reward him, and then allow your visitor to pet him or give him a
treat for sitting politely. If he’s too rambunctious, keep him on a
leash, either stepping on it to prevent interference, holding it, or
tying him back away from the door until he’s calmed down.
Of course, that approach doesn’t work when you’re not around and
your visitors don’t know that they must give the “Sit” command to
prevent being jumped on. There is an easy solution, however.
Most people train their dog to sit when they say the word or give a
hand signal. What you must do is train the dog to sit to an additional
hand signal that can be used during the greeting rituals. In this
case, the hand signal that you want to use is to have both hands
flat, palms up, facing the dog, as shown in Figure 13-2.
Figure 13-2: Hand signal for “Sit” to reduce jumping behavior.
Chapter 13: Addressing and Solving Problem Behavior 199

To train the dog to respond to this hand signal is easy. Stand in
front of the dog, say “Sit” (which he already understands), and give
the hand signal. Give him a treat when he responds. Once he gets
used to seeing the hand signal along with the verbal command, try
just the hand signal and see whether he’s figured it out. If not, keep
practicing using both the hand and voice commands. When the
dog understands that when both hands go up, he’s supposed to sit,
you’re then ready for the dog to meet strangers, even when you’re
not present.
The reason that this new hand signal prevents jumping is that it’s
the same as the defensive motion that most people make to pro-
tect themselves when they’re afraid that something (like a large
dog) is about to collide with them. So your visitor sees your dog
approaching and makes automatic defensive hand movements
(with no need of instructions from you). Your well-trained dog
interprets this as a “Sit!” command, and the problem is solved.
Remember, a sitting dog is not jumping up.
Housetraining
Though several scientific studies show housetraining to be the No.
1 frustration of dog owners, it doesn’t take a pie chart or graph to
convince you that a dog that is not housebroken isn’t any fun.
If you’re still struggling in this area, help lies just ahead.
If your puppy is young and is used to sleeping in his kennel, your
efforts will be straightforward, as he’ll instinctively avoid messing
in it. One of the first lessons the puppy learns from his house-
proud mother is the need to be clean in the sleeping area, which
she teaches by consuming all the waste that the pups produce.
Every facet of your dog’s behavior draws on his evolution. Before
domestication, birth dens were kept clean to remove the scent of
droppings that could lead a predator to a young litter of defense-
less pups.
If your puppy is eliminating in his kennel crate, it may simply be
too large. A large crate allows the pup to eliminate at one end and
rest in the other. The goal is, of course, for your puppy to build
control and not go until he’s released from this confinement. If you
purchased an adult-sized crate, purchase or fashion a barrier to
limit your puppy’s free space. Inserting a cardboard box of the
right size to leave room only for the pup to turn around and lie
down is an easy solution.

The housetraining routine
Routine is a key feature of housetraining. Draw up a master sched-
ule and insist that everyone take part in ensuring adherence.
Schedule feeding times, toilet breaks, and organized play periods.
Here’s a quick list of tips:
 Young puppies and untrained dogs need to go outside after
napping or after being crated for a while, because increases
in activity after a period of quiet often trigger elimination.
This means that the first thing in the morning, immediately
after you take him out of the crate, he has to get a chance to
eliminate. After a long night, puppies often can’t even make it
to the door before they have to go, so you may have to carry
him to the door for a week or so.
 A young puppy hasn’t developed strong bladder muscles and
must be taken out frequently, particularly after eating, drink-
ing, play, resting, and isolation. A young puppy (6 to 14 weeks
of age) may benefit from being taken out eight or more times
a day. This number will gradually reduce over the next six
months.
 If your dog is eliminating very frequently, he may have an
internal infection or parasites. Speak to your veterinarian
immediately.
Chapter 13: Addressing and Solving Problem Behavior 201
Bathroom buddies
Experienced dog owners will tell you that it is a lot easier to housetrain a puppy if
you already have a housetrained dog in the home who knows the routine. The trick
is to let both the older dog and the pup out at the same time or take them on their
walks together. The puppy watches the adult dog and, from simple observation,
learns what is expected of him.
This advice leads to an obvious recommendation. If you have an older dog in the
house and fear that he is nearing the end of his life, it may be helpful to bring a new
pup into your home before the older one dies. This early arrival gives the puppy a
chance to be mentored in house cleanliness and other basic skills by the already
trained senior dog. A side benefit is that having a new pup in the family often improves
the quality of life and the activity level of the older dog and may even extend his life.
To insure you choose a puppy who is compatible with your older dog, please refer
to Chapter 5. A dominant puppy can emotionally undo a peace-loving senior.

 Bring your dog to the same area to relieve himself. You may
highlight this area with pine chips or designate a specific
tree or outcropping. Have a fenced-in yard? Until your pup is
housetrained, you’ll still need to accompany him to encourage
and reinforce his habits.
 Don’t confuse your goals. When you take your dog out to
potty, bring him to his area and ignore him until he does 
his business. Don’t give him walk time or play time until 
afterward.
 Teach your dog word cues and routines to highlight your par-
ticipation, such as ringing a bell or barking before you go out.
Say, “Outside” or “Papers” as you escort your dog to his area.
Then cue him with another phrase, such as “Be quick” or
“Get busy,” as he’s in the process of eliminating.
By repeating a phrase each time your dog eliminates, you’re
indicating what you want the dog to do, and ultimately he can
learn to eliminate on cue.
 Once your dog has eliminated, take time out to reward him
with your attention, a fun game, or a walk. If you rush back
inside immediately, your dog will learn to delay eliminating in
order to spend more time outside with you.
 Most puppies can hold their bladder muscles for six to eight
hours. Take your puppy out just before your bedtime, even
when you must rouse him from a deep sleep.
When accidents happen
Face it — accidents happen. Although dogs catch on to the house-
breaking routine quickly, no one is immune to an occasional lapse.
Accidents happen for a variety of reasons:
 The dog was isolated too long or not given adequate time to
relieve herself during the last outing.
 He’s suffering an infection or illness.
 He awakened from a nap or had a large drink of water and no
one noticed, so he wasn’t let out.
 You got home later than usual, and the dog couldn’t hold it.
If the dog messes, don’t hit him, yell at him, or rub his nose in it. A
dog rarely makes the connection between your punishment and
his earlier behavior. Such heavy-handed behaviors only teach the
dog to be afraid of you. If you catch the dog in the act and punish
him, all that you may have taught him is to make his messes in
hidden places out of your sight.
Part IV: Dogs Don’t Misbehave: Misperceptions and Solutions 
202

If you actually catch your dog in the process of eliminating inside
the house, interrupt him and take him outside to the proper place
(without harsh words or punishment). If he eliminates outside,
praise him. Remember to be patient; some dogs take longer than
others to housebreak.
Your best course of action when faced with an occasional mess is
to simply clean it up. Then use a commercial odor eliminator
(many are enzyme-containing products) or simply clean the area
with white vinegar or rubbing alcohol. These cleaners kill any trace
scents that may trigger elimination.
Chapter 13: Addressing and Solving Problem Behavior 203
Laugh a little
Your interpretation and response to your dog’s behavior really determines how dis-
ruptive his delinquency is to your life. Often, a sense of humor will save your rela-
tionship with your pet.
One day, Stan had done some shopping and then left the bag of groceries on the
kitchen counter while he went off to a meeting. When he returned, the kitchen was
a disaster area. His retriever Dancer had pulled the bag off the counter and eaten
a bag of cookies and a loaf of bread from it. In the process, a plastic bottle of cola
and another bottle of pink liquid stomach upset remedy had split open, covering the
floor with a sticky brown and pink mess with lots of crumbs floating in it. Meanwhile,
Dancer stood in the middle of this mess with his stomach distended and rumbling.
Obviously, disciplining Dancer for something he’d done a couple of hours ago was
useless because he wouldn’t understand the connection. Stan had the following
alternatives:
 Yell at the dog anyway.
 Ignore the dog and angrily clean up the mess.
 Feel guilty about the fact that his dog was now in great discomfort because of
his own negligence in leaving the bag so close to the edge of the counter.
 Laugh at the idea that his dog had not only gorged himself on forbidden sweets
and washed it down with cola, but also had the foresight to drink a dose of stom-
achache remedy.
So he laughed. It doesn’t mean that he doesn’t care or likes cleaning up sticky
messes, or that he’ll ever leave things like that on the counter edge again. He
laughed because it was too late to do anything but clean up and because he knew
that this would be a funny story to tell to his friends.
Anger only confuses the dog and weakens your relationship with your pet. It doesn’t
solve any problem. Before punishing the dog for a transgression, ask yourself, “Will
I laugh about this incident later or when I tell it to someone else?” If the answer is yes,
why not laugh now and then get on with the business of making things right again?

Don’t use products containing ammonia, because it smells enough
like urine that it actually attracts the dog to eliminate in that place
again. Also, don’t let the pup watch you clean up because your
activities may draw him back to that spot again.

Dummies (Wiley), by Susan McCullough.

Behavior
In This Chapter
 Knowing how to recognize fear
 Dealing with submissive urination
 Curing separation anxiety
 Treating your dog’s fears and phobias
F
ear, anxiety, and stress are the big three ingredients when it
comes to psychological problems in humans, and they’re
equally important in the psychology of dogs. Sometimes it’s quite
clear that your dog is worried and afraid. In other instances, you
only know your dog is afraid after he engages in certain unpleasant
behaviors, which can run the gamut from destroying furniture and
objects, loud barking and howling in your absence, or even behav-
iors that look much like unprovoked aggression, such as nipping or
biting someone. The first step in helping your dog with his anxiety
is being able to recognize it in the first place.
The Face of Fear
The more obvious signs that a dog is anxious or afraid include ears
slicked back, tail down, whining, whimpering and other high pitched
sounds, and cringing or rolling on the ground (see Figure 14-1). An
anxious dog may respond in different ways, however, depending
upon the type of fear it is dealing with.
Fear isn’t a simple emotion, and often surfaces in unique ways and
to varying degrees. The strongest and most obvious form comes
when the dog feels that its very life and safety are threatened.
In such situations, only two courses of action are open to the dog.
It can escape the fearful situation, or it can fight the individual who
is the source of the threat.

Figure 14-1: Typical fearful position with body lowered.
Among fearful dogs, you find a number of fear biters. These dogs
are virtually swamped by their fear and may seem to be acting
both inappropriately and unpredictably to otherwise everyday sit-
uations. If a trauma has left a dog legitimately so afraid of a person
or situation that he is willing to attack to save himself from harm,
he desperately needs to be reconditioned to accept the stimulus.
Though this process may take time and patience, it’s not impossible.
A fearful dog prefers to head for the hills and run away from situa-
tions or people that frighten him, whether threat is real or imagined.
Consider the dog who is afraid of newcomers and who will immedi-
ately hide the moment the doorbell rings. In the wild, this reaction
is a survival skill; in the home, it creates confusion, as most people
love to introduce and share their pet’s love as though it were
another family member. Of course, if anyone in your family hid
when a visitor knocked, you’d immediately seek help. So, too,
should you be alerted if your dog is showing this level of anxiety.

Normal social fear and communication
It is fascinating that more dogs don’t use aggression when fearful or threatened,
though as with many behaviors, an evolutionary explanation exists. It seems that
evolution took a dislike to aggression among members of the same group, unless
there is no other recourse. In a pack of wolves, for example, it’s important to their
survival that they stay together, which requires strong social bonds. Within a pack
of wolves, a hierarchy evolved to organize group interaction, with the brightest and
most sensible wolves guiding the rest of the pack.
A nervous or fearful wolf might feel intense conflict when addressed by a more
dominant pack member, but running away or showing aggression would not be an
appropriate social response. Instead, wolves, and in turn dogs, learned more appro-
priate gestures to communicate respect, submission, and fear. In effect, this social
skill allows them to stay in the group, share in companionship, and yet avoid conflict.

At times, a fear is manifested, and a dog can’t retreat. This situa-
tion creates an impulse of fight or flight, and when left no other
option, a dog will react aggressively in its natural impulse to
simply survive. In the wild, this reaction may be seen if a dog were
cornered by a larger predator, such as a bear or a mountain lion,
but in everyday life, this reaction can evolve when a dog is teth-
ered, caged, or cornered.
Using social skills to resolve conflict
Fortunately, dogs who bite humans out of fear are in the minority.
Dogs accept humans as other dogs, and they often use the same
social skills that help them adapt to social living throughout 
evolution.
Truly fearful dogs often have a history of social isolation or neglect
in puppyhood. If a young dog is isolated from humans and/or other
dogs during her early socialization period (see Chapter 8), she’ll be
unable to learn appropriate play and communication skills. When
placed in “normal” social situations as an adult, the social “handicap”
will be readily noted through fearful/aggressive displays.
When a dog is socialized normally, he develops natural communi-
cation skills to avoid conflict and stress with other group members.
Obviously, in the case of conflict, escape and fighting are still options
open to the dog. Of the two, fighting is a less likely outcome.
The major communication signal that submissive dogs use to
avoid conflict is to lower their body frame as they cringe with both
belly and head near the ground while looking up. Designed to
shrink appearances, it’s exactly the opposite of expressing domi-
nance, which involves standing tall, tail up, ears up, fur standing
Chapter 14: Countering Anxiety-Based Behavior 207
The eyes have it
If your dog is panting or showing any other signs of stress, look carefully at his eyes.
In human beings, stress, anxiety, and excitement cause the pupils of our eyes to
dilate. The same is true in dogs. If you have a breed where you can see the size of
his pupils, check whether they’re larger than usual. If so, your dog is under pressure
of some sort.
Of course, this assessment requires that you first know how large your dog’s pupils
are when he’s not worried, so take this opportunity to look into his eyes now so that
you have something to compare with later if you think your dog is going through an
anxious period.

erect to make an individual look larger. In this case of submission,
the dog is basically saying, “Let’s not argue” or “I accept your lead-
ership and higher social status.”
The presence of a ritualized signal, such as the lowered body, isn’t
a sign of physical fear, but rather a means of avoiding the frightening
possibility of confrontation. This stance is no different than a peas-
ant bowing before a king to show respect and acknowledge his rank.
Recognizing signs of stress
Fortunately, most of our dogs don’t often have full-blown bouts of
fear, but they can suffer from a variety of stressors and worries.
The following signs and signals indicate stress:
 Panting: In addition to panting or perspiring when a dog is
overheated, a dog may also pant or appear distressed when
he’s experiencing excitement or anxiety. Thus, when a dog
that isn’t moving and that isn’t exposed to warm conditions
starts to vigorously pant, this means that he is excited or anx-
ious. Obviously, excitement can come about because of posi-
tive events, such as anticipating a walk, but if such a happy
event isn’t impending, it’s likely that the dog is anxious, wor-
ried, or perhaps even in pain.
 Submissive paw: A subtle sign of distress is a lifted front paw.
Though many people may interpret this as cute, it signals
emotional conflict, combining social fear with a reasonable dose
of insecurity. For example, the raised paw signal for stress
evolved from the earliest submissive behavior that puppies dis-
play in their litter. This raised paw gesture is also quite common
in puppies and means not only mild stress, but a request to be
interpreted as, “I need you to do something for me.”
The submissive paw is a common site in the early stages of
obedience training classes where the dogs are quite unsure as
to what’s expected of them. If the dog has been placed in a sit
position and told to stay, for example, the dogs with their
paws raised are also the ones that are most likely to lie down
or to break and run to the safety of their master’s side before
the time has been completed.
 Obsessive licking: An interesting variation of this licking
behavior is a sure sign of stress or anxiety. Adult dogs can
show their stress by something that looks like they’re licking
the air. They flick their tongues in and out as though licking
something when they’re too far away to actually touch the
individual who is causing their worry, or when they’re too
frightened to actually come close and make physical contact.
Air licking is almost always a good indicator of an anxious dog.

The Leaky Dog Syndrome
The scene isn’t uncommon. You arrive home, a guest arrives at
your house, or you meet someone in the street, and when an
attempt is made to greet your dog, you see her crouching on
the ground with yellow droplets or a pool of piddle around her.
This anxiety-based behavior isn’t a lapse in housetraining. It is a
sign that something about the situation is stimulating some extreme
feelings of worry, and technically behaviorists refer to this prob-
lem as submissive urination.
Like many dog behaviors, you can trace the origin of this one back
to the litter. Young pups need to be stimulated by their mother’s
licking and nudging before they can urinate or defecate. If the pup
doesn’t respond quickly enough, the mother may nudge the genital
area quite hard to get things moving, and the resulting yelps from
the pups indicate that this action can be unpleasant. Later, when
the puppy is older and is effectively using his eyesight, the mother
simply has to look as if she intends to roll the pup over to start the
toilet ritual to trigger urination. This step saves the mother time
(and the pups the discomfort of hard nudges) and prepares the
pups to become “housetrained” when they’re capable of following
their mother outside to eliminate.
Psychologically, puppies learn early to respond to a dominant look
or gesture with submissive urination. As the puppies become more
mature, they do gain control over this behavior, and depending
upon their life experience, it may never again appear in adulthood.
However, in cases of severe stress (which varies, depending on a
Chapter 14: Countering Anxiety-Based Behavior 209
Litter tales
Many of the gestures that indicate anxiety, worry, or submissive behavior that
results from fear actually evolve from things that happened in the litter. After pup-
pies are fed, the mother nudges each pup over onto his back or side with her nose.
She then holds him down and licks him from top to bottom. When she starts to lick
his face and neck, the puppy’s reaction is to raise his paw and lie there submis-
sively until his mother is finished with her task. Later, when the puppy’s eyes are
functioning well, it takes only a hard dominant stare from his mother to cause him
to roll over while lifting his paw.
Puppies often try to pacify their mother or other members of their litter by licking
them when they’re acting hostile or threatening. Later, when the dog is more mature,
he may use licking behavior for the same reason. He may lick the hand of his master
who has been angry at him, for example.

puppy’s temperament or life experiences), submissive urination
can occur and can become a messy and embarrassing problem to
the dog’s owners.
Submissive urination is an involuntary behavior that you can’t cor-
rect by becoming angry or upset. Solving the problem requires you
to control any display of emotion.
Before addressing the problem, analyze it. When does it occur?
 When you arrive home?
 When you or others are facing the dog?
 When you are angry, scolding, or raising your voice to the dog?
 When you lean over or try to pick him up?
 When the dog meets new people or enters strange places?
Once the situations that trigger the urination are identified, you
can clear up the problem in a few weeks, depending upon your
skill, consistency, and severity of the problem.
Stopping the leak
Because submissive urination predictably results when your dog is
greeting a person whose stature or vocal tones convey authority,
you can easily predict when this behavior will occur. When inter-
acting with these authority-type figures, inform them of your
efforts and ask them to ignore your dog, either completely or at
least until you’ve equipped them with a treat cup or your dog
approaches them.
The good news is that a puppy or a young dog usually outgrows
the problem as he matures and can predict interactions. Building
your dog’s self-confidence is also critical in resolving this anxiety-
based problem. Punishment, on the other hand, only intensifies his
anxiety and makes matters worse.
The essence of the correction is to remove any signs of threat at
those critical times that you’ve identified as the triggers for this
behavior. For example:
 If your dog piddles when you approach, don’t approach directly.
Stand quietly and then turn sideways and crouch down.
 Don’t say anything to the dog.
 Don’t make eye contact.
 Don’t hold out your hand.
Part IV: Dogs Don’t Misbehave: Misperceptions and Solutions 
210

 Let the dog approach you.
 When the dog reaches you, pet him lightly under the chin.
Don’t reach out palm down or over the dog’s head. If petting
causes further wetting, withhold it for a few days and then try
again.
If your dog is treat motivated, use a treat cup, clicker, or hand-held
goodies to externalize his focus as you encourage him to approach
you (see Chapter 10).
In addition, make every effort to build your dog’s confidence in
your day-to-day interactions:
 Tone down your voice levels when interacting with your dog
on a day-to-day basis.
 Use obedience training or other athletic courses (such as
agility) using food and praise to encourage your dog’s interest
and cooperation. Using simple directions like “Sit” can calm
him when meeting new people.
 When a new person approaches, ask her to hold out a treat
and avert her eyes (preferably to the ground) as she calls
your dog’s name.
 If your dog is truly afraid of strangers, ask to hold your visi-
tor’s hand in yours as your dog sniffs your mutual scent.
The effect of this carefully planned social encounter can slowly
recondition your dog’s fear into eager anticipation of positive
social encounters. Submissive peeing no more!
Curbing Separation Anxiety
Separation anxiety is a term used to cover a whole collection of
extreme reactions that dogs have when their owners leave them
alone in their home. Classic responses include
 Destructive chewing or clawing of door, clothing articles, fur-
nishings, counter objects, and so on
 Self-mutilating behaviors, such as excessive licking, scratch-
ing, or clawing, referred to as self-micturation
 Digging garden beds, plants, carpets, or bedding
 Indoor micturation (marking, other eliminations)
 Vocal protest, including howling and barking
 Frantic/hyperactive displays upon your departure and arrivals
Chapter 14: Countering Anxiety-Based Behavior 211

Our casebooks are filled with such instances: Jet, the border collie
who quite literally stripped the kitchen wallpaper by the back door;
Billy, the boxer who chewed and dug a hole through a wall between
two rooms; and countless other dogs who daily destroy furnishings
and clothing when they’re left alone. Separation anxiety is all too
common in today’s world where dogs are left alone for prolonged
hours and simply expected to entertain themselves. These poor
social creatures don’t perform these acts joyfully — each animal
was in a heighten state of anxiety, to the point of sheer panic.
Accept it or not, but people are the chief cause of a dog’s prolonged
separation anxiety experience. Though most dogs experience 
separation anxiety during adolescence, handled properly, this
developmental phase passes quickly. Handled inappropriately,
however, this psychological issue can last a lifetime.
The experience of separation anxiety has evolutionary roots. In a
pack, young puppies remain at the den with a chaperone, as the
adult wolves/dogs would venture to a field to hunt or explore. As the
puppies matured into adolescents, the release of adult hormones
would herald a rite of passage, and the same puppies were included
in all adult rituals. Fast forward to present day. Though young pup-
pies readily accept your comings and goings, adolescent dogs
must emotionally adjust to your separation as their impulses are
quite literally telling them to join you.

212
Metaphorically speaking
Consider yourself a young child, say 8 years old. Suppose that your guardian leaves
you alone in the house without telling you when she’ll be back. As the minutes tick
by, you’ll likely grow bored, anxious, and/or concerned. You may find yourself invol-
untarily glancing at her photograph on the wall or finding a familiar object to reas-
sure yourself. When your guardian does finally come home, you’re happy and
relieved and show this feeling with a strong display of emotion.
Dogs experience a similar anxiety, especially heightened when it’s first experienced
during adolescence. If you enjoy indulging your dog or you respond to every request
for attention, your departure and consequent separation will be more pronounced.
Because a quick phone conversation is out of the question, your dog may try to
reach you by barking or howling. If your dog is a nonverbal type, he may visualize
your presence and recall images of your activities around the house, such as your
reading or television activities or clothing that is familiar and worn.
How can shoes or boots that are dragged from the closet be a sign of love and bond-
ing? Though this dog isn’t happy at the moment, his thoughts are most certainly with
you when you leave him behind.

How it all begins . . .
Here’s how a common reaction can take an understandably stress-
ful situation for a dog and turn it into an anxiety-producing event:
You get a new puppy that you leave at home while you go to work.
Each time you return home, you joyfully greet the puppy with lots
of touching, praise, and attention. Because, at least initially, you
keep regular hours, the dog begins to anticipate these interactions.
But, of course, no matter how regular your routine is, there will be
a day that you’ll be late. Because dogs have a reasonable sense of
time, your pup will begin to fret and worry. He may imagine hear-
ing the expected sound of your footsteps or seeing you enter the
door, but when it doesn’t happen, he becomes anxious and wants
to experience your presence. It’s then that he comes upon the
book you were reading, slippers you were wearing, or the TV
remote control that you handled. If he can’t have you, then at least
he can have your scent and the taste associated with your body
oils and sweat. So he sniffs, tastes, and ultimately chews the article
to gain something akin to your presence.
Finally, you come home — only this time it’s not going to be a 
happily-ever-after finish. The puppy sees you and, in full inno-
cence, begins the usual greeting routine, perhaps with an added
nearly hysterical component of relief at your return. You join in
because this display of love is comforting — that is, until your eye
falls on the shredded paper that was the book you were reading,
the chewed remainder of your slippers, or the bits of plastic that
once housed the remote control. Understandably, a frustrated
reaction, such as a verbal outlash or a grab-n-drag to what remains
of a chewed possession, follows.
The puppy, however, is unlikely to register the object as his simple
one-track mind is currently focused on your homecoming. When this
confused pup yelps and tries to escape, he’s also filled with terror
because the very person he instinctively turns to when distressed
is, in fact, the one who is turning on him. Furthermore, because the
punishment wasn’t associated with the impulse to chew, he can’t
make any psychological connection to the behavior and instead
links your reaction to your return and your separation to the
events that are sure to follow, which in anyone’s dictionary spells
S-E-P-A-R-A-T-I-O-N A-N-X-I-E-T-Y!!!
So when you’re away, your dog impulsively seeks objects that com-
fort him and grows exceedingly more anxious of your departures.
Not only does this whole interaction not correct the puppy’s anxiety-
based behavior, but he now is likely to develop a conflicted view of
you. In his mind, you become an angel and a devil, or Dr. Jekyll and
Chapter 14: Countering Anxiety-Based Behavior 213

Mr. Hyde, in the same body. If this pattern is repeated a few times,
it can lead to anxiety about your homecomings, which add to the
anxieties concerning your absence. One consequence of this may be
submissive urination. (See “The Leaky Dog Syndrome,” earlier in
this chapter.) The puppy now more actively solicits your attention
when you’re home because he needs the comfort and security that
your interaction gives him. When you respond, this causes him to
miss you even more when you’re away, and this cycle of comfort-
seeking destruction, followed by more, perhaps harsher, punishment
continues. This pattern eventually leads to other problems and
ultimately can destroy your relationship with your dog. Egad!
Solving isolation and 
anxiety problems
To resolve the issue of separation anxiety, all efforts must be 
two-fold:
 Your dog’s emotional experience must be both understood
and addressed.
 Your dog’s inappropriate displacement behavior must be
rechannelled to more appropriate activity.
Resolving a dog’s anxiety requires more human behavior modifica-
tion than anything else.

Secondhand dog separation 
anxiety syndrome
An adopted dog often shows signs of separation anxiety, many times resulting from
the ultimate separation: sheer abandonment. Most shelter dogs, in fact, exhibit
some form of separation anxiety in new homes. Suddenly transported from a famil-
iar, predictable home environment to the unavoidable chaos of a shelter existence,
they’re then placed into a new home, where they’re unsure of their new family mem-
bers and the rules and rituals. These dogs are often left wholly undirected, espe-
cially when left alone.
In these situations, it’s best to isolate or crate a dog until he’s comfortable with his
surroundings and routines. Follow the same conditioning exercises in this chapter
to relieve separation anxiety.

Coming and goings
Although each of us loves our dogs and revels in their happy greet-
ings, comings and goings need to become a far less dramatic event.
If each time you (or anyone else) arrive or depart, a maniac scene
ensues, your dog will never calm down when left alone. Each noise
becomes cause for alert, each knock on the door a reason to kick
into high gear. Though your reassurance upon departure may soothe
your disappointment, it only highlights your inevitable separation,
leaving your dog in an agitated state.
These simple efforts go far in de-emphasizing your absence and to
condition your dog to being left alone:
 When you leave, draw the curtains or shades, if necessary, to
screen out sights. Turn on a radio or television to provide
human sounds and also to mask noises from outside. Simply
put on your outside clothing and, without saying anything to
the dog, leave.
Consider your door as the mouth of the den. Whether you’re
greeting your dog or a visitor has arrived, always address
your dog after he’s calmed down and is away from the 
doorway.
 When you return, be equally as quiet. Though your dog may
be overexcited to see you, ignore your dog for a minute or two
before acknowledging her presence. Take off your coat and
hat and hang them up. Put away the bags or briefcase that
you’re carrying, if any, and enter the main area of the house-
hold. When your dog has calmed down, greet him quietly, and
then continue on the course of your day. If you’re eager for a
more ecstatic interchange, promote play in an appropriate
environment, whether inside or out.
When boredom masks as anxiety
Some destructive dogs aren’t anxious at all! They’re simply not get-
ting enough exercise and are bored. Upon close observation, these
dogs are simply revved up and in need of a good romp in the park.
To break their pattern of destruction, increase their exercise. When
you leave, provide favorite bones or toys specifically designed to
alleviate restless energy, such as food-filled hollow toys or boxes
that dispense treats as they’re moved.
Toys that contain food items should be washed between every use
and removed when you’re home.
Chapter 14: Countering Anxiety-Based Behavior 215

Soothing Fears and Phobias
Many dogs exhibit a fear response to specific situations, places, or
people at some point in their life. It’s a natural reaction to inexperi-
ence: Presented with an unfamiliar string of sensory stimulations,
a puppy acts startled and looks to authority figures for direction.
Handled properly, a puppy will condition to the event and integrate
it into memory. For example, the first time the phone rings, a
puppy may be startled, but after experiencing the routine after-
math of a telephone call, the noise no longer even wakes him from
a deep sleep.

216
Obsessive self-licking
Obsessive self-licking is a touchy topic because there are many theories as to its
cause, none of which is incorrect, though each one addresses a unique situation.
As with every behavior problem, different stimulus prompts a behavior, and you can
interpret a dog’s reaction in many ways.
Here are several standing reasons that represent the occurrence of self-licking, or
what is known in professional circles as Acral Lick Granuloma:
 Many dermatologists think that boredom is a major underlying factor in some
cases of Acral Lick Granuloma. The dog’s licking activity helps pass the time.
 Some believe that allergic inhalant dermatitis creates stress in the skin result-
ing in inflammation and pruritus (itching), which triggers the dog’s propensity
to lick at any convenient area.
 A foreign body, such as a thistle spine, splinter, or bee sting, may start up a reac-
tion in the skin, which draws the dog’s attention to the spot.
 Bone or joint pain can draw the dog’s attention to the wrist or ankle area and,
in an attempt to alleviate the discomfort, the dog licks over the top of the joint.
 Psychological stimuli, such as separation anxiety, a new pet or child in the home,
or a neighbor’s dog invading the dog’s “territory,” can create psychological
stress. Self-stimulation, such as picking out an area to concentrate on and lick-
ing for extended periods of time, is a way for the dog to relieve the “stress.”
 Hypothyroidism has played a role in some cases of Acral Lick Granuloma.
Especially in Black Labs with lick granulomas, it would be a good idea to have
the Thyroid Gland function checked. Thyroid medication may just be what the
dog needs to have those skin lesions resolve.
If your dog suffers from this condition, speak to your veterinarian and consult with
a behaviorist.

Handled improperly, however, a dog may harbor residual fear or,
worse, develop a phobic reaction, trying to hide whenever the
stimulus is presented. Do you know any dogs who try to hide
whenever an electrical storm occurs? Are you living with one?
Dogs can develop a fear or a phobia (which is an irrational but
strong fearful response) to just about anything. Here are just a
handful of situations from our casebook:
 Police sirens
 Vacuum cleaners
 Rain pelting a roof
 Linoleum floors
 Reflection of a metal pan on the kitchen ceiling
 Large men
 Lawn mowers
 Loud trucks
 Sound of a violin
 Pop-up sound of a toaster
 Sight of a body of water, such as a lake
Humans can contribute to a dog’s fearfulness in a number of ways.
Some involve what a person does, and some involve what a person
hasn’t done — for example, a lack of socialization (see Chapter 8).
The more experience a dog has with different situations, especially
during the first six months of its life, the more familiar he is with
everyday life.
The best way to prevent a dog from being immobilized by fear of
something is to fully socialize your dog.
Some dogs learn fears by mirroring their people’s reaction to cer-
tain events. One common situation is when a small dog is lifted at
the sight of a larger dog. Though there may be a reality element to
this protectiveness, it’s far better for people to socialize small dogs
with familiar dogs of every age and size to ensure their comfort in
the world surrounding them.
Another case involves a woman who is worried or apprehensive
when she encounters large male strangers on the street. Every
time she’s walking her dog and she meets a strange man, she
becomes nervous. Because all dogs are sensitive to body language
and are literally attuned to the scent of fear, this dog learns that
Chapter 14: Countering Anxiety-Based Behavior 217

every time his mistress meets a man, she becomes frightened. Not
surprisingly, the dog learns to be anxious in such situations as
well. In this way dogs can learn to be frightened of particular
classes of people, defined by their sex, size, or race.
The second way dogs can learn fears and phobias is to be rewarded
for being afraid. Though no one would consciously reward a dog’s
fear, the difference between our languages can sometimes spell
miscommunication. If, for example, your dog acts startled when
he hears a sudden clap of thunder, your natural response may
be to speak empathetically and bend down to sooth your dog.
Though it’s a nurturing and effective response with human 
children, the lowered posture, soft tones, and soothing pats com-
municate a very different message to your dog. In essence, your
shrinking posture conveys that you’re as unsure as he is and, at
a very basic psychological level, you’re rewarding your dog for
being fearful.
The key to solving many problem behaviors in dogs is to “reward
the behaviors that you want and ignore the behaviors that you
don’t want.” Applying this philosophy to fearful behaviors takes
some ingenuity, as it’s often hard to highlight good behavior when
your dog is in a fearful state, but you can get around this dilemma
by playing through fear and working through fear.
Playing through fear
To solve fearful behaviors, it’s helpful to reproduce the conditions
that cause the fear. Thus, if a dog is afraid of thunder, you need to
produce the sound of thunder, while if the dog is afraid of men
wearing hats, you need a man willing to wear a hat in front of your
dog. It’s also better if you can control the intensity or distance
your dog is standing from the fear-producing stimulus. Fortunately,
if your dog is afraid of certain sounds, sound effect recordings are
available, or you can download sound clips from many Web sites,
often for free.
Here’s what you need to do:
1. Prepare a favorite game, activity, or pastime as you stim-
ulate his fear reactions.
Chasing activities, tug, or catch are great options. (If your
dog doesn’t know them, teach him!)
2. Introduce the fear-producing stimulus (at a low level or
at a specified distance) and instantaneously (before your
dog has time to become fearful) start your play routine.
Part IV: Dogs Don’t Misbehave: Misperceptions and Solutions 
218

Here’s what should happen. At first, your dog may act con-
fused or may even revert to his usual fearful behavior.
3. If your dog is confused or afraid, continue the happy play
(perhaps while making the stimulus a bit weaker) for a
couple of minutes and then stop.
4. Go do something else for about five minutes, while
paying no attention to the dog.
5. Repeat the whole process.
You can repeat this process about four times, twice a day.
You’ll know that you’re making progress when the dog starts
to wag his tail and looks at you when the fear-producing
stimulus starts. Then simply turn up the intensity of the
stimulus a bit and continue.
Working through fear
If you’ve taught your dog basic obedience (see Chapter 12), use
these directions to help your dog through these frightening
moments. Your direction is communicating several things:
 You’re not afraid
 This stimulation is an everyday experience and nothing to be
worried about.
 When your dog is afraid, he should look to you for direction,
not collapse in fear.
Begin with a low level of the fear-producing stimulus (see the pre-
ceding section). Instead of play, use a leash/training collar and
food rewards to direct and encourage your dog’s cooperation.
The moment that the stimulation is noted, direct your dog to
“follow” you and proceed to lead him about the home, yard, or
sidewalk. Stop occasionally and tell him to sit, or perhaps lie down,
and give him lots of treats for paying attention and responding.
Your dog may act disoriented, looking at you as if you’ve lost your
mind. However, confidence is catching; by simply attending to him
when he’s calm and not fearful, he’ll soon learn to incorporate the
situation into his memory bank of everyday experiences. Gradually,
increase the intensity of the fearful stimulus a bit and continue
your work routine.
Using a leash and food rewards to direct your dog through fearful
situations has a great advantage: It’s equivalent to holding a child’s
hand who is afraid. Consider using this procedure to get your dog
through a fearful, real-life episode. For example, if you’re out with
Chapter 14: Countering Anxiety-Based Behavior 219

your dog and an actual thunderstorm begins, tell your dog to heel
and start to practice. No one needs to know that you’re giving psy-
chotherapy to your dog for his thunder phobia, although they may
wonder about the soggy person walking a soggy dog in the rain,
and giving him lots of soggy treats.

Understanding and Resolving
Aggressive Behavior
In This Chapter
 Understanding the signs and causes of canine aggression
 Assessing whether your dog has aggressive tendencies
 Discovering the importance of breed differences
 Controlling and retraining the aggressive dog
M
ost people misunderstand the fact that the primary purpose
of canine aggression is usually not to hurt and maim, but
rather to change the behavior of another creature. Canine aggression
is a tricky topic. Like human anger, it’s a healthy form of communica-
tion, but it can get out of control if it’s not comprehended properly,
curbed, or redirected. Fortunately, only a small percentage of dogs
elevate their responses to frustration, fear, or social challenge to a
dangerous level. Out-of-control aggression can generally be traced
to genetic or physiological sources, insufficient nurturing, lack
of socialization, and/or rough or unintentionally confrontational
handling.
Recognizing the Signs
Dogs don’t bite just because they can. They react for a set number
of situations, and once you recognize each, you’ll be better equipped
to understand your dog’s angry or tense reaction. Not every dog
reacts to every stress, and many dogs are wholly unaggressive.
If your dog is showing aggression, ask yourself the following ques-
tions about when your dog seems to be threatening:
 Does it happen when someone is staring at or threatening
him, such as during discipline or greetings?
 Does it happen when he feels cornered?
 Does it happen when a food resource or object is at risk?

 Does it happen when competing for a limited resource (such
as food, toys, or attention) with another dog or person?
 Does it happen when he’s disturbed during sleep?
 Does it happen when a territory is approached?
 Does it happen when competing for an object or resting space?
Reading body language
Dogs signal their aggressive intentions through certain clear changes
in their facial expressions, their body posture, movements, or,
more subtly, their social behaviors. If you watch your dog, he gives
you many clear signals before his aggressive threats elevate to a
physical level. Regardless of the underlying emotion — whether
dominance or fear — these signals are danger signals. Actual phys-
ical aggression, where teeth are applied to skin, is really only the
final step in what is usually an elaborate progression of aggressive
signals. These displays include:
 A prolonged direct stare
 Raised hackles
 Growling
 Bared teeth
 Body arching
 A stiff walk
 Tail curled between his legs or held very high over the back
and fluffed out
 Pricked ears (if the dog has them) lowered to the side to look
like a wide V or airplane wings
Many of these cues are seen long before a reaction actually erupts.
Think back to puppyhood. Did you ever consider these actions cute?
You’re certainly not alone. The first time your puppy grabs a tissue
and baits you with a gleeful expression, it’s adorable. But antics
like this soon lose their flavor, and before long, you may find your-
self venting frustration over behaviors that you once laughed at.
Of course, this reaction makes sense to humans, but it doesn’t to a
dog. And suddenly, the very one your dog turns to for interaction
(namely you) is now turning on him, showing signs of what he
interprets as aggression. Play growling and nipping in a puppy can
appear to be “cute,” or at least innocuous, but such behaviors may
just be the tip of a growing iceberg that can sink your relationship
with your dog. The answer is not to use force or rough handling to
solve the problem, but rather to socialize and train him. (See
Chapter 8 for more on living with a puppy.)
Part IV: Dogs Don’t Misbehave: Misperceptions and Solutions 
222

What is unintentionally rough handling? Many people are unaware
that chasing, yelling at, or hitting a dog can result in canine aggres-
sion. Each attempt to curb a dog’s behavior in this manner is viewed
as confrontational. A dog raised in this atmosphere often becomes
defensive and guarded, which, as he matures, can lead to aggres-
sive displays.
The problem is that once aggressive behaviors develop, they never
disappear on their own. Dogs quickly become skilled at using
aggression as a tool to get what they want or as a shield in stressful
situations. If your dog is showing aggression or your young puppy
is showing a propensity toward dominant behavior, do everything
within your power to contain this behavior, then to reduce it, and
finally to eliminate any reoccurrence of it. The first step is to know
how to identify and acknowledge when and if your dog is showing
signs of aggression.
Evaluating aggressive tendencies
We’re often quite blind when it comes to flaws in the behaviors of
those that we love. That is why children can sometimes be well on
their way toward delinquent or unacceptable behaviors before we
even admit to ourselves that a problem exists. The same goes for
our dogs. It’s psychologically difficult to admit that the dog that
sleeps next to your bed could be a threat to anyone.
Chapter 15: Understanding and Resolving Aggressive Behavior 223
Human behavior
Human behaviors play an important role in canine aggression. Certain behaviors
increase or decrease the likelihood of dog bites. For example, in 53 percent of dog
bite fatalities, there was some suggestion that the dog was provoked by being struck
or poked in the face, having things thrown at him, or otherwise subjected to human
aggression. In the case of children, bites are more likely when they’re running,
shouting, or screaming. It is interesting to note that a one-hour class on “bite proof-
ing” has been shown to reduce, by more than 80 percent, the likelihood that a child
will be bitten by a dog.
The behavior of the dog’s owners is also important. Dogs that are kept chained or
confined in a small yard are approximately three times more likely to fatally bite
people — and not just people who enter their territory, but people who they
encounter when they escape or are released from their yard. Another important
statistic is that dogs that have received obedience training (even just the simple
beginners class where people stand around in a circle, and the instructor shows
you how to get Rover to sit, come, and lie down) show nearly a 90 percent reduc-
tion in the likelihood of biting incidents. This result is probably due to the education,
not only of the dog, but of the dog’s owner as well.

Now is the time to honestly evaluate the situation. Ask yourself the
following questions:
 Does your dog growl at you, other people, or other animals?
 Has your dog ever snarled or shown his teeth to you or other
family members?
 Does your dog snap, growl, or threaten when you try to take
toys or other objects away from him or when you reach for or
come near his food?
 Does your dog snap, growl, or otherwise resist when you
groom or examine him?
 Does your dog growl, show his teeth, arch his body, cringe, or
and curl his tail between his legs when petted, especially
when your hand is raised over the top of his head?
 Does your dog nip at your ankles or those of children when
playing exuberantly?
 Do you ignore nipping, chewing at hands, play snarling, or other
mouthy behavior because you think that it’s “cute” or because
your dog is obviously too small to do anyone any harm?
 Does your dog force you to invent excuses for his socially
unacceptable growling or pushy behavior?
 Do you feel worried or apprehensive as to whether your dog
may react in an unfriendly manner when a stranger or another
dog approaches him?
If you answered “Yes” to any one of these questions, then your dog has
the potential to become aggressive. The fact that you’re carefully
reading this section at all may mean that you have some concerns
about your dog’s aggression level. It’s important to read the sugges-
tions in this chapter, however, if you find that your dog’s reaction
is escalating or anyone in your household is afraid. Call for profes-
sional help from animal behaviorists or dog trainers specializing in
handling aggression problems.
Factoring in Breed Traits
Many dog breeds have genetic potential toward aggression. Terriers
have been bred to fight other animals, and generally speaking are
quite chippy around other pets, unless raised with them. Protective
breeds, including Akitas, Great Pyrenees, and Rottweilers, have
fewer inhibitions about biting people. Because of the breed speci-
ficity in these behaviors, the public has been led to believe that
certain breeds of dogs are inherently bad. The negative image of
Part IV: Dogs Don’t Misbehave: Misperceptions and Solutions 
224

Pit Bulls is partly the result of sensationalized news reports, and it
also is reinforced in movies and on TV.
The real question everyone wants answered is whether a dog’s
breed is the best predictor of its aggressive potential. A series of
studies commissioned by the U.S. National Center for Injury
Prevention and Control has been looking at deaths due to dog bites
based on records collected over several decades. In this national
database, clear trends are evident, but the fact that a certain breed
ranks high on a list of problem dogs may not be significant.
Obviously, popular breeds will necessarily be represented in
higher numbers for any given problem simply because there are
more of them, so you need to take into account how many dogs
of a particular breed are around. You can do so by looking at the
number of dogs of each breed registered with the American Kennel
Club and using it as an estimate of the percentage of dogs of each
breed in the country.
It appears that compared to their popularity, certain breeds are
significantly less likely to be involved in fatal dog bites, even
though they’re big and muscular. Leaving out the breeds that are
simply too tiny to do fatal damage, the four breeds of dogs least
likely to be involved in such incidents, although they have the bite
strength and size to do so, are (beginning with the lowest propor-
tional fatal bite frequency) the Labrador Retriever, Dachshund,
Golden Retriever, and Bulldog. It may well be that the enduring
popularity of Labrador Retrievers and Golden Retrievers as family
pets is in part due to the fact that they’re so safe.
Based on the national statistics on fatal dog bites, the eight breeds
(starting with the most dangerous) that account for the majority of
these tragic cases of aggression are
 Pit Bulls and Pit Bull-type dogs (defined here to include
American Pit Bull Terriers, Staffordshire Terriers, American
Staffordshire Terriers, and Bull Terriers)
 Malamutes
 Chow Chows
 Saint Bernards
 Siberian Huskies
 Akitas
 Rottweilers
 German Shepherds
Chapter 15: Understanding and Resolving Aggressive Behavior 225

Please don’t assume that each dog of these breeds is born with an
overblown aggressive instinct. All that the science gives us is the
baseline probabilities. Whether any specific Golden Retriever or
Rottweiler becomes aggressive depends upon who he lives with, how
he was raised and socialized, and how he was trained and integrated
into human society. There is no doubt that kissy-faced Rottweilers
and nasty Goldens are out there, and humans and their actions
must take responsibility for both the good and the bad outcome.
Ruling Out Medical Factors
If your dog is showing aggressive tendencies, especially if this
wasn’t a problem in the past, please rule out medical causes before
addressing the problem behaviorally. Obviously, if an injury, disease,
or some form of physical or neurological defect is the cause for the
aggressive behavior, then no training or reconditioning of the dog’s
behavior will be effective until the problem has been controlled.
When aggression suddenly surfaces, an ailment, such as pain in
the teeth, back, or joints, may be distressing your dog. If you move
or touch a dog that is in pain, you can expect to be snapped at.
The dog isn’t trying to say anything with his behavior other than
“Stop that! You’re hurting me!” Make an appointment with your 
veterinarian immediately.
Here are a few more other medical conditions that may be behind
your dog’s sudden aggression:
Part IV: Dogs Don’t Misbehave: Misperceptions and Solutions 
226
Color coding
Sometimes genetic factors over and above breed identity predict aggression. For
example, it’s well known that certain lines of Springer Spaniels have a genetically
inherited condition called rage syndrome, which causes them to suddenly, without
warning, start biting and attacking anything near them. This fit of aggression may
last only a couple of seconds or up to a minute, but after it’s over, the dog acts as if
nothing has happened. Now genetic and chemical markers can indicate whether
this condition is in the dog’s hereditary makeup.
A common genetic marker for some conditions is coat color in dogs. Some English
Cocker Spaniels can suddenly bite without warning in what looks like a milder version
of the rage syndrome in Springer Spaniels. Research done at Cambridge University
demonstrates that this condition is partially predicted by the dog’s color. Solid-colored
English Cocker Spaniels are much more likely to have these conditions than are
dogs with two or more coat colors. Furthermore, among the solid-colored dogs,
those who are red or blonde colored have the strongest likelihood of biting.

 Hypothyroidism: Recent research has shown that fairly
common conditions that cause the thyroid gland to produce
abnormally low amounts of hormones may be associated with
the onset of aggressive behaviors in more than 50 breeds of
dogs. In addition to aggression, other subtle signs of imbal-
ance are excessive shedding, bald spots, an increased number
of infections, allergic symptoms, a tendency to gain weight, or
(in intact female dogs) irregular heat cycles. Hypothyroidism
is easily treated with appropriate medications and hormone
supplements.
 Encephalitis: This disease can be caused by viruses or bacte-
ria. Distemper and rabies are viral types of encephalitis.
These conditions can appear in dogs of any age, and occasion-
ally, although rarely, even in dogs that have been vaccinated.
Sudden aggressive episodes are common with this condition.
It’s easily diagnosed by testing a bit of cerebrospinal fluid (the
clear fluid in the brain and spinal cord) and is treatable with
antibiotics and antiviral medications.
 Hypoglycemia: This is the medical term for low blood sugar.
Hypoglycemia can cause major mood swings in humans as
well and is often responsible for the moodiness and flashes
of anger that people on severe weight-reducing diets show.
In addition to aggression, the symptoms of hypoglycemia can
include apparent weakness (staggering) and a glassy, dazed
look. You can usually easily treat this condition with a change
in the dog’s diet and feeding schedules.
 Head injuries or brain tumors: A brain injury or swelling
interferes with normal mental functions. Swelling, pressure, or
even bleeding in the brain often results in a variety of neuro-
logical and behavioral symptoms and often aggression. If your
dog’s mood swings and aggressive episodes are also accompa-
nied by other symptoms — including confusion or disorienta-
tion, irritability, increased episodes of whimpering or nonstop
barking, or changes in activity level (either an apathy-like
decrease or increased hyper-excitability — ask your veterinar-
ian to examine this possibility. Other important signs include
changes in the ways your dog moves, such as an alteration in
his normal gait, abnormal postures, head tilt, trembling, stag-
gering, excessive circling, frequent falling, or loss of balance.
Increased aggression can also be the result of hydrocephalus.
This congenital condition occurs when the fluid-filled spaces
in the brain (the ventricles) become enlarged. Because of the
pressure placed on the brain, the surrounding brain tissue suf-
fers from pressure similar to the swelling caused by injuries or
tumors producing similar symptoms. This condition is more
common in toy breeds and those dogs with a flattened face,
such as Pugs or Pekingese. Symptoms occur when the condi-
tion becomes extreme, which may not be until adulthood.
Chapter 15: Understanding and Resolving Aggressive Behavior 227

 Imbalances in brain chemistry: Some dogs, like people, can
have an imbalance of vital chemicals in their brain. Common
human conditions, such as clinical depression, obsessive-
compulsive disorders, anger outbursts, and mood swings, exist
in dogs as well and may result from these chemical changes.
Serotonin, a hormone that serves as a neurotransmitter, plays
an important role in the chemical control of aggression and
mood changes in the brain, especially when certain other con-
ditions that affect impulsive behaviors are present.
Unfortunately, these imbalances have no easy solution because
serotonin can’t be administered with a shot or pill. In human
beings, and now in dogs, however, there has been a good deal
of success controlling these conditions with a class of drugs
that keeps the serotonin already in the brain from being broken
down and reabsorbed around the nerve endings, thus, in effect,
increasing the amount of serotonin available for use by the
neural system. The best known of this class of drugs is Prozac,
which, in various forms, has been successfully used to treat
some forms of aggression in dogs.
Part IV: Dogs Don’t Misbehave: Misperceptions and Solutions 
228
Altering your dog’s angry brain
If your dog’s brain chemistry is the cause of his aggression and mood swings, your
veterinarian may well prescribe certain Prozac-type drugs to help increase the
amount of serotonin in your dog’s brain. However, if you suspect that your dog’s
brain chemistry is part of the cause of his aggression or as a supplement to behav-
ioral treatments of aggression, you can do two things.
The first involves 5-Hydroxytryptophan or 5-HTP, which is a naturally occurring amino
acid that is used by the body in the manufacturing of serotonin. In the United States
and other countries, it’s marketed as a dietary supplement and is available over the
counter in health-food stores and some pharmacies. It’s designed for people who
want an antidepressant and something that may aid in sleep, but it works by effec-
tively increasing the production of serotonin in the nerve endings and therefore can
help reduce aggressive tendencies in many dogs. As in the case of Prozac, the
effects may not be seen until the treatment has gone on for up to six weeks, and if
you stop administering it at anytime, you go back to ground zero. Doses of 5-HTP are
often recommended as a “booster” along with behavioral treatment of aggression.
Another treatment of body chemistry for aggression is still being researched but
appears promising. At Tufts University, a team of researchers looked at switching
dogs to low-protein, preservative-free diets (although if the only preservative is vita-
min E, that appears to be okay). This diet seems to reduce certain types of aggres-
sion in a sizable percentage of dogs. Changing your aggressive dog’s diet in this
way is worth a try because if it works for your pet, you’ll see the effects within a
week or so and you don’t have much to lose.

Identifying Different 
Types of Aggression
At one time, aggressive behavior was considered to be a single
problem, and therefore all dogs received the same treatment
regime. Today, we know that aggression comes in many forms,
each with its own cause and treatment requirements. It’s extremely
important for you to understand what’s going on when your dog
acts aggressively. Snapping at you because you touched him where
it hurts is excusable behavior while snapping at you because you
tried to move him off of the sofa is not and requires action.
Dominance aggression
The most common and treatable form of aggression relates to dom-
inance issues. Dominance aggression involves a dog growling or
biting family members in order to control their behavior and thus,
effectively, move up in status in the pack or family hierarchy. While
you may think that this aggressive behavior is sudden and unex-
pected, it’s actually quite planned and deliberate and most likely
first began to show up when your dog was an adolescent or young
adult. Once a dog achieves sexual and emotional maturity, between
8 months and 3 years, many of the social restrictions associated
with puppyhood are left behind. It’s at this time that your dog tests
authority to ensure that the most reliable “dogs” (which include
him) are orchestrating group activities. This is the motivation for
challenging those people or other family pets that he feels aren’t as
dominant as he is.
As your dog assesses your home life, he may start to try to climb
the ladder of social control by picking on the most vulnerable
family members — children and other pets. If successful, his
behavior may escalate to include challenges to you. If your dog
begins to block the entrance into rooms or growls at family mem-
bers near his food, toys, or resting places, seek professional help
immediately.
In your dog’s eyes, if you’re not authoritative and sensible, you’re
not good leadership material, and because someone must lead the
group, he’ll assign himself the role. The result? Your dog becomes
aggressive to enforce his leadership. Unfortunately his threatening
behavior may well have to do with your own personality and the
way you interact with your dog. However, you are the easiest vari-
able to change, provided that you’re willing to modify your behav-
ior for everyone’s benefit.
Chapter 15: Understanding and Resolving Aggressive Behavior 229

The issue of dominance aggression has been confirmed by
research done at the Western University of Health Sciences in
California, which showed that owners, who are gentle pushovers
when it comes to their dogs, are more likely to have to deal with
dominance aggression in their dogs. Tip-off behaviors can be seen
in people who treat their dogs like little children, giving in to their
whims, giving them treats from the table, and allowing them to
sleep undisturbed on sofas and beds.
Dominance aggression can escalate and, when aimed at children,
can be quite dangerous. Most of the recorded dog bites are, in fact,
family dogs who bite children. You have to understand that the
dogs that are unsafe around children are usually dogs that haven’t

230
Bite levels
Dogs, like people, control the level of aggression used to make a point. Not all bites
are created equally, and scientists, such as Ian Dunbar, classify bite-related aggres-
sion into six levels.
Level 1: This is a threat and a deliberate miss — snapping at air — and it doesn’t
touch the skin. This “fair warning” snap is often given by well-socialized dogs as a
“back off and leave me alone” signal.
Level 2: Involves teeth making contact, but the skin isn’t broken. There may be pain
and bruising, but no visible blood. This “hard threat” suggests that the next time,
the dog will really use its teeth as a weapon.
Level 3: The first level where skin is broken. It involves a single bite, which results in
one to three punctures with none deeper than half the depth of the eye-tooth (fang).
It’s meant to end the confrontation immediately because it threatens that the next
stage of escalation may cause real damage. A dog producing Level 3 bites is well on
the way to becoming a real aggressive threat and requires behavioral management.
Level 4: The dog is now trying to hurt his target. This bite is the result of a dog exert-
ing heavy pressure, which results in one to four puncture wounds with one or more
puncturing the skin to more than half the depth of the eye tooth. This bite may be
accompanied by some tearing and bruising. Such a bite wound is likely to require
medical attention. These injuries often result when the dog grabs and shakes what
was in its mouth. It indicates a dog who is not inhibited about biting, and if no steps
are taken, irreparable damage may be done to his next target.
Level 5: Involves multiple Level 4 bites. This dog is acting dangerously, perhaps
because it feels that its life has been threatened, and he’s now moved beyond his
normal ability to reason his way through the situation. This dog is a real threat to
his family and to society at large, and steps must be taken to treat the situation.
Level 6: The dog has killed a pet or person. This level requires no elaboration. It’s the
situation we’re trying desperately to avoid.

been well socialized. However, it’s still important to monitor the
interactions between dogs and children. A child may try to grab 
a toy or some other possession that the dog holds dear, and the
dog may see this action as both a loss of his cherished item and 
a threat to his status, if he feels dominant over children. That is a
setup for a biting incident.
Possessive aggression
The essence of possessive aggression is that the dog is telling you,
“This is mine! You can’t have it! You can’t touch it!” This type of
aggression is usually focused on food or toys and is most common
in dogs that
 As puppies, had to compete with other pups for food
 Live in households with multiple pets, or even children, who
may be viewed as coveting the dog’s food or possessions
 Were shelter dogs, who may have been taken from a safe 
environment, but when thrust into a kennel surrounded by
unknown situations, the dogs may vigorously guard their
resources and space
Chapter 15: Understanding and Resolving Aggressive Behavior 231
Bite-proofing children
The first step in protecting children from dog bites is to learn to read the facial
expressions and body language that a dog uses to convey threat, frustration, or fear
and to teach these to children. This is just basic safety education, like teaching chil-
dren to look both ways before crossing streets.
Because children naturally are attracted to dogs, you should teach them how to
approach a dog. First, have them ask the dog’s owner if they can pet the dog. Then
the child should extend a hand. If the dog approaches to sniff it calmly, the dog is
saying it would like to be friends. Calm petting can be supervised. If the dog turns
away, growls, or lowers its head, the child shouldn’t proceed.
If a child is playing and a dog approaches quickly, the “stand-like-a-statue” tech-
nique is effective in reducing the likelihood of being bitten:
 Teach your child that dogs don’t chase statues.
 Ask him to think of a statue, and when approached to stand very still, to fold his
arms across his chest and look up to the sky (discouraging all eye contact or
interaction).
 Because statues are boring, the dog will eventually go away. When he does,
back up slowly until he’s out of sight.

Don’t wait until you have an adult dog with a food- or toy-guarding
problem. Teach your puppy that being touched when he’s eating is
okay, and that your hands near the food bowl aren’t there to take
his food away. When you feed him, kneel down beside him while he
eats. Now and then, interrupt his eating to offer an especially tasty
treat, such as a piece of chicken or liver, which is bound to be
more interesting than the kibble in the bowl. After he gets used to
this, hide the treat in your hand, put your hand in his food bowl,
and when he pushes his face close, open your hand and give him
the treat. Then let him finish his meal with you still hovering close
by. In this way, he learns that your close presence at mealtimes is a
good thing, not a threat.
You can use a similar procedure with toys, bones, or other objects
that he becomes possessive over. Offer to trade the object for a
special treat and then return the object. This way, he learns that
it’s okay for you to handle his things because you don’t intend to
steal them permanently.
However, don’t forget the principle of nonconfrontation in dealing
with aggression. If your dog becomes persistently possessive over
a toy or other object, then you must make it disappear from your
dog’s life, and it must never be seen again.
Part IV: Dogs Don’t Misbehave: Misperceptions and Solutions 
232
The spoiled dog’s dilemma
Not every wolf or dog wants to be leader of the pack, but he needs to know that
someone is in charge and making decisions. It may seem strange to learn that a
dog’s anxiety can be increased when he gets what he wants without any responsi-
bility for earning it. This is often the case with pampered dogs whose owners believe
that giving their dogs everything they desire and asking nothing in return is a way
of showing their love. Because only the leader usually has full access to all the
pack’s resources, this kind of treatment can lead a dog to feel that he must be in
charge, meaning that he now has the responsibility to make all the decisions —
even when the dog is uncertain as to what to do or when he may not understand
what is actually happening. This uncertainty, combined with the fact that there is no
one else in a leadership role evaluating the situation and making a decision, is bound
to lead to fear and anxiety.
When you attempt to reassure this frightened dog, it often fails, because your reas-
suring voice tones and body posture can be read as fear by the dog, or simply
because the dog hasn’t learned to look to you for direction. The dog reasons that
because you lack the stature of a leader, you’re not in a position to make decisions
or assessments of the situation for the rest of the pack, including her.

Fear-based aggression
The emotion that most commonly causes a dog to bite a stranger
is fear. It is usually caused by a lack of early socialization. The early
signs of potential fear biting aren’t aggressive at all. Rather you
observe that the dog starts out by hiding behind a person or dog
when stressed, running away from human or canine contacts, or
fearfully urinating in the face of what they perceive as threats —
which can be just about anything. The problem is that later in life,
these dogs will learn to use aggression frequently, because it
seems to make the “threat” go away.
Your dog’s acceptance of your leadership also helps to control 
anxiety and fearfulness because canines look to their leader 
to decide when a situation, visitor, or occurrence is a threat or
challenge. If the leader isn’t showing fear or concern, then the 
dog has no reason to worry. Please refer to the upcoming section
“Controlling Aggression” to resolve your issues.
Territorial aggression
Dogs are most confident in their own territory (your home, yard, or
car). Unfortunately, especially if a dog hasn’t been well socialized to
view all humans favorably, many dogs view any visitors as potential
threats. They, therefore, bark to warn the rest of the pack or family
that something is happening and also to threaten this stranger that
they will use force, if necessary. From the dog’s point of view, this
technique is very effective. For example, when the mailman comes,
the dog barks while he inserts letters into the mail slot, and the mail-
man goes away. In his mind, this outcome proves that this form of
aggressive response really works! This outcome is rewarding enough
to guarantee that he’ll act even more aggressively next time.
Generally speaking, the easiest way to manage territorial aggres-
sion is to make sure that the postman, regular delivery people,
and the garbage collectors aren’t strangers. Introduce your dog 
to these people and have them give him a treat and perhaps a pat.
This introduction won’t stop your dog from alerting you that some-
one has arrived at your door, but it will tone things down and take
away the aggressive territorial guarding behavior directed toward
familiar people in your world.
Predatory aggression
Dogs evolved from swift running predators, and for some dogs,
running and chasing are equivalent to dancing in humans — an
enjoyable way to get into the rhythm of the universe. While for
Chapter 15: Understanding and Resolving Aggressive Behavior 233

some dogs, the chase is all that is important, others enjoy pounc-
ing at the end of the chase, which may mean nipping a cyclist, a
child on a skateboard, or a jogger. In other words, these dogs are
mimicking the aggressive patterns of the hunters in their evolution-
ary past. Certain breeds, including herding dogs, terriers, and
hounds, are more likely to show these patterns of behavior.
As always, prevention is the best route. Early socialization and
converting the puppy’s desire to chase toys that are thrown for
him to retrieve are the best ways to prevent predatory aggression.
If your dog is already chasing joggers and bicyclists, then some
form of aversion therapy is needed. Get some friends to engage in
these activities around the dog, but first arm them with water pis-
tols. When your dog chases them, something unexpected now hap-
pens. The jogger or vehicle stops, the dog gets a shot of water in
his face and hears a shouted angry “No!” For most dogs, that
response is quite adequate as aversion therapy.
If your dog is unimpressed by the water gun reaction or if his
aggressive response is advanced, call for professional help. Keep a
leash and training collar on your dog and correct him the moment
he alerts to an inappropriate distraction.
Maternal aggression
It should be obvious that dogs that have just given birth will
aggressively defend their puppies from anything that may threaten
them. This reaction is a completely unrestrained use of force since
a canine mother will do anything to protect her litter. Early social-
ization to a variety of different people can reduce the likelihood of
such aggression when the female has puppies.
Unfortunately, dogs have an additional complication, which seems to
set them apart from other domestic animals. It appears that whether
they’re pregnant or not, after ovulating, all female dogs go through a
two-month period in which their body is flooded with the same hor-
mones present during pregnancy. For some dogs, this experience
even results in physiological changes that mimic pregnancy, such as
lactating. In the last three or four weeks of this phantom pregnancy,
the female may start acting in a strange manner around certain
items, such as tennis balls, socks, soft toys, or shoes. Typically, she
collects them and hides them under a bed or other piece of furniture.
Furthermore, the female may become quite possessive and protec-
tive of these items and snap, growl, or bite anyone who comes near
them or disturbs them. As in the case of a real pregnancy that results
Part IV: Dogs Don’t Misbehave: Misperceptions and Solutions 
234

in a litter, the problem is reduced in a dog well socialized to people.
However, the only real preventative is early spaying.
If this problem does occur in your dog, behavioral methods won’t
cure the aggression. Hormone treatments can eliminate it, or you
can simply wait out the situation because it will usually disappear
in a few weeks by itself. However, during the time that this form of
aggression is likely, isolating the dog may be best, and certainly
keep children or nonfamily members from approaching that pile of
toys that the dog is protecting as she would a litter of new puppies.
Controlling Aggression
When dealing with aggression, the first step is to change the way
your dog thinks about you — he must learn to respect you as a
leader, not a follower or a playmate. Imagine meeting the president;
though you may not like his political program, you still speak to
him respectfully and, of course, you don’t try to bite him. It is
important that family members, including children, should be
treated with respect. Your dog must learn that in his pack (family),
all two-footed dogs are higher in status than all four-footed dogs.
To restructure your dog’s thinking about his place in the family
pack, he needs to learn to follow your lead, and to do so, you must
act like a leader. There are behaviors that characterize the leader
of the pack and distinguish him from his followers. The leader gets
first choice of any food, can sleep anywhere he likes, goes first
through any opening or into any new territory, and can demand
attention any time he wants it. If your dog respects you (and your
family), he is less likely to challenge you. However, you must rein-
force your leadership.
Use a nonconfrontational approach when dealing with an aggressive
dog. Attempts to confront a dog by using force will only cause the
dog to respond in kind, which will ratchet up the level of aggression
in the relationship. If the problem is based on fearfulness, confronta-
tion, or dominance, your dog will view your retaliation as active
aggression, causing him concerns about your authority and/or his
own safety. Not only will a confrontational approach make the dog
more reactive, but the dog’s insecurity will be greatest when you —
the person threatening him or hurting him — are near.
If your dog is showing signs of aggression, here are two actions you
may take in reshaping his worldview. If the aggression persists,
please seek professional help.
Chapter 15: Understanding and Resolving Aggressive Behavior 235

 Hand-feeding: One approach that encourages your dog’s
focus on your direction and presence is to hand-feed him. For
the next month, and at every possible opportunity, hand-feed
him his meals only after he has responded to a command,
such as “Come,” “Sit,” “Stay,” and “Down,” mixing up the 
commands to strengthen his attention. The whole process
should take a total of around 5 to 10 minutes.
If you’re feeding your dog soft food, you can spoon out por-
tions. Should your dog refuse to take part in your program by
responding to your commands, postpone the activity a couple
of hours until his hunger has taken hold.
Each time your dog responds to a command, give him his food
as you praise him softly and touch his collar. (Remember, the
leader gets to touch anyone that he wants.) If you’re living
with a spouse, partner, or kids, encourage them to take part 
in this activity.
After the dog has settled down and the aggressiveness and
fearfulness have toned down, you can phase out the hand-
feeding routine for his breakfast and dinner. He still has to
come and sit, but now he gets the bowl put down as his
reward. At first, the bowl will contain just a part of his meal 
so that he’ll have to obey two or three commands before the
meal is complete. Later on, it can contain a single serving.
 Touching: A simple method to strengthen your dominant posi-
tion over your dog involves touching. Beyond daily strokes,
this method involves systematic, full-body strokes that mimic
the licking pattern a mother dog applies to her puppies. This
“touch” not only helps to establish an emotional bond, but is
also an expression of her dominance and control of the litter.
Make it a practice to touch your dog systematically on an
almost-daily basis. Everyone in the family, especially the 
children, should be taught the following ritual because 
their position in the pack hierarchy is the most vulnerable.
(Discontinue this procedure immediately if your dog shows
aggression or rigidity. Get professional help immediately.)
The procedure to follow is quite straightforward. While talk-
ing in a soothing manner, saying the dog’s name frequently,
have your dog sit or stand in front of you. Take her head in
both of your hands. Stroke or fondle her ears, neck, and
muzzle in this two-handed manner, looking into the dog’s eyes
as you do. Next slide both hands down the dog’s neck, back,
and sides. Lightly slide your hands over the dog’s chest and
then all the way down each of the dog’s front legs. If the dog is
sitting, raise it gently to a standing position, lightly rub its
belly and back, and then run your hands down the hind legs
all the way to the tip of the paws. Finally, run your fingers
quickly and lightly over the dog’s tail (or tail region, if the dog
Part IV: Dogs Don’t Misbehave: Misperceptions and Solutions 
236

has a docked tail). Finish by again grasping the dog’s head
momentarily and saying the dog’s name in a happy voice.
The entire touching routine takes only about 30 seconds to a
minute, and your dog will probably enjoy all the attention, but
most importantly, she’ll recognize that she’s being subjected
to being touched, which means that she’s lower in social rank
than the ones doing the touching.
If your dog is sensitive in a certain area, don’t avoid touching
your dog there unless she’s showing aggression. (Seek profes-
sional help immediately.) Condition your dog’s acceptance 
by offering her food or a lickable treat, such as peanut butter
daubed on your finger, as you gradually increase your handling
in this sensitive area.
Preventing Aggression
The goal is, of course, to prevent the onset of aggression. To do
that, your dog must unequivocally and, in fact, quite happily
accept your leadership and direction.
If your dog accepts you (and your family) as higher in the pack
leadership, he’ll be less likely to aggressively challenge you.
However, your leadership can’t be questioned. A good approach to
ensure your dog’s respect — a process you should initiate before
your dog has shown aggression — is the family cooperation system.
The family cooperation system reminds your dog that he’s part of
a family structure, and not in charge or at the center of it. You out-
line what behaviors earn him rewards and use those rewards to
shape his behavior. Using this system, your dog learns to look for
and respect your direction.
Here’s how it works:
 As the pack leader, you should never let your dog rush out of
a door or through a gate ahead of you. Instead, use the “Wait”
and then “Okay” commands.
 When the dog is resting in a favorite spot, make it move from
time to time, using the phrase “Excuse me.” Praise your dog for
his cooperation, allowing him to return to its original position.
 Occasionally take an object or some food away from your dog.
(Start doing this when your dog is still a puppy so that aggres-
sion is less likely and more easily controlled.) The moment
you’ve done so, praise your dog for being unaggressive and
return the object or give your dog an additional bit of food
(see the early section on possessive aggression).
Chapter 15: Understanding and Resolving Aggressive Behavior 237

 Everything from toys, play, to attention should be offered only
after your dog has responded to a simple direction, such as
sit or down. Ignore all rude demands for your attention,
including pawing, barking, or placing her forepaws on you.
Either walk away, bring your arms over your face, or tug on
his leash if he’s wearing one. Immediately redirect him to “sit.”
 Use the lessons outlined in Chapters 3 and 12 and the sugges-
tions on including children to teach your dog to respond to
everyone’s directions. Choose two to ten word cues that
you’ll use to direct your dog throughout the day. Speak in
clear, quick, bark-sounding tones, identifying what you want
the dog to do (like sit or come) or where you want the dog to
go (car, upstairs, kitchen). This gradually gets the dog into the
habit of accepting your leadership and direction, which also
helps eliminate any thoughts of aggression.
If your dog is already growling at you, get professional help. Your
dog’s aggression has escalated to a dangerous level and is beyond
the scope of this book.
Figuring Out Whether 
Neutering Helps
As in humans, boys and girls are different, and it’s not just a matter
of different plumbing systems. When it comes to canine aggres-
sion, the most common culprit is a male adolescent dog, and the
issue is usually related to dominance. Male dogs are 6.2 times more
likely to bite humans, and sexually intact dogs are 2.6 times more
likely to be involved in attacks than are neutered dogs.
Neutering is a way to take sex out of the picture by removing the
sex hormone-producing apparatus, which are testicles for males
and ovaries and uterus for females.
The male hormone testosterone is responsible for influencing a
number of dog behaviors, from territorial urine marking, to dog-to-
dog aggression, to roaming in order to stake territory and look for
a mate. Neutering vastly reduces testosterone levels, thus curbing
these behaviors.
Female sex hormones, on the other hand, affect her personality
only during her heat cycles, which usually occur twice a year. It’s
then that she’s most likely to urine mark and wander. Progesterone,
a hormone involved with the female cycle, has a generally calming
Part IV: Dogs Don’t Misbehave: Misperceptions and Solutions 
238

effect; however, it also stimulates a possessive or protective 
attitude toward her puppies, or anything that serves as a puppy
substitute, such as her toys or young children. Neutering stops 
this twice-yearly potential for aggression.
Least you think neutering is a cure-all, it rarely affects fear biting,
territorial aggression (the dog’s natural defensive reaction when
something comes near his home), or predatory aggression (which
is the tendency to chase things that run and to nip or bite them).
Neutering does affect the dog’s personality quite subtly in other
ways. Neutered dogs seem to pay more attention to people
because they’re paying less attention to sex-related activities of
other dogs. In addition, neutering a dog who is not yet an adult
seems to freeze personality development at that stage, at least 
in terms of keeping certain puppylike traits in place.
Because the optimal time to neuter a dog is just before puberty,
neutering becomes a useful tool if you have a dog breed where the
adult tends to have pronounced aggressive tendencies. Generally
speaking, the puppy is softer and less likely to show dominance and
other tendencies that can lead to aggression later. Thus, if you have
such a breed but like the pup’s personality at the age of six months,
subject to your veterinarian’s approval, it appears to be a good 
psychological reason why neutering should be done at that age.

Ten Forms of Silent
Communication
In This Chapter
 Using your body posture, eye contact, and signals to direct your dog.
 Bonding with your dog through silence and serenity
I
f your goal is to share your life with a dog who enjoys minding
you and prioritizes your opinion, you can influence your dog’s
behavior in many ways — all without saying a word.
Humans and dogs differ in communication style. People talk and
talk and talk. We learn by listening. Dogs, on the other hand, learn
by watching, taking direction by mirroring, and looking to others.
Because your dog can’t internalize your life experience, it’s your
responsibility to translate your message into a medium that she
can understand and relate to. In other words, be quiet and start
communicating silently.
Eye Contact
Your dog is clever, and she likes to interact and communicate 
with you. Your vocal responses, however, aren’t an ideal indicator
of your attention because you talk all day long. From her perspec-
tive, your eye contact is the surest determinant: eye contact, 
negative or positive, ensures your interaction.
If you’re looking at your dog, she’ll repeat the behavior that suc-
ceeded in getting your attention, again, 100 percent guaranteed.
Eye contact is so important that it influences your dog’s behavior
throughout the day. The following list shows you how simple eye
contact acknowledgement influences your dog’s behavior through-
out the day:

 Jumping: If you look at your dog when he jumps, he’ll jump
again. In fact, the main reason your dog is jumping is to see
whether he can get your attention. Whether you look at him
when you’re greeting him or when he approaches you while
you’re relaxing in your home, make sure that he has all four
paws on the floor before you say hello.
 Mealtime etiquette: If you look at your dog while you’re
eating, you’re inviting her to the feast. Is it any wonder that
your dog can find the one person willing to share and park
herself next to that chair? Better to feed your dog first, offer
her a bed to rest in and a toy to chew, and encourage every-
one to keep their eyes off the dog.
 Barking: If you look at your dog the instant she barks, guess
what? You’ll get a repeat performance. If you want a quiet dog,
focus on your dog when she’s quiet.
 Walking manners: Your leash walking goal is that your dog fol-
lows you on a loose leash and looks to you before responding
to distractions in your environment. If you’re following her, in
her opinion, you’re looking to her to interpret life experience.
 Door manners: Your door is the mouth of your den; whoever
orchestrates this vital entranceway is the leader. If you’re
standing behind your dog as you exit or you’re greeting
friends in her shadow, then guess what? In your dog’s mind,
you’re looking to her to lead. Your life will run smoother when
you teach your dog the direction “Back” and praise her for
responding to your lead.
 Counter cruising: Noting your interest in the counter, your
dog will likely jump up to have a look as soon as her legs are
long enough (or, if you have a large dog, she may be able to
just look down at the counter!). If this normal reaction is met
with immediate interaction, it will surely be repeated. Though
your interaction is confrontational, it surely beats watching
the clock tick. Focus on other behaviors, such as appropriate
chewing or ball tossing, and discourage your dog’s interest in
the counter with a discouragingly sharp “No.”
 Furniture jumping: If the idea of your dog on the furniture 
is less than appealing, take note of what your eyes may be
encouraging. Whether your tone is pleasant or off-putting, 
if your dog can get your attention by jumping on the couch,
rest assured it will become a daily amusement. Place a bed on
the floor and calmly discourage her by tugging her off with a
collar or leash. Focus your attention only when she’s resting
on the floor.
 Chasing behavior: If your dog runs after a child, cat, or car
and you’re left shouting after her, your eye contact and verbal
attention are backing her up.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
244

 Chewing behavior and the grab-n-go: The image is familiar:
Your dog grabs a forbidden object, trots just out of reach, and
waits for the inevitable chase. In the cartoons, it’s funny; in
real life, not so. But once again, your eye contact speaks
louder than words.
 Housesoiling: Many dogs are so lively and bored that they’ll
do anything that gets a rise out of someone, including peeing.
If your dog eliminates while staring you in the face and then
hangs out to watch the cleanup, your eye contact (once again)
is guaranteeing a repeat performance.
For more ideas on how to resolve these problems, please refer to
Part IV.
Body Posture
Your dog is even more attuned to your body posture than another
human is. Imagine seeing a loved one hunched over: Your immedi-
ate hesitation would be completely normal as you fumbled to help
them or inquired as to their dilemma.
The moment you hunch your body, your dog must interpret what,
if anything, is wrong with you and/or the situation. Other dogs
hunch for one of three reasons:
 They want to play.
 They’re scared.
 They’re investigating something interesting.
Here’s a quick tip to get your dog to come. Make a loud rancorous
shouting noise to alert your dog’s attention, but instead of beacon-
ing or chasing her, simply hunch over and scratch the ground.
Curiosity will ensure her participation.
Upright and relaxed is the ideal posture when directing your dog
or trying to influence her calm cooperation in stressful situations.
Touch
No one can argue the influence of a loving touch. Furthermore,
with dogs, touch symbolizes status: A respected, dominant dog is
permitted to sniff or prod her group members for no other reason
than a commitment to the group’s well-being.
Chapter 16: Ten Forms of Silent Communication 245

Choose a time when your dog is naturally calm and chaos is mini-
mal. Flatten your hand like a paddle and stroke your dog in long,
soothing strokes. Talk calmly as you do so and touch your dog’s
nose to tail. Though your dog’s paws are sensitive to touch, stroke
each individually; if she hesitates, treat your dog to ensure a more
positive association to toe touches.
Your Demeanor
Attitude is everything! Your dog learns, judges, and respects you
based not on what you say but how you act. This silent communi-
cation is ongoing 24/7: If you’re successful in playing the role of a
confident, self-assured leader, your dog will look to and respect
your direction. Fake this attitude even when you’re unsure what 
to do next.
When you’re teaching your dog a new routine or introducing her to
an unfamiliar circumstance, act comfortably familiar with the situa-
tion. Your assurance reassures your dog. Repeated directions, on
the other hand, confuse and may frighten her. Your silent example
will be all the reassurance she needs.
Plan your reactions to daily situations ahead of time so that you
limit your befuddlement and thus give your dog the reassurance
that you’re knowledgeable enough to handle and direct her
through all of life’s events.
Unresponsiveness
Your attention is your dog’s chief motivation in life, and he spends
hours targeting the behaviors that ensure your interaction. Without
this mutuality, your relationship couldn’t exist. If you can embrace
the power of your connection, then it’s easy to deduce that with-
drawing your attention can shape your dog’s behavior for the
better or worse.
Pay attention when she’s stolen a slipper, but ignore her when
she’s quietly chewing a bone, and it’s easy to predict which behav-
ior she’ll repeat. Ignore her when she calmly greets you with a toy,
but react to her when she acts like a jumping bean — guess what
she’s going to repeat?
Part V: The Part of Tens 
246

Outline the ideal responses to everyday situations, from chewing a
bone while you’re watching TV or fetching her ball when she wants
your attention, and then focus on this good behavior!
Sometimes the easiest solution to remedy negative behaviors is to
simply fold your arms in front of your face (which signals a with-
drawal in group interaction) or leave (promptly ending interac-
tion). The behavior that results in these responses will be quickly
abandoned in favor of what works!
Mirrored Motion
If you want to rile up anyone, person or dog, all you need to do is
jump around and act crazy. If you notice that your dog’s behavior
is often manic and out of control, look at your response. Does your
blood pressure escalate? If so, you’re mirroring your dog’s reac-
tion, which only makes matters more chaotic, not less. A better
approach is to reverse the trend:
 List times or situations that excite or stress your dog.
 Ahead of time, work on the directions “Back,” “Sit,” and “Stay,”
as detailed in Chapter 12.
 Either attach your dog to a full-length leash or leave a hand
leash on her for quick control (see Chapter 11).
If your dog is sensitive to sound distractions, such as the doorbell or
the vacuum, lead your dog on a leash and ask a helper to simulate
the sound periodically while you direct her nonchalantly. (If she’s
overexcited, read about red zones in Chapter 13.) Though she may
react excitedly initially, she will soon mirror your calmer response.
Looking at Your Dog Less
If you follow your dog around, inside or out, she’ll think you need a
lot of direction. For example, if she grabs objects or gravel and you
shout and chase her, in her mind, you’re playing a game. Her object
focus will not diminish, and neither will your frustration.
Your dog can learn by your example: Play with her toys, investigate
appropriate obstacles, such as a wood pile or rock outcropping, or
chase a squirrel. Choose an appropriate digging area or erect a
sandbox and play there until she joins you.
Chapter 16: Ten Forms of Silent Communication 247

Hand Signals
Dogs watch, people listen. Adjust your teaching to a medium your
dog is most comfortable with — incorporating hand signals with
your spoken directions. A dog who watches for direction is less
likely to wander out of sight. Here are a few hand signals to try:
 Sit: A hand sweep from above your dog’s nose to your eyes.
 Down: Pointing from your dog’s nose to floor between her paws.
 Come: A broad sweep across your chest and then a directed
point at your feet.
 Follow: A sharp slap of your thigh.
 Good: One or both arms thrown high in the air — the human
exclamation point.
Body Position
Whoever stands in front is in charge. When walking your dog near
roadways or in unfamiliar environments, teach her to follow your
lead. When the unpredictable happens, such as the approach of a
dog or stranger, she will automatically look to you and mirror your
response.
In addition, teach your dog to respect your authority at the 
doorways — what she considers the mouth of your den.
Teach your dog “Back” (in Chapter 12), using it before greeting 
visitors. Always encourage containment and focus before entering
and exiting.
Lure Touching
Imagine someone repetitively shouting directions at you — “Pass
the ketchup, the ketchup, the ketchup.” You’d neither want to
listen or cooperate, and an escalating tone would only make 
matters worse. Your dog feels the same way!
A far better approach to teaching your dog a new direction is to be
silent as you use food bits or a favorite toy to lure your dog into a
chosen position, such as “Sit,” or “Down,” as described in Chapter 12.
Once your dog is comfortable with the posture, you can associate 
a one-word cue with it. However, the real learning process occurred
in silence.

I
t seems that everyone believes that they understand dogs and
dog behaviors — at least well enough to get along with their
own pet. They base this belief on “facts” that they may have heard
from their parents, friends, and acquaintances.
Unfortunately, acting on such misinformation can result in bad 
outcomes, a sharp deterioration in trust, and possibly increased
aggression. In this chapter, we replace folk tales with fact.
True or false? In North America, one out of every four families lives
with a dog! True, true, true!
Every Dog Wants to Be 
Leader of the Pack
Dogs don’t have humanlike ambitions: Being No. 1 dog in their
family pack is more of a burden than an honor. The truth is that
dogs simply want their human pack members to assign them a
rank number and to make the decisions. With someone else
making the decisions, the dog doesn’t have to ever be on guard
and can now tend to the other matters on his agenda, such as an
afternoon nap or a game of fetch.

The rank in the pack doesn’t have to be earned by physical force.
A strong pack leader controls access to food, resting spots, and
water and has a stable mood. In fact, the only return this leader
expects is attention and respect from his group.
The simple act of making a dog work for everything he wants, such
as obeying a simple command like “Sit” before being given dinner,
or even being given a pat, tells him that you’re in charge.
Without an authority figure and adequate pack structure, your dog
will become quite stressed. This stress is the source of many dog
behavior problems. These problems come about because the dog
thinks, “If no one in my pack is in charge, then someone must make
the decisions, and the only one left is me.” Thus, the unwilling dog
is forced into a position of leadership. He must then be ever vigi-
lant and becomes pushy, dominant, and even aggressive.
A Wagging Tail Means a 
Happy and Friendly Dog
A wagging tail signifying a friendly dog is one of the most common
misunderstandings about dog behavior. Actually, the wag of a dog’s
tail can signal many things, depending upon its speed and the way
the tail is carried.
A happy tail wag is actually a submissive gesture and one that 
is often paired with a lower rump, which seems to drag the hips
with each swing. Translated, it says, “You have my respect, and 
I know that you won’t hurt me.” A dog giving this signal is quite
approachable.
Contrast that broad tail wag with one where the dog’s tail is held
high over his back and the tail movements involve very short side
to side swings at a high speed. This is the tail wag of a dominant
dog who is saying, “Back off! Give me space!”
For a more thorough description of tail interpretation, refer to
Chapter 3.
Dogs Understand Human Language
How many patient pets have listened to the constant diatribes of
their well-meaning owners: “How many times have I told you not 
to get on the sofa? Behavior like that is simply not acceptable, and
you’re making me very angry. I don’t want you to do that again.”
Part V: The Part of Tens 
250

Ask the person, and he may claim that his dog knows well and good
what he’s talking about. Ask the dog, but she’ll likely be snoring.
Dogs can learn specific words that humans speak, with the average
dog capable of learning around 165 words and/or signals. In addition,
dogs are very attuned to tone of voice and instinctively pair it to an
emotional state, thus people with deep voices are often given rever-
ence, whereas doting, placating family members are often ignored.
A dog, no matter how intelligent, can’t process full grammatical
sentences.
A Fearful Dog Won’t Bite
A dog cringing in fear is a sorry sight. The average person may 
feel drawn to the scene and eager to help, but few consider this
frightened animal a threat. Approaching this dog, however, is a 
bad move. This dog fears for his life and will likely bite without
warning or hesitation. When fear biters bite, they bite hard.
Fearful animals are, in fact, more likely to bite than dominant 
animals.
Panic drives fearful dogs to do anything to reduce the presence of
a threat. Further, when you retreat from a dominant dog, he’ll stop
any further threat of aggression: In essence, you did what he
asked. When you retreat from a fearful dog, however, he may still
rush and snap as your presence is still a potential threat. He’s
afraid that you may still return to hurt him, so his emotions may
well swamp any logical thinking about the situation.
You should view all frightened animals as potentially aggressive.
Dogs Know When They’ve 
Done Wrong
Here’s the scene. You enter your home, and Rover looks at you,
glances toward the kitchen, and then runs and hides. You walk into
the kitchen, and trash is strewn all over the place — evidence that
once again, your pet has been looking for edibles in the garbage.
Your conclusion is obvious: Rover was feeling guilty because he
messed with the trash can, and he knew that he’d done something
bad, which is why he is hiding from you.
Unfortunately, your obvious conclusion is wrong. Remember, dogs
have the mind equivalent of a 2- to 21/2 -year-old human.
Chapter 17: Ten Common Misunderstandings 251

Feelings of guilt don’t appear until around 4 years of age in
humans, and notions of right and wrong may not be fully formed
even in adults.
So what’s going on here? Your dog has learned that when trash is
on the floor and you enter the house, bad things happen to dogs.
He has no notion that he has any responsibility for the connection.
He’s simply showing fear for the punishment that he anticipates
may occur.
If your dog has such a trash problem and you still believe that your
dog feels guilt, strew some trash on the kitchen floor yourself, let
Rover see it, and then leave the house for five minutes. When you
return, you’ll see your dog cringing in the same manner that you
call guilt, even though he knows that he’s not responsible.
Dogs Sometimes Behave 
Out of Spite
Maggie has been out running errands all day while her dog Buddy
was home alone. When she finally comes home, she finds the sofa
cushions chewed to shreds. When her husband comes in from
work, she explains, “Buddy was so upset that I left him for so 
long that out of spite and revenge, he destroyed our furniture.”
It’s a nice story, but wrong. Spite is another late developing emo-
tion, like guilt, and the minds of dogs (equivalent to a human 2
year old) never reach that stage. Buddy chewed the cushions out
of boredom. If he’d had something more interesting to chew on,
like a beef shank bone or a peanut butter–filled chew toy, Maggie’s
sofa would still be intact.
Another reason dogs choose to destroy or carry objects is that
they may have your scent. Objects with the strongest scent are apt
to be objects that you use frequently, so you naturally believe that
the dog has deliberately chosen that object to distress or annoy
you. However, this behavior is driven by a longing for your com-
pany, not a spiteful reaction to your departure.
Dogs Hate Cats
Dogs naturally chase cats, but this reaction isn’t motivated by
hatred. Dogs evolved from predators that chased, killed, and ate a
lot of small animals, although their ready access to the food that
we provide has diminished their killing instinct. Term it call of the
Part V: The Part of Tens 
252

wild or simple fun, dogs naturally chase any animal that runs from
them — including cats. Sighthounds and terriers are the breeds
most likely to chase cats.
Unlike other wild prey, however, when trapped, a cat will turn and
fight. Such a confrontation is noisy and dangerous for both ani-
mals, and if you’ve experienced such an event, you’d certainly
remember it. However, if you look at the statistics, you’ll note 56
percent of dog owners also own cats, and they happily coexist,
meaning that harmony between the species is within your reach.
Dogs Like It When You Hug Them
Most dogs don’t enjoy being hugged. It’s nothing personal, but as
part of their wild heritage, dogs interpret any restriction of motion
as threatening because running from trouble is their first line of
defense. Though most dogs will tolerate a strong pat or quick arm
hold, a full hug may be too restraining.
Teach your children how to interact with dogs properly. Encourage
your children to reach out their hands to allow a dog to sniff it. If
the dog turns away, your children should, too. If the dog sniffs
their hand calmly, show your children the appropriate way to
stroke and pet them, but enforce absolutely no hugs!
Your Stress Has No 
Effect on Your Dog
Most people believe that their stress level has no effect on their
pet’s well-being and look to their pets as potential sources of stress
relief for their human family. Though scientific data has confirmed
that petting a dog does relieve stress, studies also show that your
state of tension and anxiety can affect your dog as well.
When you’re anxious, you emit scents called pheromones that
signal your current psychological state to your dog. When stress
scents are emitted, your dog will search for the source of danger
that is causing your agitated state. His activity level may rise, as 
he becomes anxious and ill at ease. He may even think that your
stress has been caused by something that he did. Your tension
thus becomes your dog’s tension, too.
Dogs are masters at reading body language, too. They can detect
your mood by looking at your posture and the way that you move.
Chapter 17: Ten Common Misunderstandings 253

Avoid working with your dog when you’re stressed. Use this time
to relax or play games that may lighten your mood before you train
or do other work with your pet.
Dogs’ Licks Are Kisses
Probably one of the most enduring and widespread myths about
dog behavior is that a dog’s lick is the equivalent of a kiss. Actually,
a dog’s lick can have many meanings, and affection and greeting
are only two.
Perhaps the most common meaning comes from a dog’s early 
evolutionary history. In the wild, when a mother wolf returns from
hunting, she has already fed herself. When she enters the den, the
puppies gather around her and begin to lick her face. To a roman-
tic, this gesture may look like expressions of love — with all the
puppies overjoyed at mother’s return. The actual purpose of this
face licking, however, is much more functional.
Wild canines have a well-developed regurgitation reflex. Young
puppies who are no longer nursing lick their mother’s face and lips
to cause her to vomit up food. This partially digested material is
easy for the mother to transport and makes ideal dining for young
puppies.
So the next time your dog is licking your face, ask yourself whether
he’s hungry. Perhaps he’s simply asking for something to eat. Of
course, humans, being easily flattered, often reward what they per-
ceive as loving attention with a snack. And so it comes full circle.

Control the Resources
In any group of dogs, the leader controls the resources, from food,
to choice resting areas, to drinking locations. Because your dog
views your relationship as though you (and your family) were
other dogs, emphasize this authority by organizing structured
feeding times, even hand-feeding a portion of your dog’s meal to
accentuate your authority.
Teach Your Dog to Mind 
Her Manners
Ordering anyone about, whether you’re a dog or person, is poor
form. “Get this, do that, scratch my back, over here!” — a person
who made these epithets would be quickly put in their place, and
yet many dogs get away with saying as much with their behavior.
Assess how your dog demands your attention: pawing you, whin-
ing, scratching your arm, or staring. You must stop these unruly
interactions must stop; you’re enabling your dog’s incivility.

Before offering your dog anything she would consider a treat (food,
your attention, toys), instruct her to sit. If she ignores you, posi-
tion her calmly and then continue your interaction.
Each time she requests your attention, instruct her to sit until her
manners improve to the level that she’ll automatically sit when-
ever she wants something.
Reserve High Places for Humans
Woe is the temptation to invite your dog into your bed. An extra
warm body on a cold wintery night — they didn’t call them “three
dog nights” up north for nothing! That said, however, your dog
may read a lot into your resting positions. Young dogs and those
who are showing aggression should be level trained. This formula
highlights that you rest on higher sleeping ground — a bed or couch,
in essence, being equivalent to a mound or hill. Your elevated level
commands respect.
As your dog matures, and her respect for your direction improves,
you may invite her to join you on permission. (Any sign of aggres-
sion would preclude this honor.) Teach your dog to “Sit and wait”
and then encourage her to lie in one space by tapping that spot
and saying “Up, up.”
Your dog may inch her way up to your pillow or the back edge of
the couch. Don’t allow her to do so. Designate one area ahead of
time. If she excites or rearranges herself, tell her “Off” and direct
her back to her own bed on the floor.
Emphasize Your Right of Way
The most common and passive way dogs organize a hierarchy is
through spatial definition. If you catch yourself stepping over or
around your dog, or changing direction as not to avoid her, you’re
paying homage to her presence. Leadership (at this point) isn’t
within your grasp.
To reclaim your authority, teach your dog the definition of “Excuse
me.” Every time your dog crosses your path (on a walk, stairway,
or about the house), calmly but clearly say, “Excuse me” and
knudge her out of your way. You may need to bump your dog with
your knees or scotch your feet under her body until she moves.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
256

So be it. One of you must move about the other: If your goal is lead-
ership, don’t defer. As long as your dog cooperates, you don’t need
to do anything else other than just move along nonchalantly.
If your dog’s chosen resting spots are blocking your footpath, the
same rules apply. If you walk around her, you’re saying that you
are more aware of her than she needs to be of you. The result?
Your dog will consistently place herself in your pathway in order to
get attention and redefine your spatial respect. In this case, it’s far
easier to teach your dog to lie at the specified location or along the
edge of the room.
Does your dog trip you on the stairs, slide in front of you during a
walk, or position himself in front of the TV or the stove? These
actions are as rude as a loved one stretching out to work or exer-
cise in the middle of your stairway or kitchen floor. You owe it to
your dog to teach her better manners!
Use Time-Outs to Control 
Unruly Behavior
Bringing your dog to her crate, small room, or station calmly isn’t
punishment unless your inappropriate behavior makes it so.
The calm act of escorting your dog to her kennel, station, or quiet
room is a very acceptable way to handle normal frustrations.
Losing your temper is far worse than to separate and regroup.
If you feel your frustration coming on, with no improvement in
your dog’s behavior, don’t hesitate to put your dog in a time-out.
Grab a favorite toy for your dog, direct him by voice or collar, and
simply say, “Time out, my love,” as you seclude him. Your author-
ity to make these decisions and isolate your dog when she’s unruly
is both respectable and required. The duration of time out will be
determined by how long it takes you to calm down, and whether
your dog naps or is restless. These quiet times should not be more
than 30 minutes, unless your dog is resting.
You can also use time-outs to help children control their impulses
around the dog/puppy, too. In this case, simply remind the chil-
dren that when a situation gets out of hand, the dog will need to
go to her quiet space (which in truth, she’ll probably welcome),
but that if they cooperate, you’ll reward them with a sticker or
other prize.
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Become Your Dog’s Leader 257

Here are several times when a time-out can help ease the situation:
 If your dog/puppy is getting overly excited with a situation.
Isolate her with a displacement bone or toy.
 If an outdoor situation is overstimulating your dog, causing
frantic barking, pacing or patrolling.
 When children interactions are getting out of hand.
 If you suspect that her inattention or poor behavior may be
due to exhaustion. Puppies nip the hardest when they’re 
overtired.
Empathize
Your dog wants to be understood and, above all, be respected for
her life experience. An ounce of empathy can give you a special
rapport with your dog. Once you can imagine life from her per-
spective, you can tailor your direction and become the leader
you’d want to have if you were in the same situation.
Consider life from your dog’s perspective. Why does your dog jump,
for example? If jumping occurs during greeting, she’s trying to get
closer to your face, as is a normal canine ritual. Shouting or knee-
ing her introduces confrontational energy between you. Don’t go
there. Instead, consider your dog’s reaction and what she may be
trying to communicate and then comprise a direction that satisfies
her needs while maintaining a structured home life. See Table 18-1
for examples of possible redirections.

Organize Space and Activities
A good leader, like a good team captain or parent, organizes the
space and activities of those she’s responsible for. Organization
leaves little to question and provides a tremendous sense of secu-
rity and calm.
Help your dog organize where to go and what to do in every situa-
tion, from family time activities, to meals, to a visitor’s arrival.
Consider your life’s flow and organize a game plan for each situa-
tion. What should your dog do, for example, when you come in
from errands? Where should she go, and what should she do when
you’re watching TV, or playing with the children on the swings?
Consider Table 18-2 and copy it or add to it.

roundings. Offer a toy or chew

Practice Full Body Handling
It’s the leader’s prerogative and responsibility to physically check her
group members. Other dogs know this fact and will allow a domi-
nant dog to thoroughly examine their body. In your vigil to assume
authority, physically touch your dog each day, from head to toe.
Your daily attention to your dog’s body allows you to note any
growths, parasites, or skin alterations. Bring anything suspect to
your veterinarian’s attention.
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Become Your Dog’s Leader 259

Restore Predictability
Dogs enjoy predictability: Connecting to an experience when their
role is defined. Your dog feels most safe in your home when pre-
dictability reigns, distractions are low, and your mood is stable.
Though you may enjoy a more spontaneous schedule, your dog
will not. Like a young child, he enjoys eating, toileting, and playing
at similar intervals.
If you work during the day and your dog is left alone, hire a dog
walker who you can call in case an emergency precludes you from
getting home at your usual hour. Though your dog can’t read the
time, his biological clock highlights your arrival time. If you don’t
make it home, your dog may soil or become destructive.
Highlight the Positive
Consider playing on a team. Would you choose a captain that 
belittled your weakness or exalted your strengths? A benevolent
leader plays a similar role: Emphasize your dog’s good qualities
and cooperative behavior, and she’ll be a cheerful member of your
family circle. For each negative behavior you encounter, establish a
positive alternative.
