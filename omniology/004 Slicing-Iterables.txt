itertools.islice
We know that we can slice sequence types
seq[i:j:k]
seq[slice(i, j, k)]
We can also slice general iterables (including iterators of course)
竊段slice(iterable, start, stop, step)
竊段slice returns a lazy iterator
l = [1, 2, 3, 4]
result = islice(l, 0, 3)
from itertools import islice
list(result)
竊端1, 2, 3]
list(result)
竊端]
even though l was a list!
