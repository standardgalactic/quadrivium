A PICTORIAL HISTORY
OF THE WESTERN FILM


M INTRODUCTION TO
SEVENTY YEARS OF WESTERNS
As
these
introductory
notes
are
written,
the Western
film
is well over seventy years old. During that consid-
erable span
it has undergone continual changes of em-
phasis to appeal to a juvenile audience in one era, an
adult one
in
another.
It has had to adjust to techno-
logical changes within the film and reshape itself to fight
off the
inflation of rising production
costs.
It has seen
itself apparently bite the dust on the theatre screen only
to be reincarnated on television.
It has even seen
itself
produced en masse in Germany, Yugoslavia, and Spain.
The Europeans have seen the Western as a major con-
tribution to American art and culture, as integral a part
of American folklore as the Odyssey
is of the Greeks'.
And
to American audiences, the Western, whatever
its
form-humble "B" feature, grand-scale epic in color and
widescreen,
or
thirty-minute
television
potboiler—has
always
remained
one
of
the
most
reliable
staples
of
movie
entertainment.
Regardless
of
super-heroes
and
spacemen, there
is a period in every child's
life when a
cowboy on a galloping horse
is the most exciting vision
imaginable; and as long as the John Fords and the Henry
Kings
(and, of course, the John Waynes)
are there to
wrest poetry, beauty, and drama from a fairly restricted
genre, the Western will work
its magic on the adult too.
Perhaps the most surprising thing is not that Hollywood
has been able to draw such variety and inspiration from
one geographic location and a
set of rigid
cliches, but
that
it has been able to do so, to the tune of thousands

of films,
for so long. Germany, after
all, has made but
intermittent use
of
its Wagnerian legends
as
film ma-
terial; Britain's parallel to the Jesse James era, its Robin
Hood period, has admittedly been
well-exploited
cine-
matically, but nowhere to the same extent as American
western
history,
while
its
colorful
Civil War
(King
Charles
1
versus
Cromwell)
has
been
almost
totally
ignored, even though
it contains the same potential for
drama,
action and
sentiment
as America's
Civil War.
Yet
for
seventy
years now,
the American movie has
made box-office hay out of the "Wild West"—a period
surrounding and containing the
rise of the great
cattle
empires,
and
in
terms
of
duration,
less than half the
time-span
already devoted
to
it by the movies.
Despite this long and honorable history, however, the
Western as a genre has never been accorded the respect
it
really
deserves.
The
critics
will
rightly
praise
the
beauty of a major John Ford production, and then dis-
miss the great mass of remaining films with an "if you've
seen one, you've seen them all" sneer and a snide sum-
ming-up
of alleged
cliches. But when one
tries to pin
down these cliches,
it
is amazing how elusive they can
be. A major TV network, doing a documentary on the
Western
a few years back, thought
it might be fun to
edit together a number of scenes of a character pointing
off-screen and telling the sheriff, "They went thattaway!"
as
being the epitome
of cliched Western
story-telling.
But while
it's a useful line by which the uninformed can
"prove"
their point,
it
isn't a
line that has
really been
used
that much, and the
television documentary,
after
much
fruitless
screening, had
to
get along without
it.
If there is one key line that the "B" Westerns have used
incessantly,
it
is
that
classic
last-reel resolution by the
defeated
villains,
"Let's get outta here!" But
it doesn't

have
the same easy Western
ring to
it as "They went
thattaway!" and
its omnipresence
in so many Westerns
would in any case not be apparent to critics, who rarely
see the "B" products.
As recently as April, 1969, a New York Sunday News
article on the changing styles in the Western commented
that contemporary movie cowboys are "... non-heroes
and obsessed by sex
.
.
. ," a statement that ignores the
fact
that
with
the
possible exception
of John Wayne,
there are no more movie cowboys as such, merely actors
(Brando, Fonda, Holden) who occasionally appear
in
individual Westerns. The same
article, summing up the
old-time cowboy hero
in one convenient
if inaccurate
phrase, added that in earlier days "the hero would kiss
his
faithful
horse and
ride
off alone
into the
sunset."
This again
is a fallacy that has been repeated so many
times that
it has been accepted as part of the unwritten
law ruling the making of Westerns, but
it just isn't sup-
ported by
the
facts. William
S. Hart,
it
is
true, had a
deep
affection
for
his
horses,
partly because
it came
naturally to him, and partly because he recognized the
very
real comradeship between a man and his horse in
the early days of the West, and tried to show
it in his
movies. But he rarely kissed his horse in a movie, and
then only
in moments of such dramatic stress (when he
had been
rejected by humans, leaving his horse as his
only true friend, or when, as in Pinto Ben, the horse was
dying)
that
such
an
emotional
gesture would be
ac-
ceptable. But Hart certainly never once kissed his horse
before riding off alone into the sunset, or as a substitute
for feminine caresses. Hart's leading ladies were always
well and
truly kissed,
usually well before the fadeout.
Furthermore, he was such a romanticist that the number
of films in which he died, or rode off alone for the fade-
THE gun: Gary Cooper

Artists,
1952)

THE crime:
George Barnes
in The Great Train Robbery
(Edison, 1903)
out, were
very much
in
the
minority, and he
usually
wound up with the heroine
as his bride. This,
in
fact,
applies
to
almost
all
of the cowboy heroes,
since the
heroine's love was the only concrete reward they could
hope
to
gain
for
all
of
their
Herculean
labors
and
courage.
Romance, certainly, was seldom stressed in Westerns,
any more than
it was in the equally innocent comedies
of Harold
Lloyd, Harry Langdon and Buster Keaton.
But
it was present, often a definite plot motivation, and
most of the cowboy heroes kissed their heroines
if not
regularly, then at least frequently. Stars like Buck Jones
who made fairly realistic Westerns and had an adult as
well as juvenile following never had any qualms about a
climactic
kiss. The other stars, whose appeal was more
to juveniles and who followed a very rigid code of con-
duct,
tended
to
apologize
for
their
lack
of romantic
ardor by making a joke of it. While Gene Autry did kiss
Irene Manning in one of his earlier Westerns, thereafter
he saw to
it that any such activity took place off-screen
or quite inadvertently, as when he and his leading lady
would be pushed into an embrace by the nudgings of an
obliging and match-making horse.
Another
cliche
that
has
been much misunderstood
(and
its application exaggerated)
is that of the white-
Stetsoned hero and the black-hatted villain. Admittedly,
such distinctions are an easy way of symbolizing good
and
evil, but
this
line of reasoning doesn't hold much
water when one realizes just how many heroes have used
black
as
their
basic costume
color
too.
(At one time
a
moustache
was
equally
a dead
giveaway
as
to
its
wearer's
villainous and probably
also lecherous make-
up.
)
There were subtler differences than
just the con-
trast between black and white. The villain's clothes, for
example, were
usually
well-tailored, often
ostentatious,
implying an affluence which (since
it was not shared by
other
townspeople, who
were
compelled
to
dress
in
standard
Western garb)
could
only
be
supported by

THE crime:
Walter Miller
in
Fugitive
Sheriff (Columbia,
1936)
illicit
activity.
Distinctive costuming made
it
easier
to
keep tabs on who was who
in the long shots and
fast-
action scenes,
it made
it simpler to use doubles without
the deception becoming obvious
(a wide-brimmed hat
can
hide
an
awful
lot
of
face!), and
too,
it made
it
possible to re-use footage in later films,
if the new actors
wore matching clothes.
Considering the fairly standardized action content of
the Western—the chase, the
fist-fight, the gun duel, the
stampede— it
is
surprising
how
so
few
basic
ingre-
dients
have
been
pressed
into
service
to
flesh
out
a
dozen or more other basics in actual plot-lines. Far from
being
all the same, the Western has in fact managed to
offer far more story variation than
its Japanese parallel,
the
Samurai
film. The
pioneering themes—the wagon
train or cattle herd trek or the building of a railroad-
have of course occupied a large percentage of the plots.
But most of the story-lines have depended on villainy for
their precise motivation, since the hero's activities have
remained quite constant. And when the villain's perfidy
included a lecherous yen for the heroine (oddly enough,
he was usually sufficiently conventional to want to marry
her,
despite her obvious distaste for him)
then a
little
more variety was added.
Discounting
the
pioneering and
epic
themes,
most
Western
plots
fall
into one
of twelve groups.
First,
of
course,
there
is
the
Sin Town
masterminded
by
the
villain from his gambling casino. Despite the enormous
profits from
his always crooked games, he
can't
resist
such extra-curricular
activities
as stage-robbing,
cattle-
rustling and claim-jumping. This kind of catch-all plot
allowed for both a straightforward action approach, or a
semi-historical foray which tried to parallel the activities
of Wyatt Earp or Bat Masterson. Dodge
City, Dead-
wood,
Nevada
City,
Wichita,
Tombstone,
Brimstone,
Waco and a dozen other frontier helltowns were cleaned
up a score of times by Hollywood heroes ranging from
Richard Dix to Roy Rogers.

More often than
not, however, the villain was more
of a specialist, with a specific aim
in view. Establishing
a vast cattle empire (and
in so doing, terrorizing all the
other ranchers so that they'd move out or
sell out) was
an idea that was more a specialty of the villains of bigger
Westerns (Joseph Calleia
in Wyoming) although by no
means
beyond
the
range
of
lesser
names.
However,
carving an empire required a certain dignity and polish;
among the "B" Western heavies, Walter Miller could get
away with
it—but Fred Kohler couldn't.
Sometimes
an
element
of
mystery
might
creep
in,
with even
the hero
baffled by
the meaningless
killings
and reigns of terror designed to force ranchers off their
apparently
worthless
land.
Audiences
however, knew
that the solution would have to be one of three possibili-
ties:
one
section
of land
controlled
the water
for
the
valley, and the heavy was
after
total
acquisition of
all
the water rights; gold or other mineral deposits had been
discovered by
the
villain on
land other than
his own;
or, and this was the most likely, the railroad was about
to come through and
it was imperative
that the heavy
own
the
entire
district,
so
that
the
railroad would be
forced to pay his price.
The deliberate sabotaging of progress made the villain

(First National, 1921)

doubly
despicable:
unpatriotic
as
well
as
greedy. He
might be wrecking the telegraph lines to protect his own
stagecoach
(and news-carrying)
business, or he might
be out
to prevent the honest citizens from voting their
territory
into
the
Union,
knowing
that
such
a move
would
bring law and
order, and an end
to
his
profit-
able
regime.
The simplest plot device of
all of course was for the
Texas Ranger or U.S. marshal hero to pose as a bad-
man, join the outlaw gang, and work from the inside to
bring about their downfall—a gimmick that added sus-
pense to the normal action values and was valid enough
to work
in big city crime thrillers too.
Republic Pictures in particular was especially fond of
what one
might term
the
"Reconstruction" Western-
stories set
in the immediate post-Civil War period, with
corrupt
politicians and guerillas legally taking over de-
feated
territories,
and
plundering them
via
excessive
taxes. Republic used this one basic plot scores of times
for
all of
its Western heroes.
Stirring up the Indians was another old reliable. Since
the
basic
villainy was centered
in
the white trader or
crooked Indian agent who plied the redmen with liquor
and guns and assured them that the Great White Father

in Washington spoke with a forked tongue,
it was easy
to use the Indians (and inexpensive stock shots) for all
sorts
of mayhem,
and
then
send them on
their way,
somewhat
decimated,
at
the end
of
the
film with
an
understanding pat on the head, the white heavy having
by then received his just deserts.
Having the hero returning (or escaping) from jail to
prove his innocence and trap the real culprits was a ploy
used mainly by the more serious Western stars, such as
Buck Jones and George O'Brien.
Others,
like William
Boyd
and
Gene
Autry,
with
a
more
predominantly
juvenile
audience, were anxious
to avoid having
their
heroes
burdened,
even
if
innocently,
with
a
jailbird
stigma. And
in any case, such plots usually required a
the Army,
invariably
led to a race between the equip-
ment
and
horses
of
the good
guys
and
those
of the
villains (who of course, had an ample supply of hench-
men
like Edmund Cobb and Tom London to sabotage
their opponents). Such themes were especially popular
at Republic, since their climactic excitement provided a
field day for Yakima Canutt and his unique organization
of stuntmen.
And
last
but
far from
least,
there was
another old
faithful—the hero's determined search for the murderer
of
his
father. This theme became almost
a
fetish with
Bob
Steele, who
in picture
after picture grew to man-
hood
relentlessly
seeking
revenge.
In The Man From
Hell's Edges
it seemed that he had
struck
a
distinctly

little more serious acting as the hero faced local ostra-
cism, which
in turn reduced
the
action
potential
too.
There was a
lot of mileage to be gained from family
feuds and range wars between sheepmen and cattlemen.
Few Westerns had the sheer guts of To the Last Man
(a Zane Grey adaptation), which made no bones about
two clans hating each other and ultimately wiping each
other
out.
Usually
the
ploy was
to have an unknown
villain prodding the feud along for his own selfish ends.
The
trials and
tribulations of running stagecoach or
freight lines, or of getting a contract to supply horses to
novel
note. The
film was
pleasantly straightforward m
its pitting of the forces of good against those of Western
skulduggery, and
in
the
final
reel Bob
bests
the
chief
villain
in the traditional
fistic set-to. But seconds before
the
climactic
clinch
and
"End"
title,
he
springs
the
bombshell
:
the man he had just brought to book was,
in addition to his other crimes, the man who had killed
his
father!
During the mid-thirties, there was also a curious but
very
entertaining rash
of. movies about the making of
Westerns; Charles Starrett as a pampered Western star
8

not allowed to ride a horse
in The Cowboy Star, Gene
Autry and Buck Jones as stuntmen doubles
in The Big
Show
and Hollywood Roundup
respectively,
Richard
Dix
as
a washed-up cowboy
star who makes
a come-
back
in
It Happened in Hollywood, George O'Brien as
a Western star accidentally involved in a real range war
in Hollywood Cowboy, and later on, Gene Autry again
as
a double who
rises
to
stardom,
in Shooting High.
There were
others,
all
of them
entertaining,
oflf-beat,
and often far more accurate
in their depiction of work-
ing Hollywood than many much bigger productions. In
the mid-forties there was a brief resurgence of this cycle,
but on a less interesting level: Republic made a number
of movies.
Bells of Rosarita being the most typical,
in
ences at least, the only respectable way to end any West-
ern. When
a Western introduced
its
fight early
in the
proceedings the rules seemed to have been broken, and
the climax, no matter how exciting or spectacular
in a
non-fistic
manner,
seemed
to
be
sadly
lacking.
If
a
Western was generous enough
to have two
fights, then
it was considered a classic;
if
it had no
fisticuflfs at
all,
then
it was beneath contempt and provoked loud boos.
Considering how well-known
these
basic requirements
were,
it
is surprising how often the cheaper Hollywood
Western
producers,
outfits
like
Crescent and
Puritan,
flaunted the public's expectations by constantly deliver-
ing Westerns
with no
action
at
all.
In
the
forties,
as
Westerns became more and more mass-produced, there
THE OFT-FILMED TALE:
Pedro Armendariz, Harry Carey,
Jr., and John Wayne
in Three Godfathers (MGM,
1948)
which
all
of
its currently
active Western
stars played
themselves and
left their studio in the lurch while they
went to help Roy Rogers in his perennial battle against
Grant Withers and Roy Barcroft!
Within
the framework
of these
plot-lines, the action
itself was often
allotted certain
specific uses. The run-
away stagecoach or wagon was, for example, a perfect
way
for boy
to meet
girl. And,
initially,
the
big
fight
between hero and villain
(preferably
after a horseback
chase, although an on-foot encounter in the saloon was
almost as acceptable) was considered, by juvenile audi-
was
little
to complain about
in the action department.
They were
literally
all
fights and
chases. At
the PRC
studios. Buster Crabbe only had to saunter into a saloon
and Charles King would remark, "Stranger,
I don't like
your face," instantly provoking a vigorous
if somewhat
unconvincing
fight.
It
is only these latter-day, poverty-row Westerns that
justify
in any way the dismissal of the "B" Western as
just a collection of cliches. The standardization of plot-
lines had, of course, been growing slowly throughout the
thirties,
as more "B" Westerns were made, and as pro-

DOC holliday's women:
Cesar Romero and Nancy Kelly
in Frontier Marshall (Fox,
1939)
duction costs rose, making
it imperative that they
all be
made
more
quickly
and
more
economically.
This
in-
crease
in haste can also be seen in the carelessness with
which
titles
were
selected.
In
the
silent
period,
most
Westerns had titles directly applicable to their plot con-
tent. As the thirties arrived, there was a definite increase
in
the
number
of
ambiguous
titles:
Riders
of
the
Rockies,' Gunsmoke
Trail, Phantom
Ranger,
West
of
the Pecos. None of these
titles had any direct relation-
ship
to
the
films they
graced,
but on
the
other hand,
they weren't exactly unrelated either. The musical West-
erns provided further leeway:
Sierra Sue, Ridin Down
the Canyon
and
In Old Monterey
(which was
ultra-
modern and went nowhere near Monterey!)
were not
backed up by any characters, action or locations in their
respective movies, but those
title songs were sung some-
where along the way. Many Westerns of the forties had
even more nebulous connections with their
titles. Cov-
ered Wagon Days implied a historically-oriented tale of
pioneer
days,
but
it dealt with
a goldmine and claim-
jumpers, with nary a covered wagon in sight. Zorro was
never once referred
to,
let alone seen,
in Zorro s Black
Whip, Billy was likewise invisible in Captive of Billy the
Kid,
and
The Phantom
Plainsmen seems
to
be even
more
a case of pinning the
tail on the donkey.
Oddly enough one rather spectacular cliche—far more
remarkable than any number of "They went thattaway"
utterances-was born in the "B" Western of the thirties,
and stayed with
it
until
its death
in
1954. The heroine
was,
almost
without
exception,
a
biological freak—the
oflFspring of but a single (male) parent. Western leading
ladies
never
had
mothers.
Occasionally,
when
hard-
pressed,
a sympathetic father might
utter, "Oh,
if only
your mother were
alive
.
.
. ," but that cursory nod
to
maternity
apart,
the
mother
was
literally
obliterated
from the West. The reasons, of course, were economic,
not
genetic. A
mother
could
never perform
a
useful
function
in
a
Western.
Father
could
be
robbed
or
cheated, used as a lever to force his daughter into mar-
riage,
or
killed
ofT,
thus
leaving
the
heroine
entirely
10

dependent on
the
hero. Even
a
little brother or
sister
could be of some value; they could be kidnapped by the
villain
(as
in Moonlight on the
Prairie)
or better
still
they might be crippled (as in Heart of the Rockies and
Arizona Badman) and
subject
to frequent beatings by
an
evil stepfather, thus paving the way for intervention
by
the
hero.
But
the mother could perform no such
useful
function.
She
couldn't even have
babies,
since
pregnancies were unheard of
in "B" Westerns and any
babies
that were
seen were
either
survivors
of Indian
attacks, or orphans suddenly dumped in the hero's lap.
Mothers couldn't be
killed
off,
either, since that might
be emotionally upsetting to the small fry. In other words,
she
was
totally
useless,
eating up
$200
of
character
actress money that could be
better employed paying a
stuntman for a horse
fall. So the mother of the heroine
remained a non-existent figure in the small-budget West-
erns,
rearing her unnecessary head only once,

Maynard's

But
then Maynard was
always an unpredictable and innovational Western prac-
titioner who could be counted on to come up with the
unusual.
It was
television that restored Mother to her
throne
in
the Western, and
did
so with
a vengeance.
Realizing
that
it
is mother who buys
the

other
goodies
that
the commercials bombard her

spring with,
television couldn't afford to slight her. Far
from just re-establishing her within the family as a figure
that TV-watching moms could
identify
with, television
put her on a pedestal, typified best by Barbara Stanwyck
as an aggressive, entirely self-reliant head of a pioneer-
ing family in the Big Valley series.
Certainly the Western over
its seventy-year history—
and
especially
in
the
last
forty
of
those
years—has
clung rigorously to a well-tried set of characters, story-
lines and situations. But perhaps this
is tradition rather
than cliche. After
all,
if we apply the same standards to
the seasons of the year, spring
is very definitely a cliche.
It comes along relentlessly at the same time every year,
always without change,
the same old
re-vitalized
fresh
air, the same old colors in the countryside, the same old
flowers. We
neither want nor expect change, and love
it
for the same reasons that most of us love the West-
ern—for its beauty, simplicity, and invigorating qualities.
The perennial popularity of the Western, over and above
specific box-office cycles, can perhaps be ascribed to the
fact that
it represents
a way of
life that has become a
legend but
is
still
sufficiently close to our own time for
us
to know
that
it was a
reality. As time
passes, our

knowledge of the hardships of those days fades, and the
good things stand out in greater contrast. Hemmed in as
we are on
all sides—involvement
in wars, strikes,
racial
and social controversy,
travel restrictions, bureaucracy,
taxes,
a countryside
littered with beer cans and adver-
tising
billboards,
city
air
polluted
by
chemicals
and
smog— it
is reassuring and revitalizing to look back to a
period less than a hundred years ago when a man could
breathe
free, clean
air, go where he wanted, do as he
pleased, and—for
a few years
at
least, and
if he were
strong enough—be the
sole master of his own
destiny.
We know those days can never come again, but we can
steal them back,
briefly, through the Western.

THE BEGIMinGS -AUD BROHCHO BILLY
The Western movie, cashing in on the enormous popu-
larity
of the dime novel
(itself glamorizing and exag-
gerating the Western
frontier
life that was rapidly
dis-
appearing but was
still far from being ancient history),
came into being even before there were theatre screens
on which
to show
it. The
first movies, often barely
a
minute in length and designed to be shown in the Muto-
scope parlors, where only one person could view them
at a time, cranking a handle as he looked into the peep-
show machine, immediately recognized public interest in
the West, and catered to
it. Although the word had not
been
coined
yet, many
of
these
short
vignettes were
documentaries-scenes of cattle roundups or of the fast-
vanishing
buflfalo
herds
grazing on
the plains-and
as
14
such were, and are, an invaluable record of a changing
America.
Still
others,
while devoid of plots or
acting,
staged reconstructions of "typical" Western incidents:
a
stagecoach
holdup
or
Indians
scalping
their
victims.
Buffalo
Bill Cody
was
recorded on
film;
the Edison
Company made a brief
little tableau which they called
Cripple
Creek
Bar-room,
showing
well-dressed,
top-
hatted Western dandies (gamblers presumably)
loung-
ing
in
the
rough-and-ready
bar,
presided
over by
an
apparently
Indian
female
barkeeper.
All
of
this was
before the year
1900.
The big turning point came in 1903 with the Edison
Company's The Great
Train Robbery,
filmed
in New
Jersey and directed by Edwin S. Porter. In view of the

many
Western
vignettes
that had preceded
it,
it was
hardly,
as has been claimed,
the
"first Western." Nor
was
it "the
first story
film," an even more exaggerated
and frequently repeated claim. But
it undoubtedly was
the
first Western with recognizable form;
it established
the essential formula of crime,
pursuit, showdown and
justice,
and
within
its
ten-minute
running span
it
in-
cluded,
in addition to the train robbery
itself, elements
of
fisticuffs, horseback pursuit and gunplay, along with
suggestions of small child appeal, and probably the
first
introduction of that cliche-to-be, the saloon bullies forc-
ing the dude
into
a dance.
(In
later years such
a
se-
quence was
a
useful contrivance
to provoke
a saloon
fracas between
the
cavalier-hero and the
bullying
vil-
lain. ) The Great Train Robbery was a remarkably so-
phisticated film for 1903, keeping briskly on the move
and using
its New Jersey locations intelligently, despite
the
too-Eastern
and
too-modern
telegraph
lines
that
paralleled the railroad track. There was interesting use
of double-exposure and a neat bit of jump-cutting when
a dummy
is
substituted
for one
of
the
trainmen, and
thrown
off the engine after a
fight scene.
Most of all however, the film benefitted from a primi-
tive
but
effective form of editing, with
intercutting be-
tween the opposing factions, and a good sense of story-
telling and
suspense.
Porter, who directed and photo-
graphed,
alas,
didn't
recognize
the tremendous gram-
matical device he had stumbled onto. His film was put
together that way because
it seemed the logical way to
tell a story, but many of his later films, including such
post-1913
full-length features
as The Count of Monte
Cristo, were
if anything a retrogression from The Great
Train Robbery and had less innate cinema sense. Porter
missed the opportunity to become the father of the art
of cinema, but he did create the
first American movie
milestone. The Great Train Robbery was a huge com-
mercial success and prompted not so much sequels and
extensions
as
outright
imitations.
In those days of lax

S.
Porter's

(1 903 )
:

motion pictures)
it was
all too easy for film pirates to
make "dupe"
negatives of completed pictures and
sell
them as their own, or at least inject key scenes into their
own
films. The Lubin Company
of PhUadelphia even
went
so
far
as
to remake The Great
Train Robbery
scene
for
scene, with only an occasional detail—a
dif-
ferent calendar for example—to show that
it was not the
identical
film!
Imitations and plagiarisms of The Great
Train Robbery were legion, and a year or two later the
Edison Company themselves made a parody of it, called
The
Little
Train Robbery.
Despite the enormous popularity of the train robbery
films
(train robberies were
still not uncommon, so the
films had topicality as well
as excitement), the growth
of the Western was slow. Gradually, formulas began to
evolve, the group of heroes and badmen giving way to
individual good guys and bad guys.
1906's A Race for
Millions,
despite mixing rather obvious
studio painted
sets with genuine exteriors, had a solid little claim-jump-
ing plot, an exciting auto vs. train chase (already West-
erns were beginning to anticipate the Tom Mix and Roy
Rogers streamlining by incorporating essentially modern
ingredients
into
their
plots), and
a climax
of the
tra-
ditional High Noon man-to-man
duel
in
the
deserted
main street. Already, too, the villain was moustachioed,
black-hatted-and
drank.
Drinking
not
only
lost him
audience sympathy,
but helped to explain why an ex-
perienced
killer and gunman should be beaten
to
the
draw
by
a
comparatively
innocent hero—a
ploy
that
worked just as unobtrusively and effectively thirty-three
years
later
in
the
climax
of John
Ford's
Stagecoach.
A Race for Millions was a big step forward in the evo-
lution
of the Western, but some key
ingredients were
still
missing.
All Westerns
still ran for twelve minutes
or
less, limiting them to simple story-lines, and most of
them were made
in
the
East,
in New York and New
Jersey. There were
still enough rugged
locations, par-
ticularly
in
upstate New
York,
for
the
exteriors
to
double reasonably well
for the real West, though occa-
sionally a placid New Jersey stream didn't entirely live
up to the "raging torrent" that a subtitle described
it as.
Physical action was
still limited to fairly mild horseback
cantering and brief, unconvincing wrestling. The profes-
sion of stuntman had yet to be born, and nobody knew
yet how
to
stage
spectacular
horse-falls
or
no-holds-
barred fistic battles, least of all the actors, many of them
16

recruited from the stage or the director's roster of family
and friends. The acting—one might more accurately say
"posing"—was
stiff and
unsubtlc
and
the costuming
a
weird
mixture
of
the
actors' own
Eastern
wardrobes,
decked
out
with
ten-gallon
hats,
sheep-wool
chaps,
sheriff's
badges, and other such
essentials
as could be
borrowed, rented or made. The early Eastern Westerns
certainly had
a
far from
authentic look
to them, and
oddly enough. Westerns already being made
in France
(more rugged, with emphasis on violence, sudden death,
lynchings ) had much more genuine flavor to them, and
more convincing locales and costuming. Audiences were
more
gullible and
less
critical
then, however, and
the
shortcomings of the Eastern-filmed Westerns seemed not
to worry them. That authenticity of costume, locale and
plot was
not
in
itself
an
essential
to winning
public
appeal was proven by a most peculiar
little Western of
1908
entitled
The Bank
Robbery.
Produced
by
the
Oklahoma Mutoscene Company,
it was filmed entirely
on
location
in and around Cache, Oklahoma.
Its plot
vaguely paralleled The Great Train Robbery, although
it attempted to win a little sympathy for the outlaws by
showing their concern for a wounded comrade, in put-
ting their escape in jeopardy by stopping to care for him.
The dusty
little Oklahoma town, with the bank
as
its
focal
point, was
obviously
the
real
thing, and
at two
reels
the
film was
the
longest Western
yet made.
Its
"director" was famed frontier lawman William M. Tilgh-
man
(later
a good
friend
and
advisor
to
William
S.
Hart)
and
its
cast included
train robber Al Jennings,
only recently out of jail. Tilghman undoubtedly was an
efficient and fearless frontier marshal, but
it
is fortunate
indeed that he never had to make his living as a movie
director. Not only did he
lack knowledge of even the
rudiments of technique—some of the camera panning
is
so
appallingly
inept
that once, when
the outlaws race
out of town, the camera never does catch up with more
than a glimpse of the flying tail of the last horse—but he
had no
idea
of showmanship
either. One would have
thought that with a "celebrity" like Al Jennings to work
with, some attempt would have been made to spotlight
him, either by making him the leader of the outlaws or
by giving him a key scene or bit of "business." But there
is not even a medium shot to give audiences the chance
to
recognize
Jennings; he
is
merely one
of the
gang,
photographed almost
entirely
in long shot throughout,
and
if one were
not
familiar with Jennings'
face and
small
stature
from
his
later
starring
Westerns,
one
wouldn't be
able
to pick him out from the crowd.
Fortunately, something happened in 1908 to weld the
Lubin's

scene-by-scene copy of
The Great Train Robberx
17

plots
of the
Eastern Westerns
like The Sheriffs Love
with the geographic authenticity of The Bank Robbery,
and to add one vital ingredient. G. M. Anderson, a beefy
former photographer's model with aspirations to acting
and
directing, had
played
several
small
parts
in The
Great Train Robbery, and
in the intervening years had
tried his hand
at several other Westerns, none of them
markedly
successful. Then, without any
inkling of the
fantastic impact
it would have, he made a short Western
entitled Broncho
Billy and the Baby. Because nobody
else was currently available, he played the lead himself.
Its
title,
and
the
story
itself, came from
a published
Peter B. Kyne story. Anderson neglected the niceties of
acquiring legal screen adaptation
rights, and was soon
visited by Kyne-who liked the film well enough to waive
legal action, while at the same time making
it clear that
Anderson would have to be paid for any further adap-
tations of his work. The story was a pleasing mixture of
action and sentiment, with a "good badman" hero who
gives up his chance of freedom to aid a stricken child,
and the
film was an
instant success. The reasons were
not hard to discover, since the main departure from
all
previous Westerns was in
its concentration on a colorful
"hero"—a man who was rugged and a law unto himself.
but also possessed the nobility and courage of the Ar-
thurian
knights.
Since
the
character had been
tagged
Broncho
Billy, the name
stuck, and Anderson became
Broncho
Billy Anderson
in hundreds of one- and two-
reel
Westerns.
Up until this point, Anderson had considered himself
more of a director and an executive than a star, and he
was
a
partner
in
the
Chicago-based
Essanay
Studio.
Now, working out of Niles
in California, he would de-
vote himself almost exclusively to Broncho
Billy. That
he was not an especially handsome man hardly mattered
(in
fact, he resembled movie villain Fred Kohler more
than he did standard leading-man types), since this early
there was no star system. And as the first Western hero
he was
in any event creating precedents, not breaking
them. He was a bad rider but learned quickly, and even
managed
a stunt or two
as time went by. He was big
and brawny, well able to look after himself in the fight
scenes. He became
quite
adept
at
rope
twirling.
His
bulky frame, paw-like hands and rough-hewn face even
became advantages
in his evolving characterization, en-
abling him
to win laughs and audience sympathy with
his clumsiness and lack of self-confidence in dealing with
the ladies. The sheepish grin and the awkward fumbling

bit of business for every cowboy from Ken Maynard to
John Wayne—was born
in the Broncho Billy Westerns.
The
Broncho
Billy
films
were
sure-fire
audience
pleasers, and while Anderson had none of the intense
dedication to either art or the depiction of the true West
that was to mark William S. Hart's work, he was a good
showman
and
he
learned
quickly.
His
Westerns had
strong
little
plots, and doubtless many of the standard
"B" Western stories were
first introduced to the screen
by Anderson. Anderson's California locations gave his
films
a tremendous
scenic advantage over the cowboy
stories
still being made in the East, and moreover they
improved in quality, steadily and consistently. Relatively
few
of
his
films
survive today, but those
that do
still
have
a
great
deal
of
vitality, charm,
and
often
quite
surprising production
values. Even today,
it's easy
to
understand
his enormous
appeal. Tom Mix came into
movies with the Selig Company while Anderson was still
at the peak of his popularity, and made but little initial
impression.
Later,
of
course, Mix wouW become
the
biggest Western star of them
all. Anderson's popularity
waned
in

William

to
the
screen
with

characterization,
bigger budgets,
and genuinely adult stories. Broncho Billy knew that he

really
compete,
but

did
go
out
with
a
flourish, making the transition to features and also, near
the end of his career, producing some of his best and
most polished

kind of apotheosis of
all the Broncho Billys, though
its
very
last shot, a genial plagiarism from Chaplin's Easy
Street,
suggests that
its approach was
at
least partially
tongue-in-cheek.
Still
in
circulation and frequently ex-
hibited by
film
societies,
it may mislead
film scholars
into an exaggerated concept of Anderson's accomplish-
ments,
since
an
archival
error
has
dated
it
as
1912
instead
of the
correct
1918. For
1912,
it would be
a
remarkable
film indeed!
After 1920, with Hart at his prime, Tom Mix rapidly
overtaking him, and any number of new Western stars
on
the
way,
Anderson
returned
briefly
to
producing
(with a series of Stan Laurel comedies) and then drifted
out of movies entirely. He came into the limelight again
in the late
fifties, when he was rediscovered and pressed
into service as a guest star
in a brace of TV documen-
taries on
the
Western. And
in
1965
he
joined
other
Western old-timers
at the Paramount studio
to play
a
character cameo in his first sound, color and wide-screen
Western,
The
Bounty
Killer.
Exactly
sixty-two
years
after
his
first appearance
in
a Western saloon
in The
Great Train Robbery, he was sitting in a Western saloon
again-not spry enough to re-do his spirited dance, but
with those eagle eyes as
alert as ever, as though aware
that everything that was taking place before the camera
had been pioneered
in
his Broncho
Billy Westerns
six
decades earlier. He has never been bitter at the relatively
brief tenure of his years of movie fame; after
all he had
been
in The Great Train Robbery, and he had single-
handedly
established
the Western
Star and
set up the
basic formula of the series-Western. The Broncho Billys
were the bedrock on which William S. Hart, Tom Mix,
D. W. Griffith, Thomas Ince, and John Ford would now
build the
art of the Western.
22

PIOMEERS OF THE AET: DM. GRIFFITH
AND THOMAS H^mCE
Although their tremendous contributions to the develop-
ment of the
film
as a whole far transcend their impor-
tance to the Western, nevertheless the Western film in
its
early,
formative
days owed
a huge debt
to David
Wark
Griffith and Thomas H.
Ince.
Both came
to
films
at approximately the same time
and
both made
their most
important
contributions
to
film in the years 1908-1913. Admittedly, Griffith's great
masterpieces came
later, but they wouldn't have been
possible without the "language" of film that he evolved
in those earlier years and which has been absorbed by
every
film-maker
since.
Ince's
importance
was
even
more indisputably
restricted
to those early years, since
his
creative
career dwindled
rapidly
after
1916, even
though he remained
active and
prolific
until
his death
in the mid-twenties.
The
two
men
complemented
one
another
rather
nicely. Griffith was wholly devoted to the art of film and
to developing new and dynamic means of story-telling.
He worked
creatively and
intuitively and had
a poor
head for business organization. His personal drive and
enthusiasm could
help
raise
financing
for
production,
but once his films were made, his lack of experience in
marketing prevented
their making money
for him,
al-
though
others might
profit enormously from them.
In
any case, once a film was finished, he was much more
concerned with his next project. Ince, conversely, though
initially a director too, soon became much more valu-
23

able as a production supervisor, establishing methods of
organizing film-making on the most economical assem-
bly-line
basis
possible. He
supervised
other
directors,
rewrote scenarios, insisted on super-detailed scripts that
gave the director every kind of assistance by outlining
mood, describing the
sets or locations, explaining how
certain effects could be achieved at minimum cost, giv-
ing the cameraman
tips as to the
style of lighting and
the color
tints to be used, and providing complete dia-
logue for
all of the characters so that the actors would
really understand their roles, even though the films were
silent, and
all of the dialogue would ultimately have to
be condensed
to a few
subtitles.
Griffith, on the other
hand, used no scripts at all—a practice he followed even
David W.
Griffith
in
his
huge
historical
spectacles—working
entirely by
instinct and keeping not only complicated plot-lines but
his even more complicated
editing plans
in
his head.
Their
individual
methods worked
well
for
both
film-
makers; a Griffith film was always recognizably a Griffith
film and an Ince film always had the Ince stamp on it—
quite
literally,
since Ince was
rather
a vain man and
loved to see his name on the credits of his films as often
as
possible.
It was even printed on the ends of reels-
footage never intended to be projected and there merely
for
identification
purposes!
Both
approaches
to
film-
making were
extreme,
but
they produced
far
greater
results than the compromise methods employed by other
studios.
The
Edison Company,
for
example,
utilized
scripts that were literally no more than lists of shots with
the
barest
of
details. They
offered no help
to an un-
imaginative director and no stimulus to a talented one.
Actually, the directorial talent at Edison seemed to be
on
a par with the writing
talent; apart from the early
pioneering works of Edwin S. Porter, almost everything
that emerged from the Edison Studios was stodgy and at
least
five years behind the times in terms of technique.
Both Griffith and Ince made a great number of one-
and two-reel Westerns. Ince made them because he had
established standing sets of Western towns and ranches,
and maintained a permanent troupe of cowboys, Indians
and
trick
riders, with attendant wagons, horses,
cattle,
buffalo and other livestock. Griffith made_ Westerns be-
cause they provided him with a perfect framework on
which to hang stories of action and suspense. Although
he made many
potboilers—simple
little romances and
dramas—his important work
fell
into one of two cate-
gories. On the onejiand^he was making films that had
something of cultural or social importance to say: adap-
tations of literary classics or comments on current politi-
cal or social attitudes. On the othe r, he was turning out
what^ouHL loosely be termed
"chase"
films—thrillers,
train
robbery
films, modern
piracy on
the
high
seas,
gangster stories, and most of all, Westerns. Most of these
films had the simplest of story-lines:
a few deft scenes
to establish period and milieu and then right into a single
basic situation which would be milked for suspense and
action. The Western, with
its already standard situation
of the "good" guys besieged by villains or Indians, and
the climactic race to the rescue, provided Griffith with
the
perfect
background
for
his
experiments
in
film
"grammar."
Griffith obviously loved the chase, for the
excitement
it created and he continued to use
it, con-
stantly
developing
and
polishing,
right
through
his
career. But
in these early Westerns he used
it not just
for its own inherent thrill, byt also as a way of involving
audjences-emotionally -in his films, of making them par-

Just how
advanced
Griffith was in his ideas, andTiow little they were under-
stood by his contemporaries, can be clearly indicated by
a comparison of two Westerns almost
identical
in plot
content
but
poles
apart
in
terms
of
excitement
and
style—the Edison Company's The Corporal's Daughter
of 1915 and Griffith's Fighting Blood of 1911.
The Corporal's Daughter, not considered a bad film
in
its
day,
merely
an
average
but
quite
acceptable
product,
is almost an object lesson in how to take fool-
proof material and even
in
the
short running time
of
ten minutes make
it seem dull and overlong. The char-
acters
are
all
flung on the screen without any kind of
establishing scenes;
titles
tell
us who they are and ex-
plain their relationships to other characters, and that
is
all. There are no seemingly extraneous "bits of business"
to humanize them, no closeups of their faces to give us
any
idea
of what
their emotions
are. Even
the
little
suspense
that the
story has
is minimized by
titles
that
tell
us beforehand what
is going
to happen. Menacing
Indians ride into static camera set-ups in long shot and
stop just in front of the camera to perform their essential
bit of action. A

ing back bravely, yet the accompanying action shows us
a dozen or more
soldiers,
strategically positioned high
on a
hill with plenty of rocks for cover, shooting down
at the Indians, of whom we see only two or three. When
the
relief force
is sent to the rescue, they gallop out of
a fort which
is a reasonable enough set, but which loses
in conviction when we see that
it
is built back from a
main highway, with a gaping sewer prominent in center-
screen. (A minor shift of the camera could have avoided
it with ease.) As
for the rescue:
the cavalry suddenly
appears
on
the
scene
without
any
attempt
at
cross-
cutting
to
build
tension
and
excitement and
the
film
finishes
abruptly
with
the
standard
hero-heroine em-
brace. There
is no neat
little comic or human touch to
round
it
out.
Looking
at
this
very
primitive Western today,
it
is
difficult indeed to believe that Griffith's far more sophis-
ticated
Fighting Blood came
a
full
four years
earlier.
Griffith instantly wins audience sympathy by showing us
a likeable family of pioneers, with a large contingent of
children,
eking
out
a hard
existence. The
father
is
a
Civil War
veteran and
trains
his
children
in
military
drill.
In a few deft scenes, Griffith sketches in their in-
nate patriotism, establishes one child as mischievous, the
oldest son as being in love and as something of a rebel
against parental authority.
Well within the first third of this ten-minute film, sepa-
rate sub-plots have evolved. The Sioux are on the war-
path. The son has
fallen out with
his
father, gone to
visit his girl, become involved
in some skirmishing with
the Indians, and decided to get help. At one point, as the
hero (Bobby Harron)
tries
to mount
his horse
to go
for help, the horse, scared, shies away. Probably having
had
no
time
(or
excess
film)
to
re-shoot
the
scene,
Griffith just uses as much of
it as he can, cuts away to
something else, and then returns to find the hero safely
on his horse—a bit of elementary editing that obviously
never occurred
to the Edison director confronted with
that sewer! From here the
film builds constantly
in
its
tension and
in the sheer size of
its action, cutting from
the
hero
racing
for
help
(followed
by
three
Indians
whom he engages
in a running horseback duel
)
to the
settlers
fighting off the
Indians.
And even
in
these tremendously
well-staged
action
scenes,
Griffith never forgets
to engage audience sym-
pathy:
two
of
the
children cower
under
the
bed,
as
excited as they are frightened; an older girl pantomimes
that
she
can't shoot
the guns because the
noise
hurts

Gulch

her ears,
but
she'll do her
bit by loading them for the
others. The cabin
is set
afire, and water to control
it
is
getting
low. The
hero meanwhile has reached
a
large
body of cavalry, which rushes to the rescue. Imaginative
camera placement here manages to suggest literally hun-
dreds of
riders by having the audience
first see a long
line of riders racing to the right of the screen at a great
distance away, and then,
a few moments
later, the ap-
parent front rank of that line gallops
into the forefront
of
the
frame.
This was
a
shot
that
Griffith
repeated
exactly
in
his
1924
epic, America. Now
Griffith
cuts
back more and more between the battle and the rescue
troop,
and
finally, when
the
cavalry
races on
to
the
scene, he has his camera high atop a hill, creating a vast
panorama which
takes
in the cabin, the encircling
In-
dians, and the rescuing cavalry
in extreme yet crystal-
clear long shots. To round off his tale, Griffith stages an
emotional
reunion between
father and
son, and
for
a
final
fillip, has the now beaming children emerge from
under
the bed on
to
a
floor
realistically covered with
spent cartridges. Fighting Blood was quite possibly the
best directed and edited
film of
1911, yet the fact that
the similarly-plotted but totally styleless The Corporal's
Daughter was
still considered acceptable in 1915 shows
not only how advanced Griffith's methods were, but also
how
little they were understood by his competitors. Of
course. The Birth of a Nation, also in 1915, proved that
his methods were not only artistically brilliant but com-
mercially sound, and then directors were only too willing
to
try to copy his innovational
style.
Griffith
continued
to make many
outstanding
one-
and two-reel Westerns for Biograph, almost
all of them
made
in
Hollywood,
where
the
rugged
scenery
gave
them a tremendous scenic advantage over their Eastern
counterparts. From
simple
little dramas
like
Friends,
The Goddess of Sagebrush Gulch, and Broken Ways, he
progressed
to
spectacular
films on
epic
themes:
The
Last Drop of Water (a 1911 precursor to The Covered
Wagon), The Battle of Elderbush Gulch
(Lillian Gish
and Mae Marsh
in
a superb
action
film,
with savage
massacre scenes and
brilliantly constructed and edited
battle scenes), and perhaps best of
all, The Massacre,
a stark, yet poetic film, based very loosely on the Custer
massacre and decidedly sympathetic to the Indian point
of view. As were many of the later Griffith films,
it was
also
a parable on
the
futility of war. The "massacre"

troop arrives on the scene of carnage,
it finds only the
dead—until a hand waves feebly from beneath a pile of
corpses. The heroine and her baby whom she
is clutch-
ing to her breast are the sole survivors. Although Griffith
and Ince both made Westerns in which the Indians were
the standard, unmotivated villains, convenient mass tar-
gets
in the
battle scenes, they also made a great many
that were sympathetic to the Indian and
critical of the
whites' actual (though indirect) policy of extermination.

not only in documenting the Indian's way of life, but in
establishing him as a human being of nobility and recog-
nizable emotions. The Indian Massacre was one of the
best of these films, presenting both sides of the picture,
stressing the problems and courage of the white settlers,
but emphasizing most of all the tragedy of the relentless
extermination of the Indian. Its closing scene—a silhou-
ette
of
an
Indian woman
praying beneath
the wood-
frame burial pyre of her dead child—was as beautifully
composed and photographed as anything
in
later John
Ford
films.
Stories of the American Indian were a dominant motif
in
tlie
early Westerns, and
especially those
of
Griffith
and
Ince.
In
fact, James Fenimore Cooper was much
more of an influence on the Western movie at this time
than Zane Grey. Many films eschewed the Indian-white
conflict
entirely
to
deal
with' themes of wholly Indian
content—simple romances
like
Little Dove's Romance,
or melodramas such as Griffith's A Squaw's Love, with
Mabel Normand engaged in some stunt leaps and under-
water swimming in a story of intertribal intrigue. Direct
adaptations
of
Fenimore
Cooper
stories
(The
Deer-
slayer, Leatherstocking) were very popular too, though
not strictly Westerns since geographically they were set
along the Eastern seaboard and for the most part were
shot
in New York or New Jersey. And already in
this
period the movies had exploited the theme of the "col-
lege" Indian returning, educated, to his people, only to
be
rejected by them and
yet unable
to
return
to
the
white man's
cities. Thomas Ince tended to concentrate
rather more on the Indian films than did Griffith for two
very good reasons. One was that he had a considerable
investment in his Indian riders, tepees, bufi'alo and other
livestock, and
liked
to use them
as frequently
as pos-
sible. Another was
that he was
far more of a "story"
man than
Griffith, and the American
Indian offered a
wealth
of
material. To
Griffith,
technique was
every-
thing. His "stories" were usually
little more than situa-
tions. Ince, on the other hand, was never very strong on
technique. There
is superb staging in his films,
realistic
detail, expert and often spectacular mass action scenes,
and fine camerawork. But
in terms of directorial finesse
and editing, he ran a very second best to Griffith. How-
ever,
his stories were strong in the extreme, running to
a
multiplicity
of
characters and
presenting themes
of
moral
regeneration and
self-sacrifice. The movies were
still not considered "respectable" in many quarters, and
they constantly sought to justify themselves by teaching
32

Desert Gold

Frank Borzage,
Bob Kortman
valuable "moral lessons" with their entertainment. Ince
did more than his share along these lines, and his films
were full of ministers or evangelical "good badmen" who
conquered or won over the lawless elements and cowards
who
found
themselves. The
clear
distinctigrL between
gqod_and_evil^^was^ depicted by
pitting church
against
saloon in such short early Westerns as Past Redemption.
Moral
retribution
in
Ince
Westerns
was
unusually
severe. The heroine of The Woman marries bigamously
only to raise money for her desperately
ill husband, this
after
having
taken
a
bad
fall
in
the Cherokee
Strip
landrush
(a
very
creditably
staged
sequence)
in
an
effort to gain land
in
a warm climate where he might
recover. After her
first husband dies, she feels that she
has
betrayed
both him and her current husband. The
only
solution,
suicide. Ann
Little,
the heroine of Past
Redemption, formerly sold firewater to the Indians and
had shot down a cavalryman or two. She was thoroughly
"saved" by
the
church,
but when
the
minister
fell
in
love with her, she was so obviously unworthy that the
only way out was for her to trek across the desert, and
die
of
thirst.
(The
mortality
rate
in
Ince's
Civil War
films was even
higher! )
While seen
individually
these
tragic Ince Westerns seem genuinely dramatic, seen as a
group
the
rather
pointless contrivance
of so much
of
the tragedy emerges instead as a kind of gimmick
: Ince
used the shock ending of tragedy just as
Griffith used
the
excitement
of
the
chase. The
stress on unhappy
endings was certainly unconventional, but it was perhaps
not
quite
as
daring
as
it might seem
today. The
star
system was
still
in
its
earliest stages, and
in any case,
prior to Charles Ray and William S. Hart, Ince had no
stars
of major
importance. Thus
audiences were
not
sufficiently
familiar with such players
as Francis Ford
and Tom Chatterton to regard them as favorites or to
be dismayed when they were suddenly killed
off.
The majority of Ince's Westerns were either cowboy-
Indian or cavalry-Indian affairs, often surprisingly elabo-
rate
in
the
scale
of
their
action, and frequently,
as
in
The Invaders, running to three
reels
in length instead
of the customary two. His canny business sense told him
that
it was worth spending extra money on big
battle
and action scenes, since these could later be re-used and
cut
into
other
films
with
similar themes and
players.
He was thus the first producer to deliberately economize
by
using
stock footage—something
that became
a
fine
art
in
the
last days
of the "B" Western, when eighty
per
cent
of
the
action material would be stock
lifted

from earlier pictures. However, the polish and scope of
Ince's original action footage can be attested to by the
fact that
it was
still being used to pad out new pictures
even
into
the
1950's.
In 1913 Griffith
left Biograph to move out to Holly-
wood and the less restricting Reliance company. He had
big
plans,
and
the
Western
for him
had
served
its
purpose.
Indeed,
for
the
rest of
his
career, he would
personally direct only one more Western, 1919's Scarlet
Days, one
of
his
least successful
features.
It was
little
more than one of his standard Biograph one-reel plots
expanded to eight times that length, although with the
traditional
last-reel
fight and race to the rescue to pro-
vide
the expected climactic excitement.
Ince, on the other hand, though no longer a personal
director, was on
the
threshold
of
accidentally making
one of the greatest contributions of all to the future well-
being of the Western film. For in 1914 he would intro-
duce to movie audiences a veteran stage actor, William
Surrey
Hart. Hart had been
associated
with
"classic"
theatre, and especially Shakespeare
for so long that to
this day
the
legend
persists
that
the "S"
in
his name
stands
for ShakQspeare. Most
stage
players who were
brought
to
the
screen
in
the
first days
of
full-length
silent features failed badly, and after their initial novelty
wore off, returned to the boards. The three most notable
exceptions of the 1914-16 years were William
S. Hart,
John Barrymore, and Douglas Fairbanks. Hart was the
first
to make movies and
to
establish an
international
reputation through them. The French loved him, and
dubbed him "Rio Jim." As the Westerns
left the one-
and
two-reelers
behind
and moved
into
full
features,
they needed a guiding hand desperately—not just a gifted
director
or
a
colorful
star.
Bill Hart was
the
perfect
example of the right man
in the right place
at precisely
the
right time.

WILLIAM a HABT
To many,
William
S. Hart
is
the embodiment
of
the
"strong,
silent" Western hero of the
screen,
a stereo-
typed
if nostalgic figure, and no more. And admittedly,
one's
first introduction
to Hart
(depending,
of course,
on the film
) often does tend to substantiate that impres-
sion. But how inaccurate
it
is, and what an injustice
it
does to a man who was not just a star but, together with
John Ford,
a major force
in the shaping and develop-
ment of the Western
genre.
Hart was a mature man when he came to the movies
in
1914,
with
long
theatrical
experience,
primarily
Shakespearean, behind him. The Western film, even that
early, had sunk into disrepute. D. W. Griffith had aban-
doned
his
fine
little
Biograph Westerns
to move
into
more ambitious features, and in any case he had never
developed a single Western star with recognizable char-
acteristics and costume
that carried over from picture
to picture. Rather, he used his regular roster of players-
Charles West, Henry B. Walthall, Alfred Paget, Walter
Miller,
Lionel
Barrymore
and
others—all
of whom
played Easterners, Westerners, Northerners and South-
erners with fine impartiality. Only Harry Carey seemed
to
fit most naturally into Western roles, and of course as
soon
as he
left Biograph he was to specialize
in them.
Tom
Mix was
still
marking
time
in
uninspired
Selig
shorts, and Broncho Billy, tremendously popular though
he was, was producing the Easterner's concept of what
the Western should
be.
37

Although not quite the authentic plainsman that Hart,
in later years, loved to pose as (through a sheer love of
that
pose,
not
out
of
a
desire
to
deceive), Hart had
spent much
of
his
youth
in
the
West. He had
seen
frontier
gunfighting
at
first hand, knew the American
Indian, and had
a baby brother buried on the
prairie.
He
genuinely
loved the
West, and when,
quite unex-
pectedly, he found himself a star after his
first film, he
was determined
to
put
the
truth,
the
poetry, and
the
history
of
the West
on
film.
With
producer Thomas
Ince's
backing
he
did
this,
to
a
critical
acclaim and
popular
success
neither
of them had dreamed
of. A
shrewd producer and somewhat of an opportunist, Ince
later exploited Hart
ruthlessly, and
at one point such
hostility existed between the two men that Hart refused
to
let
his pinto pony
Fritz
(the
first
of many movie
horses to have
his own huge fan following)
appear
in
any of the movies from which Ince would
profit. Hart
even took
big trade-paper advertisements
to announce
Fritz's "retirement"—and later on, when he had left Ince,
his "comeback." But regardless of the business and per-
sonal differences between the men, Ince deserves a great
deal of credit for giving Hart his
first opportunity, and
for having the foresight to recognize Hart's potential and
give him
a free hand with
his
films.
Rapidly graduating from one-reelers to features, Hart
surrounded
himself with
a
stock company
of
players,
writers
(C. Gardner Sullivan was the
best, and was to
remain a major screenwriter for many years), directors
(Lambert
Hillyer, Reginald Barker)
and cameramen,
but he was
the guiding
spirit behind
all
his
films and
frequently
the
actual,
not
just
the
nominal,
director.
Because Hart's
films were always so dominated by his
personality as an actor, his skill as a director has usually
been either underrated or ignored entirely. In 1914-15,
the art of direction was
still relatively new. Griffith was
supreme, most of the major directors of the
silent era
were still just apprentices, and there were only a handful
of
really
accomplished
directors
on
the
next
plateau
below
Griffith:
Cecil
B.
DeMille,
Maurice Tourneur,
Herbert Brenon, Charles Chaplin, and Hart. And Hart
certainly
belongs
in
that
illustrious
company,
even
though his range was narrower than the others. His con-
trol
of mob scenes was
often
superb,
he managed
to
extract extremely subtle underplaying from
his leading
ladies, and while he wasn't one for showy technique, he
understood the tools of film and when best to use them.
He rarely moved his camera for example, but when he
did,
it was
to
a purpose—as
in The Return
of Draw
Egan, when
the camera
tracks
in
front of him
as he

strides
resolutely from
his
sheriff's
office
for
a
street
showdown with the villain. His films were raw, unglam-
orous, and
gutsy,
the
costumes
and
livery
trappings
accurate,
the ramshackle Western towns and
their
in-
habitants like unretouched Matthew Brady photographs,
the sense of dry heat ever-present (panchromatic film-
stock, developed
in the twenties, softened and glamor-
ized the landscapes
in later Westerns), and the clouds
of dust everywhere.
(This naturalistic quality vanished
later when
directors took
to wetting down the ground
so that the riding scenes would be cleaner and crisper.)
Hart's
films were
the
first "adult" Westerns
in
the
truest sense of that much distorted phrase. Hart knew
the West, counted such lawmen as Wyatt Earp and Bat
Masterson among his friends, and sincerely did his best
to mingle poetry and realism in his
films. His zeal did
occasionally lead him astray; his sentimentality began to
dominate his later films, and even honesty can become
a
cliche when
it
is presented via situations, characters
and a style of subtitling that are repeated in almost every
film. However, Hart's cliches were very personal ones,
so personal
that they never became absorbed
into the
mainstream of Western film cliches. He loved his sister
dearly, and a recurring theme
in several of his movies
called on him to avenge the death, seduction, or other

betrayal of a
sister. To Hart, every woman was a lady,
to be respected and protected with the chivalry of old.
Thus his "good badman" character invariably reformed
almost from the
first glance of his leading lady. "One
who
is
evil looking for the
first time on
that which
is
good"
is how a subtitle
in Hell's Hinges (1916) put
it,
to be followed shortly thereafter by: "I reckon God ain't
wantin' me much. Ma'am,
but when
I look
at you
I
feel
I've been
ridin' the wrong
trail." Hart, a supreme
sentimentalist, not only identified himself with his screen
image,
but
cherished
and
revered
all
of
his
leading
ladies, off-screen as well as on, to the extent of propos-
ing
marriage
to
most
of
them.
(Only
one
of
them,
Winifred Westover,
liked the
idea.
Hart,
aghast,
tried
to back out, but she pursued him with grim determina-
tion. The marriage took place but was not a happy one,
and they
later divorced.)
Since Hart had an unerring eye for beauty and taste
in
his
leading
ladies
(Bessie
Love, Eva Novak,
Jane
Novak, Anna O. Nilsson)
his instantaneous conversions
were
often
surprisingly convincing,
really
falling down
only when
the
rather
plain
Clara
Williams
was
his
nemesis. "A
different kind of smile,
sweet, honest and
trustful, and seeming to say 'How do you do, friend?' "
was
the
masterfully
creative
subtitle
that C.
Gardner
Sullivan wrought to accompany a bland expression, ex-
cessive
eye makeup and
a
hesitant
twitch
of
the
lips
when Miss Williams
first confronted badman Hart. As
a change of pace
(as
in The Testing Block, where Hart
played the leader of a gang of outlaws collected "by the
broom
that swept
hell")
Hart occasionally got roaring
drunk,
or
thoroughly
disillusioned
with women
(or
both) and forced the heroine into marriage with him at
gunpoint.
Such
ungentlemanly
behavior
always
took
place
at the
beginning
of the
film, however,
allowing
Hart
ample
time
for
remorse
and
self-sacrifice,
and
allowing the heroine equally ample time to fall genuinely
in love with him and present him with a child.
On the whole. Hart's batting average was high. His
early features were the best, and the tightest. He would
spend roughly one month shooting a feature at a budget
of
$14,000,
his
own
salary
considerably
less
than
$2,000. No wonder that Ince made a small fortune, and
that Hart
felt himself
ill-used. Nevertheless, Hart's re-
sentment never reflected itself in his films. He kept turn-
ing
out Westerns—and
an
occasional non-Western—of
quality and excitement. Sometimes, as in Hell's Hinges,
a kind
of Western Sadie Thompson, he included
plot
elements
(the systematic seduction of a weak minister
by the town trollop)
that even today would be consid-
41

ered daring in a Western. Action was not necessarily a
prime
ingredient
in the Hart Westerns, though he was
a good
rider
and
a
rugged
athlete who
rarely
used
doubles in his fight scenes. But many of the films tended
to be stronger on plot and characterization than on fast
physical
action.
This
hardly mattered
in
the
1914-18
years, when
his formula was
still
relatively
fresh, and
when his films had such good plots and taut construction
that
interest
never
flagged.
But
after
1919,
the
origi-
nality began to fade, and the pace slackened. Hart, after
all, was already forty-four when he made his
first film;
now
his
age began
to
be emphasized by
plots which
contained
romantic
liaisons
with
girls
at
least
twenty
years
his junior. As
if to
stress
Hart's he-man
virility,
they were never May-December romances, but always
boy-girl
romances,
and
Hart's
sentimentality
in
these
sub-plots began to dominate more and more of the foot-
age. The films slowed down—at the very time when Tom
Mix was in his ascendancy and had established a market
for slick, streamlined, all-action movies. Hart had never
liked
action
for
its own
sake, and apart from
isolated
highlight
scenes—a
horseback
leap
from
a
cliff
or
through
a
plate-glass
window—his
films
are
almost
totally devoid of stuntwork. (In Tumbleweeds one shot
of a runaway wagon approaching a gully was done by a
trick glass-shot; another wagon crash was done in two
shots with a cutaway in between; neither scene needed
the services of a stuntman and neither scene was notably
exciting.) He
undoubtedly
felt
that
elaborate
stunts
smelled
of
trickery;
he'd
settle
for
a
lesser
thrill
but
greater
conviction.
But
in
the wake
of the Tom Mix
Westerns (and Mix was to emphasize action, play down
realism, and go out deliberately for small-child appeal )
,
Hart's
films seemed
increasingly
old-fashioned. Asked
by his studio to move with the times, "modernize" his
films,
and
restore
their
decreasing
box-office
returns.
Hart refused. Grimly sticking to
his principles, he was
determined to make films his way or not at
all. And to
his
credit, he faltered badly only once, with an absurd
Western
titled Singer Jim McKee that had a rambling,
incoherent plot
line, an excess of lugubrious sentimen-
tality, and
a
total
disregard
for time and
logic.
Hart,
already a veteran reformed outlaw, raises the baby of a
fallen comrade to womanhood,
ultimately marries her,
serves time in
jail, and returns to her and their child in
what
must
conservatively
have
been
his
110th
year!
Hart's other
later Westerns, however, slower paced or
not, were
still good films, and they
still carried the mark
of his own integrity. His Wild Bill Hickok (prefaced by
a title in which Hart apologized to his audience for look-
ing more
like
Bill
Hart
than
Bill
Hickok)
had two
well-staged
gun-fight
highlights,
and
a
reasonable,
if
romanticized, respect for the historical facts, even bring-
ing
in an
ignored
(by Hollywood)
period
in Hickok 's
life when he was going blind and, for obvious reasons of
self-preservation, had
to conceal the
fact.
Hart made
his
last
film
in
1925.
It was
his
biggest,
and
his only genuine,
epic, Tumbleweeds.
Despite one
minor concession
to popular
taste—Hart had
a comic
sidekick
in
Lucian
Littlefield—and
some
protracted
comedy and romantic interludes with the heroine,
it was
a
fine
film, worthy of being ranked with The Covered
Wagon and The Iron Horse as a major Western
epic.
Directed by Hart and King Baggott,
it had as
its high-
light
a
massively
spectacular
reconstruction
of
the
Cherokee Strip landrush, which was not only splendidly
staged and photographed but also edited with a precision
and a mathematical rhythm worthy of Eisenstein. Later
landrush sequences—for example,
the two
versions
of
C/mcYrro/i—borrowed
a great deal from
this, and while
they were
slicker, and looked
bigger because
of
their
utilization
of
panoramic
long
shots
taken
from
high
camera
cranes,
and
action
shots
taken
from
camera
trucks, they also looked like what they were: Hollywood
reconstructions.
Hart's
version has the look
of a con-
temporary newsreel, even to the retention of one or two
awkward panning shots where
the camera temporarily
loses the rider
it
is following. Since Hart did
all of his
own hard
riding even though he was now nearing the
age
of
fifty-six, one could
easily have forgiven him
if
he had pandered to his vanity a little and included some
running
inserts—riding closeups
taken
from
a camera
truck running parallel
to, or in front of, his horse. But
Hart had always been
reluctant
to
use such
a device
for a galloping rider, undoubtedly feeling that
it would
too readily suggest the omnipresence of a camera crew.
He would occasionally use running
inserts of a stage-
coach, but to spotlight his own riding skill he used them
only once—in the horse-race climax of one of his best
pictures, The Narrow
Trail. Hart quite certainly knew
exactly what he was doing
in the
staging and photog-
raphy
of
his landrush
sequence, and
if the
individual
thrill
is
lost through
the minimizing of stuntwork and
camera
fluidity,
then
the
cumulative
thrill more
than
makes up for
it. The sequence comes to
its close on a
scene of sheer poetry
: Hart, finally out in front, gallops
his horse over the crest of a rise, and the camera, angled
slightly above ground level, picks out for a few seconds
one of the loveliest images any film has ever given us,
a horse and rider, free of restraint and contact with the
earth,
apparently galloping through space.
Although
mishandled
by
its
distributors
and
not
reaching anywhere near
its
full commercial
potential,
Tumbleweeds was both
a
critical and popular success
43

and vindicated Hart and his methods. Wisely, he didn't
try to top
it. And prophetically, he had included a scene
early in the film wherein he, with a group of riders, reins
in his horse on the top of a hill. He removes his hat, and
looks
oif
at
the
great
cattle herds winding
their way
across the plains, evacuating the land that
is soon to be
thrown open to homesteaders. "Boys," he says, "It's the
last of the West." Tumbleweeds was the last of the West
for Hart
too. He had no
wish, nor need,
to
stay on
making Westerns
in the
style that the
studios wanted
but that he personally despised. He retired to his New-
hall ranch to write his autobiography (a vivid, if roman-
ticized work ) and books of equally vivid western fiction
and poetry. When Tumbleweeds was reissued in 1939,
to cash in on the great new Western cycle launched by
Stagecoach, Hart faced the cameras once more to film a
memorable
ten-minute
introduction
to
it.
First
as
a
story-teller, outlining the historic facts behind the open-
ing up
of
the Cherokee
Strip,
and then
as
a movie-
maker proud of his record, recalling the past with deep
emotion and honest sentiment, and finally bidding fare-
well to his audience for the
last time. Hart brought
all
44

(United
Artists,

with Barbara Bedford
of his long theatrical and Shakespearean experience to
bear. His voice, rich, beautifully modulated, occasionally
dangerously
close
to a sob,
not only made
this
intro-
ductory speech one
of the most poignant ever put on
film,
but made many people
realize
for
the
first time
what a magnificent contribution Hart could have made
to the sound film as a star, had he been younger, or as
a character actor, had he been inclined.
Whether,
in
the
long
run.
Hart's
influence
on
the
Western was
as
far-reaching
as John
Ford's
or Tom
Mix's
is
both
debatable
and
unimportant.
But
quite
certainly,
in the context of his time (and Hart's career
spanned a mere eleven years, as opposed to twenty-five
years
for Mix, and
fifty for Ford), he made the major
contribution, rescuing the Western from obscurity, gain-
ing
for
it both
artistic and commercial
respect, and
in
Europe—and France especially—establishing the legend
and
myth
of
the
American
West
on
a
level
so
far
superior
to
that of the novel
that such
intellectuals
as
Jean Cocteau were instantly (and permanently) caaght
in
its
spell.

JOHN FORD:
A HALF-CENTURY OF HORSE OPERAS
In the long run, director John Ford has probably con-
tributed more to the Western film than any other indi-
vidual. Certainly he has made more Westerns than any
other major director and has maintained a higher stand-
ard over the years than such other front-rank directors
as Howard Hawks, Henry King, Henry Hathaway and
Raoul
Walsh, who admittedly never specialized
in the
Western,
but
did
return
to
it
frequently
as
a kind
of
aesthetic and commercial haven. Oddly enough, although
he made close to sixty of them. Ford has always played
down
any
great
personal
affection
or
talent
for
the
Western. As
recently
as
1968,
in
an
interview
filmed
for BBC Television, he stated that "none of my so-called
better pictures were Westerns," and maintained that his
main reason
for making Westerns was that
it enabled
him to get away from Hollywood and into the open and
to work with crews and players that were old friends.
However, Ford has always been notorious for his dis-
like of
all interviewers and—a trait that has grown with
old age and crotchety irascibility—for his tendency never
to give a straight answer. Opinions and "facts" given to
one interviewer are often directly contradicted by those
given to another. Ford's dislike of the sham and artifice
of so many pretentious
directors
is commendable, but
he often goes to the other extreme, denying any qualities
of art -in his films.
"It's just a job of work, that's
all
.
.
.
you do
the
best you can
.
.
. like the man digging the
46

ditch, who says
'I hope the ground
is
soft so that my
pick digs deeper.'
"
Stars
and
technicians who have worked with Ford
confirm his easy-going attitude and his lack of deliberate
striving
after
"art,"
yet Ford's
films themselves more
than
refute
his
dismissal
of them. As
with no
other
American director, they
all bear his recognizable signa-
ture. Whether
his
films were photographed by Joseph
August, Arthur Miller or Gregg Toland, they
all looked
like Ford pictures. Familiar faces are scattered through
all of them, a Ford stock company nurtured and
built
through the
years. John Wayne made
his
first appear-
ance
in
a Ford
film with a sizeable
bit
role
in
1928's
Hangman's House.
The musical scores—with frequent recourse to "Red
River Valley," whether the film
is a Western or not—all
sound like Ford scores. No matter how adept camera-
men, players and composers were
at knowing the kind
of mood or result that Ford wanted, the consistent style
of the finished pictures had to come from Ford himself.
Although he
did
occasionally
re-shoot scenes deemed
unsatisfactory
after
a picture was
officially completed,
this
rarely happened. He
always worked
quickly and
efficiently, and when the film was wrapped up, he looked
forward
to the next project instead of fussing with the
mechanical laboratory polishing of the completed work.
However, he
left the studio personnel
little option but
to
present
the
film
as he had shot
it; Ford turned
in
little
excess footage—no
alternate
shots
for
tricky
se-
quences or added closeups
to boost the ego of a
star,
in a sense he edited his films in the camera. His virtues—
a strong
pictorial sense, vigorous
action, honest
senti-
ment, the ability to get away with a plot cliche and make
it seem
fresh
and
dramatic,
the
outstanding perform-
ances
he
got from
players
(John Wayne, Victor Mc-
Laglen,
Wallace
Ford)
who
were
often weak
under
other
directors—were
as
consistent
as
his
weaknesses.
These
included
a
too-strong
penchant
for
slapstick
comedy, the professional Irishman's dislike of the British
(expressed through many barbed and overdrawn British
stereotypes), and
a sloppiness
in constructing what he
considered
unimportant
sequences.
The
use
of
back
projection, non-matching locales and cut-in closeups (as
in John Wayne's
first appearance
in Stagecoach)
, and
Straight Shooting
(Universal,
1917)
with Harry Carey and Hoot Gibson
47

Straight Shooting: A favorite location

obvious studio "exteriors" marred many Ford Westerns.
But to his credit, he never "cheated" in the big dramatic
or action scenes. Stagecoach may be
full of non-match-
ing locales
(the rugged Monument Valley locations
in
Utah
intercut
with
scenes
filmed
in drab Chatsworth,
just
a
few
miles
outside
Hollywood)
but
once Ford
sweeps
into the magnificent chase across the
salt
flats,
or follows Wayne through
the
streets of Lordsburg
in
the climax, there
is never a hint of economy or produc-
tion corner-cutting. Nor does Ford ever mind "breaking
the rules" of orthodox film-making if the pictorial results
justify
it. Many times
in the chase
in Stagecoach there
are abrupt changes in screen direction—the coach going
right to
left one moment,
left to right the next—but the
sequence
is so superbly
built that one hardly
notices.
One
such
particularly
abrupt
cut was made
solely so
that Ford could shoot directly into the sun and achieve
a marvelous tracking shot of the coach speeding along
through the dust and twilight.
Ford's films, put together, provide a surprisingly com-
prehensive survey of Americana and American history,
ranging
through
the War
of
Independence,
the
Civil
War and
its aftermath, the opening up of the West, the
decimation of the American Indian, immigration
at the
turn of the century, World War
I, prohibition and the
gangster
era,
the
great
Depression,
World
War
II,
Korea, and
in between, forays into the development of
the Iron Horse, the airplane, and the submarine. There
were frequent side-trips (often quite critical) into British
history,
too. Reasonably accurate historically
(in some
cases remarkably so), these reconstructions of America's
past have been more than a little colored by Ford's own
viewpoints
and
attitudes. As
a Naval
officer,
he
has
tended to make his service pictures strong on tradition
and glory and condescending in their semi-comic treat-
ment of the enlisted men. With the Western, however,
he has taken the detached and rose-hued view typical
of the non-Westerner. Although often authentic in detail,
his
Westerns
as
a whole were
the
exact
opposite
of
William
S. Hart's austere, hard-bitten, dusty ones. Both
were
poets
in
their
fashion,
but Hart
ofTered
a
stark
kind of poetry, whereas Ford's was warm and romanti-
cized. Hart stressed the
relationship between man and
horse; Ford took
the more
epic and grander view by
stressing man and the
land. His
films
are
full of pan-
oramic long shots
in which one
is constantly reminded
of man
in relationship to
his geographic environment,
something that Hart (more concerned in his stories with
individuals
than
with
national expansion)
never both-
ered himself with.
Ford's career began in 1914 as an actor and stuntman
for his then more famous actor-director brother, Francis.
(Francis' career dwindled rapidly after the early 1920's,
and he
is today best remembered for the series of "lov-
able drunk" characterizations that he contributed to so
many
of
John's
films.)
In
1917,
however.
Universal
signed him to a director's contract,
initially on two-reel
Westerns,
in one or two
of which he
starred
himself.
Still
calling
himself
Jack,
he
was
self-admittedly
no
actor, but Ford the director more than covered up for
Ford the thespian, and in any event the films were con-
structed to place much greater emphasis on action and
stunts than histrionics. His
initial stars were Hoot Gib-
son
and
Harry Carey;
within
a few
years, when
he
moved
to
Fox,
he would
be
directing Tom Mix and
Buck
Jones.
Because he
served
his
apprenticeship on
bread-and-butter actioners, Ford never forgot what audi-
ences really wanted from Westerns—a lack of pretention
and a maximum of action. Most of his later epic West-
erns
steadfastly refused
to be overawed by
their
size,
and continued to deliver the ingredients expected by the
hard-core
action
fans.
Even when
occasionally
shot
down by a talkative and actionless script (196rs Two
Rode Together), he kept his film visually on the move,
playing out
the long dialogue scenes on horseback or
against picturesque locations.
Of Ford's twenty-eight films made for Universal be-
tween 1917 and 1921, only one
is known to have sur-
vived.
But European
film
archives
are
re-discovering
"lost" American films
all the time, frequently obscured
through changed
titles and lack of credits, so
it
is not
altogether beyond hope
that more
of the
early Fords
may emerge in time. Obviously this was a tremendously
important group of Westerns, since not only was Ford
drawing the blueprints for
his own later and more im-
portant works,
but he was
setting new standards
in
a
style
quite opposed
to that of Hart, who was the only
other film-maker devoting himself almost exclusively to
the Western genre. Ford's plots were often quite strong
and
unusual,
but
always
uncomplicated;
action
and
photographic superiority were their common denomina-
tors. Critics who usually bypassed all of the non-William
S.
Hart
Westerns made
a point
of
singling out each
new Ford, commenting on the steady improvement of
Harry Carey
as
an
actor under Ford's
direction and
Ford's own stress on magnificent locations and grade-A
camerawork.
In reviewing The Outcasts of Poker Flat
(1919), Photoplay remarked, ".
.
. absolutely incompar-
able photography
.
.
. this
film
is an
optic symphony."
(Subsequent versions of this Bret Harte tale were strong
on
talk and dramatics, decidedly weak on visuals.)
Very
fortuitously,
the one
film from Ford's
prolific
early career that does
still exist
is his very
first feature,
Straight Shooting, made for Universal in 1917 and star-
49

Gloria Hope and
Cullen Landis
in
The Outcasts of Poker Flat
(Universal, 1919)
ring Harry Carey and Hoot Gibson. Ford's own recol-
lections of
it are vague; clearly he has greater
aflfection
for Marked Men
(1919),
an
early
version
of
Three
Godfathers, which he
later remade with John Wayne.
It's one
of the few
films before The Iron Horse that
Ford
will even
talk about. Yet good as
it undoubtedly
must have been,
it can hardly have been quite the mile-
stone
that
Straight Shooting was. Not only was
it
his
first full-length feature
(a five-reeler), but since
it was
made
in
1917,
it
is
still very close to the beginning of
his career. And for a film made by a man with literally
only six months' directorial experience behind him,
it
is
in many ways a remarkable
film. Curiously, though,
it
is not
at
all what one would expect of an early Ford.
His
later penchant for slam-bang roistering action and
low comedy, plus the fact that he had been working in
two-reelers where
the
action was
fast and
the
heroes
rowdy (one of them even frequented a bordello for plot
purposes!), would lead one to
anticipate
a rough-and-
tumble actioner for his
first feature. Yet
its Shane-like
plot-range war between
cattlemen
and homesteaders
and the intervention on behalf of the homesteaders of a
professional gunman—has surprising depth of characteri-
zation, and a rather slow, methodical build-up, punctu-
ated by one burst of violent action at the mid-way point.
and
then
culminating
in
a
spectacular and
traditional
finale:
the
shoot-out
in
the main
street,
the besieged
homesteaders, and a ride to the rescue. There
is a certain
amount of influence from William
S. Hart, but
this
is
inevitable,
since Hart's were the
only major Westerns
then being made. Tom Mix's Selig Westerns had been
generally
unimportant,
and
he
didn't
join Fox
until
1917.
Indeed, Mix's
first Fox
feature and Ford's
first
feature
were made
almost
simultaneously
and
copy-
righted only a week apart, so obviously
it was much too
early
for Ford
to have been
influenced by Mix. The
limited Hart influence can be seen
in the general aus-
terity
of
the
production
and
in
the
characters them-
selves-good and bad intermingled in both the good guys
and the bad
guys,
while
Carey's
characterization
un-
doubtedly
overlaps
into
Hart's
"good badman"
role.
The sheriff (the only player too slick and Hollywood in
his
attire)
is a nebulous and ineffectual character, and
it
is a gang of "good" outlaws (one of them "human"
enough to steal a pot of jam from the heroine's larder!)
who provide the posse for the last-minute rescue. But if
its plot and deliberate striving for realism of detail are
echoes of Hart, then there
is also a showmanship and a
production
polish
far more
typical of the
later Ford.
It
builds
its excitement
deliberately and
in a

rising tempo,
in a manner
that Hart
usually avoided,
and
it
is
unusually smooth
in
terms
of
composition,
camera set-ups, locations and lighting.
It looks far more
like a production of 1922 than of 1917. Economies are
most skilfully carried
off; for example,
all of the cabin
interiors are shot on an outdoor stage, with just a
flat
or two, but ingenious lighting, stressing the darkness "in-
side" and the
sunlight outside through the framing of
doors and windows, makes them work beautifully. The
Devil's Canyon hideout of the outlaws
(a narrow
trail
through a deep gorge)
is quite a familiar Ford location
by now; he used it again in The Iron Horse among other
films,
and
for
the
beginning
of
the
Indian
attack
in
Stagecoach. The whole climax of the film suggests that
Ford had been more than
casually
impressed by
the
climax of D. W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation. Since
Ford recently revealed that he had ridden as one of the
Klansmen
in those climactic
reels, he obviously had
a
first-hand
opportunity
to watch
Griffith
at work and
then
see the
results
of that work
in the
finished
film.
Not only in
its construction but also in its composition,
Ford's climax
is plainly related to Griffith's: the round-

ing up of the posse,
the
ride to the rescue,
individual
shots
inside
the
besieged
cabin
(a gun
barrel
being
pushed through the weakening door)— all of this height-
ened by the heroine (Molly Malone) making the most
of a slight resemblance to Mae Marsh and imitating her
as much
as
possible. Ford was
astute enough
to
rec-
ognize not only how Griffith achieved certain effects, but
also why.
Thus,
in
the sequence
of the cattlemen
as-
sembling
their
forces,
saluting
their
leader, and riding
into
ranks, he
copies
exactly
Griffith's composition
in
the parallel sequence of the assembly of the Klansmen.
An apparently huge open field is "framed" by trees and
foliage; not only
is the composition pleasing, but a few
riders thus concentrated
into center-screen
are able to
suggest
a
much
greater
assemblage.
Incidentally,
a
measure
of
the
expertise
of
the
climactic
action
and
The Horse Soldiers (United
Artists,
1959)

roundup scenes
is that many of these scenes were
still
being used
as stock shots
in "B" Westerns of the
late
thirties and
early
forties.
Though
it is easier for us to appreciate the importance
of Straight Shooting
in
retrospect, since we can recog-
nize
in
it
so many
of
the
roots
of
later Westerns,
its
merits were appreciated at the time by discerning critics.
The trade paper Moving Picture World commented:
... a
clean-cut,
straightforward
tale.
Both
the
author
and
the
director
are
to
be
congratulated
upon having selected compelling scenes and situa-
tions for the production. The Western panorama
is
set
forth
in
clear,
attractive photography and the
riding and fighting episodes are enacted with dash
and enthusiasm. So successful
is the offering that
it
deserves to rank with The Virginian and Whisper-
ing Smith.
Ford's
biggest
silent Western
epic,
and
indeed
still
one of the biggest Westerns from any period, was The
Iron Horse, made some seven years later. Marred by a
"B" picture script,
it was
still an epic in the fullest sense
of the word,
its action sequences splendidly staged and
edited, a huge organizational undertaking for a man
still
in his late twenties! James Cruze's The Covered Wagon,
made a year earlier and directly responsible for launch-
ing that
first cycle of large-scale Westerns, was a primi-
tive
film by comparison,
in every way
(except photo-
graphically) inferior to Ford's. Yet even The Iron Horse
must
yield
pride
of
place
to
Three Badmen
(1926),
Ford's
last and best silent Western. Originally intended
as a co-starring vehicle for Fox's three big action stars,
Tom Mix, Buck Jones, and George O'Brien,
it actually
emerged with O'Brien
as
the nominal
hero, and char-
acter-actors Tom
Santschi,
Frank
Campeau
and
J.
Farrell MacDonald
in the larger roles of the
title. With
a beautifully staged landrush as its highlight. Three Bad
Men was a unique blending of the austere and the tra-
ditional
with the romanticized and the streamlined.
Its
heavily sentimental plot was pure William
S. Hart and
so were the characters; yet
it was slammed over with a
production
gloss and a sense of humor that Hart had
never
achieved
(or
wanted).
Rarely
seen
these
days
and generally unavailable even for archival showings in
the United States, Three Bad M'en is a major Ford work
that should be revived
if only within the limits of film
societies and
universities. Despite
its popularity,
it was
Ford's
last Western for
thirteen
years. His success
in
other
areas
(Americana,
high
adventure,
crime
and
gangsterism) plus the apparent decline of the Western's
popularity when sound came in, removed him from the
54

genre for the balance of his contract at Fox. The studio's
"B" Westerns in the thirties (a George O'Brien series)
were
too
unimportant
to
warrant
his
attention,
and
apart from Raoul Walsh's The Big Trail in 1930, Fox
almost
totally abandoned
the
big-budget Western be-
tween
the advent of
talkies and Jesse James in
1939.
Not
until
his
classic Stagecoach (made independently
for Walter Wanger, also in 1939) did Ford return to the
Western.
Despite the renewed acclaim that

him and
its huge commercial success
(singlehandedly,
it touched
off the big new Western cycle of the early
forties), Ford seemed to show no inclination to make
any follow-ups. Only
after his second talkie Western—
My Darling Clementine in 1946, best of
all the Wyatt
Earp sagas and certainly one of Ford's best and most
disciplined films—did he embrace the horse opera whole-
heartedly again. The group that followed, many of them
in color, included two of the permanent classics of the
Western gtnxt—She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) and
The
Wagon

(1950)—while

THE PnEMi920'S ^ AND TOM MIX
In view of William
S. Hart's tremendous popularity,
it
is
to be expected that many
of the Westerns made
in
the period of his peak popularity, from 1916 to
1920,
would attempt to cash
in on both
his personal image
and his austere brand of film-making. Yet there was a
remarkable variety in the Westerns that were turned out
in this period. For one thing, of course, apart from the
very
occasional
D.
W.
Griffith,
Herbert
Brenon,
or
Theda Bara spectacular,
this was
still
well before the
period
of
the
"super" movie—and
it was even
longer
before the period of the double
bill. The average movie
program consisted of the feature
(usually
five to seven
reels
in
length),
a slapstick comedy
short,
a
travel or
"interest" film, and possibly a serial episode. The West-
ern thus had to be capable of holding
its own in com-
petition with other features and had not yet become a
staple
"filler"
of
lesser commercial importance. Many
stars, such as William Desmond and Roy Stewart, cer-
tainly
specialized
in Westerns above
all
others,
while
romantic stars such as William Farnum often proved to
be so popular
in Westerns that they stayed with them
almost
exclusively.
The popular serials of Pearl White and others often
overlapped into Western territory, although the mystery
story dominated
the
serials
in the early period, and
it
wasn't until the twenties that the Western really became
a major part of the serial
field. Helen Holmes' popular
railroading
thrillers—first
her Hazards
of Helen
one-
57

reelers and later her features—likewise were usually done
in
the
framework
and
setting
of
the
Western,
even
though most of the action revolved around locomotives.
Furthermore,
the Western could
call on
the
strong
and
well-loved
novels
of Rex
Beach, Owen
Wister,
Peter B. Kyne, and, above
all, Zane Grey—stories that
were fresh and were being brought to the screen for the
first
time. Some of the best of the early features were
good just because they were Westerns, based on stories
that were
actionful and told
in visual terms, thus pre-
senting less of a challenge to fledgling screenwriters who
still tended to construct "scenarios" in terms of tableaux
and
lists of shots.
Rex Beach's The Spoilers, filmed for the first time in
1914
by
the
Selig Company
(and remade
four times
since) was a quite remarkable film for that date. Run-
ning
for close
to ninety minutes,
it managed
to avoid
confusion despite a multiplicity of characters, created a
creditably
realistic picture of a muddy, brawling, gold-
mining boom town, and was the
first Western to build
deliberately
to a grand-scale
fistic battle for
its climax.
Without doubles
(and admittedly without some of the
spectacular
if
improbable
thrills
that
stuntmen
could
have added),
William Farnum and Tom Santschi put
on a rousing fight that looked real
all the way, and was
climaxed by Farnum's
victory and,
as the Cavalry
ar-
rived
to
arrest the defeated
villain,
the classic
line:
"I
broke him—with my hands." Only in
its
titling,
in fact,
did the film reveal any hesitancy, for every line of dia-
logue
also
identified the speaker, and sometimes when
two-way
conversations were reported on
a
single
title
there were two
or three
such
identifications
per
title.
Thus,
it was like reading a page from a play, and for a
moment one was taken entirely out of the movie. How-
ever,
this
literary
echo
lasted
briefly;
learning
from
Griffith,
directors soon discovered how
to
edit so that
audiences knew exactly who was saying what, without
being
told.
Griflith
himself,
having
spent
so much
time
with
Westerns in his Biograph days, now had little interest in
them. He produced (but did not direct) Martyrs of the
Alamo, a historical Western that was the
first feature to
deal with the Sam Houston-Santa Ana conflict in Texas
and Mexico, and he personally directed Scarlet Days, a
Richard Barthelmess
vehicle that was one of the pot-
boilers
he made
between
grander-scale
endeavors
in
Dustin Farnum and
Red Wing in The Squawman
(Famous Players,
Cecil B. DeMille, 1913)
58

order to keep product flowing and salaries paid. (Let
it
be
noted,
a
Griffith
potboiler was
usually
better than
another
director's super-special!)
But, more's the
pity,
he never devoted
himself
to an
important,
large-scale
Western
spectacle
to match The Birth
of a Nation or
Orphans
of
the
Storm,
although
his
1924
America,
dealing with the Revolutionary War on the Eastern sea-
board, did contain many elements of the Western, and
some of the
biggest and best organized Indian fighting
scenes ever filmed. Cecil B. DeMille made Westerns
in
this
pre- 1920
period,
however,
as
did
Henry
King.
King's Westerns, made for the American Film Company
and starring William Russell, were curious
in their an-
ticipation
of
his
best
later
Westerns.
Like The Gun-
fighter, they stressed mood,
tension, realism and natu-
ralistic qualities far more than action. However, unlike
The
Gunfighter,
their
plots were
fairly
standard
and
needed action. King's early work was thus commendably
off-beat,
but
not
very
successful,
although
the popu-
larity
of
star
William
Russell
carried them
through.
King was
to
find
his
true niche
in the Americana of
Tol'able David in 1921, and thereafter his best Westerns
were those which stressed characterization and a feeling
for time and place rather than melodrama and action.
Because appearing in a Western was a sure-fire way
to build popularity and was far from the "slumming"
it
came to be regarded as later, many of the biggest stars
of the pre- 1920 era were ready and willing to appear in
horse operas. Dustin Farnum had
set the pattern with
DeMille's The Squawman, and in his wake came J. War-
ren
Kerrigan,
Charles
Ray,
Harold
Lockwood,
and
Wallace Reid. Mae Marsh made The Wild Girl of the
Sierras, and another
Griffith heroine—lovely and
lively
Dorothy Gish—kidded
the genre
beautifully
in Nugget
Nell.
Next to Charlie Chaplin (who never got closer to a
Western,
straight
or
otherwise,
than The Gold Rush)
the biggest stars of those years were Mary Pickford and
Douglas Fairbanks, both of whom numbered Westerns
among their biggest successes. (In fact, Mary's last film,
the
1933
Secrets, was
basically
a
Western,
albeit an
emotional one.) Pickford
is too often shrugged aside as
merely
a
sentimental,
golden-curled
figure. But
while
sentiment and pathos
certainly figured
in many of her
films, so did stark drama, action, and even horror. There
was
nothing wishy-washy
about our Mary,
especially
J. Warren Kerrigan (center),
a colorless star of actionless
two-reel Westerns.
In
this
unidentified
circa
1914
film,
Harold Lloyd (extreme
right)
is playing a
bit.

Typical examples of indepen-
dent 1914 Westerns prior to
/illiam S. Hart's establishment
of a dynamic hero
Cameo of Yellowstone
prior
to
1920,
and
her
Westerns had
a
tremendous
amount of vigor and sheer
guts. The Romance of the
Redwoods
(directed
by
Cecil
B.
DeMille)
had good
Indian fighting scenes and plenty of strong drama, while
in M'liss Mary rushes ta rescue an innocent victim from
a lynch mob, points out the actual miscreant, and looks
on approvingly as he
is taken off to be strung up from
the nearest tree!
The Douglas Fairbanks Westerns were unique, and
are
still as fresh and delightful as they ever were. First
at
Triangle,
and
then
later
at Paramount, Doug was
working on the same lot as William S. Hart. Hart took
his Westerns very
seriously, but occasionally when he
wanted to
let his hair down—only a
trifle of course—he
would do a story about the strong, silent Westerner who
comes East with
his strength and
integrity to confound
the
city crooks.
(Branding Broadway had him chasing
the
villain on horseback through Central Park.) Doug,
on
the other hand, never took
his films seriously, and
found in the West a perfect outlet for a modern tongue-
in-cheek D'Artagnan. Thus Doug's scripts (usually writ-
ten by Anita Loos and John Emerson) often found him
as the cowboy-crazy Easterner, chained to a dull desk
60
Jerry and the Gunman

A Child of the Desert
job,
wishing he had been born
in an earUer
age, and
then going out West where he proves to be a tougher,
rougher buckaroo than any of them. Such films as Wild
and
Woolly,
Manhattan Madness and
Knickerbocker
Buckaroo enabled Doug
to
indulge
in
acrobatics,
kid
modern
foibles,
expound
his
optimistic
philosophy
(practical only
if one had the unlimited funds to follow
one's dreams instead of earning a living), and
satirize
Western
cliches and
traditions,
all
in one
fell swoop.
Doug's films moved like lightning, were as funny as they
were thrilling, and had a grace, charm and zip that his
later
swashbucklers
lacked. Mack
Sennett
had
been
satirizing Westerns
for
years,
of course.
Sennett's His
Bitter
Pill,
with
bulky Mack
Swain
lampooning
Bill
Hart, was a classic of its kind. Even Griffith, in his rural
romance Hoodoo Ann
(1916),
has Mae Marsh
and
Bobby Harron go to a small-town movie house, where
they
see
a Western with Carl Stockdale's hero a neat
burlesque
of
Hart.
The
movie-within-a-movie
also
kidded what had already become cliches of carelessness
and lack of continuity, such as the hero falling under a
bullet so badly aimed that
it couldn't have passed within
six
feet
of him.
This kind of
satire grew
in number and
subtlety
as
the Westerns
themselves grew
in
popularity,
reaching
its
height
in
the
early twenties with
Sennett's
feature
Small Town Idol
(with Ben Turpin
as a Western
star
returning to his Western home town) and Hal Roach's
Uncensored Movies, in which Will Rogers does devastat-
ingly accurate takeoffs on Bill Hart and Tom Mix. Fair-
banks'
satires, however, were on the Western genre as
a whole, taking
in the dime novel and the paintings of
Frederick Remington for good measure, and they were
wholeheartedly
affectionate. Fairbanks loved the West
as much as Hart, but he loved
it for what
it stood for
rather than
for what
it was; he never romanticized
it
and was shrewd enough to include a scene near the end
of
his
films
where
he
admitted
he had been
a
fool,
whereupon the level-headed Westerners (and the hero-
ine)
accepted him for what he was.
Even the great Fatty Arbuckle made a Western dur-
ing this period, and oddly enough
it wasn't a knockabout
spoof.
The Roundup had
a
relatively
straightforward
story
(the same studio, Paramount, remade
it early
in
the
forties)
and
Arbuckle
v/as
praised
for
his
acting.
Actually in a secondary role, he played a genial sheriff
61

much
in
the manner of Eugene Pallette
in the
talkies.
As the teen-years rolled on towards the twenties, the
star system began to assert and categorize
itself, and
it
became apparent that certain stars would always enjoy
their greatest popularity in Westerns. Universal had de-
veloped Hoot Gibson and Harry Carey. Roy Stewart,
Triangle's follow-up star to William
S. Hart, had none
of
Hart's
creativity
or
individual
style,
but
still
built
quite
a
following.
Franklyn
Farnum,
in
two-reelers,
seemed to be another star to watch, but his career never
really took
off, and
it was a supporting player in those
shorts—Buck Jones—who achieved
real fame.
Fans were
irked by
stars who, on
their own
or
at
their
studio's
insistence, gave themselves names which
suggested
kinship
with
established
stars:
Neal
Hart,
William
Fairbanks. Even
though some
of
these
stars
were
attractive
personalities, and
as
actors and
action
performers
often
superior
to
others,
the ingrained
re-
sentment against them remained and their careers were
usually brief and limited to quickie productions. Never-
theless, their presence served to help establish the begin-
ning of the
roster of players who would devote them-
selves
exclusively
to Westerns,
a
roster, and
a
genre,
that was given tremendous impetus by the advent of the
most popular Western star of them
all, Tom Mix.
When Mix ultimately became a big star at Fox, pub-

licity
created
a biography
for him
far more
colorful
than any of his movie roles. But no matter how exag-
gerated
this may have been, there
is no doubt that he
did have
a rugged and
adventurous
life
prior
to
his
movie days, seeing action with the Army in the Spanish-
American War and the Philippine insurrection, breaking
horses for the British for use against the Boers in Africa,
and
serving
for
a
period
as
a
deputy
United
States
marshal
in Oklahoma. He had
also been a champion
rodeo rider and performer with the Miller Brothers 101
Ranch Show. So with
all this material to draw upon,
it
is not surprising that Fox's publicity department
built
him up into a composite of Wyatt Earp and D'Artagnan!
Actually, with so much activity (and three of his five
wives)
behind
him, Mix was on the point
of
settling
down to sedate ranch life when he entered into a minor
business deal with the Selig Company. They were about
to shoot a semi-documentary short entitled Ranch Life
in
the Great South
West, and Mix
offered
his
ranch,
livestock, and advisory services. The project was finished
and apparently forgotten; Mix had no great interest m
pursuing a career
in movies.
Later, however, the Selig
people contacted him again, offered him a rather vague
job
in
which
he
would
handle
livestock,
double
for
actors
in
tricky
action
scenes, and generally advise
in
the production
of a
series of Westerns. Mix accepted,
and was permanently assigned to the company's
Cali-
fornia studio. Although active and, for a while prosper-
ous,
Selig was a minor company
in terms of creativity
or
concrete
contributions
to
the development
of
film.
They specialized
in Westerns, jungle pictures, and con-
temporary crime stories. Unlike the Biograph, Ince, and
Vitagraph
studios,
they
nurtured
but
few
embryonic
talents. Mix was the only really big name ever to emerge
from an apprenticeship there. However, between 1911
and 1917—the period of William
S. Hart's ascendancy,
and of Broncho Billy Anderson's rise and decline—Mix
made almost a hundred
films, primarily one- and two-
reelers, for Selig.
Initially they were artless, off-the-cuff
affairs, loosely strung together without scripts, and con-
centrating as much on folksy comedy in the Will Rogers
vein as on traditional action. (Mix had been a friend of
64

Rogers, and may well have deliberately tried to cultivate
a Rogers "image" for himself since Rogers had, as yet,
show^n no
inclination
to
try
the movies
himself.) On
many of the
films, Mix was
star, author and
director,
an ambitious undertaking for one with such a modicum
of
creative and
business
ability
in
his background.
If
for nothing else. Mix deserves credit for turning out so
much product so regularly. Too,
his films improved as
they went
along. Mix gradually dropped the
stress on
comedy (Why
the
Sheriff
Is a Bachelor)
in
favor
of
vehicles which
really allowed him to display his riding
and stunting prowess (The Stagecoach Driver and the
Lady, Pony Express Rider).
Many of the early
entries
in
the
series were simple
comedies
or dramas about the making of Westerns—
cunning way of making movies with even less set dress-
ing than usual—and some of them, like Sagebrush Tom
(the cowboys decide to stage a Western version of Quo
Vadis?) have added
historic
value today
in
that
they
have
thus
preserved
detailed
coverage
of
the
Selig
working
methods,
shots
of
camera
equipment,
even
closeups
of
studio note-paper with
instructions
to the
crew.
But
as
a
group,
the Tom Mix
Westerns were
generally mild and
inferior to such
Selig "specials"
as
The
Spoilers or
a
1913 William Duncan
vehicle. The
Range Law. Mix did graduate into features under Selig,
but most of them were loosely assembled and padded
with too much bantering comedy. Later, with Mix a big
name
star
at
Fox,
Selig
created "new" Mix
features
like Twisted Trails by taking old shorts and, with con-
siderable
ingenuity,
re-editing and
re-titling them into
five-reel features. After devoting considerable footage to
heroine Bessie Eyton from a non-Mix
film, they finally
meet
(in a scene from one of their two-reelers) and a
title informs us "Thus were the twisted trails of the boy
and
girl joined together!" With the exception of 1914's
Chip of the Flying U, which had a good original story
(by Peter B. Kyne) and a good director (Colin Camp-
bell, who
also
directed The
Spoilers
that same
year)
none of Mix's Selig films made much impression. On the
other hand,
relatively few of them are extant for reap-
praisal today, so
it
is unfair to condemn them all out of
hand. But since they failed to make Mix a big star over
a six-year period, one can
safely assume that the ma-
jority of them were routine at best.
However, Mix's rugged riding and action
skills had
attracted
the
attention
of Fox
executives.
Fox,
then
perhaps
the
biggest
of
all
the
studios,
offered Mix a
contract and, he went to work for them in
1917. Al-
though his
first trial balloon there was a two-reeler that
he wrote and directed himself (Six Cylinder Love), he
immediately thereafter switched to full features, and left
Tom Mix
65

The Cyclone (Fox,
1920)
with Tom Mix, Colleen Moore
the
direction
to veterans
better qualified
to handle
it:
Chester and Sidney Franklin, Lynn Reynolds, Lambert
Hiller.
From
the
beginning.
Mix
was
handled
as
a
unique
property,
designed
to be
as
different from the
reigning Western king, William S. Hart, as possible. His
films were to include liberal doses of comedy and small-
child appeal. (Youngsters undoubtedly adored Hart for
a while, but he made no attempt to cultivate their con-
tinued favor by including elements in his films expressly
designed to please them.) Furthermore, they were to be
rugged and
action-packed,
but
essentially
non-violent.
Gradually a deliberate kind of "circus" format was cre-
ated
for
the Mix
films. They were
full
of
fights and
chases,
essentially
realistic in such details as costuming
and
locations,
but
emphatically
escapist
in
dramatic
terms. No
serious
issues were ever
raised by
the Mix
plots, and nobody was expected to take them too
seri-
ously. As their popularity increased, so did their story-
lines
tend
to become
even
less
realistic. Tom's
plots
provided him
with
sojourns
in Arabia and
Ruritania.
Essentially up-to-the-minute, they concentrated on mod-
ern speed—locomotives,
racing
cars, ocean
liners,
air-
planes were
frequently incorporated
into his
stories as
props on which even more action could be hung. Only
twice did Mix really misfire, once in Dick Turpin (fans
would not accept him out of Western costume or, even
sympathetically, on
the wrong
side of
the law
as
the
British highwayman), and again in Riders of the Purple
Sage.
This
mid-twenties
adaptation
of the Zane Grey
novel was a perfect example of the wrong kind of vehicle
for Mix. A strong, dramatic yarn that would have been
ideally suited for Hart,
it presented Mix as a revenge-
obsessed
wanderer.
Its
complicated
story-line
left
too
little room
for
action, and the three-dimensional Mix
character had
to
be
taken
seriously and
believed
in.
But the bulk of his pictures avoided these mistakes.
Action rather than logic remained the keynote, and Mix
went out of his way to devise elaborate stunt sequences
(most of which he performed without doubles) or bits
of business which could spotlight action but never gra-
tuitous
violence.
Despite
horrendous
threats
by
the
villains, the death-rate
in the Mix films was practically
nil. He would subdue
a
victim with
his
fists
or with
some
fancy
lasso
work,
rarely by
shooting him,
and
never by killing him. In contrast, William S. Hart was a
deadly, no-nonsense avenger behind a pair of six-guns,
and even
Douglas
Fairbanks,
in
his
spoof
Wild and
Woolly,
casually
shot the unarmed captured
villain
in
the knee
to make him "stay put" while he rode
off to
rescue
the
heroine!
Mix's
unlikely
but
likeable
hero,
clean-living to a
fault, possessed of no vices
(certainly
not smoking and drinking) and
all the virtues, was not
66

absurd
in
his own make-believe world, and
for a long
time to come set the pattern of behavior for all Western
heroes.
Since
he
always
delivered
the
entertainment
goods in terms of good stories and lively action, no one
quibbled at his radical departure from the previous tra-
ditions
laid down by Hart. Moreover, Mix's films were
always good
to look
at. He used the
best cameramen
available (Dan Clark was his most frequently used) and
made
a
point
of shooting many
of
his
films amid the
stunning scenery
of the
national
parks. Sky High,
for
example, was
shot
almost
entirely
in and around
the
Grand Canyon,
its action ranging from a rugged fight on
the banks
of the churning Colorado River
to
exciting
and precarious chases along the narrow trails lining the
chasm walls and aerial stunting in a plane skimming the
rim of the canyon. Together with Just Tony, The Great
K and A
Train Robbery
(using the Denver and Rio
Grande Railroad, this contained some of Mix's best and
most elaborate stunts). The Lone Star Ranger and The
Rainbow
Trail, Sky High was one of Mix's
best.
By
the
mid-twenties. Mix was
earning
a
salary
of
seventeen thousand dollars a week—and living
it up ac-
cordingly! However, he more than earned
it. Fox, no
longer as successful as
it had been in the pre- 1920 era,
needed the huge profits from the Mix pictures. Without
them, such classic films as Sunrise—iht kind of film that
every
studio wanted
to make
for
"prestige" purposes,
even though they could never show a real profit—could
not have been made.
Despite their huge success. Fox and Mix (the guiding
impresario behind his own films, though he only physi-
cally directed two of his more than
sixty films for the
studio)
were
wise
enough
not
to
tamper
with
their
formula. Even
at his peak. Mix limited himself to five-
and six-reel features that really moved and gave the fans
just what they wanted. No pretention ever crept into his
films, though

success
assured, more money
was
occasionally
allocated
to

Ford made two
of the Mix features)

porting casts. But not a nickel was ever spent on weigh-

This was a lesson that Republic Studios, number-one
makers of Westerns in the talkie era, several times failed
to remember. Having built Bill Elliott into a top Western
star via a
series of expert and fast-moving "B"s, they
changed
Bill to William and promoted him to nine-reel
historical western "special," in which he was tied down
by frock coats and
silk
shirts,
reels of dialogue, studio
"exteriors" and back projection, and far too
little fresh
air,
horses, and wagons.
Expensive
films
like
In Old
Sacramento and The Plainsman and the Lady contained
not a quarter of the action or appeal of his five-reelers,
and he
lost much of his popularity until he reverted to
his former style—and scale—with a good "B" series for
Monogram. To a degree. Republic made the same mis-
take with Roy Rogers and Gene Autry, too, though they
remedied
it before too much damage was done.
But Fox
learned
its
lesson
very
quickly with Dick
Turpin and Riders
of
the Purple Sage, and never
let
Mix step out of his class. The result was the most con-
sistently satisfying and commercially successful series of
"small"
Westerns
in
the
history
of the
movies. They
sounded
the
death-knell
for William
S.
Hart,
rapidly
overtaking
him
in
popularity. He
neither
could
nor
wanted to compete, and gradually, though with distinc-
tion and honor, he let himself be eased out of the movies,
to be replaced not only by Mix himself, but by the new
breed of cowboy he had brought to the screen. Two of
the best of them, Buck Jones and George O'Brien, came
from the ranks of Mix's own crews, while by the early
twenties, many
others—Hoot
Gibson,
Fred Thomson,
Ken Maynard, Tim McCoy, Yakima Canutt—were ready
to cash
in on and expand the streamlined new format
that Mix had established. The austerity of Hart and his
"strong, silent" image were too firmly entrenched to be
entirely dismissed, and his breed of Westerner
still had
its loyal following. Hart himself remained
in Westerns
until
1925,
and Harry
Carey,
Jack
Holt,
Art Acord
and a handful of others continued to make Westerns in
the Hart manner. But, for the most part. Mix had suc-
ceeded
in
establishing
a formula both
for
the
series-
Western and
for the Western hero
that would remain
unchanged
until the small Western
itself bit the dust in
the mid-1950's, scalped by the impossible odds of rising
production costs and driven
off their ranges by the in-
roads of television, just as surely as the Red Indians had
been decimated by the coming of the Iron Horse and
the slaughter of the buffalo herds.

THE FIRST EPICS
Although the huge popularity of the Tom Mix Westerns
certainly
increased
the
box-office
value
of
the
horse
opera and
stimulated more production
in the
area of
the two-reeler,
it did not materially increase the number
of feature-length Westerns being made. That catharsis
came in 1923 with Paramount's production of The Cov-
ered Wagon. Based on a novel by Emerson Hough,
it
initially was put into production as a result of the suc-
cess
of William
S.
Hart's Wagon
Tracks. Made very
largely on location, with relatively minor stars
(its big-
gest name, Mary Miles
Minter, had withdrawn
to be
replaced by
Lois Wilson),
it almost unwittingly grew
into epic proportions, and in fact became the
first real
super-Western.
Its success with both
critics and public
was instantaneous, although it does not survive the years
well, and today seems
a disappointing and
unexciting
film. Yet
it
is one of the key Western films, one of per-
haps no more than half-dozen that have made a major
contribution to the development of the genre. Some, like
Stagecoach, made
that
contribution
in
an
artistic
or
commercial
sense. The Covered Wagon, on the other
hand,
is a "milestone" film, supremely important in that
by being made
at
all
it introduced the epic tradition to
the Western,
and
gave
it
scale and
poetic and docu-
mentary
values. Thanks
mainly
to
the
grandeur
and
panoramic
beauty
of Karl Brown's camerawork,
it
is
easy to understand why
it so captured the imagination
of audiences
in
1923. John Ford's The Iron Horse of
70

1924
is as entertainment far more exciting and
as film
far more creative, but
it undoubtedly owes
its existence
to the prior success of The Covered Wagon.
The major liability of The Covered Wagon lies in the
work of James Cruze, who was one of the most success-
ful and highest-paid directors of the
silent screen, and
whose simple, uncomplicated style found a certain favor
then. But
in
retrospect one can see
that almost
all
of
his
silents were
far superior
in theme and content to
execution, and
almost without exception were
stoogy,
plodding,
unimaginative works. This
is
especially
true
of
his
big
epics
of American
history
(including Old
Ironsides and the talkie Sutter's Gold), although oddly
enough, some of his less ambitious silents and later, rela-
tively unimportant talkies, revealed real talent and filmic
flair.
Cruze
used
little
of
the
basic grammar
of
the
film, and The Covered Wagon seems an especially dull
film in comparison with Grifiith's Orphans of the Storm
of the previous year. He seldom moved his camera, and
even the
usually foolproof runaway horse sequence
is,
in
The
Covered
Wagon, handled
in
one
single
long
shot (exactly, in fact, as Edwin S. Porter had handled a
runaway horse sequence in Lije of an American Police-
man
in
1905, except that even Porter had the
instinct
to break
it up into a series of static long shots). Cruze
likewise cared nothing for the cumulative effect of edit-
ing, and
the Cavalry's
ride to
the rescue
is almost
as
staid and matter-of-fact as the lacklustre ride in Edison's
The Corporal's Daughter, discussed earlier, though sheer
size was something of a saving grace with Cruze. And
despite
automatically
recreating
the
conditions
of
an
old wagon train trek, Cruze also seemed
indifferent to
the demands
of realism.
If he couldn't shoot genuine
riding closeups on location, then better none at all than
the patently phony ones (a man bobbing up and down
on
a
barrel
against
a moving cycloramic background)
utilized in the buffalo hunt sequence. And as
Bill Hart
observed
somewhat
contemptuously,
no wagonmaster
worth his salt would camp his train in a box canyon in
the heart of Indian territory! Even allowing for the fact
that the film was started as a programmer and the script
rewritten and enlarged
in production
as
it became ap-
parent
that
this would emerge
as
a
"big"
picture,
it
contains some
very barren
writing. There
is no
vital,
dramatic
sense
of opening up new
frontiers; even the
period
is
a
bit
hazy, and
the
subtitles constantly
fall
back on dates and gratuitous references to Lincoln and
Brigham Young
as
a means
of documenting what
is
going
on. Nor
is
the
cinematic
reconstruction
of
the
period helped by the balance between incidents; a con-

than

which
is treated
in a completely offhand manner.
But much
of
the
scope
and
richness
of
the
film's
visual tapestry does
still have power, as does the superb
work of Ernest Torrence and Tully Marshall as the two
old
scouts. The panoramic scenes of the wagon
train,
the
near-documentary
footage
of
campfire-singing,
a
burial,
a
river-crossing and
the hazards
of snow and
mud, are
still stirring and pictorially very beautiful. (A
prairie
fire sequence was cut after the
initial road-show
runs, probably because
it was so brief and prosaic as to
be merely frustrating in the framework of an epic.) But
filmically stagnant though
it may seem today. The Cov-
ered Wagon must
still rank with The Great Train Rob-
bery,
the
first works
of William
S.
Hart, and
Ford's
Stagecoach as one of the most influential Westerns of all
time.
Its place
in film history
is an important one, even
if
its place
in film
art
is limited to the camerawork of
Karl Brown. And
its place in the commercialization of
the Western speaks for
itself. The year prior to
its re-
lease saw the production of a mere
fifty Western fea-
tures, and apart from the Mix and Hart films most of
these
were
relatively
unimportant
programmers
with
such stars as Francis Ford and Roy Stewart, while even
the better non-star Westerns, such as King Vidor's un-
derrated and charming The Sky Pilot, created little
stir.
But in the year following the release of The Covered
Wagon,
the
number
of
Westerns
in
circulation
was
tripled. The biggest and most successful of all the follow-
ups was, of course, John Ford's The Iron Horse, made
for Fox.
It succeeded in developing the sense of urgency
and
pride
in
national
progress
that had been
largely
absent from Cruze's film, and
it was to be of consider-
able
influence on
such
later
films
as DeMille's
Union
Pacific, the British The Great Barrier (about the build-
ing of the Canadian Pacific Railroad), and the Russian
Turksib,
while
the many
lesser and standardized
rail-
road Westerns of the Mties—Kansas Pacific, Santa Fe,
The Denver and the Rio Grande, and others—inevitably,
if not intentionally, derived much from
it.
Although The Iron Horse was
his
first spectacular,
Ford had
already made almost
forty Westerns. While
this was an epic in every sense of the word, he wasn't
overawed by the importance of his work.
It
is big and
massive and yet, unlike so many historical super-West-
erns
(especially Frank Lloyd's Wells Fargo),
it doesn't
allow itself to slow down into
stiff tableaux. The action,
though a trifle slow in starting,
is rugged and vigorous.
The climax with
its massed Indian
fighting,
the loco-
72

motive racing men to the rescue, and hero and
villain
settling matters with a personal
fistic bout,
is one of the
most exciting such sequences ever put on
film.
If any-
thing,
its epic theme
is occasionally marred by Ford's
great affection for the smaller Western, his insistence on
milking raucous slapstick scenes for more than they are
worth, and
a
basic
plot-line
(a man's
search through
the
years
for
his
father's
murderer)
Ufted from
any
grade-"B" Western.
Ford emulated Cruze and The Covered Wagon by
shooting almost
all
of
his
film, under great hardships,
on
location. There
is a minimum of studio work, and
the film was completed under much the same conditions
as the original Union Pacific railroad, the unit building
itself complete towns
as
it moved
along and
using a
train of
fifty-six coaches
for transportation. But other-
wise. Ford's film was the very antithesis of Cruze's
stiff
one with
its
deliberate underplaying of the big
action
highlights.
Cruze's
big
Indian
battle had been
sharp,
massive, but almost casually thrown away, with no
at-
tempt
to
build excitement. He would
get one
shot
of
charging
Indians and
then
forget them.
Ford, on
the
other hand, shot his riders from all angles, intercut them,
built his excitement steadily, and constantly changed the
vantage point of his cameras. Despite its superior action
content.
The
Iron Horse
did
not
duplicate
the
great
critical acclaim of The Covered Wagon, but
it did enjoy
huge popular
success,
ran
for
a year
at
the
Lyric
in
New
York,
and won
the
praise and endorsement
of
governmental and educational bodies. One 1924

termed
it "An American Odyssey," a phrase that seems
peculiarly
appropriate
to
so many
of Ford's
films
of
Americana.
Oddly enough,
the dual success of these two
initial
epic
Westerns
did
not
spur
a whole
cycle
of
similar
follow-ups, and
the documenting
of Wells Fargo and
Western
Union
and
of
the
taming
of Dodge
City,
Wichita, and other frontier towns,
all had to await the
coming of the sound
film. To be truly successful
in a
commercial sense, the epic needs to feed off a feeling of
national pride and patriotism, and in return can perform
propagandist as well
as entertainment services.
It
is no
coincidence that the most effective of the Western epics
were made
in
periods when America most needed
a
sense of national pride and a rekindling of the pioneer
spirit—during the
early days
of the Depression and
at
the beginning of World War
II.
It can be argued that
America
certainly needed
that sense
of national pride
during the twenties, but the film can only reflect
it, not
create
it. The twenties were an era of moral and legal
upheaval, when
it was deemed smart to take a drink
merely because
it was against the law, and when divorce
and Freud were considered the sophisticated subjects for
conversation.
In such
a
milieu,
and
against
a
back-
ground
of
fun
and
plenty,
appeals
to
national
pride
seemed
Victorian and
old-fashioned,
and
films which
took a patriotic stand were automatically deemed quaint
and out-of-date. (Ironically, most of them have survived
rather well, and
it is the "modern" sophisticated films of
the
twenties
that tend
to
date most
of
all.)
Griffith's
America
(dealing with the Revolutionary War) was a
casualty of this atmosphere, and the consensus was that
the Cruze and Ford epics had scored on their
action,
their size, perhaps even on their beauty and poetry, but
not on their themes.
This seemed to be confirmed when James Cruze fol-
lowed up The Covered Wagon with another historical
Western, The Pony Express. Again,
it was a
stiff and
disjointed
film. There were
too many
characters,
too
much interweaving of a stereotyped fictional story with
involved political history. The action—particularly a big
Indian raid for the climax—was big and impressive, but

again unexciting. The most interesting aspect of the film
was the surprisingly accurate use of Jack Slade (played
by George
Bancroft)
as
the
villain. Not only
did he
manage
to
turn most
situations
to
his
advantage and
emerge triumphant, prosperous, and unpunished

but he even contrived
to have

crimes! (An
interesting and unorthodox
character, Slade was
later the
subject
of a reasonably
honest if somewhat neurotic biography in the fifties, with
Mark
Stevens both playing the
role and
directing the
film.) However, the failure of The Pony Express can't
altogether be laid to
its limitations as a film. Although
bogged down in plot complications and lacking the sus-
tained
visual sweep of The Covered Wagon,
it wasn't
spectacularly inferior to
it. The public obviously was not
sympathetic
to
the
epic
as
a
genre. But The Covered

ern, and Hollywood exploited

(Irvin

who was
a
specialist
in
thrills and movement—they switched
their
emphasis to a long-running series of Zane Grey adapta-
tions. Where these had built-in epic qualities, as in The
Vanishing American, a Richard Dix "special," they were
deliberately minimized and reshaped to formula Western
level. Universal's Flaming Frontier, dealing with Custer's
Last Stand, was sold not on
its epic qualities, but on
its
star
cast
(Dustin Farnum, Hoot Gibson, and
others)
and on its spectacular action. 1925 set a new high-water
mark
in
the number of Westerns,
big and
small,
that
Hollywood had produced. New stars were emerging to
meet the demand; prominent directors-to-be

were
learning
their
trade
in
the
best school
of
all—making
Western films that moved, making them
fast, and mak-
ing them cheaply; and the quickie producers were com-
ing in, like sooners in a landrush, capitalizing on a great
and
suddenly popular
genre, cheapening
it,
hastening
the arrival of the double-bill program. The genuine epic
was
temporarily pushed
aside,
but
the Western
as
a
popular form of mass entertainment was launched and
established
as never before, with a whole host of new
Western stars joining Tom Mix

ST/lRS OF THE TWENTHIS
Almost anything can be "proved" by
statistics.
In the
sixties, the television rating specialists could show that
on
a given night
jr-million viewers saw a Specific
tele-
vision Western, and since that exceeded the number that
saw any given theatrical Western with Tom Mix, then,
O.E.D.,
that
television
star
is
automatically
the most
popular Western
star
of
all
time!
Forgotten
are such
intangibles
as the
fact that the show might have been
the
best
of
several
mediocrities
available
that
night,
that ninety per cent of those who tuned in might have
tuned out again five minutes later, that they didn't have
to pay or exert themselves in any way, and that once the
ratings fell and the series was cancelled, that fantastically
popular Western
star might never be heard
of
again!
80
The
relative
failure
of such
popular TV cowboys
as
Hugh O'Brian and James Arness in theatrical Westerns
is
proof
positive
that
genuine
popularity
has
to
be
earned. Stars of the twenties really had to work for and
earn
first their stardom, and then their popularity—but
that popularity, once earned, was never lost. Moviegoers
of the silent days offered genuine love and admiration to
their favorites, not merely manufactured overnight idola-
try. They picked the star whose work or whose type of
Western
most
appealed
to
them,
and
they remained
loyal
through
the bad
pictures
as
well
as
the
good.
Children who grew up on Ken Maynard or Hoot Gibson
in the twenties may have seen fewer Westerns
as they
grew to maturity, but they would always remember them

with genuine affection and spring to their defense when
the latest singing cowboy was hailed as the successor to
their throne.
The redoubtable Ida Belaney of Brooklyn
is an ex-
ample:
a lady with an amazing
recall of
all the Buck
Jones
films,
including the
ones where he doubled
or
stunted for Tom Mix, the plot-lines, the dialogue in the
talkies. How many
television
watchers,
four
decades
hence,
can
be
expected
to
demonstrate
such
erudite
devotion
to
the
careers
of Qint Eastwood
or Wayne
Maunder? The innate good judgment of the moviegoing
public has always been underrated. That public discov-
ered Fairbanks, Chaplin, Pickford, and Laurel & Hardy
long before the
critics did, and that same public made
deserved
stars of Tom Mix, Fred Thomson and Buck
Jones,
rejecting
those who
had
nothing
to
offer—Al
Hoxie, Don Coleman, Dick Hatton, Fred Humes. While
the mediocrities deservedly
fell by the wayside, the line-
up
of Western
stars
in
the
twenties was
so
rich and
varied
that many who were deserving of success, but
lacked
that
little
extra
individual
something,
likewise
failed
to make the grade. Wally Wales (who later
re-
named himself Hal Taliaferro) and Edmund Cobb were
two athletic, able, and likeable stars whose pictures were
usually enjoyable, but who never made even the second
echelon
of
stars. They became
better known
as char-
acter
actors
and
villains
in
the
sound
era, Wales
in
particular developing a distinctive make-up, costuming
and speaking style that made him instantly recognizable.
Small wonder that stars like these and Bob Custer, Jack
Perrin, Guinn Williams and Tex
(later Kermit) May-
nard made
little headway
in
the
face of such an on-
slaught of Western stars from the early twenties on.
Fred Thomson was the closest rival to Mix. His initial
Western series, made for FBO, was carefully patterned
after
the Mix
formula:
lighthearted,
fast,
filled
with
stunt action (Thomson was a splendid athlete, and used
few doubles )
, and backed by top directors and camera-
men. They were handsome to look
at and they moved
like
lightning.
Thomson
was
a
rugged,
goodlooking
fellow who had studied for the priesthood, and because
of this he stressed strong moral values, avoided sex and
undue violence, intended his films to be a good influence
on youth as well as entertaining them, and often worked
in subplots (one involving the Boy Scouts, for example)
that he felt would be meaningful to youngsters. At times
he went even farther than Mix with his action sequences,
emulating Fairbanks
in
bringing
in
(as
in Thundering
Hoofs)
comedy
or
action
stunt
sequences
that
were
quite extraneous to the basic
plot-line. And while Mix
usually
dressed
fairly
realistically on
screen,
reserving
his
expensive
uniform-costumes
for
personal
appear-

ances, Thomson constantly wore colorful costumes that
smacked more of the rodeo than the range. His career
was
tragically
brief;
after
the
expiration
of
his FBO
contract,
he moved
to Paramount
to
star
in Western
specials, of which Jesse James
is the best remembered,
but died suddenly
at the peak of his popularity.
Art Acord
is a prime example of the star whose repu-
tation has been sustained almost solely by his legions of
loyal devotees. Almost nothing
is
left of Acord's work
today; we can see him playing two different extra roles
in the early Ince film The Indian Massacre, and we can
see one or two of his
last, cheap, independent films like
Fighters of the Saddle. A man of short stature, with a
weatherbeaten
face
in
the
Harry
Carey
tradition,
he
shows
little
real
star
quality
in
these
films
from
the
extreme ends
of
his
career.
Yet,
in
his
big Universal
serials and Western
specials
in
the
intervening
years,
he proved to be another major rival to Mix.
Jack
Hoxie
was
a
player
of
restricted
talent
and
variable
pictures,
and
his
huge
popularity
must
be
attributed to the fact that he made more good pictures
than bad ones and that when they were good, they were
very good. He had started out as Hart Hoxie, made an
interesting but not very actionful series of "B" Westerns
(off-beat
to say
the
least, one
of them even having
a
dream sequence with pixies!) and then joined Universal
in
1924.
Hoxie was
a
big,
amiable
oaf, whose
large
frame made him seem clumsy afoot and whose expres-
sion suggested that his mind was a complete blank ex-
cept when the director told him to pantomime a specific
emotion. But on a horse, he was something else again,
an expert rider and stunter. His
first film for Universal,
Don
Quickshot
of
the Rio
Grande,
fortunately
kept
him on
his horse most of the time, and provided him
with some elaborate stunts, leaps, transfers from gallop-
ing horse
to moving train. A tongue-in-cheek
frolic,
it
took nothing seriously, but
it moved from the first scene
to
the
last, and was
beautifully photographed
against
majestic exteriors.
Its opening was an elaborate dream
sequence lampooning the days of King Arthur's knights.
(If nothing else, the film seems to have impressed Ken
Maynard a great deal, since he obviously based his The
Grey Vulture of 1925 on
it, even to copying the dream-
knighthood opening.) But Hoxie needed constant speed,
anything to prevent his getting off his horse and acting.
When he was given a serious Western, as in Back Trail
(directed by Bill Hart's old crony, Cliff Smith, and with
a slow-moving,
sentimental
story
of
regeneration
that
would have been
better suited to Hart), he
fell down
badly. Since he was one of the biggest Western money-
makers in the twenties, obviously he made few Westerns
like Back Trail. Hoxie could neither read nor write, and
genially accepted some rather cruel
inside jokes about
those
failings
in
several
of
his
films. The
inability
to
read,
remember,
or
deliver
a
line defeated him when
sound came
in,
and,
unable
to handle even
the
tatty
dialogue of the grade-Z quickies like Valley of Gold, he
drifted out of the movies.
Hoot Gibson,
after
starring
in John Ford
features,
found
himself "promoted"
downstairs
into
a
series
of
highly
popular
two-reelers
for
Universal
in
the
early
twenties.
Western
two-reelers were
plentiful
then
and
full of action; Gibson's decision was to develop a slow,
bantering comedy style, with
little action
(to emphasize
this, he never wore
a
gun-belt, and
if he ever had
to
use
a
gun,
usually
borrowed one and
stuck
it
in
his
boot)
and
simple
story-lines.
Because
of
their
sheer
novelty,
and
Gibson's
ingratiating
style—plus
the
fact
that he was an ex-rodeo champ and could
deliver the
action goods when required—these shorts were extremely
popular. Gibson was soon returned to features, but
re-
tained his emphasis on comedy. His early features were

extremely good, slow-moving openings amply compen-
sated for by dynamic endings, as in The Phantom Bullet,
with its last-reel fight, chase, and a spectacular stunt of an
auto diving from a high
cliff into a lake. However, the
Gibson series deteriorated towards the end of the twen-
ties.
Action
content
got
even
less,
the comedy was
padded by bantering dialogue
titles; and the slim plots
grew
slimmer.
King
of
the Rodeo was
a
bland
bore
except
for
an
enjoyable
last-reel
sequence
of Gibson
chasing through the streets of Chicago on a motorcycle.
One of the most likeable Western stars of the twenties
was Ken Maynard, who came to the screen via a bit
in
a Fox Buck
Jones
Western,
attracted
notice
as
Paul
Revere
in Janice Meredith, made some cheap indepen-
dent
films which were
fast on action and long on
dis-
plays
of Maynard's
riding
skill,
and
finally
landed
a
contract for a
series of eighteen Westerns
at First Na-
tional. They placed
action and streamlined production
values before
all
else, and
in terms of excitement and
sheer size were some of the best program Westerns ever
made. Their plots may have been skimpy, but they had
the mountings of a Stagecoach—extensive, location shoot-
ing,
big
action
scenes, no
stinting
in
extras, horses or
wagon-power. When
the
script called for a mad stam-
pede
of
fifty covered wagons,
they
got them, and not
just a half-dozen carefully intercut with old stock shots.
Al Rogell, who also worked on the Fred Thomsons
at
FBO,
directed
the
best
of
them,
and
their
superior
camerawork utilized several camera trucks to their full-
est advantage, providing continuous speed and variety
of angle in all of the running inserts. Moreover, Maynard
himself was
at his physical peak:
slim, handsome, and
an
incredible
trick and stunt rider. Most of his riding
stunts, leaps and
falls were shot in closeup, precluding
the possibility of doubles. Maynard was a clumsy actor
with dialogue, often given to rather bizarre ad-libs, and
seldom
able
to achieve the subtlety of underplaying a
key
dramatic
or comic
line.
But
for
those few
silent
years at First National he was in his prime, and every-
ing a good Western star should be. The care that went
into
films
like Red Raiders more than paid
off
in an
unexpected way:
for years
First National were able to
build their talkie "B" Westerns
(first a series with John
Wayne and subsequently one with Dick Foran) around
the spectacular action from these Maynards, and when
they abandoned "B" Westerns in the late
thirties, they
continued
to
sell
this
footage
to Columbia and
other
companies.
Some
measure
of
the
remarkable
quality
of
these
films can be gathered from the fact that Red Raiders,

Almost
as elaborate
as the Maynards were the
his-
torical
Westerns
that Tim McCoy made
for MGM.
McCoy, a military man and an authority on Indian lore
and
history,
was
introduced
to
the
movies
via
The
Covered
Wagon.
His job had been
to
represent and
work with the many Indians employed in the film and
to accompany them
to Europe on
publicity work
for
the
film. Reputedly he also did some of the trick riding
in
the
film,
although
there
is precious
little
of
it, and
none
that couldn't have been performed by any com-
petent
wrangler. Paramount
later
put him
into
a key
supporting role
in one of
its Zane Grey Westerns, The
Thundering Herd, but didn't develop him as a Western
star. They hadn't retained a regular Western star on the
lot
since easing William
S. Hart out the year before,
and for their Zane Grey and other Westerns, they used
such contract
stars
as Neil Hamilton, Antonio Moreno
and
Jack
Holt,
and
later,
Gary
Cooper
and
Lane
Chandler. MGM, which made few "B"
pictures, and
never
at any other time in
its history sponsored a con-
tinuing series of Westerns, launched McCoy in a group
of actioners based on various aspects of American his-
tory, including events in the Far East and the campaign
against
the
Seminoles
in
Florida,
but
with
the main
emphasis on Western themes. The
films, though
pro-
duced on a big scale, were surprisingly short, some run-
ning
less than
an
hour.
Their purpose was manifold.
They
provided
second
features
for
Metro's own "A"
product in the limited but growing double-feature mar-
ket; they were useful training grounds for new directors;
and at times they were even used to discipline tempera-
mental stars whom the front office thought were getting
delusions of grandeur. For example, after playing leads
in important major releases, Joan Crawford was taken
down a peg or two by being installed as Tim McCoy's
leading lady
in Winners of the Wilderness and Law of
the Range in 1927 and 1928 respectively. The directors
on the McCoy films included William Nigh, the Russian
Tourjansky, and W.
S. Van Dyke, who, with his out-
standing cameraman Clyde de Vinna, more than proved
his mettle by jumping from the McCoy westerns to the
classic White Shadows
in the South Seas.
Incidentally,
Van Dyke's
assistant
at the time was Lesley Selander,
who, in the thirties and forties, became one of the ablest
directors
of
the
Buck
Jones
and Hopalong
Cassidy
Westerns before moving on to bigger-scale horse operas.

McCoy was
a good
actor and a striking figure of a
man who wore both cowboy costumes and military uni-
forms with
flair. While he was husky and a fine
rider,
he was always believed that story mattered more than
action,
and
in
any
case he exuded
a
natural
dignity
which somehow made
it seem inappropriate for him to
engage
in
fist
fights
or
flying
leaps
into
the
saddle.
Except
for
a
brief
early
period
in
Columbia
sound
Westerns, McCoy's
films
usually contained
less
action
than
those
of any
other major Western
star, and he
also used doubles far more liberally. Despite their often
quite spectacular action climaxes and their brief running
times, the McCoy Westerns at MOM were not markedly
popular with the youngsters
(historical data was often
documented at some length, and the romantic elements
were more dominant than usual) nor were they speci-
fically
tailored
to
the
juvenile market. As
a
footnote
without further comment, the MGM product of the late
twenties displayed a rather surprising penchant for male
nudity
in
situations
of bondage
and
torture—ranging
from the trussed-up galley slave in Ben Hur to a writh-
ing victim burning
at the stake
in
at
least one of the
McCoys. Admittedly, such scenes were discreetly photo-
graphed from
the
rear,
but whatever segment
of
the
moviegoing public they were aimed
at,
it was definitely
not
the kiddie
trade!
One of the most durable of all the new Western stars
of the twenties was Buck Jones, who starred for Fox in
a series secondary in importance to their Mix films, but
hardly secondary in the care with which they were made.
Jones struck
a neat balance between the conviction of
Hart and the excitement of Mix; his films had sensible
stories and good
if not flamboyant action, and one addi-
tional ingredient—an unstressed but definite element of
folksy Will Rogers humor. This may well have been a
quality that Jones devised himself; gestures and
bits of
comedy
business
that
he used
in
such
early
films
as
Just Pals (directed by John Ford
in 1920) he retained
and developed through the years. When he was
solely
in charge
of
his own productions
(in the
thirties)
he
often overdid these comedy elements (primarily because
he was a serious actor, one of the best among Western
stars, and comic by-play from him too frequently seemed
forced when
it should have been totally relaxed). Over
his more
than
twenty
years
of stardom,
Jones main-
tained a remarkably high standard, and he was also the
only silent Western star who continued over into talkies
without once having to descend to independent quickies.
Another
star
who,
like
Jones,
retained
a
certain
allegiance
to
the
Hart
image was
Harry
Carey.
His
always mature
features, and
the
fact
that
he was
an
actor
before
he was
an
athlete,
probably
made

allegiance
unavoidable.
In
his
plots,
too,
he followed
the Hart tradition:
in The Prairie Pirate he turned good
outlaw
to track down the murderer of his
sister, while
Satan Town was a vigorous reworking of one of Hart's
best pictures. Hell's Hinges. None of the Westerns that
Carey made after he left John Ford were truly outstand-
ing, but they were enjoyable, intelligent, and well above
average programmers. He too continued into the talkies,
first as a star of serials and independent Westerns, and
then as a character player.
Of the
lesser silent Western
stars, Leo Maloney and
Yakima Canutt were among the more interesting. Leo
was a genial star in the Jack Hoxie manner, who formed
a
writing-producing-directing
partnership
with
Ford
Beebe,
one
of
the
best
directors
of
slick
talkie "B"
Westerns and serials. They made some good two-reelers
and
a few
features
together,
and Maloney
enjoyed
a
large following which could have
built him into a top-
ranking
star had he knuckled down
to
it. But he was
never too serious about making movies, would go off on
spur-of-the-moment sprees during shooting, and his films

often had
to be constructed so
that the
plots allowed
him to be absent a great deal of the time. With an off-
screen hero, their action content was never pronounced,
and
hurried
script
sessions
often
resulted
in
the
des-
perate pilfering of plots and situations from other stars'
movies.
(The
entire
climax
of
Hart's
Square
Deal
Sanderson—a
rather
unusual
and
easily
recognizable
sequence—was borrowed in
this way!)
Canutt
likewise
never
realized
his
full
potential
in
silent Westerns, though for different reasons. Probably
the finest all-around stuntman the screen has ever had,
he
tried to make Westerns
in the Mix manner, but un-
fortunately
was
limited
to
the
cheaper
independent
companies like Goodwill Productions, who could never
provide the budgets necessary for sustained and elabo-
rate
stunt
sequences.
Canutt's Westerns on
the whole
were
slow and
poorly
directed,
but enlivened by
fre-
quent
leaps,
falls, and
other horse
stunt work. Occa-
sionally
the
climactic
chases would
be
prolonged
far
beyond
their worth
in order to provide a solid
reel of
Canutt
stunting,
but
it was
obvious,
repetitious
stuff.
Canutt's only really worthwhile silent Western was The

Devil Horse,
a
large-scale programmer with
excellent
mass
action
as
well
as
individual
stunting, and some
superior photography
of
excellent
locations.
(George
Stevens was the film's second cameraman.) Canutt came
into
his own
in the
talkie period,
first
as a stuntman/
villain
in
scores
of Westerns
for Monogram and Re-
public, and
later
as
a director and organizer
of mass
action sequences, reaching far out of the Western
field
to such
films
as Ben Hur.
FBO, which-after
the Ken Maynards
at
First Na-
tional—made the best Westerns of the late twenties, was
an independent company formed by Joseph P. Kennedy
and
dedicated
almost
solely
to
the making
of expert
action
pictures.
These
included
the
stunt
thrillers
of
Richard Talmadge,
but Westerns predominated. Tom
Mix was with them
briefly,
after he had
left Fox, and
Fred Thomson had
left FBO to go to Paramount. Their
other Western stars: Bob Custer (enjoying a brief popu-
larity not duplicated
in the sound period), Tom Tyler
(teamed with a diminutive Frankie Darro), Buzz Barton,
the boy stunt
rider, and Bob Steele.
Slick, well-photo-
graphed,
full of action, each series with
its own distinc-
tive
style, the FBO Westerns provided the quality that
Republic was to provide in the thirties and early forties.

"voice over" narration, edited down to five-minute seg-

still managed
to show through.
Unfortunately,
all too few of the independent West-
erns
of the
twenties matched
the
quality
of the FBO
work. The market for double-bills was growing. West-
erns were popular, and they were
still the cheapest kind
of
film
to make. And
since they didn't have
to worry
about
even
semi-literate
dialogue,
clean
photography
and fast-action were
all
that they had to worry about.
With
such
simple
aims,
it
is amazing how
often
they
failed
to
deliver
the
goods.
Indian
"uprisings" would
consist of a few scraggly extras emerging from two or
three tepees;
fights were badly staged; the simple plots
were prolonged through
the excessive use
of dialogue
titles. Or
if a producer like Anthony
J. Xydias tried to
offer a
little more in terms of plot and production trim-
mings, then
the budget wouldn't allow
for action
too.
Xydias made a series of "historical epics" for his Sunset
Productions with relatively non-formula plots, casts that
included such respectable names
as Bryant Washburn

and Bob Steele, capable directors like Robert N. Brad-
bury (Bob Steele's father), and lengths that, by virtue
of being
a
reel
or two over the average "B" product,
suggested that maybe these films were in fact "outdoor
epics" and not just "Westerns." While they were pleasant
enough and certainly not the mental and physical waste-
lands
offered by
Al Hoxie
in The Ace of Clubs and
Dick Hatton
in Pioneer Days, they were
still
basically
"cheaters."
After
all,
it
is
a
little
disconcerting
to
be
lured into a theatre to see With Sitting Bull at the Spirit
Lake Massacre only to find in reel six that the slaughter
has taken place off-screen!
With so many top-quality Westerns on the market,
it
is hard
to understand how the cheaters could survive.
Why should anyone book a non-action Western with a
nonentity as star when for a few dollars more he could
get a crowd-pleasing Tom Tyler—or for a slightly higher
price, play a Tom Mix that would undoubtedly outgross
John Barrymore's When a Man Loves? The answer, of
course,
is that the cheaters didn't really survive for long.
They got only nominal bookings, but their costs were so
low that they needed relatively few bookings to show a
profit.

were voluble in their dislike for a certain Western star
would give that producer and that star the cold shoulder
when
the
next booking season came around. By then,
another fly-by-night outfit would have appeared on the
horizon, and
it too would be given a chance for a season
of unimportant
one-day, bottom
of
the
bill
bookings.
The producers came and went, the lesser stars, devoid
of
acting
or
athletic
ability,
often
not even possessed
of
personality
or
a
pleasant
face,
enjoyed
their
brief
moment
of
stardom,
and
vanished. The
independent
silent
field contained more writers who couldn't write,
actors who couldn't
act, comedians who couldn't raise
a laugh, and Western stars without get-up-and-go than
has ever before or since been concentrated in any part
of the movie or television industry. Indeed,
it
is hard to
think of any
industry,
let alone
art,
in which so much
mediocrity was carried along,
if only temporarily, by the
momentum of quality of the
rest of that industry.
But
in the late twenties the movies had far more to
worry about than the malingerers and cheaters in their
midst. 1925 had seemed like a bad year, with attendance
falling off due to the competition of "free" home enter-
tainment—radio. A
rush
of good
pictures had
licked
that
crisis. The sudden popularity of German pictures,

1928)

Lane
The Wind (MGM, 1928),

and the birth of the "art-house" idea, overnight made
it
fashionable for Hollywood to import German directors
and
stars and
for Hollywood film-makers
to
inject
as
much German "technique" into their films
as possible.
Unexpectedly, the Western managed to absorb some of
this technique rather effectively. A humble Jack Perrin
Western for Universal, Wild Blood, was directed by that
old
Western and
serial
maestro Henry MacRae.
Yet
visually
it was right out of Warning Shadows, with much
moving camera work, symbolism, trick effects, and even
a wild hallucination sequence for the heroine,
all in the
midst of an ultra-traditional action story.
Even more notable was White Gold, one of the for-
gotten classics of the silents,
all the more remarkable in
that
it was
directed by
William
K.
Howard,
a man
always
notable
for
pace
and
dazzling
photographic
technique,
but
a
specialist
in
action
and melodrama
rather than psychology. (He had directed some of the
best Zane Grey Westerns
for Paramount.) Yet White
Gold was
a
slow-moving,
deliberately
claustrophobic
story with only two sets, five characters, and no physical
action
at
all.
It
dealt
in such
intangibles
as jealousy,
envy and frustration, and handed the audience
at least
two big shocks. One was the
killing
off of the "hero"
(George Bancroft) quite casually and unexpectedly; the
other was a deliberately ambiguous climax in which the
audience had to make up
its own mind as to what had
happened and what was going to happen. Audiences in
those pre-Godard and Resnais days, were not used to
being forced to involve themselves emotionally in films.
White Gold was a big critical success, being compared
favorably with such German films as The Last Laugh,
and while not a bonanza at the box office,
it must have
been
so economical
to make
that no
great
loss could
have
been
incurred.
White Gold
tended
to be
over-
looked and forgotten when, a year later
( 1928), MGM
made a very
similar
film
in The Wind.
Certainly The
Wind
is
a
better
film;
subtler,
more
cinematically
directed by the Swedish Victor Seastrom, graced by a
brilliant and
vibrant
performance
from
Lillian
Gish.
But White Gold
(its title refers to wool, the story taking
place on a sheep ranch) came
first, and may well have
been
the
inspiration
for the making of The
Wind.
In
any event,
it was the most notable psychological Western
until the arrival of The Ox-Bow Incident and The Gun-
fighter two decades
later.
By
the end
of the
twenties,
the Western was
at
its
lowest ebb since the days immediately prior to William

S. Hart. The epic had
all but vanished from the screen
and the movies were going through a curious period in
which the big Northern action story (The
Trail of 98,
The
Michigan
Kid,
Tide
of Empire) was
enjoying
a
huge vogue, while the Western was being relegated more
and more to a less important budgetary area. The arrival
of
talkies
brought
with
it
both
technical
problems
(especially where location shooting was concerned) and
the
commercial
need
to
exploit
dialogue
for
its own
sake. A further
if
less expected handicap to the West-
ern's survival was Lindbergh's epochal
flight across the
Atlantic. Overnight the nation, and especially the youth
of
the
nation,
became
aviation-conscious.

THE COMING OF SOUND
It would seem that the Western, telling its story in terms
of action rather than
dialogue, should have been
rela-
tively unconcerned
about
the mechanical problems
of
sound. The mystery film and the sophisticated comedy
were forced to tell their stories via dialogue, and in order
not to seem impossibly
stagey and
static they needed
camera movement and as much of the film grammar of
the
silents
as
could be
salvaged. For
the most
part,
they didn't get
it. Because of many actual and alleged
problems,
including most
specifically
the
recording
of
the camera's own operational noise, the cameras became
rooted to the ground and housed in small "sweat boxes."
For
a
year
or
two,
the cinema duplicated
the
stage;
dialogue was
king, and
filmic
style was thrown out of
the window. Of course, the good directors—the Vidors
and the MamouJians and the Fords—insisted on main-
taining a fluid camera and on trying for dramatic weld-
ings of sound and image. Enough good and thoroughly
cinematic films were
still made in the years 1929-31 to
confound
the
pat claims by
"historians"
that the
film
came to a dead halt
in these years and had to learn to
be an
art
all over again.
But achieving this artistry and combatting the claims
of cameramen and efficiency experts that such-and-such
just couldn't be done meant time, sweat and mechanical
know-how. In the first year or two of sound, the Western
didn't
seem
important enough
to
justify
this
kind
of
effort. Like the big elaborate swashbuckler,
it was con-
108

sidered a dead relic of the silents and of no major com-
mercial value. MGM scrapped
its elaborate Tim McCoy
series
entirely. FBO, undergoing corporate and opera-
tional changes that turned
it
first into RKO-Pathe and
later RKO Radio, likewise abandoned its program West-
erns, and with them Tom Mix. (They would resume in
a year or two with a Tom Keene series, and thereafter
retain
a
regular
"B"
Western
series
until
the
early
fifties). Warner Brothers, also
in doubt about the com-
mercial value of Westerns, jettisoned their "B" Westerns
too. Of all the major companies, only Universal, geared
to
"little" pictures and programmers far more than the
other
big companies,
carried
its
silent cowboy heroes.

Gibson's slow-paced format and
his
stress on comedy
and plot rather than action made him an early casualty
of sound Westerns
as a major
star. He was soon, and
for the
rest of his career, working only for the smaller
independent companies.
Universal,
recognizing
that
it
had
to
oflfer
talkie Westerns
or
lose
out on the new
market, but also wanting to service the slow-dying rem-
nants of the silent market, and reluctant to spend extra
money on what
it felt was
still an unimportant product,
came up with a kind of compromise. Once or twice in
each film, the plot would stop dead for a long dialogue-
expository sequence which would satisfy those demand-
ing
talkies,
and which could
easily be shortened and
titled
for the
silent version.
(In Lucky Larkin
it took
place in a long, box-like saloon.) Their ten-episode Tim
McCoy
serial,
full
of
elaborate moving camerawork,
likewise
contained
one
extremely
static
dialogue
se-
quence in each episode, while the last chapter, as a kind
of bonus, disposed of
its wrap-up action almost imme-
diately and devoted the bulk of
its footage
to a long
conversation between the hero and the heroine, in which
he describes his pal's apparent death—only to have the
pal (Edmund Cobb)
turn up
alive and kicking as an
excuse
for
more
100%
all-talking
explanations
and
rejoicings!
Fortunately
the
stalemate
of
the
hybrid
part-talkie
Western
solved
itself
very
quickly.
In
1929,
Raoul
Walsh made In Old Arizona for Fox, a Cisco Kid West-
ern
starring Warner Baxter
that was
hardly
a
super-
Western but was certainly one of style and importance.

perhaps just what the Western needed.

At
this
time
the
studios were
again experimenting
with
the
oft-tried and abandoned
idea
of wide-screen
projection—a curiously
ambitious and
ill-timed experi-
ment, since the more practical and commercial experi-
ments with sound and color
still had a great many bugs
to be ironed
out. Obviously the Western was an ideal
testing
ground
for
the
Giant-Screen
movie,
and
two
major ones were produced
in 70mm, although
after a
few showcase runs they were generally distributed in the
standard 35mm gauge. The
first of these was The Big
Trail, again directed by Raoul Walsh for Fox, and giving
John Wayne his
first starring role. In terms of size and
action,
it
is
still one of the most impressive of all super-
Westerns.
(Its German
version, made
simultaneously,
was
still playing commercially in German theatres in the
post-World War
II
period,
and
its
big
Indian
battle
scenes were used
continually through
the
thirties and
forties
to pad out cheaper
pictures.) The
detailing of
the assembly of the covered wagon train,
its departure
from the midwest, the agonizingly real scenes showing
the train fording a swollen river in a storm, and the dis-
mantling
of
the wagons
so
that they could be hauled
over mountains carried far more drama and conviction
than anything
in The Covered Wagon. And

tional Indian battle—hordes of savages surrounding the
huge circle of wagons—is
still the most spectacular such
sequence ever filmed. A buffalo hunt sequence also car-
ried complete conviction, with genuine riding closeups
of
the
players
replacing the phony mock-ups
of The
Covered Wagon. All of this, slammed over with Walsh's
customary virility and pace, and composed with its wide-
screen effect very much in mind, made The Big Trail an
outstanding early sound
epic. So authentic did
it look
that just a few years ago a Kansas historical foundation,
coming across some glass negatives of the wagon train
assembly and departure sequence, understandably waxed
loud and long in their excitemetit at having found rare
original photographic coverage of the actual event! But,
as with The Iron Horse, the authenticity of detail and
the sweep of history was somewhat let down by a stand-
ardized "B"
plot, hinging around the hero's search for
the murderer of
his brother. Moreover, John Wayne's
inexperience was
thrown
into
sharp
relief by
all the
veteran
players
in the
cast, and
El
Brendel's comedy
was another cliche intrusion.
King Vidor's Billy the Kid, made in 1930 for MGM,
was a better picture
in many ways, but a slower one,
and certainly a smaller-scale and
less commercial one.
Photographed
largely
on
the
actual
locations
of
the
famous
Lincoln
County
wars,
it
was
again
carefully
composed with
the
giant
screen
in mind. There were
superb panoramic shots and intricate use of terrain and
natural
lighting—as
in
a sequence where
Billy
is
be-
sieged in a cave among colorful rock formations, while
Sheriff
Pat
Garrett,
below,
entices him
out
of hiding
(by frying more bacon!). In fact, the whole film was so
carefully composed for wide screen projection that, en-
countering the same problems as the early CinemaScope
films,
it
avoided
closeups
entirely. When
seen on
a
normal
sized
screen,
this
concentration on long shots
and
two-shots
gave
it
a
stilted
and
almost
primitive
quality.
It was already a rather old-fashioned film; like
most early talkies,
it had no musical score and one was
sorely needed,
if only for punctuation in the transitional
scenes.
In
lieu of music,
silent-style
subtitles were em-
ployed to bridge dramatic gaps and time lapses. More-
over,
director
Vidor
deliberately
tried
to
avoid
the
traditional MGM
gloss;
the photography
is good,
but
always
naturalistic,
the characters drab
in
their
dress,
the buildings ramshackle, the streets dusty.
It
is a long
film
and
a
slow
one,
with
its main
action
sequence
placed in the middle of the film, so that
it doesn't even
build
to
a climax
as most Westerns
do.
Its
script
is
frankly
untidy,
yet the
film
is
quite
certainly the best
111

and
most
convincing
of
all
the
Billy
the Kid
sagas.
Johnny Mack Brown,
later
to be
a leading
star
of
"B"
Westerns,
but
prior
to
this known
mainly
as
a
clothes-horse society leading man to Greta Garbo, Mary
Pickford and Joan
Crawford,
brought
athletic
ability
and a pleasing personality to the role of Billy, although
it was Wallace Beery as Pat Garrett who gave the best
performance, a surprisingly underplayed piece of actmg
for such an extrovert player and an equally surprisingly
underwritten
role.
In Billy the Kid Vidor created the
first of the only two sound Westerns
(the second was
Law and Order in 1932) to really recapture the rugged
austerity
of the sUent
Bill Hart Westerns.
Possibly his
own creative efforts may have been helped along by the
difficulties inherent in shooting such a talkative Western
away from the easier conditions of the studio, difficulties
that
may
have
occasionally
given
the
film
an
even
rougher-hewn
quality
than
Vidor
really
wanted. No
doubt much of the
film's effortless
authenticity can be
attributed to the fact that Hart worked on the film as an
advisor, coached Brown, and even lent him Billy's own
six-guns. Hart must
surely have been dismayed, how-
ever, by the tacked-on happy ending in which the benign
Garrett instead of shooting Billy down sends him over
the border to safety and a peaceful life with his sweet-
heart. A romanticized (but closer to the facts) ending,
in which Billy
is shot by Garrett and dies in his arms,
was filmed, but retained only for the European versions.

Since
Billy's
various
killings
are shown
as being
de-
cidedly cold-blooded, even
if somewhat justified by cir-
cumstance, the sudden happy-ever-after ending is a little
hard to accept.
Although the wide-screen was well-utilized in The Big
Trail and
Billy the Kid, enthusiasm for
it did not last.
Before
its quick demise,
it was already being used only
as a gimmick to prop up weak pictures, as in The Lash,
a
rather pedestrian Western
starring Richard
Barthel-
mess,
in which only
a
large-scale
catde stampede
se-
quence could in any way be said to justify the big screen.
Oddly enough, the two-color Technicolor process, then
enjoying a big vogue, and the many competitive lesser
color processes, were not harnessed
at this time to the
big-scale Western. Color was reserved largely for musi-
cals and only saw service in the great outdoors when the
film
in question was, like Rio Rita, essentially a musical
that happened
also
to have
a Western
locale. By
the
time that Cimarron,
the
third big Western epic of the
sound
era,
arrived
in
1931, the big screen was
all but
forgotten.
Cimarron, commercially
the
"safest"
of the
three
in
that
it was
based on
a
best-selling novel by
Edna Ferber, was probably the best film of
its versatile
but not very imaginative director, Wesley Ruggles. Like
his later Arizona,
it tended to be bogged down in char-
acter
studies and had the
structural flaw
of presenting
its
highlight—the massive Cherokee
Strip landrush
se-
quence—at the beginning of the picture. Thereafter,
its

typically sprawling Ferber canvas depicted
the growth
and development of Oklahoma as an oil-rich state over
the years more in terms of emotion and heartbreak than
in
visual
excitement.
Nevertheless,
the
film was
well
served by Richard Dix and
Irene Dunne
in the
leads,
many good
supporting performances, and by opening
reels so strong (not only
in physical
action, but in the
convincing depiction of the construction of the frontier
town)
that
their
impetus
carried
the
film through
its
later, more pedestrian segments.
A
big commercial
success, Cimarron prompted not
so much a series of further Western epics, as a number
of outright imitations using the same Cavalcade formula
of a young couple coming West, raising a family, par-
ticipating
in
the
opening
up
of new
territories,
and
bringing them through financial crises and political tur-
moil to the early
thirties, when the spoiled, easy-living
activities of their children cried out for a return to the
pioneer spirit to
lift America from the doldrums of the
Depression.

group, stronger on emotional qualities than on Western
action, and with some of
its biggest scenes lifted bodily
from The Covered Wagon. Rather better and preceding
it by a year, was
1932's The Conquerors, an obvious
attempt (but a good one) by RKO Radio to repeat the
success of Cimarron, even to starring Richard Dix again.
Directed by William Wellman,
it contained some unusu-
ally
powerful
sequences,
including
the
death
of
the
family's son
in an accident as the crowds are lined up
to welcome the
first locomotive and a grim mass lynch-
ing episode so starkly designed and
lit, and so casually
underplayed,
that
it quite outshines the more carefully
and lengthily constructed lynching scenes
in Wellman's
much later The Ox-Bow Incident.
1932 also saw the production of another of the sound
era's most overlooked Westerns (and one of
its finest)
Law and Order. Although based on a novel by W. R.
Burnett, using fictional names, it was clearly built around
the lives of Wyatt Earp (played by Walter Huston) and

Doc Holiday (Harry Carey).
Its director was Edward
Cahn, who had just completed an apprenticeship under
arty director Paul Fejos and was anxious to show what
he could do. His
directorial debut was also his
artistic
zenith; he never again made a film one-tenth as good.
Law and Order, partially scripted by John Huston, was
a slow-paced, gritty Western that matched Billy the Kid
in
recapturing
the
old
Ince-Hart
flavor. There was
a
great deal of tension, but little traditional physical action
throughout the bulk of the film, which literally exploded
in
its
last
reel
into the
finest reconstruction yet of the
famous
gun
duel
at
the O.K.
Corral.
Influenced no
doubt by
Fejos, who had
always been
a
specialist
in
elaborately fluid use of the moving camera, Cahn made
his
camera
a
participant
in
the
short,
sharp,
tightly
edited
battle,
darting from
side
to
side
in
subjective
viewpoints, catching the sudden terror of a frightened
horse.
Perhaps the real beauty of Law and Order lay in
its
formal yet unforced style. At the end, the Marshal, sole
survivor of the battle, rides out of town weary of killing,
yet knowing
that more such towns await him and
his
guns; the compositions, stressing his feeling of isolation;
the mournful tolling of the church bell; the citizens glad
to have
the
job done
but
unwilling
to have
involved
themselves
in
it;
all
of
this achieved
a sense of Greek
tragedy
without
consciously
striving
for
it
(as
High
Noon was
to do). Law and Order was remade
twice,
once
as
a
formula Johnny Mack Brown "B"
in
the
forties,
and
again
as
a
Technicolor
action-filled
and
somewhat brutal Ronald Reagon "A" in the fifties. The
original film had no women in
it at all, other than for the
brief appearance of a dowdy saloon trollop. The second
remake had two leading ladies, and a great deal of sex
and bedroom suggestiveness. One of the finest and most
poignant
episodes
in
the
original was
a touching and
sensitive sequence
in which the lawmen
are forced
to
hang
a simple-minded,
good-hearted farm
lad
(Andy
Devine)
who had become
an
accidental
murderer,
a
sub-plot that effectively stressed that problems of moral-
ity and
conscience could
confuse and
deter
the
early
lawmen
just
as much
as a confrontation with outnum-
bering enemy
forces.
In
the
remake,
this
genuinely
classic sequence was distorted into a standard lynching
by the
villains.
Perhaps the very starkness of Westerns like Law and
Order mitigated against their success. After afl, by 1932,
the movies had
really solved
all of the technical prob-
lems connected with sound and were entering into their
greatest
period
of
lush,
smooth,
glossy
glamor.

THE^^^'BOOM
The new medium of talkies proved a great leveller, and
the "B" Westerns of independents and major companies
alike
started
out on
a
relatively even
basis. Westerns
could
still be made cheaply, and the smaller companies
as yet had no need to practice the economies that in due
time
would
help
to
distinguish
them
from
their
big
studio counterparts. The independents could
still afford
enough
extras
so
that
crowd
scenes
didn't
appear
skimpy, and a camera car was not yet a luxury, so even
the cheaper Westerns indulged
in that ultimate finesse,
the running
insert or
riding closeup.
Shooting two or
three Westerns at the same time justified the expense of
going to worthwhile locations. The one big deficiency of
124
all early "B" Westerns was the lack of a musical score,
and exciting agitato themes were an absolute
essential
to
the
genre,
often
literally making the
difference be-
tween a gripping Western and a dull one. In the early
sound period, however, musical scores were suspect and
considered totally artificial in the new "realistic" medium
of
talkies.
Original scores for movies came into vogue
around
1932, and were an additional and considerable
expense. The economy-minded independents were reluc-
tant to pay for what seemed a luxury, and this, probably
more than any
other single
factor,
is what eventually
gave
"class"
to
the major
studio "B"
Westerns, and
denied
it to many of the independents.

But
prior to
this
division, both brands of Westerns
shared
the same
physical
"look" and
the same draw-
backs. Action sequences
in the early talkies were often
shot
silent, and even filmed
at the old
silent speed,
to
give them a frenzied and speeded-up look when intercut
with the dialogue and other sound sequences. While the
major studios had their own standing sets and Western
streets, the independents, often with no studios of their
own, had to rent their ranch and Western street locales,
or go
to
locations where
relics
of
the
real
thing
still
existed.
These
small,
often
shabby
concentrations
of
wooden
shacks
invariably looked
far more convincing
than the big studio reconstructions and injected a sur-
prising amount
of unsought-for
realism.
In one
other
way, too, the independents often had a striking if unwit-
ting advantage
over
the
majors. Anxious
to
turn
out
program Westerns
that looked expensive but were
still
cheap
to make,
the
bigger companies
frequently
built
entire
series around the spectacular highlights of their
silent Westerns. Thus John Wayne's
series
at Warner
Brothers was
carefully
patterned
after
the
silent Ken
Maynard
series,
using both
basic
plots and
extensive
chunks of action material. A few new chase scenes and
a fight or two added to the old and very big-scale high-
lights made them fast-paced and
actionful indeed, but
story values
suffered badly, and there were many un-
avoidable restrictions. For matching-up purposes, Wayne
had
to
dress
like
Maynard,
wear
the same
kind
of
clothes,
ride the same kind of horse, surround himself
with
the same kind of
sidekicks. Either the old plots
were followed scrupulously, which meant a lot of padded
and extraneous dialogue sequences, or a new plot was
written, and then
absurd
twists
or
quick
explanatory
lines of dialogue had to be introduced in order to pave
the way for the utilization of stock sequences. Big films
and small, right through the
fifties, continued to follow
this practice of making new
films out of old. Not one
of them ever had any real merit on
its own, no matter
how actionful
it may have been, or how fascinating to
the more studious viewer identifying
all the clips used.
The independents, on
the other hand, with no such
vast reserve of stock material to call on, had to concen-
trate on
story
as much
as
action, and because of
this,
many of the early independent Westerns had scripts far
superior to those of the bigger studios. An early World-
Wide Western such as Riders of the Desert, a Bob Steele
vehicle, not
only boasted
superior photography, good
locations, and some
excellent
action
sequences,
but
a
really strong plot-line as well. Superior scripts continued
to be a hallmark of many of the independent Westerns
of the early thirties. Law of the 45's, a Big Boy Williams

sheriflf's
post, and
un-
knowingly executes his own outlaw father on the gallows!
Few independent
series
of the
mid-thirties matched
the
(relative)
quality of a good Kermit Maynard series
produced by Ambassador Films. Simple but adequate
in their plots, they did
at least offer a certain polish
in
their
utilization
of
effective
musical
scores,
camera
trucks
for running
inserts,
elaborate
opticals and
dis-
solves, and
other
technical
niceties usually denied
the
cheaper "B." Moreover they were generously supplied
with action and had a big asset in star Kermit Maynard,
who was possessed of a breezy, naturalistic acting style
and was an accomplished stuntman and
rider. He was
actually a far better actor than brother Ken, but never
had the opportunity
to match
his popularity.
But
the

independents grew
fewer
as
the

films were

there was
little
incentive
to turn out
a better product.
The Westerns
that aimed
at
a modicum of quality via
either strong stories or an above-average star (Conway
Tearle,
a
dramatic
actor,
was
starred
in one
series)
spent
their money
in
that direction and had
little
left
over for location work or action. Or
if action was the
desired
quality,
as
in
the cheapies from Resolute and
similar companies,
then
a maximum
of poorly staged
fights and chases, constant use of stock footage, and
a
total
lack
of
finesse were
the modus
operandi. These
really cheap
independent Westerns were often
shot
in
two or three days
for a
total negative cost well below
$10,000, and every dollar that wasn't spent showed up
on the screen. Retakes were unheard of, and
if an actor
fluffed a line or leaped into the saddle and missed, then
the flawed scenes were left in. Frequently one could pick
up the voice of the director giving instructions, and
a
quickie
with
Buffalo
Bill,
Jr.,
entitled Lightning
Bill
offered a number of unique illustrations of this kind of
slaplash
production. The camera frequently picked up
the ill-concealed mattresses onto which riders made their
falls as they were shot from the saddle, and in one gun
battle sequence, a production assistant, thinking that the
scene
is
over, ambles

cover again—and
then, some seconds
later,
convinced
that by now the take must be over, furtively creeps forth
again, only to retreat for a second time. However, per-
haps the crowning indignity of this particular film was
that even
its main
title was misspelled!
The
calibre
of the independent Westerns picked up
spectacularly, however, with the formation of two "in-
between"
companies, Monogram
and
Republic. Both
aimed
at
a
"bread-and-butter" product,
but they had
their own
studios,
contract
writers and
directors, and
used good veteran stars as well as developing new ones.
Republic was
at
its peak
in
the
late
thirties and very
early forties. Monogram, while never reaching Republic
standards,
did
turn
out many
excellent
Westerns. At
their
peak,
both
companies made
some
of
the
best
Westerns on the market, and at
all tjmes they were well
above the quickie
level and able to compete favorably
with the current product from the major companies.
As
the
thirties
began,
the
best "B" Westerns were
being turned out,
rather surprisingly, by the
still quite
young company, Columbia. They had two of the best
Western stars of all, Buck Jones and Tim McCoy, mak-
ing simultaneous series, and (an unexpected bonus years
later, when the films hit television) a young John Wayne
had supporting roles
in several of them. Both McCoy
and Jones took their Westerns seriously, and gave them
such care and variety of plot that none of them had an
assembly-line
look
to
them.
Both
alternated
purely
action Westerns with those in which plot took the domi-
nant role. McCoy's The Riding Tornado was all-action
stuff that lived up to
its
title, but conversely The End
of the
Trail was a slow, methodical, obviously sincere
and sometimes genuinely poetic study of the white man's
betrayal
of
the
Indian.
There was
no
villain
in
the
normal sense and a rather surprising element of tragedy;
McCoy's young son
is killed by the cavalry, and in the
original version, McCoy himself died at the end, though
a last-minute happy ending was hastily tacked on before
the
film went into release. Many of the other McCoys
were
essentially
detective
stories,
the Western
settings
almost
incidental.
Both
series
benefitted from
solid production values
and good
directors. Some of the
films, such
as Jones'
White Eagle,
directed by Lambert Hillyer, turned out
so well that in later years they would almost certainly
have been separated from their series format and sold
as specials. After a few seasons, however, the inevitable
lessening of enthusiasm—and budget-cutting—that affects
every series Western began to set in. Both the Jones and
the McCoy series began to lose lustre. Jones actually left
Columbia to go to Universal, then returned to Columbia
later with a "modern" series that presented him in such

off-beat
roles
as a lettuce farmer and a Western
star's
double.
However,
at their peak, both McCoy and Jones pro-
duced for Columbia some of the industry's highest qual-
ity "B" Westerns, films that could be enjoyed by adults
as much as by youngsters. Indeed, many of them were
clearly intended for adults. Jones' The Avenger, in which
he
played
Mexican
bandit
Juaquin
Murietta,
was
a
rather
grim
little
film played
for
tension
rather than
action, and with superb lighting and photography from
Charles Stumar,
a cameraman not normally associated
with Westerns.
Taking
over
as
Columbia's new Western
star was
Charles Starrett. He was handsome and athletic, but his
white
Stetson and impeccable
dress
immediately
pro-
claimed him one
of
the new
breed
of
"streamlined"
Western
stars,
a
far cry from the veterans he was
re-
placing. But the initial Starrett Westerns were good and
they
got even
better,
reaching
their peak
in
the
late
thirties with
films like Two Gun Law. Thereafter, they
rapidly became formularized:
the same casts in picture
after picture, the same basic plots, a plethora of action,
a
dearth
of
originality.
Nevertheless,
they
retained
a
certain level of quality, declining only in the final years
of the "B" Western
in the early
fifties.
Starrett stayed

their No.

star for almost
two decades. The studio also produced a Ken Maynard
series,
and
tried
out two
straight
(if
indistinguished)
dramatic actors in short-lived series
in the late thirties:
Jack Luden and Bob Allen.
Far more
successful
was Gordon
Elliott, who had
been
in movies
since
the
mid-twenties, and who was
suddenly introduced as a new Western star in the late
thirties.
Elliott
played
in
a
sober,
restrained
fashion,
clearly modelling
his
characterization
after William
S.
Hart. He had known Hart and
at one time was under
consideration to portray him in a movie biography. The
initial
Elliotts
at Columbia were excellent "B"s, espe-
Fox, having lost Buck Jones and Tom Mix at the end
of
the
silents,
turned
over
its
Westerns
to
George
O'Brien, now no longer as big a star as he had been in
the twenties, but with a following in the action market.
O'Brien was
goodlooking and
muscular,
an ex-Naval
boxing champ who could more than take care of himself
in
the
fights,
and
an
ex-stuntman who
rarely
used
doubles himself. Moreover, he had an excellent sense of
humor,
and
was
particularly good
in
"taming-of-the-
shrew" variations where he was called upon to bait the
heroine.
His
initial
films
for Fox were important—not
major Westerns admittedly, but well above the "B" or
programmer
level. They had good
scripts, many based

1932), with Paul Hurst, Tom Mix, Wallis Clark, Mickey Rooney, and Noel Francis
cially In Early Arizona, another unofficial adaptation of
the Wyatt Earp story. Elliott also starred in three West-
ern
serials which were
superior
in production
values,
but almost devoid of story values, degenerating into a
repetitious series of unmotivated fights and chases before
the ends of the
first episodes. After a promising
start,
the
Elliotts declined
in
quality
very
quickly,
not even
matching the more formularized (but at least vigorous)

Starrett
series. However,
Elliott was to regain

on Zane Grey novels, good directors, and,
as with the
Mix
films,
excellent photography and
locations. They
also served as useful training ground for new stars that
Fox was grooming: Humphrey Bogart, George Brent,
Maureen
O'Sullivan, Myrna
Loy. But
they were
un-
doubtedly too expensive to compete with the many other
"B" Westerns on
the market, and were abandoned
in
the mid-thirties.
O'Brien
was
shifted
into
an
independent
series
of
much lower quality for Sol Lesser, and released through
Fox. However,
at
least one of these. When a Man's a
132

Man, from the Harold Bell Wright novel, proved to be
a genuine
"sleeper."
Intelligently played
(with a par-
ticularly strong and likeable performance from Dorothy
Wilson as the heroine), and with a logical, literate script,
it avoided most of the cliches, built up to an extremely
exciting climax, and even had the wit to
let
its rather
reasonable
villain
(Harry Woods)
get away
scot-free.
One of its greatest assets was the beautifully
lit camera-
work
of one
of
the
most
underrated
of
all
cinema-
tographers, Frank Good. When a Man's a Man is one of
the best
"little" Westerns ever made.
Right
through
the
thirties Paramount continued
to
make (and remake)
its highly popular Zane Grey series.
At
the
beginning
of the sound period
they were
still
almost ''specials"—Fighting Caravans with Gary Cooper
ran
for nine
reels. Through the early
thirties they de-
creased
in length (many of them running less than an
hour) while increasing in quality, but by the end of the
thirties there was a tendency
for them
to creep up to
seven- and eight-reel lengths again. Although the aver-
age standard was high, they were an uneven group of
Westerns, some being so
faithful to the
original Grey
novels that their plot complications and multiplicity of
characters worked
against them.
Others,
like Man
of
the Forest and The Thundering Herd, were built around
footage from the
silent versions, a deception that was
aided by
re-hiring many
of the same players
so
that
footage a decade
apart could be
intercut more
easily.
On
the whole, however,
it was an extremely good
series, making excellent use of such contract directors
as Henry Hathaway and such contract players as Ran-
dolph
Scott, Raymond
Hatton,
Buster
Crabbe, Tom
Keene, Monte
Blue, Noah Beery
(a marvelous
fruity
villain in many of them), and Harry Carey. Within the
limits
of
the "B" framework, many could have been
considered models of their kind, especially To the Last
Man with
its strong story of feuding families in the post-
Civil War
era, and
its unusual climactic
fight between
the villain (Jack LaRue) and the heroine (Esther Ral-
ston). One might also mention Thunder Trail. Few "B"
Westerns ever gave more value for money than
it did.
A good
story, based on Arizona Ames,
its 58 minutes
spanned some
fifteen
years
with
its
long-lost
brother
motif, found time for logical writing, subtle characteri-
zations and
constant
action.
It was
given
additional
freshness by the use of players not then associated with
Westerns:
Gilbert Roland
as the hero,
J. Carrol Naish
as his Mexican sidekick, Charles Bickford as the villain,
and Marsha Hunt
as
the
heroine.
In
addition,
it was
photographed
by
one
of
the
best cameremen
in
the
business, Karl Struss, and the additional care showed in
every foot of film.
In
1935, Paramount initiated a new series, based on
Clarence E. Mulford's "Hopalong Cassidy" books. Un-
certain at first that the initial film in the series would be
popular enough to justify even a few follow-ups. Para-
mount certainly had no idea that
it would develop into
one of the most popular Western series of all, sustaining
itself until the end of the forties and then switching to
television. One of the keys to its success, of course, was
the personality of
its
star, William Boyd, a former De-

Mille player who could command the following of adults
as
well
as
children. The
screen
character
created
for
Cassidy was nothing
like Mulford's original;
in Boyd's
hands he became both a gentleman and a modern cava-
lier. The
scripts occasionally went overboard
in rather
mawkish
sentiment
to
establish
his
nobility
and
the
pedestal he was placed on by small boys, hard-pressed
widows,
and
ill-treated
dogs.
Nevertheless,
the Boyd
characterization became so popular that when the Mul-
ford novels were
later reissued, they were partially re-
written to conform to the "new" Cassidy image.
The
first Cassidy Westerns were
in many ways
the
best. They lacked polish, but they had good scripts and
casts, and created
a
realistic picture of ranch
life with
its humdrum
chores and
boisterous
horseplay.
Action
was played down
at
first,
partly because the scenarios
were thoughtful and reasonably
faithful adaptations of
specific Mulford novels, partly too because Boyd (who
had made only a couple of lesser "A" Westerns before)
was not yet an accomplished action star, and had to be
doubled in
all of his riding and fights, primarily by Qiff
Lyons. The first dozen films, however, made up for their
somewhat slow pace by climaxes
of astonishing vigor
and scope; the build-up would be methodical, and then
suddenly these large-scale action climaxes would hit the
screen, accompanied by the equally sudden introduction
of background music, which had been witheld during
earlier,
lesser action sequences. The format was an
in-
teresting one, and was copied by many other Western
producers,
but
it
was
also
a
rigidly
restrictive
one.
Wisely,
it was abandoned after
it had served its purpose.
Because of their huge popularity, the Cassidy Westerns
extended
their
lengths, and
it was not uncommon for
them to run
as long as eighty minutes. However,
their
scripts became overly simple, and their action content,
even after Boyd had learned to ride well, remained mild.

such
as

and

superior products,
but too many
of them were bland
and lacking in excitement. They
all had the advantage
of
first-rate
photography
and
outstandingly
beautiful
locations though. Even a dull film like Cassidy of Bar 20
was consistently good to look at. In the forties, however,
the Cassidys were to improve; their scripts were strength-
ened and their action content increased.
Warner Brothers produced only two Western
series
in the
thirties.
First there was the John Wayne
series,
actionful,
but
assembly-line
jobs,
and
later
the Dick
Foran
musical
Westerns.
Although
these,
like
the
Waynes,
used
a
great deal
of stock footage from the
silent Ken Maynards, they were slicker and much more
polished. Foran sang well, but in an effort to sell him to
the youngsters, he tended to indulge in too much small-
boy sentiment, and the dialogue
in his
films was often
artificial,
dime-novel
stuff.
But
the
ploy worked—his
films were popular with children. Moreover, their solid
production values enable them to stand up well today,
with Foran
himself,
through no
fault of
his own,
the
only weak element
in them. Foran's popularity caused
him to be promoted to dramatic features, and Warners
then
gave up "B"
Westerns
entirely,
although
in
the
forties
they expanded
their "A" Western
output, and
also made two series of Western shorts.
Universal
was
the
one
major company
that
main-
tained a full "B" Western schedule without even a pause
for
stock-taking when
talkies came
in.
In
the
early
thirties. Ken Maynard and Tom Mix were
their key
cowboy heroes. Maynard, who in the sound era was to
fluctuate between major companies and cheap indepen-
dents, was no longer in his prime and did not take well
to dialogue. But he had his own unit, and his films were
far from formula. He wrote many of his own
stories,
which were often bizarre and incredible in the extreme.
Honor of the Range had him playing a dual role as twin
brothers, one weak and cowardly, the other strong and
noble. Smoking Guns was
a weird melange of spooky
"old
house"
thrills,
crocodiles
in
South
American
jungles,
and
enough
illogical
plot
twists
and
coinci-
dences
to
put
Erich
von
Stroheim's Queen
Kelly
to
shame!
But,
if
nothing
else,
the Maynard
Universals
were
colorful and
unpredictable, and
certainly
full
of
action.
Tom Mix's series for Universal tried hard to duplicate
the formula
of
his
successful Fox
films,
going
in
for
both rugged action and good stories, as in Destry Rides
Again, or for an
all-out
circus approach,
best typified
by My Pal the King. This was a Ruritanian adventure in

climax
in

filling with water. At one
point Mix came
"out"
of the
picture
to
address
the
audience directly, asking them to put themselves in the
place
of the
little boy king seeing his
first rodeo, and
this simple
little device worked well in rendering the rest
of
the
exaggerated
melodramatics
acceptable.
Mix's
speech was
bad,
unfortunately. He
slurred
his words
and
read
his
lines
with
apparent
disinterest. But he
carried
his
years
well, was
still an
expert
rider,
and
managed
his other action with a modicum of doubles.
To
follow
the Mix
series.
Universal
signed Buck
Jones. His
initial group of Westerns was of exceptional
quality. Films like Border Brigands, Rock Rhodes and
The
Crimson
Trail had
good
scripts
and
top-grade
action content. Later groups unfortunately suffered from
budget cuts, too much talk and not enough
action,
al-
though they
still retained an above-average quality. And
of course the Jones personality made up for many other
shortcomings. While
at Universal
in the
thirties, Jones
also made four Western serials: The Roaring West was
all action and no plot and The Phantom Rider was
all
plot and
little action, but Gordon of Ghost City struck
a happy medium, and The Red Rider was best of
all.
Its dialogue was naturalistic,
its action a
little more in-
ventive than the confines of the serial usually permitted,
and there were several unusual
plot
twists. The
villain
(Walter
Miller)
left
unwitting clues
to
his
identity by
discarding
his marijuana cigarettes
at the scene of the
crime. No
critical
issue was made of
this
vice, and
it
certainly
in no way impaired
Miller's
ability to evolve
inspired criminal schemes on the spur of the moment.
The Red Rider was
also notable for two elements ex-
tremely
rare
in the Western
serial: romance and some
likeable bantering comedy, the latter from the bad guys
as well
as the heroes.
In the late thirties. Universal attempted to change
its
image, and aim more
at the family trade.
In
line with
this thinking, the KarlofT-Lugosi horror films were out,
and Deanna Durbin was in. The rugged old Jones West-
erns were replaced by an ultra-streamlined series
star-
ring singing cowboy Bob Baker. They were extremely
pleasant
films,
with
quite
strong
stories and
beautiful
locations, and their direction was often inventive. For-
mer
film
editor Joseph
H. Lewis
(later
a
director
of
high-powered melodramas) directed many of them, and
with adroit editing and camera placement, he often ex-
tracted much more punch from them than
their scripts
could
have
suggested.
For
they were
about
the most
relaxed and easy-going Westerns ever made, seemingly
going out of their way to avoid or minimize action. This
was surprising, since Baker was a rugged fellow and an

expert
rider, and occasionally could be seen doing his
own stunts without a double. This series was never very
popular, and at the end of the thirties Universal reverted
to
type
with
a more
actionful
Johnny Mack Brown
series.
The only other major company to produce "B" West-
erns
regularly was RKO Radio, which had begun
in
the early
thirties with a Tom Keene
series. Keene was
one of the more genuinely handsome Western stars, and
a
reasonably
good
if
sometimes
overly-enthusiastic
actor. He
handled
his
action
well,
although
he was
never wholly
at ease with horses. His RKO films were
carefully made and notable for big-scale climaxes, but
they lacked polish, as indeed did most RKO program-
mers in that period. However, RKO's subsequent series
with
George
O'Brien was
a
big
stride
forward. The
O'Brien's were unusually well-made fUms, obviously far
more expensive than
the average "B"
Western. They
were never in the front rank of juvenile favorites, since
their stress on good stories and restrained action tended
to
alienate
youngsters, who preferred
the simpler and
more direct action of a Ken Maynard. But on the other
hand, their very quality enabled the O'Briens to appeal
to
adults
as
well, and
as a
result they got
far
better
bookings, often
at big circuit houses, than the majority
of "B" Westerns. Racketeers of the Range and Lawless
Valley were the
best
of
this very distinguished
series.
Undoubtedly the most prolific producer of Westerns
during the thirties
(or any other period) was Republic
Pictures,
an
initially
small
independent company
that
grew out of the even smaller Mascot Pictures. Through
a concentration on quality Westerns and serials. Repub-
lic amassed profits that ultimately enabled
it to expand
to major company status. Even when it did so, it sensibly
maintained
a
large
schedule
of
its
bread-and-butter
Western
product,
while
adding many
big-scale
color
Westerns
as
well. However,
like Paramount, Republic
seemed
to
lack
the
knack
of
transposing
the
speed,
slickness and energy of its smaller Westerns to its bigger
ones. With the exception of a brace of specials by John
Ford and Raoul Walsh, most of
its
large-scale West-
erns—even the John Wayne vehicles—tended to be slow-
moving, studio-bound, and overloaded with characters
and expensive decor. But Republic's "B" Westerns were
perfect examples of streamlined assembly-line products.
Factory products they
certainly
were,
formularized
in
cast and
plot.
Plots
at Republic were conspicuous
for
their lack of enterprise and substance and for the num-

ber
of
times
they
were
remade
with
an
astonishing
absence of variety. One could take an early John Wayne
story-line and follow
its loyal service through the years
as
it was
adapted
to
the
needs
of Roy
Rogers,
Bill
Elliott
and
others,
ultimately
winding
up
with
John
Wayne
again.
Key
action
footage was
repeated
end-
lessly, and even songs were doctored—even by just one
word—so that an "old" Roy Rogers song like "Roll On
Texas Moon" would re-emerge
as a "new" Rex Allen
song, "Roll On Border Moon." But
if one can carp
at
this economy-minded pillaging of content, no such com-
plaints could be levelled at these films' most important
ingredients, action and production values. From the be-
ginning, Republic got more excitement into their chases,
more pep
into
their
stunts, and more punch
into their
fights, than any other studio. Camerawork was always
clean, sharp and crystal
clear, and locations
first-class.
Republic also built up an outstanding library of musical
themes:
pastorale,
mysterioso,
agitato.
Their
musical
scores were among the
best
in
the
business. Few "B"
Westerns could long escape the taint of standardization,
and since the key requirement of the "B" was action,
it
hardly mattered
that Republic's machinery showed.
It
was
exceptionally
well-oiled
machinery
and
operated
flawlessly.
Republic got under way with good
if straightforward
series with Bob Steele, Johnny Mack Brown, and John
Wayne, but
first made audiences and exhibitors
really
sit up and take notice
in 1935-36 with two new series.
The Three Mesquiteers, based on characters by William
Colt MacDonald, launched one of the most expert and
enjoyable
of
all Western
series. Even
the
stories
(in-
itially based on MacDonald's novels) were a decided cut
above
the
average
Republic
standard. The
characters
were obviously harmless plagiarisms from Dumas' Three
Musketeers, and
they enjoyed
a similar romantic and
adventurous
cameraderie. Ray
Corrigan, Bob
Living-
ston, and Max Terhune played
the heroic
trio
in the
early and best entries in the series, though later on John

(plus sundry unfunny comic "pals")
were utilized too. In terms of period, the films were in-
consistent, to say the least
: the very first film was set in
the immediate post-World War
I years, and the heroes
were
veterans making
a
rather
incongruous
covered-
wagon trek to the West
in search of new homes. Other
installments
in the very long-running series were set
in
the Old West, in Civil War days, and, in the mid-forties,
in
contemporary World War
II,
since
the West was
then overrun by Axis
spies seeking either mineral de-
posits or wild horses for use on the
battlefields! But
at
least the Three Mesquiteer films
(before the inevitable
decline
in
their
final
year
or two)
were
consistent
in
their
fast,
clean,
uncomplicated
action
entertainment.
The
stunt work,
usually organized and performed by
Yakima
Canutt,
was
of
the
highest
calibre,
and
the
chases, shot from a new camera car of which Republic
was
very proud
and used
constantly, were
unusually
smooth and
exhilarating. Heart of the Rockies, Range
Defenders, and Outlaws of Sonora were the best of this
fine
series,
which
was
so
successful
that
it
naturally
prompted many imitations.
But even more far-reaching was the
influence
of
a
Gene
Autry
Western
that Republic
offered
in
1935,
Tumbling Tumbleweeds. Autry was
a former singer of
cowboy
songs on
radio,
and had
starred
in
Mascot's
science-fiction Western
serial Phantom Empire, as well
as having minor
roles
in two Ken Maynard Westerns.
Tumbling
Tumbleweeds
was
a
fairly
straightforward
Western, though on
a
slightly bigger
scale than most,
and
with
a
large quota of songs. Although Ken May-
nard, much earlier, had been the
first to introduce songs
into his movies, they were brought in naturally and un-
obtrusively, and
in any
case Maynard's
singing voice
was
so
unremarkable
that
the musical element of
his
films was
neither
stressed nor
exploited.
But
the
first
Autry release was so successful that Republic immedi-
ately devised a new and unique formula for him. Songs
and
hillbilly comedy
(largely supplied by Smiley Bur-
nette, a fixture in
all the Autry films ) were given equal
prominence with action, and indeed in many rural areas
it
was
these
elements
that
were
the
key
box-oflice
attractions.
The remarkable
thing about
the Autry Westerns
is
how quickly they, and Autry, improved and acquired a
definite style of their own. The initial films were a trifle
uncertain in what approach to take, a little disjointed in
their action and the musical elements were often clumsily
introduced.
Autry's
riding
and
athletic
abilities
were
limited at
first, although this was not too apparent since
unusual
skill was brought to bear in the use of doubles,
and clever editing and camera trickery often made
it look
as
though
Autry was
indeed
pulling
oflF
tricky
action
stunts.
But
within two
years,
a
bright,
breezy,
thor-
146

oughly entertaining formula had evolved. By now Autry
had increased his riding and athletic skills ten-fold, and
his originally rather colorless personality had become a
most
engaging
one.
He
never
aspired
to
the
acting
standards
of a Buck
Jones,
but on
the other hand
his
scripts seldom
required him
to. Warmth and geniality
were enough. To offset expected criticisms that this new
brand
of musical Western was
a travesty of tradition,
Republic set them in their own never-never land, placing
them quite apart from other Westerns. The earlier "his-
torical"
Cavalry-vs. -Indian
Westerns
that
Autry
had
made—Ride, Ranger, Ride and The Singing Vagabond-
were abandoned
in favor of entirely modern Westerns.
Autry frequently played a rodeo or radio star (and
al-
ways under
his own name);
the props included high-
powered cars, army tanks, airplanes, and radio stations;
and
the
plots
touched
on
contemporary
politics,
big
business, social problems (the dust bowl), dairy farming
as opposed to cattle ranching, problems of soil erosion
and crop destruction by weeds. Against this thoroughly
modern background, the traditional action ingredients-
runaway
stagecoaches
and
bar-room
brawls,
to
say
nothing of cowboys toting guns and engaging in full-scale
range wars—were incongruous indeed, but here the musi-
cal elements came to the rescue. Short-skirted, glamor-
ous cowgirls paraded down Western
streets urging the
populace to vote for Sheriff Autry; the villains operated
lush
Broadway
night
clubs
in
small Western
towns
where their potential customer
list must have been
nil;
ranch
owners
usually had
palatial homes back
East,
where their pretty and spoiled daughters lolled around
swimming pools in brief bathing suits. All of this obvi-
ously artificial glamor and song put the Autry films into
a
deliberate
kind
of
horse-operetta framework which
disarmed any
criticism.
Admittedly,
at times
the song
and frolic aspect dominated out of all proportion, to the
extent that some of the films had almost no action at all.
But
on
the
whole
the
balance was
well
maintained.
Autry's stock company of directors, cameramen, musi-
cians and players (June Storey was a lovely and most
engaging leading lady in many of his films) knew what
was expected, and they delivered
it. In terms of quality
(if not of popularity) Autry's peak arrived in late 1937,
and was maintained through
1939
with such
films
as
The Yodelling Kid from Pine Ridge, In Old Monterey
and Colorado
Sunset.
South
of
the
Border,
a
big
hit
because of
its popular
title song and added production
values, caused the Autrys
to be upgraded
into bigger,
longer, slower (and more musical) productions tempo-
rarily, but without any lessening of Autry's popularity.
In
fact,
he was
consistently
listed
in
the "Top Ten"
money-making
polls taken
annually among American

While
some
of
Autry's Westerns were relatively serious-S/erra Sue for
example—the
biggest successes were those which most
fully exploited their freedom from convention, such as
South of the Border with
its improbable South American
revolution
and
spy
tale, and
a
heroine who
enters
a
convent!
The
fantastic
public response
to
the Autry musical
Westerns
naturally produced singing cowboys from
all
sides. Some
of them were even
better
singers and/or
actors than Autry, but they lacked the magic combina-
tion
of
Autry's
personality
and
Republic
production
know-how. Tex Ritter, Bob Baker, Jack Randall, Smith
Ballew, James Newill, Fred Scott, and Dick Foran were
among
the would-be Autry
successors, and
still more
followed
in
the
forties:
Jimmy Wakely (who
copied
Autry slavishly, even to using identically designed shirts
and
costumes),
Eddie
Dean,
Monte
Hale,
and Rex
Allen. Even the
little-seen all-Negro Westerns
(incred-
ibly inept, and containing more self-imposed racial ster-
eotypes than "white" Hollywood ever created)
discov-
ered their own singing cowboy in Herb Jeffries. Bearing
titles like The Bronze Buckaroo and Harlem Rides the
Range,
they were Westerns
that obstinately refused
to
deliver the fast action that their audiences wanted. The
producers took
their small
units out to excellent loca-
Desperate Trails
(Universal, 1939).
A new team:
Bob Baker,
Johnny Mack Brown,
Fuzzy Knight
tions, and then lacked the know-how to follow through.
The sparse
fights were clumsy and unconvincing, and
the chases were even worse. The plots were the stand-
ard Western themes, with stock dialogue amplified and
exaggerated until, unwittingly,
it reached near-burlesque
proportions. Interestingly enough, there was no inverted
racism in these films. The stories took place in a totally
black West; there were no whites
in them
at
all, even
as villains! Yet the prolonged and padded comedy relief
invariably consisted of the kind of material
(the comic
pal
scared
of
ghosts,
the
chicken-stealing
cook,
the
crap-shooting, lazy roustabouts) which the Negroes un-
derstandably
objected
to
in
regular Hollywood
films.
Apart from
the
"personality"
stars
like Herb
Jeffries,
the
acting
level was low, although
the
casts remained
fairly constant from film to film, with the same comics
and heavies. While the veteran Sam Newfield directed
one or two of them, most of these Westerns were made
by inexperienced Negro directors. The musical element
was not stressed, and Jeffries was really the only singing
cowboy that this small group produced.
But the most successful of them
all, and the only one
ever to challenge Autry's supremacy, was Roy Rogers,
who had played singing and other bits in several Autry
and
Mesquiteer Westerns and who was developed by
Republic
in 1938
as a second-string Autry. At
first his
films had
very much a pattern of their own:

mained traditional historical and action Westerns, with
songs introduced
casually,
if frequently. Rogers had a
likeable
personality but was of slim
build, and
didn't
seem a very formidable opponent for the imposing array
of villains that the studio lined up for him: Fred Kohler,
Cyrus Kendall, Noble Johnson. Nevertheless, the early
Rogers Westerns had flair and style. In the early forties,
however,
they began
to emulate the Autry
films more
openly,
although
with
such
a down-playing of
action
content and
often
such
a
total
avoidance
of
fisticuffs
that juvenile support and enthusiasm was slow in com-
ing.
However,
when
Autry
joined
the
armed
forces
during World War
II, Republic got behind the Rogers
films with a big "King of the Cowboys" campaign, and
built Rogers into a major star. His films, many of them
remakes
of
earlier
Autry
successes,
were
given
far
bigger budgets than had ev^ been allocated to Autry,
and for a time the formula w|s almost destroyed through
imbalance. An over-stress on music—not just songs but
mildly spectacular production numbers and long
fiesta
and nightclub sequences—often crowded the action
in-
gredients
out
almost
entirely,
and
such
Westerns
as
Idaho and The Cowboy and the Senorita could far more
logically have been labelled merely musicals. The cos-
tumes employed by Rogers, heroine Dale Evans, and the
singing group The Sons of the Pioneers became more
reminiscent of uniforms or Broadway chorus line cos-
tumes
than
of
authentic
Western
regalia,
and
only
comedy
relief Gabby Hayes was
left as a link with the
Westerns
of
old. However,
with Rogers
firmly
estab-
151

Shooting a riding closeup from a camera car
lished, the always economy-conscious Republic saw no
need to continue with these musical spectaculars indefi-
nitely, and gradually the budgets were lowered and the
musical elements reduced. Towards the end of his con-
tract
at Republic, when
his
films were being made
in
Trucolor, there was even a drastic shift of emphasis so
that music
almost
disappeared,
and
action was
over-
emphasized via often extremely savage and bloody fight
scenes,
and
unpleasant
plot-lines
in
which
murders,
beatings, and the mistreatment of animals became un-
necessarily prominent.
While the Rogers Westerns never quite duplicated the
freshness of the Autrys,
at
their best
(in the
1942-43
years, when Rogers was being
built up but hadn't yet
been thrust into the inflated musicals) they had a sober
and
realistic
quality and
a neat blending of song and
action. Heart of the Golden West, Silver Spurs, and The

Monogram
(which

a

history

Re-
public,
with
roots
in
the
old Rayart company
of
the
twenties)
in
a
sense
paralleled Republic
through
the
thirties, but never equalled
it. Their
first sound West-
erns, with
Bill Cody, Bob Steele, Tom Tyler, and Rex
Bell, were
indistinguishable from most other indepen-
dent Westerns
of
the
period, though
their
plots were
sometimes a cut above the average. Tom Tyler's Part-
ners of the
Trail was unique
in having no
villains, an
element of mysticism, a hero accused of the murder of
his wife, and a strong prison-cell scene of the hero going
beserk, that was shot almost in the style of German ex-
pressionism. Monogram drew
its Western stars from the
ranks of those who had slipped slightly or newcomers on
the way up. After John Wayne
left Warners, he made
a
series
for Monogram
of extremely
uneven
quality.
Some, like The Trail Beyond, were marathons of action,
others were
dull and
pedestrian.
If nothing
else, they
were unique in
their stunt action. Yakima Canutt was
their
perennial
villain
and
double
for
Wayne;
as
a
double he was frequently photographed in semi-closeup,
and
in the climactic sequences he could often be seen
literally chasing himself. Also during the thirties Mono-
gram turned out enjoyable series with Tom Keene, Tim
McCoy, Tex Ritter (whose films were often built around
stock footage going as far back as Thomas Ince's The
Deserter!), and Jack
Randall. Monogram had one

Renegade

the best Western ranch locations of any studio, located

in Harry Neumann they had an excel-
lent cameraman too. Their basic weakness was in allo-
cating bigger than usual budgets to the
first films in any
given
series,
establishing
a
level
of
quality,
and then
cutting the budgets
drastically so that that quality was
not maintained. A good example were the Jack Randall
Westerns,
initially produced by
Scott R. Dunlap, and
given excellent production mountings, only to slip back
to
a
routine
level
after
a handful
of
first-class
films.
Randall's
first film for Monogram, Riders of the Dawn,
has real class and a brilliantly staged, photographed, and
stunted
climax.
It
is
a
running gun
battle between
a
posse of lawmen and the villains, some of whom are in
a
stagecoach. The
efi'ectiveness
of
the climax was
in-
creased by
its
utilization of the Hopalong Cassidy for-
mula—a
fairly
slow
and
methodical
build-up
to
this
prolonged climax, and the sudden introduction of back-
ground music
to underline
its
action. This
final chase,
staged on
salt
flats, would have done credit to a much
larger
production,
and may
well
have come
to John
Ford's attention, for
its similarities to his Stagecoach of
the following year are unmistakeable. Monogram was to
improve the overall
quality of
its "B" Westerns
in the
early
forties,
and
later on would make
isolated "A"
Westerns superior to the average Republic product, but
the
studio
was
to
remain

THE THIRTIES
The spectacular upsurge in both the quantity and quality
of the "B" Western throughout the thirties was hardly
matched by
a corresponding
increase
in
the
big-scale
Western. Most of the major companies hardly bothered
with
the "A" Western. Fox, even though
it had John
Ford under contract for the entire period,
didn't offer
him a single horse opera, and indeed avoided the genre
almost
entirely.
Ramona,
the
old
Indian
romantic
tragedy, was remade
primarily because
it
afforded an
excuse for using the newly-perfected three-color Techni-
color. A
medium-budget
Cisco
Kid
adventure
with
Warner Baxter was
a long way below the standard of
Raoul Walsh's original, but did serve to pave the way
for a later continuing series, with Cesar Romero. MGM
made an occasional Wallace Beery good-badman West-
ern, a la The Badman of Brimstone, and also used the
Western format to turn Robert Taylor and Nelson Eddy
into
"he-men" when
their
glamorous,
romantic
roles
began to fade
in popularity. Two of the Nelson Eddy-
Jeanette MacDonald
operettas. Rose Marie and
The
Girl of the Golden
West, might also be termed fringe
Westerns. William Wellman's Robin Hood of Eldorado,
a
romanticized
but
rugged
biography
of
the
bandit
Juaquin
Murietta, was the
best of MGM's handful
of
Westerns.
The Columbia schedule was totally devoid of major
Westerns,
although some
of
their programmers had a
quality which indicated that they might well have bene-
154

fitted from more ambitious treatment. The End of the
Trail, from
a Zane Grey
story, was unique
in both
its
plot
(starting
with
the
Spanish-American War,
it
fol-
lowed
its protagonists through
to modern racketeering
in the contemporary West) and
in
its use of an "anti-
hero" long before either the expression or the type be-
came commonplace.
It must also rank as the only West-
ern in which the hero (Jack Holt) went to the gallows
at the end for killing the villain—an unusually poignant
and
well-played
scene
that must have wreaked havoc
on unprepared juvenile audiences.
Universal's sole spectacular of the thirties was Sutter's
Gold, a project originally designed for the great Russian
director S. M. Eisenstein, who ultimately never worked in
Hollywood
at
all. Drastically reshaped as a vehicle for
Edward
Arnold
it
was
also
intended
to
re-establish
director
James
Cruze
and
be
a
talkie
equivalent
of
The Covered Wagon. Unfortunately,
it was. Despite
a
crowded canvas
it was a jerky, episodic tale, frequently
held
together by
old-fashioned
subtitles,
and
with
its
action sequences staged on
a big scale but disappoint-
ingly underplayed.
Its length,
its lack of big star names,
and
its much
higher
than
anticipated
budget
all
but
wrecked Universal, which would have been crippled by
this one
film had not a
real
blockbuster. Show Boat,
come along to
bail them out
at just the
right time.
Until
1939, Warner
Brothers,
too,
kept away from
the
big
Westerns,
catering
to
the
action market
with
their Errol Flynn swashbucklers, their crime films, and
their rugged Technicolor Northwoods adventures—Go^'^
Country and the Woman, Heart of the North, Valley of
the Giants.
Actually,
by
far
the
best
Warner
Western
of
the
thirties was Massacre (1933), a film which really grew
out of their series of social protest melodramas. Richard
Barthelmess played a successful rodeo Indian star who
returns to his reservation, only to find his people cheated
by their white overseers and dying of disease and starva-
tion. A
little known film even in
its day, and never re-
vived. Massacre was probably the best talkie of director
Alan Crosland, who had been at the peak of his prestige
in
the
late twenties with such
films
as Don Juan and
The Jazz Singer. The story
is perhaps more than a little
influenced
in
its structure by
I Am a Fugitive from a
Chain Gang, and like most of the other social essays of
the early
thirties,
its framework
is a melodramatic one
in which
the
scales
of
social comment
are
decidedly
loaded—it does seem unlikely that all of the white Indian
Affairs officers were corrupt thieves, rapists, lechers and
drug
addicts! But
since
the
story hardly claims docu-
mentary status and since like Zane Grey's The Vanish-
ing American, the story
is a darned good one, the out-

something of a bonus.
It offered
fine camerawork with
striking
images
and
well-chosen

powerfully
done mob scenes, and much casual race humor (a Negro
valet constantly makes cracks about Indians, whom he
considers
his social

RKO Radio maintained
a
fairly
regular
output
of
medium
budget
Westerns,
stronger on
plot and
casts
than on
action:
Powdersmoke Range,
in which
they
gathered together such an
all-star cast of current and
former Western stars that there was almost no time left
for story or action; The Arizonian, a good Richard Dix
vehicle; and, best of all, The Last Outlaw, a strong John
Ford story
(unfortunately not directed by him)
about
an old-time outlaw returning from
jail
to the modern
West to find himself up against prejudice, modern rack-
eteers,
and—a
neat
touch—townsfolk
who
were
en-
tranced by the new
singing cowboy Westerns
in
their
theatre! Harry Carey played the old-timer, and a par-
ticularly good cast backed him up: Hoot Gibson, Tom
Tyler, Henry B.
Walthall, and current singing cowboy
star Fred Scott.

no difficulty in effectively monopolizing the epic Western
in the thirties. There was no competition. Unfortunately
Paramount, always so expert in less ambitious Westerns,
never mastered the knack of turning out big-scale ones
equally well. (Exceptions to this are some of their post-
1950
Westerns
directed
for them
by John Ford and
others;
but by
then
the system
of
studio
control and
contract
players
and
directors
had
undergone
great
changes, and the later Ford and Howard Hawks West-
erns were thus merely financed and released by Para-
mount,
not
physically produced by them.)
By
far the
best
of Paramount's
quartet
of mid-thirties
epics was
The Texas Rangers, and indeed, despite
its weaknesses,
it
is
still one of the most enjoyable Paramount super-
Westerns
from
any
period.

Streets of Laredo. The Indians were deleted from that
version
entirely,
along with
all
the
epic
qualities, and
overdoses of sex and
brutality were added. The
basic
illustration
in
all of the ads was of a
sadistic
flogging,
an element not present in the original film at
all.) The
Texas Rangers
is
full of pleasingly heroic images and
has a stirring musical score borrowed partially from Old
Ironsides. The
staging
of
the
action
is
splendid
(the
Indian fighting scenes originally involved use of the en-
larged Magnascope screen), the horse
falls and
stunts
lively, and the editing sharp, although, curiously, as
in
The
Covered
Wagon,
there
is no
intercutting
of
the
Cavalry

se-
quences. Vidor was too good a director not to know the
value of cross-cutting, but
in
this instance he probably
160

Union Pacific
felt
it would have been too much of a "B" picture cliche
to
use. The
locations
are
impressive and
unfamiliar;
most
of
the
film was
shot out
of
doors, making
the
occasional studio "exteriors" (Indians rolling rocks over
a
cliff)
stick out like sore thumbs, but these scenes are
few and
largely for matching-up or cutaway purposes.
Even though
not
a
classic. The
Texas Rangers
is an
exhilarating Western with a refreshing schoolboy vigor.
It also was fortunate in having one of those key scenes
that made
a vivid impression and
is constantly talked
about as one of the cinematic highspots of the thirties-
Lloyd Nolan's callous murder of his friend Jack Oakie,
shooting him in the belly from under a table while smil-
ing and talking in tones of friendship and devotion.
Paramount's
other
big super-Western
of
1936, and
to
the
studio
a much more
important
property,
was
Cecil B. DeMille's The Plainsman, with Gary Cooper as
Wild
Bill
Hickok.
Although DeMille had
flirted
with
Western themes earlier, this was his
first full-scale epic,
and while
it was a big popular success,
it was hardly a
good picture.
Its script was heavy-handed and obvious,
and
far too much of the film was spoiled by DeMille's
over-fondness
for shooting
as much of
his
pictures
as
possible
within
the
confines
of
the
studio. He was
a
director whose sense of efficiency demanded that every
studio
facility, every piece of equipment, every depart-
ment head, be on call
at
all times. He was a showman
like Ziegfeld rather than an
artist
like
Griffith, and he
only functioned well on
his home studio ground.
(Big
action sequences that had to be shot outside the studio
were
usually
handled
by
second
unit
directors
like
Arthur
Rosson,
their
skill
and
exciting
staging
mini-
mized when
they
were
later
intercut
with
prolonged
studio-filmed
inserts.) At a time when Harry Sherman
was producing the "B" Hopalong Cassidy Westerns for
the same studio and using superb locations with nary a
process
screen
in
sight,
it was
jarring
indeed
to
find
DeMille
in The Plainsman, with
its huge budget,
inter-
cutting genuine exteriors with the most patently phony
studio duplicates, bobbing
his
actors across the screen
on
mock-up
horses,
and
using back
projection
tech-
niques throughout.
Nevertheless, despite the omnipresence of the process
screen and a few big silent stock shots, the production
as
a
whole
was
big
and
certainly
entertaining.
Jean
Arthur,
playing Calamity Jane for glamor and blonde
hair
(a
far cry from
the homely, wizened woman that
was the real Calamity Jane! ) was even less realistic than
Doris
Day, who
later
played
Jane
in
a
Technicolor
musical. But audiences of the
thirties were not inclined

to carp at seeing a current top favorite in such a perfect
showcase
role. And DeMille never missed a chance to
drop
a
historical name or two, or ram home
a sledge
hammer point. The film opened with Abraham Lincoln
being dragged away from an all-important meeting
at
which the destiny of the West was about to be settled
because
a nagging Mrs.
Lincoln, warned him
that he
would be
late
for the theatre!
Slowly
paced,
but
colorful,
filled
with
interesting
characters and well-knit. The Plainsman may be all corn
and contrivance, but
its machinery works well, and
it
is
easy
to
see from
it why DeMille had such
a hold on
audiences
for
almost
a
half-century. More show than
film,
it
is also a major landmark in the movie treatment
of Wild
Bill
Hickok, who, from William
S. Hart and
Gary Cooper,
gradually
lessened
in
box-office
stature
(Richard Dix, Bruce Cabot, Roy Rogers, Ted Adams,
Douglas Kennedy, Tom Brown) and heroic status until,
in the
fifties (with films like / Killed Wild Bill Hickok)
he underwent a strange moral metamorphosis to become
accepted, without buildup or explanation,
as a
villain.
Attempts
by
Western
historians,
largely
during
the
forties, to destroy the myth and show that Hickok was
human and not a god, first set him up as merely a bully
and
a
showoff, then
as
a
lecher and
a coward,
and
finally
as an outright
killer. The ultimate was probably
reached
in
1953's Jack
McCall.

is acquitted by the court. (Conveniently,
that film forgot to mention that McCall was retried by
a different court and promptly hanged.)
For
all
their
script weaknesses. The Texas Rangers
and The Plainsman were both deserved popular
suc-
cesses,
but
Paramount
was
unable
to
duplicate
that
success
in
its
follow-ups.
Wells Fargo (1937)
was
a
long, carefully made, but
stiff,
dull and practically ac-
tionless
movie,
long on
historical
data, romance, and
interior scenes, short on excitement and exteriors. Like
all Frank Lloyd
epics,
it was treated
in tableau form,
with
the
characters
rather
lifelessly
symbolizing
pro-
gressive
pioneering,
self-centered
greed, and
so
forth.
The method had worked superbly well for Lloyd's ver-
sion of Noel Coward's Cavalcade, but
it never worked
on his several epics of American history. Later reissues
edited the
film
drastically, but such editing could only
shorten
it, not accelerate
its leaden pace. The following
year's The Texans, another remake of North of '36, was
hardly more successful, though a
trifle more animated.
Despite
a good
cast
(Randolph
Scott,
Joan
Bennett,
May Robson) and a good story of a cattle drive in post-
Civil War days,
it looked like what
it was:
an attempt
to make
an
"instant"
epic
with
the
snappier pace
of
Paramount's
smaller Zane Grey Westerns and
with
a
great deal of borrowing of stock footage.
It was big, but
disjointed,
clumsily
put
together,
and
lacking
in
any
kind of style.

Fortunately
for Paramount, however, the success of
The
Plainsman
had
spurred
DeMille
into
producing
another Western spectacle
as an immediate follow-up,
and in 1939 he released one of his best pictures, Vnion
Pacific. Although
it covered the same historical ground
as John Ford's The Iron Horse (and even copied one
or two sequences rather too carefully),
it had a better
script and one in which personal relationships and moti-
vations
were
appropriately
subordinated
to
the
basic
theme
of empire
building. Furthermore, DeMille kept
his action-a couple of fights, a train hold-up, an attack
by Indians, a train wreck in a snowy pass, the destruc-
tion
of the
villain's
saloon,
the
climactic
street shoot-
out-fairly
constant
and
regularly
spaced,
instead
of
compressing
all
of
his
action
into
single
highlight
se-
quences as he had done in The Plainsman and would do
again
in
his
dullest and
slowest Western, North
West
Mounted Police. The overdone Irish blarney of Barbara
Stanwyck
apart,
the
acting from
a
first-rate
cast was
uniformly
good,
and
there was
a
far more
satisfying
level of
intelligent and non-obtrusive comedy than one
usually found with DeMille. Union
Pacific was one of
1939's blockbusters, and in those days such major films
were slower
in
getting into general
release than
is the
practice today. By the time
it had played out its advance
-prestige" dates and had gone into general release, the
outbreak of World War
II was that much nearer. Few
people
in
the United
States believed
that
this country
could
actually
be embroiled
in
a war, but
feeling ran
high
against Nazi Germany, no one
could deny
that
there were dark days ahead, and patriotic zeal that had
lain dormant
for almost two decades was suddenly re-
kindled. Unwittingly, Vnion Pacific catered to that zeal,
and
its
climactic moments,
promising blood and
toil,
with some kind of Utopia "at the end of tracks," were
both prophetic and topical. A good film by any stand-
ards. Union
Pacific undoubtedly had
its box-ofhce po-
tential boosted by a wave of national feeling with which
it coincided
in so timely a fashion.
However, Union Pacific was too much of an isolated
film,
too
atypical
of
the Western
genre,
to bring
the
Western back to life on its own. That minor miracle was
wrought by a far less ambitious film, John Ford's Stage-
coach, which preceded
it in release by a month or two.
A
superb
film,
Stagecoach
caught
the
imagination
of
both
critics and public.
It was both entertainment and
poetry,
and
it made
an
instant
star
of John Wayne.
More
to
the
point,
it was
directly
responsible
for the
biggest
single
cycle
of
large-scale
Westerns
that
the
movies
had
ever
known:
Westerns
of
every
variety,
Westerns
in
Technicolor,
Westerns
with
bigger-name
stars than had hitherto condescended to appear in them.
Ruth Roland, queen of
silent Western
serials
The boom continued for a full three years, even upgrad-
ing the quality of "B" Westerns, too. While the freshness
began
to fade
in
1942,
the popularity
of the Western
had been too firmly re-established and entrenched for
it
ever to disappear from the screen again. The history of
the Western since 1942 has not been one of diminishing
and subsequent re-vitalizing;
it has instead been one of
constant
popularity,
the
changing
cycles
representing
only
the waves
of changing
tastes:
the Western
with
Sex
the
Western
with
Brutality;
the
Western
with
Psychology.
Even
the
Westerns
that
spoofed
them-
selves-and
a
cycle
of
self-burlesque
is
usually
a
sign
that a genre has played
itself out-were followed by yet
more cycles (including the unexpected popularity of the
German and Italian-made Westerns) which merely con-
firmed that while the Western had nothing intrinsically
new to say,
it was constantly finding new ways to say
it.
166

THE SERIALS
In
the
silent
era,
the
quantity
of Western
serials pro-
duced
ran
second
only
to
the
mystery
and
detection
serial,
a genre
that,
despite
its need of exposition and
lengthy dialogue
titles, proved
to be
well
suited to the
silent
film.
In sound films however, the Western moved
easily into first place. In a way, and notwithstanding the
enormous popularity of the Western, this was surprising.
For one
thing, by
its very nature a matter of familiar
formula, the Western was limited
in
its kind of action:
dynamited
shacks,
lynch
mobs,
stampeding
herds
of
cattle
or
buffalo,
falls from
cliffs or
into mine
shafts,
burning at the stake by redskins, an occasional flood or
avalanche,
falling under
an
Iron
Horse
or once
in
a
while an ore-crushing machine—that about summed up
the spectrum of perils that could be presented. Not only
is
the
list
so
limited
that
the
average
fifteen-chapter
serial found
itself repeating situations within
its
span,
but of course these same
situations were
spilling over
into other serials and the regular feature Westerns. Yet
despite
a
format which
permitted
less
deviation
and
variety than the science
fiction or adventure serial, the
Western
serial always flourished—even overcoming the
problem of thin plot material which too often, even with
the legitimately episodic theme of a wagon train trek-
became little more than a series of casually related fights
and chases. Occasionally though, the serial allowed itself
the
luxury
of
stepping
outside
the
already
strained
bounds of logic of the traditional Western, and mixed
science-fiction,
Nazi
spies and sundry
other melodra-
matic detours into the hopper.
Republic undoubtedly made the best Western serials,
just
as
it made
the
best "B" Westerns,
but Universal
(in
the
early
thirties)
and
Columbia
(in
the
early
forties) produced some good ones too. Most of the big
Western stars—Buck Jones, Ken Maynard, Tim McCoy,
William Desmond, Art Acord, Bill Elliott, Johnny Mack
Brown, Tom Mix, and even Gene Autry—made
serials
at one time 6t another
in their careers.

THE FOETIES -A PEAK OF POPULARITY
Without
for
one
instant
belittling
the
importance
of
Stagecoach as a film, not a
little of its success with the
critics can be ascribed to its snob value.
It was based on
a novel by Ernest Haycox,
itself regarded as a minor
classic of the genre, and both novel and film had their
original roots
in de Maupassant's "Boule de Suif." So
it was on firmer literary ground than any talkie Western
since Cimarron, and de Maupassant, even
if only
re-
motely connected with
it,
still carried more prestige than
Edna Ferber!
With the exception of the big Indian chase,
it either
avoided such traditional Western action as the fist-fight,
or,
as
in
the
climactic shoot-out
in the
streets, staged
most of
it ofT-screen and suggested more than
it showed.
For
all
of
its Fordian sentiment and
a
rich
gallery of
fairly standardized types,
it was a new kind of Western,
literate,
visually
poetic,
and
thus
one
that
could
be
praised without the lowering of one's own standards.
It
was the
first time that Ford had used Utah's Monument
Valley as a location, and the breathtaking scenic gran-
deur of the film impressed the critics too. But to a man
they seemed to miss the beauty of the writing, camera-
work, and
art
direction
in
the sequence near the end
wherein the hero walks
the
prostitute-heroine through
the
streets of Lordsburg, from the bustling Main Street
to the shadowy and raucous red light district which
is to
be her new home. Although the film
is slow
in getting
under way, the gallery of colorful portraits (Carradine,
172

Berton Churchill, and Donald Meek in particular)
sus-
tained
interest
until
the
magnificently staged
highlight
of the chase across the
salt
flats.
(Magnificent, but un-
realistic;
it was pointed out somewhat caustically by Bill
Hart that the Indians, being the intelligent warriors that
they were, would have shot the horses
first and ended
the chase
before
it began!)
But with
its
vivid
action,
dynamic horse falls, and other stunt work engineered by
Yakima
Canutt,
and
heroic
images
in
the
finale—the
cavalry bursting on to the screen in a sustained running
insert,
all
waving
banners,
bugles
and
swords
out-
stretched for the charge, nobody felt inclined to criticize
Ford for this deliberate oversight. Obviously Stagecoach
was not the screen's
first adult Western,
its
first poetic
Western, or
its
first literary Western, but
it was the
first
one in a long while to combine those elements so effec-
tively.
Its
enormous
popularity
was
understandable;
equally so the
prolific new cycle of deluxe-scale West-
erns
it prompted. What was surprising was that none of
its immediate offspring even attempted to duplicate
its
artistic standards, but were content to be big "shows."
They covered every dramatic and historic aspect of the
Western spectrum, but
in terms of big-scale
action,
as
showcases for the now more prevalent Technicolor, or
as vehicles
for
stars
(Errol Flynn, Robert Taylor, Jon
Hall, Franchot Tone, Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Ray
Stagecoach

Artists,
1939),

173

Milland, James Cagney)
not normally
associated with
the Western.
Wayne
and
Claire
Trevor
were
immediately
re-
teamed
in two big historical Westerns. The Dark Com-
mand (directed by Raoul Walsh), based on W. R. Bur-
nette's book about guerilla leader Cantrell, had a good
deal of merit, but was marred by typical Republic short-
comings, such
as Gabby Hayes comedy
injected
in an
effort to keep the "hick" audiences happy. However,
it
was
a
carefully made
film,
the
best
of
all
the deluxe
Republic Westerns. The second Wayne-Trevor vehicle,
Allegheny Uprising, was a rather plodding film for RKO
dealing with the Revolutionary War. So malapropos did
it seem
at the time to remind the British (then engaged
in fighting a war with America as a non-combatant ally)
that they had once fought against America, that
it was
never released
in
Britain.
Despite
the
great number and
variety
of Westerns
being turned
out
in
late
1939 through
1942,
they
all
seemed
to
fall
into one
of three
categories.
First and
foremost
there were the
historical Westerns; secondly,
there were the whitewashed biographies of outlaws, and
in terms of sheer quantity
this category rapidly moved
into
first position; and thirdly there were the comedies
and
the spoofs. Destry Rides Again worked a peculiar
kind of chemistry in its teaming of Marlene Dietrich and
James
Stewart.
It was
actually
a
dull and
uneventful
Western, weak on both story and drama,
full of cliche;
yet the dynamic Dietrich personality plus a memorable
musical
score
and
a
cast
full
of
enjoyable
character
players somehow held
it
all together and turned
it into
a
freak
box-office smash.
Despite
its
tragic ending—
hackneyed
situation
dating back
to Under Two Flags
and beyond— it was basically a kind of tongue-in-cheek
The Blue Angel, and not unreasonably has been credited
with introducing sex to the Western. Today
its sex con-
tent seems innocuous in the extreme, yet
it was the first
big step along
a new road
for the Western. Over the
next very few years, others would take
it several steps
farther:
the
sensationalism
of Howard
Hughes'
The
Outlaw, the piquant sex-farce of that much underrated
comedy Western Frontier Gal, the hard-breathing pas-
sion of King Vidor's Duel in the Sun. But for the time
being
it seemed that Destry Rides Again,
in the fore-
front of this new Western boom, at the same time made
it possible for the Western to kid
itself.
Western
satire has never been markedly
successful,
either aesthetically or commercially. The best were the
Sennett and Fairbanks spoofs of pre- 1920. Too many of
the
later
"satires"

it was imaginative
in
its
sight gags.
Allan Dwan's
Trail of the
Vigilantes, clearly trying to
recapture
the
spirit
of Destry Rides Again and
using
many of the same character players, was a most enjoy-
able
romp,
but
it
never became
true
satire.
Perhaps
because of the skill of the action scenes, and the suave,
straight playing of villain Warren William,
it seemed to
divide itself into two distinct halves. Most of the comedy
was placed
in the
first half, while the second half with
all
the
action,
whether
intended
or
not,
emerged
as
good,
straight Western fare.
Warner Brothers, whose only genuine epic Western in
the
thirties had been the
oflf-beat but sluggish Gold Is
Where
You
Find
It,
suddenly
embraced
the
genre
wholeheartedly with one
of the most enjoyable of
all
good badman movies. The Oklahoma Kid, and the
first
of the big Errol Flynn outdoor epics. Dodge City. Pro-
totype
of
all
the
honest-lawman-cleans-up-Sin-Town
Westerns
of
the
early
forties, Dodge
City was
bland,
simple
in
its
distinctions between good and
evil, and
full of big-scale, sprawling action, with an all-out stunt
saloon battle a special highlight.
It was filmed in super-
lative Technicolor and needed
it; later reissues in black
and white showed how much gloss and production value
the film had gained just from its color. It seemed to lose
scope and size in plain black and white.
Its follow-ups,
however, were shot in black and white, and the money
thus saved was put to better use with good scripting and
solid production values.
Virginia City, which co-starred
Flynn
with
Randolph
Scott
and
utilized
Humphrey
Bogart as a sneering but none too convincing Mexican
bandit, was slow
in getting itself started but more than
made up
for
this
in
its second
half. Even
better was
Santa Fe Trail, a more compact, better-written Western
dealing with John Brown's Kansas rebellion prior to the
Civil War. Flynn again starred, Raymond Massey was
Brown, and the climax was a well-staged reconstruction
of the battle at Harper's Ferry.
For
sheer
size, Warners
surpassed
themselves
with
their next and most expensive Flynn
epic. They Died
With Their Boots On, the story of General Custer. Al-
though
it directly contradicted Santa Fe Trail in several
key historical details,
it was a colorful cavalcade, one of
the very few Westerns to deal cohesively with the Civil
War,
its aftermath, and the gradually increasing warfare
between whites and Indians. Long, studded with name

with
Custer's

glories and his ultimate massacre at the Little Big Horn
as genuinely spectacular action highlights,
ii was never-
theless
a
rather
stiff and ponderous
film
for
all
of
its
care and generous budget.
It was the last of the Warner
spectaculars for a long time, their Westerns soon becom-
ing standardized products, and by the end of the forties,
often
mere
programmers
of
seventy
minutes

less,
vehicles
for
the now
slipping Errol Flynn and Dennis
Morgan. Throughout the
rest of the
forties,
their best
Westerns
fell
into
groups
other
than
historical
epics,
ahhough Flynn's San Antonio did produce a temporary
revival
of
the
old
flair,
with
a
beautifully
staged
(if
overwrought) mass gun battle
as
its climax.
The epics from other companies were variable. Co-
lumbia's Arizona brought Wesley Ruggles back to the
genre for the
first time since Cimarron.
Its attention to
detail
was
commendable,
the
reconstruction
of
old
Tucson
realistically
done, and some
of
the
scenes
of
mass
movement—the
Union
troops'
evacuation
of
Tucson,
for example—superbly organized. But
it was a
slow and tedious work, the footage devoted to the per-
sonal
stories
of
its somewhat
uninteresting
principals
swamping what should have been the dominant theme,
the
development
of
the
territory
of
Arizona.
Texas,
which followed, likewise played down
its epic potential,
but
at
least was
lively,
fast, and
full of rather refresh-
ingly
grisly black humor. Columbia was to make more

and more super-Westerns as the forties progressed, but
they were
all as standardized as
its "Bs." MGM's only
genuine epic of the forties was King Vidor's North West
Passage,
hardly
a
Western
in
the
traditional
sense,
though interesting in
its refusal to gloss over the horrors
of any kind
of warfare and
in removing the Seventh
Cavalry brand of glamor from
its grim Indian
fighting
scenes. MGM
(as
did RKO)
produced
a number
of
"pocket"
epics
with
James
Craig,
films
like
Gentle
Annie,
all
surprisingly weak and
uninteresting works.
Fox's huge success with Jesse James brought them back
to the western fold with a vengeance, but with a con-
centration on
outlaw
"biographies."
Fox's
best
tradi-
tional epic was
Fritz Lang's Western
Union,
in which
the historically uneventful construction of the telegraph
system was spiced up with Indian
raids, outlaw
inter-
vention, and a big forest fire. As in most Lang films, the
villainy was made
far more
interesting than
the
dull
heroics. Brigham Young was
a reasonably
reliable ac-
count
of
the Mormons' wagon
trek
to
Salt
Lake,
its
opening
sequences
of
religious
persecution
far more
dramatic and powerful than the later pilgrimage footage,
which contained
fine panoramic
vistas
of wagon
train
and
prairie
but
little
else.
William Wellman's
"biog-
raphy" of Bill Cody, Buffalo
Bill, included a well-done
battle
in
a
river between cavalrymen and Indians, but
otherwise was slow and
historically suspect. Fox,
too,
tended
to
let
its Westerns
slide
after the early
forties,
and,
aside from John
Ford's
superlative My
Darling
Clementine
drift
into
the
formula
pattern
of Fury
at
Furnace Creek.
With one notable exception, Paramount spent time,
money, big stars and good directors on
its
initial epics
of the forties, though with results even less satisfactory
than
those
achieved
in
the
thirties. But
the
film
that
fired the opening salvo
in their cycle was the particu-
larly inept Geronimo of late 1939, rushed into produc-
tion to cash in on the Indian warrior who had acquired
a new fame via Stagecoach. Geronimo was a fascinating
example of literally a million dollars' worth of produc-
tion
value
being squandered on
a mere programmer.
Every
foot
of major
action
material was
lifted bodily
from The Plainsman, The Texas Rangers, Wells Fargo
and even silents. The plot itself, complete even to much
of the dialogue, was a reworking of the 1933 Lives of a
Bengal Lancer. Nobody had the nerve to claim a story
credit for the melange, so
it was allocated to the direc-
tor, Paul Sloane, who probably deserved
it for his cun-
ning
in maneuvering around the old footage. The cast,
made up primarily of lesser Paramount contractees, was
notable mainly for being one of the few non-"B" films
to
give
Chief Thundercloud
any
kind
of
a
role
(he
played Geronimo) and for affording Gene Lockhart yet
another opportunity for cringing and whining as only he
knew how. Leading lady Ellen Drew, second in the long
cast, had what was surely one of the most non-taxing
roles in movie history. Given a word or two of dialogue
at the beginning of the film, she was promptly involved
in
a
stagecoach
wreck
lifted from
Wells
Fargo,
and
spent the
rest of the movie in bed and in a coma.
Paramount's
more
ambitious new
epics
were
less
stingy with
their budgets, but even
less productive
of
excitement. DeMille's North West Mounted Police was
a top-heavy, star-laden Technicolor vehicle that mean-
dered along endlessly, and
California,
a Ray Milland-
Barbara Stanwyck opus, was a dull, unofficial remake of
The Covered Wagon. Rangers of Fortune tried, futilely,
to repeat the formula of Three Godfathers, and putting
Paramount's hottest male star, Alan Ladd, into the West
didn't help
either.
Despite
a good
story and
cast,
his
Whispering Smith was
still
a bore, lacking
all
the ex-
pertise
that Paramount had been
able
to bring to
its
"B" products. The new version of The Virginian, with
Joel McCrea
efi'ectively
cast
in
the
old Gary Cooper
role, was also a slow and tame production. It had always
been
a
deliberately
slow-paced
tale,
but
at
least
the
1929
version had had
a
certain
integrity, and
a
real
sense
of
time,
place,
and
people. The new one had
pleasant Technicolor exteriors and nothing else. Eventu-
ally Paramount turned over much of
its Western sched-
ule
to
quickie
producers
Bill
Pine
and
Bill Thomas.
Their
Westerns
(El
Paso,
Albuquerque,
and
others)
were no great shakes either, but
at least they were un-
pretentious and delivered enough routine action to make
them commercially profitable.
Not a major success at the time, but one of the most
durable of the new Western cycle was Sam Goldwyn's
The Westerner of 1940. Although directed without any
marked
personal
style by William
Wyler,
it provided
Gary Cooper with one of his best roles and was a sober,
naturalistic,
beautifully photographed
film. Action was
handled
in a restrained, often almost deliberately awk-
ward
style,
never becoming a
slick stuntman's
circus.
However,
it was Walter Brennan's role as the famous—
or notorious—Judge Roy Bean that dominated the film
and much later became the basis of a television series.
Two of the most enjoyable epics came not from the
major studios at all, but from the independents. Repub-
lic's Man of Conquest
is
still the best movie biography
of Sam Houston and, John Wayne's grandiose budget
for
The Alamo
notwithstanding,
the
best
account
of
Texas'
fight
for
independence
against
the
forces
of
Mexico's Santa Ana. A shade too measured

its de-
tailing of Houston's two marriages and his relationship

it nevertheless made the devel-

other
similar movie had. Moreover,
it made the most
of its limited resources, and created by sheer excitement
that which
it could not afford to do by size. Its climactic
Battle of San Jacinto, staged by stunt maestros Reeves
Eason
and Yakima
Canutt,
was
relatively
brief and
small-scale,
yet
far more
vigorous
than
the
long-sus-
tained
battle
scenes
in
The Alamo.
Richard
Dix,
of
course, was a perfect choice for Houston.
Edward Small's Kit Carson was a second pleasingly
unpretentious epic of the period, although for director
George B.
Seitz
it was another flawed work. His silent
The
Vanishing American
for Paramount had had an
important theme,
stunning photography
of Monument
Valley
locations,
a
fascinating documentary prologue
detailing the history of the Indian, a dramatic opening
stressing the role of the Indian in World War
1, and his
right
to
full
citizenship
privileges-and
then
the
film
took
a cheapjack descent
into melodrama. Kit Carson
had many advantages-a good cast, fine locations, a solid
enough script with some above-average writing, in spite
of some
unnecessary
romantic
and comic
intrusions.
Unfortunately, the budget seemed to exhaust
itself just
when
it was needed most, and the film fizzes out lamely
at the end,
its final battle a mess of evasions, economies,
studio
sets, and back projection. But at least Seitz had
had his big Indian battle, which occurred at the midway
point. Beautifully shot and staged,
it was the best "tra-
ditional" Indian fight-hordes of warriors surrounding a
ring
of covered wagons—since The Big
Trail.
But
it was a concentration on the badman and a con-
certed attempt to whitewash such legendary outlaws as
Jesse James and the Daltons that really dominated the
big-scale Westerns of the early forties. Appropriately,
it
was Jesse James
in
1939
that gave
this branch of the
Western
its biggest boost. Although Jesse undoubtedly
was victimized by the railroads and their land-grabbing
agents, as were many other Missouri farmers, Nunnally
Johnson's screenplay nevertheless rather overdid the cir-
cumstances
that
forced him
into
outlawry.
In Tyrone
Power's hands, Jesse was
all warmth and nobility, with
none of the meanness and killer instinct that apparently
characterized the real Jesse. But regardless of its distor-
tions,
to say nothing of
its reshaping what must have
been a remarkable and dramatic life into standard Hol-
lywood scenario form, this Jesse James carried a lot of
incidental truth along with
it. Henry King was a director
singularly
at home with
the American scene, whether
history
or
rural
romance. He had gone
spectacularly
awry when tackling
biblical
spectacle or exotic adven-
ture, but with
his
feet firmly planted
in American
soil

Power, Henry Fonda; bank holdup sequence

and

interesting films
as
Tol'able
David,
The

and
The

of
the
background
milieu
of
Jesse James seems
exactly
right,
and Henry
Fonda's
performance
as Frank James
(a role he repeated
in
a
sequel
directed by
Fritz Lang)
is
quiet and
effective,
stealing
the thunder from Power not only because he
was a better actor, but because the role itself was more
thoughtfully conceived. Purely on the level of the West-
ern, Jesse James was too plodding, too generous in
its
footage to that shameless old barnstormer Henry Hull,
and surprisingly lacking
in a true sense of tragedy for
its climax, something that King brought off rather better
in
The
Gunfighter. But
the
Technicolor photography
was
exceptionally
fine,
there
was
a
first-rate
use
of
authentic outdoor locations with an absolute minimum
of studio "exteriors," the two big chase scenes were ex-
citingly done, and
there were some outstanding
stunt
scenes with horses—a charge through
a store window,
falls
in
a bank robbery sequence, and leaps from high
cliffs.
The Oklahoma Kid, which went into release almost
simultaneously, was generally far more to the liking of
the Western
traditionalists. Here was a big-scale West-
ern that never once allowed its size to create an aura of
self-importance.
It moved from
start
to
finish,
main-
tained
a
pleasant
tongue-in-cheek
approach
(which
made the occasional starkly tragic moments stand out in
even greater
relief), and was so much
in the
spirit of
the
silents
that
it even resorted frequently
to
titles
to
bridge
transitions. Cagney brought
his cheeky
big-city
personality
to
the West
without making
the
slightest
change
in
his
standard
characterization,
and
Bogart,
black-clad, twitching, as the wholly evil Whip McCord,
played
it completely straight, without even the mordant
sense
of humor
that he brought to
his gangster
roles.
Even with two such big names on hand, the climax was
the time-honored fistic set-to in the local saloon. James
Wong Howe's photography gave
the
film
visual
class
throughout,
and
even
if
unimportant
as
a
film, The
Oklahoma Kid
is notable
as one of the very few "A"
Westerns that was able to duplicate the speed and zip
of the "B."
The stream of outlaw movies that followed these two
far outnumbered the
historical
epics
that grew out
of
Stagecoach. MGM produced a Technicolor Billy the Kid
with
Robert Taylor
that,
except
for
a well-done
cli-
mactic chase, was a weak and totally re-written "adap-
tation" of the same book by Walter Noble Burns that
had formed
the
basis
of King Vidor's
film
a decade
earlier. The
renewed
popularity
of
the Western
also

deserved.
Wyoming opened with
a good
train
hold-up and closed with a well-done Indian attack, but
in between limped along with far too many sentimental
exchanges between Beery and Bobs Watson.
(Watson
was a moon-faced youngster whose specialty was instant
and non-stop blubbering; Dodge City earned the eternal
gratitude
of
sorely-tried moviegoers
of
the
forties by
allowing him one such crying marathon and then having
him killed off by Bruce Cabot's outlaws! ) Wyoming was
filmed
almost
entirely
on
location
against
majestic
mountain ranges and wide expanses of prairie, captured
in crystal-clear and well-composed images by Clyde de
Vinna, who had photographed the early McCoy West-
erns. But dramatically
it was
inferior to
its visuals,
al-
though at least the Beery personality was colorful. Later
in the forties, when Beery's larcenous heart was softened
by the wide eyes of Margaret O'Brien, the overdoses of
sentiment became
too much,
although
their Bad Bas-
comb did partially redeem
itself in an excellent climax.

tons. However, When the Daltons Rode was one of the
best of the outlaw cycle, well-directed by George Mar-
shall, and with some breathlessly exciting hold-up and
chase
sequences.
Its
script
tended
to
follow
formula
lines, and
its historical veracity was suspect, since
it had
the Daltons being wiped out to a man
in
its climactic
raid on
the
Coflfeyville bank—even though
the
film's
scenario was based on
a book by
a surviving Dalton!
Warners added a biography of the Younger Brothers to
the prevailing outlawry, and the "name" outlaws were
soon depleted. However, the genre remained a popular
one, and there were always
lesser miscreants
like Sam
Bass and the Sundance Kid to be unearthed. Just as the
horror
film,
to
boost
flagging box-ofhce
interest, was
teaming up the Frankenstein Monster, Dracula, and the
Wolf Man, so did the Western take to teaming up the
James Boys, the Daltons, the Youngers, Belle Starr, and
others
in
medium-budgeters
like Badmen's
Territory.
RKO made
something
of
a
specialty
of
these,
with
Randolph
Scott
the
overworked
marshal
striving
to
maintain
law
and
order
in
the
face
of such
all-star
banditry.
By 1942, the concentration on deluxe-scale Westerns
levelled
off, and
in
their place came
a steady flow of
Westerns that rated "A" playing time because of their
length and star casts, but were relatively unambitious in
theme. Some
of
these proved
to be among
the most
enjoyable Westerns of the forties. Universal's The Spoil-
ers, with
its unbeatable star combination of John Wayne,
Randolph
Scott, and Marlene
Dietrich, and with such
reliables
as
Richard
Barthelmess,
Harry
Carey,
and
William Farnum in support, is still the best of that (thus
far)
five-times-filmed actioner, with
its grand-scale
cli-
mactic fight a minor masterpiece of stunt action, skillful
doubling and
tight
editing,
if
a
lesser
masterpiece
of
realism. Any one of the blows struck in that fight would
have
felled an
ox,
so the staying power of Scott and
Wayne through a whole reel of such manhandling was a
little hard to take. RKO, too, turned out some excep-
tionally good Westerns
in
this
period, notably Robert
Wise's Blood on
the Moon
(still one of his best films
and one of the best scripted Westerns of the forties) and
Tall in the Saddle, a good John Wayne vehicle.
In a budgetary sense, a new kind of "B" Western was
evolving
in these years. Universal was making "in-be-
tween" Westerns of the calibre of Badlands of Dakota,
Men of Texas and Frontier Badmen-histonca\ Westerns
of minor epic stature that contained few real highlights
but moved constantly and made maximum use of studio
contract
players.
Their
slightly
increased budgets and
added lengths enabled them
to play

Harry
Sherman, producer of the Hopalong Cassidy Westerns,
also
produced
a
series
of
these
films
cleanly
photo-
graphed,
well
cast,
a
little slowly-paced but with
big-
scale action climaxes to compensate. Richard Dix starred
in
the
majority
of the Sherman
films, and one of the
best. Buckskin Frontier, was a model of how to make
a pocket Iron Horse and make
it look far more expen-
sive than
it was.

success
with
these

to make
some

the

marks, then certainly among the most satisfying West-
erns of the period.
As the
forties progressed, the
films
in the budgetary
classification
of Badlands of Dakota gradually needed
an extra ingredient to sustain their box-office value, and
so
color was added.
Universal and Columbia
in
par-
ticular increased their output of medium-budget eighty-
minute
color
Westerns
with
such
stars
as
Randolph
Scott, Rod Cameron
and George
Montgomery.
Uni-
versal evolved
a particularly pleasing format for these
films, and some, like Joel McCrea's Saddle Tramp were
exceptionally
good.
Begun
before
television
became
serious
commercial
competition
to
the
movies,
these
expensive-looking
Westerns
were
actually
fairly
eco-
nomical to make and also proved useful proving grounds
for the various new color systems of the forties—Cine-
color, Trucolor, Anscocolor. However, while the overall
quality
and
widespread
production
proved
to
be
an
effective
answer
to
the cheaper Western
fare seen on
television
in
that
medium's
earliest
days,
their
very
quality helped hasten
the demise
of the standard
six-
reel "B" Western.
At the beginning of the forties, the "B" Western, too,

benefitted from the resurgence of interest in the species.
It was
still possible to make "B"s economically and with
style. Republic was
at
its peak, not only producing the
Gene Autry, Roy Rogers and Three Mesquiteers series,
but
also
introducing new
stars
(Sunset Carson, Allan
Lane, Red Barry)
as
well
as
utilizing well-established
ones (Bob Livingston, Bill Elliott). Republic's Westerns
were
still essentially formula pictures, more action than
plot, but within
that formula they were expertly done
and made by some of the very best directors in the field:
Lesley
Selander,
William
Witney, John
English. And
since Republic
still had John Wayne for a series of big-
scale Westerns
(In Old Oklahoma, Dakota, The Angel
and the Badman),
it remained very much the leader in
the Western
field. Monogram, however, was improving
the quality of
its product considerably, most notably
in
the
excellent "Rough
Riders"
series
co-starring Buck
Jones, Tim McCoy and Raymond Hatton. Produced by
the
veteran
Scott
R.
Dunlap, whose Westerns
always
had
that
little extra polish and care that makes
all the
difference, the Rough Riders films placed more emphasis
on characterization than on
action, but they were un-
usually smoothly made, and
at
first
at
least,
willing to
spend
additional
money
for
such
added
touches
as
worthwhile
locations,
first-rate
utilization
of
camera
trucks
for
running
inserts,
and
the
creation
of new
musical
scores.
Jones, McCoy, and Hatton made one
of the best co-starring trios of any Western series, and
the
first
three
entries,
Arizona Bound,
The Gunman
from Bodie, and Forbidden Trails, were quite outstand-
ing. Thereafter, the usual Monogram policy of slashing
budgets and eliminating location work took its inevitable
toll, and
later
films
in
the
series were disappointingly
substandard,
although
the work
of the
three
stars
re-
mained enthusiastic and interesting. Jones' tragic death
in the Cocoanut Grove
fire brought the series to an end
after
its
first season.
However,
its success had spurred a number of imita-
tions,
most
notably
Monogram's
own
Trail
Blazers
series with Ken Maynard, Hoot Gibson, and Bob Steele.
These films were lamentably lacking in the finesse of the
Dunlap
predecessors;
their
production
values
were
crude,
their
scores, by Frank Sanucci,
repetitious and
(to be charitable)
unmelodic, and their stories merely
pegs on which to hang action. But they were fast and
deliberately designed to exploit spectacular stunt-work.
Although the publicity claimed that these veteran stars
were
still scorning doubles, the use of Cliff Lyons and
other stuntmen in the action scenes was often painfully
apparent. Maynard was by now rather clumsy, and his
delivery
of dialogue even more awkward,
but Gibson
had
maintained
a
relatively
slim
build,
a
naturalistic

acting
style, and his old sense of humor. Both he and
Maynard
still managed to do a goodly portion of their
own riding. (Use of doubles in Westerns
is, in any case,
not entirely
a matter of
ability. Expediency enters into
it,
too,
since
a second
unit can be shooting long shot
action scenes with doubles while the main unit shoots
the closeup and dialogue footage).
Monogram's
"Cisco
Kid"
series
started
off
rather
weakly with Duncan Renaldo, shifted profitably to Gil-
bert Roland, and under
the
sponsorship
of producer
Scott
Dunlap,
added
production
values
and
better
scripts. The Roland Cisco Kids had genuine charm, a
quality
rarely found
in "B" Westerns, and their poHsh
more
than made up
for
their
comparative
dearth of
action. Beauty and the Bandit was possibly the best of
this most enjoyable
series.
Jimmy
Wakely,
in
a
pedestrian
musical
Western
series, and Whip Wilson, in a so-so series, also appeared
on the Monogram schedules in the forties, but
its long-
est-running
series was
a Johnny Mack Brown group
designed to replace the Rough Riders. Some sixty-six of
them
were
made.
Small-scale,
often
sparse
in
action
content,
they
were
nevertheless
pleasing
little
films.
Raymond
Hatton
co-starred
in
the
majority
of them,
and
the
early
ones
clearly
inherited
several
unused
Rough
Riders
scripts.
Again, when
producer Dunlap
stepped
in to make a personal production or a special,
the
quality
rose
to
a marked
degree.
The Gentleman
from
Texas, produced by Dunlap and directed by vet-
eran Lambert
Hillyer, was quite the best of this series.
RKO continued to make the most expensive and pol-
ished "B"s. George O'Brien was
still turning out excep-
tionally good Westerns
in the early
forties, and
a Tim
Holt series, also of good quality, was started too. A brief
Zane Grey
series
ofl'ered Robert Mitchum
in two and
then James Warren in several. These were soon termi-
nated, but the Holt series continued
until
the
fifties.
Ownership
of
several
Zane
Grey
properties
also
prompted Fox to begin a fresh series of program West-
erns
in the forties. The
first, Riders of the Purple Sage,
was that rare animal, a remake superior to at least some
of
its predecessors.
In
less than an hour,
it packed
in
all of Grey's complicated
plot, managed to prevent the
unusually
large number
of characters from
getting
in
each
other's
way,
offered
plenty
of
action
and good
locations and photography.
It was a "class" film
all the
way,
lacking
only
the
finesse
of
background
music.

two Westerns, Sundown Jim and The Lone Star Ranger

little more than a disaster. The series was dropped.
Columbia
continued
to
grind
out
slick
but
strictly
formula Westerns, in the early forties doubling up their
stars so
that Charles
Starrett and Russell Hayden co-
starred
in
one
group,
Bill
Elliott
and Tex
Ritter
in
another.
Action
fans had no
complaints.
There were
often
five or six fights per picture and as many chases,
but not surprisingly there was
little time for plot. Also,
there was
a hurried, cheap look to their pictures. One
could always tell which company made a Western by the
sound effects, and Columbia's effects for gun-shots, fisti-
cuffs,
and
galloping
hooves had
a
cheap,
unrealistic
sound to them,
indicative of amplification or an encho
chamber. Throughout the forties, the quality of Colum-
bia's
Westerns
gradually
declined,
until Gene
Autry,
forming his own production outfit, came to work for the
studio. Autry's
first films for Columbia were vastly dif-
ferent from
his Republic format; the
plots were more
sober, the musical elements restrained, the action more
elaborate.
Not
surprisingly,
the
first
two,
The
Last
Roundup and Loaded Pistols, were excellent and among
the best "B" Westerns made anywhere, although their
extra length and budgets almost belied the "B" category.
In time Autry was forced to curtail his budgets and the
films became more
standardized, but he did maintain
good quality to the end. Columbia's final cheap Charles
Starrett entries seemed doubly poor in comparison with
the
Autrys.
PRC (Producers Releasing Corporation), a new com-
pany set up along the lines of Monogram, but making a
cheaper product, came into being
in the forties too.
It
attracted a large number of surprisingly good Western
stars such as Tim McCoy, Buster Crabbe, Bob Living-
ston,
and Bob
Steele, and some
lesser
ones:
George
Houston, Tex Ritter, James Newill, Dave O'Brien, Bill
Boyd
(a radio singer, not the Hopalong Cassidy star).
Lash LaRue, and Eddie Dean. While some of the
first
McCoy
and
Crabbe
Westerns
were
quite
good,
the
studio's output
as
a whole was shoddy,
their Westerns
fast but totally lacking in any kind of polish. The exploi-
tation of Cinecolor gave some of their Eddie Deans a
superficial edge over the others, but Dean was not popu-
lar and his films eventually reverted to black and white.
A New York Daily News
critic was not impressed by
one of his later works and was moved to remark: "Eddie
Dean's
latest
is
in black and white
rather than
color,
but the improvement
is hardly noticeable; you can
still
see him."
Universal, like Republic, was concerned more with a
fast action format than with
plot, an attitude rather

odds with
its former approach
to the Buck Jones and
Ken Maynard films.
Its Johnny Mack Brown series (in-
itially
co-starring Bob
Baker,
then
presenting Brown
solo, and concluding with
a group
in which he starred
with Tex Ritter) evolved an ultra-streamlined approach
in
which
directors
like Ray
Taylor, Ford Beebe, and
Lewis
D.
Collins slammed over
the
fights and chases
with tremendous gusto. Universal
built up an excellent
library of chase and agitato music, and made a fine art
of
the
running
insert.
Nell
O'Day, who
appeared
in
many of the Brown Westerns, was a
fine stunt rider, a
big asset to the
series, and a pleasant change from the
usual passive heroine. Although excellent entertainment
for dyed-in-the-wool
fans,
the sameness
of
this
series
was pointed up when a really imaginative director was
put
to work on one
of them.
Joseph
L.
Lewis, who
directed Arizona Cyclone, was a former film editor, and
it showed. He broke down
a simple confrontation be-
tween
hero and
villain
into
a number
of tense
shots,
cross-cut between hands poised over holsters, changed
focus within the shots, and added speed and depth to his
chase scenes by placing objects
(trees, fences) between
his camera truck and the riders, or by having his truck
on
a
different ground
level from
the
horses. Arizona
Cyclone was a perfect example of how to add real style
and
directorial
finesse
without
radically changing
the
script.
But
it
is
unlikely
that
his
efforts brought
in
a
nickel more than the prosaic and workmanlike methods
of
Lewis
D.
Collins.
Johnny Mack Brown's
likeable
personality,
pleasant
acting
style, and genuine
athletic
ability were also major assets of the series. He used far
fewer doubles than most
stars
in
his
fights and
leaps.
Universal's
final
groups
of "B"
Westerns,
with Rod
Cameron, Eddie Dew, and Kirby Grant, were much in-
ferior
to
the Browns.
By the end of the forties, the "B" Western scenes had
changed considerably. Independent Westerns had all but
disappeared. Many
of
the former
top-line
stars were
either dead or in retirement. The quantity of "B" West-
erns had been seriously curtailed. Groups of eight had
been
cut
to
groups
of
six, many
series
discontinued
entirely, and thanks to the ever-rising costs of produc-
tion,
it was impossible
to maintain the former level of
quality.
The
Hopalong
Cassidy
Westerns
that Harry
Sherman had made for United Artists in the early forties
were
polished,
actionful,
well peopled with extras and
respectable character actors, shot in good locations and
in good Western street and ranch
sets, were now being
produced
by
William
Boyd
himself,
with
slim
plots,
meagre action, a dearth of people and livestock, and the
skimpiest of
sets. Even the "look" of the "B" Western
had changed:
the
glossy,
sunlit photography
that had
characterized the Republics
less than ten years
earlier
had been replaced by drab, often ill-lit camerawork, shot
regardless
of
overcast
skies
and
apparently
photo-
graphed
(or processed) on much coarser film stock.
It
was
definitely
the
beginning
of
the end
for
the "B"
Western.
Meanwhile,
the "A" Western was proliferating, and
becoming
increasingly
thoughtful.
William
Wellman's
The Ox Bow Incident was a powerful and uncompro-
mising indictment
of lynch law, marred somewhat by
the forties method of shooting so much within the studio
(although
this
did
give
it the
controlled
lighting
that
such a theme needed)
and by a
script that sometimes
amplified the suggestion and understatement of the orig-
inal novel unnecessarily. The post-war cycle of psycho-
logical melodramas, although primarily exploited by the
big-city
crime
film,
invaded
the West
tentatively
but
interestingly in such films as John Sturges', Captured and
Raoul Walsh's Pursued, the latter a film that emulated
Hitchcock's
Spellbound
in
incorporating
nightmarish
dream sequences into
its story of chase and vengeance.
Another Walsh
film, Colorado
Territory,
an
excellent
and underrated Western, was a remake of and a close
parallel lo his earlier Bogart gangster film. High Sierra,
its tragic ending dovetailing neatly into the fashionable
defeatism
that marked
so many
psychological
melo-
dramas of the
late
forties.
1946 saw John Ford for the first time since his silent
days at Universal and Fox returning to the Western on
a
regular
basis. My
Darling
Clementine, made some
seven years
after Stagecoach, was easily one of Ford's
best Westerns,
its simplicity and beauty weakened only
by
an
untypical and
excessive number of closeups
of
Linda Darnell. (Ford was never fond of big head close-
ups, especially of his leading ladies, and usually elimi-
nated them even when the scripts called for them.) My
Darling Clementine
is quite certainly the best of
all the
Wyatt
Earp
films.
Without
minimizing
the
need
for
"artistic freedom" or suggesting that the fiery Ford ever
really kowtowed
to
the
front
office,
it
is
a matter
of
obvious record that his best single group of pictures was
that made
for
20th
Century-Fox
between
1939
and
1946,
a group bounded by Young Mr. Lincoln
at one
end and My Darling Clementine at the other
(both of
them Henry Fonda films, incidentally) with How Green
Was My
Valley, The Grapes of Wrath, and others
in
between. The common denominator of all of these films
is
discipline. The
all
look and sound
like John Ford
films;
his favorite people and musical themes are ever-
present, and whether they were photographed by Joe
MacDonald
or
Arthur
Miller
they
all
have
the same
visual flow that marks a Ford picture. But somehow

of his
virtues are concentrated and
utilized to the
full,
his weaknesses—an
unrestrained
sentimentality,
a pen-
chant for rowdy comedy—either diluted or kept severely
in check. With My Darling Clementine Ford was back
to the Western permanently; he would make three more
in the forties, more
still in the fifties and sixties.
The
notoriety
of Howard
Hughes'
The Outlaw
(a
slow film, often an inept one, but by no means as bad a
Western as
it is generally reputed to be) gained a further
foothold for sex in the West, and King Vidor's Duel in
the Sun was a natural successor. Forcibly expanded by
producer Selznick into another would-be Gone With the
Wind,
it was literally too big and imbalanced a film for
its own good. The genuinely epic
qualities of the
tale
were reduced
to background
details against which the
personal and largely sexual adventures of the three pro-
tagonists were played out. Nevertheless,
its mass action
scenes
(particularly
a gathering of the
ranchers,
to be
confronted by a railroad gang and a troop of cavalry)
were
beautifully organized and
shot,
its
sexual scenes
had
both
a raw power
and
an
erotic
flavor
entirely
missing from The Outlaw, and
its use of color was dy-
namic and daring. Intimate scenes such as the death of
Lillian
Gish and
the impending execution
of Herbert
Marshall showed Vidor
at his best. And Jennifer Jones
was never better photographed, and never exuded more
sheer animal sexuality than
as Pearl. A sweeping box-
office success, Duel in the Sun was reviewed scornfully
and
sarcastically,
and
not
taken
seriously.
For
that
matter,
even
Ford's My
Darling
Clementine
was
re-
ceived very coolly.

As far as the critics were concerned, there were only
two major Westerns with artistic integrity in the forties:
Ford's
Stagecoach
(even
though
technically
a
1939
film) and Howard Hawks' Red River in
1948. United
Artists, distributors of the latter film, built
its whole ad
campaign around
its (presumed) reception as a classic.
"In 30
years, only three—The Covered Wagon—Stage-
coach—and Red River" was the pitch used
in advertis-
ing. Although a big critical and commercial success, the
film
was
(comparatively
speaking)
forgotten
rather
quickly
perhaps
because,
on
the
surface
at
least,
it
seemed
to have nothing fresh to say and to be merely
an
expert
retravelling
of
old
and
familiar
trails. The
sudden
cult
interest
in
director Hawks
some
fifteen
years
later caused Red River
to be
re-acclaimed,
re-
appraised, and certainly over-analyzed. Hawks' films are
complex in their character interrelationships and even in
the
thematic
relationship
of one
film
to
another,
but
such an intellectual approach to Red River seems espe-
cially
unjustified when one considers that
it was con-
ceived
as
a
variation on and an
unofficial remake
of
Mutiny on the Bounty.
It has long been an old dodge to
remake non-Westerns as horse operas (Gunga Din into
Sergeants
Three,
The Sea
Wolf
into
Barricade)
and
Red
River
is
an
especially
adroit
re-working
of
the
earlier film, with the same conflict between the two men,
the same floggings, the same mutiny—and cattle substi-
tuting
for
breadfruit
trees. Hawks
has
never seemed
quite enough of a sentimentalist to be as at home with
the Western as he was with the gangster film (Scarface)
or the crackling satire (His Girl Friday). He deliberately
plays down
physical
action,
keeping
it
secondary
to
human
conflicts, and
his Westerns, Red River
in par-
ticular, are far more
in the anti-romanticist tradition of
The Covered Wagon than
in that of the warm,
afTec-
tionate
idylls of John Ford. And of course, no criticism
is
implied
in
this,
there
is
certainly
room
for
both
traditions.
In
1948,
however,
because
it was
the
"milestone"
Western
of
the
decade, Red River,
far from
writing
"finis"
to the Western, did nevertheless seem to imply
that the Western had
little more to say. Yet how wrong
such an assumption would be. Less than two years away
were two Westerns, Broken Arrow and The Gunfighter,
which would not only
set new standards
of maturity,
honesty and compassion but would launch new cycles
along hitherto untravelled tangents. And waiting
in the
wings were
the technological innovations
of the wide-
screen and three-dimensional processes to mirror chang-
ing content
in a changing screen shape.

THE FIFTIES m AMD RADICAL CHAKGES
The year 1950 started the new decade
oflf with a bang.
The gradual
decline and disappearance of the beloved
"B" Western seemed
hardly
to
matter
in
the
face
of
three
of the
finest "A" Westerns Hollywood had ever
produced: John Ford's The Wagonmaster, Henry King's
The
Gunfighter,
and
Delmer
Daves'
Broken
Arrow.
While
the
Indian
had
certainly
been
treated
sympa-
thetically
in several
films of the forties, and most espe-
cially
in John Ford's beautiful, sentimental
(but rather
uneventful
)
She Wore
a
Yellow Ribbon, no
film had
been
really
unreservedly
pro-Indian.
Broken
Arrow,
while
it may have been prompted by the controversial
but commercially successful race problem
(Jewish and
Negro)
films
of
the
forties, managed
the
rare movie
trick
of making a social comment without overloading
the
scales. The side
issues of Broken Arrow were rap-
idly commercialized
to the
hilt:
it established Cochise
(little
exploited
in such
earlier Westerns
as
Valley of
the Sun)
as
a
"regular"
horse opera
hero, prompted
sequels,
established
a
pattern
by
which
big
male
stars
(Burt
Lancaster,
Robert Taylor, Rock Hudson,
ultimately
even
Elvis
Presley)
could
profitably
play
Indians, ushered in a whole new era of villainous whites
(including General
Custer!)
and misunderstood Noble
Redmen, and finally prompted a long-running TV series,
with
all the attendant merchandising of bows and arrows
and Indian
outfits
for the kiddies.
Its controlled docu-
mentary qualities were also copied shamelessly by many

lesser Westerns. But the original film was good enough
to survive even this subsequent exploitation;
it was and
is
a warm,
poignant,
often
poetic
film. Delmer Daves
has always been an
interesting and underrated writer-
director, and there
is
little doubt that Broken Arrow
is
his best film. Even James Stewart's mannered playing
is
held reasonably in check. Pictorially
it
is often stunning,
and the gentle beauty of some of the courtship scenes,
and especially the simplicity of composition of the wed-
ding night scene—white horse, brown
tepee, blue skies
and a scene
that has the good sense to fade before
it
can be fully absorbed—are some of the loveliest images
any Western has ever given us.
If one cavils at
all,
it
is
at
the compromise ending.
Racial
barriers being what
they
were
in
1950,
an
"important"
white
star
still
couldn't be allowed
to marry an
Indian
girl and
live
happily ever after. One of them had to meet an untimely
end which could be twisted to symbolic purpose, and
it
invariably proved to be the hapless Indian
girl,
as wit-
ness also William Wellman's deeply felt but badly muti-
lated Across the Wide Missouri. In 1957, a much lesser
Western, Samuel
Fuller's Run of the Arrow, did allow
such a union to survive. Had censorship been advanced
by a few years, or Broken Arrow delayed for those same
number of years,
it might well have been the best, most
honest and definitive movie on the Indian problem. As
it
is.
it
is merely the best.
Many of the Westerns of this type were directed by
veterans like George Sherman, graduates of "B" horse
operas, and men who
really knew how to keep
their
films on the move. One major new name to come to the
fore in this period was that of Bud Boetticher, director
of some of the best Audie Murphy films, but who estab-
lished
his
most
notable
relationship
with
Randolph
Scott in a series of Westerns for Columbia and Warner
Brothers:
The
Tall
T,
Seven Men
from
Now,
and
others. Without sacrificing any of the traditional action
elements, there was somehow an extra dimension to the
Boetticher
Westerns;
they had
a
biting,
underplayed
quality, the kind of films one would have expected had
John Huston (in his prime) suddenly decided to become
a
director
of Westerns. The French
critics picked up
Boetticher's
work
first,
and
their
American
second-
stringers chorused their approval
at second-hand. This
is not to minimize the merit of his films, merely to stress
that there was a great deal of luck in his critical success.
His films happened to come at a time when that budget-
ary
classification
of Western was
getting a wider play
and
receiving
the
benefit
of press shows
and
critical
attention. A few years
earlier,
with
the same kind
of
exposure, the films of Lesley Selander might also have
received serious critical coverage.

John
Ford's The Wagonmaster, made
after two big
Indian-Cavalry epics, was clearly a
"little" picture that
he
wanted
to
do,
and which
allowed him
his
usual
breathing period.
It was a minor, very personal film that
didn't have
to top the
big ones
that had preceded
it.
This was a policy that he followed as often as he could,
and these commercially minor films often turned out to
be among
his
best.
The
Wagonmaster was
a
simple,
poetic,
apotheosis
of
Ford.
Alan
Mowbray's
Shake-
spearean ham
returned from My Darling Clementine,
the Clantons from that film turned up too, this time
in
the
persons
of
an
outlaw who
was
also
a
religious
fanatic, and his brood of half-wit sons; Joanne Dru and
Ben
Johnson
(one
of
Ford's
best
and
most
likeable
heroes ) were reincarnations of Wayne and Trevor from
Stagecoach,
and Ward
Bond,
Jane
Darwell,
Francis
Ford
(as
another
lovable
wreck
of
a
drunk),
Jim
Thorpe, and Harry Carey,
Jr., also repeated traditional
roles.
It
is
a
lovely,
leisurely movie,
full of a romanti-
cized
reincarnation
of the
pioneer
spirit,
all
beautiful
images and
stirring
ballads.
Photographically,
it
is ex-
tremely
simple. The camera moves only once or twice
in the entire film, and never when a lesser director would
have made
it move
to
underline
a
shot.
Ford
even
resists the temptation to track his camera in the breath-
taking
twilight
shots
of
the women
wearily marching
along in the dust behind their wagons. They come—and
go—while
the camera remains
static and
the
audience
stays a spectator to the march of history, not a partici-
pant in
it. (Of course, when Ford wants to involve his
audience emotionally or dramatically, as in Stagecoach,
he knows just how to do
it. But The Wagonmaster was
a
fond,
nostalgic look backward.
It was
all
that Ford
wanted, and an emotional involvement, or the omnipres-
ence of a Hollywood camera crew as suggested by elabo-
rate tracking shots, would have spoiled that viewpoint.)
The
casually
misused
label
"adult
Western"
is
of
course
an
almost meaningless one. There have always
been adult Westerns. Too often the phrase, or
its sub-
stitute, "psychological Western," are convenient escape
hatches when by accident a Western turns out to have
none of the ingredients deemed necessary to make
it a
popular
success.
Television's constant
use
of the term
has made
it
especially empty. But
if any .films can be
considered to have instituted trends in "adult" Westerns,
then they are two related films of the early
fifties: The
Gunfighter from
1950, and High Noon from two years
later. By far the better of the two films. The Gunfighter
enjoyed only moderate
critical and public success, and
was so misunderstood and underrated by
its distributors
that
it was sold
as a regluar action Western,

cunningly pulling together
its sparse elements of action,
slapping on a blood and thunder musical score (the film
itself is almost devoid of music, and effectively so), and
generally making
it look
like any one
of
a thousand
other Westerns. In The Gunfighter and
its many follow-
ups, with the theme of a young hoodlum out to make
his reputation by
killing a wanted man, sympathy has
always been with the older outlaw (whose crimes have
taken place before the start of the film) and never with
the younger would-be gunfighter, who
is invariably de-
picted
as
sadistic and
maladjusted. While
this
white-
washes
the
older
outlaw,
especially
as he
is
also pre-
sented
as
a man
weary
of
killing,
aware
that he
is
doomed,
at the same time violence for glory's sake and
the taking of the law into one's own hands are heartily
condemned. But
in essence, one
is asked to sympathize
with a
killer, and to reject a man whose actions,
if not
his motives, will benefit society!
It
is to the film's credit
that one never quite realizes this
until long afterwards.
Beautifully acted and designed
(there
is just the
right,
but
not
overdone,
hopeless droop
to Gregory
Peck's
moustache),
literate
in
its writing,
incisive
in
its bursts
of action, and superbly photographed by Arthur Miller
(carefully avoiding the romantic warmth of his films for
John
Ford), The Gunfighter
creates such
a mood
of
inexorable Greek Tragedy
that no
matter how many
times one sees
it, one
is always hoping subconsciously
for that accidental change of circumstance or timing that
will bring about a happy ending. The false and romanti-
cized fadeout shot excepted. The Gunfighter
is a major
classic among Western movies.
High Noon, which has usurped so much of the repu-
tation
and
innovational
credit
that
rightly
belongs
to
King's film, was parlayed into a huge box-office success
partly because
it
is,
within
limits,
a very good movie,
partly
because
of the
exploitation
value
of
its theme
song
(a
much
less
common
film-plugging
gimmick
then),
and
largely
because
it
brought
an
Academy
Award-winning comeback
to
its
popular
hero,
Gary
Cooper, who had been wasted in unimportant films for
several
years.
Historians
of
the West
dislike
the
film
because
they
insist
that
in
essential
details
it
is
false,
and that the ballad especially
is both an
artifice and an
anachronism. Critics tended to be misled, giving far too
much credit to producer Kramer (whose achievements
have
never matched
his
intentions) and director Fred
Zinneman
(never
really
at home with such thoroughly
American subjects), too
little to star Cooper and editor
Elmo
Williams. However,
its twin themes
of civic
re-
sponsibility
in a crisis and latent courage in non-heroic
citizens
(even
if
rather
negatively and
pessimistically
presented here ) soon became absorbed into such subse-

quent Westerns
as At Gunpoint, and were rapidly
ac-
cepted as "new" cliches.
Its pessimistic commentary on
citizenry's
attitude towards non-involvement proved
to
be
sadly
prophetic
in
purely contemporary terms—al-
though
in the Westerns themselves one often
felt sorry
for
the
outlaws,
suddenly
beset
by
an outnumbering
group of petty, vengeful townspeople!
The
proverbial
"shot
in
the arm"
that High Noon
provided the Western was followed up less than a year
later with a booster shot in Shane. While clearly
it
is a
milestone film,
if not a permanent classic,
it
is a film of
diminishing returns and each viewing tends to leave one
liking
it a
little less. (Perhaps
it should be stressed that
this
is not a generally held viewpoint.)
Preceded by a
reputation
that
classed
it
as
a white
elephant,
a pro-
duction that had gone spectacularly overboard in budget
and shooting schedules,
it rapidly proceeded to
startle
Paramount by achieving both
critical acclaim and box-
ofhce blockbuster
stature.
After the onslaught
of psy-
chological, introspective Westerns that sought to cash in
on
the success of High Noon,
it was
a refreshing and
classic return to the themes of man vs. man and man vs.
nature
in
the
building of the West. With
its stunning
color
photography
of
the Grand
Tetons
location,
its
"class"
production,
its
cast,
and
sufficient
action
to
satisfy
those who
didn't
care
about
"class,"
it
could
hardly miss,
it had the misfortune to go into release in
the midst of the nation-wide conversion to wide screens.
George
Stevens'
meticulously composed
frames were
hacked and elongated in order that Shane might open at
the Radio City Music Hall
as a totally up-to-date pro-
duction and be sold subsequently
as a wide-screen
at-
traction.
Even
this
boomeranged
to
the
film's
favor,
enlisting the support and sympathy of movie purists (a
term not used scornfully
) who otherwise might not have
been concerned. Yet
it
is a film that makes
its greatest
impact the
first time around—unless, of course, one has
only seen
it on television,
in which case the vistas that
suddenly
unfurl on a large theatre screen and in color
make
a second viewing a genuine
revelation. Much of
it
holds
up
extremely
well
as
film;
the
photography
obviously,
the
attention
to
detail,
the
realism
of
the
simple sets, the ritualistic sadism of Jack Palance's killer,
the astounding impact of the shooting of Elisha Cook, Jr.
After seeing good guys and bad guys by the thousand
crumpling comfortably into the dust through thirty years
of "B"
Westerns,
this
sudden
confrontation
with
the
physical
force
of
death
comes
as
quite
a
shock,
as
Stevens
rightly
intended. But the
film
as
a
total
entity
now no longer seems to have the strength of these indi-
vidual components, and the wonder
is that its flaws were
not
apparent
long
ago.

Ladd from decline and made him a star again, his per-
formance
is
still the weakest
in the film when
it should
be
the
strongest,
nor
is he
helped by
a
pretty buck-
skin costume which lacks the dramatic showmanship of
Palance's costume
or
the
unvarnished
realism
of
the
farmers' clothing. Victor Young's score
is melodic and
easy
to
remember,
but
it
is
incurably
romantic
and
parallel
scenes
in
this
film and The Gunfighter work
much
better
in
the
latter
without
musical
backing.
And for
all of the use of landscape and superb loca-
tions,
all that
is achieved
is an effect of men dwarfed by
nature or at war with
it. The sense of man's relationship
to the land—an inherent part of almost any John Ford
Western— is
almost
totally
lacking, though
there
is an
acknowledgment of the need for that relationship in the
sequence of the uprooting of the tree stump. Perhaps, in
essence, this (personal) dissatisfaction with Shane today
boils down to the difference between Ford and Stevens.
Stevens
is
a meticulous craftsman:
he pre-plans, plans
again, experiments,
discards, shoots endlessly, amasses
miles
of footage,
until he has achieved a kind of me-
chanical perfection (and there
is certainly an
art and a
skill
in
that too)
and
then,
in
the time
that
it would
take Ford to shoot two cavalry epics,
sits down to cut
it
to a preconceived mathematical pattern. The
first time
one sees
it (and admittedly, buffs apart, films are really
designed to be seen but once)
its perfection takes one's
breath away. But thereafter one notices more and more
the
coldness, the lack of the warmth
that comes from
the unplanned
"bit of business" dreamed up spontane-
ously. Ford often
likes to slow his Westerns down and
just mark time while he experiments with a specific act
or movement:
Fonda
as Wyatt Earp
in My
Darling
Clementine, sitting on a chair on the veranda, balancing
himself by moving his
feet,
is
a typical example. This
"extraneous" warmth and spontaneity
is what makes the
Ford
Westerns,
for
all
their
occasional
crudities,
so
durable.
Stagecoach
and My
Darling
Clementine
get
better with each viewing; Shane, alas, does not, and
it
is
perhaps no coincidence
that Shane's best performance
comes from Ford protege and player Ben Johnson.
While the deluxe Western of the early fifties was obvi-
ously
in
fine shape, both
artistically and commercially,
the lot of the humble "B" was far less happy. They were
costing more and more to make—and were proving less
and less profitable. In the thirties, a decent "B" Western
could
be made
for
$20,000
or
less. Now
they
were
costing $50,000—and even holding to that price meant
such corner-cutting that the
resultant
quality was low.
Action was cheaply staged, and borrowed as much foot-

age from
earlier Westerns
as
possible. Even
a
single
stunt
in an Allan Lane Western
at Republic might be
compiled from
as many as three
different sources:
an
establishing scene from
a Three
Mesquiteers Western
perhaps. Gene Autry or John Wayne supplying the next
vital
bit of action, Allan Lane cut in via a studio-filmed
insert, and yet another star
in a fourth bit of action to
wind
it up! Matching and continuity were hardly taken
into consideration, and the bigger action sequences were
re-used
so
frequently
that even
the
uninitiated
recog-
nized them instantly. Newly filmed action became ultra-
standardized. The old-time outlaw gang had now shrunk
to a mere three riders; running inserts were always shot
on the same stretches of road and cut
in regardless of
the other locales in use; studio "exteriors" got skimpier,
with
a few papier-mache
rocks,
a bush
or
two, and
much back-projection substituting for decent art-direc-
tion. In order to minimize the number of camera set-ups
and speed production, dialogue scenes were shot in long
uninterrupted
takes, without change
of
angle, camera
position,
or
interpolated
close-ups
to
add
variety
or
dramatic emphasis. RKO Radio
did
maintain
a
high
standard to the end with
its Tim Holt
series, but they
had to pay for
it in uneconomical budgets that went far
beyond even the $50,000 mark. Even in the face of this
depression,
a few new series were started, and
in their
initial enthusiasm, offered lively and well above-average
Westerns.
Republic's Rex Allen
series
benefitted from
Allen's own likeable personality, and expert direction by
William Witney, who put astonishing vigor into West-
erns
like The Last Musketeer through sheer pace and
free
use
of
the
mobile
camera
trucks
in
his
chase
sequences.
At a time when most Westerns were cutting down on
action content, the Rex Aliens were to be commended
for
going
all-out
in
their
staging
of
imaginative
and
expensive
action sequences. Monogram,
in the process
of changing
itself into Allied Artists and concentrating
on a higher-bracket product,
also started an
intelligent
and
interesting new
series with
Bill
Elliott. The Long-
horn, Kansas
Territory,
Waco, and Fargo provided
a
very satisfying mixture of good action and good scripts,
while Topeka (like the others with a story very much in
the Bill Hart vein) went suddenly berserk with the mov-

for a week without a third feature being added
as a "preview." (The preview was often
a thirty-year-
old Ken Maynard Western!) Eventually there was noth-
ing left to play, and, rather appropriately,
its final West-
ern was Gene Autry's Last of the Pony Riders. The last
regular "B" Western series to go into production was a
good Wayne Morris group for Allied Artists; when the
last of those, Two Guns and a Badge, went into release
in mid- 1954, the
series Western was dead for good.
Those of us who had grown up on "B" Westerns had
often,
as children,
indulged
in masochistic fantasies
in
which we dreamed that one day, they would be no more.
We never really believed that such a dreadful day could
ever dawn,
for
if
it did, there would be nothing
left to
live
for. But when that doomsday came (even allowing
for the fact that we were by then much older)
it wasn't
such an impossible thing to live with. Most of our older
favorites had
died
or gone
into
retirement, and
it
re-
quired no excess of fortitude to say farewell to a Lash
LaRue or a Monte Hale. The
last of the "B"s were so
poor
in
quality
that
it was
almost
better
to have no
Westerns at all than such pale shadows of former glories.
Charles Starrett's "Durango Kid" Westerns at Columbia
were being shot
in three days,
all stock footage, cheap
sets
and
time-consuming
low
comedy. The
fact
that
many
of
the
stars-William
Boyd, Gene
Autry, Roy
Rogers, Rex Allen-had switched to television was but
minor compensation. Although
they
varied
in
quality,
these TV
Westerns,
too,
were
generally
substandard.
Autry maintained the highest standards, not only
in his
own Westerns but
in the others that his company pro-
duced, most notably
the
actionful Range Rider
series
starring that remarkable stuntman Jock Mahoney. But
even these new-style "B"s were to have but a short life-
span before they gave way to the equally standardized
but
more
talky
and
more
"adult"
series
like
Gun-
smoke.
Certainly these were far more elaborately pro-
duced
than
the
cheap
half-hour
shows;
The
Lone
Ranger, for example, had been done almost entirely on
cramped
studio
sets,
with
the same
stock
riding and
exterior scenes cut
in once or twice per episode.
Through
the
years,
the
big-scale
television
series
Western, graduating to color, name stars, and very occa-
sionally a director of John Ford's stature, improved their
scripts
and
their
production
values,
and worked
up
popular formats,
but no
series ever produced
a
single
episode to match a My Darling Clementine or a Gun-
fighter. MGM made a rather amusing spoof of the whole
television-Western
furor,
titled Callaway Went Thatta-
way.
It zeroed in with some accuracy on the mechanics
214

of
merchandising
toy
guns,
hats
and
other cowboy
accessories,
and
was
rather
more
honest
than
most
Hollywood
satires, perhaps because
it was
satirizing a
competitor rather than itself. Nevertheless,
it didn't quite
have the courage of
its own convictions, and
after the
"End"
title came a further long
title explaining that
it
had all been in fun, and that no disrespect was intended
to the many cowboy stars who had for so long exhibited
civic
awareness,
social
responsibility,
and
charitable
generosity. This added a further touch of irony,
since
the cowboy stars who really lived up to their responsi-
bilities were rare indeed. Buck Jones was a major ex-
ception,
but
to many
of them making Westerns was
purely and simply a lucrative business, and at least one
Republic Western
star of the
forties and
fifties was so
commercially minded, and so consistently egotistical and
unpleasant to work with that he was universally hated
by all of his directors and co-workers. (Which is doubt-
less why, unlike Rex Allen, Roy Rogers, and others, his
employment since the cessation of his starring series has
been almost
nil!)
But
if
the "B"
Westerns, bad
as
they
were,
were
missed, there was some consolation not only
in the in-
creased number of "A" Westerns, but also
in the way
in which they were more and more catering to the action
requirements of dyed-in-the-wool Western addicts. Uni-
versal worked out an especially satisfying formula: their
eighty-minute "A" programmers not only had the star
value and the Technicolor production values to enable
them
to appeal
to general
audiences, but they had
all
the
slick,
fast
action
of the vanishing "B"s. The Man
from
the Alamo
(1953),
a Glenn Ford
vehicle, had
some
especially
polished
stunt work
staged and
per-
formed by David
Sharpe, and
in terms
of speed and
(literally)
cliff-hanger action, compared favorably with
the best of Republic.
Allied Artists, which had started to make big-budget
Westerns in the very late forties with two excellent Rod
Cameron vehicles. Panhandle and Stampede, maintained
an
interesting
schedule through
the
fifties
too. For
a
medium-budget
job,
another Rod Cameron
film, Fort
Osage, was
quite
exceptional:
fast,
neat,
well photo-
graphed
in Cinecolor and
full of well-staged action,
all
in some
seventy
minutes. Shotgun and Cow Country
were two other well-above-average Allied Artists West-
erns of this period.
Other
than
for
the
borrowing
of
the
High Noon
themes, there were no specific trends during the
fifties.
A tentative return to the whitewashed badman vehicles
never really got past the medium-budget Westerns like
A I Jennings of Oklahoma. Jennings, one of the
last of
Outlaw
Treasure
(United

The
Tall Stranger (Allied
Artists,
1957):
Virginia Mayo,
Michael Ansara
the old-time badmen, had himself turned to making two-
reel Westerns when he was pardoned
in the mid-silent
period.
Despite being an
authentic badman, he
rather
conspicuously modelled his screen image
after William
S. Hart, though his films did contain
a certain amount
of documentary value
in showing the day-to-day living
pattern of outlaws on the run and the kind of farm and
mountain people that befriended them. Columbia's ver-
sion
of
his
life,
however,
followed
the
usual
movie
pattern: Jennings had been a minor and somewhat inept
train
robber, and
physically was something of a
runt.
Al Jennings of Oklahoma almost doubled his size to that
of Dan Duryea and
gave
his
outlawry
the crusading
stature
of
a
Jesse James! The renewed
activity
in the
outlaw-biography soon dwindled down to the "B" level,
however. While no more
series Westerns were made,
sporadic "B" Westerns continued to be produced on an
individual basis, but usually with color, a minor "name"
star, or some exploitation gimmick by which they could
gain
at
least
a number
of "A"-time
playdates.
The
outlaw
vehicle,
liberally spaced with violence and
sex,
proved a useful, though short-lived, type of film
in this
area, via such cheap and tawdry films as Outlaw Women
and The Daltons' Women.
Boosting the already large numbers of "A" Westerns
being turned
out
in
the
fifties were
the
technological
changes affecting the movie industry at that time. Three-
dimensional films and CinemaScope offered new possi-
bilities to the Western; shooting a Western
in Cinema-
Scope did not materially increase its budget, but did give
it
a
superficially
spectacular
aura. 3-D brought added
excitement to
fight scenes, added depth
to chases, but
the
gimmicks,
such
as
flaming
arrows
shot
"at"
the
audience, soon became over-familiar. CinemaScope
al-
lowed
for
greater
exploitation
of landscape and
pan-
oramic vistas, although only White Feather
( 1955) took
full advantage of this. The good Westerns were usually
good in spite of the new processes, not because of them,
and many, like Hondo (1953), which were shot in 3-D,

Gunfight at the OK Corral (Paramount,

Gunfight at the OK Corral: Kirk
Douglas and Burt Lancaster as Doc
Holiday and Wyatt Earp
were actually released in flat versions. Hondo was prob-
ably
the
best John Wayne
vehicle not made by John
Ford, and together with Ford's The Searchers, stood out
among the scores of "A" Westerns produced during the
fifties. In terms of quantity, the
fifties represented some
kind of highpoint for the sustained production of "A"
Westerns. Top directors—King Vidor, John Ford, Robert
Wise, Jacques Tourneur, Henry Hathaway, Henry King,
John Sturges—turned to the Western regularly, while the
reigning "name" stars—Gregory Peck, William Holden,
Ray
Milland,
Cornel
Wilde,
Jeff
Chandler,
Tyrone
Power, Kirk Douglas,
Burt Lancaster—made Westerns
now
as
a
matter
of course,
not
as
a kind
of
interim
novelty.
The end of the fifties could nowhere match the begin-
ning
in terms of really
first-class Westerns, although
in
1958 the veteran Henry Hathaway did come up with a
beauty in From Hell to Texas. By 1958, the great boom
in "A" Westerns had begun to diminish. William Wyler's

Country stole most of the year's thunder. From Hell to
Texas, with a cast of minor names and a title that sug-
gested
a much
cheaper kind
of
picture, was
unfortu-
nately lost in the shuffle. This was a pity, for
it was not
only one
of
the few Westerns
to
really
use
the wide
CinemaScope screen creatively, but
it was probably also
the best Western between Ford's The Wagonmaster and
Sam
Peckinpah's
1962
Ride
the High
Country. The
reasons
for
its success are hard
to pin down,
since so
many
factors
are
involved. The
script
certainly
is
a
literate and
off-beat
one, coming up
with
all
the
ex-
pected
action
while
at the same time avoiding cliched
characters and situations. Even the badmen,
as vicious
a family as we had seen on the screen since the Clantons

(My Darling Clementine) and the Cleggs (The Wagon-
master),
act
with
a certain
logic and
justification, and
aren't villains
in the usual sense. Don Murray was par-
ticularly
felicitously
cast
in
the lead—the kind
of
role
that Audie Murphy was always looking for in his Uni-
versal
Westerns
and
never
quite
finding—while
Chill
Wills,
usually
given
his head by
the Johns Ford and
Wayne to the detriment of the pictures involved,
is not
obnoxious here and" even quietly
effective
at times.
Perhaps the biggest surprise of
all was that director
Hathaway could come up with so different a film. Despite
the
mysticism
of
his
one
really
off-beat
work,
Peter
Ibbetson, Hathaway has always been a straightforward
director of the old school, brought up in the thirties on
such
films
as Lives of a Bengal Lancer and the Zane
Grey
series, continuing
into the
fifties and
sixties with
North
to Alaska and
Five Card Stud.
His one major
foray
into
"serious" Westerns was
in Tyrone Power's
Rawhide, an interesting "mood" and suspense Western
of the early
fifties.
His
films have
usually been
refreshing and
simple,
strong on action and visuals, uncluttered by psychology.
But
in From Hell to Texas he seems to have combined
the sentiment and
austerity
of Hart and
the
slickness
and spectacle of Ford. The film has some magnificent out-
door locations—ramshackle towns and
single
buildings
rising starkly out of the dust—that rival those of Shane.
No decade
that began
with The
Gunfighter and The
Wagonmaster and ended with From Hell to Texas can
offer much cause for complaint!

THE sixties: WESTERNS,
WESTERNS EVERYWHERE,BUT,..
As
these
final
notes
are
written,
it
is
sobering,
if not
downright
depressing,
to
realize
that
a
mere
seven
months remain of the sixties, and the entire decade has
given us only one truly outstanding Western—Sam Peck-
inpah's Ride the High Country—and that
at the begin-
ning of the
sixties. Westerns
in general have tended to
stress the age
of their protagonists,
partly
for comedy
purposes, but largely from necessity, since many of the
bigger Western "names" have aged, and in order to use
a sixty-year-old star with some logic, that age has had
to be reflected in their story-lines. Ride the High Country
took Randolph Scott and Joel McCrea (whose physical
appearances
actually
stilP belied the
infirmities that the
script
attributed
to them)
as two veteran
misfits
in
a
changing and more lawful West, one trying to perform
an honest job with
dignity, the other out to make one
last haul
in order to retire with a measure of comfort.
The
story had
a number
of
interesting
sub-plots and
characters and an earthy but
tasteful approach
to sex.
Its
strength,
however,
lay
in
the
sincere
and moving
portrayals of
its stars, and
in the beauty and poignancy
of
its
final scene wherein McCrea dies quietly and with
the dignity he had sought, as he sinks out of the frame
the camera panning over to the rugged Western skyline,
emphasizing once more
this man's
affinity to the land.
Ride
the High Country was
not only one
of the best
Westerns
of
the
sixties, but one of the
best from any
period. There are those who claim that
its success was

almost
a
fluke,
in no way
attributable
to
its
director,
Sam Peckinpah, who was not given sole control over
its
shooting or editing. And
it
is true that Peckinpah's sub-
sequent
career
has
been
a
matter
of
interesting and
unusual misfires, films which have never approached the
stature of Ride the High Country. But
it hardly matters
who created its beauty and power; whoever individually
or collectively was responsible for
it,
it has become the
best and only truly representative Western of the sixties.
The same year (1962) saw another commendably
off-
beat Western
in Lonely Are the Brave,
in which
old-
time non-conformist and small-time outlaw Kirk Douglas
finds
his freedom and
his whole way
of
life menaced
first by
fences and
then by modern
technological
en-
croachments.
It was an interesting if not wholly success-
ful effort, but seemed pretentious and forced in the face
of
the
simplicity
and
naturalistic
quality
of Ride
the
High
Country.
John
Ford,
older,
tired,
continued
to make
good
Westerns right through the
sixties, but much of the old
spirit was gone. He became lazy
(if a working director
in
his 70's can be called "lazy"),
less of a perfectionist
One Eyed Jacks (Paramount,
1963), directed by and
starring
Marlon Brando
in
his
visuals, and
shot
too much
of
his
films
in
the
studio. Nevertheless, his sincerely felt Cheyenne Autumn
(despite
being
badly
and
inconsistently
cut
prior
to
release) would make a graceful and appropriate adieu
to the Western film for this old warrior,
if indeed
it does
prove to be his
final horse opera.
The more ambitious the Western of the
sixties,
the
more
spectacularly
it
seemed
to
fail.
John
Wayne's
personally directed The Alamo was an overwrought and
certainly over-long bore, and Cinerama's How the West
Was Won, far from being the "definitive" Western
it set
out
to be, was merely a
superficial
circus, notable
for
its fine locations, superb photography, and exciting stunt
action
sequences,
but somehow
never
achieving even
conviction,
let alone poetry or the genuine epic stature
it
sought. The most enjoyable Westerns of the
sixties
tended
to be those
that aimed
at being nothing more
than serviceable star vehicles—Howard Hawks' Eldorado
with
John
Wayne,
for
example.
Westerns
generally
seemed
to be
taking
themselves
less
seriously,
to be
playing
themselves
tongue-in-cheek.
This mood
was
accelerated by the unexpected success of Cat Ballou,
a
Jane Fonda vehicle that was such a misfire that
it was
considered a disaster until someone had the bright idea
of a "camp" approach and a selling campaign based on
the idea of
its being a "put-on" of all Westerns, an idea
that—despite the
film's occasional good sight-gags—had
not been
the
intention when
it was made.
Its success
prompted even more levity in the Western, extending to
1969's heavy-handed Support Your Local Sheriff with
James Garner.
But
if this tendency to take the Western far less seri-
ously
was
not
very
successful,
at
least
it
was more
enjoyable than
the
short-lived
efforts
to
take
it
over-
seriously. To enjoy a belated "cult" popularity because
of its director (Arthur Penn) and star (Paul Newman),
1958's The Left-Handed Gun, a Billy the Kid saga, intro-
duced both "method" acting and Broadway stage direc-
torial
styles
to
the
West.
Undoubtedly
the most
pre-
tentious and pseudo-poetic Westerns ever made,
it even
seemed
to borrow
semi-surrealistic imagery from Luis
Bufiuel
at
times!
While
there
certainly
should
be no
rules
concerning new
approaches
to
the
Western,
it
seems
unlikely
tl|at
chi-chi
theatrics
like
this can ever,
work.
If there
is ever to be "new blood" in the Western,
it
is more likely to come from established directors who
have as yet never ventured into the genre: Orson Welles,
Alfred
Hitchcock,
Stanley
Kubrick.
Kubrick,
signifi-
cantly," was
fired from One Eyed Jacks before
it was
prf^perly under way. Star Marlon Brando took over as
director, turning
it into a superbly locationed and pho-
tographed,
but
unbearably
mannered
and
ponderous
229

film. Quite incidentally, all newer Westerns have suffered
to
a
degree from
a
surfeit
of Broadway
actors. Most
of our old
familiar
friends: badmen Fred Kohler and
Harry Woods, reliable, granite-jawed sheriff Jack Rock-
well; the heroine's father, morally strong but physically
feeble Lloyd Ingraham
or Edward Le
Saint; have
all
gone
now.
Type-cast
they may
have
been,
but
their
faces merged naturally with Hollywood's West. We knew
them and accepted them, and
their mere presence im-
230
How the West Was Won (Cinerama,

Hathaway, George Marshall and John Ford

parted a kind of instant realism which the newer breed
of character actors cannot duplicate.
Another
minor
development,
worth
mentioning
in
passing,
is
the very
recent exploitation of the Western
scene by
the makers of the fast-buck "nudie" movies.
Lowering
of

in

opened
up
a

ing outdoor locations (cutting down studio costs) and a
logical reason for color, also provided plenty of oppor-
tunities for sex (rape, nude swims) and violence
(ritual
and
revenge
rape,
hangings,
whippings).
1969's The
Bushwackers was only one of several such Westerns to
run this gamut; during the same year, the "underground"
cinema also discovered the West, Andy Warhol's Lone-
some Cowboys adding degeneracy and artistic vacuity in
the name
of "experimental"
film. However,
these cul-
tural affronts can never be considered a serious or major
part of the mainstream of the Western.
The one dominant trend of the sixties was the sudden
commercial
and
artistic
popularity
of
the
European-
made Western. Europe, and
specifically Germany, had
always made a modicum of home-grown Westerns, and
in the thirties and forties Hans Albers, Germany's Clark
Gable,
cavorted
Teutonically
in
several
local
horse
operas. Spectacularly rising production costs in the fifties
and
sixties, however, made
it economically sound
for
Hollywood to begin shooting
its own Westerns in Euro-
pean locales, but this minor trend was soon taken over
by the Germans and the Italians, who began to specialize
in their own full-blooded Westerns, taking every Holly-
wood
cliche
seriously,
enlarging on them, and adding
liberal doses of sex and violence. The hybrids that
re-
sulted were mixed breeds indeed. The Italian A
Fistful
of Dollars was
a careful and precise remake
of Kuro-
sawa's Samurai film Yojimbo, which
itself was a delib-
erate
attempt
to
adapt
the
style and
visuals
of John
Ford's Westerns to the Japanese idiom. So popular did
the European Westerns become
that Hollywood began
setting up co-production deals and sending its own stars
over, and finally— as in MGM's Hang 'Em High, a Clint
Eastwood vehicle—shooting Westerns on
its own home
ground
again,
but
in
the new
terse,
violent,
pseudo-
realistic
style made popular by
the
Italians. The Ger-
mans, on the other hand,
falling back 'on the works of
their own
Karl May— a homegrown
James Fenimore
Cooper—embarked on
a
series
of elaborate color
spe-
cials,
all very much in the Hollywood style of the twen-
ties,
simplified but undeniably spectacular and
full
of
mass action. Since these genuinely large-scale films could
be made for a fraction of the cost of Hollywood West-
erns,
they made
it increasingly
difficult
for the Holly-
wood producer to turn out saleable products that could
compete with them
in
the open market.
Nevertheless,
the
Western was
too
ingrained
a part
of Hollywood
tradition for
it ever to be abandoned. John Wayne went
on grinding out inexpensive but solid actioners like The
War
Wagon,
while
an
enterprising
independent
pro-
ducer, Alex Gordon, in films like The Bounty Killer and
Requiem for a Gunfighter, performed yeoman service to

Steele,
Buster
Crabbe, Johnny Mack Brown, Rod Cameron and even
the
venerable Broncho
Billy
Anderson, whose
bright
eyes
and
striking
profile had weathered
almost
seven
decades!
The
credits and plots alone of the
last Westerns of
the
sixties
reflect
the changes
that have been
taking
place. Once Upon a Time in the West presents the erst-
while Wyatt Earp and Frank James, Henry Fonda, as a
lecherous
badman,
and
is
directed
by
Italy's
Serge
Leone. Paint Your Wagon features a heroine with the
thoroughly "mod"
idea
of maintaining two husbands
and an unorthodox male lead in Lee Marvin.
Undoubtedly the most acclaimed, criticized, and cer-
tainly the most controversial Western of the decade was
1969's The Wild Bunch—curiously enough, directed by
Sam Peckinpah, who started the
sixties
off so promis-
ingly with Ride the High Country. Much of The Wild
Bunch
is Peckinpah at his best; the reconstruction of a
period,
the
attention
to
realistic
detail,
the boisterous
and bawdy comedy
(without the
slapstick excesses of
John
Ford),
the wry
and
sad commentary on men,
good and bad, who in their own way helped to build a
West that
is now passing them by. But The Wild Bunch
also became a kind of paean to violence, and neither the
pious pronouncements of
its
stars and
director that
it
had to depict violence graphically in order to condemn
it, nor the unquestioned
virtuosity of
its pictorial
style
(slaughter scenes and moments of excessively detailed
blood-letting presented in slow-motion to create an effect
of choreography and ritual) could really counteract or
justify the effect of revulsion and nausea that
it created.
Inevitably,
violence has always been
present
in the
Western in the form of
its standard action content, but
rarely as little more than a charade. In the "B" Westerns
men could be dragged by
horses,
beaten
senseless
in
fistfights, and shot full of holes, all without a murmur of
pain and without a drop of blood showing. Perhaps the
high spot of this kind of bloodless brutality was reached
in Wyoming Hurricane, a Columbia "B" of 1944. In
it,
hero Russell Hayden subdues villain Paul Sutton after a
furious
fistic set-to. Neither has a mark on him. Sutton
won't
give
Hayden
the
information
he
needs.
With
markedly unsportsmanlike behavior for a "B" Western
hero, Hayden proceeds to shoot his unarmed opponent
in an effort to make him talk. After three bullets in the
left
arm,
none
of them
productive
of

the
fact
that one arm
is riddled with
bullets, although
this may well have something to do with his ultimately
losing the
battle. Even for a "B" Western, this kind of
stamina and disregard
of the most elementary realism
was
a
bit extreme; but
in
its obsession with violence
and
in
the shock
tactics employed, The
Wild Bunch
takes the same kind of charade to the opposite extreme,
making it a Western equivalent of those Hammer Frank-
enstein films in which eyeballs and dismembered limbs
are used not to frighten
( a difficult feat even for a gifted
director)
but merely to
revolt
(the
easiest and
laziest
accomplishment of all).
Yet much of the traditionalist approach remains. One of
the more interesting Westerns of 1969, True Grit, pre-
sents John Wayne—with makeup and costuming that em-
phasize rather than minimize his years—as an ageing dep-
uty marshal. Based on a novel that was a sixties' best-
seller,
its opening hour suffers from a possibly too rigid
adherence to its source material. Although the Arkansas
1880 pjeriod is well and accurately recreated, there
is too
great an emphasis on "characters," most of them played
by method-oriented stage actors with both eyes on the
1970 "Best Supporting Actor" Academy Award. The
novel's heroine, Mattie Ross, may have read well, but

in the person of mannered and aggressive actress Kim
Darby
she,
in the current vernacular, comes on much
too strong, and
is forever reminding one of a 1938 Judy
Garland looking for an excuse to sing. Fortunately, the
second hour of the film switches to
its manhunt theme,
and maestros Henry Hathaway and John Wayne take
over, pushing her (though not quite
far enough)
into
the background where she belongs.
Beautifully photo-
graphed
in breathtaking California and Colorado loca-
tions. True Grit has only one
brief studio
"exterior,"
and
while
its
action
content
is
limited
to
the
closing
reels,
it
is
sharp,
vicious
(admittedly,
unnecessarily
bloody
at
times), and
expertly
staged.
Unexpectedly,
Wayne,
playing some
scenes
for
pure comedy,
does
some of his best acting in any non-John Ford Western.
One scene
in which he half humorously, yet half wist-
fully, describes
his
brief married
life and the son who
didn't like him, reveals a subtlety and an honest warmth
in Wayne
that has
rarely been displayed before. True
Grit
will probably be
far
less acclaimed
that the pre-
tentious and derivative Will Penny (which couldn't have
existed at
all had
it not been for The Wagonmaster and
Shane),
but
is
a much
better
picture.
It would
also
make as perfect and graceful a farewell to the Western
for Wayne
as
Ride
the High
Country had been
for
McCrea and Scott; an ideal climax to an almost forty-
year career that had begun with The Big Trail. But with
Gary Cooper gone, Wayne has not only become Holly-
wood's Western figurehead, but he
is
also
still a box-
office giant. Obviously he will go on making Westerns
for as long as his expanding girth can stride a saddle.
One can only hope that when he does decide to hang up
his boots
(if not
his
political guns!)
it will be with
a
vehicle
as sympathetic and
felicitous
as True
Grit.
