Preface
The purpose of this book is to provide an introduction to principles of 
probability, random variables, and random processes and their applications.
The book is designed for students in various disciplines of engineering, 
science, mathematics, and management. It may be used as a textbook and/or as 
a supplement to all current comparable texts. It should also be useful to those 
interested in the field for self-study. The book combines the advantages of both 
the textbook and the so-called review book. It provides the textual explanations 
of the textbook, and in the direct way characteristic of the review book, it gives 
hundreds of completely solved problems that use essential theory and 
techniques. Moreover, the solved problems are an integral part of the text. The 
background required to study the book is one year of calculus, elementary 
differential equations, matrix analysis, and some signal and system theory, 
including Fourier transforms.
I wish to thank Dr. Gordon Silverman for his invaluable suggestions and 
critical review of the manuscript. I also wish to express my appreciation to the 
editorial staff of the McGraw-Hill Schaum Series for their care, cooperation, 
and attention devoted to the preparation of the book. Finally, I thank my wife, 
Daisy, for her patience and encouragement.

Chapter 1 
Probability 
1.1 INTRODUCTION 
The study of probability stems from the analysis of certain games of chance, and it has found 
applications in most branches of science and engineering. In this chapter the basic concepts of prob- 
ability theory are presented. 
1.2 SAMPLE SPACE AND EVENTS 
A. Random Experiments: 
In the study of probability, any process of observation is referred to as an experiment. The results 
of an observation are called the outcomes of the experiment. An experiment is called a random experi- 
ment if its outcome cannot be predicted. Typical examples of a random experiment are the roll of a 
die, the toss of a coin, drawing a card from a deck, or selecting a message signal for transmission from 
several messages. 
B. Sample Space: 
The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment is called the sample space (or universal 
set), and it is denoted by S. An element in S is called a sample point. Each outcome of a random 
experiment corresponds to a sample point. 
EXAMPLE 1.1 Find the sample space for the experiment of tossing a coin (a) once and (b) twice. 
(a) There are two possible outcomes, heads or tails. Thus 
S = {H, T) 
where H and T represent head and tail, respectively. 
(b) There are four possible outcomes. They are pairs of heads and tails. Thus 
S = (HH, HT, TH, TT) 
EXAMPLE 1.2 Find the sample space for the experiment of tossing a coin repeatedly and of counting the number 
of tosses required until the first head appears. 
Clearly all possible outcomes for this experiment are the terms of the sequence 1,2,3, . . . . Thus 
s = (1, 2, 3, . . .) 
Note that there are an infinite number of outcomes. 
EXAMPLE 1.3 Find the sample space for the experiment of measuring (in hours) the lifetime of a transistor. 
Clearly all possible outcomes are all nonnegative real numbers. That is, 
S = ( z : O < z < o o }  
where z  represents the life of a transistor in hours. 
Note that any particular experiment can often have many different sample spaces depending on the observ- 
ation of interest (Probs. 1.1 and 1.2). A sample space S is said to be discrete if it consists of a finite number of 

PROBABILITY 
[CHAP 1 
sample points (as in Example 1.1) or countably infinite sample points (as in Example 1.2). A set is called countable 
if its elements can be placed in a one-to-one correspondence with the positive integers. A sample space S is said 
to be continuous if the sample points constitute a continuum (as in Example 1.3). 
C. Events: 
Since we have identified a sample space S as the set of all possible outcomes of a random experi- 
ment, we will review some set notations in the following. 
If C is an element of S (or belongs to S), then we write 
If S is not an element of S (or does not belong to S), then we write 
u s  
A set A is called a subset of B, denoted by 
A c B  
if every element of A is also an element of B. Any subset of the sample space S is called an event. A 
sample point of S is often referred to as an elementary event. Note that the sample space S is the 
subset of itself, that is, S c S. Since S is the set of all possible outcomes, it is often called the certain 
event. 
EXAMPLE 1.4 Consider the experiment of Example 1.2. Let A be the event that the number of tosses required 
until the first head appears is even. Let B be the event that the number of tosses required until the first head 
appears is odd. Let C be the event that the number of tosses required until the first head appears is less than 5. 
Express events A, B, and C. 
1.3 ALGEBRA OF SETS 
A. Set Operations: 
I. Equality: 
Two sets A and B are equal, denoted A = B, if and only if A c B and B c A. 
2. Complementation : 
Suppose A c S. The complement of set A, denoted A, is the set containing all elements in S but 
not in A. 
A= {C: C: E Sand $ A) 
3. Union: 
The union of sets A and B, denoted A u B, is the set containing all elements in either A or B or 
both. 
4. Intersection: 
The intersection of sets A and B, denoted A n B, is the set containing all elements in both A 
and B. 

CHAP. 1) 
PROBABILITY 
The set containing no element is called the null set, denoted 0. Note that 
6. Disjoint Sets: 
Two sets A and B are called disjoint or mutually exclusive if they contain no common element, 
that is, if A n B = 0. 
The definitions of the union and intersection of two sets can be extended to any finite number of 
sets as follows: 
n 
U A ~ = A ,  
u A , U . . - U  A, 
i =  1 
= ([: [ E  A l  or [ E  AZ or . - -  E A,) 
= (5: 5 E Al and 5 E A, and 
5 E A,) 
Note that these definitions can be extended to an infinite number of sets: 
In our definition of event, we state that every subset of S is an event, including S and the null set 
0. 
Then 
S = the certain event 
@ = the impossible event 
If A and B are events in S, then 
2 = the event that A did not occur 
A u B = the event that either A or B or both occurred 
A n B = the event that both A and B occurred 
Similarly, if A,, A,, . . . , A, are a sequence of events in S, then 
n U A, = the event that at least one of the A, occurred; 
i =  1 
n n Ai = the event that all of the A, occurred. 
i =  1 
B. Venn Diagram: 
A graphical representation that is very useful for illustrating set operation is the Venn diagram. 
For instance, in the three Venn diagrams shown in Fig. 1-1, the shaded areas represent, respectively, 
the events A u B, A n B, and A. The Venn diagram in Fig.. 1-2 indicates that B c A and the event 
A n B is shown as the shaded area.

C. Identities: 
By the above set definitions or reference to Fig. 1-1, we obtain the following identities: 
S = @  
B = s  
J = A  
The union and intersection operations also satisfy the following laws: 
Commutative Laws: 
Associative Laws: 

CHAP. 11 
Distributive Laws: 
PROBABILITY 
De Morgan's Laws: 
These relations are verified by showing that any element that is contained in the set on the left side of 
the equality sign is also contained in the set on the right side, and vice versa. One way of showing this 
is by means of a Venn diagram (Prob. 1.13). The distributive laws can be extended as follows: 
Similarly, De Morgan's laws also can be extended as follows (Prob. 1.17): 
1.4 THE NOTION AND AXIOMS OF PROBABILITY 
An assignment of real numbers to the events defined in a sample space S is known as the prob- 
ability measure. Consider a random experiment with a sample space S, and let A be a particular event 
defined in S. 
A. Relative Frequency Definition: 
Suppose that the random experiment is repeated n times. If event A occurs n(A) times, then the 
probability of event A, denoted P(A), is defined as 
where n(A)/n is called the relative frequency of event A. Note that this limit may not exist, and in 
addition, there are many situations in which the concepts of repeatability may not be valid. It is clear 
that for any event A, the relative frequency of A will have the following properties: 
1. 0 5 n(A)/n I 1, where n(A)/n = 0 if A occurs in none of the n repeated trials and n(A)/n = 1 if A 
occurs in all of the n repeated trials. 
2. If A and B are mutually exclusive events, then 

and 
PROBABILITY 
[CHAP 1 
B. Axiomatic Definition: 
Let S be a finite sample space and A be an event in S. Then in the axiomatic definition, the 
, probability P(A) of the event A is a real number assigned to A which satisfies the following three 
axioms : 
Axiom 1 : P(A) 2 0 
(1.21) 
Axiom 2: P(S) = 1 
(1.22) 
Axiom 3: P(A u B) = P(A) + P(B) 
if A n B = 0 
(1.23) 
If the sample space S is not finite, then axiom 3 must be modified as follows: 
Axiom 3': If A,, A,, . . . is an infinite sequence of mutually exclusive events in S (Ai n Aj = 0 
for i # j), then 
These axioms satisfy our intuitive notion of probability measure obtained from the notion of relative 
frequency. 
C. Elementary Properties of Probability: 
By using the above axioms, the following useful properties of probability can be obtained: 
6. If A,, A,, . . . , A, are n arbitrary events in S, then 
- ... (-1)"-'P(A1 n A, n - - . n  
A,) 
(1.30) 
where the sum of the second term is over all distinct pairs of events, that of the third term is over 
all distinct triples of events, and so forth. 
7. If A,, A,, . . . , A, is a finite sequence of mutually exclusive events in S (Ai n Aj = 0 
for i # j), 
then 
and a similar equality holds for any subcollection of the events. 
Note that property 4 can be easily derived from axiom 2 and property 3. Since A c S, we have 

CHAP. 11 
PROBABILITY 
Thus, combining with axiom 1, we obtain 
0 < P(A) 5 1 
Property 5 implies that 
P(A u B) I 
P(A) + P(B) 
since P(A n B) 2 0 by axiom 1. 
1.5 EQUALLY LIKELY EVENTS 
A. Finite Sample Space: 
Consider a finite sample space S with n finite elements 
where ti's are elementary events. Let P(ci) = pi. Then 
3. If A = u &, where I is a collection of subscripts, then 
i f 1  
B. Equally Likely Events: 
When all elementary events (5, (i = 1,2, . . . , n) are equally likely, that is, 
p1 = p 2  = " * -  - Pn 
then from Eq. (1.35), we have 
and 
where n(A) is the number of outcomes belonging to event A and n is the number of sample points 
in S. 
1.6 CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY 
A. Definition : 
The conditional probability of an event A given event B, denoted by P(A I B), is defined as 
where P(A n B) is the joint probability of A and B. Similarly, 

8 
PROBABILITY 
[CHAP 1 
is the conditional probability of an event B given event A. From Eqs. (1.39) and (1.40), we have 
P(A n B) = P(A I B)P(B) = P(B I A)P(A) 
(1 .41 ) 
Equation (1 .dl) is often quite useful in computing the joint probability of events. 
B. Bayes' Rule: 
From Eq. (1.41) we can obtain the following Bayes' rule: 
1.7 TOTAL PROBABILITY 
The events A,, A,, . . . , A, are called mutually exclusive and exhaustive if 
n U Ai = A, u A, u 
v A, = S 
and 
A, n Aj = @ 
i # j 
i =  1 
Let B be any event in S. Then 
which is known as the total probability of event B (Prob. 1.47). Let A = Ai in Eq. (1.42); then, using 
Eq. (1.44), we obtain 
Note that the terms on the right-hand side are all conditioned on events Ai, while the term on the left 
is conditioned on B. Equation (1.45) is sometimes referred to as Bayes' theorem. 
1.8 INDEPENDENT EVENTS 
Two events A and B are said to be (statistically) independent if and only if 
It follows immediately that if A and B are independent, then by Eqs. (1.39) and (1.40), 
P(A I B) = P(A) 
and 
P(B I A) = P(B) 
(1.47) 
If two events A and B are independent, then it can be shown that A and B are also independent; that 
is (Prob. 1.53), 
Then 
Thus, if A is independent of B, then the probability of A's occurrence is unchanged by information as 
to whether or not B has occurred. Three events A, B, C are said to be independent if and only if 
(1 SO) 

CHAP. 11 
PROBABILITY 
We may also extend the definition of independence to more than three events. The events A,, A,, . . . , 
A, are independent if and only if for every subset (A,,, A,, , . . . , A,,) (2 5 k 5 n) of these events, 
P(Ail n A,, n . . n Aik) = P(Ai1)P(Ai,) 
P(Aik) 
(1.51) 
Finally, we define an infinite set of events to be independent if and only if every finite subset of these 
events is independent. 
To distinguish between the mutual exclusiveness (or disjointness) and independence of a collec- 
tion of events we summarize as follows: 
1. If (A,, i = 1,2, . . . , n} is a sequence of mutually exclusive events, then 
P( i) A,) = 
P(AJ 
i =  1 
i =  1 
2. If {A,, i = 1,2, . . . , n) is a sequence of independent events, then 
and a similar equality holds for any subcollection of the events.

How many events are there in a sample space S with n elementary events? 
Let S = {s,, s,, . . . , s,). Let Q be the family of all subsets of S. (a is sometimes referred to as the power 
set of S.) Let Si be the set consisting of two statements, that is, 
Si = (Yes, the si is in; No, the s, is not in) 
Then Cl can be represented as the Cartesian product

Since each subset of S can be uniquely characterized by an element in the above Cartesian product, we 
obtain the number of elements in Q by 
n(Q) = n(S,)n(S,) - - . n(S,) = 2"

From Fig. 1-5(a), we see that there is a closed path between a and b only if all switches s,, s,, and s,

From Fig. 1-5(b), we see that there is a closed path between a and b if at least one switch is closed. 
Thus,

From Fig. 1-5(c), we see that there is a closed path between a and b if s, and either s, or s, are closed. 
Thus, 
A,, = A, n (A, v A,) 
Using the distributive law (1.12), we have 
A,, = (A1 n A,) u (A, n A,) 
which indicates that there is a closed path between a and b if s, and s, or s, and s, are closed. 
From Fig. 1-5(d), we see that there is a closed path between a and b if either s, and s, are closed or s,

Then by the definition of intersection, s E B. Therefore, A c B. 
"Only if" part : We show that if A c B, then A n B = A. Note that from the definition of the intersec-

it follows that A c (A n B). Hence, A = A n B. This completes the proof.

From Eq. (1 Z), we have

defective. Plant 2 produces 2,000 parts, 150 of which are defective. A part is selected at random 
and found to be defective. What is the probability that it came from plant 1 ? 
Let B be the event that "the part selected is defective," and let A be the event that "the part selected 
came from plant 1." Then A n B is the event that the item selected is defective and came from plant 1. 
Since a part is selected at random, we assume equally likely events, and using Eq. (1.38), we have

From the given statistics, we have

(a) From Eq. (1.64) (Prob. 1.23), we have 
P(A) = P(A n B) + P(A n B) 
Since A and B are independent, using Eqs. (1.46) and (1 .B), we obtain 
P(A n B) = P(A) - P(A n B) = P(A) - P(A)P(B)

Thus, by definition (l.46), A and B are independent. 
(b) Interchanging A and B in Eq. (1.84), we obtain 
P(B n 3

Hence, the probability that at least 1  success occurs in the first n trials is 1 - (1 - p)".

2.1 INTRODUCTION 
In this chapter, the concept of a random variable is introduced. The main purpose of using a 
random variable is so that we can define certain probability functions that make it both convenient 
and easy to compute the probabilities of various events. 
2.2 RANDOM VARIABLES 
A. Definitions: 
Consider a random experiment with sample space S. A random variable X(c) is a single-valued 
real function that assigns a real number called the value of X([) to each sample point [ of S. Often, we 
use a single letter X for this function in place of X(5) and use r.v. to denote the random variable. 
Note that the terminology used here is traditional. Clearly a random variable is not a variable at 
all in the usual sense, and it is a function. 
The sample space S is termed the domain of the r.v. X, and the collection of all numbers [values 
of X([)] is termed the range of the r.v. X. Thus the range of X is a certain subset of the set of all real 
numbers (Fig. 2-1). 
Note that two or more different sample points might give the same value of X(0, but two differ- 
ent numbers in the range cannot be assigned to the same sample point.

EXAMPLE 2.1 In the experiment of tossing a coin once (Example 1.1), we might define the r.v. X as (Fig. 2-2) 
X(H) = 1 
X ( T )  = 0 
Note that we could also define another r.v., say Y or 2, with 
Y(H) = 0, Y(T) = 1 or Z(H) = 0, Z(T) = 0 
B. Events Defined by Random Variables: 
If X is a r.v. and x is a fixed real number, we can define the event (X = x) as 
(X = x) = {l: X(C) = x) 
Similarly, for fixed numbers x, x,, and x, , we can define the following events: 
(X 5 x) = {l: X(l) I x) 
(X > x) = {C: X([) > x) 
(xl < X I x2) = {C: XI < X(C) l x2)

RANDOM VARIABLES 
Fig. 2-2 One random variable associated with coin tossing. 
These events have probabilities that are denoted by 
P(X = x) = P{C: X(6) = X} 
P(X 5 x) = P(6: X(6) 5 x} 
P(X > x) = P{C: X(6) > x) 
P(x, < X I x,) = P { ( :  x, < X(C) I x,) 
EXAMPLE 2.2 
In the experiment of tossing a fair coin three times (Prob. 1.1), the sample space S, consists of 
eight equally likely sample points S ,  = (HHH, . . . , TTT). If X is the r.v. giving the number of heads obtained, find 
(a) P(X = 2); (b) P(X < 2). 
(a) Let A c S, be the event defined by X = 2. Then, from Prob. 1.1, we have 
A = ( X  = 2) = {C: X(C) = 2 )  = {HHT, HTH, THH) 
Since the sample points are equally likely, we have 
P(X = 2) = P(A) = 3 
(b) Let B c S ,  be the event defined by X < 2. Then 
B = ( X  < 2) = {c: X(() < 2) = (HTT, THT, TTH, TTT) 
and 
P(X < 2) = P(B) = 3 = 4 
2.3 DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS 
A. Definition : 
The distribution function [or cumulative distributionfunction (cdf)] of X is the function defined by 
Most of the information about a random experiment described by the r.v. X is determined by the 
behavior of FAX).

Property 1 follows because FX(x) is a probability. Property 2 shows that FX(x) is a nondecreasing 
function (Prob. 2.5). Properties 3 and 4 follow from Eqs. (1.22) and (1.26): 
limP(X<x)= P(X < co) = P(S)= 1 
X+oO 
lim P(X s x) = P(X s - co) = P(0) = 0 
x-'-a, 
Property 5 indicates that FX(x) is continuous on the right. This is the consequence of the definition 
(2.4).

EXAMPLE 2.3 
Consider the r.v. X defined in Example 2.2. Find and sketch the cdf FX(x) of X. 
Table 2.1 gives Fx(x) = P(X I x) for x = - 1, 0, 1 ,  2, 3, 4. Since the value of X must be an integer, the value of 
F,(x) for noninteger values of x must be the same as the value of FX(x) for the nearest smaller integer value of x. 
The FX(x) is sketched in Fig. 2-3. Note that F,(x) has jumps at x = 0, 1,2,3, and that at each jump the upper value 
is the correct value for FX(x).

C. Determination of Probabilities from the Distribution Function: 
From definition (2.4), we can compute other probabilities, such as P(a < X I b), P(X > a), and 
P(X < b) (Prob. 2.6): 
P(X < b) = F,(b-)

2.4 DISCRETE RANDOM VARIABLES AND PROBABILITY MASS FUNCTIONS 
A. Definition : 
Let X be a r.v. with cdf FX(x). If FX(x) changes values only in jumps (at most a countable number 
of them) and is constant between jumps-that 
is, FX(x) is a staircase function (see Fig. 2-3)-- then X 
is called a discrete random variable. Alternatively, X is a discrete r.v. only if its range contains a finite 
or countably infinite number of points. The r.v. X in Example 2.3 is an example of a discrete r.v. 
B. Probability Mass Functions: 
Suppose that the jumps in FX(x) of a discrete r.v. X occur at the points x,, x,, . . . , where the 
sequence may be either finite or countably infinite, and we assume xi < x j  if i < j. 
Then 
FX(xi) - FX(xi- ,) = P(X 5 xi) - P(X I xi- ,) = P(X = xi) 
(2.1 3) 
Let 
px(x) = P(X = x) 
(2.1 4) 
The function px(x) is called the probability mass function (pmf) of the discrete r.v. X. 
Properties of pdx) : 
The cdf FX(x) of a discrete r.v. X can be obtained by 
2.5 CONTINUOUS RANDOM VARIABLES AND PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTIONS 
A. Definition: 
Let X be a r.v. with cdf FX(x). If FX(x) is continuous and. also has a derivative dFx(x)/dx which 
exists everywhere except at possibly a finite number of points and is piecewise continuous, then X is 
called a continuous random variable. Alternatively, X is a continuous r.v. only if its range contains an 
interval (either finite or infinite) of real numbers. Thus, if X is a. continuous r.v., then (Prob. 2.18) 
Note that this is an example of an event with probability 0 that is not necessarily the impossible event 
0. 
In most applications, the r.v. is either discrete or continuous. But if the cdf FX(x) of a r.v. X 
possesses features of both discrete and continuous r.v.'s, then the r.v. X is called the mixed r.v. (Prob. 
2.10). 
B. Probability Density Functions: 
Let 
The function fx(x) is called the probability density function (pdf) of the continuous r.v. X.

Properties of fx(x) :

The cdf FX(x) of a continuous r.v. X can be obtained by 
By Eq. (2.19), if X is a continuous r.v., then 
2.6 MEAN AND VARIANCE 
A. Mean: 
The mean (or expected ualue) of a rev. X ,  denoted by px or E(X), is defined by 
X :  discrete 
px = E(X) = 
xfx(x) dx 
X :  continuous 
B. Moment: 
The nth moment of a r.v. X is defined by 
E(.n) 
= irx(xk) 
X :  discrete 
xnfdx) dx X :  continuous 
Note that the mean of X is the first moment of X .  
C. Variance: 
The variance of a r.v. X ,  denoted by ax2 or Var(X), is defined by 
ox2 = Var(X) = E{[X - E(X)I2} 
Thus, 
rC (xk - pX)2pX(~J X : discrete 
eX2 = 1 im 
( X  - px)2/x(x) dx x: continuous 

CHAP. 21 
RANDOM VARIABLES 
Note from definition (2.28) that 
The standard deviation of a r.v. X, denoted by a,, is the positive square root of Var(X). 
Expanding the right-hand side of Eq. (2.28), we can obtain the following relation: 
which is a useful formula for determining the variance. 
2.7 SOME SPECIAL DISTRIBUTIONS 
In this section we present some important special distributions. 
A. Bernoulli Distribution: 
A r.v. X is called a Bernoulli r.v. with parameter p if its pmf is given by 
px(k) = P(X = k) = pk(l - P ) ' - ~  
k = 0, 1 
where 0 
p I 
1. By Eq. (2.18), the cdf FX(x) of the Bernoulli r.v. X is given by 
x < o  
Figure 2-4 illustrates a Bernoulli distribution. 
Fig. 2-4 
Bernoulli distribution. 
The mean and variance of the Bernoulli r.v. X are 
A Bernoulli r.v. X is associated with some experiment where an outcome can be classified as 
either a "success" or a "failure," and the probability of a success is p and the probability of a failure is 
1 - p. Such experiments are often called Bernoulli trials (Prob. 1.61). 

RANDOM VARIABLES 
[CHAP 2 
B. Binomial Distribution: 
A r.v. X is called a binomial r.v. with parameters (n, p) if its pmf is given by 
where 0 5 p 5 1 and 
n ! 
(;) = k!(,, - k)! 
which is known as the binomial coefficient. The corresponding cdf of X is 
Figure 2-5 illustrates the binomial distribution for n = 6 and p = 0.6.

Fig. 2-5 
Binomial distribution with n = 6, p = 0.6. 
The mean and variance of the binomial r.v. X are (Prob. 2.28) 
A binomial r.v. X is associated with some experiments in which n independent Bernoulli trials are 
performed and X represents the number of successes that occur in the n trials. Note that a Bernoulli 
r.v. is just a binomial r.v. with parameters (1, p). 
C. Poisson Distribution: 
A r.v. X is called a Poisson r.v. with parameter A (> 0) if its pmf is given by 
The corresponding cdf of X is 
Figure 2-6 illustrates the Poisson distribution for A = 3.

RANDOM VARIABLES

Poisson distribution with A = 3. 
The mean and variance of the Poisson r.v. X are (Prob. 2.29) 
px = E(X) = A. 
ax2 = Var(X) = il 
The Poisson r.v. has a tremendous range of applications in diverse areas because it may be used 
as an approximation for a binomial r.v. with parameters (n, p) when n is large and p is small enough 
so that np is of a moderate size (Prob. 2.40). 
Some examples of Poisson r.v.'s include 
1. The number of telephone calls arriving at a switching center during various intervals of time 
2. The number of misprints on a page of a book 
3. The number of customers entering a bank during various intervals of time 
D. Uniform Distribution: 
A r.v. X is called a uniform r.v. over (a, b) if its pdf is given by 
(0 
otherwise 
The corresponding cdf of X is 
x - a  
FX(x) = - 
{ h - a  
a < x < b

The mean and variance of the uniform r.v. X are (Prob. 2.31) 

RANDOM VARIABLES 
[CHAP 2 
Fig. 2-7 Uniform distribution over (a, b). 
A uniform r.v. X is often used where we have no prior knowledge of the actual pdf and all 
continuous values in some range seem equally likely (Prob. 2.69). 
E. Exponential Distribution: 
A r.v. X is called an exponential r.v. with parameter A (>O) if its pdf is given by 
which is sketched in Fig. 2-8(a). The corresponding cdf of X is 
which is sketched in Fig. 2-8(b). 
Fig. 2-8 Exponential distribution. 
The mean and variance of the exponential r.v. X are (Prob. 2.32) 
The most interesting property of the exponential distribution is its "memoryless" property. By 
this we mean that if the lifetime of an item is exponentially distributed, then an item which has been 
in use for some hours is as good as a new item with regard to the amount of time remaining until the 
item fails. The exponential distribution is the only distribution which possesses this property (Prob. 
2.53).

F. Normal (or Gaussian) Distribution: 
A r.v. X is called a normal (or gaussian) r.v. if its pdf is given by 
The corresponding cdf of X is 
This integral cannot be evaluated in a closed form and must be evaluated numerically. It is conve- 
nient to use the function @(z), defined as 
to help us to evaluate the value of FX(x). Then Eq. (2.53) can be written as 
Note that 
The function @(z) is tabulated in Table A (Appendix A). Figure 2-9 illustrates a normal distribution. 
Fig. 2-9 Normal distribution. 
The mean and variance of the normal r.v. X are (Prob. 2.33) 
We shall use the notation N ( p ;  a2) to denote that X is normal with mean p and variance a2. A 
normal r.v. Z with zero mean and unit variance-that 
is, Z = N(0; 1)-is 
called a standard normal r.v. 
Note that the cdf of the standard normal r.v. is given by Eq. (2.54). The normal r.v. is probably the 
most important type of continuous r.v. It has played a significant role in the study of random pheno- 
mena in nature. Many naturally occurring random phenomena are approximately normal. Another 
reason for the importance of the normal r.v. is a remarkable theorem called the central limit theorem. 
This theorem states that the sum of a large number of independent r.v.'s, under certain conditions, 
can be approximated by a normal r.v. (see Sec. 4.8C).

2.8 CONDITIONAL DISTRIBUTIONS 
In Sec. 1.6 the conditional probability of an event A given event B is defined as 
The conditional cdf FX(x ( B) of a r.v. X given event B is defined by 
The conditional cdf F,(x 1 B) has the same properties as FX(x). (See Prob. 1.37 and Sec. 2.3.) In 
particular, 
F,(-coIB)=O

P(a < X I

If X is a continuous r.v., then the conditional pdf fx(x 1 B) is defined by

Note that the memoryless property Eq. (2.1 10) is also known as the Markov property (see Chap. 5), and 
it may be equivalently expressed as 
Let X be the lifetime (in hours) of a component. Then Eq. (2.114) states that the probability that the

3.1 INTRODUCTION 
In many applications it is important to study two or more r.v.'s defined on the same sample 
space. In this chapter, we first consider the case of two r.v.'s, their associated distribution, and some 
properties, such as independence of the r.v.'s. These concepts are then extended to the case of many 
r.v.'s defined on the same sample space. 
3.2. BIVARIATE RANDOM VARIABLES 
A. 
Definition: 
Let S be the sample space of a random experiment. Let X and Y be two r.v.'s. Then the pair (X, 
Y) is called a bivariate r.v. (or two-dimensional random vector) if each of X and Y associates a real 
number with every element of S. Thus, the bivariate r.v. (X, Y) can be considered as a function that to 
each point c in S assigns a point (x, y) in the plane (Fig. 3-1). The range space of the bivariate r.v. (X, 
Y) is denoted by R,, and defined by 
If the r.v.'s X and Y are each, by themselves, discrete r.v.'s, then (X, Y) is called a discrete 
bivariate r.v. Similarly, if X and Y are each, by themselves, continuous r.v.'s, then (X, Y) is called a 
continuous bivariate r.v. If one of X and Y is discrete while the other is continuous, then (X, Y) is 
called a mixed bivariate r.v.

function defined by

The variances of X and Y are easily obtained by using Eq. (2.31). The (1, 1)th joint moment of (X, Y), 
m,, = E(XY) 
(3.49) 
is called the correlation of X and Y. If E(XY) = 0, then we say that X and Y are orthogonal. The 
covariance of X and Y, denoted by Cov(X, Y) or ax,, is defined by 
Expanding Eq. (3.50), we obtain 
If Cov(X, Y) = 0, then we say that X and Y are uncorrelated. From Eq. (3.51), we see that X and Y 
are uncorrelated if 
Note that if X and Y are independent, then it can be shown that they are uncorrelated (Prob. 
3.32), but the converse is not true in general; that is, the fact that X and Y are uncorrelated does not, 
in general, imply that they are independent (Probs. 3.33, 3.34, and 3.38). The correlation coefficient, 
denoted by p(X, Y) or pxy, is defined by

3.10 SPECIAL DISTRIBUTIONS 
A. Multinomial Distribution: 
The multinomial distribution is an extension of the binomial distribution. An experiment is 
termed a multinomial trial with parameters p,, p, , . . . , p,, if it has the following conditions: 
1. The experiment has k possible outcomes that are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, say A,, A,, 
..., Ak. 
k 
2. P(Ai) = pi 
i = 1, . . . , k 
and 
1 
pi = 1 
(3.86) 
i =  1 
Consider an experiment which consists of n repeated, independent, multinomial trials with param- 
eters p,, p,, . . . , p,. Let Xi be the r.v. denoting the number of trials which result in Ai. Then (X,, X, , 
. . . , X& is called the multinomial r.v. with parameters (n, p,, p, , . . . , pk) and its pmf is given by (Prob. 
3.46) 
k 
for xi = 0, 1, . . . , n, i = 1, . . . , k, such that 
xi = n. 
i =  1 
Note that when k = 2, the multinomial distribution reduces to the binomial distribution. 
B. Bivariate Normal Distribution: 
A bivariate r.v. (X, Y) is said to be a bivariate normal (or gaussian) r.v. if its joint pdf is given by 
where 
( x ,  ) = 
[
(
 
- 2 P ( 3 ( 7 )  + (yy] 
and A, pY, ox2, oy2 are the means and variances of X and Y, respectively. It can be shown that p is 
the correlation coefficient of X and Y (Prob. 3.50) and that X and Y are independent when p = 0 
(Prob. 3.49). 
C. N-variate Normal Distribution: 
Let (XI, . . . , X,) be an n-variate r.v. defined on a sample space S. Let X be an n-dimensional 
random vector expressed as an n x 1 matrix: 

CHAP. 31 
MULTIPLE RANDOM VARIABLES 
Let x be an n-dimensional vector (n x 1 matrix) defined by 
X = [;I] 
xn 
The n-variate r.v. (XI, . . . , Xn) is called an n-variate normal r.v. if its joint pdf is given by 
where T denotes the "transpose," p is the vector mean, K is the covariance matrix given by 
and det K is the determinant of the matrix K. Note that f,(x) stands for f,, ... L(xl, . . . , xn).

We note that the term in the bracket of the exponential is a quadratic function of x and y, and hence

Limit Theorems 
4.1 INTRODUCTION 
In this chapter we study a few basic concepts of functions of random variables and investigate the 
expected value of a certain function of a random variable. The techniques of moment generating 
functions and characteristic functions, which are very useful in some applications, are presented. 
Finally, the laws of large numbers and the central limit theorem, which is one of the most remarkable 
results in probability theory, are discussed. 
4.2 FUNCTIONS OF ONE RANDOM VARIABLE 
A. Random Variable g(X) : 
Given a r.v. X and a function g(x), the expression 
defines a new r.v. Y. With y a given number, we denote Dy the subset of Rx (range of X) such that 
g(x) s y. Then 
where (X E Dy) is the event consisting of all outcomes [ such that the point X([) E Dy . Hence 
If X is a continuous r.v. with pdf f,(x), then 
B. Determination of fYQ) from fx(x): 
Let X be a continuous r.v. with pdf f,(x). If the transformation y = g(x) is one-to-one and has the 
inverse transformation 
x = g-l(y) = NY) 
then the pdf of Y is given by (Prob. 4.2) 
Note that if g(x) is a continuous monotonic increasing or decreasing function, then the transfor- 
mation y = g(x) is one-to-one. If the transformation y = g(x) is not one-to-one, fb) 
is obtained as 
follows: Denoting the real roots of y = g(x) by x,, that is,

then 
where g'(x) is the derivative of g(x). 
4.3. FUNCTIONS OF TWO RANDOM VARIABLES 
A. One Function of Two Random Variables: 
Given two r.v.'s X and Y and a function g(x, y), the expression 
defines a new r.v. 2. With z a given number, we denote Dz the subset of Rxy [range of (X, Y)] such 
that g(x, y) 5 z. Then 
where ((X, Y) E DZ) is the event consisting of all outcomes 
such that the point {X([), 
Y(5)) E DZ. 
Hence 
FAz) = P(Z I z) = P[g(X, Y) 5 z] = P((X, Y) E D,} 
(4.1 1) 
If X and Y are continuous r.v.'s with joint pdffxAx, y), then 
B. Two Functions of Two Random Variables: 
Given two r.v.'s X and Y and two functions g(x, y) and h(x, y), the expression 
defines two new r.v.'s Z and W. With z and w two given numbers, we denote Dzw the subset of Rxy 
[range of (X, Y)] such that g(x, y) < z and h(x, y) 5 w. Then 
where ((X, Y) E Dzw} is the event consisting of all outcomes such that the point {X(c), Y([)} E DZw. 
Hence 
In the continuous case, we have 
Determination of fz iw(z, w) jiom f d x ,  y) : 
Let X and Y be two continuous r.v.'s with joint pdf fxy(x, y). If the transformation 
z = g(x, Y) 
w = h(x, Y) 
is one-to-one and has the inverse transformation

then the joint pdf of Z and W is given by 
fzw(z, W) = f X Y k  Y) I J(x, Y) I - 
where x = q(z, w), y = r(z, w), and 
which is the jacobian of the transformation (4.1 7). If we define 
and Eq. (4.1 9) can be expressed as 
4.4 FUNCTIONS O F  n RANDOM VARIABLES 
A. One Function of n Random Variables: 
Given n r.v.'s X ,, . . . , X ,  and a function g(x,, . . . , x,), the expression 
y = g(X1, ..., X,) 
defines a new r.v. Y. Then 
and 
where Dy is the subset of the range of (X,, ..., X,) such that g(xl, ..., x,) < y. If XI, ..., X, are 
continuous r.v.'s with joint pdf f,, ... ,AX

B. 
n Functions of n Random Variables: 
When the joint pdf of n r.v.'s X,, . . . , X, is given and we want to determine the joint pdf of n r.v.'s 
Y,, .. ., Y,, where 
Yl = gl(X1, 
- 7  Xn) 
(4.28) 
K = gn(X1, 
Xn) 
the approach is the same as for two r.v.'s. We shall assume that the transformation

which is the jacobian of the transformation (4.29). 
4.5 EXPECTATION 
A. Expectation of a Function of One Random Variable: 
The expectation of Y = g(X) is given by 
(1 g(x) fX(x) dx 
(continuous case) 
-00 
B. Expectation of a Function of More than One Random Variable: 
Let XI, ..., Xn be n r.v.'s, and let Y = g(X,, ..., Xn).Then 
C. Linearity Property of Expectation: 
Note that the expectation operation is linear (Prob. 4.39), and we have 
(discrete case) 
(continuous case) 
(4.34) 
where a,'s are constants. If r.v.'s X and Y are independent, then we have (Prob. 4.41) 
ECg(X)h( Y)I = ECg(X)IE[h( Y)I 
(4.36) 
The relation (4.36) can be generalized to a mutually independent set of n r.v.'s XI, . . . , X,:

D. Conditional Expectation as a Random Variable: 
In Sec. 3.8 we defined the conditional expectation of Y given X = x, E(Y 1 x) [Eq. (3.58)], which is, 
in general, a function of x, say H(x). Now H(X) is a function of the r.v. X; that is, 
H(X) = E(Y 1 X) 
(4.38) 
Thus, E(Y 1 X) is a function of the r.v. X. Note that E(Y I X) has the following property (Prob. 4.38): 
E C V  I XI1 = E(Y) 
(4.39) 
4.6 MOMENT GENERATING FUNCTIONS 
A. Definition: 
The moment generating function of a r.v. X is defined by 
(1 
etXi~x(xi) 
(discrete case) 
Mx(t) = ~(e") = 
ii2yx(x, 
d~ 
(continuous case) 
where t is a real variable. Note that Mx(t) may not exist for all r.v.'s X. In general, M,(t) will exist 
only for those values of t for which the sum or integral of Eq. (4.40) converges absolutely. Suppose 
that Mdt) exists. If we express etX formally and take expectation, then 
and the kth moment of X is given by 
mk = E(Xk) = Mx(k)(0) 
k = 1, 2, ... 
where 
B. Joint Moment Generating Function : 
The joint moment generating function Mxy(tl, t,) of two r.v.'s X and Y is defined by 
Mxr(tl, t2) = E[e(t1X+t2Y) 
1 
(4.44) 
where t1 and t2 are real variables. Proceeding as we did in Eq. (4.41), we can establish that 
and the (k, n) joint moment of X and Y is given by 
where 
In a similar fashion, we can define the joint moment generating function of n r.v.'s XI, . . . , X, by 
Mxl ... x,(tl, . . . , t,) = E[e(tlX1+"'+hXn)] 
(4.48) 

CHAP. 41 FUNCTIONS OF RANDOM VARIABLES, EXPECTATION, LIMIT THEOREMS 
127 
from which the various moments can be computed. If X,, . . . , X, are independent, then 
C. Lemmas for Moment Generating Functions: 
Two important lemmas concerning moment generating functions are stated in the following: 
Lemma 4.1: If two r.v.'s have the same moment generating functions, then they must have the same 
distribution. 
Lemma 4.2: Given cdfs F(x), Fl(x), F,(x), . . . with corresponding moment generating functions M(t), M,(t), 
M,(t), . . . , then Fn(x) -, F(x) if M,(t) -+ M(t). 
4.7 CHARACTERISTIC FUNCTIONS 
A. Definition: 
The characteristic function of a r.v. X is defined by 
(x Brnxipx(xi) 
(discrete case) 
[J 
ejiwx 
fX(x) dx 
(continuous case) 
-a, 
where o is a real variable and j = p. 
Note that Yx(w) is obtained by replacing t in Mx(t) by jw if 
Mx(t) exists. Thus, the characteristic function has all the properties of the moment generating func- 
tion. Now 
for the discrete case and 
for the continuous case. Thus, the characteristic function Yx(u) is always defined even if the moment 
function Mx(t) is not (Prob. 4.58). Note that Yx(w) of Eq. (4.50) for the continuous case is the Fourier 
transform (with the sign of j reversed) of fx(x). Because of this fact, if Yx(w) is known, fx(x) can be 
found from the inverse Fourier transform; that is, 
B. Joint Characteristic Functions: 
The joint characteristic function Yx,(w,, w,) of two r.v.'s X and Y is defined by 
'1 e j ( ~ l x i + ~ 2 ~ k )  
P X Y ( ~ ~ ,  
~ k )  
(discrete case) 
i 
k 
C" C" e j ( a ~ x  
+WZY) fXy(x, y) dx dy 
(continuous case) 
where w, and cu, are real variables. 

FUNCTIONS O F  RANDOM VARIABLES, EXPECTATION, LIMIT THEOREMS [CHAP. 4 
The expression of Eq. (4.52) for the continuous case is recognized as the two-dimensional Fourier 
transform (with the sign of j reversed) of fxy(x, y). Thus, from the inverse Fourier transform, we have 
From Eqs. (4.50) and (4.52), we see that 
which are called marginal characteristic functions. 
Similarly, we can define the joint characteristic function of n r.v.'s XI, . . . , X,! by 
As in the case of the moment generating function, if X,, . . . , X,, are independent, then 
C. Lemmas for Characteristic Functions: 
As with the moment generating function, we have the following two lemmas: 
Lemma 4.3: A distribution function is uniquely determined by its characteristic function. 
Lemma 4.4: Given cdfs F(x), F,(x), F,(x), . . . with corresponding characteristic functions Y(o), Y1(o), Y,(o), 
. . . , then Fn(x) + F(x) at points of continuity of F(x) if and only if Y,(o) -+ Y(o) for every o. 
4.8 THE LAWS OF LARGE NUMBERS AND THE CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM 
A. The Weak Law of Large Numbers: 
Let XI, . . . , X, be a sequence of independent, identically distributed r.v.'s each with a finite mean 
E(Xi) = p. Let 
Then, for any E > 0, 
Equation (4.58) is known as the weak law of large numbers, and X, is known as the sample mean. 
B. The Strong Law of Large Numbers: 
Let XI, . . . , X, be a sequence of independent, identically distributed r.v.'s each with a finite mean 
E(Xi) = p. Then, for any E > 0, 
where Xn is the sample mean defined by Eq. (4.57). Equation (4.59) is known as the strong law of large 
numbers. 

CHAP. 4) 
FUNCTIONS OF RANDOM VARIABLES, EXPECTATION, LIMIT THEOREMS 
129 
Notice the important difference between Eqs. (4.58) 6nd (,4.59). Equation (4.58) tells us how a 
sequence of probabilities converges, and Eq. (4.59) tells us how the sequence of r.v,'s behaves in the 
limit. The strong law of large numbers tells us that the sequence (xn) 
is converging to the contant p. 
C. The Central Limit Theorem: 
The central limit theorem is one of the most remarkable results in probability theory. There are 
many versions of this theorem. In its simplest form, the central limit theorem is stated as follows: 
Let XI, . . . , X, be a sequence of independent, identically distributed r.v.'s each with mean p and 
variance a'. Let 
where 1, 
is defined by Eq. (4.57). Then the distribution of 2, tends to the standard normal as n -, oo; 
that is, 
lim 2, = N(0; 1 )  
n-t m 
lim F,,(Z) = lim P(Z, I 
z) = @(z) 
fl-' 
aJ 
fl* 
W 
where @(z) is the cdf of a standard normal r.v. [Eq. (2.54)]. Thus, the central limit theorem tells us 
that for large n, the distribution of the sum Sn = XI + . . + X n  is approximately normal regardless of 
the form of the distribution of the individual X,'s. Notice how much stronger this theorem is than the 
laws of large numbers. In practice, whenever an observed r.v. is known to be a sum of a large number 
of r.v.3, then the central limit theorem gives us some justification for assuming that this sum is 
normally distributed.

and 
which indicates that Z = N(0; 1). 
4.2. 
Verify Eq. (4.6). 
Assume that y = g(x) is a continuous monotonically increasing function [Fig. 4-l(a)]. Since y = g(x) is 
monotonically increasing, it has an inverse that we denote by x = g-'(y) = h(y). Then 
Applying the chain rule of differentiation to this expression yields 
which can be written as 
If y = g(x) is monotonically decreasing [Fig. 4.l(b)], then 
Fdy) = P( Y I

In Eq. (4.66), since y = g(x) is monotonically decreasing, dy/dx (and dxldy) is negative. Combining Eqs. 
(4.64) and (4.66), we obtain 
which is valid for any continuous monotonic (increasing or decreasing) function y = g(x).

(b) From Fig. 4-2, we see that y = g(x) = ax + b is a contirluous monotonically increasing (a > 0) or

For a < 0:

Let Y = a x  + b. Show that if X = N(p; a2), then Y = N(ap + b; a202), and find the values of a

Alternative Solution : 
If y c 0, then the equation y = x2 has no real solutions; hence f,(y) = 0. If y > 0, then y = x2 has two 
solutions, x, = fi and x, = -A. 
Now, y = g(x) = x2 and gf(x) = 2x. Hence, by Eq. (4.8),

Let Y = x2.

Let Y be a uniform r.v. over (0, 1). Let F(x) be a function which has the properties of the cdf of a

FX(x) = P(X 5 X) = P[F-'(Y) 5 X] 
Since F(x) is strictly increasing, F-'(Y) 5 x is equivalent to Y I: F(x), and hence

Given that Mf(t) and M"(t) are continuous functions of t, a Taylor (or Maclaurin) expansion of M(t) about

Equation (4.135) indicates that Y, is also a Cauchy r.v. with parameter a, and its pdf is the same as that 
of Xi. 
Since the characteristic function of Y, is independent of n and so is its pdf, Y, does not tend to a normal

Chapter 5 
Random Processes 
5.1 INTRODUCTION 
In this chapter, we introduce the concept of a random (or stochastic) process. The theory of 
random processes was first developed in connection with the study of fluctuations and noise in physi- 
cal systems. A random process is the mathematical model of an empirical process whose development 
is governed by probability laws. Random processes provides useful models for the studies of such 
diverse fields as statistical physics, communication and control, time series analysis, population 
growth, and management sciences. 
5.2 RANDOM PROCESSES 
A1. Defintion: 
A random process is a family of r.v.'s (X(t), t E T) defined on a given probability space, indexed 
by the parameter t, where t varies over an index set T. 
Recall that a random variable is a function defined on the sample space S (Sec. 2.2). Thus, a 
random process (X(t), t E T) is really a function of two arguments {X(t, c), t E T, 5 E S}. For a fixed 
t(=tk), X(tk, 5) = Xk(c) is a r.v. denoted by X(tk), as 5 varies over the sample space S. On the other 
hand, for a fixed sample point ci E S, X(t, ci) = Xi(t) is a single function of time t, called a sample 
function or a realization of the process. The totality of all sample functions is called an ensemble. 
Of course if both 5 and t are fixed, X(t,, ci) is simply a real number. In the following we use the 
notation X(t) to represent X(t, c).. 
B. Description of a Random Process: 
In a random process (X(t), t E T}, the index set T is called the parameter set of the random 
process. The values assumed by X(t) are called states, and the set of all possible values forms the state 
space E of the random process. If the index set T of a random process is discrete, then the process is 
called a discrete-parampter (or discrete-time) process. A discrete-parameter process is also called a 
random sequence and is denoted by {X,, n = 1, 2, . . .). If T is continuous, then we have a continuous- 
parameter (or continuous-time) process. If the state space E of a random process is discrete, then the 
process is called a discrete-state process, often referred to as a chain. In this case, the state space E is 
often assumed to be (0, 1, 2, . . .). If the state space E is continuous, then we have a continuous-state 
process. 
A complex random process X(t) is defined by 
where Xl(t) and X,(t) are (real) random processes and j = ,fq. 
Throughout this book, all random 
processes are real random processes unless specified otherwise. 
5.3 CHARACTERIZATION OF RANDOM PROCESSES 
A. Probabilistic Descriptions: 
Consider a random process X(t). For a fixed time t,, X(t,) = X ,  is a r.v., and its cdf F,(xl; t,) is 
defined as 

162 
RANDOM PROCESSES 
[CHAP 5 
F,(xl; t,) is known as the first-order distribution of X(t). Similarly, given t, and t,, X(t,) = X, and 
X(t2) = X, represent two r.v.3. Their joint distribution is known as the second-order distribution of 
X(t) and is given by 
In general, we define the nth-order distribution of X(t) by 
FX(x1, . . . , x,; ti, . . . , t,) = P{X(tl) I xl, . . . , X(t,) 2 x,) 
If X(t) is a discrete-time process, then X(t) is specified by a collection of pmf s: 
px(xl, . . . , Xn ; tl, . . . , t,) = P{X(tl) = XI, . . . , X(t,) = x,} 
(5.4) 
If X(t) is a continuous-time process, then X(t) is specified by a collection of pdf s: 
The complete characterization of X(t) requires knowledge of all the distributions as n + co. Fortu- 
nately, often much less is sufficient. 
B. Mean, Correlation, and Covariance Functions: 
As in the case of r.v.3, random processes are often described by using statistical averages. 
The mean of X(t) is defined by 
where X(t) is treated as a random variable for a fixed value of t. In general, p,(t) is a function of time, 
and it is often called the ensemble average of X(t). A measure of dependence among the r.v.'s of X(t) is 
provided by its autocorrelation function, defined by 
Rx(t, s) = ECX(t)X(s)l 
(5.7) 
Note that 
RX@, s) = Rx(s, t) 
(5.8) 
and 
Rx(~, t) = ECX2(t)l 
(5.9) 
The autocovariance function of X(t) is defined by 
KXV, s) = CovCX(t), X(s)l = E{CX(t) - px(t)lCX(s) - Px(s)l> 
= Rx(t, s) - Px(t)Px(s) 
(5.1 0) 
It is clear that if the mean of X(t) is zero, then Kx(t, s) = Rx(t, s). Note that the variance of X(t) is 
given by 
If X(t) is a complex random process, then its autocorrelation function Rx(t, s) and autocovariance 
function Kx(t, s) are defined, respectively, by 
5.4 CLASSIFICATION OF RANDOM PROCESSES 
If a random process X(t) possesses some special probabilistic structure, we can specify less to 
characterize X(t) completely. Some simple random processes are characterized completely by only the 
first- and second-order distributions. 

CHAP. 51 
RANDOM PROCESSES 
A. Stationary Processes: 
A random process {X(t), t E T) is said to be stationary or strict-sense stationary if, for all n and 
for every set of time instants (t, E T, i = 1,2, . . . , n), 
for any 2. Hence, the distribution of a stationary process will be unaffected by a shift in the time 
origin, and X(t) and X(t + 2) will have the same distributions for any z. Thus, for the first-order 
distribution, 
FX(x; t) = FX(x; t + 2) = FAX) 
and 
fAx; t) = fx(x) 
Then 
Px(t) = ECX(t)l = P 
Var[X(t)J = a2 
where p and a2 are contants. Similarly, for the second-order distribution, 
F x h  x2; t1, t2) = Fx(x1, x2; t2 - t1) 
(5.1 9) 
and 
fx(% X2; tl, t2) =fx(~l, ~ 2 ;  
t2 - tl) 
(5.20) 
Nonstationary processes are characterized by distributions depending on the points t,, t, , . . . , tn . 
B. Wide-Sense Stationary Processes : 
If stationary condition (5.14) of a random process X(t) does not hold for all n but holds for n 5 k, 
then we say that the process X(t) is stationary to order k. If X(t) is stationary to order 2, then X(t) is 
said to be wide-sense stationary (WSS) or weak stationary. If X(t) is a WSS random process, then we 
have 
1. E[X(t)] = p (constant) 
2. Rx(t, S) = E[X(t)X(s)] = Rx( ( s - t 1 ) 
Note that a strict-sense stationary process is also a WSS process, but, in general, the converse is not 
true. 
C. Independent Processes: 
In a random process X(t), if X(ti) for i = 1,2, . . . , n are independent r.v.'s, so that for n = 2,3, . . . , 
n 
FJX~, . . . , xn; t,, . . . , t,) = n F~(X,; 
ti) 
i= 1 
then we call X(t) an independent random process. Thus, a first-order distribution is sufficient to charac- 
terize an independent random process X(t). 
D. Processes with Stationary Independent Increments: 
A random process {X(t), t 2 0) is said to have independent increments if whenever 0 < t, < t, < 
... < t,, 
X(O), X(t1) - X(O), X(t2) - X(tl), . . X(tn) - X(tn- 1) 

RANDOM PROCESSES 
[CHAP 5 
are independent. If {X(t), t 2 0) has independent increments and X(t) - X(s) has the same distribu- 
tion as X(t + h) - X(s + h) for all s, t, h 2 0, s < t, then the process X(t) is said to have stationary 
independent increments. 
Let {X(t), t 2 0) be a random process with stationary independent increments and assume that 
X(0) = 0. Then (Probs. 5.21 and 5.22) 
where p, = E[X(l)] and 
where a12 = Var[X(l)]. 
From Eq. (5.24), we see that processes with stationary independent increments are nonstationary. 
Examples of processes with stationary independent increments are Poisson processes and Wiener 
processes, which are discussed in later sections. 
E. Markov Processes: 
A random process (X(t), t E 7') 
is said to be a Markov process if 
whenever t1 < t2 < 
< t, < t,,,. 
A discrete-state Markov process is called a Markov chain. For a discrete-parameter Markov 
chain {X,, n 2 0) (see Sec. 5.5), we have for every n 
P(X,+, = j ( X ,  = i,, Xi = i,, ..., Xn = i) = P(Xn+, = jlXn = i) 
(5.27) 
Equation (5.26) or Eq. (5.27) is referred to as the Markov property (which is also known as the 
memoryless property). This property of a Markov process states that the future state of the process 
depends only on the present state and not on the past history. Clearly, any process with independent 
increments is a Markov process. 
Using the Markov property, the nth-order distribution of a Markov process X(t) can be 
expressed as (Prob. 5.25) 
Thus, all finite-order distributions of a Markov process 
distributions. 
p{X(tk) 2 ~ k )  
I X(tk - 1) = xk - I) 
(5.28) 
can be expressed in terms of the second-order 
F. Normal Processes : 
A random process {X(t), t E T) is said to be a normal (or gaussian) process if for any integer n 
and any subset (t,, . . ., t,) of T, the n r.v.'s X(tl), ..., X(t,) are jointly normally distributed in the 
sense that their joint characteristic function is given by 
where w,, . .., on are any real numbers (see Probs. 5.59 and 5.60). Equation (5.29) shows that a 
normal process is completely characterized by the second-order distributions. Thus, if a normal 
process is wide-sense stationary, then it is also strictly stationary. 

CHAP. 53 
RANDOM PROCESSES 
G. Ergodic Processes : 
Consider a random process {X(t), - co < t < co) with a typical sample function x(t). The time 
average of x(t) is defined as 
Similarly, the time autocorrelation function Rx(7) of x(t) is defined as 
A random process is said to be ergodic if it has the property that the time averages of sample 
functions of the process are equal to the corresponding statistical or ensemble averages. The subject 
of ergodicity is extremely complicated. However, in most physical applications, it is assumed that 
stationary processes are ergodic. 
5.5 DISCRETE-PARAMETER MARKOV CHAINS 
In this section we treat a discrete-parameter Markov chain {X,, n 2 0) with a discrete state 
space E = (0, 1, 2, . . .), where this set may be finite or infinite. If X, = i, then the Markov chain is 
said to be in state i at time n (or the nth step). A discrete-parameter Markov chain { X , ,  n 2 0) is 
characterized by [Eq. (5.2711 
P(Xn+l = jJXo = io, Xi = i,, ..., X, = i) = P(X,+, = jJX, = i) 
(5.32) 
where P(x,+ , = j 1 X, = i) are known as one-step transition probabilities. If P{x, + , = j 1 X, = i} is 
independent of n, then the Markov chain is said to possess stationary transition probabilities and the 
process is referred to as a homogeneous Markov chain. Otherwise the process is known as a nonhomo- 
geneous Markov chain. Note that the concepts of a Markov chain's having stationary transition 
probabilities and being a stationary random process should not be confused. The Markov process, in 
general, is not stationary. We shall consider only homogeneous Markov chains in this section. 
A. Transition Probability Matrix : 
Let (X,, n 2 0) be a homogeneous Markov chain with a discrete infinite state space E = (0, 1, 
2, . . .). Then 
regardless of the value of n. A transition probability matrix of (X,, n 2 0) is defined by 
where the elements satisfy

RANDOM PROCESSES 
[CHAP 5 
In the case where the state space E is finite and equal to (1, 2, . . . , m), P is m x m dimensional; that is, 
where 
A square matrix whose elements satisfy Eq. (5.34) or (5.35) is called a Markov matrix or stochastic 
matrix. 
B. Higher-Order Transition Probabilities-Chapman-Kolmogorov Equation: 
Tractability of Markov chain models is based on the fact that the probability distribution of 
(X,, 
n 2 0) can be computed by matrix manipulations. 
Let P = pi,] be the transition probability matrix of a Markov chain {X,, n 2 0). Matrix powers 
of P are defined by 
with the (i, j)th element given by 
Note that when the state space E is infinite, the series above converges, since by Eq. (5.34), 
Similarly, p3 = P P ~  
has the (i, j)th element 
and in general, Pn + = PPn has the (i, j)th element 
Finally, we define PO = I, where I is the identity matrix. 
The n-step transition probabilities for the homogeneous Markov chain (X,, n 2 0) are defined 
by 
Then we can show that (Prob. 5.70) 
We compute p i p 1  by taking matrix powers.

is known as the Chapman-Kolmogorou equation. It expresses the fact that a transition from i to j in 
n + m steps can be achieved by moving from i to an intermediate k in n steps (with probability pik(n)), 
and then proceeding to j from k in m steps (with probability p,]")). Furthermore, the events "go from i 
to k in n steps" and "go from k to j in m steps" are independent. Hence the probability of the 
transition from i to j in n + rn steps via i, k, j is pik(")pk]"). Finally, the probability of the transition 
from i to j is obtained by summing over the intermediate state k. 
C. The Probability Distribution of {X, , n 2 
0) : 
Let pi(n) = P(X, = i) and 
Then pi(0) = P(Xo = i) are the initial-state probabilities, 
is called the initial-state probability vector, and p(n) is called the state probability vector after n tran- 
sitions or the probability distribution of X,. Now it can be shown that (Prob. 5.29) 
which indicates that the probability distribution of a homogeneous Markov chain is completely 
determined by the one-step transition probability matrix P and the initial-state probability vector 
HO). 
D. Classification of States: 
1. Accessible States : 
State j is said to be accessible from state i if for some n 2 0, pi,.('" z 0, and we write i -+ j. Two 
states i and j accessible to each other are said to communicate, and we write i-j. 
If all states commu- 
nicate with each other, then we say that the Markov chain is irreducible. 
2. Recurrent States: 
Let 
be the time (or the number of steps) of the first visit to state j after time zero, unless state j 
is never visited, in which case we set T j  = oo. Then IT;. is a discrete r.v. taking values in (1, 2, . . . , m}. 
Let 
f ; : ~ m ) = ~ ( T , = m l ~ , = i ) = ~ ( ~ , = j , ~ , # j , k = l , 2  
,..., m - l l X o = i )  
(5.40) 
and&iO) = 0 since 7j 2 1. Then 
and 
The probability of visiting j in finite time, starting from i, is given by 
Now state j is said to be recurrent if 
f j j = P ( T , <  coIX,=j)= 1 

168 
RANDOM PROCESSES 
[CHAP 5 
That is, starting from j, the probability of eventual return to j is one. A recurrent state j is said to be 
positive recurrent if 
E ( q I X o  = j )  < co 
(5.45) 
and state j is said to be null recurrent if 
E(qT;.Xo=j)= co 
Note that 
3. Transient States: 
State j is said to be transient (or nonrecurrent) if 
f j j = P ( q <  c o I X o = j ) <  1 
In this case there is positive probability of never returning t~ state j. 
4. Periodic and Aperiodic States : 
We define the period of state j to be 
where gcd stands for greatest common divisor. 
If d(j) > 1, then state j is called periodic with period d(j). If d(j) = 1, then state j is called aperiodic. 
Note that whenever pjj > 0, j is aperiodic. 
5. Absorbing States: 
State j is said to be an absorbing state if pjj = 1 ; that is, once state j is reached, it is never left. 
E. Absorption Probabilities: 
Consider a Markov chain X(n) = {X,, n 2 0) with finite state space E = (1, 2, . . . , N )  and tran- 
sition probability matrix P. Let A = (1, . . . , m) be the set of absorbing states and B = {m + 1, . . . , N )  
be a set of nonabsorbing states. Then the transition probability matrix P can be expressed as 
where I is an m x m identity matrix, 0 is an m x (N - m) zero matrix, and 
Note that the elements of R are the one-step transition probabilities from nonabsorbing to absorbing 
states, and the elements of Q are the one-step transition probabilities among the nonabsorbing states.

Let U = [ukj], where

It is seen that U is an (N - m) x m matrix and its elements are the absorption probabilities for the 
various absorbing states. Then it can be shown that (Prob. 5.40) 
U = (I - Q)-'R = (DR 
(5.50) 
The matrix (D = (I - Q)-' is known as the fundamental matrix of the Markov chain X(n). Let T, 
denote the total time units (or steps) to absorption from state k. Let 
Then it can be shown that (Prob. 5.74) 
where 4ki is the (k, i)th element of the fundamental matrix 0. 
F. Stationary Distributions: 
Let P be the transition probability matrix of a homogeneous Markov chain {X,, n 2 0). 
exists a probability vector p such that 
fiP = fi 
If there 
then p is called a stationary distribution for the Markov chain. Equation (5.52) indicates that a sta- 
tionary distribution p is a (left) eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 1. Note that any nonzero multiple of B 
is also an eigenvector of P. But the stationary distribution p is fixed by being a probability vector; 
that is, its components sum to unity. 
G. Limiting Distributions: 
A Markov chain is called regular if there is a finite positive integer m such that after m time-steps, 
every state has a nonzero chance of being occupied, no matter what the initial state. Let A > 0 
denote that every element aij of A satisfies the condition aij > 0. Then, for a regular Markov chain 
with transition probability matrix P, there exists an m > 0 such that Pm > 0. 
For a regular homoge- 
neous Markov chain we have the following theorem: 
THEOREM 5.5.1 
Let {X,, n 2 0) be a regular homogeneous finite-state Markov chain with transition matrix P. 
Then 
lim Pn = 
n+m 
where 
is a matrix whose rows are identical and equal to the stationary distribution p for the 
Markov chain defined by Eq. (5.52). 
5.6 POISSON PROCESSES 
A. Definitions: 
Let t represent a time variable. Suppose an experiment begins at t = 0. Events of a particular 
kind occur randomly, the first at TI, the second at T2, and so on. The r.v. IT;. denotes the time at which 
the ith event occurs, and the values ti of 
(i = 1,2, . . .) are called points of occurrence (Fig. 5-1).

Fig. 5-1 
Let 
Z, = T, - T,-, 
(5.54) 
and To = 0. Then Z, denotes the time between the (n - 1)st and the nth events (Fig. 5-1). The 
sequence of ordered r.v.'s {Z,, n 2 1) is sometimes called an interarrival process. If all r.v.'s Z, are 
independent and identically distributed, then {Z,, n 2 1) is called a renewal process or a recurrent 
process. From Eq. (5.54), we see that 
where T, denotes the time from the beginning until the occurrence of the nth event. Thus, (T,, n 2 0) 
is sometimes called an arrival process. 
B. Counting Processes : 
A random process {X(t), t 2 0) is said to be a counting process if X(t) represents the total number 
of "events" that have occurred in the interval (0, t). From its definition, we see that for a counting 
process, X(t) must satisfy the following conditions: 
1. X(t) 2 0 and X(0) = 0. 
2. X(t) is integer valued. 
3. X(s) ~ X ( t ) i f s  
< t. 
4. X(t) - X(s) equals the number of events that have occurred on the interval (s, t). 
A typical sample function (or realization) of X(t) is shown in Fig. 5-2. 
A counting process X(t) is said to possess independent increments if the numbers of events which 
occur in disjoint time intervals are independent. A counting process X(t) is said to possess stationary 
increments if the number of events in the interval (s + h, t + h)--that 
is, X(t + h) - X(s + h e h a s  the 
same distribution as the number of events in the interval (s, t)--that 
is, X(t) - X(s)--for all s < t and 
h > 0. 
Fig. 5-2 A sample function of a counting process. 
C. Poisson Processes: 
One of the most important types of counting processes is the Poisson process (or Poisson counting 
process), which is defined as follows: 

CHAP. 5) 
RANDOM PROCESSES 
DEFINITION 5.6.1 
A counting process X(t) is said to be a Poisson process with rate (or intensity) 1(> 0) if 
X(t) has independent increments. 
The number of events in any interval of length t is Poisson distributed with mean At; that is, for 
all s, t > 0, 
It follows from condition 3 of Def. 5.6.1 that a Poisson process has stationary increments and that 
E[X(t)] = At 
Then by Eq. (2.43) (Sec. 2.7C), we have 
Var[X(t)] = At 
Thus, the expected number of events in the unit interval (0, I), or any other interval of unit length, is 
just A (hence the name of the rate or intensity). 
An alternative definition of a Poisson process is given as follows : 
DEFINITION 5.6.2 
A counting process X(t) is said to be a Poisson process with rate (or intensity) A(>O) if 
1. X(0) = 0. 
2. X(t) has independent and stationary increments. 
3. P[X(t + At) - X(t) = 11 = A At + o(At) 
4. P[X(t + At) - X(t) 2 21 = o(At) 
where o(At) is a function of At which goes to zero faster than does At; that is, 
o m )  
lim - 
- 
- 0 
at-o 
At 
Note : Since addition or multiplication by a scalar does not change the property of approaching zero, 
even when divided by At, o(At) satisfies useful identities such as o(At) + o(At) = o(At) and 
ao(At) = o(At) for all constant a. 
It can be shown that Def. 5.6.1 and Def. 5.6.2 are equivalent (Prob. 5.49). Note that from condi- 
tions 3 and 4 of Def. 5.6.2, we have (Prob. 5.50) 
P[X(t + At) - X(t) = 0] = 1 - 1 At + o(At) 
(5.59) 
Equation (5.59) states that the probability that no event occurs in any short interval approaches unity 
as the duration of the interval approaches zero. It can be shown that in the Poisson process, the 
intervals between successive events are independent and identically distributed exponential r.v.'s 
(Prob. 5.53). Thus, we also identify the Poisson process as a renewal process with exponentially 
distributed intervals. 
The autocorrelation function Rx(t, s) and the autocovariance function Kdt, s) of a Poisson 
process X(t) with rate 1 are given by (Prob. 5.52)

5.7 WIENER PROCESSES 
Another example of random processes with independent stationary increments is a Wiener process. 
DEFINITION 5.7.1 
A random process (X(t), t 2 0) is called a Wiener process if 
1. X(t) has stationary independent increments. 
2. The increment X(t) - X(s) (t > s) is normally distributed. 
3. E[X(t)J =O. 
4. X(0) = 0. 
The Wiener process is also known as the Brownian motion process, since it originates as a model for 
Brownian motion, the motion of particles suspended in a fluid. From Def. 5.7.1, we can verify that a 
Wiener process is a normal process (Prob. 5.61) and 
where a2 is a parameter of the Wiener process which must be determined from observations. When 
a2 = 1, X(t) is called a standard Wiener (or standard Brownian motion) process. 
The autocorrelation function Rx(t, s) and the autocovariance function K,(t, s) of a Wiener 
process X(t) are given by (see Prob. 5.23) 
DEFINITION 5.7.2 
A random process (X(t), t 2 0) is called a Wiener process with drift coeficient p if 
1. X(t) has stationary independent increments. 
2. X(t) is normally distributed with mean pt. 
3. X(0) = 0. 
From condition 2, the pdf of a standard Wiener process with drift coefficient p is given by

Derive the first-order probability distribution of the simple random walk X(n) of Prob. 5.2. 
The first-order probability distribution of the simple random walk X(n) is given by 
where k is an integer. Note that P(Xo = 0) = 1. We note that p,(k) = 0 if n < 1 k 1 because the simple random 
walk cannot get to level k in less than I k I steps. Thus, n 2 1 k I. 
Let Nnf and N,- be the r.v.'s denoting the numbers of + 1s and - Is, respectively, in the first n steps. 
Then 
Adding Eqs. (5.68) and (5.69), we get 
Nnt = $(n + X,) 
(5.70) 
Thus, X, = k if and only if N,+ = i ( n  + k). From Eq. (5.70), we note that 2N,+ = n + X, must be even. 
Thus, X, must be even if n is even, and X, must be odd if n is odd. We note that N,+ is a binomial r.v. with 
parameters (n, p). Thus, by Eq. (2.36), we obtain

Show that a random process which is stationary to order n is also stationary to all orders lower 
than n. 
Assume that Eq. (5.14) holds for some particular n; that is, 
for any z. Letting x, -, a, 
we have [see Eq. (3.63)] 
and the process is stationary to order n - 1. Continuing the same procedure, we see that the process is 
stationary to all orders lower than n. 
5.15. 
Show that if {X(t), t E T )  is a strict-sense stationary random process, then it is also WSS. 
Since X(t) is strict-sense stationary, the first- and second-order distributions are invariant through time 
translation for all T E T. Then we have 
px(t) = E[X(t)] = E[X(t + T)] = px(t + t) 
and hence the mean function pdt) must be constant; that is, 
Similarly, we have 
E[X(t)] = p (constant) 
E[X(s)X(t)] = E[X(s + z)X(t + T)] 
so that the autocorrelation function would depend on the time points s and t only through the difference 
( t - s 1. Thus, X(t) is WSS. 
5.16. 
Let (x,, 
n 2 0) be a sequence of iid r.v.'s with mean 0 and variance 1. Show that (X,, n 2 O} is 
a WSS process. 
By Eq. (5.90), 
E(Xn) = 0 (constant) 
for all n 

and by Eq. (5.91), 
RANDOM PROCESSES 
[CHAP 5 
which depends only on k. Thus, (X,} is a WSS process. 
5.17. Show that if a random process X(t) is WSS, then it must also be covariance stationary. 
If X(t) is WSS, then 
E[X(t)] = p (constant) 
for all t 
Rx(t, t + r)] = Rx(7) 
for all t 
NOW 
Kx(t, t + T) = Cov[X(t)X(t + T)] = Rx(t, t + z) - E[X(t)]E[X(t + z)] 
= R,(z) - p2 
which indicates that Kx(t, t + z) depends only on z; thus, X(t) is covariance stationary. 
5.18. 
Consider a random process X(t) defined by 
X(t)= U cos cot + V sin cot 
-a < t < KI 
where ~ r >  
is constant and U and V are r.v.'s. 
(a) Show that the condition 
E(U) = E(V) = 0 
is necessary for X(t) to be stationary. 
(b) Show that X(t) is WSS if and only if U and V are uncorrelated with equal variance; that is, 
E(UV) = o 
E ( u ~ )  
= E ( v ~ )  
= c2 
(5.95) 
(a) Now 
px(t) = E[X(t)] = E(U) cos wt + E(V) sin cot 
must be independent of t for X(t) to be stationary. This is possible only if px(t) = 0, that is, 
E(U) = E(V) = 0. 
(6) If X(t) is WSS, then 
But X(0) = U and X(n/2w) = V; thus 
E(U2) = E(V2) = ax2 = a2 
Using the above result, we obtain 
Rx(t, t + 7) = E[X(t)X(t + T)] 
= E((U cos wt + V sin ot)[U cos o(t + z) + V sin o(t + z)]} 
= o2 cos oz + E(UV) sin(2wt + wz) 
(5.96) 
which will be a function of z only if E(UV) = 0. Conversely, if E(UV) = 0 and E(U2) = E(V2) = 02, 
then from the result of part (a) and Eq. (5.96), we have 
Hence, X(t) is WSS.

RANDOM PROCESSES 
5.19. 
Consider a random process X(t) defined by 
X(t) = U cos t + V sin t 
- m < t < 
where U and V are independent r.v.'s, each of which assumes the values -2 and 1 with the 
probabilities 4 and 3, respectively. Show that X(t) is WSS but not strict-sense stationary. 
We have 
Since U and V are independent, 
Thus, by the results of Prob. 5.18, X(t) is WSS. To see if X(t) is strict-sense stationary, we consider E[x3(t)]. 
E[X3(t)] = E[(U cos t + V sin t)3] 
= E(U3) cos3 t + 3E(U2V) cos2 t sin t + 3E(UV2) cos t sin2 t + E(V3) sin3 t 
Now 
Thus 
E[X3(t)J = --2(cos3 t + sin3 t) 
which is a function of t. From Eq, (5.16), we see that all the moments of a strict-sense stationary process 
must be independent of time. Thus X(t) is not strict-sense stationary. 
5.20. 
Consider a random process X(t) defined by 
X(t) = A cos(wt + 0) - co < t < co 
where A and w are constants and 0 is a uniform r.v. over (-71, n). Show that X(t) is WSS. 
From Eq. (2.44), we have 
(0 
otherwise 
Then 
cos(wt + 0) dB = 0

Since the mean of X(t) is a constant and the autocorrelation of X(t) is a function of time difference only, we 
conclude that X(t) is WSS. 
5.21. 
Let (X(t), t 2 0 )  be a random process with stationary independent increments, and assume that 
X(0) = 0. Show that

Then, for any t and s and using Eq. (4.108) and the property of the stationary independent increments, we 
have 
The only solution to the above functional equation is f(t) = ct, where c is a constant. Since c = f(1) = 
E[X(l)], we obtain 
5.22. 
Let {X(t), t 2 0) be a random process with stationary independent increments, and assume that 
X(0) = 0. Show that

where a12 = Var[X(l)]. 
(a) Let 
g(t) = Var[X(t)] = Var[X(t) - X(O)] 
Then, for any t and s and using Eq. (4.1 12) and the property of the stationary independent increments, 
we get 
which is the same functional equation as Eq. (5.100). Thus, g(t) = kt, where k is a constant. Since 
k = g(1) = Var[X(l)], we obtain 
(b) Let t > s. Then 
Thus, using Eq. (5.1 Ol), we obtain 
5.23. 
Let {X(t), t 2 0) be a random process with stationary independent increments, and assume that 
X(0) = 0. Show that 
where aI2 = Var[X(l)].

By definition (2.28), 
Thus, 
Cov[X(t), X(s)] = +{Var[X(t)] + var[X(s)] - Var[X(t) - X(s)l) 
Using Eqs. (3.1 01) and (5.1 02), we obtain 
$a12[t + s - (t - s)] = a12s 
t > s 
KX(4 s) = $a12[t + s - (S - t)] = a12t

or 
where aI2 = Var[X(l)]. 
5.24. 
(a) Show that a simple random walk X(n) of Prob. 5.2 is a Markov chain. 
(b) Find its one-step transition probabilities. 
(a) From Eq. (5.73) (Prob. 5.10), X(n) = {X,, n 2 0) can be expressed as 
where Z, (n = 1,2, . . .) are iid r.v.'s with 
P(Z,=k)=ak 
(

and 
a , = p  
a - , = q = l - p  
Then X(n) = {X,, n 2 0) is a Markov chain, since 
P(X,+l=i,+l~X,=O,Xl=i ,,..., X,=i,) 
= P(Z,+, + in = in+, lXo = 0, X, = i,, ..., X, = in) 
= P(Z,+l = in+, -in) = ain+i-in = P(X,+, = in+, IX, = in) 
since Z,+ , is independent of X,, X,, . . . , X,. 
(b) The one-step transition probabilities are given by 
k = j + l  
pjk=P(X,=klX,-I = j ) =

otherwise 
which do not depend on n. Thus, a simple random walk X(n) is a homogeneous Markov chain. 
5.25. 
Show that for a Markov process X(t), the second-order distribution is suficient to characterize 
Let X(t) be a Markov process with the nth-order distribution 
Then, using the Markov property (5.26), we have 
Applying the above relation repeatedly for lower-order distribution, we can write

Hence, all finite-order distributions of a Markov process can be completely determined by the second-order 
distribution. 
5.26. 
Show that if a normal process is WSS, then it is also strict-sense stationary. 
By Eq. (5.29), a normal random process X(t) is completely characterized by the specification of the 
mean E[X(t)] and the covariance function Kx(t, s) of the process. Suppose that X(t) is WSS. Then, by Eqs. 
(5.21) and (5.22), Eq. (5.29) becomes 
Now we translate all of the time instants t,, t,, . . . , t, by the same amount z. The joint characteristic 
function of the new r.v.'s X(ti + z), i = 1, 2, . . . , n, is then 
which indicates that the joint characteristic function (and hence the corresponding joint pdf) is unaffected by 
a shift in the. time origin. Since this result holds for any n and any set of time instants (ti E T, i = 1,2, . . . , n), 
it follows that if a normal process is WSS, then it is also strict-sense stationary.

Premultiplying both sides of Eq. (5.1 11) by P, we obtain 
P2a = Pa = a  
which indicates that P2 is also a Markov matrix. Repeated premultiplication by P yields 
which shows that P" is also a Markov matrix. 
5.29. 
Verify Eq. (5.39); that is, 
We verify Eq. (5.39) by induction. If the state of X, is i, state XI will be j only if a transition is made 
from i to j. The events {X, = i, i = 1, 2, . . .} are mutually exclusive, and one of them must occur. Hence, by 
the law of total probability [Eq. (1.44)], 
In terms of vectors and matrices, Eq. (5.1 12) can be expressed as 
~ ( 1 )

Thus, Eq. (5.39) is true for n = 1. Assume now that Eq. (5.39) is true for n = k; that is,

Again, by the law of total probability, 
In terms of vectors and matrices, Eq. (5.1 14) can be expressed as 
which indicates that Eq. (5.39) is true for k + 1. Hence, we conclude that Eq. (5.39) is true for all n 2 1.

Verify the transitivity property of the Markov chain ; that is, if i -+ j and j -+ k, then i -+ k. 
By definition, the relations i + j and j -, k imply that there exist integers n and m such that pip) > 0

If the Markov chain (X,} goes from state i to state j in m steps, the first step must take the chain from i 
to some state k, where k # j. Now after that first step to k, we have m - 1 steps left, and the chain must get 
to state j, from state k, on the last of those steps. That is, the first visit to state j must occur on the (m - 1)st 
step, starting now in state k. Thus we must have 
Show that in a finite-state Markov chain, not all states can be transient. 
Suppose that the states are 0, 1, . . . , m, and suppose that they are all transient. Then by definition, after 
a finite amount of time (say To), state 0 will never be visited; after a finite amount of time (say TI), state 1 
will never be visited; and so on. Thus, after a finite time T = max{T,, TI, . . . , T,), no state will be visited. 
But as the process must be in some state after time T, we have a contradiction. Thus, we conclude that not 
all states can be transient and at least one of the states must be recurrent. 
A state transition diagram of a finite-state Markov chain is a line diagram with a vertex corre- 
sponding to each state and a directed line between two vertices i and j if pij > 0. In such a 
diagram, if one can move from i and j by a path following the arrows, then i + j. The diagram is 
useful to determine whether a finite-state Markov chain is irreducible or not, or to check for 
periodicities. Draw the state transition diagrams and classify the states of the Markov chains

(a) The state transition diagram of the Markov chain with P of part (a) is shown in Fig. 5-lqa). From Fig. 
5-10(a), it is seen that the Markov chain is irreducible and aperiodic. For instance, one can get back to 
state 0 in two steps by going from 0 to 1 to 0. However, one can also get back to state 0 in three steps 
by going from 0 to 1 to 2 to 0. Hence 0 is aperiodic. Similarly, we can see that states 1 and 2 are also 
aperiodic. 
(b) The state transition diagram of the Markov chain with P of part (b) is shown in Fig. 5-10(b). From Fig.

(c) The state transition diagram of the Markov chain with P of part (c) is shown in Fig. 5-10(c). From Fig.

Now, by Eq. (5.59), we have 
Thus, 
P[X(t + At) - X(t) = 01 = 1 - r3. At + o(At) 
po(t + At) = po(t)[l - I At + o(At)] 
Letting At + 0, and by Eq. (5.58), we obtain

Solving the above differential equation, we get 
po(t) = ke-" 
where k is an integration constant. Since po(0) = P[X(O) = 01 = 1, we obtain 
po(t) = e - At 
Similarly, for n > 0,

Now, by condition 4 of Definition 5.6.2, the last term in the above expression is o(At). Thus, by conditions 2

Verify Eq. (5.59). 
We note first that X(t) can assume only nonnegative integer values; therefore, the same is true for the

From Eqs. (5.56) and (5.57),

Now, the Poisson process X(t) is a random process with stationary independent increments and X(0) = 0. 
Thus, by Eq. (5.103) (Prob. 5.23), we obtain 
Kx(t, s) = o12 min(t, s) = I min(t, s) 
(5.1 62) 
since a12 = Var[X(l)] = I. Next, since E[X(t)]E[X(s)] = A2ts, by Eq. (5.10), we obtain

Let Z,, Z,, . . . be the r.v.'s representing the lengths of interarrival times in the Poisson process X(t). 
First, notice that { Z ,  > t )  takes place if and only if no event of the Poisson process occur in the interval 
(0, t), and thus by Eq. (5.154), 
Hence Z, is an exponential r.v. with parameter I [Eq. (2.49)]. Let f,(t) be the pdf of Z,. Then we have

Let X(t) be the Poisson process with parameter I = &. The probability that nobody is admitted to see

First we calculate the joint probability PIXl(t) = k, X2(t) = m]. 
Note that

Thus, using Eq. (5.1 58), we obtain 
Now, given that k + m events occurred, since each event has probability p of being a type 1 event and 
probability 1 - p of being a type 2 event, it follows that 
Thus, 
Then 
which indicates that X,(t) is a Poisson process with rate Ap. Similarly, we can obtain 
and so X2(t) is a Poisson process with rate A(l - p). Finally, from Eqs. (5.170), (5.171), and (5.169), we see

Note that on the basis of the above result, we can say that a random process {X(t), t E T) is a normal

Analysis and Processing of Random Processes 
6.1 INTRODUCTION 
In this chapter, we introduce the methods for analysis and processing of random processes. First, 
we introduce the definitions of stochastic continuity, stochastic derivatives, and stochastic integrals of 
random processes. Next, the notion of power spectral density is introduced. This concept enables us 
to study wide-sense stationary processes in the frequency domain and define a white noise process. 
The response of linear systems to random processes is then studied. Finally, orthogonal and spectral 
representations of random processes are presented. 
6.2 CONTINUITY, DIFFERENTIATION, INTEGRATION 
In this section, we shall consider only the continuous-time random processes. 
A. Stochastic Continuity: 
A random process X(t) is said to be continuous in mean square or mean square (m.s.) continuous if 
lim E{[X(t + E) - X(t)I2) = 0 
8 - 0  
(6.1) 
The random process X(t) is m.s. continuous if and only if its autocorrelation function is continuous 
(Prob. 6.1). 1fx(t) is WSS, then it is mas. continuous if and only if its autocorrelation 
continuous at z = 0. If X(t) is m.s. continuous, then its mean is continuous; that is, 
lirn p,(t + E) = pX(t) 
E+O 
which can be written as 
lirn E[X(t + E)] = E[lim X(t + E)] 
8 - 0  
&-'O 
function Rx(r) is 
(6.2) 
Hence, if X(t) is m.s. continuous, then we may interchange the ordering of the operations of expecta- 
tion and limiting. Note that m.s. continuity of X(t) does not imply that the sample functions of X(t) 
are continuous. For instance, the Poisson process is m.s. continuous (Prob. 6.46), but sample func- 
tions of the Poisson process have a countably infinite number of discontinuities (see Fig. 5-2). 
B. Stochastic Derivatives: 
A random process X(t) is said to have a m.s. derivative X1(t) if 
where 1.i.m. denotes limit in the mean (square); that is, 

210 
ANALYSIS AND PROCESSING OF RANDOM PROCESSES 
[CHAP 6 
The m.s. derivative of X(t) exists if a2~,(t, s)/& as exists (Prob. 6.6). If X(t) has the m.s. derivative 
X1(t), then its mean and autocorrelation function are given by 
Equation (6.6) indicates that the operations of differentiation and expectation may be interchanged. If 
X(t) is a normal random process for which the m.s. derivative X'(t) exists, then X'(t) is also a normal 
random process (Prob. 6.10). 
C. Stochastic Integrals: 
A m.s. integral of a random process X(t) is defined by 
whereto < t, 
< tand At, = ti+l -ti. 
The m.s. integral of X(t) exists if the following integral exists (Prob. 6.1 1): 
This implies that if X(t) is m.s. continuous, then its m.s. integral Y(t) exists (see Prob. 6.1). The mean 
and the autocorrelation function of Y(t) are given by 
Equation (6.1 0) indicates that the operations of integration and expectation may be interchanged. If 
X(t) is a normal random process, then its integral Y(t) is also a normal random process. This follows 
from the fact that Z, X(ti) Ati is a linear combination of the jointly normal r.v.'s. (see Prob. 5.60). 
6.3 
POWER SPECTRAL DENSITIES 
In this section we assume that all random processes are WSS. 
A. 
Autocorrelation Functions: 
The autocorrelation function of a continuous-time random process X(t) is defined as [Eq. (5.7)] 
Properties of RAT): 

CHAP. 61 
ANALYSIS AND PROCESSING O F  RANDOM PROCESSES 
21 1 
Property 3 [Eq. (6.15)J is easily obtained by setting z = 0 in Eq. (6.12). If we assume that X(t) is a 
voltage waveform across a 1-Q resistor, then E[X2(t)] is the average value of power delivered to the 
1-Q resistor by X(t). Thus, E [ x ~ ( ~ ) ]  
is often called the average power of X(t). Properties 1 and 2 are 
verified in Prob. 6.13. 
In case of a discrete-time random process X(n), the autocorrelation function of X(n) is defined by 
Rx(k) = E[X(n)X(n + k)] 
(6.1 6) 
Various properties of Rx(k) similar to those of RX(z) can be obtained by replacing z by k in Eqs. (6.13) 
to (6.15). 
B. Cross-Correlation Functions 
The cross-correlation function of two continuous-time jointly WSS random processes X(t) and 
Y(t) is defined by 
Properties of R A T )  : 
These properties are verified in Prob. 6.14. Two processes X(t) and Y(t) are called (mutually) orthog- 
onal if 
RXy(z) = 0 
for all z 
(6.21) 
Similarly, the cross-correlation function of two discrete-time jointly WSS random processes X(n) and 
Y(n) is defined by 
Rxy(k) = E[X(n) Y(n + k)] 
(6.22) 
and various properties of Rxy(k) similar to those of RXy(z) can be obtained by replacing z by k in Eqs. 
(6.18) to (6.20). 
C. Power Spectral Density: 
The power spectral density (or power spectrum) Sx(o) of a continuous-time random process X(t) is 
defined as the Fourier transform of RX(z): 
Thus, taking the inverse Fourier transform of Sx(o), we obtain 
Equations (6.23) and (6.24) are known as the Wiener-Khinchin relations. 
Properties of SAo) : 
1. SAo) is real and Sx(o) 2 0.

ANALYSIS AND PROCESSING OF RANDOM PROCESSES 
[CHAP 6 
Similarly, the power spectral density Sx(Q) of a discrete-time random process X(n) is defined as the 
Fourier transform of Rx(k): 
Thus, taking the inverse Fourier transform of Sx(Q), we obtain 
Properties of S#): 
1. Sx(Q + 271) = Sx(R) 
2. Sx(Q) is real and Sx(Q) 2 0. 
3. sx( - n )  = s,(q 
Note that property 1 [Eq. (6.30)] follows from the fact that e-jm is periodic with period 271. Hence it 
is sufficient to define SAR) only in the range (-n, n). 
D. Cross Power Spectral Densities: 
The cross power spectral density (or cross power spectrum) Sxy(w) of two continuous-time random 
processes X(t) and Y(t) is defined as the Fourier transform of RXy(z): 
Thus, taking the inverse Fourier transform of Sxdo), we get 
Properties of S,(o) : 
Unlike Sx(o), which is a real-valued function of o ,  Sxy(o), in general, is a complex-valued func- 
tion. 
Similarly, the cross power spectral density S,dQ) of two discrete-time random processes X(n) and 
Y(n) is defined as the Fourier transform of Rxy(k): 
Thus, taking the inverse Fourier transform of Sxy(R), we get 

CHAP. 61 
ANALYSIS AND PROCESSING OF RANDOM PROCESSES 
Properties of SAC&) 
: 
Unlike S,(SZ), which is a real-valued function of w, Sxy(Q), in general, is a complex-valued func- 
tion. 
6.4 WHITE NOISE 
A continuous-time white noise process, W(t), is a WSS zero-mean continuous-time random 
process whose autocorrelation function is given by 
where 6(2) is a unit impulse function (or Dirac 6 function) defined by 
where @(r) is any function continuous at z = 0. Taking the Fourier transform of Eq. (6.43), we obtain 
which indicates that X(t) has a constant power spectral density (hence the name white noise). Note 
that the average power of W(t) is not finite. 
Similarly, a WSS zero-mean discrete-time random process W(n) is called a discrete-time white noise 
if its autocorrelation function is given by 
where S(k) is a unit impulse sequence (or unit sample sequence) defined by 
Taking the Fourier transform of Eq. (6.46), we obtain 
Again the power spectral density of W(n) is a constant. Note that Sw(R + 2n) = Sw(Q) and the 
average power of W(n) is o2 = Var[W(n)], which is finite. 
6.5 RESPONSE OF LINEAR SYSTEMS TO RANDOM INPUTS 
A. 
Linear Systems: 
A system is a mathematical model of a physical process that relates the input (or excitation) 
signal x to the output (or response) signal y. Then the system is viewed as a transformation (or 
mapping) of x into y. This transformation is represented by the operator T as (Fig. 6-1) 
If x and y are continuous-time signals, then the system is called a continuous-time system, and if x 
and y are discrete-time signals, then the system is called a discrete-time system. If the operator T is a

[CHAP 6 
System

Fig. 6-1 
linear operator satisfying 
T{xl + x,} = Tx, + Tx, = y, + y2 
(Additivity) 
T{ax} = aTx = ay 
(Homogeneity) 
where a is a scalar number, then the system represented by T is called a linear system. A system is 
called time-invariant if a time shift in the input signal causes the same time shift in the output signal. 
Thus, for a continuous-time system, 
for any value of t o ,  and for a discrete-time system, 
for any integer no. For a continuous-time linear time-invariant (LTI) system, Eq. (6.49) can be 
expressed as 
is known as the impulse response of a continuous-time LTI system. The right-hand side of Eq. (6.50) is 
commonly called the convolution integral of h(t) and x(t), denoted by h(t) * x(t). For a discrete-time 
LTI system, Eq. (6.49) can be expressed as 
where 
is known as the impulse response (or unit sample response) of a discrete-time LTI system. The right- 
hand side of Eq. (6.52) is commonly called the convolution sum of h(n) and x(n), denoted by h(n) * x(n). 
B. Response of a Continuous-Time Linear System to Random Input: 
When the input to a continuous-time linear system represented by Eq. (6.49) is a random process 
{X(t), t E T,}, then the output will also be a random process {Y(t), t E Ty); that is, 
For any input sample function xi(t), the corresponding output sample function is 
If the system is LTI, then by Eq. (6.50), we can write 
Y(t) = J::(l)X(t 
- 4 d i  
Note that Eq. (6.56) is a stochastic integral. Then 

CHAP. 61 
ANALYSIS AND PROCESSING OF RANDOM PROCESSES 
The autocorrelation function of Y(t) is given by (Prob. 6.24) 
If the input X(t) is WSS, then from Eq. (6.57), 
where H(0) = H(o)I,=, and H(o) is the frequency response of the system defined by the Fourier 
transform of h(t); that is, 
The autocorrelation function of Y(t) is, from Eq. (6.58), 
Setting s = t + z, we get 
From Eqs. (6.59) and (6.62), we see that the output Y(t) is also WSS. Taking the Fourier transform of 
Eq. (6.62), the power spectral density of Y(t) is given by (Prob. 6.25) 
Thus, we obtain the important result that the power spectral density of the output is the product of the 
power spectral density of the input and the magnitude squared of the frequency response of the system. 
When the autocorrelation function of the output Ry(z) is desired, it is easier to determine the power 
spectral density S,(o) and then evaluate the inverse Fourier transform (Prob. 6.26). Thus, 
By Eq. (6.15), the average power in the output Y(t) is 
C. Response of a Discrete-Time Linear System to Random Input: 
When the input to a discrete-time LTI system is a discrete-time random process X(n), then by Eq. 
(6.52), the output Y(n) is 
The autocorrelation function of Y(n) is given by 

216 
ANALYSIS AND PROCESSING OF RANDOM PROCESSES 
[CHAP 6 
When X(n) is WSS, then from Eq. (6.66), 
where H(0) = H(Q)I,=, and H(Q) is the frequency response of the system defined by the Fourier 
transform of h(n) : 
The autocorrelation function of Y(n) is, from Eq. (6.67), 
Setting m = n + k, we get 
From Eqs. (6.68) and (6.71), we see that the output Y(n) is also WSS. Taking the Fourier transform of 
Eq. (6.71), the power spectral density of Y(n) is given by (Prob. 6.28) 
which is the same as Eq. (6.63). 
6.6 FOURIER SERIES AND KARHUNEN-LOEVE EXPANSIONS 
A. Stochastic Periodicity : 
A continuous-time random process X(t) is said to be m.s. periodic with period T if 
E([X(t + T) - X(t)I2) = 0 
(6.73) 
If X(t) is WSS, then X(t) is m.s. periodic if and only if its autocorrelation function is periodic with 
period T; that is, 
RX(z + T) = RX(z) 
(6.74) 
B. Fourier Series : 
Let X(t) be a WSS random process with periodic RX(z) having period T. Expanding RX(z) into a 
Fourier series, we obtain 
where 
Let T(t) be expressed as 

CHAP. 61 
ANALYSIS AND PROCESSING OF RANDOM PROCESSES 
where X, are r.v.'s given by 
Note that, in general, Xn are complex-valued r.v.'s. For complex-valued r.v.'s, the correlation between 
two r.v.'s X and Y is defined by E(XY*). Then 2(t) is called the m.s. Fourier series of X(t) such that 
(Prob. 6.34) 
Furthermore, we have (Prob. 6.33) 
C. Karhunen-Ldve Expansion 
Consider a random process X(t) which is not periodic. Let *(t) be expressed as 
where a set of functions {+,(t)) is orthonormal on an interval (0, T) such that 
and X, are r.v.'s given by 
Then %(t) is called the Karhunen-Lokve expansion of X(t) such that (Prob. 6.38) 
Let Rdt, s) be the autocorrelation function of X(t), and consider the following integral equation : 
where A, and 4,(t) are called the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions of the integral 
equation (6.86). It is known from the theory of integral equations that if RJt, s) is continuous, then 
4,(t) of Eq. (6.86) are orthonormal as in Eq. (6.83), and they satisfy the following identity: 
which is known as Mercer's theorem. 
With the above results, we can show that Eq. (6.85) is satisfied and the coeficient X, are orthog- 
onal r.v.'s (Prob. 6.37); that is,

ANALYSIS AND PROCESSING OF RANDOM PROCESSES 
[CHAP 6 
6.7 FOURIER TRANSFORM OF RANDOM PROCESSES 
A. Continuous-Time Random Processes: 
The Fourier transform of a continuous-time random process X(t) is a random process x(.(o) given 
by 
X(W) = J_bX(ne-jmt dt 
(6.89) 
which is the stochastic integral, and the integral is interpreted as an m.s. limit; that is, 
Note that g(w) is a complex random process. Similarly, the inverse Fourier transform 
is also a stochastic integral and should also be interpreted in the m.s. sense. The properties of 
continuous-time Fourier transforms (Appendix B) also hold for random processes (or random 
signals). For instance, if Y(t) is the output of a continuous-time LTI system with input X(t), then 
where H(o) is the frequency response of the system. 
Let b d q ,  03 be the two-dimensional Fourier transform of Rx(t, s); that is, 
Then the autocorrelation function of z(w) is given by (Prob. 6.41) 
If X(t) is a WSS random process with autocorrelation function Rx(t, s) = Rx(t - s) = R,(z) and power 
spectral density SAW), then (Prob. 6.42) 
Equation (6.99) shows that the Fourier transform of a WSS random process is nonstationary white 
noise. 
B. Discrete-Time Random Processes: 
The Fourier transform of a discrete-time random process X(n) is a random process X(0) given by 
(in m.s. sense) 

CHAP. 63 
ANALYSIS AND PROCESSING O F  RANDOM PROCESSES 
Similarly, the inverse Fourier transform 
should also be interpreted in the m.s. sense. Note that z ( Q  + 2n) = z(Q) and the properties of 
discrete-time Fourier transforms (Appendix B) also hold for discrete-time random signals. For 
instance, if Y(n) is the output of a discrete-time LTI system with input X(n), then 
where H(i2) is the frequency response of the system. 
Let &al, Q,) be the two-dimensional Fourier transform of Rx(n, m): 
Then the autocorrelation function of R(Q) is given by (Prob. 6.44) 
If X(n) is a WSS random process with autocorrelation function Rx(n, m) = R,(n - m) = R,(k) and 
power spectral density Sx(Q), then 
Equation (6.106) shows that the Fourier transform of a discrete-time WSS random process is nonsta- 
tionary white noise. 
Solved Problems 
CONTINUITY, DIFFERENTIATION, INTEGRATION 
6.1. 
Show that the random process X(t) is m.s. continuous if and only if its autocorrelation function 
Rx(t, s) is continuous. 
We can write 
Thus, if Rx(t, s) is continuous, then

and X(t) is m-s. continuous. Next, consider 
Rx(t + El, t + E2) - RX(t, t) = E{[X(t + El) - X(t)][X(t + E2) - X(t)]) 
+ E([X(t + 8,) - X(t)lX(t)) + E([X(t + 6,) - X(t)]X(t)) 
Applying Cauchy-Schwarz inequality (3.97) (Prob. 3.33, we obtain 
Rx(t + El, t + E2) - Rx(t, t) 2 (E{[X(t + E,) - X(t)12) E{[x(~ + c2) - ~ ( t ) ] ~ ) ) " ~

We have 
Var[X(t + E) - X(t)] = E([X(t + E) - X(t)I2} - (E[X(t + E) - ~(t)])' 2 0 
Thus 
E([X(t + E )  - X(t)I2) 2 (E[X(t + E) - X(t)])2 = [px(t + E )  - px(t)12 
If X(t) is m.s. continuous, then as E -+ 0, the left-hand side of the above expression approaches zero. Thus

Show that the Wiener process X(t) is m.s. continuous. 
From Eq. (5.64), the autocorrelation function of the Wiener process X(t) is given by

Show that every m.s. continuous random process is continuous in probability. 
A random process X(t) is continuous in probability if, for every t and a > 0 (see Prob. 5.62), 
lirn P{ I X(t + E) - X(t) I > a) = 0 
e+O 
Applying Chebyshev inequality (2.97) (Prob. 2.37), we have 
Now, if X(t) is m.s. continuous, then the right-hand side goes to 0 as E -* 0, which implies that the left-hand 
side must also go to 0 as E -+ 0. Thus, we have proved that if X(t) is m.s. continuous, then it is also 
continuous in probability.

and by Eq. (6.1 1 I ) ,  we obtain 
Thus, we conclude that X(t) has a m.s. derivative X1(t) if a2Rx(t, s)/at ds exists at s = t. If X(t) is WSS, then 
the above conclusion is equivalent to the existence of a2 RX(z)/Z22 at 7 = 0.

Note that although a m.s. derivative does not exist for the Wiener process, we can define a generalized 
derivative of the Wiener process (see Prob. 6.20). 
6.10. Show that if X(t) is a normal random process for which the m.s. derivative Xt(t) exists, then Xf(t) 
is also a normal random process. 
Let X(t) be a normal random process. Now consider 
Then, n r.v.'s Y,(t,), I&), 
. . . , Y,(t,,) are given by a linear transformation of the jointly normal r.v.'s X(t,), 
X(t, + E), X(t2), X(t2 + E), . . . , X(t,), X(tn + E). It then follows by the result of Prob. 5.60 that Y,(t,), Y,(t,), 
. . . , Y,(tn) are jointly normal r.v.'s, and hence Y,(t) is a normal random process. Thus, we conclude that the 
m.s. derivative X'(t), which is the limit of Y,(t) as E + 0, is also a normal random process, since m.s. con- 
vergence implies convergence in probability (see Prob. 6.5). 
6.11. Show that the m.s. integral of a random process X(t) exists if the following integral exists: 
A m.s. integral of X(t) is defined by [Eq. (641 
Again using the Cauchy criterion, the m.s. integral Y(t) of X(t) exists if

By Eq. (6.1 7), 
Rxy(-r) = E[X(t)Y(t - T ) ]  
Setting t - z = s, we get 
Rxu(-r) = E[X(s + ~ ) Y ( s ) ]  
= E[Y(s)X(s + T)] = RYx(z) 
Next, from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, Eq. (3.97) (Prob. 3.35), it follows that

ANALYSIS AND PROCESSING OF RANDOM PROCESSES 
From Eq. (6.23) and expanding the exponential, we have 
Since R,(-z) = RX(z), Rx(z) cos wz is an even function of z and RX(z) sin o z  is an odd function of z, and 
hence the imaginary term in Eq. (6.127) vanishes and we obtain 
(6.2 28) 
which indicates that Sx(o) is real. Since cos(-or) = cos(oz), it follows that 
which indicates that the power spectrum of a real random process X(t) is an even function of frequency. 
6.17. 
Consider the random process 
where X(t) is a Poisson process with rate A. Thus Y(t) starts at Y(0) = 1 and switches back and 
forth from + 1 to - 1 at random Poisson times q ,  as shown in Fig. 6-4. The process Y(t) is 
known as the semirandom telegraph signal because its initial value Y(0) = 1 is not random. 
(a) Find the mean of Y(t). 
(b) Find the autocorrelation function of Y(t). 
(a) We have 
1 
if X(t) is even 
Y(t) = - 1 
if X(t) is odd 
Thus, using Eq. (5.59, we have 
P[Y(t) = 11 = P[X(t) = even integer] 
P[Y(t) = - 11 = P[X(t) = odd integer] 
Fig. 6-4 Semirandom telegraph signal.

py(t) = E[Y(t)] = (1)P[Y(t) = 11 + (- I)P[Y(t) = - 11 
= e-*'(cash I t  - sinh It) = ePzAt 
(b) Similarly, since Y(t)Y(t + z) = 1 if there are an even number of events in (t, t + z) for z > 0 and 
Y(t)Y(t + z) = - 1 if there are an odd number of events, then for t > 0 and t + z > 0,

which indicates that R,(t, t + z) = RY(z), and by Eq. (6.13), 
Note that since E[Y(t)] is not a constant, Y(t) is not WSS. 
6.18. Consider the random process 
where Y(t) is the semirandom telegraph signal of Prob. 6.17 and A is a r.v. independent of Y(t) 
and takes on the values + 1 with equal probability. The process Z(t) is known as the random 
telegraph signal. 
(a) Show that Z(t) is WSS. 
(b) Find the power spectral density of Z(t). 
(a) Since E(A) = 0 and E(A2) = 1, the mean of Z(t) is 
and the autocorrelation of Z(t) is 
Thus, using Eq. (6.130), we obtain 
Thus, we see that Z(t) is WSS. 
(b) Taking the Fourier transform of Eq. (6.132) (see Appendix B), we see that the power spectrum of Z(t) is 
given by 
6.19. Let X(t) and Y(t) be both zero-mean and WSS random processes. Consider the random process 
Z(t) defined by 
(a) Determine the autocorrelation function and the power spectral density of Z(t), (i) if X(t) and 
Y(t) are jointly WSS; (ii) if X(t) and Y(t) are orthogonal. 
(b) Show that if X(t) and Y(t) are orthogonal, then the mean square of Z(t) is equal to the sum 
of the mean squares of X(t) and Y(t). 

CHAP. 63 
ANALYSIS AND PROCESSING OF RANDOM PROCESSES 
(i) If X(t) and Y(t) are jointly WSS, then we have 
RzW = RXW + RXYW + R,x(z) + RY(4 
where z = s - t. Taking the Fourier transform of the above expression, we obtain 
Sz(4 = Sxf4 + SXY(4 + SYX(4 + SY(W 
(ii) If X(t) and Y(t) are orthogonal [Eq. (6.21)], 
RXY(4 = R,,(z) = 0 
Then 
Rz(d = R x ~ )  
+ R&) 
SZ(4 = SAo) + SY(4 
(b) Setting z = 0 in Eq. (6.1 34a), and using Eq. (6.15), we get 
E[Z2(t)] = E[X2(t)] + E[ Y2(t)] 
which indicates that the mean square of Z(t) is equal to the sum of the mean squares of X(t) and Y(t). 
WHITE NOISE 
6.20. 
Using the notion of generalized derivative, show that the generalized derivative X'(t) of the 
Wiener process X(t) is a white noise. 
From Eq. (5.64), 
Rx(t, s) = a2 min(t, s) 
and from Eq. (6.1 19) (Prob. 6.9), we have 
Now, using the 6 function, the generalized derivative of a unit step function u(t) is given by 
Applying the above relation to Eq. (6.135), we obtain 
which is, by Eq. (6.116) (Prob. 6.7), the autocorrelation function of the generalized derivative X'(t) of the 
Wiener process X(t); that is, 
where z = t -- s. Thus, by definition (6.43), we see that the generalized derivative X1(t) of the Wiener process 
X(t) is a white noise. 
Recall that the Wiener process is a normal process and its derivative is also normal (see Prob. 6.10). 
Hence, the generalized derivative X'(t) of the Wiener process is called white normal (or white gaussian) noise. 
6.21. 
Let X(t) be a Poisson process with rate 1. Let 
Y(t) = X(t) - At 
Show that the generalized derivative Y'(t) of Y(t) is a white noise. 
Since Y(t) = X(t) - At, we have formally 
r ( t )  = xl(t) - n

Then 
Ry*(t,

= E[Xf(t)Xr(s) - LX1(s) - IXr(t) + 12] 
= E [Xr(t)X1(s)] - LE[Xf(s)] - IEIX1(t)] + L2 
Now, from Eqs. (5.56) and (5.60), we have 
Thus 
EIX1(t)] = A 
and 
E[Xr(s)] = 1 
(6.1 41) 
and from Eqs. (6.7) and (6.137), 
Substituting Eq. (6.1 41) into Eq. (6.1 39), we obtain 
Substituting Eqs. (6.141) and (6.142) into Eq. (6.140), we get 
Hence we see that Y1(t) is a zero-mean WSS random process, and by definition (6.43), Y'(t) is a white noise 
with a2 = I. The process Y1(t) is known as the Poisson white noise. 
6.22. Let X(t) be a white normal noise. Let 
(a) Find the autocorrelation function of Y(t). 
(b) Show that Y(t) is the Wiener process. 
(a) From Eq. (6.1 37) of Prob. 6.20, 
Thus, by Eq. (6.1 l), the autocorrelation function of Y(t) is 
(b) Comparing Eq. (6.145) and Eq. (5.64), we see that Y(t) has the same autocorrelation function as the 
Wiener process. In addition, Y(t) is normal, since X(t) is a normal process and Y(0) = 0. Thus, we conclude 
that Y(t) is the Wiener process. 
6.23. Let Y(n) = X(n) + W(n), where X(n) = A (for all n) and A is a r.v. with zero mean and variance 
a:, 
and W(n) is a discrete-time white noise with average power a2. It is also assumed that X(n) 
and W(n) are independent. 
(a) Show that Y(n) is WSS.

(b) Find the power spectral density S,(Q of Y(n). 
(a) The mean of Y(n) is 
E[Y(n)] = E[X(n)] + E[W(n)] = E(A) + E[W(n)] = 0 
The autocorrelation function of Y(n) is 
Ry(n, n + k) = E{[X(n) + W(n)][X(n + k) + W(n + k)]) 
= E[X(n)x(n + k)] + ECX(n)]E[W(n + k)] + E[W(n)]E[X(n + k)] + E[W(n) W(n + k)] 
= E(A2) + Rw(k) = a,' + a26(k) = Ry(k) 
(6.1 46) 
Thus Y(n) is WSS.

Chapter 7 
Estimation Theory 
7.1 INTRODUCTION 
In this chapter, we present a classical estimation theory. There are two basic types of estimation 
problems. In the first type, we are interested in estimating the parameters of one or more r.v.'s, and in 
the second type, we are interested in estimating the value of an inaccessible r.v. Y in terms of the 
observation of an accessible r.v. X. 
7.2 PARAMETER ESTIMATION 
Let X be a r.v. with pdf f (x) and X,, . . . , X, a set of n independent r.v.'s each with pdf f (x). The 
set of r.v.'s (XI, . . . , X,) is called a random sample (or sample vector) of size n of X. Any real-valued 
function of a random sample s(Xl, . . . , X,) is called a statistic. 
Let X be a r.v. with pdf f (x; 8) which depends on an unknown parameter 8. Let (XI, . . . , X,) be a 
random sample of X. In this case, the joint pdf of X,, . . . , X, is given by 
n 
f(x; 8) = f ( ~ l 7  
xn; 8) = n/(xi; 8) 
i =  1 
(7.1) 
where x,, . . . , x, are the values of the observed data taken from the random sample. 
An estimator of 8 is any statistic s(X,, . . . , X,), denoted as 
O = s(X,, . . , Xn) 
(7.2) 
For a particular set of observations X ,  = x,, . . . , Xn = x,, the value of the estimator s(x,, . . . , x,) will 
be called an estimate of 8 and denoted by 8. Thus an estimator is a r.v. and an estimate is a particular 
realization of it. It is not necessary that an estimate of a parameter be one single value; instead, the 
estimate could be a range of values. Estimates which specify a single value are called point estimates, 
and estimates which specify a range of values are called interval estimates. 
7.3 PROPERTIES OF POINT ESTIMATORS 
A. Unbiased Estimators: 
An estimator O = s(X,, . . . , Xn) is said to be an unbiased estimator of the parameter 8 if 
E(0) = 8 
for all possible values of 8. If O is an unbiased estimator, then its mean square error is given by 
EL(@ - 8)2] = E{[0 - E(@)]~) = Var(0) 
That is, its mean square error equals its variance. 
B. Efficient Estimators: 
An estimator 0, is said to be a more eflcient estimator of the parameter 8 than the estimator O, 
if 
1. 0, and 0, are both unbiased estimators of 8. 

ESTIMATION THEORY 
[CHAP 7 
The estimator OM, = s(X,, . . . , X,) is said to be a most eficient (or minimum variance) unbiased 
estimator of the parameter 8 if 
1. It is an unbiased estimator of 8. 
2. Var(O,,) 
5 Var(O) for all O. 
C. Consistent Estimators: 
The estimator On of 8 based on a random sample of size n is said to be consistent if for any small 
E > 0, 
lim P(I0, - 81 < e) = 1 
n+ m 
(7.5) 
or equivalently, 
lim P(IOn-812e)=0 
n+ m 
The following two conditions are sufficient to define consistency (Prob. 7.5): 
1. lim E(O,) = 8 
n+ m 
2. lim Var(O,) = 0 
n+ 00 
7.4 MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION 
Let f (x; 8) = f (x,, . . . , x,; 8) denote the joint pmf of the r.v.'s X , ,  . . . , X, when they are discrete, 
and let it be their joint pdf when they are continuous. Let 
L(8) = f(x; 8) = f ( x , ,  ..., x,; 8) 
(7.9) 
Now L(8) represents the likelihood that the values x,, . . . , x, will be observed when 8 is the true value 
of the parameter. Thus L(8) is often referred to as the likelihood function of the random sample. Let 
OM, = s(xl, . . . , x,) be the maximizing value of L(8); that is, 
L(0,,) 
= max L(8) 
e 
Then the maximum-likelihood estimator of 0 is 
OML = s(X1, . . ., x,) 
and OM, is the maximum-likelihood estimate of 8. 
Since L(8) is a product of either pmf s or pdf s, it will always be positive (for the range of possible 
value of 8). Thus In L(8) can always be defined, and in determining the maximizing value of 8, it is 
often useful to use the fact that L(8) and In L(8) have their maximum at the same value of 8. Hence, 
we may also obtain OM, by maximizing In L(8). 
7.5 BAYES' ESTIMATION 
Suppose that the unknown parameter 8 is considered to be a r.v. having some fixed distribution 
or prior pdf f (8). Then f (x; 8) is now viewed as a conditional pdf and written as f (x 1 8), and we can 
express the joint pdf of the random sample (XI, . . . , X,) and 8 as 

CHAP. 71 
ESTIMATION THEORY 
and the marginal pdf of the sample is given by 
where R, is the range of the possible value of 8. The other conditional pdf, 
is referred to as the posterior pdf of 8. Thus the prior pdf f(9) represents our information about 8 
prior to the observation of the outcomes of XI, . . . , X , ,  and the posterior pdf f (8 I x,, . . . , x,) 
rep- 
resents our information about 8 after having observed the sample. 
The conditional mean of 8, defined by 
is called the Bayes' estimate of 8, and 
OB = E(8 I XI, . . . , X,) 
is called the Bayes' estimator of 13. 
7.6 MEAN SQUARE ESTIMATION 
In this section, we deal with the second type of estimation problem-that 
is, estimating the value 
of an inaccessible r.v. Y in terms of the observation of an accessible r.v. X. In general, the estimator P 
of Y is given by a function of X, g(X). Then Y - P = Y - g(X) is called the estimation error, and 
there is a cost associated with this error, C[Y - g(X)]. We are interested in finding the function g(X) 
that minimizes this cost. When X and Y are continuous r.v.'s, the mean square (m.s.) error is often 
used as the cost function, 
It can be shown that the estimator of Y given by (Prob. 7.17), 
is the best estimator in the sense that the m.s. error defined by Eq. (7.1 7) is a minimum. 
7.7 LINEAR MEAN SQUARE ESTIMATION 
Now consider the estimator P of Y given by 
P = g(X) = a x  + b 
We would like to find the values of a and b such that the m.s. error defined by 
e = E[(Y - a2] 
= E([Y - (aX + b)I2} 
is minimum. We maintain that a and b must be such that (Prob. 7.20) 
E{[Y - (ax + b)]X} = 0 
and a and b are given by 

250 
ESTIMATION THEORY 
[CHAP 7 
and the minimum m.s. error em is (Prob. 7.22) 
where a,, 
= Cov(X, Y) and p,, is the correlation coefficient of X and Y. Note that Eq. (7.21) states 
that the optimum linear m.s. estimator p =  a x  + 6 of Y is such that the estimation error Y - P = Y - 
(ax + b) is orthogonal to the observation X. This is known as the orthogonality principle. The line 
y = ax + b is often called a regression line. 
Next, we consider the estimator ? of Y with a linear combination of the random sample 
(XI, . - , Xn) by 
Again, we maintain that in order to produce the linear estimator with the minimum m.s. error, the 
coefficients ai must be such that the following orthogonality conditions are satisfied (Prob. 7.35): 
Solving Eq. (7.25) for ai, we obtain

Since the integrands above are positive, the m.s. error e is minimum if the inner integrand,

The last two terms on the right-hand side are zero when Eqs. (7.68) and (7.69) are satisfied, and the second

Decision Theory 
8.1 INTRODUCTION 
There are many situations in which we have to make decisions based on observations or data 
that are random variables. The theory behind the solutions for these situations is known as decision 
theory or hypothesis testing. In communication or radar technology, decision theory or hypothesis 
testing is known as (signal) detection theory. In this chapter we present a brief review of the binary 
decision theory and various decision tests. 
8.2 HYPOTHESIS TESTING 
A. Definitions: 
A statistical hypothesis is an assumption about the probability law of r.v.'s. Suppose we observe a 
random sample (XI, . . . , X,) of a r.v. X whose pdf f (x; 0) = f (x,, . . . , x,; 8) depends on a parameter 8. 
We wish to test the assumption 8 = 8, against the assumption 8 = 8,. The assumption 8 = 8, is 
denoted by H, and is called the null hypothesis. The assumption 8 = 8, is denoted by H, and is called 
the alternative hypothesis. 
H,: 
8 = 8, 
(Null hypothesis) 
H, : 8 = 8, (Alternative hypothesis) 
A hypothesis is called simple if all parameters are specified exactly. Otherwise it is called compos- 
ite. Thus, suppose H,: 0 = 8, and H, : 8 # 0,; then H, is simple and H, is composite. 
B. Hypothesis Testing and Types of Errors: 
Hypothesis testing is a decision process establishing the validity of a hypothesis. We can think of 
the decision process as dividing the observation space Rn (Euclidean n-space) into two regions R, and 
R,. Let x = (x,, . . . , x,) be the observed vector. Then if x E R,, we will decide on H,; if x E R,, we 
decide on H,. The region R, is known as the acceptance region and the region R, as the rejection (or 
critical) region (since the null hypothesis is rejected). Thus, with the observation vector (or data), one 
of the following four actions can happen: 
1. H, true;accept H, 
2. H, true; reject H, (or accept H,) 
3. H, true; accept H, 
4. H, true; reject H, (or accept H,) 
The first and third actions correspond to correct decisions, and the second and fourth actions corre- 
spond to errors. The errors are classified as 
1. Type I error: Reject H, (or accept H,) when H, is true. 
2. Type I1 error: Reject H, (or accept H,) when H, is true. 
Let PI and PI, denote, respectively, the probabilities of Type I and Type I1 errors: 

CHAP. 81 
DECISION THEORY 
265 
where Di (i = 0, 1) denotes the event that the decision is made to accept Hi. PI is often denoted by a 
and is known as the level of signijcance, and PI, is denoted by fl and (1 - /3) is known as the power of 
the test. Note that since a and /? represent probabilities of events from the same decision problem, 
they are not independent of each other or of the sample size n. It would be desirable to have a 
decision process such that both a and fl will be small. However, in general, a decrease in one type of 
error leads to an increase in the other type for a fixed sample size (Prob. 8.4). The only way to 
simultaneously reduce both type of errors is to increase the sample size (Prob. 8.5). One might also 
attach some relative importance (or cost) to the four possible courses of action and minimize the total 
cost of the decision (see Sec. 8.3D). 
The probabilities of correct decisions (actions 1 and 3) may he expressed as 
In radar signal detection, the two hypotheses are 
H, : No target exists 
HI : Target is present 
In this case, the probability of a Type I error PI = P(Dl I H,) is often referred to as the false-alarm 
probability (denoted by P,), the probability of a Type I1 error PI, = P(Do I HI) as the miss probability 
(denoted by P,), 
and P(Dl (HI) as the detection probability (denoted by PD). The cost of failing to 
detect a target cannot be easily determined. In general we set a value of P, which is acceptable and 
seek a decision test that constrains P, to this value while maximizing P, (or equivalently minimizing 
P,). This test is known as the Neyman-Pearson test (see Sec. 8.3C). 
8.3 DECISION TESTS 
A. 
Maximum-Likelihood Test : 
Let x be the observation vector and P(x I Hi), i = 0.1, denote the probability of observing x given 
that Hi 
was true. In the maximum-likelihood test, the decision regions R, and R, are selected as 
Thus, the maximum-likelihood 
Ro = {x: P(x I H,) > P(x ( HI)} 
Rl = (x: P(x I Ho) < P(x I HI)) 
test can be expressed as 
if P(x ( H,) > P(x I HI) 
d(x)={i: 
ifP(xHo)<P(xHl) 
The above decision test can be rewritten as 
If we define the likelihood ratio A(x) as 
then the maximum-likelihood test (8.7) can be expressed as 

266 
DECISION THEORY 
[CHAP. 8 
which is called the likelihood ratio test, and 1 is called the threshold value of the test. 
Note that the likelihood ratio A(x) is also often expressed as 
B. MAP Test: 
Let P(Hi (x), i = 0, 1, denote the probability that Hi was true given a particular value of x. The 
conditional probability P(Hi ( x) is called a posteriori (or posterior) probability, that is, a probability 
that is computed after an observation has been made. The probability P(Hi), i = 0, 1, is called a priori 
(or prior) probability. In the maximum a posteriori (MAP) test, the decision regions R, and R, are 
selected as 
R, = (x: P(H, 1 X) > P(Hl I x)) 
R, = {x: P(Ho (x) < P(H, I x)) 
Thus, the MAP test is given by 
which can be rewritten as 
Using Bayes' rule [Eq. (1.42)], Eq. (8.1 3) reduces to 
Using the likelihood ratio A(x) defined in Eq. (8.8)' the MAP test can be expressed in the following 
likelihood ratio test as 
where q = P(Ho)/P(Hl) is the threshold value for the MAP test. Note that when P(H,) = P(H,), the 
maximum-likelihood test is also the MAP test. 
C. Neyman-Pearson Test : 
As we mentioned before, it is not possible to simultaneously minimize both a(= PI) and fl(= P,). 
The Neyman-Pearson test provides a workable solution to this problem in that the test minimizes fl 
for a given level of a. Hence, the Neyman-Pearson test is the test which maximizes the power of the 
test 1 - /? for a given level of significance a. In the Neyman-Pearson test, the critical (or rejection) 
region R, is selected such that 1 - fl = 1 - P(D, ( HI) = P(Dl I HI) is maximum subject to the con- 
straint a = P(D, I H,) = a,. This is a classical problem in optimization: maximizing a function subject 
to a constraint, which can be solved by the use of Lagrange multiplier method. We thus construct the 
objective function 
J = (1 - fl) - A(a - a,) 
(8.1 6) 
where 1 2 0 is a Lagrange multiplier. Then the critical region R, is chosen to maximize J. It can be 
shown that the Neyman-Pearson test can be expressed in terms of the likelihood ratio test as 

CHAP. 8) 
DECISION THEORY 
(Prob. 8.8) 
where the threshold value q of the test is equal to the Lagrange multiplier A, which is chosen to satisfy 
the contraint a = a,. 
D. Bayes' Test : 
Let Cij be the cost associated with (D, , Hi), which denotes the event that we accept Hi when Hi 
is 
true. Then the average cost, which is known as the Bayes' risk, can be written as 
where P(Di, Hi) denotes the probability that we accept Hi when H j  is true. By Bayes' rule (1.42), we 
have 
In general, we assume that 
since it is reasonable to assume that the cost of making an incorrect decision is higher than the cost of 
making a correct decision. The test that minimizes the average cost e is called the Bayes' test, and it 
can be expressed in terms of the likelihood ratio test as (Prob. 8.10) 
Note that when C,, - Coo = Col - Cll , the Bayes' test (8.21) and 
E. Minimum Probability of Error Test: 
If we set Coo = Cll = 0 and Col = Clo = 1 in Eq. (8.18), we have 
e = P(Dl, Ho) + P(Do, HI) = P, 
(8.21) 
the MAP test (8.15) are identical. 
which is just the probability of making an incorrect decision. Thus, in this case, the Bayes' test yields 
the minimum probability of error, and Eq. (8.21) becomes 
We see that the minimum probability of error test is the same as the MAP test. 
F. Minimax Test : 
We have seen that the Bayes' test requires the a priori probabilities P(Ho) and P(Hl). Frequently, 
these probabilities are not known. In such a case, the Bayes' test cannot be applied, and the following 
minimax (min-max) test may be used. In the minimax test, we use the Bayes' test which corresponds 
to the least favorable P(Ho) (Prob. 8.12). In the minimax test, the critical region RT is defined by 

268 
DECISION THEORY 
[CHAP. 8 
for all R, # RT. In other words, RT is the critical region which yields the minimum Bayes' risk for the 
least favorable P(Ho). Assuming that the minimization and maximization operations are interchange- 
able, then we have 
min max C[P(H,), R,] = max min e[P(Ho), R,] 
R I  
PWo) 
PWo) 
R I  
The minimization of C[P(H,), R,] with respect to R, is simply the Bayes' test, so that 
min C[P(H,), R,] = C*[P(H,)] 
R 1 
where C*[P(H,)] is the minimum Bayes' risk associated with the a priori probability P(H,). Thus, Eq. 
(8.25) states that we may find the minimax test by finding the Bayes' test for the least favorable P(Ho), 
that is, the P(H,) which maximizes C[P(H,)].

HYPOTHESIS TESTING 
8.1. 
Suppose a manufacturer of memory chips observes that the probability of chip failure is p = 0.05. 
A new procedure is introduced to improve the design of chips. To test this new procedure, 200 
chips could be produced using this new procedure and tested. Let r.v. X denote the number of 
these 200 chips that fail. We set the test rule that we would accept the new procedure if X s 5. 
Let 
H,: 
p = 0.05 
(No change hypothesis) 
H, : p c 0.05 
(Improvement hypothesis) 
Find the probability of a Type I error. 
If we assume that these tests using the new procedure are independent and have the same probability 
of failure on each test, then X is a binomial r.v. with parameters (n, p) = (200, p). We make a Type I error if 
X 5 5 when in fact p = 0.05. Thus, using Eq. (2.37), we have 
Since n is rather large and p is small, these binomial probabilities can be approximated by Poisson prob- 
abilities with IZ = np = 200(0.05) = 10 (see Prob. 2.40). Thus, using Eq. (2.100)' we obtain 
Note that H, is a simple hypothesis but H, is a composite hypothesis.

Consider again the memory chip manufacturing problem of Prob. 8.1. Now let

Now both hypotheses are simple. We make a Type I1 er.ror if X > 5 when in fact p = 0.02. Hence, by 
Eq. (2.37), 
Again using the Poisson approximation with L = np = 200(0.02) = 4, we obtain

(b) Find the probability of a Type I error a. 
(c) Find the probability of a Type I1 error /I (i) when pl = 53 and (ii) when p, = 55. 
(a) Since the test calls for the rejection of H,: p = 50 when 2 2 52, the probability of rejecting H ,  is given 
by 
Now, by Eqs. (4.1 12) and (7.27), we have 
Thus, .X is N(p; 4), and using Eq. (2.55), we obtain 
The function g(p) is known as the power function of the test, and the value of g(p) at p = p,, g(p,), is 
called the power at p,. 
(b) Note that the power at p = 50, g(50), is the probability of rejecting H,: p = 50 when H ,  is true-that 
is, a Type I error. Thus, using Table A (Appendix A), we obtain 
(c) Note that the power at p = p,, g(pl), is the probability of rejecting H,: p = 50 when p = p,. Thus, 
1 - g(p,) is the probability of accepting Ho when p = p,--that is, the probability of a Type I1 error jl. 
(i) Setting p = p, = 53 in Eq. (8.28) and using Table A (Appendix A), we obtain 
(ii) Similarly, for p = p1 = 55 we obtain 
Notice that clearly, the probability of a Type I1 error depends on the value of p,.

reject H, if x 2 c. 
(a) Find the value of c such that the probability of a Type I error a = 0.05. 
(b) Find the probability of a Type I1 error /I when p, = 55 with the modified decision rule. 
(a) Using the result of part (b) in Prob. 8.3, c is selected such that [see Eq. (8.27)J 
a = g(50) = P(x 2 c; p = 50) = 0.05 
However, when p = 50, X = N(50; 4), and [see Eq. (8.2811 
From Table A (Appendix A), we have 0(1.645) = 0.95. Thus 
c - 50 
-- 
2 - 1.645 
and 
c = 50 + 2(1.645) = 53.29 
(b) The power function g(p) with the modified decision rule is 
Setting p = p, = 55 and using Table A (Appendix A), we obtain 
Comparing with the results of Prob. 8.3, we notice that with the change of the decision rule, a is 
reduced from 0.1587 to 0.05, but j3 is increased from 0.0668 to 0.1963. 
8.5. 
Redo Prob. 8.4 for the case where the sample size n = 100. 
(a) With n = 100, we have 
As in part (a) of Prob. 8.4, c is selected so that 
a =  g(50) = P(8 2 c; p = 50) = 0.05 
Since X = N(50; I), we have 
Thus 
c - 50 = 1.645 
and 
c = 51.645 
(b) The power function is 
Setting p = p, = 55 and using Table A (Appendix A), we obtain 
fl = Pn = 1 - g(55) = (D(51.645 - 55) = @(-3.355) x 0.0004

In a simple binary communication system, during every T seconds, one of two possible signals 
s,(t) and s,(t) is transmitted. Our two hypotheses are

We assume that

The communication channel adds noise n(t), which is a zero-mean normal random process with 
variance 1. Let x(t) represent the received signal : 
We observe the received signal x(t) at some instant during each signaling interval. Suppose that 
we received an observation x = 0.6. 
(a) Using the maximum likelihood test, determine which signal is transmitted. 
(b) Find P, and P,, .

Since x  = 0.6 > 4, we determine that signal s,(t) was transmitted.

(b) Find PI and PI,. 
(a) Using the result of Prob. 8.6 and Eq. (8.15), the MAP test is given by 
Taking the natural logarithm of the above expression, we get 
Since x = 0.6 < 1.193, we determine that signal s,(t) was transmitted. 
(b) The decision regions are given by 
Ro = { x :  x < 1.193) = (-MI, 
1.193) 
R1 = {x: x > 1.193) = (1.193, a) 
Thus, by Eqs. (8.1) and (8.2) and using Table A (Appendix A), we obtain 
8.8. 
Derive the Neyman-Pearson test, Eq. (8.1 7). 
From Eq. (8.1 6), the objective function is 
J = (1 - 8) - n(a - a,) = P(Dl ] H I )  - R[P(D, (H,) - a,,] 
(8.29) 
where 1 is an undetermined Lagrange multiplier which is chosen to satisfy the constraint a = a,. Now, we 
wish to choose the critical region R ,  to maximize J. Using Eqs. (8.1) and (8.2), we have

To maximize J by selecting the critical region R,, we select x E R, such that the integrand in Eq. (8.30) is 
positive. Thus R ,  is given by 
and the Neyman-Pearson test is given by 
and 1 is determined such that the constraint 
is satisfied.

Consider the binary communication system of Prob. 8.6 and suppose that we require that a =

Using the Neyman-Pearson test, determine which signal is transmitted when x = 0.6. 
Find PI,. 
Using the result of Prob. 8.6 and Eq. (8.1 7), the Neyman-Pearson test is given by 
Taking the natural logarithm of the above expression, we get 
The critical region R, is thus 
R, = {x: x > $ + In A] 
Now we must determine A such that a = P, = P(D, ( H,) = 0.25. By Eq. (8.1), we have 
Thus 
1 - @(i 
+ In A) = 0.25 
or 
Q(4 + In A) = 0.75 
From Table A (Appendix A), we find that Q(0.674) = 0.75. Thus 
Then the Neyman-Pearson test is 
Since x = 0.6 < 0.674, we determine that signal so(t) was transmitted.

Then, by setting Coo = C , ,  = 0, C,, = 2, and C , ,  = 1 in Eq. (8.19), the minimum Bayes' risk C* can be

Now the value of P(Ho) which maximizes C* can be obtained by setting dC*[P(Ho)J/dP(Ho) equal to zero 
and solving for P(Ho). The result yields P(Ho) = 3. Substituting this value into Eq. (8.34), we obtain the

Queueing Theory 
9.1 INTRODUCTION 
Queueing theory deals with the study of queues (waiting lines). Queues abound in practical situ- 
ations. The earliest use of queueing theory was in the design of a telephone system. Applications of 
queueing theory are found in fields as seemingly diverse as traffic control, hospital management, and 
time-shared computer system design. In this chapter, we present an elementary queueing theory. 
9.2 QUEUEING SYSTEMS 
A. Description: 
A simple queueing system is shown in Fig. 9-1. Customers arrive randomly at an average rate of 
A,. Upon arrival, they are served without delay if there are available servers; otherwise, they are 
made to wait in the queue until it is their turn to be served. Once served, they are assumed to leave 
the system. We will be interested in determining such quantities as the average number of customers 
in the system, the average time a customer spends in the system, the average time spent waiting in the 
queue, etc. 
The description of any queueing system requires the specification of three parts: 
Arrivals + 
1. The arrival process 
2. The service mechanism, such as the number of servers and service-time distribution 
3. The queue discipline (for example, first-come, first-served) 
B. Classification : 
Fig. 9-1 A simple queueing system. 
Queue 
The notation A/B/s/K is used to classify a queueing system, where A specifies the type of arrival 
process, B denotes the service-time distribution, s specifies the number of servers, and K denotes the 
capacity of the system, that is, the maximum number of customers that can be accommodated. If K is 
not specified, it is assumed that the capacity of the system is unlimited. For example, an M/M/2 
queueing system (M stands for Markov) is one with Poisson arrivals (or exponential interarrival time 
distribution), exponential service-time distribution, and 2 servers. An M/G/l queueing system has 
Poisson arrivals, general service-time distribution, and a single server. A special case is the M/D/1 
queueing system, where D stands for constant (deterministic:) service time. Examples of queueing 
systems with limited capacity are telephone systems with limited trunks, hospital emergency rooms 
with limited beds, and airline terminals with limited space in which to park aircraft for loading and 
unloading. In each case, customers who arrive when the systeim is saturated are denied entrance and 
are lost.

L: the average number of customers in the system 
L,: 
the average number of customers waiting in the queue 
L,: 
the average number of customers in service 
W :  the average amount of time that a customer spends in the system 
W,: the average amount of time that a customer spends waiting in the queue 
W,: the average amount of time that a customer spends in service 
Many useful relationships between the above and other quantities of interest can be obtained by 
using the following basic cost identity: 
Assume that entering customers are required to pay an entrance fee (according to some rule) to 
the system. Then we have 
Average rate at which the system earns = A, x average amount an entering customer 
(9.1) 
pays where 1, is the average arrival rate of entering customers 
X(t) 
A, = lim 7 
and X(t) denotes the number of customer arrivals by time t. 
If we assume that each customer pays $1 per unit time while 
L=R,W 
Equation (9.2) is sometimes known as Little's formula. 
Similarly, if we assume that each customer pays $1 
yields 
Lq = A, wq 
in the system, Eq. (9.1) yields 
(9.4 
per unit time while in the queue, Eq. (9.1) 
(9.3) 
If we assume that each customer pays $1 per unit time while in service, Eq. (9.1) yields 
Note that Eqs. (9.2) to (9.4) are valid for almost all queueing systems, regardless of the arrival process, 
the number of servers, or queueing discipline. 
9.3 BIRTH-DEATH PROCESS 
We say that the queueing system is in state S, if there are n customers in the system, including 
those being served. Let N(t) be the Markov process that takes on the value n when the queueing 
system is in state S, with the following assumptions: 
1. If the system is in state S,, it can make transitions only to S,-, or S,+ , , n 2 1 ; that is, either a 
customer completes service and leaves the system or, while the present customer is still being 
serviced, another customer arrives at the system ; from So , the next state can only be S, . 
2. If the system is in state S, at time t, the probability of a transition to Sn+, in the time interval 
(t, t + At) is an At. We refer to a, as the arrival parameter (or the birth parameter). 
3. If the system is in state S, at time t, the probability of a transition to S,-, in the time interval 
(t, t + At) is dn At. We refer to d, as the departure parameter (or the death parameter). 
The process N(t) is sometimes referred to as the birth-death process. 
Let p,(t) be the probability that the queueing system is in state S, at time t; that is, 
Then we have the following fundamental recursive equations for N(t) (Prob. 9.2): 

CHAP. 91 
QUEUEING THEORY 
Assume that in the steady state we have 
and setting pb(t) and pk(t) = 0 in Eqs. (9.6), we obtain the following steady-state recursive equation: 
(an + dn)~n = an-lpn-1 + dn+lpn+l 
n 2 1 
and for the special case with do = 0, 
Equations (9.8) and (9.9) are also known as the steady-state equilibrium equations. The state transition 
diagram for the birth-death process is shown in Fig. 9-2. 
Fig. 9-2 State transition diagram for the birth-death process. 
Solving Eqs. (9.8) and (9.9) in terms of p, , we obtain 
where po can be determined from the fact that 
provided that the summation in parentheses converges to a finite value. 
9.4 THE M/M/1 QUEUEING SYSTEM 
In the M/M/1 queueing system, the arrival process is the Poisson process with rate A (the mean 
arrival rate) and the service time is exponentially distributed with parameter p (the mean service rate). 
Then the process N(t) describing the state of the M/M/1 queueing system at time t is a birth-death 
process with the Following state independent parameters: 
Then from Eqs. (9.1 0) and (9.1 I), we obtain (Prob. 9.3) 
where p = Alp < 1, which implies that the server, on the average, must process the customers faster 
than their average arrival rate; otherwise the queue length (the number of customers waiting in the 
queue) tends to infinity. The ratio p = Alp is sometimes referred to as the trafJic intensity of the

[CHAP. 9 
system. The traffic intensity of the system is defined as 
mean service time 
mean arrival rate 
Traffic intensity = 
- 
- 
mean interarrival time 
mean service rate 
The average number of customers in the system is given by (Prob. 9.4) 
Then, setting A, = 3, in Eqs. (9.2) to (9.4), we obtain (Prob. 9.5) 
9.5 THE M/M/s QUEUEING SYSTEM 
In the M/M/s queueing system, the arrival process is the Poisson process with rate A and each of 
the s servers has an exponential service time with parameter p. In this case, the process N(t) describ- 
ing the state of the M/M/s queueing system at time t is a birth-death process with the following 
parameters : 
Note that the departure parameter d, is state dependent. Then, from Eqs. (9.10) and (9.1 I), we obtain 
(Prob. 9.10) 
where p = A/(+) < 1. Note that t :he ratio p = 
is the traffic intensity of the M/M/s queueing 
system. The average number of customers in the system and the average number of customers in the 
queue are given, respectively, by (Prob. 9.12) 
By Eqs. (9.2) and (9.3), the quantities W and W, are given by 

CHAP. 91 
QUEUEING THEORY 
9.6 THE M/M/l/K QUEUEING SYSTEM 
In the M/M/l/K queueing system, the capacity of the system is limited to K customers. When the 
system reaches its capacity, the effect is to reduce the arrival rate to zero until such time as a cus- 
tomer is served to again make queue space available. Thus, the M/M/l/K queueing system can be 
modeled as a birth-death process with the following parameters : 
Then, from Eqs. (9.1 0) and (9.1 I), we obtain (Pro b. 9.14) 
where p = Alp. It is important to note that it is no longer necessary that the traffic intensity p = R/p 
be less than 1. Customers are denied service when the system is in state K. Since the fraction of 
arrivals that actually enter the system is 1 - p,, the effective arrival rate is given by 
f e  = 4 1  - PK) 
The average number of customers in the system is given by (Prob. 9.15) 
Then, setting A, = A, in Eqs. (9.2) to (9.4), we obtain 
9.7 THE M/M/s/K QUEUEING SYSTEM 
Similarly, the M/M/s/K queueing system can be modeled as a birth-death process with the fol- 
lowing parameters : 
Then, from Eqs. (9.1 0) and (9.1 I), we obtain (Prob. 9.17) 
where p = A&). 
Note that the expression for p, is identical in form to that for the M/M/s system, 
Eq. (9.21). They differ only in the po term. Again, it is not necessary that p = A/(sp) be less than 1. The

9.1. 
Deduce the basic cost identity (9.1). 
Let T be a fixed large number. The amount of money earned by the system by time T can be com- 
puted by multiplying the average rate at which the system earns by the length of time T. On the other 
hand, it can also be computed by multiplying the average amount paid by an entering customer by the 
average number of customers entering by time T, which is equal to AaT, where A, is the average arrival rate 
of entering customers. Thus, we have 
Average rate at which the system earns x T = average amount paid by an entering customer x (JOT) 
Dividing both sides by T (and letting T -, co), 
we obtain Eq. (9.1). 
9.2. 
Derive Eq. (9.6). 
From properties 1 to 3 of the birth-death process N(t), we see that at time t + At, the system can be in 
state S, in three ways: 
1. By being in state S, at time t and no transition occurring in the time interval (t, t + At). This happens 
with probability (1 - a, At)(l - d, At) = 1 - (a, + d,) At [by neglecting the second-order effect

Let

Since pn is the steady-state probability that the system contains exactly n customers, using Eq. (9.14), 
the average number of customers in the M/M/1 queueing system is given by

we obtain 
9.5. 
Derive Eqs. (9.1 6) to (9.1 8). 
Since 1, = A, by Eqs. (9.2) and (9.15), we get

[CHAP. 9 
which is Eq. (9.1 6). Next, by definition, 
wq = w - w, 
where W, = 1/p, that is, the average service time. Thus, 
which is Eq. (9.1 7). Finally, by Eq. (9.31, 
which is Eq. (9.1 8). 
9.6. 
Let W, denote the amount of time an arbitrary customer spends in the M/M/1 queueing system. 
Find the distribution of W,. 
We have 
03 
P{ W, I a} = 
P( W, I a 1 n in the system when the customer arrives} 
n = 0 
x P{n in the system when the customer arrives} 
(9.44) 
where n is the number of customers in the system. Now consider the amount of time W, that this customer 
will spend in the system when there are already n customers when he or she arrives. When n = 0, then 
W, = W,,,,, that is, the service time. When n 2 1, there will be one customer in service and n - 1 customers 
waiting in line ahead of this customer's arrival. The customer in service might have been in service for some 
time, but because of the memoryless property of the exponential distribution of the service time, it follows 
that (see Prob. 2.57) the arriving customer would have to wait an exponential amount of time with param- 
eter p for this customer to complete service. In addition, the customer also would have to wait an exponen- 
tial amount of time for each of the other n - 1 customers in line. Thus, adding his or her own service time, 
the amount of time W, that the customer will spend in the system when there are already n customers when 
he or she arrives is the sum of n + 1 iid exponential r.v.'s with parameter p. Then by Prob. 4.33, we see that 
this r.v. is a gamma r.v. with parameters (n + 1, p). Thus, by Eq. (2.83), 
P{Wa 5 a I n in the system when customer arrives) = 
From Eq. (9.1 4), 
P{n in the system when customer arrives) = pn = 1 - - 
( XY 
Hence, by Eq. (9.44), 
Thus, by Eq. (2.79), W, is an exponential r-v. with parameter p - 1. Note that from Eq. (2.99), E(W,) = 
1/(p - A), which agrees with Eq. (9.16), since W = E( W,).

Customers arrive at a watch repair shop according to a Poisson process at a rate of one per 
every 10 minutes, and the service time is an exponential r.v. with mean 8 minutes. 
(a) Find the average number of customers L, the average time a customer spends in the shop 
W, and the average time a customer spends in waiting for service W,.

(b) Suppose that the arrival rate of the customers increases 10 percent. Find the corresponding 
changes in L, W, and W,. 
(a) The watch repair shop service can be modeled as an M/M/1 queueing system with 1 = &, p = 4. Thus, 
from Eqs. (9.1 5), (9.1 6), and (9.43), we have

It can be seen that an increase of 10 percent in the customer arrival rate doubles the average number 
of customers in the system. The average time a customer spends in queue is also doubled.

A drive-in banking service is modeled as an M/M/1 queueing system with customer arrival rate 
of 2 per minute. It is desired to have fewer than 5 customers line up 99 percent of the time. How

In order to have fewer than 5 customers line up 99 percent of the time, we require that this probability be 
less than 0.01. Thus, 
from which we obtain 
Thus, to meet the requirements, the average service rate must be at least 5.024 customers per minute.

People arrive at a telephone booth according to a Poisson process at an average rate of 12 per 
hour, and the average time for each call is an exponential r.v. with mean 2 minutes. 
(a) What is the probability that an arriving customer will find the telephone booth occupied? 
(b) It is the policy of the telephone company to install additional booths if customers wait an 
average of 3 or more minutes for the phone. Find the average arrival rate needed to justify a 
second booth. 
(a) The telephone service can be modeled as an M/M/1 queueing system with 1 = 4, p = 3, and p = 
1/p = 5. The probability that an arriving customer will find the telephone occupied is P(L > 0), where 
L is the average number of customers in the system. Thus, from Eq. (9.1 3),

From Eqs. (9.1 9) and (9.1 O), we have 
Let p = I/(sp). Then Eqs. (9.46) and (9.47) can be rewritten as

Using the summation formula 
we obtain Eq. (9.20); that is, 
provided p = A/(sp) < 1. 
9.11. Consider an M/M/s queueing system. Find the probability that an arriving customer is forced to 
join the queue. 
An arriving customer is forced to join the queue when all servers are busy-that

A corporate computing center has two computers of the same capacity. The jobs arriving at the 
center are of two types, internal jobs and external jobs. These jobs have Poisson arrival times

mean 3 minutes. 
(a) Find the average waiting time per job when one computer is used exclusively for internal 
jobs and the other for external jobs. 
(b) Find the average waiting time per job when two computers handle both types of jobs.

Find the percentage of the arriving aircraft that are diverted to the back concourse. 
If a holding area which can accommodate up to 8 aircraft is added to the main concourse,

The service system at the main concourse can be modeled as an M/M/s/s queueing system with s = 4,
