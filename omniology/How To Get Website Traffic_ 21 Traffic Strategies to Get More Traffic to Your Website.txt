3 Phases to Find Your Best Traffic Strategy
Before I go into the 21 different strategies to drive traffic to your website, I want to teach
you the 3 essential steps to get traffic online.

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Phase 1 – Test out different traffic strategies
In the first phase, you want to test out as many different type of traffic strategies.
You see, all kinds of traffic strategies work. However what works best for me may not
work best for you. That’s because we are all unique individuals. We all have our own
unique strengths.
That’s why some traffic strategies may work better for you than others.
For example if you enjoy speaking, then doing videos may come naturally for you.
If you enjoy writing, then blogging may be your best way to drive traffic.
If you don’t enjoy creating content, then doing solo ads may be the answer for you.
However you won’t know what works best for you until you test out different strategies in
the beginning.

Phase 2 – Find Out What Works
In the second phase, you want to find out which of the traffic strategies worked best for
you.
Which of the traffic strategies got you the best results?
Which of the traffic strategies are you comfortable doing?
Which of the traffic strategies do you enjoy doing?
One way to find out whether a traffic strategy works for you is not to ask your new
customers.
Ask your new customers where they found you.
Whatever is the most popular answer will be the traffic strategy that is giving you the
results!
I was spending tons of money on all kinds of traffic strategies and found out that majority
of my customers were finding me through YouTube.
That’s when it made sense that YouTube was the winning traffic strategy for me.

Phase 3 – Focus on Your Best Traffic Strategy
The third phase is to focus on the traffic strategy that is working the best for you. Ideally,
you want to focus on the traffic strategy that you are best at, you enjoy doing, and gets you
the best results.
The most important factor is to focus on what gets you the results because results is what
is going to continue your business for the long run.
From my experiences, the traffic strategy that gets me the best results is the traffic strategy
that I enjoy doing as well. That’s because the more you enjoy doing something, the more
you improve it and get thus naturally get better results from it.
As you focus on your best traffic strategy, you will start to slowly but surely get traffic that
builds a profitable business for you for the long run.
So make sure to follow these 3 phases to ultimately find out your best traffic strategy to
start, grow, and build your business to the next level.
Having said that, let’s introduce you to the 21 proven and tested traffic strategies to get
more website visitors that turn into sales online

Traffic Strategy #1 - Video Marketing
Video marketing is one of the most simple and effective ways for you to drive traffic to
your website.
www.ebook777.com
www.ebook777.com

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
YouTube
The most popular platform to use videos to get traffic to your website is YouTube!
Let me explain video marketing and YouTube in layman terms.
The whole point of doing YouTube videos is to get people from YouTube to watch your
video and then get them out of YouTube to go to your website (your newsletter or your
offer).
The reason why YouTube is powerful is because there are SO MANY people already
hanging out on YouTube!
In fact, did you know that YouTube is the #2 search engine in the world? That means after
Google, YouTube is the 2nd most frequent place people are searching for information!
Plus Google owns YouTube so whatever is popular on YouTube will tend to show up on
Google searches as well.
If you are want to get traffic that converts into followers and customers, then you must do
YouTube videos.
Simply create your own free YouTube channels and upload a bunch of videos related to
your business products and services.
There is no one way to use YouTube to market your business.
Some people like to put in a bunch of videos.
Some people like to put less videos.
Test out different ways and figure out what your natural style is.
Quick tip #1 – Always put your website link at the very top of the description.
Quick tip #2 – Make sure your website link starts with http:// because that will make the
website link a clickable link.

Dailymotion
You probably know YouTube is the biggest video marketing platform in the world. Well,
another very popular video marketing platform is dailymotion.
What I like about dailymotion is that they are not strict as YouTube. YouTube has been
known to easily take a channel down or flag a video down even though there was really no
reason. I’ve had instances where I had over 1000 videos in my YouTube channel and one
day it was taken down. All my videos were original and they took it down. It really was a
devastating loss.
That’s when I discovered dailymotion. I uploaded a bunch of videos on dailymotion and
much to my surprise, they keep your videos on their platform for a long time.
You hear the saying ‘don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Some people agree with that
saying. Some people don’t. I tend to agree with that saying. So whenever you do videos,
put most on YouTube since it’s the biggest video platform but don’t forget to also put your
videos on dailymotion as well because they will always be there for the long run.
Quick Action Step – Get your camera (from your phone), hit the record button, record
yourself talking about your business, and upload to YouTube. Stop worrying about how
you sound or how you look. Just do it. Get the ball rolling and go!

YouTube Hijack Method
This is one of my favorite ways to get traffic. Now, this is NOT easy and does not work all
the time but when it does work, it is AWESOME!
Getting traffic YouTube is awesome but then you have to create videos and most of the
times, you have to create a bunch of videos.
If you don’t feel like doing videos, then don’t fret because you still have an opportunity to
CRUSH IT with YouTube videos!
Here’s how. Basically, you search for viral videos that don’t have any website link in the
description. There are some people who create all these videos with MILLIONS of views
and then they don’t monetize it. That’s who you want to contact.
You want to message them directly through YouTube and offer them to pay a monthly fee
to put your website link at the top of their YouTube description link. That’s it!
I have done this before. The best case scenario was me sending this guy from India who
had uploaded a viral video with 50 million views (ended up over 100 million views later
on). I paid the guy $50 and then generated up to $1000 a month from that one single
video! That was just straight amazing.
Unfortunately, the guy’s video got taken down because it turns out he didn’t own the
copyright to the video. Regardless, it was amazing. I’ve done this at smaller scales with
other videos as well. This strategy works and it is powerful.
Quick Step – Go search for viral videos that don’t have a website link on the description.
Contact the YouTube channel owner and offer to pay them what you can afford to pay for
1 month of advertising. Contact at least 10 different people and 1 person will respond
back. Make a deal and start getting traffic!

Traffic Strategy #2 - Forum traffic
Many niches have forums where people can gather and talk about that niche topic.
Most forums allow you to create your own profile or about me page. They might also
allow you to have a signature link so that whenever you post, your signature link shows on
the bottom.
If the forum allows you to put your own website link, then that’s where you want to put
your profile link.
Forums are a great place to contribute by creating threads writing valuable tips related to
your niche. You can also reply too many threads and add your point of view. The more
people see you being active, the more they will see your signature link, click on it, and
then go visit your website.
In addition to that, many forums allow advertisers because that’s how they generate
income. So find a way to contact the forum admin and ask how you can advertise on their
forum. Be creative. Think outside the box. If you have an idea for putting your banner ad
on top of their forum, offer them a price and make a deal on what can bring you guys a
win/win situation.
Quick Action – Find a forum related to your niche that allows signature links under your
post. Start contributing on a regular basis and see more traffic come from the popular
forums related to your niche.

Traffic Strategy #3 - Solo Ads
Another common way to get traffic to your website is using a site called solo ads.
This is a simple straight forward way to get traffic to your website.
In short, you pay someone to send an email to their own list about your website. You pay
for the clicks. It’s very simple and straight forward and that’s why some people love just
focusing on solo ads because there is “less work” to doing this instead of creating content,
doing seo, and trying to get your content to show up on top of the search results.
One of the popular places to find solo ad vendors (especially for the internet marketing
niche) is safe-swaps.com. Basically, safe-swaps has a list of list owners. These people
have a list and if you pay them a certain amount of money, then they will send an email to
their list to guarantee you a certain amount of clicks.
Another way is to have your own list and find another person with a list similar to your list
size. You guys can both agree to send an email to your own list about each other’s offer.
That way both you and that person’s list will grow through a win/win situation.
Another popular website to find solo ad vendors is Warrior Forum Classified Ads. From
my experiences, Warrior Forum tends to have better quality solo ad vendors there
advertising. However, there are less to choose from.
Also, if you search on Facebook groups, there will be several different solo ad vendors as
well.
Quick Action – Go to www.safe-swaps.com, create an account, find the solo ad vendor
with good reviews, buy a solo ad, and start getting traffic!

Traffic Strategy #4 - Create Your Own Digital
Product with an Affiliate Program
Another powerful way to get tons of traffic is to create your own digital product and have
affiliates promote your product.
There are several benefits for creating your own digital product.
First, you can make money from your own digital product.
Second, you can have affiliates drive traffic to your website to make commissions
promoting your digital product.
Third, you gain much better credibility as an expert by being an owner of your own
product instead of just promoting other people’s products.
Now, it is a lot more difficult work to create your product because you have to create the
product, create the sales page, put the website together, and so forth. It’s you basically
creating your own system. However after you are done, you can have all these affiliates
(and sometimes super affiliates) drive traffic to your site.
If your site has a high converting sales page and makes money for those affiliates, then
they will keep promoting you over and over again because affiliates love to drive traffic to
offers that make them money.
And at the end of the day, you will get truckloads of traffic to your website by having
other people (affiliates) drive traffic to you.

Clickbank
One of the top places to create your own digital product with an affiliate program attached
to it is clickbank. Clickbank is one of the world’s biggest digital retail marketplaces in the
world.
It is a place for people to sell their own products. It’s also a place to find other people’s
products to sell as an affiliate.
Quick Action Step – This is not a quick action step because it does take a long time to set
up your product. But my advice is to outline your product, create your product, create your
site, and put it up on Clickbank.
www.ebook777.com
www.ebook777.com

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
JVZoo
Another great place to put your product is JVZoo. JVZoo is a lot like Clickbank except
you get paid directly to your PayPal account. In addition, there seems to be a lot less
refunds on PayPal because many serial refunders like to buy products on Clickbank and
immediately ask for a refund.
JVZoo has gotten very popular over the years especially for people in the internet
marketing niche.
One of the popular things about JVZoo is that sometimes you can get paid to your PayPal
account immediately after the sale instead of waiting 2 weeks after the sale like other
payment processors.
The concept of using JVZoo to get traffic is similar to Clickbank. Basically, you want to
create your own product and then put it up on the JVZoo marketplace. Launch your
product on JVZoo and other affiliates will promote your product for you. At the end, you
get a bunch of traffic from the affiliates and you and the affiliates both make money!

Traffic Strategy #5 - Facebook

Facebook Advertising
Another way to get traffic online is using Facebook.
In layman terms, you create your own ad. Basically an ad consists of a picture and some
text to it. That’s it. Then you select the type of people you want to view your ad. You can
target your demographics by selecting the age range, male or female, what they liked on
Facebook, and so forth.
The idea is to test different ads.
I’m not a big Facebook advertising person but from what I learned, you want to test
different images to see which ones get you the most clicks. Then, you want to test out your
text as well. You want to test out multiple variations of ads until you find the one that gets
you the most clicks and best conversions.
Quick Action Step – Create your own first Facebook ad campaign. Then, put a daily
budget on what you afford to spend. Then, just do it. Test the waters and start to get traffic
to your offer.

Facebook Messaging
Another less technical way to drive traffic to your website is using Facebook to message
people, develop a relationship, and then sell them some offer you have.
I know this sounds a little more hands on but I have seen others use this method to
generate a lot of sales online.
Yes, this can seem annoying to you as the person being sold. However, I know this works
because I have seen many top direct marketers use this to get sales online.
This is a form of “attraction marketing”. However how it works best is that you use
Facebook to posts all kinds of things that attract people to you. So that means, you
wouldn’t necessarily post hype type of messages on your Facebook wall.
Instead, you would put things like lifestyle pictures or even income screenshots (once in a
while) to attract the type of person who wants to join your business. Then, when they are
attracted to you enough, they will message you on Facebook first. From there, you start
chatting them up, finding out what they want, and presenting your opportunity as the
solution to their problem, and then they join from you.
Quick Step – Post unique and positive posts on your Facebook wall so that it attracts the
right people to message you. Once people contact you, do a quick chat to get them signed
up in your business.

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Traffic Strategy #6 - Instagram
I have seen people use Instagram to get almost all their traffic to their websites and get
customers online.
Instagram is the social media platform that is getting bigger for the younger generation.
Unlike Facebook, Instagram is all about posting your pictures.
The key is to post pictures and quick videos on a consistent basis. Make sure to put your
website link in your profile so that people can visit your website when they check out your
main profile.
Quick Step – Create your Instagram account, post up pictures and videos, then have a link
to your website in your Instagram profile.

www.ebook777.com

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Traffic Strategy #7 - Popular Blogs
Another way to drive traffic to your website is to advertise on popular blogs related to
your niche.
For example, let’s say your niche is the “internet marketing” niche. Then just go to
Google, type “internet marketing blog”. Then all the popular blogs related to your niche
will come up. Go check out those blogs. Then scroll down to the bottom of the blog and
you will usually find links related to advertising opportunities.
From there, you can purchase advertising and piggyback off the traffic that these popular
blogs are already getting!
I would recommend to negotiate your advertising with the blog owners because blog
owners like you and me. They are regular people. They are willing to negotiate for a lower
price for you if you just ask. They are looking for advertisers just like you so be willing to
ask for a lower price. Just by asking, you can get a lower price.
Quick Step – Go search on Google for blogs related to your niche. Then contact at least 10
blogs that show up. Make sure to negotiate the price. I recommend to test out for a month
and see if it is profitable for you or not. If it is profitable, continue advertising. If it’s not,
move onto another traffic source.

Traffic Strategy #8 - Retargeting
This site does retargeting. Basically, retargeting is making your website visitor see another
ad of yours whenever they visit a popular website.
It’s kind of you like stalking your website visitor wherever they go although I don’t like to
use that term.
Let me explain it in a simple way. Sitescout is a site where they give you a code. You
insert that code in your website. Then whenever someone visits your website, that code
will get triggered so whenever that visitor goes to a popular website (that is advertising on
sitescout), your website visitor will see your banner ad featured on there.
First, retargeting is powerful because your website visitor will continuously be reminded
to go check out your offer.
Second, they will also be impressed at how you are advertising on the big sites. I had one
of my customers contact me and go crazy on how I was advertising on some big sports site
because of retargeting. It was hilarious!
Third, if you know how to do it right, the cost per click can be a lot cheaper than regular
places to advertise.
Quick Action – Go set up an account at www.sitescout.com, put up your first campaign,
and start to drive retargeting traffic to your website.

Traffic Strategy #9 - Kindle Ebooks
This is one of my favorite ways to drive traffic.
A lot of my themes of my internet marketing traffic strategy is to piggyback off of big
websites that already have a lot of people there.
Let me give you an analogy. Let’s say you invented the greatest product in the world. You
go to a mom and pop store in the middle of a small town in Kansas with a very small
population. You ask the store owner to sell your product. The mom and pop store owner
say he will sell it. You wait a day and no sales. You wait a week and still no sales. You
wait a month and still no sales.
However let’s flip it around. Let’s say you give that same product to the owner of a huge
mall in the busy city of New York. What’s going to happen? Your product will sell! That’s
because you are going to the place where the people are already going.
That’s the SAME concept of selling your eBook on Kindle which is owned by Amazon.
So if you are willing to put in the work or money, then I recommend you to create your
own eBook and put it up on Kindle.
It can be one book. It can be 10 books. It can be 100 books. It can be 1000 books.
The more books you have, the more exposure you get.
Not only is Kindle is a great place to get traffic but you can also get PAID for your books
on autopilot as well.
Plus, you instantly become an author which instantly elevates your authority and
positioning as an expert in your field.
I wrote a book called “How To Write a How To Book in 24 Hours” to help anybody write
their book on Amazon quickly regardless of their writing level or not. Go check it out on
Amazon because it’s a quick read and most importantly, it works!
Quick Action – Write your quick step-by-step how to book related to your niche, go to
kdp.amazon.com, publish your book on Amazon, start making that Amazon money, and
start getting that traffic!

Traffic Strategy #10 - Article Marketing
Another popular way to drive traffic is to do articles that are uploaded on popular article
websites. One of the most popular article websites is ezinearticles.com. Basically, you just
create an article, and put a website link at the bottom of the page to get traffic to your
website.
I’ve done hundreds of articles in my beginning internet marketing career.
The general rule is to write about a 500 word ‘how to’ article. At the end of the article, you
are allowed to put your website link to get that traffic to your website.
Quick Tip – Do not submit the same article to other article directories because from my
experiences, it is best to submit unique articles to each directory. If you submit the same
article to multiple directories, then it will be considered “duplicate content” and the search
engines won’t show the articles in the search results.
Quick Action – Go to www.ezinearticles.com, publish your first article, and link it back to
your website to get that article marketing traffic!

Traffic Strategy #11 - Podcast
This is another popular platform to start building up a strong and loyal following. It’s kind
of like you creating your own radio show except that it can all be done with a laptop and
internet connection.
You just create an iTunes account, upload your podcast, and then just be sure to do it on a
consistent basis. I think the general rule of thumb is to do at least 1 podcast a week. You
can teach topics related to your niche OR you can interview someone related to a niche
every week.
Then in your podcast, you can advertise your offer or your newsletter so a big portion of
the podcast listeners will check out your website.
Quick Action – Go to https://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/specs.html to learn about the
details to create your own podcast. Then, upload your podcast and do it on a regular basis
to start getting traffic online.

Traffic Strategy #12 - Traffic Brokers
Traffic brokers are another way to get traffic to your website.
If you don’t want to do the typical “work” to get traffic, you can just go to a “traffic
broker” and buy traffic from them.
Traffic brokers are people who have connections to several different traffic vendors. They
will usually sort through them and find the ones that get the best results and sell you the
traffic vendor’s traffic to you. Essentially, the traffic broker is the middleman between you
and the traffic vendor.
Sure, you can go straight to the traffic vendor but usually it’s very difficult to know who is
a good vendor or not. That’s why traffic brokers (the good ones) are good because they
will only sell you traffic that they have tested to see if the traffic is good quality traffic that
converts or not.
Quick Action – Google search for different traffic brokers in your niche. Test out buying
traffic from several different sources. Find out which gets you the best results and then
focus on the traffic brokers that got you the best results.

Traffic Strategy #13 - Craigslist
Craigslist is another very popular website to get traffic from especially for the opportunity
market.
You can create a job post in a specific city.
As I’m typing this, it costs around $40 to put up a job post. Yes, it costs money but you
can put up a job post and then have a bunch of people looking for a job visit your website
link from your job post.
Don’t mention MLM or network marketing because craigslist doesn’t like that necessarily.
Just mention it’s a work from home or online jobs opportunity.
Quick Action – Create a quick job post on craigslist in a bigger city. Then, put your
website link so you can get traffic from the online classified ad.

Traffic Strategy #14 - Pay Per View
I’m not a big pay per view advertiser but I have known people who have used this to
generate a fulltime income online.
The concept is simple. Basically when someone searches for something, there will be a
pop up that pops up (for some users who agreed to use some software on their browser).
Then the pop up will be your ad.
One thing I know is that many people bid for keywords and that is very expensive to do
and not specific enough.
So the better strategy is to bid for the webpage links (URLs) that show up when you are
searching for specific keywords in your niche.
Many people bid for keywords but from my research, it’s better to target specific website
page links that show up whenever people are searching for terms you are looking to show
up on
The two most popular pay per view networks are LeadImpact.com and TrafficVance.com.
LeadImpact accepts anyone but I believe TrafficVance requires you to get someone’s
referral.
Quick Action – Create a free LeadImpact.com account and start driving traffic.

Traffic Strategy #15 - Meetup
Another different way to get traffic to your website is to create your own meetup.com
club.
Meetup.com is a website where you create a small “meet up” where people with similar
hobbies will meet up and talk about whatever they are into.
It can be about internet marketing.
It can be about real estate.
It can be about sports.
Whatever hobby or passion or industry you are into, I am pretty sure there is some kind of
meetup out there for it.
I know a very well-known real estate broker who created his own meetup club. Basically,
he would do weekly teachings through his “free” meetups. Out of the people who learn
from his free meetup trainings, a portion would buy houses from him. In fact, I actually
bought a house from him and found him through his meetup trainings!
So meetups are a powerful way to get customers and website traffic.
If you don’t want to create your own meetup, you can go to other meetups and volunteer
to speak. I actually did this too. One of the internet marketing meetups was looking for
speakers and I volunteered. I spoke once and I remember several people from the meetups
ended up buying my products and offers I promoted later on.

Traffic Strategy #16 - Joint Venture
Joint venturing is basically you scratching someone’s back and the other person scratching
your back.
Basically, you would send an email promoting someone else’s product. Then, the other
product owner would send an email to their list promoting your product.
At the end of the day, you both leverage off each other and get more traffic from each
other.
The best way to joint venture is to do it 3 different ways.
One, email broadcast to your list about each other’s offer.
Second, insert your email in your autoresponder sequence. Also have your joint venture
partner insert the email (where they promote you) in their email autoresponder sequence.
That way, the joint venture traffic works for the long run. It is no longer a onetime thing
but you guys both promote each other through automated emails in the future in your
newsletter as well!
Third, I recommend to put each other’s product link as a recommended product or offer in
each other’s “thank you” page or a members only page so that who buy from you can also
see your joint venture’s website link and vice versa.
Quick Action – Find a joint venture partner who has a great product/service that can
complement you and you can work with for the long run. Contact that person to talk about
the three ways to join venture and implement those quickly to have a win/win partnership
for more traffic and sales for the long run.

Traffic Strategy #17 - Pay Per Click
One of the great things about pay per click marketing is that you don’t have to worry
about creating content.
In traffic generation, there are two different ways to drive traffic. One is to buy traffic. The
other is to create consistent content and through creating consistent content, you will
develop a loyal list of followers.
Creating content can be “slow” for some people so that’s why buying traffic makes more
sense because it is faster.
One very popular form of advertising by paying for traffic is pay per click advertising.
Pay per click is basically you paying per click for your ad.
When you are doing your pay per click campaigns, make sure you are targeted.
Make sure you are targeted in your message. Make sure the landing page they visitors go
to are congruent to the messaging in your ad. You want to be congruent from start to finish
in order to have the highest conversions as possible in your advertising efforts.
In addition, you want to create variations in your advertising so you can split test which ad
gets you the best results. Split testing is testing out two different ads and seeing which one
gets you better results. Whichever gets you better results, you keep and you get rid of the
ad that doesn’t get you better results. You want to keep split testing over and over again to
get better results in the long run.
There are several different pay per click platforms to drive traffic to your website.

Google AdWords
Google Adwords is the most popular pay per click platform to advertise. AdWords has
gotten some slack from some internet marketers because they have been known to take
down certain accounts down if they promoted certain niches like internet marketing and
some other niches out there.

YouTube PPC
YouTube PPC is a fairly new pay per click platform. Again, Google owns YouTube but the
big difference is that YouTube PPC seems to be more lenient in terms of what you can
advertise on their platform. Plus, the conversions seem very high for this platform because
the ads are videos. Videos have a very high conversion rate compared to a typical ad so
using YouTube ppc may give you better ROI for you.

Bing
Another PPC platform outside of Google is Bing. Bing is very similar to Google
AdWords. The good news is that they are not as strict as Google in terms of what you can
or cannot promote. A lot of people in the internet marketing niche (the niche I promoted)
have used this very successfully to get a lot of traffic online.

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Facebook
Facebook is another platform to advertise. This is a very popular place to advertise
because Facebook is the 2nd most visited website in the world. It is also the website that
people hang out longer than any other website because it’s a social network website.
Facebook has been a very popular place for business owners to advertise because it has
very detailed ways to target your advertising. You can advertise to people who like
specific type of pages. You can target by age range. You can target by what language they
speak.
Quick Action – Choose one pay per click platform, set up your pay per click campaign.
Make sure to create variations so you can split test and see which ad gives you the best
clicks and conversions.

Traffic Strategy #18 - Email Marketing
Another very popular way to drive traffic to your website is to use your own email list.
The FASTEST way to drive traffic to your website is to email your list.
If you don’t have an email list, then I recommend you to build your own email list using
an autoresponder. The email autoresponder I use and recommend is
www.bjmin101.com/autoresponder.
Internet marketing can be broken down to building your list and emailing your list.
Many people want to just look outside their email list to look for traffic.
However, the traffic can literally be in front of your own face if you email you list.
So make it a regular habit to schedule broadcast emails to your list at least once a week.
I have heard marketers say that once they started emailing their list once a day, they
started making more money than emailing once a week.
Regardless of the number of times you email your list, make sure to email your list on a
consistent basis.
This is how you drive INSTANT traffic to whatever offer you want to promote in your
business.
Here’s a last reminder about email marketing. Make sure to mix up your emails.
Some days, you can email tips related to your offer.
Some days, you can email a link to your offer.
If you just pitch in your emails, then no one will want to open your emails over time.
So make sure to MIX IT UP by sending quality content AND pitching your offers at times
as well.
Doing both will give you the best results over time.
Quick Action – Set up a broadcast email to email an offer that you want to promote to
your list.

Traffic Strategy #19 - Blogging
Another popular way to drive traffic to your website is to blog!
This is for content creators.
A blog is a great way for you if you enjoy writing or you constantly have new ideas that
come into your head.
Blogging is a great way to express your ideas and thoughts in your own blog.
Nowadays, it’s pretty easy to set up a blog.
Most website hosting companies provide a free way to create a blog on your website if
you host with them.
The recommended blogging platform I recommend is WordPress.
If you go to your website cpanel, there should be an option to install a WordPress blog on
your site. In my hosting cpanel, it’s under the “Quick Install” category. It may be different
for you so contact your website host to find out how to install WordPress blog on your
website and you should be able to set up your blog quickly.
There are some keys to using a blog effectively.
First, you have to create great content.
Second, you have to do SEO (search engine optimization) so that your blog post shows on
top of the search results for the term you want to rank for.
You need to both good content and SEO so that people will see your content and continue
to see the content for the long run.
SEO is a topic in itself but generally speaking, the more quality links you get from quality
sites pointing to your blog post, the higher your blog post will rank. Nowadays, SEO is
moving towards how much engagement your blog post gets. The more comments your
blog post gets and the more times your blog is shared on social media sites, the more your
blog post will rank on the top of the search results.
Another form of blogging is guest blogging. You can go to a very popular blog in your
niche and offer a very high quality and unique blog post to them. In exchange, you can get
a link back to your own website. This way, you are piggybacking off of someone else’s
already big blog site and getting traffic from it. The key is to create a really good quality
blog post that they blog owner will love.
Quick Action – Install a WordPress blog on your site and start blogging consistently,
encourage your readers to share, and comment on your blog to increase the engagement of
the post for the long run.

Traffic Strategy #20 - eBay
You can create a quick information product like an eBook and offer it for an affordable
price on eBay.
eBay used to allow instant eBook delivery but they stopped doing that a while ago.
So a lot of the information marketers stopped promoting their information products on
eBay.
Still, you can still use eBay to promote your own information product (such as an eBook)
and deliver to them via email.
Yes, it’s manual but don’t forget that eBay is still one of the top searched sites in the
world.
Plus, you can make some income selling your eBay offer.
What I recommend is to create a landing page that leads to your information product.
So whenever someone buys your eBook, then you just send them that link via eBay
message. Then they’ll be able to opt in to your list and get instant access to your product.
You build your BUYERS list and they get the product instantly. After they opt in to your
list, you can sell them more offers through automated emails in the backend.
Quick Action – Create a quick eBay auction ad for a fixed price for your information
product. Just put it out there for 7 days and start to build your buyer’s list.

Traffic Strategy #21 - Press Releases
Another way to drive traffic to your website is to create a press release for your business.
I’ve done a press release and have gotten contacted by a fairly big newspaper in the Los
Angeles County! I got a phone call and I asked them how they found me. They said they
found me through a press release I did on the internet!
I ended up getting my face on the front page of a newspaper thanks to a simple little press
release!
Even though your press release may not get the attention of a newspaper, you still can get
traffic just from writing the press release. That’s because a lot of the press release sites are
high authority websites. So whatever you write in their website tends to rank well in the
search engines.
Make sure to put the keyword you want to rank for in the beginning of the press release
title. In addition, do SEO backlinks (links pointing to your press release site) for the
keyword you want to rank for.
If you do this right, then your press release will rank on the first page of the search engines
to give you consistent and quality traffic online!
Quick Action – Go to a press release site. Write and submit a press release for your
website.

Conclusion
Congratulations on finishing my book “How to Get Website Traffic”.
Now you have been introduced to 21 of my favorite strategies to drive traffic to your
website.
Here’s my last piece of advice.
Test out different traffic strategies in the beginning.
Then, find out which of the traffic strategies gets you the best results.
Whatever that traffic strategies gets the best results, FOCUS on that ONE traffic strategy
for the LONG RUN.
I know I introduced you to several different traffic strategies. That is step number one.
However from my own real life experiences and also seeing other very successful
marketers, the BEST way is to FOCUS on that ONE traffic strategy that gets you the
BEST results over time.
I’m sure you’ve heard of the 80/20 principle where 80% of your results come from 20% of
your focus.
So find out that one traffic strategy that best resonates with your natural strengths, you
enjoy doing, and gets you the best results.
What’s ironic is that what works best for me may not work best for you.
I enjoy doing videos to drive traffic to my offers and websites. I also enjoy doing Kindle
eBooks.
Some people can’t stand creating content so they prefer to focus on the paid traffic
strategies.
Some people can’t stand either of them and would rather create a product and have
affiliate drive traffic to them.
No one way is right. You just have to find your own way in regards to traffic.
So figure out what traffic strategy that best resonates with you and then go ALL OUT on
it!
Another quick thing I was to remind you is that the first time you try out a traffic strategy
won’t work all the time. That doesn’t mean to give up. That doesn’t mean the traffic
strategy doesn’t work. You have to keep on keeping on until you MASTER that one traffic
strategy in the long run.
Again, thank you for reading my book all the way.
Most importantly, always keep taking that action because action is the key to success in
anything you do.
