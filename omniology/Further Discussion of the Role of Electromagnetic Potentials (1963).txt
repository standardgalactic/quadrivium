In this paper,
we present a further
discussion
of the role of electromagnetic
potentials
in the quantum
theory,
aimed at clarifying
some of the points
made in earlier papers,
and indicating
some extensions
of
these earlier ideas. In addition,
we go into the problem
of subsidiary
conditions
and questions
concerning
the full observability
of the potentials.
In the course of our discussion,
we answer certain recent objections
of Belinfante
and De Witt.
expressed
iri terms of the potentials,
one obtains both a
complete
set of local commuting
"observables"
gad a
set of purely local equations
of motion. It was certainly
not our intention,
of course, to insist that a correct
theory must be local in this sense. Indeed, we explicitly
pointed
out that physics is currently
in a state of Aux,
such that there are even good reasons to suppose that
this requirement
of locality must
somehow
eventually
either be changed or given up altogether.
However,
we
did
wish
to stress that
this principle
of localisability
(which may be called "physical-geometrical"
) is,iIfact,
now playing
an important
part in helping to define the
mathematical
form of current theories
We a.lso wished to
point out that there did not exist, to our knowledge,
a
correspondingly
clear and
natural
way of expressing
this
principle
of localizability
in terms
of the
field
strengths
alone, without
the use of potentials. It was in
this sense that we meant to state that the potentials
are
playing
an "essential" part in giving a mathematical
expression
to certain
physically
(and, of course,
geo-
metrically)
significant
features
of current
quantum
electrodynamical
theories.
Now, De Witt
and Belinfante'
objected to the con-
tent
of the
above
statements,
and
supported
their
objections by producing, at least in a formal sense, some
examples of explicit theories based only on a local set of
gauge-invariant
"field observables, " not requiring
the
introduction
of the potentials.
Thus, De Witt began by
starting
with the usual
theory,
and making
a certain
nonlocal
gauge transformation,
f'=e'8$, where S is an
integral of the field observables
over a certain somewhat
arbitrarily
chosen path. In terms
of f', he then
ob-
tained a set of field equations,
very similar to the usual
ones, except that
where
the vector potential
usually
enters, there now appears a nonlocal integral

OME time ago, a number
of papers' ' were pub-
lished,
bringing
out the fact that electromagnetic
potentials
have a new kind of significance
in quantum
theory, which does not appear in classical physics. Since
then, a brief paper was published
by De Witt,
in which
he criticized one of the points that we had made, viz. ,
that the potentials
play an essential part in expressing
the fact that the electron-electromagnetic
interaction
is
a local one (i.e., that the interaction
is nonzero
only at
the points where there are charges). In an accompanying
paper'
we answered
these criticisms.
Since then,
how-
ever, a paper by Belinfante'
has appeared,
in which he
objects to certain points raised in our answer to De Witt.
After
carefully
considering
Belinfante s criticisms,
and reconsidering
De Witt's note, it has become clear to
us that a systematic
restatement
of our position on this
problem
is now desirable,
because what
we wished
to
say has apparently
not been su%ciently
clearly under-
stood. In addition,
our ideas on this subject have mean-
while been developing
in several directions,
and we feel
that an indication
of the general line of these develop-
ments
will also help to clarify
some of the problems
involved.
In this
article,
we shall,
therefore,
try to
present such a restatement
of our general position along
with a discussion
of some further
developments
in our
ideas concerning
the role of electromagnetic
potentials
in quantum
theory. In the course of the paper, we shall
answer Belinfante's objections, and we shall also supple-
ment our earlier reply to De Witt's note.

Belinfante,
however,
regarded
the integration
over
an arbitrary
path
as unsatisfactory,
and instead
sug-
gested
another
gauge
transformation,
leading
to a
similar
theory,
in which
the usual vector potential
is
replaced by
(2)
Here the integration
is carried out over a certain three-
dimensional
space-like
hypersurface
in
the
four-
dimensional
space-time
continuum.
The advantage
of
this transformation
is that no arbitrary
path
of inte-
gration
needs to be chosen. Rather,
the three-dimen-
sional
space-like
hypersurface
can be taken
to cor-
respond
to the coordinate
frame of some observer.
Of
course,
this
means
that
the theory
is not manifestly
covariant,
though
(as we shall
go into later) it may
perhaps
still be covariant
in its over-all content.
Both De Witt and Belinfante
then suggest that one
can start with the field operators, F„„(s"),as a basic set
of "observables, "assuming
the usual "local" commuta-
tion relations,
between
field quantities.
LThat is, field
quantities
at diferent
places and at the same time all
commute. $ These will guarantee
the localize, bitity of the
F„,(s") "observables. " On the basis of this result,
they
argue that one has obtained
a suitable
formulation
of
quantum
electrodynamics,
embodying
the feature
of
localizability
without
using
the
potentials.
As both
De Witt and Belinfante
recognize,
however,
the field
equations
now involve the rioetocat operators,
A„,'(x ) or
A„"(x ), as given in Eqs. (1) and (2).
In our answer to De Witt, we pointed
out that the
transformations
described above, are, in fact, obscuring
the problem
of what is meant by localizability.
For to
express this property
naturally
and in a clear fashion
one requires
not only local basic operators,
but
also
local "interactions, "not involving
nonlocal functions
of
the basic operators
such as those given in (1) and (2).
In this way
one obtains
a clear and natural
mathe-
matical
expression
for the common
"intuitive"
notion
that
the world
can be analyzed
into "local" entities
(i.e., the fields and
charges)
interacting
by a sort of
"contact" (which notion is, in fact, implicit
in modern
field theories) .
Of course, one might
argue that perhaps
the above-
described "intuitive" notion of localizability
is no longer
adequate,
and that it may be desirable
now to change
this concept,
in such a way that it will refer only to
local
field
operators,
without
committing
ourselves
necessarily
to local field equations
as well. But (as we
also noted in our answer to De Witt) there are serious,
as yet unsolved,
problems
in trying to do this, because,
in genera/,
purely
local commutation
relations
are not
compatible
with
nonlocal
field
equations.
(In other
words, the propagation
of initially "local" commutation
relations
by nonlocal
equations
of motion
would
gener-
ally lead to the development
of nonlocal features in the
commutation
relations
in
question. ) Therefore,
the
apparently
"nonlocal" electrodynamical
6eld equations
given
by De Witt
and
Belinfante,
are known
to be
capable
of expression
without
self-contradiction,
only
when they are derivable
by some transformation
from a
local set of equations
that involve the potentials. It is
thus
seen
that
the peculiar
and
restricted
types
of
forms,
(1) or (2), in which
the field quantities
must
enter the equations
of motion,
are in some rather
ob-
scure and indirect way implying
the property
of locali-
zability. On the other hand, this property
is clearly and
directly
exhibited,
when
one does not
eliminate
the
potentials.
The problem
of the form of the equations
is,
therefore, not merely a question of convenience
or taste,
at least if one wants not only to calculate
some result,
but also to see clearly what are the usually
Nnasserted
physical-geometrical
assumptions
that
go into deter-
mining
the mathematical
form of the theory.
To bring out this point more sharply,
we can refer to
an analogous
problem
in which
physical
motions
are
linearly
superposable
(e.g., a harmonic
oscillator). By
the substitution,
u= v', we could obtain a formally
non-
linear equation, but at the expense of making the mean-
ing of the property
of linear superposition
rather
diffi-
cult to see. (If it turned out that the nonlinear
equations
were suspected
on reasonable
grounds
to be generally
self-contradictory,
unless
reducible
to linear
ones by
some substitution,
the
a,nalogy
would be even better. )
The physical
principle
of linear
superposability
of
motions thus helps to determine
the (linear) mathemati
cat form of the equations
of motion and dictates for this
purpose
the
choice
of
v as a "natural"
dependent
variable.
In a similar
way,
the
physical-geometrical
principle
of localizability
helps to determine
the (locali-
zable)
mathematical
form
of
the
electrodynamical
equations
and dictates for this purpose the potentials
as
a "natural"
electrodynamical
set of variables
(leading
to local "observables"
oed local equations
of motion).
In a further
paragraph
added in the proofs, De Witt
objected in yet another way to the conclusion described
above,
saying
that the mathematical
form of current
quantum-electrodynamical
theories
is "determined
by
experiment"
(stating further on that the same is true of
Maxwell's
equations).
We
were,
in fact,
somewhat
surprised
to encounter
such an objection. For it seemed
as if De Witt
felt that
theoretical
physicists
simply
considered
the results
of experiments,
and then wrote
down
essentially
uniquely
determined
mathematical
equations
(except perhaps
for various
possible
trans-
formations
leaving
their
physical
implications
un-
changed),
and that this was all done without
the need
for introducing
any principles,
ideas, or assumptions,
going at all beyond
what
can be seen directly
in the
experimental
results themselves. If this is what De Witt
intended
to say, then it is evidently
false.
Thus, even Newton,
who at one point claimed not to
make hypotheses,
actually brought
in by implications
a
great many
assumptions
about space, time, causality,
the inertial
frame,
the existence
of forces acting at a

distance, etc., which did, in fact, play a crucial part in
determining
the mathematical
form of his equations
of
motion,
and which
were
men|,r "determined
by experi-
ment. " When
some of these
assumptions
were
later
questioned,
(e.g., in the theory
of relativity
and the
quantum
theory), room was made for very fundamental
changes in the mathematical
forms of physical theories.
In a similar way, neither Maxwell's
equations
nor those
of quantum
electrodynamics
are
determined
simply
from experiment
aloee
Th.us, when
Maxwell
originally
proposed
his equations,
he introduced
the "displace-
ment
current"
as a hypothesis,
which
(among
other
things)
led to a simple and coherent
mathematical
form
for his theory. Later, this hypothesis
was con6rmed
by
experiment,
but even now, the assumption,
for example,
of linearity
is far from verified in full detail by experi-
ment. As for quantum
electrodynamics,
its mathemati-
cal form was originally
suggested
largely
as a natural
application
of quantum
theory
to 6eld theory.
Since
then, it has received a few experimental
confirmations
(e.g., the Lamb shift), but these can hardly
be said to
determine
uniquely
the mathematical
form of the cur-
rently accepted theories. Among the principles
that are
helping to effect such a determination
one is, as we have
pointed
out,
the
localizability
of
electromagnetic
interactions.
3. ON THE PROBLEM OF A COMPLETE COMMUTING
SET OF LOCAL OPERATORS
The problem of localizability
was the main point that
we wished to discuss in our earlier articles on the poten-
tials. However,
we also went
into the question
of a
complete
set
of
commuting
"observables"
in
6eld
theory, and into that of whether
theories involving
field
quantities
alone could solve the problem
of obtaining
such a set in a satisfactory
way. Here, we unfortunately
made use of some common
but loosely applied
terms,
which may perhaps
have led Belinfante
to attribute
to
us intentions
that we did not have. The first of these
loose
terms
arose
in our reference
to an acceptable
"covariant"
form
of
quantum
electrodynamics.
By
implication,
we
took
this
to mean
"manifestly
co-
variant. "In doing this, we, of course, never intended to
suggest
that
current
manifestly
covariant
treatments
are free of objections, doubtful
assumptions,
and possi-
ble sources of self-contradiction.
Rather,
all that
was
meant
was that, as yet, no other treatments
had been
shown to achieve even the limited
degree of coherence
in the manner
of leaving
out infinities
that has been
obtained
in manifestly
covariant
theories.
Belinfante,
however,
has argued
that in an earlier
article~ he did
actually
prove
the
relativistic
invariance
of a non-
manifestly-covariant
theory,
essentially
equivalent
to
that
resulting
from the formulation
described
in con-
nection with Eq. (2), of the present paper. Nevertheless,
in a somewhat
later paper,
he recognizes that the prob-

F.J. Belinfante, Phys. Rev. 91, 1285 (1953).
lem of getting rid of the infinities
in a covariant
way is
yet to be dealt with. In his recent paper, ' Belinfante
suggests that this is due only to the tediousness
of the
requisite
calculations,
and to the fact that no one has
cared to work out consequently
what would happen
if
the calculations
were actually done. This is, however, a
matter of opinion. When we wrote our paper, ' it seemed
to us that there were serious difficulties
in the way of
such a program,
and as yet, these difhculties
do not seem
to have been resolved. Therefore,
our implicit
assump-
tion that
all satisfactory
covariant
theories
are also
manifestly
covariant
was not basically wrong; although,
admittedly,
it would
have been clearer if we had ex-
plicitly stated that
we meant
"manifestly
covariant. "
At this point, it will perhaps
be well to make it clear
that we did not (and do not) regard theories
involving
field quantities
alone as of no potential interest or value.
First of all, of course, it is necessary to see whether
such
theories can really deal with infinities
in a satisfactory
covariant
way. But even if it should turn out that they
can, it still seems to us that they must
also face the
problem, described earlier, of expressing
the principle of
localizability
in a clear and natural
way. Until they do
this, it seems to us that they are obscuring an important
physical-geometrical
question
without
giving
any cor-
responding
gains to compensate
for this loss. Naturally,
it is quite possible that further
research
on these lines
will resolve
such problems,
and lead to new results
of
interest. But for the present, it seems that potentials
are
still needed
to play the "essential" part to which
we
have been referring.
4. ON THE PROBLEM OF SUBSIDIARY CONDITIONS
IN ELECTRODYNAMICS
Now De Witt and Belinfante do suggest that there is
some advantage
to be gained by starting
with the 6eld
operators,
rather
than
with
potentials,
i.e., one can
eliminate
the subsidiary
conditions
(such as BA„/ctxl'= 0
in the Lorentz gauge). They seem to feel that the sub-
sidiary
conditions
are creating
serious
and basic diK-
culties
in quantum
electrodynamics,
so that it is an
important
advantage
to be able to eliminate
them.
However, for reasons that we shall give, we do not think
that the subsidiary
conditions
are really creating such
serious
problems,
so that
we do not regard
the mere
elimination
of these potentials
as a very signi6cant gain.
On the contrary, it seems to us that, as we shall try to
show, the potentials
may be furnishing
important
clues
as to further
developments
in physics,
so that
their
elimination
may lead to obscure these clues (whatever
may
be the,
as yet, unclear
advantages,
which
this
elimination
might later be shown to have).
The main current
objection to the use of subsidiary
conditions
is probably
that
one begins
with a set of
operators
whose eigenfunctions
include what are called
"nonphysical"
states, that do not satisfy the subsidiary
condition. If it were not for the divergences
and gener-
ally
infinite
results
implicit
in current
theories,
this

would, of course, cause no difficulty
of a purely mathe-
matical nature. For one could simply consider the total
set of solutions for the electrodynamical
system
(phys-
ical and nonphysical)
and then choose those satisfying
the subsidiary
condition. But because current
theories
are divergent,
special care is needed to avoid the inclu-
sion of transitions
to the "nonphysical"
states in the
computation
of quantities,
such as the Lamb shift. Such
precautions
require the addition
of further
injunctions,
beyond
what
follows
necessarily
from
the
original
theory.
Belinfante'
regards
such devices as a kind of
"trick," or "artifice, " which "smuggles"
in extraneous
factors. Of course, Belinfante is quite correct in this. But
then, is not the whole renormalization
technique
like-
wise just such an "artifice, " which
is being used as a
kind of very useful and necessary
but
(we hope) tem-
porary "stop-gap, "until a new nondivergent
theory can
be developed?
Indeed,
there
is good
reason
to suppose
that
the
current "stop-gap" theory is not even logically coherent,
in the sense that
when
carried beyond
a certain very
limited range of operations
and calculations,
it may lead
to self-contradictory
results. ' And if a theory
is self-
contradictory,
then from problems
that arise in dealing
with any of its parts (such as the subsidiary
conditions)
we cannot
draw any secure conclusions
as to the real
origin of the difficulties.
(For example,
by introducing
the self-contradictory
statement,
2= 1, somewhere
in
the theory,
we might
obtain
absurd
results
in certain
places, while in other places this contradiction
would not
a8ect the results.
But none
of the discussion
would
throw any reliable light on the validity of any particular
part of the theory). Indeed, all that can be said thus far
is that the problem
of the subsidiary
condition
is not
known as yet to introduce
any mathematical
difficulties
beyond
those that
may
be removed
in some
future
theory
that
avoids
the admittedly
self-contradictory
infinities
of current
theories.
(In the
Appendix,
we
suggest some more definite reasons why the elimination
of these infinities
may help us to avoid problems
con-
nected with subsidiary
conditions. )
5. ON THE "OBSERVABILITY" OF THE POTENTIALS
Now, in the papers of De Witt and Belinfante,
there
seems to be still a further
kind of objection to poten-
tials, viz. , that they are not "observable. " And here,
there is a type of confusion of terminology,
which has in
effect been built into the quantum
theory itself. For the
phrase "Hermitian
operator
whose eigenfunctions
form
a complete
basis
for the
wave
function"
has
been
identified
with the word "observable. " So widespread
is this use of the term, "observable, "that it has become
almost an unconscious
habit among physicists. In fact,
we ourselves
used it in our reply' to De Witt. We wish
here
to
apologize
for
furthering
this
confusion
of
' L. von Hove, Physica 18, 145 (1952); A. S. Wightman,
Phys.
Rev. 98, 812 (1955).
terminology,
and to make amends
by trying to clarify
the question
a bit.
Now the common
usage of the term "observable"
is
equivalent
to a kind of unstated
assumption:
In every
theory,
there will be a complete set of wave functions,
which are eigenfunctions
of a complete
commuting
set
of Hermitian
operators,
and
alt of these
operators
are
"observable. "
Where does this assumption
come from? Of course,
the assumption
of linear operators
grew up in the origi-
nal largely
mathematical
theories
of Heisenberg
and
Schrodinger,
laying
the basis of the quantum
theory.
But what
is the origin of the further
assumption
that
all operators
of the
type
described
above
must
be
observable?
The full answer to the above question
is perhaps
as
yet unclear.
Nevertheless,
one can see a number
of
significant
reasons
leading
physicists
to stress the im-
portance
of "observables. " Historically,
there was the
famous principle of "Occam's razor" which enjoins upon
us the desirability
of not multiplying
basic entities and
concepts
in an arbitrary
way, particularly
when
they
cannot
be verified
through
observations.
Then in the
development
of relativity,
the
criticism
of the
un-
observable
absolute space and the ether was an impor-
tant means of freeing thought to allow the consideration
of new ideas. Partly
as a result
of this development,
there was a growing
feeling that one should
avoid the
discussion
of "unobservables"
in physical theories. And
when
the
quantum
theory
came into
existence,
this
feeling
may
well have
been
one of the main
factors
leading
to the identification
of "basic Hermitian
oper-
ators" with "observables. "
While the principle
of trying
to avoid "unobserva-
bles" was in many ways helpful in the recent growth of
physics,
there has arisen what appears to be a harmful
tendency
to regard
this principle
as an absolute truth.
To do this is to be caught in a contradiction;
since there
is no "observable" way of showing that thisis in fact an
absolute truth. Perhaps it is only a principle that should
at the very least be used with "common sense" within
certain limits. However,
it may be possible to go even
further, and to suggest that "unobservables"
may never
be totally
eliminated
in our
thinking
about
physics.
Indeed,
in spite of the strong
effort to get rid of "un-
observables"
in modern
physics,
there
has
been
no
dearth
of them
in recent physical
theories.
However,
they
are
no
longer
called
"entities. " But
instead,
physicists
now call them "mathematical
quantities"
or
"conceptual
aides. " Thus, in quantum
theory,
every-
thing has depended
on the wave function,
which is not,
on the whole,
a very observable
sort of thing.
Then
there are the purely conceptual "waves" and "particles"
in Bohr's principle
of complementarity,
which are also
not "observable"
though they are important
in making
clear the meaning
of the theory.
Then there are the
"virtual states, " "resonance, " and a tremendous
num-
ber of unobservable
concepts
that
physicists
find it

THEORY

convenient
to talk about when they want to understand
the results
of the quantum
theory
and communicate
with other physicists. Besides, in relativity,
we have the
unobservable
coordinate frame, etc. As long as we call it
a "mathematical
quantity, "-or a "conceptual
aide, "
physicists
do not generally
seem to have any real ob-
jection to working
with unobservables.
Indeed,
as we
have suggested
above, it seems that whatever
the reason
may be, it is almost impossible to do theoretical
physics
without
at least thinking
of something
unobservable,
which
makes
the
whole
set of results
cohere,
hang
together, and fit in some rationally
comprehensible
way.
So if we are making a theory of electrodynamics,
can
there be any real objection to calling the vector poten-
tial
a "mathematical
quantity"
and
a "conceptual
aide" which helps us clearly to formulate
the problem of
localizabilityP

operators
cause no real trouble,
since the assumption
that
all such operators
must
be "observable"
in the
usual sense is, in any case, arbitrary.
Just as the wave
function has some not fully observable
features, such as
its phase, so we introduce
Hermitian
operators
for the
vector potential, that are in some similar sense not fully
observable.
After all, what
can be asked of a theory
except
that it be logically
coherent,
fruitful,
easily
comprehensible
as to what are the basic general
prin-
ciples entering
into the determination
of its form, and
in agreement
with
experiments
that
have
been done
with the object of testing it 2 To ask that we reject atl
"unobservable"
Hermitian
operators
seems
a rather
arbitrary
further
requirement.
Although
this require-
ment
is commonly
adopted
in the
entirely
laudable
eBort to avoid philosophical
preconceptions
the fact is
that in effect, it merely amounts
to another
philosoph-
ical notion which may be called the "antiphilosophical
philosophy";
and this philosophy
is even more arbitrary
than the ideas it seeks to avoid.
But the introduction
of "unobservables"
often turns
out to be more than a mere convenience
in thinking.
Sometimes
(though
not always)
it serves as a clue to
genuinely
new
developments.
This is not surprising,
since what is new begins by being Nekeomn
and, there-
fore, must escape the net of the kinds of things that are
"observable. "To suppose that all that we discuss must
be "observable" is indeed equivalent
to assuming
that
we ought already be able to recognize the general forms
of everything
that can be found in nature, and that only
the "details" remain to be filled in. But if there is some-
thing really new, it may not "fit"into what we can now
observe
and recognize at all. Very often, however,
we
can get a vital clue to the unknown
by seeing what is
needed
to give us a coherent
and clear conception
of
certain phenomena
that are already
known.
And here,
it is very likely that something
unobservable
(at least for
the present)
will have to be considered.
There are many examples, but the authors
would like
to consider
the
Hamilton-Jacobi
theory
of classical
mechanics.
Mathematically
this introduced
an action
function, 5, which suggested,
physically,
a wave front,
normal to the particle trajectory. The consideration
of
a whole
wave
front
suggested
an ensemble
(perhaps
statistical)
of particle
trajectories.
Now,
in classical
mechanics,
this wave front was considered to be totally
"unobservable, " since it was supposed
that
only the
particle really existed. But the fact that the Hamilton-
Jacobi theory
gave such a natural
expression
for the
classical canonical
transformation
might, in princip/e,
have suggested
(though it actually
did not) that there
was really
some kind
of a "wave" associated
to the
particles. If this were the case, the action function, S,
would be proportional
to the "phase" of this wave. This
function 5 (or at least its changes)
would, inpri, nciple,
be "observable, " when
one would
be able to do new
kinds of experiments
(e.g., interference)
on the wavelike
aspects of the system. And indeed,
with the advent of
quantum
theory, we are, in fact, "observing" differences
of phase, which did not even have any nseaeAzg in terms
of classical "particle" conceptions.
Now, we propose that as the S function
lent further
mathematical
coherence to the canonical formation
of
classical
physics
and,
in principle,
gave a clue
(not
actually
used)
toward
quantum
phenomena,
so the
electromagnetic
potentials
give coherence to the laws of
electrodynamics,
and in principle
yield clues to further
new phenomena.
But now we may ask, "Why repeat the
mistakes of the past P %hy not try to pay some attention
to the clles provided
by the potentialsP"
In this short
article,
we cannot
go into these clues in much detail.
However,
what is suggested
is that the potentials
are
very important
in expressing
some of the topological and
structlral
relationships
that are behind
the concept of
localizability
of charges
and fields.
(Some preliminary
suggestions
concerning
the
further
signihcance
of
potentials
are given in more detail elsewhere, ""as well
as in the Appendix
of the present
article. ) This is of
possible physical interest, 6rst because if one is going to
give up localizability
(e.g., to get rid of iniinities)
it is
desirable to see with some clarity and depth of under-
standing
what
one is giving
up. Secondly,
since the
potentials
may be related
to qualitatively
new topo-
logical and structural
properties,
they may actually be
"observable, "but only with correspondingly
new (and
as yet unknown)
kinds
of experiments
(as during
the
period of classical physics,
the action function, S, was
not
"observable, " but
became
"observable"
when
electron interference
experiments
were first done).

Mathematically
speaking,
then, it seems that in the
interests
of clarity
of thought
concerning
quantum
theory, it would
be advisable
to give up the unstated
assumption
that all "basic" Hermitian
operators
must
be observable.
When one looks into the question,
one
sees that this assumption
really plays no part in current
theories.
For all the results
of these
theories
would
follow
without
such an assumption,
merely
from the
supposition
that
some
Hermitian
operators
are
ob-
servable. We can leave open the question as to which of
them
are observable
and
which
are not. Moreover,
operators that are not observable
in terms of what can
be known
and recognized at present
may be related to
observation
in new ways,
based
on further
laws
and
concepts, which we might come to learn at some future
date.
Thus far, the very form of quantum
mechanics
seems
to have required
the assumption
of a complete
com-
muting
set of basic Hermitian
operators.
Among these,
for
operators
that
are
"observable"
(by
currently
known
means)
the usual
rules can be assumed
to give
the probability
of a certain result as the square of the
absolute
value of the corresponding
normalized
eigen-
state in the expansion
of the wave function.
But for
operators
that
are
not
"observable"
in the
above-
described sense, there is no need to assume a probability
function at all, e.g., as a "positive definite" metric in
Hilbert
spaces. One can assume
nonde6nite
metrics, "
or one can simply leave the question
of whether
or not
there is a metric of any kind in Hilbert space completely
open. As to what these assumptions
mean in a "phys-
ical" sense, this question
too can be left open. Perhaps
they may be interpreted
later in terms of concepts that
simply
would not be "recognizable"
when expressed
in
terms of current physical and mathematical
conceptions
of the
quantum
theory
(as would
happen
with
the
interference
properties
of electrons, if we tried to state
them in the classical "language" of well-defined
particle
trajectories).
Finally,
we do not even wish to insist that the fea-
tures of the quantum
theory described
above will not
eventually
have to be changed
fundamentally.
But it
does seem desirable that we try to see clearly what we
are assuming,
what
we are changing,
and why
we are
doing so. We have gone rather
extensively
into these
questions,
because it seems that it is important
at this
stage to try to make them as clear as possible; and be-
cause lack of clarity on these points seems to be one of
the reasons why what we have said about potentials
has
apparently
not been sufFiciently
understood.
APPENDIX. SOME REMARKS ON THE RELATIONSHIP
BET%'EEN GAUGE INVARIANCE
AND
LOCALIZABILITY
In this Appendix,
we add some remarks
on the re-
lationship
between
gauge invariance
and localizability
of basic 6eld quantities,
in the sense discussed in Sec. 2.
's S. N. Gupta, Proc Phys. Soc. (L.ondon)
A65, 681 (1951).
It is well known that there is a close analogy between
problems
arising
out of gauge
invariance
in electro-
dynamics
and certain other problems that arise from the
covariance
of the gravitational
6eld equations
in gen-
eral relativity
(see, for example,
the interesting
and
systematic
study
of this subject by Bergmann
and his
co-workers"). It will
be instructive
first to consider
briefly the relationship
of such invariance
problems
to
the question
of localizability
in gravitational
theory,
and then to go on to consider
similar
questions
con-
nected with gauge invariance
in electrodynamics.
General relativistic
covariance
implies that the field
equations
for the gravitational
potentials,
g„„, satisfy
four identities
(Bianchi identities),
so that,
in effect,
four of the potentials
are not determined
by the initial
conditions
and the equations of motion. It is this lack of
determination
which
leaves
room
for
an
arbitrary
coordinate
transformation,
within the framework
of the
gravitational
equations.
Similarly,
in electrodynamics,
the conservation
of charge follows from the field equa-
tions as an identity,
with
the result
that
the theory
leaves
room
for invariance
of physical
results
to an
arbitrary
gauge transformation
of the potentials,
which
is similar
to (but simpler
than)
the transformation
of
gravitational
potentials
brought
about by a change
in
the coordinate
frame.
Now,
as we have indicated
in this paper, it seems
likely from current diS.culties in 6eld theories that at
very short distances,
the laws of physics
will have to
change
fundamentally,
in such a way as to alter the
notion
that
basic 6eld
quantities
are localizable.
In
some rough sense, it could be said that there is probably
a "fundamental
length, " below
which
the basic con-
cepts of current theories cease to be relevant. We have,
in fact, already
discussed
the suggestion"
that in the
domain of the such short distances, space-time
will have
to be described in some inherently
structural
and topo-
logical sense, because it may possess a kind of irreducible
"graininess, " which
denies
the notion
of the perfect
continuity,
that is built into current
6eld theories.
It has often been proposed
that
the "fundamental
length" is of the order of 10 "cm, but we are inclined to
favor the assumption
that it will be of the order
of
10 "cm, the
basic "gravitational
' unit
of distance
(because
such
a fundamental
length
will
signalize
failure of ordinary
notions of metric, and should there-
fore be deeply
related
to gravitational
effects, rather
than to electrical or nuclear interactions,
which are the
main factors at 10 "cm).
If there should be a basic unit of length as described
above, then current theories can have only some limited
degree
of covariance
to arbitrary
coordinate
trans-
formations.
Roughly speaking,
theories will be covariant
only under general transformations
in which the scale of
length
is not changed
so much that physical
structures
such as nuclei are shrunk
down to the size of 10 "cm

and with units in which c= 1.
We then add a very small term
L2—
—Q'/2X,
where
Q=divA+By/Bt
and
X is a suitably
adjusted
(as large-scale
thermodynamic
laws are not invariant,
if objects are shrunk
to atomic dimensions
in a trans-
formation).
We are, therefore,
led to suggest that the
Bianchi identities
which
follow
only for complete
in-
variance,
do not hold ubsolltely,
but only in some very
high degree of approximation.
If this is the case, then
the corresponding
auxiliary
conditions
in the gravita-
tional potentials
will also only be a very good approxi-
mation.
All ten gravitational
potentials
will then have
some
physical
significance.
The four that
should
be
irrelevant
in a continuous
space will in some indirect
sense, represent
the fundamental
unit, underlying
the
discrete structure of space-time. In this way the assump-
tion of a basic "graininess"
to space-time,
a step that
will probably
eliminate
the infinities
of current
field
theories, is seen also to get rid of the auxiliary conditions
in the gravitational
potentials
which create such com-
plicated
problems
in the quantum
theory. In place of
auxiliary
conditions
determined
by certain
operators,
there
will be equations
implying
a quantum
state, in
which there is a probability
distribution
of these oper-
ators, which
would
be a delta function,
if space-time
were continuous.
However,
if, as we assume,
it is not
continuous,
the width
of this probability
distribution
will determine
the relationship
of the coordinate
frame
to the basic unit of length
(i.e., it will imply the size of
the basic "grains, " as specified
in terms
of the given
coordinate
frame).
A similar point of view can be adopted with regard to
electrodynamics.
Thus,
we need
not regard
the sub-
sidiary conditions
as satisfied exactly, but rather,
only
to a very high degree of approximation.
Then we can,
for example, avoid the problem that the wave function
is a delta function
of BA„/Bx&. Now, it will be spread
over a 6nite but small range of this operator. Of course,
charge
will not,
in general,
be conserved,
if this
is
assumed.
But the failure of conservation
may be very
small, such that transitions
in which the charge "quan-
tum
number"
is changed
will be much
weaker
than
those in which isospin and strangeness
are not conserved,
so weak in fact that the phenomenon
of charge
non-
conservation
has not yet been observed.
We can illustrate
this idea briefIy by first considering
the ordinary
Lagrangian
for the electromagnetic
field:
constant. The total Lagrangian
is then
L=Lg+L2.
All components
of the potential
now have canonically
conjugate momenta.
Thus,
II= a/4~
is canonically
conjugate to A, while
Q= (1/X) (By/Bt+divA)
is canonically
conjugate to y. The Hamiltonian
is then
II'+K'
t'

+~ p—
~y—j A+—Q'—QdivA,
Sm
~
4x I
2
where
p is the
charge
density
and j is the current
density.
One readily
obtains
among
the equations
of
motion, the following:
VXK
B8/Bt = 4—nj
XVQ, . —
V 8=47rp+XBQ/Bt,
Q= (4~/X) (Bp/Bt+divj).
There is no subsidiary
condition is this theory. But as
X—
+ 0, we readily
verify that the wave function
cor-
responding
to the lowest state of excitation
of Q ap-
proaches a delta function
of divA+By/Bt.
In general,
divj+Bp/Bt&0
so that charge and current are not con-
served, but as X~ 0, divj+ Bp/Bt —
+ 0 and the equations
for 8 and X approach
Maxwell's
equations.
The width
of the probability
distribution
in Q will be small enough
so that L2—
—Q'/2wAill
approach
zero as X —
+ 0.
We note that
the equations
for 8 and 3! have,
as
"effective sources" for the fields, the quantities
4~j—VQ
and 4mp+BQ/Bt. So in. this theory, the electromagnetic
field is distributed
as if it had some other source than
the particle
positions
(which latter
do not in general
give rise even to a perfectly
conserved
charge current).
In this way, the "self-field" of a particle
is effectively
"generated" at some distance from the particle, so that
its reaction back on the particle need not be as large as
it is in the usual theory.
We see, then,
that
giving
up
gauge
invariance
is
equivalent,
indirectly,
to altering
some of the assump-
tions
on localizability
of interaction
of charge
and
current.
However,
to take full advantage
of the possi-
bility of doing this, it is necessary also to give up perfect
conservation
of charge, as would,
in any case, be only
natural,
if we regard
this theory as the precursor
of a
further
development,
in
which
the
"graininess"
of
space-time
would be taken into account. For in a dis-
crete space-time a differential
equation for conservation
of charge would,
in any case, have no meaning.
It seems to be possible to obtain a further insight into
the relation of the possible "graininess" of space-time to

1632

the factor of gauge
invariance
of electrodynamics
by
considering
some
proposals
of Yang
and
Mills'4
and
Utiyama. " These authors
introduce
an abstract
iso-
space such that electrodynamical
gauge invariance
is a
consequence
of invariance
of the
theory
to certain
transformations
in this space. In particular,
a gauge
transformation
corresponds
to
the
"independent"
rotation of neighboring
regions of isospace, so that gauge
invariance
expresses the complete "localizability" of the
influence
of 6elds in indefinitely
small
regions
of iso-
space. The analogy to general relativity
is that covari-
ance to space-time
transformations
implies
a similar
possibility
of "independent"
deformation
of each small
region
of space-time
in such a transformation,
thus
expressing the indefinite "localizability" of the effects of
fields in real space-time.
(If the isospace is extended to
several
dimensions,
then one can also subject strange-
ness and isospin properties
to a similar treatment,
thus
opening
the
way
to
a
more
general
approach
to
the
theory
of the
quantum
numbers
of elementary
particles. )
Thus far, we have
considered
only an Oealogy
be-
tween isospace and the space-time of general relativity.
But with the aid of some of the notions suggested
in a
more recent work,"it is possible to go further
and to
bring in a definite relationship
between these two spaces.
For the abstract isospace has been interpreted
in terms
of a real space-time
structure
of elementary
particles.
(In fact, it is just this concept of structure
that has been
developed
further
in the topological theories" to which
we referred
earlier in the present paper. )

' L. de Broglie, D. Bohm, F. Halwachs,
P. Hillion, T, Taka-
boyasi, and J. P. Vigier, Phys. Rev. 129, 438 (1963).
It follows then that if there is a basic "graininess" to
space-time,
this may
have
implications
not only for
general
relativistic
transformations,
but
also for iso-
space transformations,
which
reflect
the behavior
of
structures
in relativistic
space-time. Roughly
speaking,
over a region of the size of a "grain" one can no longer
allow
"independent"
rotations
of smaller
subregions,
because the notion of such a subregion
no longer has its
usual meaning. Thus, there is established a limit both to
general
relativistic
covariance,
and to invariance
to
transformations
in isospace
and,
therefore,
to gauge
invariance
and detailed
conservation
of charge. As a
result it becomes possible to give a physical signiGcance
to all four components,
A„, of the potential,
which
now
determine
not only the 6eld quantities
8 and $C in the
usual way, but also, in a more indirect way, the "scale
factor, " below which continuous
notions of space-time
and detailed
conservation
of charge cease to apply. At
the
same
time,
current
dif6culties
associated
to the
subsidiary
conditions
are
evidently
bypassed
as ir-
relevant,
since these
conditions
are now replaced
by
well-defined
relationships
satis6ed
by
the
quantum
state of the whole 6eld.
It is evident that these proposals
constitute
a parti-
cular case of the suggestion
in Sec. 5 of this paper to
regard
the potentials
as clues to some new features
of
space-time
and properties
of charge. In this way, one
may
perhaps
obtain
insights
into
the
reasons
why
potentials
seem to be "essential"
for expressing
the
property
of /ocalisability
in a simple
and natural
way.
A more systematic
development
of such a point of
view is now being carried out, in which the "graininess"
of space-time
is interpreted
in terms of topological
and
structural
concepts. It is hoped that this will soon be
ready for publication.
