About the Authors
Michelle Rose Gilman
“I get up every morning determined to both change the world and have one heck of a
good time. Sometimes this makes planning the day difficult.” — E.B. White
Michelle Rose Gilman is proud to be known as Noah’s mom (Hi Noah!). A graduate from the
University of South Florida, Michelle found her niche early and at 19 was already working
with emotionally disturbed and learning-disabled students in hospital settings. At 21 she
made the trek to California and there she found her passion for helping teenage students
become more successful in school and life. What started as a small tutoring business in the
garage of her California home, quickly expanded and grew to the point where traffic con-
trol was necessary on her residential street. Today, Michelle is the Founder and CEO of
Fusion Learning Center, a private school and tutoring/test prep facility in Solana Beach, CA,
serving over 2,000 students per year. She has taught tens of thousands of students since
1988. She created the Mentoring Approach to Learning and is the author of various books
on self-esteem, writing, and motivational topics. Michelle founded the Addiction and
Recovery Division at Fusion and has overseen dozens of programs focused on helping kids
become healthy adults. She currently specializes in motivating the unmotivatable adoles-
cent, comforting their shell-shocked parents, and assisting her staff of 27 teachers.
Michelle lives by the following motto:
“There are people content with longing; I am not one of them.”
Veronica Saydak
Veronica graduated from the University of San Diego with a Bachelors Degree in English. She
found her real education in travel and seeing the world. She has traveled to over 12 coun-
tries, studying various cultures through their literature and lifestyles. She has been a highly
coveted English teacher, specializing in writing, for over 4 years. Currently, Veronica is the
Director of Student Development at Fusion Learning Center, where she is responsible for pro-
gram development, staff supervision, and teaching her students on a one-to-one basis. As an
administrator, Veronica specializes in the emotional well-being of over 400 students. Her wit
and humor might not solve the world’s problems but it definitely makes the world feel
lighter. Veronica takes the following advice from one of her favorite authors, Goethe:
“Certain defects are necessary for the existence of individuality.”
Suzee Vlk
“I’m not a complete idiot. Parts of me are missing.”
Although more likely to admit to being a used-car salesperson, Suzee Vlk was a test prep
specialist from 1975 to her death in 2003, working her way through graduate business
school and law school teaching courses in ACT, SAT I, GRE, GMAT, and LSAT preparation.
By her own description, she found the paranoia and take-no-prisoners mindset required for
doing well on the ACT a big help in developing cutthroat tactics to use in the boardroom or
courtroom. Eventually, she became president of Suzee Vlk Test Prep and taught thousands

of students in dozens of courses at universities and private corporations. She wrote mate-
rial used in SAT and GRE preparation software and videos. Her prep books for the ACT and
other standardized exams have been published worldwide. Suzee lived by the following
motto, which she delighted in sharing with others:
“Madness takes its toll. Please have exact change ready.”

Dedication
This book is humbly dedicated to the thousands of students who have, over the years,
passed through Fusion Learning Center. When the teacher is ready, the right student
appears. You have taught us well. And to the memory of Suzee Vlk, the original author,
whose humor, wit, and intelligence live on in these pages.

The ACT For Dummies, 4th Edition 

Introduction
W
elcome to The ACT For Dummies, 4th Edition. This is a nondiscriminatory, equal-
opportunity book. You’re welcome to participate whether you are a genius or (like us )
you need a recipe to make ice. Besides, the title is not a slam at you. You’re not the dummy;
the test is (and we’ve heard it called worse, believe us — especially the Friday night before
the exam).
About This Book
The goal of this book is to show you exactly how to survive this ridiculous situation. No
matter how excellent your high school teachers are (or were), they prepared you for the Real
World, a world that, alas, has very little connection to the ACT. High school teachers can give
you a good foundation in grammar, reading, science, and math skills (the areas tested on 
the ACT), but think of them as the friendly old GPs, the general practitioners whose job is to
keep you well or handle the little day-to-day problems. What do you do when you have a
crisis that’s making you really sick, like the ACT? We like to think of The ACT For Dummies, 
4th Edition, as a loony but gifted specialist you can call in when the situation is desperate.
No one wants to deal with the eccentric specialist for too terribly long. The goal of this book,
just like the goal of the expert, is to come in with the Code Blue crash cart, deal with the situ-
ation, and then leave rapidly with as few lives destroyed as possible. This book has one goal:
to prepare you for the ACT — period. It is not our heart’s desire to teach you every grammar
rule ever created or every math formula Einstein knew. No extra “filler” material is included
in this book to make it look fat and impressive on bookstore shelves. If you want a thick book
to use as a booster seat for the vertically challenged, go find War and Peace. If you’re looking
for something that you can use to prepare you for the ACT as quickly and painlessly as possi-
ble, again we say to you, welcome to The ACT For Dummies, 4th Edition.
You Can Run, but You Can’t Hide
There is no escaping the ACT. Many colleges require you to take this entrance exam before
they will even look at your application. Some colleges will accept scores from either the ACT
or the SAT. (It just so happens that Wiley publishes an SAT I For Dummies book as well, should
you choose to take that exam.) Many students decide to take both tests to see which one
they do better on. Is that a good idea? Absolutely. If you have the option of taking either the
ACT or the SAT, take both.
Many colleges emphasize ACT scores to compensate for grade inflation. That is, some high
schools may give you an A for doing the same level work that would gain you a C in other
high schools. It’s certainly not fair that a person at an “easy” high school has a 4.0 while a
student at a more demanding high school has a 3.0 for doing the same work. Because the
ACT is the same for everyone (students nationwide take the exact same exam), colleges
can use the scores to get inside your head and see what’s really there. Think of this as an

opportunity, not a crisis: A good ACT score can overcome a low GPA. In just a few hours one
fine Saturday morning, you can make up a little for years of messing up in school.
In The ACT For Dummies, 4th Edition, you find out which types of questions are on the exam,
which questions to work on carefully, and which to guess at quickly (good news: The ACT
has no penalty for wrong answers; you should guess at absolutely every question you don’t
know), the approach to each type of question, and, perhaps most important, some traps that
are built into each question style. We have been test-prep tutors for many years and have
developed a list of the “gotchas” that have trapped thousands of students over the years. Let
us see whether we can make them trap you, as well.
This book is also full of the substantive information that you need to know, including gram-
mar rules and geometry, algebra, and arithmetic formulas. Naturally, we include some truly
sick humor, on the principle that, as you’re groaning at our jokes, you won’t notice that
you’re suffering from the questions. (Hey, as the mushroom said to his friends, “Of course,
everyone likes me. I’m a fun-gi!”)
Note to nontraditional students: The days of high school may be just a fading memory for you
(along with your thin waistline and full head of hair). We recognize that not everyone taking
the ACT is a high school junior or senior. Maybe you took a few years off to build your career
or to nurture a family (or to pay your debt to society) and are now having to go back and
review what you thought you had left behind years ago. As the Walrus said, “I weep with you; I
deeply sympathize.” It can be totally frustrating to have to deal with the subjunctive or plu-
perfect or quadratic equations all over again. Postpone your nervous breakdown. Things
aren’t as dismal as they look. You’ll probably be surprised how quickly material comes back
to you as you go through this book. If you need more hands-on instruction such as private
tutoring, call a high school or community college. Someone there will almost certainly be able
to recommend a low-cost course or a tutor. The local library can also give you some help.
How This Book Is Organized
The ACT For Dummies, 4th Edition, is organized into seven parts to help you quickly get right
to the chapters you need.
Part I: Coming to Terms with Reality: 
An Overview of the ACT
Part I is an overview of the exam, explaining what it tests, how the scoring works, and so on.
You also get some tips on how to do well on the test, plus an overview of what colleges want
from you.
Part II: Serving Your “Sentence”: 
English Review and Test
Part II introduces the English portion of the ACT, explaining the format of the questions, sug-
gesting how best to prepare for the test, and presenting a grammar review that refreshes
your memory on all the piddling little points you once knew but have long forgotten.
2
The ACT For Dummies, 4th Edition 

Part III: Writing the Writing Test Rightly: 
You Have a Choice
Okay, so you really don’t have to take the ACT writing test. However, considering that many
colleges and universities require the writing ACT, we recommend you study the chapters in
this section very carefully and plan to do some writing!
Part IV: Don’t Count Yourself Out: 
The Math Review and Mini-Test
The Math materials show you strategies for doing well on this portion of the exam. As a “gift
with purchase,” you also get three math reviews: geometry, algebra, and miscellaneous math.
Part V: Time to Read the Riot ACT: 
The Reading Test
Sure you can read, but can you read fast enough to get through all the reading passages and
answer all the questions? This part gives you strategies for doing so, saving you time and
brain cells.
Part VI: Proven to Cause Brain Defects 
in Laboratory Rats: The Science Reasoning Test
This part introduces you to a test unique to the ACT: Science Reasoning. Here, you find out
how to analyze the various types of science passages and graphs, plus get techniques for
doing your best on each type. You also find tips to help you recognize your own strengths
and weaknesses and make the best use of your time.
Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: 
Full-Length Practice ACTs
This is the part you’ve either been waiting for or dreading. Here, you find two full-length
ACTs that look similar to the real deal. Although these questions are not identical to what
you’ll see on the ACT, they’re close enough for good practice.
Part VIII: The Part of Tens
Assuming you’ve survived all that excitement, the book finishes up with the good stuff, The
Parts of Tens. These are lists of ten points (sometimes nine, sometimes eleven — no one
wants to be too stuffy) to remember. There’s much good stuff in this part, and it’s also a lot of
fun to read.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
Some information in this book is really, really important. We flag it by using an icon (and if
Icon, hey, anyone con . . .). For example, if we know of a particular trap that most students
fall for, I put a Traps & Tricks icon next to the explanation. If we have some time-saving tips,
an icon goes next to them, as well. Here are the examples of the icons:
Burn this stuff into your brain or carve it into your heart; it’s the really important material.
If you skip or ignore the Heads Up icons, you won’t get your money’s worth out of this book.
These are the “gotchas” that can kill you before you know that you’re dead. Pay special
attention to the cheesy notes marked with this mousetrap.
Follow the arrow to score a bull’s-eye by using these shortcut tips.
This icon marks sample problems.
This icon points out information pertaining to international students — which questions are
worth doing and which ones are “guess and go on.”
This little ragged edge shows up on chapter pages containing practice tests and questions.
Keep an eye out for it if you want to find those practice sessions quickly!
Where to Go from Here
You’ve probably heard the joke about the student who was debating over whether to buy 
a book at the bookstore. The sales clerk, eager to make his commission, proclaims, “Buy
this book — it’ll do half the work for you!” The student brightens up and exclaims, “Great!
I’ll take two!”
As much as we wish we could simply transfer test-taking material into your brain in one
dump, we realize that learning it takes effort on your part. Meet us halfway. We’ve done our
job by showing you what and how to learn; now it’s your turn. We suggest two ways to use
this book:
 First, fine-tune your skills. Maybe you’re already a math whiz and just need help with the
English grammar. Go right to the English portion. Maybe you’re a grammar guru who
wouldn’t know a nonagon if you met one in a dark alley. The math review is for you.
 Second, start from scratch. Lock yourself into your room, lay in a sack of food and
some sharpened pencils, and go through this book word for word. Don’t worry; it’s not
4
The ACT For Dummies, 4th Edition 

as bad as it seems. Actually, starting from scratch is the preferred method. Many stu-
dents make what we call the “mediocre mistake”: They are good at one section, mediocre
at a second, and dismal at the third. They spend all their time in their worst section
and barely look at the sections that they’re mediocre or good in. Big mistake! If you
spend two hours studying something that’s totally incomprehensible to you, you may
improve your score a few points. If you spend two hours studying your mediocre mate-
rial, you may improve your score by ten or twelve points. Ten points that you gain in
your mediocre section are just as valuable — and a heck of a lot easier to gain — than
ten points you gain in your weakest section. Humor us and read the book from cover to
cover. You’ll pick up some great material . . . and a few new jokes along the way.
Making a Commitment
In the real world, you have classes, family obligations, sports practices, and, if you’re lucky, a
social life. How on earth are you going to fit studying for the ACT into your schedule? The
answer is that you have to commit to this project and make it a priority. How many hours
exactly should you carve out of your schedule? Here is what we suggest.
This book features two full-length ACTs. Each ACT takes 2 hours and 55 minutes, not includ-
ing breaks. You may take about an hour to review your errors on each exam. (Not that you’ll
make that many mistakes, but we’d like you to review the answer explanations to every ques-
tion, not just to the ones you miss. Doing so provides you with yet another opportunity to
see shortcuts you may not have noticed or traps you luckily avoided.)
Basically, therefore, each exam should take you 41⁄2 hours, for a total of 9 hours. In addition,
this book has five general parts (English, writing, math, reading, and science), each of which
should take you about an hour. At the end of each part is a short practice exam requiring
about 30 minutes to take and review. Therefore, each of these chapters is an hour and a half,
for a total of 71⁄2 hours.
This book features a very important grammar review that we strongly suggest you spend at
least 2 hours on. Even if you are good at grammar, this section features all sorts of persnick-
ety grammar rules, just the type that (with your luck) you’d get caught on during the ACT.
And finally, the book features three math reviews: geometry, algebra, and arithmetic, each of
which should take you about an hour. Here’s the final timetable:
Activity
Time
Five Parts and sets of practice questions at 11⁄2 hours per part/set
71⁄2 hours
Two practice exams at 41⁄2 hours per exam
9 hours
Three math review chapters at 1 hour per chapter
3 hours
One grammar review chapter at 2 hours
2 hours
Time spent groaning in pain at authors’ lame jokes
10 minutes
Time spent firing off letter complaining about authors’ lame jokes 
10 minutes (or sending us
your better ones!)
TOTAL TIME
21 hours, 50 minutes
Fear not: You don’t have to do all 21 hours and 50 minutes at once. The book is designed so
that you can start at any unit at any time. You don’t have to have finished the general math
chapter, for example, before you go through the general reading chapter.

Introduction

Okay, are you ready? Are you quivering with anticipation, living for the moment when you
can pick up your yellow No. 2 pencil and head for the thrills of a lifetime? (Or are you think-
ing, “These authors got to get a life!”?) Listen, you’re going to take the ACT anyway, so you
may as well have a good time learning how to do so. Laughing while learning is the whole
purpose of this book. Take a deep breath, rev up the brain cells, and go for it! Good luck. Just
remember that for you, ACT can come to stand for Ace Conquers Test!

Part I
Coming to Terms 
with Reality: An 
Overview of the ACT

In this part . . .
T
he reality is that you have to take the ACT. Reality
bites. But by knowing what the ACT looks like and
what you can expect, you may be able to bite back.
Although you are undoubtedly eager to get right to study-
ing for the ACT (Hello, what planet am I from?), please
take a few minutes to go through this introductory mater-
ial. Think of the ACT as a blind date: Knowing a little bit
about what you’ll encounter can lower your anxiety level
at least a smidgen.
In addition, this part features a chapter that gives you vital
info about how to beat stress, avoid careless mistakes, and
recognize common ways you may mess up their scores.
Saving the best for last, this part also has an interview with
an independent college counselor who presents answers to
the question, “What do the colleges want from me?”

 Avoiding dead weight: What not to take to the test
 Dealing with unusual circumstances: What to do if you’re someone special

A
re you the type who jumps in the cold water all at once instead of just dipping your
toe in a little at a time? If so, do we have a table for you! Table 1-1 gives you an
overview of the ACT and shocks you with the entire kit and caboodle all at once.

If you add up the numbers, you find that you have 216 questions to answer in 205 minutes;
205 minutes is 3 hours and 25 minutes, or nearly 31⁄2 hours. You get one ten-minute break
between tests two and three (the Mathematics and the Reading tests). If you opt to not take
the optional writing test, then you get to happily walk out right after the Science test. If you
include the time in the classroom spent giving out the tests, explaining the directions, check-
ing your ID, and so on, your whole morning is shot. You may as well figure on giving up 4 to
41⁄2 hours for this test.
I’d Forget My Head If It Wasn’t Attached: 
What to Take to the ACT
If you can’t borrow the brain of that whiz kid in your calculus class, you’re stuck using your
own. In addition, be sure that you have the following with you:

 Admission ticket: By about two weeks before the exam, you should have received your
ticket in the mail. If you don’t have the ticket by then or if you got it but lost it, call the
ACT at 319-337-1270.
 Pencils: Take a bunch of sharpened No. 2 pencils with you. You may also want to take a
big eraser (nothing personal, everyone makes mistakes) and a small pencil sharpener.
 Map or directions: Go to the test center a few days before the actual exam, and scope
out your driving route and parking area. Often, the ACT is given at colleges that have
parking lots far, far from the test rooms. Drive to the college a few days in advance,
park your car, and see just how long it takes you to get to the room. You don’t need the
stress of having to run to the test room at the last minute.
 Clothing: Rumor has it some weird kids are lobbying for a special Nude ACT. Until it
becomes available, you need to have some sort of external covering. Take a few extra
layers. The heat often is turned off for the weekend in many classrooms (the ACT is
usually offered on a Saturday), and the room can be freezing cold. Alternately, in the
summer, schools turn off the air conditioning, making the room boiling hot. Dress in
layers and be prepared for anything.
 Photo ID: Showing the birthmark your boyfriend thinks is so cute isn’t going to cut it
with the proctor. You need to bring a photo ID (student ID, driver’s license, passport,
military ID, FBI Most Wanted mug shot, whatever). If you don’t have a photo ID, you
can bring a letter of identification from your school. (The ACT registration booklet goes
into detail about what this letter entails; we won’t bore you with that information here.)
 Eyeglasses: Students frequently forget their reading glasses at home and then squint for
the next four hours. The ACT itself is enough of a headache; you don’t need eyestrain,
as well. And if you wear contacts, be sure to bring cleaning/wetting solution in case
you have to take the lenses out and reinsert them. (Hey, all those tears can really mess
up your lenses!)
 A snack: True, your break is only ten minutes between tests two and three, but that’s
enough time to gobble down something to jump-start your brain. We often suggest
taking an energy bar or some peanuts, something with protein and carbohydrates.
Scarfing down a candy bar is actually counterproductive; your sugar levels rise only
momentarily and then drop down below where they were before you had your choco-
late fix.
 A watch: If your watch has an alarm, turn it off so that you don’t disturb the other stu-
dents. If you don’t know how to do so, borrow another watch. The proctor will take a
beeping watch away from you.
 A calculator: ACT gurus finally joined the 20th century and agreed to allow students to
use calculators. Although the ACT information bulletin has an entire quarter page
detailing which calculators can and cannot be used, for all practical purposes, you can
use any calculator (yes, even a graphing calculator) as long as it doesn’t make a noise.
You may not use a laptop computer (don’t laugh; you’d be surprised by how many of
my students want to bring one to the test!) or a pocket organizer.
What Not to Take to the ACT
Believe it or not, you shouldn’t take some things to the test, such as the following:
 Books and notes: Last-minute studying won’t do you much good. Forget the books; you
won’t be allowed to take them into the test room with you. (Just be sure to tell this to
your parents. We once had a student whose mother drove all the way to the test center
with her daughter’s ACT prep book, thinking the girl needed it for the test. The mom
actually pulled the girl out of the test to give her the book, resulting in the girl’s nearly
being disqualified from continuing.)
10
Part I: Coming to Terms with Reality: An Overview of the ACT 

 Scratch paper: You may not bring your own scratch paper, and no scratch paper will be
given to you during the exam. Fortunately, the exam booklet has plenty of blank space
on which you may do your calculations.
Normal Is Boring: Unusual Circumstances
Not everyone takes the ACT under the same conditions. You may have a special circum-
stance that can allow you to change the date of the ACT or the way you take your exam. Here
is a brief list of special circumstances and how they affect your ACT.
 Learning disabilities: If you have a diagnosed learning disability, you may be able to get
special accommodations. You may have extended time, but you must specifically
request this on your application form. Please note that in order to get special testing,
you must have been diagnosed LD professionally and must have a current, individual-
ized plan at school. Talk to your counselor for further information.
 Physical disabilities: If you have a physical disability, you may be allowed to take a test in
a special format — in Braille, large print, or on audiocassette. If your disability is physi-
cal, do not complete a registration folder; write to the ACT Universal Testing and
receive a form called “Request for ACT Assessment: Special Testing.” This booklet
explains your options.
 Religious obligations: If your religion prohibits you from taking a test on a Saturday, you
may test on an alternate date. The ACT registration bulletin specifies dates and loca-
tions in each state.
 Military duty: If you’re an active military person, you don’t complete the normal regis-
tration form. Instead, ask your Educational Services Officer about testing through
DANTES (Defense Activity for Nontraditional Educational Support).
Anything’s Better than Nothing: 
Guessing for Points
Scoring on the ACT is very straightforward:
 You get one point for every answer you get right.
 You get zero points for every answer you omit.
 You get zero points for every wrong answer.
11
Chapter 1: Getting Your ACT Together: The Format
The watch game: Using your watch to simplify the test
Here’s the deal. The proctor — whom you’re pretty sure
you saw on America’s Most Wanted last week — tells
you at 8:47 that you may begin a 45-minute section. You
have 75 questions. The time is now 9:29, and you’re on
question 30. How are you doing for time? Can you relax
and slow down, or are you entering Panic City?
Who needs this kind of stress? It’s like adding on
another whole math problem. Don’t strain your brain;
make life easier by resetting your watch. What’s your
lucky number? Three? When the proctor tells you to
begin, set your watch for 2:15. That way, you’re count-
ing down the minutes to your lucky number. A glance at
your watch tells you how many minutes you have left.
Who cares what the time is outside in the real world?
You can use your watch as a stopwatch for the exam,
not as a timepiece.

The ACT is absolutely wonderful in that it does not penalize you for wrong answers. (The SAT
subtracts a fraction of a point for every question you miss. The ACT does not.) Therefore,
guessing on the ACT obviously works to your advantage. Never leave anything blank. We sug-
gest that you save a couple of minutes at the end of each section just to go through the test
and make sure that you’ve filled in an answer for every single question.
Your Number’s Up: Scoring
We once had a frustrated student tell us that the scores on the ACT looked like measure-
ments to him: 34, 29, 36. However, the ACT has four scores, which makes for a very strange
set of measurements! The ACT scores are nothing like high school scores based on percent-
ages. They are not even like the more familiar SAT scores that range from 200 to 800. The
ACT scores are as follows:
 Each test (English, Mathematics, Reading, and Science Reasoning) goes from 1 (low) to
36 (high). The Writing scores go from 1 (low) to 6 (high).
 You also have a composite score, which is the average of the four test scores.
 Three of the tests have subscores. The subscores in English, Mathematics, and Reading
range from 1 to 18. Don’t assume that the subscores determine the total score. That
would be too easy and too logical. The subscores are determined independently and
do not necessarily add up to the total score in a section.
 A percentile score tells you where you rank in your state and nationwide.
So How Do I Know that I’m a 
Genius? What Scores Mean
Look at the percentiles. Just knowing you got a 26 doesn’t tell you much. You need to know
whether a 26 is a 50th percentile, a 75th percentile, or a 99th percentile. If you got a 36, be
prepared to be accepted at any college nationwide!
What Do They Want from Me? What Is Tested?
The following subjects are tested on the ACT:
 English: The ACT tests English grammar. You are expected to know the fundamentals of
usage, diction, and rhetorical skills. For example, you must understand sentence con-
struction — what makes a run-on and what makes a fragment. You need to know how
to distinguish between commonly confused words, like affect and effect or principal and
principle. You must be able to use the proper forms of words, distinguishing between
an adjective and an adverb. If you don’t have a strong grammar background (you prob-
ably have been studying literature for the past few years and haven’t had grammar
since about the seventh grade), don’t panic. This book features a gruesomely exhaus-
tive grammar review with just about everything you’ll need to know.
Surprisingly, the ACT English Test is one of the strongest portions of this exam for inter-
national students. You learned all these picky grammar points as you learned English.
You may be much more comfortable with the rules than native English speakers are.
12
Part I: Coming to Terms with Reality: An Overview of the ACT 

 Mathematics: The ACT requires basic skills in arithmetic, geometry, and algebra. If you
have had two semesters of algebra, two semesters of geometry, and a general math
background, you can answer probably 90 percent of the questions. Unfortunately, the
ACT also tests a little bit of trigonometry. If you have not had trigonometry, don’t worry.
This book gives you the few things you need to know. In addition, the test has only a
few trig questions (usually just four), and they are often so close to the end that many
students don’t even get to them anyway. Trig should be the least of your worries.
You don’t have to know calculus. The ACT has no calculus questions. Happy day!
 Reading: You are expected to be able to read a passage in a relatively short amount of
time and answer questions based upon it. Your reading skills are probably pretty set 
by now. If you are 17, you are not going to change the way you’ve been reading for the
past 12 years. However, this fact does not mean you cannot improve your reading
score. Chapter 12 shows you tricks that you can use to improve your speed and tells
you how to recognize and avoid traps built into the questions.
 Science Reasoning: You are not required to have any specific science background. The
passages may test chemistry, biology, botany, physics, or any other science, but you
do not have to have had those courses. The test gives all the information you need to
answer the science questions in the passages or in diagrams, charts, and tables.
 Optional Writing Test: You are not required to take this test, but we suggest that you do.
The ACT folks added this section to test your writing ability (an extremely important
component for college success). Don’t worry, you’ve been writing for years. And the
ACT people know that you can’t possibly write a perfect essay in a measly 30 minutes.
What they will be focusing on is your thesis, your organization, and your ability to sup-
port your thoughts.
Practice Makes Perfect: Repeating the Test
Are you allowed to repeat the ACT? Yes. Should you repeat the ACT? Probably. Decide
whether to repeat the ACT based on your answers to the following questions:
 What errors did I make the first time around? If your mistakes were from a lack of knowl-
edge, that is, you just plain didn’t know a grammar rule or a math formula, you can
easily correct those mistakes with studying. However, if you made mistakes because you
were careless or if you daydreamed during the exam, that may be a personality quirk
that you’re not going to change. Very few people who are careless test-takers change
their test style overnight.
 Why do I want to repeat the test? Is your ego destroyed because your best friend got 
a better score than you did? That is probably not a good enough reason to retake the
ACT. Do retake the exam if you are trying to get a minimum qualifying score to enable
you to get into a college or into a scholarship program.
 Can I go through this all over again? How seriously did you take studying the first time
around? If you gave it all you had, you may be too burned out to go through that again.
On the other hand, if you just zoomed through the booklet and didn’t spend much time
preparing for the test, you have a second chance to show your stuff.
 Were the mistakes caused by factors that were not my fault? Maybe you were in a fender-
bender on your way to the exam, or perhaps you stayed up late the night before in an
argument with your parents or your boyfriend or girlfriend. If you just weren’t up to
par when you took the exam, definitely take it again, and this time be sure to get a good
night’s sleep the night before.

 Identifying and sidestepping ten easy ways to mess up your score
O
n the wall of my office, we have a padded cushion that is imprinted with the words, 
“BANG HEAD HERE!” We’ve found that most of our students use it either to reduce
stress (we guess one headache can replace another!) or — much more commonly — to
express their exasperation over unnecessary, careless (we’re trying not to say it, but okay —
dumb!) mistakes. Going through the material in this chapter about how to relax and how to
recognize and avoid common mistakes can prevent your having to be a head-banger later.
Four Stress-Busters to Help You Survive the ACT
Most people are tense before a test, with butterflies dancing in their stomachs. The key is to
use relaxation techniques that keep your mind on your test and not on your tummy.
Counting to four
Breathing is grossly underrated. Breathing is good. Take a deep breath until your belly
expands, hold it for four counts, and then expel the air for four counts. Try not to take short,
shallow breaths, which can cause you to become even more anxious, because your body is
deprived of oxygen.
Stretching
Rotate your head around to stretch out and relax your neck muscles. (We suggest keeping
your eyes closed while doing this so the proctor doesn’t think that you’re trying to cheat.)
Hunch and roll your shoulders to help relax your back and spine. You’ll be sitting for more
than three hours, so maintaining good posture is crucial. Shake out your hands like you have
a writer’s cramp. Imagine that all your tension and stress is going out through your finger-
tips. Extend and push out your legs like you’re pushing something away with your heels.
Point your toes back toward your knees and hold that position for a count of three.

Practicing visualization
Don’t do this during the test; you just waste time and lose concentration. However, before
the exam or during the break, practice visualization. Close your eyes and imagine yourself 
in the test room cheerfully looking at questions that you know the answers to, filling in the
bubble grids to the right answers, finishing early, and double-checking your work. Picture
yourself leaving the exam room all uplifted, and then five weeks later, getting your scores and
rejoicing. Think of how proud of you your parents are. Imagine getting an acceptance letter
from the college of your dreams. Picture yourself driving a fire-engine-red Ferrari ten years
from now, telling the Time magazine reporter in the passenger seat that your success started
with your excellent ACT scores. The goal is to associate the ACT with good feelings.
Thinking positively
Any time you feel yourself starting to panic or thinking negative thoughts, make a conscious
effort to say to yourself, “Stop! Don’t dwell on anything negative.” And then switch over to a
positive track. Suppose that you catch yourself thinking, “Why didn’t I study this math more?
I saw that formula a hundred times but can’t remember it now!” Change the script to, “I got
most of this math right; if I leave my subconscious to work on that formula, maybe I’ll get it,
too. No sense worrying now. Overall, I think I’m doing great!”
Nine Points to Always Double-Check
One father’s favorite thing to say before his child takes a test is, “Always double-check! If
your mother and I had double-checked before we left the hospital with you, we might have
brought home a normal child . . . .”
Mental and emotional child abuse aside, that dad has a point. Double-checking is integral to
getting what you want. The test-makers know what types of careless mistakes students make,
so they build those mistakes into the test. This section shares some of the most common
areas in which test-takers get sloppy.
Exponents
Make sure that as you multiplied like bases, you added the exponents (x5 × x5 = x10), and that
as you divided like bases, you subtracted the exponents (x9 ÷ x3 = x6). Forgetting this and just
multiplying (x5 × x5 = x25) or dividing (x9 ÷ x3 = x3) instead of adding or subtracting is all too
easy to do.
Common-sense connections
Think about what a math question is asking. If you are asked to find the weight of a child, and
your answer is 400 pounds, something went haywire somewhere. If McCaela is bicycling, and
you deduce that she bikes at a rate of 220 mph, sign that woman up for the Olympics!
16
Part I: Coming to Terms with Reality: An Overview of the ACT 

Decimal places
If a question has two or more answers with the same digits, you know that the decimal point
is being tested. If the choices are .05, 0.5, 5, 50, and 500, double-check that your decimal
point is in the right place.
Operations signs
Double-check all operations signs (+, –, ÷, and ×) when you move from one side of the equal
sign to the other side.
Political correctness
The grammar and reading portions of the ACT contain very few correct, negative-sounding
answers. If a passage talks about people, especially those in a minority group, it never says
nasty things about them. The entire ACT is sweetness and light; if your answer is petty and
mean-spirited, it is probably wrong.
-ing and other beware! words
Always double-check the words that give you trouble: lie or lay and affect or effect, for exam-
ple (see Chapter 4). Pay close attention to the -ing words as well.
Context
When you’re taking the English and Reading tests, read a few sentences before and after the
sentence you’re working on. You won’t get tripped up by an answer choice that seems cor-
rect in the sentence but isn’t because of text that precedes or follows the sentence.
Grammar
To double-check your work, insert your answer into the sentence and read it again. Does
your answer still make sense?
Completed answer grid
If you’ve read through this book, you’ve seen the following information a gazillion times, but
it bears repeating: Wrong answers on the ACT are not penalized. You lose no points for a mis-
take. Therefore, it behooves you to answer every question, even if you have to make wild
guesses to do so. When you see that you have only a minute or two left, fill in an answer for
every question left in the test. You may pick up several points for lucky guesses.

Chapter 2: Succeeding on the ACT

Ten Dumb Things You Can 
Do to Mess Up Your ACT
Throughout this book, you discover techniques for doing your best on the ACT. We’re sorry
to say, however, that there are just as many techniques for messing up big-time on this test.
Take a few minutes to read through them now to see what dumb things people do to blow
the exam totally. By being aware of these catastrophes, you may prevent them from happen-
ing to you.
And no — no booby prize is awarded to the student who makes the greatest number of these
mistakes.
Losing concentration
When you’re in the middle of an excruciatingly boring reading passage, the worst thing you
can do is to let your mind drift off to a more pleasant time (last night’s date, last weekend’s
soccer game, the time that you stole your rival school’s mascot and set it on the john in the
principal’s private bathroom). Although visualization (picturing yourself doing something
relaxing or fun) is a good stress-reduction technique, it stinks when it comes to helping your
ACT score. Even if you have to pinch yourself to keep from falling asleep or flaking out, stay
focused. The ACT is less than five hours of your life. You’ve probably had horrible blind dates
that lasted longer than that, and you managed to survive them. This, too, shall pass.
Panicking over time
Every section on the ACT begins with directions and a line that tells exactly how many
questions are in the section and, therefore, how many minutes you have per question. It
isn’t as if this is some big mystery. You can waste a lot of time and drive yourself crazy if
you keep flipping pages ahead, counting up how many more questions you have to do. You
can do what you can do; that’s all. Looking ahead and panicking only wastes time and is
counterproductive.
Messing up numbering on the answer grid
Suppose that you decide to postpone doing question number 11, hoping that inspiration will
strike. But now you accidentally put the answer to question 12 in the blank for question 11 . . .
and mess up all the numbers from that point on. After you answer question 30 and suddenly
realize that you just filled in bubble number 29 and have one bubble left — aaargh! Stroke
City! It’s easy for me to say, “Don’t panic,” but chances are that your blood pressure will go
sky-high, especially when you eyeball the clock and see that only one minute remains.
If you have a good eraser with you (which is one of the things I suggested in Chapter 1 that
you bring with you), the wrong answers on the answer grid should take only a few seconds
to erase. But how on earth are you going to resolve all those problems and reread and rean-
swer all the questions? You’re not; you’re going to thank your lucky stars that you bought
this book and took the following advice: When you choose an answer, circle that answer in
your test booklet first and then fill in the answer on the answer grid. Doing so takes you a
mere nanosecond and helps you not only in this panic situation, but also as you go back and
double-check your work.
18
Part I: Coming to Terms with Reality: An Overview of the ACT 

Throughout this book, we remind you that random guesses can’t hurt you on the ACT
because there is no penalty for wrong answers. Never leave a bubble blank. Make a random
guess. Fill in the bubble; then put an arrow in the margin of the test booklet (not on the
answer grid) to remind yourself to review that question. Because you have all the bubbles
filled in, you won’t make a numbering error like we described earlier in this section.
Rubbernecking
Rubbernecking is craning your neck around to see how everyone else is doing. Forget those
bozos. You have too much to do on your own to waste precious seconds checking out anyone
else. You don’t want to psych yourself out by noticing that the guy in front of you is done
with his section and is leaning back whistling while you’re still sweating away. Maybe the guy
in front of you is a complete moron and didn’t notice that the booklet has yet another page of
problems — so he did only half the section. After the exam booklet is put in front of you,
don’t look at anything but it and your watch until time is called.
Try not to sit by the clock in the classroom. Because everyone looks at the clock constantly,
you may become self-conscious, thinking that you’re being checked out. People staring at you
every few seconds can be quite distracting. You need to keep your mind entirely on what
you’re doing, instead of continually looking up and catching someone’s eye.
Cheating
Dumb, dumb, dumb! Cheating on the ACT is a loser’s game — it’s just plain stupid. Apart from
the legal, moral, and ethical questions, let’s talk practicality: You can’t predict what types of
grammatical mistakes will show up in the questions; what are you going to do, copy a text-
book on the palm of your hand? All the math formulas that you need can’t fit onto the bottom
of your shoe. Copying everything that you think you may need would take more time than
just learning it. Besides, the ACT tests critical reasoning skills, not just rote memorization.
The test never asks a question as straightforward as, “How many degrees in a triangle?” The
questions require thinking and reasoning, not just copying down a formula. Short of having a
brain transplant, cheating is impractical.
Worrying about previous sections
Think of the ACT as five separate lifetimes. You are reborn four times and so get four more
chances to “do it right.” Every time the proctor says, “Your time is up. Please turn to the next
test and begin,” you get a fresh start. The ACT rules are very strict: You cannot go back to a
previous section and finish work there or change some of your answers. If you try to do so,
the proctor will catch you, and you’ll be in a world of hurt. But suppose that you’re too ethi-
cal even to consider going back to earlier material. There’s still the problem of worrying
about the previous test. If you’re now working on math, you shouldn’t be wracking your brain
trying desperately to remember what that frustrating, it’s-on-the-tip-of-my-tongue grammar
rule was. Forget one test as soon as you enter the next. Think of it as you would think of a
new boyfriend or girlfriend in your life: out with the old, in with the new.
Worrying about the hard problems
The ACT contains some incredibly hard problems and questions. Forget about ’em. Almost
no one gets them right, anyway. A ridiculously few total 36’s are scored every year, and if you
19
Chapter 2: Succeeding on the ACT

get into the 30s, you’re in a superelite club of only a few percent of the thousands and thou-
sands of students who take the ACT annually. Just accept the fact that you either won’t get to
or can’t answer a few of the hard questions and learn to live with your imperfection. If you do
go fast enough to get to the hard questions, don’t waste too much time on them. Scan them;
if you can’t think of how to begin, choose an answer at random. Then go back and double-
check your easy questions. Keep reminding yourself that every question counts the same in
a section, whether that question is a simple 1 + 1 = 2 or some deadly word problem that may
as well be written in Lithuanian.
Transferring information from problem 
to problem or section to section
Each question exists in its own little world. If x = 17 in question number 15, it does not neces-
sarily equal that in question number 16 (unless a note says something like, “Questions 15 and
16 refer to the following information”). Now that sounds incredibly simplistic, but it’s surpris-
ing how many people transfer information from problem to problem. This practice is espe-
cially prevalent in dealing with symbolism questions. If you learn in a symbolism question that 
= 25, it is highly unlikely that it will be equal to 25 in another triangle problem.
Forgetting to double-check
If you finish a test early, go back and double-check the easy and medium questions. Don’t
spend more time trying to do the hard questions. If a question was too hard for you five min-
utes ago, it’s probably still too hard for you. Your brain capacity probably hasn’t doubled in
the last few minutes. If you made a totally careless or dumb mistake on an easy question,
however, going back over the problem gives you a chance to catch and correct your error.
You’re more likely to gain points by double-checking easy questions than by staring open-
mouthed at the hard ones. Remember: Every question counts the same. A point you save by
catching a careless mistake is just as valuable as a point you earn, grunting and sweating, by
solving a mondo-hard problem.
Looking back and doing “coulda-shoulda”
Don’t discuss the questions with your friends in the bathroom during break. They don’t
really know any more than you do. Your friends may all tell you that they got answer A for
question five — but maybe answer A was the trap answer and they all fell for it. If you get
depressed because you chose answer B, you’re only hurting yourself. Maybe B was right all
along, and you alone brilliantly recognized and circumnavigated the trap. Why put yourself
through this grief? The same is true after the exam. Forget the postmortem. You did what you
did; no sense fretting about it until you get your scores back.

Reading the Admissions Committee’s
Mind: What Colleges Want
In This Chapter
 Pinpointing what the colleges really want from you
 Masterminding the right mix of academics, sports, and extracurricular activities
 Preparing for the all-important essay and interview
 Eliminating the biggest mistake most anxious applicants make
T
he number one question that we’re asked by our students is, “What do colleges want
outta me?” We took that question to an expert, Jill Q. Porter, M.S., of La Jolla, California.
An independent college counselor, Jill has helped thousands of students get into the schools
that best meet their needs and fulfill their dreams. She visits dozens of colleges every year,
talks with the admissions officers, and knows what’s important to them. She’s great at
debunking some of the rumors that make the rounds. Here are her answers to 11 of the
most important questions a student recently posed in an interview.
What’s the Number One Thing 
That Colleges Look For?
“Grades and the level of coursework. If you get straight A’s but you take basket weaving and
lint picking, schools aren’t going to be impressed. If you take five solids, like physics, calcu-
lus, Spanish, history, and English lit, and get a few A’s and a few B’s, schools are going to be
very impressed. It isn’t just the grades but the difficulty level of the classes that’s important.”
How Important Is the ACT, Really?
“The ACT is crucial. Do you think the colleges would spend so much time and money sepa-
rating students by their ACT scores if the schools didn’t consider the scores important? The
colleges need to have some universal measure of skills, something that can put all students
on an equal footing. Some kids don’t have the chance to take calculus in their high schools,
or they go to schools that just plain don’t offer AP (Advanced Placement) classes. By having
everyone take the same test, schools have a fairer and more equitable frame of reference.”

Do Schools Care Whether I Repeat the ACT?
“The answer to this question depends on the college. The very top-tier colleges don’t expect
you to take the ACT six or seven times and may be dubious if you do so. Twice is enough 
for the top schools. Second-rung schools don’t mind if you take the ACT three or four times.
Check directly with the individual school to find out its policy.”
Can I Take the ACT Instead of the SAT I?
“Many schools in the Midwest accept ACT scores in lieu of SAT I scores. Other schools let
you take both exams and evaluate both scores. My suggestion is that you plan to take both
exams. You want to keep your options open. What if you suddenly decide you want to go to a
different college, one you hadn’t considered before? By the time you realize you need an SAT
score, it may be too late to take the test. Automatically plan on taking both tests, if possible.”
It just so happens that your friendly neighborhood bookstore has copies of The SAT I For
Dummies (Wiley) to help you prepare for that exam. Could life get any better?
If I Mess Up Big-Time on the ACT, 
What Can I Do to Compensate?
“Adjust your expectations. Reality is the name of the game when it comes to college planning.
Although we’d all love to go to Status U., most of us have to settle for less. If you do very
badly on the ACT and don’t have time to take it again, there’s nothing you can do but look at
another school. You always have the option of transferring after your first or second year.
“Keep in mind that schools do get last-minute openings. Even if you think your ACT score
absolutely disqualifies you from your Dream School, send in the application and try to get on
a wait list. You never know how lucky you can get.”
What Classes Do You Recommend That I 
Take as a Senior? Junior? Sophomore?
“In general, the more challenging and complete your course load, the more likely you are to
get accepted by a good college. And let me warn you: You can’t slack off your senior year.
Many students tell me that they work superhard their junior year and then take easy classes
their senior year because it’s too late for the colleges to get those grades. Wrong. Some
schools don’t send out confirmation notices until the end of March of the senior year. That
means they get the first-semester grades and know whether you’ve signed up for and then
dropped classes your senior year. Remember, the application form is a legal contract. If you
write that you’re taking a bunch of hard classes, which you actually stayed in for a day and
dropped, you’re lying to the college, and that’s called fraud.
22
Part I: Coming to Terms with Reality: An Overview of the ACT 

“Enough of scaring you. Here’s what most colleges are looking for: three years of math (four
is even better); four years of English; two to three years of language (any language is fine; you
won’t get extra points for taking a ‘classy’ language like Latin); two to three years of science;
and two years of social studies. As far as the math goes, you don’t have to take calculus
unless you’re trying to get into a math, engineering, or architecture program. And physics
isn’t required by all colleges, either.”
How Helpful Are Charity Work and Sports?
“Colleges expect you to have some sort of community involvement. The key is doing some-
thing you enjoy. Don’t sign up to work at a preschool if you don’t have patience with small
children, for example. The newspaper is always full of organizations requesting volunteers;
somewhere, there’s a perfect match for you. In my opinion, it’s more important to be very
involved with one charity than to sign up for ten different charities just to have them on your
application form. The schools aren’t dumb; they’ll know what you’re doing.
“As for sports, they show you’re well rounded. You don’t have to play varsity sports, just be
involved in something, even intramurals. A word of caution: Sports are not more important
than grades. Don’t let your athletics stand in the way of your academics.”
What Should I Say on the College Essay?
“I stress individuality. Show the colleges who you really are. College admissions officers read
hundreds, maybe even thousands, of essays every year. They don’t award points when you
say what you obviously think the college wants to hear. They’re impressed when you let your
personality shine through. If you’re archconservative and take pride in campaigning for right-
wing candidates, mention your experiences. If you are really into pyramid power, channeling,
and New Age stuff, talk about that. The key is to write about something you enjoy.
“And it goes without saying that your writing should be well organized and grammatically
correct. With spell-checkers (both mechanical and that type called ‘parents’), there’s no
excuse for turning in a sloppy essay.”
What Will They Ask Me in the Interview, 
and What Should I Say?
“Colleges have two basic types of interviews, those done by alumni and those done by col-
lege staff. The alumni interviews tend to be a little less formal, but that doesn’t mean you
don’t have to take them seriously.
“In both types of interviews, the most important thing is to show you are seriously interested
in this school. Demonstrate that you’ve done your homework. By that, I don’t mean bring in
your algebra scratch paper, but indicate that you’ve done your background reading on the
college. Mention some programs you find impressive or something about the history of the
school. Above all, be very careful not to annoy the interviewer by asking some trite question
that’s already been answered in the promotional literature. For example, asking ‘How many
students are on campus?’ is lame when that number is given in the school bulletin. Ask ques-
tions that relate to your personal goals in college.”
23
Chapter 3: Reading the Admissions Committee’s Mind: What Colleges Want

How Can I Decide Which School Is Best for Me?
“This is the big question. First, be realistic. Everyone wants to go to the best schools in the
country, but we can’t all get accepted there. Although you should have one Dream School
just for fun, be prepared by having several more realistic schools as backups.
“Next, look at affordability. Be absolutely sure that you can afford a school before you go
through all the visitations and applications (which cost money). You may think you’ll get a
scholarship and financial aid, but they are getting harder and harder to acquire and rarely
cover all the costs. Figure out just exactly how much you have to contribute, and then have 
a realistic talk with your parents about how much they can help. Yes, you can get a job
during school, but that money usually goes toward daily expenses and fun, not tuition and
books. You may be able to work only part-time, remember.
“Of course, the physical comfort of a school is vital. By that I mean, would you enjoy living in
that particular city and on the campus? If you’re a big-city sophisticate, you may not want to
live in a small college town in the Midwest that has few of the extras you grew up with. If you
are a laid-back, small-town type, life in the big city may be so distracting that you don’t con-
centrate on your studies. And you have to like the campus, too, because you’ll probably live
on it for at least a few years.
“And last, I always recommend thinking about long-range internships and job opportunities.
If you want to be a schoolteacher, for example, does the college have a good student-teaching
program? Are there jobs in the community for teachers after you graduate? Many students
fall in love with the city in which a school is located and want to stay there after they gradu-
ate. You’re only in high school now and may not be thinking as far ahead as graduation and
job hunting, but they should be a vital part of your decision on colleges.”
What’s the Biggest Mistake Most Students
Make in College Planning?
“Relying on misinformation. The school grapevine and rumor mill are always working. I have
students come to me who are convinced that they can have a mediocre ACT score and still
get into their Dream School ‘because a friend of a friend at school, this guy who plays water
polo, did it.’ Check your facts. You may want to believe what you hear, but trust me, much of
it will be wrong. Read the school bulletin. Talk to the admissions office or to an alumnus of
the school. Talk to your high school guidance counselor or get help from an independent
counselor.
“The second biggest mistake is choosing a college based solely on how much money it will
give you in scholarships or financial aid. Although money is critical, it need not be your only
reason for attending a school. Somewhere out there, you can find a school you love, one that
fits you to a T. You don’t have to settle for the first school that offers you money, thinking
that you won’t find anything better. Your college experience is something you’ll remember
forever. It will affect your friendships, your career, and the rest of your life. Don’t just settle
for ‘good enough’; look for ‘just right.’”

Serving Your “Sentence”:
English Review and Test

In this part . . .
L
urking in the dark alleyways of the ACT is your first
opponent, the English Test, one of four separate tests
that you have to battle. The information in this part can
help you to win the fight (or at least lessen the slaughter!).
Remember those persnickety grammar rules you thought
you’d left behind forever? Surprise! They’re baaaaaack.
This part refreshes your memory of those rules with a
grammar review — one that uses enough stupid examples
and silly jokes to keep you from dozing off. Following the
grammar review is a chapter that tells you what the exam
actually looks like, which questions are worth doing, and
which questions you may as well just guess at wildly.
Finally, the last chapter in this part is an abbreviated
English test: a dozen questions to make sure that what
you’ve learned and reviewed is forever imprinted in your
brain. Life just couldn’t get any better.

Glamour Grammar: The 
Five-Star Review
In This Chapter
 Distinguishing commonly confused twosomes

 Learning to “agree with” verbs and pronouns
T
he English Test portion of the ACT tests standard, written English. What’s that? That’s
what I call Arrogant English — stuck-up, highfalutin English. In the real world, you can
use slang and casual English and communicate perfectly well with your buddies, but on the
ACT, you have to use the formal English that you were taught in school. When you knock on
a friend’s door, for example, you call out, “It’s me!” Right? On the ACT, you have to choose,
“It is I.”
About half of the ACT English Test questions test rhetorical skills — your general writing style
and organization. That’s the stuff you use every time you pick up a pen or turn on your word-
processing program. The other half of the questions test what most people lump together in
the general category they call English: punctuation, sentence structure, and basic grammar,
including diction errors, subject-verb agreement, modifiers (adjectives and adverbs), and so
on. That’s the stuff you probably forget (or intentionally purge from your brain) ten minutes
after being tested on it.
This chapter gives you a basic grammar review that brings back those thrilling days of yes-
teryear when you knew how to use the subjunctive and actually cared about the differences
between adjectives and adverbs. The review starts off with the really easy stuff, but please
don’t get too bored and drop out. The harder, picky stuff comes later, and chances are that’s
the stuff you really need. Besides, to reward you for hanging in there and suffering through
this quagmire, I’ve put in quite a few trivia points and a couple of jokes as bonuses.
You do not — I repeat, do not — have to fear encountering something like the pluperfect. I am
very careful not to use technical terms throughout this material. Only teachers care about
the technical names for this stuff. All you need to know is how to use the right rules, not what
to call things.
Subject-Verb Agreement
1. A singular subject takes a singular verb.
Mozart’s music is (not are) beautiful.

2. A plural subject takes a plural verb.
The works of Mozart and Brahms are (not is) beautiful.
(By the way, do you know what Mozart and Brahms are doing these days? Decomposing!)
3. A compound subject — two or more subjects often connected by the word and — takes a
plural verb.
A symphony and a fugue are (not is) beautiful.
4. The following words are always plural and therefore require plural verbs:
 few: Few people take (not takes) only the ACT and not the SAT.
 both: Both the ACT and the SAT are (not is) entrance exams to college.
 several: Several of my friends have (not has) taken the ACT and the SAT.
 many: Many of my friends wish (not wishes) they had never heard of the ACT.
5. The following words are always singular and require singular verbs:
 each: Each question on the ACT has (not have) the potential to be a trick question.
 every: Every question is (not are) to be approached with trepidation and paranoia.
The every words — everyone, everybody, everything, everywhere — are always singular.
6. The following words may be singular or plural, depending on what follows them: some,
any, most, all, and none.
 some, plural: Some of the jokes in this book are (not is) beyond hope and should be
given a decent burial.
 some, singular: Some of the humor in this book is (not are) inexcusable.
You can remember these words with the acronym S.A.M.A.N., the first letters of the words.
Think of the sentence, “S.A.M.A.N. (Say, man), can you tell me which words are sometimes
singular and sometimes plural?”
7. The following collective nouns look plural but are singular and require a singular verb:
group, public, club, government, union, organization, and collection.
The public is (not are) constantly exposed to my sense of humor. My 
collection of jokes is (not are) not always fully appreciated.
8. A prepositional phrase does not affect subject-verb agreement.
When you see a prepositional phrase, draw a line through it and simply read the noun (sub-
ject) next to the verb.
That irate group of test-takers is (not are) bombarding the proctor with 
tomatoes.
(Did you remember from Rule #7 that group is singular even though it may look plural?)
Five words are exceptions to Rule #8: Do not ignore prepositional phrases containing the
S.A.M.A.N. words.
All of the dancers are (not is) wearing new leotards today; all of their 
time is (not are) spent complaining about the price of workout clothes.
Trivia: Do you know who invented the leotard? It was created by and obviously named after
Jules Leotard, a French trapeze artist.

9. Some nouns have irregular singular and plural forms.
Singular
Plural
criterion

curriculum

bacterium

phenomenon

medium

datum
data
Television is my favorite news medium; I get my news from several media.
(I love the quote from humorist Fred Allen: “TV is called a medium because it is so rarely well
done!”)
When in doubt about whether a word is singular or plural, remember that, in general (but not
always), the plural form of the word ends in a vowel (data, criteria) while the singular form of
the word ends in a consonant (datum, criterion).
10. The second subject in an either/or or neither/nor construction determines whether the
verb is singular or plural.
Neither Kimberly nor her parents are (not is) on the cruise.
Neither her parents nor Kimberly is (not are) able to afford cruise 
tickets.
(Did you hear what happened when the pink cruise ship rammed into the purple one? All the
passengers were marooned.)
Many people are so concerned with the subject-verb agreement of neither/nor that they
forget that neither and nor belong together and that either and or belong together. In other
words, the constructions neither/or and either/nor are wrong. Double-check whenever you
see these words.
Pronouns
The next time your grammar teacher asks you to name two pronouns, you can be a smart
aleck and shout out, “Who, me?”
1. A pronoun (a word that takes the place of the noun) must have the same number (singu-
lar or plural) as the noun or noun phrase it is replacing.
Everybody is on his (not their) best behavior during a college interview.
You would probably be wealthy if you had a dollar for each time you’ve heard someone say,
“Yeah, everybody is trying their best.” Because the construction everybody . . . their is so
commonly used, it sounds correct. Red-flag this expression. Whenever you see the word
everybody, triple-check the pronoun to make sure that it is singular.
29
Chapter 4: Glamour Grammar: The Five-Star Review

2. A pronoun must have the same gender (feminine, masculine, or neuter) as the noun it is
replacing.
The ewe is slowly making her way home from the pasture.
Because a ewe is a female sheep, use the female pronoun her.
3. A pronoun must have clarity (that is, you must be able to tell which noun the pronoun is
replacing).
Matthew asked Franklin to pick up his laundry off the floor.
Did Matthew want Matthew’s laundry picked up, or did Matthew want Franklin’s laundry
picked up? This reference is unclear — and thus makes the sentence a poor one.
An unclear pronoun reference often requires major reconstructive surgery. In this example,
the entire sentence must be rewritten. Here’s one possibility:
Matthew, disgusted at seeing Franklin’s laundry on the floor, picked 
it up.
(Now you know perfectly well that the pronoun it is referring to Franklin’s heap of clothes,
not Matthew’s.)
4. A pronoun must be in the proper case: subjective (I, you, he, she, it, we, they), objective
(me, you, him, her, it, us, them), or possessive (my, mine, your, yours, his, her, hers, its,
our, ours, their, theirs).
A pronoun following any form of the verb to be, such as is, are, was, and were, is going to be
in the subjective form. This form often sounds pretentious and bizarre (a sure clue that it’s
probably correct on the ACT!). Following are common constructions:
It is I.
It was she who . . . 
It was he.
This is he.
It could be they.
It was they.
I finally confessed to my family that it was I who put the dent in the 
bumper of the car.
Adjectives and Adverbs
1. Place an adjective (which modifies a noun or pronoun) or an adverb (which modifies a
verb, adjective, or adverb) as close as possible to the noun or pronoun it is modifying.
That rule isn’t followed in this sentence:
WRONG: Nancy and Frank left the neighborhood they had lived in for ten 
years reluctantly.
This sentence sounds as if Nancy and Frank had been reluctant to live in the neighborhood,
when in fact they were reluctant to leave. Change the sentence so that reluctantly comes just
before left:
RIGHT: Nancy and Frank reluctantly left the neighborhood they had lived 
in for ten years.
30
Part II: Serving Your “Sentence”: English Review and Test 

2. An adverb (which modifies a verb, adverb, or adjective) often answers the question
“How?” and may end in -ly.
How do I study? I study reluctantly.
3. Place not only and but also in parallel positions within a sentence. People often place not
only and but also incorrectly. Following is an example of a wrong way to use these expressions:
WRONG: Angelique not only was exasperated but also frightened when she 
locked herself out of the house.
See the problem? In this wrong example, the phrase not only comes before the verb was, but
the phrase but also comes before the adjective frightened.
RIGHT: Angelique was not only exasperated but also frightened when she 
locked herself out of the house.
Not only and but also precede the adjectives exasperated and frightened, respectively.
Sentence Structure
1. A run-on sentence (two or more independent clauses incorrectly joined) must be changed.
The following is a run-on:
WRONG: Jessimena was furious when she went to the party on the wrong day, 
she went home and yelled at her boyfriend, who had given her the wrong 
information.
You can choose from five ways to correct a run-on:
 Make two separate sentences.
Jessimena was furious when she went to the party on the wrong day. 
She went home and yelled at her boyfriend, who had given her the 
wrong information.
 Use a semicolon to separate independent clauses.
Jessimena was furious when she went to the party on the wrong day;
she went home and yelled at her boyfriend, who had given her the 
wrong information.
 Use a semicolon, conjunctive adverb, and comma (as in this construction: ; there-
fore,) to separate the clauses.
Jessimena was furious when she went to the party on the wrong day; 
therefore, she went home and yelled at her boyfriend, who had given 
her the wrong information.
 Use a subordinating conjunction (such as because) with one of the clauses.
Because Jessimena was furious when she went to the party on the wrong 
day, she went home and yelled at her boyfriend, who had given her the
wrong information.
 Use a comma and a coordinating conjunction (as in this construction: , and)
between the two clauses.
Jessimena was furious when she went to the party on the wrong day, 
and she went home and yelled at her boyfriend, who had given her the 
wrong information.
31
Chapter 4: Glamour Grammar: The Five-Star Review

2. A sentence fragment (an incomplete sentence) must be changed to reflect a completed
thought.
WRONG: Wendy, singing merrily to herself as she walked to class, unaware 
that the professor was at that very moment preparing a pop quiz.
RIGHT: Wendy, singing merrily to herself as she walked to class, was 
unaware that the professor was at that very moment preparing a pop quiz.
Parallelism
Parallelism (also called parallel structure) means that objects in a series must be in similar
form.
WRONG: I spent my weekend working on a jigsaw puzzle, doing chores around 
the house, and finally got out on Sunday evening to play a set of tennis.
Rewrite the sentence so that the verbs are in the same form:
RIGHT: On the weekend, I worked on a jigsaw puzzle, did chores around the 
house, and finally got out on Sunday evening to play a set of tennis.
or
RIGHT: I spent my weekend working on a jigsaw puzzle and doing chores 
around the house, finally getting out on Sunday evening to play a set of 
tennis.
Items in a series may be nouns, verbs, adjectives, or entire clauses. However, nonparallel
verbs are the items that most commonly have errors. When a clause contains more than one
verb, watch out for this particular error.
Comparisons
1. Use the -er form (called the comparative form) to compare exactly two items; use the -est
form (called the superlative form) to compare more than two items.
I am taller than my brother Beau, but Darren is the tallest member of our 
family.
A particularly difficult comparison uses the words latter and last.
My boyfriend asked whether I would like to go to Chicago, where the 
temperature was –5 degrees, or to Los Angeles, where the temperature was 
80 degrees. I told him that I preferred the latter (not last).
Trivia: Did you know that the name Chicago is derived from a Native American term that
means “place that stinks of onions”?
Comparisons may trap you when you refer to twins. Remember that twins indicates two
people. The following is a good trick question:
WRONG: Myron and Mayor Thibadeau are identical twins, but Myron is the 
oldest by five minutes, a fact that he never lets Mayor forget.
32
Part II: Serving Your “Sentence”: English Review and Test 

The error is in the comparison because there are only two twins.
RIGHT: Myron is the older by five minutes.
2. Compare only similar objects or concepts.
WRONG: The motor skills of a toddler are more advanced than a baby.
The problem with the preceding sentence is that it is comparing motor skills to a baby. Its
intention is to compare a toddler’s motor skills to a baby’s motor skills. Following are two
ways to correct the error:
RIGHT: The motor skills of a toddler are more advanced than those of a 
baby.
or
RIGHT: A toddler’s motor skills are more advanced than a baby’s.
Diction
I like to refer to diction errors as twosomes because they are errors that you make when you
swap two (or sometimes three) commonly confused words. This section lists the most com-
monly confused words, along with short-and-sweet definitions and examples.
affect/effect
To affect is to influence or concern.
A good ACT score will positively affect your chances of admission to 
college.
(It will positively influence your chances.)
Effect means cause or result.
A good ACT score will have a positive effect on your chances for 
admission (a positive result).
A good score will effect a change in which schools you consider (cause a 
change).
Affect has another, little-known meaning. To affect also means to pretend.
When I want to get out of meeting with my friends to study for the ACT, 
I often affect a headache (pretend to have a headache).
amount/number
Amount modifies a singular noun.
I have a large amount of respect for the poetry of Dorothy Parker.
33
Chapter 4: Glamour Grammar: The Five-Star Review

Number modifies a plural noun.
A number of times I have read her poem that contains the lines, “The lads 
I’ve met in Cupid’s deadlock / were, shall we say, born out of wedlock?”
anxious/eager
Anxious means worried or doubtful.
Meg was anxious about the call from her mechanic, knowing that her Tercel 
probably needed some repairs.
Eager means joyously anticipating.
The mechanic was eager to work on Meg’s car, because he needed cash.
Tercel Trivia: They don’t just make up these names for cars, you know. A tercel is a small
male hawk. Maybe the carmakers wanted to give drivers the idea of being free-flying and
soaring like a hawk.
assure/ensure
To assure means to convince.
Quentin talked fast, trying to assure his girlfriend that the heart-shaped 
necklace in his locker was, in fact, a belated birthday present for her.
To ensure is to make certain.
To ensure that his girlfriend believed him, Quentin called a friend, who 
pretended she was the salesgirl who had sold the item to Quentin.
between/among
Between (note the tw) compares exactly two things.
I have difficulty choosing between cherry Jell-O and chocolate pudding.
Among compares more than two.
I go crazy when I have to choose among the desserts in a smorgasbord.
Trivia: Can you name five Jell-O flavors that flopped? Apple, celery, salad, cola, and (ugh!)
mixed vegetables.
The word between is often followed by and: I have difficulty choosing between this and that.
A trap answer may have a sentence asking you to choose between this or that; the or is
wrong.
34
Part II: Serving Your “Sentence”: English Review and Test 

complement/compliment
Complement means to complete.
The buzz haircut complemented the image that Chan wanted to project as a 
no-nonsense guy.
Compliment means to praise.
Chan’s girlfriend was eager to compliment him on his new look.
eminent/immanent/imminent
Eminent means outstanding, distinguished.
Dr. Regis Weiss is an eminent oncologist, well respected by his peers.
Immanent means inherent, innate.
I think that compassion probably is an immanent trait in a good physician; 
it doesn’t seem possible that someone could take a course to learn how to 
be caring.
Imminent means about to happen.
When I saw Dr. Weiss shaking his head at me as I stood on the scale, I 
knew a lecture about weight management was imminent.
Think of imminent as “in-a-minute.” Something imminent is about to happen in a minute.
everyday/every day
As one word, everyday means usual or customary.
I wore my everyday clothes for a quick trip to the grocery store, little 
realizing that I’d run into Brad Pitt next to the kumquats.
Every day as two words means each 24-hour period.
From now on, I’m going to go to the store every day to get fresh fruit.
(After all, everyone needs fruit, kumquat may . . . .)
farther/further
Farther refers to measurable distance.
I made a mistake on the test when I said that Morocco is farther from 
Egypt than it is from New York.
35
Chapter 4: Glamour Grammar: The Five-Star Review

Further refers to a figurative degree or quantity that can’t be measured.
Obviously, I need to study my geography further.
flaunt/flout
Flaunt means to show off.
Brittany was thrilled to get her engagement ring and couldn’t wait to 
flaunt it to her friends at school.
Flout means to show scorn or contempt.
Her fiancé was furious that Brittany had flouted their agreement to keep 
their engagement a secret for the next few months.
founder/flounder
To founder is to sink, fail, or collapse.
Reports estimate that one of every two new businesses founders within the 
first three years.
To flounder is to thrash about.
A new business owner, desperate for advice, will flounder wildly, running 
from government bureau to government bureau attempting to get help.
good/well
Good is an adjective that modifies a noun.
You’re doing a good job learning these rules.
Well is an adverb that modifies verbs, adverbs, and adjectives and usually answers the ques-
tion how.
How do you study? You study very well.
Well also refers to physical condition.
By the time you leave the ACT, huffing, puffing, sweating, and fretting, 
you may not be feeling very well.
if/whether
If introduces a condition.
If the teacher allows an open-book exam, I will be ecstatic.
Whether compares alternatives.
I don’t know whether I could pass a normal, closed-book exam.
36
Part II: Serving Your “Sentence”: English Review and Test 

If usually sounds correct even when it is wrong. Personally, even though I know better, I hear
myself saying, “I don’t know if I can make it tonight,” when I know I should say, “I don’t know
whether I can make it tonight.” Try whether first. If it sounds right, it probably is right.
imply/infer
To imply means to suggest indirectly.
I didn’t mean to imply that your dress is ugly when I asked you whether 
you bought it at an upholstery store.
To infer is to conclude or deduce, to read a meaning into something.
Based on the evidence, the officer inferred that the man was guilty.
it’s/its
It’s (notice the apostrophe) means it is.
It’s good to know the distinction between these two words.
Its (without an apostrophe) is possessive.
The ACT is ruthless in its insistence that it’s important to know the 
difference between these two words.
less/fewer
Less modifies a singular noun.
I have less patience with problems than I should have.
Fewer modifies a plural noun.
I would make fewer careless mistakes in math if only I had the patience 
to finish each problem completely.
lie/lay
To lie is to recline.
I lie down in the afternoon for a nap to reduce stress.
To lay is to place.
I lay a cold washcloth on my head every time I get a headache from 
studying for the ACT.
Do you often get lie and lay confused? I have an easy way to remember them. To lie is to
recline. Listen for the long i sound in lie and the long i sound in recline. When I lie down, I
recline. To lay is to place. Listen for the long a sound in lay and the long a sound in place.
Now I lay me down to sleep. Now I place me down to sleep.
37
Chapter 4: Glamour Grammar: The Five-Star Review

Few people know how to conjugate these words correctly. Memorize the following:
 Lie, lay, have lain: Today I lie down, yesterday I lay down, every day I have lain down.
 Lay, laid, have laid: Today I lay my keys on the table, yesterday I laid my keys on the
table, every day this week I have laid my keys on the table.
Notice how confusing the past tense of lie is because it is the same as the present tense of
lay. Do not use the past tense of lie as lied. The sentence “I lied down yesterday” is egre-
giously incorrect.
phase/faze
Phase means stage or time period.
College years are just one phase of your life.
Faze means to upset, bother, or disconcert.
Do not let the pressure of the ACT faze you.
Many students look at the word faze and immediately assume that it is misspelled. The ACT
contains no misspelled words. If you think that a word is misspelled, you are in error. (My
favorite is judgment. Most people misspell the word as judgement, but there is no judge in
judgment in American English.)
prescribe/proscribe
Do you know the distinction between the words prescribe and proscribe? To prescribe is to
recommend.
I prescribe that you learn these two words.
To proscribe is to outlaw or forbid.
I proscribe your believing that the ACT has typographical errors.
principle/principal
Principle means rule.
The principles of justice upon which our country is founded apply to all.
Principal means first in authority or importance.
The principal reason democracy works, in my opinion, is that it gives 
everyone an equal opportunity to succeed.
Principle means rule. Note that they both end in -le. If the word does not appear to mean rule,
it can’t be principle; choose principal. The English language has many uses of the word princi-
pal, including investment principal, the principal reason I telephoned you, and the principal
of a high school.

rise/raze/raise
Rise means to ascend.
It is time to rise when your mother yanks the covers off the bed.
Raze means to tear down.
When she threatens to raze the bedroom around your head, you know that 
she means business.
Raise means to lift. (It also has several other meanings.)
You wearily raise your body, ready to face another day.
stationary/stationery
Stationary means unmoving.
The little girl tried to remain stationary, hoping that the birds would 
come up to her and eat out of her hand.
Stationery is writing paper.
The little girl used her new stationery to write a letter telling her 
grandmother about the birds.
Stationary means something that stays. Note the letter a in stay and the letter a in stationary.
Stationery is something you write a letter on. Note the letter e in stationery and the letter e in
letter.
who/whom
Who is a subject and does the action.
Who wants to study on a weekend?
Whom is an object and receives the action.
I don’t know whom to ask for help in deciding my major.
Miscellaneous Mistakes
This section reveals some of the miscellaneous grammar mistakes that many people make
every day. In the real world, you can live with these mistakes; on the ACT, they’re deadly.
hardly
Hardly is negative and often shows up in a trap double-negative question. Do not say, 
“Ms. Hawker has hardly nothing to do this weekend after she finishes the ACT and is looking
39
Chapter 4: Glamour Grammar: The Five-Star Review

forward to vegging out in front of the TV.” The correct version is, “Ms. Hawker has hardly any-
thing to do this weekend after she finishes the ACT and is looking forward to vegging out in
front of the TV.”
hopefully
Use hopefully only where you can plug in the words full of hope.
Hearing the telephone ring, Alice looked up hopefully, thinking that 
Steve might be calling her to apologize for sending her flowers on his 
ex-girlfriend’s birthday.
Many people use the word hopefully incorrectly as a substitute for “I hope.” The sentence
“Hopefully, my ACT score will improve” is wrong. Your score won’t improve unless you learn
to say, “I hope that my ACT score will improve.”
if . . . would
Do not place if and would in the same clause. A common error is to say, “If I would have stud-
ied more, I would have done better.” The correct version is, “If I had studied more, I would
have done better,” or, “Had I studied more, I would have done better.”
in regards to . . . in regard to
The English language has no such expression as in regards to. Dump the s; the proper expres-
sion is in regard to.
We need to have a heart-to-heart talk in regard to your making this 
mistake.
where . . . that
Do not confuse where with that. Where refers only to physical location. Saying, “Did you hear
where Principal Denges ran off to Tahiti with his secretary?” is wrong. The correct structure
is, “Did you hear that Principal Denges ran off to Tahiti with his secretary?”

Mastering the English Test
In This Chapter
 Understanding the format of the passages with “phantom” questions
 Distinguishing the must-do easy questions from the brain-straining difficult ones
 Avoiding falling for the ACT traps . . . or creating your own
W
hen you open your ACT booklet, the first thing you see is the English Test. Your still-
half-asleep brain and bleary eyes encounter 5 passages and 75 questions. Somehow,
you’re to read all the passages and answer all the questions within 45 minutes. This test is def-
initely one part of the ACT on which you have to hustle.
Seeing Is Believing: The Format of the Test
The ACT English Test passages look like standard reading comprehension passages, the kind
you’ve seen on tests for years. The difference is that these passages have many underlined
portions. An underlined portion can be an entire sentence, a phrase, a word, or even just a
punctuation mark. (You may want to take a quick look right now at the practice test in
Chapter 6 to see what a passage looks like. I’ll wait.)
Okay, you’re back. Here are the details about what you get and what you’re expected to do
with it.
The passages
The five passages can cover a variety of topics. You may get a fun story that’s a personal
anecdote — someone talking about getting a car for his 16th birthday, for example. Or you
may encounter a somewhat formal scientific passage about the way items are carbon-dated.
Some passages may discuss history; some, philosophy; others, cultural differences among
nations. Some passages are fiction, such as excerpts from novels, old and new. One type of
passage is not necessarily more difficult than another. You don’t need to use specific reading
techniques for these passages (as you do with standard reading comprehension passages).
Just read and enjoy. (Yeah, right.)
Although these English passages are not reading comprehension passages per se, you do
need to pay at least a little bit of attention to content rather than just to the underlined por-
tions. Why bother? Because a few of the questions at the end of the passages are reading
comp–type questions, asking you about the purpose of the passage or what a possible con-
clusion might be. More about those in the “Being Boxed In: The Box Questions” section of
this chapter.

The questions
The English Test has no questions. Well, let me rephrase that before I get your hopes up too
high. You will not usually be faced with what you consider specific questions in the standard
interrogatory form. You will not see “Which of the following is an adjective?” or “The purpose
of the subjunctive is to do which of these?” Instead, the “question” is simply an underlined
portion of the exam. Your job is to determine whether that underlined portion is correct as is
or whether one of the alternate answer choices is preferable.
The answer choices
The answer choices are A, B, C, and D (for the odd-numbered questions) and F, G, H, and J 
(for the even-numbered questions). Choices A and F are always “NO CHANGE.” You select that
if the original is the best of the versions offered. Occasionally, choice D or J will say, “OMIT the
underlined portion.” Choose that answer when you want to dump the whole underlined por-
tion and forget that you ever saw it. (And no, you can’t do that with the entire test!)
The other choices are often variations on a theme. For example, if the underlined portion has
the word lay in it, the answer choices might be
F. NO CHANGE
G. lie
H. lain
J. lying
Being Boxed In: The Box Questions
Usually at the end of a passage — but sometimes, quite annoyingly, within the passage 
itself — you see a small box with a number in it, like this: 
. That box indicates what most
students think of as a reading comprehension–type question. Here are a few examples:
If the purpose of this essay was to convey the author’s opinion about the morality of the
death penalty, did the author accomplish the purpose?
A. Yes, because the reader understands the author’s philosophy of right and wrong.
B. Yes, because the author specifically refers to the church’s teachings on the subject.
C. No, because the passage never addresses fundamental religious issues.
D. No, because the author never discusses life imprisonment as an alternative to the
death penalty.
Notice that here you have to understand not only what the passage said but also whether it
went far enough. This “Did the author accomplish his purpose?” question is pretty common.
To answer it, you usually have to comprehend the passage as a whole pretty well.
Given the topic and the tone of the passage, was the author’s use of the pronoun “I” proper?
F. Yes, because the only examples he cited were from his own life.
G. Yes, because he was projecting his personal feelings onto the topic.
H. No, because a formal essay should not be written in the first-person singular.
J. No, because using “I” prevents the readers from becoming involved with the topic.
49
42
Part II: Serving Your “Sentence”: English Review and Test 

In this case, you’re expected to get a feel for the tone of the passage as a whole. I suggest
that, as soon as you read the question, you decide whether using “I” was appropriate —
before you even look at the answer choices. If you don’t have at least some idea in your brain
before you look at the answer choices, they all will look good. I often have students read them
and say, “Choice F is true. Well, wait a minute, I agree with choice G, too. And now that I think
of it, I could make a case for H. No, no, wait a minute: It’s definitely choice J. I think.” Don’t
get yourself so confused. Predict an answer of your own before you get bamboozled by the
test’s answers.
Here’s an example of the type of box question I like least: the structure or reorganization
question.
To make the passage a coherent whole, paragraph 4 should be placed
A. where it is now.
B. at the beginning of the passage.
C. after paragraph 2.
D. at the end of the passage.
Notice how much time this type of question takes up. In the passage, each paragraph is num-
bered. You have to go back and reread the entire passage, thinking about which order of
paragraphs would make the most sense. Most of the time, you have to read the passage
repeatedly, first with this order of paragraphs and then with that order. You really don’t have
the time to do so.
My suggestion is that you make a quick guess at this question and come back to it later if you
have the time. (Never leave any question blank: Remember, the ACT does not penalize you
for guessing.)
What Do They Want Outta Me? What 
the English Usage Questions Test
The questions fall into two basic categories. Just over half the questions cover topics of usage
or mechanics. These questions include sentence structure (whether a sentence is a fragment
or a run-on), grammar and usage (just about everything most people think of as English,
such as adverbs, adjectives, and so on), and punctuation (don’t worry; this isn’t superhard,
mostly just semicolons). Just under half the questions test rhetorical skills, organization
(reordering the sentences in the passage), style (which expression, slang or formal, is appro-
priate within the passage), and strategy (“This passage would be most appropriate in which
of the following types of books . . . ?”).
Some questions are much more doable than others. For example, most students would agree
that a simple grammar question asking about a pronoun reference or subject-verb agreement
is easier than an organization question expecting you to put the paragraphs of the entire pas-
sage in order. In the practice tests in this book (see Chapters 16 and 18), I emphasize these
more doable questions, giving a slightly greater percentage of them than you might find on
the real ACT. Why? Because I want you to be absolutely, positively able to get these ques-
tions correct in a heartbeat. They are the basics, the foundation of your test. If you can get
the easy and medium-difficulty questions right, you’ll already have a good score. Getting the
harder questions correct will be the icing on the cake.

Maximizing the Gain, Minimizing the Pain:
Questions Worth Looking For
The biggest complaint I hear from my students about the English Test is not that it’s too hard
but that it’s too long. Five passages, 75 questions, and only 45 minutes to finish is pretty
daunting. This section gives you a few strategies to help you to get the most bang for your
buck.
Looking for short, diction-type questions
A diction error is a wrong word choice. Obvious errors, such as lie/lay, phase/faze, and
affect/effect are not tested as frequently as they used to be, but when they show up, they are
easy questions to answer correctly. One diction error that does show up repeatedly is its/it’s.
Here’s an example:
Barney told the club that it’s policy of discriminating against redheads was probably illegal
and certainly unethical.
A. it’s policy of discrimination
B. it’s discrimination policy
C. its discriminating policy
D. its discrimination
The possessive pronoun its has no apostrophe (“The cat was licking its paw.”) It’s (with an
apostrophe) means it is. This example requires the possessive, its. Eliminate choices A and B.
Choice D more directly expresses the thought of the sentence than does choice C. Correct
Answer: D.
We put many questions like this one into the practice exams simply because they are the
most doable questions. You have no excuse for missing a diction question. All you have to do
is memorize the common diction twosomes (conveniently presented for your viewing pleas-
ure in Chapter 4).
Going for pure grammar
A grammar question may test subject-verb agreement, pronoun reference, or a multitude of
other concepts that you probably think of as English. Following is an example. (Keep in mind
that on the real test, this question is part of a passage, not an isolated sentence.)
A full case of sodas, when opened by a horde of thirsty athletes who have been running laps,
don’t go very far.
F. NO CHANGE
G. do not go
H. doesn’t go
J. doesn’t get to go
What’s the subject of the sentence? A case. That’s singular, requiring the singular verb 
doesn’t. Eliminate choices F and G immediately. Choice J is totally ridiculous, adding unnec-
essary words and making the sentence awkward. Correct Answer: H.
44
Part II: Serving Your “Sentence”: English Review and Test 

Did you see the trap in this sentence? Some students think that either sodas, athletes, or 
laps — all of which are plural — is the subject (especially laps, because it is right next to the
verb). In that case, they think that the verb has to be plural, too, and choose F. You didn’t fall
for that cheap trick, did you?
If English is not your first language, the diction and grammar questions are the key to your
getting a good score in this section. When you studied English, you probably memorized rule
after rule after rule, just the kinds of things that these questions test. In this situation, you
actually have an advantage over American kids who haven’t been tested on this stuff since
the seventh grade. (In many American high schools, students start learning literature in the
eighth or ninth grades and no longer focus on pure grammar.) Spend time studying the gram-
mar and diction rules in Chapter 4, and then head for these types of questions, especially if
you’re running short of time.
Ignoring superfluous info
Some sentences feature redundancies, such as “red in color” or “the reason was because.”
Others offer irrelevant or unnecessary information, as in the following example.
Taking a class in a foreign language can be very rewarding. You never know when you will
use the knowledge. You may someday visit a country that uses that language or meet some-
one from that nation. Even if you never actually practice the language, you can learn more
about the way languages are developed and words are created. Many students agree that
they learned more English grammar by studying a foreign language than they did in English
classes. You could also learn both Spanish and French at the same time, for example. Most
teachers of a foreign language emphasize sentence structure and grammar. It is an axiom
among language teachers that students who are good writers in their native languages learn
foreign languages quickly.
A. NO CHANGE
B. For example, you could also learn both Spanish and French at the same time.
C. At the same time, for example, you could learn both Spanish and French.
D. OMIT the underlined portion.
Choices A, B, and C are saying basically the same thing. All they do is shuffle the words a
little bit. None of them adds anything to the paragraph. The underlined sentence seems to go
off on a tangent, as you can see by the fact that the next sentence continues the previous
idea, the role of grammar in foreign language classes. Dump the whole underlined sentence.

Chapter 5: Misspellers of the World, Untie! Mastering the English Test
Which is better: The tortoise or the hare?
Question: Is it better to go slowly and do a good job on
four passages, never getting to the fifth, or should I try
to get through all five passages?
Answer: I advocate trying to get through all five pas-
sages. On average, each passage has 15 questions. I
don’t think you can afford to blow off that many ques-
tions. Keep reminding yourself of how different these
passages are from standard reading comprehension
passages. With very few exceptions, you don’t have to
answer “substance” questions, such as, “With which of
the following would the author agree?” If you’re short on
time, skip the box questions (which sometimes require a
lot of time, thought, and suffering) and the longer ques-
tions requiring you to rewrite an entire sentence, and
zoom on to the next passage.
Do not leave any answers blank. If you don’t get to that
last passage, at least fill in an answer for every question.
The ACT has no penalty for guessing. Out of 15 ques-
tions, you’re pretty sure to get at least a few right even
with random guessing, and every little bit helps.

Their Pain, Your Gain: Traps That 
Others Have Fallen Into
I’ve tutored for the ACT for a couple of decades now. By this point, I think I’ve seen students
fall for every trap the test-makers could think of — and some they probably never consid-
ered! Watch out for these most commonly tumbled-into traps:
 Forgetting the NO CHANGE option: Because the first answer choice (choice A for odd-
numbered questions, choice F for even-numbered questions) is always NO CHANGE,
students tend to gloss over it. Don’t forget that you always have the option to keep
things exactly the way they are.
 Automatically choosing “OMIT the underlined portion” each time it occurs: Although
you may be tempted to shorten this section by screaming, “Dump it! Just dump the
whole stupid thing!” every chance you get, don’t fall into that habit. When you see 
the OMIT answer (either choice D or choice J), realize that it has the same one-in-four
chance of being right as the other answers have. Consider it, but don’t make it a 
no-brainer choice.
 Automatically selecting the “other” diction or grammar choice: When a student sees
who in a sentence, she is often tempted to change it immediately to whom. Yet if that
same sentence said whom to begin with, that same student would immediately change
it to who. The temptation to do something, anything, is very strong. Don’t change just
for the sake of change.
 Wasting time on the box questions: Students sometimes ask me what I have against
the box questions. Nothing, really. Some of the box questions, like the attitude ones
(“Would this essay be appropriate for a group of university professors?”), can be quite
simple. But others can be incredibly time-wasting and frustrating. I refer specifically 
to my least-favorite type of question, the “order of the sentences” or “order of the para-
graphs” (“Which of the following would be the most logical sequence of sentences in
paragraph 4?”). Usually, you have to read and reread and reread the paragraph, chang-
ing and rearranging the sentences again and again. And even then, students argue that
the organization seems subjective: “Why does Sentence 4 go before Sentence 2? I think
it sounds better the other way!” You may be able to get the question right, but at what
price? How much time do you chew up? How many more of the easy questions could
you have gotten right in that time?
 Ignoring the big picture: Some questions are style questions. A style question expects
you to sense the overall picture, to know whether the tone of the passage is friendly so
that you can appropriately use a slang expression (for example, totally lame) or whether
you need to be a bit more formal (useless rather than totally lame). If you focus on only
the underlined portions and don’t read the passage as a whole, you can easily miss this
type of question.
Even if a question doesn’t seem to expect you to understand the entire passage, you should
still read a few sentences ahead of the question. How you correct a run-on or a fragment, for
example, may depend on how the next few sentences are structured.

In This Chapter
 Seeing the English questions in context
 Recognizing what doesn’t fit in
 Using — not abusing — the language
O
n  the real ACT, the passage is on the left side of the page, and the questions are on 
the right side (see the Chapters 16 and 18). For this one brief test, I put the questions
after the passage. That way, you can read the answer explanations with the questions.
DIRECTIONS: Below are five paragraphs containing underlined portions. Alternate ways of
stating the underlined portions follow the paragraphs. Choose the best alternative. If the
original is the best way of stating the underlined portion, choose NO CHANGE.
You also see questions that refer to the passage or ask you to reorder the sentences within a
passage. These questions are identified by a number in a box. Choose the best answer.
Passage
[1]
[1] Marian Anderson possibly will have the greatest influence opening doors and gaining well-deserved
opportunities for other Black singers than anyone else to date so far. [2] Anderson, born in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, had an early interest in music. [3] She learns to play the piano and was singing in the
church at the age of six. [4] She gave her first concert at age eight, when she was still a young child.
[2]
[5] In 1925, Anderson won a concert hosted by the New York Philharmonic, beating out no less than
300 singers. [6] It launched her career but, America was not quite ready for her fantastic voice, person-
ality, or color.
[3]
[7] In 1936, asked to give a performance at the White House. [8] She confessed that this occasion 
was the first time that she had really been nervous to sing. [9] She and Eleanor Roosevelt became 
close friends, but this friendship became evident with the Daughters of the American Revolution Affair.

[4]
[10] The DAR refused to let Anderson perform in Constitution Hall in 1939. [11] The White House
made arrangements for Ms. Anderson to sing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in D.C. instead.
[5]
[12] In 1977, First Lady Rosalynn Carter presented Marian Anderson with a Congressional Gold
Medal, the first Black to receive such an honor. [13] Later she was inducted into the Women’s Hall of
Fame in Seneca Falls, New York.
1. A. NO CHANGE
B. has had
C. has
D. is having
To understand the tense of the passage, you have to read a few sentences ahead. Doing so
makes it clear that Marian Anderson accomplished her singing several decades earlier. (The
passage mentions such dates as 1936 and 1977.) Therefore, the verb needs to be in the past
tense. Correct answer: B.
(Alas, not all of us sing as well as Ms. Anderson. My own singing is so bad that the governor
declared my last opera a disaster aria!)
2. F. NO CHANGE
G. a greater
H. one of the greatest
J. a great
You need to read the entire sentence before deciding on an answer. If you read “the greatest
influence” all by itself, it sounds correct. However, if you continue to read the sentence, you
find the comparative “than.” You cannot say “the greatest influence than” but rather “a
greater influence than.” Correct answer: G.
Be very careful to read the entire sentence. You may save a few seconds by reading only the
underlined portion, but you will sacrifice a lot of points.
3. A. NO CHANGE
B. dating so far
C. so far dated
D. OMIT the underlined portion
To date and so far are redundant; they mean the same thing. You can use one or the other,
but not both. (Quick! Notify the Department of Redundancy Department!) Correct answer: D.
Many students tend to choose “OMIT the underlined portion” every time they see it, reason-
ing that it would not be a choice unless it were correct. Not so. If you decide to omit the
underlined portion, be especially careful to reread the entire sentence. Often, omitting the
underlined portion makes nonsense out of the sentence.
48
Part II: Serving Your “Sentence”: English Review and Test

4. F. NO CHANGE
G. has been learning
H. learned
J. is learning
Because Marian Anderson is no longer six years old, the sentence requires the past tense,
learned. Hint: If you aren’t sure of the tense, check out the rest of the sentence. You are 
told that Ms. Anderson “was singing,” meaning the situation occurred in the past. Correct
answer: H.
Notice that choices G and J both have the -ing verb learning. Often, -ing verbs are trap
answers. They are frequently clumsy, awkward, and unnecessary. Although not all -ing verbs
are wrong, check them carefully.
5. A. NO CHANGE
B. still a young child
C. still young
D. OMIT the underlined portion
A person who is eight is still a young child — duh! The underlined portion is superfluous,
unnecessary. Eliminate it. The period is necessary to finish the sentence. Correct answer: D.
Speaking of children and sentences reminds me of a friend of mine. He got so tired of seeing
cutesy bumper stickers that said things like “My child was honor citizen of the month at
Sweetums Preschool” that he created his own bumper sticker. His back fender now reads,
“My child was Inmate of the Month at State Prison!”
6. F. NO CHANGE
G. less than
H. fewer than
J. no fewer than
Fewer modifies plural nouns, as in fewer brain cells, for example. Less modifies singular
nouns, like less intelligence. Because the noun singers is plural, use the word fewer. Correct
answer: J.
If you chose H, you fell for the trap. You forgot to reread the sentence with your answer
inserted. The meaning of the whole sentence changes with the phrase “fewer than 300
singers.” In that case, you are denigrating, or lessening, the winner’s accomplishment. The
tone of the passage is one of respect. The author is impressed that Ms. Anderson beat out
“no fewer than 300 singers.” Keep in mind that you must make your answers fit the overall
tone or attitude of the passage. If a passage is complimentary, be sure that your answers con-
tinue in that vein.
7. A. NO CHANGE
B. Launching her career,
C. Her career was launched, but
D. Upon launching it (her career),
49
Chapter 6: It’s Not What You Say, It’s How You Say It: English Practice Questions

Be very suspicious of that two-letter rascal it. Always double-check it out because it is so
often misused and abused. It must refer to one specific thing: “Where is the book? Here it is.”
In question 7, it doesn’t refer to any one object but to Ms. Anderson’s winning the contest.
Dump choice A. Choices B and D sound as if America launched Ms. Anderson’s career: “Upon
launching it . . . America was not quite ready . . . .” Be sure to go back and reread the entire
sentence with your answer inserted. Correct answer: C.
Beware of -ing words. They often result in a misplaced modifier, changing the meaning of the
sentence. Misplaced modifiers and bad grammar in general can result in some pretty funny
sentences. A few of every grammar teacher’s favorites, taken from newspaper headlines, are
Iraqi Head Seeks Arms
Two Convicts Escape Noose; Jury Hung
Police Discover Crack in Australia
8. F. NO CHANGE
G. she was asked
H. upon being asked
J. asking
The original is a fragment, an incomplete sentence. The sentence has no subject. Who was
asked? She was asked. Correct answer: G.
Choice H has the dreaded word being. People often use being incorrectly; you should make it
one of your red-flag words, words that you immediately double-check. Choices H and J both
have the same problem that the original has: They lack a subject.
9. A. NO CHANGE
B. about singing
C. of singing
D. and singing
The word nervous is usually followed by the word about. You are nervous about something,
not nervous to or by something. (How do you feel about the ACT? You may be frightened or
intimidated by it or scared of it, but if it makes you nervous, you are nervous about it.)
Correct answer: B.
This sentence is one of the few times when an -ing verb is correct, not a trap. Always double-
check -ing verbs, but don’t automatically assume that they are wrong. Watch out for an
exception, like this one. (I believe it was Yogi Berra who said, “You can observe a lot by
watching.”)
10. F. NO CHANGE
G. close friends, and
H. close friends — which
J. close and friendly,
The clause “but this friendship became evident . . .” makes no sense in the context. Use but
only to indicate dissent or change; use a comma and the word and to indicate a short pause.
Correct answer: G.
50
Part II: Serving Your “Sentence”: English Review and Test 

11. A. NO CHANGE
B. Medal, being the first Black
C. Medal; the first Black
D. Medal; she was the first Black
The original sounds as if the medal were the first Black to receive such an honor. The sen-
tence obviously means to say that Ms. Anderson was the first Black to receive the honor.
Note that the semicolon separates two independent sentences; each sentence could stand
alone. Correct answer: D.
Did the word being in choice B catch your eye? Being is a red-flag word, one that is frequently
misused. You should double-check it every time you see it.
12. If the author of this passage were to add the following lines to the article, where would they
be most logically placed?
It was an era of color prejudice, a time when people were still legally excluded from jobs,
housing, and even entertainment merely because of their race. Thus, the early promise of
success seemed impossible until something amazing for the times happened.
F. At the end of sentence 2
G. At the end of sentence 6
H. At the end of paragraph 3
J. In the middle of paragraph 5
Because the first sentence of the addition talks about color prejudice, look in the passage 
for something mentioning color. That is specifically discussed only in sentence 6. Correct
answer: G.
Be sure to go back to the passage and reread the entire paragraph with the new lines inserted
to make sure that they make sense.
This question just wastes time, requiring you to understand both the structure and the con-
tent of the passage. You have to go back and reread the passage four times, once with each
answer choice inserted in the indicated position. If you didn’t really understand the passage
or if you just skimmed it to get the grammar points, your best bet is to make a quick guess.
Remember: The ACT does not penalize you for wrong answers. Guessing at any question
that has you stumped is to your advantage.

In this part . . .
T
hat’s write — er — right! You do have a choice with 
the ACT writing test. The test is optional, so you can
choose between spending an extra 30 minutes getting
writer’s cramp, or risking having your future college or
university become rather disappointed in you — because
there’s a very real chance that they’ll require this section
of the ACT. It’s up to you, of course, but our advice is to
read the following chapters very carefully and opt to take
the writing test. When it comes to the writing test, better
safe than sorry!

Chapter 7
ACT Write: The First Words 
on Essay Writing
In This Chapter
 Learning the ten major writing errors to avoid in your writing
 Understanding the ACT scoring system
 Viewing sample essays
T
he writing portion of the ACT is optional, meaning you have the choice of spending an
extra 30 minutes at the testing center (How lucky for you!). Although it’s optional, three-
quarters of the colleges and universities require this section of the ACT, so it’s in your best
interest to take this section. Taking this part of the test and assuming your college is going
to require it is better than not having a score to submit. In other words, take the darn test.
You have nothing to lose if your university doesn’t want it, and everything to lose if it does.
In this chapter you’ll find out about frequent pitfalls you can expect in writing and what
scoring system the ACT people use, and you’ll read sample essays that have received
scores ranging from one to six.
If you’re already an excellent writer, which most of you probably are, this chapter gives you
the added confidence you need to understand the ACT essay. If you’re not the greatest
writer, as many students are not, don’t despair. That’s what we’re here for. This chapter
teaches you the writing skills and builds up your confidence so you can use them! Seeing
how other people have done it makes beginning to write easier. As a result, we included
sample essays with low scores for you to laugh at (don’t worry, we don’t include their
names) and essays with high scores for you to learn from. Generally, test-takers are pro-
vided with a point-counterpoint topic and asked to write about one side or the other. For
information on how the essay test is administered, see Chapter 8.
Rattle Your Writing with Some Loose Screws
Relax. You’ve been writing since first grade, you have something to say, and this test is a way
to prove that. All you need is a quick refresher. Although you may be scared to death of put-
ting your ideas on paper with your name clearly indicated at the top (ooooohh, how we hate
to be judged), relax, your name is only on the first page and the ACT scoring folks don’t know
what you look like. Before you start, though, here are some things to consider and remember
to keep you from making the most common mistakes in essay writing. Keep these things in
mind, and you’ll write the best darn essay ever.
We know you can do it. Here we go . . . 

Thought diarrhea: Writing before you think
If you have no destination, you’re bound to get lost. The most important part of your essay 
is having structure and a clear idea of where you’re going. If you put your pen to the paper
without knowing what the heck you’re going to say, you can bet your bottom dollar that the
ACT folks won’t know what you’re saying either. Plan, plan, plan. Thought diarrhea, or writ-
ing just to be writing, leads to loose essays, and no one wants to read that mess. Besides that
kind of running off at the ink pen makes your writing stink. Creating a solid essay that has a
clear organizational plan, however, will get you a high score.
The attack of the clock: Panicking about time
Writer’s block, when you simply can’t think of anything to put down, often occurs in stressful
situations and frequently is caused by a time crunch. You have 30 full minutes to complete
the writing portion of the ACT. That’s plenty of time to read the question, organize your
thoughts, write, and do a quick edit. We suggest that taking 2 minutes to read the question, 
3 minutes to write your thesis and hook, 5 minutes to organize your thoughts, 17 minutes to
write, and 3 minutes to edit and proofread is an easy breakdown of the 30 minutes. Panicking
takes 30 minutes just to get over, and by then, your time’s up!
Being too relaxed: Not noticing your time limit
Be aware of your time but don’t panic. We know, that’s easier said than done. But remember
that the ACT people know that you don’t have enough time to write the great American
novel. However, they expect you to produce a good, concise essay in the time that’s allotted.
It’s important for you to start right away, use your time wisely, and stick to the time sched-
ule. You won’t have any time for deep, inner reflection, so don’t waste it. You have a time
limit; stick to it.
Expressing your inner poet: Using 
creativity as a crutch
College admissions offices are looking for your creative individualism, but the folks at the
ACT are looking for an essay. The ACT writing test gives you a prompt, or topic, to write
about. It is very specific, but it isn’t the time to write a novel, a journal entry, or a poem.
Although you may think you’re being creative and impressive, the real creativity lies in
impressing them with your writing skills. The ACT writing test is the time to conform to the
model of what the test-makers want (which is an organized, thought-out essay that answers
the question that they originally asked you), but you still can throw a dose of you into the
essay by using unique examples. The structure and the language of the essay need not be in
a creative format. Do what the test-makers want, so you get the score you want.
Big words with big consequences: 
Using words you don’t know
Nobody can be Shakespeare, especially in 30 minutes, not even Bill himself. When writing the
ACT, you won’t have the thesaurus button on your word processor in front of you. The worst
thing you can do is use words that you think sound good, but you’re not really sure what they
56
Part III: Writing the Writing Test Rightly: You Have a Choice 

mean. Instead of trying to use words that you don’t know, impress the ACT readers with your
thoughts and your ability to communicate clearly. Using words you don’t know or quite under-
stand, may give the ACT graders a laugh, but you won’t be laughing when you see your score.
Expecting perfection in 30 minutes: 
Being overcritical of yourself
Nobody writes the perfect essay in 30 minutes. Nobody! The graders know that. Trying to be
obsessively perfect does you more harm than good. If you spend too much time critiquing
yourself, the ACT graders won’t have anything to critique. You still can get a perfect score 
in 30 minutes, if you follow the suggestions and format in this book. Watch your time, stay
organized, express yourself clearly (and in your own words) and you can get the perfect
score, even though you can do better when given more time.
Speaking another language: Dude, 
they want to read English
We all know that speaking is much easier than writing. However, this test is neither the time
nor the place to impress the test-makers with your street vocabulary, dude. Whatever you
do, don’t drop it like it’s hot, don’t think you’re too cool for school, don’t think you’re kinda-
like the, like, greatest, or like “ohmygod” this is so cool, or else it’s your bad. In other words,
you’re not I’ming, you’re not talking to your best friends, and you’re not trying to communi-
cate on the playground. You are writing for a bunch of old fogies who have no idea what the
latest slang means, dude. (By the way, don’t ever use “dude” in your essay, dude.) Make sure
that you’re using words that your grandparents understand.
Being a wimp: Not taking a solid stand
Our definition of wimp is being indecisive. If you don’t take a solid position with your writing,
you’re going to get knocked down by the graders. You may read a question and think you 
can justify it in a few different ways, but nobody ever plays for two opposing teams. Don’t 
be scared of picking a side even though you don’t believe it. Sometimes you have to lie. The
ACT people won’t know that you’re lying. They only care that you sound confident and that
you can support yourself. Choose your thesis based on the amount of ideas you have to back
it up, and your solid thesis and back-up punches will give you a winning score.
You are not an island: Forgetting 
that people really read this stuff
The weekend before the ACT, you may be picketing your local politician, participating in a
hunger strike for the dying kids in Africa, or living in the trees to save the forests from corpo-
rate logging. However, the ACT essay is not a forum for political activism. Remember, the
people who score your essay come from all walks of life. You don’t want to become too con-
troversial and risk angering the reader so that it can affect your score. Remember that real
people are reading your essay from their points of view and your score may reflect their
counterviews. Steer clear of controversy.
57
Chapter 7: ACT Write: The First Words on Essay Writing

Do not do not repeat yourself: ’nuff said
One of the biggest mistakes that you can make on the ACT writing test is saying the same
thing again and again in different words. Don’t try to lengthen your essay by repeating your-
self. The test-graders got it at the first sentence. If you find yourself repeating sentences for
lack of things to say, then you’ve chosen the wrong topic. The way to avoid this mistake is by
organizing your thoughts and coming up with specific and different examples to prove your
thesis before writing your essay.
Leaving the bathroom with TP on your 
shoe: Not editing your essay
The most embarrassing thing that can happen to you on that perfect first date is your date
noticing that you have toilet paper sticking to your shoe. Date over. To counteract potential
faux pas like that, make sure that you double-check you shoes before leaving the bathroom —
hence a skill that can be applied to your ACT writing. (At last, a real-world skill you can
finally use.) Leave yourself time to proofread and check your essay for any obvious sentence
structure errors, spelling mistakes, lack of clarity, punctuation, repetition, and illegible hand-
writing. It helps you to avoid veritable TP that’s stuck to your writing. Proofreading and edit-
ing are the essential double-checking that you need to do before you walk out the door.
Making the Grade: How the ACT 
Folks Are Going to Score You
You’ll be happy to know that you personally receive not one, but two, yes two, trained read-
ers who will score your essay. And it gets better . . . if the first two don’t agree, you person-
ally receive a third, yes third, reader all to yourself. Aren’t you special? The ACT guys sure
think you are. Not only will you be fortunate enough to receive a numerical score, you even
have the pleasure of reading the graders’ individual comments on your writing. And yes, those
comments appear on your high school and college reports. So, we better get cracking . . . .
Here’s the skinny on the scoring:
Two readers read your essay and each assigns a numerical grade from 1 to 6. The sum of
those ratings is a student’s Writing Test Subscore (2 to 12). If you take the writing test, the
ACT people report the score as a Combined English/Writing Score. The English test con-
tributes two-thirds and the writing test contributes one-third toward the combined English/
Writing score. If you choose not to take this writing test, your score is reported only as the
English subscore. The absence of the writing test score won’t affect your score in any other
area.
Example Essays and Their Scores
The ACT essay is scored from one to six. One is the lowest score you can achieve, and a six is
the highest score. One of the best ways to avoid the common mistakes associated with receiv-
ing the lower scores is to read examples of all possible grades. After reading the examples

we’ve created, you will have a much better idea what to avoid in your writing. This next sec-
tion explains what it takes to get the highest possible scores on your essay. You also get a
chance to see samples of each scored essay so that you’re better prepared. Feel free to laugh
at the ones with lower scores. We did.
The ACT gives you a long-winded prompt for you to write about. Here’s the prompt and six
sample essays:
Example Prompt
In some high schools, many teachers and parents have encouraged the school to
adopt a dress code that sets guidelines for what students can wear in the school 
building. Some teachers and parents support a dress code because they think it will
improve the learning environment in the school. Other teachers and parents do not
support a dress code because they think it restricts the individual student’s freedom 
of expression. In your opinion, should high schools adopt dress codes for students?
In your essay, take a position on the question. You may write about either one of the two
points of view given, or you may present a different point of view on this question. Use spe-
cific reasons and examples to support your position.
Remember it doesn’t matter which side you choose to write about. Picking one or the other
won’t matter in the ACT graders’ eyes. All that matters is that you pick one side and support
your opinion.
1 — 1 is the loneliest number: How not to be a 1
I think students should have a dress code. There is a lot of gangsters at my school that
where there pants to low and I don’t really like it. If we had a dress code they wouldn’t
be allowed to do it. Girls should be able to wear shirts that show their stomach though
since it looks good and everyone else likes it. There should also be a dress code for
really stupid fashion. This should be imposed on teachers too. And principles. I think
this is only fair. Why should we have to be the only ones who who have to have a dress
code.
Being number 1 may be great for high school football, but it isn’t great on your ACT test. This
writer answered the question and chooses a side, but she did not support or back up her
statement. Not only does she not support herself, she goes off on a tangent and wanders
throughout the essay. Her lack of focus, irreverent examples, and her manner or writing like
she speaks is going to get her a 1 on the test. Oh, and by the way, the number of spelling and
word errors takes away from her ideas, is distracting, and definitely influences the way the
graders look at her paper.
2 — 2 little 2 late: Steer clear 
of coming in second
I don’t agree with the teachers and parents who think we should have a dress code. 
Our style of dress is what makes us individuals and sets us apart form each other.
At my school students who dress in certain ways find others who are like them. You
always know who is interested in the same stuff as you by what they wear. Imposing a
dress code doesn’t allow us to make friendships with people you are like ourselves.
59
Chapter 7: ACT Write: The First Words on Essay Writing

Uniforms would make people mad. Teachers would find it hard to control all their stu-
dents because students would want to rebel. Kids wouldn’t be able to find friends who
are like them and this would cause them to rebel.
These are just a few reasons why we should not have a dress code at school. There are
many more reasons then just these but these are the most important.
To ACT graders, a 2 means you show weak skill in writing the essay. At least they’re saying
you have some sort of skill, but it can be improved. This writer answers the question and
shows that he can support his point of view, but his lack of organization leaves readers’
heads spinning. The writer has paragraph structure in this essay, with clear indentations, an
introductory paragraph and conclusion, but transitioning between the two paragraphs is
missing. His simple sentence structures let everyone know that his writing skill may not be
as high as it should be. A 2 may be better than a 1, but it isn’t a score for which you should
strive.
3 — Still on the wrong side of the tracks
In my opinion, kids should not have a dress code because it takes away freedoms that
they should have. There are some clothing styles that teenagers wear that are not
appropriate like tight revealing clothes. But to make students buy certain clothes like
blue pants and white shirt infringes on their rights.
In America freedom of expression is very important and by forcing us to wear certain
things schools are taking away one of our rights. If they start taking away this right, they
might start taking away other ones too.
Dress codes are unfair because some families cannot afford them. Many kids would need
a whole new wardrobe and their families would have a hard time buying this for them.
Not only would they need clothes, but they also need clothes for outside of school. For
poorer families this would be hard.
A dress code would take away some of our freedom of expression and it would be a
financial strain for poorer families. I think that there should be no dress code.
A 3 is almost a reason for celebration. Almost. This writer answers the question, gives rea-
sons to support the ideas, and then gives even further reasoning to help with the argument.
She has structure, maintains focus in her paragraphs, and has sentences that are longer than
the ones written by eighth-graders. However, she’s still hanging around on the wrong side of
the tracks. The ACT folks are starting to recognize her developing skill, but she’s still grow-
ing. They want her to include some counterarguments and fully develop her ideas. Her para-
graphs are not complete, and she does not include the transitions that she needs to help her
essay flow. Ideas are logically grouped, but not logically displayed. With a little work, this
essay can make it to the right side of the tracks.
4 — The grass is greener on this side
I believe that it would be a good idea for our schools to adopt dress codes. Some people
argue that it would restrict student’s freedom of expression, but I do not agree with this
position. It is important that we have a right to express ourselves, but our society does
not allow us to have unrestricted freedoms like this all the time. It is important to learn
discipline, show respect for other’s feelings and learn how to be successful operating 
in the real world. Dress codes create a better learning environment and also helps stu-
dents prepare for their futures.
60
Part III: Writing the Writing Test Rightly: You Have a Choice 

The most important benefit of imposing dress codes would be creating a better school
environment. Students who are trying to concentrate and learn would be unfocused
because of inappropriate clothing. Small clothing, tight tops, and sagging pants might 
be okay for after school but not appropriate for the classroom. Certain types of people
might find profanity and obscene images offensive. Art and creative writing are better
ways to express your creativity rather than on your clothing. Less distractions in the
classroom would help a student to get a better education.
Another important benefit of having a dress code would teach students how to dress
properly for different occasions. Clothes that you would wear to a party would not
appropriate for a dinner with your boyfriends parents. Likewise, you wouldn’t wear your
work clothes on a date. Some jobs in society require people to wear uniforms. Dress
codes in schools help students to realize what the world is like and get ready to enter it.
Another important concern for students is trying to fit in. Dress codes take the empha-
sis off what you look like and put more emphasis on learning.
In conclusion, it is important for schools to adopt dress codes. Getting an education is
the most important thing about school and dress codes take away distractions. Learning
how to dress for the real world is also important. And it helps with the pressures of
trying to fit in.
A score of 4 would make anyone want to run and frolic through green pastures, because the
ACT folks think you have adequate writing skills. You may not be the best, but at least you’re
average and your score is respectable. This writer takes a stance and acknowledges counter-
arguments. Focus is maintained throughout the essay, and each idea in the better defined
paragraphs is developed enough to make the graders happy. This writer demonstrates a
simple organizational structure that works with an introduction and a conclusion that bal-
ance out the essay. ACT graders like the appropriate word choice and the ability of the writer
to demonstrate language control. This score shows that the writer learned his skills in
school, even though he may not become the next Shakespeare.
5 — Star material: Five-star winners
There is a debate now amongst parents and teachers about whether or not a dress code
should be used in schools. I agree with the position that believes that it will improve the
learning environment in our schools. I think a dress code would significantly improve
the excellence of our education. First, students would be able to focus on academics
rather than the social facet of school. Second, the appearance of the school would
improve and third, students would be better prepared for the working world.
The most crucial benefit of implementing a dress code would be to significantly reduce
the distractions in the classroom. For students to be successful in the future it is impor-
tant that we concentrate on the material being taught in the classroom. It is difficult 
to do this when you overhear students whispering about their newest Gucci purse or
admiring their best friend’s Prada shoes. Young people place such an emphasis on style
and image rather than substance. In addition, students see school as a social venue
rather than a learning environment.
Secondly, if the students and faculty are well groomed I believe that it improves the aes-
thetic appeal of the school. Formal attire is not necessary to achieve this. For example,
requiring long pants and a collared shirt would be sufficient. Not only would the school
look more professional, it would change the character of the school. Holding students to
a higher standard would require them to do it for themselves. It would improve their
maturity level as well.
61
Chapter 7: ACT Write: The First Words on Essay Writing

Finally, supporting a dress code would prepare today’s youth for the work of their future.
A plethora of jobs require uniforms or a standard dress code. I think it is important for
schools to not only prepare students academically for their future, but also in proper
conduct and grooming. Just because someone has impressive qualifications doesn’t
mean they’ll be hired if they look like they just rolled in from the beach. Allowing stu-
dents to dress however they choose might eventually be harmful to their future success.
The opposing view feels that a dress code would hinder a student’s freedom of expres-
sion, but I still think a dress code is a good idea. A dress code addresses the important
issues at hand while at the same time allowing the student to find more appropriate
ways of expression. It would be different if you could not paint or write creativity the
way you chose in school because that would affect your freedom of expression.
In conclusion, I strongly support the idea of a dress code. Not only does it improve our
learning environment but it also improves the character of the school and readies the
student for a successful future.
A score of 5 gets you a gold star on the blackboard! It isn’t ACT perfection, but it’s pretty
darn close. This writer was able to effectively address the issue by clearly answering the
question and by addressing the counterargument. This essay is organized and fluid and con-
tains a variety of specific examples. The ideas in each paragraph are developed and support
the argument. This writer explores a cultural component that shows advanced critical think-
ing skills and displays a mastery of vocabulary and precise word choice.
6 — You unlocked the code: A perfect score
The trend of inappropriate dress in our schools is causing alarm in our parents and edu-
cators. This population argues that inappropriate clothes is distracting in the classroom
and interferes in the learning environment. They also believe that adopting a dress code
would establish guidelines and frameworks for what students should and should not
wear on campus. The opposing view believes that a dress code would hinder the stu-
dent’s freedom of expression.
When freedom of expression begins to interfere with appropriate and clear education 
in the classroom, we have a serious dilemma and the issue needs to be addressed.
Obviously in our schools, the lack of a dress code is not working. We are not breaking
new ground when we suggest that the fashion that is spewed upon our youth in the
mass media is riddled with sexual undertones. Examples of this can be seen in every
teen magazine, every youth oriented television program and on the most popular of
music videos. Further, what advertisers would consider benign, stimulates and raises
the hormone levels of every young male. In our classrooms this can be very distracting.
The only solution to help create an environment where learning takes precedence is to
adopt school uniforms. Obviously, a uniform policy would be easier to enforce then a
dress code, and would bring many advantages to the entire academic population.
First and foremost, uniforms would help students to fight the materialistic world’s
values. Our society feels that designer labels, such as Gucci, Louis Vuitton, and Hilfinger
create self worth and that without these, a person is open to cruel comments and non-
acceptance. Many students cannot afford to “buy” their self worth and are required to
rise above the standards our society and media feeds them. As a teenager, acceptance is
the most crucial aspect of their daily lives, and school uniforms take away the financial
burden that our society imposes upon them. Although uniforms need purchasing, it car-
ries with it a minimal financial burden compared to overly high-priced current designer
wear that students will ask for.
62
Part III: Writing the Writing Test Rightly: You Have a Choice 

Uniforms could also help curb gang related violence that occurs in many of our nation’s
schools. Specific colors, logos and signs have all been adopted into the lifestyle of gang
members and each carry their own significance. What was once an ordinary red shirt,
could now be considered an intentional bullet fired in a gang battle. Uniforms decrease
the division lines between gangs, as well as protect students who are ignorant to the
unwritten laws that govern gangs.
For myself, uniforms would dramatically decrease the amount of time I spent preparing
for my day. No longer would I need to delve into the bottom of my closet to find an outfit
that I haven’t worn this week. I do not need to worry that I my best friend might come to
school in the same outfit as me, because uniforms ensure that they will! Uniforms give
me extra time to finish the homework I haven’t done, rather than spend it worrying
about my wardrobe.
Certainly no one is proclaiming that uniforms are the solution to all school-wide prob-
lems. There are still wide spread school related issues that could never be fixed with
clothes. Safety concerns, educational standards, bullying, and health related issues 
are areas that need further research. However, uniforms do help to ensure a learning
environment that is free from distractions and fosters creative expression in areas of
importance.
So, in conclusion, I highly value the worth of uniforms and feel they should be enforced
throughout the entire school district. Solving problems in the entire district would help
ensure a safer community, save us all money, and give us all some well needed extra
time in the morning.
The secret to your success on the ACT is a 6, and with an essay like this, you can earn it. The
ACT graders are practically drooling over this writer’s style, because it recognizes the com-
plexity of the issue, creates a stunning thesis, and then supports it with well-thought-out and
varied examples. She argues her side well, and includes arguments from opposing points of
view. Her structure and organization is logical, and she includes transitions between all of
her paragraphs. Her writing displays her own unique wit and personality, which she master-
fully executes in her essay. The ACT graders practically fell over in their seats when they
stumbled upon her words and her ability to use them. In 30 minutes, this writer glided
through the essay with eloquence and thoroughness that left the ACT graders stunned. She
deserved the 6.

 Finding out what the ACT is looking for in your essay
 Breaking down the essay into manageable parts
 Exploring the top five editing techniques
W
riting a great essay is totally different from writing a really great ACT essay. A great
essay is one you plan, think about for days, edit for more days, and the process usu-
ally takes a considerable amount of time. My friend, you have only 30 minutes, and that isn’t
enough time to write something that wins a literary award. But don’t fret! All you need to do
is figure out the ACT system.
For the sake of your time and interest, we’re just going to tell you exactly what they want
from you in your essay.
Did you:
 Make judgments? Doing so requires you to evaluate the question, decide your posi-
tion, and clearly articulate your position.
 Develop a position? Establishing a position requires you to explain your thoughts
using examples, reasons, and details.
 Maintain focus? Staying focused requires you to stay on your topic, not drift around,
and make sure you don’t add thoughts outside of the prompt question.
 Organize ideas? Organizing your thoughts and ideas requires you to present your
ideas in a logical way, using transitional words and sequencing your ideas so that they
build from each other.
 Communicate clearly? Communicating clearly requires you to use variety in sentence
structure and word choice, and it requires you to spell correctly and make sure your
grammar and punctuation are right.
Now that you know what is required of you when answering the essay question, we will break
down the essay step by step into manageable chunks. If you use the steps outlined in this
chapter, the essay is much easier than you think. You’ll be writing 30-minute essays in less
time than it takes to read this chapter! Breaking down the question and making a judgment is
the first step to success.
Keeping It Simple: Making a Judgment
Think of the ACT prompt as a courtroom. You’re the judge, and two lawyers are going to
present opposing sides to you. They will give you their long drawn-out narratives, practically
putting you to sleep, before they finally present the question to you. Your job is to rule on
the question, regardless of whether you know which lawyer is right. It’s your courtroom. You
must make a decision.

The writing prompt presents you with each side in a long statement that addresses common
high school ideas such as curfews, dress codes, magazines in libraries, competition, or com-
promising your beliefs.
The prompt is written to overwhelm you, bore you, and often includes
unnecessary information. The very end of the prompt will finally get to
the point, but you have to make it there. The first step is to decide
what side to write about. Remember, we told you that you don’t really
have to believe it yourself, you just need to write about it with 
confidence. The ACT people don’t know you and aren’t coming to your 
house to ask you to explain yourself further. The key to starting a
strong essay is taking a strong position right away.
1. Read the question. Here is the same sample prompt from Chapter 7:
Example Prompt
In some high schools, many teachers and parents encourage the school to adopt a
dress code that sets guidelines for what students can wear in the school building.
Some teachers and parents support a dress code because they think it will improve the
learning environment in the school. Other teachers and parents do not support a dress
code because they think it restricts the individual student’s freedom of expression. In
your opinion, should high schools adopt dress codes for students?
In your essay, take a position on this question. You may write about either one of the
two points of view given, or you may present a different point of view on this question.
Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.
2. Pay attention to the last two sentences of each paragraph. Typically, the last two sen-
tences in each paragraph of the prompt identify what you need to write about. Can you
identify the exact question in the above prompt? The very last sentence in the first
paragraph is asking you a specific question and telling you what to do.
• In your opinion, should high schools adopt dress codes for students?
• Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.
The last two sentences of each paragraph in the ACT Writing prompt are where you
find the direct question that you need to answer. Make sure to carefully read those last
two sentences.
3. Make a judgment regarding dress codes. Do you think schools need to have dress
codes? Or, do you think students should come to school naked (just needed to wake
you up here — did it work)? Do not just start writing before you decide what your posi-
tion is.
Fightin’ with Their Words: Incorporating 
the Question
Okay, so you’ve read the question and you’ve decided your position, now it’s time to write
your first sentence. You can go the hard way and spend precious time trying to impress and
sound really witty in the first sentence, or you can take our advice and use their words. Using
their words is the best route to go here, because it saves you time and guarantees that you
answered their question. The two ways you can do it are to rephrase the test-makers’
prompt, and fill in your position.
Rephrase the test prompt in your own words, and make it more specific. Taking the test-
makers’ prompt:
66
Part III: Writing the Writing Test Rightly: You Have a Choice 

Should high schools adopt dress codes for students?
You can write something like this:
High schools should adopt dress codes for students.
Looking closely, you’ll notice that we didn’t come up with a single new word! We just moved
one word, “Should.” It’s now the third word in the sentence, not the first. No brainpower
needed here. No time wasted. Easy as pie. Keep in mind, however, that this is the most basic
way of writing your first sentence. It may not get you a 6, but it definitely gets you started.
Or, you can write this:
I believe that high schools should adopt dress codes for students.
Check that out! All we did was add to their sentence. We deleted the “Should” in their sen-
tence and replaced it with “I believe that . . . ” Then, we took the “should” and stuck it in right
after “schools.”
Or, you can be a bit more dramatic:
A debate is being waged among teachers and parents regarding dress codes, and I
believe that dress codes should be mandatory for all schools.
Taking the test-makers’ question and turning it around to use it in your first sentence guaran-
tees that you answered the question. Now you can write more confidently because you know
that you already answered the question.
Putting Up Your Dukes: Deciding Your 
Position and Writing About It
Agree or disagree, it’s that simple. Don’t spend time debating with yourself and thinking,
“Well, I kinda agree with the agree side but not really because . . . ” You have no time for this.
Stop thinking so much! Don’t you love teachers that tell you not to think? We love that too.
Remember, the ACT folks do not care what you really feel, they just want an essay, and they
want one in 30 minutes! After you’ve rephrased the question, just agree or not.
Here are two “Nevers” to remember: Never tell the ACT folks the reasons why you agree or
disagree in the first sentence, and never straddle both sides of an issue.
Throwing a Good First Punch: The Hook
Now that you’ve taken a stand and answered the question, you need to expand your first
paragraph. Getting the reader’s attention is key to keeping it. You must hook (grab the atten-
tion of) your reader right from the beginning. Think of the first paragraph as a funnel going
from large thoughts to smaller ones. The first sentence needs to capture the overall debate
of the prompt. For example, if your prompt is about dress codes, you may want to write
something like:
The appropriateness of dress codes is the subject of widespread debate.
67
Chapter 8: Write Right: The Writing Test Review

Although you haven’t yet stated your position, you’ve let the reader know that the essay is
going to be about dress codes. You haven’t given up or tipped your hand yet, which makes
the reader want to continue reading your essay. Good job!
Following the funnel down, you need to express both sides of the argument. Doing that is
easier than you think, because the original prompt gives you both sides of the debate.
Reread the second and third sentences in your prompt. Reword them in your own voice 
and stick those thoughts right after your first sentence.
Example Prompt
In some high schools, many teachers and parents have encouraged their schools to adopt
dress codes that set guidelines for what students can wear in the school building. Some
teachers and parents support dress codes because they think they will improve the
learning environment in the schools. Other teachers and parents do not support dress
codes because they think they restrict the freedom of expression of individual stu-
dents. In your opinion, should high schools adopt dress codes for students?
You may write:
Although some people believe a dress code will improve the learning environment,
others argue that dress codes may restrict individual freedom of expression.
Every prompt gives you both sides. You need to include the information it provides to show
that you recognize both arguments. The ACT people are sticklers for this. Your score will be
low whenever you fail to show counterarguments.
The next sentence in your first paragraph is important. It comes before you hit the graders
with your position, and it expands your position on the side that you’ve chosen. To establish
your position, you merely have to state three points that you will cover in your essay that
support your side. These points eventually turn into your three essay body paragraphs,
which we discuss in more depth later in “The Proof Is in the Pudding: Proving Yourself.”
You can write:
It’s apparent to me that certain types of clothing can be distracting, lead to school vio-
lence, and interfere with a student’s ability to fit in.
Now that you’ve brought the reader closer to home after dancing around the issue, deliver a
knockout punch. Be clear, be concise, and let the reader have your opinion. You already
wrote it, remember? You even used the test-makers’ words.
I believe that high schools should adopt dress codes for students.
You’ve hit the bottom of your funnel, and you’ve hit the reader with one heck of a strong
punch.
Your first paragraph is now complete:
The appropriateness of dress codes is the subject of widespread debate. Although some
people believe a dress code will improve the learning environment, others argue that
dress codes may restrict individual freedom of expression. It’s apparent to me that cer-
tain types of clothing can be distracting, lead to school violence, and interfere with stu-
dent’s ability to fit in. I believe that high schools should adopt dress codes for students.
When writing the proper hook paragraph, the thesis is the last sentence in that first para-
graph. Don’t give up your hand too early, and don’t neglect building the suspense.
68
Part III: Writing the Writing Test Rightly: You Have a Choice 

The Proof Is in the Pudding: Proving Yourself
To create the great ACT essay, you must use specific examples, reasons, and details that
prove your topic. The ACT folks are looking for two things here:
 Specific examples
 Variety of examples
Specific examples
We remember back in high school when our parents were always asking for specific details
about how we spent our evenings: Where did you go? Who was there? Why are you home so
late? Who drove? How long has he had his license? The list was endless, and vague answers
never cut it. This skill you’ve been practicing for years is going to come in handy when you
take your ACT Writing Test, because you’re already great at giving the specifics (or making
them up). Really good examples discuss extremely specific details, events, dates, and occur-
rences. Your goal is to write in detail and try not to be too broad and loose. For example, let’s
say that you’re trying to find examples to support dress codes. Perhaps you can come up
with an example how allowing students to wear whatever they want leads to distraction
among the students. Great, but you need to be more specific. You need to give an example
from your life when you witnessed this occurring, or you need to site an article you read, or
give the reader a scenario supporting your position. In other words, give dates, mention
people, rat on your friends! Just choose examples that you know a lot about so that you can
get down to the nitty gritty and be extremely specific.
Variety of examples
Together with specific examples, we often had to come up with a variety of excuses for
breaking curfew — the car broke down, traffic was horrendous, the movie ran late, you forgot
the time, you fell asleep . . . you know the routine. Again, thank your parents for helping you
with yet another skill you can apply to the ACT Writing Test. When you’re writing, you need
to use a variety of examples. Coming up with three specific examples about how you feel
about dress codes just from your personal life is easy, but it also would be boring. Don’t take
this the wrong way, but the only person who wants to read three pages about you is you.
Use a broad range of examples from different areas such as literature, cultural experience,
your personal life, current events, business, and history. If you spend just a few moments
thinking about it, you can come up with three great examples all taken from varied areas.
So, to answer the question, “Should schools require students to have dress codes?” you may
come up with three examples like these:
 Personal life: A scenario where you saw a girl wearing a short skirt and teeny top and
how it interfered with other students’ ability to concentrate.
 Literature: An example from a magazine article you read about Columbine and how
the boys who fired guns in their school were trying to hurt the kids who looked and
dressed like jocks.
 Cultural experience: The concern regarding wearing gang-related colors and logos,
and the potential implications doing so may have regarding violence in the schools.
A nice variety of examples like these definitely gets the attention of the ACT folks and helps
you sound like the smart writer that you are.

Hamburger Writing: The Organization 
of the Essay
Ever take apart a Big Mac? Well, okay, we don’t blame you for not wanting to really see what’s
lurking in there (even though they taste darn good). If you ever decided to do it, you would
find that every single Big Mac is built the same exact way. They don’t ever deviate! “Two-all-
beef-patties-special-sauce-lettuce-cheese-pickles-onion-on-a-sesame-seed-bun.” Every time,
our dear fast-food friends! And boy, did that company know what they were doing! What we
are teaching you is that every great essay is organized like a Big Mac. (See Figure 8-1.) No
matter what your prompt is, the ACT wants to see a specific format to your writing and 
doesn’t want all the ingredients thrown in any old way. The organization that we are about to
explain to you makes sure that you give those ACT people a supersized essay.
Top Bun: The introduction
The top bun includes the funnel of information that leads to your thesis. We just taught you
how to write it in the previous section. Done.
The Three Meats: Example paragraphs
For your supporting arguments think in terms of three different kinds of meat. Each meat rep-
resents a separate paragraph in your essay, the purpose of which is to add specific examples
that help prove the position that you stated in your top bun (are you getting hungry yet?).
Each paragraph needs to include:
 About four to five sentences.
 A solid topic sentence that relates directly to your position. Remember, you already
wrote your three ideas in your top bun (the third sentence of your introduction).
 Variety of reasons, details, and examples that illustrate that specific topic.
In your top bun, you wrote that clothing can be distracting, remember? We are going to use
that thought as the topic sentence for this first meat paragraph. You may write:
One of the reasons that a dress code should be mandated is because some clothing
choices can be very distracting in the learning environment.

Part III: Writing the Writing Test Rightly: You Have a Choice 

Now you have to write four or five sentences that prove that clothing can be distracting.
Make sure that you use specific and clear examples and details taken from a variety of areas,
including personal experience, history, culture, and literature. Do not stray off topic, or in
this case, begin writing about anything else other than clothing being distracting. In other
words, don’t get distracted when writing about distraction.
Sink your teeth into this meat paragraph:
One of the reasons that a dress code needs to be mandated is because a variety of cloth-
ing choices can be very distracting in the learning environment. MTV and pop stars
flash images of young girls wearing practically nothing, for example, a fashion that most
teenagers try to emulate (culture reference). However, wearing skimpy clothes and
showing body parts can make some people look, perhaps react, and maybe even inter-
rupt an important part of class and that can be quite distracting when you’re trying to
learn the Pythagorean theorem (personal experience reference). Furthermore, paying
attention to the teacher is difficult when you hear people discussing another student’s
$150 Dolce and Gabana jeans (cultural reference). A dress code does away with these
distractions by enforcing a more conservative style of clothing, allowing the focus in the
classroom to remain on education rather than fashion.
Your essay cannot be full, however, even after a meaty paragraph like the last one. Although
you still have two more to gobble down, don’t despair, you have time! The topics of the next
two examples (meats) already have been decided in your introduction, remember? You men-
tioned distractions, school violence, and fitting in. You already wrote about distractions;
your second meat is about school violence, and your third is about fitting in.
Make it easy on yourself. Structure the second and third examples exactly like you did in the
first one by including:
 A solid topic sentence that defends your position.
 Four to five sentences where you give reasons, details, and examples that support your
topic in this paragraph.
 A variety of examples taken from different areas such as literature, culture, personal
experience, and history.
Transitions
Like the sandwich we’re comparing it to, your essay needs to taste good, or read well, as a
whole. Transitions serve as the special sauce, smoothing out the differences between your
paragraphs. Your second and third meat paragraphs require transitions. The best way to do
this is by using transitional words such as secondly, finally, another idea, another example,
furthermore, and in addition, to name a few.
The Bottom Bun: Conclusion
No matter how full of this essay you are, you need to eat the bottom bun. Look on the bright
side; it’s the end. You can throw up in a little while. The bottom bun or conclusion of your
essay needs to include:
 A restatement of your position.
 An expansion of your position that looks to the future.
71
Chapter 8: Write Right: The Writing Test Review

You can do this in three to four sentences. Make sure that you include your position, refer-
ences to your meat topics, and one sentence that pulls it all together. Here’s an example:
Implementing a dress code policy would be a beneficial school policy (restatement of
your position). Implementing a dress code has the potential to limit distractions in the
classroom, reduce school-related violence, and help students find more creative ways to
fit in (references to your meat topics). A dress code would direct the appropriate school
focus back on education rather than on its being a fashion show (looking toward the
future).
Wielding the Red Pen: Editing and Proofing
Okay, with the finish line directly in front of you, all you have left to do is a quick sprint to the
end of your essay. If you’re like us, at this point, you either think that your writing is perfect
and doesn’t need correcting (ha!) or that you’re finished, done, over it, goodbye and see you
later, essay, I’m handing you in!
However, our editors don’t put our writing on the same pedestal that we do, and your essay
score will reflect your hasty goodbye. It isn’t over until you’ve checked your writing. This
section gives you five quick editing and proofreading techniques to keep you from tripping
before you hit the finish line. You need to double-check what you wrote, correct it, and give it
a champion’s finish.
Relax, you’ve already learned it
Chapter 4 of this book reviews the basic rules of grammar and sentence structure and
reminds you of simple things to watch for when you check your sentences. Being the won-
derful student that you are, you probably already have studied that chapter and now are
ready to launch straight into these Top Five Editing Techniques.
Top four editing techniques
Touch method: Spelling and ghost words
Your brain is smarter than you think it is. When proofreading, your brain sees words that you
intended to write, but didn’t actually get around to writing. Most of time they are just little
words, but without them your sentences and essay fail. Use your pencil to physically touch
every single word that you wrote. Doing so helps you find words that you omitted, catch
simple spelling errors, and find where you repeated words or thoughts. The smallest errors
often are the most costly. The three easiest mistakes to catch are “there,” “their,” and
“they’re”; “your” and “you’re”; and “it’s” and “its.” Touching the words as you proofread
helps you outsmart your brain and catch these simplest of mistakes.
R and R: Review for repetition
Rest and relaxation come after you’ve checked for repetition. Reading through your essay to
see whether you have repeated yourself is important. Sometimes when examples are lacking,
writers have a tendency to say the same things again and again, using different words. If you
find that your essay reads like one long sentence, you must spice it up and add some differ-
ent thoughts.
72
Part III: Writing the Writing Test Rightly: You Have a Choice 

Active voice: Show, not tell
You can’t score a 6 if readers fall asleep in the middle of your essay. Wake them up by forcing
them to read caffeine-filled words. In other words, use bold, action verbs rather than mild-
mannered wimpy verbs. For example, instead of writing, “He ran to the store quickly,”
replace “ran” with “bolted,” “sprinted,” or “flew.” These words express more action and give
the sentence movement. Ran is boring. Replacing boring verbs with verbs that create vivid
pictures definitely improves your essay. Check out the three sentences that follow; each is
written two ways (one is boring and tired and the other active and engaging):
1. Boring: Holden is a dynamic character.
Exciting: Holden’s character screams personality in the novel.
2. Boring: My grandfather taught me a lot.
Exciting: My grandfather’s wisdom inspires me every day.
3. Boring: There are three reasons why I believe that this invention is the greatest.
Exciting: Three reasons prove why this invention transformed the world.
Use words that help the reader visualize what you’re saying. Caffeinated verbs activate your
reader, giving your essay an added boost of action.
Punk-tu-a-tion
Rebellion against authority may be your motto; it certainly was ours in high school. However,
you cannot rebel against grammar rules. They always win. Here are the questions you need
to ask yourself and the things you need to look for when editing for punctuation:
 Did I use the correct periods, exclamation points, and question marks?
 Did I capitalize the first words of my sentences and proper nouns?
 Do my subjects agree with my verbs?
 Did I use commas correctly?
 Are any of my sentences run-ons or fragments?
 Are my words spelled correctly?
This Was Not a Prescription: Handwriting
You need to get into med school first before you can write like a doctor. If the ACT graders
cannot read your prescription for success, then you can bet your bottom dollar that your
score will be low. The brilliant essay you just wrote may just save your entire ACT score, but
if nobody can read it, it’s a prescription for failure. Illegible writing is an easy error to catch
as you proofread your essay. If you can’t read your writing, you must erase what can’t be
read and rewrite it. Pencils, with erasers, what a brilliant invention!

o far, you’ve done a really good job reading about writing. But, you’ll never get better 
at writing without actually writing. In this chapter, we give you two sample prompts to
practice with, and we suggest that you time yourself so that you get a sense for what 30
minutes of writing feels like. Practicing like this also helps you avoid panicking when you
take the real test. Pencils out! Here we go.
Writing Prompt #1
Many successful people believe that a competitive environment fosters high achievement.
In high schools, some parents and teachers think that competition between students
encourages them to strive toward higher academic potential. Others think that academic
competition negatively affects students’ performance by causing undue stress and feel-
ings of failure. In your opinion, should high schools encourage a competitive academic
atmosphere?
In your essay, take a position on this question. You may write about either one of the two
points of view given, or you may present a different point of view on this question. Use
specific reasons and examples to support your position.

Writing Prompt #2
The prevailing attitude in many countries is that leaders must maintain the highest ethical
and moral standards. Some people think that this attitude sets a good example for a coun-
try and its citizens. Others argue that leaders who show normal, human flaws connect
them with their people and thereby enable progress and growth. In your opinion, should
leaders always be accountable for high moral and ethical standards?
In your essay, take a position on this question. You may write about either one of the two
points of view given, or you may present a different point of view on this question. Use
specific reasons and examples to support your position.

Part IV
Don’t Count Yourself 
Out: The Math Review 
and Mini-Test 

In this part . . .
You knew it was coming, didn’t you? There’s no way 
to get through a test prep book without having a
math review. This book gives you three for the price of
one: geometry, algebra/trigonometry, and miscellaneous
math. I’ve worked hard to make this stuff as painless as
possible by throwing in the odd joke here and there and
by using some examples that are a lot more fun than any
you’d actually see on the ACT. After all, you’re bound to
experience a little bit of sensory overload as you cover
three years of math in just three chapters.
But I don’t waste your time. I don’t insult you by starting
too far back (“here are the multiplication tables you must
know”), and I don’t give you material that’s not tested 
(like calculus) just to impress you with my abilities. (Hey,
if I can’t impress you with my jokes, forget it!) Instead, 
I emphasize what you’re most likely to see on the test,
reviewing all the formulas and even some of the math
vocabulary, like prime and composite numbers.
Note: If you haven’t covered some of the material in these
reviews, don’t worry about it. Maybe you haven’t had trig
yet (only four of the ACT questions cover the subject, so
don’t start panicking!) or even geometry. That’s okay. You
should still be able to follow most of the material. Just do
what you can and have fun with it.
This part also features a chapter on how to approach the
math questions on the ACT, including what to do when
you don’t have a clue. You can discover how to recognize
and avoid built-in traps, how to use the answer choices to
save yourself time and headaches in solving the problems,
and which questions are time-wasters that are best to guess
at quickly and leave behind in your dust. (Remember: The
ACT assesses no penalty for guessing, so even random
guessing is worthwhile.)
After that chapter is a mini-test, just 12 questions, that
allows you to download some of the things you’ve been
learning . . . and see whether you really can recognize
those traps.

eometry is one of the areas that can mess you up on the ACT. But it’s easy when you 
take the time to memorize some rules. This chapter provides a lightning-fast review of
the major points of geometry so you can go into the test equipped to tackle the geometry
questions with ease.
You Gotta Have an Angle
Angles are a big part of the ACT geometry problems. Fortunately, understanding angles is
easy when you memorize a few basic concepts. And keep in mind the best news: You don’t
have to do proofs. Finding an angle usually is a matter of simple addition or subtraction.
These three rules generally apply to the ACT:
 No negative angles exist.
 No zero angles exist.
 It is extremely unlikely that you’ll see any fractional angles. (For example, an angle
won’t measure 451⁄2 degrees or 323⁄4 degrees.)
Angles are whole numbers. If you’re plugging in a number for an angle, plug in a whole
number such as 30, 45, or 90.
1. Angles greater than 0 but less than 90 degrees are called acute. Think of an acute
angle as being a cute little angle.
45°
Acute angle

2. Angles equal to 90 degrees are called right angles. They’re formed by perpendicular
lines and indicated by a box in the corner of the two intersecting lines.
Don’t automatically assume that angles that look like right angles are right angles.
Without calculating the amount or degree of the angle, the only ways you know that an
angle is a right angle are if: (A) You’re expressly told, “This is a right angle”; (B) you see
the perpendicular symbol (⊥) indicating that the lines form a 90-degree angle; or (C) you
see the box in the angle. Assume otherwise, and you may be headed for a trap!
3. Angles that total 90 degrees are called complementary angles. Think of C for corner (the
lines form a 90-degree corner angle) and C for complementary.
4. An angle that is greater than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees is called obtuse.
Think of obtuse as obese — an obese (or fat) angle is an obtuse angle.
5. An angle that measures exactly 180 degrees is called a straight angle.
6. Angles that total 180 degrees are called supplementary angles.
Think of S for supplementary (or straight) angles. Be careful not to confuse complemen-
tary angles (C for complementary or corner) with supplementary angles (S for supple-
mentary or straight). If you’re likely to get these confused, just think alphabetically. C
comes before S in the alphabet; 90 comes before 180 when you count.

7. An angle that is greater than 180 degrees but less than 360 degrees is called a reflex
angle.
Reflex angles rarely are tested on the ACT.
8. Angles around a point total 360 degrees.
9. Angles that are opposite each other have equal measures and are called vertical
angles. Just remember that vertical angles are across from each other, whether they’re
up and down (vertical) or side by side (horizontal).
10. Angles in the same position around two parallel lines and a transversal (correspon-
ding angles) have the same measures.
When you see two parallel lines and a transversal (that’s the line going across the paral-
lel lines), number the angles. Start in the upper-right corner with 1 and go clockwise.
For the second batch of angles, start in the upper-right corner with 5 and go clockwise:

Note that all odd-numbered angles are equal and all even-numbered angles are equal.
Be careful not to zigzag back and forth when numbering. If you zig when you should
have zagged, you can no longer use the tip that all even-numbered angles are equal to
one another and all odd-numbered angles are equal to one another.
11. The exterior angles of any figure are supplementary to the interior angles and total
360 degrees.
Exterior angles always total 360 degrees, no matter what type of figure you have.
Triangle Trauma
1. A triangle with three equal sides and three equal angles is called equilateral.
2. A triangle with two equal sides and two equal angles is called isosceles.
3. Angles opposite equal sides in an isosceles triangle are also equal.

82
Part IV: Don’t Count Yourself Out: The Math Review and Mini-Test 

4. A triangle with no equal sides and no equal angles is called scalene.
5. In any triangle, the largest angle is opposite the longest side.
6. In any triangle, the sum of the lengths of two sides must be greater than the length
of the third side. This statement is often written as a + b > c, where a, b, and c are the
sides of the triangle.
7. In any type of triangle, the sum of the interior angles is 180 degrees.
A trap question may want you to assume that different-sized triangles have different
angle measures. Wrong! A triangle can be seven stories high and have 180 degrees or be
microscopic and have 180 degrees. The size of the triangle is irrelevant; every triangle’s
internal angles add up to 180 degrees.
8. The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two remote
interior angles.

Similar figures
1. The sides of similar figures are in proportion. For example, if the heights of two similar
triangles are in a ratio of 2:3, then the bases of those triangles also are in a ratio of 2:3.
2. The ratio of the areas of similar figures is equal to the square of the ratio of their
sides. For example, if each side of Figure A is 1⁄3 the length of each side of similar 
Figure B, then the area of Figure A is 1⁄9 or (1⁄3)2 the area of Figure B.
Two similar triangles have bases of 5 and 25. Which of the following expresses the ratio of
the areas of the two triangles?
A. 1:5
B. 1:15
C. 1:25
D. 1:30
E. 1:50
The ratio of the sides is 1⁄5. The ratio of the areas is the square of the ratio of the sides: 
1⁄5 × 1⁄5 = 1⁄25. Correct answer: C.
Bonus: What do you suppose the ratio of the volumes of two similar figures is? Because
volume is found in cubic units, the ratio of the volumes of two similar figures is the cube of
the ratio of their sides. If figure A has a base of 5 and similar figure B has a base of 10, then
the ratio of their volumes is 1:8 (1:23, which is 1⁄2 × 1⁄2 × 1⁄2 = 1⁄8).
Don’t assume that figures are similar; you must be told that they are.

Area
1. The area of a triangle is 1⁄2 base × height. The height always is a line perpendicular to
the base. The height may be a side of the triangle, as in a right triangle.
The height may be inside the triangle. It often is represented by a dashed line and a
small 90-degree box.
The height may be outside the triangle. Remember: You can always drop an altitude.
That is, put your pencil on the tallest point of the triangle and draw a line straight from
that point to where the base would be if it were extended.
2. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides.
Pythagorean theorem
You probably have studied the Pythagorean theorem. Keep in mind that it works only on
right triangles. If a triangle doesn’t have a right — or 90-degree-angle, you can’t use any of the
following information.
In any right triangle, you can find the lengths of the sides with the formula
a2 + b2 = c2
where a and b are the sides of the triangle and c is the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse always is
opposite the 90-degree angle and always is the longest side of the triangle.

Pythagorean triples
Having to work the whole Pythagorean Theorem formula every time you want to find the
length of a side is a pain in the posterior. You’ll find five very common ratios in right triangles.
1. Ratio 3:4:5. If one side of the triangle is 3 in this ratio, the other side is 4 and the
hypotenuse is 5.
Because Ratio 3:4:5 exists, the sides can be in any multiple of these numbers, such as
6:8:10 (twice 3:4:5), 9:12:15 (three times 3:4:5), or 27:36:45 (nine times 3:4:5).
2. Ratio 5:12:13. If one side of the right triangle is 5 in this ratio, the other side is 12 and
the hypotenuse is 13.
Because this is a ratio, the sides can be in any multiple of these numbers, such as
10:24:26 (twice 5:12:13), 15:36:39 (three times 5:12:13), or 50:120:130 (ten times 5:12:13).
3. Ratio s: s: s s
2, where s stands for the side of the figure. Because two s’s are alike
or two sides are the same, this formula applies to an isosceles right triangle, also
known as a 45:45:90 triangle. If one side is 2, then the other side also is 2 and the 
hypotenuse is 2
2.
This formula is great to know for squares. If a question tells you that the side of a
square is 5 and wants to know the diagonal of the square, you know immediately that 
it is 5
2. Why? A square’s diagonal cuts the square into two isosceles right triangles
(isosceles because all sides of the square are equal; right because all angles in a square 
are right angles). What is the diagonal of a square of side 64? 64
2. What is the diag-
onal of a square of side 12,984? 
,
12 984
2.
There’s another way to write this ratio. Instead of s: s: s s
2, you can write it as s
2 : s
2 :s
in which s still stands for the side of the triangle, but now you’ve divided everything 
through by s
2. Why do you need this complicated formula? Suppose you’re told that
the diagonal of a square is 5. What is the area of the square? What is the perimeter of
the square?

Part IV: Don’t Count Yourself Out: The Math Review and Mini-Test 

If you know the formula s
2 : s
2 : s, you know that s stands for the hypotenuse of the  
triangle, the same as the diagonal of the square. If s = 5, then the side of the square is 
2
5 and you can figure out the area or the perimeter. After you know the side of a 
square, you can figure out just about anything.
4. Ratio s:s: 3:2s. This special formula is for the sides of a 30:60:90 triangle.
This type of triangle is a favorite of test-makers. The important thing to keep in mind
here is that the hypotenuse is twice the length of the side opposite the 30-degree angle.
If you get a word problem saying, “Given a 30:60:90 triangle of hypotenuse 20, find the
area” or “Given a 30:60:90 triangle of hypotenuse 100, find the perimeter,” you can do so
because you can find the lengths of the other sides.
Thanks 4 Nothing: Quadrilaterals
1. Any four-sided figure is called a quadrilateral.
The interior angles of any quadrilateral total 360 degrees. Any quadrilateral can be cut
into two 180-degree triangles.
2. A square is a quadrilateral with four equal sides and four right angles.

The area of a square is side2 (also called base × height), or 1⁄2 d2, where d stands for 
diagonal.
3. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with four equal sides and four angles that are not neces-
sarily right angles. A rhombus often looks like a drunken square, tipsy on its side and
wobbly.
The area of a rhombus is 1⁄2 d1d2 (or 1⁄2 diagonal1 × diagonal2).
Any square is a rhombus, but not all rhombuses are squares.
4. A rectangle is a quadrilateral with two opposite and equal pairs of sides. That is, the
top and bottom sides are equal, and the right and left sides are equal. All angles in a
rectangle are right angles.
The area of a rectangle is length × width (which is the same as base × height).
5. A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with two opposite and equal pairs of sides. The
top and bottom sides are equal, and the right and left sides are equal. Opposite angles
are equal but not necessarily right (or 90 degrees).
The area of a parallelogram is base × height. Remember that the height always is a
perpendicular line from the tallest point of the figure down to the base. Diagonals of a
parallelogram bisect each other.
All rectangles are parallelograms, but not all parallelograms are rectangles.
6. A trapezoid is a quadrilateral with two parallel sides and two nonparallel sides.
The area of a trapezoid is 1⁄2 (base1 + base2) × height. It makes no difference which base
you label base 1 and which you label base 2, because you’re adding them together. Just
be sure to add them before you multiply by 1⁄2.

Quaint quads: Bizarre quadrilaterals
Some quadrilaterals don’t have nice, neat shapes or special names.
If you see a strange shape, don’t immediately say that you have no way of finding its area. You
may be able to divide the quadrilateral into two triangles and find the area of each triangle
and add them together. You may also see a strange quadrilateral in a shaded-area problem.
Leftovers again: Shaded-area problems
Think of a shaded area as a leftover. It is “left over” after you subtract the unshaded area
from the total area.
Shaded areas often are very unusual shapes. Your first reaction may be that you can’t possi-
bly find the area of that shape. Generally, you’re right, but you don’t have to find the area
directly. Instead, be sly, devious, and sneaky; in other words, think the ACT way! Find the
area of the total figure, find the area of the unshaded portion, and subtract.

Triangles and quadrilaterals probably are the most common polygons tested on this exam. 
A polygon is a closed plane figure bounded by straight sides. Table 10-1 explains a few other
polygons you may see:
1. A polygon with all equal sides and all equal angles is called regular. For example, an
equilateral triangle is a regular triangle and a square is a regular quadrilateral.
You are rarely asked to find the areas of any polygons with more than four sides.
2. The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of the lengths of all the sides.
3. The exterior angle measure of any polygon is 360°.
Now, to find the interior angle measure, use the formula (n – 2) 180°, where n stands for the
number of sides.

Knowing this, triple-check your work if you come up with 180 for an answer to this type
of problem; you may have made this (very typical) careless error.
Volume
The volume of any polygon is (area of the base) × height. If you remember this formula, you
don’t have to memorize any of the following more specific formulas.
1. Volume of a cube: e3
A cube is a three-dimensional square. Think of a die (one of a pair of dice). All of a cube’s
dimensions are the same; that is, length = width = height. In a cube, these dimensions
are called edges. The volume of a cube is edge × edge × edge = edge3 = e3.
2. Volume of a rectangular solid: l × w × h
A rectangular solid is a box. The base of a box is a rectangle, which has an 
area of length × width. Multiply that by height to fit the original formula: 
Volume = (area of base) × height, or V = l × w × h.
3. Volume of a cylinder: (πr2)height
Think of a cylinder as a can of soup. The base of a cylinder is a circle. The area of a 
circle is πr2. Multiply that by the height of the cylinder to get (area of base) × height

= (πr2) × height. Note that the top and bottom of a cylinder are identical circles. If you know
the radius of either the top base or the bottom base, you can find the area of the circle.
Total surface area (TSA)
The total surface area, logically enough, is the sum of the areas of all the surfaces of the
figure.
1. TSA of a cube: 6e2
A cube has six identical faces, and each face is a square. The area of a square is side2.
Here, that is called edge2. If one face is edge2, then the total surface area is 6 × edge2, 
or 6e2.
2. TSA of a rectangular solid: 2(lw) + 2(wh) + 2(hl )
A rectangular solid is a box. You need to find the area of each of the six surfaces. The
bottom and top have the area of length × width. The left side and right side have the area
of width × height. The front side and the back side have the area of height × length.
Together, they total 2(lw) + 2(wh) + 2(hl) or 2(lw + wh + hl).
3. TSA of a cylinder: (circumference × height) + 2(πr2)
This TSA definitely is the most difficult to figure out. Think of it as pulling the label off
the can, flattening it out, finding its area, and then adding that to the area of the top
and bottom lids. The label is a rectangle. Its length is the length of the circumference of
the circle.

Its height is the height of the cylinder. Multiply length × height to find the area of the
label.
You also need to find the area of the top and bottom of the cylinder. Because each is a
circle, the TSA of the top and bottom is 2(πr2). Add everything together.

Running Around in Circles
Did you hear about the rube who pulled his son out of college, claiming that the school was
filling his head with nonsense? As the rube said, “Joe Bob told me that he learned πr2. But any
fool knows that pie are round; cornbread are square!”
Circles are among the less complicated geometry concepts. The most important things are to
remember the vocabulary and to be able to distinguish an arc from a sector and an inscribed
angle from a central angle. Here’s a quick review of the basics.
1. A radius goes from the center of a circle to its circumference (perimeter).
2. A circle is named by its center (midpoint).
3. A diameter connects two points on the circumference of the circle, going through the
center, and is equal to two radii.
4. A chord connects any two points on a circle.
5. The longest chord in a circle is the diameter.
Here’s a lovely question you may see on the test. What is the area of a circle of longest
chord 12?
F. 144π
G. 72π
H. 36π
J. 12π
K. Cannot be determined from the information given

The diameter of this circle is 12, which means its radius is 6, because a diameter is
twice the radius. The area of a circle is πr2. Here, π62 = 36π. Correct answer: H.
Choice K is the trap answer. If you know only that a chord of the circle is 12, you can’t
solve the problem. A circle has many different chords. You need to know the length of
the longest chord, or the diameter.
Bonus: You may encounter a wheel question in which you’re asked how much distance
a wheel covers or how many times a wheel revolves. The key to solving this type of
question is knowing that one rotation of a wheel equals one circumference of that
wheel.
A child’s wagon has a wheel of radius 6 inches. If the wagon wheel travels 100 revolu-
tions, approximately how many feet has the wagon rolled?
A. 325
B. 314
C. 255
D. 201
E. 200
One revolution is equal to one circumference: C = 2πr = 2π6 = 12π = approximately 37.68
inches. Multiply that by 100 = 3,768 inches = 314 feet. Correct answer: B.
6. The area of a circle is π × radius2.
7. A central angle has its endpoints on the circumference of the circle and its center at
the center of the circle. The degree measure of a central angle is the same as the
degree measure of its intercepted arc.
8. An inscribed angle has both its endpoints and its center on the circumference of the
circle. The degree measure of an inscribed angle is half the degree measure of its
intercepted arc.

You may see a figure that looks like a string picture you made at summer camp, with all
sorts of lines running every which way. Take the time to identify the endpoints of the
angles and the center point. You may be surprised at how easy the question suddenly
becomes. In this figure, for example, find the sum of a + b + c + d + e.
F. 65°
G. 60°
H. 55°
J. 50°
K. 45°
Each angle is an inscribed angle; it has half the degree measure of the central angle, or
half the degree measure of its intercepted arc. If you look carefully at the endpoints of
these angles, they’re all the same. They are along arc XY, which has a measure of 20
degrees. Therefore, each angle is 10 degrees, for a total of 50. Correct answer: J.
9. When a central angle and an inscribed angle have the same endpoints, the degree
measure of the central angle is twice that of the inscribed angle.
10. The degree measure of a circle is 360.
11. An arc is a portion of the circumference of a circle. The degree measure of an arc is
the same as its central angle and twice its inscribed angle.
To find the length of an arc, follow these steps:
1. Find the circumference of the entire circle.
2. Put the degree measure of the arc over 360 and then reduce the fraction.
3. Multiply the circumference by the fraction.

Find the length of arc AC.

B. 27π
C. 18π

E. 6π
Take the steps one at a time. First, find the circumference of the entire circle. C = 2πr =
36π. Don’t multiply π out; problems usually leave it in that form. Next, put the degree
measure of the arc over 360. The degree measure of the arc is the same as its central
angle, 60 degrees.

tion: 36π × 1⁄6 = 6π. Correct answer: E.

K. 12
First, find the circumference of the entire circle. C = 2πr = 10π. Second, put the degree
measure of the arc over 360. Here, the inscribed angle is 6°. Because an inscribed angle
is 1⁄2 of the central angle and 1⁄2 of its intercepted arc, the arc is 12°. 12⁄360 = 1⁄30. The arc is 1⁄30 of
the circle. Finally, multiply the circumference by the fraction: 10π × 1⁄30 = 10⁄30π = 1⁄3π. The
length of the arc is  1⁄3π. Correct answer: F.
Be very careful not to confuse the degree measure of the arc with the length of the arc.
The length always is a portion of the circumference, always has a π in it and always is in
linear units. If you chose K in this example, you found the degree measure of the arc
rather than its length.

12. A sector is a portion of the area of a circle. The degree measure of a sector is the same
as its central angle and twice its inscribed angle.
To find the area of a sector, do the following:
1. Find the area of the entire circle.
2. Put the degree measure of the sector over 360 and then reduce the fraction.
3. Multiply the area by the fraction.
Finding the area of a sector is very similar to finding the length of an arc. The only dif-
ference is in the first step. Whereas an arc is a part of the circumference of a circle, a
sector is a part of the area of a circle. Try a few examples for sectors.
Find the area of sector ABC.
A. 64π
B. 36π
C. 16π
D. 12π
E. 6π
First, find the area of the entire circle. A = πr2 = 64π. Second, put the degree measure of
the sector over 360. The sector is 90°, the same as its central angle. 90⁄360 = 1⁄4. Third, multi-
ply the area by the fraction: 64π × 1⁄4 = 16π. Correct answer: C.

36°: 36⁄360 = 1⁄10. Third, multiply the area by the fraction: 81π × 1⁄10 = 8.1π. Correct answer: G.

The Powers That Be: Bases and Exponents
Many ACT questions require you to know how to work with bases and exponents. The follow-
ing sections explain some of the most important concepts.
1. The base is the big number (or letter) on the bottom. The exponent is the little number
(or letter) in the upper-right corner.
In x5, x is the base and 5 is the exponent.
In 3y, 3 is the base and y is the exponent.
2. A base to the zero power equals one.
x0 = 1
50 = 1
1290 = 1
3. The exponent tells how many times to multiply the base times itself.
This is pretty familiar stuff, right?
x2 = x × x
52 = 5 × 5
1294 =129 × 129 × 129 × 129
56 = 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5

When you take a base of ten to some power, the number of the power (or exponent) equals
the number of zeroes in the number.
101 = 10 (one zero)
104 = 10,000 (four zeroes)
100 = 1 (zero zeroes)
4. A base to a negative exponent is the reciprocal of itself.
This one is a little more confusing. A reciprocal is the upside-down version of something.
When you have a negative exponent, just put the base and exponent under a 1 and make the
exponent positive again.
x–4 = 1/(x4)
5–3 = 1/(53)
129–1 = 1/(1291)
The resulting number is not negative. When you flip it, you get the reciprocal, and the negative
just sort of fades away. Don’t fall for the trap of saying that 5–3 = –(1/5)3, or –1/125.
5. To multiply like bases, add the exponents.
You can multiply two bases that are the same; just add the exponents.
x3 × x2 = x(3 + 2) = x5
54 × 59 = 5(4 + 9) = 513
1293 × 1290 = 129(3 + 0) = 1293
You cannot multiply unlike bases. Think of it as trying to make dogs and cats multiply — it
doesn’t work. All you end up with is a miffed meower and a damaged dog.
x2 × y3 = x2 × y3 (no shortcuts)
52 × 1293 = 52 × 1293 (you actually have to work it out)
6. To divide like bases, subtract the exponents.
You can divide two bases that are the same by subtracting the exponents.
x5 ÷ x2 = x(5 – 2) = x3
59 ÷ 53 = 5(9 – 3) = 56
1294 ÷ 1290 = 129(4 – 0) = 1294
(Did I getcha on that last one? It should make sense. Any base to the 0 power is 1. Any
number divided by 1 is itself.)
Did you look at the second example, 59 ÷ 53, and think that the answer was 53? It’s easy to fall
into the trap of dividing rather than subtracting, especially when you see numbers that just
beg to be divided, like 9 and 3. Keep your guard up.
7. Multiply the exponents of a base inside and outside the parentheses.
That’s quite a mouthful. Here’s what it means:

Part IV: Don’t Count Yourself Out: The Math Review and Mini-Test 

8. To add or subtract like bases, add or subtract the numerical coefficient of the bases.
The numerical coefficient (a great name for a rock band, don’t you think?) is simply the
number in front of the base. Notice that it is not the little exponent in the right-hand corner
but the full-sized number to the left of the base.
31x3: 31 is the numerical coefficient.
–8y2:–8 is the numerical coefficient.
x3: What is the numerical coefficient? One, because any number is itself times 1; the 1 is
not always written out. Good trap.
37x3 + 10x3 = 47x3: Just add the numerical coefficients: 37 + 10 = 47.
15y2 – 10y2 = 5y2: Just subtract the numerical coefficients: 15 – 10 = 5.
You cannot add or subtract like bases with different exponents.
13x3 – 9x2 is not equal to 4x3 or 4x2 or 4x. All it is equal to is 13x3 – 9x2. The bases and
exponents must be the same for you to add or subtract the terms.
Keep It in Proportion: Ratios
After you know the tricks, ratios are some of the easiest problems to answer quickly. I call
them “heartbeat” problems because you can solve them in a heartbeat. Of course, if some-
one drop-dead gorgeous sits next to you and makes your heart beat faster, it may take you
two heartbeats to solve a ratio problem. So sue me.
1. A ratio is written as to
of or of:to.
The ratio of sunflowers to roses = 
roses
sunflowers.
The ratio of umbrellas to heads = umbrellas:heads.
2. A possible total is a multiple of the sum of the numbers in the ratio.
You may be given a problem like this: At a party, the ratio of blondes to redheads is 4:5.
Which of the following could be the total number of blondes and redheads at the party?
Megaeasy. Add the numbers in the ratio: 4 + 5 = 9. The total number of blondes must be a
multiple of 9, such as 9, 18, 27, 36, and so on.
After a rough hockey game, Bernie checks his body and finds that he has three bruises for
every five cuts. Which of the following could be the total number of bruises and cuts on poor
ol’ Bernie’s body?
A. 53
B. 45
C. 35
D. 33
E. 32
Add the numbers in the ratio: 3 + 5 = 8. The total must be a multiple of 8 (or, looking at it
another way, the total must be evenly divisible by 8). Only choice E is a multiple of 8. Correct
answer: E.
One more, because you should always get this type of problem correct.

Add the numbers in the ratio: 7 + 5 = 12. The total must be a multiple of 12 (it must be evenly
divisible by 12). Here, only 48 is evenly divisible by 12. Correct answer: H.
3. When given a ratio and a total and asked to find a specific term, do the following, in
order:
1. Add the numbers in the ratio.
2. Divide that sum into the total.
3. Multiply that quotient by each term in the ratio.
4. Add the answers to double-check that they sum to the total.
Pretty confusing stuff, right? Just take it one step at a time.
Yelling at the members of his team, which had just lost 21–0, the irate coach pointed his finger
at each member of the squad, calling everyone either a wimp or a slacker. If there were 3
wimps for every 4 slackers, and every member of the 28-person squad was either a wimp or 
a slacker, how many wimps were there?
1. Add the numbers in the ratio: 3 + 4 = 7.
2. Divide that sum into the total: 28 ÷ 7 = 4.
3. Multiply that quotient by each term in the ratio: 4 × 3 = 12; 4 × 4 = 16.
4. Double-check that the numbers add up to the total: 12 + 16 = 28.
Now you have all the information you need to answer a variety of questions: How many wimps
were there? Twelve. How many slackers were there? Sixteen. How many more slackers than
wimps were there? Four. How many slackers would have to be kicked off the team for the
number of wimps and slackers to be equal? Four. The ACT’s Math Moguls can ask all sorts of
things, but if you have this information, you’re ready for anything they throw at you.
Be sure that you actually do Step 4, adding the terms to double-check that they add up to the
total. Doing so catches any careless mistakes that you may have made.
Things Aren’t What They Seem: Symbolism
You may encounter two basic types of symbolism problems. If so, do one of the following:
 Substitute the number given for the variable in the explanation.
 Talk through the explanation to see which constraint fits and then do the indicated
operations.
102
Part IV: Don’t Count Yourself Out: The Math Review and Mini-Test 

1. Substitute for the variable in the explanation.
You see a problem with a strange symbol. It may be a variable inside a circle, a triangle, a
star, or a tic-tac-toe sign. That symbol has no connection to the real world at all. Don’t panic,
thinking that your teachers forgot to teach you something. Symbols are made up for each
problem.
The symbol is included in a short explanation. It may look like this:
a # b # c = 
#

c
d
m
n
m @ n @ o = mn + no – om
Again, the symbols don’t have any meaning in the outside world; they mean only what the
problem tells you they mean, and that meaning holds true only for this problem.
Below the explanation is the question itself:
3 # 2 # 1 =
4 * 6 * 8 =
2 @ 5 @ 10 =
Your job is one of substitution. Plug in a number for the variable in the equation. Which
number do you plug in? The one that’s in the same position as that variable. For example:
a # b # c = 
#
#
a
b
c

Because a was in the first position and 3 was in the first position, substitute 3 for a through-
out the equation. Because b was in the second position and 2 was in the second position,
substitute 2 for b throughout the equation. Because c was in the third position and 1 was in
the third position, substitute 1 for c throughout the equation.
Do the same for the other problems.
x * y * z =

4 * 6 * 8 = (8⁄4 ) + (6⁄8 )4 = 2 + 0.316 = 2.316
m @ n @ o = mn + no – om
2 @ 5 @ 10 = (2 × 5) + (5 × 10) – (10 × 2) = 10 + 50 – 20 =40
This is the simpler of the two types of symbolism problems. Just substitute the number for
the variable and work through the equation.
2. Talk through the explanation and do the operations.
This type of symbolism problem may seem more confusing until you’ve done a few. Then
they become so easy that you wonder why you didn’t see it before. Following are two 
possibilities:
103
Chapter 11: Catching Some (X’s, Y’s, and) Z’s: Algebra and Other Sleeping Aids

= 3x if x is odd
= x⁄2 if x is even
Solve for 
+ 
First, talk through the explanation. You have something in a circle. If that something in the
circle is odd, you multiply it by 3. If that something in the circle is even, you divide it by 2.
In the question, there’s a 5 in the circle. Because 5 is odd, you multiply it by 3 to get 5 × 3 = 15.
In the second half of the question, there’s an 8 in a circle. Because 8 is even, you divide it by 2.
8 ÷ 2 = 4. Now add: 15 + 4 = 19.
You still may think of this second type of problem as a plug-in or substitution problem
because you are plugging the number into the equation for x and working it through. However,
you first have to figure out which equation to plug it into. That requires talking things through.
You have to understand what you’re doing in this type of problem. Try another.
= 3x + 1⁄3x if x is prime
= x2 + 2

Aha! Now you have to know some math vocabulary. Prime numbers are not the numbers that
have stars next to them in your little black book. Prime numbers are numbers that cannot be
divided other than by 1 and themselves, such as 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. Composite numbers are
numbers that can be divided other than by just 1 and themselves, such as 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, and
12. The first thing you do is decide whether the term in the triangle is a composite number or
a prime number.
: Because 16 is a composite number, use the second equation. Square 16: 16 × 16 = 256. 
Take the square root of 16: 16 = 4. Add them together: 256 + 4 = 260.
: Because 3 is a prime number, use the first equation. 3(3) + 1⁄3(3) = 9 + 1 = 10. Add the
two solutions: 260 + 10 = 270.
Sometimes, the solutions have symbols in them as well. Here’s an example:
= 1⁄2x if x is composite
= 2x if x is prime

Because 5 is prime, you multiply it by 2: Therefore, 5 × 2 = 10. Because 10 is composite, you

Noooo! Don’t choose answer C; that’s the trap answer. Choice C doesn’t say 50; it says 
.
The 50 is in a circle. That means that you have to solve the answer choice to see what circle
50 is. Because 50 is composite, you take half of it: 50 ÷ 2 = 25. That isn’t the answer you want.
Now go through the rest of the choices:
: Because 15 is composite, multiply it by 1⁄2: 15 × 1⁄2 = 7.5.
: Because 25 is composite, multiply it by 1⁄2: 25 × 1⁄2 = 12.5.
: Because 100 is composite, multiply it by 1⁄2: 100 × 1⁄2 = 50. You have a winner! Correct 
answer: D.
Have you studied functions yet? Maybe not in school, but if you read the preceding material
on symbolism, you have studied functions. A function is very much like the symbolism you’ve
just read about. You may see a problem like this:
f(x) = (2x)3. Solve for f(2).
The f stands for function. You do the same thing you did before: Talk through the problem.
You say, “I have something in parentheses. My job is to multiply that something by 2 and
then cube the whole disgusting mess.” In other words, just plug in the 2 where you see an 
x in the explanation.
f(2) = (2 × 2)3 = 43 = 64
Try another one.
f(x) = x + x2 + x3. Solve for f(10).
Just plug the 10 in for the x: f(10) = 10 + 102 + 103 = 10 + 100 + 1,000 = 1,110.
Now that you’ve acquired this skill, you can call yourself “fully functional.”
Abracadabra: Algebra
You must be able to do three basic algebra concepts for the ACT.
Solve for x in an equation
The first concept to understand is how to solve for x in an equation. To solve for x, follow
these steps:
1. Isolate the variable, which means get all the x’s on one side and all the non-x’s on
the other side.
2. Add all the x’s on one side; add all the non-x’s on the other side.
3. Divide both sides of the equation by the number in front of the x.
Now you try it: 3x + 7 = 9x – 5.
100

105
Chapter 11: Catching Some (X’s, Y’s, and) Z’s: Algebra and Other Sleeping Aids

1. Isolate the variable. Move the 3x to the right, changing the sign to make it –3x.
Forgetting to change the sign is one of the most common careless mistakes that stu-
dents make. Test-makers realize that and often include trap answer choices to catch
this mistake.
Move the –5 to the left, changing the sign to make it +5. You now have 7 + 5 = 9x – 3x.
2. Add the x’s on one side; add the non-x’s on the other side.
12 = 6x
3. Divide both sides through by what is next to the x.
12⁄6 = 6x⁄6
2 = x
If you’re weak in algebra or know that you often make careless mistakes, plug the 2 back into
the equation to make sure that it works.
3(2) + 7 = 9(2) – 5
6 + 7 = 18 – 5
13 = 13
If you absolutely hate algebra, see whether you can simply plug in the answer choices. If this
were a problem-solving question with multiple-choice answers, you could plug ’n’ chug.
3x + 7 = 9x – 5. Solve for x.
A. 7
B. 51⁄2
C. 5
D. 31⁄2
E. 2
Don’t ask for trouble. Keep life simple by starting with the simple answers first, and begin 
in the middle, with answer C, as suggested in the lecture. That is, try plugging in 5. When it
doesn’t work, don’t bother plugging in 31⁄2. That’s too much work. Go right down to 2. If all
the easy answers don’t work, then you can go back to the hard answer of 31⁄2, but why fuss
with it unless you absolutely have to? Test-makers often put mind-boggling choices at the
beginning of the answers (or at the bottom, if you like to work upside down); skip them.
Correct answer: E.
Curses! FOILed again
The second thing you need to know to do algebra is how to use the FOIL method. FOIL stands
for First, Outer, Inner, Last and refers to the order in which you multiply the variables in paren-
theses. You can practice by using this equation: (a + b)(a – b) =
1. Multiply the First variables: a × a = a2.
2. Multiply the Outer variables: a × –b = –ab.
3. Multiply the Inner variables: b × a = ba (which is the same as ab).
4. Multiply the Last variables: b × –b = –b2.
106
Part IV: Don’t Count Yourself Out: The Math Review and Mini-Test 

Add like terms: –ab + ab = 0ab. (Remember that you can multiply numbers forward or back-
ward, such that ab = ba.) The positive and negative ab cancel each other out. You’re left with
only a2 – b2.
Try another one: (3a + b)(a – 2b) =
1. Multiply the First terms: 3a × a = 3a2.
2. Multiply the Outer terms: 3a × –2b = –6ab.
3. Multiply the Inner terms: b × a = ba (which is the same as ab).
4. Multiply the Last terms: b × –2b = –2b2.
5. Combine like terms: –6ab + ab = –5ab.
The final answer is 3a2 – 5ab – 2b2.
You need to out-and-out memorize the following three FOIL problems. Don’t bother to work
them out every time; know them by heart.
(a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
You can prove this equation by using FOIL: (a + b)(a + b)
1. Multiply the First terms: a × a = a2.
2. Multiply the Outer terms: a × b = ab.
3. Multiply the Inner terms: b × a = ba (which is the same as ab).
4. Multiply the Last terms: b × b = b2.
5. Combine like terms: ab + ab = 2ab.
The final solution is a2 + 2ab + b2.
(a – b)2 = a2 – 2ab + b2
You can prove this equation by using FOIL: (a – b)(a – b)
1. Multiply the First terms: a × a = a2.
2. Multiply the Outer terms: a × –b = –ab.
3. Multiply the Inner terms: –b × a = –ba (which is the same as –ab).
4. Multiply the Last terms: –b × –b = +b2.
5. Combine like terms: –ab + –ab = –2ab.
The final solution is a2 – 2ab + b2.
Be careful to note that the b2 at the end is positive, not negative, because multiplying a nega-
tive times a negative gives a positive.
(a – b)(a + b) = a2 – b2
You can prove this equation by using FOIL: (a – b)(a + b)
1. Multiply the First terms: a × a = a2.
2. Multiply the Outer terms: a × b = ab.
107
Chapter 11: Catching Some (X’s, Y’s, and) Z’s: Algebra and Other Sleeping Aids

3. Multiply the Inner terms: –b × a = –ba (which is the same as –ab).
4. Multiply the Last terms: –b × b = –b2.
5. Combine like terms: ab + –ab = 0ab.
The final solution is a2 – b2. Note that the middle term drops out because +ab cancels out –ab.
Again, memorize these three equations:
(a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
(a – b)2 = a2 – 2ab + b2
(a – b)(a + b) = a2 – b2
Doing so saves you time, careless mistakes, and acute misery on the actual exam.
Fact-or Fiction: Factoring
Now you know how to do algebra forward; are you ready to do it backward? You need to be
able to factor down a quadratic equation (an equation with a variable to the second power)
and take an algebraic expression from its final form back to its original form of two sets of
parentheses.
Given x2 + 13x + 42 = 0, solve for x. Take this problem one step at a time.
1. Draw two sets of parentheses.
( )( ) = 0
2. You know that to get x2, the First terms have to be x and x. Fill those in.
(x )(x ) = 0
3. Look now at the Outer terms.
You need two numbers that multiply together to be +42. Well, there are several possi-
bilities: 42 × 1, 21 × 2, or 6 × 7. You can even have two negative numbers: –42 × –1, 
–21 × –2, or –6 × –7. You aren’t sure which numbers to choose yet. Go on to the next
step.
4. Look at the Inner terms.
You have to add two values to get +13. What’s the first thing that springs to mind? 6 + 7,
probably. Hey, that’s one of the possibilities in the preceding step! Plug it in and try it.
(x + 6)(x + 7) = x2 + 7x + 6x + 42 = x2 + 13x + 42
5. Great, but you’re not done yet. If the whole equation equals 0, then either (x + 6) = 0
or (x + 7) = 0.
That’s because any number times 0 equals 0. Therefore, x can equal –6 or –7.
Too Hip to Be Square: Roots and Radicals
To simplify working with square roots (or cube roots or any roots), think of them as vari-
ables. You work the same way with 7 as you do with x, y, or z.
108
Part IV: Don’t Count Yourself Out: The Math Review and Mini-Test 

Addition and subtraction
1. To add or subtract like radicals (for the purpose of this exam, think of “radicals” as
“roots”), add or subtract the number in front of the radical.
2 7 + 5 7 = 7 7
2x + 5x = 7x
9 13 – 4 13 = 5 13
9x – 4x = 5x
2. You cannot add or subtract unlike radicals (just as you cannot add or subtract unlike
variables).
6 5 + 4 3 = 6 5 + 4 3. You cannot add the two and get 10 8.
6x + 4y = 6x + 4y. You cannot add the two and get 10xy.
Don’t glance at a problem, see that the radicals are not the same, and immediately assume
that you cannot add the two terms. You may be able to simplify one radical to make it match
the radical in the other term.
52 + 13 = 2 13 + 13 = 3 13
1. Begin by simplifying. Take out a perfect square from the term.
52 = 4 ×
13
2. Because 4 = 2, then 52 = 2 13.
Look at this one:
20 + 45 = ( 4 ×
5) + ( 9 ×
5) = 2 5 + 3 5 = 5 5
You must simplify first. You can’t say that 20 + 45 = 65 = 8.06. When you work out the
correct answer, 5 5, you see that it isn’t 8.06 but rather 11.18.
Multiplication and division
Just do it. When you multiply or divide radicals, you just multiply or divide the numbers and
then pop the radical sign back onto the finished product.
5 ×
6 = 30
15 ÷
5 = 3
If you have a number in front of the radical, multiply it as well. Let everyone in on the fun.
6 3 × 4 2 =
6 × 4 = 24
3 ×
2 = 6
24 6

Chapter 11: Catching Some (X’s, Y’s, and) Z’s: Algebra and Other Sleeping Aids

This problem takes straightforward multiplication: 37 × 3 = 111 and 5 ×
6 = 30, so 
111 30. Correct answer: J.
Inside out
When there is an operation under the radical, do it first and then take the square root.
x

40
9

First, solve for x2/40 + x2/9. You get the common denominator of 360 (40 × 9) and then find 
the numerators: 9x2 + 40x2 = 49x2/360. Now take the square roots: 
x
49
2 = 7x (because 
7x × 7x = 49x2). 360 = 18.97. Gotcha, I bet! Did you say that 360 = 6? Wrong! 36 = 6, but 
360 = approximately 18.97. Beware of assuming too much; you can be led down the path
to temptation.
Your final answer is 7x/18.97. Of course, you can bet that the answer choices will include 7x/6.
Probably Probability
Probability questions usually are word problems. They may look intimidating, with so many
words that make you lose sight of where to begin. Two simple rules can solve nearly every
probability problem that the ACT tosses at you.
Rule 1: Create a fraction
To find a probability, use this formula:
P
Number of total possible outcomes
Number of possible desired outcomes
=
Make a probability into a fraction. The denominator is the easier of the two parts to begin
with. The denominator is the total possible number of outcomes. For example, when you’re
flipping a coin, there are two possible outcomes, giving you a denominator of 2. When you’re
tossing a die (one of a pair of dice), there are six possible outcomes, giving you a denomina-
tor of 6. When you’re pulling a card out of a deck of cards, there are 52 possible outcomes 
(52 cards in a deck), giving you a denominator of 52. When 25 marbles are in a jar and you’re
going to pull out one of them, there are 25 possibilities, giving you a denominator of 25. Very
simply, the denominator is the whole shebang — everything possible.
The numerator is the total number of the things you want. If you want a head when you toss a
coin, there is exactly one head, giving you a numerator of 1. Your chances of tossing a head,
therefore, are 1⁄2, one possible head, two possible outcomes altogether. If you want to get a 5
when you toss a die, there is exactly one 5 on the die, giving you a numerator of 1. The prob-
ability of tossing a 5 is 1⁄6. There are one 5 and six possible outcomes altogether.
If you want to draw a jack from a deck of cards, there are four jacks: hearts, diamonds, clubs,
and spades. Therefore, the numerator is 4. The probability of drawing a jack out of a deck of
cards is 4⁄52 (which reduces to 1⁄13). If you want to draw a jack of hearts, the probability is 1⁄52
because there is only one jack of hearts.
110
Part IV: Don’t Count Yourself Out: The Math Review and Mini-Test 

A jar of marbles has 8 yellow marbles, 6 black marbles, and 12 white marbles. What is the
probability of drawing out a black marble?
Use the formula. Begin with the denominator, which is all the possible outcomes: 8 + 6 + 12 =
26. The numerator is how many there are of what you want: six black marbles. The probabil-
ity is 6⁄26, which can be reduced or (as is more customary) changed to a percentage. The cor-
rect answer is 6⁄26, or  3⁄13, or 23 percent. What’s the probability of drawing out a yellow marble?
8⁄26, or 4⁄13. A white marble? 12⁄26, or 6⁄13.
A drawer contains 5 pairs of white socks, 8 pairs of black socks, and 12 pairs of brown socks.
In a hurry to get to school, Austin pulls out a pair at a time and tosses them on the floor if
they are not the color he wants. Looking for a brown pair, Austin pulls out and discards a
white pair, a black pair, a black pair, and a white pair. What is the probability that on his next
reach into the drawer he will pull out a brown pair of socks?
This problem is slightly more complicated than the preceding one, although it uses the same
formula. You began with 25 pairs of socks. However, Austin, that slob, has thrown four pairs
on the floor. That means only 21 pairs are left. The probability of his pulling out a brown pair
is 12⁄21, or 4⁄7, or about 57 percent.
A cookie jar contains chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry wafer cookies. There are 30 of each
type. Bess reaches in, pulls out a chocolate and eats it, and then in quick succession, she pulls
out and eats a vanilla, a chocolate, a strawberry, a strawberry, a chocolate, and a vanilla.
Assuming that she doesn’t get sick or get caught, what is the probability that the next cookie
she pulls out will be a chocolate one?
Originally, there were 90 cookies. Bess has scarfed down 7 of them, leaving 83. Careful! If
you’re about to put 30⁄83, you’re headed for a trap. There are no longer 30 chocolate cookies;
there are only 27, because Bess has eaten 3. The probability is now 27⁄83, or about 33 percent.
Probability must always be between 0 and 1. You cannot have a negative probability, and you
cannot have a probability greater than 1, or 100 percent.
Rule 2: Multiply consecutive probabilities
What is the probability that you’ll get two heads when you toss a coin twice? You find each
probability separately and then multiply the two. The chance of tossing a coin the first time
and getting a head is 1⁄2. The chance of tossing a coin the second time and getting a head is 
1⁄2. Multiply those consecutive probabilities: 1⁄2 × 1⁄2 = 1⁄4. The chance of getting two heads is 1
out of 4.
What is the probability of tossing a die twice and getting a 5 on the first toss and a 6 on the
second toss? Treat each toss separately. The probability of getting a 5 is 1⁄6. The probability of
getting a 6 is 1⁄6. Multiply consecutive probabilities: 1⁄6 × 1⁄6 = 1⁄36.
The Stats Don’t Lie: Statistics
Don’t panic; the ACT tests your skill with statistics in only the most rudimentary way. If you
can master three basic concepts, you can do any statistics on this exam. Those concepts are
median, mode, and range.
111
Chapter 11: Catching Some (X’s, Y’s, and) Z’s: Algebra and Other Sleeping Aids

Median
Simply put, the median is the middle number when all the terms are arranged in order. Think
of the median strip, which is the middle of the road. Median = middle. Be sure that you
arrange the numbers in order (increasing or decreasing, it makes no difference) before you
find the median.
Find the median of –3, 18, –4, 1⁄2, 11.
A. –3
B. 18
C. –4
D.
1⁄2
E. 11
Put the numbers in order: –4, –3, 1⁄2, 11, 18. The one in the middle, 1⁄2, is the median. It’s as
simple as that. Correct answer: D.
Mode
The mode is the most frequent number. I suggest that you put the numbers in order again.
Then look for the one that shows up the most often. It’s the mode.
Find the mode of 11, 18, 29, 17, 18, –4, 0, 11, 18.
F. 11
G. 17
H. 18
J. 19
K. 29
The question has three 18s but no more than two of any other number. Correct answer: H.
Range
The range is the distance from the greatest to the smallest. In other words, you subtract the
smallest term from the largest term, and you have the range.
Find the range of the numbers 11, 18, 29, 17, 18, –4, 0, 11, 18.
A. 33
B. 29
C. 19
D. 0
E. –4
Ah, did this one getcha? True, 33 is not one of the numbers in the set. But to find the range,
subtract the smallest from the largest number: 29 – (–4) = 29 + 4 = 33. Correct answer: A.
112
Part IV: Don’t Count Yourself Out: The Math Review and Mini-Test 

The only trap you’re likely to see in the statistics questions is in the answer choices. The
questions themselves are quite straightforward, but the answer choices may assume that
some people don’t know one term from another. For example, one answer choice to a
median question may be the mean (the average). One answer choice to a range question
may be the mode. In each question, circle the word that tells you what you’re looking for to
keep from falling for this trap.
Don’t Soak Your Head: SOH CAH TOA
You can go a long way in trigonometry with just a few basic points. Just remember SOH 
CAH TOA.
SOH CAH TOA stands for
Sine = Opposite/Hypotenuse
Cosine = Adjacent/Hypotenuse
Tangent = Opposite/Adjacent
Are you scratching your head now and saying, “Opposite? Opposite what?” Take a look at the
following right triangle:
1. Side AB is the hypotenuse.
It is the longest side of the right triangle, and the side opposite the right angle.
2. To find sin A (sine usually is abbreviated as sin; the terms mean the same thing), all you
need to do is find the length of side BC and divide it by the length of the hypotenuse.
This is because sin A = hypotenuse
opposite A and side BC is the side opposite A. Therefore, sin A = 
length of AB
length of BC .

Trig-o-trivia: A few soothing words
Don’t know a sine from a sign? Don’t worry about it. The
ACT has only four trigonometry questions. If you guess
wildly at all four, you’ll probably get at least one correct.
(You should always guess, because the ACT has no
penalty for wrong answers.) And that means that a total
lack of trig is likely to cost you only three questions, which
translates to only one or two points on the mathematics
scale and half a point or less on the composite score
scale. In other words, you still can get a great ACT score,
get into a good college, have an excellent career, win a
Nobel prize or two, marry a movie star, and rear children
who find the cure for cancer, all without knowing the first
thing about trigonometry. Feel better now?

3. To find cos A (cosine usually is abbreviated as cos; the terms mean the same thing), find
the length of side AC and use the CAH part of SOH CAH TOA.
Cos A = hypotenuse
adjacent A , which in turn equals length of AB
length of BC .
4. To find tan A (yes, tangent usually is abbreviated as tan; they mean the same thing), use
the TOA part of SOH CAH TOA:
Tan A = adjacent A
opposite A , which in turn is equal length of AC
length of BC .
Here’s an example of just how far you can go when you SOH CAH TOA. What is sin A if 
tan A = 40
9 ?
F. 41

G. 41

H. 40

J.

40
K.
9
41
Because tan A = 40
9 , you can draw a picture with opposite A = 9 and adjacent A = 40.
Use the Pythagorean Theorem to determine the length of hypotenuse AB:
92 + 402 = (AB)2
1681 = (AB)2
41 = AB
Sin A = hypotenuse
opposite A , so sin A= 41
9 .
You could have eliminated choices H, J, and K immediately if you realized that the sin cannot
be greater than 1. Correct answer: F.
5. Sin= hypotenuse
opposite . No side in a triangle can be greater than the hypotenuse, so that 
makes it impossible to have a sin greater than 1.
6. Cos= hypotenuse
adjacent . The side adjacent cannot be greater than the hypotenuse, so cos 
cannot be greater than 1.

Part IV: Don’t Count Yourself Out: The Math Review and Mini-Test 

That’s so important that I’m repeating it here as a tip for you to burn into your brain:
Neither a sin nor a cos can be greater than 1.
Making things a little more interesting, what if you were asked for secant A (also called sec A),
cosecant A (also called csc A), or cotangent A (known to his friends as cot A) in the preced-
ing example? Just remember the following:
secA= cosA
1
cscA= sinA
1
cotA= tanA
1
So if cosA = 41
40, then secA = 40
41 or if sinA = 41
9 . then cscA = 9
41.
How to Use All This Junk: Trigonometric 
Ratios of Angles
You can combine SOH CAH TOA with some basic geometry knowledge to figure out the
trigonometric ratios of some key angles.
What is cos 30°? (Note: On the real exam, you have multiple-choice answers. Here, I’m going
to let you figure this out from scratch.)
Draw a 30:60:90 triangle. (Remember that the ratio is s:s 3: 2s. I discuss this ratio in detail in
the triangles section of Chapter 7.)
cos 30° = hypotenuse
adjacent 30c , which equals 2
3 .
What is tan 45°? (Again, remember the actual ACT has multiple-choice answer responses, but
I want you to do this one all on your own.)
Draw a 45:45:90 triangle. Remember, the ratio of the sides of this triangle is s:s:s 2, where s
stands for the length of the side. (I discuss this ratio in the triangles portion of Chapter 7.)

Chapter 11: Catching Some (X’s, Y’s, and) Z’s: Algebra and Other Sleeping Aids

The ACT doesn’t usually accept a square root in the denominator, so you have to rationalize
your answer. (“To rationalize your answer” doesn’t mean to justify to the teacher how on
earth you came up with that answer, but rather to get rid of the root in the denominator.) Do
so by multiplying both top and bottom by the square root:

No Nervous Breakdowns, Please
Let us end this section on trig the way we began it, with a few words of reassurance. With a
little practice, you should be able to handle just about anything the ACT test-makers throw 
at you regarding the preceding material. (And remember, the answer explanations to the trig
problems in the practice exams repeat all this info and take you through everything step by
step.) If you’re still confused after those exams or you’re concerned about some of the more
advanced trigonometry that has only a very slight chance of appearing on the test, don’t
worry. Keep chanting to yourself, “Only four, no more; only four, no more.” The entire ACT
has only four trig problems. Trigonometry won’t make or break your ACT score.

ven though you may already know most or all of the math discussed in this chapter, it
never hurts to refresh your memory. These questions tend to be the easiest, so they
offer you the best chance for getting correct answers. Brush up on your miscellaneous
math, and you’re sure to improve your score on the math section of the ACT.
DIRTy Math: Time, Rate, and Distance
Let’s dish the dirt here, okay? D.I.R.T. Distance Is Rate × Time. D = RT. When you have a time,
rate, and distance problem, use this formula. Make a chart with the formula across the top
and fill in the spaces on the chart.
Jennifer drives 40 mph for 21⁄2 hours. Her friend Ashley goes the same distance but drives at
11⁄2 times Jennifer’s speed. How many minutes longer does Jennifer drive than Ashley?
Do not start making big, hairy formulas with x’s and y’s. Make the DIRT chart.

Time

40 mph
21⁄2 hours
Ashley

100 minutes
When you fill in the 40 mph and 21⁄2 hours for Jennifer, you can calculate that she went 100
miles. Because Ashley drives the same distance, fill in 100 under distance for her. She goes 
11⁄2 times as fast. Ashley drives 60 mph. Now this gets really easy. If she drives at 60 mph, 
she drives one mile a minute. (60 minutes in an hour, 60 miles in an hour. You figure it out,
Einstein.) Therefore, to go 100 miles takes her 100 minutes. Because the question asks for
your final answer in minutes, don’t bother converting this to hours; leave it the way it is.

Last step. Jennifer drives 21⁄2 hours. How many minutes is that? Do it the easy way, in your
brain. One hour is 60 minutes. A second hour is another 60 minutes. A half hour is 30 min-
utes. Add them together: 60 + 60 + 30 = 150 minutes. If Jennifer drives for 150 minutes and
Ashley drives for 100 minutes, Jennifer drives 50 minutes more than Ashley.
Be careful to note whether the people are traveling in the same direction or in opposite direc-
tions. Suppose that you’re asked how far apart drivers are at the end of their trip. If you’re
told that Jordan travels 40 mph east for 2 hours and Connor travels 60 mph west for 3 hours,
they are going in opposite directions. If they start from the same point at the same time,
Jordan has gone 80 miles one way, and Connor has gone 180 miles the opposite way. They
are 260 miles apart. The trap answer is 100, because careless people (not you!) simply sub-
tract 180 – 80.
It All Averages Out: Averages
You can always do averages the way Ms. Jones taught you when you were in third grade: Add
all the terms and then divide by the number of terms. Or you can save wear-and-tear on the
brain cells and know the following rules:
1. The average of evenly spaced terms is the middle term.
5 + 11 + 17 + 23 + 29 = 85
85⁄5 = 17
First, check that the terms are evenly spaced. That means that there is an equal number of
units between each term. Here, the terms are six apart. Second, circle the middle term, which
here is 17. Third, go home, make popcorn, and watch the late-night movie with all the time
you’ve saved.
Try another one. Find the average of 32, 41, 50, 59, 68, 77, 86, 95, and 104.
You look and see that the terms are all nine units apart. Because they are evenly spaced, the
middle term is the average: 68.
This trick is an easy one to love, but don’t march down the aisle with it yet. The tip works
only for evenly spaced terms. If you have just any old batch of numbers, such as 4, 21, 97, 98,
and 199, you can’t look at the middle term for the average. You have to find the average of
those numbers the old-fashioned way.
Find the average of these numbers: 3, 10, 17, 24, 31, 38, 45, and 52.
First, double-check that they are evenly spaced. Here, the numbers are spaced by sevens.
Next you look for the middle number . . . and there isn’t one. You can, of course, find the two
central terms, 24 and 31, and then find the middle between them. That works, but what a
pain. Not only that, but suppose that you have 38 numbers. Making a mistake as to which
term is the central one is easy to do. If you’re off just a little bit, you miss the question.
Instead, use rule number two.
2. The average of evenly spaced terms is (first + last)/2.
Just add the first and the last terms, which are obvious at a glance, and divide that sum by 2.
3 + 52 = 55
55⁄2 = 27.5
118
Part IV: Don’t Count Yourself Out: The Math Review and Mini-Test 

Note: Double-check by using your common sense. Suppose that you made a silly mistake and
got 45 for your answer. A glance at the numbers tells you that 45 is not in the middle and
therefore cannot be the average.
This tip works for all evenly spaced terms. It doesn’t matter whether there is a middle
number, as in the first example, or no middle number, as in the second example. Go back 
to the earlier example.
32, 41, 50, 59, 68, 77, 86, 95, 104
Instead of finding the middle term, add the first and last terms and divide by 2, like this:
32 + 104 = 136
136⁄2 = 68
Either way works.
Missing term average problem
You are likely to find a problem like this:
Jeanette takes seven exams. Her scores on the first six are 91, 89, 85, 92, 90, and 88. If her
average on all seven exams is 90, what did she get on the seventh exam?
This problem is called a missing term average problem because you are given an average and
asked to find a missing term. Duh.
1. You can do this the basic algebraic way: Average = Sum/Number of terms
90 = Sum/7
Because you don’t know the seventh term, call it x. Add the first six terms (and get 535) and x.
90 = (535 + x)/7
Cross-multiply: 90 × 7 = 535 + x
630 = 535 + x
95 = x
The seventh exam score was 95.
Weighted averages
In a weighted average, some scores count more than others.

Chapter 12: Reviewing Miscellaneous Math You Probably Already Know

If you’re asked to find the average score for the students in this class, you know that you
cannot simply add 80, 75, and 70 and divide by 3, because the scores weren’t evenly distrib-
uted among the students. Because 12 students got an 80, multiply 12 × 80 = 960. Do the same
with the other scores:
13 × 75 = 975
10 × 70 = 700
960 + 975 + 700 = 2635
Divide not by 3 but by the total number of students: 35 (12 + 13 + 10)
2635⁄35 = 75.29
Percentage Panic
The mere mention of the word percentage may strike terror in your heart. There’s no reason
to panic over percentages; there are ways of getting around them.
1. The first way is to ignore their very existence. You can express a percentage as a decimal,
which is a lot less intimidating. You do so by putting a decimal point two places to the left of
the percentage and dropping the percent sign.
 35% = .35
 83% = .83
 50% = .50
 33.3% = .333
 66.6% = .666
If you have a choice of working with percentages or decimals, it’s better to choose decimals
(in my humble opinion).
2. Another way to ignore a percentage is to convert it to a fraction. The word percent means
per cent, or per hundred. Every percentage is that number over 100.
 50% = 50⁄100
 33% = 33⁄100
 75% = 75⁄100
If you can’t ignore the percentage, remember that a percent is part⁄whole × 100, or is⁄of × 100.
What percent of 90 is 45? Put the part, 45, over the whole, 90. Or put the is, 45, over the of, 90:
45⁄90 = 1⁄2 × 100 = 100⁄2 = 50%
42 is what percent of 126? Put the part, 42, over the whole, 126. Or put the is, 42, over the 
of, 126.
42⁄126 = 1⁄3 × 100 = 100⁄3 = 331⁄3%
Here’s a slightly harder one: What is 40% of 80? You may be tempted to put the is, 40, over
the of, 80, and get 40⁄80 = 1⁄2 × 100 = 100⁄2 = 50%. However, when the problem is worded this way
(“what is x% of y?” rather than “what % is x of y?”), you don’t know the is. Your equation must
be: x⁄80 = 40⁄100. Cross-multiply: 3200 = 100x. x = 32. There’s an easier way to do it: of means times,
or multiply. Because 40% = .40, multiply that by 80 to get 32.

Part IV: Don’t Count Yourself Out: The Math Review and Mini-Test 

You may see a problem asking you what percent increase or decrease occurred in the
number of games a team won or the amount of commission a person earned. To find a per-
cent increase or decrease, use this formula:
percent increase or decrease = 
original whole
number increase or decrease
In basic English, to find the percent by which something has increased or decreased, you
take two simple steps:
1. Find the number (amount) by which the thing has increased or decreased.
For example, if a team won 25 games last year and 30 games this year, the number
increase was 5. If a salesperson earned $10,000 last year and $8,000 this year, the
number decrease was $2,000. Make that the numerator (top or left) of the fraction.
2. Find the original whole.
This figure is what you started out with before you increased or decreased. If a team
won 25 games last year and won 30 games this year, the original number was 25. If the
salesperson earned $10,000 last year and $8,000 this year, the original number was
10,000. Make the number you started out with the denominator (bottom or right).
You now have a fraction. Divide the fraction to convert to a decimal and multiply by 100 to
make it a percentage.
In 1992, Coach Denges won 30 prizes at the county fair by tossing a basketball into a bushel
basket. In 1993, he won 35 prizes. What was his percent increase?
A. 100
B. 30
C. 162⁄3
D. 14.28
E. .166
The number by which his prizes increased, from 30 to 35, is 5. That is the numerator. The
original whole, or what he began with, is 30. That is the denominator. 5⁄30 = 1⁄6 = 162⁄3%. Correct
answer: C.
If you chose E, I fooled you. The question asks what percent increase there was. If you say E,
you’re saying that the increase was .166%. Not so. The increase as a percentage is 162⁄3%. If you
chose D, you fell for another trap. You put the 5 increase over the 35 instead of over the 30.
Two years ago, Haylie scored 22 goals at soccer. This year, she scored 16 goals. What was her
approximate percentage decrease?
F. 72
G. 37.5
H. 27
J. 16
K. .27
Find the number of the decrease: 22 – 16 = 6. That is the numerator. Find the original whole
from which she is decreasing: 22. That is the denominator. 6⁄22 = approximately .27, or approxi-
mately 27 percent. Correct answer: H.
121
Chapter 12: Reviewing Miscellaneous Math You Probably Already Know

If you chose F, you put 16 over 22 instead of putting the decrease over the original whole. If
you chose K, you forgot the difference between .27 and .27 percent. If you chose G, you put
the decrease of 6 over the new amount, 16, rather than over the original whole. Note how
easy these traps are to fall for. My suggestion: Write down the actual formula and then plug in
the numbers. Writing down the formula may be boring, but doing so takes only a few seconds
and may save you points.
Here’s a tricky question that many people do in their heads (instead of writing down the for-
mula and plugging in numbers) and blow big-time. Carissa has three quarters. Her father
gives her three more. Carissa’s wealth has increased by what percent?
A. 50
B. 100
C. 200
D. 300
E. 500
Did you fall for the trap answer, C? Her wealth has doubled, to be sure, but the percent
increase is only 100. You can prove that with the formula: The number increase is 75 (she has
three more quarters, or 75 cents). Her original whole was 75. 75⁄75 = 1 = 100%. Correct answer: B.
Do not fall into the trap of assuming that a 200 percent increase means that something dou-
bled. When you double something, you increase it by 100 percent because you have to sub-
tract the original “one” you began with. When you triple something, you increase by 200
percent because you have to subtract the original you began with. If you had three dollars
and you now have nine dollars, for example, you have tripled your money but increased it
by only 200 percent. Do the formula:
number increase = 6 dollars
original whole = 3 dollars
6⁄3 = 2 = 200 percent
Take a wild guess at what percent you increase when you quadruple your money? That’s
right, 300 percent. Just subtract the original 100 percent.
Ready, Sets, Go: Number Sets
How can you solve a problem that asks you to “state your answer in integral values only” if
you don’t know what integral values are? Here are the number sets with which you’ll be work-
ing. (I once got a call from a very irate parent, who misunderstood her child to say that I was
teaching “number sex.” Life as an ACT tutor is never dull.)
 Counting numbers: 1, 2, 3 . . . Note that 0 is not a counting number.
 Whole numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3 . . . Note that 0 is a whole number.
 Integers: . . . –3, –2, –1, 0, 1, 2, 3 . . . When a question asks for integral values, make sure
that the answer is in integers only. For example, you can’t give an answer like 4.3
because that’s not an integer. You need to round down to 4.
 Rational numbers: Rational numbers can be expressed as a/b, where a and b are 
integers.
Examples: 1 (because 1 = 1⁄1 and 1 is an integer), 1⁄2 (because 1 and 2 are integers), 9⁄2
(because 9 and 2 are integers), and –4⁄2 (because –4 and 2 are integers).
122
Part IV: Don’t Count Yourself Out: The Math Review and Mini-Test 

Notice that every number set so far has included the previous number sets. Whole num-
bers include counting numbers, integers include counting numbers and whole numbers,
and rational numbers include counting numbers, whole numbers, and integers.
 Irrational numbers: The highly technical definition here is “anything not rational.”
That is, an irrational number cannot be written as a/b, where a and b are integers.
Numbers that do not terminate and do not repeat cannot be written as fractions and
therefore are irrational.
Examples: π cannot be written exactly as 3.14; it is nonterminating and nonrepeating. 
2 is approximately 1.4142 but is nonterminating and nonrepeating.
Irrational numbers do not include the previous numbers sets. That is, irrational num-
bers don’t include counting numbers, whole numbers, integers, and rational numbers.
 Real numbers: Briefly put, all of the above. Real numbers include counting numbers,
whole numbers, integers, rationals, and irrationals. For all practical purposes, real
numbers are everything you think of as numbers. When a question tells you to
“express your answer in real numbers,” don’t sweat it. That’s almost no constraint at
all, because nearly every number you see is a real number.
Prime and Composite Numbers
1. Prime numbers have exactly two factors; they cannot be divided by numbers other than
1 and themselves. Examples include 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.
There are a few lovely tricks to prime numbers:
 Zero is not a prime number. Why? Because it is divisible by more than two factors. Zero
can be divided by 1, 2, 3, and on to infinity. Although division by zero is undefined (and
isn’t tested on the ACT), you can divide zero by other numbers; the answer, of course,
is always zero. 0 ÷ 1 = 0; 0 ÷ 2 = 0; 0 ÷ 412 = 0.
 One is not a prime number. There are not two factors of 1. It cannot be divided only by
1 and itself. Confused? Don’t worry about it. Just memorize that 1 is not a prime
number.
 Two is the only even prime. People tend to think that all prime numbers are odd. Well,
almost. Two is prime because it has only two factors; it can be divided only by 1 and
itself.
 Not all odd numbers are prime. Think of 9 or 15; those numbers are odd but not prime,
because they have more than two factors and can be divided by more than just 1 and
themselves. 9 = (1 × 9) and (3 × 3). 15 = (1 × 15) and (3 × 5).
2. Composite numbers have more than two factors and can be divided by more than just 1
and themselves. Examples include 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 14, and 15.
Note that composite numbers (called that because they are composed of more than two fac-
tors) can be even or odd.

Chapter 12: Reviewing Miscellaneous Math You Probably Already Know

Don’t confuse even and odd with prime and composite. That’s an easy mistake to make in the
confusion of the exam. If a problem that you know should be easy is flustering you, stop and
ask yourself whether you’re making this common mistake.
I said that 0 and 1 are not prime. They are also not composite. What are they? Neither. You
express this as, “0 and 1 are neither prime nor composite.”
I’m All Mixed Up: Mixture Problems
A mixture problem is a word problem that looks much more confusing than it actually is.
There are two types of mixtures: those in which the items remain separate (when you mix
peanuts and raisins, you still have peanuts and raisins, not pearains or raispeans) and those
in which the two elements blend (these are usually chemicals, like water and alcohol). Check
out the separate mixture type first.
Marshall wants to mix 40 pounds of beads selling for 30 cents a pound with a quantity 
of sequins selling for 80 cents a pound. He wants to pay 40 cents per pound for the final
mix. How many pounds of sequins should he use?
The hardest part for most students is knowing where to begin. Make a chart.
Pounds
Price
Total
Beads
40
.30
$12.00
Sequins
x
.80
.80x
Mixture
40 + x
.40
.40 (40 + x)
Reason it out. The cost of the beads (1200) plus the cost of the sequins (80x) must equal the
cost of the mixture (1600 + 40x). Note that you dump the decimal point (officially, you multi-
ply by 100 to get rid of the decimal point, but really you dump it). Now you have a workable
equation:
1200 + 80x = 1600 + 40x
80x – 40x = 1600 – 1200
40x = 400
x = 10
Careful! Keep in mind what x stands for. It represents the number of pounds of sequins, what
the question asks for.
Go back and double-check by plugging this value into the equation. With a multiple-choice
question, it may be easier to plug in the answer choices and work backward through the
problem. Don’t forget that you have that option.
Greed Is Great: Interest Problems
A problem usually asks you how much interest someone earned on an investment. This prob-
lem is pretty: PRTI, to be exact.
 P = Principal, the amount of money you begin with, or the amount you invest
 R = Rate, the interest rate you’re earning on the money (stated as a decimal)
124
Part IV: Don’t Count Yourself Out: The Math Review and Mini-Test 

 T = Time, the amount of time you leave the money in the interest-bearing account
 I = Interest, the amount of interest you earn on the investment
The formula is PRT = I, or Principal × Rate × Time = Interest
Janet invested $1,000 at 5 percent annual interest for one year. How much interest did
she earn?
This is the simplest type of problem. Plug the numbers into the formula.
PRT = I
1000 × .05 × 1 = 50. She earned $50 interest.
The answer choices may try to trap you with variations on a decimal place, making the
answers 5, 50, 500, and so on. You know that 5% = 5⁄100 = .05; be careful how you multiply.
These problems are not intentionally vicious. You won’t see something that gets crazy on
interest rates, like “5 percent annual interest compounded quarterly for 3 months and 6 per-
cent quarterly interest compounded daily,” blah, blah, blah.
(Useless but fascinating trivia I learned on a trip a few years ago: In Bulgarian, the word for
thank you is pronounced blah-go-dah-ree-uh. But a shortened form, like thanks, is simply blah.
If your mother takes you to task for being a smart aleck and going “blah, blah, blah” when
she talks, you can innocently claim that you’re practicing your Bulgarian and you’re just
thanking her for her wisdom.)
All Work and No Play: Work Problems
The formula most commonly used in a work problem is
Capacity or time to do the whole job
Time put in
_
i
Find each person’s contribution. The denominator is the easy part; it represents how many
hours (minutes, days, weeks, and so on) it takes the person to do the whole job, working
alone. The numerator is how long the person already has worked. For example, if Janie can
paint a house in six days and has been working for one day, she has done 1⁄6 of the work. If
Evelyn can paint a house in eight days and has been working for five, she has done 5⁄8 of the
project.
So far, so good. The problem comes when more than one person works at a task. What hap-
pens when Janie and Evelyn work together? Janie working alone can paint a house in six
days. Evelyn working alone can paint it in eight days. Working together, how long will it take
them to paint the house?
Find Janie’s capacity: x/6. Find Evelyn’s capacity: x/8. Together, the two fractions must add
up to 1, the entire job.
x/6 + x/8 = 1
Multiply by the common denominator, 48, to eliminate the fractions:
48x/6 + 48x/8 = 48
8x + 6x = 48
14x = 48
125
Chapter 12: Reviewing Miscellaneous Math You Probably Already Know

x = approximately 3.43. It would take the two women working together about 3.43 days to
paint the house.
Double-check by using your common sense. If you get an answer of 10, for example, you know
that you must have made a mistake, because the two women working together should be
able to do the job more quickly than either one working alone.
Smooth Operator: Order of Operations
When you have several operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squaring,
and so on) in one problem, you must perform the operations in a definite order:
1. Parentheses.
Do what’s inside the parentheses first.
2. Power.
Do the squaring or the cubing, whatever the exponent is.
3. Multiply or divide.
Do multiplication and division left to right. If multiplication is to the left of division,
multiply first. If division is to the left of multiplication, divide first.
4. Add or subtract.
Do addition and subtraction left to right. If addition is to the left of subtraction, add
first. If subtraction is to the left of addition, subtract first.
An easy mnemonic (memory device) for remembering these is Please Praise My Daughter And
Son (PPMDAS): Parentheses, Power, Multiply, Divide, Add, Subtract.
10(3 – 5)2 + (30⁄5)0 =
First, do what’s inside the parentheses: 3 – 5 = –2. 30⁄5 = 6. Next, do the power: –22 = 4 and 60 = 1.
(Did you remember that any number to the 0 power equals 1?) Next, multiply: 10 × 4 = 40.
Finally, add: 40 + 1 = 41. Correct Answer: 41.
Try another:
3 + (9 – 6)2 – 5(8⁄2)–2 =
First, do what’s inside the parentheses: 9 – 6 = 3 and 8⁄2 = 4. Second, do the powers: 32 = 9 and
4–2 = 1⁄42 = 1⁄16. Multiply: 5 × 1⁄16 = 5⁄16. Finally, add and subtract left to right. 3 + 9 = 12. Then, 12 – 5⁄16 =
1111⁄16. Correct answer: 1111⁄16.
Bonus: Speaking of mnemonics, here’s my favorite. Can you tell me what it stands for?
My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nine Pickles.
Give up? It’s the mnemonic of the planets in our solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto.
Measuring Up: Units of Measurement
Occasionally, you may be expected to know a unit of measurement that the test-makers deem
obvious but that you have forgotten. Take a few minutes to review this brief list.
126
Part IV: Don’t Count Yourself Out: The Math Review and Mini-Test 

Because the units of measurement in your native land may be different from these (especially
pints and quarts and gallons), it’s especially important that you memorize these units. I’d
really hate to see you work through an entire question beautifully and then miss it because of
an unfamiliarity with the units of measurement.
1. Time
 60 seconds = 1 minute
 60 minutes = 1 hour
 24 hours = 1 day
 7 days = 1 week
 52 weeks = 1 year
 365 days = 1 year
 366 days = 1 leap year
Leap year is an interesting concept in terms of math problems. It comes around every four
years. The extra day, February 29, makes 366 days in the year. Why do you need to know
this? Suppose that you see this problem:
Mr. Pellaton’s neon sign flashes four hours a day, every day all year, for four years. If it
costs him three cents a day for electricity, how much will he owe for electricity at the
end of the fourth year?
You may be tempted to say that this problem is supereasy — multiply 365 × 4 to find the
number of days and then multiply that number by .03. Wrong-o! You forgot that extra day for
leap year, and your answer is off by three cents. You know that the test-makers will have that
wrong answer lurking among the answer choices just to trap you. Whenever there is a four-
year period, look out for the leap year with an extra day.
2. Quantities
 16 ounces = 1 pound
 2,000 pounds = 1 standard ton
 2 cups = 1 pint
 2 pints = 1 quart
 4 quarts = 1 gallon
You can calculate that a gallon has 16 cups, or 8 pints. To help you remember, think of bor-
rowing a cup of sugar, sugar is sweet, and you have a Sweet 16 birthday party: 16 sweet cups
of sugar in a gallon. It may be silly, but the best memory aids usually are.
3. Length
 12 inches = 1 foot
 3 feet (36 inches) = 1 yard
 5,280 feet (1,760 yards) = 1 mile
Everyone knows that there are 12 inches in a foot. How many square inches are there in a
square foot? If you say 12, you’ve fallen for the trap. 12 × 12 = 144 square inches in a square
foot.
Bonus: How many cubic inches are there in a cubic foot? Not 12, and not even 144. A cubic
foot is 12 × 12 × 12 = 1,728 cubic inches.

Broken Hearts, Broken Numbers: Fractions
Did you hear about the town so small that its population was a fraction?
Adding or subtracting fractions
1. You can add or subtract fractions only if they have the same denominator.
1⁄3 + 4⁄3 = 5⁄3
3⁄8 – 2⁄8 = 1⁄8
2. When fractions have the same denominator, add or subtract the numerators only.
3. When fractions don’t have the same denominator, you have to find a common 
denominator.
You can, of course, multiply all the denominators, but that often doesn’t give you the lowest
common denominator. You end up with some humongous, overwhelming number that you’d
rather not work with.
4. To find the lowest (least) common denominator, identify the highest denominator and
count by it.
Here’s an example: Find the lowest common denominator of 15 and 6. Sure, you can multiply
15 × 6 = 90, but that’s not the lowest common denominator. Instead, count by fifteens, because
it’s the larger of the two. 15? No, 6 doesn’t go into that. 30? Yes, both 15 and 6 go into 30.
That’s the lowest common denominator.
Try another problem. Find the lowest common denominator for 2, 4, and 5. Count by fives: 5?
No, 2 and 4 don’t go into it. 10? No, 4 doesn’t go into it. 15? No, 2 and 4 don’t go into it. 20?
Yes, all the numbers divide evenly into 20.
In many problems, you don’t even have to find the lowest common denominator. You can
find any common denominator by multiplying the denominators.
4⁄15 + 1⁄6 =
The common denominator is 15 × 6 = 90. Cross-multiply: 4 × 6 = 24. The first fraction becomes
24⁄90. Cross-multiply: 1 × 15 = 15. The second fraction becomes 15⁄90. Now add the numerators: 
24 + 15 = 39. Put the sum over the common denominator: 39⁄90. Can you reduce? Yes, by 3: 13⁄30.
Do the same thing when working with variables instead of numbers.
a/b – c/d =
Find the common denominator by multiplying the two denominators: b × d = bd. Cross-
multiply: a × d = ad. Cross-multiply: c × b = cb. Put the difference of the results of the cross-
multiplication over the common denominator: (ad – cb)/bd.
Multiplying fractions
This is the easy one. Just do it. Multiply horizontally: Multiply the numerators and then mul-
tiply the denominators.

Working with mixed numbers
A mixed number is a whole number with a fraction tagging along behind it, such as 21⁄3, 42⁄5, or
91⁄2. Multiply the whole number by the denominator and add that to the numerator. Put the
sum over the denominator.
21⁄3 = (2 × 3) + 1 = 7→7⁄3
42⁄5 = (4 × 5) + 2 = 22→22⁄5
91⁄2 = (9 × 2) + 1 = 19→19⁄2

O
kay, you math whiz, here’s a question for you. Quick, without your calculator, tell us:
Question: How many seconds are there in a year?
Answer: Exactly 12. January 2nd, February 2nd, March 2nd . . . 
Your number’s up. You cannot escape the ACT Mathematics Test, no matter how hard you
try. One of the four tests of the ACT is the one-hour Mathematics Test, whose questions, alas,
are not quite as much fun as the one above. This chapter tells you what the test contains.
What You See Is What You Get: 
The Format and Breakdown
No, the “breakdown” in the preceding heading doesn’t refer to your (nervous) breakdown,
but rather to the breakdown of the number and types of problems in the Mathematics Test.
This 60-minute test features 60 questions (which makes figuring out your time per problem
convenient, no?). The questions fall into pretty standard categories.
In the ACT bulletin and in many ACT study books, you have to slog through incredibly
detailed analyses of the exact number of each question type on the test: 14 plane geometry
questions, 4 trigonometry questions, blah blah blah. We refuse to put either of us to sleep
with that sort of detail. We mean, it’s not as if you have any control over the distribution of
questions, right? (We can just see the letter: “Dear ACT: Please be sure that I have more geom-
etry and fewer algebra problems — thanks . . . ”) The following is the short ’n’ sweet version
of the kinds of math questions that you’ll encounter in the dark alleyways of the ACT.
 Pre-algebra: (Normal people refer to this as “arithmetic.”) About 20 percent, or one-
fifth, of the questions cover basic arithmetic, including such concepts as fractions and
decimals and the dreaded word problems.
 Elementary algebra: This is the type of material that you learn in your first semester
or two of algebra. These questions test your ability to work with positive and negative

integers, set up algebraic formulas, solve linear equations, and do the occasional FOIL
problem. About 20 percent, or one-fifth, of the questions cover elementary algebra.
If you don’t know what a FOIL problem is, don’t despair. We discuss FOIL in excruciat-
ing detail in Chapter 8.
 Intermediate algebra/coordinate geometry: About 30 percent of the questions cover
more difficult quadratic problems, as well as inequalities, bases, exponents, radicals,
and basic graphing (finding points on an x, y–coordinate graph).
 Plane geometry and trigonometry: About 23 percent of the questions cover plane fig-
ures (what you think of as “just plain figures,” like triangles, circles, quadrilaterals, and
so on). The trig questions make up only 7 percent of the test, so if you haven’t had trig
yet, don’t freak out. Trig questions are very basic, covering trig ratios and basic
trigonometric identities.
Confused? Don’t worry about the exact number of questions. Just remember two basic points:
 You have 60 minutes to do 60 questions.
 One-third of the questions are arithmetic, one-third are algebra, and one-third are
geometry.
Absence Makes the Heart Grow Fonder: 
What Isn’t on the Mathematics Test
Instead of obsessing over how awful the ACT Mathematics Test is, focus on a few of its good
points.
 Calculus: The ACT does not — We repeat, does not — test calculus. You don’t even
have to know how to pronounce “calculus” to get a good ACT Mathematics Test score.
You also don’t have to know trigonometry. Yes, 7 percent of the test (approximately
four questions) covers trig concepts, but if you miss only four questions, we’re happy,
you’re ecstatic, and Harvard is calling.
 Quantitative Comparisons, grid-ins, and so on: The bizarre math questions found in
other standardized exams are also missing from the ACT. If you’ve taken the SAT I, for
example, you’ve seen the Quantitative Comparison (or QC) question, which has no
multiple-choice answers. (For more information about preparing for the SAT I, read 
The SAT I For Dummies, published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.) Some exams have a grid-in
style question, in which no answer choices are given. You don’t have to worry about
those weird formats here. All the math questions on the ACT are in straightforward
multiple-choice format.
All the math questions have five answer choices. The rest of the questions on the ACT
have only four answer choices. Be sure to look at all the possible choices in this sec-
tion. We’re always amazed by how many students, used to looking at answers A, B, C,
and D in other sections, totally don’t see the E answer choices in the math section.
 Traps: Most math exams are full of nasty old traps. The ACT is not. It’s not out to
getcha, like other tests. Here, the questions really test your math knowledge, not 
your patience. You don’t have to be quite as paranoid on the ACT as you do on other
exams.
132
Part IV: Don’t Count Yourself Out: The Math Review and Mini-Test 

Getting into the Grind: The Approach
You’ve done multiple-choice math problems all your life. You don’t have much more to learn
about doing multiple-choice math questions. However, the following common-sense steps
can help you stay focused.
1. Identify the point of the question.
Yes, even the stupid word problems have a point. Each question is trying to get you to
supply one specific piece of information. Does the question ask you to solve for a cir-
cumference, or for an area? Do you have to state the value of x or of 2x? Circle precisely
what the question asks for. After you finish the problem, go back and double-check that
your answer provides the circled information.
We just said that the ACT is not out to trap you — but that doesn’t mean you can’t trap
yourself. Among the answer choices are answers that you get by making careless errors.
Suppose, for example, that the problem asks for the product of numbers, and you find
the sum. That answer will be there. If the question asks for one-half of a quantity and
you solve for twice the quantity, that answer will be there. Because these types of
answer choices are available to you, it’s especially important that you identify exactly
what the problem asks for and supply only that.
2. Budget your time and brain strain: Decide whether the problem is worth your time
and effort.
You don’t have to do every math problem in order, you know. Read the question and
then predict how time-consuming it will be to solve. If you know that you have to take
several steps to answer the question, you may want to skip the problem and go back to
it later. If you’re not even sure where to start the problem, don’t sit there gnawing at
your pencil as if it were an ear of corn (unless you’re Pinocchio, wood really isn’t brain
food). Guess and go.
Guess, guess, guess! The ACT has no penalty for wrong answers. You’re going to (or
already have) read that statement hundreds of times throughout this book. We say it
every chance we get to remind you that you can guess without fear of reprisal. Whenever
you skip a problem, choose an answer, any answer, and hope that you’ll get lucky. Put a
big arrow in the margin of the test booklet next to the question (not on the answer grid,
because it may mess up the computer grading) to remind yourself that you made a wild
guess. But if you run out of time and don’t get back to the question, at least you have
a chance of getting the answer right.
3. Look before you leap: Preview the answer choices.
We’d be wealthy women if we had a nickel for every student who groaned and com-
plained as he or she looked at the answer choices, “Man, I didn’t really have to work
that whole problem out. I could’ve just estimated from the answer choices.” Absolutely
true.
Look at the answer choices before you begin doing any pencil-pushing. Often, the
choices are variations on a theme, like .5, 5, 50, 500, 5,000. If you see those answers,
you know that you don’t have to worry about the digit, only the decimal. Maybe the
answers are very far apart, like 1, 38, 99, 275, and 495. You probably can make a wild
estimate and get that answer correct. But if you see that the answers are close together
(like 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12), you know that you have to invest a little more time and effort
into being extra careful when solving the problem.
4. Give yourself a second chance: Use your answer to check the question.
Think of this as working forward and backward. First, work forward to come up with
the answer to the question. Then plug the answer into the question and work backward
to check it. For example, if the question asks you to solve for x, work through the 
133
Chapter 13: Numb and Number: Acing the Mathematics Test

equation until you get the answer. Then plug that answer back into the equation and
make sure that it works out. This last step takes less time than you may think and can
save you a lot of points.
Time Flies When You’re Having Fun: Timing Tips
The most common complaint we hear from students about the Mathematics Test is, “There’s
just not enough time. If I had more time, I could probably do every single question, but I
always run out of time.” True enough. Although having one minute per question (60 math
questions, 60-minute section) sounds good, you’d be surprised at how fast time goes by. We
have a few suggestions to make the best use of your time.
Skim for your favorite questions
We think of this technique as eating dessert first (something we always do). Go for the choco-
late cake first (the easy questions) to make sure that time doesn’t run out before you get to
the good stuff. Leave the green beans (the harder problems) for the end. If you run out of
time (which happens to most test-takers), at least you will have finished those questions that
you had the best chance of answering correctly.
Start in the middle when plugging 
in the answer choices
On many problems, you’ll be able to plug in the answer choices and see which one fits. For
example, suppose that the question is something like:
x + 1⁄2x + 1⁄3x = 110. What is the value of x?
A. 95
B. 90
C. 72
D. 60
E. 30
Yes, you can use a common denominator and actually work through the problem forward to
find x directly. But it may be just as quick and easy to plug in the answer choices. Start with
the middle choice, choice C. If x = 72, then 1⁄2x = 36, and 1⁄3x = 24. But 72 + 36 + 24 = 132, not 110.
Because the sum is too big, you know the number you plugged in is too big as well. Go down
the list, plugging in the smaller numbers. Try choice D. Let x = 60. Then x(60) + 1⁄2x (30) + 1⁄3x
(20) = 110. Voilà!
Kindly refrain from showing 
off everything you know
Some of the ACT problems have extraneous information. For example, a geometry problem
may list all sorts of numbers, including lengths of sides and measures of interior angles. If 
134
Part IV: Don’t Count Yourself Out: The Math Review and Mini-Test 

the question asks you to find the area of a trapezoid, you need just the numbers for base and
height. (Remember the formula? The area of a trapezoid is 1⁄2[base 1 + base 2] × height.) Extra
red-herring info can make you waste a lot of time. We already know that you’re brilliant (you
bought this book, didn’t you?); you don’t need to prove it by doing more than you’re asked
during the test. If you convert every problem into two or three new problems, you’ll never
finish this section on time.
Put aside two minutes to fill 
in the remaining ovals
The ACT assesses no penalty for guessing. We like to say that over and over and over again
until you’re so exasperated that you want to cut off our air supply. It’s critical to remember
that you don’t lose points for wrong answers; always keep in mind that wild guesses are worth
making. Nothing is worse than that sinking feeling you get when the proctor calls time, and
you still have ten problems you haven’t even looked at. If you save a few minutes at the end,
you can fill in some answers wildly for those last ten problems. You have a good chance of
getting at least a few of them correct.
The proctor is supposed to tell you when you have only five minutes left in the test. Before
the test actually begins, you may want to remind your proctor to do so.
Do’s, Don’ts, and Darns: What to Do 
and Not Do in the Math Test
Although the math questions are pretty straightforward, a few basic do’s and don’ts are
worth noting here.
Do get the lead out
Give your pencil a workout. If you have to solve a geometry problem, jot down the formula
first and then just fill in the numbers. If you have the formula staring at you, you’re not as
likely to make a careless mistake as you would if you tried to keep everything in your head. 
If the geometry problem has words, words, words but no picture, draw the picture yourself.
When you plug in the answer choices or make up your own numbers to substitute for vari-
ables, write down what you plugged in and tried. We see students redoing the same things
over and over because they forgot what they plugged in. Doodle away. You get no scratch
paper for the ACT, but the test booklet has plenty of white space.
The ACT provides very few formulas. None are given in the directions, and only rarely is a
formula given in an individual problem. The test-makers actually expect you to know what
you’re doing and to have the formulas memorized. Heaven forbid that you disappoint them.
Take the time to go through the math reviews in Chapters 10, 11, and 12 (one for geometry,
one for algebra, and one for miscellaneous math) and memorize every formula possible. Pay
special attention to the ones you rarely use, like the formula for determining the interior
angles of a figure. Based on Murphy’s Law (“Whatever can go wrong will go wrong”), the
exam is likely to require the use of those formulas.
135
Chapter 13: Numb and Number: Acing the Mathematics Test

Don’t start working until you’ve 
read the entire problem
So you read the first part of a problem and start trying to solve for the area of the triangle or
the circumference of the circle. But if you read further, you may find that the question asks
only for a ratio of the areas of two figures, which you can figure out without actually finding
the precise areas. Or you may solve a whole algebraic equation, only to realize that the ques-
tion didn’t ask for the variable you found, but for something else entirely. As we say in the
“Getting into the Grind: The Approach” section, earlier in this chapter, circle the part of the
problem that specifies exactly what is asked for.
Just because the answer you got is staring up at you from the test booklet, that does not, in
the least, mean that it’s the right answer. (That’s as bad as thinking that someone is Mr. Right
just because he’s gawking at you in the lunchroom.) The answer may be an interim answer,
like what x is when you’re asked to find the square root of x. The answer may be a careless-
mistake answer, like what you get if you don’t keep your decimal point straight. Or the answer
may be a write-your-own-question answer, in which you give the test-makers something they
weren’t asking for, like finding the perimeter when the question wants the area. (Creativity is
rewarded in the Real World, but it’s punished on the ACT. Much as you’d like to, you can’t
create your own new problems.)
Do reread the problem with your answer inserted
Very few students take this last critical step. Most test-takers are so concerned with finish-
ing on time that they solve the problem and zoom on to the next question. Big tactical error.
Rereading the question in light of your answer can show you some pretty dumb mistakes.
For example, if the question asks you for the average of 5, 9, 12, 17, and 32, and your answer
is 75, you can immediately realize that you found the sum but forgot to divide by the number
of terms. (And of course, 75 is one of the answer choices.) Maybe the question asks you to
find one interior angle of a figure, and your answer is 190. If you look at the angle and see that
it is acute (less than 90 degrees), you’ve made a mistake somewhere.
The ACT very carefully says, “figures are NOT necessarily drawn to scale.” However, in the
majority of cases, the figures are pretty darn close, and eyeballing them can help you at least
eliminate some wrong answers.
Don’t strike out over a difficult question early on
Most standardized exams put their questions in order of difficulty, presenting the easy ones
first, then the medium ones, and finally the hard ones. Things aren’t as cut and dried on the
ACT Mathematics Test. You may find a question that you consider really tough very early in
the exam. Although “easy” and “hard” are subjective, many of my students over the years
have been furious with themselves because they never looked at the last several questions —
reasoning that if they couldn’t get the earlier ones right, they obviously couldn’t get the
later ones at all. Wrong. We’ve seen some relatively simple questions, especially basic geom-
etry questions, close to the end of the exam.
“Easy” and “difficult” for international students often have more to do with the language than
with the math. Many students for whom English is a second language do better on the basic
equations than on the word problems. We suggest that you leaf through each exam as soon
as you begin it, marking which problems you want to do, and then be sure to get to them. If
you have time, you can go back to the others. And don’t forget to fill in an answer for every
question. The ACT does not penalize you for wrong answers.

ither you paid close attention in school or you’ve memorized all the formulas and con-

Now you’re frothing at the bit, eager to show off what you know. Don’t let us hold you back.
Here are a dozen practice questions — give ’em your best shot!

exponents: a4 × a3 = a7. When you have a power outside the parentheses, you multiply the 
exponents: a

i
. Finally, when you divide by like bases, you subtract the exponents: 
a14 ÷ a4 = a14 – 4 = a10. Correct answer: B.
If you chose D, you fell for a trap answer. If you said a4 × a3 = a12 and a12 × 2 = a24, you may have
divided a24 by a4 and gotten a6.
If you chose A, you fell for another trap. You may have reasoned that a4 × a3 is a12. Because 
12 squared is 144, you may have thought that (a12)2 = a144 and that a144 ÷ a4 = a36.
All these trap answers are intentional; the ACT-makers realize that you’re likely to do simple
multiplication and division rather than use the exponents correctly. If you’re still confused
about how to multiply and divide like bases, see the exponents section in Chapter 11.

2. The ratio of knives to forks to spoons in a silverware drawer is 3:4:5. Which of the following
could be the total number of knives, forks, and spoons in the drawer?
F. 60
G. 62
H. 64
J. 65
K. 66
A total must be a multiple of the sum of the numbers of the ratios. In other words, add 
3 + 4 + 5 = 12. The total must be a multiple of 12. Only one answer choice divides evenly by
12. If you’re confused about ratios (supposedly one of the easiest portions of the exam), see
the ratio section of Chapter 11. Correct answer: F.
3. An usher passes out 60 percent of his programs before the intermission and 40 percent of
the remainder after the intermission. At the end of the evening, what percent of the original
number of programs does the usher have left?
A. 60
B. 40
C. 24
D. 16
E. 0
Whenever you have a percentage problem, plug in 100 for the original total. Assume that the
usher begins with 100 programs. If he passes out 60 percent of them, he has passed out 60,
leaving him with 40. Now comes the tricky part. After the intermission, the usher passes out
40 percent of the remainder: 40 percent of 40 is 16 (.40 × 40 = 16) and 40 – 16 = 24. Correct
answer: C.
Did you fall for the trap answer of choice E? If you thought the usher first passed out 60 pro-
grams and then the remaining 40, you believed that he had no programs left at the end of the
evening. The word remainder is the key to this problem. The usher did not pass out 40 per-
cent of his original total, but 40 percent of the remainder.
If you chose D, you made a careless mistake. The number 16 represents the percentage of
programs the usher passed out after the intermission. The question asks for the percent of
programs the usher had left. We suggest that you circle the portion of the question that tells
you what you’re looking for. When you are double-checking your work, this circled portion is
the first thing to review.
4. A salesman makes a commission of $1.50 per shirt sold and $2.50 per pair of pants sold. In
one pay period, he sold 10 more shirts than pairs of pants. If his total commission for the
pay period was $215, what was the total number of shirts and pairs of pants he sold?
A. 40
B. 50
C. 60
D. 110
E. 150
Let x be the number of pairs of pants the salesman sold. Then the number of shirts is x + 10
(because the problem tells you that the salesman sold 10 more shirts than pairs of pants).
Make the equation $1.50(x + 10) + $2.50(x) = $215.
Multiply: 1.50x + 15 + 2.50x = 215.
138
Part IV: Don’t Count Yourself Out: The Math Review and Mini-Test 

Combine like terms: 4.00x + 15 = 215.
Isolate the x on one side: 4.00x = 215 – 15.
Subtract: 4.00x = 200.
Divide: x = 200⁄4, or x = 50.
If you chose answer B, you fell for the trap answer (after all that hard work)! Remember to 
go back and reread what the question is asking for. In this case, it wants to know the total
number of pants and shirts sold. You’re not done working yet. If x (50) is the number of pairs
of pants, then x + 10 (60) is the number of shirts sold. (Note that 60 is a trap answer as well.)
Combine 50 + 60 to get the right answer, 110. Correct answer: D.
5. Kim and Scott work together stuffing envelops. Kim works twice as fast as Scott. Together
they stuff 2,100 envelopes in four hours. How long would Kim working alone take to stuff 
175 envelopes?
A. 20 minutes
B. 30 minutes
C. 1 hour
D. 3 hours

The ratio of Kim’s work to Scott’s work is 2:1. In other words, she does two out of every three
envelopes. Scott does one out of every three envelopes, or 2,100 ÷ 3 = 700. Scott does 700 in
four hours, and Kim does 1,400 in four hours. Divide 1,400 by 4 to find that Kim does 350 per
hour. That means 175 is 1⁄2 of 350. Therefore, in one half-hour (or 30 minutes), Kim can stuff
175 envelopes. Correct answer: B.
When you encounter a word problem like this, don’t start thinking equations immediately.
Power math won’t help you on this problem as much as simply talking the problem through.
6. If DC = 6, what is the shaded area in the figure?
F. 72 – 18π
G. 72 – 36π
H. 9π
J. 36 – 18π
K. 36 – 36π
A shaded area is a leftover. To find a shaded area, you usually find a total, find a subtotal, and
then subtract. If the side DC is 6, that is the same as the radius of the circle.

The area of a circle is πr2; therefore, π62 = 36π. Be careful to remember that you’re working
only with a semicircle. The shaded area subtracts only half the area of the circle, so you sub-
tract 18π. That immediately narrows the answers down to F and J.
Next, find the area of the rectangle. (The area of a rectangle equals length × width.) The
width of DC is 6. Because the radius of the circle is 6, the diameter of the circle is 12. BC, the
diameter of the circle, is the same as the length of the rectangle. 6 × 12 = 72. Finally, subtract:
72 – 18π. Correct answer: F.
Shaded-area questions should be one of the easiest types of questions to get correct. If you
got confused on this problem, flip to the shaded-area portion of Chapter 10.
7. 5a2 + (5a)2 = 120. Solve for a.

(5a)2 is 5a × 5a, which is 25a2.
25a2 + 5a2 = 30a2
30a2 = 120
a2 = 120 ÷ 30
a2 = 4
a = 2
Correct answer: A. Choice C is the trap answer. If you divided 120 by 30 and got 4, you may
have chosen C, forgetting that 4 represented a2, not a.
Of course, you also could simply plug in each answer choice and work backward. Here, if 
a = 2, then
5(2)2 + (5 × 2)2 = 120
(5 × 4) + 102 = 120
20 + 100 = 120
120 = 120
8. Three times as much as 1⁄3 less than 3x is how much in terms of x?
F. 9x
G. 8x
H. 6x
J. x
K.
1⁄3x
Working backward in this type of problem usually is easier. One-third less than 3x is 2x. You
can calculate it this way: 3x – 1⁄3(3x) = 3x – x = 2x. Then 3 × 2x is 6x. Correct answer: H.
If English is your second (or third or fourth) language, a problem like this can be extremely
difficult to understand. The math is easy to do, but the English is hard to translate. This type
of problem is a good one for you to guess at quickly and just go on.

A. 230 pounds
B. 235 pounds
C. 250 pounds
D. 255 pounds
E. 258 pounds
This question tests vocabulary as much as it tests math. The mode is the most frequently
repeated number. In this case, 110 is repeated more often than any other term. The median is
the middle term when the numbers are arranged in order. Here you would have 110, 110, 110,
110, 120, 120, 130, 130, 130, 140, 140. Of these 11 numbers, the sixth one, 120, is the median.
110 + 120 = 230. Correct answer: A.
Don’t confuse median with mean. The mean is the average. You get the mean by adding all
the terms and then dividing by the number of terms. If you chose B, you fell into a different
trap. You thought that 125 was the median, because you added the first and last terms and
divided by 2. Sorry. To find the median, you have to write out all the terms (all four 110s,
both 120s, and so on) and then locate the middle term.

F. 3:2
G. 3:1
H. 2:1
J. 1:1
K. 1:2
The area of a triangle is 1⁄2 base × height. The base of EBD is ED. That is equal to AE, which is
the base of triangle ABE. The bases of the two triangles are equal. The heights are equal, as
well. By definition, a height of a triangle is a line from the tallest point perpendicular to the
base. If the triangles have the same base and the same height, the ratio of their areas is 1:1.

If you’re rushed for time, this problem is a good one to guess at quickly. (Remember: The
ACT does not assess a penalty for wrong answers. Never leave an answer blank. Even a wild
guess is worthwhile.) However, if you do a few of these practice problems, you’ll be sur-
prised at how quickly you can get them right.
Don’t panic. This problem is much easier than it appears. Start with the right-hand column,
the ones or units column: 5 + c = 2. You know that it must be a 12 instead of a 2, making c = 7.
Jot c = 7 to the side.
Carry the 1 to the tens column: 1 + 7, which is 8, and 8 + b = a. You don’t know a yet . . . or do
you? Go to the far-left column (the thousands column). If the answer is ab3a2, the variable 
a must equal 1. You cannot add two four-digit numbers and get 20,000- something. The most
you can get would be 10-000- something (for example, 9,999 + 9,999 = 19,998). Now you know
that a is 1. Jot down a = 1 on the side.
Go back to the tens column. 1 + 7; 8 + b = 11 (it can’t be 1; it must be 11). Therefore, b = 3.
Carry the 1 to the hundreds column. 1 + 5 is 6. 6 + c (which is 7) = 13. Yes, this is true — a
good check. Carry the 1 to the next column. 1 + 9 is 10. 10 + 3 is 13, which is what I said ab
was in the first place. Therefore, c = 7, b = 3, a = 1 and 7 + 3 + 1 = 11. Correct answer: E.
The most common mistake that students make on this type of problem is forgetting to carry
the 1 to the next column. Double-check that you have done so.

Time to Read the Riot ACT:
The Reading Test

In this part . . .
H
ow long have you been reading now: 10 years? 12
years? The purpose of this part is not to teach you
how to read. I assume that you can sound out the words
and make at least a little sense of the passages (although
with some of these passages . . .). Instead, most of the
material in this part discusses the types of questions
you’re going to encounter on the test and the traps built
into them. After you understand the techniques of han-
dling each question type, you get to put the techniques
into action with a mini-reading test based on two abbrevi-
ated passages and eight questions.
Keep in mind that the reading passages in the ACT have
little connection to the reading passages in the Real World,
so don’t try to use the information I give you here on your
reading assignments at school. Learn the techniques, use
them on the ACT, and then file them away under “Been
there, done that.”

 Enlightening yourself with 3,000 words of wisdom: the Reading Test passages
 Questioning your sanity: The Reading Test questions
 Experiencing illusion, delusion, and confusion: tips and traps
I
once had a student tell me, “If I’d known it would end up like this, I never would have let 
my first-grade teacher show me how to read!” Ah, we never know what consequences
our actions will have someday. The first day with your ABCs led you straight to this chapter,
which explains to you the Reading Test portion of the ACT.
In this chapter, you find out what types of passages to expect and what the questions look
like that pertain to each type of passage. It’s too late now to pretend you can’t read, so just
get ready to enjoy the ride.
Facing Forty (Questions): The Reading Test
The Reading Test consists of four passages. Each passage is supposed to be similar in diffi-
culty to materials you encounter during your freshman year of college. The test contains one
passage on each of the following topics:
 Humanities: This passage can be about music, dance, theater, art, architecture, lan-
guage, ethics, literary criticism, and even philosophy. Most students tend to like these
passages because (believe it or not) they are actually interesting.
 Social studies: The social studies passage covers sociology, anthropology, history,
geography, psychology, political science, and economics. That’s an incredibly wide
range of topics when you think about it. The history passages usually are pretty good;
some of the psychology ones can be intense.
 Natural sciences: This passage is what most people think about when they say “sci-
ence.” The natural science passage can cover chemistry, biology, physics, and other
physical sciences.
Are you panicking right now, screaming, “I haven’t taken physics! No fair!” Not to worry.
The questions don’t require you to know any particular subjects. Everything you’ll need
to answer the questions is right there in the passages, and you can go back to the pas-
sages as often as you like.
 Prose fiction: The fiction passage can be taken from a novel or can be a short story.
Some of these are very fun to read. But don’t expect that you’ll have read them before.

In all the years I’ve been teaching, I’ve had only one student tell me she remembers
having read the passage before in a novel. The ACT test-makers obviously don’t want
to test you on what you are familiar with (and maybe have even discussed in class),
but on how well you evaluate a passage that is new to you.
Each passage has 10 questions, for a grand total of 40 questions.
Timing
The Reading Test is 35 minutes long. Assuming you live to an average age of 72, the Reading
Test, therefore, is only about 1/1,081,975th of your life. Now that doesn’t seem so bad, does it?
Scoring
You get three reading scores. One is the total score, based on all 40 questions. Then you get
two subscores: one in natural sciences/social studies (based, obviously, on those two pas-
sages) and one on arts/literature (based on those two passages).
Reading strategies
You’ve been reading since you were about 5 years old. It’s a little late for me to teach you the
basics. What I can do, however, is teach you how to make the best use of your time in this
test. (After all, 35 minutes for four passages and 40 questions means you have only about 8
or 9 minutes per passage. That’s not a great deal of time for most people.)
1. Preview.
You are naturally going to like one type of passage more than the others. Look for it
and do it first, being extremely careful to shade in the correct bubbles on your answer
grid. (When you skip around, it’s easy to mess up the grid.)
What happens if your brain takes a little vacation and you suddenly find you’ve filled 
in the bubbles all wrong? Maybe you started off by reading passage 2, with questions
11–20, but you filled in the bubbles for questions 1–10? Hey, you laugh now, but that’s
easy to do. The first reaction usually is panic; first you erase all your answers, and then
you try to remember what they were. Bad move. Here’s how to handle this problem: As
you answer a question, first circle the correct response in your booklet, and then fill in
the bubble for that response on the answer grid. This way, if you mess up and have to
erase your answer grid, you can just glance at your answer booklet and find the right
answers again.
2. Decide on a strategy.
Some students do well under time pressures and can finish all four passages and the
questions. These are students who don’t have to read slowly and carefully, getting
every little morsel the passages have to offer, but can get the overall idea. Other stu-
dents get so totally nervous if they have to rush, they’ll mess up completely. If you’re
one of these students, it may be better to concentrate on reading three of the passages
carefully and answering all the questions correctly on them.
If you decide to do only three passages, be sure to fill in answers for the last passage.
Remember, the ACT has no penalty for wrong answers, meaning that you should guess
your brains out. Never, ever leave an answer blank.

Part V: Time to Read the Riot ACT: The Reading Test 

3. Pay special attention to the first and last paragraphs and to the first and last lines of
each paragraph.
Most writers (except writers of literature) pay attention to the maxim, “Tell ’em what
you’re gonna tell ’em; tell ’em; and tell ’em what you told ’em.” That means that the
first sentence of a paragraph or the first paragraph of a passage usually gives the main
idea and sets up the paragraph or the passage. The last sentence or paragraph summa-
rizes what’s been said. If you are absolutely short on time, you can often get away with
focusing on these parts of the passage. Even if you are reading carefully and have
plenty of time, think about these parts carefully.
This tip works best if the passage is a complete essay or short story. It doesn’t work 
as well if the passage is an excerpt from a longer work. Occasionally, an excerpt seems
to begin in the middle and end just as abruptly. However, most passages have some
coherent format on which you can concentrate.
4. Don’t memorize!
I see some students stop reading, gaze out into the distance, and mutter to themselves,
counting off on their fingers. It’s apparent that these students are trying to memorize
facts from the passage: “Let’s see, the three basic elements that make up Kleinschwab’s
Elixir are . . . .” You do not have to memorize anything; in fact, doing so can be counter-
productive. Although you naturally want to remember some of what you’ve read, you
can always go back to the passage as often as you’d like.
5. Summarize.
As you’re reading, think about what you’ve learned, and maybe summarize it in your
own words. Don’t make things complicated. A simple “This passage is about the differ-
ences in the way the Greeks looked at nature and the way the Romans looked at nature”
helps to focus your thoughts.
Question: Should I underline or outline as I go?
Answer: If doing so is your normal method of reading, yes. If you rarely outline or under-
line, doing so now may tend to confuse you. I see students who have been told to under-
line or outline spending more time worrying about what to underline than thinking about
what’s in the passage. I personally like to circle key words (especially unusual vocabu-
lary that I think may be important) and occasionally jot a note in the margin, summa-
rizing a paragraph. For example, next to paragraph 1, I may write, “Need for elixir.”
Next to paragraph 2, I write, “Failed experiments.” By paragraph 3, I write, “Success;
uses of elixir.” You get the idea. You are allowed to refer to the passages as often as you
want; having an idea of what is where in the passage can save you precious seconds.
6. Look for relationships and connections.
Maybe the concepts are given in a contrasting form: what makes one idea different
from another? Perhaps you are given thoughts in sequence, like what came first, next,
last. Some passages talk about the cause and effect, how one thing impacts another.
Question: Should I read the questions before the passages?
Answer: Probably not. I would not suggest starting off by reading the questions before
even glancing at the passages, as the questions make no sense out of context. You’ll
just confuse yourself. Some students use a worthwhile technique of looking at the first
few sentences of the passage to get an overview, then reading the questions, and then
going back and reading the passage, keeping the ideas in the back of their brains. And
of course, some of us just read the passage and then go back and forth looking at the
questions. There’s no one right or wrong way. When you’re doing the passages in the
practice exams, try each technique and see which one works best for you individually.
147
Chapter 15: This, Too, Shall Pass(age): Sailing through the Reading Test

I’ve Been Meaning to Ask You 
Something: The Questions
Although you may encounter many different types of questions on the ACT, the following are
some that have shown up frequently in the past. Make like a Boy Scout and Be Prepared.
Main idea
A question may ask, “Which of the following is the main idea of the passage?” or “The theme
of paragraph 3 is which of these?” You’ve likely done “main-idea” questions on other exams
before. Keep in mind three things:
 A main idea is broad and general. It covers the entire passage (or, if the question is
asking about a paragraph, the entire paragraph). Be sure not to choose a “little” answer.
The mere fact that a statement is true does not mean it is the main idea. Suppose you
have a passage about high school education, and a question asks for the main idea.
One answer choice says, “The ACT gives students the heebie-jeebies.” No one can
argue with that statement, but it isn’t the main idea of the passage.
 The right answer often repeats the topic sentence or key words. If the passage is about
Asian philosophy, the correct answer will most likely have the words Asian philosophy
in it. Don’t immediately choose any answer just because it has those words, but if you’re
debating between two answers, the one with the key words may be a better choice.
 Keep in mind the tone of the passage and the attitude of the author. If the passage is
positive and the author is impressed by the philosophy, the main idea will be positive,
not negative or neutral. If the author is criticizing something, the main idea will be neg-
ative. The main idea should always reflect the attitude of the author or the tone of the
passage.
Details
The detail question is the opposite of the main idea. It covers one particular point, not the
passage as a whole. This question is one of the easiest to get correct; you need only go back
to the passage and find the specific answer. Some examples include, “According to the pas-
sage, James confronted Gary about the business when which of the following occurred?” or
“The results of the experiments were considered unacceptable because . . . .”
If you’re running short of time or your brain cells are about ready to surrender, look for this
type of question and answer it first. You can often answer this detail question correctly even
if you haven’t read the entire passage. Find the key word in the question (such as “elixir”)
and skim for that word in the passage.
Tone, attitude, and inference
This question is more of a read-between-the-lines question. You can’t go back to one specific
line of the passage to find the answer. Nowhere in the passage will it say, for example, “My
belief is that physical violence rarely solves problems.” You have to infer from the passage 
as a whole that the author prefers negotiation to confrontation. You have to infer that 
the author is contemptuous of violence and those who practice it, that his or her attitude
148
Part V: Time to Read the Riot ACT: The Reading Test 

throughout the passage is negative. Examples of this sort of question include, “The author
implies that he believes violence is . . . .” and “The fact that the product line included a new
model that James insisted upon carrying despite Gary’s objections indicates that . . . .”
Vocabulary in context
You may have to determine the meaning of a word by its use in context.
Sometimes, common words are used in an uncommon way. For example, the author may
mention that, “Lawrence was unable to cow Michael, despite his frequent threats.” Although
“cow” usually refers to a four-footed bovine, in this case, the word is used as a verb, meaning
to intimidate or frighten (don’t let the ACT cow you).
A question may ask you to interpret what the author means by a short phrase, not just a
word. Here’s an example.
When the author states, “He had done nothing but suffer in silence, which in itself is a type of
strength,” the author means that
A. only strong people are able to go without complaining.
B. the strength required for suffering is greater than that required for inflicting suffering.
C. the person who can suffer the longest is the strongest.
D. criticism is a sign of weakness.
Negative or reverse questions
Although this type of question is rare, a question may be phrased in the negative, such 
as “Which of the following is NOT indicative of dissatisfaction in a relationship?” or “With
which one of the following statements would the author disagree?” You may also have a
question that is phrased positively but expects you to find an inconsistency or a logical fal-
lacy. You’re really pointing out what is wrong, given the reasoning of the passage. For exam-
ple, if the passage states that all strong people are able to handle adversity, you can’t also
state that all people who can handle adversity can also handle tragedy. That’s going too far
in the reasoning.
The ACT features many different types of reading questions. Don’t panic if you see some
question styles beyond the basic ones covered in this chapter. You may also encounter com-
parison questions, cause-and-effect questions, and generalization questions, just to mention
a few. The ACT always is coming up with new ways to test your reading skills.
Tips and Traps
The ACT is not an exam that is especially tricky (unlike, say, the SAT, if you’re taking it).
However, some basic tips can prevent you from falling for the few traps that do exist . . . or
from creating traps of your own.
 Be willing to move around. I’m often asked, “Should I do the questions in order or skip
around?” My answer is that, for the most part, it’s best to go in order. However, if you
are running short of time, look for the “easier” types of questions. For most people,
these are the detail questions, in which you may just go back and skim for a specific
149
Chapter 15: This, Too, Shall Pass(age): Sailing through the Reading Test

fact. A main idea/primary purpose question is also a pretty good candidate for doing
quickly, because you can answer it from your overall impression of the passage, or by
looking at just the first paragraph.
Negative questions (“Which of the following is NOT true?” or “The author would reject
which of the following conclusions?”) can often take a long time to answer because you
have to find four statements that are true and then, by process of elimination, choose
the one that is not. Roman numeral questions (“Solana Beach is renowned for its athletes
because: I. It has an Olympic training center. II. The junior training program is excellent.
III. World-class coaches have moved there to retire.”) can also take a great deal of time
because you have to go through the passage looking for each point.
 Look for key connecting or changing words. A simple word such as “but” or “however”
or “whereas” can indicate that things are about to change. There you are, reading a
passage about how an economic theory has failed to prove valid, when you encounter
a “however.” That may indicate an entire switch, such that the author is now going to
tell you that he or she believes that the policy will be effective in the future. I make a
habit of circling “indicator” words like these. Here’s a short list of words I look for:
but
although
despite
however
whereas
in spite of
nonetheless
on the other hand
 Keep an eye on the time. You have to make a pretty quick decision about whether to
do all the passages or three of the passages more slowly. Whichever you choose (and
you should have your strategy firmly in mind before you get into the test room), divide
your time appropriately and stick to that schedule. If you get bogged down on one
question, fill in something, anything (there’s no penalty for wrong answers on the ACT),
and go on to the next question. You can always come back to it if you have time left at
the end of the section.
 Don’t read more into the passage than is there. Many questions are based on informa-
tion that is specifically stated in the passage. Other questions are based on information
that is implied by the passage. Don’t take matters to extremes or bring in background
information that you happen to have. Suppose that the passage talks about the fall of
communism in the Soviet Union and its satellite countries. You cannot automatically
assume the author also believes that communism will fail in China. Don’t take the rea-
soning that one step too far (and of course, nestled snugly among the answer choices,
will be one that does just that).
One final word: Try to enjoy the passages. Yeah, I know that’s easy for me to say. But believe
it or not, some of this reading material is very interesting. If you approach it with a negative
attitude, your mind is already closed to it, making the material much more difficult to com-
prehend and remember. If you at least pretend that you’re going to have a good time getting
through it, you’re much more likely to put things in perspective and get a better handle on
the material.

In This Chapter
 Celebrating diversity: practicing the various passage types
 Distinguishing the time-worthy questions from the time-waster ones
O
n the actual ACT, you have four full-length (about 750 words each) passages. Each pas-
sage is followed by ten questions. You have only 35 minutes to do that whole test. This
abbreviated practice exam (I want to ease you into this stuff slowly) has two shorter pas-
sages and a total of eight questions. Don’t worry about timing now. Think about what type
of passage each portion is (humanities, prose fiction, science, or social studies) and identify
each of the question types. See Chapters 19 and 21 for the real tests.
DIRECTIONS: Read each passage and then complete the questions that follow.
Passage 1
Social Science
Multinational corporations frequently have difficulty explaining to politicians, human
rights groups, and (perhaps most important) their consumer base why they do business
with, and even seek closer business ties to, countries whose human rights records are con-
sidered very bad by United States standards. The CEOs say that in the business trenches, the
issue of human rights must effectively be detached from the wider spectrum of free trade.
Discussion of the uneasy alliance between trade and human rights has trickled down
from the boardrooms of large multinational corporations to the consumer on the street who,
given the wide variety of products available to him, is eager to show support for human
rights by boycotting the products of a company he feels does not do enough to help its over-
seas workers.
International human rights organizations also are pressuring the multinationals to push
for more humane working conditions in other countries and to, in effect, develop a code of
business conduct that must be adhered to if the American company is to continue working
with the overseas partner.
The President, in drawing up a plan for what he calls the “economic architecture of 
our times,” wants economists, business leaders, and human rights groups to work together
to develop a set of principles that the foreign partners of United States corporations will
voluntarily embrace. Human rights activists, angry at the unclear and indefinite plans for
implementing such rules, charge that their agenda is being given low priority by the State
Department. The President strongly denies their charges, arguing that each situation is
approached on its merits without prejudice, and hopes that all the groups can work together

to develop principles based on empirical research rather than political fiat, emphasizing
that the businesses with experience in the field must initiate the process of developing such
guidelines. Business leaders, while paying lip service to the concept of these principles,
secretly fight against their formal endorsement as they fear such “voluntary” concepts may
someday be given the force of law. Few business leaders have forgotten the Sullivan
Principles, in which a set of voluntary rules regarding business conduct with South Africa
(giving benefits to workers and banning apartheid in the companies that worked with U.S.
partners) became legislation.

A. Politicians are quixotic in their assessment of the priorities of the State Department.
B. Multinational corporations have little, if any, influence on the domestic policies of their
overseas partners.
C. Disagreement exists between the desires of human rights activists to improve the
working conditions of overseas workers and the practical approach taken by the cor-
porations.
D. It is inappropriate to expect foreign corporations to adhere to American standards.
The main idea of the passage is usually stated in the first sentence or two. The first sentence
of this passage discusses the difficulties that corporations have in explaining their business
ties to certain countries to politicians, human rights groups, and consumers. From this state-
ment, you may infer that those groups disagree with the policies of the corporations. Correct
answer: C.
Did you choose A just because of the hard word, quixotic? It’s human nature (we’re all so
insecure) to think that the hard word we don’t know must be the right answer, but it isn’t
always so. Never choose a word you can’t define unless you’re sure that all the words you
can define are wrong. Quixotic means idealistic, impractical (think of the fictional character
Don Quixote tilting at windmills). The President’s belief is not the main idea of the passage.
Just because a statement is (or may be) true does not necessarily mean that it’s the correct
answer to a question. The answer choices to a main-idea question in particular often are true
or at least look plausible.
To answer a main-idea question, I like to pretend that a friend of mine just came up behind
me and said, “Hey, what’cha reading there?” My first response is the main idea: “Oh, I read
this passage about how corporations are getting grief from politicians and other groups
because they do business with certain countries.” Before you look at the answer choices,
predict in your own words what the main idea is. You’ll be pleasantly surprised how close
your prediction is to the correct answer (and you won’t be confused by all the other 
plausible-looking answer choices).
Choice D is a moral value, a judgment call. Who is to say what’s appropriate and what’s inap-
propriate? An answer that passes judgment, one that says something is morally right or
morally wrong, is almost never the correct answer.
2. The author of the passage would most likely agree with which of the following statements?
F. Business leaders, human rights groups, and economists will create the guidelines or
principles; business leaders will initiate the processes.
G. Workers will not accept principles drawn up by politicians whom they distrust but may
agree to principles created by the corporations that pay them.
H. Political activist groups have concerns that are too dramatically different from those of
the corporations for the groups to be able to work together.
J. Foreign nations are distrustful of U.S. political intervention and are more likely to
accept suggestions from multinational corporations.
152
Part V: Time to Read the Riot ACT: The Reading Test 
(25)

The passage gives you the answer quite specifically. In lines 19 and 20, you’re told that 
“ . . . businesses with experience in the field must initiate the process of developing such
guidelines.” Correct answer: F.
Choices G, H, and J are all judgment calls. You’re assuming facts not in evidence, as lawyers
say. Although you personally may believe the statements in these answer choices to be true,
they don’t answer the specific question. The concerns in G and J aren’t even mentioned in
the passage, a tip-off that they probably will not be the correct answer to an “according 
to the passage” question.
3. Which of the following best describes the reason the author mentions the boycott of a cor-
poration’s products by its customers?
A. to ridicule the consumers for believing that their small boycott would significantly
affect the sales of a multinational corporation
B. to predict the inevitability of failure of any plan that does not involve customer input
C. to disagree with the President’s contention that big business is best qualified to draw
up the voluntary principles of workplace conduct
D. to indicate the pressures that are on the multinational corporations
This question is one of those mind-reading questions I warn you about in Chapter 13. You are
expected to get into the author’s mind and understand why he or she said what he or she
did. The concept of the consumer boycott follows closely the main idea of the passage, which
is that the corporations have difficulty trying to explain themselves and their actions to all
sorts of groups, including their customers. From this, you may infer that the point of the
statement is to indicate the pressures placed on the corporations.
Line 10 states that human rights organizations also are pressuring multinational corporations,
allowing you to infer that the consumers are applying pressure. Remember to expand your
horizons: Read until you find what you think is the right answer . . . and then read a little fur-
ther. Correct answer: D.
Choices A and C begin with negative words, “ridicule” and “disagree.” Negative answer
choices are rarely correct. Be careful, however, not to take this tip as a hard-and-fast rule. If
you go back to the correct answer to question number one, you can see that you may inter-
pret that answer as negative.
Choice B seems logical; common sense tells you that a company that ignores its customers
will probably fail. However, a strong, dramatic word like “inevitably” is rarely correct. Few
things in life are inevitable: just death, taxes, and the ACT.
4. Which of the following statements about the Sullivan Principles can best be inferred from
the passage?
F. They had a detrimental effect on the profits of those corporations doing business with
South Africa.
G. They represented an improper alliance between political and business groups.
H. They placed the needs of the foreign workers over those of the domestic workers
whose jobs would therefore be in jeopardy.
J. They will have a chilling effect on future adoption of voluntary guidelines.
Choice F is the major trap here. Perhaps you assumed that because the companies seem to
dislike the Sullivan Principles, they hurt company profits. However, nothing was said in the
passage about profits. Maybe the companies still made good profits but objected to the
153
Chapter 16: Where Are CliffsNotes When You Need Them? Reading Practice Questions

Sullivan Principles on principle. The companies just may not have wanted such governmen-
tal intervention even if profits weren’t decreased. If you chose F, you read too much into the
question and probably didn’t read the rest of the answer choices.
In choice J, the words “chilling effect” mean negative effect, discouraging effect. Think of
something with a chilling effect as leaving you cold. Because few corporations have forgotten
the Sullivan Principles, you may infer that these principles will discourage the companies
from agreeing to voluntary principles in the future. Correct answer: J.
To get this question correct, you really need to understand the whole passage. If you didn’t
know what was going on here, you’d be better off to just guess and go. An inference question
usually means you have to read between the lines; you can’t just go back to one specific por-
tion of the passage and get the answer quickly.
Passage 2
Prose Fiction. This passage is from the Robert Louis Stevenson novel Kidnapped, 1886.
Meanwhile such of the wounded as could move came clambering out of the fore-scuttle
and began to help; while the rest that lay helpless in their bunks harrowed me with scream-
ing and begging to be saved.
The captain took no part. It seemed he was struck stupid. He stood holding by the
shrouds, talking to himself and groaning out aloud whenever the ship hammered on the rock.
His brig was like wife and child to him; he had looked on, day by day, at the mishandling of
poor Ransome; but when it came to the brig, he seemed to suffer along with her.
All the time of our working at the boat, I remember only one other thing; that I asked
Alan, looking across at the shore, what country it was; and he answered, it was the worst
possible for him, for it was a land of the Campbells.
We had one of the wounded men told off to keep a watch upon the seas and cry us
warning. Well, we had the boat about ready to be launched, when this man sang out pretty
shrill: “For God’s sake, hold on!” We knew by his tone that it was something more than ordi-
nary; and sure enough; there followed a sea so huge that it lifted the brig right up and canted
her over on her beam. Whether the cry came too late or my hold was too weak, I know not;
but at the sudden tilting of the ship I was cast clean over the bulwarks into the sea.
I went down, and drank my fill; and then came up, and got a blink of the moon; and then
down again. They say a man sinks the third time for good. I cannot be made like other folk,
then; for I would not like to write how often I went down or how often I came up again. All the
while, I was being hurled along, and beaten upon and choked, and then swallowed whole,
and the thing was so distracting to my wits, that I was neither sorry nor afraid.
Presently, I found I was holding to a spar, which helped me somewhat. And then all of a
sudden I was in quiet water, and began to come to myself.
It was the spare yard I had got hold of, and I was amazed to see how far I had traveled
from the brig. I hailed her indeed; but it was plain she was already out of cry. She was still
holding together; but whether or not they had yet launched the boat, I was too far off and too
low down to see.
While I was hailing the brig, I spied a tract of water lying between us, where no great
waves came, but which yet boiled white all over, and bristled in the moon with rings and
bubbles. Sometimes the whole tract swung to one side, like the tail of a live serpent; some-
times, for a glimpse, it all would disappear and then boil up again. What it was I had no guess,
which for the time increased my fear of it; but I now know it must have been the roost or tide
race, which carried me away so fast and tumbled me about so cruelly, and at last, as if tired
of that play, had flung me and spare yard upon its landward margin.

5. The narrator compares the ship to the captain’s wife and child to
A. lament the captain’s long separation from his family.
B. demonstrate the difficulty the captain has keeping focused on his job.
C. predict the captain’s future madness.
D. show the depth of the connection the captain has to his ship.
The focus of lines 7–9 is on how the captain is upset by the condition of his ship. To compare
his ship to his wife and child is to show how much he loves the ship and thus to emphasize
the deep attachment he has to the vessel. Correct answer: D.
6. Which of the following may you infer from the passage?
F. Alan and the Campbells are enemies.
G. The ship had been attacked by another ship.
H. The narrator was on his first sea voyage.
J. Alan and the author are brothers.
This is a pretty simple question. In lines 8 and 9, you read that Alan felt the land was the
worst possible for him because it was a land of the Campbells. From this, you may readily
infer that he and the Campbells weren’t about to sit down to soup together — that they were
enemies. Correct answer: F.
7. By saying that he “got a blink at the moon,” in line 15, the narrator means that
A. he foresaw his own demise.
B. he saw the sky as he came up out of the water to get air.
C. he was hallucinating as he was drowning.
D. he saw the captain with his pants down.
Line 15 describes the narrator’s dunking and near drowning. He was bobbing up and down in
the water, going under the sea and then coming up for air, at which point he saw the moon.
Make sure you answer the question in the context in which you find the statement; don’t use
your own common sense. And if you chose D (which, of course, would never be on the actual
exam) — man, you’re having altogether too much fun for the ACT! Correct answer: B.
8. The purpose of the passage is
F. to portray a mood of terror.
G. to urge others not to go to sea.
H. to describe an event.
J. to contrast lifestyles of sailors from different countries.
The passage merely tells of something that happened to the author. (Choices using the
words “describe,” “discuss,” and “explain” are often excellent answers to a “What is the pur-
pose?” question.) Choice F is tempting, but surprisingly, the passage is not all that terrifying.
You read in lines 19 and 20 that the narrator was so distracted that he was “neither sorry nor
afraid” to describe an event. Correct answer: H.

The Science Reasoning Test

In this part . . .
I
’ve had students complain that the ACT Science
Reasoning Test made them feel as confused as rats in 
a maze, but things aren’t quite that bad. This part intro-
duces you to the three types of ACT Science Reasoning
passages; you can see what they look like, how to approach
them, and when to run like heck and leave them alone.
You’ll also see several of the most common questions 
that follow the passages and discover what traps are built
into them.
The material in this part does not — I repeat, does not —
lecture on science per se. That is, I’m not about to give
you chemistry formulas or physics principles or biology
maxims. That’s not laziness or stupidity on my part
(although you probably do know more about chemistry,
physics, and biology than I do), but rather a matter of
focus. The ACT Science Reasoning Test doesn’t expect you
to know those sorts of things. All the information that you
need to answer the questions is given to you in the pas-
sages themselves.

eturn your brain to the full upright and locked position. You’re not going to need to
use it as much as you may fear for this section.
I’m Mad, but I’m No Scientist: 
What Do I Need to Know?
Relax. Unclench your hands. Take a few deep breaths. You are not, repeat, not expected to be
able to remember the entire periodic table or to know the difference between the substantia
nigra and a Lorentz transformation. This section of the test is called science reasoning, which
means that you are generally not required to know a lot of science facts. After all, your grades
in science classes are there on the transcript for the admissions officers to read if they really
want to assess your science knowledge. That’s not the point here. The point is to demonstrate
that you have an important collegiate skill: the ability to approach novel information, sort it
out, and draw conclusions from it. The ACT actually includes bizarre and weird information
to give science “dummies” (that’s me!) a break. In other words, you don’t have to know what
a scientist knows, but you should be able to think as a scientist thinks. (Question: Did ya
ever stop to think — and forget to start again?)
Too Graphic for Words: The Format
The Science Reasoning Test consists of 40 questions that are based on seven passages (five
to seven questions per passage). You have 35 minutes to answer these questions, about an
average of 5 minutes per passage.
Each passage should take you about 2 minutes to read and — at least partially — under-
stand. As you go through the following material, and especially as you are held spellbound
by the excruciatingly detailed answer explanations to the practice exam questions, you’ll
find out which types of passages require a lot of upfront work and which you should straight-
arm on your way to the questions.

Plan on allotting yourself approximately 30 seconds per question. You may not think that
that sounds like a lot, but some of the questions will be so easy that you’ll answer them in a
heartbeat and build up a reservoir of time for the harder questions. But, of course, some of
the questions will be so impossible that you’ll want to sue your brain for nonsupport. If you
can’t answer a question within a half-minute, put down something, anything, and go on.
Remember: The ACT has no penalty for wrong answers. Never leave any bubble blank. Fill in
something and hope you get lucky.
Chalk Talk: Developing a Game Plan
The ACT features three basic types of science passages. One of the best things you can do
for yourself is to have a game plan: Recognize which type of passage the material is, have a
strategy for reading or evaluating it, and know which types of questions are likely to follow it.
The following is a brief overview of what to expect and how to approach each type of passage.
The Android’s Favorite: Data Representation
Not only Mr. Data’s favorite, this passage should be your favorite, as well. Most of my stu-
dents tell me that this is the easiest type of passage . . . not coincidentally because it usually
has the least text to read. The ACT has 3 Data Representation passages, 5 questions each, for
a total of 15 questions. This passage is the only one in the science section with only 5 ques-
tions; all the other sections have at least 6 questions per passage.
The Data Rep questions are based on one or more tables, graphs, or diagrams chock-full of
information, preceded or followed by text. Read the text so that you can get an idea about
what point the table, graph, or diagram is trying to make, but don’t get hung up on any com-
plicated terms or sentences. Here’s an example.
Scientists studied the effect that variations in paraloxin had on the rate of samanity in the
species Braisia idioticus. The results are summarized in Table 1 (an example of a Data Rep
table).

What? You don’t know what paraloxin, samanity, rics, and microshels are? That’s not surpris-
ing, considering that I’ve just made them up. I’m babbling here to make the point that you can
get an idea of what the passage is discussing without having a clue about what all the terms
mean. Say to yourself, “When this thing called paraloxin is changed, samanity rate, whatever
it is, may also change. I’ll take a look at the table and see if this happens. The weird units
simply measure paraloxin and samanity rate.”
No, no, alas, the actual ACT will not be as much fun as this book is. On the real test, all the
science is dull, boring . . . real. But my point is that if you don’t know the big hairy terms,
they may as well be made up as far as you’re concerned. The ACT gives everyone, science
geniuses and science morons alike, an equal chance by using unfamiliar science.
International students, this unfamiliar science is a boon for you. Yes, the passages can be dif-
ficult to read, but they are just as hard for someone who is a native English speaker as they
are for you. The terminology is unfamiliar to everyone, giving you all an equal opportunity . . .
and an equal headache.
After the game plan: Executing the play 
When you encounter a Data Representation passage, here’s a suggested approach.
1. Read the introductory text.
Remember, don’t get psyched out about unfamiliar terms. And don’t try to understand
every little thing. Just get an overview of what the passage is about.
2. Look at the table, diagram, or graph.
Identify what is being displayed (for example, drug dosages, reaction times, kinetic
energy, astronomical distances).
3. Look at what the columns, rows, axes, and so on represent and determine how they
are related to one another.
An independent, or controlled, variable is the factor that the experimenter can change
to a specific value, such as the amount of water added. The dependent variable is the
factor that is not under the experimenter’s direct control, such as the amount of energy
released.
Here’s another way to remember which variable does what: The terms dependent vari-
able and independent variable mean almost the opposite of what you may think. The
independent variable is not really independent; it is the one that the experimenter is
changing. The dependent variable is dependent on the independent variable. The most
typical relationship is one in which one column, row, axis, and so on, presents values
for the independent, or controlled, variable and another shows what happens to the
dependent variable.
The following graph presents a classic relationship.

Chapter 17: Frankenstein to Einstein: Excelling on the Science Reasoning Test

Here, the amount of growth factor added is the independent variable, and the plant
height is the dependent variable. The experimenter can’t directly manipulate plant
height. He or she can add a certain amount of growth factor but then has no choice but
to wait and see what happens to the plant.
The ability to distinguish the independent from the dependent variable is essential for
understanding many passages. You may even get a question directly asking about this
distinction.
4. Note the units of measurement.
Don’t freak out if the units are unfamiliar to you. Units of measurement (even the
bizarre ones) are presented very clearly. The axes on graphs are usually labeled, leg-
ends typically accompany diagrams, and graphs and column and row headings usually
include the units.
5. Look for trends in the data, noting any significant shifts.
Take another look at the first example. In the paraloxin-samanity table, you see that
samanity increases at regular intervals as paraloxin is gradually increased up through 4
microshels. Samanity rate hits a sharp peak when paraloxin rises to 5 and 6 microshels
and then falls to levels comparable to those obtained when paraloxin was lower. In the
plant growth graph, note that for the range of values shown on the graph, plant height
steadily increases with increases in growth factor.
Don’t waste time trying to memorize the numbers! If a question requires specific details, you
can always go back and look at the table for them. Why destroy any more brain cells than
you absolutely have to?
Going for pay dirt: The “data-analysis” question
The most common type of question you will get on Data Representation passages is one that
requires some sort of data analysis. This type of question simply tests your ability to read
the table or figure and extract information from it.
Use the graph on plant growth shown in the preceding section to answer the following 
question:
What is the plant height when 5 mg of plant growth factor are used?
Find 5 mg along the horizontal axis, go up to the plotted line, and then go left to the vertical
axis to read the value, which is 3 cm. Notice that you don’t have to know anything about
plants. You have to look only at what’s in front of you.
What if a point is not actually plotted (or a value specifically given) on the table? You can still
answer the question. You interpolate by looking at the two closest values (translated into
plain English, that means insert an intermediate term by estimating). For example, you may
be asked (from Table 1, shown in “The Android’s Favorite: Data Representation” section, ear-
lier in this chapter) for the samanity rate when paraloxin is 1.5. Because the samanity rate is
18 when paraloxin is 1, and 23 when paraloxin is 2, the samanity rate when paraloxin is 1.5 
is probably between 18 and 23. Given that the values are going up in a regular fashion in this
region of the table, it is reasonable to say that the samanity rate is close to 20.5 when par-
aloxin is 1.5.
Along with interpolation, you have to worry about extrapolation. As the “extra” in its name
implies, extrapolation asks you to come up with a value that is beyond the range depicted in
the table or figure. In the plant growth passage, it is probably safe to predict that the straight
upward line will continue for a while as growth factor moves past 20 mg, the last number 
162
Part VI: Proven to Cause Brain Defects in Laboratory Rats: The Science Reasoning Test 

presented in the horizontal axis. Therefore, you can make predictions about plant growth
when growth factor is 21 mg by extending the line. However, you are not justified in predict-
ing what will happen when growth factor is 50 mg. That number is far greater than what is
shown on the graph. For all you know, the plants will die from an overdose of growth factor if
50 mg is administered.
That’s It in a Nutshell: Research Summaries
The ACT has three Research Summary passages, with six questions each. The Research
Summary questions make up 18 of the 40 questions — almost half — that you will encounter
on the ACT Science Reasoning. Like Data Representation passages, Research Summaries usu-
ally include one or more tables or diagrams. Research Summaries, however, are a little more
sophisticated than Data Representation. Here, you must pay attention to what is being tested
in the experiments and how the researchers go about performing the studies.
Fortunately, Research Summary passages are predictable. You can expect each passage to
tell you three things that you should always note:
 The purpose of the study (You may be very familiar with identifying the goal of the
project or the purpose of the study, as you have probably done so on every lab write-
up you’ve turned in since kindergarten. Sometimes the ACT is kind enough to do your
work for you by stating or implying the purpose in the introductory paragraph.)
 The experimental design
 The results (which are usually presented in the same table, chart, or graph format that
I discuss in “The Android’s Favorite: Data Representation” section)
Here’s more detail on these three concepts.
Purpose
Identifying the purpose of the experiment takes only a few seconds. Usually, the purpose is
to examine what effect x has on y. The ACT expects you to understand some key principles
of why the researchers created the experiment in the first place. After you pick up on the
purpose, you must analyze how the researchers set up experiments to investigate these pos-
sible cause-and-effect relationships.
Experimental design
A proper experiment systematically varies the factor that is the possible cause and holds all
other factors constant. For example, if scientists are interested in investigating what effect
having the flu has on one’s ability to perform multiplication problems, a proper experiment
will compare people who have the flu with those who do not, while keeping the groups equal
in terms of such factors as age, mathematical ability, and the presence of psychological dis-
orders. If the groups differ on one or more of these other factors, it cannot be certain that
any observed difference in multiplication performance was a result of the flu. What would you
think if the nonflu group did better on multiplication but that nonflu group consisted of 12-
year-olds while the flu group children were all 8 years old? You could not be certain whether
age or the flu virus accounted for the difference.
163
Chapter 17: Frankenstein to Einstein: Excelling on the Science Reasoning Test

Defective designs produce limited results. The experimenters don’t always include proper
controls. Some studies, by their very nature, cannot adhere to ideal experimental design. For
example, if a scientist suspected that 2-year-olds who had been vaccinated for measles got
more colds than 2-year-olds who had not been vaccinated, a proper design would be to give
one group the vaccine and to withhold it from another group. However, it’s not fair to keep
one group of kids unvaccinated (mothers tend to get cranky when you make their kids sick
“in the best interests of science”). What the experimenters would try to do is collect data on
how frequently the children came down with colds before they were immunized (children are
not immunized against measles until they are at least 1 year old) and perhaps collect data
about the children’s parents when the parents themselves were 2 years old. (The measles
vaccine was not developed then.)
When an experiment lacks certain controls, take note of how the experiment is limited. 
You may be asked to come up with a good control. If you have noted the limitation, you can
quickly say what “shoulda been done.” If you are asked about what conclusions can be made,
be very cautious. It’s hard to come up with definitive conclusions when the experiments don’t
have proper controls.
The different studies presented in a Research Summary passage may differ in terms of what
factor is being manipulated. For example, a study could look at how flu affects multiplication
ability or how multiplication ability varies according to the child’s age. Another study may
examine what dependent variable is being measured (multiplication drills in one study, word
problems involving multiplication in another). Be sure to follow the key way in which the
studies differ. You may want to write some very brief notes in the margin to help you keep
everything straight: “having the flu” or “kids’ ages,” for example.
Although the studies may differ somewhat, they are all designed to answer a key question
stated in the purpose. Read each study with an eye toward how it fills in the big picture.
Just tell me what you want: Question styles
Some of the Research Summaries’ questions are similar to the Data Analysis questions already
discussed in Data Representation. The following are a couple of other question styles that are
more typical of the Research Summaries:
 Experiment design: This question tests your ability to follow the logic of the design
itself. Why or how was the experiment designed? What was the purpose of choosing
one variable or one control?
 Conclusions that can be drawn from one or more of the studies: Be sure to pay 
attention to the question stem. If a question asks you about what can be concluded in
Experiment 1 about the effects of one factor on the dependent variable, you don’t want
to spend a lot of time searching through the information for Experiments 2 and 3.
To answer result/conclusion-type questions, you must be careful not to go overboard.
Suppose that the study about the flu and multiplication showed that the flu group made
substantially more errors on a multiplication drill than did the nonflu group. (And let’s
assume that this study did control for other factors.)
Here is an example of a correct way of thinking about this question.
Question: Which of the following statements is consistent with the study?
Answer: The flu impaired the ability of the students studied to perform multiplication
drills.
Notice that this question asked for something probable, not a big, sweeping conclusion.
You are not going out on a limb by saying that the flu seemed to have an effect. The
164
Part VI: Proven to Cause Brain Defects in Laboratory Rats: The Science Reasoning Test 

study didn’t prove that the flu was the definite cause of the multiplication difficulties,
but the statement certainly follows from the data presented.
Now for an example of going too far (remember that this answer is wrong!):
Question: What can be concluded about the effects of the flu?
Answer: The flu impairs mathematical functioning by interfering with connections in
the brain.
Did the study investigate how the flu changed brain functioning? The study investi-
gated multiplication drills. “Mathematical functioning” is much too broad a topic.
 New or additional results: The results of one study may have an effect on another
study. Your job is to determine how these new results fit into what you already learned.
Do the new results confirm what the studies showed, or are they in conflict? If they
don’t invalidate what you concluded earlier, do they limit what you can say? Perhaps
the results of the flu and multiplication study investigated only children of elementary-
school age. If a question gives you the additional information that there was no differ-
ence between the flu and nonflu groups when high school students were studied, you
have to limit your conclusion about the flu’s impairing-multiplication ability to a group
of younger children. If the results with high school students were similar to what was
found with elementary school children, then you may generalize your conclusions to

Warring Factions: Conflicting Viewpoints
The ACT has one Conflicting Viewpoints passage, with seven questions. You can recognize
the Conflicting Viewpoints passage because it has two major portions of text with headings
similar to “Scientist 1” and “Scientist 2” or titles of theories, such as “extinction by mete-
orites” and “extinction by natural selection.” (Research Summaries have headings, too, but
the headings on those passages are almost always “Experiment 1, 2, 3” or “Study 1, 2, 3.”)
The Conflicting Viewpoints passage, as the title indicates, presents two different explana-
tions about the same scientific situation. The following approach can help you to get started:
1. Read the introduction.
Find out what phenomenon is being debated. Maybe the scientists disagree on whether
objects can travel faster than the speed of light or whether other planets in the solar
system could support life. (Know why there are no restaurants on the moon? Great food,
but no atmosphere!)
2. Read the first viewpoint and make some kind of brief notation (using your own
words) about the author’s main idea.
This main idea will express the scientist’s position on the situation discussed in the
passage’s introduction. It is important to note this main idea because you want to be
able to identify, for example, that Scientist 1 says “pro” while Scientist 2 says “con.”
You don’t want to become engrossed in a question that asks you to support Scientist 1
and forget that he or she took the “pro” side. (And yes, sometimes your notes to your-
self should be as succinct as “pro” and “con” or “yes” and “no.”)
3. Identify the evidence that the first scientist uses to support his or her main idea.
Does the evidence support the main idea, or is the scientist making a leap of faith? This
“leap of faith” is called an assumption. Questionable assumptions open up the door for
the other scientist to dispute the first scientist and come up with an explanation of his
or her own.
165
Chapter 17: Frankenstein to Einstein: Excelling on the Science Reasoning Test

Assumptions usually are pretty sneaky and can be well disguised. Suppose, for example,
that the scientist claims that pandas are carnivores. He or she backs this up by show-
ing that bears are carnivores. Do you see a gap between the main idea and the evidence?
There is evidence that bears are carnivores, but is this enough to say that pandas are
carnivores? You can do so only if you assume that pandas are bears, which may or may
not be true.
4. Identify and analyze the second scientist’s point of view. After you finish with the
first viewpoint, follow the same procedure to identify and analyze the second view-
point. Usually the second viewpoint is easier to follow because it is so predictable. The
main idea of the second scientist is a statement that is directly opposed to the main
idea of the first scientist.
The evidence used may be different, but it may also be the same as that which was
used by the first scientist. The key difference lies in how the second scientist interprets
the evidence. Don’t look exclusively for differences between the two viewpoints. The
ACT may throw in some similarities.
Your job is to follow the logic of each viewpoint. Do not try to decide which viewpoint is cor-
rect. No one cares — not the ACT, not the college admissions office, and certainly not you. In
fact, the ACT sometimes presents a viewpoint that is clearly false. For example, one scientist
may claim that evolution takes place as a result of inheritance of acquired characteristics.
You know that this does not happen. Think about it. If you gnaw your fingernails down to the
bone worrying about the ACT, it does not follow that someday your children will be born
with no fingernails! Again, worry only about the logic of the viewpoint, not whether it is cor-
rect or wrong.
Bonus: Are you in fact an onychophagist? Nah, it’s not as serious as it sounds. Onychophagia
is merely nail biting. The next time that you want to get out of going to school, tell your mom
that you are suffering from onychophagia. She may be too embarrassed to ask what it is, and
let you stay home.
Asking for Trouble: Question Styles
Some questions in Conflicting Viewpoints passages ask you to support or weaken a scien-
tist’s viewpoint. To do so, you first have to identify any assumption that the scientist made in
creating his or her theory. The best way to strengthen a viewpoint is to come up with evi-
dence that confirms that the assumption is valid. The best way to weaken a viewpoint is to
present evidence that casts doubt on the assumption. For example, the previous conclusion
that pandas are carnivores is strengthened if pandas are bears. The conclusion is weakened
if pandas are not bears.
Be careful to keep in mind all the time just which of the two viewpoints you are addressing.
Some of the wrong (trap!) answer choices deal with the other viewpoint and, as a conse-
quence, do not answer the question.
The answer choices for a strengthening/supporting question usually follow a predictable pat-
tern. One choice, the correct answer, supports the correct viewpoint. One incorrect choice
deals with the correct viewpoint but weakens it rather than strengthens it. Another incorrect
choice deals with the other viewpoint. Usually this choice strengthens the other viewpoint,
so it is testing your ability to keep the viewpoints straight. Occasionally, this incorrect choice
weakens the other viewpoint. Such a choice is tough to eliminate, but you must remember
that weakening one viewpoint does not automatically strengthen the other. The third incor-
rect choice will likely present irrelevant evidence.

Part VI: Proven to Cause Brain Defects in Laboratory Rats: The Science Reasoning Test 

Suppose you have a passage about whether smoking cigarettes causes cancer. Scientist 1
says that it does, citing the fact that smokers have a higher incidence of cancer than do non-
smokers. Scientist 2 says that smoking cigarettes does not cause cancer, claiming that there
is no proof that smoking causes the uncontrolled growth seen in cancer. Scientist 2 (yes, the
ACT does use catchy names like “Scientist 1” and “Scientist 2”) explains the association
between smoking and cancer as a result of the fact that some people have a certain body
chemistry that leads to both a smoking habit and cancer.
The first question asks you to identify evidence to support Scientist 1. Here are some very
typical answer choices.
A. Nicotine, a major cigarette ingredient, has been shown to cause cancer in laboratory
rats. (This statement supports Scientist 1’s theory and is the right answer.)
B. Smokers invariably eat a lot of fatty foods, which have been shown to cause cancer.
(This statement weakens Scientist 1’s point of view by suggesting that another cause is
at work.)
C. Injecting rats with Chemical ABC caused them to seek out tobacco and also produced
cancer cells. (This statement goes right along with Scientist 2’s suggestion.)
D. Lack of exercise causes heart disease. (This statement is irrelevant. It discusses nei-
ther cigarettes nor cancer.)
Remember: You don’t care whether the statement is actually true in the Real World or false
in the Real World. For example, statement D, claiming that lack of exercise causes heart dis-
ease, may very well be true. So what? It has nothing to do with supporting Scientist 1’s state-
ment that smoking cigarettes causes cancer.
Parting Is Such Sweet Sorrow: The Conclusion
The ACT follows a pretty dependable format. Therefore, you can develop and stick to a plan
of attack.
 Identify the type of passage (three are Data Representation, three are Research
Summaries, and one is Conflicting Viewpoints).
 For Data Representation, read the intro, look at the table/graph (paying special atten-
tion to the units of measurement), note the relationship between the units, and identify
any trends or patterns.
 For Research Summaries, note the purpose of the study, the experimental design, and
the results.
 For Conflicting Viewpoints, jot down the viewpoint of each scientist and the evidence
used to support his or her main idea.

This chapter gives you a Research Summary with twice the usual number of questions. On
the actual ACT, a Research Summary has only 6 questions, not 12, as in this practice test. I
give you double the usual number so that you can get an idea of the various ways in which
the same basic points are tested. For now, don’t worry about the format or the timing.
Review the material in Chapter 17, and then apply that material to these questions.
DIRECTIONS: Read the science reasoning passage and the analysis that follows it. Then com-
plete the 12 questions that follow and study the answer explanations.
Passage
By using electrical recording devices, scientists have shown that many cells in the part of the
brain involved with processing visual information respond only to lines of a certain orienta-
tion. For example, some brain cells fire when vertical lines are present but do not respond 
to horizontal lines. Animals that rely on vision must have an entire set of cells so that at 
least some part of their brains responds when lines of a given orientation are present in their
environment.
A major question is, how much is brain organization affected by the animal’s environ-
ment? The following series of studies investigates this possible environmental role in the
development of cat vision.

Study 1
Scientists presented lines of various orientations to newborn kittens while recording
electrical activity from the visual part of the brain. No matter what the orientation, some
cells fired while others did not.
These kittens were able to walk around both vertical and horizontal obstacles without
bumping into them.
Study 2
Scientists conducted the same test used in Study 1 on 6-month-old kittens that were
raised in a normal environment. Results matched those of Study 1.
Study 3
Scientists raised newborn kittens for six months in a completely dark environment. The
scientists recorded very little brain cell activity when the kittens were presented with a wide
variety of stimuli.
These kittens had great difficulty navigating around various mazes. They bumped into
both vertical and horizontal obstacles.
Study 4
Scientists placed newborn kittens in an environment in which all they saw were vertical
lines. At 6 months, none of their brain cells responded to horizontal lines, but their brain cells
had more activity than what was found in Studies 1 and 2 when vertical lines were present.
These 6-month-old kittens easily walked around a maze of vertical obstacles but
bumped into and could not walk around horizontal obstacles placed in their paths.
Study 5
This study was identical to Study 4 except that the scientists exposed the kittens to only
horizontal lines. At 6 months, their brain cells showed no activity in response to vertical
lines and, when presented with horizontal lines, showed increased activity as compared to
the kittens in Studies 1 and 2.
These kittens negotiated a maze of horizontal obstacles but could not navigate around
vertical obstacles.
Study 6
Scientists placed 1-year-old cats that were raised in a normal environment and had
normal vision in a dark environment for six months. At the end of this time, these cats dis-
played a brain-cell firing pattern similar to that of the cats used in Studies 1 and 2.
Study 7
For six months, scientists exposed 1-year-old cats with normal vision and a prior normal
environment to only vertical lines. Results were identical to those of Study 6.
Study 8
For six months, scientists exposed 1-year-old cats with normal vision and a prior normal
environment to only horizontal lines. No difference was found between these cats and those
of Study 7.

Part VI: Proven to Cause Brain Defects in Laboratory Rats: The Science Reasoning Test 

Initial Analysis
Are you complaining that you’re not “feline” too well after that, uh, catastrophic passage?
Actually, the passage isn’t that bad. The language is a bit technical, but it’s understandable.
First, try to understand the introductory material, the point of the passage. Then determine
what each study tells you.
The first paragraph basically says that brain cells controlling vision are specialized. Each
cell does a particular job. To cover all possible jobs, a brain needs many different special-
ized cells.
You can grasp a concept easily if you relate it to something in your own life. Think about how
physicians, for example, specialize in their fields. An ophthalmologist treats your eyes. A der-
matologist cures your zits. If you have a zit, the ophthalmologist doesn’t treat you, just as a
vertical-responding cell doesn’t fire in response to a horizontal line.
The question in the second paragraph is one you have probably heard applied to many
aspects of development: How much of a characteristic is caused by your genes and how much
by environment? For example, do you have a Tom Cruise smile because you inherited good
teeth from your parents or because you eat the right foods and brush after meals? Can you
outrun the Road Runner because your parents are athletic or because you train very hard?
In Study 1, don’t sweat the details regarding how the scientists measured the electrical
activity. All you have to get from this study is that the scientists came up with a way to
determine which cells respond to a certain type of line. The results of Study 1 were entirely
expected. Because the visual part of the brain has the whole spectrum of specialized cells,
the fact that some, but not all, cells respond makes sense. If no cells respond, the animal
has a tough time seeing certain kinds of objects in the world. If all cells respond, the brain
cells aren’t specialized.
The most significant result of Study 1 is that the cells responded the way they did soon after
the kittens were born. This result seems to indicate that the cat brain is wired the way it
should be at birth and suggests that genes play a major, if not the only, role in determining
how vision is handled by a cat brain.
On to Study 2. Its results make complete sense. If a newborn kitten is well equipped to handle
its visual world, six months of normal development does not change that ability.
So far, no evidence implicates an environmental role in the development of cat vision. Ah, but
so far, the experiments have been conducted in normal environments. What about abnormal
environments?
Study 3 shows that after six months of no stimulation from the environment, the cells in the
visual part of the brain do not function properly. Do not, I repeat, do not immediately go over-
board and say that a normal environment is necessary for normal responses. Remember,
newborn kittens had normal responses. Instead, play it safe (think like a scientist and don’t
jump to conclusions too rapidly) and say that a normal environment seems to be necessary
to maintain normal response from the visual part of the brain.
In Study 4, the kittens were denied exposure to horizontal lines. You probably shouldn’t be
too surprised, then, to learn that their brain cells did not respond to horizontal lines or that
the brain cells, at least functionally, did not see the horizontal obstacles.
Study 3 shows that, when the cells in the visual part of the brain are not given proper stimu-
lation, they lose their ability to respond. The cells that normally respond to horizontal lines
were not stimulated, so they lost their ability to respond to horizontal lines.
171
Chapter 18: Faking Atomic Ache Won’t Get You Out of This: Science Practice Questions

Study 4 also indicates that at least some of these horizontal-responding cells convert to 
vertical-responding cells. This result provides strong support for the argument that favors
environment over genetics. Under certain circumstances, the environment can change what
the genes set up. (Using the earlier analogy, you can inherit your parents’ gorgeous teeth, but
if you live on nothing but soda pop and candy bars, those gorgeous teeth are going to turn
brown and fall out.)
You can breeze through Study 5. Vertical and horizontal switch roles and results perfectly.
Everything is as expected; zoom on to the next study.
The results of Study 6 may surprise you. As in Study 3, the scientists deprived the cats of
visual stimulation for six months. This time, however, everything was normal when the cats
were tested. At the very least, you can deduce that being a year old makes a difference. A
good scientist would reason that the visual part of the brain is flexible for at least some part
of the first year of a cat’s life, but thereafter the wiring becomes somewhat permanent.
Study 7 follows from Study 6. The wiring of the visual part of a cat’s brain becomes some-
what fixed at about 1 year of age. You can’t teach an old cat new tricks.
And finally, Study 8 also follows from Study 6. The environment loses much of its ability to
influence the organization of the visual part of a cat’s brain when the cat is about 1 year 
of age.
In general, you want to summarize briefly to yourself, and maybe even write a note in the
margin, what each study tested and what the conclusions were. Be sure to note the variables
tested, such as the age of the cats and the horizontal or vertical lines.
1. On the basis of Study 1, can newborn kittens see vertical lines?
A. No, because newborn kittens have brain cells that respond to horizontal lines.
B. No, because newborn kittens can move around horizontal obstacles.
C. Yes, because newborn kittens have been exposed to many vertical lines in their envi-
ronment.
D. Yes, because newborn kittens have brain cells that respond to vertical lines.
The newborn kittens’ brains responded the way that you would expect if the cats were to get
around in their environment, so the Yes answers, choices C and D, are the most probable.
Besides, choices A and B give pretty weak reasons for the lack of responses. The ability to
respond to horizontal lines does not make it impossible to respond to vertical lines.
Choice C is illogical; you can dump that choice by using your common sense alone. If the kit-
tens are newborns, how much exposure could they have had?
Choice D provides a good explanation. The kittens had brain cells that responded to vertical
lines; you can logically make the conclusion that the vertical-lines information gets to the kit-
tens’ brains. This conclusion in turn makes it likely that the kittens can see the lines. Correct
answer: D.
2. Scientists place a 3-month-old kitten that was raised in a normal environment in a maze of
vertical and horizontal obstacles. Which of the following is the most likely result?
F. The kitten bumps into horizontal obstacles but gets around vertical obstacles.
G. The kitten bumps into vertical obstacles but gets around horizontal obstacles.
H. The kitten bumps into both vertical and horizontal obstacles.
J. The kitten negotiates around both vertical and horizontal obstacles.
172
Part VI: Proven to Cause Brain Defects in Laboratory Rats: The Science Reasoning Test 

If a newborn kitten can get around the maze and a kitten raised in a normal environment for
six months can get around the maze, then you logically can conclude that a kitten raised in a
normal environment for three months would be able to do so also. Only choice J has a kitten
that doesn’t need a crash helmet. Correct answer: J.
Did you have Smart Students’ Disease on this question and read more into the question? If
you said, “Yeah, but what if . . . ” and started imagining all sorts of horrible and unlikely pos-
sibilities (“Maybe the kitty OD’d on catnip and staggered around . . . ”), you made this prob-
lem much harder than it really was. Keep it simple, okay?
3. Scientists place a 1-year-old cat that was raised in a normal environment in a maze of verti-
cal and horizontal obstacles. Which of the following is the most likely result?
A. The cat makes no attempt to get around the obstacles.
B. The cat negotiates around both vertical and horizontal obstacles.
C. The cat bumps into horizontal obstacles but gets around vertical obstacles.
D. The cat bumps into vertical obstacles but gets around horizontal obstacles.
Did you try to answer this question based on Studies 1 and 2? Doing so worked for the previ-
ous question because it spoke of an age, 3 months, that was between newborn (Study 1) and
6 months (Study 2). In this question, the cat is twice as old as the oldest kitten in Studies 1
and 2, meaning that you can’t be sure that the present trend continues. (Common sense tells
you that the trend probably will continue, but you must be able to distinguish between what
will probably happen and what will necessarily happen.)
A more definitive answer comes from looking at Studies 6, 7, and 8. In these studies, scien-
tists gave normal cats that had a normal environment for one year an abnormal environment
for six months. The cat in this question still responded normally, the same way that the cats
in Studies 6, 7, and 8 responded, but didn’t have to endure an abnormal experience. If the
vision of the cats exposed to the abnormal environments turned out okay, then the cat that
was not placed in such an environment should also be okay. Correct answer: B.
If you were really lost on this problem, eliminate choice A as much too extreme. You’ll do
better when you hedge by using words such as “rarely” or “infrequently” than when you use
dramatic terms like “no” or “never.” Because nothing indicates a favoring of vertical over hor-
izontal lines or vice versa, you can eliminate choices C and D as well.
4. Which of the following was not under the direct control of the experimenters?
F. The length of time that the cat spent in an abnormal environment
G. The number of brain cells that responded to horizontal lines
H. The age at which the cat was tested for visual response
J. The types of obstacles placed in a maze
When an experimental factor, or variable, is under the direct control of the experimenters,
the experimenters are able to decide exactly how much (or what type) of that factor to use
without having to depend on any intervening process. Choice F is clearly under the control
of the experimenters. The experimenters can let the cat out of the bag (the environment) any
time they want. Choice J is just as clear. The experimenters can throw in more vertical or
horizontal obstacles at will.
Choice H is a little tougher to eliminate. You may think that the cat’s age is up to the cat 
(or at least up to its parents), but the experimenters can decide exactly how old the cats
have to be in order to be used in a certain part of the experiment.
173
Chapter 18: Faking Atomic Ache Won’t Get You Out of This: Science Practice Questions

By process of elimination, choice G is correct. The experimenters can try to change this
factor by changing the environment, but exactly how many cells are going to respond
depends on the way the cat’s brain is set up and on how the cat’s brain interacts with the
environment. Correct answer: G.
You can use this basic science info in many different passages: Independent variables (choices
F, H, and J, in this case) are those that can be manipulated independently of any other factor.
For example, the experimenter can change the time spent in the dark environment from six
months to five months without changing the type of obstacles in the maze. A dependent vari-
able (choice G in this case) depends on what else was done in the experiment.
5. Why is Study 6 so important in relation to Study 3?
A. Study 6 shows that the effects of six months in darkness may depend on the cat’s age
when scientists place it in such an environment.
B. Older cats have more reliable brain-cell responses than younger cats.
C. Study 6 extends the findings of Study 3 by showing that longer periods of darkness also
change brain-cell responses.
D. Study 6 contradicts the findings of Study 3 by showing that, when cats are placed in
darkness for a longer period of time, the effect found in Study 3 disappears.
Dump choices C and D immediately. Study 6 used older cats (ones that have been alive for a
longer period of time), but these cats, as well as those of Study 3, were in darkness for only
six months.
The ACT tests no expert knowledge. You can answer all questions based on what is stated or
implied in the passages. In other words, you are not required to be an expert on cat brain
physiology. Because only such experts (and maybe Garfield) know whether choice B is true,
you can reject it. Six months in darkness does not have such a devastating effect when the
cats are older. Correct answer: A.
6. Some humans who have suffered brain injuries have been able to recover a lost brain func-
tion by having the brain reorganize itself. On the basis of all the cat-vision studies, which 
of the following humans would be most likely to recover a lost function through brain 
reorganization?
F. A 50-year-old man who suffers a stroke (lack of oxygen to a certain region of the brain)
G. An 80-year-old woman who suffers a stroke
H. A 30-year-old combat soldier who suffers a bullet wound in the brain
J. A baby who has had part of the left side of his brain surgically removed along with a
tumor
Calm down, calm down — no one expects you to know exactly how each of these brain trau-
mas affects brain functioning. Everything you need to answer this question is given in the
passage. The key is to pick up on the ages. Which cats showed a change from the ordinary
response pattern when the environment changed? The young cats. Similarly, a young human’s
brain is likely to be more flexible than that of an older human (haven’t you always yelled at
your parents not to be so narrow-minded and set in their ways?). Choice J, which features
the youngest human, is the correct answer. Correct answer: J.
If you’re almost having a stroke right now arguing with me, you probably didn’t notice how
carefully the question was worded: “Which of the following humans would be most likely
to . . . ?” True, you don’t know for sure that the baby would have some lost brain function,
but all you are asked is which of the answer choices (no, “a student studying for the ACT”
was not among them) is the most likely.
174
Part VI: Proven to Cause Brain Defects in Laboratory Rats: The Science Reasoning Test 

7. Scientists exposed a 2-year-old cat that was raised in a normal environment and had normal
vision to only horizontal lines. Which of the following is the most reasonable prediction?
A. After three months, the cells in the visual part of the cat’s brain fail to respond to verti-
cal lines.
B. After six months, the cells in the visual part of the cat’s brain fail to respond to vertical
lines.
C. After six months, the cells in the visual part of the cat’s brain respond to vertical lines.
D. After 12 months, the cells in the visual part of the cat’s brain respond to vertical lines.
Study 8 shows that 1-year-old cats exposed to only horizontal lines for six months still have
brain cells capable of responding to vertical lines. This info knocks out choices A and B. After
one year, the wiring in the cat’s visual part of the brain seems to be fixed, so you can assume
that the 2-year-old cat’s brain has fixed wiring.
Be careful of choice D. You cannot say for sure what effects an exposure longer than six
months will have. Choice C is a much safer choice and is the correct answer. Correct 
answer: C.
Have you been noticing throughout these answer explanations how often you can narrow the
answers down to two choices very quickly? If you’re in a hurry or if you’re confused, make a
quick guess. Remember that the ACT does not penalize you for wrong answers.
8. In considering all the studies, which of the following is true regarding the brain-cell electri-
cal measurements and the maze results?
F. The measurements and results are consistent with each other.
G. The measurements and results are consistent with each other only for newborn kittens.
H. The measurements and results are consistent with each other only for cats more than 
1 year old.
J. The measurements and results are inconsistent with each other.
When the electrical measurements showed reduced response to vertical lines, the cats could
negotiate around vertical obstacles. Reduced response to horizontal lines corresponds to
failure to negotiate around horizontal obstacles. The electrical measurements and the maze
results always provided the same information regarding what type of lines the cats could
handle. Correct answer: F.
9. Which of the following studies shows that environmental stimulation can lead to a change in
the way the cells in the visual part of a cat’s brain respond?
I. Study 1
II. Study 4
III. Study 5
IV. Study 8
A. II only
B. II and III only
C. III and IV only
D. I, III, and IV only
175
Chapter 18: Faking Atomic Ache Won’t Get You Out of This: Science Practice Questions

Study 1 was performed with newborn kittens. With such minimal environmental stimulation,
this study can’t be used to show that the environment has an effect. This eliminates option I;
put a big X through it. You can now dump choice D.
Study 4 looks good. Exposure to only vertical lines caused a loss of cells able to respond to
horizontal lines and a gain of those able to respond to vertical lines. Option II is correct. Put
a circle around it. Because the correct answer must have II in it, eliminate choice C.
Study 5 is very similar to Study 4, except that the roles of the vertical and horizontal lines are
reversed. Study 5 shows a loss of cells able to respond to vertical lines and a gain of those
able to respond to horizontal lines. Circle option III. Correct answer: B.
To check your work, verify that option IV doesn’t work. Study 8 shows that the environment
has no effect on 1-year-old cats. This study, taken by itself, lends no support to an environ-
mental contribution.
10. If Study 4 is conducted but Studies 3 and 5 are not, can the scientists conclude that all cells
in the visual part of a kitten’s brain require stimulation in order to function?
F. Yes, because some brain cells stop responding to horizontal lines.
G. Yes, because some brain cells respond to vertical lines.
H. No, because some brain cells respond to vertical lines.
J. No, because Study 4 does not test whether vertical-responding cells require stimulation.
This question tests whether you understand that experimental results are limited when only
certain conditions are tested. The results of Study 4 indicate only that horizontal-responding
cells require stimulation early in a kitten’s life in order to function. Study 4 does not establish
whether vertical-responding cells require such stimulation because the study does not exam-
ine what happens to the cells when they are deprived of vertical-line input. A conclusion
regarding all cells is not justified. Eliminate choices F and G. For all you know, horizontal
lines and the cells that respond to them can be special.
Choice H is out because all this study establishes in regard to vertical lines is that the cells
continue to respond when given vertical-line input. Perhaps the cells could have responded
in the absence of such input.
Choice J pinpoints the limitations of the study and is the correct answer. Studies 3 and 5 did
test this factor and allow for a more general conclusion regarding brain cells and environ-
mental input. Correct answer: J.
11. On the basis of all the studies, which of the following best summarizes the role of the envi-
ronment in the development of a cat’s visual brain-cell responses?
A. The environment has no effect.
B. Environmental input early in a cat’s life contributes to the continuation of normal
responding.
C. Environmental input can change the pattern of responses throughout a cat’s life.
D. The environment is the only factor that influences the responses.
If choice A is true, the kittens in Studies 3, 4, and 5 would have normal visual responses.
Eliminate choice A. If choice C were true, the cats in Studies 6, 7, and 8 would show a change
in response patterns. Choice D is at odds with Study 1. If the environment is the only factor,
why do newborn cats show responses to all types of stimuli? This reasoning leaves only
choice B. Correct answer: B.
176
Part VI: Proven to Cause Brain Defects in Laboratory Rats: The Science Reasoning Test 

Are you noticing and using the wording to help you choose and eliminate answers? The con-
servative language (“contributes to the continuation” rather than “directly determines”) rein-
forces choice B as the answer. It is tough to argue with a choice that doesn’t say something
so extreme that one example would be enough to contradict it. Notice how easily you can
contradict choice A, which has the word “no,” choice C, which says “throughout,” and choice
D, which contains “only.”
12. Which of the following studies would probably add the most new information to the work
done in this set of experiments?
F. A study identical to Study 3, except that the kittens are in the dark environment for
seven months.
G. A study identical to Study 6, except that the cats are in the dark environment for five
months.
H. A study identical to Study 6, except that the study uses 2-year-old cats.
J. A study identical to Studies 4 and 5, except that the cats are exposed only to diagonal
lines.
Study 3 shows that six months of darkness almost entirely wipes out the cells’ ability to
respond. Perhaps seven months would cause a complete cessation of responding, but the
point made from Study 3 (namely, that lack of visual stimulation leads to impaired brain-cell
responding) is already established. Therefore, the study mentioned in choice F will not add
much.
Study 6 strongly suggests that the response patterns in the visual part of a cat’s brain are fixed
enough at 1 year so that six months of an abnormal environment has no noticeable effect. If
six months has no noticeable effect, why would five months be any different? Eliminate choice
G. If the brain-cell responses are fixed by the time that a cat is 1 year old, it seems reasonable
to expect that a 2-year-old cat would show the same responses. Eliminate choice H.
The study mentioned in choice J would help because it would show what happens to cells
that respond to lines that are in between vertical and horizontal. This study would add some
information regarding how precise the brain cells are in regard to lines in the environment.
For example, is a diagonal line close enough to a vertical line that the exposure only to diago-
nal lines still allows the cat to respond to vertical lines? The answer to this question would
increase understanding of how the environment interacts with the visual part of a cat’s brain.
Correct answer: J.

I
t’s the moment you’ve been waiting for: a chance to
download all that stuff you’ve been cramming into your
brain. This part contains two full-length practice exams. 
I take these tests seriously, and you should, too. Do them
under actual test conditions, sitting in a quiet room and
timing yourself. Open books are definitely out. (Sorry!) 
I have spies everywhere. I’ll know if you cheat on these
tests — you’ll hear a knocking at your door one foggy
night . . . . 
Unlike the questions, however, the answer explanations
don’t have to be serious; in fact, they’re a lot of fun.
Ready? Show me what you can do.

How to Ruin a Perfectly Good Day, 
Part I: Practice Exam 1
You are now ready to take a sample ACT. The following exam consists of four tests: a 
45-minute English Test, a 60-minute Mathematics Test, a 35-minute Reading Test, and 
a 35-minute Science Reasoning Test. You probably are familiar with the format of each test
by now.
Please take this test under these normal exam conditions. (This is serious stuff!)
1. Sit where you won’t be interrupted (even though you’d probably welcome any 
distractions).
2. Use the answer grid provided.
3. Set your alarm clock for the intervals indicated at the beginning of each test.
4. Do not go on to the next test until the time allotted for the test you are taking is up.
5. Check your work for that test only.
6. Do not take a break during any test.
7. Give yourself one ten-minute break between tests two and three.
When you’ve completed the entire test, check your answers with the answer key at the end
of this chapter. A section explaining your score precedes the answer key.
Chapter 20 gives detailed explanations of the answers. Go through the answer explanations
to all the questions, not just the ones you missed. You will find a plethora of worthwhile
information, material that provides a good review of everything you’ve learned in the other
chapters of the book. We even toss in a few good (?) jokes to keep you somewhat sane.

For example, I learned that the word giraffe is
thought to be derived from the Arabic word zirafah,
which means “tallest of all.” The name is not
inappropriate. Giraffes are the tallest animals on
earth, and may reach a height of more than 15 feet.
The more detailed scientific name also interesting.
Scientists officially call this animal Giraffa
camelopardalis because it considers the animal to
look like a camel with the markings of a leopard.
It appears that no two sets of markings are
alike. While most visitors to the zoo consider all
giraffes to have the same markings, a trained eye
can distinguish subtle differences. The patterns
vary from subspecies to subspecies, as does the
location of the patterns. Some giraffes, for exam-
ple, have spots running down their legs, and others
do not. The colors can also vary, from a blackish
hue to a light yellow. The colors serve the purpose
of camouflaging the giraffe, being that it blends in
well with the leaves of the trees in which it hides.
The long neck of the giraffe is mistaken for a tree
branch. 
The theory that the markings on a
giraffe are comparable to the fingerprints of a
human has gained ground. 15

Passage 2
Alex Haley, Roots Author
[1]
[1]Roots author Alex Haley turned his African
ancestors into a book who’s emotional impact on
Black Americans cannot be overestimated. [2]Born
in 1921 in Ithaca, New York, his early years were
spent with his grandmother in Henning, Tennessee.
[3]The oldest of three sons in his family. 
[2]
As a child, Alex wasn’t desirous of becoming a
writer. As an adult, Alex took a variety of jobs,
eventually joining the Coast Guard and becoming a
cook. Unchallenged by his daily routine in the U.S.
Coast Guard, Haley wrote articles which he sent to
many different magazines, hoping to catch an
editor’s attention. Eventually his submissions were
accepted, and occasionally he received payment
for his work. Haley’s literary abilities afforded him
an opportunity to change his career. It is not every
cook who can become a military journalist. By 1959
when Haley retired from military service, he held
the title of Chief Journalist.

[3]
Alex Haley wrote many articles on a variety of
topics, both domestic and international. Eventually,
he did family history research in the National
Archives in Washington, D.C. Haley took more than a
dozen years to do the research and he traveled
more than a half a million miles to work in huge
archives and small libraries ranging over three
continents. Researching his ancestors took them to
Juffure, a small village in The Gambia. The Gambia’s
historian spoke about Kunta Kinte, who was sent to
the United States on a British slave ship. After Haley
completed his research, then he knew he had to tell
everyone the story of Kunta Kinte. The author
emphasized that this was the saga of not only the
Haley family but also the story of Black Americans.
That Black Americans agreed was amply demon-
strated by the fascination surrounding the mini-
series developed from the book. The miniseries
Roots has been repeated and continues to earn high
ratings every time it shows on television. 29

Question 29 refers to the passage as a whole.
29.
This passage was written as a homework
assignment to “Discuss the literary abilities 
of Alex Haley.” Did the passage fulfill the
assignment?
A. Yes, because the derivation of Roots is
discussed.
B.
Yes, because the reader learns the
sources of Haley’s ideas.
C.
No, because the emphasis is on Haley’s
life, not his skill as a writer.
D. No, because the focus is more on Haley’s
family than on Haley.

Passage 3
One Man’s Opinion About Time Travel
by Carl Mack
Want to go back in time and discussing philos-
ophy with Aristotle, rule with Nero, dine with
Lincoln? If you want to travel in time, a space ship.
But given that you are on earth now, why would
you need a space ship to return to a place you
already are? The answer can be explained with a
little science (or at least what I, a non- scientist,
think is logical). The earth is rotating on its axis,
it is also orbiting the Sun. The Sun is traveling along
the outer arm of the Milky Way galaxy which is trav-
eling through space on it’s endless journey to the
infinite. Because in the minute you were thinking
the earth has moved from where it was to where it
is now, moving you with it so you do not notice any
change. This is why you think you are not moving
when you are. To simplify things, think of the earth
as a car traveling down a road and you are a pas-
senger in the car. If the car is moving at one mile an
hour and you jump back in time one hour (dis-
counting all the movement of the earth itself); you
would find yourself sitting on the road with the car
one mile away heading toward you. When you left
the time you were in and went back in time, you did
not take the car with you; therefore, it moved back
in time and space to when and where it was one

hour earlier. The same if you moved in time
accounting for the earth’s movement. You would
end up somewhere in space waiting for the earth to
catch up to you!
And this is the reason because you need a
space ship, so you could travel to where the earth
was at that time to which you return. Not only do
you have to jump back in time, you have to go back
to a time earlier than you wanted so you can travel
to the earth and arrive “on time.”

Passage 4
The Findings of the Paleontologists
[1]
Paleontologists have called the preserved 
burrows “devil’s corkscrews” (or Daemonelix)
when the time they were first found. At that time
there were then, scientists thought the corkscrews
might be holes left by the giant tap roots of some
unknown plant. But when, however, Palaeocastor
skeletons were found in the bottoms of the spirals,
almost everyone had to concede that they were
truly beaver burrows. Admittedly, the skeleton of 
a Nothocyon been found in one burrow; but this
predator probably followed a beaver home for
supper and just stayed. Three other kinds of
beavers lived around Agate in the early Miocene
epoch, but their bones have never been found in
the burrows, in fact, no one knows what they did
for homes. Perhaps there burrows were much shal-
lower or were in the river banks where running
water soon destroyed them.

[1]The paleontologists’ findings seem incompat-
ible with the divisions of epochs, periods, and eras
until one considers that the divisions were based on
breaks in the European sedimentary record reflect-
ing local events that did not necessarily show up in
North America’s sediments. [2]Paleontologists can
tell that no dramatic change layed in store for the
fauna at the beginning of the Miocene epoch and
that many Oligocene genera carried over into the
new epoch. [3]Most of the primitive animals that
had survived in the extensive forests become extant
when the forests began to retreat: but for the most
part, the record continued undisturbed. [4]This is to
be expected where the accumulation of sediments
continued nonstop without interruption.

Passage 5
Vietnam
In 111 B.C., ancestors of the present-day
Vietnamese, inhabiting part of what is now south-
ern China and northern Vietnam, were conquered,
there being the warlike forces of China’s Han
dynasty. Chinese rule lasted more than 1,000 years,
since A.D. 939, when the Vietnamese ousted their
conquerors and began a southward expansion,
that, by the mid-eighteenth century, reached the
Gulf of Siam.
The Vietnamese were rent by internal political
divisions, however, and for nearly two centuries
contending families in the north and south strug-
gled to control the powerless kings of the Le
dynasty. During this period, Vietnam affectively
was divided near the 17th parallel. Just a few kilo-
meters above the demarcation line established at
the 1954 Geneva Conference.
Vietnam having been reunited following a 
devastating civil war in the eighteenth century 
but soon fell prey to the expansion of European
colonialism. While the French conquest of Vietnam
began in 1858 with an attack on what is now the
city of Da Nang. France imposed control gradually,
to meet heavy resistance, and only in 1884 was
Vietnam officially incorporated into the French
empire.

Vietnam’s resistance was the precursor of
nationalist activity directed against foreign rule. By
1930, the Vietnam Nationalist Party had staged the
first significant armed uprising against the French,
but its virtual destruction in the ensuing French
repression left the leadership of the anticolonial
movement to those more adapt at underground
organization and survival — the Communists. In
that same year, the recently formed Indochinese
Communist Party (ICP) took the lead in setting up
short-lived “soviets” in Nghe An and Ha Tinh
provinces, an action that identified the ICP with
peasant unrest.
The Vietnamese communist movement began
in Paris in 1920 when Ho Chi Minh became a char-
ter member of the French Communist Party. Two
years later, Ho went to Moscow to study Marxist
doctrine, then he went to China. While in China, he
formed the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth
League, setting the stage for the formation of the
ICP in 1930. French repression of nationalists and
Communists forced some of the insurgents under-
ground. Other dissidents were imprisoned, some
emerging later to play an important role in the anti-
colonial movement.

Passage 1
Natural Science
Thrombosis refers to abnormal clotting that
causes the blood flow in a blood vessel to become
obstructed. Venous thrombosis refers to such an
obstruction in a vein, often at some site of inflam-
mation, disease, or injury to the blood vessel wall.
The clot (thrombus) may remain fixed at the site of
origin, adhering to the wall of the vein. Or the clot
(or a fragment of it) may break loose to be carried
elsewhere in the circulatory system by the blood.
The migratory clot or fragment is then called an
embolus.
In pulmonary embolism, the clot or fragment
breaks free from its site of origin, usually a deep
vein of the leg or pelvis, and is carried by the blood
through progressively larger veins into the inferior
vena cava, a very large abdominal vein that empties
into the right side of the heart. The embolus is
pumped through the right side of the heart and into
the pulmonary artery, whose branches supply
blood to the lungs. Depending on its size, the embo-
lus may pass through the larger pulmonary
branches, but may eventually enter a branch too
narrow to allow it to pass. Here it lodges, obstruct-
ing blood flow to the lung tissues supplied by that
vessel and its finer divisions “downstream” from
the embolus.
The clinical consequences of pulmonary
embolism vary with the size of the embolus and the
extent to which it reduces total blood flow to the
lungs. Very small emboli cause so little circulatory
impairment that they may produce no clinical signs
or symptoms at all. In fact, among the estimated
300,000 patients who experience pulmonary
embolism each year, the great majority suffer no
serious symptoms or complications, and the disor-
der clears up without significant aftereffects.
However, in a significant percentage of patients,
the pulmonary embolism is massive, sometimes
reducing total pulmonary blood flow by 50 percent
or more; and the consequences may be grave: seri-
ously strained circulation, shock, or acute respira-
tory failure. Massive pulmonary embolism causes
some 50,000 deaths each year in the U.S.
Reading Test
Certain classes of patients are more likely than
others to develop venous thrombosis with its atten-
dant risk of pulmonary embolism. Disorders that
increase susceptibility include venous inflammation
(phlebitis), congestive heart failure, and certain
forms of cancer. Women are more susceptible
during pregnancy and during recovery from child-
birth than at other times, and those taking birth
control pills appear to be at slightly higher risk
than are women who do not. Postoperative patients
constitute a high-risk group, particularly following
pelvic surgery and orthopedic procedures involving
the hip. Any operations requiring that the patient be
immobilized for prolonged periods afterward exac-
erbate the risk of this problem. Among patients
recovering from hip fractures, for example, the 
incidence of venous thrombosis may run as high as
50 percent.
Venous thrombosis can sometimes be diag-
nosed by the presence of a swollen extremity with
some evidence of inflammation or a clot that can be
felt when the affected vein is examined. But some-
times venous thrombosis produces no clear-cut
clinical signs so that other tests may be needed to
confirm the diagnosis.
One such test entails injecting fibrinogen
tagged with a radioactive isotope of iodine into the
blood. Fibrinogen has a strong affinity for blood
clots and is incorporated into them, carrying its
radioactive label with it. The clot can then be
located with a radiation-sensing device.
Another diagnostic technique, called venogra-
phy, involves injecting a dye (one that shows
clearly on X-rays) into the vein where obstruction is
suspected. The X-ray venogram provides very
detailed information on the extent and location of
the obstruction.
A third technique uses sensitive instruments
that measure blood flow in vessels of the extremi-
ties to detect any circulatory impairment that may
result from thrombosis.
Signs of nonfatal pulmonary embolism may
include sudden shortness of breath, chest pain,
increased heart rate, restlessness and anxiety, a fall
in blood pressure, and loss of consciousness. But
clinical symptoms may vary by their presence or

absence and in their intensity, and their similarity
to symptoms that may result from other disorders
can make the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism dif-
ficult on this basis alone.
Pulmonary angiography (X-ray visualization of
the pulmonary artery and its branches after injec-
tion of a radiopaque dye) is the most reliable diag-
nostic technique, but it is a complex test that
cannot be done routinely in all patients. A some-
what simpler test involves injecting extremely fine
particles of a radioactively labeled material such as
albumin into a vein and then scanning the lungs
with a radiation detector while the particles tra-
verse the pulmonary blood vessels.

Passage 2
Prose Fiction
(From Nicholas Nickleby by Charles Dickens)
This was a young lady who could be scarcely
eighteen, of very slight and delicate figure, but
exquisitely shaped, who, walking timidly up to the
desk, made an inquiry, in a very low tone of voice,
relative to some situation as governess, or compan-
ion to a lady. She raised her veil, for an instant,
while she preferred the inquiry, and disclosed a
countenance of most uncommon beauty, though
shaded by a cloud of sadness, which, in one so
young, was doubly remarkable. Having received a
card of reference to some person on the books, she
made the usual acknowledgment, and glided away.
She was neatly, but very quietly attired; so
much so, indeed, that it seemed as though her
dress, if it had been worn by one who imparted
fewer graces of her own to it, might have looked
poor and shabby. Her attendant — for she had 
one — was a red-faced, round-eyed slovenly girl,
who, from a certain roughness about the bare arms
that peeped from under her draggled shawl, and
the half-washed-out-traces of smut and blacklead
which tattooed her countenance, was clearly of 
a kin with the servant-of-all-work on the farm:
between whom and herself there had passed 
various grins and glances, indicative of the 
freemasonry of the craft.
The girl followed her mistress; and before
Nicholas had recovered from the first effect of his
surprise and admiration, the young lady was gone. It
is not a matter of such utter improbability as some
sober people may think, that he would have fol-
lowed them out, had he not been restrained by what
passed between the fat lady and her bookkeeper.
“When is she coming again, Tom?” asked the fat
lady.
“Tomorrow morning,” replied Tom, mending
his pen.
“Where have you sent her to?” asked the fat
lady.
“Mrs. Clark’s,” replied Tom.
“She’ll have a nice life of it, if she goes there,”
observed the fat lady, taking a pinch of snuff from a
tin box.
Tom made no other reply than thrusting his
tongue into his cheek, and pointing the feather of
his pen towards Nicholas — reminders which
elicited from the fat lady an inquiry of, “Now, sir,
what can we do for you?”
Nicholas briefly replied, that he wanted to
know whether there was any such post to be had,
as secretary or amanuensis to a gentleman.
“Any such!” rejoined the mistress; “a dozen
such. An’t there, Tom?”
“I should think so,” answered that young gentle-
man; and as he said it, he winked towards Nicholas
with a degree of familiarity which he, no doubt,
intended for a rather flattering compliment, 
but with which Nicholas was most ungratefully 
disgusted.
Upon reference to the book, it appeared that
the dozen secretaryships had dwindled down to
one. Mr. Gregsbury, of Manchester Buildings,
Westminster, wanted a young man, to keep his
papers and correspondence in order; and Nicholas
was exactly the sort of young man that Mr.
Gregsbury wanted.
“I don’t know what the terms are, as he said
he’d settle them himself with the party,” observed
the fat lady; “but they must be pretty good ones,
because he’s a member of Parliament.”
Inexperienced as he was, Nicholas did not feel
quite assured in the face of this reasoning, or the
justice of this conclusion; but without troubling
himself to question it, he took down the address,
and resolved to wait upon Mr. Gregsbury without
delay.
“I don’t know what the number is, “said Tom,
“but Manchester Buildings isn’t a large place; and if
the worst comes to worst, it won’t take you very
long to knock at all the doors on both sides of the
way till you find him out. I say, what a good-looking
girl that was, wasn’t she?”
“What girl?” demanded Nicholas sternly.
“Oh yes. I know — what gal, eh?” whispered
Tom, shutting one eye, and cocking his chin in the
air. “You didn’t see her, you didn’t — I say, don’t
you wish you was me, when she comes tomorrow
morning?”

Nicholas looked at the ugly clerk, as if he had a
mind to reward his admiration of the young lady by
beating the ledger about his ears, but he refrained
and strode haughtily out of the office; setting at
defiance, in his indignation, those ancient laws of
chivalry, which not only made it proper and lawful
for all good knights to hear the praise of the ladies
to whom they were devoted, but rendered it incum-
bent upon them to roam about the world, and
knock on the head all such matter-of-fact and unpo-

Passage 3
Natural Science
Tales abound of the large snake of Trinidad,
Surinam, and Bolivia known as the bushmaster. The
bushmaster, found primarily in South and Central
America, is the largest venomous (poisonous)
snake in the New World. The names of this snake
tell much about it. The Latin name of the bushmas-
ter is Lachesis muta. The Lachesis comes from
Greek mythology, and refers to one of the three
Fates. The Greeks believed that the Fates were
women who determined how long the “string” of a
person’s life would be. When the Fates cut the
string, the person’s life would cease. The bite of the
Lachesis muta, the bushmaster snake, can indeed
kill. It has been known to kill even humans
(although the actual death or injury may come from
the bacteria on the snake’s fangs, rather than from
the venom itself). The muta part of the name is sim-
ilar to our common word mute, and derives from
the fact that although the snake shakes its tail — as
does the rattlesnake, to which it is related — when
it senses danger, because there are no rattles on the
bushmaster’s tail, no noise is made.
A second name for the bushmaster is concha
pita, meaning pineapple tail. This name reflects the
fact that the snake is covered in raised scales. The
bushmaster can vary in color (most frequently in
shades of brown), but is often tan with dark brown
markings in the shape of diamonds. The snake’s col-
oring serves as an excellent camouflage in the
forests where it lies. Bushmasters are usually soli-
tary animals, coming together only during breeding.
After breeding, the bushmaster female lays up to 12
eggs in a group called a clutch. While the eggs are
in the clutch, the bushmaster exhibits a strong
maternal instinct, coiling around and protecting the
eggs. This maternal instinct is quite rare among rep-
tiles. When the eggs hatch — usually in two to three
months — the young are immediately capable of
survival on their own.
The bushmaster is a type of pit viper. The “pit”
in the snake’s name comes from the fact that it has
a hollow pit close to the eye. The pit is covered by
skin to protect it. The purpose of the pit is to sense
heat. The heat is given off by the bushmaster’s
prey, which consists of warm-blooded animals. The
most common prey of the pit viper is a rodent.
Usually, a viper will bite its prey, then retreat, let-
ting the venom do the actual killing of the smaller
animal. Should the animal wander away during its
death throes, the bushmaster can follow the
animal’s scent to find it later. Some bushmasters,
however, bite their prey, then hold their fangs in the
animal, often lifting it off the ground. Bushmasters

can patiently stalk their prey, hiding under the
leaves or trees of the forest and waiting for the prey
to pass. For this reason, some scientists refer to
bushmasters as ambush predators.
The bushmaster itself has few enemies. Some
larger species of snakes that are not susceptible to
the pit viper’s venom, such as certain constrictors,
can feed on the bushmaster. And like all snakes, the
bushmaster may be attacked by the large birds of
prey. However, in the final analysis, the greatest foe
of the snake is encroaching civilization. More and
more of the animal’s habitat — forests that until
recently were considered remote and uninhabitable
by humans — is being cleared. The bushmaster,
while not an endangered species, is undergoing an
alarming decline in numbers.
Some think that the bushmaster’s reputation
for ferocity is misplaced. True, the animal is daunt-
ing by its sheer size. Some can reach lengths of 12
feet. However, except when hunting or attempting
to breed, bushmasters are relatively placid, unag-
gressive creatures. Most of the injuries reported
from bushmasters occurred when hikers acciden-
tally stepped on drowsing snakes (whose col-
oration and silent warning system rarely alert
humans to the snake’s presence). They are noctur-
nal, and thus more aggressive at night than in the
daytime.

Passage 4
Social Science
Symbolism in architecture is often overlooked
by those who simply enjoy the beauty of the build-
ings. The United States Capitol is one such example
of a building that is rarely examined more than
superficially, yet has a wealth of symbols of interest
to the American people. Starting off with one small
wing in 1800, the Capitol has been the site of the
inauguration of most of the presidents since
Thomas Jefferson in 1801. Abraham Lincoln’s 
inaugural took place under scaffolding of increased
construction in 1861. During Lincoln’s term, he
responded to critics who complained about the
cost of the construction by saying that the Capitol
is a symbol of the unity of the nation, and that 
“if people see the Capitol going on, it is a sign we
intend the Union shall go on.” Lincoln may be said
to have begun and ended his presidency in the
Capitol: His body lay in state in the Rotunda after
his 1865 assassination.
Farmers are symbolically represented by the
products depicted on columns in the original
Senate wing, including corn and tobacco. (One pon-
ders the fact that the sculptors hired to create such
American symbols came from abroad.) Of course,
some architectural items are more overt than sym-
bolic, such as the Statue of Freedom that is atop the
Capitol dome. On the base of the statue is incised
“E Pluribus Unum,” which is Latin for “Out of many,
one,” and is also found on the Great Seal of the
United States.
In 1814, the British, fighting the war of 1812,
captured Washington and set fire to most of its
buildings, including the Capitol. While there was
much damage inflicted upon the building, including
the gutting of the interiors and the scarring of exte-
riors, there was not complete destruction during
the conflagration because of a fortuitous rainstorm
that hit Washington that evening. It was followed
the next day by a windstorm that killed British 
officers and set off gunpowder explosions and
destroyed houses. The British officers decided to
retreat and the Capitol was spared.
One of the most striking features of the Capitol
is its collection of artworks. Most tell a story about
American history; some also present interesting
facts about their artists. Samuel Morse, before he
invented the telegraph for which he is best known,
was a painter. He painted a night session of the
House that featured each individual member, 
having painstakingly convinced each member to sit
for him in order that he could get the likeness cor-
rect. A painting of the Marquis de Lafayette (who,
incidentally, was the first foreign visitor to speak
before a Joint Meeting of Congress) hangs in the
House. Paintings trace the expansion of the country
as well. An Emanuel Leutze 1862 painting called
“Westward the Course of Empire takes Its Way”
showed pioneers crossing a divide. And it’s not just
paintings that portray American history. A Thomas
Crawford bronze door shows Washington saying
goodbye in New York to his officers. The frieze on
the Rotunda depicts William Penn’s treaty with 
the Indians. Statues abound, including, perhaps
surprisingly, one of a Confederate general, Floridian
Edmund Kirby Smith. Women are remembered as
well. Amusingly nicknamed “Women in a Bathtub,”
an eight-ton block of marble honors a trio of suffra-
gettes: Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony,
and Lucretia Mott. Also found are statues of Ethan
Allen, the Revolutionary War hero from Vermont,
Robert Fulton, the creator of the steamboat, and
John Gorrie, M.D., a physician who patented the
first ice-cream making machine in 1851, in an
attempt to find something to cool down his fevered
patients.
31.
The primary point of the first paragraph is
A. Presidents are usually sworn into office
on the steps of the Capitol.
B.
The Capitol is over 200 years old.
C.
The Capitol holds much symbolism for
Americans.
D. A beautiful building cannot truly be
appreciated unless one understands its

Passage 1
The amount of moisture in the air is designated as humidity. Weather reports typically present relative
humidity, the percentage of the maximum amount of moisture the air can contain that is currently in the
air. Air can contain more moisture at higher temperatures than at lower temperatures.
Relative humidity can be measured by comparing the temperature reading on a wet-bulb thermometer
with the reading on a dry-bulb thermometer. Less humid air causes more moisture to evaporate from the wet
bulb, thus lowering the temperature reading. Table 1 shows the relative humidity that is calculated at various
air temperatures (dry-bulb) as a function of the difference between the wet-bulb and dry-bulb readings.

Humid air feels warmer to a human than does dry air at the same temperature because the moisture in
the air makes it harder for the human body to cool itself by evaporating water from its body. Table 2 shows
what various temperatures feel like to a typical human at different relative humidities.

Passage 2
A pharmaceutical company has developed a
new drug for treating hay fever. It claims that the
new drug causes less drowsiness than the current
best-selling brand. To test this claim, the company
ran the following three studies.
Study 1
Subjects were asked to perform a motor coordi-
nation task that requires a high degree of alertness.
Subjects who made fewer errors were judged to be
less drowsy. Eight subjects were given a standard
dosage of the new drug, and eight other subjects
were given a standard dosage of the old drug. Four
persons of each group of eight were tested one
hour after ingesting the drug while the other four
persons were tested eight hours after ingesting the
drug. Realizing that drug effects often depend on a
subject’s weight, the researchers weighed each sub-
ject who participated in the study. The number of
errors and weights for each subject are presented in
Table 1.

Which of the following is the most reasonable
conclusion that can be made on the basis of
Study 1?
F.
The new drug is more effective than the
old drug one hour after ingestion but not
eight hours after ingestion.
G. Performance on the motor coordination
task deteriorates as time after ingestion
of the old drug increases.
H. As compared to the old drug, the new
drug improved the ability of experimental
subjects to perform the motor coordina-
tion task.
J.
The new drug causes less drowsiness
than the old drug one hour after ingestion
but not eight hours after ingestion.
7.
Which of the following best summarizes why
the researchers conducted Studies 2 and 3?
A. They wished to examine the effects of
weight on drowsiness produced by the
drug.
B.
They were interested in whether the drug
would affect men and women differently.
C.
They wanted to eliminate a factor that
caused variability in the results.
D. Most people who suffer from hay fever
weigh approximately what the subjects in
those studies weighed.
8.
In comparison to Study 1, what is a primary
limitation of Study 2?
F.
Study 2 does not measure the effects of
the drugs on females.
G. Study 1 suggests that the new drug 
may be more effective for a variety of
subjects.
H. Study 1 shows that the new drug caused
less drowsiness in a wider range of 
subjects.
J.
Study 2 produced results that were more
difficult to interpret.

10.
Suppose that further study revealed that the
group of subjects given the old drug and
tested at eight hours in Study 1 was, under
normal conditions, particularly proficient at
performing the motor coordination task. How
would this finding affect the overall results of
the study?
F.
It would add evidence that the new drug
causes less drowsiness than the old drug
at eight hours after ingestion.
G. It would suggest that side effects associ-
ated with the old drug are more common
eight hours after ingesting the drug than
at only one hour after ingestion.
H. It would suggest that the new drug is
more effective than the old drug at any
time after ingestion.
J.
It would require that the entire experi-
ment be repeated with the same subjects
being tested at both one hour and eight
hours.
11.
If later studies show that the new drug is at
least as effective as the old drug in relieving
hay fever and that the new drug produces no
side effects other than drowsiness, would it
be reasonable to recommend the new drug
over the old drug to lightweight individuals
suffering from hay fever?
A. Yes, but only if such individuals are given
a lower dose than what was used in the
current three studies.
B.
Yes, because the evidence supports the
claim that the new drug is at least as
effective and produces less drowsiness.
C.
No, because the individuals may operate
dangerous machinery within eight hours
after ingesting the drug.
D.
No, because the new drug differs from the
old system with regard to how it affects
the immune system, which is responsible
for hay fever.
Passage 3
A wide beach protects bluffs by spreading out
the energy of waves and keeping them from eroding
the soil and rocks that comprise the bluff (see
Figure 1).
Figure 1: Simplified illustration of waves hitting a wide beach.
When water levels rise, bluffs are vulnerable to
erosion because much of the beach is now under-
water, and the bluffs now bear the brunt of the
waves’ force (see Figure 2).
Figure 2: Simplified illustration of waves hitting a bluff when
water level rises above beach.
To gain a better understanding of how natural
forces can affect future water levels and bluff ero-
sion, scientists studied the relationship between
some key meteorological factors and water depth
(deeper water means a higher water level) near the
shore of an inland lake.
Study 1
Scientists measured precipitation and lake depth
over a 30-year period and plotted the average depth
against annual precipitation, as shown in Figure 3.

Study 2
Because temperature affects water evaporation
rate and a higher evaporation rate lowers water
levels, scientists plotted the average depth against
the mean annual temperature. This relationship is
shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4: The average depth versus the mean annual 
temperature.
Study 3
Wind is another factor that affects water evapo-
ration rate, so scientists plotted the average depth
against wind speed, as shown in Figure 5.

Passage 4
The use of gasoline is directly related to the
number of pollutants, such as hydrocarbons,
nitrous oxide, and carbon monoxide, present in the
air. As a result, drivers should take steps to mini-
mize their gasoline consumption. One way to
reduce this consumption is to drive at slower
speeds. Figure 1 shows how gasoline mileage is
affected by freeway driving speeds.

You are in the desert with no gas in sight, and
your gas gauge shows that you have very little
gas left. Should you speed up to get to your
destination?
A. No, because you use more gas at a higher
speed.
B.
No, because you need more time to find a
gas station.
C.
Yes, because the desert has very little
pollution.

B.
Gas mileage is about 50 miles per gallon
because gas mileage increases eight miles
per gallon for every 10 mph increase in
speed.
C.
Gas mileage is about 80 miles per gallon

Passage 5
From stimulating the brains of patients under-
going neurosurgery, scientists have determined
that a strip of the brain just in front of the central
sulcus controls the motor neurons throughout the
body. That is, this part of the brain controls the
neurons that control the voluntary muscles. This
motor area is illustrated in Figure 1.
Figure 1: Side view of the brain.
Further work has mapped out the specific parts
of this motor area that control certain parts of the
body. The regions of the left half of the brain, which
controls the right side of the body, are illustrated in
Figure 2. The right side of the brain, which controls
the left side of the body and is not illustrated,

Passage 6
Homing pigeons received their name because of
their ability to find their way home even when they
are hundreds of kilometers away. Scientists know
that pigeons do not use visible landmarks to navi-
gate, because the birds can find their way home even
after they have been transported in a covered box
and released in an unfamiliar area. Scientists have
offered several explanations for this acute naviga-
tional ability. Following are two of these hypotheses.
Sun Compass
Pigeons use the sun as a compass to orient
themselves. Evidence for this theory comes from
an experiment in which pigeons were placed in 
a circular cage with identical food cups evenly
spaced just outside the cage. After being trained 
to go to the cup due east of the cage’s center,
pigeons were observed to go to the same cup 
even after the cage was rotated and the back-
ground scenery was changed. Pigeons failed to 
go to the east cup when the skies were overcast 
or when the experimenters used mirrors to alter
the apparent position of the sun.
The pigeons use their internal clocks in con-
junction with the sun to find their way home. For
example, if the internal clock of a pigeon indicates
noon while the bird observes the sun about to set,
the pigeon knows that it is far east of its home and
Left half

220
Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: Full-Length Practice ACTs 
flies west to get there. A northern hemisphere bird
that is due south of home at noon sees that the sun
is in the correct position as far as east and west are
concerned but observes that the sun is higher in
the sky than normal and therefore flies north to get
home. Support for this mechanism comes from
observing birds whose internal clocks have been
experimentally shifted. Their orientation, with
respect to the sun, is consistent with their internal
clock, but because the clock is off, the pigeons fly in
the wrong direction.
Magnetic Field
Pigeons do not rely on a sun-internal clock cal-
culation to orient themselves. Clock-shifted birds
are just as accurate and fast as normal birds at find-
ing their way home on overcast days.
Disruptions in the magnetic field surrounding
the birds, on the other hand, affect the birds’ orien-
tation under such conditions. When bar magnets
are placed on pigeons, they fly in random directions
on overcast days. Similar results were obtained
when scientists used electrical wires to induce an
electrical field in a particular direction. When the
wires induced a magnetic field that pointed up
through the birds’ heads, the pigeons flew away
from home. When the field pointed in the opposite
direction, the birds flew toward home. These find-
ings, along with the discovery that pigeons are
capable of responding to a magnetic field much
weaker than that of earth, indicate that pigeons use
the earth’s magnetic field for orientation.
28.
According to the sun-compass hypothesis,
how would the pigeons with the disrupted
magnetic fields orient on a sunny day?
F.
They would fly in random directions.
G. They would fly toward home.
H. They would fly in a direction that is a
compromise between the information
provided by the magnetic field and the
information provided by the sun.
J.
They would fly straight but in a direction
away from home.
29.
Scientists have found that large disturbances
in the earth’s magnetic field affect the pigeons’
flight direction on sunny days. Which of the
following is the most reasonable statement
that can be made on the basis of this finding?
A. The sun-compass hypothesis is false.
B.
Pigeons don’t use the sun for orientation.
C.
The Earth’s magnetic field is the only
factor that affects pigeon navigation.
D. The finding supports the magnetic-field
hypothesis.
Go on to next page
30.
Which finding presented in the passage is
consistent with the sun-compass hypothesis
but inconsistent with the magnetic-field
hypothesis?
F.
The caged pigeons don’t fly to the right
cup on overcast days.
G. The clock-shifted pigeons fly the wrong
way on a sunny day.
H. The clock-shifted pigeons fly home on an
overcast day.
J.
Magnetic-field disturbances affect pigeon
navigation.
31.
The author of the magnetic-field hypothesis
assumes that
A. pigeons with magnets are not affected by
the mere presence of metal.
B.
magnets have absolutely no effect on
pigeons on sunny days.
C.
no birds use internal clocks to navigate.
D. pigeons do not use the sun to navigate.
32.
According to the entire passage, which of the
following statements are most reasonable to
make regarding clock-shifted pigeons that are
placed at their home?
I.
They will fly away from their home on a
sunny day because the clock-sun calcula-
tion will indicate that they are away from
home.
II.
They will stay home on a sunny day
because they will recognize familiar 
landmarks.
III. They will stay home on an overcast day
because the magnetic field will indicate
that they are home.
F.
I and II only
G. I and III only
H. II and III only
J.
I, II, and III
33.
Some evidence indicates that homing pigeons
can use barometric pressure to navigate. How
does this evidence relate to the sun-compass
and magnetic-field hypotheses?
A. This evidence disproves both hypotheses.
B.
This evidence is inconsistent with both
hypotheses.
C.
This evidence is consistent with the sun-
compass hypothesis but inconsistent
with the magnetic-field hypothesis.
D. This evidence may be consistent with
both hypotheses.

34.
Research shows that pigeons can orient to
light that mimics conditions present on a par-
tially overcast day in which blue sky is pres-
ent but the sun’s disk is blocked. If
clock-shifted pigeons navigate home on such
a day, which hypothesis is supported?
F.
Sun-compass, because the pigeons
responded correctly to the light.
G. Sun-compass, because the sun was
blocked.
H. Magnetic-field, because the pigeons
responded correctly to the light.
J.
Magnetic-field, because the internal clock
shift did not throw the birds off.
Passage 7
A typical chemical reaction can be represented
A + B →AB. A and B are reactants that react to
form product AB.
Chemists have measured the rate at which vari-
ous products of reactions are formed and have
found that the rate varies with the concentration of
the reactants. For example, when the concentration
of reactant A is doubled, the rate of formation of
product AB may change, depending on the nature
of the chemical reaction. The rate can remain the
same, double, quadruple, or change in other ways.
The concentration of reactant B affects the rate of
product formation, but reactant B’s effect can be
different from that of reactant A. For example, you
can have a reaction in which doubling the concen-
tration of A doubles the rate of product formation,
while doubling B’s concentration quadruples the
rate.
To learn more about the chemical reaction
H3AsO4 + 3I– + 2H+ →H3AsO3 + I3– + H2O, scientists
ran a series of experiments to determine how the
concentration of each reactant affects the rate of
formation of the product H3AsO3.
Experiment 1
Scientists combined 0.01 moles of H3AsO4, 0.20
moles of I–, and 0.10 moles of H+ in a liter of solu-
tion. H3AsO3 was formed at the rate of 2.8 units.
Scientists repeated the reaction three times, using
different amounts of H3AsO4 each time. The results
are summarized in Table 1.

Score One for Our Side: The Scoring Key
The ACT scoring may be weird (Why a 36? Why not a 21 or a 49 or a 73?), but it is very
straightforward. Follow the simple directions below to score your practice exam.
1. Count the number of correct responses in each of the practice tests: English,
Mathematics, Reading, and Science Reasoning (see the Answer Key at the end of this
chapter).
Do NOT subtract any points for questions you missed or questions you didn’t answer.
Your score is based only on the number of questions you answered correctly. That
number is called your raw score.
2. Locate your raw score on the following table. Move to the left or right and find the
scaled score that corresponds to your raw score.
For example, a raw score of 50 on the English Test gives you a scaled score of 21.
3. Add your four scaled scores. Divide that sum by 4. The resulting number is your
composite score.
For example, say that your scaled scores were 23, 31, 12, and 19; your composite score
would be 85 ÷ 4 = 21.25 or 21.

Chapter 19: How to Ruin a Perfectly Good Day, Part I: Practice Exam 1
Three of the tests of the ACT feature subscores as
an added bonus (think of these as a “gift with pur-
chase”). In 20-plus years of tutoring for the ACT (I
started when I was a mere child, you see), few stu-
dents have cared about the subscores. By the time
you get through with this book, you should pretty
much know which sections are your best and which
are your weakest. However, you’ll see subscores on
your score report, so a few words about them are
necessary.
English Test
The English Test has 40 questions in the Usage/
Mechanics subscore area, and 35 questions in the
Rhetorical Skills subscore area — a total of 75 ques-
tions. (See Chapter 5 for more info on the types of
questions on the English Test.) Because I wrote
these practice exams to give you more practice with
the types of questions my experience shows stu-
dents have the best chance of getting correct with
practice, this breakdown isn’t really applicable to
the practice exams in this book. Besides, students
get headaches trying to understand the fine distinc-
tions between what is rhetorical and what is not.
Don’t worry about it.
Mathematics Test
The actual ACT Mathematics Test usually has 24
prealgebra/elementary algebra problems, 18 inter-
mediate algebra/coordinate geometry problems,
and 18 plane geometry/trig problems — a total of 60
questions. Good news! The ACT has only four trig
questions, so if you haven’t had the subject yet,
don’t panic!
However, because this book is a teaching book and
not the actual ACT, I’m not going to put you through
the trauma of subscores. Besides, there are many
gray areas in which one person is convinced that a
problem is elementary algebra but another argues
it’s intermediate algebra, or worse. Here’s the
simple solution: Be able to do all the problems
(easy for me to say!), and don’t worry about type-
casting and labeling them.
Reading Test
The Reading Test subscores couldn’t possibly be
any easier. You get a subscore for questions in
social studies/sciences (20 questions, based on two
passages) and arts/literature (20 questions, based
on two passages).
Science Reasoning Test
The Science Reasoning test has no subscores.

Practice Exam 1: Answers 
and Explanations
N
ow you’ve done it. You’ve completed the practice exam, checked your answers
against the key, and found your score on the Raw Score chart.
Hang on! Invest another hour or so to go through this chapter, reading why one answer was
correct and the others weren’t. Along the way, you find zillions of tips and traps, valuable
information that you can use when you face the Big One.
Keep in mind that any words marked like this are vocabulary words to add to your vocabu-
lary list.
English Test
If you want highly technical explanations discussing the future pluperfect and subordinate
subjunctive, you’re in the wrong place. We’ve written these explanations for real people, not
for grammarians. The explanations put things in terms of everyday speech, not textbook
rules and regulations.
Passage 1
1. B. The easy way to choose between “me” and “I” is to ignore the other person. That is,
read the sentence as, “My mother took I to the zoo.” You would never say that; you
would say, “My mother took me to the zoo.” Choice D is incorrect because the other
person needs to come before the “me.”
2. J. The original has two subjects, the zoo and the it. Use only one. The pronoun which
changes the second part of the sentence to a subordinate clause (one that can’t stand
on its own) and eliminates the run-on problem of choice G.
3. B. The original sentence is a fragment, an incomplete sentence. Use choice B to express
a complete thought.
Did you notice the dreaded word “being” in choice C? Being often indicates sloppy
English; you need to be especially careful when you see this word, because it usually
(not always) indicates a wrong answer.
4. H. Among compares more than two items; between compares exactly two. (As a way to
remember this, note the tw in between and the tw in two.) Here, the sentence compares
the giraffe and the zebra, two animals, requiring the word “between.”
If you chose J, you got careless and didn’t reread the sentence with your answer
inserted. This final step can catch awkward sentences and save you a lot of points.
5. A. This was a pretty hard question; pat yourself on the back if you got it right. Latter is
an -er form, and compares two items. Here, the sentence compares just two animals,
the giraffe and the zebra. The word last is an -st form and compares three or more
items. (If you missed this question, flip to Chapter 4.)

6. J. The original sentence is a fragment, an incomplete sentence. It just hangs in the air,
not expressing a completed thought. (You find yourself asking, “Well, what about the
keeper?”)
Did you double-check the -ing verbs, “coming” and “noticing,” in choices F, G, and H?
Although not all -ing words are wrong, they are wrong often enough on this exam to
make you very, very nervous. Always look suspiciously at -ing verbs.
7. A. A double negative is a positive in English, just as it is in math. “Not inappropriate”
means “appropriate.” From the rest of the passage, you learn that a name meaning
“tallest of all” is appropriate, given that the giraffe is the tallest animal.
In some other languages, such as Spanish, a double negative does not make a positive
and may not change the meaning of the sentence (as the double negative in this exam-
ple does). Those of you who speak languages other than English need to be especially
careful not to make a mistake with double negatives.
8. G. If you chose F, you probably have what we call Smart Students Disease: You auto-
matically, instinctively corrected the error in the sentence. Go back and look at the
original, and you’ll notice that it’s missing the verb.
If you find that you have a lot of NO CHANGE answers, you’re probably suffering from
this insidious disease (too many brain cells can be as big of a problem as too few!). If
you have a few minutes left at the end of the section, go back and check all your NO
CHANGE answers to be sure that you didn’t correct the errors in your head but not on
paper.
9. B. Always, always, always check what it refers to. In this case, it (singular) refers to the
scientists (plural). You need to use a plural pronoun to refer to a plural noun: they.
Choice C doesn’t fit when reinserted into the sentence.
10. F. The correct formation is “from . . . to,” not “from . . . and” or “between . . . to.” Choice
J changes the meaning of the sentence.
11. B. The word “being” is often wrong on this exam. The expression “being that” is very
sloppy grammar. Use “which” to express the same thought. Choice D is the trap answer.
Don’t fall into the habit of choosing OMIT every time you see it. (Subconsciously, you
may want to omit the whole darn exam, but that doesn’t count!) Take a minute to
reread how the sentence would work without the underlined portion.
12. F. Well is an adverb and answers the question “how?” How does the giraffe blend in? It
blends in well. If you chose G, see Chapter 4 for information on good versus well. If you
chose H or J, you changed the meaning of the sentence. A good general rule is to cor-
rect the error, and then get outta there. In other words, don’t do any more work, or
make any more changes, than absolutely necessary.
13. D. The sentence talks about how different the markings of giraffes are, which is the
topic of the third paragraph.
This type of question is considered by many students to be more like the Reading Test
than English Usage. It requires you to go back and reread most of the passage. If you
are rushed for time (and most of us are in this section), our suggestion is that you
“guess and go,” making a quick guess and hoping you can come back to think more
about the problem later. (Be sure not to leave the answer entirely blank. Remember:
The ACT has no penalty for wrong answers. Even a wild guess may be correct.)
14. F. The subject of the verb is “the theory,” which is singular, requiring the singular verb
has. If you thought that “markings” or “fingerprints” was the subject of the sentence,
you missed the point.
15. A. The last paragraph talks about how unique the giraffes are, how their markings dis-
tinguish them from each other. Choices B and C are tricky. Yes, the last paragraph talks
about how giraffes have different colors and blend in well with their surroundings, but
it doesn’t say anything about their evolving. Don’t read too much into the paragraph.
And choice D may be true, but just because a statement is true does not mean that it is
the answer to that specific question.

Passage 2
16. G. The original sounds as if Mr. Haley were a magician who changed a person into 
a book! The sentence means to say that stories about people were put into a book.
Choice H has the same problem as the original, converting people into books. Choice J
makes absolutely no sense when inserted into the sentence.
17. D. This question should have been a very simple one. Who’s means who is, as in,
“Who’s going to miss a question this easy?” The correct word is whose, which is the
possessive of who. I want to know whose grammar skills are so weak he missed this
question.
There is no such word as “whos’.” The only place we can imagine that word is in the 
Dr. Seuss book, Horton Hears a Who. The plural of one Who, we suppose, would be two
Whos, and they could own something. But if you find yourself thinking of Dr. Seuss sto-
ries in the middle of this exam, you’re someone whose score is going to be a lot lower
than that of someone who’s concentrating on what he’s doing.
18. H. The original sounds as though the early years were born in New York, when obvi-
ously it was Alex who was born there. When a sentence begins with a subordinate
clause (a clause that can’t stand by itself), the first noun or pronoun after the comma
usually has to do the action of that clause. In this case, start the underlined portion
with Alex, eliminating choices F and J. Choice G is tricky. It starts with Alex . . . , or does
it? It actually starts with Alex’s years, again sounding as if the years were born in New
York. Also, choice G is passive voice — rarely preferable to the active voice.
19. D. The original is a sentence fragment, an incomplete sentence: The oldest of three
sons. . . . Who was the oldest of three sons? The sentence is missing a subject. Predict
that you need the second sentence to start with Alex, and you have the right answer
quickly.
Choices B and (especially) C look good on their own, but when you plug them back
into the sentence, they don’t correct the error.
20. G. To many students, this question seems to be more like a Reading Test question than
strictly a grammar question. The fact that Alex was the oldest of three sons doesn’t
mean much in the context of the passage. His brothers are never again mentioned, nor
is it mentioned whether his family situation influenced him or his writing. In short, the
line just dies. It goes nowhere. It can safely be eliminated because it doesn’t do any-
thing to spur on the writing in the passage.
21. D. The underlined portion does not fit with the rest of the paragraph, which discusses
Alex’s military career. Although the route Alex took to become a writer is discussed,
his motivation is not.
22. F. The sentence is correct as written. Did you double-check that the first noun after the
subordinate clause did the action of the clause? “Unchallenged by his daily routine in
the U.S. Coast Guard, Haley. . . .” Haley is the one who was unchallenged. Often the first
noun after the subordinate clause is wrong, making a nonsense sentence, such as, “When
she was two, the fortune-teller predicted Ms. Ferraro would be president.” Chances are,
it was Ms. Ferraro who was two at the time of the prediction, not the fortune-teller.
Rearrange the sentence to read, “When she was two, Ms. Ferraro was told. . . .”
23. A. “Eventually his articles were published” makes sense. The other answers change the
meaning of the sentence. Did you note the correct spelling of “nonetheless” in choice
D? Nonetheless is all one word. (Do you care? My best friend is so rabidly antispelling
that she has a sign on her desk that says, “Misspellers of the world, untie!”)
24. F. “Afforded him an opportunity” is a correct expression. Note that choice G would
have been correct had it said “allowed” rather than “allow.” Choices H and J would
have been correct had the passage said “enabled him to gain an opportunity” or “gave
him an opportunity.” Be careful not to rewrite the answer choices, unconsciously sup-
plying words that are not actually printed on the paper.
229
Chapter 20: Practice Exam 1: Answers and Explanations

25. D. The traveling and the research were done at the same time, eliminating choice B.
Choice C sounds as if the research did the traveling, whereas it was Mr. Haley who
actually traveled. The original version is a run-on sentence, two sentences incorrectly
joined. If you’re confused by run-ons, go to Chapter 4 to discover the four ways to cor-
rect them.
26. H. The original sounds as though the ancestors went to a small village, whereas Mr.
Haley went to the village. Choice G and choice J are incorrect because they are present
tense. The research occurred in the past, requiring the past tense: took.
Verb mistakes are among the most common errors in the English portion of the ACT.
Verbs may be in the wrong number (singular versus plural) or the wrong tense. Always
double-check the verb.
27. B. If you chose A, you read this too quickly. “After Haley . . . then he knew. . . .” You do
not need both the word “after” and the word “then.” Choice B eliminates the unneces-
sary “then.”
If two answer choices appear to be identical, one probably adds or deletes the critical
word and is the correct answer choice. If you are confused, choose one of those two.
(Always keep in mind: The ACT has no penalty for wrong answers. Feel free to guess
anytime you’re not sure of the correct answer.)
28. G. Do you remember the point tested with the formation “not only . . . but also”? The
rule (covered in Chapter 4, in case you’ve forgotten) is that “not only” and “but also”
must be in parallel positions in the sentence. In other words, if “not only” is in front of
a noun, “but also” must be in front of a noun. This question is even a little trickier than
that. “Not only” is in front of “the Haley family” which is the object, but “but also” is in
front of “the story” which is the subject. Change this sentence to read as follows: was
not only the saga . . . but also the story.
You should have buzzers and alarms going off in your brain whenever you encounter
one of the terrible twosomes. Diction questions, although not automatically wrong,
need to be checked carefully. As I often say, “Sure, I’m paranoid . . . but am I paranoid
enough?”
29. C. The passage gives an overview of Haley’s history and how he came to write Roots.
However, it doesn’t analyze, or even mention, any other work. The reader gains no
insight into Haley’s ability, just into his background.
Passage 3
30. H. Verbs in a series must be in parallel, or similar form. You need to say, discuss . . .
rule . . . dine.
Verbs ending in -ing are often used incorrectly. Be very, very suspicious when you 
see one.
31. C. The original version is a sentence fragment, an incomplete sentence. Choice C makes
the sentence logical and coherent. Choice B is grammatically correct, but is in the 
passive voice. In standard written English, the active voice is preferable (confused on
these two? Flip to Chapter 4 and enlarge your brilliance). Choice B is put there to trap
lazy students, who read until they find a “good enough” answer instead of reading all
the choices and selecting the best one. Choice D would leave the sentence as a fragment.
Bonus trivia: Speaking of outer space, did you hear about the new restaurant on the
moon? Great food, no atmosphere!
32. J. The original version is a run-on, two sentences incorrectly joined. A comma splice
(two independent clauses or sentences joined by a comma) is too weak; use a semi-
colon instead. A semicolon is a kinder, gentler period, serving the same function.
Choice G changes the correct its (possessive) to the incorrect it’s (the contraction of
“it is”). Choice H may have trapped you if you didn’t invest the necessary few seconds
to plug the answer choice back into the sentence. Choice H makes the sentence read, 
“. . . on its axis and also it is also . . .” saying “also” twice.
230
Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: Full-Length Practice ACTs 

33. B. The possessive form “its” is correct here; “it’s” is the contraction of it is. (These and
other commonly confused word duos are covered in excruciating detail in Chapter 4.)
Choice C has the wrong form, “it’s.” Choice D, although using the correct form “its,”
changes the meaning of this sentence. Be careful not to change more than is necessary.
34. J. The word because is unnecessary and serves only to make the sentence longer and
more confusing (and it’s already pretty labyrinthine!).
Rewrite the entire sentence in your mind to clarify what the author is trying to say.
Then go to the answer choices and see which one best fits your own revision. Choice G
says the same thing as the original, but in a more wordy way. Choice H makes no sense
in the sentence.
35. A. The original is the best way of making the point. Choice C wouldn’t work when rein-
serted into the sentence (don’t forget to take that step). Choice B makes the sentence a
fragment, an incomplete thought. Choice D is unnecessarily wordy.
36. J. The underlined portion states the same thought that was expressed in the previous
sentence, and thus is unnecessary.
37. B. A comma indicates a pause, not a complete stop. Read the sentence aloud, and
you’ll notice that you pause for a second after “ . . . of the earth itself,” and then keep
on the same thought. A semicolon is too strong, because it connects completely inde-
pendent sentences (that is, each part before and after the semicolon must be able to
stand alone as a complete sentence). A colon is incorrect, because it introduces a list
of things to come. A period here would make what comes before it a fragment, an
incomplete sentence.
38. F. The original is correct. When separating two sentences, the proper form is semi-
colon, coordinating conjunction (such as therefore and however), comma.
If you’re confused on this, go to Chapter 4. (Don’t you wish you were like the ruler
Sigismund who said the famous line that’s quoted in all English classrooms: “I am the
King of Rome and I am above grammar.” When I was in high school, I named my dog
Sigismund in the man’s honor.)
39. D. The original version is a fragment, an incomplete sentence, as are choices B and C.
The word “being” is often used incorrectly and needs to be looked at with extreme 
suspicion.
40. J. A good writer is concise and succinct. Always look at the shortest answer to see
whether it can possibly fit. In this case, choices F, G, and H are redundant and unneces-
sarily wordy.
The word “because” is often used incorrectly. The expression “the reason is because”
is a typical redundancy.
41. B. “They” is a pronoun and must have an antecedent, a word it replaces. Who are they?
We’re not told, so we must have a noun. Choice C is too wordy. Choice D would make
the sentence a fragment.
Did you choose D automatically? Although I understand that, if you had your way,
you’d omit the entire passage and all the answers, you, alas, are not in charge here.
Omit is not correct every single time it appears; if you choose that answer, be sure to
go back and see how the new sentence would read without the underlined portion.
42. G. The easiest way to clarify this portion is to make two separate sentences. Choice H
is verbose. Choice J makes the sentence nonsense when inserted alone.
43. B. The passage discusses how time travel would require one to go backward in a
spaceship to arrive at the same time. It doesn’t state that time travel is impossible; if
you chose answer A, you were expressing your own opinion. Choice C is probably a
true statement, but is not the main idea of the passage.
231
Chapter 20: Practice Exam 1: Answers and Explanations

Just because a statement is correct or is a fact, doesn’t mean it’s the answer to the ques-
tion. “Lincoln is the capital of Nebraska” is a fact, but it doesn’t answer this question.
Choice D was mentioned briefly in the first paragraph, but is not the main idea of the
entire passage.
Passage 4
44. F. The past tense, “have called,” is correct in this sentence because the burrows were
found previously. Choice G has an -ing word. As you probably remember, -ing words 
are often misused and abused in this portion of the exam. Choices J and H change the
meaning of the sentence; they sound as if the scientists themselves were called “dirt
corkscrews.”
45. C. The correct expression is “since the time they were found,” meaning from that time
on. The other answers make no sense when reinserted into the sentence.
If you’re running out of time (a definite possibility by this point in the exam), search for
a one-word question like this. You can answer such a question very quickly. All ques-
tions count the same; it’s logical to head for the short ones first.
46. J. Choices F and H are redundant: They both have “at that time” and “then.” Choice G
creates a clause without a noun: “There were at that time scientists thought. . . .” A who
is missing.
Have you noticed how often the shortest answer is the correct answer? Although you
can’t automatically assume that the shortest answer is always correct, check it out
carefully.
47. A. This question tests a little reading comprehension rather than pure grammar. The
previous and the subsequent sentences make it clear that the passage is talking about
corkscrew spirals or holes in the ground. Choices B and C make no sense when rein-
serted in the sentence. Choice D has no antecedent (the noun which the pronoun is
replacing). What is “it”? Remember, it is one of the Beware! words that you were cau-
tioned to examine carefully.
48. J. “But” and “however” serve the same function in this sentence. Both words are not
needed; eliminate the underlined one. Choices G and H do not fit when reinserted into
the sentence.
Are you remembering to reinsert your answer choices and reread the entire sentence?
If not, you are probably falling for some traps.
49. B. The “been” is a form of “being,” one of the beware! words, words that should imme-
diately capture your attention. On this exam, “being” is frequently used incorrectly, as
it is here. Usually, you can’t substitute “been” for “is,” “are,” “was,” or “were.”
50. J. A simple comma suffices. A semicolon connects two independent clauses, clauses
that can stand on their own. You would not say as a complete sentence, “But this pred-
ator probably followed a beaver home for supper and just stayed.” The “but” usually
indicates a subordinate clause that is preceded by a comma.
Are you about ready to enter a Clinic for the Terminally Confused? Don’t worry about
the terminology. Just know that a semicolon is much stronger than a comma. If you
come to a dead stop when reading, use a semicolon. If you merely pause, use a comma.
51. B. The comma in this case is not strong enough to connect two independent sentences.
Insert a period and a capital letter to make these separate sentences. Choice D is tempt-
ing, but it is unnecessarily verbose (“because in fact”).
52. J. Their is the possessive. There is a place. (Their books are over there.) Because
“their” is already possessive, you don’t also need the possessive “burrow’s.” Choice G
looks good alone, and it fits when inserted into the sentence; but it does not make
sense with the rest of the passage.
Always be sure that your answer fits into the entire passage by checking everything,
not just the new sentence; always check a few sentences before and after it.
232
Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: Full-Length Practice ACTs 

53. B. The correct conjugation of “lie” is: lie, lay, have lain. (Doesn’t this make it easy? The
past tense of lie is lay.) The verbs to lie and to lay are often tested. Be absolutely cer-
tain that you know the distinction between them (lie has no object; lay requires an
object) and their conjugation. I discuss these verbs in more detail in Chapter 4.
54. H. Extinct means no longer in existence (you may feel about now that your brain is
extinct). Extant means in existence, able to be seen. (No matter how many times you
wish that the ACT would be extinct, it remains extant.) The sentence implies that the
animals no longer exist. Eliminate choices F and G. Omitting the underlined portion
(choice J) makes nonsense of the sentence.
Don’t fall into the bad habit of choosing the OMIT answer every time that you see it. Be
sure to reread the sentence that results when you omit the underlined words. Often,
the resulting sentence makes no sense at all.
55. B. A colon usually introduces a list of items. (Rochelle told her boyfriend, “If you want
us to stay together, you’re going to have to get a few things straight: (1) I am not to be
referred to as your ‘hot momma’; (2) any jewelry you give me cannot come from the
gumball machine; and (3) your mother is never again to call me by your former girl-
friend’s name.”) Colons rarely connect separate sentences. Choices C and D change the
meaning of the sentence.
Did you fall for the trap in Choice D? The meaning of “but most of the part” is very dif-
ferent from “however, for the most part.” The expression for the most part simply means
primarily or mostly. You might say, “I’m avoiding the traps for the most part, only miss-
ing one or two.” “For the most part” is an idiomatic expression.
56. J. Did this question trap you? If so, you probably read only the underlined portion, not
the context of the entire sentence. The original is redundant; it says the same thing
twice — “nonstop, without interruption.” Nonstop means without interruption. Use one
or the other, not both.
57. A. The local events correspond to, or are indicated by, what is shown in the sedimen-
tary record. Reflect has several meanings. Although the other answers discuss those
alternate meanings, the original is one of the correct uses.
58. G. The passage was primarily about identifying animals based on their fossils. Choice F
summarizes the first paragraph only, not the second. Choice H is much too broad; the
passage was primarily about the fossils, not what the paleontologists did with them.
Choice J is too specific. Extinction was only briefly mentioned in the second paragraph.
If you are running out of time and know that you won’t get to the grammar, try a “read-
ing comp” question at the end. To answer this question, for example, you merely had
to skim what is actually a pretty short passage. (Careful! This advice does not mean
that all “box” questions are short and easy to do. Distinguish this “content” question,
which is easy to answer, from a “structure” question, such as number 59, which is both
difficult and time-consuming.)
59. A. An ordering-the-sentences question is an excellent type of question to make a wild
guess on. (Don’t just skip it entirely. The ACT has no penalty for wrong answers, so
guessing when you don’t know the answer is always worthwhile.) Ordering-the-sentences
questions take much more time than most other question types and are somewhat sub-
jective. I have had students pound their fists on my table and scream at me, arguing that
their construction of the paragraph was preferable to mine. You can argue ’til you’re blue
in the face, but the test-makers’ interpretation is final.
If you decide to invest some time answering this type of question, start by identifying
the topic or main sentence. It usually has an introductory tone, setting up the rest of
the paragraph. Here, sentence 2, talking about changes in store, is a typical beginning
or topic sentence. Knowing that sentence 2 is first enables you to eliminate choices B
and C. You may be even more willing to guess, now that your odds are down to 50-50.
When you do an “ordering” question, try to identify the topic sentence and, if necessary,
the last sentence. Doing so is usually much easier than arranging the more generic
“filler” sentences in middle of the passage.

Passage 5
60. H. The Han Dynasty conquered the Vietnamese. Find the most succinct, concise way to
say this.
Did you notice the beware! word being? Whenever you see that word, get very nervous.
It is often used incorrectly throughout this exam.
If you chose J, you didn’t read the sentence as a whole without the underlined portion.
If you eliminate it, you see that the sentence makes no sense as written “ . . . were con-
quered, forces of China’s Han Dynasty.” The Vietnamese themselves were not Chinese
forces, but they were conquered by Chinese forces. Any time you choose to omit an
underlined portion, go back and reread the new sentence to be sure that you haven’t
changed the meaning.
61. D. The Dynasty, or rule, lasted from 111 B.C. until A.D. 939. This is almost a reading
comprehension question. Had you read the phrase “since A.D. 939” by itself, it would
seem logical. You have to read the entire sentence (and often a few sentences above or
below it) to choose the correct grammar.
62. F. If you look at the underlined portion by itself, it looks bizarre because it has two
commas, before and after “that.” However, the purpose of a comma is to express a
pause or hesitation. Read this aloud, and you will see that the commas are correctly
placed. Choices G and H have an -ing word, “reaching.” Double-check all -ing words
because they often introduce errors or unnecessarily clumsy sentences. Choice J has
the wrong tense.
63. A. If you got this question correct, kudos to you! Normally, the word “however” is part
of the construction that separates independent sentences. For example, “I was careful;
however, I still missed the question.” In this case, however, the commas do not sepa-
rate independent sentences (if they did, they would be wrong), but simply pause, or
make a parenthetical aside. Choice D changes the meaning of the sentence. Choice C 
is tempting, but it would turn the second sentence into a fragment: “And however for
nearly two centuries contending families in the north and south struggled to control
the powerless kings of the Le Dynasty.” You may remember, from junior-high grammar,
that you should not begin a sentence with the conjunction “and.” Although that is a
good idea in general, it is not a hard-and-fast rule. There may be a few times in which
and can correctly begin a sentence. (“You told me you loved me!” she sobbed. “And I
meant it when I said it!” he assured her.)
64. H. Affect with an a means touch or concern. “How does having your boyfriend flirt with
another girl affect your relationship?” The idiomatic expression in effect means prima-
rily or generally. The effect is the result of something. In effect means a situation, basi-
cally, has that result. “When I saw him flirting with his former girlfriend, I gave Leon his
ring back, in effect ending our relationship.” Choice J changes the meaning of the entire
sentence. Ineffective means not skillful, not efficient. “Leon’s efforts to win his girlfriend
back were ineffective, even pathetic.”
65. B. The original has a fragment, “Just a few kilometers above the demarcation line
established at the 1954 Geneva Conference.” This clause cannot stand on its own.
Change the second “sentence” into a subordinate clause, tagging on the end of the pre-
vious sentence.
Choice D may have trapped you. A semicolon functions the same way that a period
functions (by connecting two independent sentences). Choice C turns the sentence
into a run-on — two sentences incorrectly joined.
66. H. If the word “but” weren’t there, the original form would work: “Vietnam, having been
reunited, soon fell prey. . . .” However, the word “but” (which is not underlined and
therefore cannot be changed) requires the simple past tense, “was.”
If you missed this question, you probably fell for the common trap of reading only 
the underlined portion and a small portion around it. Reading the entire sentence is
critical.

67. D. The word “while” turns the entire sentence into a subordinate clause, an incomplete
sentence, a fragment. Eliminating “while” allows the sentence to stand alone. While is a
good word to double-check each time that you encounter it. Subordinate terms such as
“while,” “although,” and “despite” often (on this exam) begin sentence fragments.
68. G. Notice that this is an exception to the tip that -ing words are usually wrong. The
original sounds as if France’s purpose in imposing control gradually was in order to
meet heavy resistance. The sense of the sentence indicates something entirely differ-
ent. Choice H has an unnecessary “and.” (I live by the motto, “When in doubt, leave it
out.” It’s a good thing I’m a grammar teacher, not a surgeon!) Choice J has the wrong
verb tense.
69. A. This question tests its (possessive) versus it’s (it is). Here, “its” refers to the upris-
ing, making the possessive correct. That narrows the answers down to A and D. “So”
indicates a corresponding thought; “but” correctly indicates here a contrary thought.
70. G. Adept means skillful and is usually followed by at. (You’re skillful or adept at taking
the ACT.) Adopt means to take as one’s own; adopted from means taken from. Adapt
means to fit or adjust. You have to adapt to a new schedule in order to find time to
study for the ACT.
71. B. Led is the past tense of lead. I led you right into a trap. The required word here 
is the noun, lead, meaning the front position. (Rudolph takes the lead when pulling
Santa’s sleigh.) Choice D has the wrong verb tense, turning the sentence into a 
fragment.
72. J. The original is a run-on. A mere comma is not strong enough to join independent
clauses.
If you chose G, you fell for the trap. A semicolon does join independent clauses, but
“then went to China” (note that “he” is missing) is not an independent clause. Choice H
is awkward (a common failing of -ing words) and isn’t parallel. Choice J, by eliminating
the “he,” makes the second clause subordinate, correcting the run-on.
73. A. Choice B has the singular verb “was” with the plural subject “dissidents.” Choice C
sounds as if the dissidents were doing the imprisoning, rather than being imprisoned.
Choice D turns the sentence into a fragment.
74. G. ACT passages are rarely negative; they don’t ridicule or criticize. Eliminate choices F
and H. Choice J is too specific. Ho Chi Minh was mentioned only in the last paragraph.
The purpose of a passage is usually very broad and general: to introduce a topic, to
give an overview, or to discuss or explain an idea. When in doubt (remember that the
ACT has no penalty for guessing), choose the most generic answer.
75. A. The passage is about the various governments that Vietnam has had and the wars
that put those governments in power. The next paragraph would continue the thought
of the last paragraph, the paragraph that discussed the burgeoning anticolonial 
movement.
Nothing in the passage even hints at nuclear weapons (choice B) or human rights
(choice D). And even if Vietnam were industrialized (it’s still primarily agrarian, although
you don’t have to know that to get this question correct), the passage does not discuss
that topic.
Mathematics Test
1. B. Multiply 87 by .12 (which is the same as 12%) to get $10.44. Add that to the original
87, for a total of 97.44.
There’s a small shortcut you can take. Multiply 87 by 1.12, because that’s the same as
112%, to get 97.44 immediately. You cut out one additional step.
235
Chapter 20: Practice Exam 1: Answers and Explanations

2. J. This problem requires just simple subtraction and knowing that there are 3 feet in 
a yard. That means that 11⁄2 yards is 3 feet + 1 foot or 4 feet, for a total of 48 inches.
Subtract: 48 – 25 = 23; 23 – 10 = 13.
You could have eliminated choices H and K immediately. You are cutting off whole
inches, not fractions. If you chose either H or K, you got confused on 1⁄3 of a yard (which
is a foot) versus 1⁄3 of an inch.
3. C. The three friends averaged $50,000 each. That means their total was $150,000 
(3 × 50,000 = 150,000). Make the equation: 150,000 = 40% Total, or 150,000 = .4T. Divide
both sides through by what’s next to the variable. 150,000/.4 = T. T = 375,000.
Were you looking for an answer like, “It cannot be determined” among the choices? 
If so, you were probably confused because you don’t know exactly how much money
each individual made. Maybe Debi made $100,000 and both Mike and Ken together
made $50,000. It’s irrelevant. The only important point is that three people together
made $150,000.
4. H. One of the two parenthetical expressions must equal zero, because the product of
zero and anything else is zero. That means that either a = 5 (because –5 + 5 = 0) or a = 6
(because 6 – 6 = 0).
Although this is an easy problem, it’s also an easy problem to miss with a careless mis-
take. As soon as you see that the answer choices are “variations on a theme,” with the
positive and negative signs making all the difference, go back and double check that
you didn’t make a silly mistake.
5. D. If the office wants 100 calls a day for 12 days, it wants 1,200 calls (100 × 12 = 1,200). It
has 480 calls (80 × 6 = 480). Subtract: 1,200 – 480 = 720.
If you chose E, you fell for the trap! The question does not ask how many calls per day
the office receives, but how many calls altogether. Sure, if the office needs to have 720
calls in 6 days, that’s 120 calls per day (720/6 = 120), but that’s not what the question
wants to know. Remember: The mere fact that the answer you got is staring you in the
face does not mean that’s the correct answer to the problem.
6. J. The key here is knowing that an integer is a whole number (for example, 1.5 is not 
an integer). If number sets are fuzzy in your memory, go back to the thrilling pages of
Chapter 12. For F to be true, x would have to be 12, which is too large. For G to be true,
x would have to be 4, which is too small. For H to be true, x would have to be 7.25,
which is not an integer. For K to be true, x would have to be 4.5, which is both too
small and not an integer. Only choice J works, because if 3x = 24, x = 8.
7. D. The key here is math vocabulary (which is covered in Chapter 10). An obtuse angle 
is more than 90 degrees. (I always think of obtuse angles as obese angles, “fatter” than
a 90-degree angle.) The interior angles of a triangle total 180 degrees. If one angle is
greater than 90 degrees, the sum of the other two angles must be less than 90 degrees.
An acute angle is greater than 0, but less than 90 degrees (think of it as “a cute” little
angle). Each of the remaining two angles, therefore, must be acute.
8. H. An easy way to deal with percentages is to use the number 100. In this case, say that
(a + b) = 100. Then 5% of 100 = 5. That means that 10% of b = 5. Solve for b: .10b = 5.
Divide both sides through by what’s next to the variable: b = 5/.10 = 50. If a + b = 100,
then a = 50 and a = b.
Are you saying, “Yeah, but what if I plug in something besides 100? How do I know it
works with other numbers? Okay, we’ll prove it to you. Try plugging in another number.
(If you want to make life harder, go ahead!) Choose something truly bizarre, like –37.
Let (a + b) = –37. Then 5% of –37 = –1.85. If –1.85 = 10% of b, solve for b. –1.85 = .1b.
Divide both sides through by what’s next to the variable: –1.85/.1 = –18.5. b = –18.5. If 
(a + b) = –37, and b = –18.5, then a = –18.5 as well. Son of a gun, it works! (But the moral
of the story is: Plug in 100 when dealing with percentages. Life is so much easier.)
9. B. The area of a square is side squared. In this case, that’s 82, or 64. That means the
area of the triangle is also 64. The area of a triangle is 1⁄2 base times height. In this case,
that’s 1⁄2x times x, or 1⁄2x2. Make the equation: 1⁄2x2 = 64. Multiply through by 2 to get rid of 
236
Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: Full-Length Practice ACTs 

the fraction: x2 = 128. Take the square root by simplifying: 128 = 64 ×
2. The square 
root of 64 = 8, giving you a final answer of 8 2.
10. K. This problem can be solved very quickly if you recognize that 6, 8, and 10 is double
the ratio of 3:4:5. A 3:4:5 ratio (a very common ratio), is for the sides of a 30:60:90 trian-
gle. (This ratio is covered in Chapter 7.)
Note that 30, 60, and 90 are all answer choices. If you chose G, you fell for the trap,
thinking that the angle between the two shortest sides must be the smallest angle.
Wrong. Draw a 30:60:90 triangle. The 3 (or in this case, the 6) side is opposite the 30-
degree angle, but next to the 90. The 4 (or in this case, the 8) is opposite the 60 degree
angle, but next to the 90. That means that the angle between the two smaller sides is 90
degrees.
11. D. If you chose answer A or answer E, you fell for a trap. Answer A caught careless stu-
dents who thought, “The price rises 25% then falls 1⁄4, or 25%, for a 0% change.” Wrong.
An easy way to solve a problem like this is to plug in 100 for the original price of the
book. In 1998, the book cost $100. If the price rose by 25%, it went up $25 to a total of
$125. In 2000, the price was 1⁄4, or 25%, below its 1998 cost. That means that it was $25
below the original $100, or $75.
Here’s where the trap comes in. Reading the question carefully tells you that you want
to know the percent decrease from 1999 to 2000, which here is from 125 to 75. The for-
mula (given in the math review) for percent increase or decrease is:
Number increase or decrease ÷ starting (original) number.
In other words, the denominator is the number you begin with, which in this case is
125 (because the question asks for the change from 1999, not from 1998). The number
decrease is 50 (125 – 75 = 50). Finally, 50⁄125 = 4⁄10 = 40%.
Choice E traps readers who forget that you are trying to find a percentage decrease
and find just the year 2000 price.
12. J. The easiest way to do this problem is to look at the last term in the expression, the
15. What two numbers multiply to 15? You could choose 3 and 5, or –3 and –5. If you
chose 3 and 5, you’d have (a + 3) (a + 5), giving you a squared +8a + 15. You need 
(a – 3) (a – 5) which multiplies (using the FOIL: First, Outer, Inner, Last method
described in Chapter 8) to a2 – 8a + 15.
13. A. A simple way to do this problem is to plug in numbers. Say that Jim is 20 years old
now. Let m = 5. That means that 5 years ago, he was 15, such that y = 15. In 12 years, he
will be 20 (his current age) + 12 = 32. Look for an answer that works out to 32. Choice A:
y(15) + m(5) + 12 = 32.
14. F. First, square or cube each expression: (5x2y5) (5x2y5) = 25x4y10 Then (3x3y4) (3x3y4)
(3x3y4) = 27x9y12. Next, multiply the products.
Before you go through all the pencil-pushing to find 25 × 27, look at the exponents: 
x4 ⋅x9 = x4 + 9 = x13. You’ve immediately narrowed the answers down to F and J. Because
25 × 27 > 15, eliminate J. What looked like a “pain in the posterior” problem is over with
in a flash.
This question is relatively easy if you remember how to work with bases and exponents.
To multiple like bases, add the exponents. To work with a “power to a power,” that is,
with one exponent inside a parenthesis and one outside, multiply the exponents. (If I’ve
totally left you in the dust, go to Chapter 8. This jazz is easier than it looks.)
15. C. The area of a circle is π times radius squared, or 16π for the first circle. Because 
16π is 1⁄4 of 64π, you want a circle with an area of 64π, which means its radius must be
8:82 × π = 64π.
If you chose A, you went backward and didn’t think the problem through. If the second
circle has a bigger area, it must have a bigger — not smaller — radius. The fact that 
1 is 1⁄4 of 4 is irrelevant. If you chose D, you simply took 4 times the first circle’s radius.
Remember that you get the ratio of the areas of similar figures by squaring the ratio of
237
Chapter 20: Practice Exam 1: Answers and Explanations

their sides (or radii). In other words, if the radii are in a ratio of 1:2, their areas are in a
ratio of 1:4.
16. J. The formula for rate, time, and distance is RT = D: rate × time = distance. Plug what
you know into the formula: rate × 2 hours 20 minutes = 7 miles. Then convert 2 hours
20 minutes to 7⁄3 hours (because an hour has 60 minutes, 20 minutes is 1⁄3 hour). Change
the 7 miles (distance) to thirds as well: 21⁄3. Now, you have R × 7⁄3 = 21⁄3 and R = 3.
17. C. Find the ratio of the sides, noting that the dollhouse is in inches while the regular
house is in feet. 18 inches = 1.5 feet and 1.5 to 12 = 15⁄120 or 1⁄8. That means the width must
be in a 1⁄8 or 1:8 ratio as well. First, 24 inches = 2 feet. Then 2⁄16 = 1⁄8.
Did you notice that you can eliminate answers A, D, and E by using common sense?
You can eliminate A because the length of the real bedroom is not 18 feet, and the doll-
house is built to scale; the width cannot be 24 feet. Because the floor is wider than it is
long (24 inches to 18 inches in the dollhouse), the answer must be more than 12 feet.
18. J. Two figures are similar if their sides (and angles) are in proportion. (See Chapter 7 
for a quick refresher on similar figures.) In this case, if the triangles are similar, then
the angles of triangle II are also in the ratio 1:2:3, which just happens to be a 30:60:90
triangle. (See Chapter 7 for a refresher on the interior angles of a triangle and on prop-
erties of special triangles, like the 30:60:90 triangle.)
The ratio of sides in a 30:60:90 triangle is 2:3. This means that the “side 3” side of 
triangle I is the 5 3 side. Therefore, the “side” is 5, and the “2side” is 10. (Check by 
adding these once more: 5 + 5 3 + 10 = 15 + 5 3.) If the shortest side of triangle I is 5
and the shortest side of triangle II is 15, the triangles are in a 1:3 ratio. That means that
every side of triangle II is three times as long as every side of triangle I. The sides of tri-
angle II, therefore, are 15, 15 3, 30. Add these together to get the perimeter 45 + 15 3.
19. E. On this type of problem, be sure that you note what the question is asking for. It
doesn’t want the solution to the equation, but rather the equation itself. Often, you will
find going backward easier. “Forty percent of everything” means .40 times everything
else, eliminating choices A and D. The square of 5 is simply 52, but be careful not to
take the square root of that answer (eliminating choice B). Because you add 625 and
52, eliminate choice C. Only E is left.
Read every choice. If you’re rushed (and who isn’t?), you may do too much work by
anticipating what the question is asking for and actually solving out the question. No
one here really wants to know Lael’s age, just the equation for finding it.
20. H. Add together the number of redheaded children (1⁄6) and brown-haired children (1⁄3,
which can be written as 2⁄6) to get 3⁄6 or 1⁄2. If half the children don’t have blond hair, the
other half of the children do have blond hair. That means that the blondes, 30, are half
of the number of children, making the total 60.
21. A. Set up the equations: a – b = 6 (because a is six greater than b, the difference
between them is 6) and a + b = –18. Line them up vertically, and add:
a – b = 6
a + b = –18
2a = –12
a = –6
–6 + b = –18
6= –12
(–12)2 = 144
The key to this problem is lining up the equations vertically, then adding them so that
one variable (in this case, the b) drops out. Solve for the other variable, then substitute
that back into one of the equations.
238

22. H. The interior angles of any polygon are found by using this formula, discussed in
detail in Chapter 10: (n – 2) × 180°, where n stands for the number of sides. Here n = 5
and (5 – 2)180 = 3(180) = 540.
Notice that it makes no difference whether the figure is regular (all sides and angles are
the same) or irregular. The exam may give you some truly bizarre-looking figures; don’t
let them intimidate you. The interior angle formula is the same no matter how grotesque
the figure is.
23. C. The total number of tourists is the sum of 200 + 320 + 140 + 180 + 240 = 1,080. The
French are 180⁄1080 or 1⁄6 of the total.
If you chose E, you fell for the trap and didn’t finish working the problem out to answer
what the question was asking. A circle has 360°, and 1⁄6 of 360 is 60°.
24. H. This problem was easier than it looked. If the rings cost $864 for 12, divide 864 by 12
to get 72. The price per ring drops from 85 to 72, a difference of 13.
25. C. Remove the parentheses: 3x2y + xy2 – 2x2y + 2xy2.
The last item is added because of the negative sign in front of the second set of paren-
theses: –1(–2xy2) = 2xy2. Confusing signs is one of the most common careless errors in
algebra problems.
Combine like terms: 3x2y – 2x2y + xy2 + 2xy2 = x2y + 3xy2.
26. H. Line segment XY must be a horizontal line parallel to the x-axis, because the y coor-
dinate does not change. If the line segment goes from –2 to +4, it is 6 units long. The
midway point would be 3 units along. Start at –2 and count: From –2 to –1 is one unit.
From –1 to 0 is two units. From 0 to 1 is 3 units.
If you said K, you fell for the trap. Yes, you’re moving three units to the right, but you’re
moving from –2. You go only from –2 to 1, not to 3.
27. B. Add the numbers in the ratio: 3 + 5 = 8. The total must be a multiple of 8, eliminating
answers A and D. Try each of the remaining answers. If the total is 72, there are 9 groups
(because 8 into 72 is 9). Multiply: 9 × 3 = 27 and 9 × 5 = 45. Subtract: 45 – 27 = 18. (Bonus
trivia: Did you know that olive trees can live to be more than 2,000 years old? Just
think, this question may be plaguing students two millennia from now!)
28. H. There are two ways to do this problem: The official, gives-you-brain-cramp way, and
the easy, Dummies way. Which do you prefer? Us, too. Here’s the easy way: Plug in the
answer choices. We suggest you start with the middle term. That way, you can see
whether the answer is too high or low, and choose your next plug-in accordingly.
If x is 10, then 10 + 2⁄3(10) = 10 + 6.66 = about 17, certainly more than 15. The first equa-
tion is valid. Try the second. Is 10 + 4 < 15? Yes. The answer is C.
Just to prove to those Doubting Thomases in the crowd, try another answer. Choose G:
9 + 2⁄3(9) = 9 + 6 = 15. The first equation doesn’t work; don’t even bother with the second.
If you take the time to check, you’ll see that none of the other answers work.

When you make up your own numbers to plug in, you have to check every single
answer, in case more than one can work (if more than one works, plug in something
else and try again). But when you plug in the answer choices, you can stop as soon as
one works. On the ACT, only one answer can be correct.
29. D. This question tests your ability to convert from English to algebra. Talk it through in
your mind: Three less than 2x means 2x – 3. The product of 6 and 4 means 6 × 4. A third
of it is 1⁄3 (24) or 8. Combine 8 = 2x – 3. Finally, 11 = 2x and x = 11⁄2.
Did you choose E? Tsk, tsk. You forgot to change your sign and got 8 – 3 = 5 rather than
8 + 3 = 11.
30. K. The only way to roll a 12 is to roll double sixes. The probability of rolling any number
on a fair six-sided die (one of a pair of dice) is 1 out of 6, or 1⁄6. (Fair dice are not loaded.
The ACT would never corrupt the youth of America by even thinking about cheating!)
Multiply consecutive probabilities:
1⁄6 (for the first die) × 1⁄6 (for the second die) =1⁄36.
Probability is discussed in detail in Chapter 11. ACT-type problems have basically only
two probability rules, both easy. I suggest that you learn them and get yourself some
quick points. (The probability of your getting a probability question on the ACT is
probably 100 percent.)
31. E. The area of a triangle is 1⁄2 base times height. The sides of an isosceles right triangle 
are in the ratio: side:side:side 2 (this ratio is discussed in Chapter 10). Therefore, 25 + 
5 2 = 20 + 10 2. Solve for s = 10. The sides of an isosceles right triangle are the base
and height, such that 1⁄2 (10) (10) = 50.
32. F. The formula for the volume of a rectangular solid (like a box or a fish tank, for
instance) is length × width × height (l × w × h). The volume of the first tank is 6 × 4 × 10 =
240. The sides of the base of the second tank are half again as long as those of the first
tank: If one side of the first tank is 6, the second tank has a side of 6 + 1⁄2(6), or 6 + 3 = 9.
If the other side of the first tank is 4, the second tank has a side of length 4 + 1⁄2(4), or 
4 + 2 = 6. Multiply these: 9 × 6 = 54. Because the volumes are to be the same, 54 × h = 240.
Divide by 54 to get .4 44 or approximately 4.4.
33. A. The area of a triangle is 1⁄2 base × height, written as 1⁄2bh. If Area = 32, then 1⁄2bh = 32,
and bh = 64.
Be very careful not to go the opposite way, and say that bh = 16. The base is 8, so 
8h = 64, making h = 8. Therefore, the figure is an isosceles right triangle. Because simi-
lar figures have sides in proportion, DEF is also an isosceles right triangle, making its
base 28.
You could use the Pythagorean theorem to say that a2 + b2 = c2, or you could remember
from Chapter 7 that isosceles right triangles have their sides in the ratio of side: side: 
side 2. (This theorem is one of the PTs, or Pythagorean triples, that are so useful 
on this test. They’re definitely worth memorizing; see Chapter 10.) That means the 
hypotenuse DE is 28 2. To find the perimeter, add all the sides: 28 + 28 +28 2 = 
56 + 28 2.
If you chose B, you just added all the numbers and said to heck with that pesky square
root sign. No can do. You cannot add roots and nonroots. If you chose C, you kept the
square root sign but added everything together anyway. If adding roots and nonroots
confuses you, go to Chapter 11 for a quick refresher.
34. F. The straight lines indicate absolute value, which is always positive. Therefore, 
3 – 3a must equal 12 or –12. If 3 – 3a = 12,

Why not take a simple shortcut? Plug in the answer choices. The ACT is nice enough to
give you the answer; all you have to do is plug and chug through the answer choices
until you find it. Here, only choice F works.
Note how carefully the question asks which could be true. The answer choices never
try to trap you by putting in two correct answers. If more than one value works in a
problem, the ACT will offer only one as an answer choice.
If you chose H, you forgot to change the sign when you moved the 3 to the other side of
the equal sign.
35. D. This problem is much easier than it looks. The sum of the interior angles of any tri-
angle is 180 — whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or scalene (no sides are
equal), no matter what the size of the triangle is. The interior angles of a triangle always
total 180°, so 180:180 = 1:1.
If you chose A, C, or E, you let yourself be tricked by the areas of the triangle.
36. H. The easy way to do this problem is to plug in numbers. Say the items cost 1 cent
each for a total cost of 8 cents. Marcy forked over 2 dimes, for a total of 20 cents. Her
change is the difference: 20 – 8 = 12. Go through each answer choice, plugging in 1 for 
x and 2 for y. Whichever answer comes out to be 12 is the winner. Choice F becomes 
2 – 8 = –6. Nope. Choice H is 20 – 8 = 12. That’s it.
When you plug in numbers that you choose randomly, you must, absolutely must, go
through all the answer choices. Once in a while, more than one answer choice is cor-
rect, based on the numbers you’ve chosen. What do you do then? You choose different
numbers and do the problem again with the answer choices that have yet to be elimi-
nated. The chance of the same thing occurring (that is, of having two answers fit with
those given numbers) is astronomical.
37. D. Because a circle has 360°, arc AB is 10⁄360, or 1⁄36, of the circumference. Make the equa-
tion: 3 = 1⁄36 C. Cross-multiply (multiply each side by 36): 36 × 3 = C. Finally, C = 108.
Did you fall for the trap answer E? Yes, the circumference of a circle is 2πr or πd, but 
in this case, the π is already built into the length of the arc. Don’t feel too bad if you
missed this question. Most of the time, a circumference (or an area, for that matter)
does have a π in it. This was just the exception I put in to drive you nuts.
38. J. If you chose F, I gotcha! Did you think that this was a 5:12:13 triangle, one of the
famous PT (Pythagorean theorem) triples? Sorry, not this time (but I like the fact that
you thought of the triples, which do show up often on this test). Draw the figure like
this:
Notice that the 120 is the hypotenuse, which in a 5:12:13 triangle is 13, not 12. No short-
cuts here: Do the calculations: a2 + b2 = c2. Then 502 + b2 = 1202. Then 2,500 + b2 = 14,400.
Finally, b2 = 14,400 – 2,500 = 11,900.
If you chose G, you avoided one trap but fell for a second. The 11,900 represents a side
squared. To find the side, take the square root of 11,900.
39. D. Plug 3 in for x in the equation: y = 5 when x = 3. The coordinates are (3, 5).

40. G. An altitude divides the triangle into two 30:60:90 triangles, as shown.
You know this because an altitude is always perpendicular (90 degrees) to the base. An
equilateral triangle has three 60-degree angles. That means the angle at the left bottom
is 60, the angle in the middle is 90, and the angle at the top has been split into two,
making it 30 degrees, as shown in the figure.
The ratio of the sides of a 30:60:90 triangle is side: side: side 3:2side. (This concept is 
discussed in greater depth in Chapter 10.) The side opposite the 60 is the “side 3” side, 
or the 10 3. That means “side” is 10 — but if you chose C, you fell for the trap. Half of
the bottom is the side of the small triangle, meaning the full bottom of the overall trian-
gle is 20. Three equal sides sum up to 60.
Like many people, you may be taking both the ACT and the SAT. Although the SAT gives 
you some formulas in the directions (including “side: side 3:2side”), the ACT does not.
You have to memorize more math formulas and rules for the ACT than for the SAT. It’s
back to Chapter 10 once again!
41. D. The easy way to do this problem is to take it one step at a time. After one hour, the
pool is at 1⁄2 empty. Then after the next hour, it is at 1⁄4 (because 1⁄2 of 1⁄2 = 1⁄4) empty. Keep a
little chart, as follows:
Hour

Scan the answer choices before you begin solving the problem. Doing so tells you how
precise you need to be. Because three of the answers are so close (C, D, E), you had to
solve the problem exactly. Had the answers been far apart, like 12, 6, 0, you could have
estimated.
42. K. The easy way to do this problem is to plug in numbers. Let m = 5 and n = 10. If five
pencils cost ten cents, each pencil costs 10⁄5 or two cents. So you know the cost of one
pencil is n⁄m. Because m is in the denominator, your answers are already narrowed down
to H and K. Multiply the cost per pencil (n/m) by the number of pencils (p) to get 
n/m × p = np/m.
43. A. First, find out how many 45-minute increments are in 41⁄2 hours, or 270 minutes: 270⁄45 = 6.
Faye, therefore, assembles 6 batches of 200 widgets, or 1,200 widgets. Hal assembles
600 in 21⁄2 hours, or 1,200 in 5 hours.
Don’t bother figuring out how many Hal does in 1 minute, or in 45 minutes, or in any
other increment. You’re doing too much work. Because 1,200 is 2 × 600, he works twice
21⁄2 hours, or 5 hours. You can talk the problem through instead of heading for Power
Math.

44. J. Say that the suit was originally $100. A 50 percent increase raises the price to $150. 
A 20 percent, or 1⁄5 drop in the price, puts the cost at $120. First, 1⁄5 × 150 = 30. Then 
150 – 30 = 120. A 30 percent decrease from 120 is 84. First, .3 × 120 = 36. Then 120 – 36 =
84. Now you can easily see what percent of the original (100) the new price (84) is.
That’s the beauty of starting with 100. Yes, the answer is true no matter what number
you choose, but why make life any harder than it already is?
Choice G is the trap answer. Did you simply write down +50 – 20 – 30 = 0, meaning there
was no change? If so, the new cost would be 100 percent of the old cost, but, as explained
above, the decreases are not all percentages of the same number.
45. E. A revolution of a wheel is the same as the circumference of a wheel. If the wheel
goes 15 revolutions and 300π meters, you divide 300 by 15, and each revolution is 20π.
Remember that Circumference = π × diameter. First, d = 20. Then d = 2r. Finally, r = 10.
46. G. A little vocabulary lesson here: Prime numbers are numbers that have no positive
integer factors other than 1 and themselves. Examples are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Composite num-
bers do have positive integer factors other than 1 and themselves. Examples are 4, 6,
and 9. Because a composite number already has more factors than just 1 and itself,
multiplying it by yet another number keeps it composite.
To do a problem of this sort, plug in numbers. Try to plug in numbers that eliminate
answer choices, as in this example: 3 (prime) × 9 (composite) = 27. The answer is not a
prime number, nor zero, nor a fraction, nor even, so eliminate answers F, H, J, and K.
47. C. An inscribed angle (one that has a vertex on the circle) has half the measure of its
central angle so that AOC = 12°. (If you forgot this, go back to the circles portion in
Chapter 10.) Because a circle has 360°, AOC is 12⁄360 or 1⁄30 of the circle. Follow these steps:
120π = 1⁄30 area and 120π × 30 = area and 3,600π = area.
The area of a circle is πr2. Here, πr2 = 3,600π. (When you see a perfect square such as
3,600, you know that you’re on the right track.) First, 602 = 3,600 and r = 60 (not 6 or 600,
both easy, careless mistakes to make). Finally, the circumference of a circle is 2πr, or 120π.
Did I getcha? Did you immediately eliminate choice C because it’s the same as the area
of the sector? When it comes to the ACT, expect the unexpected. Bizarre is the norm.
48. H. Don’t be intimidated if you don’t remember anything about circles or their equa-
tions. Simply plug the –3 into the equation, and solve for y. First, –32 + y2 = 25. Then 
9 + y2 = 25 and y2 = 16. Then y = –4, 4. Either –4 or +4 works.
Now, if you insist on getting excessively paranoid, don’t freak out and think that two
answer choices would be –44 and +4. You’ll get one or the other, not both. The question
very carefully asks you which could be y, not which must be y.

Chapter 20: Practice Exam 1: Answers and Explanations
Just as a quick review, the equation of a circle is (x – h)2 + (y + k)2 = r where the center
is at (h, k) and r is the radius. In this problem, x2 + y2 = 25 could be written as (x – 0)2 +
(y – 0)2 = 52. Therefore, the center is at (0, 0), and the radius is 5. This could be drawn
as shown:

Did you at least eliminate choices C and D? You know that a2 + a2 = 2a2. Don’t forget to
narrow down the answers as you go, to avoid making a careless mistake.
A look at the graph shows that when x = –3, y = 4 or –4.
To check this, you can show that the distance from (0, 0) to (–3, 4) is equal to 5, the
length of the radius. You can make a 3:4:5 triangle,

49. A. You can, of course, FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last, as discussed in Chapter 11). Multiply
each expression out, and then add the products. Personally, I refuse to do this much
work. If you’ve been clever enough to pay attention to my suggestions about memoriza-
tion, you know that (a + 3)2 would follow the same rule as (a + b)2, and automatically
know that it is (a2 + 2ab + b2), substituting a 3 for the b. That gives you a2 + 6a + 9. 
Next, (a – 4) is the same as (a – b), which you have (of course) memorized as (a – b) =
a2 – 2ab + b2. Substitute the 4 for the b to get a2 – 8a + 16. Now add vertically:

50. K. If there are going to be two colors of marbles, red marbles must be 2⁄3 of the total and
blue marbles must be 1⁄3. That way, the probability of drawing a red marble is twice as
great as the probability of drawing a blue marble. Multiply: 2⁄3 × 36 = 24 and 1⁄3 × 36 = 12.
The difference between 24 and 12 is 12.
51. B. Do you remember that great saying you learned in trig: SOH CAH TOA (“soak a toe,
uh”)? It means:
Sine = Opposite/Hypotenuse (SOH)
Cosine = Adjacent/Hypotenuse (CAH)
Tangent = Opposite/Adjacent (TOA)
Here is an illustration:
To find tan Z in this problem, identify the side opposite angle Z and the side adjacent to
angle Z.
tan Z = Opposite/Adjacent = 7⁄24
52. J. The unshaded circle means that point is not included on the graph. Therefore, 
the –4 is not part of the graph. Eliminate choice C. The shaded circle means that point
is included on the graph. Look for an answer that says the graph can be equal to 0.
Choice D works well.
Choice A is far too broad. Numbers greater than –4 are infinite! Choice B is also too
broad, for the same reason: Numbers less than –4 are infinite. Choice E is the trap
answer. The graph does not go all the way to –5 or all the way to –1. A careless test-
taker who didn’t take the time to examine this graph closely deserves to miss this
question.

55. E. To find the angle of depression, first draw a horizontal line from the lookout point.
The 14° angle is formed with this line. The horizontal line is parallel to the water’s 
surface. When parallel lines are cut by a transversal, the alternate interior angles are
congruent (the same):
This means that you can draw a right triangle with a 14° angle:
You know the side adjacent to (next to) the 14° angle. You are trying to find the oppo-
site side. The trigonometric function needed is the tangent adjacent
opposite
e
o so tan 14° = x⁄2. 
Solve for x by multiplying both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 2 tan 14° = x.
56. G. Stop, stop — you don’t need to drag out your graphing calculator. This problem
requires more common sense than anything else. First, look for a graph showing that
nothing was printed for two hours. This narrows the field quickly to choices G and H
because the horizontal portion shows that the number of pages (p) remained steady.
Choice G is better than choice H because the horizontal portion is longer (representing
a longer time) than either of the increasing portions. The computer was broken for two
hours, but each printing segment lasted only one hour. Choice G also makes sense in
that the second printing phase is steeper than the first. With two computers during the
second phase, the segment should have twice the slope of the first.
57. A. The key to answering the question is to remember the equation cos2Θ + sin2Θ = 1. If
you have trouble remembering this, think of a right triangle with a hypotenuse of 1, as in
x2 + y2 = 1 (remember the Pythagorean theorem?).

If this problem is really, really tough for you, you’re not alone. Many students find this
jazz difficult. Keep in mind as you’re going through these questions that you don’t have
to get all the problems right to get a very good score; you can afford to miss several 
of them.
58. J. This problem is one of the oldest in the books and is included to try to get students
to waste time doing a lot of Power Math, setting up algebraic equations full of p’s and
c’s. Forget it. Talk this problem through.
The first thing you want to do is realize that you can’t have a cow and a half, so double
that to get three cows. Twice as many cows (three instead of 11⁄2) can give twice as
much milk (three pints instead of 11⁄2) in the same number of hours.
Be very careful not to double all the variables, including the 36 hours, at once. Double
two variables at a time.
You now have the right number of cows. You want to double the number of hours 
(36 × 2 = 72). The same number of cows in double the time can give double the milk: 
3 × 2 = 6 pints. This problem is much easier than it looks . . . unless you made it hard.
59. E. The unknown height is opposite the 21° angle. Because 1,500m is the side adjacent
to 21°, you can use the tangent=opposite/adjacent. First, tan 21° = x⁄1,500. Solve for x: 1,500
tan 21° = x.
60. J. If, like most people, you don’t remember anything about the unit circle, draw a right
triangle and remember this:
If one leg is 3 and the other is 4, use a2 + b2 = c2 to find the length of the hypotenuse: 
9 + 16 = 25 and 25 = 5.
If you’re really on the ball, you remembered the PT (Pythagorean theorem) triple 
(discussed in detail in Chapter 10) of 3:4:5 triangle to come up with a hypotenuse of 5,
without doing any of that busywork.
cos A = hypotenuse

Because tan A = adjacent A
opposite A , tan A = cos
sin

A in the unit circle.
Because tan A is positive, sin A and cos A must both be positive or both negative.
Between 0° and 90°, sin A and cos A are both positive. But between 90° and 180°, sin A
is positive and cos A is negative, ruling out any possibility that A is between 90° and
180° and that cos A is negative.
Depending on what math level you’re taking in school, you may not have even learned
this in class yet. Don’t worry; the ACT has only a few questions like this. And look on
the bright side: Quickly guessing on this question frees up more time for you to return
to the other questions you can get right — if only you had the time.
Reading Test
Passage 1
1. B. The first paragraph simply introduces blood clots, mentioning fixed and migratory
clots. Did you remember that describe is one of the Big Three? Three words are often
(not always, but frequently enough to merit your attention) the correct answers to a
“what is the purpose” question: discuss, describe, explain.
2. H. The first paragraph tells you that thrombosis is clotting; an embolism is simply a migra-
tory clot. The other answers may or may not be true. The passage doesn’t give you
that information.
3. A. Lines 32–36 state that, among pulmonary embolism patients, “the great majority
suffer no serious symptoms or complications, and the disorder clears up without sig-
nificant aftereffects.”
Dramatic words, such as “invariably,” are usually (not invariably) wrong. If you’re making
a guess (always worth doing, because the ACT has no penalty for wrong answers),
eliminate answers with strong, emphatic words (always, must) and look for wimpy
words (may, possibly).
As for choices C and D, the passage did not discuss either children or diet.
4. H. Lines 13–14 state that the site of a pulmonary embolism is often a deep vein of the
leg or pelvis.
A question that begins “According to the passage” is usually very straightforward. This
type of question is worth an investment of your time. Go back to the passage and find
the precise answer.
If you knew that “pulmonary” referred to the lungs, you may have looked for the
answer “lung” immediately. Fortunately, I didn’t put in that trap answer, but you can’t
count on the ACT to be as nice as I am. Take the time to find the exact answer in the
passage.

5. B. Although you may have been able to answer this based on common sense, the theme
of the first half of the passage is that thrombosis may turn into an embolism. Choice A
is outta left field — nothing was said about aiding others. Obviously, this was the cheap
trick answer, playing on the word “attendant.”
You have no information about the degree of risk (choice C), although the list of disor-
ders is pretty daunting. And although women are classified according to childbirth
status, the passage never contrasted women and men (choice D).
6. J. By citing a high percentage of patients who have venous thrombosis after recuperat-
ing from hip fractures, the passage implies that the risk of thrombosis is worsened.
In this example, the passage used “exacerbate” in its normal, everyday sense. (The
ACT exacerbates, or makes worse, your tension headache.) This will not always be so.
A word may have a dozen meanings. Don’t be surprised if the ACT uses the least
common of those meanings in a passage.
7. D. The clinical signs refer to the swollen extremity or inflammation mentioned in the
preceding sentence.
Every question in a section counts the same. A basic “definition question” like this one
is easy to answer quickly. If you’re short on time (and who isn’t on the reading pas-
sages?), this is a good type of question to focus on.
8. J. A “best title” is often the most broad and general statement that is offered. Choice G
is mentioned, but only in one brief part of the passage. Choices F and H were never 
discussed.
You can often predict the answer to a main-idea or best-title question. Pretend that
your buddy comes up behind you just as you finish reading the passage and asks you
what it was about. Your first reaction is the best title: “Oh, I just read this dull passage
about what blood clots are and how to recognize them.”
9. C. This question should have been very easy — if you remembered to “expand your
search.” Often, when a passage sends you to certain lines, the answer isn’t there. It’s a
little above or a little below those lines. Lines 67–68 at the end of the preceding para-
graph stated that “. . . other tests may be needed to confirm the diagnosis.” The next
few paragraphs describe such tests.
This is the third correct answer in this passage that uses the word “describe” (see
questions 1 and 8). Many ACT passages, especially science passages, describe a prob-
lem or situation. Don’t immediately choose describe every time you see it, but defi-
nitely give describe serious consideration. (I like to think of describe’s use as being
“guilty until proven innocent.” I assume that describe is correct unless I can find some-
thing clearly better.)
To lament (choice A) is to grieve over. Although you may lament having to take the ACT,
few ACT passages themselves lament anything. Choice B has the dramatic word prove.
Few things are definitively proven in ACT passages. Also, you can probably eliminate
choice B by common sense — can all of anything be diagnosed?
10. G. The second-to-last paragraph (the penultimate paragraph, if you like to use preten-
tious language) mentions that pulmonary embolisms are difficult to diagnose on the
basis of clinical symptoms alone.
You probably could have chosen G based on its wimpy language alone. Dramatic or
emphatic answers rarely are correct; hedging or wishy-washy answers are often cor-
rect. How can you go wrong saying something like, “should be done cautiously and in
conjunction with other tests?” Any physician makes a diagnosis cautiously and usually
uses more than one test.
Did you fall for the trap answer, choice J? Lines 94–98 mention a complex test that
cannot be done routinely on all patients — but these lines are talking about pulmonary
angiography, not clinical symptoms. If you simply skimmed until you found familiar
words, you were conned by this cheap trick. Remember: Just because the answer
249
Chapter 20: Practice Exam 1: Answers and Explanations

choice is mentioned in the passage does not mean that it is the correct answer to this
specific question.
Passage 2
11. B. The previous sentence tells you that the young lady made an inquiry. She raised her
veil while making this inquiry, or, in other words, asking the question. Choices A and C
are there to catch careless readers who use their common sense to answer the ques-
tion (“Well, obviously, to prefer is to like better, as in ‘I’d prefer to be hanging out with
my friends than studying for this test’”) rather than go back to see how the word is
used in context.
12. H. This question is slightly harder than number 11. In that question, you are simply
asked to define how the term is used. Here, you need to know why the author chose
that particular word. This question is more subjective, requiring you to understand the
author’s feelings about the person in question. Here, Dickens describes the young lady
as being slight and delicate and timid (lines 2–3) and neatly and quietly attired (line 13).
Therefore, he uses the word “glided” to indicate that quietness.
This type of question is especially difficult for someone whose first language is not
English. If you don’t understand the passage well enough to “get into the author’s
head” and know how the author is feeling, guess quickly and go on to the next ques-
tion. (Don’t forget to guess — the ACT has no penalty for wrong answers.)
13. D. The author struggles to say tactfully that, while on any other woman, the dress
would have looked like what it was (“poor and shabby”), this woman was so attractive
and genteel that on her, even low-quality clothing looked good. (Hmmm . . . I wonder
whether I can ever teach my boyfriend to be quite so tactful?)
14. F. If you chose G, you probably didn’t go back to see how the word was used in con-
text, but only used your knowledge that the word kin means a relative (your parents
and siblings are your kin, for example). Even though doing so chews up your time, go
back to the passage and read a little bit above and below the indicated portion. The
slovenly girl is the attendant of, or assistant to, the attractive young girl, and serves in
the same class as the assistant or “servant-of-all-work” on a farm.
15. C. First, recognize that sober in this sense has nothing to do with being drunk. Sober
can also mean serious, not frivolous (“consider soberly which college you want to
spend four years of your life attending”). Dump the cheap trick answer, choice A.
Dramatic answers, answers with strong, powerful, exclusive words (all, every, must) 
are often wrong. An answer like B, with obviously, is rarely right. An answer like D, with
completely, is almost never right. On the other hand, a wishy-washy answer, with a word
like some (choice C), is often correct.
In this instance, the author means that Nicholas would have followed the young
woman out (to the surprise of others who may have thought more seriously about
their conduct and may have acted less impetuously).
16. G. The girl was given a card to get a job, and left — yet Tom indicated that she would
be back the next day. From this, you may infer that Tom believes the girl will not take,
or will not stay long at, the position. The statement of the fat lady that “She’ll have a
nice life of it, if she goes there” may be construed as sarcasm, showing that the fat lady
agrees that the girl would not like the post.
Nothing in the passage indicates that the girl comes in daily (choice F). It’s clear that
the girl does not work for Tom and the fat lady, because she was asking about a post of
governess. Choice J is tempting (to Nicholas at least), but you get no indication that
the girl even noticed that Nicholas was present.
17. C. If you didn’t go back to the passage and read this portion in context, you may have
chosen A or B. Choice A is exactly wrong; the passage goes on to say that Nicholas was
disgusted by Tom’s conduct.
250
Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: Full-Length Practice ACTs 

Don’t choose an answer simply because it is a true statement. Be sure that it answers
the specific question asked. Choice B may be a true statement (Tom saw and agreed
with Nicholas’s admiration of the young woman), but that statement is not the reason
for the quote given here. Tom commented and winked at Nicholas in order to flatter
him by indicating that Nicholas’s skills would be valued by many employers.
18. F. The fat woman makes the comment that Mr. Gregsbury is a Member of Parliament
only after saying that she didn’t know what the terms of the position were. From this
you may infer that the purpose of the comment was to reassure Nicholas that the job
would be a good one.
Choice G may or may not be true; you have no way of knowing whether the fat lady’s
comment is true or false. Choice H seems logical, until you go back to the passage and
find that the fat lady (in this excerpt at least) did no boasting whatsoever of any of her
clientele. Choice J may have trapped you. True, there was only one listing, but that fact
didn’t seem to upset the fat lady any.
19. B. Given that the next paragraph discusses Nicholas’s going to the building and knock-
ing upon every door until he finds Mr. Gregsbury, you may infer that Nicholas is going
to visit the man.
If you chose C, you got careless. Any vocabulary word must be interpreted in context.
You have to go back to the passage and see how that word is used there. While “to wait
upon” could mean serve, as a waitress waits upon diners, it has no such connotation in
this passage.
20. H. If you chose F, you simply focused on the word “chivalrously” and ignored the
greater meaning of the sentence. The last paragraph lightly mocks the ideas of
chivalry, saying that a “knight” has a duty to knock about anyone who does not praise
his lady-love, even if he’s never met that lady-love. Therefore, Nicholas had a duty
(which he ignored) to defend the young woman’s honor.
Passage 3
21. D. A primary purpose is general and broad, not specific. Choice B gives information
that is stated in the passage, but only briefly, not as the purpose of writing the passage.
Choice C is not mentioned at all. Choice A is the trap answer. The passage does state
that bushmasters are poisonous, but not why.
22. J. If you are rushed for time, this is a good question to guess at quickly and come back
to later. (The ACT has no penalties for wrong answers, which means that you need
never leave an answer blank.) The best way to answer this question is by the process
of elimination: Find three questions that were answered, and whatever is left is the cor-
rect answer. Paragraph 2 states that the bushmaster’s coloring aids in its camouflage.
Paragraph 3 tells why the bushmaster has the pits in its head. Paragraph 3 also tells
what the bushmaster eats (rodents). Although the passage does talk about the mater-
nal instincts of the bushmaster, it does not discuss mating habits or attracting a mate.
23. C. Paragraph 2 states, “This maternal instinct is quite rare among reptiles.”
When a question begins with the words, “According to the passage,” it is usually a free-
bie for you, a complete gift. If you know that you are not going to be able to answer all
the questions in time, or if your brain is mush and you are losing focus (I speak from
experience!), look for an “According to the passage” question. This is one question that
you are almost guaranteed to get correct.
If you chose D, you fell for the trap. Yes, paragraph 1 states that unlike the rattlesnake,
the bushmaster has no rattles on its tail, but nothing is said about this lack of rattles
being rare among reptiles. The author is differentiating just two snakes, not making a
generalization.
24. F. The first paragraph states that the bushmaster is the largest venomous snake in the
New World. From this careful distinction (not “the largest snake in the world,” but the
largest snake “in the New World”), you can infer that larger snakes are found elsewhere
in the world.
251
Chapter 20: Practice Exam 1: Answers and Explanations

Choice H is tempting, but is a trap. The bushmaster perhaps attacks humans only when
threatened, but the passage implies that the bushmaster does attack its prey for food,
even though the prey (like rodents) cannot be considered threatening.
25. B. The third to last paragraph discusses how bushmasters hide from and then ambush
their prey.
You didn’t really fall for that piece of lame humor in choice A, did you? “Ambush” has
nothing to do with bushes in the Amazon!
26. H. Words have more than one meaning. Much of the ACT reading test asks you to inter-
pret how the author uses the words, not just their straightforward dictionary mean-
ings. To misplace does mean to lose, but that’s not how the author means the term in
this instance. He is saying that people have the wrong idea, that bushmasters are not
really fierce.
The key to answering this question is to continue reading. The real answer is in the rest
of the paragraph. Careless and lazy readers who go only where they are directed and
don’t continue will miss this type of question every time.
27. A. The paragraph discusses how the bushmasters’ numbers are declining, although the
bushmaster is not yet an endangered species. The author implies, without coming right
out and stating so, that the bushmaster may become endangered as more and more of
its habitat is removed. Choice H is far too dramatic. A common trap on the ACT is offer-
ing a very strongly worded answer that is rarely correct.
28. F. The last paragraph states that the hikers step on sleeping snakes, unable to see the
snakes because of their coloration or hear them because of the snake’s lack of rattles.
Choice J is the trap answer. It’s true that the bushmaster is nocturnal, out more in the
evening than the daytime, but that’s not given as the reason the hikers are attacked by
the snakes.
Just because something is true doesn’t mean that it’s the right answer to the question.
29. D. This question is tricky. Choice A states a fact; bushmasters do sleep during the day,
but that isn’t the main point of the paragraph. Choice B states a fact that seems logi-
cal, based on what we all know about wildlife in general (most animals — including
humans — will attack to protect their young and their food), but that’s not the main
point of the paragraph. Choice C is discussed in the last paragraph, which states that
the bushmaster’s coloration and silent warning system rarely alert humans to the
snake’s presence . . . but that’s not the main point of the paragraph. The main point 
(as introduced by the topic sentence of the paragraph) is that the bushmaster is not 
as ferocious and aggressive as its reputation would make you believe.
When a question asks you for the main idea, whether of the entire passage or of just a
paragraph, try to predict an answer before you look at the choices. Pretend that some-
one just asked you what you’re reading. Your response, which in this case may be
something like, “People think that this snake is more dangerous than it really is,” is the
main idea.
30. J. If you are rushed for time, a negatively phrased question (“Which was NOT . . .”) is 
a good one to guess at quickly. Answering this question is really like answering three
separate questions, because you have to find three questions the passage does answer,
and then by process of elimination, identify which question it does not answer. Para-
graph 4 talks about enemies of the bushmaster. Paragraph 3 discusses how a bush-
master locates its prey. The last paragraph explains why some people consider the
bushmaster aggressive.
Choice J can be a little tricky. The author mentions that the bushmaster has a strong
maternal instinct that is rare in snakes, but he never tells why the bushmaster had that
instinct. (If you missed this question, don’t feel too bad. Many people miss negatively
phrased questions, which is why I suggest that you not invest too much time in them.)
252
Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: Full-Length Practice ACTs 

Passage 4
31. C. Choices A and B are true statements but are much too specific to be a main idea. A
main idea, whether of a paragraph or of the passage, is broad and general. Choice D is
tricky, but goes too far. The passage neither states nor implies that a building cannot
be appreciated without understanding symbolism; it simply informs the reader of the
symbolism within the Capitol.
32. H. In lines 18–19, you are told that Lincoln’s body lay in state under the Rotunda after
Lincoln was assassinated. The other answers are neither given nor implied in the 
passage.
When you’re asked what the author means, be sure to go back to the passage and find
the answer in the context of the passage. Don’t try to use your common sense or
dredge up what little you remember from American history.
Bonus trivia: Speaking of Lincoln, did you know that one of his nicknames was the
Perpendicular Pronoun? The 6’4” president was criticized for using the word “I” in his
speeches, something considered improper at the time.
33. A. Irony is the opposite of what might be expected. One example always given is 
“the irony of the firehouse burning down.” Here, it is ironic, or opposite of what you’d
expect, that the symbol of America, the Capitol, is filled with works by foreign artists.
In choice B, ingenuity means cleverness, resourcefulness. Choice C, perspicacity means
shrewdness, perceptiveness.
Did you choose C on the theory, “Ooooh, big word, I don’t know what it means, it must
be the right answer!”? If so, you’re not alone. Many students automatically choose the
longest, hardest word. Usually, the totally bizarre word you’ve never seen before is put
there to trick you. Don’t choose a word you don’t know unless by process of elimina-
tion you’re absolutely positive that the words you do know are wrong.
34. G. This type of question is merely plug ’n’ chug; plug each answer choice into the con-
text and see which one works best. The sentence says, “ . . . more overt than symbolic,”
meaning there isn’t hidden symbolism, but an open, obvious meaning.
35. D. Paragraph three talks about the buildings being on fire, then says the conflagration
was prevented from destroying everything by the rainstorm. From this you may
deduce that a conflagration is a fire, and the fire was doused by the rainstorm.
If you chose A, you fell for the trap. The conflagration itself was not the rainstorm; just
the opposite.
36. J. The paragraph talks about how the fire was put out by a rainstorm, and the wind-
storm killed British forces. From this, you may infer that Nature helped save the Capitol.
Choice F is a value judgment: Who’s to say who is superior and who is inferior? Value
judgments are rarely correct answers. Choice G is a trap. It may be true that the British
superstitiously thought that the world was conspiring against them and in favor of the
Americans, but that implication is quite a stretch for you to make. Choice H is just
plain wrong. The paragraph tells you that the Capitol was damaged, but not destroyed.
37. C. Sometimes the obvious answer is in fact the correct answer. Paragraph four specifi-
cally says that most artworks tell a story about American history. The other answers
may in fact be true, but are not given in the passage. When a question begins with the
words, “According to the passage,” the answer is usually given very directly. This type
of question, in my opinion, is a gift to you. The only way to get it wrong is to outsmart
yourself, making the question seem harder than it really is.
38. F. An EXCEPT question (or any negatively phrased question, such as, “The author
would most likely DISAGREE with which of the following statements?” or “Which of the
following is NOT true?” is often a time-wasting question, a good one to guess at quickly
and go on. The only way to get this question correct is to find the answers to the three
other questions. You were told the definition of E Pluribus Unum (“Out of many, one,”)
in paragraph two. Paragraph four tells you that Lafayette was the first foreigner to
address a joint session of Congress. The last paragraph gives several examples of the
253
Chapter 20: Practice Exam 1: Answers and Explanations

subject matter of the paintings. The nickname “Women in a Bathtub” was mentioned in
the last paragraph, but no explanation of the nickname was given.
39. A. The passage talks about such patriots as Washington and Jefferson and Lafayette
and Penn. The author probably finds it surprising that a statue of a former enemy is
found among the others.
A little common sense goes a long way. Use the process of elimination to get this ques-
tion right. Nothing in the passage implies that only Northerners were honored. You
know there are statues of women as well as of men. And some of the people honored,
like Washington and Lafayette, are in fact military heroes, not civilians.
40. H. The author mentions men and women, Confederates and foreigners, doctors and
Indians. It is reasonable to assume that his purpose is to show the diversity of people
who have helped make America the nation it is. If you chose J, you were indulging in a
little wishful thinking! Yes, mentioning the man who invented ice cream may have been
slightly funny, but it’s unlikely the author was trying to provide any comedy in this 
passage.
Science Reasoning
Passage 1
Before going to the questions, make sure you have some idea about how the tables work. To
figure the relative humidity in Table 1, find a dry-bulb reading in the left-hand column and
move rightward to the appropriate difference between wet-bulb and dry-bulb readings. For
example, for a dry-bulb reading of 20°C, the relative humidity is 59% when the wet-bulb read-
ing is 5 degrees different from the dry-bulb reading. The major trend to note in Table 1 is that
humidity increases with higher temperatures (as you move down the table) and decreases
with increased differences between the two bulb readings (as you move to the right).
For Table 2, note that the apparent temperature, as explained in the sentence immediately
preceding the table, is what a given combination of humidity and air temperature would feel
like to a typical human. The table shows, for example, that the apparent temperature at 70%
relative humidity and an air temperature of 23.9°C is 25.0°C. The trends here are that appar-
ent temperature increases with increasing humidity, consistent with the common knowledge
that high humidity is uncomfortable, and that apparent temperature increases with increas-
ing air temperature, consistent with the commonsense notion that the hotter it gets, the
hotter it feels.
1. B. All four of the choices are between the 51.1 for 70% and the 57.8 for 80% (see Table 2).
Because 75% is halfway between 70% and 80%, the number you’re looking for should be
close to half way between 51.1 and 57.8.
Choice B is a little less than half way, but the number should actually be closer to 51.1,
the number for 70%. 51.1 is closer to 45.6, the number for 60%, than it is to 57.8, the
number for 80%. In other words, as the relative humidity levels progress evenly, the
apparent temperature intervals in this range are getting larger. The gap between the
apparent temperatures for 75% and 80% should be larger than the gap between such
temperatures for 70% and 75%. Choice B is 2.9 away from 51.1 and 3.8 away from 57.8.
2. H. The choices all have to do with the point at which air temperature and apparent
temperature are equivalent. According to Table 2, at an air temperature of 21.1°C, the
apparent temperature is the same at 60% and 70% relative humidity. When the air tem-
perature is 23.9°C, this equivalence occurs at 50% humidity. At 26.7°C, the humidity is
between 40% and 50%. This trend of having lower humidity to make the two tempera-
tures equal continues as air temperatures increase (as one moves to the right on the
table). Choice H is the only choice that expresses this relationship.
254
Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: Full-Length Practice ACTs 

Remember that one of the main skills to have when approaching Data Representation
and Research Summaries passages is to pick up on trends.
3. B. Did you look at Table 1, find the dry-bulb reading of 12°C, look across until you got
to 78% relative humidity, look up the table until you saw the number 2, and then put
down choice A? The problem is that the 2 represents the difference between the dry-
bulb reading and the wet-bulb reading. Read the introductory material to see that the
wet-bulb reading is lower than the dry-bulb reading because the evaporation of water
from the wet bulb lowers the reading. So the wet-bulb reading in this case is 2°C lower
than 12°C, or 10°C (choice B). If you were not able to pick up on the idea that the wet-
bulb reading is lower than the dry-bulb reading, you can at least figure that there is a
difference of 2 from 12, making the answer choice B or D. While even a wild guess is
appropriate on the ACT (because there is no penalty for wrong answers), a 50-50 guess
is certainly worth making.
4. G. To answer this question correctly, you must combine information from the two
tables.
Notice that trap answer F comes from simply subtracting 4 from 24 and that trap
answer H is obtained by adding 24 and 4. If you got either of these choices, you proba-
bly picked up on the word “different” in this question and didn’t engage the brain cells
sufficiently to think through how to get the apparent temperature.
Wrong answer J corresponds to the relative humidity that occurs in the situation
described in this question. To answer the question, you must take this 69% relative
humidity and go to Table 2. The 69% figure is close to 70%, so use the 70% row and
move under the column marked 23.9, which is close to 24, the dry-bulb reading, and
hence air temperature, in this question. The row and column match up at 25.0, making
the answer choice G.
5. A. While low moisture causes a greater difference between the two bulbs, as explained
in the introduction, don’t go for choice D so quickly. A look at Table 1 reveals that the
relative humidities for choices A, B, C, and D are 29%, 29%, 30%, and 31%, respectively.
To find the actual, as opposed to relative, amount of moisture in the air, one must,
according to the introduction, multiply these percentages by the maximum amount 
of moisture that the air can hold at the various temperatures. Because this maximum
amount increases with increasing temperature, choice A must be the answer over
choice B because the 29% is multiplied by a lower number in choice A. Choices C and 
D can be dismissed because both the percentages and the numbers these percentages
are multiplied by (the maximum moistures) are higher.
Passage 2
The important point to understand from the introductory paragraph is that the purpose of
the study is to test which drug makes subjects less drowsy.
Although the pharmaceutical company is probably concerned with how effectively its drug
alleviates hay fever, this factor is not measured in this study.
The description of Study 1 tells you that drowsiness was tested by counting the number of
errors that subjects made on a task that requires alertness. Picture yourself as an experimen-
tal subject. If you are drowsy from a pill as you perform a motor task that requires alertness,
how do you think you’ll do? You’ll probably make many mistakes. The statement that sub-
jects who made fewer errors were judged to be less drowsy concurs with your imagined sce-
nario. The rest of the description of Study 1 tells you that the two drugs were compared at
two different times, creating four groups of subjects. Each group had four subjects, making
the study symmetrical and straightforward to follow.
As with Data Representation passages, be sure to examine the data and look for major trends.
Table 1 reveals that the subjects taking the new drug made fewer errors on the average than
those taking the old drug. This difference was far more pronounced for the groups that were
tested one hour after ingestion. The errors associated with the old drug were much lower at
255
Chapter 20: Practice Exam 1: Answers and Explanations

eight hours than at one hour. This finding makes sense once you realize that the effects of
drugs tend to wear off with time. The new drug did not show this decrease in the number of
errors, perhaps because it wasn’t making its subjects too drowsy to begin with.
How does weight figure in? A scan of Table 1 shows that the heavier subjects made fewer
errors than the lighter subjects. The drowsiness caused by the drug seems to be greater in
those who are lighter. Some reflection on outside knowledge should help you understand this
finding: Who gets a higher dosage of a pain reliever, an adult or a baby? An adult who received
a baby’s dose would not feel much lessening of the pain.
Now that you’ve gotten a handle on Study 1 and Table 1, you can readily see what happened
in the next two studies. Study 2 was basically a repeat of Study 1 except that the experi-
menters took out a factor that caused some variability. Table 2 shows much of what Table 1
shows but also indicates that the new drug caused fewer errors than the old drug even at
eight hours. The difference in averages of the two eight-hour groups may not seem great
(34.75 vs. 30.75), but such a difference is probably significant when the table shows how little
variability there is within each group of four.
Study 3 was identical to Study 2 except that the subjects were lighter and female. The number
of errors was higher (remember how the lighter subjects made more errors in Study 1), but
the trend of the results was virtually identical to that of Study 2.
6. J. Note the purpose of the study mentioned in the introduction and the description of
Study 1. This study was designed to test the extent to which the drugs make test sub-
jects drowsy. It did not examine how effective the drugs were in relieving hay fever;
eliminate choice F. Choice J follows nicely from the analysis of Study 1 presented
above. Don’t choose answer G just because the numbers decrease. You must remem-
ber that lower numbers mean fewer errors, or a better performance. Choice H is wrong
because there are no data showing how well the subjects did on the task before taking
the drug. Such information is needed before one can conclude anything about the
drug’s improving performance.
7. C. Once again, the analysis of the results completed before looking at the questions
makes answering a question much easier. As stated in that analysis, the researchers
eliminated a source of variability by using subjects who were all of the same weight.
Choice C expresses this idea. With less variability, researchers can be more confident
that any differences observed between drugs or between times is a consequence of the
drug taken or the time since ingestion. Small differences between groups don’t mean
much if the results for both groups range widely. Such small differences may be signifi-
cant if one group is consistently a little higher than the other group.
Choice D is the easiest choice to eliminate. Where in this study can anybody learn the
weight of typical hay fever sufferers? A comparison of Studies 2 and 3 could provide
some information regarding choice A, but such information is already provided in
Study 1. Remember that the question is basically asking why the researchers went on
to conduct Studies 2 and 3. Choice B is tempting because the subjects in Study 2 were
male and the subjects in Study 3 were female, but the description of the studies does
not mention the sex of the subjects as something that was of major concern to the
researchers. Besides, the way Studies 2 and 3 are designed, it’s impossible to look at
them and determine whether the greater number of errors in Study 3 came about
because the subjects were lighter or because the subjects were female.
8. H. Here’s your chance to use some common sense. Study 2, as discussed above, may
have produced results with less variability, in contrast to what is stated in incorrect
choice J, but all Study 2, taken by itself, shows is that the new drug is probably better
with regard to producing drowsy side effects only for males of a certain weight. Choice
H is correct because it points out that Study 1 used a wider range of subjects. Choice F
may look enticing, but you do not know the sex of the subjects used in Study 1. Perhaps
the subjects in Study 1 were also all male. Eliminate choice G because the studies were
concerned with drowsiness, not the effectiveness of the drug.
256
Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: Full-Length Practice ACTs 

9. C. Here’s a way to save yourself some time. Scan the choices and notice that option II
has to be included because it appears in each of the four choices. Don’t waste time
trying to justify option II.
Table 3 indicates that the average for the one-hour group was 54.25 while the average
for the eight-hour group was 49.75. It is quite reasonable to expect that the average for
the two-hour group could be in between these two averages, so option III should be
included, and choices A and B are out. You may consider that both options I and IV are
within range, but think about the logic of option I. Why would the drug cause fewer
errors at two hours than at either one or eight hours? The results suggest that the
drug’s side effects wear off with time, so it does not seem reasonable that there would
be fewer errors at two hours than at eight hours. You may now eliminate choice D
because option I is out.
The only answer left is correct choice C. Move on before you drive yourself crazy trying
to understand why the number of errors could be higher at two hours (option IV) than
at either one or eight hours. The test-maker has given you a break by the way the
options are arranged in the answer choices.
Okay, okay! You insist upon knowing why option IV is reasonable? The drowsiness pro-
duced by the drug may not have peaked at one hour. Perhaps it peaks after one hour
before subsiding at eight hours or so. In addition, option IV is closer to the old-drug
averages in Table 3 than is option I.
10. F. The question tells you that the average you see for the old drug group eight hours
after ingestion is probably a bit lower than what would have been obtained had sub-
jects who were not particularly proficient at the motor task been used. With regular,
everyday, less-coordinated people, the average would probably be higher than the
41.75 shown. With this higher average, the gap between the new and old drugs would
be higher than the current 0.5 and would strengthen the claim, which can be made with
Studies 2 and 3, that the new drug produces less drowsiness at eight hours.
The next two choices have key flaws. To make a case for choice G, you would have to
know that the old drug at eight hours normally produces more errors than the old drug
at one hour. You may not assume that less-coordinated subjects would make that many
additional errors. Another problem with choice G is that it mentions side effects in gen-
eral while the study simply investigated drowsiness. The best way to get rid of choice
H is to realize that the choice mentions the drugs’ effectiveness, which was not investi-
gated in these studies.
Choice J makes some sense. Many studies do use the same subjects for different parts
of a study. One advantage of such an experimental design is that different groups are
equated for overall ability because the different groups have the same people. One
problem with choice J, though, is that the subjects may do better at eight hours not
because the drowsiness has worn off but because the subjects already had a chance to
practice at one hour.
A more serious problem with choice J is that it uses the extreme word “require.”
Remember that absolute choices are rarely correct on the ACT.
11. B. Even if you wanted to be ultraconservative and not recommend the new drug, the
reasons given in choices C and D aren’t logical. You have no way of knowing what the
patients will do, and even if you did, such information doesn’t have much to do with
the new drug versus the old drug. In fact, the evidence points to the superiority of the
new drug at both one and eight hours. If the individual is going to operate dangerous
machinery, it’s better that he or she do so with the new drug, which doesn’t produce as
much drowsiness. Choice D doesn’t follow from the information in the question or in
the studies, so get rid of it because the ACT does not expect you to start using some
specialized knowledge of the immune system. In addition, choice D provides no indica-
tion as to which drug is superior regarding its effect on the immune system.
Choice B is consistent with the studies and the information in the question and does
not make any outlandish statement such as, “The new drug is vastly superior to the 
old drug with respect to all short-term and long-term effects.” Choice A is out primarily
257
Chapter 20: Practice Exam 1: Answers and Explanations

because the ACT does not want you to practice medicine without a license. You would
have to know a lot more about the new drug’s pharmacological actions before making
such a statement. Another point is that the new drug seemed better than the old drug
when the dosages of the drugs were equated. Why would you say that the new drug is
okay only if the dosage is reduced?
Passage 3
The first two paragraphs and figures provide background information, as is often done on 
the ACT. Don’t worry about understanding all the details. The main point is that when water
levels rise, the waves are more likely to hit the bluff. When this happens, the bluff erodes.
Don’t waste time thoroughly analyzing each study or Figures 3–5. Often, you can use common
sense on these science passages. Study 1 shouldn’t shock you; you should expect that pre-
cipitation leads to greater lake depth.
Study 2 is somewhat more complex than Study 1. The key is to observe in Figure 4 that
higher temperatures are associated with lower water levels (less depth). This relationship
makes sense if you reason that high temperatures increase evaporation rate (don’t you dry
off fast when you get out of a pool on a hot day?), which, as stated, lowers water levels.
The results of Study 3 are similar to those of Study 2. Like high temperatures, strong winds
lead to high evaporation, which, as you have seen, lowers water levels. This relationship is
illustrated in Figure 5. Link Studies 2 and 3 together in your mind to help you nail down this
high temperature, strong wind, high evaporation, less water association.
12. H. A quick look at Figure 3 reveals that lake depth goes down as precipitation goes
down. Because lake depth is 5.0 m when precipitation is 15 cm/year, choices F and G
are unreasonable. Choice J is too precise and is also improbable. A doubling of precipi-
tation from 15 cm/year to 30 cm/year results in only a 0.5 m change in lake depth. The
change from 10 cm/year to 15 cm/year is not as great as the 15-to-30 change, so the
lake depth changing from 2.5 m to 5.0 m would not make sense. Choice H, although 
not certain, is a safe thing to say and is the answer. Such safe answers are good bets 
on the ACT.
13. A. Experimenters conducted Study 2 under the premise that temperature affects evap-
oration rate. The researchers already know that high evaporation rates lower water
levels. Figure 4 shows an association between high temperature and low water levels. If
high temperatures result in low water levels, and high evaporation rates result in low
water levels, high temperatures probably lead to high evaporation.
Remember, common sense counts when answering a question in this section. Choice A
is logical and fits in with basic science. You have probably observed that liquids disap-
pear faster when the temperature is hot. Also, when evaporating, water changes from a
liquid to a gas. Which state is associated with a higher temperature? The gas, so high
temperatures and high evaporation go together.
14. F. Although what happens to lake depth cannot be determined with certainty (because
several unmentioned factors are involved), the question asks what probably will happen.
Therefore, the most obvious choice is safe. Low precipitation is associated with low
water levels. High temperatures and strong winds increase evaporation rates, which
lower water levels. When all three factors are connected to low water levels, you can
safely say that the water level will be low.
15. D. Study 3 provides some evidence that strong winds can be good for the bluff because
such winds lower water levels. With low water levels, more waves will hit the beach
rather than the bluff. However, the word “definitely” in the question makes choice A
incorrect. Other factors, one of which is mentioned in choice D, also exist. Does the
fact that powerful waves can lead to erosion on the bluff make sense? Yes, it does, rein-
forcing choice D as the answer.
258
Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: Full-Length Practice ACTs 

As with choice A, choice B is wrong because you can’t definitely say things are good. In
addition, wind is more likely to erode the soil on the bluff rather than deposit soil on it.
Choice C is out because you can’t say that wind raises temperatures (which may be
good for the bluff).
16. G. The lake depth depends on the temperature and the amount of precipitation and
wind. In a cause-and-effect relationship, the cause is the independent variable, and the
effect or result is the dependent variable.
Another reason to pick choice G is that the other three choices all work the same way
in this investigation. The other choices are all factors that the scientist examines for
their effects on lake depth. If you want to select choice F, you would also have to select
choices H and J. Because three answers can’t all be correct, these choices must all be
wrong.
17. A. Because statements I and II mention nothing about the weather, strike them out. Doing
so quickly eliminates choices B, C, and D, leaving choice A as the answer. Statement III
helps because it is similar to the passage’s investigation but more direct; it measures
something on the bluff instead of water level, which can affect the bluff. Statement IV is
out because tides are the result of gravitational pull from the moon and the sun, which is
not a weather factor. Even if you are unsure of this fact, no choice presents III and IV only.
Passage 4
At last, a graph you can actually relate to. You probably know that a compact car gets more
miles per gallon than a full-size car does, as shown by the graph. The graph also shows that
for each car size, gas mileage is better at slower speeds — which is why, logically enough,
speed limits were lowered during the energy crisis of the 1970s.
The information presented before the graph is no big shock. When cars burn gas, they pol-
lute the air. The more gas burned, the more pollution. To put this idea together with the
graph, figure that the cars that get better gas mileage use less gas to travel a given distance;
therefore, they do not pollute as much as large cars do.
18. J. Reasoning backward from the preceding summary, the car that produces the most
pollutants is the one that uses the most gas. Which car uses the most gas? The one
that gets the worst gas mileage, choice J.
19. A. When you drive a car faster, you get fewer miles per gallon than when you drive that
car slower. This means that you have to use more gas to go a given distance.
Eliminate choice B because time isn’t the critical factor in your finding a gas station.
The probability of your finding a gas station increases with the distance driven, not the
time driven.
You probably eliminated choices C and D as soon as you saw that they began with
“Yes.” (Good for you!) Choice C looks tricky but is wholly irrelevant. If you are facing
being stranded in the middle of the desert, you probably don’t care too terribly much
whether your car is going to pollute. The key factor is whether you run out of gas.
(Besides, just because an environment is relatively unpolluted does not give you
license to pollute it.) Choice D is only half true. You will operate your car for less time;
however, gas consumption is a function of distance, not time.
20. G. The logical solution is to figure that the answer is in between the miles per gallon
for a full-size car driven at 50 mph and 60 mph. These figures are 26 and 24, respec-
tively, making 25 the answer.
Choice F is illogical. That gas mileage is worse than what a full-size car driven at 60 mph
gets. Remember, gas mileage should be higher when speed is reduced.
If you chose H or J, you made the test-maker’s day. These answers are designed to trap
careless readers who didn’t notice that the figures are the mileage that midsize and
compact (not full-size) cars would get at 55 mph.
259
Chapter 20: Practice Exam 1: Answers and Explanations

21. D. If you got this question right, congratulations — you’re thinking like a scientist.
Making projections beyond the range of numbers presented in a graph is risky. In the
graph, statistics are given for speeds between 50 and 70 mph. The 25-mph figure cited
is far outside of this range.
Try hard not to outsmart yourself. You can’t simply figure that if slowing down between
70 and 50 mph increases gas mileage, further decreases in speed will improve gas
mileage even more. Too many factors that you don’t know about are involved (for
example, the engine may have to work harder when lower gears are used at lower
speeds).
You need to recognize when you may make a reasonable extrapolation and when you
may be going too far, right into a trap. In the previous question, you can logically esti-
mate a number (because 55 is between 50 and 60, both of which were on the chart). In
this question, you can’t logically make an estimate because the chart does not cover
the number in question.
22. J. More gas is used when speed increases, which means that more pollutants are emit-
ted when speed increases. Only choice J shows that pollutants increase as speed
increases for the entire range of speeds.
Passage 5
Did you take one look at this problem and tell a friend, “Pull the plug; I’m obviously brain
dead!”? You don’t need to be intimidated by the terms. No one expects you to be a neurosur-
geon. All the ACT wants you to understand is that certain parts of the brain control certain
muscles in the body. The figures simply indicate the locations of these controlling regions.
23. D. Scan the Roman numeral options. A quick glance at Figure 2 reveals that III is true.
Much more of the motor area is dedicated to the hand, for example, than to the trunk,
narrowing the field to Choices B and D. If you’re in a rush or just want to get this horror
over with, make a guess. A 50-50 chance is pretty good odds on this exam.
Now here’s where you can use your test-taking skills, rather than using, well, your brain.
Did you notice that options I and II are contradictory? As a result, one option, but not
both, can be correct. A choice that presents I and III is not available (and remember,
you already deduced that statement III is right), so the only thing left is the correct
answer, II and III. Statement II, in fact, is correct. You can see how, starting from the
inside of the brain, the regions progress from toes, at the bottom of the body, to the
head.
Roman numeral questions can be very time-consuming. I often tell my students to skip
these questions and to leave them for last. However, if you can immediately say that one
statement is either definitely true or definitely wrong, you have narrowed the choices
down immensely. Before skipping this sort of question, at least take a look at it. You
may be in for one of the few pleasant surprises offered by the ACT.
24. H. One simple way to reason through this question is to see that the hand is much
larger than the areas for hip, shoulder, and brow. (If Choice F is the answer, then why
not G or J? They’re all about the same size.) And don’t forget to use your common
sense. You can logically think that the more complex areas of the body require more
brain control.
25. B. Figure 2 shows that the dot is in the knee area, narrowing the choices to B and C.
Because the left half of the brain controls the right side of the body (see the text before
Figure 2), the correct answer is Choice B.
In this figure, you see a classic example of how thinking about the diagram and the
accompanying notes for a few moments before jumping right into the problems can
help. The paragraph below the first figure states that one side of the brain controls the
opposite side of the body (left brain, right body, and vice versa). Knowing that fact
sends you quickly to the right answer.
260
Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: Full-Length Practice ACTs 

26. F. To know what areas H and J do, you would have to have specific science knowledge.
Unless you’re a brain surgeon, you probably don’t have all this info right at your finger-
tips. Remember that the ACT does not expect you to have specific knowledge but only
to deduce information from a chart, table, graph, or picture. The passage tells you
nothing about areas H and J.
Area G is near the top of the brain, which, according to Figure 2, is involved with the
lower part of the body. Area F is near the face, lips, and jaw area. These parts of the
body have more to do with speech (although you’ve heard of body language, your
knees don’t really chatter up a storm), making F the more logical choice.
27. D. This question (the entire question set, actually) deals with the motor area of the
brain, so focus on choices that mention muscles. Hey! Doing so is a quick process of
elimination: Choice D is the only possible answer.
Once again, don’t sweat about Choices A, B, and C. Knowing how the brain controls
these functions requires too much specialized knowledge for the ACT. The ACT wants
to make sure that your brain functions, not that you know how it functions.
Passage 6
The introduction is certainly simple enough. Try to rephrase it in your own words: Pigeons
are able to find their way home, but exactly how they do so is not known.
Try to identify one key point in each paragraph. In Paragraph 1 of the sun-compass hypothe-
sis, all you need to understand is that the birds seem to use the sun’s position to locate the
cup. Don’t get hung up trying to figure out more than that.
The main idea of the second paragraph is about internal clocks; when the internal clock pro-
vides incorrect information, errors result. This information suggests that the birds use the
clock and compare the clock’s info with the position of the sun.
This type of question isn’t called Conflicting Viewpoints for nothing. Just as you have the
main idea of the first hypothesis, just as you think you’ve grasped the logic, along comes a
second hypothesis. The magnetic-field hypothesis states that pigeons don’t always use their
internal clocks with the sun. But be careful not to go too overboard with this conclusion. All
the findings say is that when the sun is not available, the birds do not compare their internal
clocks with the sun to orient themselves. This is not to say that pigeons never use the sun,
even though the author of the magnetic-field hypothesis chooses to ignore it. The findings
simply suggest that the sun is not essential for orientation. Because the pigeons found their
way home, they seem capable of using other information.
Finally, rephrase the gist of the second paragraph. The paragraph presents some evidence
that shows that magnetic fields influence pigeon orientation. This evidence suggests that
pigeons may use the earth’s magnetic field to find their home but does not mean that they
must use the field.
28. G. The sun-compass hypothesis says that homing pigeons use the sun. Because the
pigeons can see the sun, they will use the sun and fly home. Choices F and H are more
consistent with the other hypothesis, which suggests that the magnetic field is a major
player in the birds’ orientation. Choice J has real problems: It’s inconsistent with both
hypotheses. If the sun is key, the birds will fly in the correct direction unless their inter-
nal clock is altered. If the magnetic field is the most important element, the birds will
continue to fly in random directions because the fields are distorted.
29. D. The magnetic-field hypothesis states that pigeons use the earth’s magnetic field to
orient themselves. A finding that shows that changes in this field change the way
pigeons fly is certainly consistent with this hypothesis. The experiments with the mag-
nets and electrical wires produced similar results, which were used to support the
magnetic-field hypothesis.
261
Chapter 20: Practice Exam 1: Answers and Explanations

Were you shrewd enough to notice that choices A and B basically say the same thing?
Because you can’t have two correct answers, both answers must be wrong. Besides,
choices A and B are much too extreme. The sun may be overruled by a large distur-
bance in the magnetic field, but to say that the sun has no effect is going too far. Choice
C has the same problem with extremism. The word “only” is too limiting (choices con-
taining “only” are rarely correct). The pigeons still seem to use the sun under normal
conditions.
30. F. If you chose J, you were 180 degrees wrong: Choice J is the major piece of support for
the magnetic-field hypothesis. Choice H is almost as bad as choice J; this info was also
used by the magnetic-field author. Choice G is consistent with the sun-compass hypothe-
sis, but the magnetic-field author can respond by saying that the magnetic field is a
factor that is sometimes overruled on sunny days. By process of elimination, F is correct.
With no sun, the sun-compass hypothesis would predict that the pigeons would have
trouble. On the other hand, the magnetic-field hypothesis would predict that the mag-
netic field should guide the pigeon, especially on a day when the sun was blocked.
31. A. Because a question like this one is hard to predict an answer for, go through the
answer choices. Choice A appears good. The author has to make this assumption
because if pigeons were affected by the mere presence of metal, the author could not
conclude that the magnets were responsible for throwing the pigeons off. Metal may 
be disorienting the pigeons. The material may not have to be magnetic.
Choice B is too extreme (remember, a hedging answer is almost always better than a
definite answer, so go for the wimpy words) and seems to contradict the author’s idea
that magnets are important. No information regarding what happens when magnets are
worn on sunny days is available.
The downfall of choice C is also extremism. The author may accept that internal clocks
may be used on sunny days. What makes this choice particularly bad is that it general-
izes to all birds. You have no information regarding other bird species, so you have no
way of knowing what the author assumes about this point.
And finally, choice D is wrong because the author may accept that the sun can be used
under certain conditions. The author’s main point is that magnetic fields are used.
32. G. Here’s a case where opposites don’t attract. If two statements are contradictory,
they can’t both be right. Eliminate choices F and J immediately because they include
both I and II together. Doing so means that statement III has to be correct (because the
remaining answer choices, G and H, both contain statement III). Don’t strain any brain
cells trying to think about it. (Okay, if you insist: Statement III is consistent with the
magnetic-field discussion. When the sun is wiped out as a factor, the magnetic field
plays an important role.)
Option I looks good because of its similarity to the sun-compass evidence cited in the
passage. Option II is out because the beginning of the passage rules out landmarks.
With I in and II out, only choice G can be the answer.
33. D. A major idea to get from this passage is that the two hypotheses present factors that
homing pigeons may use. The evidence does not suggest that the sun or the earth’s
magnetic field is essential. (Both hedging and looking for exceptions when dealing with
science passages are a good idea. Very rarely will you see an absolute, something that
must be true. Note the very safe, wimpy language in the correct answer, choice D.)
Evidence that brings up another possible factor does not contradict either hypothesis.
This reasoning eliminates choices A and B. Choice C is easily dumped. If barometric
pressure is consistent with one hypothesis, it has to be consistent with the other.
34. J. According to the sun-compass hypothesis, clock-shifted pigeons should make mis-
takes when light is present. The pigeons did not make mistakes, so choices F and G are
out. The magnetic-field hypothesis, on the other hand, uses evidence of clock-shifted
pigeons’ not making errors to build up support for its claim. Choice G is wrong because
pigeons did not respond correctly to the light, when you consider that a clock-light 
calculation should have pointed them in another direction. The pigeons did respond
262
Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: Full-Length Practice ACTs 

correctly, but they did not use the light to do so. If they had, they would have gone
another way. Choice J, the correct answer, is similar to what is presented in the first
paragraph of the magnetic-field hypothesis.
Passage 7
Start off by summarizing to yourself the passage’s main idea, which tells you why the pas-
sage was written. Although the introduction may seem long and complicated, all it is saying
is that the concentration of what you start with affects how fast you get a product as the
chemical reaction takes place.
When looking at the experiments, don’t get hung up on the chemical formulas. You can skim
over them for the moment. (And remember: You are not required to have any background
science to answer these questions. You do not need to memorize the Periodic Table or know
anything about chemistry.) Just try to identify the information the tables give and the conclu-
sions you can draw from the tables.
The key factor to note is that an increase of any reactant increases the formation rate.
Increases in H+ lead to larger increases in formation rate than do increases in the other two
reactants.
35. C. H3AsO3 is the product, so the change that increases the formation rate the most is
the change that produces more H3AsO3 in a given amount of time. As you deduced from
your analysis of the introduction, increases in H+ lead to the largest increases in forma-
tion rate.
36. G. The chemists varied only one concentration at a time, so you can easily observe
how each reactant affects the formation rate. For example, Table 1 shows that doubling
the concentration of H3AsO4 doubles the formation rate, while Table 3 shows that dou-
bling the concentration of H+ quadruples the formation rate. If both these reactants are
doubled, the formation rate is eight times the original rate, but without knowing any-
thing beforehand, scientists are not able to tell which reactant, if any, has a greater
effect on the rate.
In general, you can interpret experiments more easily when the experimenters change
only one factor at a time. This type of experimental methodology question is a frequent
one on the ACT.
The other choices do not make sense. Why would an explosion occur (choice F)? No
explosion occurs even when the concentration of a given reactant is four times the origi-
nal amount. You can reasonably think that changing the concentration of a couple of
reactants by small amounts would not lead to any calamities. This type of reasoning also
rules out choice J. In Experiment 3, scientists measure a rate that is almost 20 times the
original rate. Even if measuring greater rates is difficult, the scientists can take care not
to change the concentrations of two or three reactants by too great an amount.
Choice H is not at all PC (politically correct). The ACT will not have you believe that
scientists are not up to a task. Even if measuring two or more concentrations is difficult,
you can rest assured that the scientists will find a way. Besides, who said that the con-
centrations had to be measured at the same time? Why not measure each concentra-
tion separately and then dump all the reactants in at once?
37. D. How do the concentrations compare with the original concentrations, the concen-
trations that appear in the top line of each table? The concentrations of the first reac-
tants are doubled, while the concentration of H+ is the same. Table 1 shows that when
the concentration of H3AsO3 is doubled, the formation rate doubles from 2.8 to 5.6 rate
units. Table 2 reveals that doubling the concentration of I– also doubles the formation
rate. When each concentration is doubled, as in Table 2, the formation rate will be 2 × 2
or four times the rate obtained when the original concentrations are used (4 × 2.8 = 11.2).
38. F. With two liters of solution instead of one and the same amounts of reactants, the
concentration of each reactant decreases. In each experiment, increasing concentra-
tion increases formation rate, so decreasing concentration decreases formation rate.
263
Chapter 20: Practice Exam 1: Answers and Explanations

39. D. Get rid of choices A and B immediately. Why would the rate go down when the con-
centration of H+ goes up? Throughout Table 3, the rate increases. A sudden reversal
makes no sense.
Don’t fight the ACT. Rarely, very rarely, does the Science Reasoning Test contain traps
(as opposed to some other tests, such as the mathematics). The logical conclusion is
usually correct; the reasonable interpretation of a table or chart or graph is usually the
right one.
Did you choose Choice C? Don’t feel bad. It is tempting to think that doubling the con-
centration of H+ from 0.40 moles/liter to 0.80 moles/liter would double the formation
rate, but look at Table 3. Did doubling the concentration from 0.10 to 0.20 merely
double the rate? No, doubling the concentration quadrupled the rate, making choice C
too low. The answer is Choice D, which is quadruple the rate when the concentration
of H+ is only 0.40 moles/liter.
40. J. Uh-oh: Where did H2O come from? Don’t panic. The equation written in the introduc-
tion indicates that H2O is formed when H3AsO3 is formed. Well, what happens to the 
formation rate of H3AsO3 when reactant concentration increases? All the experiments
show that this formation rate increases. Because H2O is also formed when H3AsO3 is
formed, the increase in the formation rate of H2O makes sense.
Don’t think that questions in this test necessarily follow the same order of the passage.
That is, question one doesn’t have to come from the introduction and question six
from the last paragraph. As you just saw, the last question can be from the first part of
the passage. That’s one reason I suggest that you jot down your thoughts — your sum-
mary of the passage — in the margin of the test booklet. You may need to go back and
refer to your notes a few times.

Chapter 21: How to Ruin a Perfectly Good Day, Part II: Practice Exam 2
Passage 1
Food Trends
by Joel Shapiro
It has been a recent trend in the food service
industry toward lower fat content, and less
sodium. This trend, which was spearheaded by 
the medical community as a method of fighting
heart disease, has had some unintended side
effects obesity and heart disease — the very thing
the medical community was trying to fight.
Fat and salt are very important parts of a 
diet. It is required to process the food that we eat,
to recover from injury, to stay hydrated, and for
several other bodily functions. Fat and salt are
required parts of diet. When fat and salt are
removed from food, the food tastes as if it is miss-
ing something. As a result, people will eat more
food to try to make up for that something missing.
Even worse, the amount of junk food that people
eat goes up. Such as potato chips, soda, candy, and
doughnuts, my favorite. Junk food is full of fat and
salt; by eating more junk food people will get more
salt and fat than they need in their diet.

There is another interesting side effect of
removing salt and fat from food — less flavor. It
took me several years to figure out why the food
that I get at restaurants has had lesser flavor as
time went by, while the food that I prepare at home
has strong flavors. I discover the answer in a bowl
of chili. I had been making chili (my family’s
favorite dish and one that I serve at least once a
week) with low-fat meats, following the current
trend toward low-fat food. One day at the grocery,
the store had run out of the low-fat meat, so I
bought some meat with much higher fat content
than I normally get. The chili made from this meat
had a much better flavor than the previous chili.
From that point on, I experimented, with 
ingredients that were not low in fat. The resulting
dishes were much more satisfying than before. 
In addition, I found that people didn’t eat as much.
After talking to several, I discovered that they
found the meals much more satisfying than they
had in the past. Therefore, they ate less. As a result
of eating less, ending up eating fewer calories than
they had with the low fat meals. 12

[1] Salt is a more difficult ingredient to judge.
[2] If there is too much, the meal isn’t tasting well,
and diners will push the food aside uneaten. 
[3] If there isn’t enough, then the dish tastes like
something is missing and diners will eat more food
to obtain enough salt. [4] Salt also helps bring out
the flavors of the dish. [5] The trick is to find just
the right amount. [6] I generally do this by tasting.
[7] As I cook, I taste the sauce or food that I am
preparing. [8] If it tastes like “something is missing,”
then I add a little salt. [9] Stir it in and give it a few
minutes, and then try it again. [10] Eventually, 
it’s just right.
Fat and salt are important parts of any diet and
also important to the food that you cook. Having
enough in your meals will reduce the urge to snack
between meals (often on unhealthy, empty-calorie
treats) and will improve the taste and flavor of
your food. However, be careful not to go over-
board. Like anything, it is possible to have too
much of both, not good for the health. 15

F.
NO CHANGE
G. which is not good for the health.
H. not being good for the health.
J.
and that is for the health not good.

The author wants to conclude the passage by
emphasizing the importance of having the
right amounts of fat and salt, rather than elim-
inating them altogether. Which version does
that best?
A. NO CHANGE
B.
But don’t eliminate these vital ingredients
totally, or you won’t like the way your
food tastes.
C.
However, if you have no salt or fat, you
are likely to overeat and become obese.
D. Having no salt or fat is just as bad as
having too much, maybe even more so.

Passage 2
Native American Government
The question has been asked how Native
American tribes, whom govern themselves do so.
Most tribal governments are organized
democratic, that is, with an elected leadership.
The governing body is referred to as a council,
it is composed of persons elected by vote of 
the eligible adult tribal members. The presiding
official is the chairman, although some tribes use
other titles, such as principal chief, president, or
governor. An elected tribal council, recognized as
such by the Secretary of the Interior and the
people working for him, have authority to speak
and act for the tribe and to represent it in negotia-
tions with federal, state, and local governments.
Just what do tribal governments do? They 
generally define conditions of tribal membership,
regulate domestic relations of members, prescribe
rules of inheritance for reservation property not in
trust status, levy taxes, regulate property under
tribal jurisdiction, control conduct of members by
tribal ordinances, and they administer justice.

What role do Native Americans have in the
American political system? They have the same
obligations for military service as do other U.S. 
citizens. They have fought in all American wars
since the Revolution, they served on both sides 
in the Civil War. Eli S. Parker, a Seneca from 
New York, was at Appomattox as an aide to
General Ulysses S. Grant when Lee surrendered,
and the unit of Confederate Brigadier General
Stand Watie, a Cherokee, was the last to surrender.
It was not until World War I that Native American’s
demonstrating patriotism (6,000 of the more than
8,000 who served were volunteers) moved
Congress to pass the Indian Citizenship Act 
of 1924. One reads in your history books
about using the Navajo Marines of their language
as a battlefield code, the only such code that the
enemy could not break. Today, one out of every
four Native American men is a military veteran,
and 45 to 47 percent of tribal leaders is a military
veteran. 29

Mountains and Volcanoes
[1]The theory of plate tectonics hold that as
the expanding oceanic crust is thrust beneath 
the continental plate margins; it penetrates deep
enough into the Earth to be partly remelted.
[2]Pockets of molten rock (magma) result.
[3]Before Lassen Peak was emplaced, Mount
Tehama had collapsed, but its caldera was
breached, and no large lake ever developed 
as did Crater Lake in Oregon. [4]About 500,000
years ago, Mount Tehama gradually building up
here throughout countless eruptions. [5]These
become the feeding chambers for volcanoes, like
the great Pacific Ring of Fire stratovolcano, Mount
Tehama; remnants of its caldera flanks are Brokeoff
Mountain, Mount Diller, Pilot Pinnacle, and Mount
Conard.
[6]If you connect these peaks in a circle on 
the map, you can envision Mount Tehama’s base,
which was more than 18 kilometers (11 miles)
wide. [7]The park’s plant life mixes species of 
the Sierra Nevada to the south from those of the
Cascade Range. [8]The result is more species than
you can break a stick over. The park boast some

485 species. Of 38 transitional species, about 
24 Sierran species are at the northern limit of their
range here; therefore, about 14 Cascadian species
are at their southern limits. 
What was life like on these peaks? Sometimes
historians have difficulty determining that. The
Lassen area, for example, was a meeting point for
four groups of Native Americans: Atsugewi, Yana,
Yahi, and Maidu. Because of its weather and snow
conditions, generally high elevation, and seasonally
mobile deer populations, the Lassen area was not
conducive to year-round living. These Native
American groups encamped here in warmer months
for hunting and gathering. The Native Americans
left few artifacts. History generally describes the
period from 1840 on, even though mountain man
Jedediah Smith passed through in 1828 on his over-
land trek to the West Coast. Two pioneer trails,
developed by William Nobles and Peter Lassen, are
associated with the park. 43

Passage 4
One Boy’s Role Model
As a young boy, I having dreamed of following
in the footsteps of explorer Richard Halliburton,
who it is fair to say has been my hero since child-
hood. Let other boys dream of being Viking war-
riors or knights in shining armor. I have always
wanted to be a world-famous explorer, going places
no one has ever been, or returning to places where
civilization flourished long ago. Richard
Halliburton lived the life I always wanted to live
and wrote about it in ways that motivated me as a
youngster and still have the power to thrill me as a
man. I am especially fascinated by his stories of his
trip to Pompeii, which he calls the city that rose
from the dead. A few miles past Naples, Italy, along
the slopes of Vesuvius. This city is found, which is
much the same as it was in A.D. 79, with wine jars
still lying in place and the ruts in the streets from
the passing chariots still visible.
[1]He calls these chilling effects the volcano’s
“tantrums” and mentions that while the locals treat
them causally, he himself cannot help but think of
what future explorers would think if they found his
body, complete with tourist guide, wristwatch, and
toothbrush. [2]My favorite is, “Good health to any-
body who invites me to dinner.” [3]Neither too
wordy or too concise, the explorer’s writing appeals
to the secret fears of all of us by mentioning that as
he sat in his hotel room that evening and looked out
over the landscape, he could see flashes of red light
shooting up from the summit of Vesuvius.

Passage 5
Bird Mating Habits
The courting ritual of many birds that includes
elaborate dances and posturing. Some birds have
intricate set routines that never vary, patterns that
are repeated over and over again in a dance as old
as the species itself. Other birds appear to be
improvising, making up steps as they go along,
adapting their movements to fit the situation. Some
of the dancers appears more warlike than roman-
tic, with puffed-out chests and aggressive strutting.
Some of the dancers even charge the object of
their affections. A type of pheasant called the
tragopan pops out from behind a rock to show
himself to the female. 
While one would except
the female to be surprised or at least startled,
more often than not she is what one zoo curator
called “amazingly unimpressed.”
Another part of the mating ritual is to be
providing an appropriately enticing home, 
often called a bower, for the female. The nesting
areas are decorated with everything and anything
the bird can find, including twigs, feathers, small
rocks, also bits of trash bags and broken glass.
Some experts have noted that the birds with the
less attractive plumage, dull light brown birds with
no exceptionally attractive coloring, create the
more colorful and elaborate bowers, perhaps as
compensation.

Chapter 21: How to Ruin a Perfectly Good Day, Part II: Practice Exam 2
Not all birds are plain-colored. The male
tragopan (found in southern Tibet) has a bright
yellow face and a red head. The wattled pheasant
has a dark body but a fan of snowy, almost painfully
white tail feathers. He also has a blue wattle around
the head, and red irises in the eye region. The bird
of paradise can range from black to bright orange
and blue. You may know that a peacock has 
“eyes” on its tail feathers, but did you know 
that a pheasant is with them, too? The Argus
pheasant can raise his wing feathers which are
decorated with a pattern that seems to resemble
eyes. This is why the Argus pheasant got its name,
after Argus, the watchman in Greek mythology who
had a hundred eyes. Some birds are so stunning
that people who observed them in captivity,
brought back by explorers, theorized that the birds
must have come from the Garden of Eden, the only
place that could possibly support such beauty.
The courtship dances of birds have been emu-
lated by humans. In New Guinea, for example.
Warriors wear large headdresses made with bird of
paradise feathers, and dye their bodies to resemble
those of their favorite birds. The dances the men
perform are thought by some to resemble the
mating dances of those same birds.

Passage 1
Natural Science
When people hear the word “prehistoric,” they
think of animals, especially dinosaurs. But there
were prehistoric plants as well, and they were just
as unusual to modern sensibilities as the animals of
those ancient times. Among the most interesting of
prehistoric plants are the cycads, which flourished
65 million to 240 million years ago. The plants are
extant today, in areas as widely scattered as South
America, Africa, Australia and Malaysia. Although
they primarily live in the wet tropical or semi-
tropical habitats, some species can not only sur-
vive but thrive in arid regions as well. Scientists
long considered the widespread distribution of the
cycad a mystery, as the seeds were too large to be
carried by wind or ocean currents or birds. One
popular theory connects the migration of cycads to
the theory of Continental Drift. Briefly, Continental
Drift hypothesizes that at one point millions of
years ago, there existed just one continent, a super-
continent named Pangaea. Over the years, the 
continents separated, drifting apart and taking their
flora and fauna with them. Thus, the plants that
otherwise would be not as widely dispersed are
found in far-flung areas.
If these plants provided sustenance to the gar-
gantuan animals of that time (several times as large
as any animals alive today), the plants must have
been huge as well. Today’s cycads have trunks that
can grow up to 50 feet tall. But it is the cones that
are perhaps the most impressive. There are two 
different types of cones, pollen cones (which grow
on the male plants) and seed cones (which grow 
on the female plants), and these can be as long 
as 36 inches and weigh up to nearly 100 pounds.
One variety of seed pods produces bright red seeds.
These seeds are ground into flour and used as food-
stuffs by people in Africa. Some Japanese cooks mix
brown rice with the powdered seeds of some
cycads and ferment the mixture into a miso. In
America, the Seminole Indians of Florida used the
pith of cycads to make bread. Unfortunately, some
ground cycad seeds have been found to be carcino-
genic (cancer-causing) if not properly prepared.
There are also leaves on the cycad plant, 
which grow into a sort of crown and thus make
many people who merely glance at a cycad think 
it is a palm tree. The trunks may occasionally grow
underground, leaving an impression that the leaves
are growing directly out of the ground. In fact, 
many parts of the cycads are underground. Inside
the roots of the cycad are blue-green algae. The
conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia
is one way the cyanobacteria supply the cycad 
with inorganic nitrogen. It is fascinating to note 
that even though the cyanobacteria are in the 
dark underground, they have the same membrane
structure and pigments of other bacteria that thrive
in the sunlight. Why does this strange structure
remain? One theory is that evolution has not yet
had sufficient time to change the portions that at
one point had been essential to the plant’s survival.

Passage 2
Prose Fiction. This passage is adapted from
George Eliot’s Middlemarch.
The human soul moves in many channels, and
Mr. Casaubon, we know, had a sense of rectitude
and honorable pride in satisfying the requirements
of honor, which compelled him to find other reasons
for his conduct than those of jealousy and vindic-
tiveness. The way in which Mr. Casaubon put the
case was this:
“In marrying Dorothea Brooke I had to care for
her well-being in case of my death. But well-being is
not to be secured by ample, independent posses-
sion of property; on the contrary, occasions might
arise in which such possession might expose her to
the more danger. She is ready prey to any man who
knows how to play adroitly either on her affection-
ate ardor or her quixotic enthusiasm; and a man is
standing by with that very intention in his mind — 
a man with no other principle than transient 
caprice, and who has a personal animosity towards
me — I am sure of it — an animosity which he has
constantly vented in ridicule, of which I am as well
assured as if I had heard it. Even if I live I shall not
be without uneasiness as to what he may attempt
through indirect influence. This man has gained
Dorothea’s ear; he has fascinated her attention; he
has evidently tried to impress her mind with the
notion that he has claims beyond anything I have
done for him. If I die — and he is waiting here on the
watch for that — he will persuade her to marry him.
That would be calamity for her and success for him.
She would not think it calamity; he would make her
believe anything; she has a tendency to immoderate
attachment which she inwardly reproaches me for
not responding to, and already her mind is occupied
with his fortunes. He thinks of an easy conquest and
of entering into my nest. That I will hinder! Such a
marriage would be fatal to Dorothea. Has he ever
persisted in anything except from contradiction? In
knowledge he has always tried to be showy at small
cost. In religion he could be, as long as it suited him,
the facile echo of Dorothea’s vagaries. When was
sciolism ever disassociated from laxity? I utterly dis-
trust his morals, and it is my duty to hinder to the
utmost the fulfillment of his designs.”
The arrangements made by Mr. Casaubon on
his marriage left strong measures open to him, but
in ruminating on them his mind inevitably dwelt so
much on the probabilities of his own life that the
longing to get the nearest possible calculation had
at last overcome his proud reticence and had deter-
mined him to ask Lydgate’s opinion as to the nature
of his illness.
He had mentioned to Dorothea that Lydgate
was coming by appointment at half past three, and
in answer to her anxious question, whether he had
felt ill, replied, “No, I merely wish to have his opin-
ion concerning some habitual symptoms. You need
not see him, my dear. I shall give orders that he may
be sent to me in the yew-tree walk, where I shall be
taking my usual exercise.”
When Lydgate entered the yew-tree walk he saw
Mr. Casaubon slowly receding with his hands behind
him according to his habit, and his head bent for-
ward. It was a lovely afternoon; the leaves from the
lofty limes were falling silently across the somber
evergreens, while the lights and shadows slept side
by side; there was no sound but the cawing of the
rooks, which to the accustomed ear is a lullaby, or
that last solemn lullaby, a dirge. Lydgate, conscious
of an energetic frame in its prime, felt some compas-
sion when the figure which he was likely soon to
overtake turned around and in advancing towards
him showed more markedly than ever the signs of
premature age — the student’s bent shoulders, the
emaciated limbs, and the melancholy lines of the
mouth.
“Poor fellow,” he thought, “some men with his
years are like lions; one can tell nothing of their age
except that they are full grown.”
“Mr. Lydgate,” said Mr. Casaubon with his
invariably polite air, “I am exceedingly obliged to
you for your punctuality. We will, if you please,
carry on our conversation in walking to and fro.”
“I hope your wish to see me is not due to the
return of unpleasant symptoms,” said Lydgate, fill-
ing up a pause.
11.
Which of the following best expresses the
same idea as that given in the first sentence of
the passage?
A. Mr. Casaubon is justifiably proud of not
being jealous or vindictive.
B.
Mr. Casaubon justified his actions to him-
self in a way that didn’t make him seem
jealous or vindictive.
C.
Mr. Casaubon was ashamed of his jeal-
ousy and vindictive toward those who
pointed it out to him.
D. Mr. Casaubon is afraid of his wife’s jeal-
ousy and vindictiveness.

Passage 3
Social Science. This passage is adapted from 
How to Develop Self-Esteem in Your Child by
Dr. Bettie Youngs (copyright 1991 Bettie Youngs).
What is the work of childhood? Each stage of 
a child’s development presents its own set of 
tasks and demands, all focused on gaining self-
knowledge: selfhood. The work of each stage is
pretty well-defined.
Until the age of two, a child primarily views
himself as part of his mother (or father, if he is the
primary caretaker). Upon reaching two, he devel-
ops the ability to be aware that he is in reality sepa-
rate from her. This situation presents him with the
task of establishing autonomy — separateness. The
two words that best describe his new-found self-
hood, that he is in fact a separate person, are no
and mine. Possession is the tool he uses to enforce
that sense of separate self.
Having realized his separateness, the three-y
ear-old goes on to master his environment. Mastery
plays an important role in his perception of self. It
influences his feelings of being capable or not capa-
ble. His need for success in his endeavors at this
stage is crucial. He labors over each of his accom-
plishments. He is slow and methodical and takes 
forever to do each task. Needing feedback to know 
if he has been successful, he strives for recognition
of these achievements. (“Watch me, Mommy! Watch
me, Mommy!”) That he has something to offer nur-
tures his sense of competence and proves his value.
Parents are the name of the game for the five-
year-old. At this age, the mother is the center of the
child’s world. He not only wants to please her, but
he also wants to be near her, wants to talk with her,
wants to play with her, and wants to help her
around the house. The five-year-old’s adoration of
his parents is unquestionably heartwarming. The
result is almost totally parent-pleasing behavior. In
his determination to do everything just right, he’ll
ask permission for the simplest thing, even when he
needn’t; and he will then beam with pleasure when
the parent smiles and gives permission.
Age six can be described as the stage of “me-
ness.” Self-centeredness comes before other-
centeredness. While children were in the preschool
stage, they discovered that they were separate from
their parents, although they still kept their parents
as the center of their existence. At six, they must
shift the focus from their parents to themselves.
They now place themselves at the center of their
world instead of parents or others. Although they
may appear to be excessively self-centered and
unconcerned with the needs and feelings of others,
this is an important milestone in their develop-
ment. They are now ready to undertake the task 
of being receptive to their own interests and
attempting to understand them.
At age 16, it is not uncommon for a child to
experience feelings of being confused, embar-
rassed, guilty, awkward, inferior, ugly, and scared,
all in the same day. In fact, a teenager can swing
from being childish and petulant to being sedate, or
from acting rational to irrational, all in the same
hour. It’s a time of confusion and uncertainty. The
goal is to experience intimacy; he needs to belong.
This is a time of duality. The 16-year-old wants to be
with others, yet he wants to be alone; he needs his
friends, but he will sabotage them if they appear to
outdo him; he’ll root for a friend out loud, but he’ll
secretly wish for his friend’s failure. Age 16 is a time
when he wants total independence, but he is not
capable of it. He doesn’t really want to live without
his parents, although he believes that they are
roadblocks hindering his life.
The final stage of development in childhood is
establishing total independence. In changing from
being dependent on others to being self-dependent,
children confront some pretty big (and frightening)
issues. They have three tasks. Their first task is to
determine vocation. A child needs to ask what he is
going to do with his life. Underlying this task is the
self-esteem need to be somebody, to experience
positive feelings of strength, power, and compe-
tence. Second, he needs to establish values. The
goal is to sort out his own values and to decide
which ones to keep and which ones to discard.
Following this step is the only way that he can
develop integrity. Perhaps most striking is his need
to establish a workable and meaningful philosophy
of life. Reevaluating his moral concepts will mean
searching for his own personal beliefs, complete
with facing religious, ethical, and value-laden ide-
ologies. Developing personal convictions will be
influenced by his level of self-esteem, especially if a
conflict exists among what he believes, what his
family believes, and what his friends find accept-
able. Third, he needs to establish self-reliance.

Passage 4
Humanities
The months are familiar to everyone. Nearly
any small child can rattle off the twelve months of
the year. When students learn foreign languages,
one of the first exercises they practice is saying the
names of the months. Despite all that familiarity,
however, one important piece of knowledge is still
missing: an explanation of how and why the names
of the months came into existence. Who decided on
the names? Were the months named after people?
Did the months always have the same names
throughout history? The story of the months is a
fascinating one and deserves more attention.
Every month’s name tells a story. January is
named after Janus, a Roman god who was depicted
as having two faces, one looking forward and one
looking back. Janus is the Latin term for an arch or
gate (janua is door). The god Janus needed both of
his faces. As the guardian of doors or gateways, he
had to be vigilant for friends and foes coming from
either direction. Of course, January is the first
month of the year, but it wasn’t always so. Until
around 150 B.C., January was the eleventh month of
the year.
February is one of the few months not named
after a person. February is a form of februare, which
was the Latin word for “to purify.” This month’s
name came from the February 15 feast of purifica-
tion. On that feast day, people attempted to atone
for their sins and, by so doing, hoped to appease
the gods sufficiently to ensure healthy children and
abundant crops in the next year.
March is named for Mars, whom many people
have read about as the god of war. Few people real-
ize that originally Mars was the god of springtime
and new blossoms. Warriors would “take the winter
off” from fighting, resting while the weather was too
bad for battle. In the spring — around what we now
think of as March — battles would resume. From
this time line, Mars soon became more well-known
as the god of war than of springtime.
Not every month’s name has a definitive prove-
nance. Scholars debate the origins of the name of
April. Some writers and researchers claim that the
word is from the Latin term aperire, meaning to
open. The buds of new plants opened at this time of
year. Other scholars believe the name April is per-
haps the namesake of the Greek goddess Aphrodite
(abbreviated to Aphro). Aphrodite and Ares —
whose Latin name was Mars — were a couple.
Romantics prefer to think that as April follows
March, Venus/Aphrodite followed Mars.
May is also named after a goddess, Maika. She
was the goddess of plants. Because plants often
blossom in May, naming the month after the god-
dess has an indisputable logic. Not much else is
known about Maika.
Not every month retained its original name over
the years. For example, July and August weren’t
always known by those names. The original name
for July was Quintilis, “fifth month.” (Previously, 
the Latin calendar began with what is now March.
Therefore, the month of July was originally the fifth
month: March, April, May, June, July.) August was
previously called Sextilis, “sixth month.” Likewise,
September, October, November, and December were
the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth months. (The
roots sept, oct, nov, and dec are common in many
other words we use today. A septuagenarian is a
person in his seventies; an octogenarian is a person
in his eighties, and so on.) How did July and August
get their new names? When Julius Caesar was assas-
sinated, Mark Anthony ordered the Roman senate to
rename the fifth month, when Caesar was born, after
him. Quintilis became Julius, or July. Almost forty
years later, Julius Caesar’s relative, Augustus Caesar,
had August named after him. Augustus was born in
September but chose to give August his name
because that was the month in which he had made
several of his most important conquests.
The number of days in the months has changed
throughout the years as well. It was a Roman super-
stition that even numbers were unlucky. Therefore,
all months in the Roman calendar had an odd
number of days, usually 31 or 29. Even the number
of days in the year has changed. In order to bring
the Roman calendar back into sync with the solar
year, one memorable year, 46 B.C., actually con-
tained 445 days! The calendar of 365 days officially
began on January 1, 45 B.C. Even that, however, was
not sufficient to make the year balanced and equiv-
alent with nature. To remedy the discrepancy, in
1582, Pope Gregory XIII stated that the day after
October 4 should be October 15!
Of course, not every year has exactly 365 days.
Some, known as leap years, have 366 days. A trivia
question that many people believe they can answer
is, “When do leap years occur?” Most people
answer, “Every four years.” They gloss over one
very important fact, however. Not every fourth year
is a leap year. The century years — 1600, 1700,
1800, 1900, and 2000 — are not leap years unless
they are evenly divisible by 400. For example, 1600
and 2000 are leap years, but 1700, 1800, and 1900
are not.

Passage 1
In the pole vault, the pole acts to convert the
energy generated by an athlete running down a
runway into a force that lifts the athlete over a
crossbar. The most advanced vaulters use stiff
poles that quickly convert the horizontal energy
into the lifting force. Beginning vaulters are not
strong, fast, or skillful enough to bend a stiff pole as
needed to generate substantial vertical lift.
Beginning vaulters must use more flexible poles.
To test the suitability of two materials for use
in poles, scientists subjected three miniature poles
to two laboratory tests. Pole No. 1, made of fiber-
glass, is 50 cm long, with a diameter of 1 cm and a
mass of 1 kg. Pole No. 2, also made of fiberglass, is
also 50 cm long but has a diameter of 1.5 cm and a
mass of 2.25 kg. Pole No. 3, made of carbon fiber, is
50 cm long, 1.5 cm in diameter, and has a mass of 
1 kg.
Study 1
Scientists tested the three poles to determine
how much force is required to bend the poles to an
85-degree angle. Table 1 shows the results.

According to the results, what is the relation-
ship between the force required to bend a
pole and the time needed for the pole to snap
back to its regular position?
A. The greater the force required to bend
the pole, the more time required for the
pole to snap back.
B.
The greater the force required to bend
the pole, the less time required for the
pole to snap back.
C.
For only the fiberglass poles, the greater
the force required to bend the pole, the
more time required for the pole to snap
back.
D. For only the fiberglass poles, the greater
the force required to bend the pole, the
less time required for the pole to snap
back.
2.
On the basis of Study 1, what is the relation-
ship between pole mass and stiffness?
F.
The greater the mass, the stiffer the pole.
G. For a fiberglass pole, the greater the
mass, the stiffer the pole.
H. The less the mass, the stiffer the pole.
J.
Mass and stiffness have no relationship.
3.
Which of the following is a controlled variable
in this study?
A. pole diameter
B.
force required to bend poles
C.
time for poles to return to vertical
D. force generated when poles return to

Kinetic energy results from the actual motion
of an object, while potential energy is a meas-
ure of the energy that results if an object
moves from a certain location. During a pole
vault, at which times is virtually all the energy
in the form of potential energy?
F.
when the vaulter is running down the
runway
G. when the pole is bent
H. as the pole unbends and sends the
vaulter upward
J.
as the vaulter falls into the pit
5.
Ideally, vaulters like to use long poles because
the poles reach closer to the crossbar. If a
pole is too long, though, a vaulter has diffi-
culty carrying it down the runway because of
its mass. Given these considerations, which
material is best suited for a very long pole?
A. Fiberglass, because it snaps back rela-
tively slowly.
B.
Fiberglass, because it has a relatively
high mass-to-volume ratio.
C.
Carbon fiber, because it’s hard to bend.
D. Carbon fiber, because it has a relatively
low mass-to-volume ratio.
6.
On the basis of the entire study, which poles,
if they were proportionately enlarged for use
by a vaulter, are most appropriate for a begin-
ning and experienced vaulter, respectively?
F.
Pole No. 1, Pole No. 2
G. Pole No. 1, Pole No. 3
H. Pole No. 1, either Pole No. 2 or Pole No. 3
J.
Pole No. 2, Pole No. 3
Passage 2
Very few humans live to the age of 100. Another
way of saying this is that almost all members of 
the human population who were born in a given
year will die within 100 years. Scientists, health 
professionals, and life insurance agents are 
interested in examining how many people in a 
population will live to be a certain age. One way 
to measure this information is to look at how much
of the population has died after a certain number of
years. This information is presented in Figure 1.

Passage 3
A radioactive substance is one that contains
atoms whose nuclei change into other types of
atomic nuclei. For example, a uranium nucleus can
lose two protons and two neutrons and become a
thorium nucleus. Atoms of some radioactive sub-
stances change more frequently than others. Over
time, the rate of change for any substance slows as
a greater percentage of atomic nuclei change to a
final, more stable state.
Devices can measure the number of atomic
changes that take place at a given time. Each of
these changes is commonly called a disintegration.
Table 1 and Table 2 show the disintegration rates
for two unknown substances.

Passage 4
When sunlight heats the earth’s surface, much
of that energy is radiated back to the atmosphere.
Although some of this re-radiated energy escapes to
space, a significant amount of it is reflected back to
the earth’s surface by molecules in the atmosphere.
These molecules — water, nitrous oxide, methane,
and carbon dioxide — trap re-radiated energy as
glass in a greenhouse does and warm the earth.
Hence, the term “greenhouse effect” has been used
to refer to the warming of the earth caused by the
gases’ keeping heat within the earth’s atmosphere.
Scientists agree that the greenhouse effect
results in higher temperatures on earth but disagree
as to whether recent increases in atmospheric
carbon dioxide will lead to undesirable global
warming. Two scientists discuss this possibility.

Scientist 1
Ancient ice cores from Antarctica indicate that
the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmos-
phere and global mean temperatures have followed
the same pattern of fluctuations in levels over the
past 160,000 years. Therefore, the increase in
atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration from
280 parts per million to 360 parts per million that
has occurred over the past 150 years points to sig-
nificant and detrimental climatic changes in the
near future. The climate has already changed: the
average surface temperature of the earth has
increased 0.6°C in the past hundred years, with the
ten hottest years of that time period all occurring
since 1980. Although 0.6°C may not seem large,
changes in the mean surface temperature as low as
0.5°C have dramatically affected crop growth in
years past. Moreover, computer models project
that surface temperatures will increase about 2.0°C
by the year 2100 and will continue to increase in the
years after even if concentration of greenhouse
gases is stabilized by that time. If the present trend
in carbon dioxide increase continues, though,
carbon dioxide concentration will exceed 1,100
parts per million soon after 2100 and will be associ-
ated with a temperature increase of approximately
10.0°C over the present mean annual global surface
temperature.
Scientist 2
The observed increases in minor greenhouse
gases such as carbon dioxide and methane will not
lead to sizeable global warming. Water vapor and
clouds are responsible for more than 98% of the
earth’s greenhouse effect. Current models that proj-
ect large temperature increases with a doubling of
the present carbon dioxide concentration incorpo-
rate changes in water vapor, clouds, and other fac-
tors that would accompany a rise in carbon dioxide
levels. The way these models handle such feedback
factors is not supported by current scientific knowl-
edge. In fact, there is convincing evidence that
increases in carbon dioxide concentration would
lead to changes in feedback factors that would
diminish any temperature increase associated with
more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The cli-
matic data for the past hundred years show an
irregular pattern in which many of the greatest
jumps in global mean temperature were too large to
be associated with the observed increase in carbon
dioxide. The overall increase of 0.45°C in the past
century is well under what the models would have
predicted given the changes in carbon dioxide con-
centration. As with the temperature models, recent
increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide have not
risen to the extent predicted by models dealing
solely with carbon dioxide levels. The rate of
carbon dioxide concentration increase has slowed
since 1973. Improved energy technologies will fur-
ther dampen the increase so that the carbon diox-
ide concentration will be under 700 parts per
million in the year 2100.
17.
Which of the following is an assumption made
by Scientist 1?
A. Feedback factors have little effect on the
magnitude to which increased carbon
dioxide will increase temperature.
B.
Humans will not be able to limit their
activities that contribute to rising carbon
dioxide levels.
C.
A rise in the global mean temperature of
1.0°C is not significant.
D. Temperature fluctuations will match
carbon dioxide changes when carbon
dioxide changes are abrupt.

A scientific article stated that “Scientists will
soon develop computer models that accu-
rately account for feedback factors.” Which of
the scientists’ viewpoints, if any, is(are) con-

19.
Which of the following is the most likely
reason that the two scientists present differ-
ent figures for the temperature rise that has
occurred over the past hundred years?
A. It has been difficult to determine the
mean global temperature with complete
accuracy.

Scientist 2 uses figures that do not take
account of the rise in atmospheric carbon
dioxide.

Passage 5
Angiosperms, or flowering plants, typically 
produce flowers seasonally. The various
angiosperm species produce their flowers at 
different times of the year. For example, some 
flowers bloom in early spring, while others bloom
in the summer. Research has shown that these 
flowering plants respond to changes in day length.
A cocklebur, for example, does not produce flowers
during the time of year that has days longer than
15.5 hours. When the length of day drops below
this figure, flowering occurs. This type of flower is
known as a short-day (SD) plant. Long-day (LD)
plants do the opposite. These plants do not flower
until the length of day exceeds a certain critical
value. Plants that do not respond to changes in 
day length are called day-neutral (DN) plants. The
following experiments investigate what aspect of
changing day length is responsible for the plants’
responses.
Experiment 1
Botanists raise both SD and LD plants in a
greenhouse under long-day conditions. As
expected, SD plants do not flower, and the LD
plants do flower. When a brief period of darkness
interrupts a long day, the plants continue to flower.

302
Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: Full-Length Practice ACTs 
Experiment 2
Scientists raise both SD and LD plants in a
greenhouse under short-day conditions. The SD
plants do flower, and the LD plants do not flower.
When a brief flash of light interrupts the long night,
the SD plants stop flowering, and the LD plants
began to flower.
Experiment 3
Experimenters perform a yearlong study in
which they raise both SD and LD plants in several
greenhouses. The light/dark cycle corresponds to
the day length changes that occur over the course
of a year. Daytime temperatures differ in each
greenhouse. All SD plants flower at the same time of
year. As expected, all LD plants flower at a different
time than the SD plants do, but the LD plants all
flower at the same time when compared to one
another.
Experiment 4
Conditions are identical to those of Experiment
3, except that daytime temperatures are the same
across greenhouses, while nighttime temperatures
vary. SD and LD plants still flower at different times
of the year, but the plants vary considerably as far 
as when each plant begins to flower. For example, 
SD plants in greenhouses with warmer nighttime
temperatures flower at a different time than do SD
plants in cooler greenhouses.
24.
On the basis of Experiments 1 and 2, which of
the following is the most critical factor in

27.
Are the results of Experiments 3 and 4 consis-
tent with the results of Experiments 1 and 2?
A. No, because Experiments 3 and 4 use a
wider variety of plants.
B.
No, because the temperature is not
changed in Experiments 1 and 2.

Yes, because both sets of experiments
suggest that the plants respond to a night
factor rather than a day factor.
D. Yes, because both SD and LD plants are
used in all the experiments.

Passage 6
Matter exists in three phases: solid, liquid, and
gas. In general, these phases are defined by how far
apart the particles in the substance are. Particles
are typically closest together in a solid and farthest
away from one another in a gas.
Temperature is clearly related to phases. When
temperature rises, particles move faster and away
from one another. As temperature increases, matter
changes from a solid to a liquid to a gas.
Pressure also affects phases of matter. A sub-
stance that is a gas at a certain temperature and
low pressure may become a liquid at the same tem-
perature if pressure is increased.
The figures that follow summarize the relation-
ship among temperature, pressure, and phase for
both bromine and water:

F.
Bromine changes from a gas to a liquid.
G. Bromine changes from a liquid to a gas.
H. Water changes from a solid to a liquid.
J.
Water changes from a gas to a liquid.
33.
For which of the following are the particles
farthest apart?
A. bromine at –10°C and 1.00 atm
B.
bromine at 50°C and 0.80 atm
C.
water at 0°C and 0.40 atm
D. water at 100°C and 0.60 atm
34.
At high altitudes, pressure is lower, and soft-
ening spaghetti in boiling water (temperature
at which liquid changes to a gas) takes longer.
Which of the following is the most reasonable
explanation for this effect?
F.
Ice crystals form on the spaghetti.
G. Air temperature is lower at high altitudes.
H. The boiling point is lower at lower pres-
sure. Lower temperatures are not as
effective in softening spaghetti.
J.
At lower pressure, water boils at a higher
temperature. Reaching this temperature
takes longer.
Passage 7
Radon is a gas that is emitted from the earth’s
crust in small quantities. Radon can readily be
detected in wells. An accidental discovery of exces-
sive radon emission in an earthquake-prone area
led seismologists to study the association between
radon emission and earthquakes. Such an associa-
tion could prove valuable in perfecting ways to pre-
dict earthquakes.

Study 1
Scientists selected four sites that had experi-
enced recent earthquakes and measured radon
emissions in wells located near the epicenter (the
point on the earth’s surface above the focus of an
earthquake). At each well, the scientists recorded
the percent that the radon emission exceeded the
average radon emission found in wells throughout
the world. This percentage was called the differen-
tial. These measurements are depicted in Figures 1
through 4.

Study 2
To study whether the differential varied with
the magnitude of an earthquake, seismologists
made a scatter plot of the average differential
against earthquake magnitude for each site. 
Figure 5 shows this scatter plot.
35.
Which of the following is the most reasonable
conclusion that can be drawn from Study 1?
A. No association is present between earth-
quakes and increased radon emissions.
B.
Some evidence suggests an association
between earthquakes and increased
radon emissions.
C.
Radon emissions of wells more than 1,000
km from the epicenter did not increase.
D. The radon emission right at the epicenter
is more than 5 percent greater than
normal levels for the entire earth.
36.
Which of the following would strengthen the
claim that increased radon emissions are
associated with earthquakes?
I.
more well sites in the vicinity of each epi-
center showing higher than normal radon
emissions
II.
a location that had a 7.9 magnitude quake
and an average emission differential of 3.6
III. more earthquakes at the epicenters
depicted in Figures 1 through 4
F.
II only
G. III only
H. I and II only
J.
I and III only
37.
Can it be determined from the results that
radon emissions cause earthquakes?
A. No, because the results merely suggest
that earthquakes and increased radon
emissions occur at about the same time.
B.
No, because the differentials would have
to exceed 4 percent at all well sites to
make such a condition.
C.
Yes, because every well site had higher-
than-normal radon emissions.
D. Yes, because the radon comes from
beneath the earth’s surface.
Go on to next page

38.
Which of the following is an important control
condition that is lacking in the studies?
F.
radon emissions from a well very distant
from the epicenter
G. radon emissions from sites that experi-
enced earthquakes of magnitude greater
than 8.0
H. radon emissions from sites that haven’t
had an earthquake in over 400 years
J.
radon emissions from the Study 1 sites
when no earthquake took place
39.
What type of study needs to be done to help
determine whether radon emissions can be
used to predict earthquakes?
A. measuring radon emissions before an
earthquake takes place
B.
measuring radon emissions as an earth-
quake takes place
C.
measuring radon emissions around epi-
centers for quakes weaker than 6.9
D. measuring radon emissions around epi-
centers for quakes stronger than 7.9
40.
What is most puzzling about the China
results?
F.
The China earthquake was the strongest
earthquake studied.
G. One well showed a differential of 4.4,
higher than that of any other well in the
studies.
H. The wells closest to the epicenter had
lower differentials than those farther
away.
J.
Readings were taken from six wells.

Chapter 21: How to Ruin a Perfectly Good Day, Part II: Practice Exam 2
Three of the tests of the ACT feature subscores as
an added bonus (think of these as a “gift with pur-
chase”). In 20-plus years of tutoring for the ACT 
(I started when I was a mere child, you see), few
students have cared about the subscores. By the
time you get through this book, you should pretty
much know which sections are your best and which
are your weakest. However, you’ll see subscores on
your score report, so a few words about them are
necessary.
English Test
The English test has 40 questions in the
Usage/Mechanics subscore area and 35 questions
in the Rhetorical Skills subscore area — a total of
75 questions. (See Chapter 5 for more info on the
types of questions on the English Test.) Because I
wrote these practice exams to give you more prac-
tice with the types of questions that my experience
shows students have the best chance of getting cor-
rect with practice, this breakdown isn’t really appli-
cable to the practice exams in this book. Besides,
students get headaches trying to understand the
fine distinctions between what is rhetorical and
what is not. Don’t worry about it.
Mathematics Test
The actual ACT Mathematics Test usually has 24
prealgebra/elementary algebra problems, 18 
intermediate algebra/coordinate geometry prob-
lems, and 18 plane geometry/trig problems — a
total of 60 questions. Good news! The ACT has only
four trig questions, so if you haven’t had the subject
yet, don’t panic.
However, because this book is a teaching book and
not the actual ACT, I’m not going to put you
through the trauma of subscores. Besides, there are
many gray areas in which one person is convinced
that a problem is elementary algebra but another
argues it’s intermediate algebra or worse. Here’s
the simple solution: Be able to do all the problems
(easy for me to say!), and don’t worry about type-
casting and labeling them.
Reading Test
The Reading Test subscores couldn’t possibly be
any easier. You get a subscore for questions in
social studies/sciences (20 questions, based on 2
passages) and arts/literature (20 questions, based
on 2 passages).
Science Reasoning Test
The Science Reasoning test has no subscores.
Getting Down to the Nitty-Gritty: Subscores
Score One for Our Side: The Scoring Key
The ACT scoring may be weird (Why a 36? Why not a 21 or a 49 or a 73?), but it is very straightforward.
Follow these simple directions to score your practice exam.
1. Count the number of correct responses in each of the practice tests: English, Mathematics,
Reading, and Science Reasoning.
Do NOT subtract any points for questions you missed or questions you didn’t answer. Your score is
based only on the number of questions you answered correctly. That number is called your raw
score.
2. Locate your raw score on the following table. Move to the left or right and find the scaled score
that corresponds to your raw score.
For example, a raw score of 50 on the English Test gives you a scaled score of 21.
3. Add your four scaled scores. Divide that sum by 4. The resulting number is your composite
score.
For example, if your scaled scores were 23, 31, 12, and 19, your composite score would be 
85 ÷ 4 = 21.25, or 21.

Practice Exam 2: Answers 
and Explanations
N
ow you’ve done it! You’ve completed the practice exam, checked your answers
against the key, and found your score on the Raw Score chart.
Hang on! Invest another hour or so to go through this chapter, reading why one answer was
correct and the others weren’t. Along the way, you’ll find tons of tips and traps — valuable
information that you’ll be able to use when you face the Big One.
Keep in mind that any words marked like this are vocabulary words to add to your vocabu-
lary list.
English Test
Passage 1
1. C. The word “it” should send off warning bells and buzzers. “It” is often misused and
abused. The word “it” should have an antecedent, a word it refers to and replaces. Here,
there’s no antecedent. Choice B is wrong because the “recent trend” is singular, requir-
ing the singular verb (has) not the plural verb (have). Choice D turns the sentence into
a fragment, which is an incomplete thought.
2. G. Chapter 4 discusses the difference between effect and affect. An effect is a result and
is correct here (to affect is to concern or influence: Your not knowing the distinction
between these two words can adversely affect your ACT score). Knowing effect is cor-
rect enables you to narrow the answer choices down to F and G. Choice F is wrong
because there needs to be a break between “effects” and “obesity,” either punctuation
or a conjunction.
3. C. The pronoun refers to two things, fat and salt, such that you need the plural pronoun
“they,” not the singular pronoun “it.” Choice D would make the sentence a fragment.
Some students get into the bad habit of choosing OMIT every time they see it. Although I
can understand your urge to toss out everything you can get your hands on (including
those annoying proctors who call time before you’re finished), doing so isn’t always
the best policy.
4. J. The sentence repeats what was said in the second sentence of the paragraph and
doesn’t add anything. Good writing is short and to the point. Be careful not to change
something just for the sake of change; make a change only if it corrects a grammatical
mistake or improves the passage.
5. B. Although you may desperately be seeking for an answer that says, “None of the
above; they all stink,” alas, no such choice exists. Choice B is the best of the sorry lot.

The original is a fragment, an incomplete sentence. Choice C is also a fragment. Choice
D changes the meaning of the sentence (making it sound as if all four selections are the
favorites).
6. G. The author means to imply that the restaurant food is getting progressively blander.
“Lesser” is rarely right on its own. It’s most commonly used in a phrase such as “a lesser
man would have thrown his book out the window, but I held on to mine.” Usually, “less”
is correct. Choice J is wrong because least implies a comparison of at least three items,
not the two (home cooking and restaurant food) discussed here.
7. C. From the context of the passage, you know that the verb needs to be in the past
tense; thus, “discovered” is correct.
Often, to determine the tense of a verb, you need to read a little bit ahead in the pas-
sage. The next sentence says that “I had been making. . . .” If you read the underlined
portion only or otherwise read it out of context, you’re likely to fall for the trap that the
test-makers have set for you.
8. F. The original version is fine, as it implies that the current chili has a better flavor than
the previous chili did. Note that if you put G or H or J, you’re saying this chili has a
better flavor than did the flavor of the previous chili.
This is a particularly difficult question. You find out in Chapter 4 that you have to com-
pare similar items. For example, you wouldn’t say, “The flavor of the ice cream is better
than the cake,” because there you’re comparing flavor to cake, whereas you mean to
compare the flavor of the ice cream to the flavor of the cake. That type of mistake is
common on the ACT, but in the case of question 8, the original was fine.
9. D. A comma is a short pause; a semicolon is a complete stop. There must be a complete
sentence (an independent clause) before and after a semicolon, which eliminates choices
B and C. Choice A is wrong because there is no need for a pause after “experimented.”
Commas can be confusing. My general rule is, “When in doubt, leave it out.” Although
commas are often necessary, my experience has been that people overuse them.
10. H. Talking with several what? The original sentence leaves you hanging. Clarify it by
adding the word “people.”
11. D. Beware of -ing words. Although they’re not always incorrect, they’re misused often
enough to make you paranoid and neurotic whenever you see them. The original ver-
sion is a fragment, as is choice C. Choice B is wordy and redundant when inserted into
the question. Choice D not only adds the subject “they” but makes the sentence better
by changing the second verb to “consume.”
12. G. This type of question is a real time-waster. If finishing this section on time is difficult
for you, skip this type of question. Remember that no penalty in assessed on the ACT
for wrong answers; always fill in some sort of guess. Simply don’t waste time here
because to answer the question correctly, you have to go back and reread the para-
graph, probably several times.
In this instance, put the addition after sentence 1, such that you expand on the idea in
sentence 2 that when there isn’t enough salt, people will eat more food.
13. C. This question should have been relatively simple. As discussed in Chapter 4, “good”
describes a characteristic, as in good food, good meal, or good cook. “Well” tells how
something is done: You cook well. The only way the food couldn’t taste well is if the
food has taste buds and they are not functioning as they should! Choice D has two
errors. It sounds as though the meal itself is doing the tasting, and — if that were so —
it would taste well, not good.
14. G. Adding the word “which” makes the sentence correct. Choice H has the dreaded
word “being,” which is often found in trap answers. Choice J sounds like Yoda from Star
Wars, with the order of the words stilted and awkward.
312
Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: Full-Length Practice ACTs 

15. A. What a horrible selection of answer choices! Each one is wordy and unnecessary.
The author already does a good job in the final passage of concluding with his opinion
that too much salt and fat are bad, but those ingredients can’t be totally eliminated.
The answer choices don’t present a better way of stating that idea.
Passage 2
16. G. This question primarily tests “who” versus “whom.” “Who” is a subject and does the
action of the sentence. In this case, “who” is doing the governing. “Whom” is an object
and receives the action. For example, you may say, “Whom do they govern?” In that
case, the “whom” would be the ones being governed or receiving the action of the 
governing.
Again, if you confuse who and whom, substitute “him,” with an m for “whom” with an
m. If “him” works, “whom” is necessary. If “him” does not work, use “who.” Knowing
that “who” is required eliminates choices F and J. Choice H does not fit when rein-
serted into the sentence.
17. B. An adverb, which usually ends in -ly, answers the question how. How are most tribal
governments organized? Democratically. Choice C is tempting. Choice C is grammati-
cally correct, but choice C is also unnecessarily awkward and prolix. (No, prolix isn’t
an expensive brand of watch. Prolix just means wordy.) It isn’t necessary to say a gov-
ernment is organized in a democracy, but rather, democratically. Choice D makes no
sense. Omitting the underlined portion makes the sentence read, “Most tribal govern-
ments are, that is, with an elected leadership.”
Many students fall into a bad habit on this exam. They choose the OMIT answer every
time that they see it. OMIT has no better or worse chance of being correct than does
any other answer choice.
18. J. The original is a run-on sentence, two sentences (independent clauses) incorrectly
joined. The ability to use a period instead of a comma is a good hint that the sentence
is a run-on. Eliminating the subject of the second sentence, “it,” makes the second por-
tion subordinate and thus part of one complete sentence. Choice G sounds tempting,
but it changes the meaning of the sentence. The conjunction “however” indicates that
the second sentence is changing (or in some way contradicting) the first sentence. This
situation is not the case here. The same error eliminates choice H. The sentence does
not need a but.
19. A. This question tests the distinction between “principal” and “principle.” Principal
(with a -pal) means main or primary. (You may have learned in about sixth grade that
“The principal is your pal, your buddy.”) Principle (with an -le) is a rule. Eliminating the 
-le option immediately narrows the choices down to only one.
This type of question is one that you should always be able to get right. It tests a dic-
tion error, two commonly confused words. Diction errors are discussed at length in
Chapter 4. Be sure that you have these diction twosomes memorized before the exam.
Correcting a diction error is, in general, much easier than correcting, for example, a
verb-tense error or answering a question on the meaning of the passage.
20. H. If you missed this easy question, pack your bags — you’re going on a guilt trip. This
situation is a typical subject-verb agreement problem. The subject of the sentence is
“an elected tribal council.” Council is singular and requires the singular verb “has.”
Did you let yourself get bamboozled by the prepositional phrase? “Of the Interior and the
people working for him” is a prepositional phrase (of is a preposition). Prepositional
phrases do not affect subject-verb agreement (this concept is covered in Chapter 4).
21. A. Tribe is singular. You say “the tribe is” not “the tribe are.” (Tribe is a collective noun.
Collective nouns look plural, but they are always singular. Collective nouns are dis-
cussed in Chapter 4.) Because tribe is singular, it requires a singular pronoun, “it,”
rather than “them.” Eliminate choices C and D because of the plural pronoun them.
313
Chapter 22: Practice Exam 2: Answers and Explanations

Have you noticed how often you may use a diction rule or a “twosomes” concept to
narrow the answers quickly down to two? Be sure that you have memorized all the two-
somes discussed in Chapter 4.
Choice B has an -ing verb, always a suspicious character. If you insert it back into the
sentence, you’ll see that “be representing” changes the flow of the sentence: “. . .
authority to speak and act for the tribe and be representing it. . . .” Verbs in a series
must be in parallel forms: to speak, to act, to represent.
22. F. The sentence is satisfactory as is. Verbs in a series must have parallel forms. “Tribal
governments define . . . regulate . . . prescribe . . . levy,” and so on.
Did you notice the error in Choice G? Regular is not the same word as regulate. Be care-
ful not to anticipate, to read the word you expect to see rather than the word that’s
actually on the page.
23. C. No need to break into a cerebral sweat for this pretty simple question. Verbs in a
series must be in parallel form. This very long sentence has a number of verbs, and all
are in the simple present: “define,” “regulate,” “prescribe,” “levy,” “regulate,” and “con-
trol.” The last verb must be in the same form as well: “administer,” eliminating choices
B and D immediately. The original unnecessarily adds a subject, they.
24. J. Ahh, did you immediately eliminate J because of the -ing verb? If so, I gotcha! You
know that -ing verbs almost always are wrong — but not always. In this case, the origi-
nal looks correct until you read the entire sentence. “They have fought . . . they served.”
Because the “they served” portion is not underlined, it cannot be changed. The begin-
ning of the sentence must become a subordinate clause (one that cannot stand alone).
Subordinate clauses often begin with -ing verbs: “Fighting in all wars . . . they have
served. . . . ” Besides that, F, G, and H are run-ons.
Beware of taking my tips as gospel and using them automatically. The tips and tricks you
are learning in this book are not chiseled in stone. They are tips, not rules. Personally, I
think of -ing words as guilty until proven innocent. They’re probably wrong, but at least
give them a chance and check them out.
25. C. Demonstrated patriotism caused Congress to pass the Indian Citizenship Act.
“Demonstrating patriotism” has an -ing verb and should be looked at with suspicion.
Choice D leaves out the verb entirely.
This situation presents a persnickety grammatical point, one that is difficult even for
native English speakers. If all of the answers sound correct to you, just make a quick
guess and go on. (Remember that the ACT does not subtract penalty points for wrong
answers. Guessing is always to your advantage.)
26. G. The original, using both “one” and “you,” is all mixed up. Use either one selection or
the other, but do not use both. Choice J is tempting because it has the word “one,” but
this choice is actually using the plural pronoun “their,” which is incorrect. One does
not read in their books. Eliminate H for the same reason.
27. B. Choice C is tempting, but it changes the meaning of the sentence. The Navajos did
not use the Marine language; they used the Navajo language. Getting so involved in the
grammar that you forget the reading comprehension concepts is very easy. Be sure,
when you correct a grammatical mistake, that you have not introduced a new mistake
in the meaning of the sentence. Choice A is totally awkward (if it’s hard to read aloud,
it’s probably the wrong answer). Choice D doesn’t fit when reinserted into the sentence.
28. H. You need to use a plural verb: “Forty-five to forty-seven percent of tribal leaders 
are. . . .” Although the word percent looks singular, you have to determine what the 
percent is. This example presents one of the rare instances in which a prepositional
phrase does affect subject-verb agreement. (Sometimes you have to look at the object
of the preposition. For example, 50 percent of the house is infested with termites, but
50 percent of the houses in the neighborhood are infested with termites.) Because “of
tribal leaders” is plural, use a plural verb, are, and a plural noun, veterans.
314
Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: Full-Length Practice ACTs 

And speaking of termites, a quick joke: What did the termite say when he walked into
the saloon?
“Is the bar tender here?”
29. B. This question is like the main idea question that you would find after a regular read-
ing comprehension passage. To answer this question, you probably have to reread the
entire passage, ignoring the grammar concepts and focusing on the meaning of the 
passage.
Before you make a wild guess, look at the answer choices; look especially at the verbs.
You can eliminate choice A based on the verb “to argue.” Very few passages are pas-
sionate enough to argue a point of view. In choice C, “to hypothesize” is wrong. Nothing
about this passage is theoretical; it simply gives the facts. In choice D, “to predict” is
wrong. The passage tells you what has been and what is, not what will be.
The main idea of a passage is often described by one of three words: discuss, describe,
or explain. The primary purpose of a passage is to discuss something, to describe some-
thing, or to explain something. If you’re making a wild guess, choose one of those verbs.
Passage 3
30. J. The subject of the sentence is “the theory.” “Theory” is singular, requiring a singular
verb, “holds.” This narrows the answers down to H and J. In H, “whichever” makes no
sense when reinserted into the sentence.
An underlined portion that features a verb often tests subject-verb agreement. Go back
and identify the specific subject, ignoring (in most cases) the prepositional phrase.
31. B. A simple comma indicating a pause is sufficient. A semicolon separates independent
sentences. In other words, the part before the semicolon and the part after the semi-
colon must each be a complete sentence. The part before the semicolon here would be
a fragment, an incomplete sentence. Choice D introduces an unnecessary -ing verb
(always be suspicious of -ing verbs) that would ruin the parallelism of the sentence 
(“is thrust . . . penetrating”).
32. F. The subject of the sentence is “pockets,” which is plural, requiring a plural verb,
result. If you thought the subject was “rock,” you fell for the trap answer, choice H.
Prepositional phrases, such as “of molten rock,” rarely affect subject-verb agreement.
Choice J unnecessarily changes the tense of the sentence. Be careful that your change
makes your new sentence fit within the paragraph. The rest of the paragraph here is in
the present tense.
33. D. The original is a fragment, an incomplete sentence. When you read it, you expect to
hear something more at the end. Alter the -ing verb (often an indication of an error) to
“built” to change the sentence to the simple past tense.
I hope that you didn’t fall for choice B. The English language has no such word as
“bilt.” “Bilt” is not the past tense of “build.” The past tense of “build” is “built.” (Come,
come now, don’t leave in a huff over that cheesy answer. As Groucho Marx would say,
“Wait a minute and a huff!”)
34. F. Like compares similar objects. That is, like usually connects two nouns. As com-
pares situations or actions. Eliminate choices G and H. Choice J changes the meaning
entirely. Likely means probably; like means similar to.
35. B. The correct expression is “to mix one thing with another” not “to mix one thing from
another.”
36. G. This question tests whether you know a cliché, a common saying such as “more
(something) than you can shake a stick at.” For example, Chapter 4 has more good
rules than you can shake a stick at. If you didn’t know this saying, you would have been
well advised to skip (or just guess at) this question.
315
Chapter 22: Practice Exam 2: Answers and Explanations

Occasionally this exam expects you to know a proverb, a quotation, or a saying that is
in common usage in English. If the saying is completely foreign to you (pun fully
intended, I’m sorry to say), make a quick guess and go on.
37. C. The subject is park, which is singular and requires the singular verb boasts. This fact
eliminates choices A and D. Did you fall for the trap I set? “Boast some,” when read
aloud, sounds like “boasts some,” because of the s in some. Whenever a verb is under-
lined, check that the subject agrees with the verb. Choice B is wrong because it sounds
as if the park is doing some boasting. The expression boasts some of the simply means
is proud to have. You and your friends can boast some of the highest ACT scores
around if you learn the tricks and the traps of the exam.
38. F. The correct construction is semicolon, coordinating conjunction, and comma, as
used in the original. Choice G is backward. The semicolon should come before the
comma. Choice H would make the sentence into a run-on with a comma splice (a
comma is not strong enough to join independent sentences). Choice J has the colon
used incorrectly. A colon usually indicates a sequence or series of items to follow. For
example: Please learn the following rules: 1 . . . ; 2 . . . ; and so on.
(I can never see a punctuation problem without remembering a really smart student
who informed me, “Punctuation exacerbates my clinomania.” As soon as he left, I
looked up the word: Clinomania is an overwhelming desire to stay in bed!)
39. D. This passage is very straightforward. It discusses a certain geographical area, how
that area was built, and what species of plants and animals and people live in that area.
The passage is objective and neutral (as most passages are on this test), and the pas-
sage does not need humor. A cliché or slang expression, such as “more . . . than you
can shake a stick at,” is inappropriate (although you personally may be relieved to find
even a glimmer of comic relief at this point).
If you had trouble choosing an answer, use the process of elimination. Choice A is
wrong because nothing in this sentence changes the meaning of the passage. The pas-
sage discusses species; this sentence talks about more species. Choice B is wrong;
nothing new was introduced. Choice C can sound confusing. To forestall an opposing
argument means to anticipate an objection and address it directly. No objections were
discussed or anticipated here.
This question is a good one to guess on. Fill in something, anything, because the ACT
does not penalize you for wrong answers (random guesses). You just can’t afford 
the time to go back through the whole passage and try to figure out this sentence’s 
role in it.
40. J. Don’t invest a lot of time and effort in this type of question; make a wild guess and 
go on. If English is not your native tongue, reading the passages is hard enough to do
when the sentences are in the correct order and nearly impossible to do when the sen-
tences are all jumbled up.
If you decide to do this sort of question, the best place to begin is with the topic or
main idea sentence. The subject of the paragraph is “the theory of plate tectonics,”
meaning that sentence 2 should come first. This positioning of sentence 2 eliminates
choices F and J. Now, if you’re really shrewd, you will simply look at choices G and H 
to determine which second sentence would come next. In choice H, the second sen-
tence is number 5, which begins with “These become. . . .” Because nothing appears 
in sentence 2 for “these” to refer to, sentence 5 must not be second. Look at choice G.
Sentence 3 says “pockets of molten rock result.” Result from what? Sentence 2: “It pene-
trates deep enough into the earth to be partly remelted.”
This type of question is a major time-waster and is one of the most frequently missed
questions. Unless you are very confident of your answer, you’re better off not destroy-
ing any brain cells unnecessarily, but just guessing.
316
Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: Full-Length Practice ACTs 

41. A. “Because of” is correct. Choices B, C, and D turn the sentence into a fragment. If you
selected any of these three choices, you didn’t take the final, critical step: Reread the
entire sentence with the new answer inserted. If you’re going to answer a question,
take enough time to do it right.
42. F. The sentence means to say that the Indians didn’t leave many artifacts behind.
Choice G changes the meaning (and the tense). Choices H and J turn the sentence into
a fragment.
43. C. This last paragraph starts an entirely new train of thought. Previously, the passage
gave a physical description of the land and discussed its plant life. This paragraph is
the first time that you learn that humans inhabited the area.
Passage 4
44. G. Read a little bit ahead in the paragraph to learn that the writer is no longer a young
boy. Therefore, the simple past tense “dreamed” is required. Choice J turns the sen-
tence into a fragment.
Remember, -ing words often make complete sentences into incomplete sentences or
fragments. If you decide to choose an -ing verb, be sure to reinsert it into the sentence
and reread the entire sentence.
45. A. You can immediately eliminate choice C because the English language has no such
word as its’. It’s means it is, and its is the possessive of it, but no its’ exists. Choice D
looks tempting because “of whom” is a proper formation (of is a preposition; whom is
the object of the preposition). However, choice D, when reinserted into the sentence,
destroys the structure of the sentence, as does choice B.
46. F. This question tests the use of prepositions. You can be fascinated by, enslaved by,
captivated by, or enriched by something, but you are not enslaved with, or captivated
to, or enriched of something. Choice J does not work when reinserted into the sentence
(as an -ing word, it was dubious from the start).
And speaking of enriching, did you ever hear John D. Rockefeller’s three rules for
becoming rich? (1) Go to work early. (2) Stay late. (3) Find oil.
47. B. This question is an interesting one because all of the answer choices are pretty bad.
Your job is to choose the least awful among them. (Hmm: Sounds rather like a mixer
dance, doesn’t it?) The original creates a fragment: “A few miles past Naples, Italy along
the slopes of Vesuvius.” This fragment doesn’t finish the thought. The same is true 
for the next part: “This city is found, which is much the same it was in A.D. 79. . . .”
Choice B, even though it is in the passive voice (is found) rather than the active voice
(we find), makes a complete sentence. (Active voice is usually preferable to passive
voice because active voice is usually more concise, less wordy.) Choice C has an
unnecessary colon. The colon usually introduces items in a series, as in “I want you 
to learn the following: . . . .” Choice D lacks a subject for the sentence (who finds the
city?) and is a fragment.
48. F. For the ACT, you need to be very comfortable with all of the forms of the verbs lie
and lay. Lie requires no object. You do not lie something. For example, you can say,
“Studying for the ACT makes me so sleepy that I want to lie down.” Lay requires an
object. You’d say, “Now I lay me down to sleep.” In this question, no object is supplied
for the verb, meaning that the correct form is a conjugation of lie. This lack of an object
eliminates choices G, H, and J.
Can you list the conjugations of lie and lay? (See Chapter 4.) They are as follows:
lie, lay, have lain
lay, laid, have laid
317
Chapter 22: Practice Exam 2: Answers and Explanations

49. D. If you got this question correct, congratulate yourself. Most people immediately mis-
read “causally” as “casually.”
Anytime you think that the sentence has no error, read every word carefully to ensure
that you haven’t automatically, subconsciously corrected the errors. If you selected NO
CHANGE for 30 out of 75 questions, this automatic correction is probably a habit of
yours.
50. F. “Anybody” is singular and requires a singular verb, “invites.” Eliminate choices G and
H immediately. Choice J is tempting, but omitting this portion destroys the meaning
the author is trying to get across and deletes necessary punctuation.
Many students fall for the trap of choosing “OMIT the underlined portion” every time
they see it. Sometimes an omission creates havoc with the sentence. If you decide to
omit the underlined portion, be sure to reread the entire sentence with the portion
omitted.
51. C. “Neither” is teamed with “nor” (and “either” is teamed with “or”). Whenever you see
the word “neither,” be sure that “nor” follows hard upon its heels.
When you find a simple grammar or diction error, change only that part and leave the
rest of the sentence alone. In general, it’s good to change as little of the sentence as
possible.
52. F. Because the nonunderlined portion uses the past tense sat (“as he sat in his hotel
room”), the underlined portion also requires the past tense “looked.”
Trivia: You’ve probably heard about the ruins of Pompeii, but did you know that the
courthouse was found full of arms and legs? Yeah, now that’s clear evidence that the
people had paid their lawyers’ bills!
53. B. The original sounds as though Halliburton earns money simply by breathing and
writing at the same time! (Only John Grisham, Tom Clancy, and Stephen King can do
that!) The sentence means to say that the writing comes alive. However, it does not lit-
erally start to breathe; it simply becomes vivid, or lively.
54. J. The correct expression is “to relate to,” not “to relate with,” eliminating choice G
immediately. Choice H becomes a run-on sentence. The comma is not sufficiently
strong punctuation to separate independent clauses. The original is definitely a frag-
ment. This portion has no conclusion, no verb, no complete thought.
Fun fact: Do you know the singular form of the word graffiti? It’s graffito. I read all the
graffiti on the walls regularly. My all-time sicko favorite graffito is “Join DAM: Mothers
Against Dyslexia.”)
55. B. “Perfect” is an absolute adjective. Something either is perfect or is not perfect.
Perfect cannot be modified; for example, nothing can be very perfect or completely per-
fect, eliminating choices A and C. Choice D disrupts the flow of the sentence.
Although the shortest answer is often the best answer (because lengthy, verbose
answers tend to be redundant or to add superfluous terms), if you decide to choose
the shortest answer, check to be sure that it doesn’t make the sentence awkward or dif-
ficult to read. This “flow” is one reason that I suggest rereading the sentences aloud. Of
course, during the test you will not be able to shout out your answers, but you can
always mutter under your breath.
56. J. The portion “Sure to inspire every young boy’s imagination to feats of daring and
bravery” is a sentence fragment, an incomplete sentence. Adding it to the previous
noun (“gladiators”), which the clause modifies, eradicates this problem. Choice G
makes a run-on sentence. A comma splice is not sufficiently strong to separate inde-
pendent sentences. Choice H does not fit when reinserted into the sentence.
318
Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: Full-Length Practice ACTs 

57. C. The easiest way to answer an “order-of-sentences” question is to identify the topic
sentence or the main idea. The main idea of this passage is Richard Halliburton, his
writing, and his travels. It makes sense to begin the passage with Halliburton. Doing so
immediately narrows the answers down to choices B and C. Next, look only at choices
B and C to determine whether the second sentence should be sentence 3 (choice B) or
sentence 2 (choice C). Because the first sentence has graffiti at its end, logic dictates
that the next sentence should have graffiti at its beginning, which is the case with 
sentence 2.
58. H. The best way to answer this question is through the process of elimination. The 
article is too personal to be in an encyclopedia. It doesn’t express an idea or argue an
opinion the way an editorial would. Although choice J is tempting, the article discusses
very little actual geography. The writing is more reminiscent, as if a man were writing
of what influence Halliburton had on him.
Personal aside: I’ve always wanted to write a travel memoir. I even have a title ready
for the chapter about my trip through Egypt: Ankhs for the Memories!
59. B. Immediately eliminate choices C and D as negative. This passage is lightweight and
charming, not somber and macabre. The purpose of questions is rarely to ridicule or to
emphasize a negative point. Choice A is inane: Who cares about dental hygiene when
you’re dealing with a volcano?
Riddle: How do you know that a dentist is sad?
Answer: He’s always looking down in the mouth!
Passage 5
60. J. The sentence as it is doesn’t express a complete thought; it’s a fragment. Leaving out
the word “that” makes the sentence complete.
61. D. A routine is something that’s set, that doesn’t vary. Therefore, the original version is
redundant and unnecessarily wordy. The author can make his point just as clearly with
the one word, “routines.”
62. G. Because dancers is plural, you need the plural verb, “appear.”
The word “some” is one of the “SAMAN” words (discussed in Chapter 4): words that
are sometimes singular and sometimes plural. You need to look at what follows the
some, which in this case is the plural form, “dancers.”
63. D. The two sentences prior to this expression talk about the warlike, aggressive, charg-
ing actions of the birds. The author probably chooses the expression “pop out” to
emphasize that sort of aggression.
64. H. If you missed this easy question, you probably were just careless.
A common mistake in the English test is anticipating; that is, reading what you expect
to see (the proper form of the word), rather than what’s actually printed (a wrong
word). My suggestion is that you make a habit of checking every NO CHANGE answer,
just in case you automatically corrected what you were reading.
65. D. The original has the dreaded -ing, a form that should make you neurotic and suspi-
cious every time you encounter it. While, of course, an -ing form is sometimes right, 
it’s often used incorrectly, as it is here. Choice B is wordy; choice C is the wrong verb
tense.
66. F. The original version, with the comment set apart in commas, is correct. Choice G
would be inconsistent, with the first part of the comment set apart with a comma and
the second part with a dash. Choices H and J have the commas in the wrong positions.
To determine where to put a comma, read the sentence aloud and see where the natu-
ral pause is. A comma’s function is to serve as that slight pause.
319
Chapter 22: Practice Exam 2: Answers and Explanations

67. C. Items in a series must be parallel in form. For example, you wouldn’t say “The ACT 
is thrilling, exciting, and a challenge.” Instead, you’d say, “The ACT is thrilling, exciting,
and challenging.” Here, only choice C keeps the sequence of items in the same form.
(Parallelism is covered in more depth in Chapter 4.)
68. G. It is safe to assume there are more than two types of birds and more than two types
of bowers. Therefore, the superlative form most (used on three or more) rather than
the comparative form more (used for two items) is necessary.
69. B. The iris is the colored portion of the eye. It’s redundant to say “irises in the eye
region,” because you don’t have irises in your ears or your tummy!
70. H. Use parallel structure on the verbs. The peacock has eyes on its feathers; the pheas-
ant has eyes as well. Parallel structure or parallelism is discussed more fully in Chapter 4.
Choice J is the trap. Inserted, it would make the sentence read, “ . . . a pheasant also has
them too.” You don’t need both also and too.
Be sure to reread the sentence with your answer choice inserted. Doing so may take a
few seconds, but helps you prevent mistakes like this one.
71. B. The original version is wordy and awkward. Choose the most direct, straightforward
answer to make the same point. Choices C and D are just as verbose as the original ver-
sion. (Also, in choice C, just who are “they,” these people naming the bird?)
Although the shortest answer is not always the best answer, it’s always an answer
worth checking out. I suggest plugging in the shortest answer first to see whether it
works.
72. F. To emulate is to imitate. Humans, dressing to resemble birds and copying their dances,
are emulating the birds. Choice G is wrong because initiate means to begin, as in you
initiate your ACT studies as soon as possible. Choice H is the wrong verb number (sin-
gular when the plural noun dances requires a plural verb). Choice J is the passive voice
(active and passive voices are discussed in Chapter 4) and is unnecessarily wordy.
73. D. The original version is a fragment, an incomplete sentence. It’s missing a verb,
which “take,” in choice D, supplies.
Bonus trivia: Speaking of New Guinea, birds aren’t the only interesting creatures there.
Did you know that Papua, New Guinea, has several types of kangaroos that live in the
top layers of trees? Just imagine walking along throughout the trees and looking up 
to see a kangaroo! (You’d probably think you were hallucinating from studying too
much ACT!)
74. G. The passage most likely would continue with the last thought, which was about the
dances the human males perform that are like those of the birds.
75. C. This type of question is very subjective, meaning it’s as much opinion as fact. You
may not want to spend a lot of time on this question, just guess and go. (Remember
that the ACT has no penalty for wrong answers, so you never leave a question blank.)
The passage talked about what male birds do to attract female birds, thus fulfilling the
author’s intention.
Mathematics Test
1. D. The official, algebraic way to do this is to let the amount each cheerleader gave be 
c and the amount each football player gave be f. Then c = 2f. Because there are five
cheerleaders, their total amount was 5c or 10f. The ten football players also gave 10f.
The final equation is 10f + 10f = 480. 20f = 480. f = 24.
320
Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: Full-Length Practice ACTs 

After you have finished the problem, double-check it by plugging in your answer and
talking through the problem. This takes only a few seconds and can save you from
yourself. If each football player gave 24, then the ten of them gave 240. Each cheer-
leader gave twice as much as each football player, or 48. First, 5 × 48 = 240. Then 
240 + 240 = 480.
The ACT was nice enough to give you answer choices; why not take advantage of them?
You can do this whole problem without algebra by simply plugging in the answer
choices. Start with the middle value. If the middle value doesn’t work, you’ll know
whether the number must be greater or lesser than that choice. First, 22 × 10 = 220 
and 44 × 5 = 220 and 220 + 220 = 440. Because 440 is not enough, go to the next higher
number, choice D. Begin with 10 × 24 = 240. Then 5 × 48 = 240. Finally, 240 + 240 = 480.
2. H. Find the relationship between the first three terms: 2 plus 3 is 5. Then 5 plus 3 is 8.
Keep going: 8 plus 3 is 11.
If you thought this was too easy, keep in mind it was only question 2. Questions go
from easier to harder, such that this was to be as simple as possible.
3. D. First, plug in –3 for x. Then 2x = 2 (–3) = –6 and –3x = –3 (–3) = 9.
The minus sign outside the parentheses changes the +9 to –9. (Remember that you
have to distribute the minus sign through the parentheses.) You now have –6 + –9 =
–15. The answers are narrowed down to D or E. Next, solve for y: –3y plus + 4y = y.
Make a habit of eliminating answers as you go. This method can prevent your working
through an entire problem and then choosing the wrong answer because you forgot the
first part of the problem by the time you did the second part.
4. F. If two sides of a triangle are equal, their angles also are equal. Because all three
angles of a triangle total 180°, the two unmarked angles must be 60° total (180 – 120 =
60) or 30° each (60⁄2 = 30). Angles along a straight line are supplementary, or total 180°.
Therefore, 180 – 30 = 150. The exterior angle measures 150°.
The measure of an exterior angle is equal to the sum of the measures of its two remote
interior angles. Here, the remote (in other words, “not next to”) interior angles are
NLM, which is 30, and LNM, which is 120, for a total of 150.
Did you notice that F is the only possible answer? It is the only choice greater than 120.
Because exterior angle = the sum of two remote interior angles, it must be 120 + x; x is
not equal to 0. Therefore the exterior angle is greater than 120.
5. B. First, use your common sense to eliminate choices C, D, and E. If she can already
assemble 300 widgets in one hour and is going to raise her rate and work eight hours,
she certainly is going to assemble a lot more widgets than these answers show. Quickly
narrow the answers down to choices A and B.
Next, find that 25% or 1⁄4 of 300 is 75 — trap choice E, which you have already elimi-
nated. (One good reason to eliminate choices as you go is to avoid falling for traps like
this one.) If she increases her rate by 75, Jarnelle can now assemble 375 widgets in one
hour (trap choice C). In eight hours, she can assemble 375 × 8 or 3,000 widgets.
Another way to estimate is to say that 375 is about 400 and 400 × 8 = 3,200. Only choice
B is remotely close.
6. H. To solve a proportion, cross multiply: 3 × 25 = 75. 5 × a = 5a. Make the products
equal: 75 = 5a. Divide both sides through by 5; a = 15.
7. D. The sides of an isosceles right triangle are in the ratio side: side: side 2. The “side 2”
is the hypotenuse. (If you forgot this formula, go to Chapter 10.) Each side or leg of the
triangle, therefore, is 5. The area of a triangle is 1⁄2bh, one half base × height. In an isosce-
les right triangle, the two legs are the base and the height, making the area of this trian-
gle 1⁄2 (5) (5) = 1⁄2 (25) = 12.5.
321
Chapter 22: Practice Exam 2: Answers and Explanations

Choice B traps students who forget to multiply by 1⁄2. Choice E is the perimeter, not the
area. Because answer choices often have such “variations” to trap a careless test-taker,
circle what the question is asking for. Before you fill in the oval on the answer grid,
refer to that circled info again to be sure that you’re answering the right question.
Did the term “square units in the area” confuse you? Not to worry. Just think of it as the
area.
8. K. Distribute the negative: When I was in school, I always inserted a 1 in front of paren-
theses. You can use that principle here and distribute the negative 1. A negative 1 times
a is –a. A negative 1 times –3 is + 3 (which immediately eliminates choices G and H). A
negative 1 times –a is + a. Combine like terms: 6a – a + a = 6a.
When the answers are all “variations on a theme” like this, double-check that you are
keeping your positive and negative signs correct.

9. C. First, find 25% or 4
1 of 18,000: 
,
4
18 000 = 4,500 (trap choice E). Because that’s the dis-
count, subtract it from $18,000 to get $13,500 (trap choice D). Then take 5% of $13,500,
which is $675. That’s the luxury tax, so add it to $13,500 to get $14,175.
If you chose A, you added the sales tax to the original cost, not to the sales cost. If you
chose B, you assumed that a discount of 25 percent and a tax of 5 percent is the same
as a discount of 20 percent. The logic is superficially plausible but wrong because the
percentages are percentages of different wholes (in the first case, the percent is of the
original price; in the second case, the percent is of the sale price). Keep in mind, when-
ever you deal with percentages, that a percentage is part of a whole, and double-check
that you have started with the correct “whole.”
10. G. This is a relatively simple problem — easier than it looks. Draw a rectangle of width
x and length 3x (because the problem tells you that length is 3 × width). Add all the
sides to find the perimeter: x + 3x + x + 3x = 8x. The perimeter is 640, so 8x = 640. x = 80.
If x, the width, is 80, then 3x, the length, is 240. The area of a rectangle is length × width:
80 × 240 = 19,200.
11. D. First, circle the words “closest approximation.” That’s a clue that the problem is going
to be a pain in the posterior — that you will probably have some very weird numbers.
More important, it’s a clue that you don’t have to work the problem through to the
bitter end but that you can estimate a final answer.
Next, plug and chug. Put the numbers in and work the problem through.

This type of problem is great to do whenever the word problems are hard for you. This
question consists of numbers, numbers, and more numbers. However, this problem
also lurks to catch those who are prone to making careless errors. The more calcula-
tions you do, the greater the chance of a careless error. Double-check work like this.
12. K. Angles along a straight line total 180°. Forget about all the fraction jazz; start off 
by plugging in nice, simple numbers. Say, for example, that x = 1 part. Then y = 2 parts
and z = 3 parts. See how neatly things work out? You’re often rewarded for plugging in

simple numbers. Then you have x + y + z = 180, or 1 + 2 + 3 = 180; 6 parts = 180; 1 part =
30. Then x = 30, y = 60, and z = 90. Yes, it works. Now just go back and answer the 
question: z – x = 90 – 30 = 60.
13. A. This problem looks a lot harder than it is; don’t let yourself be intimidated. First, be
sure that you get the wording straight. You’re subtracting the first term from the second
term. Think of this as “second term minus first term.” If you overlook this wording, you
may have fallen for trap choices D or E.
Second, check that the variables are the same and are to the same power, or else you
can’t subtract them. For example, you can subtract 5a3 – 3a3, but you cannot subtract
5a3 – 3a2 (unless, of course, you know the value of a). Because the variables and expo-
nents (powers) are the same, you can ignore them and just subtract the numerical coef-
ficients (the numbers in front of the variables). 1 – 5 = –4. (Because no number is in
front of the a3b4, you assume a 1.) Now your answers are narrowed down to choices A
and B. Subtract the coefficients in front of the a2b3: –2 – 3 = –5.
14. J. The sides of a 30:60:90 triangle are in the ratio side:2side:side 3. (If you forgot this
ratio, flip to Chapter 10.) Draw the figure like this:
You know the “side 3” is the base, opposite the 60° angle, and the “side” is the height,
opposite the 30° angle. The area of a triangle is 1⁄2 base × height.

15. E. This question is as much vocabulary as it is math. A mean is the average of numbers:
Add the numbers together (420) and divide by the number of numbers (420 divided by
5 = 84). A median is the middle number when the numbers are put in order.
If you chose D, you fell for the trap of thinking that 79 was the median because it was
the “middle number.” You have to put the numbers in order first: 75, 79, 82, 91, 93. Now
you can see that 82 is the median. Subtract mean minus median: 84 – 82 = 2.
Bonus: While we’re talking vocabulary, do you know what the mode is? A mode is the
most repeated term, the one that shows up the most. For example, if the numbers were
2, 3, 2, 4, 5, the mode would be 2.
16. J. In this case, the diagonal with a length 6 splits a rectangle into two 30:60:90 triangles. 
The ratio of sides of a 30:60:90 triangle is side:side 3:2side. If the “2 side” is 6, then the
“side” is 3, and the “side 3” is 3 3.
Add the sides to find the perimeter: 3 + 3 + 3 3 + 3 3.
17. E. This was a relatively simple question, but if you missed it, you probably got careless
with an earlier answer. In choice A, while it’s true that 24 is a common multiple of 4 
and 6 (both terms divide evenly into it), it’s not the least common multiple. The least
common multiple is 12, as stated in choice E.

Chapter 22: Practice Exam 2: Answers and Explanations

To find a least common multiple quickly, count by the largest number: 6, 12, 18, 24 . . . .
Here, both 6 and 4 go into 12.
In Choice B, 4 is not a common denominator for 6. Choice C isn’t even logical. All num-
bers can be factored down into prime numbers; that’s what prime numbers are, the
least positive integer factors. Choice D is wrong because least prime factor of 4 is 2. 
(If you thought it was 1, you need to flip to Chapter 12. By definition, 1 is not a prime
number.)
18. H. Remove the parentheses: 3x2y + xy2 – 2x2y + 2xy2.
The last term is added because of the negative sign in front of the second set of paren-
theses. Remember to distribute the negative sign throughout the parentheses.
–1(–2xy2) = + 2xy2. Confusing signs is one of the most common careless errors in alge-
bra problems.
Combine like terms: 3x2y – 2x2y + 2xy2 = x2y + 3xy2.
19. E. The key to this problem is knowing the formula for the TSA (total surface area) of a
cylinder: 2πr2 + 2πrh. This formula is explained in detail in Chapter 9.
The 2πr2 represents the areas of the top and bottom circles: Here, 42π = 16π. Add top
and bottom: 16π + 16π = 32π. The 2πr represents the circumference of the cylinder,
which, if cut, would be the length of the base of a rectangle, like this:
The area of a rectangle is length × width. Here, that is 2πr times height, which is (2)4π ×
10 = 80π. Finally, add: 32π + 80π = 112π.
20. J. All parallel lines have the same slope. Isolate the y value using the slope intercept
formula: y = mx + b (where m is the slope of the line). Given that 2x + 3y = 6, subtract 2x
from both sides. 3y = 6 – 2x. Then to get rid of the 3, divide all variables by 3. You are
left with y= –2⁄3x + 2. The slope is –2⁄3 because it is resting where the R is in the formula.
21. D. First, distribute the negative sign from outside the parentheses, making the second
expression –3a2 + 2ab – 8. Then combine like terms: 2a2 – 3a2 = –a2. Immediately your
answers are narrowed down to choices D and E. If you’re in a big hurry, quickly make a
50/50 guess.
Next, ab + 2ab = 3ab. Because you’ve already narrowed the answers down to choices D
and E, only D works. (Finish up the problem: –8 –8 = –16.)

Solve this equation and get y =100. Therefore, 100 (Jessica’s needed score) – 100 (Josh’s

total must be 5 × 95 = 475.
If you chose F, you fell for the trap. The question asks you how many more points Josh
needs than Jessica, which is zero.
23. D. Remove the parentheses. Remember that the minus sign in front means that you
write the opposite of 4, which of course is –4, and the opposite of –3y, which is + 3y.

That means that 2y – (4 – 3y) + 3 becomes 2y – 4 + 3y + 3. Combine the 2y and the 3y to
get 5y. Then –4 + 3 = –1. All together now, you have 5y – 1.
This problem is a great one if your first language is not English. This question has no
confusing words and no tricky phrasing — it’s just straightforward numbers. But be
especially careful to keep the – and + signs straight.
24. H. A shaded area is what remains after you’ve subtracted the unshaded portion (the
circle) from the entire figure (the square). If the shaded portion is 144 – 36π, the area of
the square must be 144. A square’s area is side times side: root 144 = 12. The two sides
of a square make an isosceles right triangle with the diagonal of the square. The ratio 
of sides in an isosceles right triangle are side:side:side 2. If the side of the square is 12, 
the diagonal (which is the same as the hypotenuse of the triangle) is 12 2.
All these formulas, area of a square and ratio of sides in triangles are found in Chapter 10.
25. B. First, solve for angle y inside the triangle. Because the angles of a triangle total 180°,
y = 180 – (20 + 40) or 120. Next, the three x’s and this y angle total 180° because they
form a straight line. Therefore, 120 + 3x = 180 and 3x = 60 and x = 20.
Did you see the shortcut to completing this problem? An exterior angle of a triangle is
equal to the sum of the two remote interior angles. In other words, this outside angle is
the same as the sum of the two interior angles that are not adjacent to it. The exterior
angle is actually 3x, and 3x = 60. So x = 20.
26. H. Sometimes the hardest part of a math problem is knowing where to start. Use the
test answers to help you with this one and work backward. If the machine is losing half
the ball bearings every cycle, double the answer five times to track it down. 11(end of
fifth cycle) × 2 = 22 (end of fourth cycle), 22 × 2 = 44 (end of third cycle), 44 × 2 = 88
(end of second cycle), 88 × 2 = 176 (end of first cycle).
27. B. Note that the problem says each person wants to pay under $12, not exactly $12.
This problem is relatively easy, if you plug in the answer choices instead of trying to
make equations. Start in the middle with choice C. Currently, if the 5 friends pay $22.20
each, the total cost of the time is $111.00. If 4 more friends join them, for a total of 9
people, divide $111 by 9 which gives you $12.33 — just over $12. You know you must
have more people, but probably just one more because you’re so close. Plug in choice
B. If you add 5 people, you have 10 people sharing the $111 cost. Divide 111 by 10 to
get $11.10, which is under $12.
28. J. Cross-multiply to solve for a and b: a1 = 4 so 4a = 1 and a = 4
1 . Because b
1 = 5, 5b = 1 
and b = 5
1 . Therefore, 1/(ab) = 1/(1⁄4) × (1⁄5) = 1/(1⁄20) = 20.
If you chose F, you forgot to invert (turn upside down) and multiply. If you chose G or
H, you added the 4 and 5 instead of multiplying them.
29. D. The circumference of a circle is 2πr. If the circumference here is 10π, then r = 5. The
area of a triangle is 1⁄2 base times height. The base, AC, is two radii, or 10. The height,
OB, is one radius, or 5.
If you chose E, you forgot that the area is one-half base times height, or 1⁄2 (5) (10) = 25.
30. G. You know that 43 = 64, but if you chose J, you fell for a cheap trick. Choice J would

32. G. When you deal with percentages, start by plugging in 100. Say that the slow reader
originally read at 100 words per minute. Then when she increased her speed by 25 
percent, she read at 125 words per minute (because 25 is 25% of 100). If she is only 50
percent, or half as fast as the fast reader, the fast reader reads 250 words a minute. The
fast reader’s speed, 250, is what percent of the slow reader’s original speed, 100? Make 
the is/of fraction (250 is what percent of 100): 100
250 = 2.5 = 250%.
If you chose D, you got careless and found what percentage the fast reader’s speed is of
the slow reader’s increased speed rather than of her original speed. Circle precisely
what the question is asking you so that you don’t fall for traps like this one.
33. D. For every 2 yards (6 feet) that she swims, the swimmer actually progresses only 4
feet (because she loses 2 feet for every 2 yards). That means 1 yard swum = 2 feet cov-
ered. If 1 stroke is 5 yards, she goes 10 feet in that one stroke. The swimmer needs to 
cover 500 yards, or 1,500 feet, meaning that she has to take 150 (that is, 10
1500) strokes.
This is a great problem to skip if English is not your primary language. The wording is
quite confusing. In addition, the best way to solve this problem is not to use an equa-
tion but to talk it through. Word problems of this sort are very hard to get correct for
native English-speakers and nearly impossible for others.
34. K. One easy way to do this problem is to plug in numbers. Let x = 5 and y = 10. The
farmer can plow five rows in ten minutes or one row every two minutes. Therefore, the
farmer can plow 30 rows in one hour (because one hour = 60 minutes). Let w = 2, such
that the farmer works for two hours. If he can plow 30 rows in 1 hour, he can plow 60
rows in 2 hours. The answer to the problem is 60. Go through all the answer choices,
plugging in your values for x, y, and w, to find which one works out to 60 (choice K).

That means I cube the something, then add one.” In this case, the “something,” the x, is
given as –5. So cube –5 to get –125. Then add 1 to get –124. That’s all there is to it!
The answer choices are full of traps for the careless student. If you cubed –5 and got
positive 125, then added 1, you got answer A. If you correctly cubed –5 and got –125,
then added 1 and got –126 (!), choice E was waiting for you. And if you got choice B,
you combined both mistakes, cubing –5 to get the wrong answer of +125, then subtract-
ing rather than adding 1. Remember: Just because the answer you got is in front of you
does not mean it is the right answer. The test-makers are aware of commonly made
mistakes and put them on the test to tempt you.
36. K. An octagon has 8 sides. The formula for the total interior angle measure of a figure is
(n – 2) 180, where n stands for the number of sides. (This formula is explained in detail
in Chapter 10.) Here, 8 – 2 = 6 and 6 × 180 = 1080. Subtract 480 to get 600. There are 8
angles in an octagon. Two have been accounted for, leaving the remaining 6 to sum up
to 600 degrees. Divide 600 by 6 to get 100.
37. B. The four sides of a square are equal, such that one side of square RSTU is 12. If
points A,B,C,D are midpoints, then each one divides the larger square into lengths of 6
units. When you draw square ABCD you will notice that each side forms an isosceles 
right triangle. The ratio of the sides of an isosceles right triangle are side:side:side 2. 
That means the hypotenuse of (for example) triangle DRA is 6 2. Add the four sides to 
get 24 2.
If you chose A, you said that 2’s equaled 8, and added 24 + 8 = 32. You can’t add
square roots like that. (If you’re confused, go back to the roots section of the math
review.)
38. K. This problem is much easier than it looks. You don’t have to find the lengths of each
and every side. Just visualize that line FE is elevated to be at the same height as DC.
That makes the long line FC the same length as the long line, AB. Visualize that the
short side, ED, is shifted to the left and put on top of the short line AF. That makes the
long line AD the same length as BC. You have 16 × 2 and 9 × 2, for a total of 50.
39. B. You get the largest product by using the middle or median terms. Here, 13 + 13 = 26,
and 13 × 13 = 169, which is the trap answer.
If you chose A, you forgot the note that a is not equal to b. Therefore, you have to choose
the next two largest terms, 12 + 14. Multiply 12 × 14 = 168.
40. J. Does this problem make you think of Egyptian hieroglyphics? Join the crowd. Instead
of just saying, “That’s history, Babe!” and guessing at this problem, make it easy to work
through by plugging in numbers. Choose a number that has an easy square root. Make 
x = 9 (because 9 = 3). Now solve the question:
( 9 + 2) ÷ ( 9 – 2) = (3 + 2) ÷ (3 – 2) = 1
5 = 5
Keep in mind that 5 is the answer to the problem. It is not the value of x. Jot down the 5
to the side, draw a circle around it, put arrows pointing to it — do whatever it takes to
remind yourself that the answer you want is 5. Now go through each answer choice,
seeing which one comes out to be 5. Only choice J works:
( 9 + 4 9 + 4) ÷ (9 – 4) = (9 + 4 × 3 ÷ 4) = (9 + 12 + 4) ÷ 5 = 5
25 = 5
Be very, very careful not to put 3 in for x in the problem because x = 9 and 
x = 3. I
suggest that you make a chart to the side simply writing down x = 9 and Answer = 5.
When you plug in numbers, go through every single answer choice, soporific (sleep
inducing) though that may be. If you started with choice K, for example, and made a
careless mistake, you would find that choices J, H, and G didn’t work either . . . and
327
Chapter 22: Practice Exam 2: Answers and Explanations

probably choose F by process of elimination. If you take just a second to work out F,
you’ll see that it too is wrong, alerting you to the fact that you made a careless mistake
somewhere.
41. D. Begin the steps for this problem with 642/3 =

j . The cube root of 64 is 4, and 42= 16.
Exponents and bases are among the easiest things on the whole exam to answer cor-
rectly. If you are confused on how to work this problem, go to the exponents section in
Chapter 11.
This type of problem, because it involves only numbers and no words, is perfect for
students who get headaches just looking at some of those lengthy word problems.
42. H. A prime number has no positive integral factors other than one and itself. (Prime
numbers are discussed in more detail in Chapter 12.) The prime numbers in Set A are 2,
(did you forget 2? Two is the only even prime number), 3, 5, 7. Note that 9 is not prime,
because it can be factored into 3 × 3.
Not all prime numbers are odd (2 is a prime) and not all odd numbers are prime (9 is
not prime). The nonprime (also called composite) numbers from Set B are 6, 9, 12, 15.
The sum of all these numbers is 59.
43. B. To find probability, use a fraction:
The number of total possible outcomes
The number of possible desired outcomes
There were originally 19 cookies, but 5 were eaten, leaving 14 total. That’s the denomi-
nator. There were originally 9 chocolate chip cookies, but 2 were eaten, leaving 7. That’s
the numerator. The fraction 7⁄14 reduces to 1⁄2 or 50%.
If you chose E, you fell for the trap. The question asks for the percent probability.
Choice E would be saying there is one-half of one percent, not 50 percent.
44. H. I sincerely hope that you didn’t make an equation to solve this problem. There is a
much easier way: Draw a simple diagram. Put dashes so that the 13th dash has a bill-
board, like this:
Then counting backward with the billboard as the 14th, make a second diagram:
Put the two together and count:
If you were careless and thought that you could just add, you probably chose J, 27.
Invest a few moments to make a simple diagram and get the problem right.
45. B. Take this problem step by step. First, factor. You know, via FOIL (First, Outer, Inner,
Last), that the first two terms have to come out to x2, making them (x) and (x). You
know that when you multiply the last two terms, you must get –8, which means that
one term is positive and one is negative.

The middle two terms have to total + 7. How about + 8 and –1? That gives you (x + 8) 
(x – 1). Quickly remultiply this to be absolutely sure that it equals the original, x2 + 7x – 8.
It does. All is well. Now that you know that x2 + 7x –8 factors into (x + 8) (x – 1), add the
two expressions: (x + 8) + (x – 1) = x + 8 + x – 1 = 2x + 7.
46. H. The wording “in terms of” can be very confusing — ignore it. You are simply solving
for b. Do this problem the same way that you do any other algebra problem. First, get
all the b’s on one side and all the non-b’s on the other: Subtract 3a from each side. 
5b = 10 – 3a. Next, divide both sides by what is next to the b:

and y on the other side of the equation. You do this by first adding 4mx to each side:
–4mx – cb
3
= 4my. Next, -4mx + 4mx – cb
3
= 4mx + 4my. cb
3
= 4mx + 4my.
To solve for x and y, factor out the 4m on the right. – cb

= 4mx + 4my. Next, divide by 
4m:– mc

If your English isn’t up to solving word problems or story questions, this type of math
problem should make your day. It’s all numbers and variables without any confusing
phrasing or terminology. If you’re running short on time or patience, head for this type
of question first.
The most common mistake that I see students making on this type of problem is con-
fusing their – and + signs. As soon as you get an answer, turn around and double-check
it immediately. You can be pretty sure that the test-makers will include whatever you
get if you mess up the – and + signs as one of the answer choices.
48. H. First, multiply through the parentheses: a(a + 4) = 12, so a2 + 4a = 12. Next, make every-
thing equal to zero by moving the + 12 to the other side of the equal sign, remembering
to make it –12 (forgetting to change the sign is a common mistake): a2 + 4a – 12 = 0.
Next, factor the expression down into (a + 6) (a – 2) = 0. Finally, make the parenthetical
expressions equal to 0 and solve, a = –6 or a = 2.
49. A. First, multiply through the parenthetical expressions: (3 + x) (4x) = 3 × 4x = 12x and
x times 4x = 4x2. Add 2 to get 4x2 + 12x + 2. Next, multiply everything by the x outside
the brackets: x times 4x2 = 4x3. Then x times 12x = 12x2. Next, x times 2 = 2x. Finally, 
4x3 + 12x2 + 2x.
This problem is great to do if you are running short of time. It doesn’t take much effort
to understand what you are expected to do, nor much time to do it. The only mistake
you are likely to make is a careless one, so be sure to double-check your work.
50. J. Get rid of choices F and G right away. These choices show that the distance equals 0
at one time beyond the starting time. The car never moves back to the initial desig-
nated point. Choice H does not feature an interval in which the car slows to 70 m/hr.
Choice H shows that the car moved forward at a constant speed, stopped, and then
resumed the constant speed. Choice J is correct. Choice K is close, but the gas/lunch
interval (horizontal line) lasts too long.
51. D. To solve, factor x2 – 5x + 6 by thinking of FOIL (First, Outer, Inner, Last) in reverse: 
x2 – 5x + 6 = 0
(x _____) (x _____) = 0
329
Chapter 22: Practice Exam 2: Answers and Explanations

The missing numbers need to add to –5 and multiply to 6.
(x – 2) (x – 3) = 0
Check with FOIL: (x – 2) (x – 3)
= x2 – 3x – 2x + 6
= x2 – 5x + 6
To solve for x, make either expression inside the parentheses equal to 0.
x – 2 = 0 when x = 2
x – 3 = 0 when x = 3.
The solutions are x = 2 and x = 3. Check this:
(2 – 2) (2 – 3) = 0
(3 – 2) (3 – 3) = 0
These are okay. The sum of the solution is 2 + 3 = 5 (choice D).
52. F. If x + 1 is less than or equal to 8, then x is less than or equal to 7 (subtract 1 from
both sides).
If you chose choice G, you fell for the trap. You neglected to account for the “or equal
to” portion of the inequality.
53. C. First, put the equation in slope-intercept form: y = mx + b. Then x + 2y = 4 – x – y 
(distribute the – sign). Next, 3y = 4 – 2x (move the x’s and y’s to different sides of the 
equation). Then y =

If this problem is really, really tough for you, you’re not alone. Many students find this
jazz difficult. Keep in mind as you’re going through these questions that you don’t have
to get all the problems right to get a very good score; you can afford to skip or miss
several of them.
If you are an international student having a tough time with the word problems, brush
up on your trig to be sure that you get this type of problem correct. If you can do this
hard problem that’s all numbers and symbols, you don’t have to worry so much about
the easy and medium story problems that are so confusing to you because of the 
wording.
55. E. Multiply both the top and the bottom of the fraction by 2 – 3 (known as the conju-
gate of the denominator, just in case you care). Doing so makes the denominator equal to
1, so you can just ignore it from that point on.
This problem is great to do if you are short on time. It looks incredibly complicated, but
all you have to do is multiply both top and bottom by the conjugate of the denominator.
56. F. The most straightforward way to approach this problem is to remember that slope is 
change in rise over change in run, or x
x
y

. In this case, y2 – y1 = –b – (–b). That comes 
out to be –b + b = 0. Next, x2 – x1 = –a – 2a, which comes out to be –3a. Substitute and 
you get slope = 
a

= 0.
If you did this problem upside down, and got a
0
3 , you thought that it was undefined 
(because division by 0 is undefined) and chose choice K. You may have recognized that
y = –b in both points. This means that y is constant and the line is horizontal.
Horizontal lines have a slope of 0, reinforcing choice F as the answer.
57. D. Choice E is a sucker bet. Just because the problem multiplied both the number of
painters and the number of rooms by 3 does not mean that you multiply number of
hours by 3.
If three times as many painters are working, they can do the job in 1⁄3 the time just one
painter takes. If you are confused, reword the problem in your own terms. Suppose that
you take three hours to mow a lawn. If your two friends chip in and help you, the three
of you can work three times as fast and get the job done in just one hour. The same is
true here. Three times the number of painters (from 3 to 9) means that the job can be
done in 1⁄3 the time: 10⁄3 = 31⁄3.
If you chose 31⁄3, you didn’t finish the problem. Nine painters would do the same job —
that is, paint four rooms — in 31⁄3 hours. But the number of rooms is three times what it
was, so this factor triples the amount of time needed. Triple 31⁄3 to get ten hours. Yup,
you’re back to the original amount of time, which unfortunately was probably the first
answer your “common sense” told you to eliminate.
Think about this logically. The painters take 1⁄3 the time, but they do three times the
work. The 1⁄3 cancels out with the 3 to get you right back where you started from.
58. F. First, write out each expression: 10.8 (10–3) means to move the decimal point three
places to the left. (Remember: A negative power means the number gets smaller, shift-
ing the decimal point to the left, not to the right.) That gives you .0108. Do the same for
(0, –b)
y = –b
x
y
331
Chapter 22: Practice Exam 2: Answers and Explanations

the denominator: 400 (10–5) means to move the decimal point 5 places to the left, giving
you .004. Next, divide .0108 by .004 to get 2.7. Finally, figure out which of the expressions
is equal to 2.7. The expression .027 (102) means to move the decimal point two places
to the right (a positive exponent makes the number larger, meaning the decimal point
shifts to the right, not the left): 2.7.
This question is probably the easiest one to make a careless mistake on in this whole
exam. If you are going to do a problem of this sort, be sure that you can commit the
time to the problem. Do the problem carefully, double-checking your decimal point as
you go, and then triple-checking it after you have finished.
59. D. Okay, you can make this easy, or you can make it hard. You want to do it the easy
way, you say? Great: Plug in numbers. You can choose any numbers that your heart
desires, but I suggest that you keep them small. Why waste time on a lot of multiplica-
tion? Let q = 1. Georgia buys 1 quart of milk. Let d = 2; the milk costs 2 dollars a quart.
(It doesn’t have to make fiscal sense; maybe this is rare yak’s milk. You have better
things to worry about.) Let b = 3. She buys 3 boxes of cereal at 3 dollars a box (d + 1 = 
2 + 1 = 3). Now you can easily figure the total: 1 quart of milk at 2 dollars a quart equals
2 dollars. Three boxes of cereal at 3 dollars a box equals 9 dollars. Add them up to get
11 dollars. Plug the values for q, d, and b into the answer choices and see which one
equals 11.
Keep two important concepts in mind when you plug in numbers: First, keep the num-
bers small and easy to work with. Second, jot down the numbers as you create them.
That is, write to the side: q = 1, d = 2, and b = 3. It’s very easy to get the numbers con-
fused in the pressure of the exam and say that d = 3 or b = 1. Take just a nanosecond to
put down the assigned values and refer to them constantly.
Here’s the algebraic way to solve this problem: The amount spent for milk is (q quarts)
(d dollars/quart) = Cancel the “quarts” and get qd. Then the amount spent for cereal is
(b boxes) (d + 1 dollars/box) = cancel the “boxes” = b (d + 1) = bd + b. Add these together:
qd + bd + b. Take out the d: d (q + b) + b.
If you think the algebra is straightforward, you’re right . . . as long as you set up the
original equation correctly. Unfortunately, too many people have no idea how to set up
the equation and do it upside down, inside out, or whatever. If you plug in numbers,
you can talk your way through this relatively difficult problem in just a few seconds.
60. K. The interior angles of any triangle add up to 180°. You are given two of the three
angles of triangle GFX, 30 and 90. Solve 180 – (30 + 90) = 60. A 30:60:90 triangle has a 
special ratio for its sides: side:side 3:2side. The side GX here is the “2side” part (the
hypotenuse or side opposite the 90° angle). That means that the other sides are 2 
and 2 3. (If this ratio is confusing to you, return to the triangles section of the math
review.) If FXS is 2, then XB is 2, and FB sums up to 4. The height of the rectangle is 4. 
If side GF is 2 3, then FE is also 2 3, and the length of the rectangle is 2 (2 3) or 4 3. 
The area of a rectangle is base times height (also called length times width): 4 × 4 3 = 
16 3.
Reading Test
Passage 1
1. D. A main purpose or main idea is by definition broad and general. An answer with the
word “overview” is often correct, because it encompasses nearly everything. Choice A
is wrong because prehistoric animals were barely mentioned. In Choice B, “refute,” mean-
ing to disprove, is rarely a correct answer (passages discuss or describe, they don’t
refute or criticize; Chapter 5 covers this concept in more detail).
332
Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: Full-Length Practice ACTs 

It’s irrelevant that Choice B may be a true statement (the cycad seeds were too large to
be spread by birds). The mere fact that an answer is true doesn’t mean it’s the correct
answer to the question. Choice C is overly broad. There is little discussion of current
plant life, and the entire passage is limited to cycads, not to plants in general.
2. J. The line implies that the plants, although prehistoric, still exist today, telling you
where they may be found. Choice F is exactly backwards; the plants are not extinct.
Choice G is illogical in the context of the passage. Choice H is contradictory to the rest
of the sentence, which tells you how widespread the plants are.
3. A. This question is about pure detail. Lines 13 and 14 state that scientists considered
the widespread distribution of the cycad a mystery.
4. G. The sentence contrasts the wet tropical and semi-tropical habitats with the arid
regions, leading you to conclude that arid must be the opposite of wet: dry.
5. C. A passage often suggests; it rarely refutes (to refute is to disprove). Pangaea, men-
tioned in paragraph one, was the one large Supercontinent that later broke into smaller
continents, taking the cycad seeds and plants with them. This was mentioned as a pos-
sible way the seeds were distributed. Choice A is wrong; the cycad is not extinct today,
but extant (still in existence). Choice B is going too far. Although you were told the plants
in prehistoric times were huge, there was no mention or implication that the cycad was
the largest plant.
6. F. The cycads provided sustenance to huge animals, who logically needed huge amounts
of food. In addition, the rest of the paragraph discusses food, such that the first or topic
sentence would probably do the same.
7. B. Paragraph two tells you that the seed cones are female and the pollen cones are
male. The paragraph also warns of the cancer-causing properties of the seeds, but
never mentions any medicinal properties.
A question like this requires an investment of time. Unless you’re a reader who retains
everything after one quick reading, you’re probably wise to go back and double-check
your memory. Look for the precise answer; don’t depend on remembering everything.
8. H. Paragraph three states that the leaves of the cycad plant grow into a crown that
makes people think the plant is a palm tree.
9. B. A question that begins “according to the passage” is a gift to you. It is a pure detail
question that requires little thought. All you have to do is go back and find the answer
in the passage, usually stated very clearly and directly. Here, paragraph three says that
“the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia is one way the cyanobacteria
supply the cycad with inorganic nitrogen.”
10. F. In line 55, the author states that it is fascinating to note that “even though” the cyano-
bacteria are in the dark underground, they have the same membrane structure and pig-
ments of bacteria that thrive in the sunlight. From this you may deduce that the two
bacteria don’t usually have the same pigments.
Choice G goes too far in the reasoning. Just because the plants have been distributed
in the past doesn’t necessarily mean they will be “much” more widely distributed in
the future. Choice H is nearly backward. The passage states that cycad seeds cause
cancer, not that they may cure cancer. Choice J was neither mentioned nor implied in
the passage. Palm trees and cycads may superficially resemble each other because of
the crown of leaves, but there is no implication that the two species come from a
common ancestor.
Passage 2
11. B. By rereading the first sentence carefully, you note that Mr. Casaubon in fact was full 
of jealousy and vindictiveness himself, eliminating choices A and D. The phrase “which
compelled him to find other reasons for his conduct” tells you that he was trying to jus-
tify his jealousy and vindictiveness, sugarcoating them or calling them by other names.
333
Chapter 22: Practice Exam 2: Answers and Explanations

12. G. Lines 11–13 say that “occasions might arise in which such possession might expose
her to the more danger.” The next few sentences talk about how men might prey upon
her, allowing you to deduce that it is the money that turns Dorothea into the prey.
Choice F is such a ’90s answer, don’t you think (1990s, that is)? Nothing in the passage
talks about Mr. Casaubon’s having had a previous marriage or having had children.
Choice H is exactly wrong. Mr. Casaubon argues to himself that his responsibility, in
fact, is not to give Dorothea money, but to keep it from her, in order to keep her safe. If
you chose J, you really are a cynic, aren’t you? Although this brief excerpt makes you
wonder what Dorothea ever saw in the man that she married, you have no real reason
to assume that she was a gold digger, after only his money.
13. A. Lines 16–21 have an amusing sentence containing the following passage: “an animos-
ity which he has constantly vented in ridicule, of which I am as well-assured as if I had
heard it.” If you read that carefully, you see that Mr. Casaubon has, in fact, not heard
the man express any animosity at all. The sentence implies that this so-called animos-
ity is all in Mr. Casaubon’s head.
The other answers may or may not be true statements. For example, perhaps Mr.
Casaubon has given the other man ample reason for animosity. (Just from reading this
little bit, don’t you get the idea that Mr. Casaubon is that type of man?) Maybe the
other man, who wants to marry Dorothea, has dishonorable motives for doing so (he’s
after only her money). Maybe the other man vied with Mr. Casaubon for Dorothea’s
affections long ago. All those things may or may not be true; you just don’t know. Be
very careful not to read too much into the material.
14. G. By such sentences as “Such a marriage would be fatal to Dorothea” and “it is my
duty to hinder to the utmost the fulfillment of his designs,” Mr. Casaubon makes it clear
that he believes — or at least wants to believe — that the responsibility to foil the other
man’s intentions to protect Dorothea is his. (You already discovered in question number
2 how easily Mr. Casaubon could convince himself that he is doing everything from the
loftiest of motives, not out of petty jealousy and spite.)
Choice F may be a true statement. Maybe Mr. Casaubon believes the other man will
“corrupt” Dorothea, given Mr. Casaubon’s low opinion of the person. However, the pri-
mary theme of the indicated lines is not Mr. Casaubon’s fears (those were expressed
earlier) but his determination to hinder such an attachment. Be very careful not to
choose an answer simply because the statement is true. Check that the answer directly
answers the question.
15. C. All the other answers are too strong and include information that you have no way
of knowing. Maybe Mr. C did believe Dorothea was marrying him only for his money.
Maybe Dorothea was unaware of Mr. C’s fears. (It sounds as if she’d have been crazy to
marry the guy, had she known what he was really like!) Choice C seems logical; a man
who has made “arrangements” that leave “strong measures open to him” sounds quite
cautious.
In fiction passages, try to get a sense of the overall moral worth of the character and
then answer questions based on that impression. For example, you can tell from a
quick reading of the passage that Mr. C is a cantankerous old coot (at least in this
excerpt). Most of the answers involving him will show him in a bad light. Dorothea is
spoken of highly by the author. Therefore, anything said about her will probably be
positive. Using this very simplistic “good guy/bad guy” concept can help you to elimi-
nate at least a few of the answers, such as choices A and D (the passage sounds as if
Dorothea were a pushover, a passive person, not one likely to “demand” anything).
16. H. You must take the sentence in the context of the entire passage, not just read it
alone. The passage talks about Mr. C’s concern over what will happen to his money —
and incidentally, to his wife — when he dies. He therefore wants to have some idea of
how much longer his life will be.
334
Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: Full-Length Practice ACTs 

Choice F is the cheesy answer. Just because the quote has the word probabilities in it
does not mean the man is a gambler. Nothing in the passage even hints at such a possi-
bility. While choice J is possible (the man cared more for how people would mock him
than for his wife’s future happiness, it seems), the answer is too strong, using dramatic
words like “obsessed” and “no one else.” Moderate, more temperate answers are more
likely to be correct than emphatic answers.
17. B. This question was rather difficult. Lydgate was “conscious of an energetic frame in
its prime,” meaning that he knew what an energetic frame in its prime was. Lydgate is
obviously a physician — this is the source of his knowledge — and he contrasted his
vitality with the weakness of the man coming toward him.
Choice C is the trap answer. Yes, Lydgate felt pity, but pity for Mr. Casaubon, not for
himself. And if you chose D, you went for the big, hard word on the principle of “if I
don’t know it, it must be the right answer” (we all have those feelings of insecurity,
believe me). Usually, the most difficult word is merely a trap answer. Unless you can
absolutely, positively eliminate the rest of the answers, don’t choose a word you can’t
define.
18. G. The paragraph primarily describes how weak Mr. Casaubon is, contrasting that con-
dition with both Lydgate’s vitality and the beauty of the surroundings.
A why question like this one can be very difficult for international students. You are
asked to understand not just the passage itself, but the motivation of the writer. If the
correct answer doesn’t immediately jump out at you, don’t waste a lot of time on this
sort of question. Make a quick guess (wrong answers are not penalized on the ACT)
and go on to the next question.
Choice H is the trap answer. The paragraph talks about a dirge, which is a hymn sung at a
funeral. If you knew that, you may have thought the purpose of this description was to
predict a death. However, that may be going too far. If you have a choice between a mod-
erate answer, such as contrasting fit versus unfit, and a dramatic answer — predicting
death! — go for the more moderate of the two.
19. D. Eliminate choice C immediately. Very rarely is the correct answer negative in an ACT
question. In this case, Lydgate is filled with compassion at seeing Mr. Casaubon and
would be unlikely to be malicious. Choices A and B are possible, but D is more directly
related to what the author specifically says: “ . . . said Lydgate, filling up a pause.” One
fills up a pause by saying something when the silence becomes awkward.
20. F. The first half of the passage shows Mr. Casaubon in a very bad light, discussing how
petty and jealous and vindictive he is. The last half of the passage elicits a feeling of
compassion for a prematurely old man.
Choice G is exactly wrong. The reader becomes more tolerant of Mr. Casaubon when
learning of his problems. Choice H is unlikely. Although Lydgate is introduced at the
end of the passage, the focus is still definitely on Mr. Casaubon. Choice J goes too far.
The reader may feel sorry for Mr. Casaubon but is even less likely than before to under-
stand why Dorothea married him (the man is not only nasty but also unattractive and
prematurely old).
If two answers are direct opposites, the chances are good that one of them will turn out
to be the correct answer choice. Here, choices G and F are opposites, indicating that
one of them is likely to be the correct answer. You have a 50-50 guess, almost a present
from the test-makers.
Passage 3
21. D. The primary purpose of many passages is to describe, discuss, or explain some-
thing. Those three words are so often the correct answer to a “main idea” or “primary
purpose” question that you should immediately give them serious consideration.
(They’re not always right, of course — but almost always.)

Chapter 22: Practice Exam 2: Answers and Explanations

You should have dumped choice C right away. The ACT is not going to write a passage
whose primary purpose is to trash (denounce means to put down, to bad-mouth) some-
one, especially a professional such as a child psychologist. Main-idea, primary-purpose,
or best-title answers are almost always positive or neutral, not negative.
Choice B is tempting. The passage does mention self-esteem (and if you’re smart enough
to look at the attribution, you’ll see that the excerpt, in fact, comes from a book on self-
esteem), but it never mentions anything about low self-esteem.
Choice A is also tricky. It just sounds so pompous and correct: “provides the founda-
tion for life.” La-di-da. However, the passage discusses children up to the age of 16, well
beyond “early childhood.”
22. G. This question was an absolute gift to you. The answer is given specifically in the
second sentence of the passage.
If you chose J, you fell for the trap. Yes, children work to achieve competence at vari-
ous tasks throughout the stages of childhood, but all the tasks lead to the ultimate goal
of selfhood. Don’t choose an answer simply because it was mentioned in the passage.
Be sure that the answer that you choose refers to the specific question asked.
23. C. Paragraph three mentions this cry of a child to make the point that he needs feed-
back, recognition of his achievements.
Choice A is a true statement, and it was discussed in the passage. However, choice A is
not the answer to this specific question. Be careful that you don’t choose a statement
merely because it was true and was mentioned in the passage. Doing so is like saying,
“There are 360 degrees in a circle,” when the teacher asks you for the capital of Romania.
Sure, the statement is true, but what does it have to do with the matter at hand?
Choice B is tempting, but parent-pleasing behavior was discussed later (in paragraph
four) as typical of 5-year-olds.
24. J. This question traps rushed students who don’t go back and see how the statement is
used in the context of the passage. Lines 29–30 say that “the mother is the center of the
child’s world.” True, the other answers mention games, but the phrase “the name of the
game” was used metaphorically in this instance. To say that something is the name of the
game means that it’s the main idea, the point of the whole activity. For example, getting
into college is the name of the game when studying for the ACT. If you didn’t need a
good ACT score to get into school, would you really go through all this mind-numbing
studying? (You would? Just for our jokes? We’re flattered, but whoa — get a life!)
If it appears that a question depends on your understanding of a slang phrase or saying,
you may want to make a quick guess. Such phrases are especially difficult to nonnative
speakers because such phrases are not literally translated. Don’t waste a lot of time
trying to understand the phrase; guess and go. Remember that the ACT does not penal-
ize you for wrong answers, so guessing is always to your advantage.
25. D. The author states that this separateness is an important milestone in the children’s
development, indicating that this separateness is vital. (A milestone is an event marking
a significant stage in life. For example, getting a driver’s license is a milestone to
teenagers.)
Did you notice that all the wrong answers were negative, and only the correct answer
was positive? If you’re guessing (and the ACT has no penalty for wrong answers, so a
guess is always worthwhile), dump the negative answers and go for the positive. The
ACT rarely trashes anyone or anything and is all sweetness and light.
26. G. The theme of the passage is the confusion between wanting two opposite things,
such as demanding to have freedom from parents but being afraid to let go of them.
Every answer, obviously, comes right from the passage itself, so they all look familiar and
“sound right.” In a question like this one, I suggest that you ignore the answer choices
at first. Reread the passage and identify its main idea to yourself. Then go back and
find which answer best expresses that idea. If you look at the answer choices, every
one looks good. Try to predict the answer first.
336

27. D. This should have been a pretty easy question. You want to examine more than just
the indicated sentence; read the few sentences surrounding it. The next sentence tells
you that, “He needs to ask what he is going to do with his life.”
You didn’t fall for the cheap trick in choice A, did you? A vocation is not the same thing
as a vacation. And if you fell for choice B, you confused a vocation with a location.
(Occasionally, I’ll have a student come back after the test and exclaim, “There was a
typographical error in the ACT, but I corrected it.” Wrong. Although you may find a
typo or two in this book — because I’m not perfect like the ACT — the ACT itself has
none. If you think that you found a typo, you probably fell for the trap.)
28. F. Lines 90–94 mention that the convictions (which are developed at specific ages,
statement II) will be influenced by the level of self-esteem (statement III), especially if a
conflict exists among what a child believes, what he was raised with, and what his
friends find acceptable. Nothing was mentioned about educational level.
When doing Roman numeral questions, focus first on the statement that you are most
sure of. In this example, the author does, in fact, mention self-esteem. This fact means
that you can eliminate any answer with III in it, choices H and J. As quickly as that,
you’ve gotten the choices down to two. (You should always guess, because the ACT
has no penalty for wrong answers; but a 50-50 guess is a real luxury.)
29. C. The passage discusses the various stages of children by their ages. Chronological
means in order of time. If you didn’t get this question, you outsmarted yourself and
tried to make matters more difficult than they really were. Believe it or not, not every
single question on the ACT is out to get you.
30. H. You could answer this question based on either the last paragraph or the first para-
graph. The final paragraph discusses how the final stage of development is establishing
total development. If that’s the final stage, then the ultimate goal is that independence.
The first paragraph also discusses how the purpose of childhood development is to
achieve selfhood or self-knowledge.
Passage 4
31. B. The easy way to answer this question is to “plug ’n’ chug.” Plug each answer choice
into the sentence and chug, or read through it. It makes sense to say, “Nearly any small
child can recite quickly the twelve months of the year.”
Choices A and D are traps. Yes, when you rattle something, you can shake it, or you
can rattle someone and upset her, but those uses are not appropriate in this particular
sentence. Words have more than one meaning. Your job is to identify which meaning
works best in the context of the sentence.
32. F. The first paragraph specifically states that a piece of information is missing: how the
names of the months came into existence. The majority of the rest of the passage
explains the names.
If you chose G or H, you fell for the “But I know I read that!” trap. Just because some-
thing is mentioned in the passage does not mean that it is the main idea of the passage.
A main idea is a general, underlying theme that runs through most of the passage. A
good way to identify a main idea is to pretend that you are answering a buddy’s ques-
tion: “Hey, what did you just read?” In this case, you would respond with something
like, “Oh, I read a passage about how the months got their names.” Often, you can pre-
dict the correct answer to a main idea question before you ever read the answer choices.
33. C. Lines 18–20 state, “As the guardian of doors or gateways, he had to be vigilant for
friends and foes coming from either direction.” This should have been a very easy ques-
tion for you. It is called a detail or fact question and simply asks you to find one fact from
the passage. You don’t have to interpret anything or draw a conclusion. It’s important to
recognize this type of question. If you’re running short on time, or your brain cells are so
scrambled that you know that you’re missing most of the questions, this type of question
is worth investing time in, because you can almost always get it correct.
337
Chapter 22: Practice Exam 2: Answers and Explanations

34. F. When a question begins with the words, “According to the passage,” it is usually
quite simple. The answer is given, almost word for word, in lines 26–28, which state,
“This month’s name came from the February 15 feast of purification.” If you missed this
question . . . well, hang your head in shame.
35. A. Paragraph 4 implies that because people know Mars was the god of war, they assume
that the month of March got its name from warfare. Instead, the author states, the
origin of the name actually referred to the fact that war was postponed until the spring-
time, and that Mars was also the god of springtime.
Choice B is close but not quite right. The author discusses that most of the months are
named after gods and goddesses but never states or implies that most people believe
that all months are named for gods and goddesses. (Be careful not to read too much
into the answer.) Choice C is definitely wrong. Paragraph five talks about how not every
month’s name has a definite provenance, or known origin. And choice D is off the wall:
Nothing is mentioned in the entire passage about lunar cycles.
36. G. This question should have been relatively easy (unless you were too lazy to go back
and look at how the expression is used in the passage). Plug the answer choices into
the sentence and see which one works best. Here, it is logical to say, “In order to bring
the Roman calendar back in line with the solar year. . . .”
37. D. The second-to-last paragraph states that Romans considered even numbers unlucky
but never said why.
Often, when a question asks which of the following is not discussed, the answer has a
“why” in it. Passages often state facts but may not give the why and wherefore behind
those facts.
38. J. Because the question asks for a main idea, look for the most general answer. Choices
F and G are mentioned in the paragraph but are not its main point. A main idea usually
is given in the topic or opening sentence of the paragraph, which here states, “Not every
month has retained its original name over the years.”
39. A. The author states that most people believe every fourth year is a leap year, but
that’s not the case. The century years are not leap years unless they are evenly divisi-
ble by 4. For that reason, statements I and II are wrong. Statement III takes a little more
thought. If the millennium year were 1000 or 2000, both of which are divisible by 4, it
would be a leap year. But if the millennium year were 3000, which is not evenly divisi-
ble by 4, it would not be a leap year. Therefore, statement III is not correct. (Give your-
self a pat on the back if you got this question right.)
40. H. This question is very typical of “vocabulary in context.” Sure, you know what gloss
normally means, but the ACT rarely uses a word in its normal sense. In fact, the normal
sense of the word is usually the trap. (Choice F and choice J here are the trap answers.)
The key is to insert every answer choice into the sentence and see which one makes
the most sense. The author is discussing how people don’t realize something (that not
every fourth year is a leap year), which means that they ignore a fact.
Did you notice that choices F and J are basically the same? Because you can’t have two
right answers, both must be wrong.

Passage 1
Did you remember to slow down and think about the introductory material and examine the
tables before you headed to the questions? You’re normal if you want to get right down to
business, but spend at least a minute going over the material you are given. You don’t have
to understand that material perfectly, but do at least identify what the study is about and the
basic results.

Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: Full-Length Practice ACTs 

You’ve probably watched pole vaulting on television, right? When you’re reading through this
problem, try to visualize a pole-vaulter, running down the runway, planting the pole, zooming
skyward, clearing (or crashing into) the bar, and finally, falling into the pit. The main point to
get out of the intro to this problem is that the pole, as it unbends, forces the vaulter up.
Looking at the second paragraph and Table 1, you should note that a thick fiberglass pole 
is harder to bend than a thin fiberglass pole (logically enough), but the carbon fiber pole is
harder to bend than a fiberglass pole.
Tables 1 and 2 combine to show that the more force required to bend a pole, the faster the
pole bends back. Think of this relationship in another way: as a spring. You know that the
harder a spring is to stretch, the more forcefully the spring recoils when released.
Okay, you now have the picture in mind and have evaluated the tables. Time to go on to the
questions.
1. B. The answer to this question follows from the major relationship noted in the next-to-
last paragraph of the analysis of this passage. Remember that the harder a spring is to
stretch, the faster it will snap back to its regular position after it’s released. Look at the
two tables: Pole 3 requires the most force to bend but the least amount of time to snap
back. Pole 1 requires the least force to bend but the greatest amount of time to snap
back. Pole 2 is intermediate for both force and snap-back time. Choice B follows very
cleanly from the numerical relationship shown in the two tables. The more force/less
time relationship holds for all three poles, so you cannot justify choice D.
2. G. More force is required to bend a stiffer pole, as you are told in Table 1. In the intro-
ductory material before the tables, you find out that poles No. 1 and No. 3 have the same
mass (no, you don’t have to calculate mass; the mass is just given to you right out, as a
gift) and that pole No. 2 has the greatest mass. Therefore, pole No. 3, the carbon fiber
pole, which is one of the least massive poles, is the stiffest. Eliminate choice F. When
looking at fiberglass compared to carbon fiber, this relationship doesn’t hold. Eliminate
choice H because with poles No. 1 and No. 2 , the more massive pole is stiffer. To choose
between choices G and J, look at poles No. 1 and No. 2, the two fiberglass poles. Because
the table indicates that the most massive pole is the stiffest, G is the right answer.
3. A. This type of question is common in Research Summaries (the name of this style of
passage). This question requires you to understand some fundamentals of experimen-
tal design. A controlled variable (also known as an independent variable) is a factor
that the experimenter can directly control (duh!). Because you’re often asked about
controlled variables, you may want to identify them as you read through the experi-
mental data upfront. In other words, as you read the problem, say to yourself, “Okay,
what’s different here? The two factors that are being fiddled with are the size of the
pole and the material it’s made of. Those, therefore, are the controlled variables.”
In this study, pole dimensions and material (fiberglass or carbon fiber) are controlled
variables. The experimenter can easily change the diameter or length of a pole to a
specific value, or he can change the pole’s material. Choices B, C, and D mention fac-
tors that result from the experiment, not factors that can be changed going into the
experiment.
4. G. Don’t despair; this question is not as tough as the terminology initially suggests. In
fact, you can answer this question pretty much by using your common sense. What is
“potential”? Potential is something that can happen but hasn’t happened yet. (You have
the potential to enjoy these questions . . . but that hasn’t happened yet!)
The pole acts to transfer the energy produced while the vaulter runs into energy that
lifts the vaulter upward. When bent, the pole has stored the energy gained from the
running, but has not yet moved upward. At this point, the pole has the potential to
move with much energy, but is not moving at the moment. Therefore, the pole has
potential energy, but no kinetic energy.
339
Chapter 22: Practice Exam 2: Answers and Explanations

5. D. The question tells you that the vaulter needs a pole that isn’t too massive when it is
very long. Home in on choices B and D because they focus on mass. Because low mass
is the objective, D is correct.
6. G. This passage’s introduction tells you that beginning vaulters need poles that are rel-
atively easy to bend. Therefore, pole No. 1 is best for beginners, and choice J is out. The
ideal advanced pole is one that quickly returns to a vertical position. That is, the pole
quickly transfers the energy to a lifting force. Study 2 reveals that the best pole to
transfer energy quickly to a lifting force is pole No. 3.
Bonus! Did you see the second way to identify pole No. 3 as best for an experienced
vaulter? The pole has a low density, meaning that the pole can be longer. If you remem-
ber question 5, vaulters like longer poles because they enable a vaulter to get closer to
the crossbar.
Passage 2
Always begin by summarizing to yourself just what exactly the graph (or table, chart, or pic-
ture) indicates. This graph shows that the percentage of deaths grows with time. Well, duh!
This relationship, of course, is what happens. The total number of deaths can never decrease.
Fewer people may die in certain years, but when people die, the overall number of deaths
goes up until 100 percent of the people are deceased.
Be careful not to interpret the graph as showing that more people die at the age of 100.
Because the total number of deaths keeps growing, not only the number — but also the 
percentage — has to be higher at 100 years.
To get an idea of when most people die, look at where the graph makes the steepest climb.
This increase appears to be between about 55 and 85 years. The percentage of people who
have died grows from about 20 percent to about 80 percent over this time, so more than half
the population dies between the ages of 55 and 85. Not too many people die at 100 because
not that many people are left by that time. (They probably took too many ACTs, SATs, and
various other agents of neurocellular destruction.)
The graph shows that a typical human being lives to be about 75. (Don’t get too depressed.
The mere fact that you bought this test-prep book rather than a more serious tome shows
that you are definitely not typical.) Half the population dies in 75 years. The remaining half 
of the people die after more than 75 years pass.
7. B. Not to worry. This question is a basic test of graph reading skills, with a little twist
thrown in. First, find 80 years on the horizontal axis. Go straight up from this year
(your ACT answer grid can serve as a straight edge) until you hit the plotted curve.
Next, go straight to the left to find the percentage of people who have died. But watch
out: If you chose choice C, you fell right for the trap. The question is asking for the per-
centage alive after 80 years. You must subtract 60 percent from 100 percent to get 40
percent.
Get into the habit of circling precisely what the question is asking for. In this case, circle
the word “alive,” so that you keep in mind that the percentage alive is what the ques-
tion wants.
8. J. The percentage climbs from 0 percent to only 10 percent or so from 0 to 40 years, so
choices F and G are out. A good look at later intervals shows much bigger increases in
later intervals. The graph climbs from about 10 percent to 25 percent (an increase of 15
percent) between 40 and 60 years and from about 25 percent to 70 percent (an increase
of 45 percent) between 60 and 80 years. (Just looking at the slope of the graph quickly
provides the answer for this question.)
9. A. With no infant mortality, nobody dies just after 0 years. The graph will stay at 0 for 
a year or so and then start rising when children start dying from accidents, childhood
diseases, brain explosion (from taking the ACT), and so on.
340
Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: Full-Length Practice ACTs 

For choice B to be correct, more people would have to die in the first 20 years. With
fewer people dying soon after birth, more people will likely be alive at 20 years, so the
graph should be lower. Even if all the people who would have died as infants die before
20, the graph would be the same at 20. Additional people would have to die to make
the graph higher.
Choice C is out because with more people surviving infancy, more people will have to
die at later ages. The graph will be more, not less, steep in later years.
Choice D is unreasonable because those who survive past 1 year of age are almost cer-
tain to die before they reach 100. Most people survive infancy but still don’t make it to
100. (Yes, of course, some people do live past 100, but you are not expected to think 
of remote possibilities. Curb your argumentative tendencies and go for the logical,
common-sense scenario, unless a question specifically says otherwise.) Another reason
to eliminate choice D is that it mentions a figure, 120 years, that is far beyond the range
shown on the graph. For the graph to get to 120, a significant number need to live to
100. Only a small percentage of people die before 1. Why would keeping these people
alive swell the number surviving past 100?
10. H. You can answer this question by process of elimination. The graph tells you that
choices F and G are out. A clear majority of people live past 45, which means that the
largest number of people have yet to die.
Don’t fall for choice J. More people die within 95 years than within 75 years, but this
fact does not mean that more people die at age 95 than at 75. Only 10 percent of the
people live to 90, so many people aren’t left to die at 95 years. Only choice H is left.
11. C. At 15 years (choice A), less than 5 percent have died, so more than 95 percent are
still alive. Just because a statement is correct doesn’t make it the right answer choice.
Note that the question asks you for the maximum number of years. Keep going to find
out whether a larger number can be correct. At 35 years (choice B), more than 90 per-
cent are still alive. This larger number eliminates choice A. Keep going. At 55 years
(choice C), 20 percent have died, so 80 percent are still alive. This number is mentioned
in the question. At 80 years (choice D), 60 percent have died, so this choice is out.
Did you see the word maximum and immediately choose the largest number? Do you
really think the ACT is that easy? By all means, check the largest number, but don’t
automatically assume that that number is right.
Passage 3
No, nuclear physics is not a required course for the ACT. Although this topic may seem
incredibly advanced, the reading and interpretation are relatively straightforward. All you
have to do is to realize that the radioactive substances change in a way that can be meas-
ured and that the rate of change slows down with time. The tables show these relationships:
You can see that the disintegration rates consistently slow down as time goes on.
Be sure to notice that the time frames used for the two substances differ. Don’t assume that
Table A and Table B use the same frame of reference. Treat each table separately.
12. H. You can dump choice J immediately. If the substance is down to 125 after 16 hours,
how can there be 200 after 20 hours? Use your common sense to eliminate illogical
answers.
Choice G penalizes the careless reader who looks at substance A rather than substance B.
The most important thing to notice is that the disintegration rate is cut in half every
four hours. After 20 hours (which is only one 4-hour segment after 16 hours), you can
expect that the rate will be half of what it was at 16 hours. Half of 125 is 62.5.
13. B. The disintegration rate goes down because the number of radioactive atoms goes
down as the substance disintegrates. (Actually, that’s what “disintegration” is all
about.) When fewer atoms are available to disintegrate, the disintegration rate natu-
rally decreases.
341
Chapter 22: Practice Exam 2: Answers and Explanations

So what does all this information mean to you? The number of atoms decreases in the
same way that the disintegration rate decreases. At 15 hours, the disintegration rate is
only 25⁄200 or 1⁄8 of what the rate was when measuring began. The number of atoms must
be only 1⁄8 of the original 10,000,000. A little simple multiplication finishes the problem: 
1⁄8 × 10,000,000 = 1,250,000.
14. F. Because wimpy or wishy-washy answers usually are better than dramatic or precise
answers, eliminate choices G and J. Think about the choices as follows: If G is correct,
the test-maker also has to accept choice F, which really wouldn’t be wrong. However,
choice F can be correct without choice G being correct. The same thing is true for
choices H and J. If you’re going to make a guess, guess F or H, the safer answers.
Just because 1,500 is halfway between 2,000 and 1,000 does not mean that the time has
to be halfway between the times that are associated with 2,000 and 1,000. Take a look
at Table 2. You’ll notice that for every 4-hour interval, the decrease in millicuries is
less. For example, the millicuries decrease 1,000 during the first 4 hours but decrease
only 500 during the next 4 hours and decrease only 250 during the next 4 hours. You
can conclude that more of a decrease occurs during the first 2 hours than during the
second 2 hours. At 2 hours, the number of millicuries will be closer to 1,000 than to
2,000. You can conclude that 1,500 was reached a little before 2 hours, making choice F
the safe bet.
Although this question is tough, thinking logically about how the test is constructed
can help you narrow the field. Remember: The test-makers don’t want to have to defend
their answers. They’re usually going to leave themselves some leeway by choosing
less-precise answers.
15. C. The key is to look for which substance took less time for the disintegration rate
(which is directly related to the number of radioactive atoms) to fall to one half of the
original value. Substance A went from 200 to 100 in 5 hours, while substance B went
from 2,000 to 1,000 in only 4 hours. Therefore, substance B has a shorter half-life, which
narrows the field to choices C and D. Choice D is full of irrelevant garbage (just because
the scientists decided to go home after 16 hours does not affect the half-life), while
choice C actually reinforces the definition of half-life.
Choice A is misleading because the key is not the absolute amount of substance pres-
ent but the amount of substance present relative to the starting amount. Choice B is
simply wrong. The amount present after 25 hours is half the amount after 20 hours; the
amount does not all disappear.
16. G. Hey, don’t do too much work on this question. All you have to do is look at both
tables and find the substance that has the lowest disintegration rate (which means a
lower emission rate). You do not have to be concerned with the rate relative to the
starting rate.
Because the disintegration rate is always lower after more time, knock out choices F
and H right away. Table 1 shows that the rate for substance A after 20 hours is only 12.5
millicuries, while Table 2 shows 125 millicuries for substance B after 16 hours.
Passage 4
The key part of the introduction lies in the second paragraph, which tells you that the dis-
pute involves whether the earth is getting too warm because of increases in carbon dioxide.
Scientist 1 claims in the second sentence of her paragraph that it is. Scientist 2, on the other
hand, professes very directly in the first sentence of his paragraph that it is not. You have,
therefore, an obvious point of disagreement (as there should be, considering this type of 
passage is called Conflicting Viewpoints).
Both scientists use temperature evidence from the last hundred years to support their claims.
Scientist 1 uses some numbers to propose that there has been some significant warming 
and that the trend has been most dramatic recently. Scientist 2 mentions the temperature
342
Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: Full-Length Practice ACTs 

numbers toward the end of the passage and asserts that the recent numbers show that global
warming is under control. Although you shouldn’t get hung up on details, note that Scientist 1
mentions an increase of 0.6°C while Scientist 2 comes in with 0.45°C for the overall increase
in the past hundred years. To reason as a scientist does (remember that the test is entitled
“Science Reasoning”), figure that such discrepancies suggest that the data are not clear.
Did you notice the correct grammar: “The data are not clear,” in this sentence? “Data” is a
plural word, requiring a plural verb. I know, I know, it isn’t fair to make you think of grammar
in the middle of science . . . but I bet you’ll remember this point now!
Scientist 1 cites computer models that indicate future global warming. According to
Scientist 1 (don’t you love those creative titles?), the increase in temperature will be signifi-
cant if increases in carbon dioxide are stabilized and even more weighty if the carbon diox-
ide levels continue to increase. Scientist 2 casts doubt on the models. Don’t try to follow all
of Scientist 2’s logic, but note that he says that the models don’t account for key factors and
that they have already been shown to have exaggerated increases in both carbon dioxide
and temperature.
17. D. Look at the first two sentences of Scientist 1. She mentions a match between carbon
dioxide and temperature variations, and then uses the recent large change in carbon
dioxide levels as evidence that significant changes in temperature will occur. Scientist 1
goes on to discuss how continued sharp increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide will
lead to similar dramatic temperature increases. Scientist 1 implies that the recent carbon
dioxide changes have been unprecedented. The data during the past 160,000 years show
a correspondence between temperature and carbon dioxide fluctuations but such a
correspondence has occurred in the absence of the dramatic changes the earth is now
and soon will be experiencing. For Scientist 1 to use the fluctuation correspondence as
evidence for what will soon happen, she must assume that the correspondence will
continue in light of current and near-future sharp changes.
Feedback factors are discussed by Scientist 2 in light of the computer models; right
there is a good reason to eliminate choice A, because the question asks about Scientist
1. You may infer from Scientist 2’s discussion that the main difference between the two
scientists regarding feedback factors is that Scientist 1 thinks that they’ll increase the
carbon dioxide-related warming and that Scientist 2 thinks that they will minimize it.
Choice B is implied by Scientist 1 when she mentions that greenhouse gas concentra-
tion can be stabilized. Choice C is contradicted by Scientist 1 in that she mentions that
a 0.5°C rise is significant.
18. H. Choice G is tempting in that only Scientist 2 questions the models currently being
used. He claims that a model that appropriately incorporates feedback factors will
show that global surface temperatures will not rise as high as models currently predict.
The problem with choice G is not that Scientist 2’s viewpoint is inconsistent with the
article but that Scientist 1’s viewpoint is also consistent. Scientist 1 relies on computer
models. It could very well be that an updated model will make Scientist 1’s case even
stronger. You don’t know exactly how those feedback factors will contribute to global
warming. Don’t take Scientist 2’s opinion that the feedback factors will minimize warm-
ing as a fact. Although either scientist could turn out to be wrong in the face of a new
model, both viewpoints are now consistent with the statement in the question.
19. A. As mentioned in the analysis of the passage, the discrepancy in the temperature 
figures suggests that calculating global temperatures is not a clear-cut process. Mean
global temperature over 100 years entails gathering data from many sites for a long
period of time. Some of these sites could have changed. It’s also easy to envision that
there is not one accepted way to average all these sites together so that they can repre-
sent what has happened around the entire world.

Chapter 22: Practice Exam 2: Answers and Explanations

Choice B is wrong because a temperature measure is just that, a measure of tempera-
ture. The carbon dioxide is important only in that a change in carbon dioxide levels
might account for why the temperature levels change. They are not included when
numbers for temperature are taken and calculated.
Choice C is wrong because such an issue concerns only when the change in tempera-
ture occurred. Scientist 2 could very well also know about the hot years after 1980. The
issue is simply how the present numbers compare to the numbers 100 years ago.
Choice D has to do with the consequences of increasing temperatures, not with the
extent to which temperatures have risen.
20. J. The breakup of the ice sheet is indicative of global warming. Scientist 1 predicts
greater global warming in the next hundred years, so she would expect there to be
additional breaking up of Antarctic ice sheets. More breakup should lead to higher
water levels and greater vulnerability to flooding.
Choice F is something that Scientist 2, who predicts minimal global warming in part
because of feedback factors, would predict. Choice G is too exact. The passages dis-
cuss some numbers regarding the relationship between carbon dioxide and tempera-
ture, but even for those two variables there is no indication that the relationship is as
precise as a doubling of one means a doubling of the other. There is no mention of the
ice sheet in the passage, so eliminate choice G. Choice H may tempt you if you think
that ice means cooling, but remember that the ice is melting in this case. The main
problem with choice H is that, even if choice H were true, you would have to have
some specific science knowledge to say so.
Remember that a correct answer on the ACT never depends on specialized scientific
knowledge.
21. A. Choice A is a nice, noncontroversial statement with which both scientists would
agree. Scientist 1 stresses that rising carbon dioxide is linked to higher temperature
(another factor) while Scientist 2 discusses feedback factors, that is, factors that respond
to carbon dioxide changes and will, in turn, affect the carbon dioxide. Scientist 2, who
refers to improved energy technology, clearly disagrees with choice B but so does
Scientist 1, who mentions the possibility that carbon dioxide levels will stabilize. Choice
C is out because Scientist 2 discusses a slowing down in the rate of carbon dioxide level
increase. Choice D, because of “directly,” is too extreme.
Often, strong or extreme words are incorrect; view them skeptically. Scientist 2, by dis-
cussing feedback factors, certainly thinks that there is no direct link.
22. H. Scientist 1 asserts that a 0.6°C rise is significant because a 0.5°C change affected
crop growth in the past. What if the 0.5°C change were a drop in temperature? It could
be that increased temperatures will do nothing to the crops because the crops will do
fine as long as temperatures stay above a certain level.
Eliminate choice F because carbon dioxide has to do with what may cause global
warming. It determines what significance increased temperatures will have. In addition,
the 150-year figure in this choice doesn’t challenge the 100-year figure Scientist 1 pre-
sents about temperatures. The time periods still overlap, and there is general accept-
ance that both carbon dioxide and temperature are increasing. The big questions are
to what extent the two are related and what the consequences will be.
Choice G is not very important, because it’s clear that there have been higher tempera-
tures toward the end of the 100-year period. It is not too important exactly which years
had these higher temperatures. Because it’s been only a little more than 20 years since
1980, there isn’t too much room for variation anyway, so don’t think less of Scientist 1
for omitting the exact years.
344
Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: Full-Length Practice ACTs 

Choice J is out primarily because this choice has to do with the future, not the past
hundred years. Also, Scientist 1 is free to predict a greater increase during the next
hundred years because conditions are changing.
23. B. Scientist 2 mentions that water vapor and clouds make up 98% of the greenhouse
effect, so it’s reasonable to say that a change in water vapor will affect the greenhouse
effect, which, in turn, will affect temperatures. In addition, Scientist 2 discusses how
water vapor serves as a feedback effect, which contributes to temperature.
Choice A goes too far. Always be on the watch for answers that go beyond what you
want, ones that are too extreme or continue past the point required. Scientist 2 men-
tions improved energy technology, implying that humans can handle some problems
brought on by global warming, but you can’t say whether Scientist 2 believes that
humans can handle anything that comes our way.
Choice C picks up on the difference in figures mentioned at the end of the two Scientists’
passages, but watch out for “never.” Scientist 2 believes that the level will be below 1,100
parts per million in 2100, but he could feel that the level eventually will rise to 1,100.
Scientist 2 may believe choice D, but it is too extreme to say for sure. Scientist 2 believes
that the rate of increase will slow and that the world will survive, but Scientist 2 could
easily believe that such survival will occur even in the face of continually rising carbon
dioxide levels.
Passage 5
Did you look at this experiment and mutter to yourself, “What a blooming mess!” If so, con-
gratulate yourself: Your humor is becoming almost as sorry as mine. That aside, this passage
isn’t too bad. This passage doesn’t shock the senses by introducing concepts unfamiliar to
you. You’ve seen plants produce flowers at only a certain time of year. You know that the
length of daylight is different throughout the year (longer days in summer, shorter days in
winter).
After you’ve got the topic of this passage (the effect of the length of day on plants), you’re
ready to summarize each experiment. (You may want to write your brief synopsis in the
margin.) Experiment 1 shows that interrupting the day has no effect.
Experiment 2 shows that interrupting the night changes the plants’ responses, indicating
that the plants may actually respond to the length of night rather than the length of day. An
SD plant is actually a long-night plant, whereas an LD plant is a short-night plant.
Experiment 3 may sound complicated, but the gist is that, as with Experiment 1, manipulat-
ing the day has no effect on the plants.
In Experiment 4, as in Experiment 2, changing a nighttime factor affects the plants.
Taken together, these experiments suggest that the plants are sensitive to changes in the
length of night, rather than the length of day. Don’t economize on time here. Wanting to jump
right into the questions is natural, but take a minute or two to think about what you just
read. You don’t have to be able to quote chapter and verse; you just have to know a little bit
of what’s going on. If you get confused here, you’re likely to miss nearly every question.
24. J. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that only interruptions that occur during the night
affect the flowering response. Eliminate choices F and H, which mention daytime
hours. Choice J makes more sense than choice G because if the total number of hours
are critical, a brief interruption would have very little effect. On the other hand, if the
plants are somehow measuring the number of continuous nighttime hours, a brief
interruption would affect the plant.
345
Chapter 22: Practice Exam 2: Answers and Explanations

25. C. One major point of this passage is that SD and LD plants show opposite responses.
This difference makes choices A and D unlikely. You can make a good guess at this point
by choosing between choices B and C. Remember, the ACT does not subtract points for
wrong answers, so guessing is always justified. Having a 50-50 choice is a real treat.
When the light is presented in the middle of the 16-hour night, the plants are exposed
to only 8 hours of uninterrupted night hours. The plant that flowers when nights are
short will start flowering. Which plant meets this criteria? The LD plant, which is
spinach in this passage, flowers when days are long and nights are short.
You may be saying, “Yes, but what if . . .” Ah, Smart Students’ Disease (in which you
make things harder than necessary) is back. Don’t be too concerned with the exact
number of uninterrupted nighttime hours that spinach requires to flower. Although
some LD plants may not flower until the number of uninterrupted night hours falls to,
say, seven hours, the ACT will not pull this type of trick on you. The ACT does not
expect you to memorize such obscure facts. What the ACT is testing is your under-
standing that a nighttime interruption effectively shortens the night and therefore
leads to LD flowering.
The information presented in the first part of the passage reinforces choice C. The pas-
sage mentions that cocklebur does not flower until day length is less than 15.5 hours.
This statement means that nighttime must exceed 8.5 hours (24 – 15.5 = 8.5) for cockle-
bur to flower. When the light is flashed in the middle of the 16-hour night, the night is
effectively only 8 hours long, which means that the cocklebur will not flower.
26. G. The experimenter can easily choose another plant, keep the lights on or off at a cer-
tain time, or change the temperature. Whether the plants flower, on the other hand,
has to do with how the plants respond to the conditions presented in the experiment.
Flowering depends on what happens to the other variables. Such dependent variables
are a step removed from the direct control of the experimenter.
27. C. In both sets of experiments, changing day conditions has no effect on the plants’
responses, although changing night conditions does. Choice D acknowledges this con-
sistency, but the reason focuses on how the experiments are set up, not on the results.
In many biological experiments, the same organisms are used, but doing so does not
guarantee similar results. (Imagine, for example, if you and your friend both had colds
and both were given aspirin. The aspirin does not guarantee that both of you would
have the same response to the medication.)
Choices A and B, besides being flat-out wrong from the start, also provide reasons that
focus on the experimental conditions rather than the results. In addition, choice A may
not even be correct because you have no information regarding the variety of plants
used in Experiments 1 and 2. Choice B points out a key way that the sets of experiments
differ, but the results are similar.
28. G. On the horizontal axes, day length increases to the right. The LD plant flowers during
long days. This information means that high vertical values are associated with the
right side of the graph. Eliminate choices H and J, in which flowering does not increase
with the increasing day length.
Choice G is better than choice F because with LD plants, no flowering occurs until a criti-
cal day length is reached. (The experiments actually show that the LD plant responds
when the length of night falls below a certain value, but associating an LD plant’s flower-
ing with long days is still okay.) In choice F, the graph continually rises, implying that
flowering increases as day length increases from 0 hours. Choice G correctly shows that
flowering does not occur when the day length is less than 15 hours.
29. C. So many questions are about SD and LD that you may have forgotten the third actor in
this play, a DN plant. Look at the introduction, which defines a DN plant as one that is not
sensitive to changes in day length. This type of plant should flower in any environment,
346
Part VII: I’d Rather Wait for the Movie: Full-Length Practice ACTs 

including near the equator. (So you shouldn’t be surprised that some weeds are DN
plants.) Because IV is part of the answer, choice B is out.
Plants that require very long or very short days will probably not flower near the equa-
tor because the day length stays close to 12 hours and will not approach the number 
of hours necessary for flowering. This means that III is out. Such an SD plant will flower
when days are less than 8 hours (and nights are more than 16 hours), which never hap-
pens near the equator. With III out, you can eliminate choice D, leaving you with only
choices A and C.
Do I and II seem reasonable? Yes, because the day length varies slightly from 12 hours
near the equator. Such changes are enough to produce flowering in plants that don’t
require much different from a 12-hour day/night. With statements I and II acceptable,
you can eliminate choice A.
Passage 6
Even though you do not need outside knowledge to answer these questions, information you
have gained over the years (along with just plain common sense) can be very helpful. The
ACT does not try to trap or trick you by giving wrong science. What you have learned in
school or from experience will remain valid and useful for the ACT.
Use your own knowledge. What’s more spread out: a solid, such as a block of ice, or oxygen
gas as it is sprayed from a tank into a room? You know or can visualize that in a gas, particles
quickly spread out as much as possible.
Continue using your own knowledge. What happens when you heat ice? The ice melts and
turns into liquid water. Further heating leads to boiling, and the water evaporates. These
thoughts should help you grasp what’s being stated in paragraph two.
The third paragraph is probably less familiar to you, but the figures should help. You can see
from Figure 2, for example, that at 60°C and 0.20 atm, water is a gas, but at 60°C and 0.80 atm,
water is a liquid. Try to summarize the information to get the gist or main point. The main
point is that pressure affects phases.
The figures re-emphasize that high temperature is associated with a gas and that low tem-
perature is associated with a solid. When pressure is high, a relatively high temperature is
needed to turn a liquid into a gas.
30. G. This straightforward question simply tests your ability to read a graph. Look at
Figure 2, which deals with water. Locate 60°C on the horizontal axis and then go straight
up until you are even with 1.00 atm (on the vertical axis). You are in the liquid region.
31. A. You are looking for a point on one of the figures where a solid is next to a gas.
Choice A looks good. In Figure 1 (bromine), –20°C and 0.05 atm is near the lower-left
corner, where a solid and a gas are next to each other. Liquid is out of the way, up and
to the right.
Choice B is wrong because at 0°C and 0.80 atm, bromine is near the solid-liquid bound-
ary. Water is also near that boundary at 0°C and 0.80 atm, so choice C is out. Choice D
is way off because water is nowhere near a solid at 80°C and 0.50 atm.
32. G. The easiest way to do this question is to take a straightedge (your answer grid will
work) and, on each figure, draw a vertical line from the 30°C mark. Now, for each figure,
mark 0.6 atm and 0.3 atm on the line. On the bromine graph (Figure 1), 0.6 atm is in the
liquid region, and 0.3 atm is in the gas region when the temperature is 30° C, so choice
G is the answer. Don’t be careless and pick choice F. The pressure is going down, so
you’re moving from the liquid to the gas, not from a gas to a liquid. The liquid region is
generally higher than the gas region. On the water graph (Figure 2), you can see that
both of your marks are in the liquid region, eliminating choices H and J.
347
Chapter 22: Practice Exam 2: Answers and Explanations

Figure 1: Bromine Phases.
33. D. Your gut instinct should attract you to choices B and D because higher tempera-
tures move particles further apart. If you are running out of time, go ahead and make a
guess; 50/50 odds aren’t that bad on this test, and remember: The ACT has no penalty
for wrong answers. Choice D is correct because water at 100°C and 0.60 atm is a gas,
while bromine at 50°C and 0.80 atm (choice B) is a liquid. Just to be certain, (good test-
takers are always paranoid, but are you paranoid enough?), check choices A and C. In
choice A, bromine is a solid. In choice C, water is also a solid.
34. H. You can probably eliminate choice F by using common sense: Higher altitudes don’t
necessarily mean your pasta freezes! When an answer seems illogical or even amusing,
put it aside for a moment. If none of the other answer choices are correct, you can
always come back to it. (For those of you who love Sherlock Holmes, you will recognize
this strategy as a variation on his famous saying, which roughly goes, “When you have
eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be true.”)
Go through the rest of the choices without wasting any time on choice F. Choice G is
out because the water temperature (the spaghetti is in the water) is important, not 
the air temperature. A look at Figure 2 confirms the first part of choice H: At 1.00 atm,
water becomes a gas. At 0.80 atm, water becomes a gas at about 90°C. With the water
boiling at a lower temperature, there’s less heat available to soften the spaghetti. The
answer is probably choice H, but double-check choice J just to be sure. Choice J is con-
tradicted by Figure 2 (think of how you analyzed choice H). Besides, in this problem,
the water is already boiling, so the length of time required to boil water is irrelevant.
Passage 7
First of all, don’t panic if the terminology is not familiar to you. You don’t have to know what
radon is to understand the introduction. Remember that the ACT does not presuppose any
specific scientific knowledge on your part. Simply note that radon may have something to do
with earthquakes and that scientists are going to check out this possibility.
Spend a minute or two looking at the charts. You don’t have to understand the charts per-
fectly, and you certainly don’t want to start memorizing the information given. Just realize
that Figures 1 through 4 are basically maps. You can see the epicenters and note that wells
around the epicenters have higher-than-normal amounts of radon emission.

Figure 5 shows a systematic relationship (called a correlation) between earthquake magni-
tude and the differential, which is a measure of how much the radon emission exceeds
normal. The rightmost point is the only one that bucks the trend. When you see something
abnormal, something that doesn’t follow the same pattern as the others, pay special atten-
tion to it. The chances are good that you will be asked a question about this aberration.
Which earthquake site is represented by the rightmost point? The site had a magnitude of 7.9
and an average differential of 2.5. Scan Figures 1 through 4 and you will see that the point in
question represents China. Note that China has two wells near the epicenter that were not
much above normal. Perhaps these wells were measured inaccurately. Whatever the case,
these wells may have something to do with why China is a little off in regard to Figure 5.
35. B. Choice A doesn’t look right. All four sites had radon emissions that were greater
than the normal amount found over the earth, making choice B look good.
You should have been leaning toward choosing B as soon as you saw the wishy-washy,
wimpy language. A correct answer often has language that is not extreme, language
that hedges a little bit. A conclusion that stated that an association is definitely present
would be too strong unless a lot more data were collected.
None of the figures show wells that are 1,000 km (10 cm) away from the epicenter, so
you can determine nothing about choice C.
The conclusion stated in choice D is also unjustified. For the most part, wells near the
epicenters show higher emissions, but the numbers are not very close to 5 percent and
no measurement was taken right at the epicenter.
36. H. The results of the studies indicate some association between earthquakes and
radon emissions. Results that go along with the trend found in the studies strengthen
the results and any claim derived from the results. Option I is one such result. You can
already see that a higher-than-normal emission from all the well sites shown exists.
With more evidence, the case becomes more compelling. Because statement I is true,
you can immediately narrow the answers down to choices H or J. If you’re in a huge
rush, guess and go. Remember: The ACT does not subtract points for wrong answers.
Guessing is always to your advantage.
Does statement II look good? It does if you remember the introductory analysis about
China. The one point that is off in Figure 5 is the one from China. The finding cited in
statement II would produce a point that would fall in line with the points from the other
three sites. Because statement II is valid, choice J has been eliminated.
On the real test, you wouldn’t even need to look at statement III. However, for you 
skeptics in the audience, I’ll examine III. It does not provide enough information. What
is needed are more quakes associated with high radon emissions. Simply having more
quakes doesn’t shed any light on the association between earthquakes and radon 
emissions.
37. A. You have to be careful when dealing with data that show an association (a correla-
tion in more mathematical terms). Just because two things go together does not imply
that one causes the other. For example, the number of skyscrapers in a city and the
number of children who live in that city have a correlation. That is, in general, cities
that have more skyscrapers also have more young people. Does this mean that young
people are building the skyscrapers? Of course not. A more reasonable explanation is
that when a city is large, it has many skyscrapers and youngsters. An underlying cause,
namely overall city size, exists. Children do not cause skyscrapers or vice versa.
This study simply measured a correlation. This study was not designed to investigate
any possible mechanism that would convert radon emissions into earthquakes, which
knocks out choices C and D and narrows the field to choices A and B. Choice B is out
because nothing in the study points to 4 percent as a magic number. This point is not
true, but even if it were, you would not have to know this information from some spe-
cialized outside study, which is not required on the ACT.
349
Chapter 22: Practice Exam 2: Answers and Explanations

38. J. When experimental results are obtained, the responsible factor is often unclear. For
example, if a scientist wanted to study whether a new drug could increase ACT scores,
he could give the drug to a group of students and then look at the scores. If the scores
are high, the scientist could conclude that the drug had an effect. But what if the group
studied included many people who have a history of scoring well on tests similar to
the ACT? What if the students did better simply because they believed the drug would
help them? By including a control condition, experimenters can rule out these possibil-
ities. Experimenters can find a group that was equal to the drug group on previous test
scores and then give these control students a placebo (a fake pill) but tell them that
this pill is supposed to help raise ACT scores. If the drug group scores higher, experi-
menters can be more confident that the high scores weren’t simply the result of using a
high-achieving group or a psychological belief in the drug because the two groups were
matched in terms of these factors. In this case, the chemicals in the drug more likely
had something to do with the higher scores. The control condition helped rule out other
possible factors.
In the earthquake studies, radon emissions were measured after earthquakes. The
researchers obtained high values, but such values can occur even in the absence of an
earthquake. Scientists would need to know the radon emission level that normally
occurs in the sites studied.
In a sense, choices F and H mention conditions that are included in the studies. The
studies compared the wells near the epicenters to worldwide values. Sites far from the
epicenters or in virtually earthquake-free areas are included in the worldwide averages.
All choice G would do is add more data to what has already been found. Clearing up
the graph in Figure 5 would be particularly helpful, but the condition is not a control
condition.
39. A. Use common sense! If you want to predict an earthquake, you have to measure
something before the earthquake occurs. The problem with the current studies is that
scientists measured emissions after the earthquakes. Maybe the earthquakes caused
the emissions, making radon pretty useless as a predictor. Choices B, C, and D wouldn’t
help unless measurements were taken before.
You aren’t required to have specific science knowledge to answer an ACT question, but
the test-makers do assume a level of common sense. The ACT does not teach or test
false science (for example, you won’t have an experiment with totally illogical results).
This small act of kindness means that you can trust your common sense and general
knowledge. The science portion of the ACT has very few traps or tricks in it. The sci-
ence is pretty straightforward, as are the questions. Don’t make these questions harder
than they have to be.
40. H. What’s so puzzling about choice F? One site had to have the strongest earthquake,
so why not China? Choice G is logical. It’s not surprising that the highest differential
would be found near the epicenter of the strongest earthquake, given the trend shown
in Figure 5.
Choice H is the strange one. At the other three sites, the wells closest to the epicenter
had differentials that were among the highest found in the area. In China, the two clos-
est wells had far lower differentials. Choice J is not puzzling. Why not measure from as
many wells as possible? Besides, readings were taken from six wells in Chile as well as
China.

hey’re whispered in the bathrooms and written in notes passed in the classroom. What
are they? They’re the vile and vicious rumors about the ACT — rumors that seem to
grow with each telling.
 “You can’t use a calculator.” (Wrong. You may use a calculator, just as you may use one
on the SAT.)
 “They make you write an essay.” (No. The essay is optional. You write an essay on the
SAT II, but the ACT essay is optional.)
On the Friday night before the ACT, the phone rings off the hook. We spend hours reassuring
students and their parents that the latest rumors they’ve heard about the ACT are com-
pletely false. Here are ten of the rumors you may have heard.
You Can’t Study for the ACT
If you really thought that, why did you buy this book (not that we don’t appreciate your pur-
chase, mind you)? The ACT tests grammar; you can certainly refresh your memory of the
grammar rules. The ACT has algebra, geometry, and arithmetic questions on it; you can cer-
tainly study formulas and rules in those areas. In addition, a little preparation can make you
very comfortable with the format and timing of the test, helping to reduce test-taking anxiety
and ultimately improve your score. This book, in particular, discusses tricks and traps that
are built into the exam — gotchas! that we want you to be prepared for.
Different States Have Different ACTs
This rumor is based on the fact that the score sheet compares your performance to that of
other students who have taken the ACT in your state. When you get back your ACT score,
you are told your percentile rank nationally and within your state. However, all students in all
states take the exact same ACT on any one test date. (Of course, the ACT changes from one
date to the next; otherwise, you could keep retaking the same test. You’d be surprised how
many students don’t realize this and merrily say to us, “Oh, I remember the questions from
last time, so I’ll do great next time.”) It will do you no good to fly to Rhode Island or
Nebraska, thinking that you can get an easier exam there.

The ACT Has a Passing Score
There is no such thing as a passing or failing score on the ACT. By looking at the college bul-
letins of the schools you are interested in, you can, however, deduce your minimum entrance
score based on your GPA. If you have a high GPA, your ACT score can be lower than if you
have a low GPA. In fact, you may be pleasantly surprised how low your ACT score can be.
Scoring on the ACT is not like scoring on high school exams, in which a 65th percentile is fail-
ing. If you score in the 65th percentile on the ACT, you may still be able to get into the college
of your choice.
The ACT Tests IQ
The ACT is a college entrance exam. It tests your potential for doing well in college. If you are
the type who normally studies hard for an exam, you will probably study hard for the ACT
and do well on it, and then study hard for college exams and do well on them, too. The key is
in the preparation. You have the same opportunity to do well on the ACT regardless of
whether you’re a SuperBrain or as cerebrally challenged as the rest of us. With this book, you
can learn to improve your ACT scores with all sorts of tricks, tips, and techniques — some-
thing that is much harder to do on IQ exams.
If You Don’t Know the Answer, Choose A or F
We’re constantly amazed by how many people say they’ve heard this rumor. The answer
choices on the ACT are A, B, C, and D, or F, G, H, and J. (Note: The one exception is the
Mathematics Test. In that section, the answer choices are A, B, C, D, and E or F, G, H, J, and K.)
Students repeatedly tell us that they’ve been told to guess an A or an F if they don’t know the
answer. This speculation is ridiculous. Every answer choice has the same possibility: one of
four choices (or in the math section, one of five choices).
You Should Never Guess
Wrong, wrong, wrong. You should always guess on the ACT. This exam has no penalty for
guessing. Never leave an answer blank. Fill in something, anything, on the chance that you
may get lucky and get the question correct.
If you’re also taking the SAT I, notice that the two exams are different in this respect. The SAT
I penalizes you (either 1⁄4 or 1⁄3 point, depending on the type of question) for each wrong
answer, so that random guessing on that test is discouraged (except on the grid-in math por-
tion). Random guessing on the ACT, however, can only help you.
The ACT Is Easier than the SAT I
Maybe. Maybe not. The ACT has no vocabulary on it, only English grammar. Obviously, if
you are better at grammar than vocabulary, the ACT is easier for you. The math questions
on the ACT are all straightforward multiple-choice with none of the tricky QC (Quantitative
Comparisons) or grid-in questions featured on the SAT I. However, the ACT does feature a
few trigonometry questions (only about four; don’t sweat ’em) that are not on the SAT I. The
ACT reading passages, both in the Reading Test and in the Science Reasoning Test, tend to
be slightly longer than some of those on the SAT I but are not necessarily more difficult.

Part VIII: The Part of Tens 

The ACT Is the Same as the Achievement Test
Many people, especially parents, confuse ACT with ACH. The Achievement Test used to be
referred to as ACH. To confuse everyone totally, the test-makers have renamed the
Achievement Test the SAT II. Got that? The regular old SAT is the SAT I; the former
Achievement Test is the SAT II. Neither is connected with the ACT, which stands for
American College Testing. SAT II consists of single-subject tests that require you to actually
know things like Chinese verbs or botany rules. The ACT does not test single subjects, but it
does test general knowledge and reasoning skills.
You Have to Write an Essay
No. You do not have to write an essay during the ACT. It is optional. However, within a few
years, colleges will require this section and make it mandatory. In fact, some colleges are
already requiring it. Taking this portion of the test is a good idea even though you really do
not want to. 
You Can’t Take Both the SAT I and the ACT
Wrong, wrong, wrong. Many students take both exams. Usually, the ACT is offered a week or
two after the SAT I. You may be burned out, taking two exams this close together or have
trouble studying for both of them, but you certainly may take both tests. Some colleges
require the SAT I. Other colleges will accept either the ACT or the SAT I. A few colleges
accept the ACT only. When we tutor students, we suggest that they take both exams.

Ten Differences between the ACT
and the SAT
In This Chapter
 Identifying the different content of the ACT and the SAT I
 Recognizing the differences in how you take the ACT and SAT I
W
hat’s the difference between the ACT and the SAT I? Do they test different things? Do
they require different study programs? Is it possible to know whether you’ll do
better on one test than the other? This chapter gives you the ten (well, actually only seven)
primary differences between the SAT and the ACT.
The ACT Emphasizes English Grammar;
The SAT I Emphasizes Vocabulary
The ACT requires that you know grammar rules, such as the distinction between lie and lay
or it’s and its. The SAT I doesn’t test grammar. However, the SAT I has sentence completions
that feature big, hard words like pulchritudinous and pusillanimous. The ACT doesn’t test
vocabulary.
The ACT Has an Optional Essay Question;
The SAT I Has a Required Essay Section
The ACT has an optional Essay section. However, it appears that colleges and universities
probably will require this section in the near future. The SAT I also has an essay question, but
it is mandatory!
The ACT Questions Are All Multiple-Choice;
SAT I Math Questions Aren’t
All questions on the ACT have multiple-choice responses. The SAT I has ten questions (20
percent) that have no multiple-choice responses. You have to solve a math problem yourself
and enter your answer in the bubble. In addition, the SAT I has a bizarre type of math ques-
tion called the QC (or quantitative comparison). That style of question is not on the ACT.

The ACT Tests Science Reasoning;
The SAT I Doesn’t
One of the four tests on the ACT is Science Reasoning. The test features science reading pas-
sages, sometimes with charts or diagrams that you have to read and use to answer ques-
tions. You may be required to interpret an experiment or understand information in a table.
Don’t worry, you’re not expected to know scientific information on your own. That is, you
don’t have to have had physics to answer questions on a physics passage. The passage gives
you all the information you need.
The SAT I has no science reasoning per se. However, one of the reading passages (called
Critical Reading on the SAT I) is usually on a science topic.
The ACT Doesn’t Penalize You 
for Guessing; The SAT I Does
The ACT allows you to guess your brains out. When taking it, you don’t receive any penalty
for missing a question, so never leave anything blank. On the SAT I, however, you lose either
1⁄3 or 1⁄4 of a point for wrong answers (depending on the question style).
The ACT Has Five Long Sections;
The SAT I Has Ten Short Sections
The ACT has one 60-minute section, one 45-minute section, two 35-minute sections, and one
30-minute optional writing section. The SAT has seven 25-minute sections, two 20-minute sec-
tions and one 10-minute section (one of which is equating, or experimental, and doesn’t
count).
The ACT Has No Experimental 
Sections; The SAT I Has One
On the ACT, everything counts. The SAT I has a 25-minute section (either math or verbal)
that doesn’t count toward your score. No, you won’t know which section it is. If you did, you
wouldn’t take it seriously, now would you? The SAT I test-makers are using you as a guinea
pig to try out new questions.
