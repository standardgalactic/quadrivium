Abstract: In both biology and the human sciences, social groups are sometimes treated as adaptive units whose organization cannot be
reduced to individual interactions. This group-level view is opposed by a more individualistic one that treats social organization as a
byproduct of self-interest. According to biologists, group-level adaptations can evolve only by a process of natural selection at the
group level. Most biologists rejected group selection as an important evolutionary force during the 1960s and 1970s but a positive
literature began to grow during the 1970s and is rapidly expanding today. We review this recent literature and its implications for
human evolutionary biology. We show that the rejection of group selection was based on a misplaced emphasis on genes as
"replicators" which is in fact irrelevant to the question of whether groups can be like individuals in their functional organization. The
fundamental question is whether social groups and other higher-level entities can be "vehicles" of selection. When this elementary
fact is recognized, group selection emerges as an important force in nature and what seem to be competing theories, such as kin
selection and reciprocity, reappear as special cases of group selection. The result is a unified theory of natural selection that operates
on a nested hierarchy of units.
The vehicle-based theory makes it clear that group selection is an important force to consider in human evolution. Humans can
facultatively span the full range from self-interested individuals to "organs" of group-level "organisms." Human behavior not only
reflects the balance between levels of selection but it can also alter the balance through the construction of social structures that have
the effect of reducing fitness differences within groups, concentrating natural selection (and functional organization) at the group
level. These social structures and the cognitive abilities that produce them allow group selection to be important even among large
groups of unrelated individuals.
Keywords: altruism; group selection; human evolution; levels of selection; sociobiology
The existence of egoistic forces in animal life
has long been recognized. It is not so well
known that the idea of group-centered forces
in animal life also has a respectable history.
(Allee 1943, p. 519)
It is a crude oversimplification to conceive of
social motives as being capable of direct
derivation from a hedonic algebra of self-
interest - real or fictitious - based on a few
universal human drives, whatever the choice
of the drives may be.
(Tajfel 1981, p. 36)
These quotations illustrate a perspective in which social
groups have a primacy that cannot be reduced to individ-
ual interactions. This group-level perspective can be
found in biology and all branches of the human behavioral
sciences (e.g., anthropology, economics, psychology, so-
ciology). It is opposed by another perspective that treats
individuals as primary and social groups as mere conse-
quences of individual interactions. Although the conflict
between the two perspectives is often dismissed as se-
mantic, it refuses to go away, suggesting that substantive
issues are involved.
In biology, the conflict between the two perspectives
has had a remarkable history. Prior to 1960, it was quite
acceptable to think of social groups and even whole
ecosystems as highly adapted units, similar to individuals
in the harmony and coordination of their parts.1 Williams
(1966) and others argued that group-level adaptations
require a process of natural selection at the group level
and that this process, though theoretically possible, is
unlikely to be important in nature. Their verdict quickly
became the majority view and was celebrated as a major
scientific advance, similar to the rejection of Lamarkian-
ism. A- generation of graduate students learned about
group selection as an example of how not to think and it
became almost mandatory for the authors of journal arti-
cles to assure their readers that group selection was not
being invoked. Nevertheless, a positive literature began
to grow in the '70s and is rapidly expanding today (Table
I).2 It is no longer heretical for biologists to think of

natural selection as a hierarchical process that often oper-
ates at the group level.
The most recent developments in biology have not yet
reached the human behavioral sciences, which still know
group selection primarily as the bogeyman of the 60s and
'70s. The purpose of this target article is to reintroduce
group selection to the human behavioral sciences. We
think group selection can provide a firm foundation for a
group-level perspective in the human sciences, as it has in
biology. Before beginning, however, it is important to
note a complication. Evolutionary approaches to human
behavior have become increasingly common, as readers
of Behavioral and Brain Sciences well know. Unfor-
tunately, some of the most prominent evolutionary biolo-
gists interested in human behavior have themselves failed
to incorporate the recent literature and still present group
selection as a bogeyman (e.g., Alexander 1979; 1987; Daly
& Wilson 1988; Trivers 1985; but see Table 1 entries
marked "H" for exceptions). We must accordingly rein-
troduce group selection to human sociobiology as well as
to the more traditional branches of the human sciences.
1. A brief review of the group
selection controversy
i
1.1. The adaptationlst program
In an influential paper, Gould and Lewontin (1979) crit-
icized evolutionists for using adaptation as their only
explanatory principle, to the exclusion of other factors
such as genetic drift and genetic/developmental con-
straints. They coined the term "adaptationist program" as
a pejorative and their conclusion that it cannot be the only
tool in the evolutionist's tool kit is well taken. At the same
time, their message should not obscure the fact that the
adaptationist program, or "natural selection thinking"
(Charnov 1982), is an extremely powerful tool for predict-
ing the properties of organisms.
One of the virtues of the adaptationist program is that it
can be used with minimal knowledge of the physiological,
biochemical, and genetic processes that make up the
organisms under examination. For example, imagine
studying the evolutionary effects of predation on snails,
seeds, and beetles. Suppose you discover that for all three
groups, species exposed to heavy predation have harder
and thicker exteriors than species not so exposed. The
property "hard exterior" can be predicted from knowl-
edge of the selection pressures operating on the popula-
tions. Since the exteriors of snails, beetles, and seeds are
made of completely different materials, there is a sense in
which these materials are irrelevant to the prediction
(Campbell 1974; D. S. Wilson 1988). That is why Darwin
was able to achieve his fundamental insights despite
almost total ignorance of the mechanistic processes that
make up organisms. Adaptationist explanations have the
power to unify phenomena that are physiologically, bio-
chemically, and genetically quite different.
The adaptationist program is valuable even if its predic-
tions turn out to be untrue. If we know the traits that
organisms will have if natural selection i$ the only influ-
ence on evolutionary trajectories, then deviations from
these traits constitute evidence that factors other than
natural selection have played a significant role. To dis-
588
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

cover whether adaptationism is true or false, optimality
models are indispensable (Orzack & Sober 1994; Sober
1993b).
Although the following discussion is, in effect, a view
about how the adaptationist program should be pursued,
it involves no substantive commitment to the success of
that program. Regardless of the scope and limits of adap-
tationism, the question, What would organisms be like if
they were well adapted? is of paramount importance in
evolutionary biology.
1.2. The adaptationist program
and the biological hierarchy
The question, What would organisms be like if they were
well adapted? is more complicated than it sounds. To see
this, consider an imaginary population of rabbits inhabit-
ing an island. A mutant arises that grazes more efficiently
- so efficiently that: a population of such mutants will
overexploit their resources and become extinct. The mu-
tation is adaptive in the limited sense of causing its bearer
to have more offspring than other rabbits, but maladap-
tive in the larger sense of driving the population to
extinction.
This example should sound familiar to human behav-
ioral scientists because it resembles the social dilemmas
that abound in human life. It corresponds to the tragedy
of the commons popularized by Hardin (1968), the voting
problem of economics (Margolis 1982), and the prisoner's
dilemma of game theory (Rapoport & Chammah 1965).
For humans and nonhumans alike, individual striving can
lead to social chaos. [See also Maynard Smith: "Game
Theory and the Evolution of Behaviour" BBS 7 (1) 1984;
Caporael et al.: "Selfishness Examined" BBS 12 (4) 1989.]
As was previously mentioned, many biologists before
the '60s uncritically assumed that natural selection
evolves adaptations at upper levels of the biological hier-
archy. In our imaginary example they would assume that
the population of rabbits evolves to manage its resources.
The possibility that adaptation at one level of the hier-
archy can be maladaptive at another level was either
ignored or assumed to be resolved in favor of the higher
level. These sentiments, which today are called "naive
group selectionism," permeated the textbooks and were
espoused by many eminent biologists, including Alfred
Emerson (1960), who believed that all of nature was as
functionally integrated as a termite colony. As a young
postdoctoral associate at the University of Chicago, G. C.
Williams attended a lecture by Emerson and left mutter-
ing, "Something must be done. . . . " The result was a
modern classic, Adaptation and natural selection (Wil-
liams 1966).3
Williams's argument against higher-level adaptations
came in three parts. First, he claimed that adaptation at
any level of the biological hierarchy requires a process of
natural selection operating at that level. Returning to our
population of rabbits, it is easy to see that efficient grazers
will evolve because they have more offspring than ineffi-
cient grazers. The negative consequences at the popula-
tion level are irrelevant. However, if we imagine an
archipelago in which only some of the islands contain the
mutant strain, then populations driven extinct by the
mutant can be replaced by other populations without
Wilson & Sober: Group selection
the mutant. The population-level adaptation can now
persist, but only because we have added a process of
natural selection at that level; fit populations replace unfit
populations in the same sense that fit rabbits replace unfit
rabbits within populations. This is what evolutionary
biologists term group selection.
Second, Williams (1966) argued that group selection is
unimportant in nature despite the fact that it is theoreti-
cally possible:
It is universally conceded by those who have seriously con-
cerned themselves with this problem that such group-related
adaptations must be attributed to the natural selection of
alternative groups of individuals and that the natural selec-
tion of alternative alleles within populations will be opposed
to this development. I am in entire agreement with the
reasoning behind this conclusion. Only by a theory of
between-group selection could we achieve a scientific expla-
nation of group-related adaptations. However, I would ques-
tion one of the premises on which the reasoning is based.
Chapters 5 to 8 will be primarily a defence of the thesis that
group-related adaptations do not, in fact exist, (p. 92)
Part of Williams's skepticism can be illustrated with our
rabbit example. If migration occurs between islands,
what is to prevent the mutant from "infecting" the other
islands before the original population becomes extinct?
Or perhaps the mutant population doesn't become extinct
but merely hobbles along in a malnourished state, in
which case the occasional migrant from other islands
would be unable to survive. At least for this example, it
seems that the parameters of the model must be very
finely tuned for group-level selection to prevail against
individual-level selection.
Third, Williams developed a concept of the gene as the
"fundamental unit of selection" that has become a major
theme in evolutionary biology, especially as amplified and
extended by Dawkins (1976; 1982a). Williams claimed
that groups and even individuals cannot be units of
selection because they are ephemeral and do not replicate
with sufficient fidelity. Every sexually reproducing organ-
ism is a unique combination of thousands of genes that
will never exist again, no matter how successful reproduc-
tively. At the individual level, only clonal organisms
replicate with sufficient fidelity to qualify as units of
selection. For sexually reproducing organisms, the gene
is the unit that is transmitted through time with high
fidelity and is therefore the fundamental unit of selection
(the replicator, in Dawkins's terminology). This is fre-
quently used as an argument against group selection. For
example, Alexander (1979) states:
In 1966 Williams published a book criticizing what he called
"some current evolutionary thought" and chastised biologists
for invoking selection uncritically at whatever level seemed
convenient. Williams' book was the first truly general argu-
ment that selection is hardly ever effective on anything but
the heritable genetic units of "genetic replicators" (Dawkins
1978) contained in the genotypes of individuals, (p. 36)
Individuals and groups appear in Williams's scheme,
not as units of selection, but as environments of the genes.
As the simplest example, consider two alleles (A,a) at a
single diploid locus in a randomly mating population,
yielding the familiar three genotypes (AA,Aa,aa) in
Hardy-Weinberg proportions. Suppose the fitnesses of
the three genotypes are WAA = 1, WAa = 0.75 and Waa =
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4
589

Wilson & Sober: Group selection
0.5. From the gene's-eye view, the A-allele can be said to
inhabit two "genotypic environments," AA and Aa, and its
average fitness can be easily calculated:
wA = PwAA + (i - P)wAa 
(l)
The term p, in addition to being the frequency of the
A-allele in the population, is also the proportion of A-al-
leles that exist in the AA "environment" in a randomly
mating population. The fitness of the a-allele can similarly
be averaged across its two genotypic environments
(Aa,aa) to yield:
Wa = pWAa + (1 - p)Waa 
(2)
The A-allele will evolve whenever WA > Wa, which is
always the case when WAA > WAa > Waa. Note that A and
a have the same fitness within the one genotypic environ-
ment that they inhabit together (the heterozygote). It is
only by averaging across genotypic environments that
differences in the fitness of A and a occur. Biologically
informed readers will recognize WA and Wa as the "aver-
age effects" of the two alleles used to calculate breeding
values and narrow-sense heritability at the individual
level (e.g., Falconer 1981; Wilson & Sober 1989).
More complicated examples can be constructed in
which the population is divided into social groups that
differ in allele frequencies and genotypic fitnesses. In
these cases the genes inhabit a more complicated array of
environments, but in principle it is always possible to
calculate gene-level fitness by averaging across genotypic
and social contexts. In addition, it will always be the case
that A replaces a when WA > Wa. This is why Williams
(1986; 1992) refers to genes as "bookkeeping" devices that
automatically record the net effect of multiple selection
pressures.
Williams's case against group selection was strength-
ened by two other theories in evolutionary biology that
were developed during the '60s and '70s. The first was
inclusive fitness theory (also called kin selection; Ham-
ilton 1964; Maynard Smith 1964), which explained how
altruism could evolve among genetic relatives. The
second was evolutionary game theory (Axelrod & Ham-
ilton 1981; Maynard Smith 1982a; Trivers 1971; Williams
1966), which explained how cooperation could evolve
among nonrelatives. These theories seemed to account
for many of the phenomena that group selection had been
invoked to explain. With the problems raised by Williams
and two robust alternatives, the theory of group selection,
never well articulated to begin with, collapsed.
Not all evolutionary biologists are familiar with the
details of Williams's arguments against group selection,
but the bottom line conclusion has been adopted with
such conviction that we will call it Williams's first com-
mandment: Thou shalt not apply the adaptationist pro-
gram above the level of the individual. All adaptations
must be explained in terms of the relative fitness of
individuals within populations. Individual-level adapta-
tions may have positive or negative effects at the group
level, but in both cases the group-level effects are irrele-
vant to evolutionary change. Williams's first command-
ment was repeated like a mantra throughout the '60s
and '70s, as every evolutionary biologist knows. Unfor-
tunately, the mantra still echoes through the numerous
accounts of evolutionary theory that are written for the
human sciences and popular audiences today (e.g., Alex-
ander 1987; Archer 1991; Cronin 1991; Daly & Wilson
1988; R. H. Frank 1988; Krebs 1987; MacDonald 1988b;
Noonan 1987; Sagan & Druyan 1992).,
1.3. Examining the edifice
Although Williams's and Dawkins's gene-centered view
has enjoyed enormous popularity, it has one flaw that
should be obvious, at least in retrospect. Naive group
selectionists thought that upper levels of the biological
hierarchy were like individual organisms in the coordina-
tion and harmony of their parts. According to Williams
and Dawkins, however, even sexually reproducing organ-
isms do not qualify as units of selection because they,
like groups, are too ephemeral. If a creature such as a bird
or a butterfly is not a unit of selection, then what en-
dows it with the internal harmony implied by the word
"organism"?
To answer this question, an entirely different concept
needed to be invoked which Dawkins (1976) called "vehi-
cles of selection" ("interactors" in Hull's 1980 terminol-
ogy). Using one of Dawkins's own metaphors, we can say
that genes in an individual are like members of a rowing
crew competing with other crews in a race. The only way
to win the race is to cooperate fully with the other crew
members. Similarly, genes are "trapped" in the same
individual with other genes and can usually replicate only
by causing the entire collective to survive and reproduce.
It is this property of shared fate that causes "selfish genes'
to coalesce into individual organisms.'
So far, so good, but if individuals Can be vehicles of
selection, what about groups? After all, we are interested
in comparing groups with individuals, not with genes. Yet
gene-centered theorists have scarcely addressed this
question.4 The situation is so extraordinary that historians
of science should study it in detail: a giant edifice is built
on the foundation of genes as replicators, and therefore as
the "fundamental" unit of selection, which seems to
obliterate the concept of groups as organisms. In truth,
however, the replicator concept cannot even account for
the organismic properties of individuals. Almost as an
afterthought, the vehicle concept is tacked onto the edi-
fice to reflect the harmonious organization of individuals,
but it is not extended to the level of groups. The entire
edifice therefore fails to address the question that it
originally seemed to answer so conclusively, and that
made it seem so important.
This is such a crucial and unappreciated point that we
want to reinforce it by quoting from The ant and the
peacock (Cronin 1991), one of the most recent book-
length treatments of evolution for a popular audience.5 It
was chosen as one of the year's best by the New York
Times and has been cited with approval by authorities
such as Williams (1993), Maynard Smith (1992), and
Dennett (1992).6 There is every reason for the reader to
think that it represents state-of-the-art evolutionary
biology.
Cronin (1991) agrees with us that naive group selection-
ists compared groups to individuals:
Many an ecologist, equipped with no < more than a flimsy
analogy, marched cheerfully from the: familiar Darwinian
territory of individual organisms into a world of populations
and groups. Populations were treated as individuals that just
happened to be a notch or two up in the hierarchy of life,
(p. 278)

BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

Wilson & Sober: Group selection
Her treatment of Williams is also close to our own:
"Williams retaliated with two types of argument. He
spelled out why genes are suitable candidates for units of
selection whereas organisms, groups and so on are
not . . . " (Cronin 1991, p. 286). Here Cronin commits
(along with Williams) the fallacy that we outlined above. If
individuals and groups are not replicators, then the repli-
cator concept cannot be used to argue that they are
different from each other! Faced with this dilemma,
Cronin (1991) dutifully invokes vehicles to explain the
organismal properties of individuals, with a nod to
groups:
If organisms are not replicators, what are they? The answer is
that they are vehicles of replicators. . . . Groups, too, are
vehicles, but far less distinct, less unified. . . . In this weak
sense, then, "group selection' could occur. . . . But even if
they [group-level adaptations] did arise - which as we've seen
is unlikely - they would in no way undermine the status of
genes as the only units of replicator selection. This does not
mean that higher level entities are unimportant in evolution.
They are important, but in a different way: as vehicles,
(p. 289)
But this is all that naive group selectionists ever
claimed - that groups are like individuals by virtue of
the adaptive coordination of their parts! Finally, Cronin
(1991) concludes that group selection is unimportant even
in the so-called weak sense:
But group selectionism (weak group selectionism) makes
claims about adaptations, about characteristics that satisfy the
fragmented purposes of all the genes in the group and, what's
more, confer an advantage on that group over other groups.
Croup-level adaptations, then, are a very special case of
emergent properties - so special that it would be rash to
expect them to have played any significant role in evolution.
Of course, the question of what role they have actually played
is an empirical, not a conceptual issue. It is a factual matter
about which adaptations happen to have arisen at levels
higher than organisms, about the extent to which groups and
other higher-level vehicles happen to have been roadworthy.
(p. 290)
Cronin is in the unhappy position of a circus artist who
stands on the backs of two horses, replicators and vehi-
cles, as they gallop around the ring. The only way that she
can perform this dazzling feat is by making the horses
gallop in parallel. Thus, groups must fail not only as
replicators but as vehicles. What Cronin cannot bring
herself to say is that the replicator concept that forms the
inspiration for her book is totally irrelevant to the ques-
tion that is and always was at the heart of the group
selection controversy - can groups be like individuals in
the harmony and coordination of their parts? To answer
this question we must restructure the entire edifice
around the concept of vehicles, not replicators. That is
exactly what the positive literature on group selection
does.7
1.4. Taking vehicles seriously
The essence of the vehicle concept is shared fate, exem-
plified by the adage (and by Dawkins's rowing crew
metaphor) "we're all in the same boat." Our restructured
edifice must first be able to identify the vehicle(s) of
selection in any particular biological or human situation.
In Figure 1, the biological hierarchy is shown as a
METAPOPULATION
GROUP
INDIVIDUAL
GENE
Figure 1. A nested hierarchy in which every unit is a popula-
tion of lower-level units. The hierarchy is left open on both ends
because genes are composed of subunits and metapopulations
can exist in higher-order metapopulations. For example, a valley
can be a metapopulation of villages, which in turn are meta-
populations of kinship groups.
nested series of units, each of which is a population of
lower-level units. An individual can be regarded as a
population of genes and a group is obviously a population
of individuals. A metapopulation is a population of
groups. For example, a single field might contain hun-
dreds of ant colonies. Each colony certainly deserves to
be called a group and yet we must also recognize the
collection of groups as an important entity. The hierarchy
has been left open on both ends because genes are
composed of subunits and metapopulations can exist in
higher-order metapopulations, a fact that will become
important later.
Vehicles of selection can be identified on a trait by trait
basis by the following simple procedure: starting at the
lowest level of the hierarchy,8 ask the question, "Do genes
within a single individual differ in fitness?" If the answer is
"no," then they share the same fate and are part of the
same vehicle. Proceeding up the hierarchy, ask the ques-
tion, "Do individuals within a single group differ in
fitness?" If the answer is "no," then once again they share
the same fate and we must proceed up the hierarchy until
we find the level(s) at which units differ in fitness. This is
the level (or levels) at which natural selection actually
operates, producing the functional organization implicit
in the word "organism."9 Everything below this level will
acquire the status of organs and everything above this
level will be vulnerable to social dilemmas.1()
Already, we can make three fundamental points. First,
focusing on vehicles makes it obvious that the concept of
organism is not invariably linked to the individual level of
the biological hierarchy. To the extent that genes can
differ in fitness within single individuals, the genes will
become the organisms and the individual will become a
dysfunctional collection of genes. To the extent that indi-
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4
591

Wilson & Sober: Group selection
viduals in the same group are in the same "boat" with
respect to fitness, they will evolve into harmonious organs
of group-level organization. In short, the organ-organism-
population trichotomy can be frameshifted both up and
down the biological hierarchy. Frameshifts in both direc-
tions have been documented and examples will be pro-
vided below.
Second, the status of organ versus organism versus
population must be assigned on a trait-by-trait basis. It is
possible for a single creature such as a wasp to be an organ
with respect to some traits, an organism with respect to
other traits, and a population of organisms with respect to
still other traits. This may sound strange but it follows
directly from the fact that fitness is a property of traits, not
organisms (Sober 1984). For example, in the parasitic
wasp Nasonia vitripennis, some males harbor what has
been called the "ultimate" selfish gene, because it de-
stroys all the other genes in the male to facilitate its own
transmission (Werren 1991; Werren & Beukeboom 1992).
In this case, the gene is the vehicle of selection, but most
other genes in the same species evolve by standard
Darwinian selection, in which case the individual is the
vehicle of selection.
Third, fitness differences are not always concentrated
at one level of the biological hierarchy. Individuals with
trait A can be less fit than individuals with trait B within
single groups, whereas groups of individuals with trait A
are more fit than groups of individuals with trait B. In
these cases we cannot assign the status of organ, organ-
ism, or population and must settle for some hybrid desig-
nation. As one example, Williams (1966) snowed that,
given certain assumptions-, natural selection within single
groups favors an even sex ratio whereas natural selection
between groups favors an extreme female-biased sex
ratio. He thought that the absence of female-biased sex
ratios in nature provided conclusive evidence against
group selection. Since then, moderately female-biased
sex ratios have been discovered in literally hundreds of
species; these reflect an equilibrium between opposing
forces of within- and between-group selection (Charnov
1982; Colwell 1981; S. A. Frank 1986b; D. S. Wilson &
Colwell 1981).n As we will show, altruism is another
example of a hybrid trait that is selected against at the
individual level but favored at the group level. We will
now document our claim that the organ-organism-
population trichotomy can be frameshifted both up and
down the biological hierarchy.
1.4.1. Individuals as dysfunctional populations of genetic
elements. Individuals are traditionally viewed as stable
entities that (barring mutation) pass the same genes in the
same proportions to their offspring that they received
from their parents. However, this is not always the case.
For example, a diploid individual can be regarded as a
population of N = 2 alleles at each locus. The rules of
meiosis usually dictate that each allele is equally repre-
sented in the gametes. Occasionally a mutation arises that
"breaks" the rules of meiosis by appearing in more than
50% of the gametes, a phenomenon known as "meiotic
drive" (Crow 1979). These same alleles often reduce the
survival rate of individuals that possess them and can even
be lethal in homozygous form. Let us apply our simple
procedure to this example to identify the vehicle(s) of
selection. Can genes within a single individual differ in
fitness? The answer is "yes" because the driving allele
exists at a frequency of p = 0.5 in heterozygotes, and
occurs in the gametes of those heterozygotes with a
frequency of p > 0.5. Natural selection therefore operates
at the gene level, favoring the driving allele. Now proceed
up the hierarchy. Do individuals within a single popula-
tion differ in fitness? Again, the answer is "yes" because
individuals with the driving allele suffer higher mortality
than individuals without the driving allele. Natural selec-
tion therefore operates against the driving allele at the
individual level. Both the gene and the individual are
vehicles of selection. If gene-level selection is sufficiently
strong, the driving allele can evolve despite its negative
effects on individuals.
Many other examples of natural selection within indi-
viduals could be cited, such as those involving chromo-
somal genes (Dover 1986), cytoplasmic genes (Cosmides
& Tooby 1981), and competing cell lineages (Buss 1987).
These examples have been received with great fanfare by
gene-centered theorists as some sort pf confirmation of
their theory. However, they do not confirm the thesis that
genes are replicators - all genes are replicators by defini-
tion and no documentation is needed. These examples are
remarkable because they show that genes can sometimes
be vehicles. They seem bizarre and disprienting because
they violate our deeply rooted notion that individuals are
organisms. They force us to realize that individuals are at
least occasionally nothing more than groups of genes,
subject to the same social dilemmas as our imaginary
population of rabbits.
Why aren't examples of within-individual selection
more common? Several authors have speculated that the
rules of meiosis and other mechanisms that suppress
evolution within individuals are themselves the product
of natural selection acting at the individual level. Genes
that profit at the expense of other genes within the same
individual are metaphorically referred to as "outlaws"
(Alexander & Borgia 1978) and the regulatory machinery
that evolves to suppress them is referred to as a "parlia-
ment" of genes (Leigh 1977). Ironically, most of the
authors who use these metaphors are reluctant to think of
real parliaments as regulatory machines that reduce fit-
ness differences within groups, thereby concentrating
adaptation at the group level. Gene-dentered theorists
frameshift downward with enthusiasm but they are much
more reluctant to frameshift upward.
1.4.2. Groups as organisms. Social insect colonies have
been regarded as "superorganisms" for centuries. Sterile
castes with division of labor, colony-level thermoregula-
tion, and patterns of information processing that tran-
scend single brains, all suggest intuitively that colonies
are functionally organized units, built out of individ-
ual insects. This interpretation was rejected by gene-
centered theorists, however, who claimed to explain the
social insects without invoking group selection. Their
scorn for the earlier view is illustrated by West-Eberhard
(1981, p. 12; parenthetical comments are hers): "Despite
the logical force of arguments against group (or colony)
selection (e.g., Williams 1966), and the invention of tidy
explanations for collaboration in individual terms, the
supraorganism (colony-level selection) still haunts evolu-
tionary discussions of insect sociality."
Let us apply our simple procedure to locate the vehi-
592
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

Wilson & Sober: Group selection
cle(s) of selection in the social insects. Can genes differ in
fitness within individuals? Yes - the social insects resem-
ble other species in this regard - but the products of
selection at this level are unlikely to enhance colony
function. Can individuals differ in fitness within single
colonies? Yes; as one example, honey bee queens usually
mate with more than one male, leading to multiple
patrilines among the workers. Many insects can detect
genetic similarity using odor cues and it is plausible to
expect workers tending future queens to favor members
of their own patriline. As with evolution within individ-
uals, however, this kind of palace intrigue is more likely to
disrupt colony function than to enhance it (Ratnieks 1988;
Ratnieks & Visscher 1989). We must therefore proceed up
the hierarchy and ask, "Can groups (= colonies) differ in
fitness within a metapopulation?"
Unlike our archipelago of rabbits, in which the meta-
population seemed somewhat contrived, the social in-
sects obviously exist as a population of colonies. Consider
a mutation that is expressed in honeybee workers and
increases the efficiency of the hive, ultimately causing the
queen to produce more reproductive offspring. It is
obvious that this mutation will spread, not by increasing
in frequency within the hive, but by causing hives pos-
sessing the mutation to out-produce other hives. Thus, for
the majority of traits that improve colony function, the
colony is the vehicle of selection and can legitimately be
called an organism. Focusing on vehicles, not replicators,
as the central concept makes West-Eberhard's statement
sound absurd. Notice also that Williams's first argument,
that group-level adaptations require a process of natural
selection at the group level, is correct. But his empirical
claim that group selection is weak and that group-level
adaptations do not exist is just plain wrong in the case of
the eusocial insects — both the process and the product
are manifest. The focus on genes as the "fundamental"
unit of replication merely distracts from the more rele-
vant framework based on vehicles. Fortunately, most
social insect biologists now realize this and once again
regard social insect colonies as "group-level vehicles of
gene survival" (Seeley 1989), at least to the degree that
they evolve by between-colony selection.
Before ending our discussion of the social insects it is
worth asking a question that we will pose later for hu-
mans: what does it mean for a creature such as an ant or a
honeybee, itself an organism in some respects, also to be
part of a group-level organism? A partial answer is pro-
vided by Seeley (1989), whose elegant experiments reveal
the mechanisms of colony-level adaptation. A honeybee
hive monitors its floral resources over several square
miles and maximizes its energy intake with impressive
accuracy. If the quality of a food patch is experimentally
lowered, the hive responds within minutes by shifting
workers away from that patch and toward ones that are
more profitable. Yet individual bees visit only one patch
and have no frame of comparison. Instead, individuals
contribute one link to a chain of events that allows the
comparison to be made at the hive level. Bees returning
from the low quality patch dance less and are themselves
less likely to revisit it. With fewer bees returning from the
poor resource, bees from better patches are able to unload
their nectar faster, which they use as a cue to dance more.
Newly recruited bees are therefore directed to the best
patches. Adaptive foraging is accomplished by a decen-
tralized process in which individuals are more like neurons
than decision-making agents in their own right (Camazine
& Sneyd 1991; see Camazine 1991; Deneubourg & Goss
1989; Franks 1989; E. O. Wilson & Holldobler 1988, for
other examples of group-level cognition in social insects).
The image of a group-level mind composed of relatively
mindless individuals is aptly described in D. Hofstadter's
(1979) essay "Ant Fugue." We suggest that some aspects of
human mentality can also be understood as a form of
group-level cognition (see below).
1.5. Finding the vehicles in Inclusive fitness theory
How was it possible for West-Eberhard and others to
think that the social insects could be explained without
invoking group selection? Her "tidy" alternative explana-
tion was inclusive fitness theory, which she and almost
everyone else regarded as a robust alternative to group
selection. However, inclusive fitness theory is a gene-
centered framework that does not identify the vehicle(s)
of selection. When we rebuild inclusive fitness theory on
the foundation of vehicles we discover that it is not an
alternative to the idea of group selection at all (Michod
1982; Queller 1991; 1992a; Uyenoyama & Feldman
1980b; Wade 1985; D. S. Wilson 1977a; 1980). It would be
hard to imagine a more important discovery, yet human
behavioral scientists are almost totally unaware of it, in
part because their evolutionary informants so assiduously
ignore it. Even the most recent accounts of evolution for
the human sciences treat inclusive fitness and group
selection as separate mechanisms (e.g., Alexander 1987;
1989; 1992; Archer 1991; Daly & Wilson 1988; R. H.
Frank 1988; Krebs 1987; MacDonald 1988b; Noonan
1987). We will consider one of these treatments in detail
because it allows us to make a number of important points
throughout the rest of our paper. Here is R. H. Frank's
(1988) depiction of group selection:
Group-selection models are the favored turf of biologists and
others who feel that people are genuinely altruistic. Many
biologists are skeptical of these models, which reject the
central Darwinian assumption that selection occurs at the
individual level. In his recent text, for example, Trivers
includes a chapter entitled "The group selection fallacy."
With thinly veiled contempt, he defines group selection as
"the differential reproduction of groups, often imagined to
favor traits that are individually disadvantageous but evolve
because they benefit the larger group." Group selectionists
have attempted to show that genuine altruism, as conven-
tionally defined, is just such a trait. . . .
Could altruism have evolved via group selection? For this to
have happened, altruistic groups would have had to prosper
at the expense of less altruistic groups in the competition for
scarce resources. This requirement, by itself, is not problem-
atic. After all, altruism is efficient at the group level (recall
that pairs of cooperators in the prisoner's dilemma do better
than pairs of defectors), and we can imagine ways that altruis-
tic groups might avoid being taken advantage of by less
altruistic groups. . . .
But even if we suppose that the superior performance of the
altruistic group enables it to triumph over all other groups,
the group selection story still faces a formidable hurdle. The
conventional definition again, is that nonaltruistic behavior is
advantageous to the individual. Even in an altruistic group,
not every individual will be equally altruistic. When individ-
uals differ, there will be selection pressure in favor of the least
altruistic members. And as long as these individuals get
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4
593

Wilson & Sober: Group selection
higher payoffs, they will comprise an ever-larger share of the
altruistic group.
So even in the event that a purely altruistic group triumphs
over all other groups, the logic of selection at the individual
level appears to spell ultimate doom for genuinely altruistic
behavior. It can triumph only when the extinction rate of
groups is comparable to the mortality rate for individuals
within them. As [E. O.] Wilson stresses, this condition is
rarely if ever met in practice. (Frank 1988, pp. 37-39)
Frank's account of group selection is accurate and
similar to our own rabbit example. He also accurately
depicts the climate of the group selection debate during
the '60s and 70s. Now here is Frank's (1988) description of
inclusive fitness theory:
Biologists have made numerous attempts to explain behavior
that, on its face, appears self-sacrificing. Many of these make
use of William Hamilton's notion of kin selection. According
to Hamilton, an individual will often be able to promote its
own genetic future by making sacrifices on behalf of others
who carry copies of its genes. . . .
The kin-selection model fits comfortably within the Dar-
winian framework, and has clearly established predictive
power. . . .
Sacrifices made on behalf of kin are an example of what E. O.
Wilson calls 'hard core' altruism, a set of responses relatively
unaffected by social reward or punishment beyond child-
hood." Viewed from one perspective, the behavior accounted
for by the kin-selection model is not really self-sacrificing
behavior at all. When an individual helps a relative, it is
merely helping that part of itself that is embodied in the
relative's genes, (pp. 25-27)
Frank's exposition certainly suggests that group selec-
tion and kin selection are alternative theories that invoke
separate mechanisms. Frank himself regards them as so
different that he calls one non-Darwinian and the other
Darwinian!12 Now consider the model in Figure 2, which
rebuilds inclusive fitness theory on the foundation of
vehicles (see Michod 1982; Queller 1991; 1992a; Sober
1991; Uyenoyama & Feldman 1980b; Wade 1985; D. S.
Wilson 1977a; 1980, for more formal treatments). A domi-
nant allele (A) codes for a behavior that is1 expressed only
among full siblings. The behavior decreases the fitness of
the actor by an amount c and increases the fitness of a
single recipient by an amount b. In Figure 2, adults of the
three genotypes (AA,Aa,aa) combine randomly to form
six types of mating pairs (AA X AA, AA x Aa, AA X aa, Aa
X Aa, Aa X aa, aa X aa). Each mating pair produces
sibling groups with a characteristic proportion of altruists
and nonaltruists. Thus, the sibling groups derived from
AA X AA matings are entirely altruistic, the groups
derived from aa X aa matings are entirely nonaltruistic
and so on. Since the behavior is expressed only among
siblings, the progeny of each mated pair is an isolated
group as far as the expression of the behavior is con-
cerned. Thus, any model of sibling interactions invokes a
metapopulation of sibgroups.
Now let us use our simple procedure to locate the
vehicles of selection. Beginning at the lowest level of the
hierarchy, there is no meiotic drive or other form of
selection within individuals in this example. Moving up
the hierarchy, do individuals within single sibgroups
differ in fitness? Yes, and natural selection at this level
operates against the altruists. In all sibgroups that contain
both selfish (aa) and altruistic (Aa,AA), phenotypes the
former are fitter - they benefit from the latter's help

Figure 2. A vehicle-centered version of kin selection theory. The dominant A-allele codes for an altruistic behavior. The fitness of
altruists (WA) and nonaltruists (Ws) in a given group is WA = 1 - c + b(Np - 1)/(N - 1) and Ws = 1 + bNpl(N <- 1), where p = the
frequency of altruists in the group, N = group size, c = the cost to the altruist, and b = the benefit to the recipient. Both phenotypes
have a baseline fitness of 1. Each altruist can be a recipient for (Np - 1) other altruists in the group (excluding itself) who are
distributing their benefits among (N — 1) members of the group (excluding themselves). Each nonaltruist can be a recipient for all Np
altruists in the group. For this example N = 10, c = 0.3, and b = 1.0. Random mating among the three genotypes (first line) produces
six types of mated pairs (second line), which in turn produce groups of siblings (third line). The third line shows only the average
sibling group for each type of mated pair. Random sampling of the gametes will produce variation around the averages. Sibling groups
vary in the frequency of altruists (fourth line). Altruism is selected against at the individual level because nonaltruists have the highest
fitness within all mixed groups. Altruism is favored at the group level, however, because group fitness is directly proportional to the
frequency of altruists in the group.

BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

Wilson & Sober: Group selection
without sharing the costs. Sibling groups are similar to
other groups in this respect. Continuing up the hierarchy,
can sibgroups differ in fitness within the metapopulation?
Yes, and it is here that we find the evolutionary force that
favors altruism. Since every altruist contributes a net
fitness increment of b-c to the sibgroup, the fitness of the
collective is directly proportional to the number of altru-
ists in the group. Sibgroups with more altruists out-
produce sibgroups with fewer altruists.
The degree of altruism that evolves depends on the
balance of opposing forces at the group and individual
levels. Figure 3 shows why kin groups are more favorable
for the evolution of altruism than groups of unrelated
individuals. In the latter case, groups of size N are drawn
directly from the global population, forming a binomial
distribution of local gene frequencies. In the former case,
groups of size two (the parents) are drawn from the global
population and groups of size N (the siblings) are drawn
from their gametes. This two-step sampling procedure
increases genetic variation among groups, intensifying
natural selection at the group level. Put another way,
altruists are segregated from nonaltruists more in kin
groups than randomly composed groups. In both cases
there are mixed groups, however, and evolution within
mixed groups is the same regardless of whether they are
composed of siblings or nonrelatives. Notice that this
explanation does not invoke the concept of identity by
descent, which seems to be the cornerstone of inclusive
fitness theory. There is no physical difference between
two altruistic genes that are identical by descent and two
altruistic genes that are not. The coefficient of relation-
ship is nothing more than an index of above-random
genetic variation among groups (e.g., Falconer 1981,
Chs. 3-5; Queller 1991; 1992a).
We invite the reader to go back to R. H. Frank's account
of group selection to confirm that it describes exactly the
process of kin selection portrayed in Figure 2. Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde are the same person. The only discrepancy
between Frank's account and Figure 2 involves the con-
cept of extinction. Sibling groups don't last for multiple
generations and don't necessarily go extinct, but rather
dissolve into the larger population when the individuals
become adults and have their own offspring. Thus, sibling
groups (and social insect colonies) differ somewhat from
our population of rabbits and the groups that Frank and
Trivers had in mind. But this does not disqualify sibling
groups as vehicles of selection. After all, individuals are
transient collections of genes that "dissolve" into the gene
pool as gametes. The ephemeral nature of groups in
Figure 2 makes them more similar to individuals, not less.
Frank's account of kin selection appears so different,
not because it invokes a different mechanism for the
evolution of altruism, but because it utilizes a different
accounting procedure for calculating gene frequency
change that does not compare the fitnesses of individuals
within single groups. The method correctly predicts the
degree of altruism that evolves but obscures the internal
dynamics of the process. In fact, when the vehicle-
centered approach was first published, many biologists
who thought they were familiar with inclusive fitness
Figure 3. Variation among groups in the frequency of altruists. Altruism is coded by a dominant A allele at a frequency of p - 0.25 in
the metapopulation, yielding a frequency of 0.438 altruists (AA and Aa) and 0.562 nonaltruists (aa). When groups of N = 10 are
composed of unrelated individuals, the variation in the frequency of altruists between groups has a binomial distribution, as shown by
the black curve. Sibling groups are created by a two-step sampling process in which groups of size N = 2 (the parents) are drawn from
the global population and groups of size N = 10 (the siblings) are drawn from their gametes. This two-step sampling procedure
increases genetic variation between groups, as shown by the stippled curve, intensifying natural selection at the group level.
Evolution within groups always favors the nonaltruist, regardless of whether the groups are composed of siblings or unrelated
individuals.

Wilson & Sober: Group selection
theory found it hard to believe that altruism within kin-
groups is actually selected against and evolves only by a
process of between-group selection.
The unification of group selection and kin selection has
implications for the distinction between "genuine" and
"apparent" altruism. This is an important distinction in
the human behavioral sciences and evolutionary accounts
such as Frank's seem to provide a tidy answer: the altru-
ism that evolves by group selection is genuine because
it entails real self-sacrifice, whereas the altruism that
evolves by kin selection is only apparent because it is just
genes promoting copies of themselves in other individ-
uals. The unified theory reveals that this distinction is an
artifact of the way that fitness is calculated. Any trait that
is selected at the group level can be made to appear
genuinely altruistic by comparing relative fitness within
groups, or only apparently altruistic by averaging fitness
across groups (D. S. Wilson 1992; D. S. Wilson & Du-
gatkin 1992). Thus, evolutionary biologists have so far
contributed little but confusion to the distinction between
genuine and apparent altruism.13
1.6. Finding the vehicles in evolutionary game theory
Evolutionary game theory (also called ESS theory for
"evolutionarily stable strategy") is similar to economic
game theory except that the strategies compete in Dar-
winian fashion, as opposed to being adopted by rational
choice. It was developed to explore the evolution of
cooperation and was universally considered to be an
individual-level alternative to group selection. For exam-
ple, Dawkins (1980) states
There is a common misconception that cooperation within a
group at a given level of organization must come about
through selection between groups. . . . ESS theory provides
a more parsimonious alternative, (p. 360)
We will explore the relationship between game theory
and group selection with a fanciful example that is based
on Dawkins's rowing crew metaphor. A species of cricket
has evolved the peculiar habit of scooting about the water
on dead leaves in search of its resource (water lily flowers).
A leaf can be propelled much better by two crickets than
by one so they scoot about in pairs. Initially they were
quite awkward but natural selection eventually endowed
them with breathtaking morphological and behavioral
adaptations for their task. Especially impressive is the
coordination of the pair. They take their stations on each
side of the leaf and stroke the water with their modified
legs in absolute unison, almost as if they are part of a single
organism. Coordination is facilitated by one member of
the pair, who synchronizes the strokes by chirping at
regular intervals. On closer examination it was discovered
that the chirps not only coordinate movements but also
steer the little craft. A low-pitched chirp causes the
chirper to row harder and a high-pitched chirp causes the
nonchirper to row harder. The captain (as the chirper
came to be called) adjusts its pitch to correct for asymme-
tries in the shape of the leaf and also to change direction as
lily pads hove into view. Either member of the pair can
act as captain; the important thing is that there be only
one.
The evolution of any particular trait in this example can
be examined with a 2-person game theory model. For
example, consider two types of crickets (Al and A2) that
differ in their ability to synchronize with their partner's
movement. If p is the frequency of Al in the population
and if pairing is at random, then three types of pairs exist
(A1A1, A1A2, A2A2) at frequencies of p2, 2p(l - p) and
(1 — p)2. Coordination, and therefore fitness, is directly
proportional to the number of Al individuals in the pair,
as shown by the payoff matrix in Figure 4a. The fitness of
the two types, averaged across pairs, is WA1 = 5p +
4(1 - p) and WA2 = 4p + 3(1 - p).
This is not a very interesting game theory model be-
cause it doesn't pose a dilemma. WAl > WA2 for all values
of p, making it obvious that Al will evolve. However, this
should not obscure a more fundamental point, that the
pair is the vehicle of selection. If we apply our procedure
we find no fitness differences between individuals within
a pair, in which case Al can evolve only by causing pairs to
succeed relative to other pairs. The fact that the pairs are
ephemeral, perhaps lasting only a fraction of an individ-
ual's lifetime, is irrelevant. Persistence is a requirement
for replicators, not vehicles. Coordination evolves among
the individuals for exactly the same reason that it evolves
among genes within individuals, because they are "in the
same boat" as far as fitness differences are concerned.
More generally, evolutionary game theory deploys a
metapopulation model, in which individuals exist within
groups that exist within a population of groups. When
this elementary fact is recognized, Dawkins's statement
quoted earlier makes as little sense as West-Eberhard's
statement about the social insects. Cooperation evolves
by group-level selection in a game theory model as surely
as cooperation among genes evolves by individual-level
selection in a standard population genetics model.14 In
fact, the two models are mathematically identical; we can
go from one to the other merely by relabelling A1 and A2

group selection is absent from the first example by virtue of the
situation, since coordination has an equal effect on both occu-
pants of the leaf. Within-group selection is absent from the

type cannot operate in the presence of the "parliament" A5 type.

BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

Wilson & Sober: Group selection
as "alleles" rather than as "individuals" and calling the pair
a zygote (Hamilton 1971; Holt 1983; Maynard Smith
1987a; 1987b; D. S. Wilson 1983a; 1989; 1990).
Continuing our example, suppose that a mutant type
(A3) arises that rushes onto the lily pad at the moment of
arrival, kicking the boat away and setting its hapless
partner adrift. If both members of the pair are the A3
type, however, they collide and have a probability of
drowning. The pay-off matrix for this situation is shown in
Figure 4b and the average fitness of the two types is WA1
= p(5) + (1 - p)(0) and WA3 = p(10) + (1 - p)(2).
This model is more interesting because it constitutes a
social dilemma. A3 evolves despite the fact that it disrupts
group-level functional organization. Applying our proce-
dure, we find that the nasty behavior is favored by within-
group selection; A3 is fitter than Al within pairs. Cooper-
ation, as before, is favored by between-group selection;
A1A1 and A1A3 pairs are fitter than A3A3 pairs. By
renaming the individuals "alleles" and the pairs "zygotes,"
we have the example of meiotic drive described in section
1.4.1, paragraph 1.
Continuing our example, suppose that a new mutant
(A4) arises that can remember the previous behavior of its
partner. It acts honorably toward new partners and there-
after imitates its partner's previous behavior. This is the
famous "tit-for-tat strategy" (Axelrod & Hamilton 1981)
that can evolve above a threshold frequency, given a
sufficient probability of future interactions (Fig. 4c). Ap-
plying our procedure, we find that natural selection still
favors A3 over A4 within pairs because A4 loses during the
first interaction. A4 reduces but does not eliminate its
fitness disadvantage within groups by changing its behav-
ior and it evolves only because groups of A4A4 outperform
groups of A4A3 and A3A3.15
Finally, suppose that yet another mutant arises (A5)
that grabs hold of its partner with one of its free legs,
preventing it from leaping prematurely onto the lily pad.
The payoff matrix for A5 versus A3 is shown in Figure 4d.
Applying our procedure, we find that fitness differences
within groups have been eliminated while between-
group selection still favors A5A5 and A5A3 over A3A3. A5
is like a dominant allele in the sense that A5A5 and A5A3
groups are phenotypically identical. Within-group selec-
tion has been eliminated by an evolved trait. Once again
the pair has achieved a harmony and coordination that
invites comparison with an organism, but with some
safeguards built in, similar to the rules of fair meiosis at
the genetic level.
How was it possible for Dawkins and virtually all other
evolutionary biologists to regard game theory as an indi-
vidualistic theory that does not require group selection?
The answer is that groups were treated as "environments"
inhabited by individuals, in exactly the same sense that
Williams regarded individuals as "environments" inhab-
ited by genes. Averaging the fitness of individual types
across groups combines selection at all levels into a single
measure of "individual fitness" that correctly predicts the
outcome of natural selection but loses sight of the vehicles
that natural selection actually acts upon. Selection can
operate entirely at the group level (as it does in Figure 4a
and d) and still be represented in terms of individual
fitnesses simply because the average A2 (or A5) is more fit
than the average Al (or A3). This definition of what
"individual selection" favors is synonymous with "any-
thing that evolves, regardless of the vehicles of selection."
Of course, individuals are not replicators and we can
make them disappear along with groups by averaging the
fitness of genes across all contexts, arriving at a definition
of "gene selection" as "anything that evolves, regardless of
the vehicles of selection." These overextended definitions
of individual and gene selection have misled a generation
of biologists into thinking that natural selection almost
never occurs at the level of groups.
In this review we have concentrated on showing how
the seemingly competing theories of kin selection, evolu-
tionary game theory, and group selection have been
united into a single theory of natural selection acting on a
nested hierarchy of units. The unified theory does more
than redescribe the familiar results of kin selection and
game theory, however; it also predicts that natural selec-
tion can operate on units that were never anticipated by
kin selection and game theory, such as multigenerational
groups founded by a few individuals (e.g., Aviles 1993;
D. S. Wilson 1987), large groups of unrelated individuals
(Boyd & Richerson 1985; 1990a; 1990b), and even multi-
species communities (Goodnight 1990a; 1990b; D. S.
Wilson 1976; 1980; 1987). For example, accounts of hu-
man evolution that are based on nepotism and reciprocity
often conclude that prosocial behavior in modern humans
is maladaptive because it is not confined to genetic rela-
tives and is often performed without expectation of return
benefits (e.g., Ruse 1986; but see Alexander 1987). Later
we will argue that these prosocial behaviors can be adap-
tive because group-level vehicles exist that are larger than
the kin groups and very small groups modelled by kin
selection and evolutionary game theory.
We summarize our review of group selection in biology
as follows: Williams's (1966) argument against group se-
lection came in three parts: (a) higher-level adaptations
require higher levels of selection, (b) higher levels of
selection are theoretically possible but unlikely to occur
in nature, (c) the gene is the fundamental unit of selection
because it is a replicator. The third part of this argument is
irrelevant to the question of whether groups can be like
individuals in the harmony and coordination of their
parts. As far as we can tell, all gene-centered theorists
now concede this point (e.g., Dawkins 1982a; 1989;
Grafen 1984; Williams 1992). Taking vehicles seriously
requires more than acknowledging a few cases of group
selection, however; it demands a restructuring of the
entire edifice. It is a mistake to think there is one weak
group-level theory and two strong individual-level theo-
ries to explain the evolution of altruism/cooperation.
Rather, there is one theory of natural selection operating
on a nested hierarchy of units, of which inclusive fitness
and game theory are special cases. When we focus on
vehicles of selection, the empirical claim that constitutes
the second part of Williams's argument disintegrates, but
the first part remains intact. Adaptation at any level of the
biological hierarchy requires a process of natural selection
at that level.
As might be expected from such a radical restructuring,
some biologists who previously regarded group selec-
tion with contempt have found it difficult to accept this
Cinderella-like reversal of fortunes. Thus, a large group of
knowledgeable biologists who are perfectly comfortable
with the hierarchical approach (see Table 1) coexists with
another large group whose members adhere to the earlier
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4
597

Wilson & Sober: Group selection
view. We think that the views of the former group are in
the process of replacing the views of the latter. The
replacement process is painfully slow, however, partly
because the gene-centered view is so thoroughly en-
trenched and partly because the major gene-centered
theorists have been reluctant to acknowledge the conse-
quences of taking vehicles seriously. As one example,
Sterelny and Kitcher (1988) manage to defend the selfish
gene concept without even considering the question of
whether groups can be vehicles of selection.16 We make
these bold statements to provoke a response. If gene-
centered theorists wish to rebut our account, let them
speak in the commentary section that follows this paper.
Otherwise, let the replacement process continue at a
faster pace. All of the major developments that we have
reviewed are over ten years old and it is time for them to
be acknowledged generally.
2. Group selection and human behavior
In his description of honeybee colonies as superorgan-
isms, Seeley (1989) wrote:
. . . larger and more complex vehicles have evidently proved
superior to smaller and simpler vehicles in certain ecological
settings. By virtue of its greater size and mobility and other
traits, a multicellular organism is sometimes a better gene-
survival machine than is a single eukaryotic cell. . . . Like-
wise, the genes inside organisms sometimes fare better when
they reside in an integrated society of organisms rather than
in a single organism because of superior defensive, feeding,
and homeostatic abilities of functionally organized groups, (p.
546)
This statement applies almost as well to humans as to
honeybees. Nevertheless, group-level functional organi-
zation in humans is usually portrayed as a byproduct of
individual self-interest. Even the most recent evolution-
ary accounts of human behavior are based on Williams's
first commandment, and the triumph of "individual selec-
tion" in biology is often used to justify the individualistic
perspective in the human behavioral sciences.
We think that the hierarchical theory of natural selec-
tion leads to a very different conclusion. Individualism in
biology and in the human sciences both fail for the same
reasons. As far as human evolution is concerned, group-
level functional organization is not a "byproduct" of self-
interest in humans any more than it is in honeybees. The
metapopulation structure of human interactions is mani-
fest; individuals live in social groups which themselves
comprise a population of social groups. Even a relatively
small social unit such as a village is a metapopulation of
still smaller groups such as kinship units or coalitions of
unrelated individuals. Genetic variation among human
groups is not as great as among beehives, but, as we will
attempt to show, human cognitive abilities provide other
mechanisms for concentrating natural selection at the
group level, even when the groups are composed of large
numbers of unrelated individuals (see also, Alexander
1987; 1989; Boyd & Richerson 1985,1990a; 1990b; Knauft
1991).
Individualistic accounts of human behavior do not ig-
nore these facts (e.g., Alexander 1979; 1987; 1989; 1992),
but they are able to remain individualistic only by ignor-
ing the concept of vehicles. As soon as we make vehicles
the center of our analysis, group selection emerges as an
important force in human evolution and the functional
organization of human groups can be interpreted at face
value - as adaptations that evolve because groups ex-
pressing the adaptations outcompeted other groups. The
same adaptations can be, and often are', selectively neu-
tral or even disadvantageous within groups. In the follow-
ing sections we will sketch some of the implications of the
hierarchical view for the study of humhn behavior.17
2.1. The new group selection is not a return to naive
group selection
Some biologists have been reluctant to accept group
selection in any form because they fear1 it will encourage
the uncritical thinking of Emerson and others who simply
assumed the existence of higher-level adaptations (e.g.,
Maynard Smith 1987a; 1987b). Behavioral scientists may
share this reluctance because every branch of the human
sciences seems to have thinkers like Emerson (1960) and
Wynne-Edwards (1962; 1986) who treat social groups as
the unit of adaptation, as if individuals and their strivings
scarcely exist. We therefore want to stress, in the strong-
est possible terms, that these views are not supported by
modern group selection theory. Consider the example
within biology of the Gaia hypothesis, (Lovelock 1979),
which portrays the entire planet as a self-regulating or-
ganism. Even a passing knowledge of group selection
theory exposes Gaia as just another ipretty metaphor
because planet-level adaptation would require a process
of between-planet selection (Wilson & Sober 1989). Gran-
diose theories of human societies as organisms would be
correct only if natural selection operated entirely at the
societal level, which no one proposes. The hierarchical
theory's attention to mechanism makes it easy to discredit
such "theories" both in biology and the human sciences.
2.2. Groups are real
Having distanced ourselves from naive group selection,
we want to stress with equal force that it is legitimate to
treat social groups as organisms, to the extent that natural
selection operates at the group level. Williams's first
commandment (Thou shalt not apply the adaptationist
program above the individual level) is fundamentally
wrong. To see this, consider a simplified situation in
which natural selection acts entirely at the individual
level, in which case genes within individuals become
entirely cooperative and individuals within the popula-
tion frequently face conflicts of interest that lead to social
dilemmas. Using the adaptationist program at the indi-
vidual level leads to the celebrated insights that we
discussed at the beginning of this paper. Using the adap-
tationist program at the population 16vel leads to the
errors of naive group selection that Williams so effectively
exposed. But now suppose that someone misleadingly
suggests that we should not use the adaptationist program
at the individual level - that the fitness of individuals is
actually irrelevant to the evolutionary process; it is only
gene-level fitness that counts. This misleading advice
would have us apply the adaptationist program below the
level at which natural selection actually operates.
In a sense, this is just what adopting the genes-eye
view of Williams and Dawkins encourages us to do. Even
they do not take it seriously enough to abandon the
598
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

Wilson & Sober: Group selection
individual's-eye view, however, since they invoke the
equivalence of gene fitness and individual fitness when
the latter are vehicles of selection. In practice, most
biologists pay passing tribute to the gene as the "funda-
mental" unit of selection and think about adaptation at the
individual level as they always have (e.g., Grafen 1984,
quoted in note 4; Maynard Smith 1987a, p. 125). We
submit that evolutionary biologists would be severely
handicapped if they could not ask the simple question,
What would a well adapted individual be like? Yet that is
the very question that is prohibited at the group level by
Williams's first commandment. If commandments are
needed, we suggest the following: Thou shalt not apply
the adaptationist program either above or below the
level(s) at which natural selection operates. This state-
ment avoids both the excesses of naive group selection
and the excesses of naive individual and gene selection
that we have outlined above.
According to Campbell (1993), the human behavioral
sciences are dominated by something very similar to
Williams's first commandment:
Methodological individualism dominates our neighboring
field of economics, much of sociology, and all of psychology's
excursions into organizational theory. This is the dogma that
all human social group processes are to be explained by laws
of individual behavior - that groups and social organizations
have no ontological reality - that where used, references to
organizations, etc. are but convenient summaries of individ-
ual behavior. . . . We must reject methodological individual-
ism as an a priori assumption, make the issue an empirical
one, and take the position that groups, human social organiza-
tions, might be ontologically real, with laws not derivable
from individual psychology. . . . One of my favorite early
papers (Campbell 1958) explicitly sides with that strident
minority of sociologists who assert that "Groups are real!"
even though it finds human organizations "fuzzier" than
stones or white rats. (p. 1)
The hierarchical theory of natural selection provides an
excellent justification for regarding groups as "real."
Groups are real to the extent that they become func-
tionally organized by natural selection at the group level.
However, for traits that evolve by within-group selection,
groups really should be regarded as byproducts of indi-
vidual behavior. Since group selection is seldom the only
force operating on a trait, the hierarchical theory explains
both the reality of groups that Campbell emphasizes and
the genuinely individualistic side of human nature that is
also an essential part of his thinking.18
2.3. Altruism and organism
Group selection is often studied as a mechanism for the
evolution of altruism. We have also seen that groups
become organisms to the extent that natural selection
operates at the group level. Although the concepts of
altruism and organism are closely related, there is also an
important difference. Altruism involves a conflict be-
tween levels of selection. Groups of altruists beat groups
of nonaltruists, but nonaltruists also beat altruists within
groups. As natural selection becomes concentrated at the
group level, converting the group into an organism, the
self-sacrificial component of altruism disappears. In other
words, an object can be an organism without its parts
behaving self-sacrificially.
The distinction between altruism and the interactions
among parts of an organism is illustrated by our fanciful
cricket example. The four payoff matrices in Figure 4
represent (a) pure between-group selection, (b) strong
conflict between levels of selection, (c) weak conflict
between levels of selection, and (d) a return to pure
between-group selection. Within-group selection is ab-
sent from the first example by virtue of the situation, since
coordination has an equal effect on both occupants of the
leaf. Within-group selection is absent from the fourth
example by virtue of an adaptation, since the "outlaw" A3
type cannot operate in the presence of the "parliament"
A5 type.
It might seem that group-level adaptations would be
easiest to recognize in group-level organisms. Ironically,
the opposite is true, at least from the individualistic
perspective. Individualists acknowledge group-level ad-
aptations when they are easily exploited within groups,
but when they are protected, or when exploitation is not
possible by virtue of the situation, group-level adapta-
tions are seen as examples of individual self-interest,
despite the fact that they evolve purely by between-group
selection and result in total within-group coordination.
Payoff matrices such as 4a and 4d are seldom even consid-
ered by game theorists because their outcome is so
obvious. In the absence of fitness differences within
groups, any amount of genetic variation between groups
is sufficient to select for A1 and A5, including the variation
that is caused by random pairing. It is only by adding
within-group selection that we can generate the social
dilemmas that are deemed interesting enough to model.
Al and A5 should not be viewed as examples of self-
interest, however, just because they easily evolve! As we
have seen, groups are the vehicles of selection in these
examples as surely as individuals are the vehicles in
standard Darwinian selection. To call A1 and A5 examples
of self-interest is to place them in the same category as A3,
which evolves by within-group selection and disrupts
group-level organization. Putting it another way, by
lumping together the products of within- and between-
group selection, the individualistic perspective does not
distinguish between the outlaw and the parliament, turn-
ing "self-interest" into a concept that is as empty as it is
universal.
Failure to recognize group-level adaptation in the ab-
sence of altruism extends far beyond game theory. We
present an example from Alexander (1987) in detail, in
part because he is one of the most influential biologists
writing on human evolution. Alexander envisions moral
systems as levelers of reproductive opportunities within
groups:
The tendency in the development of the largest human
groups, although not always consistent, seems to be toward
equality of opportunity for every individual to reproduce
via its own offspring. Because human social groups are
not enormous nuclear families, like social insect colo-
nies . . . competition and conflicts of interest are also diverse
and complex to an unparalleled degree. Hence, I believe,
derives our topic of moral systems. We can ask legitimately
whether or not the trend toward greater leveling of reproduc-
tive opportunities in the largest, most stable human groups
indicates that such groups (nations) are the most difficult to
hold together without the promise or reality of equality of
opportunity, (p. 69)19
Alexander explicitly compares human moral systems to
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4
599

Wilson & Sober: Group selection
the genetic rules of meiosis that eliminate fitness differ-
ences within individuals:
A corollary to reproductive opportunity leveling in humans
may occur through mitosis and meiosis in sexual organisms. It
has generally been overlooked that these very widely studied
processes are so designed as usually to give each gene or other
genetic subunit of the genome . . . the same opportunity as
any other of appearing in the daughter cells. . . . It is not
inappropriate to speculate that the leveling of reproductive
opportunity for intragenomic components - regardless of its
mechanism - is a prerequisite for the remarkable unity of
genomes, (p. 69)
Since the rules of meiosis concentrate natural selection
at the individual level, producing individual-level organ-
isms, moral rules must concentrate natural selection at the
group level, producing group-level organisms - right?
Wrong. Here is Alexander's verdict on group selection:
Finally, many easily made observations on organisms indicate
that selection is most effective below group levels. These
include such things as evidence of conflicts among individuals
within social groups, failure of semelparous organisms (one-
time breeders) to forego reproduction when resources are
scarce, and strong resistance to adopting nonrelatives by
individuals evidently long evolved in social groups. None of
these observations is likely if the individual's interests are
consistently the same as those of the group or if, to put it
differently, allelic survival typically were most affected by
selection at the group level, (p. 37-8)
All of these examples involve altruistic traits that are
highly vulnerable to exploitation within groups. The only
evidence that Alexander will accept for group selection is
extreme self-sacrifice. Somehow, Alexander manages to
combine a strong emphasis on between-group competi-
tion and opportunity leveling within groups with a belief
that group selection can be dismissed and that every-
thing, parliaments and outlaws alike, is a product of self-
interest.20 To make matters worse, Alexander speaks for
the majority of biologists interested in human behavior.
For example, here is Daly and Wilson's (1988) tidy state-
ment about human morality:
If conscience and empathy were impediments to the ad-
vancement of self-interest, then we would have evolved to be
amoral sociopaths. Rather than representing the denial of
self-interest, our moral sensibilities must be intelligible as
means to the end of fitness in the social environment in which
we evolved, (p. 254)
We hope the reader recognizes the familiar pattern of
treating groups as "environments" inhabited by individ-
uals and defining self-interest as "anything that evolves"
without any consideration of vehicles. Alexander, Daly,
and M. Wilson join the anti-group-selection chorus and
then provide dozens of examples of human groups as
vehicles of selection without ever acknowledging what
gene-centered theorists have already conceded - that
group selection is a "vehicle" question.
Alexander's theory of moral systems can be rebuilt on
the foundation of vehicles as follows: human adaptations
can evolve along two major pathways; (a) by increasing the
fitness of individuals relative to others within the same
social group, and (b) by increasing the fitness of social
groups as collectives, relative to other social groups. Both
pathways have been important in the evolution of the
psychological mechanisms that govern human behavior.
Sometimes group selection is important just by virtue of
the situation. For example, the only way to defend a
village might be to build a stockade, which, by its nature,
benefits the collective. We are not surprised to see vil-
lagers building stockades, even when they are genetically
unrelated to each other. We are not surprised when they
coordinate their efforts in ways that invite comparison to a
single organism. Nor do we regard them as especially
morally praiseworthy as they feverishly work to save their
collective skins. But building the stockade is not selfish
just because it is reasonable. Applying our procedure, we
find that the village is the vehicle of selection. We expect
the stockade to be built for the same reason that we expect
Al and A5 to evolve in the game theory models - because
in this particular situation group-level selection is very
strong relative to within-group selection. If we define
behaviors on the basis of fitness effects (as all evolutionists
do), and if we want our terminology to reflect the vehi-
cle^) that natural selection acts upon, we should call
stockade-building groupish, not selfish.,
Many other situations in human life, provide oppor-
tunities for adaptation via the first pathway, by increasing
the fitness of individuals relative to others within the
same social group. Even with our stockade example we
can imagine a temptation to cultivate selfishly one's own
garden or romantic possibilities, as others build the stock-
ade. The use of the word selfish is fully appropriate
here because the individual is the vehicle of selection
whose behaviors tend to disrupt group-level functional
organization.
The balance between levels of selection is not deter-
mined exclusively by the situation, however. Adaptive
human behavior not only reflects the balance between
levels, it can also alter the balance between levels. Moral
sentiments and moral social systems may function as
"rules of meiosis" that often concentrate fitness differ-
ences, and therefore functional organization, at the group
level. This is the core of Alexander's thesis. When stated
in terms of vehicles, however, Alexander's theory ac-
quires a familiar and conventional ring that is absent from
his own account. Moral systems are defined as social
organizations designed to maximize the benefit of the
group as a collective. Immoral behaviors are defined as
behaviors that benefit individuals at the1 expense of other
individuals within the same group. The$e are close to the
concepts of moral and immoral behavior in folk psychol-
ogy.21 The shock value of Alexander's account, in which
the gentle reader is made to face the griiti reality that all is
self-interest, evaporates when we realize that, for Alex-
ander, self-interest is everything that evolves, at all levels
of the biological hierarchy.22 We will return to moral
systems with an empirical example, b,ut first we must
consider the important issue of psychological motivation.
2.4. Psychological selfishness and its alternatives
Dawkins portrays genes as psychologically selfish entities
that manipulate their environment, including the ge-
notypic environment in which they reside, to increase
their own fitness. This image is obviously metaphorical,
allowing Dawkins to use a familiar human reasoning
process to describe the outcome of natural selection. The
metaphor is relatively innocuous beqause there is no
danger that it can be taken literally. No one believes that
genes are intentional systems of any sort, much less
systems motivated by self interest.

Wilson & Sober: Group selection
Frameshifting upward, it is possible to portray individ-
uals as psychologically selfish entities that manipulate
their environment, including the social environment in
which they reside, to increase their own fitness. This
image of "selfish individuals" may also be metaphorical,
but it is more insidious because it can be taken literally. In
other words, it is possible to believe that individuals
really are intentional systems motivated entirely by self-
interest and this is, in fact, the individualistic perspective
that pervades the human sciences.
To distinguish mechanisms from metaphors, it is useful
to think of a psychological motive as a strategy in the
game-theoretic sense, which produces a set of outcomes
when it interacts with itself and with other strategies.
Thus, a psychologically selfish individual (however de-
fined) will be motivated to behave in certain ways with
consequences for itself and others. A psychologically
altruistic individual (however defined) will be motivated
to behave in other ways with a different set of payoffs.
Within an evolutionary framework, the empirical claim
that individuals are motivated entirely by self-interest
must be supported by showing that the psychologically
selfish strategy prevails in competition with all other
strategies.
Psychological motives have seldom been analyzed in
this way (but see Alexander 1987, R. H. Frank 1988); we
suggest that this will be a productive line of inquiry in the
future. We also predict that two general conclusions will
emerge: first, it is extremely unlikely that any single
strategy will prevail against all other strategies. Even the
famous tit-for-tat strategy, which is robust in the narrow
context for Axelrod's (1980a; 1980b) computer tourna-
ments, is vulnerable to a host of other strategies in more
complex and realistic environments (e.g., Boyd & Lor-
berbaum 1987; Dugatkin & Wilson 1991; Feldman &
Thomas 1987; Peck & Feldman 1986). Thus, any mono-
lithic theory of proximate motives is destined to fail,
including the monolithic theory of psychological selfish-
ness. We should expect a diversity of motives in the
human repertoire that is distributed both within and
among individuals.
Second, the very opposite of psychological selfishness
can be highly successful, especially when natural selec-
tion operates at the group level. To see this, consider an
individual who identifies so thoroughly with his group
that he doesn't even consider the possibility of profiting at
the expense of his fellows. This individual will be vulner-
able to exploitation by members of his group who are less
civic-minded. But groups of individuals who think in this
way will probably be superior in competition with other
groups whose members are less civic-minded. It follows
that intense between-group competition will favor psy-
chological mechanisms that blur the distinction between
group and individual welfare, concentrating functional
organization at the group level. Alexander (1988) himself
provides a good example in a review of Richards (1987)
when he describes his own military experience:
In the army in which I served one was schooled so effectively
to serve the welfare of his unit (community?) that not only the
contract altruism that Richards says is inferior to his "pure"
altruism, hut the intent that he requires, both disappear in a
kind of automaticity that ceases to involve any deliberateness,
either in maintenance of the contract signed when drafted or
enlisted, or in explicitly serving the rest of one's unit. (p. 443)
Quibbles about the definition of altruism aside, nothing
more is required to convert a social group into an organ-
ism. Critics may argue that the selfless attitude of a well-
trained soldier is not adopted by individual choice but
imposed by an indoctrination process and reinforced by
sanctions against disloyalty that make it disadvantageous
to cheat. We disagree in two ways. First, individuals are
not always drafted into these groups and often rush to join
them, enthusiastically embracing the doctrine, refraining
from cheating and enforcing the sanctions against others.
Their self-interest is not taken from them but willingly
abandoned. Second, even when imposed, indoctrination
and sanctions are best regarded as group-level rules of
meiosis that reduce the potential for fitness differences
within groups, concentrating functional organization at
the group level. An entity can be an organism without the
parts behaving self-sacrificially(for an evolutionary model
of psychological altruism per se, see R. H. Frank 1988).
Since humans have lived in small groups throughout
their history, it is reasonable to expect the evolution of
psychological mechanisms that cause them easily to be-
come "team players" in competition with other groups.
We do not expect these to be the only motives that guide
human behavior, but rather a module that is facultatively
employed under appropriate conditions. In fact, there is
abundant empirical evidence that humans coalesce into
cooperative teams at the merest suggestion of a meta-
population structure in which groups can compete against
other groups (e.g., Dawes et al., 1988; Hogg & Abrams
1988;Sherifetal. 1961; Tajfel 1981). Members of the same
group often share a feeling of high regard, friendship, and
trust that is based not on any prior experience but merely
on the fact that they are members of the same group.
Exploitation within groups is often avoided even when
opportunities, without any chance of detection, are ex-
perimentally provided (e.g., Caporaeletal. 1989). Group
formation is as spontaneous in children as it is in adults
(e.g., Sherif et al. 1961). These are the earmarks of an
evolved "Darwinian algorithm" (sensu Cosmides &Tooby
1987) that predisposes humans for life in functionally
organized groups. The algorithm appears paradoxical
only when we consider its vulnerability to more selfish
algorithms within groups. The advantages at the group
level are manifest.
It is important to stress that we have not merely
converged on a view that is already well accepted within
the human sciences. Proponents of alternatives to psy-
chological selfishness are better described as an embat-
tled minority who must constantly defend themselves
against a monolithic individualistic world view (e.g., Bat-
son 1991; Campbell 1993; Caporael et al. 1989; Mans-
bridge 1990; Simon 1991). As one example, most econo-
mists assume that individuals act in the interest of the
company that employs them only because the company
pays them enough to make it worthwhile from the stand-
point of the individual's personal utility. According to
Simon (1991), real people who are satisfied with their jobs
do not distinguish between their own and their company's
utility, but rather adopt the company's interest as their
own interest. Even the lowest level employees make
executive decisions that require asking the question,
What is best for the company? and which go far beyond
the actual requirements of the job. In fact, one of the most
effective forms of protest by dissatisfied employees is
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4
601

Wilson & Sober: Group selection
"work to rule," in which people perform their jobs to the
letter and the company comes to a grinding halt. In
modern life, as in ancient times, group-level function
requires individuals who to a significant degree take the
group's goals as their own. This is a radical proposal within
economics, however, and not the majority view.
2.5. Group-level cognition
Goal-oriented behaviors are typically accomplished by a
feedback process that includes the gathering and process-
ing of information. Although the entire process can be
described as intentional (e.g., the wolf tries to catch the
deer), the elements of the process cannot (the neuron
does not try to fire; it merely does fire when stimulated at
enough synapses; Dennett 1981).
We are accustomed to regarding individuals as inten-
tional systems with their own self-contained feedback
processes. Group selection raises another possibility in
which the feedback process is distributed among mem-
bers of the group. We have already provided an example
for honeybee colonies in which individuals behave more
like neurons than intentional agents in their own right.
Similar examples have scarcely been considered for hu-
mans and our main purpose here is to define the question,
rather than to answer it.
Modern governmental and judicial systems are some-
times designed to produce adaptive outcomes at the level
of the whole system but not at the level of the component
individuals. Science is sometimes portrayed as a similar
process that generates knowledge only at the group level
(e.g., Hull 1988c; Kitcher 1993). The invisible hand
metaphor in economics invokes the image of an adaptive
system that organizes itself out of neuronlike compo-
nents, although the metaphor is more often stated as an
ideology than as a testable research program.23
The invisible hand notwithstanding, research on deci-
sion making in small groups reveals a complex process
that does not always yield adaptive solutions (Hendrick
1987a; 1987b). Groups even make decisions that would be
regarded as foolish by every member of the group (Allison
& Messick 1987). This research is important because it
shows that intelligent individuals do not automatically
combine to form intelligent groups. Adaptive decision
making at the small group level may require a highly
specified cognitive division of labor. Since decision mak-
ing has occurred in small groups throughout human
history, it is reasonable to expect "Darwinian algorithms"
that cause individuals to relinquish their capacity to act as
autonomous intentional agents and to adopt a more lim-
ited role in a group-level cognitive structure. The archi-
tecture of group-level cognition might simply take the
form of "leaders" who act as self-contained intentional
agents and "followers" who abide by the decisions of
others. Alternatively, even so-called leaders may be spe-
cialists in a feedback process that is distributed through-
out the group. These questions can only be asked by
recognizing the group as a potentially adaptive entity.
2.6. An example of a human group-level "organism"
We conclude by providing a possible example of extreme
group-level functional organization in humans and the
background conditions that make it possible. The Hut-
terites are a fundamentalist religious sect that originated
in Europe in the sixteenth century and migrated to North
America in the nineteenth century to escape conscrip-
tion. The Hutterites regard themselves as the human
equivalent of a bee colony. They practice community of
goods (no private ownership) and also cultivate a psycho-
logical attitude of extreme selflessness. The ultimate
Hutterite virtue is "Gelassenheit," a wprd that has no
English equivalent, which includes "the grateful accep-
tance of whatever God gives, even suffering and death,
the forsaking of all self-will, all selfishness, all concern for
private property" (Ehrenpreis 1650/1978). Nepotism and
reciprocity, the two principles that most evolutionists use
to explain prosocial behavior in humans, are scorned by
the Hutterites as immoral. Giving must be without regard
to relatedness and without any expectation of return. The
passion for selflessness is more than just sermonizing and
frequently manifests itself in action. For example, Claus
Felbinger's "Confession of Faith" (1560/1978) provides an
eloquent statement that a Hutterite blacksmith gave to
Bavarian authorities, after their efforts to make him recant
had failed and before they executed him for his beliefs.
The extreme selflessness of the Hutterites can be ex-
plained in at least three ways. First, many authors, both
inside and outside of biology, think of culture as a process
that frequently causes humans to behave in ways that are
biologically maladaptive. By this account, the Hutterites
are influenced by (unspecified) cultural forces and their
behavior cannot be explained by any biological theory,
including the theory of group selection.
Second, some evolutionists have tried to explain wide-
spread altruism in humans as a product of manipulation,
in which the putative altruists are essentially duped into
behaving against their own interests for the benefit of the
manipulator (e.g., Dawkins 1982a; 1989). If people can be
fooled into believing that a life of sacrifice will lead to a
pleasant afterlife, for example, then perpetrating that
belief in others becomes an example 0f individual self-
interest. By this account, we might expect some Hut-
terites (such as the leaders) to profit at the expense of their
duped brethren.
Third, it is possible that humans have evolved to will-
ingly engage in selfless behavior whenever it is protected
by a social organization that constitutes a group-level
vehicle of selection. The relatively small group-level
vehicles of kinship groups and cooperating diads are
already well recognized. The hypothe$is we wish to ex-
plore asserts that the Hutterites constitute a less familiar
case in which the vehicle is a relatively large group of
individuals and families that are genetically unrelated to
each other. If this interpretation is correct, then group
selection theory should be able to predict some major
features of Hutterite social organization and ideology,
despite the fact that it is stated in purely religious terms.
In particular, the prediction is that the bee-like behavior
of the Hutterites is promoted by a social organization and
ideology that nearly eliminates the potential for individ-
uals to increase their fitness relative to others within
groups.24 Note that the other two interpretations do not
make the same prediction. If Hutterite society is gov-
erned by independent cultural forces, it is unlikely to
have the specific design features of a group-level vehicle.
602
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

And if selflessness is a product of manipulation, we should
find fitness differences between the puppets and the
puppeteers.
A number of caveats are in order before proceeding.
First, we do not claim to distinguish rigorously among the
above three explanations within the confines of this tar-
get article. The best that we can do is to provide a brief
sketch; this is nevertheless important because it makes
the preceding discussion less abstract and gives an idea
of what a group-level vehicle of selection might look
like in humans. Second, we do not regard the Hutterite
social organization as a direct product of group selection.
Rather, we conjecture that group selection has operated
throughout human history, endowing the human psyche
with the ability to construct and live within group-level
vehicles of the sort exhibited by the Hutterites.25 This
enables us to make another prediction - that the Hut-
terite social organization is not unique but represents a
fairly common type of social organization in ancestral
environments. Otherwise it could not be interpreted as
an evolved adaptation. As one of many possible social
organizations in the human repertoire, this one is pre-
sumably evoked only under appropriate environmental
conditions, thus yielding another set of testable predic-
tions. Third, evolutionary psychologists rely on fitness-
maximizing arguments to explain the human psyche, but
they do not necessarily expect humans to maximize bio-
logical fitness in present day environments. This is be-
cause, to the extent that humans are "programmed" by
natural selection, it: is not to maximize biological fitness
per se but only to achieve the more proximate goals that
led to high fitness in ancestral environments. Thus, we
must focus more on the design features and what they
would have meant in ancestral environments than on the
present day consequences of the design features (Symons
1992). This is a general issue in evolutionary psychology
that applies to the Hutterites as well as any other group.
With these caveats in mind, we will now elaborate the
idea that Hutterite society is a group-level vehicle of
selection. Although their ideology is stated in purely
religious terms, it is clearly designed to suppress behav-
iors that benefit some individuals at the expense of others
within groups:
That is what Jesus means by His parable of the great banquet
and the wedding of the king's son, when the servants were
sent to call all the people together. Why did his anger fall on
those who had been invited first? Because they let their
private, domestic concerns keep them away. Again and again
we see that man with his present nature finds it very hard to
practice true community; true community feeds the poor
every day at breakfast, dinner, and the common supper table.
Men hang on to property like caterpillars to a cabbage leaf.
Self-will and selfishness constantly stand in the way! (Ehren-
preis 1650/1978, pp. 11-12)
Benefitting the group is exalted as highly as selfishness
within groups is reviled:
Where there is no community there is no true love. True love
means growth for the whole organism, whose members are all
interdependent and serve each other. That is the outward
form of the inner working of the Spirit, the organism of the
Body governed by Christ. We see the same thing among the
bees, who all work with equal zeal gathering honey; none of
them hold anything back for selfish needs. They fly hither and
yon with the greatest zeal and live in community together.
Wilson & Sober: Group selection
Not one of them keeps any property for itself. If only we did
not love our property and our own will! If only we loved the
life of poverty as Jesus showed it, if only we loved obedience
to God as much as we love being rich and respected! If only
everybody did not hang on to his own will! Then the truth of
Christ's death would not appear as foolishness. Instead, it
would be the power of God, which saves us. (Ehrenpreis
1650/1978, pp. 12-13)
Thus the Hutterites are as explicit as they can possibly
be that their members should merge themselves into a
group-level organism. They are also explicit about how
group-level functional organization can be accomplished.
In the first place, the Hutterites believe that selfishness is
an innate part of human nature that can never be fully
eradicated:
The sinner lies in all of us; in fact to sin, to be selfish, is our
present inclination. Left to ourselves we shall end up in
damnation, but this does not mean that salvation cannot be
attained. On the contrary, salvation is possible on three
conditions: we live according to the life of Christ; we live in
community; we strive very hard to attain salvation and are
prepared to suffer for our efforts. Christ appeared to save us
from our sinful nature. This nature is not easily abjured but it
can be if we try hard enough, both in the sense of personal
determination and in the sense of collectively living accord-
ing to the Word. (Shenker 1986, p. 73)
If we were to translate this sentiment into evolutionary
language, we would arrive at the claim that within-group
selection has been a powerful (but not lone) force in
human evolution and has stamped itself upon the human
psyche. To the extent that humans are the products of
natural selection, they are inclined to benefit themselves
at the expense of others within their groups whenever it is
evolutionarily advantageous to do so (at least in ancestral
environments). To create a group-level organism, the part
of human nature that has evolved by within-group selec-
tion must be constrained by a social organization that
plays the same functional role as the genetic rules of
meiosis.
The most important ingredient of this social organiza-
tion is evidently a sense of "shared fate":
The community can "hang together" only through the mem-
bers having an identity of fate. In practice this means two
things. Members must identify with the past and (more
important) with the future of the community, such that their
own future and the community's future are one and the same.
We rise and fall together. This is another way of saying we
have unconditional commitment to our community. We do
not say "if the community does or achieves such and such,
then I will stay, otherwise I won't,' since this implies that
there is an individual identity ontologically and morally
distinct from the community's. No true community could
operate successfully or manifest its raison d'etre with such
limiting conditions or separate identities. Identity of fate also
means that members relate to each other in an atmosphere of
mutual trust, i.e. they consider their presence to stem from a
common desire to express their humanity and recognize that
this can only be achieved through mutual effort. Should one
person claim that he has an inherent right to gain for himself
at the expense of others, the entire fabric collapses. Life in
the community presupposes that each will work for the
benefit of others as much as for himself, that no-one will be
egoistic. The moment this assumption is undermined, mutual
suspicion, jealousy and mistrust arise. Not only will people
probably consider themselves silly for being self-righteous
while others are feathering their nest, but operationally the

Wilson & Sober: Group selection
community will have to take a different character (primarily
through the use of coercion) and the entire moral nature of
the community disappears. (Shenker 1986, p. 93)
We could not ask for a stronger correspondence between
the sentiment expressed in this passage and the concept
of vehicles in a group selection model.
One way to establish a sense of shared fate is via
egalitarian social conventions that make it difficult for one
to benefit at the expense of others. Hutterite society is
elaborately organized along these lines. In addition to
practicing community of goods, they discourage individu-
ality of any sort, for example, in the context of personal
appearance and home furnishings. Leaders are elected
democratically and are subject to long probationary pe-
riods before they are given their full authority. The Hut-
terites' passion for fairness is perhaps best illustrated by
the rules that surround the fissioning process. Like a
honeybee colony, Hutterite brotherhoods split when they
attain a large size, with one half remaining at the original
site and the other half moving to a new site that has been
preselected and prepared. In preparation for the split,
the colony is divided into two groups that are equal with
respect to number, age, sex, skills, and personal compati-
bility. The entire colony packs its belongings and one of
the lists is drawn by lottery on the day of the split. The
similarity to the genetic rules of meiosis could hardly be
more complete.
In principle, we might imagine that a psychological
egoist, who thinks only in terms of personal gain, could
decide to become a Hutterite if he became convinced that
the group-level benefits (which he shares) are sufficiently
great and the social conventions are sufficiently strong
that neither he nor anyone else in the group can act as a
freeloader. The Shenker passage just quoted suggests,
however, that an effective group-oriented society cannot
be composed of individuals who are motivated solely by a
calculus of self-interest.26 The external social conventions
that make freeloading difficult are evidently necessary but
not sufficient and must be supplemented by a psychologi-
cal attitude of genuine concern for others; a direct cal-
culus of group-interest rather than self-interest is essen-
tial. Recall that Simon (1991) makes a similar point about
the behavior of individuals in business organizations.
Thus, although we are focusing on the Hutterites, our
discussion is not limited to esoteric communal societies, a
point to which we will return below.
Even with these attitudes and social conventions, how-
ever, selfishness in thought and action cannot be elimi-
nated entirely. The Hutterites, therefore, have a well-
specified procedure for dealing with members who bene-
fit themselves at the expense of others.
The bond of love is kept pure and intact by the correction of
the Holy Spirit. People who are burdened with vices that
spread and corrupt can have no part in it. This harmonious
fellowship excludes any who are not part of the unanimous
spirit. . . . If a man hardens himself in rebellion, the extreme
step of separation is unavoidable. Otherwise the whole com-
munity would be dragged into his sin and become party to
it. . . . The Apostle Paul therefore says, "Drive out the
wicked person from among you."
In the case of minor transgressions, this discipline consists of
simple brotherly admonition. If anyone has acted wrongly
toward another but has not committed a gross sin, a rebuke
and warning is enough. But if a brother or a sister obstinately
resists brotherly correction and helpful advice, then even
these relatively small things have to be brought openly before
the Church. If that brother is ready to listen to the Church
and allow himself to be set straight, the right way to deal with
the situation will be shown. Everything will be cleared up.
But if he persists in his stubbornness an4 refuses to listen
even to the Church, then there is only one answer in this
situation, and that is to cut him off and exclude him. It is
better for someone with a heart full of poison to be cut off than
for the entire Church to be brought into confusion or
blemished.
The whole aim of this order of discipline, however, is not
exclusion but a change of heart. It is not applied for a brother's
ruin, even when he has fallen into flagrant sin, into besmirch-
ing sins of impurity, which make him deeply guilty before
God. For the sake of example and warning, the truth must in
this case be declared openly and brought to light before the
Church. Even then such a brother should hold on to his hope
and his faith. He should not go away and lefrve everything but
should accept and bear what is put upon him by the Church.
He should earnestly repent, no matter how many tears it may
cost him or how much suffering it may involve. At the right
time, when he is repentant, those who are united in the
Church pray for him, and all of Heaven rejoices with them.
After he has shown genuine repentance, he is received back
with great joy in a meeting of the whole Church. They
unanimously intercede for him that his sins need never be
thought of again but are forgiven and removed forever.
(Ehrenpreis 1650/1978, pp. 66-69) 
'
We could not ask for a more explicit awareness of the
freeloader problem and what to do about, it, including the
elements of retaliation and forgiveness that are also part of
the tit-for-tat strategy in diadic interactions. If we were to
translate this passage into evolutionary language, it would
be as follows: altruism can succeed only by segregating
itself from selfishness. Not only does the selfish individual
have the highest fitness within groups, but his mere
presence signifies a population structure that favors
within-group selection, causing others quickly to aban-
don their own altruistic strategy. Fortunately, in face-to-
face groups whose members are intimately familiar with
each other, it is easy to detect overt forms of selfish-
ness and exclude the offender. When ''subversion from
within" can be prevented to this extent, extreme altru-
ism, in both thought and action, becomes evolutionarily
advantageous.
It is remarkable, and crucial for the hypothesis under
consideration, that the willingness of the Hutterites to
sacrifice for others is accompanied by such an elaborate
set of rules that protect self-sacrifice from exploitation
within groups. We suggest that there is a causal relation-
ship here, that humans are inclined to adopt selfless
behavior in social organizations that provide the func-
tional equivalent of the genetic rules of meiosis. Not only
do these social organizations promote Selflessness at the
behavioral level, but they also promote forms of thinking
and feeling that would be classified as non-egoistic in a
psychological sense. After all, what is the advantage of psy-
chological selfishness if the most successful way to behave
is by contributing to group-level functional organization?
It is also crucial for our hypothesis that group-level
functional organization is, in some sense, superior to what
can be accomplished by individuals when they are free to
pursue their own self-interest (recall the Seeley passage
quoted in sect. 2, para. 1). This certainly appears to be the
case for the Hutterites, who do not have to wait for the
hereafter to get their reward. By fostering a selfless

BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

Wilson & Sober: Group selection
attitude towards others and minimizing the potential for
exploitation within groups, they are spectacularly suc-
cessful at the group level. In sixteenth century Europe
they were alternately tolerated and persecuted for their
economic superiority, much like the Jews - another
society that, in its traditional form, is well-organized at
the group level (MacDonald 1994). In present-day Can-
ada, Hutterites thrive in marginal farming habitats with-
out the benefit of modern technology and almost certainly
would displace the non-Hutterite population in the ab-
sence of laws that restrict their expansion. The Hutterites'
success can also be measured in reproductive terms, since
they have the highest birth rate of any known human
society (Cook 1954).27 Finally, Hutterite society is inter-
nally stable, with the majority of young people electing to
remain when given a choice. Were it not for persecution
and legal restrictions imposed by their host nations,
Hutterite colonies would be far more common than they
are now.
Part of our hypothesis is that the Hutterite social
organization is not a unique product of the sixteenth
century but reflects an evolved human potential to con-
struct and live within such group-level vehicles. It might
seem that the Hutterites are such an esoteric society that
our prediction could not possibly be confirmed. On closer
reflection, however, it appears that the functional ele-
ments of Hutterite society that act as group-level rules of
meiosis are repeated in a great many social groups that
place a premium on group-level performance, even
though the ideologies are superficially different and the
purpose of the group can be diametrically opposed to the
goals of the Hutterites (e.g., an elite military group).
Furthermore, according to Knauft (1991), this kind of egali-
tarianism characterizes hunter-gatherer groups whenever
resources are too widely dispersed to allow the develop-
ment of status-based societies (i.e., most human groups
throughout human evolutionary history). The ethic of
"good company" (which is extended to nonkin as well as
kin; see Knauft 1985) and the deemphasized sense of self-
interest that pervades many tribal societies does indeed
resemble the Hutterite's "community" and their denigra-
tion of "self-will."
Another part of our hypothesis is that the human
potential to build and live within group-level vehicles is
facultative and evoked more strongly in some situations
than in others. Group-level vehicles should be most
commonly observed in situations that place a premium on
group-level functional organization, such as extreme
physical environments, extreme persecution, or extreme
intergroup competition. In more benign situations, the
consequences of social dilemmas are not so dysfunctional
and the effort that goes into the maintenance of group-
level vehicles may be correspondingly relaxed.28
Obviously, we have only skimmed the surface of an
enormously complex and poorly understood subject. We
hope we have demonstrated the likelihood, however, that
group selection in humans extends far beyond nepotism
and narrow reciprocity. These two principles cannot ac-
count for the full range of prosocial behaviors in humans,
and evolutionists who rely on them have been forced to
invoke other factors, such as that prosocial behavior
evolved in ancestral groups of closely related individuals
and is maladaptively expressed in modern groups of
unrelated individuals (Ruse 1986), that prosocial behavior
is a form of manipulation whereby some individuals profit
at the expense of others (Dawkins 1982a; 1989), or that
prosocial behavior results from cultural forces that pro-
mote biologically maladaptive behavior (Campbell 1983).
Group selection theory provides a robust alternative:
even large groups of unrelated individuals can be orga-
nized in a way that makes genuinely prosocial behavior
advantageous.
We have emphasized group-level functional organiza-
tion in humans as an antidote to the rampant individual-
ism we see in the human behavioral sciences, but it is not
our goal to replace one caricature with another. Many
human groups are clearly not the "organisms" that we
have described above and must be explained as the
product of conflicting individual interests within the
group. Evolutionary theory has the resources to under-
stand both conflict and cooperation. Only by pursuing
both problems - with the group as well as the individual
as possible units of functional integration - can the human
sciences come to terms with our evolutionary heritage.
3. Conclusions
Maynard Smith's most recent comment on group selec-
tion includes the following passage:
It is . . . perfectly justified to study eyes (or, for that matter,
ribosomes, or foraging behaviors) on the assumption that
these organs adapt organisms for survival and reproduction.
But it would not be justified to study the fighting behavior of
spiders on the assumption that this behavior evolved because
it ensures the survival of the species, or to study the behavior
of earthworms on the assumption that it evolved because it
improves the efficacy of the ecosystem. (Maynard Smith
1987b, p. 147)
Maynard Smith still resists what we think is the most
fundamental implication of natural selection as a hier-
archical process: higher units of the biological hierarchy
can be organisms, in exactly the same sense that individ-
uals are organisms, to the extent that they are vehicles of
selection. Group organisms may be less common than
individual organisms and they may be more vulnerable
than individuals to subversion from within, but this must
not prevent us from recognizing group-level functional
organization where it exists.
As the most facultative species on earth, humans have
the behavioral potential to span the full continuum from
organ to organism, depending on the situations we en-
counter and the social organizations that we build for
ourselves. We often see ourselves as "organs." We some-
times identify ourselves primarily as members of a group
and willingly make sacrifices for the welfare of our group.
We long to be part of something larger than ourselves.
We have a passion for building, maintaining, and abiding
by fair social organizations. The individualistic perspec-
tive seems to make all of this invisible. Because group-
level functional organization can be successful, it is la-
belled selfish, and therefore no different from the kinds
of behaviors that succeed by disrupting group-level func-
tional organization. But this is just a conjurer's trick.
There are compelling intellectual and practical reasons
to distinguish between behaviors that succeed by con-
tributing to group-level organization and behaviors that
succeed by disrupting group-level organization. That is
what the words "selfish" and "unselfish," "moral" and
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

"immoral" are all about in everyday language. Human
behavioral scientists need to focus on these ancient con-
cerns rather than obscuring them with overextended
definitions of "self-interest." A concern for within-group
versus between-group processes characterizes the human
mind and should characterize the study of the human
mind as well.

NOTES
1. In this target article we use the word "individual" to refer
to a single flesh-and-blood creature, such as a bird or a butterfly.
We use the term "organism" to refer to any biological entity
whose parts have evolved to function in a harmonious and
coordinated fashion.
2. The purpose of this table is to provide a reasonably com-
plete guide to the modern literature on group selection. A
number of controversies exist within this literature that are
beyond the scope of this target article. For completeness we
provide references for all sides of these controversies, including
those with which we disagree. The philosophical literature on
levels of selection has recently been reviewed by Sober and
Wilson (1994).
3. Williams was only one of many biologists who reacted
against group selection during the 1960s, especially in response
to Wynne-Edward's (1962) Animal dispersion in relation to
social behavior. We do not mean to imply that Williams was the
only articulate critic, but he has become the icon for the
individualistic perspective in biology.
4. Dawkins (1982a; 1989) acknowledges that the group selec-
tion controversy is a "vehicle" question but asserts that groups
are almost never vehicles of selection, with the possible excep-
tion of the eusocial insects. Dawkins (1989, pp. 297-98), and
Cronin (1991, p. 290) cite Grafen (1984) as the authoritative
critique of group selection, but Grafen's treatment of groups as
vehicles consists of a single parenthetical statement (p. 76):
"(The organismal approach suggested here is not in conflict with
the 'gene selectionism' of Dawkins [1982a; 1982b]. In his lan-
guage, we are saying that the individual is usually a well-adapted
vehicle for gene replication, while groups are usually not.)"
Williams (1986, p. 8) states that "Selection at any level above the
family (group selection in a broad sense) is unimportant for the
origin and maintenance of adaptation. I reach this conclusion by
simple inspection." More recently, Williams (1992) has acknowl-
edged that groups are vehicles in the specific cases of eusocial
insects and female-biased sex ratio, but he has not generalized to
other cases.
5. Cronin's (1991) The ant and the peacock belongs to the
same genre as Dawkins's (1976) The selfish gene and Gould's
(1989) Wonderful life in which the author attempts to make the
subject accessible to a popular audience without sacrificing
scholarship. As Gould (1989, p. 16) put it, "we can still have a
genre of scientific books suitable for and accessible alike to
professionals and interested laypeople." Because these books
are so accessible, they tend to be influential even among
academic audiences, which is why Cronin's (1991) work merits
criticism despite its status as a "popular" book. Similar views can
be found in the more technical gene-centered literature (see
references in note 4).
6. Gould (1992) criticizes Cronin's gene-centered approach
and advocates a hierarchical view of evolution. However, he
accepts the gene-centered framework for the evolution of altru-
ism and does not invoke the concept of vehicles in the same
sense that we do. More generally, the concept of "species
selection" that Gould emphasizes is somewhat different from
the concept of group selection that we review here (for a
discussion of the difference, see Sober 1984). This constitutes
one of the controversies within the group selection literature
mentioned in note 1.
7. The term "unit of selection" has become ambiguous be-
cause it refers to both replicators and vehicles, depending on the
author. Within the group selection literature, "unit" equals
"vehicle" and no word is required for "replicator" because it is
(and always was) assumed that natural selection at all levels
results in gene-frequency change. We prefer the word "unit" but
use the word "vehicle" in this paper to distinguish it from
replicator and also to force gene-centered theorists to acknowl-
edge the implications of their own framewbrk.
8. We start at the lowest level and work up the hierarchy for
convenience, not because it is required for the procedure. Also,
unless there is uncertainty as to where fitness differences are
occurring, it is not necessary to invoke Williams's (1966) concept
of parsimony in this procedure. 
<
9. Even though organisms are defined on the basis of func-
tional coordination among their parts, functional coordination
per se does not enter into our definition of vehicles, which is
based purely on shared fate. This is because shared fate is the
crucial property of the process of natural selection; functional
coordination among the parts is a product of the process.
10. The procedure for identifying vehicles requires some
precautions that can be illustrated by the following examples.
First, imagine that tall individuals are fitter than short individ-
uals regardless of how they are structured into groups. The
procedure will (correctly) identify the individual as the vehicle
of selection. Nevertheless, groups that contain more tall indi-
viduals than other groups will be more productive, suggesting
(incorrectly) that groups are also vehicles of selection. To resolve
this difficulty we must imagine placing all individuals in a single
group. Tall individuals are still fittest, demonstrating that the
metapopulation structure is irrelevant. Asj a second example,
imagine that the fitness of everyone in 9 group is directly
proportional to the average height of the grpup. Our procedure
(correctly) identifies the group as the vehicle of selection be-
cause there are no fitness differences between individuals
within groups. To confirm this result, imagine placing all indi-
viduals in the same group. The fitness of tall and short individ-
uals is identical, demonstrating that the metapopulation struc-
ture is necessary for tallness to evolve (Sober 1984; see also,
Goodnight et al. 1992; Heisler & Damuth 1987; Walton 1991).
Another problem arises when a trait has already evolved to
fixation. To apply the procedure we must conduct a thought
experiment (or a real experiment) in which alternative types are
present. Although other refinements in our procedure may be
needed, these do not require discussion in the present context.
11. Although female-biased sex ratios evolve by group selec-
tion, they cannot be used to assess the importance of group
selection in the evolution of other traits. In other words, it does
not follow that group selection can be ignored for species that
have an even sex ratio. This is because the metapopulation
structure must be defined separately for each trait (hence the
term "trait group"; see D. S. Wilson 1975; 1977a; 1980). The trait
group for sex ratio must persist long enough for/2 progeny to
mate within the group before dispersing, a constraint that does
not necessarily apply to other traits.
12. For most evolutionists, the ultimate rejection is to be
labelled "non-Darwinian." In fact, Darwin's (1871) theory for
the evolution of human moral sentiments is remarkably similar
to the vehicle-based framework that we develop here (Richards
1987).
13. We think that an evolutionary theory of genuine versus
apparent psychological altruism is possible, but it must be based
on the proximate motivations of the actor^ which evolutionary
accounts ignore by defining altruism and selfishness solely in
terms of fitness effects. In other words, we must ask questions
such as, When are the behaviors motivated by a "genuinely"
606
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

Wilson & Sober: Group selection
psychologically altruistic individual more fit than the behaviors
motivated by an "apparently" altruistic individual? Frank is
actually one of the few authors who are asking these questions,
so we are not criticizing his specific proposals about emotions as
commitment devices, which make more sense within a vehicle-
based framework than within a replicator-based framework. For
further discussion, see D. S. Wilson (1992) and Sober (in press).
14. R. H. Frank (1988) anticipates this conclusion in the
passage we quote (sect. 1.5, para. 2), but does not pursue it
further.
15. Anatol Rapoport, who submitted the tit-for-tat strategy to
Axelrod's (1980a; 1980b) computer tournaments, always appre-
ciated its group-level benefit and individual-level disadvantage
(e.g., Rapoport 1991). In contrast, Axelrod and the majority of
evolutionary game theorists regard tit-for-tat as a strategy that
succeeds "at the individual level."
16. Sterelny and Kitcher (1988) recognize that Dawkins's
position cannot simply be the empty truism that evolution
occurs when the genetic composition of a population changes.
They claim (p. 340) that the nontrivial thesis that Dawkins
advances is that "evolution under natural selection is thus a
process in which, barring complications, the average ability of
the genes in the gene pool to leave copies of themselves
increases with time."
Although this is a nontrivial claim, it is not something we find
in Dawkins's writings, and in any case it isn't true as a generality.
The average fitness of the alleles at a locus increases under
frequency-independent selection. But when a truly selfish gene
replaces an altruistic allele, the effect is to reduce average
fitness. Dawkins frequently remarks that there is nothing to
prevent natural selection (meaning within-group selection) from
driving a population straight to extinction. It is also worth noting
that group selection can lead the average fitness of the selected
alleles to increase. A gene's ability to leave copies of itself can
decline under selection, as well as increase. And which turns out
to occur is a separate issue from whether group selection is
present or absent.
17. Just as group selection has been a controversial topic
within biology, the entire subject of evolution has been a
controversial topic when applied to human behavior. There are
at least three ways that evolution in general (and group selection
in particular) can influence human behavior. First, the psycho-
logical mechanisms that govern human behavior can be the
product of natural selection. In its weak form this statement is
uncontroversial, since everyone agrees that basic drives such as
hunger, sex, and pain exist because they are biologically adap-
tive. Some psychologists believe that the adaptationist program
can be used to explain the architecture of human cognition in
much greater detail, however, and this position is more contro-
versial (e.g., Barkow et al. 1992). Second, cultural change can
itself be described as an evolutionary process with between- and
within-group components (e.g., Boyd & Richerson 1985; Find-
lay 1992). Third, genetic evolution is an ongoing process that can
partially explain differences between individuals and popula-
tions. Our own thinking is based primarily on the first and
second influences. In other words, we think it is imperative to
explore the hypothesis that group selection was a strong force
during human evolution, resulting in proximate psychological
mechanisms that are today universally shared and that allow
humans to facultatively adopt group-level adaptations under
appropriate conditions. The specific nature and precision of
these psychological mechanisms are empirical issues. We also
propose, along with Boyd and Richerson (1985) and Findlay
(1992), that group selection can be a strong force in cultural
evolution. Thus, our position is compatable with, but does not
require, a strong form of human sociobiology. Our point is not to
prejudge the correctness of adaptationist explanations, but to
urge the importance of asking adaptationist questions. Only by
doing so can we find out whether and to what degree organisms
are well adapted to their environments (Orzack & Sober 1994).
18. Sober (1981) discusses the relationship between meth-
odological individualism and the units of selection controversy
in more detail.
19. Opportunity levelling is not restricted to the largest
human groups. According to Knauft (1991), the simplest human
societies are highly egalitarian and overtly status-oriented soci-
eties require a concentrated and stable resource, such as crops
or livestock. This improves Alexander's general thesis, espe-
cially if the simplest existing human societies represent ances-
tral conditions.
20. Alexander's views on group selection, presented in arti-
cles and books from 1974 to 1993, are difficult to represent in a
single passage. When evaluating group selection in nonhuman
species, Alexander identifies strongly with the views of Williams
and Dawkins, as the passage quoted in section 1.2, paragraph 7
shows. Alexander does speculate that humans may be an excep-
tion to the rule because of extreme between-group competition
and regulation of fitness differences within groups. The follow-
ing passage illustrates his pro-group selection side, which is
consistent with our own interpretation: "In sexually reproduc-
ing organisms, such as humans, confluences of interest within
groups are likely to occur when different groups are in more or
less direct competition. As a result, the kind of selection alluded
to here [group selection] would be expected to produce individ-
uals that would cooperate intensively and complexly within
groups but show strong and even extreme aggressiveness be-
tween groups (Alexander 1989, p. 463). However, in other
passages, Alexander clearly minimizes the importance of group
selection and attributes the evolution of moral behavior in
humans to within-group processes. We provide his most recent
statement to this effect: "Because selection is primarily effective
at and below the individual level, it is reasonable to expect
concepts and practices pertaining to morality - as with all other
aspects of the phenotypes of living forms - to be designed so as
to yield reproductive (genetic) gains to the individuals exhibit-
ing them, at least in the environments of history" (Alexander
1993, p. 178).
At a more technical level, Alexander occasionally seems to
appreciate the vehicle concept when evaluating levels of selec-
tion (e.g., the 1989 passage quoted above), but more often he
implicitly defines anything that evolves as "individually' advan-
tageous, even when the group is the vehicle of selection (e.g.,
Alexander's 1993 discussion of R. H. Frank [1988]). We think
that a consistent application of our procedure will reveal that
Alexander is invoking groups as vehicles of selection much
more than he acknowledges in his own writing. We also want to
stress, however, that Alexander's views on indirect reciprocity,
opportunity-leveling within groups, and competition between
groups remain important within a vehicle-based framework.
21. Alexander's theory is conventional in the sense of equat-
ing morality with the notion of a common good. However,
calling it familiar and conventional does not belittle its impor-
tance. Evolutionary theories of human behavior frequently
make predictions that correspond closely to folk psychology
(e.g., that men tend to value youth in women more than women
value youth in men; see Buss: "Sex Differences in Human Mate
Preferences" BBS 12 (1) 1989; Kenrick & Keefe: "Age Prefer-
ences in Mates Reflect Sex Differences in Human Reproductive
Strategies" BBS 15 (1) 1992). Since the intuitions of folk psychol-
ogy are unlikely to be completely wrong, it would be disturbing
if an evolutionary theory of human behavior were not familiar
and conventional in some sense. Of course, the theory must also
go beyond folk psychology by making counterintuitive predic-
tions, revealing aspects of folk psychology that are false, refining
familiar predictions, subjecting predictions to empirical test,
and so on.
An evolutionary account of morality (including Alexander's)
does depart from folk psychology in some important respects.
The organ-organism-population trichotomy implies that there
will always be a level of the biological hierarchy at which social
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

Commentary/Wilson & Sober: Group selection
dilemmas will prevail. In other words, moral behavior within
groups will frequently be used to generate immoral behavior
between groups. This fits well with observed behavior but
contrasts with the concept of universal morality that is common
in folk psychology and some branches of the human behavioral
sciences (e.g., the higher stages of Kohlberg's [1984] theory of
moral development; MacDonald 1988b). In addition, if moral
systems function as group-level rules of meiosis, it becomes
difficult to explain the concept of individual rights, which are
moral rules that protect individuals from groups. We think that
an evolutionary account of morality may ultimately shed light on
these topics but it will need to be more sophisticated than
current accounts.
22. We provide Alexander's most recent statement that hu-
mans are motivated entirely by self-interest: "It is not easy for
anyone to believe, from his own thoughts about his personal
motivation and that of other humans, that humans are designed
by natural selection to seek their own interests, let alone
maximize their own genetic reproduction" (Alexander 1993,
pp. 191-92).
23. The invisible hand metaphor is the economic equivalent
of the Gaia hypothesis. More generally, despite its emphasis on
individual self-interest, economic theory is like naive group
selection in its axiomatic belief that multi-individual firms maxi-
mize a collective utility. A more sophisticated hierarchical ap-
proach to economics, along the lines of Campbell (1993),
Leibenstein (1976), Margolis (1982), and Simon (1991) will be
highly interesting.
24. The sense in which we expect an absence of fitness
differences within groups needs to be clarified. In honeybee
colonies, there is a set of adaptations that is favored by within-
colony selection and has the potential of disrupting colony
function. This includes workers laying unfertilized eggs to
produce sons and workers favoring their own patriline while
tending future queens. These behaviors are seldom observed
because of evolved adaptations that prevent them, which qualify
as group-level rules of meiosis (Ratnieks 1988). Another set of
adaptations is favored by within-colony selection but does not
disrupt colony function. For example, a beneficial mutation that
increases viability will cause patrilines that have this mutation to
be more fit than patrilines that don't, but there is no reason to
expect these kinds of fitness differences to be suppressed by
group-level rules of meiosis. Similarly, we expect the Hutterite
social organization to suppress fitness differences that corre-
spond to the first set but not those that correspond to the second.
25. Here we are following Tooby and Cosmides' (1992) con-
cept of modularity, according to which natural selection has
evolved a number of cognitive subsystems that are evoked by
appropriate environmental conditions. We do not however,
mean to exclude the possibility of open-ended learning and
cultural evolution, as envisioned by other evolutionary psy-
chologists (e.g., Boyd & Richerson 1985; Durham 1991; Mac-
Donald 1991).
26. Two caveats are in order here. First, people do not
necessarily think the way an ideology exhorts them to think. We
believe it plausible that Shenker (who was himself an Israeli
kibbutznik) is not simply espousing an ideology but is accurately
describing the attitudes and beliefs that exist among members of
communal societies. Second, psychological egoism can be de-
fined in many ways and some of the broadest definitions would
include the attitudes and beliefs expressed in the Shenker
passage. For example, if a Hutterite takes genuine pleasure in
helping his group, he might be classified by some as a psycho-
logical egoist who is attempting to maximize his pleasure. For
the purposes of this discussion, we define a psychological egoist
as a person who has a category of "self" that is separate from the
category of "others," who acts to maximize perceived self-
interest without regard to effects on others, and who does not
axiomatically find pleasure in helping others. See Batson (1991)
for more detailed discussions of psychological egoism.
27. Although the evaluation of psychological adaptations
should be based on design features and their reproductive
consequences in ancestral environments, it is;still interesting to
examine the reproductive consequences in modern environ-
ments. The Hutterites have been quite well studied demo-
graphically and it should be possible to measure actual fitness
differentials within groups.
28. In addition to the environmental situations that we have
listed, unstable equilibria leading to majority effects are likely to
be important in the evolution and maintenance of group-level
adaptations. In other words, group-level adaptations may have
difficulty evolving from a low frequency even when they are
favored by environmental conditions. Conversely, after they
have become established, group-level adaptations may persist
even after the environmental conditions that favored them are
relaxed (Boyd & Richerson 1990a).

Driving both ways: Wilson & Sober's
conflicting criteria for the identification
of groups as vehicles of selection

Abstract: We argue, first, that the notion of group selection discussed in
Wilson & Sober's target article is much stronger than that in Sober
(1984). Next, we show that the authors are tacitly using two indepen-
dent criteria in applying this notion, a "differential fitness" criterion and
a "shared fate" criterion. These criteria are flawed and cannot be ap-
plied jointly to the cases Wilson & Sober describe without creating
inconsistencies.
We will focus here on Wilson & Sober's (W & S's) specifically
biological claims. If W & S's vision of group selection in biology
is as deeply flawed as we will argue, the details of their argu-
ments with respect to sociobiology are fully beside the point.
W & S base their ideas about group selection on the "vehicles
of selection "concept, that is, Hull's (1981) notion of evolutionary
"interactors." We will attempt to extract a precise notion of
"vehicle" from their account. Our main points will be that W & S
are committed to this notion; that there are two completely
independent interpretations of it; and that each interpretation is
appropriate for at least one of their major examples. Further-
more, if W & S wish to distinguish group selection from kin
selection or evolutionary game theory on the one hand, and from
fanciful Gaia hypotheses on the other, both interpretations are
indispensable. Since they yield different results, however, this
duality makes it impossible for W & S to make any generaliza-
tions about the status of group selection theory in biology or its
potential applications to sociobiology.
Our first task is to show that W & S go beyond a "weak"
formulation of group selection, one that was outlined coherently
in earlier work by Sober (1984, p. 314): "group selection oc-
curs . . . exactly when there exists some property P such that
608
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

(1) Groups vary with respect to whether they have P, and (2)
There is a common causal influence on those groups that makes
it the case that (3) Being in a group that has P is a positive causal
factor in the survival and reproduction of organisms." In other
words, group selection occurs whenever individual fate is af-
fected in any way by group membership for any reasons that are
causally interpretable.
The main evidence that W & S have abandoned this "weak"
definition is provided by their repeated use of a "simple proce-
dure" for identifying "vehicles," that of "frameshifting" among
levels of the biological hierarchy.
Starting at the lowest level of the hierarchy, ask the question "Do
genes within a single individual differ in fitness?" If the answer is
"no," then they share the same fate and are part of the same vehicle.
Proceeding up the hierarchy, ask the question "Do individuals within
a single group differ in fitness?" If the answer is "no," then once again
they share the same fate and we must proceed up the hierarchy until
we find the level(s) at which units differ in fitness. This is the level (or
levels) at which natural selection actually operates, producing the
functional organization implicit in the word "organism." (sect. 1.4)
Frameshifting requires an important assumption: selection oc-
curs at a level if and only if entities at that level differ in their
"fitness." There is no question that this is what W & S mean
because they use the term "fitness" repeatedly in each discus-
sion of frameshifting.
Can the above procedure be derived from Sober's "weak"
definition? We can see no clear relationship between the re-
quirements that group membership influence individual fitness
and that groups themselves differ in their fitnesses. Instead, we
see two rather different interpretations, each implying that
much stronger conditions are necessary for group selection. The
first is relatively straightforward, and is in fact the first to be
discussed by W & S. Groups are treated as "individuals" with
well-defined "births," "deaths," and "descendants" that inherit
characteristics. The second interpretation, to be discussed
shortly, focuses on W & S's suggestion that individual members
of a population subject to group selection "share the same fate."
Beyond any purely suggestive "functional organization im-
plicit in the word organism," why must we treat groups as
individuals with organism-like properties? We need only reflect
on the role of fitness in W & S's vehicle-identifying procedure.
At each level of the procedure, the candidate vehicle must
minimally be the sort of thing to which fitness can be ascribed.
In turn, fitness must be cashed out in terms of reproductive
success, which requires that the entity in question (in this case, a
group) be capable of reproduction. In other words, a group must
be like an individual organism in having "births," "descen-
dants," and the like.
The first two important cases discussed by W & S both accord
well with this interpretation. In the hypothetical case of island-
dwelling rabbits, island colonization = birth; colony extinction
= death; new colonies produced by dispersal among islands =
descendants; and colonies can inherit gene frequencies from
their ancestors. Similar equivalences apply in the case of social
insects.
If W & S were content to define group selection as a result of
the differential reproduction of groups, they would be hard-
pressed to argue for group selection in numerous cases where
one or another criterion for group-level reproduction is not met.
In fact, at first glance, few of these conditions seem to be met by
the "groups' dealt with by evolutionary game theorists. This is a
serious problem because W & S feel compelled to show that
inclusive fitness and evolutionary game theory merely describe
special cases of group selection. This claim does in fact follow
easily from Sobers earlier "weak' notion of group selection, but
we will argue that it does not follow at all from the "differential
fitness" criterion.
A good example of the kind of group that might be of interest
to an evolutionary game theorist is that of sibgroups. W & S
claim that "sibgroups with more altruists outproduce sibgroups
Commentary 
/Wilson & Sober: Group selection
with fewer altruists" (sect. 1.5). However, there is no clear sense
in which sibgroups "reproduce." This is because no particular
sibgroup in a preceding generation can be identified as the
"ancestor" of any succeeding sibgroup. W & S disavow "identity
by descent" as a necessary condition for selection, but this has no
bearing on the issue of whether patterns of descent can be traced
from one group-level "generation" to the next, which seems to
us like a minimal requirement for defining reproduction.
W & S do seem aware of this problem. Consider their
dismissal of the "only discrepancy" between kin selection and
group selection accounts in the case of sibling groups, which
"involves the concept of extinction":
Sibling groups don't last for multiple generations and don't neces-
sarily go extinct, but rather dissolve into the larger population when
the individuals become adults and have their own offspring. Thus,
sibling groups (and social insect colonies) differ somewhat from our
population of rabbits and the groups that Frank and Trivers had in
mind. But this does not disqualify sibling groups as vehicles of
selection. After all, individuals are transient collections of genes that
"dissolve" into the gene pool as gametes, (sect. 1.5)
But when we consider the analogy more carefully, it appears
highly misleading. Individuals are collections of genes, just as
sibgroups are collections of individuals. However, the produc-
tion of gametes by diploid individuals does not involve a shift
among levels analogous to the dissolution of sibgroups because
gametes, as haploid individuals, are at exactly the same organi-
zational level as their diploid parents. Calling haploid individ-
uals "gametes' does not transform them somehow into loose
federations of independently selected genes. Instead, the
ancestor-descendant relationships among "individuals" (dip-
loids), "gametes" (haploids), and the resulting second-generation
"individuals" are crystal clear, because all of these entities are at
the same level.
Sibgroups are not the only example cited by W & S that fails to
meet the differential fitness notion of groups as individuals. The
"cricket boatmen" example also concerns "ephemeral" groups.
W & S claim that "persistence is a requirement for replicators,
not vehicles," (sect. 1.6) but the important sense in which these
groups are ephemeral is once again that they are incapable of
participating in specific ancestor-descendant relationships. Un-
like organisms in which diploid individuals directly produce
haploid individuals and vice versa, the cricket boats "produce" a
population of surviving crickets that itself produces a new
generation of crickets, which only then is organized into new
cricket boats.
To deal with the inadequacy of the differential fitness criterion
in cases like these, W & S implicitly shift to what we consider a
second, discrete interpretation of their own vehicle-identifying
procedure: if individuals have a "shared fate" with respect to
survival and reproduction, the groups they form are vehicles of
selection. Of course, if shared fate really was just an epi-
phenomenon of differential fitness, we could conclude imme-
diately that frameshifting just does not work on examples drawn
from evolutionary game theory, invalidating W & S's entire
thesis. There is good evidence for this claim, because the
authors repeatedly argue that if there is any differential fitness
at, say, the level of individuals within groups, there must be
both a sharing of fate and selection at the individual level.
One is tempted to conclude that, for W & S, shared fate is the
true necessary and sufficient condition for group selection, and
talk of differential fitness is mere window-dressing. This would
be extremely convenient. Consider the example of the cricket
boats, which has just been shown not to be interpretable in
terms of differential fitness. In the simple case of fully cooperat-
ing cricket diads, individual survival (and implicitly fitness) is
entirely determined by the success or failure of a boat's efforts
to find lily pads. There could be no more unambiguous case of
shared fate, which presumably explains why W & S are eager to
say that examples like this prove that evolutionary game theory
is a special case of group selection.

Commentary /Wilson & Sober: Group selection
Unfortunately, the notion of shared fate does not appear to
apply nearly as strongly to W & S's earlier examples of rabbits
and social insects as it does to cooperating cricket boatmen.
When an island colony of rabbits reproduces by dispersal to a
new island, only a distinct subset of the colony's rabbits become
founders of the new population, and even within that subset
fitnesses differ. Hence, the "shared fate' requirement appears
to be weakened in not one but two different ways: individual
rabbits differ in their chances of belonging to the founder group
and in their reproductive success relative to other founders.
Social insects are exactly the same because the vast majority of
genetically distinct individuals are nonreproducing workers.
The easiest way to account for this discrepancy would be to
reinterpret the shared fate criterion as nothing more than a
euphemism for Sober's (1984) definition of group selection as
any selection process in which group membership influences
individual fitness, but this cannot be W & S's intention, given
their reliance on the frameshifting paradigm. Alternatively,
W & S might try to show that the fitnesses of individual rabbits
or insects really are more or less equal by retreating to an
argument based on inclusive fitness accounting. However, the
sharing of fate within groups would then be described in terms
of kin selection - not the other way around!
We have shown that the shared fate criterion must be very
weak if it is to apply to cases like that of the rabbits. Nonetheless,
W & S need it to claim that group selection is occurring in cases
like that of the cricket boatmen, where the differential fitness
concept does not apply because the groups do not reproduce in a
straightforward manner. There is, however, an even graver
problem with the shared fate criterion: just as W & S have
implied in their discussion of frameshifting, meeting this crite-
rion alone cannot possibly be sufficient for group selection.
Imagine an ecosystem in which all organisms reproduce simul-
taneously by cloning; there are numerous, well-defined levels of
organization; and there is no variation whatsoever in reproduc-
tive success. In other words, the ecosystem replicates itself
perfectly at each generation. Once again, there could be no
more obvious case of shared fate, in this case at any and all
organizational levels. Nonetheless, it should be clear that there
really is no selection of any kind operating at any of these levels.
Hence, the differential fitness criterion is needed after all to
explain why cases like these do not involve group selection.
W & S clearly do believe that groups can be identified as
vehicles of selection using a coherent procedure based on a
single criterion involving both differential fitness and shared
fate. However, their application of the procedure to particular
examples shows that different criteria are used to argue for
group selection in different cases. Although rabbit groups have
differential fitness, their components (the individual rabbits) do
not have fully shared fates. Cooperating cricket boatmen have
fully shared fates, but there is no clear sense in which the dyads
"reproduce": only the individuals participate in even marginally
identifiable ancestor-descendant relationships.
In summary, Wilson & Sober's account of group selection
must be inferred using two fully independent criteria, each of
which is highly flawed. The differential fitness criterion helps
them to explain selection among discrete populations such as
colonies of social insects and, conceivably, of humans. The
shared fate criterion makes it possible to treat kin selection and
evolutionary game theory as group selection. They need both,
but the two fail to yield consistent results when applied to
examples. We conclude that W & S's attempt to offer a recon-
stituted theory of group selection as a foundation for sociobiol-
ogy should be rejected by students of human behavior.
Seeing the light: What does biology tell us
about human social behavior?
C. Daniel Batson
Department of Psychology, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045.
dbatson@statl.cc.ukans.edu
Abstract: Wilson & Sober do not propose a new view of natural
selection, but a purification and clarification of the view proclaimed by
sociobiologists in the 1970s. Unfortunately, implications for understand-
ing human social behavior remain unclear, resting more on the appear-
ance of connections resulting from shared language than on knowledge
of mediating processes.
I am one of those for whom Wilson & Sober's (W & S's) impres-
sive and thought-provoking essay was written - a behavioral
scientist interested in what biology can tell us about human
social behavior - one who relies on biologists (or biologist
watchers) to pass on revelations. Lacking biological expertise, I
doubtless do not appreciate all the nuances of the message, and
as a seeker after insights W & S can provide, I do not wish to bite
the hand that feeds. Still, let me offer a few reactions from the
pew. If nothing else, they may reveal how thankless and frustrat-
ing missionary work can be, preaching to heathen who have ears
but do not hear.
A new gospel? When I first read sociobiologists E. O. Wilson
and Dawkins in the mid-1970s, I was impressed by the clear
logic and apparent correctness of their argument: the unit of
natural selection is not the species, group, or even the individ-
ual; it is the gene. One of the strategies genes use in their
endless activity of ordering nucleotides into copies of them-
selves is quite indirect: they join with other genes and use the
resources of the environment to produce complex and interde-
pendent organizations - organisms. As the organisms' progeny
proliferate, so do the genes.
If I understand W & S aright, they have no quarrel with any of
this. Rather, they wish to emphasize that complex and interde-
pendent organizations - organisms - need not always be pack-
aged in one physical body. Higher-level organization can exist in
which physical individuals or even collections of physical indi-
viduals have specialized functions, as different organs have
specialized functions in the body. To the degree that this
organization is genetically controlled and subject to reproduc-
tive competition, natural selection can occur at the group or
even metapopulation level.
Surely this is not a new gospel. It is instead a useful and timely
call to (a) turn away from creedal calcification at the individual
level, (b) return to fundamental first principles laid down by
Williams, E. O. Wilson, Dawkins, and others, and (c) recognize
the implications. To counter the excesses of naive group selec-
tion, sociobiologists (over)emphasized the infrequency of group
selection; to redress the balance, W & S (over)emphasize the
frequency. The accent shifts depending on the sin one is preach-
ing against, but the gospel endures.
Lingering doubts. What does this purified and clarified gospel
reveal about human social behavior? W 6? S believe it allows us
to conclude that motives directed toward group-interest are a
part of human nature, along with motives of self-interest. I re-
main unconverted. I can agree with W & S that many behavioral
scientists have interpreted "selfish-gene" sociobiological argu-
ments as saying far more about human behavior and motivation
than is justified, wrongly believing that these augments provide
support for individual self-interest over group interest as mo-
tives for human behavior. However, W & S extricate us from this
trap only to entice us into another. They would have us believe
that their group-level selection arguments say far more about
human behavior and motivation than is justified.
Although the terms self-interest, group interest, selfishness,
and altruism are used at both the biological and social levels,
610
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

they are used quite differently. At the social level, these terms
refer to motives, values, intentions, and goals. At the biological
level, they refer only to consequences, saying nothing about the
nature of the motivation or whether there is any motivation
present at all. The shared terminology can lead us to think that
what is said at one level has implications for the other.
To be sure, all of our social behavior must be within our
genetic repertoire, but that repertoire is vast. Given the com-
plexity and flexibility of the intervening processes, especially of
human cognitive processes, most links between our social be-
havior and genetic makeup remain tenuous and indeterminate.
Croup interest at the human level, as among the Hutterites, is
likely produced by social rather than biological evolution
(Campbell 1975). If biological, it could easily be the product of
selection at the individual level (e.g., for social docility, Simon
1990; for self-redefinition, Turner 1987; or enlightened self-
interest) rather than the group level. Group interest need not be
based on group selection, even under conditions that might
support group selection. Not every attribute that could evolve
by natural selection does, nor is every evolved attribute optimal.
Aware of these problems, W & S must fight hard, advancing
their group-selection argument on the strength of possibility,
then retreating and digging in.
Awaiting the light. Before we can know whether this or other
biological arguments shed important light on human social
behavior, we need to know far more than we do about the
mediating links. Obviously, this is a tall order, although some
interesting suggestions have been made (e.g., Frank 1988;
Hoffman 1981; Simon 1990).
Thus far, the contribution of sociobiology to understanding
human social behavior seems limited to creating, then correct-
ing, premature constraints. Does natural selection constrain us
to pursue only personal self-interest? Yes; correct that, no. Does
natural selection exclude group selection? Yes; correct that, no.
Removing false constraints is certainly useful, but if there are to
be more positive human behavioral implications, then some
brave souls are going to have to undertake the arduous task of
tracing the intermediate steps. Right now, there is no beacon
shining from our biology to our social behavior. To see the light,
we probably need a little less metaphor and analogy and a lot
more science.
The consequences of group selection in
a domain without genetic input: Culture
C. Loring Brace
Museum of Anthropology, University Museums Building, University of
Michigan, Ann Arbor, Ml 48109. c.lorlng.brace@um.cc.umlch.edu
Abstract: Group selection in humans is principally the product of
competition between cultures. Cultures, however, are not directly tied
to differences in inherited biological attributes. The result has been, at
most, random change, unrelated to differences in adaptive biological
characteristics between human groups. Culture, then, is better de-
scribed as a "domain" than as a "vehicle."
I can add little of direct significance to the thoroughly refreshing
and challenging treatment that Wilson & Sober (VV & S) have
produced. As a scholar who labors at the biological pole of an-
thropology, I look on with much interest and general approval.
Anthropology has another pole, however, and, because I
suspect that there may be a dearth of its representatives among
those asked to comment on the issues raised by W & S, I shall
attempt to don an ethnological hat and raise what should be an
important dimension that is only briefly hinted at in the body of
their presentation. This is the matter of "culture" in the anthro-
pological sense. For more than a century, anthropologists have,
Commentary 
/Wilson & Sober: Group selection
either explicitly or tacitly accepted E. B. Tylor's definition of
culture as "that complex whole which includes knowledge,
belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and
habits acquired by man as a member of society" (Tylor 1871,
p. 1).
Tylor's definition is of culture in the abstract. Traditionally,
ethnologists or "cultural anthropologists" devoted themselves to
the study of specific cultures, those bodies of "knowledge,
belief, art, morals, law, and custom," and so on, that were
manifest in given human populations. Human beings, of course,
are quite unable to survive without culture, and, as many have
observed, the extraordinary elaboration evident in the cultural
realm is one of the most obvious distinctions between the
human and the nonhuman. Culture, however, is not a product of
the human genome. That was implied when Kroeber (1948,
p. 253) called culture "superorganic,' noting that it has some of
the characteristics of the organic but is in fact something beyond.
The late Leslie White (1959, p. 8) referred to culture as our
"extra-somatic adaptation" and treated it as a realm that had
undergone its own form of"evolution."This raises the intriguing
possibility of studying cultures from the perspective of trying to
identify those dimensions that have led to the proliferation of
some at the expense of others; but, by and large, ethnologists
have tended to shy away from such an approach because of what
they regard as the unwelcome specter of determinism. The
almost hysterical anthropological reaction to E. O. Wilson's
Sociobiology (1975) is a case in point (e.g., Sahlins 1976).
For my own part, I have found it useful to treat culture as an
ecological niche in itself that has generated selective pressures
that have had major consequences in shaping particular aspects
of the human biological makeup (Brace 1964, p. 36; 1979, p. 287;
1991, p. 89). In contrast, however, although culture is the
product of a broad realm of human mental and linguistic capa-
bilities, there are no particular aspects of culture that are the
direct products of specific and inherited biological traits. Differ-
ences between human cultures, then, are unrelated to the
biological differences between the human groups that have
produced them.
The differential survival of those human groups depends
completely on the relative success their various cultures have
had vis-a-vis each other. Group survival, then, is determined by
selection at the cultural level. The record of conflict, conquest,
and colonization that can be traced since the Neolithic period
clearly shows that group selection has played a major role in the
expansion or disappearance of various human populations. It is a
form of selection, however, that is completely unrelated to
differences in the genetically determined characteristics of the
human groups involved. On the other hand, group selection at
the cultural level has led to the proliferation of some and the
disappearance of other human biological attributes as an acci-
dental byproduct.
One can make the case that group selection in humans has
been chiefly the outcome of cultural conflict at least since the
origin of the species sapiens (possibly over 200,000 years ago),
but that it has had no cause-and-effect tie to differences in the
inherited biological traits of the populations involved. The
survival of genes and individuals was obviously involved but
only in inconsequential fashion. The culture or cultures that
could be regarded as the elements involved in group selection
probably should not be called "vehicles" in W & S's sense, but
they would certainly fit into what Williams (1992) means by
"domains" when he implicitly accepts the possibility of the
hierarchy of units responding to selection that their presenta-
tion proposes.
Group selection in the cultural domain has not led to signifi-
cant biological change in human populations over the last
quarter of a million years, but culture has established a barrier
between aspects of human biology and particular environmen-
tally expectable selective forces that has allowed genetic
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4
611

Commentary /Wilson & Sober: Group selection
changes to accumulate in certain human groups driven by the
accumulation of mutations alone. In an early contribution to the
"neutralist" or mislabeled "non-Darwinian" evolutionary out-
look, I called the mechanism the Probable Mutation Effect and
noted that it could be predicted to work when selection was
relaxed or suspended for particular traits (Brace 1963).
Reductions in tooth size can be shown to follow the adoption of
specific food-preparation practices (Brace et al. 1991), and re-
ductions of particular aspects of postcranial robustness and
muscularity follow the adoption of specific elements of hunting
technology (Brace, in press). Unlike the stochastic genetic
changes that follow from group selection in the cultural domain,
the changes that result from the cultural interposition between
the previously expectable aspects of selective force and the
phenotype are clearly directional, but they reflect nothing that
could be regarded as improved or advantageous in the genet-
ically controlled aspects of the phenotypes of the members of
the populations involved.
This is in no way intended to take away from W & S's accom-
plishments. The point is that the domain of culture can take ort a
life of its own, with major effects for human survival that are
independent of differences in human inherited capabilities.
Cultural systems are produced by humans and vie with each
other for survival, and this is indeed an obvious example of
group selection. The fate of their human creators depends on
the success or failure of the culture with which they are associ-
ated, but that fate is unrelated to the genetic characteristics of
the people involved. Group selection in humans, then, has
major implications for cultural evolution but can only produce
random and unselected effects on the biological nature of human
beings.
Metaphors and mechanisms in vehicle-based
selection theory
Michael Bradie
Department of Philosophy, Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green,
OH 43403. mbradie@andy.bgsu.edu
Abstract: Vehicle-based approaches to selection are alleged to be supe-
rior to replicator-based approaches in that (1) they make room for the
legitimacy and importance of group selection and (2) they move from
metaphors to mechanisms. I point to some unclarities in Wilson &
Sobers concepts of "group" and "group selection" and argue that their
vehicle-based approach merely replaces one set of metaphors with
another.
In their abstract, Wilson & Sober (W & S) characterize their foil
as the view that "social organization is a by-product of self-
interest." Later, they castigate the "genie perspective" as failing
to address the (implicitly related) key question: "Can groups be
like individuals in the harmony and coordination of their parts?"
The two issues are not linked in any obvious way. A yes answer to
one neither entails nor precludes a yes answer to the other.
Groups, in particular, human organizations, may very well be
like individuals in the coordination of their parts without being
in any clear way the product of group-level selection.
Indeed, there appears to be some ambiguity about how W & S
want to understand the concept "group selection." In section
1.2, paragraph 4, they define it in terms of the effects of natural
selection (differential increase in groups of a kind), but this is
independent of whether adaptations exist at higher levels,
which is a prerequisite for natural selection at those levels. This
latter characterizes group selection in terms of its causal charac-
teristics. It seems that W & S shift from one perspective to the
other and ignore, in effect, Sobers (1984) distinction between
"selection of" and "selection for."
In section 1.4, paragraph 4, and later, W & S raise the
question of whether there is a relevant analogy between or-
gans/organisms and individuals/groups. Their response is to
invoke the view that the "organ/organism/population tricho-
tomy" can be "frameshifted" up and down the biological hier-
archy. Even so, that in itself does not show that individuals are in
any relevant sense like organs with respect to the groups to
which they belong. Even if it is true for some individuals in some
groups, it is not true for all individuals o;r all groups. This
weakens the force of the implicit analogy. Frameshifting alone
does not suffice. What more is needed? The differences be-
tween the functional unity of organs in organisms and the
functional unity (such as it is) between individuals and groups
needs to be addressed before we can see whether the analogy
wrought by frameshifting is apt.
The question of how we are to understand when groups are
vehicles is not crystal clear. In their initial characterization (sect.
1.4, para. 3), the key question is whether th£ entities at a given
level have the same fitness and share the same fate. If the answer
is "yes," then they are part of the same vehicle. Yet, when the
examples of selection at different levels arq presented, insect
colonies are cited as instances where the colony is a vehicle of
selection even though the insects within thecolony do not have
the same fitness. A similar problem occurs with the "meiotic
drive" case or indeed any case where selection is taken to be
operating at two different levels. The differences in fitness at the
lower level would seem to preclude the entities at that level from
being part of the same vehicle in the sense that it is relevant for
selection to be operating at the level of the vehicle. I take it that
the caveat that fitness is, strictly speaking, a property of traits
and not organisms is supposed to take care of this case, but more
needs to be said to make it clear how this is supposed to work.
Even if we grant W & S their point that selection at the level
of group vehicles occurs, it still needs to be shown that any
interesting human social organization can be construed as con-
taining individuals with the same fitness who have a shared fate
(or who have some trait whose fitness is the same for all in the
group).
The main rationale for W & S's target article is to reintroduce
group selection to the human behavioral sciences. The fact that
some prosocial behaviors can be adaptive (sect. 1.6, para. 11)
does not by itself show that there is selectiort for these prosocial
behaviors, that is, that they are adaptations at some higher level.
With respect to this last point, we see a recurring theme: Are
groups as organisms (sensu note 1) entities that are selected for
their integrity or is there selection of groups (at least some
groups) as a by-product of selection for other factors, for exam-
ple, individual organisms?
Finally, on the issue of metaphors versus mechanisms, W & S
see their approach as replacing mere metaphors with mecha-
nisms. Their own view, however, is itself replete with meta-
phors: we find, among others, individuals as "populations" of
alleles, psychological motives as "game theoretic strategies,"
and social groups as "organisms." Indeed, the very idea of the
"targets" of selection as "vehicles" is a heavily weighted meta-
phor. In shifting from a focus on replicators to one on vehicles,
the authors seek to defuse what they see as potentially mislead-
ing and unhelpful metaphors. Focusing on vehicles, however,
does not permit escape from the metaphorical web that sur-
rounds theories of selection in biology and the social sciences. It
just shifts the focus from one metaphor to another. The image of
groups as vehicles - as "carriages" or "rowboats" - brings to
mind entities that are subject to causal influence, but what is the
actual force of the claim that natural selection operates or occurs
at many levels? If we are to understand selection as more than
merely the differential proliferation of genes or individuals or
groups, then we need to show that groups are "real," as Camp-
bell puts it (sect. 2.2, para. 3). The challenge of Wilson & Sobers
piece is to redirect the focus of researchers from genes to levels
of organization that may well serve as causal units in selection.
This does not avoid metaphors but substitutes one set of meta-
phors for another.

BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

Group selection and the group mind
in science
Gordon M. Burghardt
Departments of Psychology & Zoology and the Graduate Program in
Ethology, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996-0900.
burghd@utKvx.utk.edu
Abstract: This plausible group-selection model should aid the concep-
tual integration of the natural and social sciences, but testing in verte-
brates is needed. The history of the vehicles-of-selection debate is
compared with the controversy over the readmission of innate behavior
and genetics to a respectable position in behavioral study. In the spirit of
Wilson & Sober a new "commandment" for the conduct of science is
proposed.
This is an important paper both because of its thesis and what it
represents for the human behavioral sciences. The consistent
vocabulary and effective integration of various lines of argument
and evidence greatly advance the case for incorporating groups
into selection thinking. A result should be to encourage greater
interaction and less acrimony, and certainly more mutual re-
spect, between the social and biological sciences.
Although the basic arguments are not new, the packaging is.
Questions remain, however, about the means of obtaining data
to test group-selection models. Nonhuman vertebrate work is
necessary, and I would like Wilson & Sober (W & S) to outline
the kinds of tests they would like to see performed. How should
different levels of group effects be handled? The territorial
expansion of the Hutterites is, according to W & S, limited by
surrounding cultural groups. Is this an indication of relatively
lower group fitness? Can we ignore the role of leaders and
propaganda in lowering mean fitness (sensu Settle 1993) while
benefiting oligarchies? Certainly the material condition and
reproductive output of surrounding populations appears to be
less than that of the Hutterites. Are the surrounding groups
subsidized by the metapopulation into which they are more
integrated? The discussion of the enigma of group decisions that
may be detrimental to every member is relevant in this context,
and might lead biologists to reconsider observations noted in
such books as The group mind (McDougall 1920) as well as more
recent social psychology. The recognition that both proximate
mechanisms and selective consequences need to be addressed is
a strong aspect of W & S's paper; and although the authors focus
on the latter, the challenge for the human behavioral sciences
has been articulated.
VV & S are blunt in recounting the recent history of the group-
selection controversy and suggest that the reasons for the
resistance to arguments for group selection should be explored.
Assuming that W & S (and Emerson's [1960] superorganism
institution) are indeed much closer to the truth than those
claiming that selection can never act beyond the boundary of the
individual, 1 think one step in such an analysis should be a
comparison of this controversy to other seminal periods of
conceptual change in the study of behavior. The initial response
to, and eventual accommodation of, ethological claims for the
necessity of integrating evolution, instinct, and genetic factors
into any viable approach to animal behavior provides one such
comparison.
Wynne-Edwards (1962) and Tinbergen (1951) each stimu-
lated similar campaigns. Wynne-Edwards's ideas became the
focus of attack after kin selection, inclusive fitness, game theory,
and other elements collectively provided a simple and elegant
explanation for complex social phenomena, especially altruism.
This individual-based approach certainly clarified many enigma-
tic phenomena. It provided a superficially easy-to-understand
Darwinian mechanism that some proponents even advanced as
obviating the need for empirical study of the associated proxi-
mate processes. (After Richard Dawkins made such a claim from
the floor at an International Ethological Conference in the
Commentary/Wilson 
& Sober: Group selection
1970s, I left muttering). When evidence showing the limitations
of the individual approach began appearing, the response was
either to ignore or to dismiss the evidence and models. Now a
shift is being seen and a few years from now students may look
back in wonder at what the fuss was about. For W & S, group
selection does not negate all the processes of individual or even
gene selection, but embeds them in a larger matrix of causality.
The initial response of psychologists to ethology, as symbol-
ized by Tinbergen's book, was excitement at the "new" phenom-
ena being studied, but also bewilderment that discarded or
trivialized issues of instinct, innate behavior, and genetic deter-
mination should once again be allowed to muddy the waters of
scientific discourse. In the 1940s, psychologists of several vari-
ants of behaviorism were converging on an elegant system of
explaining almost any behavior pattern of any species through a
combination of reflexes and classical and instrumental (includ-
ing operant) conditioning. This readily comprehended and
clearly articulated set of concepts, vocabulary, and methods
provided a rationale for minimizing concern for behavioral,
species, and ecological diversity. Although never accepted by all
psychologists and confounded with a needlessly naive environ-
mentalism, behaviorism had the scientific panache and ap-
proach that promised answers without addressing issues raised
by evolutionary processes. Reflecting this behavioristic ethos,
many distinguished biologists and psychologists wrote critiques
of the ethological heresy. Although some important empirical
issues were raised, the punch lines were usually some "logical"
(and seemingly irrefutable) point that was thought to effectively
derail any reason to bring back concepts such as instinct or
the innate. (Support for the broad brush I am wielding can be
found elsewhere, e.g., Burghardt 1973; 1985). Ethology never
claimed to disprove the existence of conditioning, for example,
but did place it in a larger integrated picture, just as W & S are
doing here with individual selection! We know what happened
in ethology. In 1973 Tinbergen, Lorenz, and von Frisch re-
ceived the Nobel Prize. Twenty years later, evolution, innate
processes, and behavior genetics are central features of human
psychology, as documented in the history of this journal. Con-
temporary ethology has certainly gone far beyond the empirical
and conceptual framework of Tinbergen and the early etholo-
gists without disavowing their seminal importance and insights.
Perhaps we need to do the same with "naive" group selection.
Why do scientists continue to treat and defend their ideas as
they do their children? Darwin did so explicitly. Ideas and
children both grow older, however, and have to compete in a
wider sphere. Few ideas or children develop widespread influ-
ence and power, fulfilling parental dreams. Claims of parents
about their children's failings are soon viewed as transparent and
exculpatory. Perhaps, just as it may be adaptive to overestimate
the importance of one's child, treating one's ideas comparably is
an essential and evolutionarily derived aspect of the scientific
enterprise. This can extend to a group mind-set and the promo-
tion of comparable offspring in selective competition with other
groups (Hull 1988c). As scientists, however, we should also
develop the ability to recognize quickly and then select against
such self-deception before it exceeds acceptable levels of dog-
matism and actually impedes progress. I therefore propose as a
scientist's first commandment: "Thou shalt be wary of authorita-
tive leaders promising simple answers to questions about com-
plex phenomena."

Commentary/Wilson 
& Sober: Group selection
Ambivalently held group-optimizing
predispositions
Donald T. Campbell and John B. Gatewood
Department of Sociology and Anthropology, Lehigh University, Bethlehem,
PA 18015-3169. Ibg1@lehlgh.edu
Wilson & Sober's (W&S's) explicit and implicit conclusions, for
our purposes, are as follows:
1. The innate human behavioral predispositions produced by
our biological evolution include group-optimizing ones as well
as self-optimizing ones. (We and they focus on the "altruism"
facilitating group action, neglecting altruistic acts toward a
solitary conspecific.) These predispositions are the result of a
mixture of biological group selection as well as individual
selection.
2. Where group-optimizing and self-optimizing (including
individual inclusive fitness) are in conflict, an innate facultative
polymorphism is involved, with situational cues, cultural in-
doctrination, and other factors determining which disposition
will dominate. Humans have an innate group- versus self-
ambivalence.
3. The innate group-optimizing predispositions of humans are
much less predominant (biological group selection has been
more undermined by individual selection) than is the case
for the castes of the social insects, where almost complete
sterility has eliminated most genetic competition among the
cooperators.
4. An older point of view (e.g., Boyd & Richerson 1985;
Campbell 1975) that accepted the only-individual-selection
dogma for innate human dispositions and saw group-optimizing
dispositions as solely the product of cultural evolution is re-
jected. (This is not to deny the cultural augmentation of innate
group-optimizing dispositions.)
If we have paraphrased them accurately (and if they are
correct), these propositions have profound implications for psy-
chology and the social sciences. However, their presentation in
this brief target article does too little to make biologically
evolved group optimization plausible. When W & S come to
human examples, they provide only culturally induced disposi-
tions, not biological ones. As presented, the Hutterites are a
case of cultural evolution of group optimization. (The strong
Hutterite preaching against the innate sin of selfishness sup-
ports the position that we believe they reject in point 4 above.)
On the other hand, the Hutterites lose some young adults to the
larger society each generation. Such loss, however small, is
probably selective as to innate personality dispositions. If so,
then the culturally evolved organizational inventions and ideol-
ogy are probably now producing some biological selection of
innate group-optimizing tendencies. However, this does not
seem to be W & S's point in featuring the Hutterites.
We agree with W & S that "[modern] humans coalesce into
cooperative teams at the merest [?] suggestion of a metapopula-
tion structure in which groups can compete against other
groups" and that, in general, modern Homo sapiens appear to
have a "'Darwinian algorithm' that predisposes humans for life
in functionally organized groups." In addition to noting this
general proclivity, however, what we need are detailed plausible
scenarios as to how biological group selection took place under
the conditions of early human evolution, accompanied by con-
jectures about the facultative conditions that now trigger the
group-optimizing tendencies to override the self-optimizing
ones. We also need speculation on the more specific group-
selected innate traits involved.
The current human behavior most in need of W & S's explana-
tion may be the volunteer self-sacrificial bravery found occasion-
ally in warfare and in politically motivated terrorism in settings
so organizationally chaotic that institutional coercion is not a
plausible explanation. The four or more warring factions in
Beirut in the 1970s and 1980s provide an ample source of
examples. Our present motivational theories, including those of
sociobiology, focused on individual optimization of inclusive
fitness, seem inadequate to explain such behavior, however rare
it may be. To take another, far removed, example: assuming that
Patrick Henry was sincerely willing to act on it, how irrational by
all of our motivational theories for him to say, "Cive me liberty or
give me death," when by "liberty" he meant being ruled and
misruled by fellow Virginians rather than by England. It may
take biological group selection to explain his willingness to die
for that slight difference.
W & S's case for the simultaneous operation of net effective
individual and net effective group selection is most plausible
where the traits being selected by one level are or were in little
or no conflict with those being selected by the pther level during
the longest stretches of human biological evolution. For volun-
tary self-sacrificial heroism, however, such as that shown in
warfare and politically motivated terrorism, individual selection
would seem certain to undermine group selection, leading to no
net group selection under most conditions. What seems to be
called for is a setting in which loss of membership in one's group
was more certainly lethal than the costs of occasional heroism in
hunting large animals and in intergroup warfare. Those early
human groups must have been tightly bounded, with limited
membership, and no individual survival route through joining
another group. High rates of biological extinction of whole
groups may also be required.
Unnecessary competition requirement makes
group selection harder to demonstrate

Abstract: It is commonly assumed that competitipn is a theoretically
necessary component of any instance of natural selection. This erro-
neous assumption makes it unnecessarily difficult to authenticate spe-
cific cases of group selection. With its elimination, the Gaia hypothesis,
for example, becomes theoretically possible.
I welcome the New Group Selection (NGS): anything that genes
make can be a vehicle for selection, with one exception - the
biosphere itself. I would like to add support to the NGS, and
eliminate that exception as well. Biology's long-standing rejec-
tion of group selection may have been caused, at least in part, by
the mistake of including competition as a theoretically necessary
component of natural selection. We have assumed, in other
words, that natural selection can occur only in the presence of at
least two variants of an entity, one of which survives (or repro-
duces) at the expense of the other. Wilson & Sober (W & S)
apparently make that assumption, for exainple, in dismissing
the Gaia hypothesis: "planet-level adaptation would require a
process of between-planet selection" (Wilson & Sober 1989,
quoted in sect. 2.1). Because it is usually difficult to demonstrate
that one group has displaced another, the assumption of compe-
tition makes it unnecessarily difficult to authenticate cases of
group selection. *
The following gedanken-experiment demonstrates that com-
petition is not theoretically necessary for selection and thus
shows that group selection is consistent with valid evolutionary
theory.
The experiment is conducted as follows: a certain number, say
100, of identical "aquatic" environments is set up, each in a
sealed container. One hundred identical middle-sized mole-
cules are subjected to a mutagen, and then each is placed in one
of the containers. An apparatus makes each of the environments
gradually and identically more hostile2 to the molecules and,
one by one, .they disintegrate. When only one is still intact, it is
removed, cloned 100 times, and again subjected to the mutagen.
The environments are standardized and the process is repeated.
After many many iterations, what do we find?
614
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

Commentaryl'Wilson & Sober: Group selection
A. The environment is very hostile, compared to the orig-
inal one.
B. The successful molecule is very robust in that environ-
ment, but not robust at all in equally, but differently, hostile
environments; that is, it is adapted to its environment.
C. This adaptation came about through a process of natural
selection.3 Because no variant of the molecule is in a position to
displace another variant, this is natural selection without compe-
tition. (To introduce competition, one would simply throw all
100 molecules into the same container on each iteration.)
From these findings, we may conclude that competition is, in
fact, not theoretically necessary for selection.4 In any given
case, therefore, group selection cannot be ruled out solely
because competition cannot be demonstrated. A group may
acquire adaptive group-level features even if those features do
not help it displace another group.
I believe that noncompetitive selection becomes more impor-
tant as we proceed to higher levels of integration - metapopula-
tion and ecosystem. Indeed, the Gaia hypothesis - that the
earth's biosphere as a whole evolved adaptively - rests entirely
on noncompetitive selection.5
If not competition, what, then, is necessary basis of natural
selection? In a recent article (Cloak 1986), I argued that the
essential characteristic of natural selection is that an elemental
instruction (e.g., a gene or meme) behaves (i.e., modifies its
environment in some way) and that an outcome of that behavior
is an (otherwise nonexistent) occurrence of that instruction or its
functional equivalent. That process, called self-emplacement,
can and often does take place via cooperation with other instruc-
tions in the construction and operation of individuals, groups,
and other vehicles of adaptation.
NOTES
1. Intergroup competition can be claimed, however, even where the
unsuccessful group is not extirpated, provided that its potential for
reproduction (fission) is reduced, for example, by a reduction in size or a
weakening of its internal bonds or a diminishing of its control over
resources. By the same token, a successful group, in competition or not,
is one that reproduces itself through fission or becomes more likely to do
so through increase in membership, and so forth.
2. Making the environment more hostile might encompass increas-
ing or decreasing temperature, pressure, acidity, turbulence, and soon.
At later stages, it might encompass making certain resources scarcer,
increasing abiotic dangers (windstorms, wildfire, crevasses), making
predators faster or fiercer, and so on.
3. What else?
4. In the real world, of course, competition is ubiquitous. It plays the
role of the apparatus that gradually turns up the level of environmental
hostility, thus accelerating evolution and to a great extent, directing its
course.
5. The Caia hypothesis may still seem difficult to swallow. To us, it is
intuitive that Earth's biosphere was either (1) inevitable from the
beginning, or (2) resulted from a combination of independent evolution-
ary adaptation of its component organisms - individuals and (now)
groups - and blind luck at various critical points. It is counterintuitive
that the biosphere, too, is a product of evolutionary adaptation through
natural selection.
Suppose, however, that there are a hundred billion planets in the
universe with conditions enough like earth's for evolution to take place.
And suppose that the odds are one in a billion that a biosphere including
a coterie of sociobiologists will evolve on such a planet. The probability
that there are several such biospheres - or at least one - is then fairly
high (around 2/3). In that case, we have a natural experiment that
parallels our gedanken-experiment remarkably closely. After each itera-
tion, the gedanken-apparatus automatically brings the "world" of the
successful molecule to the attention of the experimenter. In the natural
experiment, of course, our attention is focussed on the world of a
successful biosphere, because it is the only world we can view. We can
only surmise the existence of the other planets, successful and unsuc-
cessful, but planet-level selection has taken place, all the same.
Recall that no one is claiming that ecosystem- or biosphere-level
selection is paramount. We only claim that it is theoretically possible
that such selection has contributed to the shaping of life as we know it;
the same claim that is made by W & S for group selection in general. We
are left with the empirical question: "Would we be here if some
coevolution between most living things on earth were not a reality?"
Group selection's new clothes

Abstract: The Hutterite example shows not that humans have been
group selected but rather the difficulty of getting people to act selflessly.
The idea that Hutterites exemplify the human environment of evolu-
tionary adaptedness is not supported by the ethnographic record, in
which reproductive equality is rare and meiosis-like rules of group
fissioning are nonexistent. We end where we began: group selection is
possible but not very likely.
So, we have all been group selectionists all along. This is the
message of the theoretical part of Wilson & Sobers (W & S's)
article. "Naive" group selectionism of the Wynne-Edwards
variety is dead, but those ideas that so successfully displaced it,
inclusive fitness theory and evolutionary game theory, are just
new, more sophisticated forms of group selection once we think
in terms of vehicles. Actually, W & S's discussion of the impor-
tance of vehicles is interesting and may have some lasting value.
The idea that group selectionism of any variety is going to tell us
much about the evolution of human behavior, however, remains
doubtful.
W & S choose the Hutterites to demonstrate that group selec-
tion has been important in the environments of human evolu-
tionary adaptedness. In fact, the Hutterite example does just the
opposite. In the first place, there is nothing very "selfless" about
going along with a system that virtually guarantees you several
times the reproductive success you could enjoy outside the
system. Considering the phenomenal reproductive rates of Hut-
terites, the real mystery for evolutionary biology is why the rest
of us are not trying to join their colonies. Rather than demon-
strating that "humans have evolved to willingly engage in self-
less behavior whenever it is protected by a social organization
that constitutes a group-level vehicle of selection," the Hutterite
example merely shows that people have evolved to stick with the
social system into which they are born, particularly if it promises
such high reproductive success. We do not need to think about
"group-level vehicles" to understand this.
W & S are especially fascinated by the ways the Hutterites
have found to maintain a communal society despite the counter-
vailing selfish tendencies of human nature. Certainly it is inter-
esting to think about how the Hutterites have been successful, in
contrast to so many failed Utopian social religious groups (e.g.,
the Oneidans; see Cronk 1990; Mandelker 1984), W & S may
very well be right that a key to Hutterite success has been their
invention of mechanisms to keep fitness differentials within the
group to a minimum (but see van den Berghe & Peter 1988 for
other reasons for Hutterite success). We do not need the notion
of group selection for this, however, and the idea may very well
make it more rather than less difficult to think clearly about such
issues. What the Hutterite example really demonstrates is that it
is very, very difficult to get people to act like Hutterites, and
most attempts to do so fail miserably. The spirit of cooperation
and selflessness W & S identify among the Hutterites is a
hothouse flower, and it wilts when exposed to the facts of
everyday social existence in run-of-the-mill, unplanned human
societies.
This point of view runs very much against W & S's idea that
"Hutterite social organization is not unique but represents a
fairly common type of social organization in ancestral environ-
ments." This view is in no way borne out by the ethnographic
record. Certainly it is not true that fitness differentials within
groups are typically kept to a minimum in bands and tribes. On

the contrary, the great many recent studies of correlations
between cultural and biological success in traditional societies
(see P6russe 1993) have shown that reproductive success is not
necessarily equal even in egalitarian societies (see Chagnon
1979). Furthermore, although it may be true that selfless behav-
ior may be encouraged by "a social organization that plays the
same functional role as the genetic rules of meiosis" (sect. 2.6.9),
there is precious little evidence that such social organizations
typified the human environment of evolutionary adaptedness,
and certainly they do not typify recently documented band and
tribal societies. The meiosis-like rules for colony fissioning
among the Hutterites are a fascinating and ingenious contriv-
ance, but that is all they are. I am aware of no other band or tribal
society that has anything like such a system. All such societies,
as far as I am aware, fission according to genetic relatedness,
membership in descent groups, and marriage ties (see Chagnon
1975; 1992 for a classic example). Given that such meiosis-like
rules for community fissioning are so rare, it is not surprising
that human groups are so much less organism-like than individ-
uals. If a meiosis-like set of rules for group fissioning is indeed a
precondition for the evolution of selflessness because of selec-
tion on group-level vehicles, then we are back to where we
began: group selection is possible but not very likely.
In praise of replicators
James F. Crow

jfcrow@facstaff.wlsc.edu
Abstract: Although selection acts on vehicles, its evolutionary effect is
on gene frequencies and, through these, on phenotypes. Hence, equa-
tions describing the changes of replicators have understandably domi-
nated evolutionary theory. The effectiveness of selection at a vehicular
level is measured by the gene frequency change it produces.
Wilson & Sober (W & S) emphasize the distinction between
"vehicles of selection" and "replicators." A vehicle is any entity
whose components share more or less the same fate; thus, an
individual, a kin group, a trait group, a subpopulation, or a
species can be a vehicle. The subunits of a vehicle have the same
fitness, for the vehicle has control of them. Thus, it is no accident
that some mitochondria! enzymes are coded by nuclear genes;
otherwise intracellular mitochondria would compete with each
other and the cell would be the loser. Likewise, the organism
has dominion over its cells so that they behave cooperatively;
when they do not, we have a malignancy. And a population
group has (looser) control over its members; if the group be-
comes extinct, so do all its members. There is a place for
research as to the vehicular level at which selection acts.
There are, of course, problems at the borders, as with most
classifications. An obvious example is an asexual plant, which is
both a vehicle and a replicator. As W & S indicate, vehicles must
be identified on a trait-by-trait basis.
W & S aTso note that group selection has had an undulatory
history. There was early naive group selection espoused by such
as Alfred Emerson (1942; 1952), employing his loose analogies
between termite colonies with their sterile casts and human
societies with individualized reproduction. Another was the
group-selection advocate, Wynne-Edwards (1962). This led to a
backlash of individual- or gene-centered counter arguments,
such as the book by Williams (1966). Later, as W & S indicate,
there has been a swing the other way.
In contrast, population genetics has undergone no such
swings. The emphasis all along, starting with Fisher (1930),
Haldane (1932), and Wright (1931) has been on replicators,
regardless of the shifting winds of group-selection opinion.
Why?
The reason, I think, is that these pioneers and their intellec-
tual heirs have been concerned, not with selection as an end in
itself, but with selection as a way of changing gene frequencies.
Selection acts in many ways: it can be stabilizing; it can be
diversifying; it can be directional; it can be between organelles;
it can be between individuals; it can be between groups. Fisher
(1930) and Haldane (1932) invoked kin selection as the basis of
altruistic behavior and Wright (1988) urged, a form of group
selection in his shifting balance theory, but the bottom line has
always been how much selection changes allele frequencies and,
through these, how much it changes phenotypes. This suggests
that we should judge the effectiveness of selection at different
levels by its effects on gene frequencies.
Much selection goes to maintaining the status quo - eliminat-
ing deleterious mutations, removing unfit segregants from supe-
rior heterozygotes, or tracking transitory changes in the envi-
ronment. The bulk of this is surely at the individual level. How
about long-term evolutionary progress? If we assume that group
fitness is simply the average fitness of its constituents, this can
be stated formally as an extension of Fisher's Fundamental
Theorem of Natural Selection (Crow 1955). If M is mean fitness,
t is time, Vg is the additive genetic variance within a group, and
Vm is the total genetic variance among group means, then
dM/dt = V^ + Vm.
If the variance among the means exceeds that within groups,
then group selection predominates. Although this formula is
given in terms of fitness, it can be modified to reflect allele
frequency changes or changes in a trait correlated with fitness.
This suggests what to look for and measure. If group properties
differ from the individual components, as in the case of altruistic
behavior, we can use standard kin-selection theory, or, alter-
natively, observations on within- and between-group variance
(measured by neutral molecular markers) as a way of assessing
what potential the population structure offers for the evolution
of altruism (Crow & Aoki 1984).
The standard arguments to the effect that individual selection
predominates, largely following Fisher (1958), are that the
number of individuals is much larger than the number of
groups, that variance among group means is usually less than
among individuals, and that the time required for proliferation
and extinction of groups is long relative to the generation time.
For such reasons, analyses of the evolution of, say, life history
patterns are regarded as most convincing when they are formu-
lated in terms of gene frequency change. The lazy man's ap-
proach, of which I have been guilty, is to ask what advantage the
trait produces. If sexual reproduction is favorable for the group,
there is probably an individual selection argument that can be
found (not necessarily easily). The justification is that most of the
time a trait that is good for the individual is gpod for the species.
If this were not true of a species, if individuals and groups often
worked at cross purposes, the species would soon lose out to
competitors.
Of course, not all traits are so simple. Behavioral traits,
particularly altruism, are most easily understood by group (or
kin) selection (but see Simon 1990 for an alternative idea,
selection for "docility"). It may well be tfiat of the tens of
thousands of human genes, the proportion related to social
behavior is a small fraction, but surely a fraction not without
interest.

Commentary /Wilson & Sober: Group selection
spite myself, I quite enjoy the rhetoric. They are zealots, baffled
by the failure of the rest of us to agree with them. I can
sympathize: I remain reciprocally baffled by what I still see as
the sheer, wanton, head-in-bag perversity of the position that
they champion. You see, we really do agree about so much. We
come so close to being like that. We agree about the fundamental
importance of the replicator/vehicle distinction. We agree that
genes are replicators and that organisms and groups are not. We
agree that the group-selection controversy ought to be a contro-
versy about groups as vehicles, and we could easily agree to
differ on the answer. But why, having talked so much sense, do
they spoil it all at the bottom line by pretending that their kind of
group-as-vehicle selection has any illuminating similarity with
the kind of group selection that Allee (1943), Emerson (1960),
and Co. uncritically misused to explain altruism? They call that
kind of group-selectionism naive, which is right, but then they
go right ahead and talk of re-introducing it. Please do not
rein trod ucc something naive that deserved to be dropped.
We also agree that the individual organism has been oversold
on the campus. Far from championing the organism, The ex-
tended phenotype (Dawkins 1982a) is best seen as an attack on
the organism and this should be music to W & S's ears. I coined
the "vehicle" not to praise it but to bury it. This is paradoxically,
why vehicle is a better name than Hull's "interactor" (Hull 1981).
Interactor comes too close to the (messy) truth and therefore
does not merit a helpfully decisive burial.
Selection chooses only replicators such as DNA molecules
and, conceivably, units of cultural inheritance. Replicators are
judged by their phenotypic effects. Phenotypic effects may
happen to be bundled, together with the phenotypic effects of
other replicators, in vehicles. Those vehicles often turn out to be
the objects that we recognise as organisms, but this did not have
to be so. It is not part of the definition of a vehicle. There did not
have to be any vehicles at all. Darwinism can work on replicators
whose phenotypic effects (interactors) are too diffuse, too multi-
levelled, too incoherent to deserve the accolade of vehicle.
Extended phenotypes can include inanimate artifacts like bea-
ver dams. They can even include phenotypic characteristics
manifesting themselves in other individuals and other species.
The very existence of discrete vehicles is something that needs
an explanation, in the same sense that the existence of sex needs
an explanation. No doubt there are good explanations and I
essayed three myself in The extended phenotype. But the vehi-
cle is not something fundamental, in terms of which other
explanations should be framed. You should not feel entitled to
ask: "What is the vehicle in this situation?"
The cooperative crickets, sculling like Mole and Ratty in
unison toward their lily pad, are enchanting. It is deeply
unhelpful, however, to claim that the pair is the vehicle of
selection. There is no vehicle of selection in this case. It is a
terrific vehicle-undermining example. Natural selection favours
replicators that prosper in their environment. The environment
of a replicator includes the outside world, but it also includes,
most importantly, other replicators, other genes in the same
organism and in different organisms, and their phenotypic
products. Cricket genes for cooperating in the presence of
another cooperating cricket prosper. This statement is true and
illuminating, in precisely the same sense a the statement that
genes for thick, hairy coats prosper in the presence of snow. Like
snow, each cricket is part of the environment of the other one's
genes.
It would be unfair to accuse W & S of including the snow as
part of that which is selected, although it would follow from my
view of the world that that is what they are, in effect, doing. But
it would be only slightly unfair to offer the following challenge to
W & S. Figs depend obligately on fig wasps for pollination, and
fig wasps are obligately dependent on fig ovules for food. Each
species of fig has its own private species of fig wasp and neither
can survive without the other. The underlying game is almost
certainly isomorphic with that being played by the two harmo-
nious crickets. W & S should, to be consistent, say that (Fig +
Wasp) is the vehicle. Maybe they would. But now suppose that a
fig species is equally dependent on a particular species of
mopkeys to spread its seeds in their dung, and the monkeys are
completely dependent on the same figs for their food. Here (Fig
+ Monkey) is the vehicle. We descend into a criss-crossing,
interlocking nightmare of Venn diagrams, but only if we insist on
parcelling things up into discrete vehicles in the first place. To
push to the reductio ad absurdum, are W & S not perilously
close to saying of a specialist predator and its uniquely endan-
gered prey, whose shapes and behaviour have been sculpted
over many generations by a mutual arms race, that the pair of
them constitute a joint vehicle?
Natural selection chooses replicators for their ability to sur-
vive in an environment that includes other replicators and their
products. Sometimes cooperation among replicators is so
strongly favoured that units coherent enough to be called
vehicles emerge. But just because a vehicle may emerge at a
given level, we have no right to assume that it will and I believe
the evidence will show that at most levels it usually does not.
The question: "What is the vehicle in this situation?" may be no
more justified than: "What is the purpose of Mount Everest?"
Ask rather: "Is there a vehicle in this situation and, if so, why?"

Abstract: Wilson and Sober correctly ask whether groups can be like
individuals in the harmony and cooperation of their parts, but in their
answer, they ignore the importance of the difference between genet-
ically related and unrelated components.
Am I an organism, or a community, or both? I am both — and
more - but there is a tremendous difference between the cells
that are officially part of my body, and the cells, many of them
just as important to my survival, that are not. The cells that
compose multicellular me all share an ancestry; they are a single
lineage, the "daughter cells" and "granddaughter cells" of the
egg and sperm that united to form my zygote. They are host
cells; the other cells are visitors, some welcome, some not. The
visitors are outsiders because they have descended from differ-
ent lineages. What difference does this make?
This is extremely easy to lose sight of, especially in contexts in
which we treat all these "parties" as intentional systems - as we
should, but with extreme caution. Unless we are careful, we are
apt to miss the fact that there are crucial moments in the careers
of these various agents and semiagents and hemi-semi-demi
agents when opportunities to "decide" arise, and then pass. The
cells that compose my bulk have a shared fate, as Wilson &
Sober (W & S) rightly stress, but some in a stronger sense than
others. The DNA in my finger cells and blood cells is in a genetic
cul-de-sac, part of the somatic line, not the germ line. Barring
revolutions in cloning techniques (and ignoring the strictly
limited, short-lived prospects they have for giving way to re-
placement cells they help create), these cells are doomed to die
"childless," and because this was determined some time ago,
there is no longer any pressure, any normal opportunity, no
"choice points," at which their intentional trajectories - or the
trajectories of their limited progeny - might be adjusted. They
are, you might say, ballistic intentional systems, whose highest
goals and purposes have been fixed once and for all, with no
chance of reconsideration or guidance. They are totally commit-
ted slaves to the summum bonum of the body of which they form
a part. They may be exploited or tricked by visitors, but under
normal circumstances thev cannot rebel on their own. Like the

right into them, and it is not "look out for number one." On the
contrary, they are team players by their very nature.
How, individually, they further this summum bonum is also
designed right into them (well or ill, but well for the most part,
relative to recent circumstances), and in this regard they differ
fundamentally from the other cells that are "in the same boat,"
my symbiont visitors. The benign mutualists, the neutral com-
mensals, and the deleterious parasites that share the vehicle
they all together compose - namely, me - each have their own
summum bonum designed into them to further their own re-
spective lineages. Fortunately, there are conditions under
which an entente cordiale can be maintained, for they are all in
the same boat, and the conditions under which they can do
better by not cooperating are limited. But they do have the
"choice." It is an issue for them in a way it is not for the host cells.
Why? What enables - or requires - the host cells to be so
committed, while giving the visitor cells a free reign to rebel
when the opportunity arises? Neither sort of cell is a thinking,
perceiving, rational agent, of course. And neither sort is signifi-
cantly more cognitive than the other. That is not where the
fulcrum of evolutionary game theory is located. Redwood trees
are not notably clever either, but they are in conditions of
competition that force them to defect, creating what is, from
their point of view (!), a tragedy of the commons. The mutual
cooperative agreement whereby they would all forego growing
tall trunks in the vain attempt to gain more than their fair share
of sunlight is evolutionarily unenforceable, to use David Haig's
(1993, p. 518) good phrase.
The condition that creates a choice is the mindless "voting" of
differential reproduction. It is the opportunity for differential
reproduction that lets the lineages of our visitors "change their
minds" or "reconsider" the choices they have made, by "explor-
ing" alternative policies. My host cells, however, have been
designed once and for all by a single vote at the time my zygote
was formed. If, thanks to mutation, dominating or selfish strate-
gies occur to them, they will not flourish (relative to their
contemporaries), because there is scant opportunity for differ-
ential reproduction. (Cancer can be seen as a selfish - and
vehicle-destructive - rebellion made possible by a revision that
does permit differential reproduction.) As Skyrms has pointed
out (1994; in press; forthcoming) the precondition for normal
cooperation in the strongly shared fate of somatic-line cells is
analogous to the cooperation Rawls (1971) tried to engineer
behind the "veil of ignorance" in his Theory of justice. W & S see
the parallel between what they call "the genetic rules of meiosis"
and social organization, but they draw the wrong conclusion
from it, for human social groups are not, in general, composed of
near-clones, the way organisms' bodies are (and the way the
communities of social insects and naked mole rats are).
Unlike the cells that compose us, we are not on ballistic
trajectories; we are guided missiles, capable of altering course at
any point, abandoning goals, switching allegiances, forming
cabals and then betraying them, and so forth. For us, it is always
decision time, and no consideration is alien to us, or a foregone
conclusion. For this reason, we are constantly faced with social
opportunities and dilemmas of the sort for which game theory
provides the playing field and the rules of engagement. Our
genes, on the other hand, face these competitive opportunities
only under special conditions, in which what Skyrms (1992) calls
the "Darwinian Veil of Ignorance" is briefly lifted, such as in
cases of "meiotic drive" or "genomic imprinting" (Haig 1992;
Haig & Grafen 1991). The "time to be selfish," for genes, is
strictly limited, and once the die - or the ballot - is cast, those
genes are just along for the ride until the next election.
Skyrms (in press) shows that when the individual elements of
a group are closely related (clones or near clones) or are other-
wise able to engage in mutual recognition and assortative "mat-
ing," the simple game-theoretic model in which defection al-
ways dominates does not correctly model the circumstances.
This supports W & S's insistence - long acknowledged but still
ill-understood - that there are indeed conditions under which
groups can have the "harmony and coordination" required to
behave, quite stably, as "organisms" or "individuals" - long
enough to permit group-selection effects to occur, for instance.
Far from undermining the gene's-eye perspective of Dawkins
and Williams, however, this possibility depends on it; it is only
from that perspective that the enabling conditions for "group"
solidarity can be explained. Or, to put it more provocatively, the
conditions under which "nonselfish" coordinations can occur
must all be described in terms of how they can be derived,
directly or indirectly, from the interactions of "selfish" parts.
This does not deny the existence of true group spirit or true
selflessness; it just shows that the paths in design space by which
it can emerge are narrow and rare. (All the more reason to value
it when it does appear, you might say, but it is also worth
remembering that the most ubiquitous type of selflessness is the
unquestioning bondage of somatic-line cells and organs, exhibit-
ing a xenophobic group loyalty that is hardly an ideal for human
emulation.)
Subtle ways of shifting the balance in favor
of between-group selection
Lee Alan Dugatkin
Department of Biology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211.
ldugatkln@blosci.mbp.missourl.edu
Abstract: One factor that makes human behavior particularly interesting
in the context of a hierarchical view of selection is that humans are able
to shift the balance actively in favor of either between- or within-group
selection. Wilson & Sober present some direct ways of facilitating such
shifts; I supplement their argument by showing that even more subtle,
indirect effects can shift the balance of selection in favor of between-
group selection.
There is an old joke about Joe asking his friend Bill for a small
favor, to which Bill replies "Why should I do that?" Joe reminds
Bill of the time, two years back, when he lent him $10,000, and
the time last year when he pulled him from a burning building.
"Yes" says Bill, "but what have you done for me lately?" Sup-
porters and critics of a levels-of-selection approach might look at
the first half of Wilson & Sobers (W & S's) target article and ask
in a similar vein: "Is this just the same old approach applied to
humans, or are there some new, novel predictions stemming
from the hierarchical view of selection applied in this context?"
The answers to these questions are "sort of and a resounding
"yes," respectively, as W & S's paper, after a rather long review
of the group-selection controversy, makes a fundamental contri-
bution to evolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology.
Here, I wish to follow up W & S's remark that, "human behav-
ior not only reflects the balance between levels of selection but it
can also alter the balance through the construction of social
structures that have the effect of reducing fitness differences
within groups, concentrating natural selection (and functional
organization) at the group level." W & S discuss reciprocity as
one means of changing the balance of withinr and between-level
selection in favor of the between-level component. As W & S
note, however, the Hutterite example clearly shows that mecha-
nisms more elaborate than simple reciprocity exist for shifting
the weight of within- and between-group forces. Here, I wish to
discuss briefly two such mechanisms - cultural transmission of
information within and across groups, and direct observation of
the behavior of others.
As we all know from personal experience^ you do not neces-
sarily have to be cheated to know that there is a hustler in your
area. Two ways to avoid being cheated by people when you first
encounter them are: to have observed them cheating on others
618
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

Commentary /Wilson & Sober: Group selection
beforehand, or to have heard (seen, etc.) information from
others that your potential partners are cheaters. One does not
need the elaborate and intriguing rules that characterize the
Hutterites to develop such behavioral rules. For example,
Pollock & Dugatkin (1992) modelled the success of a strategy
called Observer TIT FOR TAT (OTFT). A player using OTFT
can categorize someone as a cheater if that individual has been
seen cheating on others. This strategy, which prevents the user
from being "suckered" on initial encounters, is robust under
certain conditions. When OTFT succeeds, it is because it
incorporates "indirect" information, and uses this information to
segregate behaviors and thus change the balance of the within-
and between-group selection in favor of the latter. Some experi-
mental evidence exists for the use of this strategy in humans
observing others trapped in a prisoner's dilemma (Braver &
Baniett 1976).
I have considered how cultural transmission of information
(gossip, signs, etc.) about cheaters might effect the evolution of
roving cheaters in human societies, that is, con men (Dugatkin
1992). It turns out that some forms of cultural transmission allow
the con artist strategy to exist in a population, but only at low
equilibria! frequencies, as seems to be the case in humans (Nash
1976). Without cultural transmission, however, the con artist
strategy becomes widespread. Cultural transmission of infor-
mation acts to "inoculate" potential "suckers" and strengthen
between-group selection.
These subtler means of detecting cheaters and altering the
balance in favor of between-group selection further support
W & S's plea for adopting a hierarchical framework when
studying the evolution of human behavior.
Some philosophical implications of
the rehabilitation of group selection
John Dupr6
Department of Philosophy. Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305.
dupre@csll.stanford.edu
The basic argument of Wilson and Sobers (W & S's) target
article seems to me absolutely correct. Indeed, as W & S note, in
view of the poverty, if not the nonexistence, of the genie
selection-based arguments against selection of higher level
entities, there is a fascinating historical question to be addressed
about the resilience of the prejudice against group selection.
Because I find W & S's argument entirely convincing, I shall
focus on some philosophical issues that I think need to be
addressed in accepting the multilevel picture of selection that
they advocate.
No doubt some of the attraction of the idea that a genie
perspective eliminates the need to consider higher levels of
organization is that it meshes nicely with widely held reduc-
tionistic presuppositions. A central ground for such presupposi-
tions is a concern about the possibility of understanding an
object that is alleged to have some reality independent of its
consisting of some set of real constituent parts. If the reality of
the whole implies - as surely W & S's endorsement of the
possibility of selective forces acting on higher-level structures
does — that wholes enter into causal relations, then a problem
arises as to the relations between causal influences acting on the
various structural levels contained within the whole. In Sober's
(1984) terminology, if there can be selection for properties of
groups, properties of the individuals that constitute those
groups, and genes within those individuals, consequent on all of
these selection processes will be selection o/entities at the other
levels. And these relations will be quite symmetrical across
levels. There seem to be only two possibilities. Either the
properties of higher-level structures will be, at least in princi-
ple, reducible to properties of lower-level entities, or the on-
tological status of higher-level entities will prove to be on a much
more equal footing with that of lower-level entities than is
generally supposed even by those who are skeptical about the
practical feasibility of reduction.
It is somewhat surprising and disappointing, given that in the
past Sober (1984) has so strongly emphasized the causal aspect of
selective processes, that there is little discussion of the idea that
insisting on the reality of higher-level entities involves attribut-
ing some kind of causality to them. Unfortunately, the account of
causality to which Sober's earlier work appeals seems to me to be
seriously flawed (see Dupr6 1993, Chapter 9; Eells & Sober
1983; Sober 1984). More specific to the present purpose, it
seems clearly inapplicable to the problems raised by the issue of
nested levels within biological systems. The account of causality
Sober defended in earlier work starts from the idea that a cause
should raise the probability of its effect. Responding to well-
known problems about spurious correlations, Sober and others
add the qualification that this increase in probability (or at least
no decrease) should apply in all sets of background conditions.
This condition, however, is most unlikely to be met in the kinds
of selective scenarios in which the background conditions in-
clude a whole range of features being selected for or against at
different levels of organization. (Arguably, it is unlikely to be
met at even a single selective level.) Elsewhere I have argued
that the most promising solution to such problems is to appeal to
a notion of causal powers (Dupre' 1993; Dupr6 & Cartwright
1988; see also Cartwright 1989). This anti-Humean move is
highly controversial, but the attribution of causal powers to
suitably organized higher-level wholes would, it seems to me,
make metaphysical sense of the multilevel picture of selection
that W & S so persuasively advocate.
There are further philosophical and biological consequences
of the picture W & S present. As I mentioned above, unless one
assumes that higher-level properties subject to natural selection
are in principle reducible to lower-level properties, the causal
efficacy of higher-level properties will require that the higher-
level entities possessing such properties be accorded equal
ontological status with lower-level entities, a conclusion I am
happy to endorse (see Duprti 1993). To make this highly abstract
sounding claim more relevant to practical matters, it might be
noted that this conclusion renders extremely problematic an
idea that continues to occupy something close to the status of a
cliche in evolutionary theorizing - the idea that evolution
consists of changes in gene frequencies. Why should evolution
not be said to consist, rather, of changes in the frequency of
properties of whatever objects are the targets of selection? (This
would, incidentally, imply a greater unity between processes of
natural and of cultural selection.) Beyond this dubious cliche, an
adequate philosophical context for taking group selection seri-
ously poses serious problems for major parts of population
genetics. If organisms are undergoing numerous selection pro-
cesses and, at the same time, being selected as parts of larger
entities - perhaps several larger entities, including not only
groups of various sizes, but possibly symbiotic or parasitic
systems as well - the changes in gene frequencies within those
organisms may well occur in no systematic way whatever. This
appears to conform with a good deal of empirical data; see,
for example, the classic study on Australian grasshoppers by
Lewontin & White (1960). If this is the case, then the selection
coefficients attached to genes in large classes of standard popula-
tion genetics models will be biologically meaningless. Once
again, the only salvation for such models would be a reduction-
ism that insisted that all higher-level selected properties could
somehow be traced to a determinate genetic base, something
that looks increasingly implausible. Similar conclusions apply,
as W & S suggest, to many classes of models in the social
sciences that assume methodological individualism.
The general point I want to insist on, therefore, is that if
W & S's ontological pluralism about selective levels is to be
taken seriously, it raises fundamental problems for a range of
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17.4

Commentary/Wilson & Sober: Group selection
common philosophical assumptions. I suspect that the common
predilection for genie selectionism can often be attributed not so
much to the bad arguments that W & S expose, as to more or less
inchoate assumptions of a more philosophical kind about the
ontological primacy of microstructures. I myself have tried to
develop in some detail a pluralistic, antireductionistic, philo-
sophical view that provides a metaphysical context entirely
congenial to the picture of natural selection that W & S present
(Dupr6 1993). Whether or not that account is ultimately success-
ful, it seems to me that the story W & S tell indicates a pressing
need for some philosophical account of this kind.

Group selection and "genuine" altruism
Robert H. Frank
Department of Economics and Johnson Graduate School of Management,
Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 148S3. frank@lohnson.cornell.edu
In my book that contains the passages Wilson & Sober (W & S)
discuss (Frank 1988), I described a mechanism whereby "genu-
ine" altruism toward nonkin might evolve by natural selection. I
argued then, and still believe, that this mechanism rested on
selection at the individual level. But W & S have persuaded me
not only that it can be viewed equally as group-selectionist in
their terms, but also that there is an advantage to doing so. As a
committed individual selectionist, I confess that I was very
reluctant to reach this conclusion. I hope that my attempt to
explain my change of heart will caution other individual selec-
tionists against dismissing the W & S argument prematurely.
Mine is an evolutionary game-theoretic model like the ones
W & S discuss in their Figure 4. The game is a one-shot, two-
person prisoner's dilemma (PD) played by nonrelatives, and
individuals are either cooperators (C) or defectors (D) by genetic
predisposition.1 For this model, as W & S would be quick to
agree, the standard individual-selectionist result holds without
question: if individual pairings occur at random, defection is the
only evolutionarily stable strategy, even though all would do
better if everyone were a cooperator.
My point of departure is that cooperation is motivated by
emotions such as sympathy and guilt, and that there are observ-
able manifestations of these emotions that enable people to
discern them in potential trading partners.2 If others' predis-
positions could be discovered without cost, cooperators could
always pair with one another and avoid interaction with defec-
tors. In that case, cooperators would drive defectors to extinc-
tion. More generally, I show that if others' dispositions are costly
to detect, the result is a frequency-dependent equilibrium
involving positive shares of both cooperators and defectors.
The feature that differentiates my model from conventional
accounts is that pairings between different phenotypes are not
random but correlated. To the extent that cooperators can
identify one another, the frequency of C-C and D-D pairings
will be higher than predicted by the random-pairing model, and
it is this feature alone that permits a dominated strategy to be
selected at the individual level.
My model involves no group selection in the Wynne-Edwards
(1962) sense. Cooperators make headway only if, as individuals,
they receive higher payoffs than defectors within each genera-
tion. Moreover, selection, viewed in the traditional sense,
occurs at the individual level. The complex emotions that
support cooperation and the complex means for signaling and
detecting these emotions could hardly have been favored if in
each generation they entailed a fitness penalty at the individual
level.
How does this same story play out in the W & S framework?
First, note that the groups to which they refer are not the large,
long-lived groups of the Wynne-Edwards story, but rather the
multitude of evanescent pairings in the PD game. Selection
pressure can exist within one of these pairs only when the
individuals within that pair receive different payoffs - that is,
only in C-D pairs. In all such pairs, it favors defectors unam-
biguously. If cooperators survive, it is only because they experi-
ence a higher proportion of C-C pairings than they would if
pairings were strictly random. Defectors, in turn, experience a
disproportionate share of D-D pairings, which, of course, have
lower payoffs than C-C pairings. W & S would identify this
between-group payoff differential as the force that favors cooper-
ation, and that might thereby compensate for the penalty that
cooperation incurs within each group.
W & S have offered a clear and consistent scheme for identify-
ing the locus of relevant selection pressures. The definitions
they use are not the same as the ones familiar from the tradi-
tional group- versus individual-selection debate. But as W & S
make clear, the traditional definitions create troublesome ambi-
guities that their own do not. More important, by causing us to
focus on cases where cooperation involves a within-group pen-
alty, they provide a basis for identifying when cooperation
constitutes.genuine altruism, rather than merely.a behavior that
evolves. The alternative is the position taken by Richard Alex-
ander (1992, pp. 184-85), who has said that, cooperation in my
model cannot really be altruism because it involves no fitness
penalty at the individual level. 
'
Another advantage of the W & S approach is that, in time, it
may help attenuate the doctrinaire character of the traditional
debate between individual and group selectionists. As W & S
note, the rigid terms of this debate often push people into
extreme positions - as in the case of individual selectionists who
were reluctant to concede that selection occurs at the group
level even in the case of eusocial insects. Once we recognize that
group membership is often fleeting, that individuals typically
belong to many different groups at once, and that groups often
do not consist of individuals chosen at rand6m, many new and
interesting selection possibilities emerge. I $uspect that most of
these will prove consistent with the traditional individual-
selectionist vocabulary. For example, in each of the four payoff
matrices shown in W & S's Figure 4, the only behaviors that
evolve are those that would have been freely chosen by a fully
informed individual concerned only with maximizing his fitness.
But perhaps there will also be a few surprises. If so, they seem
much more likely to come to light under the W & S framework
than under the traditional one.
That said, I must add that the Hutterite example is a curious
choice for illustrating the value of the new group-selectionist
perspective. As many individual selectionists have emphasized,
constitutions, laws, moral norms, and other elements of human
culture are intelligible as means of resolving social dilemmas. In
close-knit groups like the Hutterites, it is relatively inexpensive
to punish individuals who pursue interests that harm others
unduly. I do not doubt that social conditioning has induced
many Hutterites to put their group's interests ahead of their
own, even absent any threat of punishment. Yet it is hard to
imagine a society in which transgressions would be less likely to
go unpunished. The example thus seems almost to beg skeptics
to respond that individual Hutterites are merely being prudent
by following the rules.
Fortunately, there are many compelling examples of other-
regarding behavior familiar in our own culture. For example,
most diners leave tips even in out-of-town restaurants they
never expect to visit again. And many people drive 30 minutes
through traffic to dispose of unwanted pesticides properly rather
than simply pour them down their basem0nt drains. In these
cases, the probability of being detected and punished for doing
the wrong thing is too low to constitute a plausible motive.
Genuine altruism is at work here, and it is by no means
uncommon. If people with altruistic predispositions are observ-
ably different from others, altruists can interact selectively with
620

Commentary/Wilson & Sober: Group selection
one another and thereby reap the fruits of cooperation. Viewed
in this fashion, altruism is a strategy that can be reproductively
advantageous to the individuals who follow it. Equivalently, and
as Wilson & Sober would have it, the selective pressures
favoring altruism are concentrated at the group level, where
groups are defined as the relevant interacting pairs. Both per-
spectives permit us to say that genuinely altruistic behavior can
be favored by the forces of natural selection.
NOTES
1. Figure 4B in W & S is an example.
2. Can we detect cooperative dispositions in others? Gilovich, Regan,
and I have recently (1993) published the results of experiments in which
subjects of only brief acquaintance were able to make remarkably
accurate predictions about who would cooperate in a one-shot PD
played for money. It seems plausible that people of long acquaintance
would be able to make still more accurate predictions.
Me, you, and us: Distinguishing "egoism,"
"altruism," and "groupism"
Margaret Gilbert
Department of Philosophy U-54, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT
06269. gilbert@uconnvm
Abstract: Attention is drawn to significant distinctions implicit in our
everyday nontechnical conceptual scheme. Three forms of motivation
are distinguished: "egoism," "altruism," and "groupism." The relation-
ship between them is considered. It is argued that groupish motives (as
defined here) are not of themselves either altruistic or selfish ones in the
relevant senses.
To the "embattled minority" in the human sciences who face "a
monolithic individualistic world view" (sect. 2.4) among their
peers according to Wilson & Sober (W & S), one might add a
similar minority of philosophers, of whom I am one. As I argued
in a previous BBS commentary (Gilbert 1989b), the conceptual
scheme embodied in everyday thought and talk allies with the
embattled minority, at least with respect to some ways of
construing "individualistic."
In a number of places (for instance sect. 2.3, Note 21) W & S
suggest, congenially, that the categories and distinctions made
in everyday thought are quite relevant to the concerns of
evolutionary biologists. There are some significant distinctions
implicit in our everyday conceptual scheme that came to mind at
various points in my reading of their interesting target article.
Consider the following fragment from W & S: "The external
social conventions that make freeloading difficult . . . must be
supplemented by a psychological attitude of genuine concern
for others; a direct calculus of group-interest rather than self-
interest is essential" (sect. 2.6). It would be quite natural to
interpret this as alluding to three different forms of motivation,
forms relating to others, one's group, and oneself, rather than
two (as the phrasing may suggest). In any case, it is important to
distinguish the three forms in question and to consider the
relationship among them.
Because of space limitations what I say will necessarily be
quite rough. I draw on investigations published in Gilbert
(1989a; 1990) and elsewhere. (These focus on everyday collec-
tivity concepts such as the concept of a social group, a group's
goal, etc.)
With the important caution that these terms are being defined
anew here with no deference intended to any established
technical uses, the three forms of motivation in question will be
labeled "egoism" (or "selfishness"), "altruism," and "groupism."
("Groupish" is W & S's nice term.)
One acts from egoistic or selfish motives when acting to
promote one's own goals, needs, and so on. Thus, I act ego-
istically if I prepare a meal to satisfy my own hunger. One acts
from altruistic motives when promoting another person or
thing's goals, needs, and so on. Thus, I act altruistically if I
prepare a meal at a soup kitchen so that certain others who will
arrive there should be fed. Last, one acts from groupish motives
when one acts so as to promote what one perceives as "our"
goals, needs, and so on. Thus, I act groupishly if I prepare a meal
at 6:00 because we plan to get to the play at 8:00.
What is the relationship among these categories? First, mo-
tives of all three types can be present at once. I might prepare a
meal at 6:00 because (a) we plan to get to the play at 8:00, and (b)
I am very hungry, and (c) I know that you are very hungry, too.
Second, if present together, motives of these different types
need not be in conflict: they need not necessarily push in
different directions. This is clear from the above example.
Is it possible to act from each of these types of motives alone,
without the necessary inclusion of a motive of the other kind?
Intuitively speaking, one can act to promote one's own goals
without also acting to promote anyone else's, and without any
groupish intentions. Again, it seems that one can act altru-
istically without either selfish or groupish motives. Finally, it
seems that one can act groupishly without either selfish or
altruistic motives. This is perhaps the hardest point to allow, and
the most relevant here, so I will focus on it.
Though the main issue is the independence of groupism from
altruism, it will be useful to start by questioning whether people
can act groupishly without also acting from selfish motives. On
the face of it, they can. Consider what might run through Jack's
mind just before he runs into the kitchen at 6:00: "Oh my
goodness, we are going to the play at 8:00! If someone doesn't
get dinner now, we'll never be readyl No one else will be here till
6:15, so I'd better get dinner." Here there is no explicit.refer-
ence to what Jack himself wants or needs, no reference to his
own hunger, for instance, or his own desire to see the play.
But wait a minute, someone may say. What is it, after all, for us
to have the plan of going to the theater at 8:00? Is it not for me to
have that plan, and for you to have that plan, perhaps with some
additional conditions such as common knowledge of the plan?
(cf. Bratman 1993.) As I understand our everyday conceptual
scheme, the answer is No. For us to have a plan is for us to be
jointly committed to uphold that plan as a body. A joint commit-
ment is a commitment that is seen precisely as joint. (For a
careful account of the meaning of "joint commitment," a techni-
cal term, see Gilbert 1993a, pp. 692-95; see also Gilbert 1993b.)
I have argued at length and in a number of places that something
like this analysis of "our plan" holds for a whole range of concepts
including "our goal" and "our belief" (on the latter see Gilbert
1987; 1989a; 1994).
Clearly, if I have a contrary plan of my own, there will be
conflict within me. That is, there will be conflict between our
plan and my own. And this could happen. Our plan may be to go
to the theater at 8:00, but my plan may be to sabotage our plan,
and have an early night instead. Perhaps I intend to fake a
terrible headache. But if we have a plan, must I not also have the
corresponding plan myself (whatever precisely the correspond-
ing personal plan would amount to)? Not necessarily. If we have
a plan, and neither of us has any contrary personal plan, then
there is already enough in the situation to motivate us (because
joint commitment is motivating). So no corresponding personal
plans are necessary. They are, it would seem, perfectly possible,
but they need not be present.
What, next, of groupish motives vis-a-vis altruistic motives? If
I prepare dinner on account of a plan we have, must I be acting
for the sake of some plan of yours? Intuitively the answer here
will be the same, mutatis mutandis, as it was with respect to my
own personal plans. Acting groupishly, I do not act for the sake of
some plan of yours, that is some plan of your own, or, as we
might put it rather quaintly, some plan that you own. Rather, I
act for the sake of a plan of ours: a plan that we own jointly.
When I act for the sake of our plan, or in the light of our plan,
my concern, then, is not with myself considered in isolation

& Sober: Group selection
from the group we help to constitute, nor with you so consid-
ered. In particular, my concern is for you only insofar as you are
bound up into a "we" with me, by virtue of our having a plan. My
concern therefore would not seem to be appositely described as
involving a "genuine concern for others."
A point to stress, then, is that to bring in groupish motives is
not to bring in altruism, any more than it is to rule out egoism. It
is to bring in something that transcends both altruism and
egoism, at least as I have defined these here.
One can, of course, define altruism differently, and such an
alternative definition may well be appropriate and fine for other
purposes. However one defines particular terms, one should be
careful not to cloud over some distinctions that are (a) made
within our everyday conceptual scheme and (b) operative in our
practical reasoning, that is, the reasoning that goes on when we
deliberate about what to do in the course of daily life.

Abstract: Contextual analysis is a method for statistically analyzing
selection acting at multiple levels in natural populations. In addition to
being a statistical procedure, it provides a conceptual shift in our
understanding of selection: it becomes apparent that the mathematical
equivalent of group selection is much more common than previously
believed.
One of the important recent advances in the study of group
selection is the development of contextual analysis (Goodnight
et al. 1992; Heisler & Damuth 1987). On the surface, this
method is simply a statistical tool for analyzing selection acting
on multiple levels, but it is also a major shift in the manner in
which selection is understood.
Contextual analysis is an extension of the analysis of phe-
notypic selection advocated by Arnold and Wade (1984a; 1984b;
see also Crespi & Bookstein 1989). In these analyses, selection
and the response to selection are logically separated. An analysis
is then done on the ecological factors that influence fitness,
without regard to whether there will be any response to this
selection. This separation of selection and the response to
selection, although perhaps surprising to many, follows logically
from the field of quantitative genetics. Quantitative genetics
makes a clear distinction between selection, which is the change
in the mean of a trait within generations, and the response to
selection, which is the change in the mean of a trait between
generations. Contextual analysis extends this approach by in-
cluding not only traits measured on the individual, but also
"contextual" traits measured on the groups to which they be-
long. Together, these are used in a multiple regression analysis
of relative fitness on the individual level traits, the group means
of the traits, and the contextual traits. If there is a significant
partial regression of relative fitness on the group mean of an
individual trait or a contextual trait, we say that group selection
is occurring. Theoretical analysis indicates that contextual anal-
ysis can be used successfully to analyze classic models of group
selection, individual selection, and simultaneously acting group
and individual selection (Goodnight et al. 1992).
Although the above description outlines the statistical aspects
of contextual analysis, it does not do justice to the philosophical
implications of this statistical approach. First, it is important to
point out that contextual analysis is basically the statistical
equivalent of the approach that Wilson & Sober (W & S) advo-
cate. They suggest that we pose questions such as: "Do genes
within a single individual share the same fitness?" In contextual
analysis all members of the same group have the same value of a
contextual trait. A significant regression of relative fitness on
this trait indicates that all members of the same group share (at
least to some extent) the same fitness. It is more general than the
W & S approach, because when selection is acting simul-
taneously at two levels, say, the group and individual level, the
fitnesses of the individuals within a group will not be the same
(because of individual selection) even though they share a
common fate to some extent (the result of group selection).
Contextual analysis makes it clear that within a system of
analysis, fitness can be assigned at only one level (be it gene,
organism, or group). Moreover, fitnesses are assigned at this
level for all traits, both individual and contextual. In most
situations, fitnesses will be assigned at the level of the organism;
however, Damuth and Heisler (1988) point out that this is not a
logical necessity. Because it is central to contextual analysis, I
prefer to use the term "individual" for the level at which fitness
is assigned and "organism" for an individual metazoan.
The question becomes: How can group selection be detected
when fitnesses are assigned only at the level'of the organism?
When there is a partial regression of fitness on a contextual trait,
then there is group selection. As an example, imagine that there
is only group selection acting. In this case, even though fitnesses
are assigned at the level of the organism, all organisms within a
group will have identical fitnesses. There will be no partial
regression of relative fitness on the individual traits, but there
will be a partial regression of relative fitness on the contextual
traits.
A second point is that I refer to "the level at which fitness is
assigned." This is because in contextual analysis the level at
which fitness is assigned is a decision made by the investigator.
All changes at and above the level at which fitness is assigned can
be studied as selection; all changes below that level must be
studied as "development" or its equivalent (Damuth & Heisler
1988). Thus, in the contextual view, an "individual" is simply the
lowest level of organization the investigator chooses to recog-
nize. We normally assign fitnesses at the level of the organism;
thus, changes below the level of the organism are typically
viewed as developmental changes. However, in studies of meio-
tic drive, for example, it might be appropriate to assign fitnesses
at the level of the gene.
What becomes clear from contextual analysis is that many
forms of frequency-dependent selection, density-dependent
selection, and kin selection that occur in structured populations
are the mathematical equivalent of simultaneously acting group
and individual selection. The main conclusion, then, is that the
mathematical equivalent of group selection is exceedingly com-
mon in nature. Yet, although common, it rarely takes on the
clear form of selection acting among equivalent genetically
isolated entities that most people consider when discussing
group selection (e.g., Maynard Smith 1976). Using contextual
analysis we are likely to identify group selection more fre-
quently when it is occurring. Perhaps in this way we can then
truly understand its role in evolution.
Putting the cart back behind the horse:
Group selection does not require
that groups be "organisms"

Abstract: Wilson & Sober misrepresent the group1 selection debate: the
debate concerns whether groups are vehicles (or interactors), not
whether groups are "organisms."

harmonious and coordinated fashion" (Note 1). By contrast, an
"individual" is "a single flesh and blood creature" such as a bird
(Note 1). Thus, in their terminology, individuals are a subset of
the class of organisms: individuals are perhaps the most common
sort of organism, but other biological entities (including insect
colonies and groups of individuals) can be organisms if they
display the right kind of functional organization. Although these
definitions are nonstandafd, they will be adopted for the pur-
poses of this short commentary.
According to W & S, the central question in the group-
selection debate is whether groups can be organisms. This is
clear when W & S assort that the central question in the debate
over group selection is whether groups can be "like individuals
in the harmony and coordination of their parts" (last paragraph of
sect. 1.3). This claim is also built into their "frameshift" model.
In their view, selection processes require three different kinds
of entities: organs, organisms, and populations. This tripartite
"frame" can be viewed as sliding along the fixed biological
hierarchy shown in the left column.
metapopulation
groups
individuals
genes

population

J 
organ
In the standard case of natural selection, groups play the role of
the population, individuals play the role of organisms, and genes
play the role of organs, but we can also frameshift up so that
groups play the role of organisms. The implication is that group
selection can occur only if groups are functioning as organisms
(i.e., if they are functionally organized). Although this may
appear to be a trivial or innocuous claim, I believe this is a
misleading way to frame the debate.
Here's the problem: In stating that the central issue concerns
whether groups are "organisms" (functionally organized), W & S
suggest that such functional organization is a necessary prereq-
uisite for group selection. This is simply not the case, however.
Groups can function as units of selection, that is, vehicles or
interactors (for the purposes of this commentary I assume that
these concepts are identical) just so long as the individuals
within the groups share a common fate.1 Consider W & S's
example of the leaf-riding crickets (sect. 1.6). When the crickets
began sharing leaves, their actions were poorly coordinated; the
temporary groups did not function as "organisms" because the
individual crickets did not work well together. The coordination
of their actions, then, is one possible product of (not a prerequi-
site for) group selection. Furthermore, if group selection is
opposed by strong individual selection, close coordination be-
tween the crickets may not evolve, even though group selection
is occurring. Depending on the precise benefits of cooperation
and the strategies available in the population, individual selec-
tion favoring selfishness can prevent the development of cooper-
ation, even when group selection favors cooperation. Thus, the
process of group selection neither requires nor guarantees that
groups be "organisms." We need to retain the proper relation
between selection and functional organization: natural selection
is the driving force (the horse) and functional organization (the
cart) is one possible result of selection at that level.
This is an important point, because if we recognize that group
selection does not require functional organization (either as a
necessary prerequisite or a necessary consequence), then the
failure to find such organization is not definitive evidence
against group selection.
This criticism of the way W & S present the group selection
debate should not obscure our agreement on more significant
issues. Once we recognize that evolutionarily stable strategies
and kin selection models are not alternatives to group selection,
we must recognize that group selection is a significant force in
evolution. This means that we need an explicitly hierarchical
theory of evolution. Furthermore, if group selection is a signifi-
cant force and humans evolved in small groups, then we must
recognize the possibility that group selection can be invoked to
explain some aspects of human social behavior. Wilson & Sober
have built an impressive case for their claim that group selection
models have a legitimate role to play in the social sciences.
NOTE
1. In Note 9, W & S seem to recognize that the process of group
selection does not require that groups be organisms, but as I have
shown, many other aspects of the paper misleadingly suggest that group
selection requires group-level organisms.
Replicators and vehicles? Or developmental
systems?

Abstract: We endorse Wilson & Sobers conclusion that whether groups
are replicators is irrelevant to whether they are vehicles of selection.
However, we would urge them to reject the replicator/vehicle distinc-
tion, which requires an implicit nature/nurture dichotomy. The alterna-
tive "developmental systems" perspective is better able to describe the
role of culture in the evolution of group-level adaptations.
Wilson & Sober's (W & S's) treatment of the group-selection
question is impressively clear and simple. We endorse their
conclusion that whether groups are replicators is irrelevant to
whether they are vehicles of selection. We would urge them to go
further, however, and reject the replicator/vehicle distinction.
W & S have shown that the argument which moves from the
view that genes are the sole replicators to the conclusion that
they are the sole or main units of selection is a non sequitur. The
argument for the original view, that genes are the sole replica-
tors, is little better. Dawkins (1982a, p. 99) argues that "The
special status of genetic factors is deserved for one reason only:
genetic factors replicate themselves, blemishes and all, but non-
genetic factors do not." But what exactly is it that has the power
to replicate itself? A segment of DNA isolated from the cyto-
plasmic machinery of ribosomes and proteins has no such power.
Suppose we enumerate the whole cellular machinery needed to
copy a strand of DNA, including the independently inherited
centrioles, mitochondria, and so on. This is very far from
Dawkins's original vision. Yet under natural conditions even this
system only replicates itself because of the presence of many
other resources. Parents do not, typically, toss the zygote naked
into the world. They place it in, and often guide it through, a
highly structured developmental environment. The organism
quite literally inherits the elements of this environment. Pre-
vious generations reproduce these elements as, part of the
process of reproducing the causal conditions that gave rise to
themselves. In humans, for example, the development of lan-
guage requires exposure to a speech stream just as surely as it
requires a human genome. In this sort of way, previous genera-
tions provide an enormous range of developmental resources in
addition to the genes. Developmental systems theory draws
attention to these massive, uncontroversial, but somehow ut-
terly overlooked forms of extragenomic inheritance (Gray 1992).
The full range of developmental resources that are required to
reconstruct the life cycle of a particular lineage constitute the
"developmental system" of that lineage. Genes do not replicate
themselves. They are part of the developmental system of a
developmental process (life cycle) which replicates itself. (Gray
1992; Griffiths & Gray 1994; Oyama 1985).
Defenders of the replicator concept have always admitted
when pressed that genes only replicate themselves in a develop-

mental context. They have made their real stand on the asym-
metry between those inherited factors that contain information
- the genetic blueprint or program - and those that provide
mere physical materials. Only the latter are true replicators. No
such asymmetry exists, however, as has been made clear by
authors such as Susan Oyama (1985;' 1989) and Timothy Johnston
(1987). An event carries information about another event to the
extent that it is correlated with that other event. The "transmis-
sion" of information is a matter of the systematic dependence of
one system on another. There is a systematic dependence
between an organism's phenotype and its genetic inheritance,
but there are systematic dependencies of the same sort between
the phenotype and many other developmental resources.
Changes in these resources are reflected in changes in the
phenotype, so they, too, must be transmitting information to the
phenotype.
This symmetry between different causal factors in develop-
ment is intrinsic to the mathematical concept of information. In
the traditional picture of the development of an "innate" trait,
the nongenetic developmental factors constitute the channel
conditions under which the organisms carries information about
its genes, whereas in the traditional picture of "learning," the
intrinsic organisation of the organism constitutes channel condi-
tions under which the state of the organism carries information
about environmental factors. It is always possible, however, to
reverse the roles of the sender and channel conditions. We can
interpret the development of the "innate" trait as a case in which
the genes constitute channel conditions under which the organ-
ism carries information about some nongenetic developmental
factor. We can also interpret the learning case as one in which
the environmental factors are channel conditions under which
the state of the organism tells us about its genes.
The developmental-system, or constructionist, approach
does not distinguish a single component of the developmental
system as the "signal" or source of information. Even the idea
that the information reflected in the organism's development is
contained in the whole set of developmental resources fails to do
justice to the fact that the resources that construct later stages of
the developmental process are constructed by earlier stages.
Developmental information, as Susan Oyama (1985) has argued,
is itself the product of an ontogeny.
A developmental-systems approach to replication is entirely
consistent with W & S's hierarchical conception of the evolution-
ary process. Life cycles, and the developmental systems associ-
ated with them, can be nested within one another in just the
same way as "vehicles." The life cycle of an individual ant is
nested within the life cycle of the colony. Like the life cycle of an
individual, that of a colony is reconstructed by the interaction of
a range of inherited resources.
The developmental-systems approach may offer a better way
of conceiving the role of culture in the evolution of group-level
adaptations in humans. Culture is likely to be a key develop-
mental resource for humans. Many species-typical features of
human psychology may depend on stably replicated features of
human culture. Many psychological features which are specific
to particular human cultures may nevertheless have evolution-
ary explanations, because this variation may reflect differentia-
tion amongst lineages of developmental systems. These ideas
concern the developmental systems of individual people. But if
human groups have been subject to selection and have group-
level adaptations, then groups may have their own developmen-
tal systems, which explain the maintenance of group characters
across "generations." Rather than seeing cultures which encour-
age altruism as expressions of "Darwinian algorithms" evolved
in the Pleistocene and genetically programmed into each indi-
vidual (Cosmides & Tooby 1987), one can see them as develop-
mental resources passed on by groups in that culture. These
resources help to reconstruct the relevant group adaptations in
the next generation of groups.
An interesting example of a group developmental system is
found in the fire ant solenopsis invicta (Keller & Ross 1993).
Colonies with single queens differ markedly from those with
multiple queens. Queens from the two types of colony also
differ. These differences are thought to help in the construction
of colonies of one type rather than the other. The differences
between queens are induced by the type of cplony in which they
have been raised, as shown by cross-fostering experiments.
Exposure to the pheremonal "culture", of pne type of colony
produces an individual which is a developmental resource for
the construction of colonies of that type.
By analogy with this example, the ability pf human groups to
replicate their group adaptations may depend not on "genes
for culture," but on the extragenetic inheritance of cultural
resources.
Reconstructing the real unit of selection

Abstract: In contrast to the many attempts to solve the problem of
selection levels on the basis of the paradigmatic replicator/vehicle
dichotomy, it is possible to reintroduce the physical concept of the
"living system" as a fruitful alternative to both reductionist and holistic
approaches.
The basic dilemma concerning the "unit of selection" is associ-
ated with the fact that it is exactly the concept of such a unit that
has been definitively destroyed through the many controversies
about the real mechanism of evolution. In this respect, Wilson &
Sober (W & S) hit the mark with their remark that "the term
'unit of selection' has become ambiguous because it refers to
both replicators and vehicles, depending on the author." On the
one hand, we have evolutionary geneticists who, inspired by
fantastic discoveries in molecular biology, were very successful
in their attempt to reduce almost the entire process of evolution
to purely quantitative shifts in the frequencies of specific kinds
of molecular replicators. On the other hand, we see scientists
not so impressed by the dominant genetic paradigm who have
tried to save their field of investigation by separating as much as
possible of the rest of biological phenomena (i.e., the majority of
phenotypic traits) from the direct influence of genes. Both
approaches, if applied exclusively to explain the phenomenon
called "evolution," are basically wrong because in both cases,
something is lacking that really would permit us to speak of an
autonomous entity underlying and constituting the evolutionary
process. Thus, it is quite obvious that replicators need phe-
notypic "vehicles" (Dawkins 1976) to be transported. At the
same time, however, it is also clear that such vehicles will never
move or even behave in an adaptive manner if not set in motion
and controlled by "intelligent" drivers, that is mechanisms of
any kind provided with the relevant information, or, in more
pragmatic terms, the specific knowledge to handle biological
"machjnes" such as cells and bodies.
The question now concerns whether it is really necessary to
reconstruct the unity of a truly universal biological unit to find
the correct answer to the selection-level problem. W & S, in
emphasizing the impact of potential higher categories of vehi-
cles (mainly groups), obviously think it unnecessary, as they try
only to extend the problematic dichotomy between replicator
and interactor (Hull 1980). In such a perspective, complex
vehicles can easily be founded on rather arbitrary grounds; one
simply declares that "groups (and populations and cultures and
civilizations) are real." However, to accept the existence of real
competition between groups the idea of the group as a true unit
must already be presupposed. Hence, as in the extreme reduc-

tionist paradigm ("only genes are real"), this argument cannot
avoid becoming circular.
In my opinion, the outlines of a basic unit in both the
primordial biological ("organism," etc.) and the selectionist
sense (frequency of replication) can best be discerned if special
attention is paid to the concrete interdependencies between the
potential candidates for a general unification. For this purpose,
let us consider the very illustrative example of the defense of a
village by its inhabitants (who build a stockade, fight together
against an aggressor, etc.). If one proceeds step by step to assess
the major causal relationships, the result can be described as
follows:
1. Any gene involved depends 100% on the fate of the
chromosome carrying it.
2. Any chromosome involved depends 100% on the fate of
the genome carrying it.
3. Any genome involved depends 100% on the fate of the cell
carrying it.
4. Any cell involved depends 100% on the fate of the multi-
cellular body carrying it.
5. Any individual involved can depend indirectly, but must
not depend 100%, on the fate of the group "carrying" it. In other
words: the welfare/death of an individual is not absolutely
associated with the welfare/death of the group, because - in
sharp contrast to genes, chromosomes, genomes, and cells - it
can never be excluded with certainty that a single individual
survives.
This result, which is nothing but the logical consequence of a
physical rather than just a metaphorical interpretation of the
shared fate-concept of selection (cf. the motto "we're all in the
same boat"), seems trivial, but its implications are not. They
indicate that the crucial unit is to be found in the term "system"
in its concrete material sense. If there exists only a small
spatiotemporal break in coherent determination between differ-
ent elements of a supposed entity, we should be cautious about
calling it a unit, because selection will always have the possi-
bility of treating them separately. This, however, does not
preclude quite different phenomena, ranging from "naked"
viruses to "well-enveloped" multicellular organisms, from being
true systems in an evolutionary sense, given stable causal
coherence among its constituents. For the special case of a group
of human individuals, we must postulate a far greater "close-
ness" and interdependence than actually exists to call it a real
system that undergoes evolution by natural selection. Of course,
it is still possible that one day this might happen, but - as
impressively documented by Buss (1987) - the evolution of the
existing units of selection (self-replicating molecules, complexes
of molecules, isolated cells, aggregates of cells) already had to
solve a variety of quite severe organizational problems to finally
achieve, after many millions of years of mutative experiments,
the highest level of multicellular individuality.
Empirically equivalent theories
Harmon R. Holcomb III
Department of Philosophy, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY

Abstract: Wilson & Sober have shown how to reinterpret individual
selection theories as trait-group selection theories. However, Dugatkin
and Reeve (1993) have shown how to translate back and forth between
trait-group and broad-based individual selection theories. So, trait-
group selection theory can in turn be reinterpreted as a broad-based
individual selection theory. Paradoxically, these theories are literally
incompatible and yet observationally equivalent.
Wilson & Sober (W & S) argue that "what seem to be competing
theories, such as kin selection and reciprocity, reappear as
special cases of group selection." Is "trait-group" selection in fact
group selection? I shall pursue the objection that W & S's "group
selection" is only a redescription of individual selection.
If "trait-group selection" is just a disguised form of individual
selection, two results emerge. First, we should feel free to use it
in explaining behavior because the old prejudices and argu-
ments against group selection do not apply. There is no need to
"reintroduce" group selection. Second, it is no surprise that
individual selection theories are cases of a trait-group selection,
that is, individual selection. What had seemed a controversial
thesis reduces to a logical truism.
We need to confront the basic conceptual question, Are group
and individual selection distinguishable? My answer is paradox-
ical: trait-group selection and broad-based individual selection
are literally incompatible, yet observationally equivalent theo-
ries. This answer challenges realism by asserting that we have
several equally empirically validated theories of reality, not one.
We describe reality relative to one theory or another, but there
is no unified account beyond noting that the two mechanisms
have the same observable evolutionary effects.
Following Putnam (1992, p. 38-39), theories Tl and T2 are
literally incompatible and yet equivalent calculative devices if
and only if conditions (A), (B), (C), and (D) hold:
(A) Tl and T2 cannot both be true when interpreted literally.
According to W & S's literal interpretation, a case of selection
may be a case in which only the individual is the vehicle (the
standard individual selection view) or one in which both individ-
uals and groups are vehicles (the hierarchical view in which
trait-group selection is cast). Logically, the individual selection
view and the hierarchical view cannot both be true. On W & S's
causal analysis of the units of selection, the individual selection
theory and the trait-group selection theory differ in their causal
accounts of selection. Where individual selectionists see only
fitness variations between individuals, with group-structure
affecting individual fitnesses, hierarchic selectionists see fitness
variations between both individuals and groups. Individual
selection theory and trait-group selection theory do posit alter-
native mechanisms, and so are literally incompatible theories.
(B) Tl and T2 share a common mathematics. Many studies
have shown that the mathematics of gene, individual, kind, and
trait-group selection approaches are closely related or equiva-
lent. Some have shown that efforts to find a crucial experiment
cannot succeed because the closely related mathematics given
equivalent observational consequences (Grafen 1984; Queller
1992a; 1992b; Ratnieks & Reeve 1991).
(C) Tl and T2 are mutually, relatively interpretable, that is,
there are definitions of the terms of T2 in the language of Tl and
of Tl in T2, such that if we "translate" the sentences of Tl into
T2, then all the theorems of Tl become theorems of T2 and vice
versa. "For broad-sense individual selectionists, 'individual se-
lection' refers to evolution resulting from the higher population-
wide average fitness of individuals bearing some trait; for the
new group-selectionists, 'individual selection' more narrowly
refers to selection only within groups" (Wilson 1983a; Wilson &
Sober 1989). Thus, the new group selectionists have simply
partitioned the individual selectionist's concept of individual
selection into two components, only one of which is called
"individual selection" (Dugatkin & Reeve 1993). Here are the
essential translation procedures:
In passing from an individual-selectionist to a trait-group selectionist
view, we (i) draw imaginary boundaries around collections of interact-
ing individuals, thus forming groups . . . , (ii) describe how the
behavior of interest affects the reproductive output of an individual
within the group relative to other members of the group, and (iii) de-
scribe how the behavior affects the reproductive output of the group
as a whole. . . . The reverse translation also is simple: Take an
individual's fitness within the group (e.g., its proportionate offspring
representation), multiply this relative fitness by the group's overall
absolute output and sum across groups. (Dugatkin & Reeve 1993)
(D) The translation of each into the other preserves the

relation of explanation and exactly the same phenomena are
explained by both. For example, why are Hutterites so selfless?
According to the trait-group explanation: because group mem-
bers' aid to their sect is disfavored by within-group selection but
is more strongly favored by between-group selection. According
to the broad-based individual explanation: because group mem-
bers' aid to their sect enhances their inclusive fitnesses (the
Hutterite threat to cut off and exclude selfish cheaters makes
psychological selflessness more beneficial to individuals than
psychological selfishness). Using the translation manual above,
we can move back and forth between these incompatible mecha-
nisms to explain exactly the same phenomena. Broad-based
individual selection theory and trait-group selection theory give
exactly the same empirical predictions about whether a gene (or
trait) will increase, decrease, or stay the same in frequency in
the population for n generations. Thus, any group-benefitting
adaptations posited by the new group selection theories can
be understood in terms of broad-based individual selection
theories.
Groups as vehicles and replicators:
The problem of group-level adaptation
Kent E. Holsinger

Evolutionary biologists have consistently applied the term "ad-
aptation" only to traits that arose through a process of natural
selection (Brandon 1978; 1990; Gould & Vrba 1982; Lewontin
1978; Sober 1984; Williams 1966; 1993). Such a process requires
not only that there be individual differences in characteristics
that are causally related to differences in reproduction and
survival, but also that these differences be transmissible from
parents to offspring. As Sober (1984, p. 151) put it: "Selection
implies evolution only when no evolutionary force counteracts it
and the trait being selected is heritable" (italics in the original).
Wilson & Sober (W & S) build a convincing case that groups can
be a vehicle of selection, but they largely ignore the processes
that might allow groups to function as replicators (Dawkins
1976; Hull 1980).
Although W & S never explicitly discuss this neglect, the
justification for it is implicit in their discussion of the adaptation-
ist program. They argue that "one of the virtues of the adapta-
tionist program is that it can be used with minimal knowledge of
the physiological, biochemical, and genetic processes that make
up the organisms under examination" (sect. 1.1). It appears to
require little more than an understanding of which features of
organisms are beneficial and which are not. In fact, it also
requires that organisms have characteristics that allow their
traits, beneficial or not, to be passed to their offspring. It
requires that offspring resemble their parents, for only then can
a trait arise through a process of natural selection.
For individual organisms, this requirement poses no prob-
lem. Long before Mendel's work and its discovery, the everyday
experience of human beings confirmed it as an empirical fact.
Animal breeders have known for centuries that sheep with fine
wool can be produced more easily by breeding parents with fine
wool than by breeding parents with ordinary wool, to cite only
one example. The very familiarity of this fact makes it easy to
overlook, and the adaptationist program proceeds without a
detailed understanding of genetics because it requires nothing
more than this resemblance between parents and their off-
spring. Inheritance of group-level characteristics poses more of
a problem. The apparent lack of a mechanism for inheritance for
group-level characteristics is the primary reason gene selection-
ists have denied that groups can be units of replicator selection
(Cronin 1991; Dawkins 1976; Williams 1966). Thus, W & S
neglect a critical question: Are there mechanisms that produce
resemblance among groups analogous to the resemblance be-
tween parents and their offspring? Only if the answer is yes can
evolution by natural selection at the group level occur, produc-
ing group-level adaptations. Reviewing W & S's explication of
inclusive fitness theory (sect. 1.5) reveals examples both of such
a mechanism and of why attention to the processes producing
resemblance between groups is necessary for the proper inter-
pretation of group-selection events.
The degree of altruism that evolves in a population depends
on the balance of opposing forces at the group and individual
levels. Because W & S focus on kin groups' only as vehicles of
selection, however, they give an incomplete account of why kin
groups are more favorable for the evolution of altruism than
groups of unrelated individuals. The evolutionary response to
any form of selection depends both on the strength of the
applied selection pressure and on the degree of resemblance
between units of selection in different generations. .Figure 3 in
the target article shows that the variance ii> altruist frequency
among groups is greater for groups composed of siblings (kin
groups) than for groups formed from unrelated individuals
(random groups). As a result, the variance in group fitness is
greater among kin groups than among random groups, but this is
not sufficient to guarantee conditions more favorable to the
evolution of altruism in kin groups than in random groups. To
see why, consider an example of individual selection.
Imagine two populations of plants in which individual fitness
is positively correlated with height, tall plants being more likely
to survive than small plants. Suppose, however, that all individ-
ual differences in height are environmentally induced, and that
the variance in height increases as the density of neighbors
increases. Population A is relatively sparse', so the variance in
plant height is relatively small. Population B is dense, so the
variance in plant height is relatively great. Clearly, greater
variation in height in population B implies stronger selection on
height in population B than in population A- Do we therefore
expect a greater response to selection in population B than in
population A? Obviously not, because in neither population is
there any relationship between the height of a parent plant and
the height of its progeny. For a process of natural selection we
require not only differences among individuals that are causally
related to survival and reproduction, but also differences that
can be transmitted from parents to progeny.
If adaptation at the group level requires a process of natural
selection operating at that level (cf. sect. 1.2; Williams 1993),
then groups must do more than serve as vehicles of selection.
Just as a process of natural selection at the individual level
requires that individual differences be heritable, so the charac-
teristics of groups that cause them to differ in fitness must be
heritable at the group level if a process of natural selection is to
occur at the group level. Only if the groups in which progeny
find themselves resemble those in which their parents found
themselves can there be an evolutionary response to the selec-
tion imposed at the group level. In short, for a process of natural
selection to occur at the group level we require that the group be
both a vehicle of selection and a replicator. And for a characteris-
tic to count as a group-level adaptation we require that it have
arisen through a process of natural selection in which groups
acted both as vehicles and as replicators.
Kin groups differ from random groups in one way that W & S
did not notice. They are replicators. The progeny produced by
individuals developing in kin groups with a high frequency of
altruists will also tend to find themselves in groups with a high
frequency of altruists, and those produced by individuals devel-
oping in kin groups with a low frequency of altruists will tend to
find themselves in groups with a low frequency of altruists, but
there will be no relationship between the frequency of altruism
in parental and offspring groups when those groups are formed
at random. Parental kin groups resemble offspring kin groups
because of the predictable relationship between a parent's own

/Wilson & Sober: Group selection
genotype, the type of group into which it was born, and the
genotype of its offspring, from which its offspring's kin group is
formed. There is no such relationship between parental and
offspring groups when they are formed by a random draw. In
short, there is heritable variation at the group level for fitness
among kin groups, but not among random groups (assuming
they are broken apart and reformed every generation).1 Thus,
altruism that evolves through kin selection is a group-level
adaptation. Altruism that evolves in a population with randomly
structured groups is not, even if those groups serve as vehicles of
selection.2 Kin group organization is one way, among many, by
which heritable between-group differences may arise.
Wilson & Sober argue persuasively that the small social
groups characteristic of human populations for much of our
evolutionary history may have served as vehicles for group
selection. As a result, it is certainly worth considering whether
some characteristics of human behavior that are difficult to
understand on an individualistic basis are better interpreted as
group-level adaptations. In doing so, however, we must be
careful to check not only that groups could have served as an
appropriate vehicle for such selection, but that they had the
means to replicate themselves.
NOTES
1. There is some hcritability of between-group differences with
randomly structured groups, but it is much smaller than the heritability
of between-group differences with kin groups. If groups with a high
frequency of altruists are more productive, on average, than groups with
a low frequency of altruists, their progeny will be found in groups with a
broader range of altruist frequencies. If the overall frequency of altruism
changes between generations, the progeny distribution of individuals
from altruistic groups will be more truncated than that from nonaltruis-
tic groups. This leads to a weak association between the frequency of
altruism in parental and offspring groups. In short, there will always be
some degree of heritability for traits at the group level if those traits are
heritable at the individual level. The important question, therefore, is
whether the magnitude of that heritability is so small as to prevent a
meaningful evolutionary response to selection at the group level.
2. Strictly speaking, there will be some component of group-level
adaptation to altruism that evolves with random groups. Adaptation at
the group level is likely to have played a minor role in the evolution of
altruism under these conditions, however, because the heritability of
between-group differences is so small.
Taking vehicles seriously
David L. Hull
Department of Philosophy, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208.
Periodic reconceptualizing areas of science to introduce greater
coherence is as necessary as it is difficult. Wilson & Sober
(W & S) propose to restructure our understanding of selection
processes centering on the concept of vehicles, not replicators,
and they supply a means by which one can decide which levels of
organization are functioning as vehicles at any one time. Al-
though I find myself in basic agreement with W & S's position, I
think that one aspect of their exposition is extremely misleading.
They write as if they accept Dawkins's (1976) distinction be-
tween replicators and vehicles, when actually they transform it
significantly.
According to Dawkins, replicators pass on their structure
through successive replications. Obviously, Dawkins developed
his notion of a replicator with genes in mind, but I disagree with
W & S when they say that "all genes are replicators by defini-
tion." Dawkins's definition certainly lends itself to genes, but
nothing in it requires that genes and only genes fulfill his
requirements. Dawkins does go on to argue that genes are the
only replicators, but he has to append these arguments to his
definition.
In the beginning, according to Dawkins, the original replica-
tors might have been naked genes, but eventually genes con-
structed vehicles of various sorts to aid them in their task of
replicating themselves. For Dawkins, the connotations of the
term "vehicle" are appropriate. He sees all-powerful replicators
riding around in the vehicles that they construct and direct,
discarding them for new survival machines when the occasion
demands. Dawkins is certainly a gene replicationist, but he is
also a gene selectionist only if he thinks that replication is not just
necessary but also sufficient for selection. In his later publica-
tions, Dawkins (1982a; 1982b) makes it clear that he does not.
Vehicles also play an important role in selection. They form a
hierarchy of increasingly inclusive vehicles. As everyone now
seems to agree, the levels-of-selection controversy does not
concern replicators but vehicles, or what I have termed "interac-
tors" (Brandon & Burian 1984; Dawkins 1982a; 1982b; Eldredge
& Grene 1992; Hull 1980; Lloyd 1988; Williams 1985).
W & S treat Dawkins's "vehicle" and my "interactor" as syn-
onymous, but as Dawkins and I have defined these terms, they
are not. As Dawkins sees it, the primary relation between
replicators and vehicles is developmental. Replicators produce
vehicles of increasing inclusiveness. The replicator-vehicle dis-
tinction mirrors the genotype-phenotype distinction. As a re-
sult, replicators cannot themselves function as vehicles: replica-
tors both produce and control vehicles but cannot themselves be
vehicles. Genes cannot ride around in themselves, nor are they
lumbering robots. Thus, if "vehicle," as W & S use the term,
allows genes to be vehicles and Dawkins's usage does not, W & S
must have transformed the meaning of this term in ways that
remain only implicit in their exposition.
Although I cannot deny that the gene-organism relation
also influenced how I originally conceived of the replicator-
interactor relation (Hull 1988b, p. 256-57), from the first I
defined "interactor" in terms of the role that interactors play in
selection, not development. As I defined this term, an interac-
tor is an "entity that interacts as a cohesive whole with its
environment in such a way that this interaction causes replica-
tion to be differential" (Hull 1988a, p. 134; see also Hull 1980,
p. 318 and 1988c, p. 408). Thus, no entity is in-and-of-itself an
interactor. An entity functions as an interactor depending on the
role it plays in a particular selection process. An interactor must
cause replication to be differential, but the causal mechanisms
involved can vary. According to my definition, genes themselves
can function as interactors. They can interact with their bio-
chemical and cellular environments in such a way that they
themselves are replicated differentially. Although Dawkins
(1982b, p. 46) now doubts that the effects of genes need to be
bundled together in discrete vehicles, he still conceives of
vehicles as "units of phenotypic power of replicators" (Dawkins
1982b, p. 51). Dawkins is willing to talk loosely about phenotypic
traits being "for" something (e.g., bird wings for flying), but not
DNA. DNA codes for phenotypic traits, but DNA itself is not
"for" anything. Even in Dawkins's extended usage, genes cannot
function as vehicles.
According to W & S, the "essence of the vehicle concept is
snared fate." The method that W & S use to decide the level at
which interaction is taking place has much in common with the
"additivity" method first suggested by Wimsatt (1980; 1981) and
later developed extensively by Lloyd (1988). I wish that W & S
had gone on at greater length about any similarities and differ-
ences that their method has in contrast to that of Wimsatt and
Lloyd.
In sum, Dawkins's terminology lends itself to the claim that
genes are the units of selection. W & S counter that vehicles are
the units of selection. According to the terminology I prefer,
there are no units of selection because selection is composed of
two subprocesses - replication and interaction. Selection re-
sults from the interplay of these two subprocesses. Genes are
certainly the primary (possibly sole) units of replication,
whereas interaction can occur at a variety of levels from genes
and cells through organisms to colonies, demes, and possibly
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

Commentary/Wihon & Sober: Group selection
entire species. The units-of-selection controversy concerns
levels of interaction, not levels of repbcation. However, to use
the ambiguous term "selection" to characterize this controversy
is to ask for continued misunderstanding.
In addition, I think that my concept of an interactor makes for
a better restructuring of selection than does vehicle; but the
term itself is also preferable, because "vehicle" has all sorts of
misleading connotations (Brandon & Burian 1984, Eldredge &
Grene 1992; Williams 1985; 1992): It implies hapless robots
being controlled by all-powerful genes. Although this character-
ization may fit the entities that function in certain selection
processes, it does not accurately characterize the entities that
function in all selection processes. For example, demes may
well function as interactors. They are in no sense "lumbering
robots." Although colorful metaphors make for interesting read-
ing, they have their costs as well. "Vehicles of selection" trips off
the tongue all too misleadingly, unlike "interactors of selection."
Different vehicles for group selection
in humans
Michael E. Hyland
Department of Psychology, University of Plymouth, Plymouth PL4 8AA,
England. P02165@plymouth.ac.uk
Abstract: Two vehicles for group selection may have selected for dis-
tinctly different traits in humans. Twenty-five member hunter-gatherer
groups would have selected for altruism toward known group members.
Village and tribal groups (250+ persons) would have selected for out-
group competitiveness. Neither would select for altruism toward
strangers.
I strongly agree with Wilson & Sober's (W & S's) assertion that
principles of group selection can be applied to human evolution.
I disagree with the specific way in which that application is made
because it fails to take into account the social context in which
prehistoric people lived. Human social evolution has involved
increases in group size, and groups of different sizes are vehicles
that may have selected for different psychological traits.
For 90% of the time that anatomically modern humans have
existed on this planet they lived in hunter-gatherer groups of
about 25 persons, who, by inference from recent hunter-
gatherer groups, were able to survive because of considerable
cooperative skills (Gamble 1986; Geist 1978). Many recent
hunter-gatherer groups have shared ownership of property
(Service 1966) and are similar in this respect to the Hutterites.
Previous hominid forms probably had simpler but nevertheless
cooperative social structures. That archaic hunter-gatherer
groups survived owing to cooperation has been used to explain
the evolution of the trait of altruism (e.g., Caporael et al. 1989).
However, the English language fails to distinguish two different
forms of altruism. Altruism, occurs when one person is altruistic
toward an unknown other: this is the type of altruism that may be
observed in the prisoner's dilemma game and is illustrated by
the parable of the Good Samaritan. Altruism2 occurs when one
person is altruistic to another who is known and loved. Inference
from archaeological data suggests that Upper Paleolithic groups
were characterised by strong emotional bonds, which would
have enhanced the cooperation and altruism2 necessary for
survival. Given the very low population density of archaic
humans it is unlikely that there would have been much oppor-
tunity for altruism1( and although it is possible to envisage
scenarios where altruismj would have been advantageous (e.g.,
giving support to another group when their prediction of animal
migration failed), there is no clear evidence that this was the
case.
W & S, like others before them (e.g., Caporael et al. 1989),
link the altruismj found in the prisoner's dilemma game or in
religious beliefs to human evolution, but this is not justified from
archaic human society. Indeed, a primary objective of the
prisoner's dilemma and other game theoretic paradigms is to
select individuals who do not know each other so that the results
are not affected by the emotional ties between them - ties which
might otherwise increase the likelihood of cooperative strate-
gies. Religions advocating altruismj, such as Christianity, had an
impact 2,000 years ago because they promoted altruism, when
this was not an accepted philosophy (Ling 1968). It is of course
possible that altruismj is the consequence of generalization of
altruism2 (loved ones and strangers share human features), or it
may be that the philosophical principles of altruism, have
developed independently of evolution. Nevertheless, although
the parliament of a religious order that requires altruism, may
have rules similar to those that suppress traits adaptive at an
individualistic level, the evolutionary evidenqe does not provide
any clear support for the hypothesis that altruism, had a positive
influence on group survival. By contrast, the trait of altruism2
can be explained in terms of group selection because it would
have supported archaic hunter-gatherer survival. Altruism2
arises from strong emotional attachments (also called "love") to
familiar family and nonfamily members. (Attachments to the
latter have recently been "rediscovered" as male and female
bonding.)
Approximately 10% of anatomically modern human existence
has been spent after the agricultural revolution when group
sizes (i.e., villages, towns, cities) were often in excess of 250
people. From the Neolithic period onward, there is evidence of
warfare between people as groups competed for scarce re-
sources. It is possible that traits became selected even at this
late period in human evolution, and if that were the case, the
vehicle of selection would not be the 25-person group, but the
250+-person tribe/nation. When populations compete with
each other, traits favoring outgroup discrimination are advan-
tageous. Far from expecting the selection of altruism,, a social
context of warfare favors the development of aggressive compet-
itive tendencies where harm of unknown others is actively
sought. The historical record shows that warfare and genocide
have been and are common. Whether competitive traits have
become selected after less than 10,000 years, which is only a
short period in evolutionary development, is unknown. Farming
was invented earlier in the Old World than the New World, so
competitiveness would have had longer to evolve there. The
greater dominance of Old World people throughout the world
may not, however, be the result of a greater propensity for
warfare and genocide but may simply reflect better skills at
warfare.
W & S distinguish group-level from metapopulation-level se-
lection, a useful distinction for understanding human evolution
as societal structures changed during human prehistory. Small,
sparsely distributed hunter-gatherer groups would have favored
the trait of altruism2. Wealth-owning, farming communities
would have favored traits of competitivenqss toward strangers
but would not have selected against altruism2. Altruism, cer-
tainly exists, as examples cited by W & S show, but it is not easy
to see how altruism! evolved on the basis Of the vehicles avail-
able for human group selection.

Commentary/Wilson & Sober: Group selection
widely misunderstood; furthermore, both authors have been
instrumental in illuminating conceptual problems surrounding
higher-level selection. Still, I find that this target article mud-
dies the waters, primarily through its shifting and confused
definition of a "vehicle" of selection.
The fundamental problem is an ambiguity in the definition of
"adaptation." On the one hand, any evolutionary change that
results from a selection process could be called an adaptation, by
definition; I call this the "weak" view of adaptation. A "strong"
view of adaptation, on the other hand, includes some notion of
design - the evolution of a specific complex trait understood, in
an engineering sense, to provide a mechanism favoring its
owner's success in contributing to the evolutionary lineage.
I have analyzed various units of selection problems by distin-
guishing four discrete roles: interactor, owner-of-adaptation (in
the strong sense); replicator (now reproducer, see J. Griesemer
1994a; 1994b); and beneficiary of a selection process. Quite a bit
of the heat in the group (and species) selection debates over the
past three decades has been generated precisely by the authors'
implicitly defining a "unit of selection" as different combinations
of the four roles (Hull 1980; Lloyd 1988; 1989; 1992; Lloyd &
Gould 1993).
W & S present themselves as arguing against Williams's
(1966), view which explicitly concerned "group-level adapta-
tions" (pp. 3, 5, 6). They do not emphasize, however, that
Williams's primary concern, like Maynard Smiths's, Dawkins's
and others was whether strong adaptations at the group level are
produced by processes in which the groups are interactors.
Technically, this should have been called "(strong) adaptation by
group selection." It is true that Williams (1966) equated group
selection with group ownership of adaptations in the strong
sense, though he no longer does (1992, pp. 26-27). Similarly,
Maynard Smith was arguing against adaptation by group selec-
tion, not against the evolutionary impact of groups as interactors,
simplidter. In 1987, though, Maynard Smith explicitly recog-
nized that adaptation by group selection is different from group-
selection processes where groups are functioning, evolu-
tionarily, as interactors (1987a, p. 123). Cronin (1991) also
recognizes this distinction, in the form of her "strong" and
"weak" group selection; she is very clear about denying only the
group adaptation by group-selection process - that is, she is
interested in units of selection that are both interactors and
owners-of-adaptations (cf. Lloyd 1988). Yet W & S seem to have
rejected the significance of these recent distinctions in the very
authors they criticize.
The primary problem - and it is a significant one -with W & S's
account is that they seem to hold a variety of views about what a
"vehicle" is. They do give a rule of thumb for identifying
"vehicles," on p. 9. I find most of this indistinguishable from my
own definition of an interactor (1986; 1988), which was, in turn,
extracted and revised from Wimsatt's definition (1980; 1981).
The only difference I can see between W & S's definition and my
own is that theirs is vaguer, and potentially misleading: (1) they
do not emphasize that the attribution of being a higher-level
interactor involves examining the population and fitness struc-
ture of at least two levels; (2) their definition is in terms of genes
rather than genotypes, contrary to population genetics group-
selection models (Cavalli-Sforza & Feldman 1978; Mueller &
Feldman 1985; Uyenoyama & Feldman 1981); and (3) their
definition includes a clause at the end that seems to equate
being an interactor with having a "functional organization,"
which later seems to be identified as a strong adaptation. Yet
their own rule of thumb will pick out only higher level traits that
are selected at that level, not those that are functional adapta-
tions in the strong sense.
If W & S held a weak view of adaptation, then the identifica-
tion of something as an interactor would be enough to claim that
the trait-in-play was an adaptation. Unfortunately, they seem
instead to adopt a strong view of adaptation; they further confuse
the issue by referring to "functionally-organized," "adapted"
entities as organisms (p. 18). Being an organism (also called
"vehicle") includes being an interactor and being an owner-of-
an-adaptation in the strong sense (p. 20). Later, it also includes
being a beneficiary of a selection process.
The problem is that their method for identifying vehicles
picks out only interactors - they use "fitness effects" to identify
"the vehicles that natural selection acts upon." But I gather
that W & S are after more than interactors, because they say that
Gould's (1992) definition of vehicle differs from theirs, and that
the concept of species selection he "emphasizes" is different
from their concept of group selection. I would agree, because
Gould explicitly uses my distinction between being an interac-
tor and possessing a strong adaptation at that level. Williams has
also accepted my distinction between interactor and owner-of-
adaptation in species selection (1992, p. 27).
In sum, W & S have offered a shifting definition of "vehicle"
that sometimes means simply interactor, sometimes owner-of-
adaptation as well in the design sense, and sometimes even
beneficiary of the selection process. Furthermore, they have
adopted a method for identifying "vehicles" that has been
defended elsewhere as appropriate only for identifying interac-
tors. They also have missed the pivotal point of disagreement
among most of the authors they cite, which revolves, not around
the role of genes in selection processes, but around the defini-
tion of adaptation itself, and whether natural selection pro-
cesses at a given level are properly interpreted as necessary and
sufficient for the evolution of "adaptations" at that level.
We are left confused rather than enlightened. Still, I hope
that Wilson & Sober's target article will succeed in raising the
awareness of the importance of group selection in evolutionary
biology today, and will prompt other researchers to investigate
these issues further.
Group evolutionary strategies: Dimensions
and mechanisms

Beach, CA 90840-0901. kmacd@beach1.csulb.edu
Wilson & Sober (W & S) make a major contribution by develop-
ing the vehicle concept as a general rubric for thinking about
levels of adaptation. The greatest impact of the target article will
be to counteract what has become virtually an a priori assump-
tion among evolutionists: that human groups must be under-
stood atomistically as composed of individuals striving to in-
crease their inclusive fitness; and the correlative assumption
that groups are an unnecessary level of analysis. For example,
the unstated assumption of Alexander's (1979) and Betzig's
(1986; 1992) work on monogamy is that wealthy and powerful
males are always able to maximize their reproductive success.
The implication of W & S's work however, is that social con-
trols and ideologies acting within the group may serve to struc-
ture reproductive opportunities, with the result that there is no
theoretical reason to suppose that wealthy and powerful individ-
uals will always maximize their individual fitness. This is in fact
what empirical investigation reveals in the case of prototypical
Western societies, including Republican Rome and Western
European societies since approximately the 12th century (Mac-
Donald 1983; 1990). Socially imposed monogamy in stratified
societies is the result of a variety of internal political processes
whose outcome is underdetermined by evolutionary/ecological
theory or human nature/nurture. The outcome of these internal
political processes is that fitness differences within the society
are significantly leveled and the group is therefore an important
level of adaptation in conceptualizing historical Western soci-
eties. Notice that such a result is compatible with continued
fitness differences within Western societies depending on con-

trol of resources: one of the virtues of W & S's approach is that
fitness differences need not be concentrated at one level of the
biological hierarchy.
1. Dimensions of group evolutionary strategies. This theoreti-
cal indeterminism is also critical in conceptualizing human
group evolutionary strategies. Human group evolutionary strat-
egies, such as those of the Hutterites discussed by W & S, are
"social organizations that we build for ourselves," what I term
"experiments in living" (MacDonald, 1994) in which general
purpose cognitive mechanisms may be used in an attempt to
achieve evolutionary goals (MacDonald 1991). There are no
theoretical limits on how such strategies may be constructed,
although, as W & S suggest, there are theoretical reasons to
suppose that some types of strategies are likely to fail. In the
following I will discuss several independent dimensions of group
strategies and illustrate them with reference to the Hutterites,
as discussed by W & S (sect. 3, para. 3), the Spartans (Mac-
Donald 1988a; pp. 301-4), and the Jews (MacDonald 1994).
1.1. A dimension ranging from complete genetic closure in which
the group is closed to penetration from other individuals or groups at
one extreme, to complete genetic openness (panmixia) at the other.
The Hutterites originated as a group of genetically unrelated
families; the Jews and the Spartans developed as groups with
ethnic/national strategies in which there were cultural barriers
against genetic penetration from surrounding peoples. Popula-
tion genetic data indicate that Jews have remained genetically
distinct from the groups they have lived among for centuries. In
addition, Jewish populations from widely separated areas have
significantly more genetic commonality than is the case between
Jews and the gentile populations they have lived among for
centuries.
1.2. A dimension ranging from high levels of within-group altruism
and submergence of individual interest to group interests at one
extreme, to complete within-group selfishness at the other. The
Hutterites, Spartans, and Jews all range toward the altruistic
end of this dimension. Jewish economic activities have often
been characterized by a high degree of nepotism and within-
group charity. Group interests were of primary importance
rather than the interests of individual Jews, as indicated, for
example, by laws preventing competition between Jews doing
business with gentiles.
7.3. A dimension ranging from high between-group resource and
reproductive competition at one extreme, to very little between-
group resource and reproductive competition at the other. Group-
level adaptation sets the stage for between-group resource and
reproductive competition. Nevertheless, by continuing to use
outmoded technologies, it is possible that groups such as the
Amish dampen intergroup competition. Resource competition
between Jews and gentiles has often been intense and has
resulted in group differences in reproductive success. Resource
competition has occurred in a wide range of activities, including
artisan guilds, money lending, trading, manufacturing, educa-
tion, the professions, and influence on the government.
1.4. A dimension ranging from high levels of ecological specializa-
tion at one extreme to ecological generalization at the other extreme.
Whereas the Hutterites appear to specialize in agricultural
production and the Spartans specialized exclusively in military
activities, Judaism has been characterized by eugenic practices
resulting in cultural and natural selection for intelligence and
high investment patterns of child-rearing.
2. Proximal mechanisms facilitating group strategies. W & S
argue that social identity research (e.g., Hogg & Abrams 1987)
suggests that there are evolved psychological mechanisms that
predispose individuals to join or form groups, which result in
group-level adaptive processes. It is noteworthy that social
identity processes are exacerbated by real conflicts of interest
(see also Sherif 1966; Triandis 1990, p. 96), data highly compati-
ble with the hypothesis that social identity processes are faculta-
tive in the sense used by evolutionists. This facultative response
to external threat has often been manipulated by Jewish authori-
ties attempting to inculcate a stronger sense of group identifica-
tion among Jews by exaggerating the threat of anti-Semitism
(Hartung 1992; MacDonald 1994; Woocher 1986). Strategizing
groups are thus able to manipulate social environments in ways
that trigger evolved psychological mechanisms related to group
functioning. On the other hand, there are several important
historical examples where increased levels of resource competi-
tion between Jews and gentiles have triggered reactive pro-
cesses among gentiles, resulting in gentiles developing highly
cohesive anti-Semitic group strategies in opposition to Judaism
- what I term "reactive racism" (MacDonald 1995).
Social identity processes appear to be a pan-human universal,
but there are important individual differences in the tendency to
form cohesive groups (see Triandis 1990;' 1991 for reviews).
Collectivist cultures (and Triandis 1990, p. 57) explicitly in-
cludes Judaism in this category) place a high emphasis on the
goals and needs of the group rather than on individual rights and
interests. Socialization in collectivist cultures stresses group
harmony, conformity, obedient submission to hierarchical au-
thority, and honoring parents and elders. As in the case of social
identity processes, there is evidence that collectivist tendencies
become more pronounced during periods of group conflict
(Triandis 1990, p. 96).
Beyond shared fate: Group-selected
mechanisms for cooperation arid
competition in fuzzy, fluid vehicles

Abstract: This commentary makes two points about group selection.
First, selection can certainly act on vehicles of various kinds, but
applying this idea to human groups is tricky, because a human group is
such a fluid, fuzzy sort of vehicle. Nevertheless, even without shared
fate, human groups can use "resource levellers" and "resource lotteries"
to foster cooperation. Second, vehicles can exploit internal competition
as well as internal cooperation to promote their efficient survival and
reproduction, so adaptations for meritocratic sexual competition within
human groups, as well as adaptations for egalitarian cooperation, may
have been favored by group selection.
1. Resource levellers and resource lotteries as group-selected
mechanisms for human cooperation. Classic examples of evolu-
tionary vehicles, such as multicellular bodies and multi-insect
colonies, share several features: (1) high genetic relatedness
among constituent individuals; (2) a physically integrated vehi-
cle structure (a body or hive) that imposes a shared fate on the
constituent individuals; and (3) an obligate division of labor
between germ-line individuals (e.g., sperm and egg cells or hive
queens) and somatic individuals (e.g., somatic cells or sterile
workers). Human tribal groups make unusual vehicles because
they lack these three features: human group selection differs
from kin selection by definition because of the low genetic
relatedness of individuals in the group; humans probably did not
construct group vehicles (e.g., village stockades) until recently,
and no human group, not even the Hutterites, has a happy,
consensual division of labor between a reproductive caste and a
sterile caste. Rather, human tribal groups have genetic, social,
cultural, linguistic, and spatial boundaries that are fuzzy and
fluid. Theories of human group selection must therefore explain
how selection can favor cooperation in fuzzy, fluid, facultative
vehicles that do not have a genetic identity, a vehicle phenotype,
or a separate germ-line. In groups composed of individuals who
can survive, reproduce, and migrate separately, shared fate can
erode and selfishness can win out.
Shared fate really means shared fitness: the vehicle's struc-
ture in relation to its environment ensures that fitness is highly
correlated across individuals within the vehicle. Sometimes,
630
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

pack-hunting predators or genocidal group warfare may have
imposed true shared fate on ancestral human groups. Most
shared fate in modern human groups, however, depends on
fairly recent technology, such as ropes to tie mountain-climbers
together, or real "vehicles" to navigate land, air, and water (such
that "we're all in the same boat"). The fluidity of tribal groups
and the autonomy of individuals suggest that human groups
created moderately correlated fitnesses among their members,
rather than truly shared fate.
Without obligate shared fate, there seem to be two main ways
to promote cooperation in human groups: (1) "resource lev-
ellers" that distribute resources obtained by group cooperation
fairly equally across individuals, and (2) "resource lotteries" that
make the distribution of fitness benefits resulting from group
cooperation unpredictable at the moment that individuals com-
mit to cooperate. Resource levellers probably work best for
cooperative tasks that impose low risks and low costs on individ-
uals, whereas resource lotteries work best for those that impose
high risks and high costs. Because Wilson & Sober (W & S)
discuss resource levellers such as egalitarian ideology and food
sharing at some length, I will focus on resource lotteries, as
introduced and analyzed by Tooby and Cosmides (1988; 1993).
Resource lotteries work best when cooperation produces
individual payoffs with a positive mean value and a high vari-
ance, with positive and negative outcomes that are fast, final,
unpredictable, and unshareable (such as successful fertilization
or death). These conditions make it foolish to defect before the
lottery and impossible to defect afterward. The main resource
lotteries in human evolution were probably cooperative hunt-
ing, cooperative warfare, and cooperative sexual coercion. For
example, Tooby and Cosmides (1993) suggested that the devel-
opment of projectile weapons may have facilitated the evolution
of human cooperative warfare, by making the outcome of war-
fare more unpredictable to the individual but more beneficial to
the winning group. A fast hail of projectiles imposes a less
predictable survival lottery than an afternoon of hand-to-hand
combat, so individual defection is less likely. Likewise, prey
animals that have evolved "protean" abilities to flee and counter-
attack unpredictably (Driver & Humphries 1988; Miller &
Freyd 1993) impose a survival lottery on cooperative hunters.
Moreover, warriors or hunters may draw lots at random to
decide who will lead a dangerous raid. Cooperative sexual
coercion by males can also function as a reproductive lottery,
because the outcome of sperm competition among multiple
males is not predictable (see Bellis & Baker 1990).
W & S do recognize the analogy between meiosis at the
genetic level and randomization mechanisms for ensuring coop-
eration at the group level, and mention the Hutterite lottery
method for assigning the original home site to one of two groups
after splitting. Even John Rawls (1971) used a resource lottery
argument to support his resource-levelling theory of political
justice, when he asked how one would want society to be
structured if one's birth position (family, sex, class, and race)
were to be determined at random. Because the importance of
adaptive unpredictability in biology and psychology has been
long overlooked (Driver & Humphries 1988), the study of
unpredictable resource lotteries to promote group cooperation
may be a fruitful area for further research. Rapoport and Bud-
escu (1992) have already demonstrated that individual humans
are rather good randomizers under ecologically valid conditions;
perhaps human groups are too.
2. Cultural courtship systems as group-selected mechanisms
for efficient sexual selection. My second main point is that
efficient vehicles use internal competition as well as internal
cooperation to organize and maintain functional adaptations.
Multiccllular bodies exploit competition in many ways: brain
development depends on competition between neurons for
neurotrophic signals, learning depends on competition between
synapses for reinforcement, and immune system functioning
depends on differential reproduction between antibodies in
favor of superior antigen-matches (see Gazzaniga 1993). At the
Commentary/Wilson 
& Sober: Group selection
level of human groups, then, group selection itself may favor a
subtle balance between egalitarian collectivism and eugenic
meritocracy. Some apparently selfish behaviors such as role
differentiation, status seeking, and sexual competition may have
been favored by group selection, just as certain modes of
competition between neurons and between anti-bodies were
favored by individual selection.
In particular, group selection between human tribes may
have favored ritualized modes of sexual competition and court-
ship that promote efficient mate choice, thus amplifying differ-
ences in reproductive success and maintaining the tribe's gene-
pool quality across generations. Whereas resource levelling and
resource lotteries promote group cooperation within a genera-
tion, amplifying reproductive differences through meritocratic
sexual competition promotes group eugenics across genera-
tions. Consider two hypothetical tribes of equal size, coopera-
tiveness, and technology: the Random Maters enforce random
mating and equal numbers of offspring among all its surviving
men and women, whereas the Selective Breeders encourage
selective and assortative mating, meritocratic polygamy, and
higher numbers of offspring for higher-viability men and
women. Across generations, we would expect group selection
itself to favor the Selective Breeders, who coevolve against
pathogens, propagate heritable innovations, and guard against
recurrent deleterious mutations much more efficiently than the
Random Maters do. The idea that group selection can favor
group-level eugenics has bad historical connotations, but eu-
genics is what selective mate choice is all about, and any group
mechanisms that promote efficient mate choice, such as parties,
feasts, dances, sporting contests, religious rituals, political ral-
lies, and scientific conferences, may serve a eugenic function for
the group. Individual selection and group selection can some-
times reinforce one another, creating powerful evolutionary
pressures on organisms (and difficult methodological problems
for biologists.)
Of course, the Random Maters might gain an advantage if
egalitarian mating fostered better group cooperation and if
technological and economic innovations made this short-term
cooperation much more important than long-term sexual-
selective efficiency. This may help to explain the otherwise
mysterious historical shift from polygynous, hierarchical medi-
eval cultures to more monogamous, egalitarian capitalist cul-
tures in Europe (Betzig 1986). More often, though, we might
expect group selection to push toward egalitarian collectivism in
survival domains but eugenic meritocracy in reproductive do-
mains. Indeed, many human groups have developed cultural
distinctions between collective rituals to promote group cooper-
ation in survival domains and ritualized courtship competi-
tions to promote meritocratic selective mating in reproductive
domains. The classical liberal principle of "equality of oppor-
tunity, inequality of outcome" also strikes a balance between
cooperation-promoting egalitarianism and competition-promoting
meritocracy. This balance may have been favored by group
selection: whereas economic individualists probably starved to
death, reproductive communists were probably mutated into
collective oblivion. Our ancestors may have prospered, as indi-
viduals and groups, by combining tender economic socialism
with tough reproductive libertarianism. This hybrid system may
reflect a conflict between different group-selection pressures
over different time scales, not just a conflict between levels of
selection. If so, group selection may have favored group cooper-
ation that buffered individuals from natural selection by the
external environment, but it may have increased the intensity of
sexual selection through mate choice, thereby setting the stage
for runaway sexual selection in human mental evolution (see
Miller 1993: Ridley 1993).

Commentary/Wihon & Sober: Group selection
Hominids, coalitions, and weapons:
Not vehicles
Jim Moore
Anthropology Department, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA

Abstract: Pace Wilson & Sober, group selection has not won over
biology. However, the combination of fission/fusion organization (favor-
ing coalition formation and relatively complex tactical behavior) with
weapons (which in conjunction with group or ambush attacks greatly
reduce the costs to actors of lethal inter- and intragroup aggression)
create circumstances that may well have favored group selection in
hominid evolution.
Wilson & Sober's (W & S's) target article is based on two funda-
mentally flawed premises:
First, that group selection has been widely accepted in
biology and that the social sciences are in need of the good news.
This is belied both by their list of prominent "holdouts," and by
their own pleas with "gene-centered theorists" to offer recogni-
tion: "All of the major developments . . . are over ten years old
and it is time for them to be acknowledged generally" (sect. 1.6,
last para.). Regardless of the merits of their hypothesis, or the
injustice of dismissal by silence they may be suffering, their
stated purpose is [self?]deceptive.
Second, that the question "at the heart of the group selection
controversy [is] can groups be like individuals in . . . harmony
and coordination?" . . . (sect. 1.3, last para.). Even G. C. Wil-
liams agrees that group selection can work (see Note 4, and
compare with sect. 1.4.2, para. 3); this is not controversial.
Debate centers on which groups, how often, and why. I do not
accept the idea that W & S's perceived conflict between group
and individual perspectives in this debate is necessarily substan-
tive simply because "it refuses to go away"; so does nature/
nurture.
As a result, W & S's paper fails in its attempt to establish
sophisticated group selection as an important part of the reign-
ing biological paradigm. Happily, however, it does "reintroduce
group selection to the human behavioral sciences," and this at
least is worth serious consideration. Humans display many
behaviors that appear difficult to explain in individual selection
terms. Might group selection have been important in human
evolution, if not in evolution in general?
It is important to emphasize that individual selfishness is
capable of producing cooperation and apparent "altruism."
Among adult mammals at least, mutualistic game-theoretical
explanations for cooperation have generally proven superior to
those based on reciprocity or nepotism (e.g., Bercovitch 1988;
de Waal 1982; Moore 1984; Packer & Pusey 1982), though lack of
genetic data often makes discrimination among explanations
difficult (e.g., Connor et al. 1992; see Moore 1992). However, a
variety of human traits are difficult to explain via individual
selection (e.g., "indoctrinability" or "religiosity"; note that I say
difficult, not impossible).
The leading scenario for the evolution of such traits was set out
by Darwin (1871) and significantly elaborated by Alexander
(1985; 1989). According to them, violent intergroup conflict
provided the selection pressure that ultimately resulted in
group-directed altruism; as Darwin put it,
A tribe including many members who, from possessing in a high
degree the spirit of patriotism, fidelity, obedience, courage, and
sympathy, were always ready to aid one another, and to sacrifice
themselves for the common good, would be victorious over most
other tribes; and this would be natural selection.
Although both authors favor individual-level explanations for
the evolution of these "traits" (sensu lato), it is not hard to see
how W & S's group-selection ideas might apply. (Note that the
one example of possibly group-selected cooperation offered by
Mesterton-Gibbons & Dugatkin (1992, p. 274) is of ants in which
"[i]ntracolony cooperation . . . appears to be the result of inter-
colony aggression.")
The Hutterite example given is particularly instructive, as
they are cognitively manipulating migration rates by identifying
and expelling noncooperators. If rook flocki were closed and
individuals collectively attacked pairs layipg large clutches,
Wynne-Edwards would have carried the day. Manipulation
combined with explicit indoctrination results (indirectly) in
high reproductive success for all members, relative to non-
Hutterites, apparently limited only by intergroup competition
("persecution and legal restrictions"). An interesting thought
experiment: remove all non-Hutterites frorh Canada, seal the
borders, and wait until the habitat is saturated.
Because many animals live in groups and could in principle
evolve the required mental attributes, why have humans gone
so far down the potentially group-selected p?ith? What is differ-
ent about us?
Manson and Wrangham (1991) argue that the potential for
lethal intergroup violence is great in chimpanzees and humans
because subgrouping creates the potential for imbalances of
power: a party from one community can attack an individual of
another at relatively low cost to themselves. For chimpanzees,
they further argue that the ability of a party to physically
immobilize a lone opponent lowers the cost of aggression still
more.
For chimpanzees, such attacks are protracted and the victims
often survive (Manson & Wrangham 1991). Now imagine such
an attack by a group of hominids carrying stone weapons. The
impact, as it were, of such tools cannot be overemphasized.
Here is what is different about us (as with other traits, a
difference in degree, not kind): the combination of coalitions
plus weapons vastly increases the potential for lethal aggression,
and to the degree that fission/fusion processes have charac-
terized hominids, this potential is increased even more.
The introduction of weapons makes us different in another
way. Although the basic parameters leading to the evolution of
"egalitarian" societies are general (Vehrencamp 1983), coalitions
and weapons greatly increase the difficulty of achieving despotic
power in nonstate society. Cooperatively enforced sanctions
(including assassination) against those who attempt to manipu-
late power or resources for personal benefit are widespread in
small-scale "egalitarian' human societies; they may explain the
existence of such societies, and are fully intefpretable in individ-
ual selection terms (Boehm 1993). Hutterite exclusion of nonco-
operators is an example of such status levelling in human
groups. 
'
The potential importance of the relations among fission/
fusion organization, coalitions, and social: complexity in the
evolution of cognitive complexity is widely recognized (e.g.,
Alexander 1989). A strong case can be made as well that homi-
nids have taken this path further than chimpanzees or bot-
tlenose dolphins because of the discovery of weapons, which (in
combination with the foregoing) drastically change the costs of
aggression and so the complexity of intra- and intergroup rela-
tionships. I note, speculatively, that (1) the first stone tools, (2) a
major increase in encephalization, and (3) a so-far unexplained
thickening in the cranial vault bones all coincide with the origin
of Homo, and that H. erectus soon followed, characterized by a
further thickening of the cranial vault and ah apparently abrupt
increase in stature (see Klein 1989; Wood 1992). Space pre-
cludes elaborating on the obvious. [See also Falk: "Brain Evolu-
tion in Homo" BBS 13 (2) 1990; Dunbar: "Convolution of Neocor-
tical Size, Group Size and Language in Humans" BBS 16 (4)
1993.]
In conclusion, human behavioral biologists will profit from
considering Wilson & Sober's ideas, but only after reading
Alexander (1989) and others and thinking about why humans
are (quantitatively) different from other Organisms in game-
theoretically relevant ways.

Why is group selection such a problem?
Randolph M. Nesse
Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Ml

Abstract: The controversy over group selection persists not, as Wilson &
Sober argue, because biologists do not understand the hierarchy of
vehicles of selection, but because we lack criteria to determine whether
or not a trait arises from group selection, and have a deep wish to find a
biological basis for our human moral feelings.
Group selection? Still? More? Again? Despite dozens of articles
and books on the topic, fundamental disagreements persist.
Such intractability usually arises from failure to conceptualize a
problem clearly, lack of data, or the influence of political or
emotional factors. In the curious case of group selection, all
three factors conspire to maintain confusion.
Wilson & Sober (W & S) claim that "overextended definitions
of individual and gene selection have misled a generation of
biologists into thinking that natural selection almost never
occurs at the level of groups" (sect. 1.6) and they set out to
"rebuild inclusive fitness theory on the foundation of vehicles"
(sect. 1.5). They go to great lengths to show that groups, like
individuals, can be vehicles for natural selection. But this is not
at issue, is it? Wilson and others have described models in which
genes that benefit a group can be selected for even though they
decrease an individual's inclusive fitness. These models work,
albeit under very restricted conditions. The question is not
whether traits that benefit the group at the expense of the indi-
vidual are possible; the question is whether they are important,
and especially whether they can account for human altruism.
This brings us to the paucity of data. The authors use starving
rabbits on tiny islands to illustrate the principle, but the lack of
evidence for such population limitation is the very spark that
kindled the demise of naive group selection. The aberrations
from equal sex ratios Eire intriguing, but no mention is made of
alternative explanations for these findings. The Hutterite exam-
ple, although atypical for the species, proves that humans can be
extraordinarily altruistic, but it says nothing about the mecha-
nisms that make this possible, and nothing about the selection
processes that shape these mechanisms.
W & S address the core question of whether organisms (espe-
cially humans) have traits (especially altruism) that were shaped
by the force of selection acting at the group level despite
selection against these traits at the individual level. The concep-
tual problem here seems to me to have little to do with vehicles
and everything to do with standards of evidence. How can we
tell if a trait arose by this process or some other one? We can not.
There is no phylogeny to trace, no comparative information to
guide us. If someone could demonstrate a trait that decreased
inclusive fitness and increased group fitness, we would have a
good start, but I know of no such trait.
As for George Williams, he may have led us out of the
wilderness of naive group selectionism, but I doubt that he
would endorse the Commandment offered in his name: "Thou
shalt not apply the adaptationist program above the level of the
individual." Instead, he simply applies Ockham's razor and
insists that we explain phenomena at the simplest possible level.
He also insists that we carefully distinguish the information (the
codex) that is changed by natural selection from the material
domains in which that information resides. He notes that, "a
gene is not a DNA molecule; it is the transcribable information
coded by the molecule . . . a whole addictive organism . . . is
not really an object, it is a region in which certain processes take
place" (Williams 1992, p. 11). He is well aware that selection can
take place at levels other than the genes and the individual. His
1992 book contains some fine examples of clade selection, for
example, Van Valen's evidence that individual mammals are
selected for larger body size, but clades of mammals with large
Commentary/Wilson & Sober: Group selection
bodies are constantly being supplanted by those with smaller
bodies.
What about vehicles of selection? The strategy of moving up
the hierarchy until one finds fitness differences between vehi-
cles is helpful, but, as the authors say, "fitness differences are not
always concentrated at one level of the biological hierarchy. . . .
In these cases, we cannot assign the status of organ, organism, or
population and must settle for some hybrid designation" (sect.
1.4). Exactly. Except in boring cases, the analogy fails. Viewing
selection from the gene's perspective is a great advance pre-
cisely because it highlights and explains the complexities that
arise when one force of selection favors a gene and another
opposes it. Some, but not all, of the best examples arise from
conflict between levels of the hierarchy. "Outlaw genes" foster
their own success at the expense of the individual. The disadvan-
tage they pose to the individual selects for opposing "police
genes,' like those that mediate crossing over to separate outlaw
genes from their conspirators. The interesting question at the
heart of W & S's target article is whether the power of group
selection is sufficient to select for genes that cause any apprecia-
ble harm to individual inclusive fitness. The consensus has been
"probably only rarely." One reason, surprisingly not addressed
by the authors, is the fundamental difference between an indi-
vidual organism and all higher levels of organization. All the
cells in the individual share the same genetic information, and
thus have their interests in common. Higher-level vehicles have
genetic differences, so, in all but the most special circum-
stances, genes that favor the interests of the group over the
individual will be replaced by genes that favor the interests of
the individual and its genes.
Conflicts within the level of the individual are equally impor-
tant because they go further toward replacing the notion of an
organism as a perfect creation with a more realistic picture of an
organism as a bundle of compromises, and because such con-
flicts often given rise to disease. In heterozygote advantage, a
gene gives enough of an advantage to some individuals to
outweigh the disadvantages of disease that arise in other individ-
uals who have two copies of the gene. In antagonistic pleiotropy,
a gene offers a benefit and a cost to the same individual. Some,
like DR3, increase the likelihood of uterine implantation and
retention, but later cause disease, in this case, diabetes. Other
genes give a selective advantage in youth that outweighs their
later contributions to senescence. Then, of course, there are
kin-selected genes that code for behavioral tendencies to assist
relatives who share genes identical by descent, thus decreasing
the individual's fitness, but increasing inclusive fitness. Al-
though groups in which kin altruism exists may have an advan-
tage over other groups, the fitness differences that select for kin
altruism are between individuals, not groups, By contrast,
genes that foster reciprocity exchanges impose a cost on an
individual in the short run, but give an advantage in the long run
(depending on the strategies used by other players and the
ability to detect and remember behaviors by others). In all these
examples, the conflict is between two effects of the gene in the
same individual, or between the effects in two different individ-
uals, not between different levels of the hierarchy.
Enough of conceptual and data problems; what are we to
make of the fervor of the quest to demonstrate group selection?
W & S seem determined to demonstrate that human altruism
arises from group selection. I sympathize with their wish. The
discovery that tendencies to altruism are shaped by benefits to
genes is one of the most disturbing in the history of science.
When I first grasped it, I slept badly for many nights, trying to
find some alternative that did not so roughly challenge my sense
of good and evil. Understanding this discovery can undermine
commitment to morality - it seems silly to restrain oneself if
moral behavior is just another strategy for advancing the inter-
ests of one's genes. Some students, I am embarrassed to say,
have left my courses with a naive notion of the selfish gene
theory that seemed to them to justify selfish behavior, despite

Commentary /Wilson & Sober: Group selection
my best efforts to explain the naturalistic fallacy. Is selfish-gene
theory a meme that is toxic to social structures that depend on
commitment to abstract moral principles? I worry a lot about
this possibility and thus sympathize with those who want to
show that human altruism was shaped by group selection. If this
were true, it would help, psychologically at least, to reconcile
our moral feelings with our biological natures. Unfortunately, it
seems to be false.
Nongenetic and non-Darwinian evolution

The hierarchy of vehicles underlying the main thesis of Wilson
& Sober's (W & S's) target article corresponds to the hierarchy
underlying so-called organismic system theory, which explores
analogical features of structure, function, and evolution of an
organism's subsystems (e.g., the cells, tissues, or organs of an
individual) and its supersystems (populations, species, ecosys-
tems, groups, societies, nations, etc.).
In the context of human evolution, this exploration is espe-
cially relevant to the issues discussed by W & S, because it
reveals how our species is unique in a very special sense,
namely, we produce and are subjected to an evolutionary pro-
cess, which is independent of natural selection acting on genes
or on vehicles generated by their action.
Consider the taxonomic tree of languages, a direct analogue of
the corresponding tree of biological taxa. Both trees portray an
evolutionary process. A compelling reason for assuming inde-
pendence of language evolution from biological determinants is
the salience of mechanisms of reproduction and selection appar-
ently unrelated to adaptation in the sense of enhancing the
reproduction of genes.
To fix ideas, consider a possible mechanism of the phonetic
evolution of a language. Let the phone be the "replicator." Let
imitation of the produced phone by other speakers represent
reproduction. Let slight changes in the phone play the part of
mutations. If the changed phone is easier to pronounce and
entails no significant loss of information content, it will be
imitated by more speakers and will eventually replace the
original one (analogues of differential reproduction rates pro-
duced by natural selection). If we suppose that written language
is "more conservative" than speech, we can assume that our
model is corroborated by the abundance of "silent letters" in
English orthography, vestigial parts that have remained func-
tional in German, for example (cf. Knecht - knight; Tochter -
daughter, etc.).
As another example, consider the evolution of artifacts. The
"fossil histories" of implements, weapons, articles of clothing,
vehicles, and so on can be seen in any museum, revealing
striking analogies to the evolution of animals even to vestigial
parts. The "horseless carriage" still had a stand for a whip. The
automobile "reproduces itself quite literally on the assembly
line. Models that sell well enjoy a reproductive advantage and
eventually replace those that do not. Witness the extinct
specimens.
Our examples can be regarded as generalizations of Darwin-
ian evolution in the sense that the processes are driven by a kind
of reproduction and a kind of selection. They can be called quasi-
Darwinian. Evolutionary processes independent of selection
based on differential reproduction rates can be called non-
Darwinian.
Evolution of systems exemplifies such processes. A system
can be defined as a portion of the world that, in spite of far-
reaching internal changes, remains "itself." Surely living indi-
viduals are examples. Their material constituents are continu-
ally replaced, yet their identities are unmistakable. We humans
have direct evidence of our own identity - our memories. There
is no difficulty in assuming continued identity of larger organ-
isms, species, groups, organizations, states, even conceptual
systems like languages, religions, or scientific theories.
Can one ascribe "adaptation" to such systems, on which their
continued existence (preservation of identity) depends? I think
we can if we separate adaptation from competition (i.e., differ-
ential reproduction rate), the most fundamental concept of
Darwinian evolution. This separation justifies calling some evo-
lutionary processes "non-Darwinian" with reference to the level
on which differential reproduction rates do not occur. Thus,
languages can hardly be said to engage in a survival of the fittest
reflected in differential reproduction rates. However, the evolu-
tion of a language can be said to be driven by an internal quasi-
Darwinian process, for example, differential reproduction rates
(imitation frequencies) of phones, perhaps al$o of syntactic and
semantic features. 
.
Adaptation of a system to its environment need not be
manifested in a superior reproduction rate. It can be evidenced
simply by longevity. Successfully adapting' systems are still
around; those that did not adapt are no longer, with us. Consider
a firm, an institution, or a religion, that has preserved its identity
(is recognized as "itself") for a long time. To say that it has been
adapting to its environment is almost a tautology. The interest-
ing question is how. The viability of such a system depends on
the support it gets from its environment. A store needs cus-
tomers, a political party voters, a religion adherents. Support is
mobilized by policies, and these are designed and carried out by
personnel. Consequently, '"adaptation" consists of selecting the
personnel recruited into the system. This is the internal ana-
logue of a "Darwinian" process that enhances the survivability of
the system by guiding its evolution, which on the higher level
appears to be non-Darwinian.
I believe the question of group selection should be defined
with reference to the level of analysis. If selection is defined in
the strict Darwinian sense, then a case against group selection
can be made if the evolutionary success of a group cannot be
shown to be a consequence of differential reproduction rates of
groups. Survivability of groups (at least human groups) need not
depend on reproduction. It does depend on adaptability to
environment, however, and this is where the uniquely human
repertoire of adaptability methods introduces an entirely new
dimension into evolutionary theory.
In directing attention to the vehicle of selection (rather than
fixating on the gene as the fundamental replicator), Wilson &
Sober open the way to a multilevel theory of selection, thereby
providing a theoretical underpinning to group selection. In the
context of the evolution of human social behavior and organiza-
tion, the generalization could go a step further. We can recog-
nize and examine processes that are quasi-Darwinian but not
genetic in the sense of being driven by differential reproduction
of replicators that are not genes. (Learning may be a further
example if we suppose that it is based on differential reinforce-
ment and inhibition of neural circuits.) And we can examine
non-Darwinian evolutionary processes - those driven by adap-
tation to an evolving environment but not by differential repro-
duction rates.

Commentary/Wilson & Sober: Group selection
in evolution, which may depend on the species being studied. To
explore the viability of group selection for altruism, I present fitness
indexes for altruists, nonaltruists, and groups when the parameters of
costs, benefits, and proportion of altruists in a group are varied.
Wilson & Sober (W & S) present a case for "reopening" the
debate about whether group selection played a pivotal role in
evolution. The crux of this debate centers on Williams's (1966)
three major arguments against the viability of group selection:
(1) higher-level adaptations necessitate higher levels of selec-
tion; (2) higher levels of selection are theoretically possible but
improbable; and (3) genes are the fundamental "units of selec-
tion" because they are the basic units of replication. For the
most part, group selectionists and individual selectionists both
agree on the first and third points; higher-level adaptations must
occur at higher levels of selection, and genes are the primary
units of replication. Where the two camps diverge is on the
second point - how probable was group selection in evolution-
ary history? W & S and other group-selection proponents be-
lieve that the probability of group selection was relatively higher
than do advocates of individual selection. Thus, the debate
mainly involves the issue of "likelihood," which, in turn, may
depend on the species under consideration.
Some of the eusocial insects may have evolved in response to
selection pressures at the group level (Seeley 1989). Indeed,
haplodiploid reproduction in Hymenoptera (Hamilton 1964),
which results in sisters sharing three-quarters of their genes
instead of one-half, is a highly specialized adaptation that should
increase genetic variation between groups (hives), thereby in-
tensifying natural selection at the group level. The eusocial
insects, however, are an evolutionary anomaly compared to
most species alive today (Wilson 1971). W & S venture into
deeper and more untested waters when they imply that selec-
tion at the group level might have occurred throughout the
animal kingdom. Consider the case of mammals. During evolu-
tionary history, some mammals (such as humans) probably did
rely more heavily on coordinated groups to raise their young,
hunt and gather food, and defend their territories. Other mam-
mals - especially the more polygynous and solitary ones -
probably did not and could not benefit as much from involve-
ment in groups. Hence, even within a single class of species,
group selection might have influenced the evolution of only
some species. The group selectionist debate, therefore, may
have to be conducted on a species-by-species basis.
W & S argue that individuals and groups can both serve as
"vehicles" that carry genes and, consequently, as entities on
which natural selection can operate. Yet there is a critical
difference between individuals and groups as genetic carriers.
Genes are effectively "trapped" within the individual; the indi-
vidual's fitness is tied directly to whether or not genes replicate
and are passed on to subsequent generations. However, genes
are not necessarily "trapped" within groups, because individuals
can migrate out of disadvantaged groups. Genes in individuals
will usually maximize their own fitness if the individuals maxi-
mize their inclusive fitness, whereas the link between genes and
groups is more tenuous. As a result, natural selection should
have carved more effective and more precise adaptations by
operating at the individual level (see Daly & Wilson 1983).
The strongest evidence that W & S marshall in support of
group selection is presented in Figures 2 and 3. Figure 2 is
particularly interesting because it reveals how altruism could be
selected for at the group level. Unfortunately, W & S did not
systematically vary the three parameters in their model: costs,
benefits, and proportion of altruists in a group. Through varying
these parameters, the conditions under which group selection
for altruism could have evolved become more apparent. The
most interesting and realistic sibling groups involve a mix of
altruists (AA or Aa individuals) and nonaltruists (aa individuals).
Using W & S's equations, I calculated the fitness of altruists
(WA), nonaltruists (Ws), and W & S's Group Fitness Index (GFI)
for mixed groups of N = 10 individuals with costs (c), benefits
(b), and the proportion of altruists (p) set at three levels. Results
are reported in Table 1.
Given how strong selection pressures ought to be at the
individual level (Trivers 1971), W & S's model should be sensi-
tive to some limiting conditions imposed by selection at this
level. Group selection for altruism should not have evolved unless
groups containing some altruists developed and remained stable
over time. On average, altruists should not have remained in, or
continued to contribute benefits to, groups that provided them
with fitness values below those they could attain outside the
group. Thus, when WA dropped below 1, altruists should either
have reduced their level of benefits to the group or left it
entirely. Table 1 indicates that when costs, benefits, and the
proportion of altruists are varied, WA is greater than 1 in only a
few of the scenarios reported. When costs are low (c = .25),
benefits are high (b = 1.0), and when a group has many altruists
(p = .75), the average fitness of altruists, nonaltruists, and the
group are all high. However, as costs increase, benefits decline
and the percentage of altruists declines, the fitness indexes for
both altruists and the group plummet. These data suggest that

Commentary/Wihon & Sober: Group selection
for altruism to evolve via group selection a rather specific set of
conditions must exist. The conditions entail relatively low costs,
high benefits, and high proportions of altruists in groups.
Table 2 reveals how different levels of each parameter influ-
ence the three fitness indexes when fitness estimates across all
levels of the other two parameters are averaged.
As the proportion of altruists in a group declines, the fitness
indexes for altruists, nonaltruists, and the group all decline,
with the relative drop in fitness being the same for altruists and
nonaltruists (.21 fitness units each). Thus, everyone benefits
from more altruists in a group. With increasing costs, fitness
indexes for both altruist and the group decline, whereas non-
altruists are not affected. When benefits decrease, all three
indexes decline, with slightly larger decrements experienced by
nonaltruists (.14 fitness units) than altruists (.11 fitness units).
Except for nonaltruists, the fitness indexes are highest when the
ratio of costs to benefits is lowest (.25, in this set of equations).
Across different levels of these parameters, then, the ratio of
costs to benefits must be relatively low and the percentage of
altruists must be relatively high for groups to remain stable
enough to foster altruism at the group level.
Hamilton (1964) has proposed that altruism should not have
evolved among individuals who shared one-half of their genes
(e.g., siblings) unless the ratio of costs to benefits averaged less
than .50. Table 2 shows that when the average ratio of costs to
benefits is .50, WA equals .96. This finding corroborates the
supposition that the altruist fitness index must be at least 1 for
altruism to evolve within either individuals or groups.
In sum, group selection for altruism is mathematically pos-
sible, but the conditions must be favorable. To strengthen their
case for humans, proponents of group selection must provide
evidence that these conducive conditions existed during evolu-
tionary history and that human groups varied significantly in the
fitness they conferred on their members.

Semantics, theory, and methodological
individualism in the group-selection
controversy
Eric Alden Smith
Department of Anthropology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195.
easmlth@u.washington.edu
Abstract: Though it makes some useful contributions to the debate about
group selection, the target article suffers from several important (laws:
(1) conflating semantical, theoretical, and empirical issues; (2) distorting
the contributions of Dawkins, Williams et al. to this debate; (3) conflat-
ing selection acting on groups with selection of group adaptations; (4)
misconstruing the relationship between methodological individualism
(MI) and self-interest; (5) exaggerating the extent to which MI domi-
nates the human sciences; (6) glossing over some crucial differences
between Hutterite collectivities and eusocial insect colonies; and (7)
failing to advance the group-selection debate beyond primarily semantic
issues.
Wilson & Sober's (W & S's) target article makes some positive
contributions. In particular, I appreciate: (l) its clear and force-
ful statement of a hierarchical theory of natural selection; (2) the
valuable warning against dogmatic denial of the possibility of
group selection; and (3) the useful bibliography. By my evalua-
tion, however, the problems far outweigh the benefits. To wit:
1. Conflating semantical, theoretical, and empirical Issues.
The target article is replete with unsubstantiated empirical
claims that are presented as deductions from a hierarchical
theory of natural selection. For example: "group-level functional
organization is not a 'byproduct' of self-interest in humans any
more than it is in honeybees" (sect. 2); or "group selection is
seldom the only force operating on a trait" (isect. 2.2). These are
very sweeping claims, and each would take many research
lifetimes to test. I return to this general i$sue below.
2. Distorting the contributions of the antl-group-selectlonlsts.
Williams (1966, p. 92; cited by W & S) Argued that "group-
related adaptations do not, in fact exist" - an empirical claim. He
also argued that the processes of genetic replication (via sexual
reproduction) and gene flow (between populations or other
groupings) made selection for individual adaptations a stronger
force than selection for group adaptations t- a theoretical claim
that, if true, would explain the empirical claim. He did not pro-
pound what W & S misname "Williams's first commandment"
(sect. 1.2), though arguably many who accepted his conclusions
without understanding how he reached them might have been
so dogmatic. This rhetorical move trivializes Williams's contri-
bution to the history of biological thought, ,and the substance of
his 1966 book.
Because W & S agree with Dawkins, Williams and others that
only genes are plausible candidates for replicators in biological
evolution, I think it unfortunate that they introduce or perpetu-
ate semantic confusion by referring to those they criticize as
"gene-centered." The term "anti-group selectionists," though
cumbersome, would certainly be more accurate.
W & S rely crucially on the replicator-vehicle distinction, but
they distort the history of this distinction a distinction coined
and theorized, after all, by Dawkins (1976; 1982a), a central
architect of the "gene-centered" approach of which W & S are so
disdainful. W & S agree with the anti-grpup selectionists that
genes are the only reliable replicators in biological evolution.
They agree that it is the "shared fate" of genes in individual
reproduction that is responsible for the evolution of individuals
(collections of genes, and the phenotypes they produce) and of
individual adaptations. Dawkins and others have made consid-
erable effort to explain why evolution acting on genetic replica-
tors could lead to the evolution of individuals, as well as higher
entities such as families, kin groups, and populations. To then
argue (sect. 1.6) that so-called "gene-centered theorists now
concede" that identification of the gene as the replicating unit in
bioevolution is "irrelevant to the question of whether groups can

BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

Commentary/Wilson & Sober: Group selection
be like individuals in the harmony and coordination of their
parts" is quite misleading, in two ways. First, it implies that the
anti-group selectionists have "conceded" some important point
in the debate that weakens their original position; I see no
evidence that they have. Second, even the group-selection
models discussed by W & S do not make the unit of replication
"irrelevant" to identifying evolutionary vehicles, because the
"shared fate" criterion requires that both replicator and vehicle
be specified. This seems to be a clear case of rhetorical hyper-
bole on the part of W & S.
3. What Is group selection? To call evolved traits that favor
certain forms of social interaction "group selection" simply
because the existence of groups alters the fitness of the trait is to
conflate selection acting on groups (and their individual mem-
bers) with selection of group adaptations. As Maynard Smith
puts it:
If [female-biased sex ratios] were a group adaptation, we would
expect the sex ratio produced to be that which is optimal for the
group, but it is not. For the group, the best sex ratio would be more
female biased than it is. In fact, the sex ratio that evolves is the one
that is optimal for the individual, in terms of the number of genes
passed on to grandchildren. . . . The Hamilton ratio is the one that
maximizes individual fitness: it does not maximize group fitness.
(Maynard Smith 1987b, p. 148)
A blindness to this issue pervades the target article, particularly
in the discussion of hypothetical examples and payoffmatrices in
section 1.6. The failure to resolve this issue after two decades of
debate about the new group selection suggests to many of us that
the debate is more about semantics or academic politics than it is
about substance.
4. Conflating methodological Individualism with the self-
interest assumption. W & S assert (sect. 2.2 & 2.4) that the
human behavioral sciences are "dominated" by methodological
individualism (MI) to such an extent that opponents of "psycho-
logical selfishness" are "an embattled minority who must con-
stantly defend themselves against a monolithic individualistic
world view." I believe their position embodies several serious
errors.
First, it does not correspond to contemporary or historical
academic realities. In one or two fields (economics and [parts of]
psychology) MI is surely dominant; but just the opposite is true
in the majority of social science disciplines. And this has been
the case throughout the history of the social sciences. In socio-
cultural anthropology, from Boasian cultural relativism to "per-
sonality and culture" studies in which entire social systems had
"Apollonian" or "Dionysian" styles, on to structuralism, neo-
Marxism, functionalist ecology, and the current theorizing in
which Foucauldian systems of power/knowledge unfold in his-
tory, MI is truly the embattled minority position. A similar
account could be given for sociology, political science, and
history, where a focus on institutions, class interests, gender,
ethnic groups, and nation-states is dominant.
Second, W & S have conflated MI with the assumption that
individuals are driven by self-interest. But MI per se does not
entail an assumption of selfishness or self-interest. Put as simply
as possible, MI asserts that the properties of any group result
from the actions and interactions of its individual members
(Elster 1983; Smith & Winterhalder 1992); this can remain true
even if these individuals are altruistic, dedicated to the collec-
tive good, and so on.
Third, Campbell's (1993) equation of MI with a denial of the
ontological status of groups (cited in sect. 2.2) is an example of
the polemical hyperbole to which some opponents of MI resort;
in my experience, practicing social scientists (as distinct from
philosophers) hardly ever engage in ontological debates about
groups, and adherents to MI rarely deny the "reality" of collec-
tivities. Rather, they deny that such collectivities have agency,
and they insist on "microfoundations" for all explanations of
social and historical process, that is, explanations that proceed
from individual actions (including the historical residues of past
actions).
In defense of MI, I would urge extreme skepticism of phras-
ing or theory that attributes agency to collectivities (as in the
claim that "the hive responds . . . by shifting workers" [sect.
1.4.2] or the discussion of "group-level cognition" in human
groups [sect. 2.5]). Not only do such moves impute conscious-
ness and intentionality to entities where such has never been
demonstrated, but they mask the potential for individual mem-
bers of such collectivities to have conflicting understandings or
intentions and to perform actions at cross purposes. Even where
individual actions and intentions are coordinated to achieve a
collective outcome, there is no justification for attributing
agency to the collectivity, as if it had eyes that see and hands that
move. Finally, such collective coordination is not evidence in
itself of a history of group selection, a point I believe the target
article recognizes in principle but to which it does not always
adhere.
5. The Hutterlte case. I will leave evaluation of the Hutterite
analysis to others more familiar with it. In general, I found
myself relatively sympathetic to the discussion in this section
(2.6) of the target article. I do have two criticisms, however.
First, W & S do not include the hypothesis of cultural group
selection (e.g., Boyd & Richerson 1982; 1985) in their list of
alternative explanations, perhaps because it does not fit neatly
into their dichotomy between self-interest and group-interest.
Second, the social-insect analogy is crucially flawed in that all
Hutterites are expected to marry and raise as many children as
possible; there are no sterile castes (and where these have arisen
in human social systems, generally strong coercion has been
required). This is a critical point, in that it is the reproductive
division of labor that makes group selection a strong contender
for explaining social insect colonies.
6. Where's the beef? There is much conceptual agreement
between so-called gene-centered theorists and the target arti-
cle: only genes make good replicators (in biological evolution).
Vehicles are sets of genes that have a shared fate; selection
creates adaptations at the level of vehicles. So what substantive
contribution does the new group-selectionism bring to orthodox
evolutionary biology? If groups (other than small groups of close
kin) are often vehicles, we should expect to be able to find many
group adaptations, that is, features of groups that evolved to
maximize group fitness. The theoretical work of Hamilton,
Williams, and Trivers has inspired a truly monumental array of
empirical evidence on individual and kin-group adaptations,
running to tens of thousands of publications. The new group
selectionists have been propounding their views since the early
1970s; where is the empirical evidence for the widespread
occurrence of group-level adaptations in nature? My reading of
the literature is that the evidence to date is very thin. Much
effort has gone into scholastic arguments about whether the
evolutionary dynamics of kin interactions first theorized by
Hamilton (i.e., "kin selection") are examples of gene-level selec-
tion or group selection. If trait-group selection models make no
predictions not made by classical kin selection and evolutionary
game theory, then perhaps this is not a very fruitful debate. In
this war of words, I am still waiting for the empirical payoff.
Empirically, the orthodoxy that individuals, dyads, or small
groups of close kin are often vehicles, whereas higher-level
entities are usually not, seems well supported to date. Theoreti-
cally, the reasons seem to be essentially those first identified by
Maynard Smith (1964), Williams (1966), and Dawkins (1976). In
particular, the rate of evolution is generally higher for individual
adaptations than for higher-level ones; and the shared fate
constraint is generally stronger for genes in individuals than for
genes in higher-level vehicles. I do not believe these generaliza-
tions should become dogma (as I realize they have for some), but
in turn I do not believe the target article provides significant
reasons for concluding that they are in error and should be
discarded.

Commentary/Wilson & Sober: Group selection
Vehicles all the way down?
Nicholas S. Thompson
Departments of Biology and Psychology, Clark University, Worcester, MA
01610. nthmpson@vax.clarku.edu
Abstract: One approach suggested by a reading of the target article is
that we jettison entirely the notion of replicator and focus on the
formation and dissolution of vehicles down through the generations.
Wilson & Sober's (W & S's) target article is important because it
reveals some onerous and unnecessary assumptions that have
afflicted the debate about group selection from the start. The
authors successfully debunk the notion that there is anything
privileged about the individual level of analysis. In so doing,
they make explanation at the group level respectable by demon-
strating that any form of argument sufficient to explain adapta-
tion in terms of consequences to individuals will sometimes be
strong enough to explain adaptation in terms of consequences to
groups. This is an important accomplishment.
Perhaps even more important is the doubt that the target
article casts on the assumption that replicators exist distinct
from vehicles. Genes are replicators but they are so by defini-
tion, not by observation. So if there is no such distinct thing as a
replicator, then it follows that there is no such thing as a gene.
Surprising though it may seem, this is a difficulty anticipated by
Dawkins (1976, p. 35) when he writes, "To be strict, this book
should be called not The Selfish Cistron nor The Selfish Chro-
mosome, but The Slightly Selfish Big Bit of Chromosome and the
Even More Selfish Little Bit of Chromosome." If this passage can
be fairly read in terms of his later work (Dawkins 1982a),
Dawkins seems to concede here that replicators are ephemeral.
And to rescue them in this passage, he seems to bring to bear the
concept of "common fate," which, of course, means that he is
defining replicators as W & S define a vehicle.
Should we jettison the notion of replicator entirely and focus
exclusively on the concept of common fate? The hierarchy of
organization would then be conceived as a succession of levels of
organization each with a characteristic degree of coherence in its
elements. And vehicles would be conceived as forming and
dissolving down through the generations. The notion of natural
selection could be retained because, strictly speaking, it does
not require genes or even direct descendants; all it requires is
that the presence of a configuration of elements in one genera-
tion makes more likely the presence of the same configuration in
the next generation. Then, from considerations raised by Wil-
son & Sober, we would expect "organisms" to arise at discon-
tinuities in the degree of coherence between levels of the
hierarchy. Wherever we find a level with a high degree of
coherence nested within a level with a low degree of coherence,
there we should expect to see the evolution of "organisms."

The maintenance of behavioral diversity
in human societies
Christopher Wills

CA 92093. cwllls@ucsd.edu
Abstract: Models of group selection are complex, awkward, and tend to
be balanced on a knife edge of perilous assumptions. Sociologists and
geneticists apply them to something as complex as human society at
their peril. I suggest an alternative model based qn the maintenance of
genetic heterogeneity for behavior within groups. This can occur by
means of slight behavioral alterations in the group as a whole that take
place whenever one type of behavior tends to predominate.
This target article by Wilson & Sober (W & S) gives a detailed
and thoughtful historical survey of the vicissitudes of group
selection as it has been applied to biological systems in general
and to human behavior systems in particular. W & S make the
plea that group selection, despite its chequered history, can be
applied profitably by biologists and sociologists to such complex
systems, to help explain the maintenance of traits such as
altruism that are deleterious to individuals but beneficial to the
group. They also point out that the idea of group selection is
making a comeback among evolutionary biologists. Their pri-
mary human example is the Hutterites, whose unusual social
structure revolves around the Christian ideals of selflessness,
love of one's neighbor, and cooperation td help maintain the
integrity of the group. These traits are, Lord knows, not promi-
nent in the behavior of many human groups other than the
Hutterites. They are, however, present occasionally, a point to
which I will return.
To begin with, there are arguments about group selection that
W & S do not dwell on. One point, as I have discussed elsewhere
(Wills 1989), is that if groups persist for long periods of time
before becoming extinct, then group selection will be excru-
ciatingly slow. A second is that the balance between the individ-
ual disadvantage and group advantage of some genotype must
be a very delicate one - too great an individual disadvantage and
the gene is rapidly lost before it has a chance to persist long
enough to permit the group to survive. These are among the
reasons why many evolutionists feel very uncomfortable about
group selection; to make it work, assumptions often have to be
piled one on another, like Pelion upon Ossa.
W & S list a large number of papers that they claim present
group-selection models, as part of a rising tide of group selection
redivivus. One of mine (Wills 1991), dealing with the mainte-
nance of genetic polymorphism at the MHC (major histocom-
patibility complex) region, is among them. The argument I
made in that paper, one that I am expanding elsewhere with a
colleague (Wills & Green, in press), is not really a group-
selection argument. Let me explain what I meant, and use it as a
jumping-off place for a critique of group-selection models that
assume mixtures of behavioral types that are rigidly controlled
by alleles of genes influencing behavior. These are models of the
kind dealt with by W & S.
My model suggested that genetic polymorphism at MHC, a
set of loci that is at least partially concerned with disease
resistance and susceptibility, might be maintained in the follow-
ing fashion. If an allele conferring susceptibility to a disease
becomes common in the population, then the disease organisms
can multiply and the allele will be driven down in frequency.
Below a certain frequency, the disease organisms have great
difficulty spreading and are forced to retreat to refugia, from
which they can always reemerge. Meanwhile, other alleles rise
in frequency, allowing other diseases tp emerge from their
refugia and drive them down again. Given enough diseases and
enough alleles that are affected differentially by the different
diseases, a stable polymorphism results as the various alleles
pop up and are pushed down.
This is not group selection, for two reaspns. First, the system
works well with just one host population (though it requires a
number of parasite populations). Second, there is an immediate
advantage to an individual living in such a polymorphic host
population. Even though that individual may be susceptible to
one or more diseases, it finds itself in a population with other
individuals that are resistant to those diseases. Those other
individuals keep the numbers of the disease organisms in check,
so that the first individual is less likely to succumb to the
diseases to which it is susceptible. Some hosts do die each
638
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

generation in such a system, but far fewer than if the host
population consisted of only one genotype, which would allow
one pathogen to multiply unchecked and perhaps drive the host
population to extinction.
My guess is that something like this may be operating in
human societies, but with changes in behavior that depend on
the frequencies of other behaviors. The group-selection models
presented by W & S assume that the behavioral types in each
population either do not alter their behaviors or alter them only
under certain precisely specified conditions. There is no feed-
back, though we certainly know that such feedback is plentiful in
human societies. The spread of a particular behavioral pattern in
a human society (all those greedy "Gordon Geckos" of the 1980s,
for instance) eventually makes things so unbearable for the
majority (the rise of homelessness, the increase in crimes
committed by the angry disadvantaged) that the behaviors of
many members of society change slightly and as a result we
move into the "Caring '90s." No appreciable genetic change has
happened in American society in the last 10 years, but there has
been a slight societal correction that gives an advantage (alas,
certainly a temporary one) to less selfish behaviors.
In the M HC model we have proposed, there is a premium put
on genetic diversity. If the MHC alleles are very different from
each other (and they ;ire, by the way; two alleles in the same
population may differ by as many as 20 amino acids), then no
single pathogen will be sufficiently versatile to be able to attack
carriers of the various alleles with equal effectiveness. It may not
be unreasonable to suppose that the same thing applies to
human behaviors: psychologists dealing with perception and
behavior have documented immense diversity in our species, at
least some of which must have a genetic underpinning. We must
add to the model the assumption that there are temporary
reproductive advantages to people exhibiting certain behaviors,
advantages that disappear when these behaviors become too
common.
Much has been made of group selection and altruism. Ob-
vious altruistic behavior is rare in human societies, but if there
are genes that contribute to altruistic behavior, we must all carry
some of them. They need not be maintained by blatant self-
sacrifice; all that is required is a slight shift in the norms of
society, something that is happening all the time. I do not deny
the existence of group selection - it has probably had much to do
with the maintenance of sexual reproduction, for instance - but
I feel much happier about a model that explains the majority of
the diversity of human behavior on the basis of individual
selection. It is so much more effective.

suggests that group selection will be treated as a viable hypoth-

response focuses on: (1) the concept of heritability and fitness at
the group level; (2) clarifying the vehicle concept; (3) empirical
evidence for group selection; (4) genes as replicators; (5) plural-
ism and the sense in which group selection theory is compatible
with the gene-centered approach; (6) additive versus nonaddi-

frequency dependent selection, and Sober's earlier argument
based on causality; (8) the relationship between evolutionary
and psychological definitions of selfishness; (9) egalitarian social
organizations in ancestral environments; (10) culture and group
selection; (11) group selection and the adaptationist program;
and (12) criteria for evaluating group selection theory.
One of our goals was to replace the bogeyman version of
group selection with the actual theory that has developed
over the last twenty years. The largely receptive response
to our target article suggests that we have accomplished
this goal and that group selection will be treated as a
viable hypothesis in future discussions of evolution and
human behavior.
Our reply will follow the organization of the target
article, dealing first with biological issues and then with
implications for the human behavioral sciences.
R1. Biological issues
R1.1. Natural selection as a process that operates on a
hierarchy of units. Questions about the concepts of heri-
tability and fitness at the group level are raised by Alroy &
Levine and Holsinger. Holsinger seems to confuse heri-
tability with the replicator concept when he states that
groups must be replicators in addition to vehicles. Indi-
viduals are not replicators, even though traits are herita-
ble at the individual level, and the same can be said for
groups. Empirically, heritability at the individual level is
measured as a correlation between genetic relatives or as
a response to selection in artificial selection experiments
(Falconer 1981). If genetic effects are made explicit in a
population genetics model, the breeding value of a ge-
notype can be calculated as the sum of the average effects
of its component alleles and narrow-sense heritability can
be calculated as the ratio of the variance in breeding value
to the total phenotypic variance. Variation in breeding
values requires variation in average effects, which is in
turn required for natural selection to occur. Thus, fitness
is heritable at the individual level whenever natural
selection occurs in a standard population genetics model.
Because two-person game theory is mathematically
identical to a diploid single-locus model, with individuals
in groups instead of genes in individuals, it would be
strange indeed if the associated concepts of average ef-
fects, breeding values, parent-offspring correlations, and
narrow-sense heritability could not be frameshifted up-
ward (contra Alroy & Levine). To begin with the simplest
case, assume that Al and A2 are asexual types and that the
payoff matrix in Figure 4a gives the number of offspring
produced as the result of each interaction. We can identify
three "group-types" (A1A1, A1A2, and A2A2) that are the
exact analog of genotypes. Group fitness can be defined as
the total number of offspring produced by the interaction
(WA1A1 = 10, WA1A2 = 8, and WA2A2 = 6). This
definition is straightforward and considerably less ab-
stract than the definition of inclusive fitness, which in-
volves the reproduction of multiple individuals weighted
by the coefficient of relatedness with the actor. As we
mentioned in section 1.6 (para. 10), the average fitness of
Al and A2 is exactly analogous to the average effects of
alleles. The individuals in any group can be traced to two
parental groups, just as genes in an individual can be
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

Response/Wilson & Sober: Group selection
traced to two parents. The progeny that emerge from
A1A1 group-types will randomly enter groups of their
own. As Al individuals, however, they can exist only
in A1A1 or A1A2 group-types, in contrast to the progeny
of A1A2 and A2A2 groups. This means that the fitness of
offspring groups will be correlated with the fitness of
parent groups, exactly as in a population genetics model
and contrary to Holsinger's claim that parent-offspring
correlations do not exist in randomly formed groups.
Without belaboring the point, the entire apparatus can be
frameshifted upward, including the calculation of breed-
ing values and narrow-sense heritability (Wilson & Sober
1989). That is the beauty of the hierarchical approach.
As we depart from the simplest case of two-person
game theory, the details change but the fundamentals do
not. For N > 2 we can still identify an array of group-types
and trace parent-offspring relationships, although each
group now has N parents. As N increases, the difference
between average effects at the individual level and result-
ing narrow-sense heritability at the group level declines,
but this merely restates the well-known fact that group
selection requires genetic variation among groups, which
is inversely related to N. If we model nonrandom group
formation (i.e., kin selection), group-level parent-
offspring correlations and narrow-sense heritability in-
crease along with genetic variation among groups, as they
must, because they are all different ways of expressing the
same thing.
The hierarchical theory makes it obvious that natural
selection at all levels requires variation, random or other-
wise. Kin selection enters group selection theory in
exactly the same way that inbreeding enters population
genetics theory: as a factor that increases genetic variation
among groups/individuals but is not required for
group/individual selection to take place. It follows that
group-level adaptations can evolve in randomly com-
posed groups when selection within groups is sufficiently
weak or selection among groups is sufficiently strong
(Wilson 1990). The same expectation does not emerge
from inclusive fitness theory, which makes relatedness
appear to be a necessary requirement for group-level
adaptation. This is a good example of the simple but
foundational changes that take place when evolutionary
theory is restructured around the vehicle concept.
R1.2. Clarifying the vehicle concept. Many questions
were raised about the concept of vehicles and in retro-
spect, we see how our target article may have contributed
to some of the confusion. We agree with Crantham that it
is important to distinguish between the process of group
selection, which is based on where fitness differences
occur in the biological hierarchy, and the product of group
selection, which is group-level adaptation. No one would
be interested in group selection if it never resulted in
group-level adaptation, so in this sense the debate is
indeed centered on whether groups can be like organisms
in their functional organization. As Grantham notes,
however, the process of group selection should be defined
independently of its product. Group selection can occur
even when it does not result in group-level adaptations,
such as when it is opposed by strong individual selection.
(Goodnights statistical methodology makes this clear.)
The distinction between process and product can be
used to clarify some of the other comments about vehi-
cles. Several authors implied that groups are not vehicles
of selection because fitness differences, are not concen-
trated entirely at the group level (Bradie, Cronk, Den-
nett, Heschl; but not MacDonald, Miller, or Simpson).
This is not true and we never meant to imply it. It is true
that when fitness differences are concentrated entirely at
the group level, the group becomes an Organism in every
sense of the word. As we depart from this ideal, the traits
that evolve reflect a conflict between levels of selection.
The group loses some of its organismic properties but this
does not mean that group selection has Ceased to operate;
it merely is no longer the only force that operates.
Altruism can evolve by group selection even though it is
opposed by individual selection.
The same distinctions can be made,at the individual
level. Dawkins (1989) states that "the essential quality for
an effective gene vehicle is an 'impartial exit channel into
the future, for all genes inside it."' Perhaps, but impartial
exit channels such as the rules of meiosis are the product
of natural selection and should not be used to define the
process. The process of individual-level selection is de-
fined by fitness differences among individuals within
groups, which presumably existed before (and were re-
sponsible for) the evolution of elaborate adaptations such
as the rules of meiosis. The rules of meiosis perfect the
individual as a vehicle of selection by reducing intra-
genomic conflict, but they do not define the individual as
a vehicle of selection. Similarly, when the rules of meiosis
are broken by "outlaw" genes, we do not say that the
among-individuals selection ceases to operate, only that it
is opposed by among-gene selection within individuals.
Against this background, we think that Dennett's criti-
cal comments lose much of their force, Dennett empha-
sizes the fact that cells within a multicellular organism
have a common ancestry, whereas the numerous parasites
and microbes that share the same body do not (see also
Nesse). However, common ancestry per se is not relevant
to the evolution of functional organization. The genetic
elements that make up a single cell do riot have a common
ancestry in sexually reproducing organisms, but this does
not prevent them from interacting harmoniously. In addi-
tion, if cells within a multicellular organism become
genetically diverse by mutation, the problems of within-
individual selection arise even though all cells are derived
from a common ancestor. Indeed, Buss's (1987) inter-
pretation of development suggests that competition
among cell lineages within an organism must be carefully
managed despite the fact that they are all derived from a
single egg. Parasites evolve to act entirely in the interests
of their hosts if parasite transmission is entirely vertical
(offspring transmitted only to host offspring). The prereq-
uisite for functional organization in all of these examples is
shared fate, regardless of common ancestry. Dennett's
main point is that natural selection is concentrated almost
entirely at the individual level for genes/cells in an organ-
ism but only partially at the group level for parasites in
hosts and human individuals in groups. We agree, and
tried to emphasize the same point ourselves. We hope
Dennett will agree that group selection can be a signifi-
cant force even when it is not the only force. Further-
more, the balance between levels Of selection varies
widely on a trait-by-trait basis and examples can be found
640
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

Response/Wilson & Sober: Group selection
in which group selection is the predominant force in both
parasite and human groups. As a technical aside, group
selection in parasites should not be equated with mutual-
ism between the parasites and the host, because parasites
can also cooperate with each other to subvert the host
(e.g., Wilson 1977b).
We are fortunate to have both Hull and Dawkins
comment on our use of the vehicle concept. Hull basically
agrees with pur position, but points out differences be-
tween his own concept of interactors and Dawkins's con-
cept of vehicles, which we treat as the same. Our usage is
closer to Hull's, because it is based on fitness differences
and not on development per se. Thus, genes can be
vehicles (as we use the term) in addition to replicators and
it is hard to think of cases of intragenomic conflict in any
other way. However, it seems to us that Dawkins's use of
the term vehicle is based on fitness differences in addition
to development (cf., the rowing crew metaphor), so he
may not agree with Hull's characterization.
Dawkins remains so near, yet so far. He cannot see the
cricket pair as a vehicle of selection, despite the fact that
we deliberately fashioned the example after his own
rowing crew metaphor. He says:
There is no vehicle of selection in this case. It is a terrific
vehicle-undermining example. Natural selection favours rep-
licators that prosper in the environment. The environment of
a replicator includes the outside world, but it also includes,
most importantly, other replicators, other genes in the same
organism and in different organisms, and their phenotypic
products. Cricket genes, for cooperating in the presence of
another cooperating cricket, prosper. This statement is true
and illuminating, in precisely the same sense as the statement
that genes for thick, hairy coats prosper in the presence of
snow. Like snow, each cricket is part of the environment of the
other one's genes.
We could not ask for a better summary of the gene-
centered view. The question is, are vehicles of selection
absent from this account or have they merely been recon-
ceptualized as environments of the genes? The answer to
this question is obvious at the individual level, because
Dawkins acknowledged long ago that individuals can be
vehicles of selection, (and therefore organisms) despite
the fact that they are also environments of the genes. The
answer is just as obvious at the group level in our cricket
example, although Dawkins may decline to acknowledge
it. This passage does not refute the existence of vehicles,
but merely assumes that the vehicle concept can be
dispensed with and that natural selection can be studied
entirely in terms of average genie effects. Yet, in the very
same commentary, Dawkins states that "the group-
selection controversy ought to be a controversy about
groups as vehicles." We hope that the reader can see the
contradiction even if Dawkins cannot.
The example of figs and fig wasps that Dawkins intends
as a challenge is nothing of the sort. He seems to think it is
comparable to our cricket example, but it cannot be
accommodated within a game theory framework because
there are no such things as fig-fig and wasp-wasp groups.
Wasps cannot replace figs in the population in the same
way that cricket types can replace each other in our
example. More generally, the sense in which highly co-
evolved predators and prey share the same fate as species
is completely different than the sense in which genes in an
individual vehicle or individuals in a group vehicle share
the same fate. See Goodnight (1990a; 1990b), Wilson
(1976; 1980; 1992a) and Wilson and Knollenberg (1987) for
examples in which multispecies communities can be
properly viewed as vehicles of selection.
R1.3. Empirical evidence for group selection. "Where is
the empirical evidence for group selection?" Smith and
Nesse ask. One answer is "female-biased sex ratios,"
which we mentioned briefly in section 1.4 (para. 7) and
Note 11, but Smith and Nesse are unconvinced. We must
therefore review the extraordinary history of this subject
in more detail: (1) Williams (1966) used sex ratio as his
best empirical test of group selection theory. He argued
that group selection should favor a female-biased sex ratio
to maximize the productivity of the group. Natural selec-
tion within groups should favor an equal investment in
each sex as predicted by Fisher's sex ratio argument.
Williams was unaware of any examples of female-biased
sex ratios and concluded that no evidence existed for
group selection. He was so impressed with his test that in
the concluding section of this book (p. 272) he stated, "I
would regard the problem of sex ratio as solved". (2) One
year later, Hamilton (1967) reviewed many empirical
examples of female-biased sex ratios and proposed a
theoretical model to explain their evolution. There can be
no doubt about the metapopulation structure of Ham-
ilton's model (italics in original):
Free-moving females search for isolated food objects, or
"hosts." Each host is colonized by a certain number and is
eventually exhausted through feeding of the progenies. The
subpopulation of adults reared on a host mates randomly
within itself; no males successfully mate outside their own
group. Inseminated females emigrate to take part in pop-
ulation-wide competition to discover new hosts.
Nevertheless, Hamilton did not compare fitnesses within
single groups but used a game-theoretic approach that
averaged fitness across groups. (3) The study of female-
biased sex ratios became a hot topic in evolutionary
biology at the same time that group selection entered its
dark age. The theory was elaborated and dozens of new
empirical examples were discovered. (4) Colwell (1981)
showed that the assumptions of Hamilton's model con-
form exactly to Williams's original test for group selection.
In other words, female-biased sex ratio alleles decline in
frequency within groups and evolve only because they
increase the productivity of the group. The so-called
optimal sex ratio is in fact an equilibrium sex ratio that
reflects the balance between levels of selection. The
equilibrium is influenced by a number of factors, some
that were included in Hamilton's model (e.g., number of
individuals colonizing the group) and some that were not
(e.g., population regulation within groups prior to dis-
persal). Thus, the group selection model of sex ratio both
reinterprets the original model and makes predictions
that were not forthcoming from the original model. (5)
Charnov (1982) and other authorities on sex ratio quickly
accepted Colwell's interpretation but Maynard Smith
(1987a; 1987b) and others staunchly maintained that
group selection is absent from Hamilton's model. The
Maynard Smith passage quoted by E. A. Smith contains
two errors that become obvious when we take vehicles
seriously. First, the sex ratio that maximizes group fitness
is not expected to evolve unless group selection is the only
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4
641

Response/Wilson & Sober: Group selection
evolutionary force. The beauty of sex ratio is that it
measures the relative intensity of within- versus between-
group selection. Any deviation in the direction of female
bias that evolves for the reasons identified by Hamilton's
model demonstrates that group selection is a measurable
force. Second, if the term "individual fitness" means
relative fitness within groups, it is the Fisher ratio, and
not the Hamiltonian ratio, that maximizes individual
fitness.
Recently, Williams (1992, p. 49) himself has acknowl-
edged that female-biased sex ratios constitute empirical
evidence for group selection: "I think it desirable, in
thinking about organisms for which the haystack model is
descriptive, to realize that selection in female-biased
Mendelian populations favors males, and that it is only the
selection among such groups that can favor the female
bias." Perhaps we can look forward to general agreement
in the future, but the entire episode can be used to make a
more general statement. Just as group selection can be
made to disappear from a theoretical model by averaging
the fitness of individuals across groups, so also can it be
made to disappear from empirical studies. As soon as we
take vehicles seriously by comparing fitness within single
groups, group selection becomes an empirically well
supported theory, not only for sex ratio but for many other
traits (see Table 1 entries marked with an "E"). It is
exasperating to have Smith accuse us of blindness on the
matter of sex ratios and then innocently ask "where's the
data?"
R1.4. Genes as replicators. In our target article we con-
centrated on showing that the replicator concept is irrele-
vant to the group selection controversy. Griffiths & Gray
and Thompson are sympathetic to this conclusion but also
want to criticize the replicator concept itself. We agree
that genes no more replicate themselves than do the
pages fed into a photocopier. Genes (pages) get repli-
cated, but to say that they are replicators is to mischarac-
terize the causal process.
Thompson asks whether there is any point in retaining
the replicator concept. Although we think that this con-
cept needs some fine-tuning, we still think it answers a
fundamental question concerning the unit of heredity
(see also Crow). When offspring resemble their parents,
and do so for reasons not attributable to shared environ-
ment, we attribute this resemblance to genes. The idea
that there must be a physical mechanism that mediates
this parent-offspring resemblance is what leads to the idea
that there must be one or more "units of heredity." Genes
subserve this function; this is the privileged status they
have in evolutionary processes. In saying this, one leaves
open the characteristics of the mapping between genes
and phenotypes. How large a strand of DNA must one
consider before it becomes sensible to describe the phe-
notypic effect of that strand? This is the empirical issue
that Dawkins was thinking about when he reflected on the
longer but more accurate title for The selfish gene to
which Thompson refers. Dawkins recognized that there is
a trade-off between the longevity of a strand and its
phenotypic power. This is an important point, but it does
not undermine the idea that genes are units of heredity.
R1.5. On pluralism. In the form of pluralism Holcomb
advocates, group selection theory and "broad-based indi-
vidual selection" are observationally equivalent. We think
a legitimate form of pluralism exists but that it does not
extend to substantive empirical questions such as the
nature of organisms or whether groups Can be like organ-
isms (Wilson & Sober 1989). For example, Dawkins's
(1982a) necker cube metaphor implies that the gene's-eye
view and the individual's-eye view are equivalent ways of
looking at adaptations. This is not true for all adaptations,
however, because there is no way to interpret meiotic
drive and other forms of intragenomic conflict as adapta-
tions at the individual level. In addition, the gene's-eye
view cannot deny the fact that individuals are organisms
(when they are vehicles of selection) without being just
plain wrong. There is no room for pluralism on these
substantive empirical issues. We are basically advocating
that a group-level face be added to the necker cube.
Group-level adaptations can be represented at the indi-
vidual and gene levels by averaging the fitness of lower
level units across higher level units. Gerte- and individual-
level adaptations cannot be interpreted as group adapta-
tions without committing the errors of naive group selec-
tion, but the gene's-eye view and the individual's-eye
view cannot deny the existence of group-level adaptations
(when groups are vehicles of selection) Without being just
plain wrong. Thus, despite a weak forrh of pluralism, the
answers to the most substantive questions are not just a
matter of how you look at things. The reason we use the
term "vehicle" in our target article, rather than the term
"unit" as it is unambiguously defined within the group
selection literature, is to force gene-centered theorists (or
broad-based individual selectionists, to use Holcomb's
term) to realize the logical consequences of their own
framework.
R1.6. Additive versus nonadditlve Interactions. We have
reviewed the philosophical literature on levels of selec-
tion elsewhere (Sober & Wilson 1994) but will comment
here on the additivity criterion proposed by Wimsatt
(1980) and Lloyd (1988), as requested by Hull. Basing his
ideas on the holistic concept that "the whole is more than
the sum of its parts," Wimsatt suggested that levels of
selection can be defined on the basis of nonadditive
interactions among genes in individuals or individuals in
groups. Although this suggestion has been taken up by
Lloyd and several other authors, it fails to capture even
the most basic elements of the group selection contro-
versy. For example, altruists have a purely additive effect
on group fitness in the standard group selection model for
the evolution of altruism. The additivity criterion would
deny that the group is a unit of selection in this case.
Furthermore, according to the additivity criterion, het-
erozygote intermediacy would count as an example of
gene-level selection and dominance would count as an
example of individual-level selection, even though adap-
tations that are good for the individual will evolve in both
cases. It is true that any organism worthy of the name will
have elements that interact nonadditively (as stressed by
Griffiths & Gray, Heschl), but these do not define the
process of group selection. We therefore cannot agree
with Lloyd that our framework is similar to hers, at least in
this respect.
R1.7. Group selection and causality. Several authors have
raised questions about the relation of the target article to
the causal characterization of the units-of-selection prob-
642
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

Response/Wilson & Sober: Group selection
lem in Sober (1984). Contrary to what Alroy & Levine,
Smith, and Wills have said, we have not defined group
selection so broadly that it includes all forms of frequency
dependence; the proposal in Sober (1984) was deliber-
ately set up to avoid this consequence. For example, Wills
describes a scenario in which genetic diversity is main-
tained by selection against common genotypes. This sce-
nario does not invoke group selection because it can take
place within a single group and does not require a meta-
population structure at all. We cite Wills (1991) in Table 1
for his interesting suggestion (pp. 213-14) that group
selection has influenced the maintenance of genetic poly-
morphisms at the major histocompatibility complex
(M HC) region and not for the more general scenario about
frequency-dependent selection that he develops in his
commentary. More generally, the need to invoke group
selection can quickly be determined by asking whether a
metapopulation structure is required for the trait to
evolve.
Alroy & Levine go on to suggest that our talk of shared
fate and of fitness dilferences at various levels constitutes
two quite independent conceptions of the units-of-
selection problem. We disagree. The individuals in a
group have shared fate only if the survival and reproduc-
tion of some depends on the survival and reproduction of
the others. Shared fate is a causal concept in which the
relevant effects have to do with fitness. And, as our
procedure makes clear, it is essential that there be varia-
tion in fitness at a level if there is to be selection at that
level. As a result, Alroy and Levine's putative counterex-
ample to our idea - that objects at all levels in the earth's
ecosystem have the same fitness - does not work.
Bradie thinks that our characterization of the units-of-
selection problem in terms of the idea of "common fate"
ignores the distinction between "selection of" and "selec-
tion for" (Sober 1984). Although we grant that the idea of
common fate requires more elaboration than space per-
mitted us to provide, we believe that this is not a serious
problem. If individuals in the same group are "in the same
boat," this is because there is some common influence on
them or interaction among them that has this fitness
consequence. This is where the idea of "selection for"
finds its application.
The criterion for discerning group selection given in
Sober (1984) is, we believe, consistent with the formula-
tion defended here. However, Sobers application of that
criterion contained an inconsistency. As we have argued
in the present article, it is important to treat the relation
of genes to organisms in the same way one treats the
relation of organisms to groups. Sober (1984) follows the
shared fate idea when it comes to thinking about group
versus individual selection but gets muddled when the
issue of genie versus individual selection is considered
(Walton 1991).
As we mentioned in Note 2, our target article reviews
group selection at a very elementary level. Many of the
issues raised by the commentators have been treated in
detail by other authors or by us in other papers. We hope
the reader will make use of Table 1 to become familiar
with the primary literature.
R2. Group selection and human behavior
We are delighted that a number of commentators not
only accepted the vehicle-based framework (Burghardt,
Cloak, Dupre', Dugatkin, Frank, Gilbert, Grantham,
Hyland, MacDonald, Miller, Rapoport, Thompson) but
also used it to make points that we wish we had discussed
in our target article. Dugatkin shows how cultural trans-
mission of information about cheaters can alter the bal-
ance between levels of selection. Miller stresses that
some forms of competition within groups can also be
advantageous at the group level (see also our Note 24). In
addition, the equalization of fitness within groups can
take the form of a lottery, in which case the extreme
difference in outcomes between winners and losers does
not signify extreme within-group selection. This is similar
to the "lottery" that causes some cells to enter the germ
line and others to enter the somatic line (Buss 1987).
Similarly, the comparison between group-level rules of
meiosis and the veil of ignorance in Rawls's (1971) theory
of justice (Dennett, Miller) is fascinating and should be
developed. The connection between group selection and
sexual selection made by Miller and MacDonald is impor-
tant and should be explored for nonhuman species in
addition to humans. We agree with Gilbert and Hyland
that the psychology behind group-level adaptations in
humans involves more than "altruism" as usually con-
strued. Brace, Campbell & Gatewood, and Moore were
skeptical about some aspects of the framework but also
made valuable points about human groups as potential
vehicles of selection.
R2.1. Evolutionary and psychological selfishness. The
following passage from Cronk shows that a very basic
issue has not yet been fully resolved:
W & S choose the Hutterites to demonstrate that group
selection has been important in the environments of human
evolutionary adaptedness. In fact, the Hutterite example
does just the opposite. In the first place, there is nothing very
"selfless" about going along with a system that virtually
guarantees you several times the reproductive success you
could enjoy outside the system.
Cronk does not regard the Hutterites as selfless be-
cause they are more successful (reproductively) than non-
Hutterites (see also Frank, Moore). We regard the Hut-
terites as selfless because they achieve their success by
benefitting a collective, of which they are a part. Cronk
does not compare fitness differences within groups and
therefore ignores the concept of vehicles that forms the
basis of our entire target article. Our purpose is not to
castigate Cronk, however, but rather to discuss why the
view he represents is so tenacious.
When a trait evolves by causing the gene to benefit the
genotype it belongs to, it is easily classified as an example
of individual selection. When a trait evolves by causing
the individual to benefit the group it belongs to, any
model that treats group selection as a process analogous to
individual selection will classify it as an example of group
selection, yet there is great reluctance to accept this view.
We think the reluctance can be traced to a dissonance
between evolutionary and psychological definitions of
selfishness. Superficially, everyone familiar with the sub-
ject knows that evolutionary definitions are based on
fitness effects, whereas psychological definitions are
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4
643

Response/Wilson & Sober: Group selection
based on the motives of the actor (Batson). Nevertheless,
there is a deeply held assumption that the two definitions
will roughly correspond to each other. In other words,
what counts as selfish in an evolutionary model is assumed
to correspond to what a psychological egoist interested
only in his own reproductive success would decide to do
in the same situation. This assumption is violated by the
Hutterite example, because a psychological egoist would
evaluate the options and decide to be a Hutterite. It
therefore seems strange to call the Hutterites selfless in
an evolutionary model.
One way to resolve the dissonance is by changing the
definition of group selection (e.g., Nunney 1985b), but
this destroys the analogy between group and individual
selection. Alternatively, we can retain the theory of group
selection as a process analogous to individual selection
and accept the dissonance between evolutionary and
psychological definitions of selfishness. After all, they are
based on completely different criteria and perhaps we
were naive to expect otherwise. A relationship between
the definitions presumably exists, but it might be more
complex than a one-to-one matching between traits that
evolve and the decisions that a psychological egoist would
make in a similar situation. For example, why should
humans care about motives as long as the people they
interact with are being nice to them at the moment? The
obvious answer is that knowledge of motives helps predict
how others will behave in the future and in different
situations. A selfishly motivated person may be nice now
but is likely to change; an altruistically motivated person
will remain nice across most situations. Thus, even
though psychological definitions appear to be based on
motives, in a more subtle way their significance depends
on long-term effects. Furthermore, the relationship be-
tween motives and effects is not a one-to-one correspon-
dence (selfish people are not nasty all the time) but rather
a more general correspondence when effects are averaged
over many situations. If we replace the term "being nice
to others" with "increasing the fitness of others," we have
a relationship between evolutionary and psychological
definitions of selfishness that is complex, rather than a
one-to-one matching of behaviors with motives. We think
that a really selfish motivated personality, who tried to
maximize relative fitness within groups in all situations,
would have gone extinct long ago. The personality we call
selfish is in fact a flexible strategy that includes evolution-
ary altruism in its repertoire but is sufficiently prone to
exploit others within groups that it cannot be trusted by a
person trying to predict future behavior (Frank 1988).
More generally, we think it is important to preserve the
analogy between group selection and individual selection
as mechanistic processes. If the products of within-group
selection do not correspond to the decisions of a psycho-
logical egoist, that is something to be explored rather than
avoided.
So far, we have argued that the social behavior of the
Hutterites can be a group-level adaptation even if a
psychological egoist decided to be a Hutterite. The ques-
tion of what actually motivates people such as the Hut-
terites is a separate issue (e.g., Cronk, Frank). Consider a
psychological egoist and a psychological altruist within a
Hutterite society. Even though the egoist has decided to
be a Hutterite because it is his best option, it does not
follow that he will fare better than the altruist. For the
many decisions that must be made on a daily basis, if the
adaptive choice is almost always to benefit the group, then
a direct calculus of group interest will arrive at this choice
faster and with fewer errors than a more tortured calculus
based on self-interest. It is simply more efficient to be
an altruist. Thus, communal social organizations can pro-
vide an environment that selects for psychological al-
truism, not only culturally but biologically (Campbell
& Gatewood). The Hutterites are not necessarily selfish
just because a selfish person would decide to become a
Hutterite.
Campbell & Gatewood think the biggest challenge for
group selection theory is to explain suicidally altruistic
behavior on behalf of groups that are not composed of
close kin. This is indeed a challenge but we think it is
peripheral to the main enterprise of studying group-level
adaptations in all of their forms, altruistic and otherwise.
For example, the social convention of drawing straws is so
mundane that no one bothers to think about it, but it
becomes interesting when we examine its effects on
fitness differences within and between groups. It begins
with a situation in which an individual must sacrifice his
welfare to benefit the group. Such behaviors are regarded
as altruistic when performed voluntarily and are usually
thought to evolve only when the group is composed of
kin. However, the social convention of drawing straws
allows the same behaviors to be performed among non-
kin. Because the "altruist" is chosen by a lottery process,
the costs and benefits of altruism are equally shared in a
probabilistic sense, eliminating fitness differences within
groups (Miller). We no longer call the behavior "altruistic"
in a psychological sense, but we should still recognize it as
a group-level adaptation because groups that draw straws
succeed as a collective, relative to groups that do not. In
fact, drawing straws should be successful whenever the
benefits for the recipients exceed the Cost for the donor,
whereas voluntary sacrifice toward relatives must be dis-
counted by the coefficient of relatedness. Interactions
among unrelated individuals who draw straws should
therefore be more "altruistic" than voluntary interactions
among genetic relatives!
As it turns out, unrelated individuals in close-knit social
groups often do not draw straws but vie with each other to
be altruistic in situations that require personal sacrifice.
Evidently there are other social conventions that are even
better at promoting sacrificial behaviQr among nonrela-
tives than drawing straws. However, in addition to study-
ing these social conventions (Campbell & Gatewoods
challenge), we must also learn to see mundane social
conventions such as drawing straws in a new light.
R2.2. Ancestral environments: Some commentators
(Cronk) but not others (Hyland, Moore) dispute our claim
that egalitarian social conventions similar to those of the
Hutterites exist in tribal societies. This is such an impor-
tant subject that we will provide an example from Boehm
(1994) that shows how decision making in tribal societies
can be a group-level process in which fitness conse-
quences within groups are carefully regulated. Boehm is
quoting from Meggitt's (1977) monograph on Mae Enga
raiding and warfare in Highland New Guinea.
Meggitt (1977) explains that it is only the men who meet, very
quietly; anyone who has passed through the bachelor's asso-
644
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

ciation is eligible, and it is taken for granted that everyone
will choose to participate. Pooling of information is important:
The men who initiated the conference, or their spokesman,
briefly indicate their view of the clan's position and the
action they favor. Thus, they may argue that now is the time
to launch a full-scale attack on the neighboring clan with the
aim of occupying a specific section of its territory. The major
Big Man then solicits responses from the audience. Ideally,
everyone present has a voice and, being among his own
clansmen, can speak with complete freedom. Moreover,
anyone who possesses pertinent information has a moral
obligation to contribute so that the group may reach the
best possible decision in the circumstances. Most men . . .
are ready to make their points at length and with elaborate
oratorical flourishes . . . The task of the Big Man at this
stage is to insure that all have a chance to offer their
opinions and facts in full, and . . . [to make] no attempt to
cut off any but obviously irrelevant speeches.
Only in this way, it is believed, can each clansman truly
ascertain the thoughts of his fellows and the evidence
behind them. So instructed, he can cling to or modify his
own ideas, and his reactions in turn affect those of others.
Naturally, the Big Men and fight leaders have their own
opinions of an appropriate outcome of the discussion; but
none of them, especially in the early sessions, reveals much
of his hand or tries patently to push for the acceptance of his
suggestions. Not until hours of argument have clarified the
issues and carefully dissected the facts are these men likely
to signal unequivocally their own positions, and even then
those, including the major Big Man, who perceive the tide
running strongly against them may well go along with the
emerging majority view. Thus, step by step the slow pro-
cess of constant feedback inches toward the possibility of
general agreement on a correct course of action. Then,
when the Big Man believes that consensus is close at hand
and that further talk will add nothing of value, he incisively
summarizes the main arguments, indicates which have
been rejected, and finally announces the decision reached
by the clan. (pp. 77-8)
Sometimes . . . real consensus is impossible to achieve.
For instance, although most of the assembly, including the
Big Men, agree that . . . war is the only feasible choice, sig-
nificant minority may hold out against this view. When it is
clear that no amount of exhortation will change their opinion,
the Big Man announces that the pro-war majority will pro-
ceed with preparations for an attack; but he warns them that,
having overruled the opposition, they must be ready to pay
most of the costs - in particular, compensation for allied and
enemy deaths will fall mainly on them. At the same time he
reminds the cautious minority that those who do not fight in
support of the clan's interests cannot expect to enjoy the fruits
of victory - enemy land that the clan may seize or any homi-
cide pigs coming to the clan. The dissidents acknowledge the
force of the warning while emphasizing their own prerogative
of contributing few or no pigs to the homicide compensation.
To understand this consensually oriented decision making
process and the relation of words to deeds, it is important to
examine not only the debate but the practical behavior that
follows:
. . . even as both parties are making clear their positions,
everyone knows that, because the clan's survival may be at
stake, once combat begins the doves will almost certainly
be in their accustomed places fighting strenuously along-
side the hawks. Moreover, many of them will probably join
in the payments of homicide compensation, not merely to
establish claims to whatever wealth the clan may secure but
also, and equally important, to maintain their own reputa-
tions and that of the group. (Meggitt 1977, p. 79)
Response/Wilson & Sober: Group selection
This account describes several egalitarian social con-
ventions. The leader is not an autonomous thinker who
imposes his decision on the group but rather part of a
feedback process that involves all members of the group
and takes hours to produce a decision. Decision making at
any level requires a weighing of alternatives, which is
inhibited by social pressures to conform. These pressures
are relaxed during the decision-making process but
strongly imposed afterwards, creating a behaviorally uni-
form group that acts as a unit. It is hard for natural
selection to act within groups when there is no behavioral
variation within groups for it to act on (Boyd & Richerson
1985; 1990b)! When groups cannot reach a consensus,
creating important behavioral variation within groups,
the costs and benefits associated with the alternative
behaviors are carefully regulated. Doves cannot exploit
Hawks by sharing the spoils of war, and Hawks cannot
exploit Doves by expecting them to share the costs.
Finally, nepotism within the group is conspicuously ab-
sent, although the entire group may be a kinship unit
relative to other groups.
We agree that humans are often nepotistic in tribal
societies but in some contexts they seem to avoid nepo-
tism in favor of egalitarian social organizations and even
scorn nepotism in a manner that resembles the Hut-
terites. The specific contexts in which nepotism is ex-
changed for egalitarianism call for study but seem to
involve enterprises that require relatively large groups of
people to perform successfully - warfare, collective labor,
and hunting for large game where the probability of
individual success is low. To these we might add the
more nebulous but equally important contexts of decision
making and memory for culturally transmitted informa-
tion, which may be more successfully accomplished by
relatively large groups. All of these contexts existed
throughout the human past, perhaps favoring an evolved
capacity to construct and live within egalitarian social
organizations.
The fact that human groups usually fission along kin-
ship lines is not an argument against group selection and
even improves the conditions for group selection by
increasing genetic variation among groups. Human
groups (including religious groups) often fission in re-
sponse to a conflict of interest within, the group. In this
case the fissioning event is not part of the egalitarian social
organization, as it is with the Hutterites, but reflects the
failure of the social organization to be egalitarian. Sim-
ilarly, the fact that fitness correlates with status in many
societies is not, by itself, an argument against group
selection. As Miller notes, some forms of reproductive
competition within groups can actually be favored by
group selection. These broad patterns, which are pre-
sented as evidence against group selection, are being
described at too coarse a scale. We must evaluate the
fitness consequences of traits within and between groups
with greater precision before we can decide how they
evolved (Simpson). Finally, we are not trying to interpret
all aspects of human behavior as products of group selec-
tion. Some of the evidence against group selection, such
as the existence of fitness differences within groups, may
well turn out to he evidence against group selection when
it is examined in more detail. Our suggestion is that the
Hutterites are an extreme example of an evolved facul-
tative capacity, which means that comparable social orga-
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (1994) 17:4

Response/Wilson & Sober: Group selection
nizations will be found only in some human groups and
for some contexts but not others. We think group selec-
tion has been a strong force but not the only force in
human evolution. We tried to make this point clearly in
our target article but evidently we must make it again and
again.
R2.3. Culture and group selection. We did not do justice to
cultural influences on human behavior in our target arti-
cle and welcome the opportunity to treat them briefly
here. (See also Brace, Campbell & Gatewood, Griffiths
& Gray, Rapoport, Smith.) Cultural explanations are
often treated as an alternative to evolutionary explana-
tions (Tooby & Cosmides 1992). The evolved mind is
supposed to set very broad limits on human behavior
(e.g., hunger and sex drives) but culture rather than
evolution explains how humans behave within these
limits. Batson uses this reasoning and his comments are
therefore directed against human evolutionary psychol-
ogy in general rather than group selection theory in
particular.
Two more recent views of culture and evolution have
emerged over the past two decades. In the first, culture is
modeled explicitly as an evolutionary process in which
alternative cultural units (variously called "memes," "cul-
turgens," and so on) replace each other by differential
transmission. The process of cultural transmission is influ-
enced by the innate structure of the mind, which creates a
complex relationship between genetic and cultural evolu-
tion. Cultural evolution acts partially in the service of
biological fitness, or else the genes that shape cultural
evolution would not have been selected over their alterna-
tives. On the other hand, cultural evolution has its own
transmission rules and is not expected to favor the same
behaviors as genetic evolution in each and every case.
Even within genetic evolution, a variety of transmission
rules exist that select for different traits (e.g., maternal vs.
bi-parental inheritance). We can expect an even greater
diversity of outcomes when cultural traits are inherited
not only from parents but also from peers, teachers, and
so on (Brace, Rapoport; also see Boyd & Richerson 1985;
Findlay 1992).
When cultural evolution takes place in a metapopula-
tion, the level at which the cultural units are selected can
be analyzed in the same fashion as genetic units. Thus,
invoking culture does not make group selection go away
but merely changes the details. For example, Boyd and
Richerson (1985; 1990a) model conformity as the cultural
transmission rule, "imitate the majority behavior in your
group." This rule eliminates behavioral differences within
groups and therefore concentrates cultural evolution at
the among-group level. Some authors have concluded
from this and other models that cultural group selection is
more powerful than genetic group selection, perhaps
accounting for the high degree of prosocial behaviors in
humans (e.g., Campbell 1994; see also Dugatkin, Rap-
oport, Smith). We consider this conclusion premature
because it depends on the details of the transmission
rules. Even the conformity rule makes it difficult to
understand the origin of variation among groups, because
mutant cultural traits must somehow become frequent
enough within a group to be imitated by others and
persist. (A possible solution to this problem is offered
below.) As another example, the transmission rule "imi-
tate the most successful person in your group" will favor
behaviors that maximize cultural fitness relative to others
within the same group and will be totally insensitive to
group-level consequences. Even when cultural traits do
spread via the survival and reproduction of whole groups,
their rate of evolution can be very slow (Soltis et al. 1992).
Natural selection in metapopulations is a. complex process
for both cultural and genetic traits, making simple gener-
alizations elusive.
According to the second, more recent view of culture
and evolution, "culture" has been overextended as an
explanation of human behavioral variatipn. As a provoca-
tive example, Tooby and Cosmides (1992) ask us to con-
sider a population of sophisticated juke boxes that are
distributed over the globe. All juke boxes are identical,
have thousands of songs stored in their memory, and are
equipped with a clock and sensors that rrteasure longitude
and latitude to the nearest degree. The juke boxes are
programmed to use the date and position on the globe as
environmental inputs that determine which song is
played. The juke boxes therefore play the same songs
within locations, different songs between locations, and
the songs at each location change over time. If the juke
boxes were humans and the songs were behaviors, we
would regard these differences as "cultural," yet there is
no cultural transmission or even individual learning in
this example. Tooby and Cosmides and Other contributors
to Barkow, Cosmides and Tooby (1992) portray the human
mind as a sophisticated juke box with many "Darwinian
algorithms" that evolved to solve important adaptive
problems in ancestral environments and are triggered by
appropriate environmental stimuli.
Although the juke box metaphor is obviously a carica-
ture of human psychology (as Tooby and Cosmides ac-
knowledge), it does reveal that our vocabulary for describ-
ing differences between cultures is impoverished. Few
people would classify innate context-dependent behavior
as cultural, yet, as our previous sentence attests, it is hard
to avoid using the word "culture" when discussing human
groups that behave differently from each other. Tooby and
Cosmides (1992) propose a more complex vocabulary that
should be considered when discussing examples such as
the Hutterites.
These two views of culture and evolution are not yet
well integrated with each other. Cultural evolutionary
models are derived from population genetics models in
which the transmission rules are very simple. This may be
a good starting point but real transmission rules are
probably like Darwinian algorithms in their complexity
and adaptive design that guides cultural evolution to
biologically adaptive outcomes. Tooby and Cosmides usu-
ally treat the environment as a mere button-pusher and
have not yet integrated open-ended processes of individ-
ual learning and cultural evolution into their view of
evolutionary psychology. We think that when the middle
ground is explored, at least some complex transmission
rules will be highly favorable for cultural group selection.
For example, Boehm's (1994) account of the Mae Enga
quoted above shows that groups can be behaviorally
uniform, as in Boyd and Richerson's conformity model,
and also have the capacity to change their behavior as the
result of a rational decision-making process.

R2.4. Group selection and the adaptatlonist program. It is
suggested by Wills that the study of group-level adapta-
tions in humans will be exceptionally difficult. We agree
in part, but we also wish to emphasize some of the simpler
insights that can be achieved by group selection theory.
It should not be forgotten that our target article is
basically a view of how to pursue the adaptationist pro-
gram, which is remarkable for its simplicity and not its
complexity. When we ask questions about the adapted-
ness of traits, we must recognize that functional design
can exist at more than one level of the biological hier-
archy. In addition to asking, "What would individual
organisms be like if they were well adapted?" we must
ask, "What would groups be like if they were well
adapted?" These two questions bracket the possibilities
and the actual outcome of natural selection will lie some-
where in between. The alternative procedure, of denying
the existence of group-level adaptations even as we peer
at them through the distorted lens of individualism, is not
acceptable.
Complexities arise when we pursue any particular
adaptationist hypothesis, but there is no reason to assume
that these are insurmountable. We think the best way to
begin is by ignoring proximate mechanisms and focusing
on fitness differences at the phenotypic level (Goodnight).
For any trait that is expressed by humans or other species,
our procedure makes it relatively simple to determine the
fitness consequences of that trait, relative to other traits,
at various levels of the biological hierarchy. For example,
it is easy to show that female-biased sex ratios are selected
against within groups and favored at the group level. The
only alternative procedure is to average the fitness of
lower-level units across higher-level units to reach the
bottom-line conclusion concerning what evolves. We
hope we have convinced the reader that these two proce-
dures are different ways of processing the same informa-
tion and cannot be used to argue against each other. In
particular, using the averaging approach does not consti-
tute evidence against group-level adaptations. If we are
interested solely in the bottom-line conclusion of what
evolves, the averaging approach may be computationally
simpler. However, if we are interested in determining the
level(s) of functional organization, there is no alternative
to monitoring natural selection separately at each level of
the hierarchy before calculating the bottom-line conclu-
sion of what evolves.
Knowing the fitness consequences of traits at the phe-
notypic level tells us what would evolve by natural selec-
tion if the environment were held constant and the traits
had a simple genetic basis. Of course, most human behav-
iors do not have a simple genetic basis. There is no gene
for pulling our hand away from the fire, but we still
express the behavior under appropriate circumstances
and it is biologically adaptive to do so. Natural selection
has obviously endowed us with proximate psychological
mechanisms that, to some extent, cause us to do the right
things at the right times. Theories in traditional psychol-
ogy (e.g., operant conditioning) require this assumption
as much as theories in evolutionary psychology (e.g.,
cheater detection modules); the only difference is the
assumed sophistication of the psychological mechanisms
(Symons 1992; Tooby & Cosmides 1992). The next stage in
the analysis therefore is to investigate the nature of these
Response/Wilson & Sober: Group selection
proximate psychological mechanisms. The question is:
"How must we modify this investigation to accommodate
group selection?" The answer is: "Not much." Our proxi-
mate mechanisms should be sensitive only to the evolu-
tionary success of behaviors and not to the level(s) at
which they succeed. The social convention of drawing
straws succeeds at the group level, but our proximate
psychological mechanisms make it seem as reasonable to
us as pulling our hand away from the fire. Abandoning
one's personal identity for a group identity may feel great
and appear reasonable in some situations, but the advan-
tages of behaving that way exist at the group level. More
generally, if a given behavior would evolve by group
selection, our proximate mechanisms should cause us to
express that behavior under appropriate conditions, just
as if it had evolved by within-group selection. This re-
turns us to the point we made earlier, that a theory of
proximate psychological mechanisms does not map di-
rectly onto a theory of natural selection as a hierarchical
process. The fact that we feel like doing something emo-
tionally or decide to do something cognitively means at
most that it was, on balance, evolutionarily successful in
ancestral environments. The level at which it succeeded
can be determined only by examining fitness effects.
To summarize, group selection theory does not make
the adaptationist program insurmountably difficult. The
main modification is to monitor natural selection sepa-
rately at each level of the biological hierarchy before
calculating the bottom-line conclusion of what evolves. In
any case, there is no alternative if we want to determine
level(s) of functional organization in humans and other
species.
R2.5. Evaluating group selection. As we stated in our
target article, the group selection controversy would
make a fascinating case study for historians of science (see
also Burghardt, Dupr6). Moore cites the prominence of
the "holdouts" as evidence that group selection has not yet
"won over biology." We never claimed otherwise and what
we did say is accurate: "a large group of knowledgeable
biologists who are perfectly comfortable with the hier-
archical approach . . . coexists with another large group
whose members adhere to the earlier view" (sect. 1.6,
para. 13). Both groups contain prominent biologists, so
reputation and expertise do not explain the persistence of
the controversy. It is important to remember that the
group selection controversy in biology is a manifestation
of a more general conflict between group and individu-
alistic perspectives that exists throughout the human
sciences and in everyday thought. Biologists are closer
to a resolution than anyone else, and it is possible that
group selection theory itself will explain why group- and
individual-level perspectives tend to coexist in human
thought. In any case, appeals to reputation are no substi-
tute for a direct evaluation of the theory (Burghardt).
History has shown that great scientists with well-deserved
reputations are sometimes wrong and sometimes never
change their minds. We hope that readers will not wait for
the major gene-centered theorists to give their assent
before evaluating group selection theory for themselves.
