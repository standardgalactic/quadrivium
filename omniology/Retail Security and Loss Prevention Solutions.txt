FOREWORD
The authors of this book set out to write an introduction to retail loss preven­
tion mainly directed at college students in the criminal justice field of study. 
Many fine universities offer criminology, police science, and corrections and 
prepare students for a career in the public service sector. We recognized the 
shortage of private-sector preparation available to the student in criminal 
justice who may want to specialize in asset protection, loss prevention, or 
security management. Preparation for those careers is usually not found in a 
university’s business management school. A few universities are starting to 
recognize that preparation for private-sector criminal justice careers is a new 
niche to be filled. Our intent was to make this study of problems and solu­
tions available as an introduction to the field so students could decide if they 
were going down the right path and if retail loss prevention interested them.
As the book progressed, we also recognized the recurring theme of a 
culture of integrity being central to a successful loss prevention program. 
This book is very appropriate for recent criminal justice degree gradu­
ates who find themselves on the private-sector side of law enforcement 
and in the retail industry. There is a lot to learn in those initial few years 
to be successful and to feel comfortable functioning in loss prevention 
in a retail establishment. Much of what graduates take from the crimi­
nal justice school does not prepare them to be loss prevention managers 
handling problems in retail business. Understanding how a loss preven­
tion department works and what a culture of integrity is will make the 
transition so much easier. We hope this book will help raise questions 
and inspire readers’ thought processes to make them curious in the right 
directions so they might find the answers they need.
We have assembled our very best theories and experiences from a 
combined 45 years of experience in retail loss prevention from a number 
of businesses. We have brought thought-provoking discussions from a 
group of professionals and experts in their fields to the pages of this book 
to enhance the learning experience. We hope anyone who reads this book 
will come away with an understanding of retail loss prevention, the most 
prominent problems, and some of the available solutions. We hope read-
ers will understand what a culture of integrity is and how important it is 
to the retail business as a whole and to the loss prevention department, 
which must be the catalyst for integrity in the organization.

An Introduction to Retail 
Loss Prevention
Those outside of the business rarely understand the complexity of retail 
loss prevention. When members of the general public are provided with 
a brief synopsis of what goes into being a loss prevention professional, 
they often correlate the position with a security guard. As we know, the 
job of a security guard usually entails safeguarding people and property, 
as does the job of a loss prevention professional. But it is at this point 
where the similarities end and how each profession achieves the goal var­
ies drastically.
To articulate the profession of loss prevention by associating it with 
known professions, it is necessary to take components such as accounting 
practices, forensics, fraud detection, human behavior analysis, and inter­
view and interrogation skills into account. Many retail loss prevention 
professionals do not initially set their sights on entering the business of 
loss prevention. Rather, many are pursuing degrees in criminal justice, 
business administration, or related fields while in college and happen to 
fall into the career. Often they start off as store detectives and move up 
through the ranks.
The position of store detective teaches that no one is exempt from the 
potential of thievery. From business executives to nuns and drug addicts, 
the different classes of society that engage in deviant behavior seem to 
be endless. As store detectives begin to gain tenure with their organiza-
tion, they also gain experience in understanding the motives behind the 
actions of the individual. Some people shoplift because they don’t have

the means to provide for their family or themselves, whereas others steal 
to support addictions. In today’s society shoplifting has advanced drasti­
cally to organized retail crime (ORC) in which participants are no longer 
individuals; rather, a criminal enterprise exists with multiple players who 
have individual roles. The topic of organized retail crime will be explored 
in great depth later in the book.
From shoplifting in department stores to shoplifting in the grocery busi­
ness, the pattern of human behavior remains the same: only the type of prod­
uct being stolen differs. Recognizing who is going to steal eventually becomes 
instinctual. Store detectives can watch a front door of a store or a camera sys­
tem and pinpoint individuals who are entering for one purpose: theft. The 
recognition process is not based on clothing, race, and gender; rather, it is 
based on the physical behavior of the individual. The way a person walks or 
the way his or her eyes are moving plays an important role in the recognition 
process. Knowing who is going to steal before it happens is the first step in 
protecting the company assets. From there, concealment, consistent surveil­
lance, and the apprehension will soon follow. Loss prevention managers usu­
ally teach store detectives all of the components of the business.
As store detectives gradually move to higher positions, they begin 
to get more involved with the other ways losses can occur besides exter­
nally—internally and operationally. Employee theft is the biggest con­
tributor to shrinkage in retail, accounting for approximately 42.7% of all 
losses, according to the 2008 National Retail Security Survey conducted 
by Dr. Richard Hollinger from the University of Florida. It is also the most 
difficult to control. It can be summed up as, “If there is a will, there is a 
way.”
In 2008, The National Retail Security Survey Final Report says retail­
ers experienced shrinkage of 1.51% to sales, and that translates to roughly 
$36.6 billion in retail lost annually. This is the national average. Each year 
organizations spend millions of dollars on theft detection and prevention 
devices such as exception reporting, cameras, and article surveillance, 
yet they still incur losses at the hands of their own employees. The most 
important and pressing question isn’t how theft occurs because investiga-
tions easily answer that question. The important question is why employ-
ees bite the hand that feeds them and their families. This is the area where 
loss prevention professionals truly learn the different types of motivators 
between those outside and those inside the organization who cause losses 
to an organization.
A later chapter disucsses the theft triangle, which entails the compo-
nents necessary for theft to occur. The triangle includes low deterrents,

opportunity, and motivation. The first two—low deterrents and opportu­
nity—are closely shared by people and employees who cause losses to an 
organization. But the motivation behind the actions of employees is much 
more complicated than that of people from the outside (Figure 1.1).
This book will delve heavily into the motivational factors that contrib­
ute to organizational shrinkage. It is important for retailers to understand 
that an employee who is on a mission can defeat even the best, most expen­
sive deterrent systems. While tackling the topic of motivation, readers will 
learn how a philosophy can change the entire spectrum of employee dis­
honesty. It is not much different from the one adopted several decades ago 
by the New York City transit authority. The subway system had a terrible 
problem with crime, including vandalism, and nothing seemed to deter 
it. Two individuals, David Gunn and William Bratton, with a totally dif­
ferent philosophy on how to handle crime and reorganization stepped in 
to curb the problem. These individuals didn’t add cameras or high-tech 
devices on the subway, nor did they have undercover agents to increase 
payroll on the trains. To be completely honest, they didn’t deal with the 
most significant crimes at all. That may seem ludicrous, but it worked. 
They dealt with the graffiti on the trains and with turnstile jumpers. Each 
believed that the overall presentation of the subway system as a whole 
was the driving force behind the crimes being committed. It is true, there 
were small issues that eventually led to bigger issues. They contended 
that if everything preceding the crimes could be changed, perhaps the 
crime itself would not occur. Getting people to think this same way about 
retail loss prevention can put organizations on a path to eradicating losses 
due to employee theft.

The title Loss Prevention implies that losses are being stopped before 
they occur. In most cases by the time the event reaches loss prevention the 
damage has already been done. At this stage of the situation it is time to 
recoup the losses and get rid of the problem. If organizations learn more 
about the behavior that precedes an event, more losses can be prevented. 
Loss prevention is a discipline of learning and applying deterrent princi­
ples in light of what was learned to stop further occurrences of loss. Later 
chapters will discuss theoretical perspectives so readers can understand 
research being conducted on the topic of employee deviance. Chapters 
to follow will also explore ways to control employee dishonesty through 
impediments and will provide ways to build an ethical infrastructure 
within the organization.
Prior to 2002, organizations could make their own choice as to whether 
to prevent fraud. Employers controlled their own financial statements as 
they wished. The Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 now holds organizations 
that are publicly traded in the United States accountable for preventing 
fraud and being able to prove to the government that they are doing so. 
The law also mandates that all financial disclosures have been reviewed 
and certified as accurate by the top executives of the company. Specifically, 
Section 404 of the act includes retailers in its scope. Noncompliance by 
organizations can lead to hefty fines and can include imprisonment for 
executives. Now more than ever the need for well-trained loss preven­
tion professionals is in demand. Later chapters will discuss selecting the 
right individuals for the job and how to build a loss prevention depart-
ment, should you ever have a chance to do so. Some parts of the book will 
provide the fundamentals for individuals entering the business of loss 
prevention, whereas other parts will cover the more integral components 
for those who have many years of experience. The book will educate on 
the topic of retail loss prevention through real-life case studies and inter-
views with people involved in the business and will discuss the problems 
as well as the solutions for businesses as a whole.

The Root of the Problem in 
Retail Business Cultures
Promises, Promises
From the first interaction with a new hire, agreements are starting to be 
made. The employer tells the new hire what the job entails, and the new 
hire absorbs all the information as it is being said. The new hire is also 
walking into the job with certain expectations. Neither the employer nor 
employee declares that a contract is being made, but essentially that is 
what happens during the conversations (Figure 2.1).
The creating of the contract doesn’t end at the hiring stage; rather, 
it continues throughout employment. Agreements such as initial wage 
may be very concrete, but other promises may not be so clear. Some made 
between employee and employer do not include words. The silent prom­
ises are based on one’s own expectations about how the other should 
behave. For instance, the employee is thinking, “My boss should treat me 
with dignity and respect; in turn, I will treat my boss and others with dig-
nity and respect.” The employer is thinking, “The new employee should 
show up to work on time everyday, and that is how I will know that the 
new employee is reliable and can be considered for advancement.”
Another type of agreement is the implied promise. The employer 
implies that something can happen but does not clarify the conditions 
that need to occur for it to happen. The employer may know that he or she 
does not have what the would-be employee wants at this time and may

never have it but alludes to the potential that it can occur. Consider the 
following example:
An employer must fill the open position. The person applying for the job is looking to 
be in management, but the open position is nonmanagement. The employer has no evi­
dence that a management position will open in the near future. The interviewee tells the 
employer that he really would like to be in management to consider taking the job. The 
employer tells him that if he takes the entry-level position a management spot could open, 
and he will be the first to be considered. The employee goes into the position thinking 
he will soon be in management. The employer recruited the candidate she liked, but at 
what cost?
Yet another type of promise is made for the current condition. The 
employee tells the employer during the interview that it is impossible 
for her to work certain days of the week because of personal reasons. At 
the time of the interview, that promise can be kept because the employer 
has enough resources to allow the employee not to work those days. The 
Factors leading to dissatisfaction:
Poor pay
Poor compensation
Poor work conditions
Lack of promotions
Poor beneﬁts oﬀering
Lack of job security
When these conditions are optimal,
job dissatisfaction will be eliminated.
However, these factors do not increase
job satisfaction.
When these factors are optimal, job
satisfaction will be increased.
Factors leading to satisfaction:
Good leadership practices
Good manager relationship
Recognition
Advancement
Personal growth
Feedback and support
Clear direction and objectives
Fulﬁllment
Commitment
Engagement

employer cannot be certain that things will never change but does not 
tell the employee that if staffing should change she might have to work 
the days. Instead, they agree that the employee will not have to work the 
days, and she takes the job with the perception that she will never have to 
work those days.
So what happens when there is a broken promise or what would oth­
erwise be considered a breech in contract? We will share the story of Bob 
and his broken promise.
Bob worked for an organization for over 10 years; He was a great employee and was 
already in a lower-level management position. One day Bob’s boss left the company, and 
Bob became indirectly in charge of managing the location. He eagerly picked up where his 
boss left off and assumed the duties without being asked. The organization knew that Bob 
really wanted to be a higher-level manager because he spoke of it frequently.
Bob came in early and stayed late to get his current job plus his new job done. He put 
in many hours and regularly communicated with his supervisor, who was previously his 
supervisor’s supervisor. During the conversations Bob was told what a great job he was 
doing filling the roll of the manager and that the organization really appreciated all of his 
hard work. When Bob asked for an increase in salary, his supervisor told him that she was 
working on it. Months went by with Bob working an excessive number of hours and still 
no pay increase. One day Bob’s boss walked into the location and introduced him to his 
new supervisor.
The look on Bob’s face said a million words. Bob could not believe that he worked 
two jobs for one salary all of those months under the pretense that he would become the 
manager of the location and now was being introduced to the person who just took his job. 
Bob did not receive so much as a call letting him know that he would not be getting the job; 
rather, just a few days before the introduction he was again told what a great job he was 
doing. An organization he trusted and loved had just let him down in the worst way. He 
thought if someone had the nerve to call him and let him know before they slapped him in 
the face it might have been a little easier. Bob began to think of all the time he lost at home 
working the excessive hours in the hopes that he would soon receive a bigger salary and 
new position. The supervisor told the new manager what a great job Bob did in holding the 
store together and that he will be a great resource in the location. Bob was of the opinion 
that the supervisor could take all of her lip service and give it to the new person.
Bob was no longer the Bob everyone knew over the last 10 years. He was disgruntled, 
angry, and disappointed. Bob knew he wanted to get back at the organization and his 
supervisors for what they did to him, so he figured out a way to do it. He decided that he 
would compensate himself for all the extra hours he put in by doing fraudulent returns. 
At random, when a customer paid for product, Bob would go into the register and refund 
the amount in cash. Bob would pocket the cash and continue working throughout the day. 
Bob felt better that he was getting something back for all of his hard work and rationalized 
that he was doing to the organization only what had been done to him. He was eventually

caught and terminated and shared his story during the loss prevention interview with the 
individuals investigating the case.
Bob’s story isn’t much different from many others who had simi­
lar treatment in the workplace. Bob believed he would be getting more 
money and the management position because his supervisor allowed 
him to believe that. If the supervisor had told Bob up front that he wasn’t 
going to be the manager but had asked for his help during the interim, 
the outcome would have been much different. But the supervisor knew 
that she needed Bob to work the extra hours to ensure that all the work 
would be done, so she allowed Bob to believe things she knew were not 
going to happen. A tenured employee who gave so much to the organiza­
tion became another statistic in the loss prevention department because 
of broken promises.
Loss prevention professionals who don’t take the time to learn about 
cause and effect in the workplace are missing out on understanding the 
bigger picture. An inexperienced person could have discounted the causes 
behind Bob’s story by not delving deeper into the situation. Conversations 
about dishonesty should not end at the point where an admission is 
reached. They should continue until the interviewer has an absolutely 
clear understanding of what led this individual down a path that would 
ultimately cost him his job.
Societies as well as the employees within the workplace are very quick 
to position themselves for the company and against the individual who 
committed the act of dishonesty. It is true that everyone has a choice to 
steal or not to steal, but there are always contributing factors to the result. 
Loss prevention people need to be consistently assessing the contributing 
factors to make change for the good.
Often overlooked are actual or implied promises by employers to 
employees. This may happen mainly because it may not be an immediate 
issue. For example, say someone needs money for rent on Friday, so he 
steals the bank deposit on Thursday. When the interviewer asks that ever 
so daunting question of why he did it, the answer seems clear and sim-
ple: He needed money, so he took it from the first place an opportunity 
presented itself. The answer provided by the interviewee is one that is 
believable and understandable because it relates to basic needs. This rea-
son is also easily accepted by the organization because according to what 
is conveyed, the organization did not play a role in the person’s decision-
making process.

The beginning of the chapter discussed an employee being promised 
she would not have to work certain days of the week. These particular 
conversations usually take place before employeees actually begin work­
ing at an organization. If the broken promise is what actually caused the 
dishonesty and the event did not occur until later, it can be considered 
a delayed issue. It is difficult for some organizations and interviewers 
to believe that one simple conversation about something such as a work 
schedule can lead someone to steal. Even when told, organizations tend to 
shrug at something like this and can cause someone to take such action. 
Again, it is easier to blame the individual alone than to deal with the big­
ger picture.
When sales get sluggish, the first item to be addressed is account­
ability. Training department members will begin to focus on programs 
that hold management and employees accountable for the condition of 
the organization. They will develop new or modify existing coaching and 
counseling methods to produce results. If the company was not extremely 
results-oriented before the sales slowed, it will certainly adopt the meth­
odology after the fact. Thousands—if not millions—of dollars will be 
spent on consultant research, program development, and implementation. 
The goal of the organization is to increase sales and to regain investor 
confidence in the reliability of the organization. Employees are put under 
extreme pressure to deliver results. Their productivity levels are closely 
monitored, and their superiors scrutinize individuals responsible for the 
districts or regions. At this point in the organization’s life cycle, it is either 
swim or sink. To those who fly at 10,000 feet above store level, the answer 
seems to start at middle management and below. During this phase, some 
jobs will be eliminated, and individuals will begin to crack under the 
pressure, in turn resigning from their positions. Many wonder how the 
organization’s leaders allowed things to get to this point and why it was 
not disclosed prior to everything getting so bad. No one comes forward 
to truthfully declare all the circumstances that led to the organization’s 
current condition; rather, it is assumed that starting at store level will fix 
it. Some organizations will recover from their predicament, whereas oth-
ers will perish.
Accountability or ownership for results is nothing new in the business 
world. In fact, it is easy for an organization to implement an atmosphere 
where accountability is paramount to gaining necessary results. One 
would think that organizations are eager to hold individuals accountable 
for all their actions, but that is not the case. Managers who make silent 
promises, implied promises, or promises made for the current conditions

are often not held accountable at all. Most organizations pay little or no 
attention to this topic and do not realize how much impact these prom­
ises have on employees. If organizations were able to remove the blinders, 
they might realize that perhaps executive-level promises led to the cur­
rent condition of the organization, not front-line employees’ inability to 
sell product.
Organizations need to take the time to train supervisors on not mak­
ing promises and having truthful discussions. “Desperate times call 
for desperate measures” should not apply to hiring individuals. When 
loss prevention finds out during the course of an investigation that any 
of the three promises were involved with the situation, action should be 
taken based on that information. Loss prevention members who are not 
currently probing for how it all began need to start assessing the topic. 
Training employees who supervise others on proper conversations—the 
do’s and don’ts during the hiring process—is important. It must be under­
stood that when something is implied to an employee, it is taken to heart 
and expected to happen. Proper education regarding promising conversa­
tions can lessen the number of employees who engage in deviant behavior 
as a result of what they believe should have happened.
MONKEY SEE, MONKEY DO
Supervisory-level employees are always on display. Every move they 
make is being observed and monitored by store-level employees. Without 
even uttering a word, their actions or inactions are being taken in by sub­
ordinates and used as a lesson learned. Once an employee sees how a 
supervisor reacts to something, the employee learns the level of tolerance 
that will be accepted for that particular situation.
An example of this is attendance. If an employee comes in late, other 
employees are waiting to see how the supervisor reacts. If the supervisor 
does nothing, the supervisor ultimately declares that coming in late is 
acceptable. Employees believe management condones this type of behav-
ior and that they too can do it. In turn, this teaches employees that a slight 
deviation from the rules will be tolerated. Employees will monitor what 
happens to each of their co-workers for similar infractions. They will 
gauge if preferential treatment is occurring by what happens to each indi-
vidual and if they are all held accountable the same way.
There are implications both for inaction and for treating employees 
differently. Employees begin to think that if supervisors accept a deviation 

T he Root of the Problem in Retail Business Cultures

from policy for attendance they will also accept a deviation in other cat­
egories. Employees will also monitor who is getting away with what and 
how often. In all retail environments there are great, good, and not so good 
producers. It is often found that the great producers are held less account­
able for infractions than are the not so good producers. The reasoning for 
this inequality of accountability is simple: managers do not want to lose 
their top-performing people for any reason because it impacts sales and 
them directly. It is also known that managers will challenge terminations 
for their top producers by finding reasons for counseling rather than a ter­
mination. If an employee is not producing, a loss prevention investigation 
is kindly welcomed. But if the person is a high producer, a loss prevention 
investigation is often frowned upon.
Although employees do not know what happens behind closed doors 
between a manager and employee, they can guess fairly well as to the 
dialogue taking placed based on many different factors. For instance, an 
employee shows up to work 10 minutes late, and the manager immedi­
ately asks the employee to come into the office and closes the door. Others 
on the sales floor know what is going on, but no one has said a word. This 
type of immediate action makes a statement to employees that the man­
ager will address violations in policy and will not let them go. In turn, 
employees who thought about being late know the outcome before they 
do it. As long as everyone receives the same consequences, the manager is 
building a foundation that does not accept bad behavior. Even worse than 
not holding other employees accountable for rule breaking is managers 
themselves breaking the rules. They can hold every individual account­
able in the store for violating policy, but if they engage in the same action 
without consequence, the morale in the store will begin to deteriorate and 
disgruntlement will set in.
A case study involving region X demonstrates the “Do as I say, not as 
I do” methodology.
Region X is situated in the southern half of the Midwest territory of Company A. Sales 
were stable; the region was not the worst or the best. Many working in region X were 
long-term employees. Some had been with the organization for more than 20 years. The 
region also did not have much manager turnover. For the most part this region ran under 
the radar. For someone from the outside looking in, the perception initially was that the 
leadership was consistent and doing a good job. Times became tough within the organiza-
tion, and there was a demand to increase the key performance objectives within the stores 
for the entire company. Region X had not reported many issues related to loss prevention, 
and not many investigations took place in this market.

All of that changed one day. The usual loss prevention investigation took place for a 
case of money loss; it did not seem out of the ordinary compared with any other case 
where employees committed acts of dishonesty for various reasons. What was different 
about this one is that it opened the floodgates for others to happen, or so it was believed. 
After the resolution of one case, many followed. The unique correlation between the cases 
was that almost all directly involved were management-level employees. Another unique 
component was that the cases were not related in any way other than that the managers 
belonged to the same region and that there were small time gaps between the incidents. 
Because the actual crimes being committed varied drastically from stealing money to fal­
sifying statistics to theft of services, it was not easy to pinpoint the exact problem. There 
were some common denominators but it was unclear why. During one of the investiga­
tions, a manager who was helping gather the necessary documentation was asked, “What 
is going on in this region to cause all of this dishonesty?” It was like a weight had been lifted 
off this manager’s back. She responded by providing the underlying cause as she and her 
peers saw it.
It was questionable why it took so long for everything to come to the forefront in this 
region because the lack of ethics by leadership was so apparent. Violations in ethical judg­
ment, such as passing employees up for promotions based on likes and dislikes to expecting 
managers to cover multiple locations on one salary in excess of six months, were frequent 
occurrences. The regional supervisor left threatening voicemails, which explained why no 
one was willing to come forward. The manager also discussed content of routine confer­
ence calls held by the supervisor. An example of the calls were managers asking questions 
directed the content of conference calls with this supervisor. Someone in the region would 
ask a question directed to the supervisor on how to increase the store performance objec­
tives that he or she knew was against company policy. The supervisor would not indicate 
that no one should cheat to reach a goal; rather, he would say every store needs to reach 
its goal and however it gets done is how it gets done. 
The information received over the next several months during the investigation was 
not only shocking but disappointing as well. During some of the dishonesty interviews, 
the managers indicated that their supervisor had driven them to take action against the 
organization. People felt violated and alone in their battle against one person and reacted 
in a way that was adverse to the organization. After an extremely lengthy investigation and 
documentation gathering, the supervisor was eventually terminated for his actions.
It was believed that all the managers who lasted throughout this ordeal would be 
thrilled and would immediately be able reach their full potential because the weight had 
been lifted. However, the morale was still low, and people just seemed depressed.
The manager who provided the information that led to the termination of the supervi-
sor was asked why things were not improving as quickly as they should. She stated that it 
was not that easy to recover from what they all went through. She said the situation was 
analogous to a woman or child who is being abused by a loved one. Statistics show that 
many women will go back to their abuser even after the abuser has been punished for the 
crime. She said that the managers who remain seem to be lost without the supervisor and 
scared as to what will happen without him. They all knew what he was doing was wrong, 
but for whatever reason they had learned to accept it. This was strange, but it was reality

for those who lived it. To make matters even worse, years after the situation concluded 
in the region and the supervisor was gone, the manager who was so insightful and had 
provided all this information ended up stealing back deposits and was terminated. Although 
the investigator who handled the original case did not handle this one, a fellow investigator 
stated that the manager who took the deposits mentioned the whole ordeal and could not 
understand why she herself engaged in dishonesty. 
Region X illustrates the downward spiral that can take place if some­
one who leads others does not have integrity. At no point during any of 
the conference call conversations did the supervisor tell anyone it was 
okay to steal or tell anyone to violate the rules, but his own actions as well 
as the questions he did not address gave everyone who was listening the 
answer. The Region X case study demonstrates the extreme end of what 
can happen when employees observe their supervisors being unethical. 
Most of the time, so many people will not lose their jobs and an entire 
region will end up in turmoil.
Region X represents a situation where employees observe behavior 
and adjust their behavior to accommodate the conditions. Therefore, it can 
be assumed that managers who always hold their employees accountable 
for their actions will have an area that thrives and that ethical standards 
will be followed by all. This is both true and false. It is true that managers 
who do not tolerate rule breaking and address it immediately will have 
fewer employees engaging in deviant behavior. However, this is false if 
how managers handle the rule breaking is a violation.
We will go back to the example of tardiness because it is one of the 
most prevalent forms of policy violation in a retail environment. The 
employee walks into the store late, and the manager decides to immedi­
ately address the situation. But this time the employee is not taken into 
an office. This time the manager yells at the employee in front of all her 
peers and whoever else can hear. Yes, the situation is being addressed, but 
this scenario can be worse than not addressing it at all. The employee on 
the receiving end of the hostility is embarrassed and feels violated and 
angry. The employee has a couple of choices: either yell back or accept 
the behavior and walk away, depending on her personality type. Both 
have their own set of ramifications. Others who witness this act are very 
clear that tardiness will not be accepted, but they have also lost respect for 
the person who leads them. Employees want to be respected, and in turn 
they will respect others. If they are treated like children being disciplined 
by their parent, all the respect for their supervisor goes away. A lack of 
respect for superiors leads to different forms of deviance that are more

difficult to catch quickly. Employees who respect and have loyalty for a 
person or organization are much more likely to remain honest than those 
who lack respect and do not have a vested interest in their workplace. If 
the manager believes he was right in his actions and does nothing fur­
ther, resentment sets in for the employee receiving the incorrect form of 
discipline.
So far we have covered employee observation and behavior adjust­
ment and incorrect disciplinary action that leads employees down a path 
that will negatively impact the organization. The last part of this section 
is probably the most frequent improper performance and least to be rec­
ognized. The next few paragraphs will discuss managers who are not fol­
lowing operational controls but are not necessarily violating the policy as 
already covered herein. Among the three departments, loss prevention, 
human resources, and operations, many controls and best practices are 
set forth that will help prevent, deter, and eliminate dishonesty. When 
operational audits are conducted, the decencies within a location become 
extremely apparent. It is logical to believe that if managers are not follow­
ing the controls put in place to combat dishonesty, the likelihood of them 
being able to identify it lessens. But that is not the only implication of not 
following the controls.
Many employees are aware of what is expected to be followed and 
enforced by the management staff. Through conversations, audits, vis­
its, or reading policy manuals employees can figure out what controls 
are in place and what management should be doing to comply with the 
controls. When management is intentionally not following what needs to 
be done due to pure laziness, staffing shortages, or a variety of other rea­
sons, this makes a statement to employees: It is acceptable not to follow 
procedures all the time. These managers may be as honest as they come, 
but intentionally not following procedures will overshadow that in the 
eyes of their employees. An example of this is package checks. If policy 
states that it is necessary to conduct daily package checks of employee 
belongings upon departure, the management staff should be conduct-
ing daily package checks. If the management staff decides that they will 
ignore the policy and not check employee contents upon departure, the 
employees may think it is acceptable not to follow the controls that are 
put in place. Some managers may feel that by not checking employees’ 
packages they are nonverbally announcing to employees their level of 
trust in them. This is not the case. Employees want and expect manage-
ment to follow the rules; in turn, most will also follow all the rules. As a 
result of managers not following known controls, some employees will 

T he Root of the Problem in Retail Business Cultures
15

take advantage of the situation, and some will lose trust in their supervi­
sors. The ones who take advantage are opportunistic and wait for a situ­
ation to present itself so they can go for it. If they know the manager is 
not ever going to check a package, they will risk concealing product in a 
personal belonging and remove it from the store. Others who lose trust 
may begin to take extended breaks or call in sick when they really are 
not sick because their supervisor is willing to bend the rules a little bit. 
Neither of the two groups—those who are opportunistic or experience a 
loss of trust—is productive for the organization, and both can be caused 
by observations in the workplace.
Employee observation and behavior adjustment, incorrect disciplin­
ary action, and management not following known controls are all areas of 
retail that can contribute to losses occurring in one form or another. Some 
are intentional, and others are more subtle. Loss prevention profession­
als who interact directly with store personnel or present at district and 
regional meetings should be covering these three areas so that employees 
can understand how their behavior directly impacts others. When cover­
ing employee observation and behavior adjustment, the main point of the 
conversation needs to focus on communicating and following through. 
Store supervisors, as well as other leaders up to and including executive 
leaders of the organization, need to realize that saying one thing but doing 
another will be detrimental. In addition, if managers do not clarify that 
something is absolutely wrong when they know it is a violation of pol­
icy, they are essentially condoning the behavior. Managers must publicly 
state when asked if something is against policy. If they are not sure of the 
answer, they need to find it and convey it to everyone who reports to them. 
Some personality types are more direct than others. Directness that turns 
into outright verbal abuse toward employees who do wrong is not accept­
able. Managers need to be taught how to properly address situations with 
their subordinates. All employees do not need to know every word said to 
their peers during a disciplinary action. The employee being disciplined 
should be removed from the sales floor and out of earshot. Just because 
someone did not meet an expectation does not mean he or she should be 
treated without dignity and respect. The disciplinary action should be 
conducted in private, and the manager should not discuss what happened 
behind closed doors with anyone who does not need to know. Last, the 
importance of following procedures and best practices needs to be com-
municated not only by loss prevention but also by regional and district 
managers. If during an audit or store visit it was determined that the store 
was not following all procedures, an action plan should be developed to 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
16

identify specifically what needs to be corrected and how to correct the 
problem. During the recap of the findings, the manager should under­
stand what happens when controls are not being followed. It is important 
to discuss how employees see the bigger picture and the implications of 
their perceptions.
THE RELATIONSHIP
According to an article by Barbara Wold, seven strategies allow busi­
nesses to strengthen their relationships that will in turn provide a com­
petitive edge:
	
1.	Communicate frequently.
	
2.	Offer customer rewards.
	
3.	Hold special events.
	
4.	Build two-way communication.
	
5.	Enhance your customer service.
	
6.	Launch multicultural programs.
	
7.	Visit the trenches.
Building relationships in business can be considered one of the key 
components in determining the success of an individual. If we take each of 
the seven strategies and apply them to the relationship between loss pre­
vention professionals and their customers, not all will be easy to achieve. 
In most organizations loss prevention is not directly responsible for indi­
viduals outside of their own department. In addition, the geographic areas 
covered by loss prevention people, excluding single store level, are usually 
relatively large, which makes it difficult to consistently communicate with 
everyone. Beyond single store level loss prevention much of the conversa-
tion being held is between loss prevention individuals and individuals 
responsible for regions or districts. This is where the frequency in con-
versations will take place. Celebrating what employees are doing right is 
something that probably needs a little work in most organizations when it 
comes to loss prevention. During audits and investigations, issues such as 
dishonesty, operational deficiencies, and lack of proper training are iden-
tified. These are all considered negative items and rightfully so. A key 
motivator in human behavior, especially in business, is that individuals 
are recognized for a job well done. Because loss prevention is rarely called 
to action for good, individuals working in the department must learn to 

T he Root of the Problem in Retail Business Cultures
17

create their own “good.” Some examples of loss prevention recognition 
are as follows:
•	 Yearly award for lowest store shrinkage and region and district 
shrinkage. The award can be a framed certificate mailed to the 
store along with a gift card.
•	 Small trinkets brought with the auditor during audit to be given 
to managers who score above a certain percentage.
•	 Allowing managers who excel in operational controls to be loss 
prevention captains. These individuals will be the go-to people 
for others who have questions about proper procedures.
•	 Having managers interested in loss prevention in conjunction 
with their own abilities that are above and beyond when it comes 
to shrinkage control travel with loss prevention.
•	 Sharing stories about employees who assisted loss prevention or 
uncovered issues that were costing the company money. The sto­
ries can be relayed through newsletters or other means available.
•	 Recognizing employees during a meeting being held by loss 
prevention.
These suggestions are just a sample of what can be done to develop meaning­
ful relationships between loss prevention and others in the organization.
The ability to build two-way communication will be determined by 
how much effort each party is willing to put forth and also by how the loss 
prevention department is viewed by the entire organization. If loss preven­
tion is viewed as a department that is a necessary business entity and pro­
vides value outside of its main functions such as auditing and investigation, 
the two-way communication building will be easier. But if the loss preven­
tion department is viewed as the necessary evil that needs to be called upon 
for terminations and when employees are being bad, the two-way commu­
nication building will be difficult. The perception of the loss prevention 
department as a whole does not start at the the bottom and move to the top; 
rather, it begins directly at the top. If the individuals leading the loss pre-
vention department do not build a foundation with executives in the orga-
nization, everyone in the department will be affected. Starting the two-way 
conversation or relationship may be one-sided for a while before it becomes 
fully evolved. Even if loss prevention is viewed as a business partner, oth-
ers in the organization are still going to be a little leery of people within the 
department because they are involved with so many negative situations. 
The field personal in the organization or stores will want to watch what 
they are saying in front of loss prevention team members for fear that what 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
18

they are saying will somehow get them in trouble, therefore limiting their 
exposure to the department. The calls will come from those who need loss 
prevention interaction until the relationship between loss prevention and 
its partners reaches a new level, which will not be accomplished until trust 
is built. Once this occurs and the partners understand that loss prevention 
has the same goal as they do—which is to keep the company profitable—
the partners will realize they go about achieving goals differently. Making 
managers and employees feel at ease during any loss prevention encounter 
is a key to developing the relationship.
To enhance the level of customer service, some simple steps need to 
be followed:
Step 1: Follow through on the commitments.
Step 2: Treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of the 
situation.
Step 3: Do not violate the trust of others.
Step 4: Provide clear and understandable answers to questions or 
concerns.
Step 5: Recognize individuals for a job well done.
Step 6: When unintentional deficiencies are found, treat the situation 
as a learning session for the individuals and help them improve 
those deficiencies.
Because loss prevention is a support department in most organiza­
tions, enhancing customer service allows others to communicate to upper 
management that loss prevention is more than just a necessary depart­
ment. Often, once a trusting relationship has been built, individuals in 
the organization will latch on to loss prevention people for support they 
cannot get anywhere else. The latching that takes place can be very ben­
eficial to loss prevention because the employees are willing to have open 
communication without fear of repercussions. The conversations can lead 
loss prevention to direct or underlying causes of losses within the organi-
zation. But the latching can also cause loss prevention people to become 
overwhelmed by the amount of time each employee occupies for the con-
versations depending on how much territory they cover. There needs to 
be a balance between becoming the go-to person for everything and being 
there for employees who need to convey information about issues that can 
adversely affect the organization.
Organizations that are doing very well today are also embracing 
diversity. Diversity should not be mistaken for a quota system that looks 

T he Root of the Problem in Retail Business Cultures
19

to hire individuals because of a specific race or gender. According to 
Cornell University,
Workplace diversity is a people issue, focused on the differences and 
similarities that people bring to an organization. It is usually defined 
broadly to include dimensions beyond those specified legally in equal 
opportunity and affirmative action non-discrimination statutes. 
Diversity is often interpreted to include dimensions which influence the 
identities and perspectives that people bring, such as profession, educa­
tion, parental status and geographic location. 
Differences of opinion as well as different approaches to the same 
issue can be considered diverse. Loss prevention professionals should be 
encouraged to be creative in their thinking and to broaden their horizons. 
Because loss prevention deals with such a diverse group of employees, it is 
important that members of the department also be diverse. For example, 
in Florida, Texas, and California, loss prevention people need to be able to 
speak Spanish to interview employees. In Quebec, loss prevention employ­
ees have a need to speak French. Knowing the needs of the geographic 
area is important before hiring. If someone is hired to conduct interviews 
in an area where there is a large population of foreign language speakers 
and the person does not possess the skill set, it will impede his or her abil­
ity to be successful in the position.
Having conversations over the phone with store employees is effec­
tive, but it cannot replace in-person visits. The current century has allowed 
for the reduction of human contact through e-mail, online shopping 
and banking, and delivery services so people never have to leave their 
house. People learn and develop through socialization, which is achieved 
through human interaction. Technology has made people’s lives easier but 
has removed a very important part of human development. Only so much 
can be achieved through a virtual setting. Again, the quantity of stores’ 
loss prevention people are responsible for will determine how often they 
can interact with people. Stores with significant shrinkage problems or 
integrity problems warrant visits from loss prevention. Putting a face 
with a name is also important in building a trusting relationship with 
people. Employees will feel more comfortable calling someone they have 
met before for information regarding dishonesty than they will calling 
someone based on a business card posted on a wall. During in-store visits 
it is important that employees gain much knowledge. The learning will 
occur not only through audits; in addition, sitting down with employees

to discuss loss prevention and all the components that go with it can be 
a very powerful learning tool. Employees will walk away understanding 
shrinkage, how their actions affect others, and what they can do to create 
an environment where honesty prevails. Following is an outline of what 
topics can be covered during the conversations in the form of a checklist 
as well as examples of the answers.

implications.
•	 Discuss the top reasons for employee theft at the organization.
•	 Explain the controls in place at store level to combat theft.
•	 Provide information on what loss prevention does to prevent 
dishonesty.
Shoplifting
•	 Conduct a role-playing session on how to address shoplifters.

ing accurate financial numbers.)
•	 Discuss reasons people do not report information and how to 
overcome this.
Create a Culture of Honesty
•	 Discuss ways to create an environment of open communication.
•	 Talk about giving clear and consistent messages about dishonesty.

•	 Provide tips on how to immediately handle policy violations.
ANSWER SHEET
Shrinkage
•	 Shrinkage is the difference between the book inventory (what you 
should have) and the physical inventory (what you actually do 
have).
•	 Shrink can come in three forms: internal, external, and opera-
tional errors:

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
22

•	 Internal: Shrink is caused internally when employees choose 
to steal from the company or intentionally cause losses to the 
company.
•	 External: Shrink is caused externally when customers or deliv­
ery drivers steal merchandise.
•	 Operational errors: Shrink is caused through errors when 
employees are not following the proper operational protocol 
that allows us to protect the company profits.
•	 The ways to reduce all forms of shrink are as follows:
•	 Internal: Good hiring practices, open communication, and 
good store controls.
•	 External: Excellent customer service, keeping shelves full, 
alarms systems, and key control.
•	 Operational: Education, communication, and follow-up.
Internal Theft
•	 Employees cause losses to the company by engaging in theft 
of bank deposits, credit card fraud, refund or void fraud, and 
dropped sales. Employees take from the company if they feel 
mistreated, need money, are mad at their supervisor, or see other 
employees doing it and not getting in trouble. The implications of 
employee theft include reduced sales, lower store morale, coun­
terproductive behavior, and turnovers.
•	 If possible, provide a recap of what employees said during dis­
honesty interviews with regard to why they stole from the 
organization.
•	 Manager should be reviewing daily paperwork. Everyone should 
be following all policy and procedures as listed in the employee 
handbook, and this information should continue to be discussed. 
Inventory should be taken accurately.
•	 Provide examples of the tools loss prevention uses to detect and 
deter dishonesty, such as software for exception reporting, soft-
ware used to find stolen product on the Internet, and camera 
systems.

Shoplifting
•	 Role playing should include different scenarios depicting events 
that could occur in the store as they pertain to shoplifting. Loss 
prevention should provide guidance on how to handle multiple 
customers and situations involving theft.
•	 Organized retail crime can range from a single theft or removal 
of understock to the use of fraudulent credit cards and checks 
in stores. All involve taking illegally, reselling, or returning for 
the benefit of the group. These people are professionals, also 
known as boosters, and are well structured, entering stores 
to remove property to be resold at fences. Fences then resell 
the product at flea markets, pawn shops, and on the Internet, 
to wholesalers, merchandise distributors, and even neighbor­
hood stores.
•	 To decrease shoplifting use excellent customer service, keep dis­
plays neat and full, and be observant of people who wear loose 
clothing or don’t buy anything and continue to come into the 
store and groups of people who try to distract employees by tak­
ing them away from other persons in the store.
•	 Provide the actual policy—if there is one—on how to handle 
shoplifting. This should include a “who to call” list and “what to 
do” procedures.
Operational Controls
•	 Refunds and voids are an easy way to steal cash from the com­
pany. To combat these problems, managers should be reviewing 
all returns and voids on a daily basis. Both returns and voids 
should have an original purchase that can be substantiated. 
Managers should complete a customer service call to a customer 
if they feel there is a suspicious transaction.
•	 All managers should be reviewing daily the prior day’s business. 
Managers should be looking for any inconsistencies or irregulari-
ties in the prior day’s business.
•	 Package checks should be completed daily. All bags, lunchboxes, 
backpacks, and other carrier items should be checked prior to 
employees’ departure. If this is done daily, employees expect to 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
24

have it done and are less likely to conceal stolen merchandise in 
their bag.
•	 Provide current data on areas of vulnerability. Provide specifics 
on how to protect those areas.
Hiring Employees
•	 Provide examples of what questions employees can ask dur­
ing the interview process that would allow them to understand 
where a person stands with regard to integrity. For example, 
“If you see a manager borrow $10 for lunch and place an IOU 
in the drawer, what would you do?” If they say, “Well, it’s the 
manager, and they know what they can and can’t do,” that’s a 
bad answer. If they say that they would report it immediately, 
that’s a good answer.
•	 Employment applications should be examined carefully in the 
following areas:
•	 Information that talks about convictions.
•	 Information that talks about discharges from previous 
employment.
•	 Reason for leaving other employers.
•	 Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).
•	 Large gaps in employment history.
•	 Organizations are looking for the best employees. Ensuring 
that managers are hiring employees that fit the scope of what is 
desired, such as good salespeople with integrity is an integral 
part of the hiring process. If a red flag is found on the application 
or during the interview process, do not hire the person because 
you need a body in the store. Hiring a person who is not the right 
fit because of a need only will cause the organization problems 
down the road.
•	 During the first interactions with a new employee, a contract 
between the manager and employee is being built. The employee 
listens and believes everything the manager says. If a manager 
misleads or implies things that cannot or will not happen, this is 
a breech of contract. As a result the person feels betrayed or lied 
to, and this will cause problems for the manager.

Reporting Information
•	 The incident report form is used to document incidents of theft, 
burglary, and robbery. All stores should have these documents on 
hand and use them for the aforementioned incidents.
•	 Provide the number for the anonymous reporting hotline and 
uses.
•	 The Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 was passed by Congress as a 
means to restore investor confidence in corporate executives, cor­
porations, and public and financial disclosures. It was a result of 
the crisis in business ethics that included Enron, WorldCom, and 
Tyco fraud scandals. As a result of this act, publically traded com­
panies must ensure that they are complying with the review of 
their paperwork and must take responsibility for their business.
•	 There are several reasons employees do not report information 
pertaining to dishonesty. The next section titled “Conversations” 
will provide a flow chart that can be used during the discussion.
Create a Culture Of Honesty
•	 Always tell the truth. Deal with issues as they come; don’t allow 
them to sit. Allow employees to disagree, but commit to a plan. 
Create an environment that allows people to come forward with 
information. Reward people who are honest and provide infor­
mation. Declare your beliefs and talk about a foundation built on 
the truth.
•	 Managers must often tell employees that any form of dishon­
esty will not be tolerated. When the company is offering a con­
test or special incentive, managers must tell the employees that 
they should not cheat to win the contest. If store internals are low 
and there is pressure to increase sales, cheating gets the person 
terminated.
•	 Employees need to feel like they are part of the team. They need 
to know they are valued and contribute to the bigger picture. 
They should be kept informed of company information, and their 
concerns should be taken seriously and addressed.
•	 Provide information on who to call if someone suspects that oth-
ers are stealing from the store. Also discuss the don’ts of knowing 
such information:

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
26

•	 Don’t inform people that you are aware of what they are doing or 
ask them why they are stealing.
•	 Don’t make it known to any other employees in the store that 
someone is suspected of theft.
Some of the aforementioned areas may or may not apply to the read­
er’s current employer. This is an example of what can be used to open 
a conversation around the topic of loss prevention. The checklist can be 
modified to fit the current organizational methods, or components of the 
checklist can be used to implement areas that are nonexistent.
Organizational relationships are the building blocks to successful 
partnerships that allow organizations to flourish. More so than other 
departments, loss prevention depends on trusting relationships to get the 
job done. The stronger the foundation of the relationship between loss 
prevention and its customers, the easier the job becomes. Loss prevention 
is a team effort, not a lone ranger business. Once the auditor, investiga­
tor, or trainer from loss prevention walks out of the location he or she is 
visiting, it becomes the choice of the location to continue what has been 
started or pretend like it never happened in the first place. Loss prevention 
individuals who understand the importance of relationship building will 
spend time doing so before they venture further into other duties. Those 
who are under the misconception that everyone has to comply because 
loss prevention said so will have a very difficult time being successful.
THE CONVERSATION
As we covered in the previous section, relationships are the building 
blocks to successful partnerships. This section will cover how the rela-
tionship develops through conversations. Loss prevention people spend 
a significant portion of their time engaging in conversation. Some of the 
conversation takes place during the audit or training session, whereas 
other portions take place during an interview. Loss prevention must look 
at every conversation as a fact-gathering session. Many clues must be 
detected to probe for further information, such as the following:
•	 The tone in employees’ voices when being asked a general question.
•	 The hesitation to answer questions regarding their supervisor.
•	 Avoiding the actual subject by deflecting the question.

T he Root of the Problem in Retail Business Cultures
27

•	 Remarks such as “If you only knew” or “Do you really want to 
know.”
•	 Sensing frustration in interviewees when they did not know or 
understand something.
•	 Employees want to tell more, but something is stopping them.
If loss prevention investigators are able to pick up on subtle clues, they 
will be able to generate a conversation that is beneficial to persons hold­
ing the information as well as the organization. Many employees hold­
ing on to information are willing to share it if they feel safe. Employees 
do not want to convey information that is affecting the organization for 
many reasons.
Figure 2.2 represents the steps necessary to report information. It also 
depicts human behavior that gets in the way of reporting the information. 
The employee response process is similar to that of the Bystander Effect. 
Researchers have concluded that certain conditions need to be present 
before society is willing to help those in an emergency situation. Much 
of the research was prompted by the Kitty Genovese case. In 1964 Kitty 
Genovese was stabbed to death in a public area while dozens of people 
witnessed the gruesome attack. No one rushed to Kitty’s aid. As with 
employees who witness occurrences of dishonesty within the workplace, 
society also has a duty to act but often does not for various reasons. There 
must be a situation occurring to prompt employees to react or not react:
Step 1: Notice That Something is Occurring. Employees may not 
understand that something is right or wrong, but in this step they 
are realizing something is going on. Between the situation begin­
ning and the realization of occurrence by an employee, self-con­
cerns begin to erupt. Employees begin to think that it is not really 
their problem and that they do not want to be part of it. To move 
to Step 2 they must overcome their self-concerns and be willing 
to make it their problem.
Step 2: Interpret the Situation as Out of the Norm. Employees are 
used to seeing specific things take place daily. In Step 2 employ-
ees must be able to decipher what is normal and what is not. Once 
they have determined that something just is not right, they can 
move on to the next step. But again there are self-inflicted bar-
riers in the way of moving to the next step. This time ambigu-
ity, relationships, and pluralistic ignorance impede information 
reporting. With ambiguity employees try to place gray into a black-
and-white situation. This allows them to free their conscience of 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿

not reporting by convincing themselves that maybe what they see 
is not what they think it is. They also dwell on relationships with 
coworkers and supervisors. They realize that what they are see­
ing cannot be good for the organization, but they do not want to 
get their “pals” in trouble. The last barrier between Steps 1 and 2 
is pluralistic ignorance. Employees think there is no way they are 
the only person who noticed the situation. Because others are not 
reacting, or they do not believe are reacting, why should they get 
involved if no one else is coming forward?
Step 3: Take Responsibility for Reacting. During Step 3 employees 
acknowledge that they have a duty to act. They also begin to feel

offended that another employee is willing to take advantage of 
the organization they work for. But again a barrier gets in the way 
of taking responsibility—diffusion of responsibility. Diffusion of 
responsibility is similar to pluralistic ignorance in that it relies 
on others for decision making but is different because it does not 
place blame on others. Rather, it assumes that others will handle 
the issue without their direct involvement or it will somehow be 
noticed. This barrier does not allow for a conscience-free approach. 
The employee is not sure that the situation will be resolved with­
out their intervention but hopes that it will.
Step 4: Decide Best Course of Action. If employees reach Step 4, they 
have made the decision that without them the situation cannot 
be resolved. Employees are deliberating how best to convey the 
information. If they are aware of all the tools available, such as an 
anonymous hotline, open door policy, direct contact with field man­
agement, or a call to loss prevention, the decision is made easier. If 
they are not sure how to proceed, they will need to research how to 
provide confidential information. The barrier between Steps 3 and 
4 is lack of competence. Employees know what they are seeing is 
wrong, but they do not feel like they are competent to diagnose the 
problem completely. As mentioned in Step 4, not knowing who to 
call can get in the way of making any call at all. Employees can take 
the attitude that no one trained them on how to handle this type of 
situation so there is nothing more they can do.
Step 5: Provide Information. If all barriers are overcome, the end 
result is Step 5. Employees will provide the organization with 
the necessary information. Some employees never reach Step 5 
because of the barriers stopping the flow of information. Some 
of the barriers have validity, but others are just figments of their 
imagination. On the other hand, if employees have actually wit-
nessed one of the barriers come true with someone else who has 
tried to report information, this will only confirm their suspi-
cions. The barrier between Steps 4 and 5 is along the same lines 
as the barrier between Step 2 and self-concern. Employeees begin 
to think of what can happen once the information is provided: if 
for some reason what they saw was not a violation, they will be 
fired. On the flip side, if they are right that can be bad as well. If 
their boss likes the person and somehow they are saved from ter-
mination they will have to deal with them knowing they are the 
one who tried to get them fired.

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿

An extreme psychological process takes place for employees when 
they need to have a conversation. Some of the barriers are so intense that it 
does not allow for the movement to the next step that will eventually lead 
to releasing information. Having conversations with employees about 
what to do if they notice dishonesty and how to report information can 
lessen the barriers. If there is a hotline for reporting business irregulari­
ties it should be posted in visible area. Knowledge is power in this type of 
situation because if employees know the protocol prior to being involved 
it allows the entire process to move more freely.
The reporting of dishonesty that is discussed in the flow chart describes 
a situation noticed by employees and reported by employees. Information 
also can be delivered in different ways, but with similar results. Tying in 
the goals of loss prevention with operations can be a hurdle worth jump­
ing. In other chapters the struggle between loss prevention and other 
departments will be discussed more fully, but for purposes of this section 
it will be only briefly mentioned. Loss prevention must understand what 
the immediate needs of the organization are. Most loss prevention people 
will find that reducing shrinkage is not at the top of the executive “to do” 
list. But that does not mean that loss prevention cannot find another angle 
to attack shrinkage or potential ethical issues occurring in a location.
CATEGORIES AFFECTING EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE
There is usually a correlation between poor store performance and high 
inventory loss. The problem is usually with the leadership at the store or 
regional level. With that being said, a different angle is to approach the sit-
uation with trying to correct the poor performance, which is usually at the 
top of the executive to do list. Addressing the topic of poor performance 
will also be accomplished through conversation. The unique outcome of 
this type of conversation is that it will serve two purposes: understanding 
why there is a performance issue and uncovering underlying causes that 
can be contributing to loss prevention situations. Categories that affect 
performance in the workplace are as follows:
	
1.	Training, skills, and knowledge.
	
2.	Motivation.
	
3.	External factors or factors beyond employees’ control.
Especially important to loss prevention is the motivation category. 
Motivation drives much employee behavior and can work either for good

or bad. The following section provides examples of questions that can 
address employee performance. Each question can be given a yes–no 
answer. Interviewers can assess which of the three categories is the big­
gest contributor to the problem by the number of yes and no answers. 
Providing a recap of the assessment to field partners and executives of the 
findings will also be beneficial.
TRAINING, SKILLS, AND KNOWLEDGE
	
1.	Did the organization provide adequate training?
	
2.	Do you believe you received the same training as everyone else?
	
3.	Did the organization provide adequate coaching and opportuni­
ties to work with others who could help?
	
4.	Does the coaching you receive help better you in the current 
role?
	
5.	Do you feel as though you understand what is expected of you on 
a daily basis?
	
6.	Do you believe you possess the skills necessary to perform your 
job at the level the organization expects?
	
7.	Are you armed with the knowledge necessary to fulfill your 
role?
	
8.	Do you receive feedback on your performance?
	
9.	Do you know how to fix areas of opportunity when you receive 
feedback?
MOTIVATION
	
1.	Do you like working for the organization?
	
2.	Do you believe that everyone in the store is treated the same?
	
3.	Do you feel the incentives are fair?
	
4.	Are you recognized for a job well done?
	
5.	Do you believe you have a good level of autonomy?
	
6.	Do you feel like you can advance within the organization?
	
7.	Do you believe promises the organization makes are kept?
	
8.	Are all employees in the store accountable for their actions?
	
9.	Do you believe your needs are addressed?

EXTERNAL FACTORS OR FACTORS 
BEYOND EMPLOYEES’ CONTROL
	
1.	Have you noticed a decrease in store traffic?
	
2.	When walking near or through the mall do you notice customers 
carrying bags from other retailers?
	
3.	Have any new retailers of a similar nature opened in the area that 
would be impacting your business?
	
4.	Is the economic growth strong in the city where the store is 
located?
	
5.	Would you say your personal quality of life is good?
	
6.	Are you happy outside of work?
	
7.	Have you experienced any life events over the past year?
	
8.	If you feel pressure from work, is it revealed when you are at 
home?
	
9.	Are there enough employees in the store to do the job?
One of the most profound statements made regarding conversations 
came from Susan Scott, the author of Fierce Conversation, during one of her 
presentations for an organization. She spoke about a marital relationship 
that was not going so well. For years, conversations had been occurring 
between the husband and wife, but no resolution ever came of the conver-
sation. She said, “The conversation is the relationship.” In other words, the 
relationship could not exist without the conversations. This is true for most 
relationships. Conversations need to continue to occur for the relationship 
to move forward. Problems are resolved through discussions with others. 
Without conversations it would be difficult for people to exist.

Exploring the Psychology 
Supporting the Theft Triangle
How and Why Does Criminal 
Behavior Begin?
As loss prevention professionals ponder the reasons for dishonesty, 
understanding human behavior will help put everything into perspective. 
Significant research has been completed on why people commit crimes in 
general, but an insignificant portion is geared toward theft specifically. 
It is obvious that individuals who cause external or internal theft do not 
just wake up one day and decide this is the way to go. Research on adoles­
cent behavior shows that early life influences will impact decision-making 
ability throughout adulthood.
Adolescence is a time of physical and emotional growth. The adoles­
cent life stage is a period of increased risk for the onset of several problems, 
including delinquency. Being able to identify the early warning signs of 
deviance and early intervention can play a key role in adolescents’ future 
development. Parental involvement and discipline consistency will deter-
mine how adolescents perceive the act of deviance, the level of aware-
ness toward consequences, and effects on their conscience concluding an 
event. Peer and sibling pressures will leave an emotional wake conclud-
ing a conversation or request for engagement in acts that would otherwise 
not be thought of. Environmental situations and socioeconomic issues 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
34

are contributing factors when adolescents are contemplating making the 
right or wrong decision. Knowing right from wrong or moral develop­
ment begins early in life. When children need nurturing or feeding and 
their parents fulfill that need without excessive indulgence, they develop 
character that accepts rules and tolerates frustration later in life.
We now turn to a discussion of different theories associated with 
crime and deviance. Understanding the theories will allow the readers to 
tie the concepts into retail loss prevention.
SELF-CONTROL THEORY
Gottfredson and Hirschi’s self-control theory assumes that individu­
als are rational in their decision to commit a crime. Individuals will 
weigh the costs against the rewards in any decision to commit a crime. 
Therefore, individuals pursue crime because it promises rewards with 
little threat of pain. This particular portion of the self-control theory ties 
in well with what retailers face on a daily basis when it comes to employee 
theft. Because employees go through an interview process, the ability to 
determine whether they are rational or not happens before the hiring pro­
cess. If they are hired, it is assumed that they are not only rational but 
also competent enough to satisfy the requirements of the job. However, 
being rational is not the only factor that goes into individuals’ decision 
to engage in behavior that will negatively impact an organization. If we 
take the second part, which is weighing the costs against the rewards, it is 
easier to understand how the decision is made. Costs and rewards make 
up one of the most important perspectives in retail loss prevention and 
can be combated easier than others. The theft triangle involves opportu-
nity and how eliminating opportunity can reduce the amount of theft that 
takes place. Costs and rewards focus on one’s perception of getting away 
with something and how much it is worth. If employees realize that there 
is little chance of getting caught when committing the act of dishonesty, 
their willingness to take the risk increases. Please see Figure 3.1 showing 
how infrequently retail crimes, especially shoplifting, employee theft, and 
employee fraud, are reported to the police.
Gottfredson and Hirschi equated individuals’ desire to commit 
crime against their level of self-control. Gottfredson and Hirschi argued 
that individuals with low self-control are unable to restrain themselves 
from the temptations of immediate satisfaction and that low self-control 
develops early in life. According to Higgins and Rickets’s recap of the 

E xploring the Psychology Supporting the Theft Triangle
35
© 2011 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC
self-control theory, low self-control could be the result of ineffective or 
inadequate socialization. Ineffective socialization includes weak or poor 
attachment, supervision, and discipline from parents before the age of 8. 
After that age, individuals’ level of self-control will remain stable into and 
throughout adulthood.
Empirical literature supporting the self-control theory includes a 
meta-analysis by Pratt and Cullen, who provided 20 studies showing 
that self-control is at least a moderate predictor of crime and deviance. 
Other studies also show support for the hypothesis that parental man­
agement is an antecedent to self-control. Higgins and Ricketts, in their 
evaluation of the self-control theory, found that self-control has a direct 
effect on the intent to commit academic dishonesty. Their study also 
indicated that self-control does not have an indirect effect on intent to 
commit academic dishonesty through opportunity, but it does through 
freedom.
DIFFERENTIAL ASSOCIATION THEORY
Edwin H. Sutherland developed the term differential association. According 
to Giddens, Duneier, and Appelbaum, differential association states that 
some cultures encourage illegal behavior whereas others encourage legal 
behavior. I interpret this to mean that in some parts of the world it is accept-
able to break the rules, but in other parts it’s not a condoned practice. If we

relate this concept to retail, it is the culture within a store, region, brand, 
that will determine which behavior is acceptable…one that is good for 
the organization or one that is adverse to the organization. Individuals 
on both sides of the fence (illegal–legal) view their behavior as the norm. 
Therefore, in a culture that accepts illegal behavior, it would be considered 
the same as law-abiding citizens’ behavior. These cultures would just con­
sider the approach to be different. This is true in a retail store environment 
as well. The culture created within the store will dictate the behavior of 
employees. If the manager accepts or participates in deviant behavior, oth­
ers are likely to follow. The manager’s behavior dictates to employees that 
it is okay to bend or break the rules and that there are not consequences. 
Even if the employees had no intention of bending or breaking the rules, 
watching a superior do it and get away with it opens the door. On the 
other hand, if a manager clarifies his or her level of tolerance (what is and 
what is not accepted), then the employees are being told that bad behavior 
will not be condoned. Consequences must accompany both good and bad 
behavior. Those who consistently follow the rules should be rewarded, 
and those who do not need a reprimand; otherwise, as the book Absolute 
Honesty warns,  “When the culture authorizes aberrant behavior, aberrant 
behavior becomes the norm and a culture of honesty ceases to exist.” If the 
behavior is accepted, it will be repeated.
Erickson et al. evaluated Sutherland’s differential association theory 
and Hirschi’s social control theory. The study found that deviant friend­
ships and susceptibility linked social bonds to substance use and delin­
quency. Bonds were more consistently related to friends’ substance use 
than to friends’ delinquency, and deviance of males was more strongly 
affected by the actions of friends than was deviance of females. Although 
there is not extensive research on the topic of male versus female dishon-
esty in the workplace, some evidence supports that males are a bigger 
contributor to dishonesty than are females.
MERTON’S STRAIN THEORY
According to Agnew, Merton’s strain theory assumes aspirations of fairly 
uniform economic success across social classes and attempts to explain 
why crime is concentrated among the lower classes, which have the least 
legitimate opportunity for achievement. Merton states that the theory is 
the combination of cultural emphasis and the social structure, which pro-
duces intense pressure for deviation. Members of lower classes are the

most vulnerable to this pressure, or strain, and will maintain their unful­
filled economic aspirations in spite of frustration or failure. Merton’s the­
ory can be tied into shoplifting from retail stores. A significant percentage 
of individuals caught shoplifting are from lower classes. These individu­
als have found a means of supporting themselves or their habits through 
illegal actions. Individuals stealing for personal reasons often have not 
learned how to make it through life legitimately. Shoplifting is an easy 
way to get what they need with little consequence.
COHEN’S STRAIN THEORY
According to Agnew, Cohen argues that working class boys are not 
equipped, because of socialization, to compete with middle-class boys in 
societal states. Because of this strain or inability to compete with classes 
above their own, the attitudes develop into exaggerated hostility towards 
societal and middle-class values. 
AGNEW’S STRAIN THEORY
Agnew wrote that strain is neither structural nor interpersonal but is 
instead emotional, involving a breakdown of beliefs in the role others 
play for expectations about normally occurring events. Perceptions of 
an adverse environment will lead to strongly negative emotions that 
motivate people to engage in crime. Agnew stated that crime is sporadic 
and that people would “desist” if not for persistent negative events and 
effects. He identified three types of deviance-producing strain:
•	 Failure to achieve positively valued goals, which is the gap 
between expectations and actual achievements and the difference 
between the view of what a person believes the outcome should 
be and what actually results.
•	 Removal of positively valued stimuli, which occurs primarily 
during adolescence when a dramatic change or loss happens.
•	 Confrontation with negative stimuli, which is applied most to 
adolescents. Usually the individual is forced to remain among 
negative actions that through an anger-induced response create 
deviant behavior.

MORAL DEVELOPMENT
Loss prevention professionals often wonder where employees’ morals 
have gone when being interviewed for dishonesty. Often, dishonest peo­
ple who want others to believe they are honest and not guilty will bring 
up their childhood. Comments such as, “I was raised better than that,” 
are not uncommon when dishonest employees are probed about the event 
that got them into trouble. They feel that if someone believes their moral 
development was adequate, they are more likely to believe they did not 
commit the act of dishonesty. These comments are deflectors of the situa­
tion and should be recognized as such.
Kohlberg presented adolescents with stories of moral dilemma and 
was able to identify three levels of moral development:
	
1.	Preconventional level (up to age 9):
	
a.	 Moral law is developed by children seeing rules set, mostly by 
parents.
	
b.	 Satisfaction of children’s needs is seen as good and moral.
	
2.	Conventional level (age 9 to adolescence):
	
a.	 An understanding of expectations as laid out by role models 
such as parents and teachers is beginning. Morality is seen as 
achieving these expectations.
	
b.	 A fulfillment of obligations and following expectations are 
seen as moral law for children.
	
3.	Postconventional level (adulthood):
	
a.	 Adults learn that there are varying opinions about morality 
and that people or groups evaluate it differently. Morality is 
seen as upholding the values of your group or culture.
	
b.	 Those who understand their own beliefs allow others and 
themselves to judge and be judged upon higher levels of 
morality. Right and wrong are based on the circumstances 
surrounding an action.
PARENTING AND CULTURAL INFLUENCES
According to Santrock, parents are neglectful when they are very unin-
volved in their adolescents’ life. It is believed that neglectful parenting is 
associated with adolescents’ socially incompetent behavior, especially lack 
of self-control, and they do not handle independence well. Adolescents

who have experienced neglectful parenting develop the sense that other 
aspects of their parents’ lives are more important than they are.
In Baer, a study conducted on family cohesion found that cohesion 
is important to family functioning and that levels of cohesion have been 
implicated in both positive and negative outcomes. It was predicted that 
cohesion would be negatively correlated with deviance; results indicated 
that deviance was predicted by the changing trends in family. Cohesion 
may not be static, and levels may shift across the family life cycle.
Lerner, Noh, and Wilson examined one study indicating that among 
14- to 19-year-old African American youth social support from kin was 
related to self-reliance and good grades; however, when kinship sup­
port was low the youths experienced feelings of distress. Students with 
intact families were least likely to drop out of school and were less likely 
to experiment with drugs. In another study of more than 1,800 Latino, 
African American, and European American parents of adolescents, con­
flicts were said to occur mainly over everyday matters like chores and 
styles of dress rather than related to substantive issues like sex and drugs. 
Depression in both European American and Asian American adolescents 
is correlated with family relations marked by low warmth and acceptance 
and high levels of conflict with mothers and fathers. Anger, hostility, coer­
cion, and conflict shown by both parents and siblings have a detrimental 
effect on the adolescent adjustment.
The International Study of Adolescent Development (ISAD) found evi­
dence suggesting that differences in family processes (parental monitor­
ing, the affective mother–child and father–child relationships) and levels 
of self-control largely accounted for the differences in self-reported delin­
quency between males in Switzerland and the United States. The select 
variables explained more than 70% of the total variability in self-reported 
delinquency between the two nations. The results indicate that finding 
such differences in individual socialization and differences in contextual 
experiences may inform the understanding of the etiology of various 
developmental outcomes and processes in adolescents and may provide 
information for intervention and prevention efforts.
Organizations are full of people who grew up in environments where 
good morals were taught and in environments where no morals were 
taught. Even those who grew up in morally stable environments—where 
right and wrong were clearly different—can make decisions as adults that 
can adversely impact their place of work.
To further understand why adolescents make bad decisions and 
to provide useful information for retail loss prevention, research was

conducted at a juvenile detention center. The purpose of the research was 
to determine what has the greatest influence on the decision-making pro­
cess of adolescents and how the decisions affect their mental health. The 
study focused on adolescents who committed acts of thefts.
Method
Procedure and Sample
A total of 12 adolescents were interviewed in person and were also 
observed in their natural setting. All participants were males ranging in 
age from 10 to 18 years of age. Of the total population interviewed, 33% 
were white, and 66% were African American. Of those interviewed, 10 of 
12 were incarcerated at a juvenile detention center. Of the participant pop­
ulation at the detention center, 80% were African American, and 20% were 
white. The other two males were perceived to be law-abiding citizens. The 
counselor assigned to the facility selected the sample from the detention 
center. Only males who had been convicted of theft-related crimes were 
able to participate in the research. Prior to the interviews, all participants 
agreed to join in the discussion. A list of 20 questions was given to each 
participant (Table 3.1). The participants at the detention center were asked 
one extra question: to discuss the crimes they had committed. The ques­
tions pertained to relationships (with family, peers, and teachers), self-
perception, honesty, and future plans. The answers to the questions and 
notes were documented and were included as an appendix to the paper 
provided to the detention center at the end of the study.
Results
The research shows that there is a great deal of support for Agnew’s strain 
theory, specifically confrontation with negative stimuli response. The 10 
incarcerated males indicated that they grew up in negative surroundings. 
They explained observing significant violence, theft, and drug activity. 
A total of 9 out of the 10 incarcerated males were raised in the inner city. 
The one raised in the suburbs had negative influences in the household. 
The two males who were not incarcerated did not mention any obser-
vations of negative stimuli. All 12 boys did not live with their biologi-
cal mother and father. Three lived with their father, four lived with their 
mother and a stepfather, and the rest lived with other family members or 
a girlfriend. Several did not know who their father was, and several oth-
ers had fathers presently or previously in prison. All 10 incarcerated boys 
mentioned being involved with drugs—mostly selling. All were repeat

offenders. Only one mentioned using drugs. Among the 10 boys, their 
first theft offense occurred between the ages of 7 and 17. The items they 
first stole ranged from candy to cars. Of those incarcerated, 3 of 10 first 
stole a bike from the neighborhood. Only 1 of 10 first stole a car. A total of 
8 of 10 admitted to being shown by a peer or family member how to steal. 
This provides support for the differential association theory. Only 1 male 
showed remorse for what he had done to others, and 1 of 10 admitted to 
receiving significant punishment due to their acts of deviance. The other 
9 had little or no consequences for bad behavior. The lack of consequences

or accountability was one of the significant contributors to deviance. This 
also provides much support for the self-control theory. Several males 
mentioned that if the consequences had been worse they could foresee 
choosing a different outcome. Only the two boys not incarcerated seemed 
to have the ability or desire to discuss their parental relationship.
The research showed correlation between environmental factors, 
cultural factors, and family and peer relationships and adolescents’ deci­
sion-making process. One question posed to the interviewees returned 
surprising results. All interviewees were asked whether they would tell 
their parents about something bad they had done even if they knew their 
parents would not find out. Both males who were not incarcerated would 
not tell the parents, and 2 of 10 incarcerated males would tell their par­
ents. The reason this was surprising is that the boys who were not incar­
cerated did not declare any fear of their parents. It could be argued that 
the thought process of boys in that age group, regardless if they’ve been 
in trouble or not, will withhold information if the risk of getting called 
out on it is low. This question goes back to consequences and account­
ability. Those who were not incarcerated had a greater consequence for 
being caught doing something wrong than those who were incarcerated. 
The two incarcerated males would be willing to tell their parents because 
there would be no repercussions. The incarcerated males have less than 
desirable living conditions when they are free; most live in areas where 
children are exposed to violence on a daily basis. Often, people who grow 
up in this environment believe that they do not have a choice in com­
mitting crimes because of the conditions around them. They exhibit very 
little self-control and easily give in to temptation.
The 10 incarcerated boys interviewed for the study wondered how 
they were going to be able to change their lives once they returned home 
because they were going back to the same environment that created the 
problems to begin with. They were alarmingly affected by their peers’ 
perception of them. If their peers teased them or dared them to commit a 
crime, they went along so they were not singled out. Their parents, through 
neglectful parenting, gave too much freedom, which contributed to their 
current predicament. For these incarcerated boys to have any chance at a 
normal adult life, something in their home environment would have to 
change. Their lack of remorse for the crimes they committed is an indica-
tor that they were likely to be repeat offenders.
The incarcerated young males were angry. Some declared that they 
were even angrier when they were younger but that as they grew older 
they learned to accept what their lives were. Bottling up emotions and not

having an outlet to discuss problems festered within; as they continued 
to see more violence and crime, it continued to build. They saw crime and 
deviance as an escape.
Further research is needed on this topic. One question to explore 
is what role gender plays in the decision-making process when adoles­
cents are contemplating acts of deviance. Cross-sectional research can be 
conducted to further explore the topic of deviance and adolescents. The 
advantage of cross sectional research is that it is relatively inexpensive 
and demands less time.
Adolescents are society’s future. Eventually the incarcerated males 
will have served their time and will be released into society. If they are 
not provided with a way to stop the vicious circle of deviance and criminal 
behavior, they will continue to be a hazard to those around them. Some 
will eventually obtain employment and will be predisposed to theft and 
deviance, causing a financial impact on organizations. Early intervention 
is the key but cannot be considered without caregivers’ proper involve­
ment. The justice system is not the answer to fixing these problems; it is 
simply a temporary solution to a foreseeable problem. Using shaming as 
an alternative to incarceration is a very effective tool in Japan. The crime 
rate of both adolescents and adults is significantly lower in Japan than in 
the United States because in Japan when a crime is committed it brings 
shame and embarrassment to the offender’s family and friends. Parental 
involvement and intervention as well as community involvement are the 
keys to resolving crime-related problems in the United States.
Ideally, anyone applying for a job would also provide a truthful 
account of the first 18 years of life. However, we know this is an unreal-
istic expectation. Tools such as preemployment screening can weed out 
potentially bad employees, although some who pass the preemployment 
screening eventually end up stealing from the organization. There is no 
guarantee that anyone will or will not steal from the workplace.
CONTRIBUTING FACTORS OF 
DEVIANCE IN THE WORKPLACE
Adverse employee behavior impacts the employee, organization, and 
coworkers. As organizations try to keep profits high and losses low, they 
must first uncover the root cause of why employees choose to engage in 
acts that do not have the company’s best interest in mind. Some employees’ 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿

willingness to jeopardize their personal integrity should not be taken 
lightly. They must have the motivation to commit the act and be able to 
rationalize their behavior before they ever make the first step toward 
counterproductive behavior.
It is more important than ever for corporations to ensure they are 
keeping honest employees honest. Organizations have an obligation to 
treat employees properly; in turn, employees will have an increased loy­
alty to the organization. Each year corporations invest millions of dollars 
in recruiting, hiring, and training quality employees. Businesses pride 
themselves on achieving high profits and maintaining a highly motivated 
workforce. What they sometimes overlook is that when things such as 
employee dissatisfaction, personality traits, negative attitudes, and chang­
ing perceptions heavily impact work places, counterproductive and some­
times even deviant employee behavior may follow.
The following sections address the different factors that affect 
employee behavior and the key role they play in employees’ decision-
making processes. The objective of this review is to inform the business 
community about how counterproductive behavior originates in the mind 
of the employee and how organizational behaviors contribute to the entire 
spectrum of employees who choose either to remain positive or to become 
negative, thus adversely impacting the organization.
Expectations
According to the 2008 National Retail Security Survey, employee theft 
accounts for nearly 43% of all retail losses in the United States. The 
financial loss caused by a dishonest employee is an average of $1,023 
(Figure 3.2). An employee typically works for his or her employer an aver-
age of nine months.
Social scientists have concluded that a variety of factors contribute 
to theft occurrence; logically, three must be present, making up what is 
called the theft triangle (refer to Figure 1.1 in Chapter 1):
	
1.	Motivation
	
2.	Opportunity
	
3.	Low deterrent
The transition for employees from honest to dishonest takes much 
rationalization. They must feel like what they are doing is justified in 
some way. The motivation that leads to dishonesty can begin either in the 
workplace or at home.

According to Hollinger, most incidents of employee pilferage are 
unrelated to employees’ particular financial situation. In addition, aver­
age employee thieves are not embezzlers of large amounts of cash; rather, 
they steal small amounts of company merchandise or cash on a regular 
basis.
Job dissatisfaction plays an important role in employees’ minds when 
they are contemplating theft. If they feel as though they have been treated 
unfairly or that the company owes them something, the decision to steal is 
made much more easily. They rationalize that they are getting back at the 
employer for unresolved feelings of perceived inequity in the way they 
have been treated.
Paul, Niehoff, and Turnley conducted a literature review involving 
employees’ and employers’ evaluation of empowerment. The authors sug­
gested that empowering employees results in employers’ creating beliefs 
about entitlements that will go unfulfilled eventually. The unfulfilled 
beliefs about entitlement may constitute a breach of the psychological 
contract between employer and employee, which may result in employee 
behavior that is counterproductive in terms of organizational goals.
Average employees want to do a good job but also expect things in 
return for their good job. If employees are presented with more and more 
duties, they believe that something good is going to happen in their near 
future and may perceive this even though a conversation has not taken 
place about how they might be rewarded. If what they expect and believe 
they are entitled to does not arrive, negative emotions will begin to build. 
If the manager does not recognize a problem with the employee, it can 
lead to counterproductive behavior based on false perceptions.

Dissatisfaction
Hollinger and Clark  examined the job satisfaction hypothesis with a larger 
data set and discovered a more consistent pattern of support. As covered 
in an earlier chapter, employees’ very first meeting with their employer 
builds a psychological contract—an agreement between them and their 
employer. The employer could have implied something but not actually 
meant what he or she said. In this meeting, however, employees take what 
their employer implied or said and put it as part of this contract. Once 
there is a breech in the contract, employees feel as though they have been 
lied to or misled. As a result of this breech, they become dissatisfied.
Researchers concluded that the most common reason employees com­
mitted fraud had little to do with opportunity but more with motivation: 
the more dissatisfied the employee, the more likely he or she is to engage 
in criminal behavior. Employees and executives who feel unfairly treated 
sometimes believe they can right the scales by committing occupational 
fraud and abuse. Getting even with the company for unfair treatment is 
more common than many would like to believe. When people hear about 
highly paid executives who steal from their company, they wonder why. 
Most turn their thoughts to greed but do not consider that these execu­
tives may have been trying to even the score. Organizations do not have 
to get inside the mind of every employee; rather, they should observe 
employees’ behavior and intervene when necessary.
Attitudes
Bolin and Heatherly evaluated four different employee attitudes—theft 
approval, company contempt, intent to quit, and dissatisfaction—in pre­
dicting deviant employee behavior. One purpose of this study was to 
assess the utility of classifying deviant workplace behavior based on the 
offense. The samples used were entry-level employees, and the method 
was the Employee Perceptions Survey. Overall, the results indicated that 
theft approval is the most important predictor of workplace deviance 
across the current criteria and group. (Please see Figure 3.3.)
Gauging employees’ attitudes to determine if they will become dis-
honest is not an easy task. Research in this area can help business own-
ers reduce the losses because they can know what to look for. Employers 
aware of what to look for in employees’ attitudes can begin the interven-
tion process. This can be a conversation with employees regarding their 
attitude or asking general questions to test their loyalty to the company.

If their attitude is based on what they have witnessed by others or what 
they have found to be acceptable, a redirection by their supervisor may 
put them back on the right track.
Personality and Perceptions
Colbert focused on the joint relationship between personality and percep­
tion of the work situation and deviant behavior. Seven hypotheses were 
developed to evaluate the relationship between employee perception and 
personality to the withholding effort and interpersonal deviance. The 
model used in the study indicated that a negative perception of the work­
place may lead employees to deviant behavior, but this may be suppressed 
or facilitated depending on personality traits.
Stamper and Masterson theoretically and empirically explored 
the concept of perceived inside status (PIS), or the perception employ-
ees have about the relationship between them and the company. Balu’s 
social exchange framework best represents perceived organizational 
support. There was evidence to support that perceived organizational 
support influenced PIS. There is no support for actual inclusion in the

organization leading to PIS. The findings indicated that PIS is positively 
and significantly related to a positive discretionary behavior (altruism) 
and negatively and significantly related to production of deviance. Actual 
and perceived inclusion in the organization matter. Production deviance 
was not as prevalent as altruism.
One instant motivation crusher is when employees think another 
employee is getting preferential treatment. This could be projected in a 
variety of ways, such as better work hours or days, more money, or job 
scope. If employees believe that their supervisor likes people in the work 
group more than they are liked, problems can occur. Employees want to 
believe that everyone is treated equal, and if a manager proves otherwise, 
employees can lose their interest in working for their manager.
Personal Integrity
Mikulay, Neuman, and Finkelstein examined the relationship among 
personal integrity, situational factors, and counterproductive workplace 
behaviors. Three broad predictions were offered:
	
1.	Is it possible that integrity does not interact with desirability, 
group norms, or risk?
	
2.	Is it possible that individuals low in integrity react to situational 
factors by adjusting their likelihood of committing counterpro­
ductive behavior?
	
3.	Is it possible that individuals high in integrity respond to the situ­
ation and individuals low in integrity do not?
As the level of integrity decreased, the likelihood of counterproductive 
behavior increased. Low-integrity individuals indicated a higher likeli­
hood of absence, tardiness, committing theft, and vandalism. The like-
lihood of theft by high-integrity employees did not increase as risk of 
exposure decreased, whereas the opposite occurred for low-integrity 
individuals. The only significant interaction was integrity and the risk of 
theft.
Many preemployment tests screen for integrity, which many indi-
viduals caught engaging in counterproductive behavior took and passed. 
This can mean one of two things: either the test is not valid, or something 
caused the employee to go from having personal integrity to not having 
any. Because employers use a variety of tests, the chances are slim that 
every test is invalid or unreliable, so the latter scenario is more likely.

Personal integrity is something everyone should be proud to have. 
When Thorsborne asked people to describe integrity, they answered in a 
variety of ways, including the following:
•	 Strength of character
•	 Walking the talk, doing what was promised
•	 Open, honest, and direct dealing with others
•	 Authentic, straightforward, what’s on the inside is displayed on 
the outside
According to Thorsborne, trust is an incredibly precious commodity and 
is always the first casualty when relationships in the workplace are dam­
aged. Integrity is something people own and can be taken away only if it 
is given. So why do so many people in the workplace give it away—make 
a conscious choice to simply throw away their self-worth for a few dollars? 
That is the issue almost all corporations deal with at some level.
One could argue that the “me” generation has made a priority of self-
interest. The pursuit of profit at all costs has seduced people away from 
responsibilities to relationships with others. Self-interest is certainly an 
issue in the workplace, but is it a contributing factor for counterproductive 
behavior? Employees who are concerned with getting promoted, doing a 
good job, and being productive enough to move ahead are less likely to 
engage in behavior that would lead to termination. They do not want to 
jeopardize in any way their employment with the company because they 
wish to remain employed. Employees with no self-interest or without a 
vested interest in the company should be of utmost concern to the organi­
zations in which they work.
Summary
All of the studies in the preceding sections indicate that even if employees 
start off with integrity, something may happen to change them during 
their time with a company. This change may be a result of their dissatis-
faction, expectations, perceptions, or personality. Once employees have 
made a conscious decision to move from honesty to dishonesty, there is 
no turning back for them. Corporations should have as a goal to make 
sure their employees never make this transition for any reason. It could 
be stated that people with a good attitude and positive perception of the 
organization are less likely to engage in counterproductive behavior. 
Managers must make efforts to ensure they understand where their sub-
ordinates stand. Open lines of communication between employee and

employer are essential for productive workforces. If employees fear retri­
bution for discussing matters, animosity will build.
Managers cannot engage in deceptive methods to lure potential 
applicants to the job just to hire a warm body. They must understand that 
once applicants are hired under false pretenses, the organization will pay 
through revenge from that employee. Most employees do not intend to be 
dishonest on their own without any contributing factors. To fully under­
stand and attempt to eliminate counterproductive behavior, we must first 
understand how the thought process behind the behavior is developed.
MORE DETERRENTS OR BETTER LEADERSHIP?
The first part of this chapter focused on adolescent behavior and factors 
that contribute to workplace dishonesty. As discussed, there is evidence 
to support that children who grow up in morally challenged households 
are more likely to engage in theft-related offense. In addition, research has 
shown that happy employees are less likely to steal. Does this mean that 
employees who were raised right and seem to be happy will definitely not 
steal? The answer is no. As mentioned in this chapter, the theft triangle 
focuses on motivation, low deterrents, and opportunity. The motivation 
part of the triangle was discussed in the first part of this chapter. Low 
deterrents and opportunity will now be discussed and evaluated against 
motivation.
Crime Prevention through Environmental Design
Crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED) is a concept 
that has not been explored in great detail related to retail loss prevention 
but that should be. This chapter focuses on internal issues, or employees, 
not external issues such as shoplifters. The concept of CPTED was origi-
nally formulated by criminologist C. Ray Jeffery. The goal of CPTED is 
to create an environment that is risky for crime. Four elements surround 
CPTED.
Natural Surveillance
With natural surveillance there is an increased perception of being seen 
or apprehended. The environmental design is conducive for rule fol-
lowers but impedes rule breakers’ ability to get away. Store design is an 
extremely important consideration for employees contemplating whether

to be dishonest. Blind spots without camera systems are frequently used 
by employees who want to get away with something. Register placement 
is also important. If the register is in an open area where the public and 
other employees are consistently walking by, it makes it more difficult to 
take money.
Natural Access Control
Natural access control limits the opportunity for crime by taking steps 
to clearly differentiate between public space and private space. This can 
include the placement of entrances and exits, fencing, lighting, and land­
scape. Many retailers already employ several different methods of access 
control such as one employee entry and exit. Making it mandatory to enter 
and exit through the same door makes it difficult for employees to walk 
out of the door with concealed product because their fear of being caught 
is higher: they will not know who will be standing at the door and poten­
tially conducting package checks. Dumpsters or garbage areas are often 
used for the concealment of stolen merchandise that will be picked up at 
a later time. Limiting the number of employees who can take out garbage 
and placing the dumpster in a well-lit area will help decrease merchan­
dise leaving through this method.
Natural Territorial Reinforcement
Territorial reinforcement encourages individuals to have a vested interest 
in their surroundings, which motivates them to keep out individuals who 
do not belong or who will negatively impact their environment. It boils 
down to a sense of ownership of the area. Employees who feel like their 
place of employment is also part of who they are will be more likely to 
want to remove anything that negatively affects their daily lives. They will 
not tolerate others who blatantly jeopardize their livelihood by engaging 
in behavior that will adversely impact their organization. This is a form of 
employee self-policing one another that drastically reduces the amount of 
losses that can occur because dishonesty is clearly unacceptable to others.
Maintenance
The broken windows theory, developed by criminologists James Q. 
Wilson and George Kelling, is a valuable tool in understanding the impor-
tance of maintenance in deterring crime. Wilson and Kelling believed that 
evidence of neighborhood deterioration, such as broken windows, could 
bring about social disorder because there is a perception that no one cares. 
Maintaining a store environment is crucial in motivating or demotivating

employees. Employees who walk into a clean, organized store daily are 
more likely to be productive than those who walk into a store that is 
dirty and disorganized. You can often tell the quality of a manager by 
going into the restroom of the store. If the manager allows the restroom 
to be dirty and does not have a program in place to ensure cleanliness, 
it is safe to conclude that the other controls are probably not in place 
either. Outside of employees’ expectations regarding how they should be 
treated, they also want to have adequate physical working conditions. For 
instance, different smells can help spark different behaviors, and realtors 
frequently tell home sellers to bake cookies right before an open house 
because this will be more inviting and encouraging to potential buyers. 
Something as simple as cookies can be the difference between selling a 
house or not. Employees who enter a store that is well maintained, smells 
nice, and looks nice will have a sense of pride in their workplace. On the 
flip side, employees who walk into a store that is not maintained, stinks, 
and is messy will wonder why they should care if the organization and 
management do not seem to care. If employees have reported to upper 
management that the store is in need of maintenance, the belief that no 
one is going to do anything about it especially increases.
Employing the techniques discussed in CPTED will help foster a cli­
mate that is conducive to employee productivity and will decrease occur­
rences of dishonesty.
Other Deterrents
In today’s world, advances in technology provide for myriad devices 
that will detect and deter employee dishonesty. A very useful software 
program used by retailers is exception reporting. The great thing about 
exception reporting is that employees do not know when it is in use, there-
fore making it unobtrusive. This allows employee point-of-sale (POS) 
activity to be monitored for fraud but does not affect honest employees. 
Exception reporting captures transactions for which desired queries are 
created. It allows stipulations and criteria to be built within the queries. 
The queries make it much easier to isolate the problem and illuminate the 
suspected fraudulent situation. For example, an investigator runs a report 
for a region and notices that the percent to sales for returns is high. This 
is good preliminary information, but the scope is not narrow enough. The 
next query selected should be individual store refund percentages. This 
allows the investigator to narrow down the stores that are contributing 
most to the percentage. Once the stores are narrowed down, individual 

E xploring the Psychology Supporting the Theft Triangle
53

employee transactions should be reviewed. The query will identify the 
particular employees who have the most (most can mean quantity or 
value) refunds. The report should be able to identify the employee, date 
of refund, dollar amount, and possibly what specific SKU was returned. 
Many exception reports will also identify the original transaction if there 
was one. The reporting will make it easier to identify potential fraud, but 
it is not conclusive. The next step in the process is to retrieve the actual 
paperwork involved with the transaction to confirm what the reports are 
indicating.
Discussing the topic of exception reporting and providing copies of 
the reporting to managers and employees during store visits are excellent 
deterrents. After a conversation regarding exception reporting, employees 
will understand that everything they enter into the POS system is always 
being monitored. To further the deterrent potential of exception reporting, 
add a function in the POS system that clearly flags high-risk transactions. 
A suggestion is to have a pop-up screen follow a high-risk transaction on 
the POS system. An example would be a refund transaction in excess of 
$100. As soon as the transaction is entered, the pop-up can say something 
like, “This transaction is being monitored by exception reporting.” If the 
employee did not know about the capabilities, the visual pop-up would 
make them think twice about pocketing the money.
Another effective tool is closed-circuit television (CCTV). In years past, 
loss prevention relied on employees to change videotapes. Today, new 
technology has allowed for camera systems to be continuously backed up 
to an internal hard drive within the unit. Aside from physically destroying 
the unit, this type of system is difficult to defeat. Even tampering with the 
buttons on the recording unit usually does not affect the camera footage 
being backed up. Camera placement is important and should be evaluated 
by someone in loss prevention before installation occurs. Cameras over 
sensitive areas such as registers, safes, hallways, high-dollar products, and 
exits are good places to start the installation. Loss prevention monitoring 
of employees’ activity within a store is much easier today than it has ever 
been. Technology allows for remote computers to watch live footage as it is 
occurring. To make it even easier, many CCTV companies provide a Web 
site that loss prevention team members can log onto to watch a specific 
store. If employees know their behavior is being monitored, they are less 
likely to chance stealing because the risk of getting caught is great.
Again, technology has made the inconspicuous monitoring of different 
systems easy. Internet auction sites provide a venue for both internal and 
external thieves to dispose of stolen product. Software is available to track 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿

particular product on the auction sites. If the software picks up on large 
quantities of a particular product being sold by someone, it can flag the 
seller. The average person would have no way of knowing who the seller 
is without purchasing something and the seller providing an address for 
payment. But today, auction sites such as e-Bay can be solicited for a per­
sonal information request (PIR), which will provide the seller’s registered 
name along with an address. This is effective if a store has high shrinkage 
and no suspects. Once the PIR information is received, it can be cross-refer­
enced against an employee roster. If the seller is also an employee, you may 
have just figured out where your product has been going.
Telling managers and employees about this software and monitor­
ing process is a deterrent for anyone who was going to put stolen prod­
uct for sale on an auction site. One noteworthy case occurred in Chicago, 
Illinois. A manager for a specialty retailer was apprehended after stealing 
in excess of $200,000 in product from three different locations. The pro­
cess took place with the software flagging the product, and a PIR identi­
fied the manager. During the investigative process, it was discovered that 
the product was being removed from the store in a soft-sided lunch box. 
However, the most interesting thing about this case is that the manager 
got away with it for 3 years before it was discovered.
A method that is not used much by retail loss prevention but can be 
very effective is scientific content analysis. When loss prevention people 
first hear about this, they often think it has something to do with hand­
writing analysis. In fact, there is no analysis involved; it is necessary only 
for employees to write their statement on paper and not type it so errors 
(or slips) can be easily seen. Content analysis evaluates such things as sen­
tence structure, pronouns, verbs, nouns, and length of paragraphs. It is a 
very effective method when there are losses, but anyone in the store could 
be responsible. The analysis can usually weed out people who definitely 
did not do a crime and others who are suspect. Following is a statement 
written by an employee who later admitted to stealing a bank deposit. 
Following the statement, information is provided on where the deception 
occurred and how the investigator knew this person was guilty before 
any conversation took place. The name of the individual and some facts 
have been changed to preserve privacy.
To Whom It May Concern:
This is regarding the deposit I, Jane Doe, was to make on July 20. I understand that the 
deposit bag was unsealed, short $145.01 and was a day late. I was told to write a statement 
recounting the events of that day.

E xploring the Psychology Supporting the Theft Triangle

I remember that day only because it had rained a great deal and on my way to work my 
windshield wipers stopped working. I stopped and changed the fuse, but the wiper blades 
fell/broke off rendering them useless and instead of looking for a place that sold them I 
decided to drive without them. I arrived at work frustrated and angry at the circumstances. 
I worked and finished the day as usual but I was in a hurry, anxious to get home as soon as 
possible in case it rained again that night. I was closing starting with the deposit first. I left 
it unsealed in case I had another customer that night. When it came time to leave I threw 
the deposit in my bag and left. On my way to my car I tripped in/on a hole along the path 
leading to the parking lot outside the mall. I dropped everything I was carrying. I didn’t 
notice anything amiss. I got into my truck and went home. I didn’t realize I failed to make 
the deposit until I was at the end of my driveway and instead making a 48-mile round-trip 
drive back to the store, I decided I would drop it off the following day. I honestly cannot 
recall any events that may have lead to the loss of the money. But seeing as how my name 
is on that bag I accept full responsibility. 
On July 29, Jane Doe was phone interviewed. Jane admitted to steal­
ing the $145.01 out of the deposit. Jane said that she needed to repay the 
remainder of a debt she had from two years ago. Jane was asked why she 
thought she could steal the money. She replied that due to the change in 
management the validated slips were not being picked up from the bank 
daily. Because the slips were not picked up daily, she said she figured she 
could get the money back into the bank before anyone noticed.
The content analysis made the interviewer very confident that Jane 
was lying about the missing money before an interview took place. This 
confidence allowed for a quick and easy admission and repayment of the 
loss. Looking at the statement, the interviewer noticed several red flags 
immediately. People who write statements such as Jane’s do not notice that 
they are inserting these flags because they are all subconscious attempts to 
deceive the reader. The first flag was the length of the paragraph discuss­
ing the rain. This is an attempt to stay away from the actual topic (missing 
money) and to focus on something that has no relevance to the issue at 
hand. The rain becomes the focal point of Jane’s entire statement, which 
in her mind makes it easier to deflect the actual events. People trying to 
deceive also use the word left. If you notice, Jane uses the word left twice 
before she allegedly trips and drops everything. Jane wants the reader to 
think that her tripping may have accidentally led to the loss of the money, 
but the word left is inserted twice because she knows what she is going to 
write next is a lie. The most crucial piece of evidence leading to confirmed 
suspicions that Jane is dishonest is how the bank deposit is referenced 
throughout the statement. She calls it “the deposit” throughout most of 
the statement but eventually changes “the deposit” to other terms. After 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿

she has decided to steal the money, the statement ends with, “I decided I 
would drop it off the following day. I honestly cannot recall any events 
that may have lead to the loss of the money. But seeing as how my name 
is on that bag I accept full responsibility.” The deposit becomes “it,” “the 
money,” and “that bag,” all within three sentences. The “it” allows Jane to 
disassociate herself with the events so she is able to rationalize her own 
behavior. It becomes “the money” and no longer a deposit because Jane 
has ownership of the stolen funds and intends to use it. She finishes it 
off with “that bag” because she knows she is guilty of not only breaking 
company policy but also violating the law and wants to remove the situa­
tion away from herself. Finally, Jane never states that she did not steal the 
deposit. She dances around the topic by using different verbiage but never 
comes out and says, “I did not steal the deposit.” She uses the words “can­
not recall any events” at the end of the statement to softly tell the reader 
that she is not saying she did not do it but rather that she cannot remember 
doing it. The final statement where she accepts responsibility for the loss 
of “that bag” is a ploy to take responsibility of the lesser offense, which is 
just for missing money, not stolen money. It is much easier to say that you 
are responsible for a loss that occurred simply because it was in your pos­
session than to admit to stealing it all together. If employees are aware that 
loss prevention people have the ability to analyze statements, they will 
be afraid to write the statement entirely if they are guilty of something. 
Therefore, when employees are asked to write statements recounting the 
events of a day and refuse to do so, this may be an indicator of guilt. Most 
employees are very willing to write a statement if it will clear their name 
quickly and will help find the person who violated the rules.
One method most retailers stay far away from due to liability issues 
is polygraph testing. Many retailers are also under the misconception that 
they cannot ask employees to take a polygraph examination because of 
the Employee Polygraph Protection Act (EPPA) established December 27, 
1988. This federal law established guidelines for polygraph testing and 
imposed restrictions on most private employers but did not take away 
all the rights for employers to ask employees to take the examination if 
certain criteria are met.
The American Polygraph Association suggests that the follow-
ing elements be met before an employer can ask an employee to take an 
examination:
	
1.	The incident must be an ongoing, specific investigation.
	
2.	It must be an identifiable economic loss to the employer.

3.	Obtain a copy of the Employer Polygraph Protection Act of 1988.
	
4.	Provide the employee with a written statement that includes:
	
a.	 Identification of the company and location of employee
	
b.	 Description of the loss or activity under investigation
	
c.	 Location of the loss
	
d.	 Specific amount of the loss
	
e.	 Type of economic loss
	
f.	 How the employee had access to the loss (Note: Access alone 
is not sufficient grounds for polygraph testing)
	
g.	 What kind of reasonable suspicion there is to suspect the 
employee of being involved in the loss
	
5.	The statement provided to employee must be signed by someone 
other than the polygraph examiner, who is authorized to legally 
bind the employee, and must be retained by the employer for at 
least 3 years.
	
6.	Read the Notice to Examinee to the employee, which should be 
signed, timed, dated, and witnessed.
	
7.	Provide the employee with notice 48 hours in advance (not count­
ing weekends or holidays) of the date and time of the scheduled 
polygraph test.
	
8.	Provide employee with written notice of the date, time, and loca­
tion of the polygraph test, including written directions if the 
test is to be conducted at a location other than at the place of 
employment.
	
9.	Maintain a statement of adverse actions taken against the 
employee following a polygraph test.
	 10.	Conduct an additional interview of employee prior to any adverse 
action following a polygraph test.
	 11.	Maintain records of all of the above for a minimum of 3 years.
	 12.	Employees may not waive their rights.
	 13.	Police and investigators are not exempt and must comply if they are 
conducting an employment related polygraph test, that is, when con-
ducting a polygraph test on an internal theft for a missing deposit. 
Information about a polygraph provided to the employer by a police 
officer or investigator is prohibited under the act, since employers 
are not allowed to use, accept, or inquire about the results.
	 14.	There is a $10,000 penalty for each violation of the law.
	 15.	Check out the credentials of the polygraph examiner that you use 
and verify that the examiner meets EPPA requirements. Never 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
58

hesitate to ask for written proof of licensing, liability insurance, 
and so forth.
	 16.	Use your company letterhead on all forms you provide to the 
employee. Have your corporate attorney review your actions to 
assure your compliance with EPPA.
These are the recommendations of the American Polygraph Association, 
but the organization’s internal legal department should also be in the 
loop about polygraph examinations. Letting potential employee suspects 
know that there is a chance that they could be given a polygraph regard­
ing a situation where money or merchandise is missing will serve as a 
good deterrent.
In every business, including retail, there is usually a system for checks 
and balances. The checks and balances keep order within the establish­
ment and allow checkers to understand what is going on in their business. 
Most retailers have a protocol in place that has a manager of the store com­
pleting some type of daily reconciliation. The reconciliation allows the 
manager to know if the store is meeting its goal and if the store internals 
are in line with what is expected. In many cases there is also a protocol 
in place for the manager to check the operational controls. This can focus 
on reviewing items such as returns, voids, discounts, and other transac­
tions that can lead to the loss of money in the store. If there is no such 
program in place for managers to check high-risk transactions daily, there 
should be. If the checks and balances are completed daily and to the level 
that is expected, the opportunity to engage in risky behavior will defi­
nitely decline. Most managers are provided tools that allow them to be 
excellent deterrents for dishonesty, such as double checking paperwork. 
There are many reasons for this. Retailers’ first priority is ensuring that 
the sales goals are being met. Sales should be the number one concern, 
but not at the expense of operational controls. Another reason is the time 
allotted for the review process. If managers do not set specific time aside 
to review the paperwork, it probably will not get done. Finally, leading by 
example is another reason for the lack of emphasis on the review process. 
If the district or regional manager visits the stores within his or her region 
and never checks anything regarding the controls and focuses only on 
sales, this demonstrates to the management team where the priorities are 
and where they are not. Regional or district managers should encourage 
their management staff to set time aside each day to focus on maintain-
ing operational controls. After completion of the review process, manag-
ers should select transactions that they feel are suspicious or they cannot

easily explain. They should bring those transactions to the attention of the 
employees who completed them and ask for an explanation. This process 
does two things:
	
1.	It answers the question of what happened
	
2.	It tells the employee that someone is reviewing the paperwork 
every day.
Sales are important, but profit leaving through various venues through 
the hands of employees defeats the whole purpose of selling.
Regional or district managers should make it a point to inspect con­
trols on every visit. After they are finished discussing the store internals, 
they should ask to see a few controls they expect to be completed, such as 
a daily bank deposit log of all deposits. This tells the management team 
members that their supervisor sees operations as an important part of 
the process. It also creates the same effect as employees knowing their 
managers are looking. Loss prevention people should be communicating 
to the store managers that they should never discover fraud in paperwork 
before their managers do. This communicates to management staff mem­
bers that they are responsible for their business but that the business goes 
beyond ensuring a sales goal is met.
WHAT WORKS BEST
This chapter focused on the contributing factors to workplace deviance—
specifically motivation, low deterrents, and opportunity. The first part of 
the chapter covered employees’ motivation as a contributor to dishonesty, 
and the second half of the chapter demonstrated that the most effective 
way to control dishonesty in the workplace is to institute the proper con-
trols to eliminate opportunity and to evaluate the deterrents. The truth is 
that all three must work in sync with one another to keep honest people 
honest. Keeping associates happy and having dilapidated controls will 
not work. On the flip side, having all the controls in place and treating 
employees poorly will also not work. Two real-life case studies involving 
members of field management for a retail business illustrate in this sec-
tion what works best and what does not. The first study is about a regional 
manager who had the tightest controls on operations she could have.
Susan inspected what she expected, which is very important in eliminating opportunity 
and keeping the deterrent level high. She did not treat employees poorly, and she did 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
60

recognize outstanding performers in the region. If a dollar were missing from a location, 
she would absolutely know about it, sometimes even before the store knew. If an excep­
tion report were sent to her, there would be an answer as to what happened by the end 
of the day. She could have been considered loss prevention’s best friend. There was not 
an operational task she would not do or an audit she would not attend. When inventory 
results were posted, she went through them with a fine-toothed comb and called all 
locations to understand what happened if they had losses. She invited loss prevention to 
attend meetings and gave them more time to speak than most regional managers. She was 
so operationally insistent that she would even go into the stores when managers went 
home for the day so she could go through their paperwork. On occasion, she would send 
in her friends to secretly shop the store so she could understand the level of customer 
service being delivered. Of course, she would review those results with her managers 
after they were completed.
Does it sound like the controls were tight enough that employees 
would not dream of attempting to do anything bad? The answer is no. 
This particular region had more turnover—specifically manager turn­
over—than other regions. This region also had several cases of dishon­
esty. I would assume that readers are wondering what the problem was 
if opportunity was low, deterrents were high, and people were not being 
treated poorly. The problem was that everything was done to the extreme, 
and employees felt like they had their mother watching every move they 
made. Remember how Susan went into the stores when managers left for 
the day to see what they were doing? She also confronted them after a bad 
shop that she deceptively set up without their knowledge or the company’s 
knowledge. Managers felt like one eye was always on them and that their 
supervisor did not trust anything they did. The lack of trust turned good 
managers into poor performers who ended up quitting or dishonest.
There has to be a balance, and supervisors need to show their manag-
ers that they have trust in them. As with any relationship, trust is usually 
the factor that either makes or breaks the relationship. When couples are 
in a committed relationship, they usually begin with trusting the other 
person until the other person breaks that trust with his or her own actions. 
The same should be true with supervisor–subordinate relationships. The 
supervisor should instill trust in her people until something happens to 
take the trust away. Susan never gave her people a chance to be trusted; 
rather, she expected that if she did not find anything suspicious with all 
of her sneaking around, it would eventually lead her to trust them. This 
behavior manifested itself in an environment of “her against them.” The 
relationships that formed were unhealthy, but no one said or did anything 
about it. Susan believed that she was inspecting what she expected, and 

E xploring the Psychology Supporting the Theft Triangle
61

her people believed that an eye was constantly watching to see if they did 
anything wrong. The scenario relayed in Susan’s story can be correlated to 
many different relationships where one person’s behavior will eventually 
lead the other person to do what is believed about him or her. Accusations 
from an insecure wife to her husband about infidelity, even though he 
has done nothing, will ultimately lead to an undesired result. Either the 
husband will grow tired of the futile accusations and leave, or he will 
comply with it and do what he is accused of. The wife wants neither of the 
outcomes, but it is inevitable if it is not curbed in a timely manner. Such is 
the case with Susan’s story. Her folks either left the organization or gave 
her what she was always looking for. Again, Susan wanted neither of the 
outcomes, but it was inevitable because of the behavior.
The next scenario deals with a supervisor who gets the desired results 
with little effort. This is a story about a field manager named Paul.
Paul ran a region in the South that had low shrinkage, great sales results, and very little 
turnover. Those three factors—low shrinkage, good sales, and low turnover—are indi­
cators of a region that is running well. Paul chose to tackle motivation first and devel­
oped strong relationships with each of his managers before anything else took place. 
The relationships went beyond supervisor–subordinate relationships and ventured into 
nonwork-related relationships where both parties believe the other is looking out for the 
other’s best interest. Paul believed that his people produced such good results because 
they cared about themselves, their boss, and the organization. His people believed that 
Paul’s interest in them went far beyond the confines of the organization and into their 
families and who they were as people. These beliefs between Paul and his people allowed 
everything to function as a well-oiled machine. Paul satisfied the requirements for eliminat­
ing motivation by building strong genuine bonds between him and everyone who worked 
for him. The next thing he did was to clarify expectations and consequences for not com­
plying with the expectations. This is where Paul dealt with the opportunity aspect. Paul did 
not leave any opportunity for misunderstanding or anything to be unknown. People who 
violated the expectations were absolutely held accountable for their actions. However, 
Paul’s approach to holding them accountable was diplomatic and respectful. Next, manag-
ers were very clear on what each visit would hold and what Paul would be looking at. Paul 
thoroughly checked the paperwork that loss prevention would look at as part of a routine 
visit. This was not done when managers were not in the store or for the purposes of catch-
ing anyone; rather, it was part of every store visit. Making it routine helped everyone feel 
comfortable and allowed managers to know exactly what would be done. The action of 
checking increased the level of deterrents, which made it difficult for someone to get away 
with something because it would eventually be revealed during the visit. Paul’s management 
techniques produced individuals who were willing to give extra effort and did not want to 
risk their own personal integrity for anything.

Throughout this chapter we have evaluated and reevaluated the com­
ponents of the theft triangle and hopefully have conveyed the message 
that all three areas—motivation, deterrents, and opportunity—will either 
negatively or positively affect everything and anything within a retail 
sales environment. We also tried to determine which of the three is the 
most important. Realistically the answer is all three are equally important. 
But individuals who tackle the motivation aspect first will come out ahead 
of those who do not. So, to answer the question of what works best, refer 
to Paul’s management style and how he was able to tackle all the integral 
components of the theft triangle and make them work in his favor.

How It All Ties Together
One of loss prevention’s most difficult components to achieve within any 
organization is consistency among all practices. Much of the information 
delivered is subject to the audience’s interpretation, and not everyone 
delivers the message the same way. In addition, loss prevention people 
usually cover a vast territory, and information will flow through others 
until it reaches the store-level personnel. When store-level employees are 
uncertain about how to tackle a particular operation or task, they will 
often call someone at another store in their same position. This is where 
much of the consistency breakdown occurs, because these employees 
are not getting the information directly; rather, they are taking informa­
tion from someone who may or may not be doing things correctly. The 
vicious cycle of inconsistency continues as more and more store employ­
ees call one another to gain information instead of going to a source that 
is foolproof.
BUILDING AN EFFECTIVE TRAINING 
AND AWARENESS CAMPAIGN
Achieving consistency through the loss prevention message is difficult 
but not impossible. Launching an effective training and awareness cam-
paign is one of the first steps in getting all employees on the same page. 
Documenting who participated in a specific training can also be useful 
for investigations. If associates are being interviewed for some type of 
policy violation and say they did not know they were not supposed to do

something, documentation that says otherwise could be invaluable. Over 
the many years the authors have conducted loss prevention interviews, 
countless employees who have stolen or violated policy stated they were 
never told they could not. A rebuttal that works fairly well is, “It doesn’t 
state in the policy manual that you can’t burn down the store, but com­
mon sense tells you otherwise.” Letting everyone know the major dos and 
don’ts is the best course of action, and ensuring that managers have all the 
correct tools at their fingertips for the daily operations is a best practice.
Rolling out the loss prevention “good word,” propaganda, or message 
is best done by first initiating some sort of an awareness campaign. The 
campaign can serve different functions such as integrity adherence, opera­
tional controls, and general loss prevention training or can be specific to 
something that is being introduced at the time. One key factor is to keep the 
campaign alive for as long as the organization wishes to disseminate the 
information. If the information is not kept fresh with different techniques, 
people either will forget about it or will believe that the organization does 
not feel like it is a priority any longer. Think of it as an organization letting 
its guard down. To put this statement into perspective, think back to what 
happened immediately after 9/11 with airport security. Security became 
so tight that it was nearly impossible to get on a plane without a hassle. 
Yes, the wait was longer and more aggravating, but the awareness of what 
happened was very clear each time you stepped foot into an airport. It also 
made people feel secure that once they entered the plane, the likelihood 
of a terrorist being able to take over the aircraft was minimal. I remem­
ber shortly after 9/11 being pulled out of line by Transportation Security 
Administration (TSA) and taken to a “special area.” The x-ray device found 
a metal fork in my bag, and the security department wanted to know my 
intentions for the fork. I chuckled a bit when they asked my intentions; they 
did not find it funny at all. I explained that I ate breakfast on the run and 
must have just placed the fork in my bag because I did not have anywhere 
else to put it. The look on their faces told me that I better check next time. I 
was asked to remove the fork and place it into the “weapon holder.” Now, 
years later, the thought of terrorists taking over a plane probably is not the 
first thought when people sit down in their seats. Taking off your shoes 
and eliminating all liquids more than 3 ounces did not happen until some-
one decided to smuggle explosives onto an aircraft. The airlines began to 
let their guard down, and someone took advantage of the situation. As 
with most events, good or bad, the time immediately following is the most 
action oriented. Society is pumped and ready to take action. However, as 
time goes by, fewer and fewer people are involved, and the event is not as

significant because it is no longer part of everyday life. The reason for this 
lack of significance is that society members are not reminded of it consis­
tently. If they were, the message would be kept alive.
The same is true with keeping honest people honest in an organiza­
tion. Employees must be consistently reminded what is right and wrong. 
Employees must also be empowered to run the business with the proper 
tools provided. The next section will discuss how to build an effective 
training and awareness campaign by targeting the different areas neces­
sary for introduction, compliance, buy-in, and how to promote it.
HOW AWARENESS OF A PROBLEM IS ACHIEVED
There is no need to raise awareness if there is not an issue. In addition, not 
everything needs to be so significant and made part of employees’ daily 
business. Addressing only the most critical matters will serve as a best 
practice and will prove to be more efficient. Because specialty retail loss 
prevention people are not in daily communication with every employee 
and in most cases not every store consistently, they must rely on others to 
disseminate information. The following three items will help determine 
which issues are pertinent to the business.
Talking to Field Partners and Store Associates
Talking to employees about the topic of loss prevention will provide 
the department with information regarding what people are thinking. 
Many people might not understand what is expected or believe that 
their supervisor does not value loss prevention as an important topic for 
discussion. The goal is to inspire a shared vision of how loss prevention 
is a necessary part of doing business and protecting company assets.
Asking Questions and Listening to What 
Associates Are Telling You on Store Visits
Asking specific questions about dishonesty or the understanding of audit-
ing procedures will allow the loss prevention department to know just 
how much everyone else knows: don’t leave any stones unturned. If an 
employee makes a comment such as, “Everyone is doing [violating a cer-
tain policy]”, explore that topic further. The incorrect information may 
stem from much higher up in management ranks than at the store level.

Clarifying the Reasons Associates Provide 
for Stealing or Resigning
People who leave the organization either willingly or unwillingly are a 
wealth of information for loss prevention. Never leave an investigative 
interview with a lack of understanding of underlying causes. Do not hesi­
tate to participate or conduct exit interview calls after managers resign 
from the organization. Past employees give such good interviews because 
they really have nothing to lose. Current employees are often reluctant to 
provide useful information because of fear it might implicate them or oth­
ers in wrongdoing, which may lead to job loss.
UNDERSTANDING THE NEEDS OF YOUR BUSINESS
Not every organization needs the same awareness message at the same 
time. Understanding where the deficiencies are and targeting them for 
maximum exposure to attentive awareness training are the most effec­
tive. One specific campaign will not work for all retailers, but the general 
foundation will be the same. For instance, a grocery store may want to 
target employees eating candy that has been damaged out of stock. They 
believe that employees will intentionally damage bags of candy so they 
have something to munch on later in the day. The practice within the gro­
cery store has been to allow employees to have out-of-stock candy, but an 
increase in “ripped bags” has occurred over the years, which has cost the 
company unnecessarily. The campaign or training could focus on destroy­
ing candy immediately after a bag has been found to be compromised. 
This type of campaign or training is specific to grocery and would not 
be useful for an apparel chain. However, the concept can be applied to 
apparel, because if employees are allowed to purchase damaged clothing 
at a discounted rate, they are more likely to damage the clothing them-
selves. There are three questions to ask when attempting to understand 
the needs of your business.
What Types of Tools Are Most Effective 
for Training and Awareness?
Again, this depends on the business. For distribution or delivery centers, 
posters are a good reminder for loss prevention messages. It is necessary 
to update the posters with different messages to keep interest. For a retail 

H ow It All Ties Together
67

store with limited space, pamphlets and wallet cards given to associates 
are good reminders. Having a loss prevention manual available is also a 
good choice.
How Do You Intend to Get the Message Out?
As discussed already, there are different ways to get the awareness 
message out, but not all are through a physical or written means. You 
will find that stories with a message stick in employees’ minds. Provide 
them with a story that has a message embedded, especially if people 
have lost their job because of an investigation. Talking about the mer­
its of the investigation’s most interesting characteristics, without using 
names or identifiers, is a good way to get the awareness story across to 
employees.
What and How Will the Information Be Absorbed 
and What Information Will Be Retained?
Not everything that someone hears or reads will be retained. Make 
sure to reiterate the most important parts if providing training in 
the form of facilitation. Begin with what is most important, and end 
with what is most important. If a phone number on a poster is what 
should be remembered, make it bigger than the rest of the information. 
Repetition of the important communication points helps employees to 
remember them.
INCORPORATING INTEGRITY AWARENESS 
INTO YOUR CULTURE
Is every organization ready for a culture that flourishes with integrity? 
You would hope the answer is yes, but that is not always the case. Some 
organizations are used to cutting corners or just bending the rules and not 
having to answer to anyone. For anything to work properly, it must begin 
at the top. An organization cannot expect store-level employees to comply 
with directives if higher-level management is not complying. There are 
three areas to consider when incorporating something new into existing 
organizational culture.

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
68

Have a Clear Understanding of Where Your Culture 
Currently Is and Where You Want It to Go
How an organization carries out terminations gives many loss prevention 
people a very clear understanding of its culture. Some organizations do 
not have a culture of equality and terminate with a “depending on who 
it is” attitude. Associates can often be “saved” from termination if they 
have the right advocate looking out for them. Wwhat was once completely 
black and white is contaminated with a clouded shade of gray. If these 
organizations are not ready for a complete overhaul, help them to start off 
small and work their way back up.
Prepare for Resistance and Commit to Overcome It
It may seem like everyone would embrace developing a culture conducive 
to integrity, but in reality many who do not play by the rules find abso­
lute integrity to be a burden. Positioning your proposal to highlight the 
benefits and how the organization will benefit is the most effective way to 
achieve buy-in.
Ensure That You Are Modeling the Way
One important rule in the world of loss prevention is to never let any 
employee from the organization see you bending or breaking the rules 
inside or outside of work. Loss prevention people—also considered to 
be the protectors of the organization—are held to a different standard. 
They are expected to play by the rules at all times. One individual in the 
department who does not play by the rules could ruin it for everyone 
else.
BUILD RELATIONSHIPS AND GET CONNECTED
In an earlier chapter we discussed the importance of relationships; this 
theme will be evident throughout the book. Launching an awareness 
campaign requires good relationships. Loss prevention team members 
may have devised the best program on the planet, but if they have not 
taken the time to get to know their audience, it may have been time 
ill spent because employees will not understand the whys behind the 
program.

H ow It All Ties Together

Spend Time Traveling with Partners and 
Getting to Know Them and Their Needs
There is something to be said for the human relationships that develop 
between loss prevention people and others within the organization. Loss 
prevention people who are doing things right are often the most trusted 
in the organization. This level of trust is developed from consistent, non­
threatening interactions between individuals. Spending time with field 
management people and really getting to know who they are will open 
the door for them and for you.
Build Trust
Trust does not happen overnight with any relationship; therefore, it 
should not be expected to happen automatically simply because someone 
is in a position of authority. Loss prevention people will realize they have 
achieved trustworthiness when they are overwhelmed with unsolicited 
phone calls from employees who want to provide information on integ­
rity issues.
Follow through on Commitments and Provide Feedback
If commitments were made to someone in the organization, those com­
mitments should be kept. If commitments cannot be kept for whatever 
reason, peers and leaders within loss prevention should be asked to give 
a hand in getting that audit done or investigation started. Letting employ-
ees know where they stand is important for auditing and investigations. 
It is also important if the campaign focuses on providing information or 
getting information.
GET COMMITMENT FROM FIELD PARTNERS
Regardless of what type of campaign is initiated, the only way for it 
to survive is to have the targeted audience comply with what is adver-
tised. A solid relationship in the beginning with the people toward 
whom the campaign is geared will allow them to accept and embrace 
the message.

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿

Get a Commitment that They Will Support Your Efforts
Support is even more necessary if the campaign is not something that the 
entire company is asking for. If something is specific to a region or par­
ticular area based on specific factors, discuss why you believe it is neces­
sary for this particular area to have extended or new rules when no one 
else does. Employees are more likely to comply with change if they under­
stand why the change is necessary and how it will benefit them.
Ensure that All Field Managers Are Promoting 
Awareness on Their Individual Store Visits
If the awareness campaign has some type of handout for employees to 
view, provide them to the field people responsible for the stores. This will 
not only get the message across but will also show that the direct supervi­
sion of the store is supporting what is in the message. If the campaign is 
geared toward new procedures of some sort, ensure that field people are 
checking compliance during their visit and are reporting the findings.
REWARDS AND RECOGNITION
In the world of loss prevention it is very easy to address everything that 
is being done wrong because that is what we look for. Things done right, 
though, often go unnoticed because they are expected. Employers have 
certain expectations of the people they hire, and one of those is that the 
rules of the organization will be followed. If that were always the case, loss 
prevention within organizations would not be necessary. Recognizing and 
rewarding employees for adhering to rules and regulations will ensure 
that correct behavior will continue.
Find Ways to Reward Associates for Doing the Right Thing
There is a great video by National Geographic photographer Dewitt Jones 
titled Celebrate What’s Right with the World. It is a powerful documen-
tary that teaches people not to ignore the little things in life but to cel-
ebrate them. Loss prevention departments can learn a lot from this video 
because it puts aside the everyday negativity in the world and illuminates 
the wonder of human simplicity—people doing what they love to do for 
no given reason, and appreciation of one another just for being human

beings. Catch employees doing the right thing, even if it is expected, and 
reward them. Positive reinforcement for employees, as with children, is a 
key factor is sustaining the desired behavior.
Single Associates Out and Recognize Them for 
Making an Impact in the Field of Loss Prevention
Meetings are a great place to celebrate employees, and to thank them for 
making a difference in the organization. Creating a certificate or some 
kind of physical reward and presenting it to employees in front of all their 
peers can be instrumental in reinforcing positive employee behavior. 
Many employees desire to be part of the loss prevention department, but 
not everyone will have that chance. Those making a difference and desir­
ing to contribute more can play a small role in training their peers on the 
topic of loss prevention.
Publicize What Associates Are Doing to 
Contribute to Training and Awareness.
If your organization has an internal Web site or newsletter, find a way to 
incorporate employees who are contributing in a good way to loss preven­
tion. Most organizations will have something that celebrates good inter-
nal results such as sales; therefore, it should not be too difficult to find a 
place for advertisement.
IMPLEMENTING AN INTEGRITY AWARENESS CAMPAIGN
The first step after developing a program is to get your department’s buy-
in. If you want to roll out a new program to the organization, complete the 
necessary research for the topic first. After the research is complete, put 
together a prototype of what the program will look like and give it first to 
people in the loss prevention department for their suggestions. This will 
provide many points of view as well as potentially missed items.
Have Peers and Supervisors Provide Feedback on Changes
Not everyone will always agree with the approach or perspective taken on 
various topics. Even people within loss prevention believe differently about 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
72
© 2011 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC
the topic of dishonesty and how to best control losses. When people do not 
agree with your views, it does not always mean they do not have anything 
valuable to contribute. It is better to get the disagreements dealt with in the 
department as opposed to having field- or store-level employees disagree 
with something that could have been fixed had you taken the suggestion.
Target Influential People
This is the time when it pays to know people. If your loss prevention 
department does not have a group that can build a campaign or program 
from start to finish (as most do not), you will have to rely on others to help 
the cause. Be patient with the people you need. Loss prevention initiatives 
are usually not a first priority and will almost always take a second seat to 
those such as sales programs. Because you probably can’t do it alone, fig­
ure out who will be necessary to help you. But, understand that you will 
be on their “list,” so remain patient until they can meet with you.
Know Who Has the Power to Promote the Program
The people who help you develop the physical program are not the same 
as those necessary to promote it. In most organizations it is imperative to 
have the support of the operations department for any program to sur­
vive. The people in this department will drive the field- and store-level 
employees to do what you need them to do. If you can get them to send 
out a communication supporting what you are trying to do, you have won 
the first battle.
Understand Who the Key Players Are in the Rollout
As with the development and promotion, yet another group will need to 
be involved with the rollout. If the intent is to saturate the entire organi-
zation, usually training and development team members will be the key 
players. They are responsible for most rollouts and know how to make 
it work. They will also understand the challenges and how to overcome 
them, one of which is often making sure the information is saturated 
throughout the organization. Having the program on CD or DVD will 
be easier than disseminating the information firsthand because of the 
time involved. But if each store does not have access to a computer termi-
nal to watch the CD or DVD, that will also be a challenge. If the program 
requires every associate to complete it, such as ethics training, how will 

H ow It All Ties Together
73

it be known that every associate has indeed completed it? The training 
and development team will also help standardize the program from a 
formatting standpoint. Organizations usually have a logo or coloring 
that is standard for their advertising; therefore, if something is going to 
be introduced company-wide, standardization is often required.
Make Sure Information Is Moving up the Ladder
The success of the campaign or program is also dependent on how 
many people at the top believe in it. If there is not any executive sup­
port, it will likely not stick. The higher-level executives within the loss 
prevention department will play a key role in moving the information 
up the ladder.
Write a Business Proposal
If there are costs involved—either actual monetary cost or employee pro­
ductivity costs—it is usually necessary to create a business proposal out­
lining the following three items:
•	 Proposal description
•	 Justification
•	 Cost benefit
Proposal Description
Define what the program is and what it entails. Use terms easily under­
stood by the general population about how the program will work. Be 
very specific about what you want. For instance, if the intent is to roll out 
the program company-wide, make sure to include that information in the 
description.
Justification
Define why it is necessary to have a program such as you are describing. 
If the program is focused on dishonesty, broadly describe how employee 
dishonesty adversely affects organizations. Also make specific reference 
to your own organization and why this type of specific program is nec-
essary. If there is a way to quantify information and to place statistical 
data, do so in this section. If the person reviewing the proposal cannot 
understand why it is necessary to make change, the program will likely 
die at this stage.

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿

Cost Benefit
Everything is about return on investment (ROI). Explain how the pro­
gram will save the organization money in the short- or long-term. It may 
be impossible to accurately forecast exactly just how much money can be 
saved, but an educated guess based on facts will be sufficient. Something 
such as employee dishonesty costs the company directly by actual inven­
tory loss and productivity loss because of the people, and indirectly by 
those who must investigate and resolve the claims.
The following sections cover some topics that can be addressed 
in an awareness campaign to capture management attention and 
collaboration.
METHODS TO CONTROL AND UNDERSTAND TURNOVER
One statistical figure often consistent among organizations is that if 
turnover is high in the organization, or one brand of the organization, 
high shrinkage will often follow. Low turnover usually equates to lower 
shrinkage. Turnover costs companies large amounts of money each year 
because for every one person who leaves there must be a new untrained 
person to replace the person who left. Hiring and training costs are stag­
gering for business in America today. Any awareness campaign or pro-
gram with results proven to lower turnover either directly or indirectly 
will be welcomed.
Research How the Organization Evaluates Turnover
A breakdown of turnover statistical figures usually can be reviewed, 
such as the breakdown of hourly versus salary, part time versus full 
time, and geographical information. Then move on to research the 
causes of turnover.
Understand What the Causes of Turnover Are
Figure out how many employees are leaving willingly and unwillingly. 
Also contact the human resource department to receive the findings of 
exit interviews, if they are completed. If a particular region is having 
more turnover than other similar regions, place emphasis in that area.

See How Loss Prevention Awareness 
Can Help Decrease Turnover
Develop an awareness campaign that focuses on decreases in turnover, 
but with a loss prevention spin on it. Since a correlation is known to exist 
between turnover and shrinkage, a campaign geared toward turnover 
will conquer two never-ending retail battles. It will be much easier to 
promote a campaign that focuses on something everyone in the com­
pany is concerned about as opposed to something that is very specific to 
one department.
NEW MANAGER ASSIMILATION
Getting to managers before they have a chance to make poor decisions 
or learn poor habits is one of the most important components to control­
ling shrinkage. After interviewing a new manager for posting thousands 
of dollars of stolen product for sale on eBay, it was learned that if she 
had known the company could monitor eBay she would not have done it. 
Something as simple as information can be the difference between some­
one stealing and not stealing. Developing a protocol for new managers 
that focuses on loss prevention training and awareness will decrease the 
number of managers who are willing to risk being dishonest. It will also 
teach managers on what they should be looking for to identify dishonesty 
in their own environment.
Loss Prevention and Associate Relations or Human 
Resources to Target New Managers for Awareness
As new managers are hired, one of their first training sessions should 
revolve around the role of associate relations (AR) and human resources 
(HR) and loss prevention. Making the training part of the orientation pro-
cess will ensure that every manager receives it. It is not a bad idea to have 
new managers sign an integrity statement and place it in their file. During 
the training managers should have a good understanding of exactly what 
AR/HR and loss prevention do for the company. This information should 
be very specific in explaining that loss prevention conducts investigations 
to figure out who is stealing from the company and that AR facilitates 
decisions on what the company reaction would be to someone who stole. 
If your company prosecutes internal theft, make sure to explain that as 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿

well. This approach hopefully will “scare” new employees into doing the 
right thing.
New Managers Should Go into Their Role with 
Clear Understanding and Expectations
Getting to new managers before they have a chance to do anything wrong 
both intentionally and unintentionally will greatly benefit the organiza­
tion. Laying down clear expectations will undoubtedly create a platform 
for success. Many companies have something like a “Duty Act,” which 
requires managers to speak up. If managers do not know they could lose 
their job for ignoring loss prevention problems, they may be tempted to do 
just that.
Building a training and awareness campaign will frequently pose 
a challenge for anyone who desires to make change. A compilation of 
many different methods may be the best way of providing the full effect. 
Remembering that tying in the goals of the campaign with company initia­
tives will strengthen the likelihood that the entire company will embrace 
the cause. Knowing who to go to for different parts of the campaign will 
also be instrumental in speeding up the rollout.
HOW TO GET EXECUTIVE BUY-IN AND 
DEALING WITH RESISTANCE
Many loss prevention people feel like they are in a never-ending battle 
with people outside of their department. This is true for both store- and 
field-level loss prevention personnel. The “us against them” mentality 
is very hard to overcome. This seems absurd because the loss preven-
tion department is usually the group to enforce policies and procedures. 
Why would anyone resist such a valiant effort put forth by a group with 
the utmost interest in protecting the company profits? Many executives 
in organizations have the perception that “if it isn’t broken, don’t fix it.” 
If often seems like the only time many executives are willing to tighten 
the controls quickly is if the government mandates such an action. This 
should not be the case since the loss prevention goals within the organi-
zation are aligned with company goals but are just achieved differently. 
The next section discusses creative ways to get buy-in and how to over-
come resistance.

Get to Know the Decision Makers
The perception that loss prevention team members are the organizational 
police cannot be changed unless the people in charge have a chance to 
interact with the departmental activities. Executives should be invited to 
participate in an audit or at least to see the results of the audit findings. 
Executives should also understand what type of infractions are plaguing 
the organization and being eradicated by loss prevention. So many people 
in loss prevention are stretching themselves far beyond the confines of 
their demographic organization and are helping other organizations or 
individuals with their expertise and wisdom assisting other companies 
as well as their own. When people in loss prevention are recognized out­
side the organization for their achievements, this should be brought to the 
attention of the company executives.
Ensure that Executives Understand the 
Different Roles of Loss Prevention
When I started in business over a decade ago, my job was to remove cus­
tomers and employees who stole from the company. There was not much 
training going on or anything outside of getting rid of the bad guy. Loss 
prevention departments nationally and internationally have come a long 
way since then and have advanced to a multifaceted brigade of individu­
als with diversified expertise. Loss prevention team members today wear 
many hats, such as auditor, investigator, trainer, speaker, consultant, and 
someone to be relied upon by their constituents. Executives should under­
stand that the role of loss prevention within an organization is more than 
just a necessary evil.
Talk Their Talk
If you want to positively influence and win admiration quickly with exec-
utives, leave loss prevention alone in the beginning and discuss the orga-
nization’s current events. All loss prevention people should know where 
the company stands financially, how sales are for the current period, and 
stock prices. Knowing information that executives are drivers of and can-
not live without will give you insider access. It will also probably catch 
executives off guard because most believe that the only item up for dis-
cussion with a loss prevention person is theft. One additional key point 
is that all company acronyms and any current terms or jargon should be 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
78

known by loss prevention. Many organizations have different promotions 
that they have unique terminology for such as “BOGO” (i.e., buy one, get 
one free or half off). Loss prevention should be up to speed with current 
promotions circulating in the organization.
Provide Statistics on Savings
Loss prevention should provide some type of biannual or annual report to 
the organization that reflects what the department is recovering or remov­
ing. It is always good to include information such as admitted dollars by 
employees. If there was a large case resolved during the year, it might 
be wise to project how much loss there would have been if loss preven­
tion had not dealt with it. For instance, assume that an employee admits 
to stealing $5,000 in fraudulent returns over the last four months. This 
equates to $1,250 per month, which in turn amounts to $15,000 for the year 
that would have been lost had the employee not been caught. If audits are 
being completed and the store’s shrinkage lowers after the employee is 
caught, provide that type of statistical information.
A Place for Information
Most retail stores will have some evidence of loss prevention within the 
confines of the establishment. Physical reminders like posters and pam­
phlets are reminders to line-level employees that loss prevention exists 
in the organization. A sample of an awareness pamphlet is shown in 
Figure 4.1. It can be folded in three to make a nice handout during store 
visits. Because corporate executives are not often in store locations, 
employees should receive information about the existence of a loss pre-
vention department in their organization in a readily accessible place, 
such as an Intranet site if there is one. Loss prevention should have its 
own portal page displaying the department matrix, forms (e.g., incident 
reports), noteworthy cases, and current events. This provides executives 
with an avenue should they want to learn more about what it is the depart-
ment is doing.
Attend Meetings
Most executives do not routinely travel to stores, but many will venture 
out for a meeting in which something new is being rolled out or in which 
they wish to have input. Meetings such as this are always good grounds 

H ow It All Ties Together
79
© 2011 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC
to interact with executives. Loss prevention team members’ attendance 
will demonstrate to executives that they are team players. If a presentation 
by the department is requested, always start with the celebratory parts 
first. Recognize employees for a job well done and how they contributed 
to the good of the organization.
Gaining Key Support
Departments such as inventory control, operations, and sales audit are 
absolutely necessary to the loss prevention department. If loss prevention 
members discover some type of systematic issue affecting the inventory, it 
is always advantageous to have someone available to call. Often the lower-
level employees are not willing to put in the time to resolve problems found 
by loss prevention for fear it might cause them more work, so having some-
one higher in the department’s structure may help. Operations is usually 
the group that puts roadblocks in the way of loss prevention initiatives. 
Before trying to roll out something that might be viewed as controversial, 
it is a good idea to review it with someone in operations to gain the depart-
ment’s support and input. Sales audit is the group that deals with missing

bank deposits and credit card charge backs. Both deposits and charge backs 
are heavy hitters of profit and a big interest to loss prevention. To make 
matters worse, this is also the area in which loss prevention usually has the 
most trouble gathering information because of account numbers and confi­
dential information that the bank and credit card company are hesitant to 
provide, especially with privacy concerns and credit card industry controls. 
Knowing someone in the sales audit department who has the ability to gain 
confidential information will be critical in gathering evidence for a case.
All of these areas will help a loss prevention department build a good 
foundation to support its initiatives. Resistance is encountered because 
many loss prevention people approach the topic through their own eyes 
rather than through the eyes of the executive. When loss prevention peo­
ple want to get something done in this field, they must walk in others’ 
shoes. Many loss prevention people see everything as black and white, 
whereas everyone else in the organization either intentionally or uninten­
tionally inserts gray into situations. If any unclear issues are dealt with 
prior to the proposal by the introducer, the resistance may not even be an 
issue. Timing is also an important component for not encountering resis­
tance. If loss prevention team members wish to roll out a new program, 
they must learn to time it effectively, especially if it costs money. If sales 
are weak and the program or initiative costs money, waiting to propose 
it to the executive committee is a grand idea. If what the loss prevention 
department wants to implement can be tied in with something the orga­
nization is bringing out, this is another step in the right direction. This 
way it is not something costly or extra for stores to do; rather, it is just 
an additional tool of a familiar program. Most executives want to run an 
organization they can be proud of and that exhibits integrity. With the 
right approach, even the most reluctant executive will agree to what is 
best for the organization.
BUILDING A CULTURE OF INTEGRITY
Every organization is looking for the foolproof method of dealing with 
losses. As many loss prevention people already know (and this book dis-
cusses), there are countless ways to deal with losses. Some methods are 
more effective than others for sustaining the desired results. We have all 
probably been to a restaurant at some point in our life where children 
were completely out of control, disrupting everyone and everything in 
their path. I will also guess that many of us have looked at the parents and

perhaps have even commented about their parenting skills. Much of the 
blame is put on the parents for children behaving poorly because society 
believes that the children are a reflection of the parents and their ability 
to properly raise them. In the same way, children who are respectable 
and behave properly in public are viewed as descendents of their good 
child-rearing parents. The same is true for employees of an organization: 
they are a reflection of their employer. If the employer accepts a culture 
that tolerates losses, then losses are what they get. It is very easy to put up 
a camera or run exception reporting excessively to uncover dishonesty, 
but it is much more difficult to create an environment where employees 
do not tolerate losses and help to reduce them. That is why organizations 
spend millions of dollars in their attempt to deter losses: it is the easiest 
way out.
Creating a culture of integrity within an organization is one of the 
more difficult tasks to undertake, especially if the current culture is not 
conducive to doing the right thing. Harvey Helms made one of the most 
profound statements I have ever heard during a seminar: “Culture eats 
policy and procedure for lunch.” Regardless of what parameters are in 
place, the culture within the store or organization will overtake any ini­
tiatives loss prevention attempts to implement. A store culture in which a 
blind eye is turned to theft and then installs cameras will not eradicate the 
problem. The employees will figure out what is going on and simply find a 
safe alternative to steal product or money from the organization. The goal 
of building a culture of integrity is to have employees do the following:
•	 Respect the rules because they want to.
•	 Be shameful of any wrongdoing.
•	 Not accept anything that is adverse to the organization.
•	 Police one another.
•	 Report abnormalities immediately so they can be dealt with.
Another reason employers are reluctant in even attempting such a 
concept is because results cannot be seen quickly. To successfully imple-
ment a program that focuses on employee integrity, employers will reap 
the rewards in the future, not in the immediate present. It takes time to 
recondition employees to a new way of thinking and behaving. Consider 
it a way of desensitizing employees from what they are accustomed to. 
If done correctly, employers will have created an environment where 
employees flourish not only in integrity but also in productivity.
When deciding to implement a program that focuses on recondi-
tioning employees to be pro integrity, one must understand why it is not

already in existence. To some degree, most organizations will have a cul­
ture of integrity in place, but when employees are not flourishing in their 
positions, most employers will not look in the direction of integrity play­
ing a part in lack of productivity. It is very apparent when integrity is 
one of the most important aspects of an organization and not just words 
posted in an organizational mission statement attached to a back wall. 
The difference between having a true culture of integrity and a fake one 
is the will of the employees. Organizations that have developed the true 
concept do not have to force their employees to do the right thing because 
employees do it on their own. Understanding the areas that restrict orga­
nizations from having a true culture of integrity is an important deter­
minant to whether the blinders can be removed to make the organization 
open to such a concept. If the top-level leadership is causing the lack of 
integrity, it will be a long row to hoe. If it is simply inconsistency among 
employees, however, this will be an easy path. Each organization must 
first evaluate its roadblocks before deciding that a culture of integrity is 
the way to go. In addition, if the foundation is not solid, the rest of the 
parts will crumble. The process is built from the bottom up to ensure that 
the ethical foundation is the strongest part to the program.
Japan is a good example of where culture works as an effective deter­
rent for crime. Its justice system is not significantly different from other 
countries, but its results are. Countries such as Jamaica and Russia have an 
enormous issue with murder and other violent crimes. Japan’s economic 
success over these two countries contributes somewhat to the lower crime 
rate. However, Japan’s crime rate is even lower than it is in the United 
States, and that is because the culture within the country does not tolerate 
bad behavior. It is unacceptable to be deviant. Individuals in Japan who 
decide to engage in deviant behavior are treated like outcasts in society. 
These individuals lose the respect of their families, friends, and society 
in general. After their period of incarceration they are allowed back into 
society but are forced to live a life of isolation. There is no greater pain 
than having persons you love and know wanting nothing to do with you. 
Japan’s culture allows for safer streets and less burden on police and cre-
ates well-rounded human beings.
On the other hand, countries such as the United States tolerate crime 
and accept criminals back into society. Family members often welcome 
home, upon release, husbands and wives who have gone to prison. Serial 
killers receive fan mail and wedding proposals from those who know how 
heinous their crimes were. How mentally damaged does someone have to 
be to propose marriage to an individual incarcerated for dismembering

another human being? It is absolutely ridiculous that people in the United 
States will tolerate such behavior.
I have had the distinct pleasure of getting to know Judge James 
McKensie (Taboo on the National Geographic Channel), who became the 
judge of Dayton, Tennessee, which is part of Rhea County, in 1998. When he 
became judge, he evaluated the types of crimes and sentences associated 
with them and found that most shoplifters were put on probation without 
doing any real jail time. Giving shoplifters probation is fairly standard 
practice throughout the nation. Prior to 1998, Dayton, Tennessee, was no 
different. McKensie evaluated Dayton’s current practice of probation and 
found it was not really working because theft in general continued to rise 
in the county. In 2000, he began to read articles on other different methods 
of discipline judges are using. He was particularly fond of the method that 
allows offenders to clearly know they have wronged the retailer and the 
community. McKensie found that other judges were using different forms 
of shaming similar to Japan. After completing his research, McKensie 
decided to implement a new discipline structure in Dayton that would 
make people who violate the rules, specifically shoplifters, pay dearly for 
their behavior. His method is as follows (see Figure 4.2):
•	 If a suspect either pleads guilty or is found guilty for theft or 
shoplifting from a retailer, the choice is to:
•	 Spend 10 days in jail or
•	 Spend four days walking in front of the retailer they stole 
from carrying a sandwich sign that reads:
I stole from [retailer’s name] and I’m ordered to walk by Judge 
McKensie.
McKensie said that specifying on the sign that he is the one respon-
sible for this person’s punishment alleviates the retailer from responsibil-
ity and allows the judge to take full responsibility. The shaming method 
does not discriminate between juvenile and adult offenders. Individuals 
14 years of age and older can still be made to walk. If a juvenile is ordered 
to walk and the parents do not agree with the decision, parents can 
appeal. There has been only one appeal since 2000. Once adult offenders 
are found guilty, they are banned from setting foot inside of the retailer 
they stole from for life. If the retailer occupies multiple locations, the adult 
offender is banned from every one of them. Once juvenile offenders are 
found guilty, they are banned until the age of 18. After the age of 18 they 
are allowed to return and this time to pay for merchandise they want.

However, if they decide to steal again after the age of 18, they will incur a 
life ban if found guilty.
I asked McKensie what happens if the offender decides not to finish 
all four days and cuts it short. Not to worry, he told me; he fixes that prob­
lem as well. Offenders who decide to cut out a little early finish off their 
sentence in jail or are ordered to walk an additional four days. The judge 
said that some individuals do not want the ridicule that comes along with 
their public humiliation so they show up to serve their walking sentence 
wearing a ski mask to hide their appearance. According to McKensie, 
however, faces must be clearly visible. He believes that society needs to 
see the people who committed the crime, and the offenders must know 
they are being seen and often recognized by friends and family. If they 
are caught wearing any camouflage to conceal their identity, they will be 
asked to remove it or forfeit the walking, which in turn leads to jail time.
McKensie said that the community appreciates this method, as do the 
retailers. It is nothing new that retailers will have to raise prices because 
of thieves, which in turn places an added burden on the public. The judge 
believes that adults emulate how they grew up and that parents have a 
responsibility to teach their children to act appropriately. He went on 
Figure 4.2  Example of the type of punishment Judge James McKensie issues to 
shoplifters who are convicted.

to say that the work ethic in America has changed. Many people want a 
check from the government or to steal from the public instead of working 
for what they need. The judge said he believes in his method of discipline 
because it provides a good example for the children in the community, 
which is easily seen when kids go shopping with their parents and see 
embarrassing consequences of shoplifting for offenders.
One thing I learned during our discussion together is that McKensie 
believes one of the worst things in the world is a thief. He wants to ensure 
that the society of tomorrow, the children of Dayton, Tennessee, will learn 
early lessons on good moral behavior and that the people involved in devi­
ant behavior have learned their lesson. Yes, the offenders have definitely 
learned their lesson, at least in Dayton, Tennessee. An extraordinary sta­
tistic uncovered during the conversation is this:
The judge reports that he has not had one person reoffend with regards 
to shoplifting since 2000.
The method of public shaming has proven its effectiveness again and 
again. So why do other judges not employ this discipline method nation­
wide to help retailer curb the theft problem? There is one simple answer, 
according to McKensie: some judges are afraid of being publicly ridiculed. 
Members of the American public refuse to hold one another accountable 
for bad behavior. There are so many crimes labeled as victimless or non­
violent with such low levels of punishment that it is more of an inconve­
nience than a deterrent for offenders. Shoplifting is one of those crimes. 
McKensie said that his method not only deters individuals from stealing 
again but also saves taxpayers money by not having to house the offend­
ers inside jails.
In 2008 a new reality show aired on the Fox Network titled Moment 
of Truth. People are given a lie detector test prior to being on the show 
in which they are asked 21 questions; they are not provided with the 
results. When the show airs, the contestants are asked the same 21 
questions live in front of an audience of family and friends. The more 
questions they answer truthfully, the more money they win. The con-
testants have the option to either keep the same answer they originally 
provided or change their answer. However, they do not know if the lie 
detector picked up deception during the initial answer; therefore, they 
are gambling if they attempt to lie. If they are caught lying once, they 
lose all their money. Many people lost their money because they lied,

and as of September 2008, no one had reached the $1 million mark for 
telling the truth.
Interestingly enough, more than 80% of the people on the show 
were asked if they have ever stolen from their employer or falsified 
documents at any time during their career. The response from the con­
testants was almost always yes. The thefts ranged from food to money. 
The falsification ranged from medical reports to family-owned busi­
ness financial documents. People watching the show can hear and see 
the audience’s responses. When the contestants answer yes to stealing 
from their employer (this is not one of the questions where contestants 
were caught lying; they readily admit to the dishonesty), audience 
members laugh. However, when they said yes to cheating on their 
spouses, audience members boo to signify their disapproval for that 
particular behavior.
This reaction by society tells us that stealing from employers is not a 
big deal but that adultery is. That is why employers have such a difficult 
time combating internal theft: it is accepted by society in general. The 
United States is not alone when it comes to employee theft; it exists on 
every continent. I remember speaking with a security professional from 
South Africa some years back about how culture affects deviance in the 
workplace. I asked him about workplace theft in Africa, and he replied 
that it is not much different from the United States.
Organizations must create a culture that does not tolerate counterpro­
ductive behavior (see Figure 4.3). Organizations must start from the inside 
out. A book titled Absolute Honesty by Larry Johnson and Bob Phillips pro­
vided six principles regarding how to create an ethical infrastructure.
	
1.	Tell the truth, which deals with the reasons people are not honest, 
such as:
	
a.	 Fear of retribution
	
b.	 Fear of paying the price
	
c.	 Fear of losing face
	
d.	 Fear of being disliked
	
e.	 Fear of losing competitive advantages
	
2.	Tackle the problem, which focuses on dealing with issues at 
hand—not allowing problems to fester and clustering them into a 
forever-burning inferno.
	
3.	Disagree and commit, which allow employees to have a voice; 
however, once a decision is made, employees are to support it.

H ow It All Ties Together

4.	Welcome the truth, in which employers are allowed to have an 
open-door policy for employees. It creates an environment where 
employees feel safe to tell the truth and how to overcome defen­
sive behavior.
	
5.	Reward the messenger, which occurs when those who tell the 
truth are rewarded. It is positive reinforcement for employees to 
be rewarded for ethical behavior.
	
6.	Build a platform of integrity, which creates an atmosphere of open 
communication and trust.
I took each of the principles and developed them into an integrity and 
ethics training program for use in a retail business setting. Each princi­
ple has an associated training module. Each module has a scenario that 
revolves around an ethical dilemma that must be resolved by the employ-
ees taking the program.
The program takes about 4 hours to facilitate. The employees are pro-
vided with a current copy of the code of ethics and a participant’s guide 
for the culture of integrity program. The guide has areas that need to be 
filled out by the participants.
For the first principle, tell the truth, employees are taught about the 
reasons that truth telling is difficult. Most will be able to relate to at least 
COI . . .

Integrity

one of the reasons, which leads to discussion. A story is inserted about 
someone who did not tell the truth for one of those reasons and how to 
get past it. Another part of why people do not tell the truth is something 
called catastrophic chaining.
Employees start with a small event that is going to occur and blow it 
out of proportion by anticipating negative events. The negative events may 
or may not occur, but the anticipation precludes them telling the truth. 
For example, store manager Joe is going to have a visit by his supervisor. 
He has not completed some of the paperwork that was required by his 
supervisor. Joe is now under extreme stress for the visit because he knows 
his supervisor will want to see it. Joe believes that his supervisor will be 
very angry about his failure to finish a task. Joe also thinks that this will 
result in his termination. If Joe is terminated, he will most likely lose his 
house, and his family will be out on the street. Joe cannot substantiate any 
of his suspicions about what is to come, but in his mind the visit will end 
everything. Joe makes a decision that he will go to the doctor so he can get 
a sick notice to not come into work for the visit.
Joe’s behavior is probably pretty consistent with what employees want 
to do if they perceive trouble is on the way. If Joe had a good relationship 
with his supervisor, he could have just told him that he did not get it done 
and would have it finished as soon as possible. This would have stopped 
all the chaos going on in Joe’s head and would have allowed him to wel­
come the visit. The scenario for tell the truth is as follows:
Give an example of a situation concerning yourself or your store 
where a negative experience turned out better than anticipated.
What did you do?
Why?
What could you have done differently?
After participants complete the scenario, they are allowed to discuss 
their answers with the group.
The second principle, tackle the problem, is one with which many 
supervisory people have an issue. Many managers allow problems to fes-
ter until they are completely counterproductive. If they would have just 
dealt with the small stuff in the beginning, the massive tsunami may have 
never hit. The program teaches managers how to tackle the little problems 
step by step.
According to Johnson and Phillips, tackling the problem should occur 
in the following manner:

H ow It All Ties Together
89

•	 Prepare what you are going to discuss.
•	 Present the issue to the employee.
•	 Focus on the present tense (do not go back through everything 
the employee has ever done wrong).
•	 Attack the problem, not the individual.
•	 Listen to and see other’s point of view.
•	 Use the “I” approach instead of “you.”
•	 Give constructive feedback.
•	 Search for solutions that best serve the company.
•	 Follow through and strive for closure.
It cannot be emphasized enough that managers should be trained to 
deal with problems effectively. If problems are nipped quickly there is a 
better than average chance that there will be no aftermath. The scenario 
that ties in with tackle the problem is as follows:
It is the end of the week, and you just completed payroll. You are 
excited because you made a sales plan and met your hours goal. 
Your top-producing employee came in late several times during 
the week. What do you do?
What would you say to the employee?
What is the benefit of addressing this situation?
What is the impact if you do not address it?
You will find that most managers know what the right thing to do 
is and during the training will also tell you that they do the right thing. 
However, as we all know that is not the case for most managers, especially 
when times are tough in the organization. It is imperative to address the 
effects of not dealing with situations such as this. Not only does it show 
that the manager does not follow policy for addressing tardiness, but it 
also negatively impacts other employees who do show up to work on time 
each day.
For employees to feel like they are part of something bigger, they 
need to have their own voice in the organization. Disagree and commit 
allows employees to be heard so they can feel like they are contributing 
to the greater good of the organization. Many managers have a difficult 
time listening but a very easy time talking. As loss prevention profes-
sionals, we all know that listening is key to getting information. The 
more time we allow employees to “free” talk, the more we learn about 
the culture in the store, region, or organization as a whole. This area 
is also where you will see compliance versus commitment. Employees

who are complying with organizational direction are doing it to keep 
their job and really do not believe in what they are doing. Employees 
who are committed do it because they believe it is the right thing to 
do.
The following describes reasons for which employees do not commit 
according to Johnson and Phillips. The participants are to put down a 
suitable resolution on how to avoid each of the reasons from occurring.
	
1.	Perception of dishonorable intent: perception that someone is 
crossing the line.
	
2.	Perception of unfairness: people know life really is not fair, but 
they want it to be. When it is discovered that unfairness has 
occurred, people want no part of it.
	
3.	Perception of a sham: when employees have uncovered that their 
opinion really did not matter and their supervisor was just pre­
tending to care about their voice, commitment is not in the cards.
	
4.	Perception of being powerless: deception techniques used by 
supervisors that are detected by employees leave a feeling of 
indignity and helplessness.
For example, a regional manager is holding a store manager meet­
ing to discuss the fourth-quarter strategy to boost sales in the region. She 
defines all of the items believed to be prohibiting the region from making 
their plan. She calls out a few stores that have done well and makes it a 
point to impress upon the others that it can be done. She asks the opinion 
of what the managers think can be done and says she is willing to try 
anything and is open to new ideas. Many managers chime in and give her 
ways of elevating the sales. A few days later the managers receive a fax 
that outlines the fourth-quarter strategy as a result of their meeting. Not 
one item or idea conveyed by the management team is on the strategy; 
only what the regional manager discussed is on it. The managers do not 
believe she cared about what they had to say and was just going through 
the motions (i.e., perception of a sham). The end result is a lack of commit-
ment to the strategy.
There is a second scenario for disagree and commit:
Think of a time where you did not agree with a decision.
What were the circumstances?
What did you not agree with?
What could have been done differently?

Welcoming the truth builds authentic relationships. There are rea­
sons, though, that people do not want to welcome the truth. The main 
thing that prohibits truth telling is defensive behavior. If the truthful 
information being provided will negatively affect another person, people 
are reluctant to tell. One of the main reasons is they are afraid of the 
other person’s reaction. Just think of the husband and wife who have 
been married for years, when one ventures outside of the marriage. The 
guilt is telling the person who strayed that he or she owes the truth to his 
or her spouse, but the probable reaction that will be enacted as a result of 
the information can be overwhelming. The same is true with employee–
employer relationships. Employees need to feel like they can tell their 
boss that they messed up. No one is perfect, and mistakes will be made. 
Those mistakes either will be disclosed because the supervisor is open 
to welcoming the truth or will be covered up because the conversations 
pose too much of risk.
The scenario that goes with welcoming the truth is for participants to 
identify their strengths and weakness. If they uncover that confrontation 
is an issue for them, the likelihood of telling the truth diminishes. If con­
frontation is not an issue, they are more likely to tell the truth because 
they are not afraid of the outcome. In this section, they also need to under­
stand whether they are open to listening to the truth. Many managers will 
tell their employees that they have an “open door,” but they really do not. 
They need to understand how others perceive their willingness to hear 
and deal with the truth.
Rewarding the messenger is a form of positive reinforcement that 
will not go unnoticed. If employees have finally found the courage to 
come forward with information, they should be applauded for their 
behavior. Because of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, whistle-blowers 
are protected, but it does not have any provisions about rewarding them 
for telling. The rewards falls on the employer. I remember once a field 
manager came to me with information regarding his supervisor. The 
supervisor had put him down on his expenses as a lunch companion 
and inadvertently sent the report to him. After looking at the report, he 
noticed that his name was associated with a lunch transaction he was 
not part of. The supervisor was well-liked, respected, and pretty high 
up on the food chain. The field manager did not sleep for days because 
he was not sure what to do. He knew that he had a duty to act but feared 
the outcome of the situation. He finally came forward with the informa-
tion, and after a lengthy investigation and interview the supervisor was 
terminated. I asked people involved in the investigation who were also 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
92

higher on the food chain to call him up and tell him that he did the right 
thing. As loss prevention people we tend to think a different way from 
most people. We do not need to be rewarded for bringing information to 
light because that is why we are employed. Other people in the organiza­
tion often struggle with coming forward, and when they do it needs to be 
confirmed that they did a good thing.
The scenario that goes with reward the messenger is as follows:
How can you create a culture where people are open with infor­
mation necessary to build a culture of integrity, and how do you 
sustain that behavior?
Is there anything you would change?
You do not have to discuss, but write the names of the associates 
with whom you have not dealt.
The platform of integrity is the written protocol for how you intended 
to behave when it comes to ethics. The first part of this is to write an integ­
rity statement that declares your beliefs. Before you start to manufacture 
the platform, though, you will need to assess the current condition of 
the organization when it comes to integrity. You can formulate questions 
based on the five principles to understand where the conditions are good 
or bad.
Declaring your beliefs is imperative to making the entire program 
work. Once you disclose how you really feel about integrity and follow 
it up with actions associated with what you stated, change will come. 
Employees will realize that this is for real and is here to stay.

External Theft
When analyzing the causes of shrinkage of inventory in the retail world 
there are four main causes to consider: (1) internal theft; (2) external theft; 
(3) operational errors; and (4) vendor theft. This chapter will discuss the 
cause of shoplifting, a type of external theft. External theft includes shop­
lifting, burglaries, robberies, and any other acts employed to deprive the 
owner of merchandise or product that would otherwise appear on the 
shelf for sale. For example, vandalism and the destruction of property in 
the course of a burglary deprive the owner of that product.
Shoplifting accounts for between 35.6% and 42.5% of retail store inven­
tory shrinkage, depending on what survey or study you might be reading. 
However, the problem affects each business with intensity unique to that 
business. For example, a chain of discount department stores may measure 
its shoplifting problem to be 30.9% of the loss of all stores, whereas a chain 
of fashion jewelry stores realizes closer to 46.7% of its losses in shoplifting 
because of the value and price of the product. According to the University 
of Florida 2008 National Retail Security Survey Final Report, the aver­
age sources of inventory shrinkage show shoplifting at 35.6%. No matter 
which way you analyze it, shoplifting is a problem for all retailers.
What does a shoplifter look like? How do you tell if shoplifters have 
visited your stores? How do you recognize that a store has a problem? 
There is no stereotype to identify all shoplifters: they are not a certain 
color, they do not all wear the same outfit, and they do not all have the 
same physical characteristic, like green hands. The answer lies in watch-
ing behaviors and actions. Shoplifters look like you and me. They can 
be homemakers, children, doctors, lawyers, movie stars, politicians, and

even police officers. They can be rich or poor or anything in between. We 
do know that shoplifters usually feel entitled to the items they steal, ratio­
nalize why they should steal, and get an adrenalin lift when they get away 
with it. This is driven by their quick analysis of how hard the theft will be 
and the risk of getting caught.
There are four types of shoplifters: (1) professionals, (2) thrill seekers, 
(3) amateurs, and (4) juveniles. Professional shoplifters are driven by the 
need to steal as a means of income. Addicts fall into this category because 
they must shoplift and sell their stolen goods for drug money. One pro­
fessional I had experience with was a 45-year-old male named Johnny, 
who put high-priced product into his shopping cart and wheeled it up 
to the customer service desk for a refund. Johnny generally presented a 
copy of a receipt from a legitimate purchase. He would ask to speak to a 
manager to lodge a complaint about the store or product and then would 
demand cash in return. Johnny had a very high percentage of success. As 
stores caught on to the large number of refunds Johnny was making in 
a certain region, they started sharing information. District loss preven­
tion managers communicated and mapped out his progress; they could 
see that his store visits conformed to a pattern. Eventually, Johnny was 
caught. When police arrested him, they found maps of Ohio, New York, 
and Pennsylvania on which he had plotted locations for more than one 
discount department store chain. Johnny also had a detailed list of each 
shoplifted item and return he had made, totaling more than $315,000 in 
one year.
Thrill seekers are high school or college kids who steal on a dare from 
their friends or to gain entrance into a fraternity, sorority, or clique. They 
are lonely stay-at-home moms seeking a thrill. They might be doctors or 
lawyers who are bored with their work or relationships and are seeking 
that shot of adrenaline or the attention of a loved one. Thrill seekers gen-
erally are planning to steal when they enter the store. They have stolen 
before without getting caught, and they will do it again for the rush it 
gives them. Thrill seekers usually give themselves away because of ner-
vousness prior to concealing the product: wandering around with no real 
purpose, licking their lips from dry mouth, becoming pale and shaky, and 
being keenly aware of who is looking at them instead of paying attention 
to what is on the shelves.
Amateur shoplifters are the hardest to catch because their decision 
to steal is normally not premeditated. These thieves may not display any 
signs of nervousness or suspicious behavior until they decide to commit 
the act. This type of thief includes anyone who is a nonprofessional and is

not driven by the need to sell stolen goods for profit and who is not driven 
by peer pressure to steal (Figure 5.1).
Juvenile shoplifters are more of a nuisance than a large threat to 
profitability. They are usually going to target candy or a small toy while 
visiting the store. Preteen girls who shoplift usually choose cosmetics or 
FIGURE 5.1  Shoplifting is often not a premeditated act, so shoplifters are among 
the most difficult to detect.

jewelry. Apprehending this type of shoplifter requires the utmost cau­
tion and knowledge of state laws. Juveniles unaccompanied by an adult 
become the store’s responsibility if they are apprehended. The very first 
call should be to their parents. Having associates who are aware of preven­
tion tactics like good customer service are the best line of defense against 
juveniles who attempt to shoplift.
The very best prevention method is to have associates who are alert 
and well trained to recognize the signs that give away a potential shop­
lifter. Customers who refuse assistance, demand to be left alone, or reply 
to friendly greetings with rudeness should raise suspicion. In these cir­
cumstances, associates are well advised to continue to pay attention to 
the customer. Shoplifters want to alienate employees because they do 
not want to be recognized. Some additional theft indicators for juveniles 
include the following:
•	 Not handling merchandise and examining it to determine quality 
or price
•	 Nervousness, paleness, dry mouth
•	 Looking around for associates’ whereabouts to avoid being detected
•	 Holding up merchandise such as clothing to block view of an 
accomplice
•	 Using a cell phone to describe merchandise or receive descrip­
tions of what to steal
•	 Wearing unseasonable clothing, such as a raincoat with big pock­
ets on a hot sunny day
•	 Carrying large shopping bags that are either not from stores in 
the mall or do not have a particular store design on them.
One might think this list of behaviors is developing a profile that fits 
shoplifters.  Shoplifters do exhibit a set of behaviors that is hard to conceal. 
Merchants should be focusing on shoplifters’ behaviors and accompany-
ing bodily responses to the stress or adrenaline instead of on nationality, 
race, gender, or social status, because focusing on the former is much safer 
and more accurate.
Shoplifters are generally attracted to merchandise they cannot afford 
if they are an amateur and merchandise they can easily sell if they are a 
professional. For example, an amateur shoplifter will usually take jewelry, 
fashion sunglasses, fashion jeans and tops, leather coats, music and video 
CDs, and small electronics. This list is by no means inclusive and gives 
an idea only of what areas of the store to watch. Professionals will tar-
get razorblades, over-the-counter painkillers, infant formula, collectables,

diabetic test strips, and expensive appliances. They are in the market for 
items that can be sold at a flea market or pawn shop or on an Internet 
auction site. The best way to know what product is being shoplifted from 
your store is to take periodic physical inventories and analyze the largest 
quantities of product groups that are showing shrinkage. Remember the 
old angler’s adage: “We fish where the fish feed.”
There are two ways to address the shoplifting problem in a retail store: 
(1) prevent the shoplifting from taking place by removing the opportunity 
and increasing the risk of getting caught; and (2) catch shoplifters in the 
act and prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law. Let us first exam­
ine some prevention techniques. The first prevention tactic is likely the 
most important: customer service provided by the associates on the floor. 
Shoplifters do not like to be recognized; they do not want to be warmly 
greeted when they enter a store. Shoplifters shy away from employees and 
look for uninhabited, out-of-the-way areas of the store to conceal product. 
Sometimes they have to move selected merchandise to one of these areas 
to conceal it while an accomplice looks out. The next important prevention 
tactic is training associates on the proper way to approach customers and 
what to say to let suspected shoplifters know they have been detected. For 
example, consider an employee who observes a customer shopping for a 
brown leather wallet and then sees the shopper place the billfold in his 
pocket. The associate could approach the suspected shoplifter and say, 
“May I find a gift box for that brown leather wallet you have selected?” or 
“May I obtain a new brown leather wallet from stock to replace the one 
you selected? That one was on display and may need some cleaning and 
conditioning.” Another approach when a customer enters the store is to 
say, “Hello, thanks for coming in. This display was just filled in with the 
newest product styles so you will have the best choice. I’ll be right here to 
assist you.”
These statements include no accusations. The associates simply used 
a good description of the product to give the shoplifter the message that 
they know what was taken, right down to the color and style. The associ-
ate in this case offers assistance and service to the suspect. Most amateur 
and thrill-seeker shoplifters will either surrender the product or leave 
very quickly without taking additional product. This is not likely to work 
with professional thieves and organized retail crime gangs.
Associates should be trained to work the sales floor in zones if more 
than one shoplifter is observed; in this way, they are spread out and can see 
many angles of the selling floor. In a specialty store setting, it is important 
to not get boxed into a corner by shoplifter accomplices so that the sales 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿

floor cannot be observed. Developing the habit of keeping our backs to the 
wall and heads up so we can look out across the floor demonstrates to cus­
tomers that sales associates are aware of what is going on around them. 
This is very much a valid prevention method (though this tactic is not 
always possible in a department store). Associates should also be trained 
to know when to call for help on the sales floor. For instance, a signal for 
associates in the office to come to the ladies’ clothing department is to 
announce, “Office please pick up line 4 for ladies’ clothing” (when there 
is no line 4) over the intercom. In department stores and specialty stores 
where there is a trained security staff member, associates should know 
how to call for help when shoplifting seems imminent.
Shoplifting prevention can include the use of technology to increase 
the shoplifters’ chance of getting caught and to make it less appealing. 
Electronic article surveillance (EAS) involves tagging merchandise, espe­
cially the highest price or highest theft product. When the tag crosses the 
pathway of sensors, an alarm sounds, alerting sales associates or loss pre­
vention. There are two main types of EAS technology. The first is acusto-
magnetic, which uses a metal-filled tag detected by the sensors. Sensors 
can be located in pedestals adjacent to the doorway, in the floor, or in the 
ceiling. The second type, shown in Figure 5.2, is called radiofrequency 
(RF) and is activated by a small diode attached to an antenna detected by 
the sensors. Various companies offer this technology; the best known are 
Sensormatic, a subsidiary of Tyco Inc., and Checkpoint Security Systems.
It is very important to remember that these systems are only as good 
as the people who work in stores. I have been in stores where EAS systems 
were installed, and the associates abdicated the protection and control of 
the merchandise to the system. They forgot about their responsibility to 
control the product and to respond to the EAS system once it was activated, 
which eventually made the stores easy targets for shoplifting. When the 
EAS system alarms, an associate must approach customers and ask them 
what they think activated the system. Never accuse a customer because 
the system sounded. It is best to say something like, “Excuse me, ma’am, 
we may have left an inventory control tag on your purchase. Please come 
back into the store with me, and I will correct the problem.” By always 
treating the customer courteously and moving away from the main public 
area it will be easier to avoid embarrassing the customer. Keep in mind 
that this person you are interviewing is not a shoplifter, and more likely 
than not there will be a legitimate reason the system alarm sounded. 
Pacemakers and cell phones have been known to falsely activate EAS sys-
tems. What is most important about the system is the deterrent value. It

is acceptable if the system alarms; you want customers to know it works. 
One deterrent is to make a big show of testing the system by setting it off 
when a known shoplifter or group enters a store.
More than ever before, retailers are using camera systems that record 
shoplifting activity. The benefit of a camera system and recording device 
is that suspected shoplifters are recorded in the act, and that evidence 
can be removed from the recording device by burning it to a CD-ROM 
and handed to the police officer who responds to the store when called. 
Today, analog cameras and video cassette recorders (VCRs) are being 
replaced by internet protocol (IP) cameras, digital video recorders 
(DVRs), and network video recorders (NVRs). The biggest differences in 
the IP cameras and DVRs are the increased clarity of the pictures and 
the increased efficiency of using high-speed Internet lines to connect 
the equipment to the corporate office so a store can be viewed remotely. 
FIGURE 5.2  Antitheft radiofrequency tag.

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿

DVRs can store any amount of data relative to their memory size, most 
commonly 160 to 250 gigabyte hard drives that can store from 30 to 90 
days of recorded video if the cameras are set up to record only motion. 
DVRs and NVRs record on the hard drive and do not rely on cassettes 
that must be changed like in VCRs. The DVR or NVR should be equipped 
with a CD burner and USB ports so that quick copies can be pulled from 
the operating software.
The number of cameras placed in a store will vary based on the square 
footage of the sales floor and how many departments need to be covered. 
The number will also be limited by the amount of money allocated to 
be spent on such a project. To justify placing a camera system in a store 
and to obtain financing, you have to show a return on investment. This is 
generally done by comparing the cost of the equipment and installation 
expenses with what can be saved by having such a system. Can shrinkage 
be reduced? What can be saved in avoiding lawsuits from a slip-and-fall 
incident in the store? Savings can be realized by allowing operations field 
managers to have access to remote video where they can view a store’s 
readiness for business, signing program, and marketing campaign. They 
can discuss missed sales opportunities with management, can follow up 
on mystery shop scores, and can count people to determine conversion 
rates. The field management will give the best testimonials toward build­
ing your business plan to use camera systems. All of these will contribute 
to return on investment.
Camera and recording systems should be overt and visible on the store 
sales floor. The former should be concealed in smoke or mirrored domes. 
The monitor that shows the video can be placed in an office out of custom­
ers’ sight or out in “public view.” Some retailers use these systems very 
effectively by allowing customers to see themselves on the public view 
monitor as they walk into the store, which gives the message that they 
are being recorded. If set up in this manner, the camera system can be an 
external deterrent to shoplifting. If the system is less conspicuous, then it 
will be more useful to provide evidence than as a deterrent to shoplifting.
Additional deterrent physical security items include the use of signs 
posted in the store stating that shoplifting is not tolerated and that the 
product is protected. Here are some ideas for sign messages:
•	 Shoplifters will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
•	 This store’s merchandise is electronically protected.
•	 Please help keep prices low; shoplifting makes merchandise 
cost more.

Many businesses will have guidelines on the content of these signs. The 
marketing department will also provide input for the signs’ design and 
color scheme as well as their placement.
Mirrors in the store provide another shoplifting deterrent, as they 
alert shoppers that they are being viewed. Sometimes convex mirrors are 
placed up high in corners because they give the best view of the ends of 
aisles and corners of the store where shoplifting concealments are likely 
to happen. Some retailers have office areas near the front of the store adja­
cent to the cash registers, some of which have glass that appears to be a 
mirror from the outside to customers but is a window from which people 
inside the office can view the sales floor. Tile-sized mirrors can also be 
placed on the ceiling on the sales floor over high-theft product and where 
shoplifters like to conceal product.
Product deprivation tags are excellent theft deterrents because they 
are designed to ruin the product when a shoplifter removes them after 
it is stolen. One example is an ink tag affixed by a pin through clothing 
and secured with strong magnetic bearings that grip the pin. If the tag is 
tampered with, it releases a bright red or yellow dye that ruins the cloth­
ing and colors exposed areas of the perpetrator’s hands. Other styles of 
tags are made of plastic and steel clamps that close down snugly on mer­
chandise, such as on a pair of sunglasses where the tag grips the temple. 
Trying to remove the tag with a screwdriver, saw, pliers, or other tools 
could gouge the frame and ruin the sunglasses. Both styles of tags are 
removed with specially formed magnets that release the magnetic bear­
ings from gripping the pin or metal clips.
There are several vendors that research creating theft deterrent solu­
tions for retailers. Protex International (http://www.protex-intl.com) sells 
security coils and tie-downs for securing leather coats and cameras and 
similar expensive merchandise controls. Se-Kure Controls, Inc. (http://
www.se-kure.com) provides a catalog of everything from mirrored and 
smoke domes simulating a camera system installation to alarm wraps for 
expensive electronic devices and software protection. Both are reputable 
vendors willing to meet with security practitioners to find a solution that 
is right for the business.
For all the energy and deterrent devices we employ to prevent shop-
lifting, these will not always work and the customer may become a sus-
pected shoplifter. State laws are written to allow an agent of a retailer 
to approach suspected shoplifters to recover their merchandise. Before 
embarking on a shoplifter apprehension program of your own, it is a good 
idea to consult with your legal department to determine state laws where

your stores are in operation. This is important because apprehending 
shoplifters is a high-risk and high-liability endeavor, and the first time an 
attorney calls or writes a letter objecting to how a client was treated dur­
ing a detainment at a retail stores, the legal department will become our 
best representative. It always works more seamlessly when the in-house 
corporate attorneys are able to review the shoplifter apprehension policy 
before it goes into effect.
Speaking of policies, never implement an apprehension program 
without first writing a policy that every store detective will be required to 
follow. If store management will be empowered to apprehend shoplifters, 
then the policy must be published in the store policies and procedures. 
Whether those policies and procedures are in a book or online, they must 
be accessible to those charged with the responsibility of apprehending 
shoplifters. Policies should be detailed, clear, and concise. The apprehen­
sion policy manual will be reviewed during court cases in more than one 
instance by both the prosecution and defense. For this reason it is impera­
tive that the people apprehending shoplifters in your business should be 
trained using the current policy.
Apprehending shoplifters is an art. It must be practiced and perfected. 
My experience is that store detectives or floorwalkers who are good at 
catching thieves have a knack for reading people’s behavior. They can tell 
by how customers are handling the merchandise, how they are looking 
around, and how they are walking that they are persons to observe. Theft 
indicators were previously discussed; store detectives should remember 
that shoplifters’ hands, not their faces, do the concealing. Once suspects 
have found the merchandise they desire to steal, their actions are what the 
store detective must observe. Many shoplifting investigations have gone 
awry because store detectives either did not see the theft or stopped observ-
ing long enough to lose sight of the shoplifter and they ditched the product. 
Once the suspected shoplifter ditches or gets rid of the product, they have 
eliminated the evidence of the crime. If a retailer apprehends a suspect and 
does not recover merchandise they will most likely be sued.
Associates generally must fulfill five criteria before apprehending 
a shoplifter:
	
1.	The store detective must see the subject select the store’s merchan-
dise off the shelf and be able to describe it.
	
2.	The store detective must observe the subject conceal the merchan-
dise and know where it is concealed.

E xternal Theft
103

3.	The store detective must maintain visual contact with the sus­
pected shoplifter as the suspect moves through the store.
	
4.	The store detective must follow the suspect past all points of pur­
chase to be sure it is not paid for.
	
5.	The store detective must apprehend the suspect just as he or she 
exits the outermost door of the store.
Retail companies sometimes make minor adjustments to these 
guidelines such as allowing an apprehension just before the suspect 
exits but past all points of purchase, for example in high-crime areas 
where it is dangerous for associates to leave the store completely. In 
addition, a camera system is sometimes used to observe thefts, and 
eye contact must be maintained by the camera operator while using a 
radio to communicate with detectives on the sales floor to apprehend 
suspects. In any event, eyewitnesses must see the store’s merchandise 
selected off the shelf and must be sure it was not brought in by sus­
pects. These observers must know where the product is concealed to 
be correct in asking for it back upon apprehension. There must be a 
consistent observation to ensure that the product is not dropped before 
it is recovered. Passing all points of purchase helps to show intent to 
steal because shoplifters who have been caught will likely say they 
were going to pay for the goods. There is a good reason to follow each 
of the five rules; together they help develop a strong case and help limit 
liability.
When store detectives have followed the rules and it is time to 
approach the suspected shoplifters, they should be accompanied by 
store management or another loss prevention associate as a witness. The 
approach should be calm and low key, and store detectives should ver­
bally identify themselves as an associate of the company. They should 
then ask for the shoplifted merchandise back by being as descriptive and 
concise about how many items, color, style, and brand name. They might 
also explain where on the suspects the merchandise is concealed so that it 
is completely understood that they have been caught stealing. An example 
of a greeting might be, “Hello sir, I am Karl, an associate of XYZ Company, 
and I work in the loss prevention department. I would like to recover from 
your possession a blue Polo dress shirt and one pair of white Nike sneak-
ers. The items are in the orange shopping bag in your left hand.” Once the 
store detective recovers at least one article of the merchandise, which is 
now the evidence, the detective should move the situation out of the pub-
lic eye by escorting the shoplifter into the loss prevention office. At that 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿

time the rest of the product can be recovered, and a larceny report can be 
filled out.
Depending on the retail business’s guidelines for prosecution, the 
authorities should be notified, and the shoplifter will be released to the 
police upon arrival. When juveniles are apprehended, the parents should 
be called right away to retrieve their child. Store detectives assume 
responsibility for juveniles while they are in the loss prevention office. 
Witnesses must be present during the detention, and no interviewing 
should take place until their parents arrive. In the event that a parent can­
not be reached or suspects will not cooperate so they can be identified, 
the next phone call must be to the police. Never release a juvenile without 
adult supervision.
Keep in mind that to win a shoplifting case store detectives must 
prove intent to steal. This is in the mind of the shoplifter—they intended 
to deprive you of your merchandise and take it with them. However, it 
is impossible for store detectives to know what suspected shoplifters are 
thinking. To prove this you observe their actions and detain them beyond 
all possible points of payment. In a department store with cash registers 
along the front of the store, that may not be until suspects leave the store 
entirely. In a department store with registers in each department, that 
might be once they leave the department where the product is on display. 
Young juveniles and older senior citizens may not understand the dif­
ference between right and wrong. This makes it much harder to prove 
they intended to steal. Involving the authorities in those cases should fall 
under the advice of the legal department of your business.
Shoplifters should be detained in an office near the sales floor of the 
retail store. The room should have a desk and some chairs and a door for 
privacy. Detentions must be reasonable, businesslike, and professional. 
To be reasonable a detention should be between 20 minutes and 1 hour; 
anything beyond an hour without good reason will generally be viewed 
by courts as unreasonable. A businesslike detention means that the inter-
view and recovery of all merchandise is to be done in a calm yet confident 
voice. No yelling, table pounding, or other shows of emotion are advisable 
in this circumstance. Being professional means that the level of conversa-
tion be kept positive and focused on the investigation. No bribes or bar-
gains should be sought or discussed. Remember that everything the store 
detective or floorwalker does will be open to scrutiny in a court of law. 
Recover the merchandise, have all required reports signed, including an 
admission of the theft, and release shoplifters to the authorities or on their 
own recognizance.

All recovered merchandise is considered evidence for court. In some 
jurisdictions an officer will take the evidence to the police station until 
court. If that happens, have the police officer sign a receipt and photograph 
the merchandise. In most cases the store will be responsible for keeping 
the chain of custody of the product until court. To maintain this, the mer­
chandise should be place in a sealed plastic bag with a tag on it with the 
date, time, name of shoplifter, name of store detective, and description 
of the contents of the bag on it. The tag with this information could be a 
simple 3 x 5 index card. It should then be locked up in the store’s evidence 
locker until the trial. After trial disposition, the merchandise can then be 
returned to the selling floor.
One way to increase shoplifter apprehensions is to offer an associ­
ate shoplifter reward program, in which the store pays a small monetary 
reward or gift card reward to associates who report suspected shoplifting 
to store detectives and management. Store associates will occasionally see 
a suspect take product and conceal it but are authorized not to apprehend 
the person but only to report it. One risk in this reward program is that 
store detectives must trust associates and do not observe a theft firsthand. 
If the program is communicated well and there are written guidelines for 
a reward program, it can work well. This will heighten awareness among 
associates and encourage them to do the right thing if they suspect a theft. 
When trying to increase the number of apprehensions you should avoid 
setting goals or quotas for store detectives that they must meet to stay 
employed. This will usually come out in court if a suspected and pros­
ecuted shoplifter pleads not guilty and goes to trial. By the same token, 
never encourage your associates to meet a goal for rewards that they must 
earn. That program must be strictly voluntary.
Store detectives, floorwalkers, and even managers make mistakes; 
they are only human. Many retailers refer to this as a “bad stop,” which 
infers the error of the business. I prefer to call apprehension activities 
where things go wrong an “attempted apprehension.” When store detec-
tives or floorwalkers come face to face with a suspect without merchan-
dise, they should break off all contact and discussion with the individual 
and return to the store office. Before walking away, the store detective 
should thank the customer for their time. If it becomes necessary, store 
detectives only apologize for the customer’s inconvenience; nothing less 
and nothing more is recommended. State law generally gives merchants 
the right to stop and talk to the shopper and conduct an investigation 
of missing product. In those cases an inconvenience has taken place. 
When an attempted apprehension occurs, it becomes necessary to have 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿

all employees involved document their recollection in a written statement 
and to create a file for safekeeping.
Shoplifting incidents occasionally turn into robberies when perpetra­
tors threaten bodily harm to store associates or to a store detective while 
being caught. This usually involves shoplifters pulling a gun or knife and 
telling the associates of the store to back off. In some cases, associates have 
been pushed out of the way or to the ground so the robber and accom­
plices can grab as much merchandise as they can carry and run out the 
door. Some state laws consider this an act of aggression enough to move 
the crime from a shoplifting incident to a robbery. In all instances of a 
shoplifter brandishing a weapon, it is advised that the store associate or 
store detective comply with robbers’ demands and focus on cooperation 
to get them to leave the store. The police department should be called 
as soon as it is safely possible. Some stores may have panic buttons as 
part of their alarm system that can be used to summon police. To deter 
cash robberies, a drop safe, in which cash is dropped into the safe without 
using combination or key to open the door, can be an effective deterrent 
to robbery.
Teaching your associates some basic rules if approached by a threat­
ening individual will help to maintain their safety and avoid a hostage 
situation from complicating an already stressful situation:
•	 Remain calm.
•	 Comply with the demands of the robber.
•	 Make good mental notes about what is observed.
•	 Never try to follow the robber from the store location, including 
not running out to get a license plate (make note of what you can 
see from inside).
•	 Call police immediately upon the robber exiting the store location.
•	 Start to write everything down that can be recalled about what 
was said, what weapon was actually observed, if any, and the 
physical description and actions of the robber.
When police arrive, do not run out of the store to give them the 
scoop. Upon receiving an alarm for a robbery, the police will approach 
the store with extreme caution and will assume that all people are 
potential robbers. They will likely have shotguns trained on the store 
exit doors until they can observe or communicate that it is safe to enter. 
They will begin the investigation once they are sure there is not a rob-
bery still in progress.

Burglaries are another external theft factor for retailers. A burglary 
occurs when the store is empty and involves forced entry and removal of 
the store’s assets. Most retail companies spend money on physical alarm 
systems that should act as a deterrent. Do not let any vendor try to con­
vince you that an alarm system will prevent burglaries; I have learned 
from experience that an alarm system sign on the door will not stop them 
from happening. I have experienced burglaries where the telephone line 
was cut to the mall or plaza, rendering the alarm useless. The majority 
of burglaries I have investigated involve a hit-and-run method. The bur­
glar throws a piece of parking lot curbing through the glass door and 
climbs through the hole while not setting off the door contact. If the store 
is equipped with glass break sensors, they will pick up the intrusion and 
send an alarm. Once the burglar is in the store, he or she will grab as much 
product as possible within the time the burglar feels safe that no police 
response will occur. Most burglars will visit the establishment and will 
know exactly what they are going to take and where it is located before the 
burglary. They will be watching for how often the police patrol the park­
ing lot and will have timed police response in the store’s jurisdiction.
Other alarm components will help to verify the break-in such as motion 
detectors and electronic beams. A strobe light and loud siren would be an 
additional psychological factor to help rush burglars out of the store, but 
all of these components do little to stop a burglary in progress or aid in 
catching burglars. A camera system will record the burglary and docu­
ment the description of the perpetrators if they are not wearing a hood 
or mask. Some alarm systems have video systems built in as part of the 
integrated system, and this is a plus. In Dallas, Texas, a city ordinance has 
been passed that requires video verification of a burglary before the police 
respond. This is a growing trend to help free up the police from respond-
ing to false alarms. The best solution to this problem is video verification, 
whereby the alarm company can see the burglar when the alarm activates 
and can send an electronic photo file right to the police officer’s car.
Burglary prevention and detection are not possible with basic 
alarm or video surveillance techniques. A few products in development 
will one day stop a burglary in progress. Smoke Cloak manufactures 
a smoke-emitting device that will fill a 1,200 foot room with harmless, 
thick smoke in 20 seconds. This prevents burglars from seeing well 
enough to make their way through the store to grab the product. If they 
become disoriented, they will be trapped and subsequently caught by 
police. This system has been successfully installed in Europe and South 
America in jewelry stores, convenience stores, and drugstores. Smoke

Cannon and Bandit Solutions are similar systems. Once these compa­
nies can satisfy fire marshals, landlords, and alarm companies that their 
device is safe and Underwriters Laboratories compliant, they will have 
better luck with getting installations approved. I have been in a room 
in which the vendor set the Smoke Cannon off with three trays of sun-
glasses. A mixture of sugar glycol with water and heat emit the smoke 
into the room. It did not leave a residue on the sunglasses. The smoke is 
harmless to breathe. The room will clear in roughly 40 minutes. I believe 
this will be a reliable burglary defense in the future along with louder 
sirens and brighter strobe lights.

Organized Retail Crime
It is Tuesday morning at 10:05 a.m., and Hillames Department Store has just opened. 
George has just walked into the ladies’ sportswear department to check out who is work­
ing and where they are. He is interested in ladies’ designer jeans and finer leather coats and 
jackets. He is very concerned about price and quality. George also pays close attention to 
whether products have any electronic article security tags or product deprivation tags. He 
does not see any associates, so he leaves the department after making some mental notes 
about where the quality goods are located. George exits the store and goes to a white 
Chrysler van at the far end of the parking lot. When he enters the van, he tells the other 
four occupants what he observed.
Ten minutes later, George and his friends Mary, Jane, Max, and Jim head back to the 
department store. They leave Don, their driver, in the van. In the store the five friends 
go back to the ladies’ sportswear department and encounter the sales associate, who is 
hanging blouses on a display rack near the designer jeans. Mary approaches the woman and 
asks her where the ladies’ cocktail dresses are. The associate and Mary head off across the 
department to the other side of the store. George looks around for other signs of associ­
ates, while Jane and Max pull all the designer jeans they can fit into their arms off the rack 
and stuff them into a foil-lined bag Jim is holding open on the ground near them. George 
does not see anyone and signals to the group that it is all clear. They move over to the 
leather coat rack, and again Jane and Max take all the coats they can grab off the rack—
hangers and all—and bag them.
Just then, George signals that Mary is on her way back with the sales associate. Jane, 
Max, and Jim carry three overstuffed garbage bags out of the department in the opposite 
direction from Mary. Mary and George thank the associate for her help and explain they 
cannot buy a dress because George forgot his wallet. They leave the department in the 
same direction as their accomplices who are almost at the store exit near where Don and 
the van are waiting.
The group hits the doors and walks quickly to the van with the stuffed bags, which 
they load into the back. Don drives the group down the road to the next shopping mall.

Meanwhile, at Hillames Department Store the sales associate approaches the ladies’ 
designer jeans rack to hang some new styles that have just arrived and is shocked to find 
the rack approximately three quarters empty. She runs to call the store’s loss prevention 
team to report a possible theft, still uncertain where the merchandise could have gone. She 
never saw Jane, Max, or Jim take out the large, foil-lined bags and fill them. She was busy 
with a customer and has no idea that her department had been victimized by an organized 
retail crime (ORC) gang. In fact, she had never heard of organized retail theft, because the 
store had never educated its associates about ORC. 
Organized retail crime, which includes multiple organized shoplift­
ing conducted by a group or gang, theft from trailers or distribution cen­
ters, and in some cases counterfeiting, is estimated to be a $30 billion a 
year problem for retailers, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
Task Force’s report on organized retail crime. The most concerning thing 
about this crime is that it occurs repetitively, from shopping center to 
shopping center, city to city, state to state. Because members of local law 
enforcement do not link shoplifting offenses from one shopping center 
or city to the next, they rarely recognize the series of crimes committed 
by one shoplifting gang until the thieves are long gone from the area. 
In addition, ORC has an alarmingly high average cost per incident. The 
crimes are usually in large quantities of product and large amounts of cost 
dollars to the companies they effect. The actors who commit these crimes 
are known as boosters because they boost, or lift, product out of the store. 
Sometimes they also use a shoplifting tool called a “booster box,” which is 
a box (or bag) with handles that looks like it comes from one of the stores 
in the shopping mall or center. The bottom of the bag or box is cut out to 
form a trap door. The booster bag is placed quickly over an item that they 
intend to steal, and as shoplifters place their hand under the bag, holding 
the merchandise in the bag, they lift it up and carry it away.
Law enforcement and retail communities commonly refer to three 
levels of boosters. Level-one boosters usually work alone and boost mer-
chandise from stores in a geographic area in which they are familiar. They 
may be drug addicts or people fueling a gambling addiction. Level-two 
boosters usually work in groups that include a lookout and a driver. They 
may cross state lines to other areas with malls and shopping plazas. They 
can belong to a loosely structured gang or organization. Third-level boost-
ers usually work in well-structured groups with each member having 
specific responsibilities. These gangs travel over large areas, across states. 
They are affiliated with organized theft rings that move large amounts of 
stolen merchandise to the fencing operations.

O rganized Retail Crime

These crimes are considered organized because they are well planned 
out by more than one individual, more than one individual executes them, 
and the stolen product is resold by fences, who resell the stolen goods and 
do so knowingly to make a profit for themselves or for a political group. 
These people are unscrupulous pawnshop owners, swap meet attend­
ees, Internet auction sellers, and gang members who sell to people on the 
street. The FBI has traced some proceeds from organized retail theft to 
funding for terrorist activities. They have also shown that occasionally the 
stolen merchandise is moved out of the country to South America.
Like boosters, law enforcement and retailers assign levels to fences. 
A level-one fence is mostly a small-volume reseller who moves between 
$1,000 and $10,000 worth of stolen product per week. These people are 
likely to oversee level-one, -two, or -three boosters. Level-one fences 
recruit and train boosters and maintain communications with the higher 
levels of fencing operations. Level-two fences move between $10,000 and 
$45,000 in stolen product and purchase stolen goods from level-two and 
-three boosters. They are usually intermediaries in the process of placing 
orders with the ORC operatives for stolen merchandise that either they or a 
higher-level fence wants to sell. Level-two fences are often responsible for 
repacking and reselling bulk stolen products such as baby formula. The 
FBI supports that level-three fences often appear as legitimate wholesalers 
or distribution businesses and move anywhere from $45,000 to $1,000,000 
in product a week. They often mix stolen property with legitimate prod­
ucts. They are the most complex fencing operations and may fund spe­
cial interest criminal activity or launder money for criminal groups. They 
are the ORC leaders who set the pace and orders for thefts that are tak­
ing place to provide them with product. Level-three boosters at this level 
help make ORC so profitable for the thieves who work together to steal 
from retailers because they are paying a percentage of what the product is 
worth to the thief. For example, if a thief were stealing razorblades in bulk 
and the blades are in a 12-pack worth $10 per pack, the thief might shoplift 
20 packs of blades worth $200 on the retail market. The fence will pay the 
thief roughly a third of what the product is worth, so the thief will make 
$70 for the 20 packages of blades he or she gives to the fence. The higher 
the level of fence, the more he or she will pay for the stolen merchandise.
In 2004, Cook County Sheriff police detectives interviewed an admitted 
booster (called Joe here to protect his identity) and thus were able to iden-
tify how a professional thinks and acts within the organization (Safeway-
Walgreens, 2004). (Full credit for making such an interview possible also 
goes to Walgreens and Safeway grocery.) Joe was 29, and his highest level

of education was ninth grade. When asked to give his occupation, he said 
he was a professional shoplifter. He had begun shoplifting eight years prior 
and had been caught three times. The highest sentence he had received 
was 3 months in jail. Joe said he targeted discount department stores and 
pharmacies primarily. He decided this partially because he thought it was 
unlikely that store associates would stop him at these types of stores, and 
he stayed away from stores that had security at the front door. Otherwise, 
he was not afraid of being captured and stole freely.
Joe said he did not want to be in any store too long, and almost never 
had he been chased out of a store. He believed strongly in not running 
out of a store with product because that would attract unnecessary atten­
tion. Joe felt like video surveillance was not a deterrent and was told by 
his mentor that the camera domes are mostly fake and empty. Joe said he 
would not look at a security guard if there was one in front of the store, 
and most of them would not have chased him because they were all over 
50 years old. Uniformed police officers did not deter him because he was 
not going to be there long and was not attracting attention.
Regarding locked cases, Joe said he would try to break into them; 
however, if he was unable to get into them within 50 seconds he moved 
on because he wanted to be out of the store in 4 to 5 minutes. In drug­
stores the mirrors in the back were useful to Joe, so he could see the entire 
store to tell if someone was coming. Store associates did not bother Joe 
because if they asked to help him, he would ask them the location of the 
product he was looking for. This just led him more quickly to the prod­
uct he wanted to steal. When security officers followed him, Joe would 
make them “double take themselves.” Joe said the officers did not have 
a criminal mind like he did and did not think on the same level that he 
did. Joe feels he just has a knack for picking out plainclothes security in a 
store. He had never been apprehended by security officers, only by Good 
Samaritans who saw the theft and reported it or copied down the getaway 
car’s license plate number, leading the police to pull him over. While in 
the store, he also used two-way radios to communicate with his group 
members in the parking lot, who acted as his lookout.
Shoplifting years ago was really easy according to Joe, and now there 
were hundreds of boosters competing with him for the same types of 
merchandise: small, easy-to-conceal items that are easy to steal and in 
demand at flea markets and swap meets. Joe shoplifted every day. A typi-
cal day for him was to visit a few stores. He went to drugstores mostly on 
Saturdays and Sundays; on these days the pharmacy section was closed 
and he specialized in diabetic test strips, which were usually in back

near the pharmacy. He thought small electronics were not worth stealing 
because they were upgraded so frequently.
Joe sold his merchandise to a fence he heard about from other boost­
ers who are mostly drug addicts. Joe said a fence would generally pay 
one third of the retail value of the stolen merchandise. For example, if he 
took $1,500 to $3,500 worth of diabetic test strips to his fence, he would 
get paid between $500 and $700. Joe had used the same fence for 8 years. 
The fence owned a grocery store with another street location not open to 
the public where he stored all the stolen merchandise. Joe had been in this 
second building and had seen product ranging from cosmetics to medica­
tion such as Tylenol and Zantac to stacks of baby formula. The fence was 
likely to pay out $10,000 to $15,000 in cash for $30,000 to $45,000 worth of 
stolen merchandise a day. Joe said a steady stream of boosters visited the 
store to unload stolen goods.
Electronic article surveillance (EAS) systems with tagged merchan­
dise in the department stores did not bother Joe. He said that he usually 
flipped the bag of merchandise up over the pedestals and the alarm would 
not go off. He had a unique way of leading off with one foot to activate 
the automatic door opener and flipping up the bag of tagged merchandise 
over the height of the system so it would not set off the alarm. If it did go 
off, he would run. Joe was particular about the type of installed system 
because the whole-door systems were not as easy to get by.
Joe usually used stores’ luggage or a backpack to conceal the mer­
chandise he would steal. He had tried to quit but started stealing again 
when he became addicted to drugs. Joe surmised that drug addicts com­
prised 98% of shoplifters. Burglaries had declined because people did not 
keep valuables out in their homes anymore and instead had in-home safes 
or used bank safe deposit boxes. When asked to name any retailers with 
security or procedures that were so tight he just would not try anything 
in their stores, Joe answered, “Not really; with we shoplifters, where there 
is a will, there is a way.”
For professional thieves there does not seem to be one extremely effec-
tive deterrent. Joe expressed in his interview that locked cabinets or lock-
ing peg hooks in the health and beauty aids department and electronic 
areas slowed him up the most. However, even when encountering those 
he still attempted gallantly to break in. He viewed store associates as just a 
resource to lead him to the goods. Associates who were trained to engage 
customers and to stick around to determine their needs and to offer genu-
ine service could discourage a thief like Joe. Recall that Joe did not like to 
stay in the store very long, so he might have moved on if the associates

were more friendly and helpful than he expected. Visible security did not 
intimidate this professional.
Real camera systems, though not a deterrent, do provide clear evi­
dence of the concealment and theft of store merchandise, which can then 
be given to the police. In addition, by using camera systems, associates 
would be able to recognize boosters when they return to the store so 
they could react faster and could shadow the boosters until they leave. 
Camera systems are a good backup to floorwalkers to ensure product is 
not dumped before the booster leaves the store. ORC task forces usually 
do not apprehend known theft gang members on the first offense when 
they are operating at a mall. The members of the task force usually follow 
the boosters to the vehicle and watch a number of thefts as the boost­
ers keep returning to the same vehicle to unload the stolen merchandise. 
Police officers are then alerted, and they help with the arrest in the park­
ing lot of the vehicle under surveillance when the group returns to empty 
the merchandise. This is the best way to impress upon law enforcement 
authorities that the crime involves more than one incidence of shoplifting 
and more than one retailer. It usually involves more than one mall and 
city. Local law enforcement agencies are just beginning to understand the 
severity and nature of these thefts.
THE EXPERT’S RESPONSE
To get the most reliable information, I had a conversation with Frank 
Muscato, Organized Retail Crime Investigation Supervisor for Walgreens 
Pharmacies and a recognized expert on ORC detection, apprehension, and 
education. Mr. Muscato had a full career with the Dallas Police Department 
in 1993, when he was working with Wal-Mart on large investigations of 
video cassette thefts that were being stolen by organized gangs. Wal-Mart 
invited Frank to help create their first ORC crime investigation unit.  In 
1995, Frank created the LP Legislative Team to help influence legislative 
efforts in all 50 states where Wal-Mart operates.  In 2004, Frank left Wal-
Mart to assist Walgreens in their newly created ORC Team where the 
pharmacy chain was experiencing increasing external theft issues.  
At Walgreens, Frank is deeply involved in advising store manage-
ment, investigating crimes they report, liaising with local law enforce-
ment, and educating all involved on how to recognize and shut down 
ORC theft operations.

Frank explained that pharmacies and big-box retailers, including 
grocery stores, suffer similar thefts of razor blades, over-the-counter 
(OTC) drugs, health and beauty aids (HBA), fragrances, infant formula, 
and small electronics. Boosters find a lucrative and low-risk enterprise by 
traveling from store to store to steal small amounts from each and then 
selling the stolen property to fences, online, at flea markets, or any way 
they can. When boosters get caught in shopping malls targeting stores 
for clothing, they sometimes switch to pharmacy and grocery chains 
because they are mostly free-standing stores and not in a mall envi­
ronment. ORC booster gangs may go back and forth depending on the 
needs of their fences and the ease of the thefts. Frank says that it is hard 
for law enforcement to realize that ORC boosters are committing large, 
felony crimes because the boosters will know the state law where they 
are operating and steal under the felony limit in each incident, therefore 
appearing to be minor thefts.  For instance, boosters who were recently 
caught were found to be carrying a list of the felony limits in the states 
they were traveling. A booster will go into stores in Georgia (where the 
felony limit is $300) and steal razor blades totaling $250 to remain at the 
misdemeanor level. They will then travel to South Carolina, (where the 
limit is $1000) and steal $800 in merchandise, again to stay within the 
misdemeanor limit in case they get caught. In many states, if a booster 
gets caught with a misdemeanor violation, they may only be issued a 
citation to court and be released. They will then simply travel to the next 
store and continue boosting, 
One of the most important methods in combating this type of thiev­
ery, according to Frank, is to educate law enforcement at all levels. There 
are roughly 975,000 law enforcement personnel in the United States, yet 
perhaps only 4000 of those officers know, understand, are aware, or have 
been trained to recognize the connectedness of ORC gang communica­
tions, offenses, and interstate travel. Retailers have become much better 
at communicating and cooperating to protect themselves and apprehend 
ORC gang members. Frank will receive calls from loss prevention super-
visors at Walgreens or from his peers at other retailers to get involved in 
the investigations when an ORC gang has hit stores in their area. He will 
immediately become engaged and may contact law enforcement in the 
city or try to talk with the ORC booster or gang member who was appre-
hended. He will interview them to learn as much about the operation as 
possible, such as who the other members involved are and possible fence 
locations. Together with law enforcement they will assemble a case and 
attempt to prosecute everyone involved to the fullest extent of the law.

Frank says today’s retailers have a much improved relationship and 
cooperation with law enforcement and it is increasing as retailers con­
tinue to educate and form partnerships with their local authorities. Almost 
every major retail chain has some type of ORC team devoted to the inves­
tigation of, and education about ORC. At some point we must and will get 
the upper hand in dealing with ORC theft groups. 
As mentioned earlier, department, specialty, small-box, and big-box 
stores are favorite targets of ORC gangs. These groups are active in all 
of the contiguous 48 states at one time or another; three of the largest 
are in Southern California, Miami, and New York City.   Transient theft 
rings travel from state to state in groups of three to ten people. There are 
nearly 2000 transient theft rings in existence today; three years ago, the 
number was closer to 1400. Inner city gangs now tend to gravitate toward 
this type of theft because it is more lucrative and less risky than other 
types of crime. Many of these actors have extensive and diverse criminal 
backgrounds.
Besides the transient theft rings, retailers have to focus on habitual 
offenders and financial crimes artists. The ORC investigation teams, sim­
ilar to those described by Frank Muscato, consist of multiple members 
of his team, local law enforcement, and occasionally other retailers’ loss 
prevention ORC team members. One of the key success factors of Frank’s 
approach to ORC is a strong relationship with law enforcement in every 
jurisdiction in which they operate.  If the police have not joined in the 
ORC blitz, as they are called by some of the specialty retailers, the police 
are on notice that investigation or “blitz” teams are working in the area 
and to be ready to respond. 
Once they begin operating at a shopping center, the ORC blitz team is 
strategically positioned looking for professional shoplifting activity. One 
of the most reliable signs is focusing on behaviors. Transient theft gang 
members have a stoic expression and act very intense and businesslike; 
in contrast, the dynamics of customer behavior in the shopping center 
is light-hearted and includes laughter, flirting, and even arguing about 
the best buy. Observing behavior of a transient ring leads to watching 
the theft take place and the handing off the goods to a mule who is then 
followed until they empty the merchandise into a vehicle. Figure 6.1 is an 
example of what a booster van full of stolen merchandise would look like 
to law enforcement agents. 
The ORC blitz team will observe three or four thefts and follow the 
mules back to the vehicle each time. Law enforcement is called to the park-
ing lot and the officers witness the evidence of the thefts. This can take 

O rganized Retail Crime
117

many hours of surveillance so that all members of the theft ring and all 
vehicles involved are identified. The desired outcome is to apprehend the 
whole transient theft ring, recover all the stolen merchandise, and secure 
all the vehicles involved. If an apprehension is attempted too early, the 
likely result will be only one booster with one booster bag of merchandise. 
Figure 6.2 is an example of what booster bags would look like.
The police will usually make the arrests on shopping center property 
since these transient theft ring members may flee police, become violent, 
and employ countersurveillance techniques. Boosters have been known 
to wear layers of clothing so, while escaping, they can change hairstyles 
and alter their appearance quickly, running back into the mall or stores 
where it is very easy to get lost in the crowds. When shopping mall’s 
security departments are involved, it is for the added surveillance of the 
camera systems. This allows for more effective tracking of transient theft 
rings members who are very skilled at countersurveillance techniques. 
The key is learning to educate law enforcement officers and trainees 
on apprehension of ORC theft gangs and provide instruction at state police 
FIGURE 6.1  Example of booster van full of stolen merchandise.

training academies. One of the best ways retailers can contribute, even if 
they do not have the funding for an ORC task force or investigations unit, 
is with intelligence. Many stores have camera systems that record theft 
activity or can report thefts from their stores. There is an ORC specialty 
report compiled every 2 weeks of the top 25 U.S. shopping centers that are 
being victimized by ORC theft gangs. This report is a collaboration of 10 
specialty retailers that contribute the information.
To address the ORC problem, more sophisticated retailers have begun 
to form their own ORC task force, headed by a senior manager or direc­
tor in the loss prevention area. The task force includes one loss preven­
tion analyst and four field regional loss prevention managers who work 
together to identify and investigate organized crimes committed against 
the specialty stores. The task force also works closely with other retailers’ 
ORC teams to exchange information and support their efforts.
Task force leadership trains local police on how to identify counter-
feits of designer products. With the help of a company’s wholesale divi-
sion, the task force has the ability to created product identification cards 
that fit neatly into police officers’ notebooks to help them determine 
FIGURE 6.2  Example of booster bags.

O rganized Retail Crime
119

whether merchandise in the field is counterfeit. These cards might show 
the defining characteristics of a purse or a pair of sunglasses.
For a few retailers these efforts have resulted in hundreds of thou­
sands of dollars of product being confiscated in New York and on the 
West Coast. They have also helped to build cases for the arrests and pros­
ecutions of people selling stolen goods.
Task force founders and leadership may also lead quarterly meetings 
of an ORC round table, which includes approximately 60 attendees from 
retailers, including Stein Mart and Walgreens Pharmacies, to law enforce­
ment representatives, including those from the FBI, the Warren County, 
Ohio, Prosecutor’s Office, and various police departments. Many suc­
cessful apprehensions of ORC gangs in the Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky 
tristate area have resulted from intelligence shared and cooperation gen­
erated during these meetings.
Another aspect of the ORC task force is the use of software to scour 
Internet auction sites for company products being sold in large quantities, 
especially after known burglaries or large ORC gang thefts. This identifica­
tion of e-fences often makes it possible to trace the goods back to the thieves.
An ORC task force may also use technology such as Vigil Active, a 
Web auction monitoring software that automates the review of product 
auctions on such sites as eBay and Craigslist. This Web site monitoring 
software can organize analysis of all Web auctions for a business’s product 
by using key words. By setting up search parameters using trade names 
or brands, it is possible to isolate and review all the auctions for any given 
brand on eBay. For example, searching for all auctions of Swiss Army 
Watches will return a listing of each Swiss Army Watch auction ranked 
from 25 pieces down to 5 pieces. The user sets the parameters for searches. 
The power of this software is the time it saves analysts in tracking down 
trends of large sales. Large-quantity sellers may be fences, recent recipi­
ents of burglarized product, or store employees who are removing the 
product to sell on the Internet. The software may also uncover counter-
feited product being sold on the Web.
Another way retailers are involved in the fight against ORC is the 
National Retail Federation (NRF)-sponsored Joint Taskforce on Organized 
Retail Crime. Composed of roughly 20 of the country’s top retailers from 
all sectors, the force is dedicated to the education of law enforcement, 
shared intelligence between retailers and law enforcement, and investiga-
tion of ORC.
Loss prevention professionals can take some steps to band together 
and impact organized retail crime by educating in these ways:

1.	Educate executive management in your business about ORC and 
gain much needed support to develop a program to combat this 
crime.
	
2.	Help store associates understand what ORC is and how the crimes 
are carried out. Make associates aware of your company’s policies 
on how to react to what they see.
	
3.	Communicate with other retailers about the existence of ORC 
boosters or gangs active in your area. Tip each other off when you 
have been affected.
	
4.	Join and make use of the Law Enforcement Retail Partnership 
Network (LERPnet), a national data repository for major retail inci-
dents and a secure Web portal for retailer and law enforcement.
	
5.	Learn everything you can about ORC. The more loss prevention 
leaders learn about these crimes, the stronger we will be in the 
fight to lessen its impact.
	
6.	Influence your federal, state, and local legislators to pass laws that 
increase the penalties and lower the dollar limits of offenses to 
qualify the crimes for higher penalties. Push for repeat offenses 
and involvement with fences to carry stiff sentencing.

Organized Retail Crime
An Industry Approach
As discussed in the previous chapter, organized retail crime (ORC) is 
a growing problem for most retailers. The National Retail Federation 
(NRF), an advocate agency supporting retail as a business with education 
and lobbying efforts, conducts surveys among its members and its 2009 
Organized Retail Crime Survey revealed the following:
•	 More than nine out of ten retailers (92%) reported that their com­
panies were victims of ORC during the past year, up eight percent 
from 2008.
•	 When asked about how they would rank ORC as a threat to their 
company on a five-point scale, nearly one-third (29%) of retailers 
gave organized retail crime a “four” or “five” rating, identifying 
the problem as severe or significant. (On average, retailers gave 
ORC a rating of 2.87.) 
•	 The average retailer spends around $215,000 per year on labor 
costs to fight ORC.
What efforts has the retail industry made to react more effectively 
to organized retail crime? Professional associations such as American 
Society for Industrial Security (ASIS), National Retail Federation, and the 
Retail Industry Leaders Association have worked together to find solu-
tions to ORC. They work to educate retail businesses, management, and 
loss prevention and asset protection practitioners on how retail theft gangs 
work. The professional associations lobby in state and local legislatures to 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿

garner support for bills that will create and strengthen laws around orga­
nized retail crime and fencing. They also strive to increase and support 
liaison relationships between retail establishments and law enforcement. 
In the fight against ORC we will have no success unless law enforce­
ment at all levels—local, state, and federal, including the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation (FBI) and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
(ICE)—work together. Raising awareness and having strong legislation 
are essential to impacting ORC.
The FBI estimates that retailers lose $34 billion annually to organized 
retail crime. I received this information from FBI Supervisory Special 
Agent Jerome Barker, the Cincinnati Division Criminal Enterprise Program 
Coordinator, in July 2006. He did a joint presentation to Cincinnati and 
tristate retailers and law enforcement as part of a joint effort by Walgreens 
Pharmacies, Stein Mart department stores, and other specialty retail com­
panies to help create a partnership. Both sectors seemed very willing to 
participate.
In the previous chapter, we have discussed levels of fences and its 
profitability. ORC ring leaders have made frequent, large contributions to 
secular terrorist charity organizations such as the Holy Land Foundation 
and the Sulaiman Abdul Aziz Rajihi (SAAR) Foundation. These organiza­
tions are believed to funnel cash to terrorist groups such as Hamas and 
Hezbollah.
The retail trade business loses $64,600 every minute to ORC. Many 
retailers, both specialty and mass merchandise, consider themselves most 
unlikely targets. Consider that many specialty retail stores have started 
carrying high-fashion and high-retail brands like Versace, Prada, Burberry, 
and Dolce & Gabbana. Increases in high-fashion brands in stores cor­
relates directly with reported thefts. Camera surveillance in some cases 
provides evidence for groups of four or five working together. Thus, even 
small specialty stores are not immune to ORC. It is rising at an alarming 
rate because thieves find easy access to the product and an abundance of 
specialty and chain stores, combined with low or no fear of punishment. 
This results in high profit and low risk for ORC gangs.
Organized retail crime groups are winning the battle, and law enforce-
ment is not. However, thanks to incident reporting sites such as the Area 
Law Enforcement Retail Team (ALERT) and the Law Enforcement Retail 
Partnership Network (LERPnet), police officers are more organized and 
receive more information than ever before. These Web sites allow both 
retailers and law enforcement officials to communicate on incidents and 
track occurrences.

In years past, shoplifting gangs existed only in larger metropolitan 
areas. Antishoplifting signs, tagging, or even electronic article surveillance 
were the only necessary tools to keep people honest. These tactics will not 
work with organized thieves, as discussed in the previous chapter. Camera 
systems will not deter organized retail thieves, because most do not care 
whether they are recorded. Camera systems with a recording device will 
provide the necessary information and even evidence to law enforcement. 
They will provide photographs of perpetrators to post on Web sites for 
communicating with the authorities or among stores of a chain so they can 
look out for organized theft rings that might visit their stores.
Retailers are now initiating relationships with trade organizations 
such as the Joint Retail Task Force, an NRF entity whose member retail­
ers and law enforcement agencies work together investigating organized 
retail theft, educating businesses, and introducing key legislation through 
lobbyists and members of Congress in favor of tougher laws against major 
thefts. This organization has worked hard to develop training courses for 
law enforcement on what ORC is all about and how it works. They come 
alongside member retailers that want help in identifying ORC and train­
ing on how to reduce it. The organization is trying to influence universities 
and even community colleges to prepare students for loss prevention and 
security management careers. For example, Eastern Michigan University 
now offers a degree in loss prevention management.
Those involved in retail loss prevention can be proactive by educat­
ing employees and communities about organized retail crime, providing 
expert testimony on legislative bills, and being a resource for state and 
federal authorities. For example, Target Corporation’s asset prevention 
department has made a very smart business move and provides an exten­
sive forensics lab for the law enforcement community in Minneapolis, 
Minnesota, in which evidence for some of the most serious crimes is ana­
lyzed. Not only does a program like this give back to the community, but 
it also enriches the relationship between the retailer and federal, state, 
and local authorities. Similarly, a specialty watch and accessory chain 
funds a forensic computer analysis lab for police to gather evidence on all 
types of computer crimes. In building a partnership with a cyber investi-
gations task force by donating equipment and software in the Hamilton 
County area near Cincinnati, this chain will help to foster cooperation in 
investigating fencing operations on Internet auction sites and in fraudu-
lent credit card schemes.
Loss prevention is about being proactive, and supporting analytical 
research is one way to understand the trends affecting loss prevention,

for example, by helping fund research on the National Retail Security 
Survey conducted by Dr. Richard Hollinger and his staff at the University 
of Florida’s Department of Social Studies. Other studies have been carried 
out, but I feel like this annual survey effectively shows the trends and the 
most effective solutions that retailers report. Retailers, as well as myself, 
have contributed to this survey. We report shrinkage trends in dollars lost 
and causes of shrink. We report solutions such as analytical software or 
camera systems that help reduce loss. Over the years, the survey has had 
mixed participation numbers, so it is very important that retail loss pre­
vention and asset protection leaders respond to it.
From an educational perspective, there are roughly 675,000 police 
officers, which includes 250,000 crime prevention officers, in the United 
States. Collectively, retailers employ more than 30 million people. If all 
those employees understood the organized retail theft problem and knew 
what to do if they saw an organized theft gang, the theft problem could 
be strongly addressed. All too often, professional shoplifters report that 
associates in stores will walk right by or even lead them to the product 
they are looking for. But because they are too busy and spread too thin to 
spend much time giving good customer service, engaging the customer, 
and it’s easy to just wait until the sales associates move on to another 
department to assist another customer. Pay and benefits relate directly to 
how much they care about their job. There is a lot to be said for providing 
store associates with excellent pay and benefits and treating them with 
respect and dignity. The culture of a business certainly has an effect on 
whether its associates will care enough to take the time to service custom­
ers rather than just point at a product and walk away. It is up to those in 
loss prevention and asset protection to be the catalyst for treating associ­
ates well and inspiring the culture of integrity.
Organized retail crime has attracted the attention of law enforce-
ment in larger markets where retail theft gangs are active. Supporting law 
enforcement in making sure boosters and fences are sentenced jail time 
is the best way for retailers to help solve this problem. Remember, if great 
customer service is absent, deterrent equipment or signage will have little 
effect on a retail theft gang. Catching and prosecuting them will affect 
their criminal record and possibly will get them off the street with jail 
time—time they will not be stealing from organizations. Two examples of 
companies who are doing an excellent job at engaging law enforcement at 
the federal and local levels are Walgreens Pharmacies and Frank Muscato, 
manager of its organized retail crime task force; and GAP, Inc. and Nelson 
Harrah, who leads its ORC mitigation efforts.

ALERT (http://www.usalert.org) successfully demonstrates a part­
nership between retail and law enforcement to target organized retail 
crime, check fraud, credit card fraud, counterfeiting, and identification 
theft through sharing information related to these crimes. This organiza­
tion was created by the Shelby County, Tennessee, Sheriff’s Office and is 
maintained at minimal cost to law enforcement because it is supported by 
subscribing retailers. Information sharing is conducted in accordance with 
all local, state, and federal laws as well as in compliance with all company 
and agency policies and procedures. Some of the information includes 
habitual offenders, shoplifting, internal theft, fraudulent refunds, coun­
terfeit merchandise, counterfeit currency, check fraud, credit card fraud, 
and identity theft. Roughly 900 members are part of this communication 
reporting network.
An initiative of the federal government in support of law enforcement 
is the 2006 Department of Justice Reauthorization Bill. Section 1105 details 
the provision on organized retail theft, which requires the attorney gen­
eral to establish an organized retail theft task force within the FBI. The 
mission of the task force is to quickly identify hot spots of ORC activity 
across the country and to deploy agents and resources more efficiently to 
apprehend and prosecute these criminals. The panel is directed to work 
closely with the retail community to create a national database or clear­
inghouse operated in the private sector to identify where organized retail 
crimes are being committed. Appropriations for fiscal years 2006 through 
2009 for law enforcement education, training, and support were conserva­
tive in amount. The law authorizes $5 million annually for law enforce­
ment participation and federal agent training to investigate and prosecute 
these crimes.
LERPnet evolved from this mandate and the partnership of the FBI 
with the retail community. NRF and other trade organizations joined 
forces to create and launch this national data repository for major ORC 
incidents. It has been fully operational since April 2007. Retail subscrib-
ers pay a setup fee of approximately $200 per user and $1,200 annually to 
belong to the network. This tool will help provide a nationwide resource 
and will encourage collaboration like never before and will allow law 
enforcement to see patterns and investigate crimes connected to other cit-
ies, counties, and states. Thousands of incidents have been reported by 
close to 50 retail participants coming from all sectors. Reports include 
organized retail theft, burglaries, robberies, counterfeiting, and auction 
site activity fraud.

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿

LERPnet will provide retailers and law enforcement with information, 
data, and analysis tools to prevent, detect, and respond to ORC crimes. 
It will enable members of the retail loss prevention community to work 
together toward common goals. It has developed a confidential forum and 
secure technology platform for the exchange of information and data. It 
is recommended that you consult with your legal department to examine 
the agreement that is presented for signature upon joining. You will want 
to ensure that your company understands the limitations and potential 
liability with this tool if it is improperly used.
The Cargo Theft Prevention Act of 2005, signed in March 2006 by 
President George W. Bush, is also significant to fighting ORC. This law 
includes in it a prescription for a cargo theft database and increases the 
penalties for cargo theft. An example of this theft involves a trailer of Levi’s 
jeans hijacked from a carrier and moved into storage for a month to “cool 
off.” An FBI sting interrupted the theft scheme before the jeans could be 
reshipped to New York City to be sold in the garment district. Many cargo 
thefts occur at the manufacturer’s warehouse, in cross-dock operations, 
at import–export storage sites, on loading docks, and from trucks mov­
ing between these sites. This law now includes cargo theft as a separate 
reported category in the Uniform Crime Report (UCR). The act increases 
the prison terms to 3 years for anyone convicted of stealing cargo with a 
value of less than $1,000 and to 15 years for thefts greater than $1,000.
The FBI estimates that cargo theft costs businesses between $16 and 
$30 billion domestically and $30 to $50 billion worldwide compared with 
annual losses in vehicle thefts, which are estimated at $6.3 billion a year, 
and jewelry thefts from jewelry firms, estimated at $111 million annually. 
While the cargo theft problem is spread over shipping firms, warehouse 
firms, and wholesalers, retailers are not immune to its effects. Every retailer 
relies on the shipping industry, whether related to imports coming over­
seas or by truck from wholesaler to their stores. If the hijacked retail mer-
chandise is in transit from a retailer’s distribution center to its stores at the 
time of the loss, it will be shrinkage for the stores scheduled to receive the 
product. The product would be in the inventory of the stores upon deliv-
ery. Even if the theft is discovered and adjustments are made to the store 
inventories, the overall loss will be felt by the company’s bottom line.
At an organized retail crime round table held in Mason, Ohio, in 2006, 
representatives of the FBI’s Organized Retail Crime Task Force explained 
some of the challenges they face in identifying ORC. What makes it diffi-
cult to determine the extent of the problem includes the manufacturer and 
retailer shrinkage tolerances that allow some crimes to go unreported.

They look at it as a cost of doing business. An example of this is within 
an Italian company where they manufacture most of what we sell. It is 
the Italian philosophy that product be open and available to the customer 
to try on and touch. This same service orientation facilitates higher theft 
rates, and some of that does go unreported. Other drivers of nonreport­
ing are costs of insurance, costs of prosecution, and embarrassment. Since 
before this act was passed the Uniform Crime Report did not have a sepa­
rate category for cargo theft, it may have been hidden as robbery, burglary, 
or motor vehicle theft.
One theory is that shoplifting data are grossly underreported. 
Supporters of this line of thought argue that some retailers apprehend 
shoplifters but do not prosecute. In the course of protecting stores, in situ­
ations in which organized theft gang members are apprehended and the 
merchandise is recovered, the gang members are released. The security 
agent may not recognize the perpetrators as ORC members or profession­
als. With no police involvement there is less of a chance that their thefts 
will be reported appropriately as organized retail theft.
Many law enforcement agencies do not report shoplifting for the 
annual UCR. If the crime is not regarded by the reporting agency as worth 
reporting, we are missing valuable information toward identifying the 
seriousness of the crime. Studies suggest that only 1 in 50 shoplifting inci­
dents leads to the offender’s apprehension or prosecution. You can see 
with these concerns at the federal level that retail loss prevention depart­
ments have some serious reckoning over what to do about the problems. 
This demonstrates why it is so important for retailers to work together and 
communicate about their group effort to cooperate with the authorities.
Retailers should also consider the following concerns:
•	 The difficulty of prosecution for some retailers and in some juris­
dictions. Is the cost of prosecution worth it? Should a retailer tie 
up the local courts for shoplifting incidents of $100 or less?
•	 The trade-off for a small penalty just is not worth it, for example, 
out-of-state investigators who have to return on travel expenses to 
testify at each hearing.
•	 Many retailers do not have resources directed at investigation of 
ORC, and it goes undetected.
•	 Organized retail thefts are not understood by every retailer in 
the industry or go undiscovered. The NRF 2009 Organized Retail 
Crime Survey stated that “nine out of ten retailers (92%), report 
their companies were victims of organized retail crime during 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿

the past year, up 8% from 2008” (Rodriguez, 2009). In this same 
study the respondents said they believed that 49% of executive 
management did not understand the complexity of the problem.
•	 Some thefts are attributed to internal theft incorrectly. Not having 
observed retail theft gang activity in their establishments, large 
portions of missing merchandise may be attributed to internal 
theft, especially if recent internal investigation activity occurred 
at the establishment.
Law enforcement has its own challenges, including those being pros­
ecuted failing to show up in court. Some professional shoplifters may 
not have proper citizenship papers or may be fleeing from agents of the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service, which would weigh heavily in 
their decision to show up for court. Some law enforcement agencies equate 
thefts to petty shoplifting as opposed to criminal enterprise. Occasionally, 
federal resources must shift toward working terrorism cases.
Trends in legislation include increasing state felony levels to make orga­
nized retail crime less lucrative. In addition, members of Congress have 
recently addressed the problem on a federal level with three very recent 
pieces of legislation. On July 15, 2008, Representatives Brad Ellsworth of 
Indiana and James Jordan of Ohio introduced H.R. 6491 to amend Title 18, 
United States Code, to deter and punish individuals and enterprises that 
engage both nationally and internationally in organized crime involving 
theft and interstate fencing of stolen merchandise from retailers. In the 
Senate on August 1, 2008, the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act of 
2008 was introduced by Senate Majority Whip Richard Durbin of Illinois. 
This bill would toughen the criminal code regarding organized retail 
crime by better describing offenses and capturing conduct of individuals 
engaged in organized retail crime. It would require the U.S. Sentencing 
Commission to consider relevant sentencing guidelines enhancements and 
physical retail marketplaces such as flea markets and online auction sites 
to review the accounts of sellers for suspicious activity and report it to the 
Department of Justice. It would also demand that high-volume sellers on 
the Internet display a physical address, post office box, or private mailbox 
registered with a commercial mail receiving agency. A third piece of leg-
islation, the E-Fencing Enforcement Act of 2008, was introduced in early 
August 2008 in the House of Representatives by Bobby Scott of Virginia. 
The act is designed to protect online consumers from purchasing stolen 
and potentially dangerous merchandise. As of the time of this writing, 
H.R. 6491 was referred to committee and has not been acted on further. 

O rganized Retail Crime

Senate Bill 3434 also made it to committee and stalled there.  In September 
of 2008, there was a hearing by the Judiciary Committee Sub-Committee 
on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security and no further action was 
taken.  Through 2009 and 2010, no further action has been taken on any of 
the three bills.  Legislation still remains a big opportunity.
There are many other opportunities to make tougher laws for ORC 
criminals. We encourage retailers across North America to join the fight 
against this most serious crime. Research your state’s progress in passing 
laws that make organized retail crime more severe, curb fencing at all 
levels, and help keep prices low for retail customers.
Many states have passed successful legislation to fight ORC. Texas 
passed a law making it illegal to use bogus universal product codes (UPC) 
labels and counterfeit receipts in the commission of a crime against a 
retailer. States also have addressed repeat theft offenses by making the 
third theft conviction a mandatory felony; however, Texas increased the 
felony theft level to $1,500.
Over the past 10 years, almost all state legislatures have raised the 
dollar value that warrants a felony offense; exceptions include Florida, 
Illinois, Indiana, and Vermont. Some of the recent increases in felony 
amounts include Alabama (from $250 to $500), Wisconsin (from $1,000 to 
$2,500), and Wyoming (from $500 to $1,000). Inflation is one reason for 
this; as prices for product increases, legislatures are increasing felony lev­
els to keep serious crimes properly defined by prosecutors and state stat­
utes. Penitentiaries are full, and the most serious crimes receive judicial 
consideration for incarcerating another inmate. By raising the felony level 
the legislatures are reducing the crime severity. Only Maine has reduced 
the dollar amount of felonies to $1,000.
The NRF is working on several areas of legislation with lobbyists to 
help retailers combat ORC. It should be a crime to try to defeat electronic 
article surveillance equipment by using foil-lined bags and in 31 states 
(with two additional states pending passage of legislation), merely pos-
sessing these bags is considered being in possession of criminal tools. 
Use of bogus receipts or UPC labels to return stolen product or to cause 
product to be scanned at a lower price is a crime in 25 states (again, with 
two additional states pending passage of legislation).  Property-fencing 
legislation was passed in 27 states (with three additional states pending 
passage) to control swap meet and flea market sellers of certain types of 
bulk merchandise, such as razorblade cartridges or infant formula, and 
requires receipts for proof of where such sellers acquired the product. 
Only two states have laws concerning theft by Internet jurisdiction, and

two states have laws pending. The Internet is one of the easiest ways to 
fence product using auction sites, and fences feel safe from detection due 
to the amount of protection they enjoy from the owners of the auction 
sites.  This is an area where state and federal legislators can make impact 
and retailers can show their support.
Legislation passed in ten states (with one state pending) targets ORC 
boosters by making shoplifting a felony if boosters steal from three or more 
retailers within a certain period of time, regardless of dollar amount. Laws 
addressing theft using emergency exits as a getaway have been passed in 
six states and are pending in two others.  Credit card skimming, where 
organized criminals steal not the credit card but the information on the 
magnetic strip to use on bogus cards, is a growing problem and victims 
do not know they are victims until they receive their next bill. Legislation 
has been passed in 28 states to address this type of crime. 
State laws are more frequently being passed to mandate felony status 
when two or more people have been caught shoplifting. When a prop­
erty fence is involved, it is characterized as an organized theft. Laws 
like this have been enacted in Washington and Alabama. In thefts with 
intent to resell the product, some states have enhanced penalties for felony 
level. The law creates a prima facie case for intent when multiple items 
of the same product are stolen. For instance, 20 packages of razorblades 
and multiple boxes of diabetic test strips have been found on flea market 
tables. One admitted booster said those were among the easiest items to 
conceal and walk out of a drug store or discount store with. Another state 
law that has passed in Ohio, Kentucky, Alabama, and Missouri condones 
reverse stings, which allow undercover police officers to represent prop­
erty as being stolen to a fence. Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, and 
Michigan currently prohibit these stings.
The year 2009 proved to be a step in the right direction for retailers 
and law enforcement to combat organized retail crime. Many states are 
deciding that their current laws are not stringent enough and therefore 
are passing legislation to increase penalties for those involved in ORC-
related activity. These newly crafted laws allow the following:
•	 Prosecutors to have additional tools to prosecute
•	 Law enforcement to file charges more specific to the type of crime 
being committed
•	 Retail crime to be made a less desirable venue for criminals
•	 Awareness for this growing epidemic

What follows is a brief recap of some of the states that took a stand 
against ORC in 2009 by either creating entirely new legislation or amend­
ing portions of their existing statutes to better accommodate ORC:
•	 Arizona-SB 1059: Arizona amended Sections 13-1501 and 13-1805 
of their existing statute. Title 13, Chapter 18, Arizona Revised 
Statutes was amended to included Section 13-1819 to read 
Organized Retail Theft, Classification, which defines the act of 
ORC. ORC also became a class 4 felony.
•	 Kentucky-HB 369: Kentucky amended its organized crime law 
to address organized retail theft. It heightened the penalties for 
those who engage in ORC to be charged with a class C felony if 
the persons are acting as part of a criminal syndicate.
•	 Ohio-SB 320: Ohio revised their existing Racketeer Influenced 
and Corrupt Organizations statute, better known as the state 
RICO statute, to add ORC as a predicate offense. This particular 
piece of legislation was remarkably clever because it allowed for 
the aggregation of offenses that did not necessarily meet indi­
vidual incident felony dollar levels but did occur within a cer­
tain time frame.
When state RICO statutes are revised to include ORC and when those 
engaging in ORC-related activity are prosecuted, the state or presiding 
jurisdiction is allowed to reap all the benefits afforded by the original 
statute. Therefore, criminal forfeiture, civil action, and civil penalties are 
some of the benefits for prosecuting under the new statutes. With the states 
marching forward on their quest to minimize ORC, we did not want to 
fall short federally. The reintroduction of three very important bills was 
also completed in 2009:
•	 Federal pending legislation for 2009 includes H.R. 1166: The 
E-Fencing Enforcement Act of 2009 deals with e-fencing or resell-
ing stolen goods on the Internet.
•	 H.R. 1173: The Organized Retail Crime Act of 2009 is a comprehen-
sive solution to ORC and the resale of stolen or illegally obtained 
merchandise through Internet auction sites, flea markets, pawn 
shops, swap meets, and illegitimate storefronts.
•	 S. 470: The Combating Organized Retail Crime Act of 2009 
enhances sentencing guidelines, requires market places to file 
documentation with the attorney general for suspicious activity, 
and revokes seller accounts for selling illegally obtained goods.

These pieces of legislation were crafted and introduced because of 
partnerships among retailers, law enforcement, prosecutors, and retail 
associations.
Title 18, Section 1030 of the U.S. Code is a law addressing persons 
accessing networks and government databases without permission. It is 
tied to ORC in the protection of consumer data, which is present on all 
credit card magnetic strips. It also protects databases such as the National 
Retail Federation, Department of Justice, consumers’ unions, and finan­
cial services by making it a crime to look for personal identity informa­
tion on their databases. The bill is in the House Judiciary Subcommittee 
on crime, terrorism, and homeland security. This bill creates enhanced 
penalties for crimes committed via a computer. It establishes violations as 
a RICO predicate. ORC and E-fencing are on the radar screen of judiciary 
members and staff.
In mid 2006 a specialty retail chain created an organized retail crime 
task force, led by a former police detective (whom we will call Spike Kessel) 
specializing in cyber crimes. One of the first things he did was organize 
a group of retailers, namely, Stein Mart, Walgreens Pharmacies, and one 
bank in an effort to meet with the FBI, local law enforcement, county pros­
ecutor’s office, and the Secret Service. The meeting was attended by more 
than 150 participants from these offices. Communication and education 
are the most effective tools a retailer can use to affect organized retail 
crime. Today, Kessel’s team has impacted more than 23 individuals for 
prosecution or indictments for over $250,000 in product. That is a great 
start, but there is more to do.
In June 2008, Millie Kresevich testified before the Ohio State House 
of Representatives legislative hearing in anticipation of Ohio lawmakers 
sponsoring a bill regarding ORC penalty enhancements and protections 
for consumers. She explained a three-step process (see Figure 7.1):
•	 Step 1: Preparation of the testimony involving the following steps:
•	 Attend a hearing first to see what it is all about and to understand 
the order of the proceedings and how testimony is introduced.
•	 Develop a partnership with law enforcement; you need good 
law enforcement representation with you at the table. Know 
law enforcement’s exact position on the issues. If willing, ask 
law enforcement to provide letters of support to be presented 
during the proponent testimony.
•	 Read the state’s current legislation first—what are the main 
reasons you need new legislation or an amendment to the

existing law? If amending, does the added verbiage regard­
ing the proposed legislation coincide with the existing ver­
biage for the current law? Does the proposed legislation 
enhance the existing law or create new elements that must 
be proven, making it more specific but also more difficult to 
prosecute? Change wording to ensure an easy endorsement 
of your views.
•	 Know how to address the audience. There are specific ways to 
address the members of the House, Senate, and chair.
•	 Know your copresenters and who else will be at the table. 
Understand how their testimony will flow. Obtain a copy of 
the written testimony from copresenters prior to testifying 
and review. If providing statistical information, ensure that 
everyone providing testimony is giving the same numbers.
•	 Are you being duplicative of others’ testimony, or are you 
each taking an issue? Discuss topic distribution, but be ready 
to speak on all areas. Do not allow the testimony to be geared 
toward one specific type of business. Allow the approach to 
be a global perspective of unified retailers.
•	 Prepare answers to the questions likely to be asked. Know 
your issues’ pitfalls.
•	 Partner with your retail association because they are the 
experts.
•	 Know your opposition. If possible, attempt to retrieve writ­
ten documentation regarding the opposition’s point of view. 
Conduct research geared toward refuting the opposition’s 
stance on the topic. This is where the biggest obstacle will be; 
therefore, careful preparation and accurate information are a 
must. Know the entities and their arguments.
•	 Step 2: The presentation:
•	 Written testimony is usually required prior to the verbal por-
tion of the hearing. Search the Internet for existing testimony 
to see how the document should flow. If speaking on behalf of 
your organization (by using the letterhead on the written tes-
timony), run it by your legal department prior to submission. 
Allow enough time for changes to be made if necessary.
•	 Use examples, but also speak globally for all retailers. Be care-
ful about overdoing the war stories. One specific example is 
sufficient enough to get the point across.

•	 Speak slowly and clearly, but with passion and conviction—
you need to engage your audience and get them to care as 
much as you do about the issues. Avoid terms specific to loss 
prevention that others may not understand.
•	 Step 3: Understanding the prosecutorial perspective (if criminal 
law proposal) and ask yourself questions such as:
•	 What do your state prosecutors think of the proposed 
legislation?
•	 Did you get their buy-in first?
•	 Will they use it if made into law?
•	 Are there objections?
•	 If there are objections, is it the entire community or just one 
individual? Attempt to find someone within the prosecution 
community that you may be able to get on board.
•	 Be prepared to answer their objections with relevant 
information.
•	 If successful, ask this individual to (a) write a letter indicating 
support and (b) testify as a proponent for the legislation.
•	 Speak with a filing prosecutor or one in the training division.
•	 Provide evidence from other states that have successfully 
prosecuted under similar legislation you are trying to pass.
This chapter has dealt with the responses of business, law enforce-
ment, and legislative initiatives to dealing with ORC. While there are 
many approaches to dealing with this crime, there are almost as many 
obstacles to be worked out by both retail businesses and law enforcement 
agencies. Retail loss prevention practitioners should also be activists in 
educating, collaborating, and even pushing for legislation. This approach 
has not been the norm in loss prevention departments and must not be left 
for three or four retail trade associations to take on alone. We must all be 
involved and engaged in this fight.

Operational Causes of 
Loss and Awareness
OPERATIONAL ERRORS DEFINED
When I was a loss prevention manager trainee at a regional mass merchan­
dise discounter named Hills Department Stores, training on the causes of 
operational inefficiencies was an important part of understanding shrink­
age reduction. As a review of what constitutes shrinkage in a retail store 
environment, we must first look at how to determine a shrinkage figure. 
Shrinkage is defined as the difference between the physical inventory of 
the store and what is on the books at the time that inventory is taken. If 
there is less merchandise on the physical inventory than the book account­
ing of the store, then it is indeed shrinkage. However, if there is more mer­
chandise than the book accounts for, then an overage has occurred. Most 
companies set goals at having zero shrinkage and zero overage.
While the term overage may sound less damaging than shrinkage, large 
overages are just as problematic. If one retail store is over in inventory, 
more than likely another is short the same amount, or the distribution 
center is feeling the shrink because of paperwork errors in a transfer. 
Another adverse effect of overages involves the bounce-back effect. That 
is, the very next physical inventory count will result in shrinkage of the 
same amount as the inventory evens up. An example of this would be an 
improper count of merchandise at 600 units instead of 300 units in one 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿

physical inventory, making it appear that more of the product was on the 
shelf when in fact it was not. From an accounting standpoint, headquar­
ters adjusts the books from 300 to 600. On the very next inventory count 
this same store tallies 300 units again when the books say 300. This will 
result in a bounce-back shrinkage. Now, these numbers are illustrative, 
but in real life that 300 on hand would fluctuate by received goods, sales, 
returned goods, and transfers. The point is that the model stock count 
would be influenced by that incorrect inventory causing the overage.
Operational inefficiencies can contribute to both shrinkage and over­
age. Two of the other three causes of discrepancies in the inventory—
external theft and internal theft—will cause shrinkage almost exclusively. 
Vendor issues have a potential to cause overage but usually result in 
shrinkage. Vendor issues usually involve outright theft from the store 
during a visit or billing for more merchandise than is actually received in 
the store, resulting in shrinkage.
THE IMPORTANCE OF IN-STORE 
OPERATIONAL AUDITING
Operational inefficiencies or errors can happen in the receiving of mer­
chandise, price changes, improper tagging, inventory adjustments, and 
damages. Operational errors are the easiest cause of shrinkage to remedy. 
They are entirely controllable with a strong program of associate aware­
ness and auditing. Training at store level and by field managers who visit 
the stores will round out the program to ensure that errors are avoided; to 
the extent that they do occur, they will be caught early with a good audit 
program before they amount to much. This type of auditing for opera­
tional errors should be done at store level in a retail environment where 
stores are large enough to support a loss prevention manager at store 
level. If the store does not have a loss prevention staff, store managers can 
take on some of the responsibility. This type of auditing is not the same 
as operational and loss prevention audits completed, as discussed in the 
next chapter. In-store auditing is an excellent strategy to help high shrink-
age stores to reduce and correct operational errors at the store before they 
contribute to shrinkage.
The internal auditor is generally charged with detecting deficiencies 
and reporting them. In loss prevention, the auditing function is respon-
sible for detecting deficiencies and correcting them. The ultimate goal of 

Op erational Causes of Loss and Awareness
139

this type of auditing is to ensure the profitability of the business. Creating 
awareness by training associates in the store when errors are discovered 
and corrected will help associates understand the right policies and pro­
cedures. It will make them aware that someone is checking their work. 
Communications are improved within the store when these errors are 
reported to management. It is important to consider quality of the audits 
as much as quantities performed; however, a consistency of repeated 
and expected audits must exist. Consider the dam effect when conduct­
ing audits: concentrate efforts in problem areas. Plug the hole in the dam 
where the largest amounts of profit dollars are flowing out of the lake so 
you are not drowning in shrinkage while plugging an insignificant hole.
Here are some theories to consider when analyzing shrinkage results 
and in-store audit results that will help determine what action to take 
for improvement of the overall program addressing operational errors. If 
you have high shrinkage and high operational error detection, it may be 
a sign of poor or improper training taking place in that store: loss preven­
tion awareness is down, and error correction is not occurring. If you have 
high shrinkage and low operational error detection, look for no aware­
ness, unreported errors when found by associates, and a lack of follow-up 
on basic programs in the store. Low shrinkage and high operational error 
detection indicate that there is loss prevention awareness to report errors 
and no individual follow-up by management. Training is adequate, but 
management is not getting to the root of problems. Low shrinkage and 
low recovery of operational errors are the goal. When a store is running 
at optimum, there are a lot of awareness, frequent and efficient training of 
associates, peer pressure to do the right thing, and following of policies, 
procedures, and programs of the company.
CORRECTING THE PROBLEMS
Receiving errors are made when merchandise is improperly accepted or 
missing altogether from the store. A two-tier approach should be imple-
mented in these cases. First, incoming shipments to the store should 
be tracked on a Shipment Receiving Log (Figure 8.1), where the receiv-
ing manager logs the date and distribution number, number of cases of 
product, and whether the shipment is split or complete. A split shipment 
means that two of four boxes arrived on Tuesday and the other two boxes 
are expected later in the week. If the store point-of-sale (POS) system gives 
information as to product in transit, the store may be able to reconcile right

then that the correct number of boxes was received. If not, the shipment 
receiving log will be used to reconcile shipments against a “Closed Loop” 
report that is received monthly and reports shipments for the month.
When receiving associates accept the boxes of product from the deliv­
ery person, they should always check that the boxes are addressed to the 
correct store location. I cannot tell you how often I have heard that one 
store location in a shopping mall got product from another location, and 
the product is most often not reported, so it is not added to inventory. It 
is also very important that receiving associates check the integrity of the 
shipping carton for damaged sides or corners where tiny holes in the box 
could be used to remove small pieces of merchandise. The carton should 
be sealed with original tape and not resealed, as any resealing could point 
to a theft problem while in transit. Associates should be trained that any 
discrepancies in the condition of the box or number of cartons received 
should be reported to the inventory control department at headquarters.
Few companies conduct detail counts of every item in the received 
cartons because of the strain that it places on productivity of management 
and sales associates in a retail establishment. If a trailer full of product to 
a department store arrives, the product is placed in stock on the sales floor 
or back-stocked within 24 hours of receipt. Practical experience shows 
that if product shipments are audited before leaving the distribution or 
manufacturing center by the responsible loss prevention staff and audit 
proficiencies exceed 90%, there will be little adverse effect on inventory 
results. Where shrinkage occurs is in the carelessness when store man­
agement does not log shipments or does not recognize a weekly shipment 
was missed and went unreported. Figure 8.2 is an example of using scan­
ning a bar code to check-in a shipment box.
Mass merchandise department stores and specialty retailers that have 
embraced radiofrequency information devices (RFIDs) may benefit from 
having sensors at the receiving dock door that automatically scan the car-
tons of product that pass through the door and instantaneously account 
for all product received. The RFID system would then communicate with 
the POS system and update the stock status for the store’s inventory. This 
system would eliminate the need for manual shipment logs and individ-
ual inspection of cartons. There are variations of RFID that involve label-
ing case packs with intelligent tags rather than each individual piece of 
merchandise. Case pack labeling would still be a more accurate way to 
control shipment receiving than the manual log because of the elimina-
tion of human error.

Detailed receiving of product—if that is the preferred process—
involves opening every carton and using shipping documents enclosed 
by the shipping distribution center of all product by stock-keeping unit 
(SKU), description, and retail price. Errors in quantity or product style 
can be documented on the shipping documents or in an audit log by the 
auditing associate. In either case the documentation should immediately 
be used to request adjustments for the shipment.
Price changes are a fact of life for just about every retailer in business, 
as merchandise becomes aged or shopworn. Price changes involve the 
adjustment to the new retail in the POS system and book inventory for the 
retail store. Most total retail solution accounting systems, such as Oracle 
and SAP, allow both systems to be adjusted simultaneously from the head-
quarters on a SKU-by-SKU basis. If price changes are taken on store-level 
documents, those documents should be compared with the quantity, SKU, 
description, and retail of the actual merchandise quantity, SKU, and retail 
to ensure that everything matches. Audit personnel should follow behind 
store department associates to audit their work. Price-change audits should 
be documented in a paper or electronic log. Data entry of the actual price 
change should be audited, as errors can amount to thousands of dollars 
if entered into the computer incorrectly. Consider a price decrease of 100 
FIGURE 8.2  Example of scanning a bar code to check-in a shipment box.

pairs of sunglasses from a retail of $250 to $210, a retail difference of $40. 
If when the data is entered one zero of the quantity is left off, the resul­
tant error would be a shortage of $3,600. Thus, 10 pairs of sunglasses are 
adjusted at inventory to a retail of $40 less, and 90 pairs are not adjusted 
the $40 and are expected to sell at the previous retail of $250. As each of the 
90 pairs sells, the store would lose $40. By doing price-change audits, loss 
prevention can help ensure the integrity of the prices of the merchandise. 
When errors are found and corrected before the sales take place, opera­
tional errors are eliminated from causing the store inventory shrinkage.
Product recalls occur when the merchandise becomes outdated or 
headquarters decides that it should be pulled back and redistributed to 
outlets or stores in other parts of the country. Another cause of product 
recalls involves safety issues with the public interest at heart. The process 
for a recall differs in these scenarios, but the need for auditing and verifi­
cations remains important in each. In a doctor of optometry’s office there 
are contact lenses and soaking solutions for sale. Because these products 
fall within the oversight of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and 
are use medicinally, they have expiration dates. When the product expires 
it must be pulled from the display shelf and active use. The product is 
stored away until a recall from the corporate office is issued, and the 
expired product is then sent to a warehouse for destruction and disposal.
Now assume that the doctor’s office has done its part and has pulled 
expired product and has locked it away until a recall was issued authoriz­
ing the product to be sent in. Also assume that the corporate office recog­
nized its responsibility to recall all expired product quarterly and issued 
product recall documents to the office. Office associates will pull the prod­
uct and either match it by item number or SKU to the recall sheet and enter 
a quantity. If the product is not well controlled by the inventory system, 
recall forms might have to be printed manually and the SKU and quantity 
of each unit written in manually. The associates would then box up the 
expired merchandise and place a copy of the completed recall documents 
with store number, product list, and management’s signature on the docu-
ment into the box. This will act as a packing list, even if the warehouse or 
corporate office gets an electronic copy of the recall for inventory-keeping 
purposes. The associates are responsible for placing an accurate address 
of the warehouse on the box and taping it securely closed. The shipment is 
now moved to the shipping area to be sent out on common carrier.
The audit process for product recalls should include examining the 
prepared shipment for signs of tampering, such as cut tape where access 
was gained to the box. The address on the outside of the box must be to 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿

the company facility where the recall is to be sent for processing. Compare 
address destinations with those of associates in the store. The recall should 
be opened by the auditor and the recall authorization checked to make 
sure it is filled in correctly and completely with quantities that are to be 
recalled. The audit involves verification of the number of each style and 
individual included in the box. Errors in quantity claimed on the recall 
authorization will result in a loss to the store if there are fewer units in the 
box than are represented on the recall authorization.
Some department stores miss a recall altogether. The store does not 
pull the product indicated on the recall, so it is sent to the distribution 
point. When the next physical inventory is taken, that product missed on 
the recall may show up as shrink because the product is removed from 
the store’s inventory model stock once the recall is closed. The product 
neither gets removed from physical inventory through the recall nor is 
recognized as valid inventory for that store.
In 2008 an economic recession affected many industries including 
banking, real estate, fuel, auto, and retail. At least three retail department 
store chains—Sears, K-Mart, and Walmart—considered resurrecting their 
layaway departments to entice customers to shop with them and be able to 
pay off their selections without incurring the high interest rates of credit 
cards. Layaway departments usually hold merchandise for the customer 
with a deposit down and their agreement to pay off the merchandise on 
layaway by the date due to pick it up. Some retailers charge a nominal fee 
to use this service. My recommendation based on real-life experiences is 
to avoid having a layaway department altogether. I have been involved in 
acquisitions of companies that offered layaway services and were holding 
million dollar outstanding balances where the merchandise was miss­
ing, supposedly picked up by the customers when final balances were not 
paid. You can be assured that if the remaining balance is not paid in full 
once the merchandise is picked up, the retailer is much less likely to col-
lect that balance as time goes by.
Company operations will ultimately make the decision to support 
layaway, even at a risk of loss, because it keeps the loyal customers return-
ing. Causes of operational errors resulting in a loss of merchandise and 
consequently shrinkage for the company involve associates not collecting 
the final balance and improperly storing away unrecorded merchandise 
and recording the wrong price. Additional considerations of internal theft 
may contribute to unreconciled journal entries with no merchandise in 
stock. The same auditing program can be used both to determine opera-
tional errors and to detect dishonesty.

The auditor should plan to conduct cross-referencing audits on a 
percentage of the actual product in storage. Start with customer records 
in the layaway department that show the date the layaway is due to be 
picked up and the balance due. There should also be a breakdown of all 
the merchandise in the package for the customer. Randomly pull lay­
away customer records and look for the merchandise to be in storage. 
Pull the merchandise boxes, unseal them, and audit item for item what 
is in the box against what was recorded on the layaway transaction. Be 
sure to record the last name of the customer, layaway account number, 
and balance due in either a manual audit log or on a computer. The next 
audit would involve pulling layaway merchandise boxes and tracing 
them back to the customer record. Looking for appropriate balances on 
the record and comparing what was rung up with what is in the box are 
the main audit functions in this exercise. Errors in ringing up the prod­
uct will show up as long as it is checked in detail. A third check would 
involve looking for customer records that have not had payment activity 
for weeks or have never had a payment. A search for those boxes may 
turn up dishonest associates.
Allowing associates to hold merchandise for customers to purchase 
at a later hour or even later date is very risky and should be avoided if 
possible. If it cannot be avoided, a POS list of hold product should be 
maintained and checked frequently against the date the hold is due to 
be picked up and paid for. Hold merchandise is more likely to lend itself 
to internal theft rather than operational inefficiencies. The most effective 
control for hold merchandise—if it is unavoidable to have holds—is to 
limit the time frame that merchandise is kept off the selling floor and in 
hold storage. Merchandise held off the sales floor cannot be purchased 
by customers. Retailers lose thousands of dollars by associates retrieving 
the merchandise on hold and giving it to the customer while forgetting 
to ring it into the POS system and to collect payment from the customer. 
A last concern for holding merchandise is that it becomes a staging area 
for dishonesty. Store associates can set up merchandise they want as 
though they will pick it up on pay day and leave it until it is forgotten. 
Dishonest associates will watch it to see if management notices the late-
ness of the due date and, when fairly sure no one is paying attention, they 
will remove it from the store without paying for it. This is easiest when 
taken as they are leaving for the evening or by passing it off to a friend 
who visits during the day.

THE VALUE OF STORE INSPECTIONS
In the 1980s a retailer repeated the phrase, “What goes uninspected dete­
riorates.” I find that to be true even today in our high-technology business 
environments. Those inspections just might look a little different when we 
use Internet protocol (IP) cameras connected to a network video recorder 
(NVR) sending video back to our office desktop of any store we want to 
pull up. If we are not fortunate to have camera systems in each store, then 
inspecting the old-fashioned way, by walking around and visiting each of 
the departments of the store, will do. The value of inspections is fourfold: 
(1) developing associates; (2) improving morale; (3) improving communi­
cations; and (4) improving performance. Associates are motivated because 
they are being taught standards as you inspect a log book, examine their 
display work, or explain how to sell a product properly. Consistency devel­
ops throughout the store. Morale improves when associates have direct 
contact with the leadership. Relationships strengthen when employees see 
managers who will not ask them to do something that they would not do 
themselves. Managers can follow up on delegated tasks only when they 
get out onto the sales floor to check on a project. Things now get done that 
did not before. Communication improves as people understand what is 
expected of them. Decision making is easier when managers see firsthand 
what is going on in the departments. Training improves. Overall perfor­
mance improves because managers have to spend less time putting out 
fires. Discipline improves with inspections when policy violations have 
occurred or operational errors have been committed. Proper documenta-
tion allows for better performance evaluations.
VALUE AWARENESS FOR EMPLOYEES
Included in this discussion are the retail store cash registers, referred to 
as the POS system, although some customers of a store will attempt to 
remove product by deceiving the cashier, which by its nature fits in with 
external theft. However, this type of deception can be avoided entirely by 
training cashiers on complete value awareness, which is nothing more 
complex than helping your cashiers realize the value of the product they 
are recording in the register for the customer. Cashiers are retailers’ last 
defense to ensure the full value of the product is paid to them. Value 
awareness training can be conducted in group meetings with cashiers over 
three or four 15-minute meetings before the store opens each morning or

as one large presentation at a storewide meeting. While it is unproductive 
hours paid to cashiering staff, it is well worth the return on investment if 
the store saves a few thousand dollars a week in corrected sales.
Consider this example of value awareness at work to understand 
what the benefits are. Mary is a cashier in a department store, and she is 
approached by a man and woman in their thirties with two children and 
a cart full of store merchandise to be checked out. They look innocent 
enough—your typical family buying some basic home goods and toys. 
The first item Mary scans is a hamper for $24.95, followed by a package 
of hangers for $7.88, a thermos for $4.99, and two handheld games from 
toys for the kids at $3.95 each. The total comes to $45.72 plus tax, right? 
Well, not quite, because while the family of four leaves the store with pur­
chases, so does another $1,200 that was not rung into the POS system or 
paid for. Mary never opened the hamper box to look inside, even though it 
was obviously taped over like it had been previously opened. She missed 
eight pairs of ladies’ jeans worth $207.92, two leather jackets worth $300, 
five sweatshirts worth $200, and two ladies’ dresses worth $350. Because 
she never lifted the hamper box from the cart, Mary could not tell that it 
was loaded with additional product. Mary also just scanned the thermos 
without opening it to look inside. If she had, she would have found $142.08 
worth of ladies’ costume jewelry and scarves. By weight this additional 
product would have been very hard to detect by lifting it. Mary had to be 
taught to make the necessary verifications. This family of four might very 
well be innocent and are in for a big surprise when they get home and 
discover the additional product in these two containers. This hamper box 
and thermos could very well have been loaded up by professional thieves 
and left on the shelf for the mule to come in and remove. Our unsuspect­
ing family came along meanwhile and picked up the planted boxes not 
realizing the hamper they wanted was left on the shelf, almost as if it were 
the display item. If the family were actually involved in a theft, without 
our cashier being well trained at value awareness, the store would suffer 
the loss unless a store detective witnessed the family filling the box and 
thermos with the extra merchandise.
In loss prevention our philosophy encourages the use of prevention 
techniques to save profit dollars and not to rely on the chance the store 
detective staff will catch the potential loss. All associates of a retail busi-
ness must be prevention minded to safeguard the profitability of that 
business. To that end, it is necessary to cover all the bases when teaching 
value awareness to cash register staff, including having a basic knowl-
edge of how much things retail for, what items can be concealed in what

items, and the importance of opening and searching merchandise con­
tainers. Cashiers should know that a ladies’ leather coat is going to be 
in the price range of $99.00 to $325.00 and not $19.95. They should know 
that a microwave oven is more likely $85.00 to $239.00 and not $12.99. 
Customers will change price tags on product of value if the store’s tags 
are not self-destructing when removed from the product to which they 
are affixed. Even the type of ticket used is a prevention tactic. Many retail 
chains have now upgraded to scanning the universal product code (UPC) 
on merchandise and do not rely on price tickets. They concentrate on 
ensuring that the shelf signage is accurate to reflect what the bar code 
will scan. Discount retailers are more likely to have adhesive tickets on 
the product, and those tickets must be scored so they do not peel off in 
one piece. The adhesive should be tested to make sure it is strong. The 
same goes for clothing tags, which should be affixed with a plastic “swift 
attacher” threaded right into the clothing and through the ticket hole. 
Again, that tag should show signs of being removed if someone tries to 
remove it.
Here is an outline of what we used at Hills Department Stores, a dis­
count department store chain, to teach value awareness risks to all asso­
ciates. All associates were trained because they were all cross-trained to 
work in the register areas at peak business hours and rush hours:
Prevention of Losses at the Point of Sale
• Management trainer explains the types of losses to be prevented at the point of sale.
• Review and explain codes A thru E of the value awareness program.
• Tour the store sales floor with groups of not more than 10 associates following the 
outline of department and items listed in the value awareness program.
• Review the procedures to be used in dealing with problems found at the point of 
sale as outlined in the value awareness program.
• Ask for and answer any questions for the benefit of the group.
• The value awareness program is designed to help you, the cashier, in detecting and 
preventing losses. Theft by deception (switching tickets) and concealing merchan-
dise are two methods of dishonesty that are increasing at an alarming rate. Our best 
protection against losses at the registers is well-trained and alert cashiers.
• To help you become aware of how to prevent losses at the registers, we are going 
to tour the store and discuss the following types of potential losses.
• Note: The following examples A through E, referred to as codes will identify situa-
tions to be explained to you as we tour the store by department and item.
Code A: Higher-priced items where the ticket has been switched with a lower-
priced ticket.

Op erational Causes of Loss and Awareness

Example: $79.97 chainsaw switched to $9.97
 
$254.97 snow blower switched to $24.97
Code B: Merchandise used to conceal other merchandise inside.
 
Example: Duffle bags may have four pair of socks in them
 
Lunch pails and thermos bottles for concealed jewelry and merchandise
Code C: Cartons used to conceal merchandise inside.
 
Example: Aquarium box emptied and filled with clothing
 
Toy storage chest filled with toys
 
Hamper boxes to look for concealed clothing and other product
Code D: Trading expensive merchandise with less expensive merchandise by switching 
the containers.
 
Example: Trading a $69.99 bottle of cologne with a $9.99 bottle of cologne by 
switching boxes.
 
Placing a $39.97 full leather football into a $19.99 rubber football box.
Code E: Switching sizes or items in merchandise sold as sets.
 
Example: Fishing rod and reel combinations by placing an expensive reel with an 
inexpensive rod.
• After review of the codes, management leads the tour pointing out potential risks in 
each department, identifying the code that pertains, and letting associates know the 
real value of the items. At the end of the tour the manager answers any questions 
that come up. The manager would explain that if cashiers observe a problem they 
should contact the appropriate departmental personnel for review. Once the prob­
lem is verified and correct value established, we would offer to sell the merchandise 
to the customer at the correct price or in the correct container.
• Never accuse customers of switching tickets or concealing merchandise because 
they may have found an item on the shelf in that condition and not realize it has 
been altered. Our primary goal is to be aware of and spot the problems to prevent 
losses at the point of sale. When associates caught any of the previously given codes 
and got them corrected, they were given a small cash award in their next paycheck. 
This is an excellent way to get the awareness of your cashiering staff to be at its 
best. The small cash award for preventing losses at the registers is a small price 
to pay for big dollars saved from rolling out the front door. While this method of 
operational training was used in the 1980s and ‘90s, the idea is still very valid. Today 
a virtual tour of the store can be communicated on large screens on a high-speed, 
computerized training system to get the same effect.
Operations and loss prevention training are the responsibility of 
the loss prevention practitioner because we have the best understand-
ing of how these areas work together. In the retail environment almost 
all operational functions have risks associated with them that need to 
be considered. For example, if I am training an office worker to count 
daily receipts, I would show how to keep the coin and cash separated, 
how to use the bill-counting machine properly, and how to fill out deposit

slips. I would also explain that if the counting room or office was not 
locked and had traffic moving through it, the risk of losing cash would be 
very real. I would also state the importance of keeping the receipts in full 
view and locking deposits in the safe to avoid the risk of theft. Another 
example is training the opening manager to unlock the store, turn off the 
alarm system, and turn on some lights. Take that a step further, though, 
to searching maintenance workers before they leave after working all 
night for any hidden merchandise in their lunch box, and keep the store 
front locked so unwanted visitors do not remove product before the store 
opens for business. Loss prevention policies can be combined with just 
about every operational function, so it is worthwhile for loss prevention 
practitioners to take loss prevention training seriously and to use it to 
their advantage.

Developing an Effective Operational 
and Loss Prevention Audit Program
An operational and loss prevention audit program will measure profi­
ciency for each segment of the business audited, will uncover high-risk 
transactions that might develop into fraud investigations, and will expose 
weaknesses that can be remedied through employee training. A vice pres­
ident of loss prevention once told me that auditing store operations and 
raising awareness of loss prevention would not be effective in uncover­
ing theft because these methods would in themselves help prevent store 
thefts. He thought was that audits are rote and repetitive and if effective, 
prevented instead of detected.
Today, auditors who are doing their job correctly, are using available 
technology, and are being meticulous about their job will uncover the red 
flags or high-risk transactions. In my experience as a consultant and loss 
prevention professional, I recall a time in which 15% of the audits performed 
at one company uncovered fraud necessitating an investigation. Training 
may have taken place where weaknesses were found. Proficiency ratings 
were communicated to management in an audit cover page. Most impor-
tantly, however, the company wisely used the chance to stop the fraud and 
catch perpetrators.

AUDITING BY PRIORITY
Let us now look at how to determine where to audit (e.g., stores, cor­
porate offices, supply chain) and in what order. The retail business 
will reflect shrinkage reserve on the profit and loss statement; where 
actual physical inventory results for the year exceed the reserve is where 
most loss prevention departments focus their audit programs. After the 
Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 passed in response to the massive corpo­
rate fraud scandals of 2001 and 2002, publicly traded companies began 
formulating audit committees that operate independently of the corpo­
rate board of directors. Responsibilities include monitoring and audit­
ing corporate governance and ensuring that all fiduciary reporting is 
accurate and approved by the company’s chief executive officer (CEO) 
or someone in an equivalent position of power. Thus, audit committees 
would likely require an internal audit department, which may examine 
all functional departments at corporate headquarters— accounts receiv­
able and payables, purchasing, treasury, finance, inventory control, and 
new store construction—and uncover material weaknesses or more seri­
ous errors that could contribute to reporting company profitability mis­
takenly on inspected reports. 
In many companies, internal audit teams also conduct store audits. 
Some larger department store chains have a store audit department to 
carry out financial and operational audits. In smaller specialty retail 
stores, the responsibility for store auditing generally falls on loss preven­
tion. Even in a business conducting operational audits in store locations, 
the loss prevention department may want to develop a very focused audit 
that tests prevention and control policies. The present chapter concentrates 
on the loss prevention department, which is charged with operational and 
loss prevention auditing at the store level.
Sarbanes–Oxley laws do require a certain amount of auditing of store 
controls. Although individual store results cannot affect the bottom line, 
stores in aggregate can affect the bottom line if they are operating improp-
erly, are violating policies, or are involved in fraud on a large scale. For 
example, in a now defunct drugstore chain, the CEO led aggregate fraud 
that was committed at the store level. He would have two or three trailers 
of store merchandise moved to a store, and the employees there would 
take their physical inventory. Once the store had an inventory result, the 
trailers would be moved to the next store on the inventory schedule and 
be counted in that store’s inventory. The CEO was inflating the inventory 
of the chain of stores so he could qualify for larger loans to buy more

merchandise. The business eventually went bankrupt, and the CEO is still 
serving a prison term.
Loss prevention team members may serve supply chain warehouses, 
distribution centers, and manufacturing centers by auditing physical 
security processes, merchandise security controls, and preshipment veri­
fications. The internal audit department will likely review inventory con­
trol processes and manufacturing processes.
Loss prevention departments should check for adherence to policies 
and protocols that are already in place, not for potential but not yet in place 
policies that will serve as a “gotcha” and will both skew the audit and 
anger a number of departments in the process. When determining what 
to audit in your stores, it is necessary to be guided by the policies and pro­
cedures that ensure control of the store’s financial, physical, and personal 
assets—that is, those geared toward prevention of dishonesty, protection 
of your people’s well-being, and maintenance of the store’s merchandise 
inventory. Developing questions that test the proficiency of the store’s 
adherence to those policies is one of the first ways to build the audit.
Federal guidelines such as state wage, hour and hiring guidelines, 
federal immigration and naturalization laws concerning fitness for work, 
the Health Information Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA), and 
Credit Information Protection must be considered, because if they are not 
followed they will result in heavy fines or business interruptions. In addi­
tion, think about what questions your operational business leaders have: 
are they policy oriented or just administrative? If leaders recommend 
questions not grounded in policy, then you may want to leave them off an 
audit and find some other method of testing them.
CONTENTS OF AN AUDIT
A basic retail audit document can be composed of any number of sections 
with between eight and infinite questions per section. A complete loss 
prevention and operational audit covers at least the following eight areas.
•	 Asset review: Depositing all receipts, daily balancing to the point 
of sale (POS), measuring management’s compliance to oversight 
of daily controls, gift certificate and gift card controls, and corpo-
rate supply credit card controls. This list of examples is inclusive, 
but it is important for each business to decide from an operational 
perspective what is most important.

•	 Exchanges, holds, discounts: This area reviews hold policies for 
customers and associates, exchange controls and inventory man­
agement of merchandise returned on an exchange, customer and 
associate discounting, and all associate transactions relevant to 
policies and procedures.
•	 Inventory control: A complete review of all receiving, transfer, 
recall, and inventory balancing procedures as well as physical 
inventory-taking practices and associate awareness of inventory 
results. Inventory adjustments are reviewed for accuracy and time­
liness in preparation. Proper authorizations must be ensured when­
ever adjustments are made to the business’s on-hand inventory.
•	 Voids, returns, passwords: This area of the audit reviews all voids 
and returns over a given period (3 to 6 months is usually a good 
slice of time) for adherence to policy. Prior to an audit, the auditor 
will use any available exception reporting system to capture the 
returns and voids for 3 months to a year, depending on volume of 
the store, to make locating them quick and easy. Returned mer­
chandise is researched and possibly located, if it has not sold, to 
ensure proper return to stock and to verify its validity. Passwords 
are reviewed to make certain they are being changed monthly 
and that responsibilities assigned for each associate’s level of 
security fits each person’s job description.
•	 Physical security: This area of the audit is mainly concerned with 
the doors, fire exit hardware, alarms, key control, emergency pro­
cedures, and trash controls. Incident reports are also reviewed for 
additional risks the store should be addressing.
•	 Manufacturing lab: This section is added if a location has a prod­
uct manufacturing or repair laboratory on site. It deals with 
assessing how policies and procedures are followed in account­
ing for physical (product) inventory, damages, and breakage of 
inventory. Some quality control inspections are completed, and 
associates’ adherence to safety standards is assessed.
•	 Human resources: This audit section reviews the hiring practices 
of the stores including reference checks, preemployment assess-
ment testing, and all other background testing. A review of I-9 
form completion is mandatory, and corrections must be made 
immediately. It is important to verify that personnel records are 
kept securely and not left out and available for anyone to read. 
Verification of new hire orientation, including a loss prevention 
message about honesty, can be made.

•	 Medicare, HIPAA review: Medicare and HIPAA are both govern­
ment control areas that must be adhered to by any business that 
files on behalf of customers for Medicare or is in control of per­
sonal health-care information. This section is used in organiza­
tions that include some type of health-care provider, like dentists, 
optometrists, and audiologists.
These eight sections show specific areas that are grouped together to 
suit a specific program. There is no limit to the number or types of sec­
tions that can be included in an audit of a retail store. These examples help 
visualize what an audit could look like. Each business should build audits 
around what is important in supporting it toward making its goals and 
fulfilling its mission.
SCORING AUDITS
To score an audit it is necessary to weight questions based on impor­
tance to profit loss prevention. For example, the question, “Are bank 
deposits made in accordance with company policy?” would be worth 
up to 10 points if a company had high missing deposit dollars from 
month to month. If a store suffers internal theft of deposits or a rob­
bery of one or more deposits in transit to the bank, it would be a direct 
loss in profit. In the same audit, a question, “Does the safe contain only 
authorized funds?” would be worth 2 points because a store would be 
able to operate profitably if there were money left behind by a customer 
in the safe.
Management should decide whether the overall score is more impor­
tant to the field manager than individual breakdowns of sections of ques-
tions. One option is to score each question at 1 point, thus eliminating 
arguments around why questions are weighted differently. Select the 
method of scoring that best fits your business.
The audit cover letter and scoring page should be taken seriously. 
These are the documents that report the location of the audit, manager 
of the store, date of audit, reason of audit, and scores for each section 
reviewed. A total score is indicated, and written narrative of findings 
is included so the recipients get the auditor’s objective conclusions of 
the strengths and opportunities for the store. This reporting document 
should be sent to a vice president-level leader along with regional and 
district management. A copy is generally sent to a director of audit and 
the internal audit department.

THE TRAINING BENEFITS OF AUDITS
Many years ago, when I first started in retail mass merchandising, it 
was a big deal when the auditor showed up at my store location. Every 
staff member was worried that we were doing something wrong and 
that was why we were being singled out for an audit. The store man­
ager would be sweating bullets, and managers would be on their best 
behavior. The one thing I remember that helped make the audits more 
tolerable is that auditors would quickly set everyone at ease by taking 
time to explain policies or procedures or how to complete a particular 
task. The auditors were trainers and never left the store until they were 
sure that someone in that store understood how to properly complete 
the operation for any audit question they were deducting points for. 
After one or two audits, we really looked forward to the auditor’s visits 
because we knew we would be learning the right way to do the job if 
we did not know it.
I cannot tell you how often I hear retailers admit that they dread the 
auditors coming because they come in teams, spend a week poring over 
every record and paper they can get their hands on and typing into their 
computers with a frenzy, and then leave. No one hears anything for a week 
or two, and then the ceiling falls in when the regional manager comes in 
to scold everyone for the bad audit score. No one learns anything. If you 
want to make an impression, take the time to teach, motivate, and explain 
everything. Never leave a store unit until you are sure that someone in 
that building knows how to execute the policies and procedures. Take 
an hour or two to explain the audit results, and talk with the store man-
ager. The payback is better follow-up scores, better-trained people, more 
highly motivated people, and bigger profit for your company.
AUDIT INTEGRITY
If you are setting up the audit department or are leading an existing 
audit department, then teach by example. Educate auditors on how 
to use audit sample sheets to track work product. When completing 
audits, have a system for how samples are pulled from storage data and 
reviewed. A system for when to pull data from the point of sales sys-
tem and when to dig into file cabinets. A sample tracking document 
will help guide the audit work and make answering questions easier. 

AN EFFECTIVE OPERATIONAL & LOSS PREVENTION AUDIT PROGRAM

The worksheet is the only part of the audit that should be completed on 
paper by hand, as gathering the required number of samples for each of 
the audit sections will be an asset when later answering the audit ques­
tions electronically. In a retail store, it is essential that auditors come in 
1 to 2 hours before store opening to run daily and monthly reports from 
the system and to obtain any information reports from the POS system 
before the day begins to avoid interrupting business. Next, they should 
pull sample returns, exchanges, and daily transaction records for each 
week that will be reviewed. Once the sample worksheets are used to 
guide the audit, auditors should use a portable electronic device (e.g., 
laptop, tablet, handheld personal digital assistant) that can be carried 
through the location while answering questions. Paper audits are dis­
couraged, since they will have to be transfered later to the computer and 
will thus hold up the review process with store management.
Employing auditing software to keep a uniform reporting environ­
ment is recommended. Professional auditing firms use software tools and 
programs such as Lotus Notes and Access. A number of effective audit 
management tools are available to loss prevention departments. Some are 
Web based, and the software resides with the provider. Others, like Loss 
Prevention Management Software (LPMS)–Audit, are purchased and 
reside on the company’s server. The system is updated with audits com­
pleted in the field each time loss prevention personnel connect to the cor­
porate network. I think this system is most versatile because it allows for 
working offline (i.e., it does not rely on Internet connections) to complete 
an audit and is easy to administrate.
Completing an audit correction action plan is important to ensure 
accountability to correct the audit deficiencies. While still at the store 
location, auditors need to help management identify the most important 
items to correct first—where they will get the biggest return for their time 
invested in creating new habits within the store. It might be the top five 
items that are selected. What supports the goals of the store and of the 
company? That is where the correction plan should concentrate. This 
audit correction plan should then be sent to the store manager’s immedi-
ate supervisor and the next level up with a copy to the auditor and the 
director of audit compliance for the company. If the store has not earned 
a passing score, a follow-up audit should be conducted approximately 90 
days from the first audit. On this audit, only the opportunities and action 
plan items may be reaudited.

HOW TO USE AUDIT SCORING EFFECTIVELY
A passing score for an audit should be 80% and above. Operational and 
loss prevention audits should be easily accessible, not kept secret. Since 
audits are based on stores’ policy and procedure, conducting one should 
be easy, right? One would think so. However, my experience has been 
that audits are a challenge because really operating a store—with all of 
the day-to-day difficulties—is complex. Workload plus payroll constraints 
minus sales-to-hours guidelines equals not everything getting done just 
the way it should be done. Because of this, consider equating audit scores 
to your company’s standards of performance (SOP) for a scoring system. 
For instance, if on performance reviews an SOP of 3 means that an associ­
ate meets the expectation, then on an audit a 3 would equate a score of 80% 
to 89%. If a 4 rating indicates that the associate exceeds expectations, then 
on an audit a 4 would mean 90% to 94%. The range of 95% to 100% would 
equate to a 5 on a review, indicating that an associate far exceeds expecta­
tions. At the other end of the spectrum, 70% to 79% would correlate with a 
2 on a review, meaning that the associate meets most expectations; below 
a 69% would equate to an associate failing to meet expectations. If store 
managers are rated on this type of system, then they will understand how 
the audit score they just received relates to their performance.
EXCEPTION REPORTING
Using exception reporting to lead the way on an audit is a smart way 
to proceed. A number of companies, such as XBR, a product from 
Datavantage, and Fraud Watch, a product from SAP, offer POS exception 
reporting. They operate in one of two methods: (1) pull data from a T-log 
file created from the company’s POS system; or (2) analyze the transac-
tions selected by the administrator or work in conjunction with the T-file 
and glean analytical data on a constant basis by mapping transactions. 
It is important to be aware that no matter what application you select, 
each one can be developed to analyze transactions specified by your 
company. It is very important to keep the software releases up to date 
and properly working.
Exception software will give insight into high-risk transactions and 
red flags in returns, exchanges, voids, discounting credit card transac-
tions, no-sales, potential for dropped sales, gift card sales and returns,

and more. How these data are presented in reporting is pretty much up to 
management and the needs of the business.
An exception reporting system is set up so ad hoc reporting can be 
done by all loss prevention personnel with access to the system and user 
rights or a license. Previously designed reporting by the system adminis­
trator that are always in a rigid format are available along with the ability 
to set them up to auto send to designated recipients on a daily, weekly, 
or monthly basis. The most useful return on investment for an exception 
reporting system is the time a loss prevention department saves when an 
analyst uses the corporate computer to identify potential theft situations. 
The exception reporting will take the high-risk transaction right down to 
the cashier at store level so that it is evidence of what was rung into the 
POS system.
For example, Cathy, the analyst in the corporate headquarters of a 
large retailer, runs exception reporting on high-dollar cash refunds for the 
entire company. She is able to see the chain average as a percent of sales 
for the chain, each region, and even down to store level. Cathy notices 
that region 12’s average cash refunds is 7.8%, much higher than the chain’s 
overall average of 2.5%. So Cathy scrutinizes cash refund dollars, sales, 
and number of transactions in all stores in this region and finds that store 
#112 has refunds at 9% whereas many of the other stores are closer to 
the chain average. Cathy can now pull up all the cash refunds for store 
#112 and view each cashier’s performance for the month specified. A line 
on the report will have the cashier’s associate number, name, sales, total 
refund count, refund dollars, cash refund count, cash refund dollars, and 
percent to sales. From this list, Cathy can now pick which cashier is driv­
ing the high percentage for the store.
As she looks through this store’s report, she comes across cashier 
7255, with $1,250 in cash refunds and $1,350 in total refunds and a 
cash refund average of 93%. Cathy selects cashier 7255 to see all of 
her refunds and is able to print these reports or save them for future 
reference in the investigation. Cathy starts an investigative case file for 
this store and is able to access each individual refund from the POS 
system including details of what was returned, the customer informa-
tion captured, if any, and method of tender. She can also determine if 
there was an original sale transaction for each refund in the exception 
reporting system. After pulling all of these data, Cathy may call sev-
eral customers to determine if they received acceptable service during 
their visit to this store. Usually she can also determine if they still have 
the merchandise or received a refund. If the store has a camera system

that integrates with the exception reporting system, Cathy can pull 
up each transaction on video within seconds and verify if a customer 
was present. At this point Cathy can turn the investigation over to a 
regional loss prevention manager for further review, interviews, and 
disposition.
The return on investment (ROI) given by exception reporting software 
justifies its purchase. Additionally, this software will more than double 
the quantity and recovery dollars of investigations for a year. From an 
operational and loss prevention audit perspective, using exception report­
ing software is an excellent time saver in cutting to high-risk transactions, 
saving hours of manual research by an auditor. In today’s environment 
where we are asked to do more with less this is just the tool you need.
When hiring loss prevention associates for the auditing function, it 
is necessary to find individuals who are meticulous and detail oriented. 
An analytical mind and consultative outlook are always good traits, but 
it is more important to find people who are technically capable than 
merely skilled in auditing. A college graduate from accounting, busi­
ness, or even criminal justice disciplines can be trained in audit skills 
the way your business prefers. We discovered that high-capacity per­
formance store managers make excellent auditors because of the wealth 
of knowledge they bring to the table about how a store operates. The 
loss prevention auditor position is an excellent stepping stone to another 
business unit or more responsibility in the loss prevention department. 
By recruiting the right people for the job, you will be able to enhance the 
professionalism and reputation for effectiveness of the loss prevention 
department.
FRANCHISE AUDITING
Franchises are prevalent in the food services industry, including 
McDonald’s, Chipotle, Panera Bread, and KFC. In specialty retail there 
are a few franchise operators. Individual business owners operate fran-
chise businesses and pay a royalty and advertising fee in exchange for use 
of the company name, company-generated advertising, and the goodwill 
the name generates to draw in customers. Each franchise is set up based 
on a legal contract with the corporate entity—an agreement between the 
franchise (or corporate entity) and the franchisee (small business owner) 
on how they will do business together. Franchise stores report sales

monthly and pay royalties as a percentage of the sales to the franchisor 
corporations.
It may be useful for corporations with franchises to develop an audit 
function dedicated to checking how franchised stores operate, focusing 
on accurate financial reporting as well as on helping business owners 
develop successful business habits. Audits may be offered as a self-help 
tool, where the owner could choose whether to accept recommendations 
to implement controls. Franchisors should use these types of audits as an 
opportunity to enrich business relationships, to identify financial control 
issues, and to improve the efficiency of the businesses. Identification of 
risk management issues and teaching loss prevention techniques would 
be a nice benefit of the program also.
The franchise audit program also reveals fraud through sample 
refunds, voids, petty cash, write-offs, credit memos, cash sales, no-sale 
transactions, discounts, credit card transactions, price overrides, and 
looking for register overages or shortages, altered documents, skimming, 
swapping checks for cash, missing documents, duplicate billing, false cus­
tomer data, special orders, and shipments to nonstore locations. Because 
corporate franchise audit teams are part of the corporate business, they 
cannot solve franchise owners’ problems or conduct their investigations 
but just deliver the evidence with suggestions for how the owners can 
deal with the losses. Because each franchisee is a seperately owned busi­
ness, they must solve their own problems.
A franchise audit team consists of two audit and compliance per­
sonnel. Because this is a financial audit, it takes two full business days 
conducting a review of two years’ worth of sales data. Approximately 
90 different aspects of the business are reviewed. This is one way the 
loss prevention department can show additional value for the company 
and can be viewed as a profit-generating unit based on the royalties and 
advertising fees that are returned to the bottom line. Most of the time loss 
prevention is seen as a cost center because such a department does not 
contribute to the company’s profit.
FIELD OPERATIONS AUDIT COMMITTEE
To make the operational and loss prevention audit department very 
effective and to make sure it fits into the mission and goal of your busi-
ness, it is important that leadership from critical areas of the company is

involved. A field operations audit committee (FOAC) would help achieve 
this goal. Different from the audit committee that reports to the board 
of directors, the FOAC is composed of operations leaders and decision 
makers and representatives of the legal department, associate relations or 
human resources, risk management, regulatory services, Sarbanes–Oxley 
compliance or accounting, and loss prevention. This committee has as its 
purpose the following:
•	 Updating and keeping all existing audits current, seeking and 
providing feedback on what each functional area would like to 
add or remove because of policy changes.
•	 Soliciting information on changed policies or upcoming initia­
tives that could require revisions or completely new audits to 
be created.
•	 Loss prevention gives updates to the functional areas on audit 
productivity and proficiency averages.
The director of your audit program should be charged with orga­
nizing and planning of the FOAC. That person calls the meetings and 
plans the agendas to be discussed and is also responsible for manag­
ing the workload that the committee agrees to implement. The com­
mittee should meet quarterly or biannually, depending on the needs 
of the business. This is the best way to keep all the functional areas, 
communicating through the year because their priorities will be their 
departmental goals. Between meetings, assign individual workgroups 
to handle details like reviewing audit revisions or creating audit ques­
tions and similar work. Approving and finalizing should be reserved 
for the FOAC meetings.
In conclusion, now more than ever businesses need some form of 
audit of the facilities they operate, especially since the passing of such 
laws as Sarbanes–Oxley and because of regulatory issues. Being a strong 
partner to the operational leadership and supporting the business mis-
sion and goals give loss prevention increased value to the bottom line.
By developing effecive auditing programs that uncover fraud and reveal 
opportunitites to be more proficient operators, loss prevention can ensure 
they are not left out when the business leaders are allocating loss preven-
tion budget dollars.

From the Ground Up
How to Build a Loss 
Prevention Department
Most loss prevention practitioners will enter an organization that has 
an existing loss prevention or asset protection department—not that 
these departments function flawlessly and that no improvements can be 
added.  It is a much larger undertaking to enter a company without any 
sort of existing loss-prevention department.  The seasoned practitioner 
will need to utilize all of their expertise and experience to make is suc­
cessful. Some seasoned loss prevention professionals are willing to go to 
smaller organizations such as a convenience-store or drugstore chains if 
they feel they have the chance to move up to director or vice president 
quickly. This section of the book will help those starting a new depart­
ment from scratch, which is rare, or those who have been hired to restruc-
ture an existing department into an effective and efficient organization.
WHERE TO BEGIN? A STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS
The first thing to remember if you are going to start or reconstruct a loss 
prevention department is that not everyone in the organization will know 
what it takes to have an effective program. The key to success is to break 
down this enormous project into a step-by-step process that is easier to 
manage than trying to tackle it all at once. Create an outline of the most 
important steps that must be accomplished, and include people who

would be an asset to the plan to whom you could go to for advice. This is 
your support network. These are the specialists with knowledge that can 
be assembled to bring your project to life.
For the purpose of discussion, it is assumed that a seasoned and proven 
loss prevention practitioner is charged with this project. The first objective 
is to write a business plan for the department. It is extremely important 
that the mission, vision, and goals of the loss prevention department par­
allel the company’s same goals. If the loss prevention department is not 
working to support the aims of the business at large, it will be doomed to 
failure. Most retail organizations are in business to make a profit and are 
funded by operating stores that take in money to create a profit. Loss pre­
vention supports this by reducing the drains on profit called shrinkage. It 
will be counterproductive if the stores are being operated by management 
committed to building a customer base and to creating an exciting atmo­
sphere where customers can touch and try on the accessible merchandise 
and loss prevention team members are working to lock up every piece of 
merchandise and accuse as many customers of theft as possible.
Along with a business plan and mission for the loss prevention depart­
ment, it is necessary to build a budget to fund the activities chosen to sup­
port the business. If investigations, auditing, and training will be primary 
functions of the department, then budgeting for field associates—most 
likely loss prevention managers—will be necessary. Budgeting for salary, 
benefits, cars, equipment, and travel expenses, among other things, will 
take care of staffing. You will also have to budget in development for the 
associates, meeting expenses, and communications. If the loss prevention 
presence in the company will be small, perhaps the budgeting will be 
for services from a company like LP Innovations, Inc., which can conduct 
audits and investigations in stores as needed. Where does the funding 
come from? Unless loss prevention is self-sufficient at selling something 
or raising the funds in some way, funding will usually come from the 
operating margin of the stores. This is why support of the overall goals of 
the company is so important.
Part of the business plan includes the strategy to accomplish your 
business objectives and goals. If shrinkage reduction is a goal, purchas-
ing electronic article surveillance (EAS) equipment and tags—for exam-
ple, acousto-magnetic, radiofrequency, and radiofrequency identification 
(RFID) devices—might be necessary to control inventory. Comparing 
equipment and testing it to validate its effectiveness are extremely impor-
tant before choosing a vendor. Conducting a request for proposals (RFP) 
period where vendors visit and compare system and pricing will help

determine the very best system for your organization’s circumstances. A 
large purchase for a large number of stores will likely need approvals 
from top management including the chief financial officer (CFO) of the 
company. If so, be prepared to prove return on investment (ROI)—that is, 
the savings to the company, or the return expected after spending capital 
on buying the equipment and tagging all the product. You must figure 
in all costs associated with the purchase including labor to maintain the 
systems from day to day, depreciation over 3 to 5 years, and how much 
shrinkage reduction at cost will pay for the systems and tags.
Whether building or refurbishing a loss prevention department, it 
is necessary to be masterful at planning and execution—that is, getting 
loss prevention managers to effectively get all the work done that is nec­
essary. Planning involves determining how many working days out of 
the year that a loss prevention manager has to actually be in stores to 
conduct audits or investigations. Take the year—365 days—and elimi­
nate all weekends, office days, vacation weeks, and holidays; then look 
realistically at what your field people will have available for influencing 
and shaping those physical inventory figures. That is the actual work­
ing time they will be in stores conducting audits, investigations, and 
training. This is invaluable information when determining how many 
stores loss prevention managers should be assigned at the district and 
regional levels.
Department store chains with store allocations that cover a loss pre­
vention representative in every store have an advantage because there will 
be someone working on the mission, goals, and values of the department 
daily in every store. Some retail chains have a loss prevention manager 
who covers two stores in proximity if both are experiencing challenges 
with shrinkage. This gives store-level associates increased experience in 
planning their use of time and emphasis for each of the stores. District 
loss prevention managers might have 12 to 15 stores in a district, depend-
ing on store volumes. Regional loss prevention managers may have from 
5 to 10 district managers.
Specialty retail may have only district or regional loss prevention 
managers, who take a larger quantity of stores with smaller volume and 
focus on stores that need them the most. They have to budget their time 
to make every minute count. Some specialty retailers might see value in 
having a manager cover a few stores in proximity and focus on awareness 
or internal investigations and report to the district or regional person. 
Extremely important are good organizational and planning skills to help 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿

guide these employees in the right direction. Most retailers use physical 
inventory results to determine what stores get priority for visits.
Some organizations take a more expanded approach and use excep­
tion reporting as an indicator of top-priority stores. Exception reporting 
reveals “low-hanging fruit,” or employees who are stealing from the orga­
nization and who are easiest to recognize. These individuals simply do 
not care or are just plain sloppy in their thievery methods but usually 
do not get caught. They have been stealing for who knows how long and 
getting away with it. They probably do not even realize that the company 
now has a loss prevention department and that their secondary income 
will soon come to an end. These individuals will stand out when excep­
tion reporting is used.
Measuring results is the next step in building a lean and effective 
department. Leaders of the loss prevention department should under­
stand where the small successes and small failures are taking place 
because this helps in keeping perspective and in making adjustments to 
the overall plan. Reviewing the inventory results and providing the com­
parisons between inventories to show the trends at the store, regional, 
and chain level with the executives will help them understand how far 
you’ve come. Reporting on investigations, recoveries, auditing, profi­
ciency scores, training opportunities, burglaries and robberies, restitution 
collected, and business abuse hotline responses are all examples of cat­
egories you want to report information on because they affect profit. You 
want to keep on top of the categories that are measurable and provide 
those metric to those who need to know. Keep in mind, using measur­
able categories such as case count, to set quotas is an ineffecive method. 
Even more important than the metrics of the department are the personal 
phone calls to operations management requesting feedback on how the 
loss prevention department is performing: “Are we meeting the expecta­
tions for helping solve field managers’ problems? What more can we do?” 
Stellar customer service from loss prevention demands that no calls go 
unanswered. Responding to all calls for advice, investigation, and train-
ing creates winning loss prevention departments. In loss prevention, the 
customers are the stores, the field operations management, anyone in the 
corporate office who needs our expertise, as well as customers who fre-
quent the stores.
Setting a vision and developing leaders are two extremely important 
functions of the department’s leadership. Without a vision for where the 
department is going, associates will lack direction. It is really important 
to set performance objectives that align not only with the company’s 

From the Ground Up
167
© 2011 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC
objectives but also with where the department is headed. A lofty vision 
might be to reduce shrinkage and increase professionalism. This vision 
is lofty because its focus, individually, are completely different. But if 
approached correctly, they can each be achieved. Part of a loss prevention 
department’s future is developing leaders for tomorrow. Associates need 
to know that their leaders want them to advance and be successful. Many 
of the most successful departments promote from within whenever pos­
sible, have little to no turnover, and are constantly developing their associ­
ates for future leadership roles.
Do not get so specialized that the silo effect sets in and associates 
are left out of mainstream business. Do not be afraid to get involved in 
functions not related to loss prevention in the company. For instance, con­
ducting audits of hiring practices or franchise business financial audits 
may not be directly related to shrink reduction, but they add value to the 
department. Franchise audits on financial reporting that uncover unre­
ported sales and returns royalties to the bottom line make loss prevention 
look more like a profit center than a cost center. Are we loss prevention 
persons who happen to do some business, or are we business associates 
who happen to specialize in loss prevention? I would rather be the latter. 
When senior management notices the value that loss prevention brings 
to the table, you can be assured that you will be invited to the table of 
many projects that should have loss prevention perspectives added, such 
as designing the store of the future. To be invited, loss prevention leaders 
need to be well versed in all the functions in the business and be seen as 
a collaborator with all areas.
Motivate and encourage associates to be effective and successful. If 
you are the leader of the department, be the biggest cheerleader when 
your associates do something great. Build them up when they get that first 
big investigation recovery. Send a reward when they surpass the shrink­
age goal. Call them personally on their birthday or anniversary with the 
company. Let them know you empathize with what they go through daily 
to achieve the goals. Do not expect that others within your new organi-
zation will somehow know all the achievements being made every day. 
Especially in a newly formed department, wins need to be broadcast pub-
licly and frequently. The announcement needs to be targeted at specific 
individuals, such as those funding your endeavors.
Presentation for displaying your wins is critical. You will likely be 
invited to executive meetings with other department heads, during which 
they will provide an update of what is going on in their respective areas. It 
is imperative that you outperform others because you need money to grow 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
168

your department. The only way you will get the money you need to be 
successful is to show that good things are starting to happen. To measure 
success, you will need to have a starting point. Go back to the prior year 
and retrieve any available statistics—for example, shrinkage, internal and 
external cases, audits. The good thing is that out of the three different areas, 
shrinkage may be the only statistic available because people not in loss pre­
vention usually conduct the inventory. Therefore, if there were no cases or 
audits for the prior year and there are three cases and two audits for the cur­
rent year, progress is being made. A good rule of thumb is to use PowerPoint 
to show your wins. This allows you to use graphs so the message is clear 
that the organization is definitely moving in the right direction.
Always ensure when hiring a new associate to seek out input from others 
in the department and from associate relations and possibly the legal depart­
ment after interviews are conducted. Always reserve the final say for your­
self. As leader of the department, always be sure to have the final interview of 
all new hires. The hiring process is the best place to determine if new associ­
ates will fit in with the culture of the company and with fellow associates.
RESET LOSS PREVENTION EXPECTATIONS
Initiating loss prevention in an organization can be like going from warm 
weather to cold weather without realizing the change is going to occur. 
Employees need to be slowly acclimated to a new culture that embraces 
ethical behavior and proper controls. Transitioning from a culture that 
did not adhere to strict policy and procedures to one that has many checks 
and balances can be a shock, not to mention very overwhelming. The 
newly formed loss prevention department needs to define its game plan 
and carefully organize the rollout. When expectations are reset for any 
type of situation, the desired result is that the old behavior will cease and 
the new teachings will become part of everyday life; however, old habits 
are sometimes hard to break.
To be successful, start with the most important parts of the program. 
Before the establishment of a loss prevention department, employees had 
most likely been getting away with everything. They need to understand 
that dishonesty of any nature no longer will be tolerated. Do not take for 
granted that employees will automatically understand the many faces of 
dishonesty, so provide a few examples, such as stealing money or product 
as well as falsifying company documents or cheating to increase store sta-
tistics. As you are discussing the new expectations with the group—even 

From the Ground Up
169
© 2011 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC
the executive group—pay attention to body language as you start to 
expand on the cheating portion. If employees begin to squirm in their 
chairs, this may be a good indicator that cheating is widely accepted in 
the organization.
Do not forget to tie in the requirement from the Sarbanes–Oxley Act 
that cheating in the workplace be reported to Wall Street. The act brought 
compliance and financial integrity to the forefront of many publicly traded 
corporations. Businesses are now expected to have outside auditors who 
check controls, an audit committee, and top executive certification of 
financial results reporting. Information technology (IT) departments must 
have integrated compliance controls to assure that proper verifications are 
being made and that no material weaknesses are known exist.
After you cover the main points of being honest, you will want to 
discuss how employees’ daily lives will change. This is the part where 
resistance will begin. Most employees are probably not stealing from the 
organization necessarily; therefore, telling them not to steal will not cause 
any extra work. However, when you begin to discuss all the new checks 
and balances that managers will need to adhere to, they will be thinking 
of how much more time it is going to take. When assigning additional 
work to employees, it is paramount that you discuss the “what’s in it for 
them” and consequences for noncompliance. If managers receive bonuses 
for profit, they will be able to relate to a discussion of how the new con­
trols will increase profit and reduce losses. If payroll hours are somehow 
related to profitability, you can discuss how they will be able to have more 
payroll hours when the new controls allow their store to become more 
profitable. Set clear expectations on how long employees and manage-
ment have to implement the new practices within their stores. Give them 
a reasonable amount of time to implement the new guidelines, but be 
very clear on the consequences for not following the directives. Be sure 
that someone will be able to monitor the progress—using something as 
simple as a checklist to be mailed to a supervisor—or employees will be 
less likely to comply.
FACING THE CHALLENGES
When it comes to starting any kind of a new department, there will always 
be roadblocks, which can include executives’ unreasonable expectations 
and not having enough money to do the things you need to do. When you 
take over an existing department, the expectations are usually less than 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
170

starting from scratch because executives will already understand loss pre­
vention and its function. They expect good if not great results, but they 
are usually reasonable. When an organization does not have existing loss 
prevention, some of the expectations can be unreasonable because they 
do not understand how policies must change to bring along prevention 
awareness and build a culture of integrity. Some organizations expect 
that by the next inventory cycle, results will have improved immensely. 
For those of us who have ever taken over a bad store or bad region, we 
know that it is not likely that the store or region will improve after one 
cycle. Because we are indirect influences, it takes time to get everyone 
on board with the new program. You will not get people’s bad behaviors 
to change overnight. You will be lucky to get them to change during the 
inventory period for the following cycle to reflect the results.
The same is true when starting a loss prevention department: its effec­
tiveness will probably not be noticed right away. That is why having fre­
quent and candid conversations with executives about what you are doing 
is the way to validate the department’s worth. Explain the process and 
that the overall results might not be immediately evident. Executives are 
looking to see if they made the right decision by starting a loss prevention 
department, and reducing shrinkage is one way for them to see that they 
did. They must also be patient and realistic in their expectations, though. 
Take time to build the proper relationships with the executive team when 
you first come on board. You want to display your expertise and business 
sense, but you do not want to come across like an arrogant know-it-all. 
They are less likely to be unreasonably critical of your efforts if they trust 
you and understand your plan. Ensure that they understand the approach 
you are taking and how you plan to reach the goal. Do not be afraid to have 
discussions regarding readjusting the goal if it is unreasonable. Some new 
people feel like they need to agree to fit in, but they are setting themselves 
up for disaster if they know what they agreed to do is unachievable.
Dan Mania, security director of Delaware North, is someone who 
knew he needed a loss prevention department. Delaware North is a global 
leader in hospitality and food services with operating companies in the 
lodging, sporting, airport, gaming, and entertainment industry. I met 
Mania in 2007 when he contacted me regarding an article I had published 
in Security Management Magazine. The article was about creating a culture 
that is not conducive to employee counterproductive behavior. Mania 
asked if I could come and speak to his security personnel from across the 
nation regarding the topic, and I agreed. He does not have a retail loss 
prevention background, but he is well versed in all aspects of security. He 

From the Ground Up

also understands the correlation between employee behavior and organi­
zational actions. Delaware North has retail venues within their lodging, 
sporting, and airport locations. Because the retail venue revenues pale in 
comparison with those of the casino and resort establishments, the focus 
has never been on establishing loss prevention for the retail side of the 
business. Mania saw this need shortly after he came on board and contin­
ued his quest until he finally was able to get a position approved for a loss 
prevention manager. I asked him to discuss his plight with getting the 
organization to understand the need for loss prevention:
Q: What made your organization realize it needed a loss prevention 
department?
A: Simple question—complex answer. We are a food and beverage conces­
sions and retail company at heart with some fierce competition 
in our markets. As a result, we face a daily battle to innovate and 
become ever more competitive. It would be inaccurate to say 
that we woke up one morning and “realized” that we needed a 
loss prevention department. For a long time, the company has 
understood and recognized the importance of efficient opera­
tion and minimizing avoidable loss, but more recently our com­
petition in the marketplace has helped us place a greater focus 
on the value of loss prevention. Also, recent strategic planning 
and internal management development studies convinced our 
management teams at all levels that focusing on loss prevention 
across the organization was simply the right thing to do.
Q: Why were retail losses not a concern before?
A: They were, but only recently did the company feel that it was appropri­
ate to manage avoidable loss from a strategic, corporate perspec­
tive. In the past, to some extent, we viewed shrink as a “cost of 
doing business.” Essentially, we permitted our operating groups 
to accrue a certain amount of loss because it was “unavoidable.” 
For a variety of reasons, our philosophy has evolved, and we 
now believe we can do better for ourselves, our partners, and 
our customers if we measure and manage risk to our margins 
and profitability via strategic loss prevention.
Q: What process did you follow to finally get approval for the position?
A: I do not believe in doing anything “just because.” I believe in data and 
in facts. To some extent, my approach is low key and subtle, but 
in the end I think I pick and choose battles that I know I can 
win. I pushed for a more strategic approach to loss prevention 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
172
© 2011 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC
during our corporate strategic planning process. I slowly, but 
steadily, introduced data from our industries and our com­
petition to help raise awareness and understanding. I devel­
oped presentations for management at every level to help raise 
awareness and understanding, and I took every opportunity to 
express my opinions. In time, I think momentum behind the 
idea of strategic loss prevention built, and the company began 
to look at it as the tremendous opportunity that it represents. 
Finally, I sponsored a group of managers during an internal 
training and development program that analyzed shrink and 
the potential impact of a loss prevention program on our com­
pany. I wanted to take the opportunity to objectively show 
executive management that my approach was worth a try. In 
the end, the group recommended the creation of a corporate 
loss prevention leadership position, and executive manage­
ment agreed.
Q: What are the expectations for the individual you hire?
A: I expect the new corporate loss prevention manager to bring the right 
acumen, experience, and approach to this critical role within our 
organization. The company is taking a “show me” approach, so 
the key will be to demonstrate value and ROI. Of course, this is 
a process, and it will take time. Success will not happen over­
night; rather, this is a long-term venture that will require sig­
nificant organizational change in many ways. The organization 
will be patient, but it will be incumbent upon us to demonstrate 
value. I expect the new loss prevention manager to start with 
the basics. First, within the company’s cultural and technol­
ogy framework, we need to ensure that we are accurately mea­
suring the scope of the problem. Then we can develop a game 
plan to attack it. I don’t expect the new LP manager to show up 
on the first day with that game plan in detail, but this person 
should bring the experience and acumen to the table to be able 
to develop it in time.
Q: What do you believe will make or break the position?
A: If the interview team and I do our job, we will find the best fit with the 
fewest personal and professional obstacles to success. Executive 
management understands the need and supports the role, but 
the key will be to show that our sole interest is in improving 
the business. Our goal is to make our company more efficient 

From the Ground Up
173

and more profitable. If we hire the right person, in time, he or 
she will earn the support and attention for our loss prevention 
agenda. Once that happens, we will have a tremendous oppor­
tunity to positively, and strategically, improve business opera­
tions and profitability at every level.
Mania’s story is not unique in trying to justify the need to estab­
lish a loss prevention department to an organization. Although he had 
a bit more stacked against him than most because his business is not 
all retail—the smallest portion is retail.—his approach to justifying 
the need was the right way to do it. He did not go into a board meet­
ing and tell the executive team that the shrink numbers are bad and 
that is the reason the organization needs a loss prevention manager. 
His approach was very methodical. He did his homework before he 
said a word. In addition to a small portion of the business being retail, 
Delaware North has a very large security department that could be 
construed as having loss prevention personnel. Mania had to ensure 
that the organization understood the difference between security and 
retail loss prevention.
After Mania completed the necessary research on loss prevention, 
he began to present his findings to the executive team. He conducted 
research by talking to people in the field of loss prevention, by read­
ing articles on the subject, and by researching similar businesses to see 
what they are doing to prevent retail losses. He did not leave any stone 
unturned because he wanted to have all the answers before the ques­
tions were ever asked. The presentation of the research was critical to 
accepting the information. One key thing Mania learned through his 
research is what the competition is doing with regards to loss prevention. 
He learned that one of Delaware North’s competitors had an established 
loss prevention department that was able to show favorable reductions in 
shrinkage over time. This information was crucial because every organi-
zation wants to stay on top of its competition.
One thing Mania had that some loss prevention people lack is 
patience. He had to have a great deal of patience. It took a long time and 
much hard work to get the position approved. Because of all his hard 
work and gathered information, Mania was able to provide the executive 
team with a full understanding of what retail loss prevention really is 
and would be for the organization.

MAKING IT SUCCESSFUL
Following the steps does not mean that the department you formed or 
refurbished will be successful. It may mean that you now have a function­
ing part of the organization, but is it really doing what you envisioned? 
Is it making the stand you hoped for? Is it producing the results that are 
expected? Think of it as a home remodel. You have a vision, and you want 
it to come to life. You may have seen the end result in magazines or on 
TV, but you were never exactly sure how to get it there. You solicited the 
help of some professionals who have already done it, but the challenge of 
succeeding still remains. You took all the precautions and followed all the 
necessary steps in the hopes that your remodel will be perfect. The only 
way to gauge that is to the see the reaction from others as they walk in. 
If they are mesmerized by your work, you have accomplished your task. 
If they walk in and say, “Nice job,” you have performed mediocre. If they 
do not react at all, you know what that means. The same is true of your 
newly created department. You want executives in the organization to be 
wowed by what you are doing and what you are going to do. You want to 
be sure they are certain the investment is well worth it. This is no time to 
just get by, because you will not be able to make your department grow 
on getting by. To fully understand how to make a successful loss preven­
tion department, I solicited the knowledge of Paul Jones, global director 
of asset protection for eBay and former vice president of asset protection 
for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. He has more than 20 years of 
retail loss prevention experience.
Jones believes that to know whether you are successful, you must be 
able to define it. This is where knowing the organization will be help­
ful. Some organizations are very results driven, whereas others pride 
themselves on having a stable culture. Understand how the organization 
operates and what makes other departments successful in the eyes of the 
executives. Jones gave the following ways of defining success relative to 
loss prevention:
•	 Maintaining shrink.
•	 Reducing controllables such as safety expenses, worker’s com-
pensation, loss prevention costs, lawsuits.
•	 Human and emotional capital; improving the functional relation-
ships so you are an invited business partner.
•	 Part of success is to gain credibility as a business leader, not just 
a functional expert. Loss prevention needs to sit at the table with

senior leaders and participate in full business conversations and 
be seen as credible.
Jones believes that one of the main factors of being successful is imple­
menting measurements. You start by hiring the right people, getting them 
to believe in you, and being seen as an authentic person. When you hire 
the right people, working with those people allows you to develop a strat­
egy for success. Then you motivate them in the execution process, remove 
hurdles, and have robust conversations along the way. The conversations 
should focus on the hurdles and results.
The theme of relationships once again surfaces. The “us versus them” 
stigma must be completely removed for loss prevention to be viewed as a 
business partner. Without this partnership, it is virtually impossible to have 
success—not because you are not delivering the desired results but because 
the people who are assessing those results do not particularly care.
A big part of the job is to discuss the wins and hurdles and to ensure 
that loss prevention is elevated to a business discussion, not just a topic 
discussed during inventory, Jones explained. Unsuccessful loss preven­
tion leaders wait for an event to initiate a conversation regarding loss pre­
vention. One role of loss prevention leaders is to market their department 
internally and make certain they are providing value to the organization.
The marketing portion of the job—where the leaders are separated 
from the doers—is where most will fail. The leaders will not be involved 
with the day-to-day functions of the audits and investigations; rather, they 
will be at the table with the other leaders of the organization discussing 
how integral and invaluable the loss prevention department is to the suc­
cess of the organization. The appropriate marketing is easier said than 
done. Loss prevention leaders need to be salespeople who want to ensure 
their customers keep coming back because they like what they see and get. 
As with anything, the better it looks, the more desirable it is to others. Some 
loss prevention leaders do not have outstanding results but are extremely 
successful in the eyes of the loss prevention community and to their execu-
tives. That is because they have marketed what they are doing properly.
Jones described his success using a multipronged approach to mar-
keting. Just because one thing works does not mean it is the only thing 
that can be used. There are many different avenues for communication. 
See what the organization currently is accustomed to and follow it.
E-mail is one good way to communicate items such as internal news-
letters, which provide high-level overviews of what is going on in loss pre-
vention. Of course, you want to describe the wins and provide necessary

information. Nothing should be put in this letter that executives might 
not know is going on. For instance, if there is an internal investigation that 
will provide critical key opportunities, make sure the people who need to 
know about the investigation are aware before you release any documents 
pertaining to it.
Another part of the marketing strategy is to have formal senior execu­
tive team meetings. Jones recommends that these meetings be held two 
times per month to discuss what is going on in the department, again 
with a high-level overview. Executives like to have graphs and visuals that 
drive the point home; therefore, either printed documents or a PowerPoint 
reflecting the wins should be given at least once per month during the 
meetings. Most executives expect loss prevention people to be analytical, 
so you are providing only what is expected.
Meetings and newsletters are pretty standard ways of communicat­
ing. Jones also found that organizing a shrink steering committee (SSC), 
composed of department heads who make decisions regarding shrink­
age, is effective in helping executives view the loss prevention team as a 
business partner. This approach is effective because it makes executives 
who are not necessarily thinking about shrinkage routinely responsible 
for it and for discussing it during meetings. As we know from earlier 
chapters, employees who have a vested interest in the organization will 
usually perform better and have fewer instances of dishonesty. The same 
approach is used with the SSC. Employees who are now directly involved 
with a facet of the business they had nothing to do with before will be 
more concerned about the results. This concern will turn into action in 
the departments they manage. For instance, if an executive from the mer-
chandising department is on the SSC and one of the main contributors to 
shoplifting is the location of product in the store, this executive will listen 
to why it should be moved. If this person is not directly linked to shrink-
age, the answer will usually be that the organization is not merchandising 
for shoplifting; it is merchandising for customers and sales.
NECESSARY TOOLS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM
It would be nice to have all the information you need at your fingertips 
for any new venture you start. However, finding the resources you need, 
especially when it is something that was previously nonexistent, can be 
an ordeal. Because loss prevention is so specialized, it is difficult to locate 
all the information you may need in one area. For those who have never

started up a loss prevention department but are now challenged to do 
so, having the information they need readily available would make the 
journey much easier. Thanks to the Loss Prevention Foundation (LPF), 
resources have been compiled to make life much easier for the loss pre­
vention community.
The Loss Prevention Foundation is a nonprofit organization that 
assists the loss prevention community by providing educational resources 
including two certification programs for loss prevention: loss prevention 
qualified (LPQ) and loss prevention certified (LPC). Foundation members 
have access to many online educational resources that can help advance 
their career and broaden their perspective on loss prevention as a profes­
sion. The following sections provide resources that are extremely useful 
to anyone in loss prevention. They were taken directly from the founda­
tion’s Web site. The information is split up into the following categories:
•	 Associations
•	 Online publications
•	 Loss prevention resources
•	 General resources
•	 Search sites
Websites are provided to help you in your loss prevention journey. Many 
of the publications such as Loss Prevention Magazine are in print as well. 
Some of the associations require individual or organizational member­
ships, and others do not.

SUMMARY
Because loss prevention is a tight-knit community of professionals, it is 
evident which organizations have highly successful departments. These 
departments are often featured on programs such as MSNBC when there 
is a need for a public discussion of theft. These departments have broken 
away from just being involved in their own organization and have dis-
tributed their wisdom so that others take note. It is not difficult to have a 
loss prevention department that performs statistically but that is seen by 
employees as a necessary evil. It is much more work to establish a depart-
ment that is recognized as an integral part of the organization, as well as 
vastly knowledgeable, by society at large.

Investigative Practices of a 
Loss Prevention Department
INVESTIGATIONS DEFINED
Investigations can be defined as the relentless pursuit of the truth concern­
ing who, what, where, why, how, when, and how much is involved in the 
commission of a crime. Investigations have a twofold purpose: (1) to iden­
tify the perpetrator of a crime; and (2) to identify the evidence that proves 
the intent of the perpetrator of that crime. Of course, there are other defi­
nitions, but I like these because they reveal the inquisitive nature of the 
investigator. In a retail business setting the most successful investigators 
are those who are inquisitive and driven by proving the details of the inves­
tigation. According to the National Retail Security Survey conducted by Dr. 
Richard Hollinger and Amanda Adams, graduate research associate in the 
Department of Criminology, Law, and Society at the University of Florida, 
retailers generally attribute 42% of their inventory shrinkage to internal 
or employee theft. In this same survey retailers estimate that it accounts 
for $15.5 billion in losses just from this single crime category. Employees 
are responsible for a higher percentage and dollar loss than shoplifting, 
operational or administrative errors, and vendor theft (refer to Figure 3.2 in 
Chapter 3). Assuming that retailers are supposed to entrust the store and 
its contents with the associates, this presents a very complex relationship 
between business owner–operators and their associates concerning trust.

UNDERSTANDING THE PARTS OF MANAGEMENT
This chapter deals with the investigative practices of a loss prevention 
department. Before we discuss investigations, it is important to understand 
that the philosophy of loss prevention is to prevent theft and policy viola­
tions that could result in the loss of assets, including associates because 
they may make a poor decision and may be terminated. When associate 
theft occurs, we look upon it as a failure of management. Management 
could have prevented the need for an investigation by enforcing the 
policies, training associates about the procedural controls, and creating 
awareness about the loss prevention department exception reporting and 
auditing. Management with good integrity is expected to make positive 
examples and model the way for associates.
According to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners’ 2010 
Report to the Nations on Occupational Fraud and Abuse, there exists a 
strong correlation between a perperator’s position of authority and the 
losses incurred by fraud. All too often even management may be involved 
in theft (Figure. 11.1). The Report to the Nations projected that 36.7% of 
theft was committed by employees and 17.1% was committed by owners 
Figure 11.1  Many times management is involved in fraud and internal theft.

and managers/executives. An investigation was initiated in a specialty 
retail store in the mall when loss prevention analysts uncovered an 
Internet auction site tied back to a store manager who was selling high-
fashion jewelry and accessories for deeply discounted prices. The inves­
tigators located the manager’s store and noted that it had jewelry and 
accessory shrinkage. During the interview the manager confessed that he 
would take two or three pieces of merchandise every time he worked by 
placing them in his insulated lunch box because he was sure that no one 
would search it. This manager had been stealing for the last 2 years and 
confessed to taking more than $205,000 in merchandise; his Internet sales 
confirmed this. This store had a policy in effect that required all associ­
ates including management to have bags, briefcases, and lunch contain­
ers searched before leaving the store. This store was not conducting the 
required searches, in violation of company policy. When this happens, it 
is still a failure of management. Field management team members have 
responsibilities to control their stores and to lay down the policies and 
expectations as much as store managers.
Every time an investigation is concluded, the investigator must pro­
vide some training to make sure the manager or field manager left in 
charge understands where the policy violations were and what controls 
were violated that could have prevented the bad choices of associates who 
were investigated and eventually terminated for theft. Following are sug­
gested fraud prevention tips investigators may discuss:
•	 Numbered and controlled manual receipts
•	 Proper balancing of receipts to tender amounts on a daily basis
•	 Trash controls
•	 Balancing monthly bank statements
•	 Proper balancing of credit card transactions
•	 Monitoring exception or high-risk transactions
•	 Verifying refunds controls daily
•	 Monitoring bank deposits daily
•	 Use of mystery shop program
•	 Use of closed-circuit TV for surveillance
•	 Employment application controls and verification
•	 Regulatory compliance
How does your retail business obtain information about dishonesty? 
Investigators may find all the investigations using their own devices, but 
if so they are missing a lot of potential investigations. My research exam-
ining investigative case data year after year indicates that tips or the need

for investigations came from the following, listed in order of highest fre­
quency of occurrence:
	
1.	Regional managers calling their regional loss prevention manag­
ers to report theft
	
2.	Store managers calling their regional loss prevention manager 
(RLPM) to report theft
	
3.	Use of exception reporting software to aid loss prevention ana­
lysts to find theft
	
4.	Anonymous reporting on a toll-free business abuse hotline
	
5.	Uncovered by the RLPM while conducting an operational and 
loss prevention audit
	
6.	Store inspections turning up evidence such as empty blister packs 
in a secured stockroom
In a culture that emphasizes an open-door policy for associates to feel 
welcome to discuss issues with their manager without the threat of retali­
ation and the right to expect confidentiality if they want it, this is how 
the reporting of theft might look. In a culture that is not as open or does 
not emphasize communication as much, the use of a hotline might be at 
the top. What is important to take away from this is that there are a lot of 
ways to find out about theft. Be open to as many lines of communication 
as possible.
CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS
There are many good reasons to conduct investigations internally instead 
of hiring a third-party vendor or investigative firm. One of the most 
compelling is the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) guidelines, which 
require disclosure of investigations being conducted by a third party to 
the subject of the investigation. Before any employment action is taken, 
such as counseling or termination, the results of that investigation have 
to be disclosed to the subject of the investigation. You can see how that 
would not be in the best interests of the results of the investigation or 
the company. Similarly, when conducting a criminal background check 
using a third-party reporting agency, we must have associates’ authori-
zation to conduct the criminal background check and notify them of the 
results and the company’s intent to take employment action before any is 
started. Most companies get consent for all inquiries into their criminal 
background along with all other prehire reference checks, drug testing, 

Investigative Practices of a Loss Prevention Department
195

preemployment testing, and educational background during the applica­
tion process. Just be careful to consult with your legal department because 
the FCRA requires specific wording and specific format requirements on 
the preapplication authorization form.
During an in-house investigation where a criminal background check 
is necessary to learn about suspects’ history, the appropriate authorization 
form must be signed before the criminal background check can be 
started through the third-party consultant. Once the background check 
is obtained, a copy of the resulting report and copy of subjects’ rights 
under the FCRA must be submitted for their review. Additionally, a letter 
explaining whether the company will be taking employment action must 
be submitted to persons in question. Subjects of the investigation have the 
right to provide evidence that the background check is not correct and 
prove that their background does not have the alleged blemishes. After a 
reasonable time has passed, the company may proceed with the intended 
employment action.
Once a decision is made that an investigation is needed based on the 
information provided or evidence uncovered—and we will assume the 
investigation will be done by proprietary investigators—it becomes neces­
sary to look for more evidence and proof that a crime was committed and 
that there was a perpetrator who committed the crime if one is not already 
identified. Investigations may also be done to uncover policy violations, 
such as sexual harassment and sharing a computer pass code, but we will 
continue this discussion as if it is a theft investigation. It is necessary to 
establish the credibility of persons making allegations. Go beyond the 
accusations to ensure that the information is not motivated by personal 
conflict between the two parties. A fact-finding interview should be done. 
This is a little less formal than an interview with a suspect but is struc-
tured enough to obtain the truth. First, verify the accusing associates’ full 
name, address, position with the company and date of hire. Ask open-
ended questions to allow subjects under investigation to give the whole 
statement including the details that make it clear to them that a theft did 
take place and who the thief is. Getting a written collaborating statement 
of the facts as the accusing witnesses see them will help ensure that the 
facts do not change later in the investigation. Sometimes accusers will 
be very comfortable with verbal accusations but do not feel good about 
writing out the accusation. Their internal conscience works against them 
when it comes to writing accusations out if they are not true.
Next, look for physical evidence of the theft by examining the store 
sales floor for some theft indicators such as empty clothing racks with 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
196

empty hangers on them. Another piece of physical evidence would be the 
paper trail with shipping receipt documents, price changes, sales transac­
tion records, discarded price tickets, control logs, damage slips, and even 
discarded price tickets—any items that prove the product was in the store 
at some time and went missing. Some retailers have a very good handle 
on what merchandise is believed to be in the store. They can use a prod­
uct’s stock-keeping unit (SKU) or universal product code (UPC) to verify 
it in the inventory-keeping system in their computers. They can identify 
every sale, refund, transfer, and receipt of that particular SKU and deter­
mine if that item should still be on the shelf in the store. Finding written 
documents proving or disproving allegations of theft of funds can include 
expense account statements including restaurant receipts, mileage calcu­
lations, and unauthorized claims for expenses that would not normally 
be approved. In cases of expense account fraud, look for blank restaurant 
checks filled in by hand.
When investigating credit card fraud, the obvious evidence is the 
credit card receipts that might show multiple sales to one credit card 
and multiple refunds to one card over a few days or all on one day in a 
week. Sometimes store associates will be involved in counterfeit credit 
card schemes. Counterfeit credit cards can sometimes be recognized by 
the first four digits not matching the issuing company’s code identifying 
the type card. Exception reporting software such as Aspect LP Software, 
Triversity Fraud Watch Software, and XBR from DataVantage can help 
identify credit card fraud. One very valuable exception report is a daily 
list of credit card returns that show the original sale transaction on one 
card, for instance, a Visa card and the corresponding refund transaction 
tendered on a Master Card that happens to have the refunding associate’s 
name attached. The scheme is to find a big sale on a credit card and then 
refund it into associate’s debit card account, thereby filling it with cash to 
be withdrawn.
Return fraud is one of the most serious internal theft schemes that 
affects every retailer and often accompanies other types of theft commit-
ted by the same associates. Associates often feel a false sense of security 
from being able to cover up the theft of cash from the register till by creat-
ing a fraudulent refund in a customer’s name. The customer may not have 
visited the store recently. Refund fraud comprises approximately 42% of 
the investigations I have reviewed over the past few years. In one such 
investigation, a store manager of a leased optical shop within a larger 
department store would remove cash from the host store’s cash register 
and create a cash refund as the reason for the missing money. The optical 

Investigative Practices of a Loss Prevention Department

shop point-of-sale (POS) system, which ran separately from the host store 
POS, was not updated with the refund. What uncovered the thefts was a 
report by the host company showing stores that were experiencing large 
cash deductions from the leased shop business. In this case, cash deduc­
tions did not immediately tip off the investigator to examine refunds. 
Cash theft, end-of-day balancing errors, and petty cash loans were also 
potential symptoms of this problem. The store manager was found out 
by the host store cash office supervisor who told the investigator that the 
optical shop had a lot of cash returns for which the manager took loans as 
she did not have the cash in her POS system in the department. The opti­
cal shop had very low returns of any type because this manager was not 
recording them in her register in violation of policy. The investigator never 
thought about refunds being the cause. The store manager confessed to 
$16,000 in fraudulent cash refunds, petty cash vouchers, and stolen mer­
chandise. After the investigation, controls were put in place to require the 
host store manager to verify refunds for the optical shop manager. An 
exception report was developed on cash deductions from the host store 
charged against the business. Other controls that might work when the 
POS system for the store revision also includes using exception reporting 
to look for high percentages of cash refund to sales. Calls to customer to 
verify returns should be done by the manager in charge and verified by 
auditors. Proper signature requirements must be enforced. Original sales 
receipts must be attached to the refund to show where the product was 
previously purchased.
Purchase orders can be a source of paper evidence when investigating 
a misappropriation of funds case. The scheme involves a purchasing office 
associate who sets up bogus accounts and receives kickbacks for steering 
business to a particular dishonest vendor. The vendor usually agrees to 
send an additional invoice so a check may be cut for a bogus account from 
which the dishonest purchasing agent withdraws the money. Purchase 
orders are still issued, but there may be more than one for a vendor. Look 
for vendor account addresses that match employees’ home addresses. 
Look for unauthorized orders and forged authorizations. Purchase orders 
should be in proper sequence and inclusive. Even in a computerized sys-
tem, there should be a way to verify that every purchase order number 
has been used for a valid vendor account.
Invoices prove to be another source of evidence when investigating 
invoicing fraud. The invoicing clerk sends invoices to a vendor for more 
than was actually ordered. Checks for payment are still processed in the 
same way. This works especially well if there is a lack of separation of 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
198

responsibilities between the person approving invoices and the person 
receiving checks and posting them to accounts, which might be the case 
in a small company. Look for checks payable to employees. Bogus vendors 
send checks from the company that are then intercepted by the associate.
Evidence concerning the POS system includes cash refund slips, void 
receipts, unauthorized discounting, no-sales, and bank deposit slips. 
When examining these types of documents look for signatures of cus­
tomers that match those of associates, associates misusing the authori­
zation codes, and failure to follow the company policies that you have 
established. Voids and refunds should always be tied to an original sales 
transaction, and many companies have the policy that it be attached to the 
void or refund for reference.
Witnesses should be interviewed to gather the facts of what they 
observed and what they know. Witnesses’ statements should be written 
out to ensure all of the facts are documented. When interviewing wit­
nesses it is important to stress confidentiality with them by assuring them 
that their statements will be kept confidential, and they should be told 
that there is an expectation that they keep their discussions with the inter­
viewer confidential. Make sure you have considered all possible victims, 
perpetrators, and witnesses to the crime you are investigating, and pri­
oritize them for your preferred order when you begin your interviews. 
Sometimes, a matrix of all employees with proximity to the crime can help 
determine common denominators and even pinpoint the prime suspect. 
However, if you do not have a prime suspect, use the matrix to determine 
those who are furthest away from the actual commission of the crime to 
start your interviews. Interview those who have the most involvement 
or knowledge about what happened toward the end, and save the main 
suspect or suspects for last. The reason for this is that each interview will 
reveal additional facts about the crime or theft. If you do not have strong 
enough evidence to indicate a suspect, you may pick up additional facts 
and indicators to strengthen your convictions about an individual you feel 
is responsible. You may also learn enough to change your mind, based on 
new evidence, that the responsible party is someone already interviewed 
as a witness or the person reporting the crime.
RISK CONSIDERATIONS
Once you have learned of the crime, have gathered physical evidence, 
and have taken witness statements, it becomes increasingly important to 

Investigative Practices of a Loss Prevention Department
199

involve others in your business like human resources or associate rela­
tions, operations management, and the corporate legal department. Do this 
before commencing with interviews of those suspected of involvement in 
the crime. Associate relations should be in the loop on all investigations. 
Some companies make the notification after the entire investigation has 
been completed. It is a matter of preference, but I have learned that investi­
gation dispositions go a lot smoother when the associate relations partners 
expect the call or are actually involved in the investigation. They provide 
precedents previously set by the company on case disposition decisions. 
They can also provide past performance history about the associate you 
are investigating. Some companies do not feel they get the support from 
associate relations and make the termination decision without the input of 
this department. I believe that having this partner is necessary to ensure 
that no mistakes are made in the termination or counseling action. If alle­
gations arise on the part of the person being investigated, it is extremely 
helpful to have the support of associate relations.
The legal department should always be involved to approve investiga­
tive techniques that have case law decisions applied to them. For instance, 
if you are planning to use closed-circuit (CCTV) for surveillance, it is smart 
to get legal advice. CCTV can be used in public places where associates 
do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy but should not be used 
in restrooms, dressing rooms, and locker rooms. In some states, audio 
recording (e.g., CCTV) is highly regulated, and both parties must consent 
or else that evidence is inadmissible in court and/or plain illegal. In other 
states, only one party must consent to recording conversations. Your attor­
ney is the best person to help keep your investigators out of trouble; check 
with them on such investigative techniques as controlled buys, secret 
shoppers, and any investigation that overlaps ongoing legal proceedings 
in which an associate is involved with the company. Attorneys can also 
provide attorney–client privilege protection on the work product of the 
investigation. In most cases, the legal department must be informed of the 
next steps before you take them.
Operations management must be involved every step of the way in 
the investigation of their associates. Without the partnership of the man-
ager or associates being investigated, it will be very hard to have access to 
evidence that is in their immediate work area and to them for interviews. 
Operations can give insights into other pending problems with the indi-
vidual, which can be included in the investigation. The operational man-
ager will help arrange the interview time and place and will help cover 
the store if necessary. Once the investigation has been completed, the final

disposition must involve the operational manager, who will have the final 
say on termination of the dishonest associate with input from the investi­
gator and associate relations.
Creating an investigative file becomes necessary as documents and 
witness statements start to accumulate. This may be at the beginning of 
the investigation or later as needed. Some practical steps can be taken to 
help keep a large case file organized, and to make evaluation of the evi­
dence effective include the following:
	
1.	Verify and document each piece of evidence on a table of contents 
sheet that will appear at the beginning of the file. This is more 
important on larger files.
	
2.	Carefully maintain the chain of evidence so it is in the investiga­
tor’s possession at all times.
	
3.	Operate under the assumption that every investigation will end 
up in a court of law, even if you will not be prosecuting.
	
4.	Remember that any notes written about the case included during 
the interview are part of the case file and will be read in court. 
Never express opinions of a suspect or make off-color comments 
that you would not want repeated in front of a crowd.
	
5.	Include the company’s approved investigative case report that 
documents all the facts about the investigation and the narrative 
that describes the investigation and disposition.
	
6.	Include all statements of witnesses and the confession of the 
suspect.
	
7.	Include any promissory note or court documents pertaining to the 
case.
Establishing intent is going to be necessary to be able to prove a case in 
the event you decide to prosecute, so it is advisable to start thinking about 
that early on in the investigation. Associates’ intent to steal from a retail 
business is usually proven through confession, because a good one will be 
written out by the associates themselves. Even if a statement is not taken, 
intent can be proven by their actions. Once they remove merchandise or 
cash from the store, intent is obvious. We cannot know what they were 
thinking, so we either have to get them to write it or prove it by their actions. 
So in determining if we should prosecute suspects, we consider if the accu-
mulation of evidence and the statements supporting the case lead a reason-
able person to believe they intended to act as they did. Did they knowingly 
break a law? What possible defenses or denials will they give? These are all 
things to consider when preparing to interview main suspects.

CONDUCTING INTERVIEWS WITH SUSPECTS
Assuming that suspects have been identified after reviewing the collected 
evidence and after considering all witnesses statements, the next step is to 
interview all potential suspects. Planning the interview is just as impor­
tant as conducting the interview to obtain the desired result: a confession 
from the suspect. Decide where the interview will take place, preferably 
an uncluttered office or private room with a desk and three chairs. A door 
is nice for privacy but not always necessary. If there is a door, it should 
be left unlocked, and the suspect should be told that they are not locked 
in during the beginning of the interview. If the interview will be con­
ducted in a small, single-coverage store, work with the store manager to 
set up coverage so the associate can be away for at least an hour and a 
half or longer. Some retailers make it mandatory that a witness sit in on 
the interview; others do not require it. A female witness is necessary if a 
male is interviewing a female. A male witness is necessary if a female is 
interviewing a male.
Next, run through the interview in your mind, and jot down some 
questions. What rationalizations will you use to help make it easier for 
the suspect to confess? How will you address denials? Do you have con­
fidence in your evidence and your ability to obtain a confession? The 
way the interview is conducted will have a direct impact on whether a 
confession is obtained. If you go into the interview having doubts about 
suspects’ involvement, it will show up in your voice and your physical 
behavior as an interviewer. Your interviewee will pick that up and you 
will not get a confession. Some retailers are very numbers oriented, and 
investigators are encouraged to build their caseload to show increased 
productivity. If investigators are numbers driven, it is an unproductive 
environment and does not do much for confidence. Confidence builders 
include the following:
•	 Being comfortable with the evidence gathered because it proves 
suspects’ involvement.
•	 Having enough rationalizations available and jotted down in 
your interview file.
•	 Thinking ahead about the denials and jotting down how to han-
dle them.
•	 Knowing everything about the crime being investigated.
•	 Knowing everything you can learn about your interviewee.

I received interview training from Wicklander-Zulawski, a Chicago-
based company. They are the experts in techniques used for interview­
ing and interrogation, and their basic course is called “Interview and 
Interrogation Techniques.” Before an interview I would always create 
a rough outline of the interview format I learned from them with my 
notes specific to the case I was about to interview for. I am not going 
to attempt here to do justice to teaching the reader how to interview. 
We will reserve that for the book written by Douglas Wicklander and 
David Zulawski titled Practical Aspect of Interview and Interrogation 
(1993) or one of their workshops that take two full days. For the pur­
poses of the present book, I spent some time talking with Mr. Zulawski 
about some current topics that practitioners often ask about and that I 
thought might be interesting.
Q: A large part of our book deals with the psychology of the culture 
of integrity, and that was presented in the first three chap­
ters. How do you view integrity as related to associate 
dishonesty?
A: The culture of integrity begins with management’s dealings with 
the public and its associates. Management should address the 
idea of integrity from the start of an employee’s career with 
the organization. Managers should present a distinct message 
that employees are not permitted to steal and the company 
believes in integrity. A lot of times it is implied by the busi­
ness, but it is important for management and loss prevention 
to explicitly say it and set expectations for employee behavior. 
Dishonest employees assess the risk of detection versus the pos­
sible reward if they steal. If the reward outweighs the risk, a 
theft occurs. There are at least three parts to a loss prevention 
program: awareness, audit, and investigation. All of these help 
reduce the level of internal theft at a company.
Q: When an investigator is conducting an interview and the subject will not 
confess despite having good evidence and picking up signs that 
the subject is being less than truthful, what advice do you have?
A: If an investigator is having consistent problems obtaining an admission 
with a solid investigation and evidence, he or she is probably 
doing something wrong. Examining the strategy being used to 
open the conversation and the overall structure of the interview 
is the best way to identify the problem. The strategy and struc-
ture employed has a lot to do with the interviewer’s success or 

Investigative Practices of a Loss Prevention Department

failure. Once the investigator has progressed to a point in the 
interview where the suspect is making repeated denials the 
chance of salvaging it fades. In our experience problems and 
denials in an interview are generally caused by something that 
the interviewer did or said to the suspect. Another cause of a 
difficult interview is subjects who have had an opportunity to 
prepare themselves for the interview and to create a strategy of 
denial to protect themselves. Some suspects are difficult to deal 
with for a variety of reasons. An interviewer should have antici­
pated a more difficult interview because of their personality or 
their previous experience being questioned. People tend to react 
to conflict in a similar fashion each time they are in a similar sit­
uation. As a result, the interviewer can profile these individuals’ 
likely responses based on what they have done previously in 
dealings with managers and other associates. The interviewer 
can anticipate that employees who have acted aggressively pre­
viously will likely do so again since this is a preferred strategy. 
Another example of a difficult interview might occur in a union 
environment where employees are encouraged to ask for union 
representation when they are interviewed. Having a union rep­
resentative in the room often disrupts the interview process and 
makes it more difficult to obtain an admission. The investigator 
operating in this type of environment is generally well advised 
to develop enough information to terminate the employee 
without an admission since obtaining one may be very diffi­
cult. Each of these instances can usually be planned for, and the 
investigative process should focus on developing evidence that 
can be used independently of an admission to terminate the 
individual’s employment. Associate relations can give advice 
on what information is necessary to terminate the associate. If 
we are unable to obtain an admission, associate relations will 
have already decided what must be established to terminate the 
dishonest associate.
Q: What are your thoughts on using negative-based statements that can 
document lies and discrepancies as opposed to the facts?
A: There is little value in taking a statement from a suspect if it simply 
denies involvement in the crime—for example, “I didn’t steal the 
deposit.” However, if the denial is accompanied by the individ-
ual’s alibi or an in-depth account of events, it may be very valu-
able. Such a statement can be analyzed using statement analysis

techniques to look at the structure of the alibi and possible omis­
sions that may lead to further questioning. In addition, by doc­
umenting details the investigator has locked the subject into a 
story that may be subject to investigation. By disproving the lies 
and identifying significant omissions in the subject’s statement 
the interviewer can destroy the credibility of the individual’s 
testimony. When there is evidence of dishonesty or a violation of 
policy, we may use a participatory accusation. In a participatory 
accusation the interviewer allows the subject to talk about his 
or her alibi, understanding of a policy, or the sequence of events 
in an incident. The investigator holds back the evidence allow­
ing the subject to lie, thus increasing the power of any evidence 
discovered during the investigation. If a suspect stole a deposit, 
for example, the person might have added to the story that he 
does not have the combination to the safe and was not present in 
the store on the day the money went missing. Contrary to these 
assertions the investigation has revealed that the manager gave 
the suspect the combination and there is a videotape of the indi­
vidual in the store on the day the deposit was taken. Using this 
type of an accusation the interviewer has trapped the suspect and 
established that he has clearly lied. For the participatory accusa­
tion to work the interviewer should lock down all the plausible 
excuses the suspect might have for the evidence. For example, if 
a store manager is seen putting merchandise into his car, what 
plausible explanations could he have for doing so? Transferring 
product, giving a donation, or perhaps returning merchandise 
could all be possible scenarios the manager might use to explain 
away the seemingly damning observation. However, once he 
has discussed how product is transferred, donations given, and 
returns made—none of which include putting it in his car—he 
can no longer use them to explain away the observation.
Q: How important is it to operate under the assumption that every 
investigation will end up in a court of law, even if you will not 
be prosecuting?
A: Always prepare investigations as though you are going to prosecute 
or be sued for your actions. Do not do or say things you would 
not want to come out in a courtroom full of people. Lawyers are 
going to prepare an argument to defend their client, and your 
statement, case notes, and investigation will be examined and

criticized for any shortcomings. They will look at what you did 
and more importantly what you did not do.
Q: When I attended the WZ Interviewing and Interrogations Techniques 
workshop, I learned about building a matrix, or Employee Data 
Sheet, for cash theft or cases where many people had access to 
the lost cash funds. Are these tools still recommended?
A: Exception reporting has gone a long way toward replacing the data 
sheet in targeting dishonest associates. The data sheet captures 
biographical information and characteristics about employees 
that help rank the associates from high to low risk of stealing. 
By looking for characteristics associated with people who steal 
and then organizing these items in a data sheet, we are able to 
assess the likelihood of theft activity by the employee. Those 
employees falling into the high-risk category are more likely to 
steal than those in the low-risk categories. The data sheet can 
also be useful when trying to narrow down a field of suspects 
or determining where to focus an investigation. This is a tool 
that can often help narrow the investigative targets and the cost 
of an investigation.
Q: Lately there has been litigation alleging forced confessions. What is 
your advice toward avoiding that risk?
A: First and foremost is a careful investigation followed by a substantiated 
confession detailing the individual’s participation in dishonest 
activities. Attorneys tend to take cases with a good storyline 
where they believe they can win because of the weakness of the 
case. The attorney creates a plausible argument that puts the 
interviewer and company in bad light. Most companies bring 
a witness to the interview so they may testify as to what went 
on and what was said. The company now has the interviewer 
and witness to testify what happened plus a written or recorded 
statement from the employee admitting dishonesty. Many 
police departments have mandates requiring all interrogations 
to be videotaped so there is no dispute over what happened or 
was said. Some retailers have taken up this practice and require 
recording of all interviews. Finally, a statement from the suspect 
containing substantiation supporting the investigative findings 
goes a long way to defend the company. The voluntary state-
ment is the crown jewel at the end of the case, which can create 
significant problems for the opposing counsel.

Q: What is your most valuable advice to investigators or loss prevention manag­
ers starting out in their career of investigating and interviewing?
A: Every new investigator should develop the essential skills for the job. 
These skills provide the foundation for future development and 
increased responsibilities. Investigators should be looking for 
something that sets them apart from coworkers. One essential 
skill is learning to interview and close cases. As a starting point, 
attend a Wicklander-Zulawski & Associates Interview and 
Interrogation Techniques seminar to learn the fundamentals of 
the interview process. After that, use what was taught in class 
exactly as it was taught. Most people do not have enough expe­
rience to decide whether what they are going to try will have 
a positive or negative effect on the subject. The WZ technique 
has developed over years of trial and error by experienced 
interviewers, so there is no need to recreate the wheel. Next, 
look to profession certification, such as becoming a certified 
forensic interviewer (CFI) or certified fraud examiner (CFE), to 
establish your credentials. Certification is a credential that goes 
above and beyond work experience and will set investigators 
apart from others in the industry. Remember, the skills taught 
in an interviewing class are really communication techniques 
relating to persuasion that will serve well in an interview or the 
boardroom. There are so many senior executives who credit the 
interviewing skills they developed as one of the most important 
aspects in their rise to success.
Before an interview it is smart to review suspected associates’ person­
nel files to record their correct name and address, date of birth, date of 
hire, and position in the interview notes. This file can be a wealth of infor-
mation about individuals’ educational level and prior life experiences 
from their employment application. This could be a help in the interview 
because you will be able to relate to interviewees’ educational level and 
understand their likes and past to try to develop a rapport with them.
The following paragraphs provide an introduction to the possible 
interview stages; investigators are encouraged to explore details sur-
rounding interviews in classes for more in-depth understanding. Start the 
interview with some friendly questions to establish rapport and establish 
your own credibility. This introduction should be used to explain who 
you are and your role with the company. Talk about what an investigation 
is and why one is necessary. Spend between 15 and 25 minutes on this

introduction, and bring up common themes that help associates feel more 
relaxed and recognize that they have something in common with you.
Ask some nonaccusatory, fact-finding questions such as to verify the 
address of the associate. Ask if they understand the policy relating to 
the violation or theft you are interviewing about. Watch their physical 
reactions and verbal responses to understand how they respond to ques­
tions that you would expect them to answer truthfully. This is important 
because it helps to establish a baseline to compare against when soft accu­
sations are made. For example, we would expect suspects to answer ques­
tions about their length of employment or current title honestly without 
feeling threatened or put on the spot. They should be able to talk about 
their address and previous education without feeling any stress, unless 
your investigation deals with lying on a résumé or application for employ­
ment. If that is the case, select other introductory questions.
As the interview progresses and rapport has been established, you 
should move into some rationalization with subjects to help them rational­
ize that it is in their best interests to tell the truth. An example of rational­
ization might look like this: “Well, Jeremy, I’ve been speaking to company 
employees for many years, and I have always been able to help them feel 
better about the situation once we have gotten all of the facts out on the 
table and the company can understand why you made the decisions you 
did about that deposit.” If interviewing over the phone, it could go like this: 
“Jeremy, I have been speaking to associates like you for many years; do you 
think that if this were a very serious issue that I would be speaking to you 
over the phone? I would be meeting with you in person instead, right?”
If you feel like the interview is progressing well and the subject has 
been very cooperative, if you have been keenly aware of the suspect’s 
behavior and have been looking for submission in posture like lowering 
of the eyes, lowering of the head between the hands, and sitting back in 
the chair in a more relaxed manner, you might make a soft accusation 
using an assumptive question like, “Well, Jeremy, you are a good-natured 
individual, and it is very hard for me to believe that you planned this; 
wasn’t it a spur of the moment decision?” At this point Jeremy’s response 
will determine the next statement. Jeremy can respond that he did not 
plan to take the money and that it was spur of the moment. This is his 
initial confession. On the other hand, Jeremy can respond with a denial. 
If denial is what Jeremy chooses, do not even let him get the denial out 
entirely, interrupting him to start him back on the path of rationaliza-
tion. It is necessary to continue the rationalization themes until you hit 
upon one he identifies with. This process is perhaps the hardest part of the 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
208

interview process because you must be able to find themes to talk about 
and keep control of the conversation until a confession is made.
If Jeremy does make a small confession, you must keenly pick up 
on that and begin to develop it. Another assumptive question might be 
appropriate: “Jeremy, what is the most you have ever taken in one day 
while working at XYZ? $500 a day?” Jeremy might say, “Absolutely not. 
I never took more than $100 in a day.” Here is the second admission that 
helps support the first softer confession. It is important to avoid questions 
that can be easily answered or that can be construed as leading the associ­
ate. Allow Jeremy to tell of his involvement on his own insomuch as he is 
able to develop the picture. Ask open-ended questions about other inci­
dents that took place, when, for how much, and who else was involved.
Once you are able to get all your questions answered, it is time to begin 
a written statement explaining to interviewees that committing their state­
ment to writing will help protect them by ensuring that the truth is docu­
mented in their own words and that the truth does not change. In support 
of the investigation the statement of confession has a number of important 
uses, primarily to describe the crime in associates’ own words for criminal 
and civil hearings. Statements can impress upon a jury that the confes­
sion was made voluntarily. Some company legal departments prefer an 
informed consent document because it sets the tone of what is to come. 
Informed consent forms record the name and address of the associates 
about to be interviewed along with their position and location of their job. 
It lets associates know they are being asked to cooperate in a company 
investigation. It states that they are not being detained against their will 
and they can leave the room. It also states that if they choose not to cooper­
ate, they will be subject to possible employment action, including termina­
tion for failure to comply with company policy, which requires them to 
cooperate with investigations. This idea of informed consent may appear 
to be an obstacle in getting cooperation. I have used it in all face-to-face 
interviews but not in phone interviews. I have never experienced one inter-
viewee who read the consent and left the room. I have experienced a few 
who would not sign it, and that is okay because I just continued with the 
interview. On the positive side, informed consent makes it much harder 
for suspected associates to make a claim that they were detained against 
their will for little or no reason. In the event that associates sign the docu-
ment and then determine later to leave the interview unfinished, you have 
strong grounds to act on their uncooperative behavior. While that will not 
solve the crime, it might help eliminate a bad apple from the store.

Investigative Practices of a Loss Prevention Department
209

The confession can be written or recorded, depending on the com­
pany’s policy. Written statements should be taken on lined paper like 
a legal pad or in a statement format approved by your company’s legal 
department. Statements have an introduction, a body, and a closing. In 
the introduction interviewees will identify themselves with their name, 
address, place of employment, location of their work unit, and date and 
time of the statement. They will state that they understand they are mak­
ing a statement of their own free will without any threats or promises. The 
statement must be written out by interviewees in their own handwriting, 
and any mistakes they make should be changed and initialed by them to 
acknowledge the change. In the body of the statement you may give some 
prompting to ensure that necessary identifying information is captured, 
especially if the statement is being taken on a lined legal pad without the 
formatting. If a format is used, you will want to be sure that the informa­
tion is filled in thoroughly, as many statements reviewed are lacking in 
the area of thoroughness.
The body of the statement will be where interviewees write out their 
confession including all the details of the theft. This part of the statement 
must not be dictated by you. Leading questions should be used only if 
interviewees evade the facts of their involvement. The best way to start is 
to explain to interviewees that this is their chance to tell the truth about 
their involvement and help decision makers know that they are sincere 
about making amends with the company. Most people will want to make 
things better. There are those who will not see it that way, so you must 
be aware of what is being written. Occasional breaks in writing can be 
taken to review what was written. It is preferred that you learn to read 
upside down, which comes with practice. A good explanation of what is 
expected will get interviewees started and will get most of the facts docu­
mented. Questions may be asked to have the interviewee document what 
is needed. An example would be, “Jeremy, why did you remove the $100 
from the deposit?” Jeremy might reply that he needed to make a car pay-
ment and did not have the cash. This helps to prove the intent and that 
there was a use for the stolen $100. Besides the who, what, where, how, 
why, and how much that must be captured in the statement, it is necessary 
to obtain a statement of knowledge that the action was theft. You might 
have to ask the question directly. Another approach would be to ask inter-
viewees how they feel about the action now in light of their confession. 
The intent is to get them to apologize and to show their remorse because 
they knew it was wrong.

The conclusion of the statement will be an acknowledgment of the 
interviewee that they are making a statement of their own free will. The 
most important thing that must be said is they affirm that the statement 
they made is true. They might also mention how they were treated dur­
ing the interview process. This statement should be signed by the inter­
viewee, you, and a witness. It is also a good idea to include the times the 
interview began and ended in the conclusion, and the interviewee should 
write these times. If a promissory note is to be taken, it should be at the 
conclusion of the interview. A promissory note is a civil document used 
as an agreement with associates that they will pay back what they have 
stolen. Promissory notes should not be used when associates will be pros­
ecuted. Most police departments will not even entertain taking your case 
if a promissory note is signed because it turns your issue with the associ­
ate into a civil issue. The interview is concluded by thanking associates 
for their cooperation in the investigation.
Thus far, I have not said a lot about how to treat a suspected associate. 
At all times during the investigation and during the interview, courtesy 
and a businesslike demeanor are necessary. Never threaten suspects with 
physical harm or criminal prosecution to extract a confession. Always 
keep in mind that they are just that—suspects—and your job is not to 
find guilt. That is the responsibility of the courts. Our job as investiga­
tors and interviewers is to find the truth. As a company investigator, our 
responsibility is to remain objective throughout the investigation and its 
outcome. We should refrain from forming an opinion that suspected asso­
ciates are guilty. We may make a statement that we have obtained over­
whelming evidence pointing to the associates’ involvement. Then leave it 
to the courts to determine guilt or innocence. I have avoided using inter­
rogation to describe the interview process because of the harsh stereotype 
associated with it through the media and television shows. Treating inter­
viewed associates with dignity is essential to maintaining the reputation 
of a retail loss prevention department.
Once the investigation is concluded, you should discuss the results 
with the human resources manager and immediate supervisor of the sus-
pected associates and make a recommendation for termination of employ-
ment. If no confession is obtained, then all details and merits of the case 
will need to be reviewed to determine what action should be taken with 
interviewees. Prosecution of the confessed can be initiated by calling the 
police to the locations to take a report and take them into custody while 
they are still present, or charges may be filed at the court if the decision 
is not made to prosecute immediately. Prosecution should be pursued in 

Investigative Practices of a Loss Prevention Department
211

cases of criminal activity where there is a theft of cash, fraud, or theft of 
merchandise. Of course, law enforcement should be called in on work­
place violence or violations of laws. When a policy violation is being 
investigated, it is likely there is no evidence of a law being broken. For 
instance, in the investigation of unauthorized discounts, there may be a 
violation of your company’s policies. That may be a violation of policy but 
not against the law. The business legal department can help determine 
how to proceed.
Most state laws allow retailers to make a civil demand of shoplifters 
and in many cases of dishonest associates who commit refund fraud or 
steal merchandise. A civil demand is one for the payment of a set fee, 
such as $100, in addition to the recovery of what was stolen. Some states 
may allow double the damages. The best way to navigate the civil demand 
laws is to work with a company such as Civil Demand Associates that 
specializes in those types of collections. If your company is intent on col­
lection of civil demands in house, consulting the legal department is the 
best avenue. Be aware that in the majority of states a civil demand should 
not be pursued if criminal prosecution has been initiated.
PHONE INTERVIEWING
Phone interviewing is a viable tool when investigators are weighing the 
cost of a trip to meet with a suspect in person in light of the alleged loss. 
Some retail businesses use a centralized investigative unit in which ana­
lysts use exception software to mine the data for potential cases, and, 
after pulling together all of the evidence from POS reports and exception 
reports and sending the local field manager into the store to pull docu­
mentation, they turn the investigative file over to the investigator to con­
duct the interview and complete the case. Some benefits of conducting 
phone interviews, besides the potential expense savings, involve mak-
ing it easier to prove that suspects were never forced to cooperate with 
the investigation because they were on the phone and could have simply 
hung up the phone to end the interview. Another benefit is that today’s 
younger generations are intimately connected to cell phones. They shop 
using their phone to get opinions and make decisions and to communi-
cate with friends using their phones. They are very comfortable talking on 
the phone to the point that it is a preferred communication mode. While 
interviewers cannot see associates’ physical behavior on the other end of 
the phone, with practice interviewers are able to pick up cues from their

vocal tones. With a few minor adjustments, managers can set up the inter­
view and get the location ready. They do not have to witness the entire 
interview but come in at the conclusion of the interview, place the phone 
on speaker, and listen to the interviewee verbally repeat the admission. 
They would then stay in the room and assist with taking the statement 
from their associate.
Use of a loss prevention case management system will help with 
investigative case report review where approved cases can be closed out 
by supervisors. A good case management system can help organize the 
reporting of case statistics and conduct analysis on the number, locations, 
types, and amounts of the cases the loss prevention department is han­
dling. There are a number of case management systems available today. 
Some are Internet based, and the data are stored in the case management 
software companies’ databases. It is always accessible, but you have to be 
connected to the Internet to complete case reports and view reports. If 
your company’s Internet connections are robust and rarely drop off, then 
this may be a viable and less expensive option. One example of this type of 
case management system is Wazagua (http://home.wazagua.com). If your 
business likes to own software that achieves and provides both an online 
and off-line reporting tool, explore Loss Prevention Management Software 
(LPMS; http://Lpguys.com), which will reside on your company’s server. 
These are just two examples of a number of case management systems 
available to the practitioner.
This is the short story of internal investigative practices of a loss pre­
vention department. Whole books have been devoted to the topic of inter­
view and interrogations and criminal investigations. This is an overview 
of investigative practices with some emphasis on risks to the business if 
investigations are not handled correctly. Investigations must go through 
a review process by the leadership of the loss prevention department 
to assure quality control of the reports, evidence files, and statements. 
Developing good partnerships with your legal, human resources, and 
operational professionals will ensure good decisions are made all through 
the investigative process. Being meticulous through the investigation and 
concise in reporting will help to ensure good court ready investigations 
with minimal risk.

Selecting the Best for Your 
Loss Prevention Department
SELECTING ASSOCIATES FOR SUCCESS
Finding the right fit for a loss prevention position can be a challenge. After 
you begin the process, you will quickly learn that not everyone fits the 
mold. Most will fall into the Papa Bear (too hard) or Mama Bear (too soft) 
chair, and few will fit in the Baby Bear (just right) chair. The “just right” 
individual will exhibit many characteristics that were a combination of 
many other individuals who were interviewed with regards to a person’s 
ability and skill. The recruiter for the position must be able to differentiate 
between a motivated business professional and an “old-school ex-cop.” 
Experience in the business will be a definite plus when it comes to the 
selection process. Over the years you have been able to see what works in 
the business and what does not when it comes to personality. The trickiest 
part of recruiting for loss prevention is finding the right combination of 
analytical skills and an affable upbeat personality. If you settle for some-
one who possesses only one and not the other, you will most likely have 
problems down the line. The job posting must be very specific on whom 
you will consider for employment. Countless employees in retail organi-
zations want to be in loss prevention because, as they will put it, it seems 
like a cool job and they are attracted only for the thrill of the chase. If you

are requiring a college degree, make sure that you specify the type of 
degree you are looking for, which will weed out people you do not want.
Many colleges and universities offer associate’s and bachelor’s degrees 
in criminal justice, police sciences, and corrections, which provide a sub­
stantial background for the law enforcement aspects of loss prevention or 
asset protection. However, these majors are weak in preparing students 
for loss management/security management, business administration, or 
accounting, all things a retail management position might require. Do not 
forget that retailers are looking for business managers who specialize in 
the loss prevention or asset protection fields. Being well rounded is very 
important here.

associated with a specialization usually require a degree just to get an 
interview, and many organizations will not negotiate on this prerequisite 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿

and will eliminate résumés that do not meet certain education require­
ments.  So why don’t all postings for loss prevention positions require 
the same?  The answer is partly due to the fact that the industry still does 
not have enough degreed candidates to make it a requirement. There are 
few organizations that require a degree, and they struggle to find enough 
qualified candidates to fill their positions.
 The résumé is an important part of the review process because it will 
be the first clue to whether a person qualifies for the position. A loss pre­
vention résumé is not much different from others, but depending on the 
position, you will be looking for specific information (Figure 12.1).
EMPLOYEE SELECTION
As part of this chapter, I solicited the help of Gene Smith, president of the 
Loss Prevention Foundation, a not-for-profit organization charged with 
the responsibility of administering the retail loss prevention industry’s 
certification and membership programs. Prior to joining LPF, Smith was 
the president of Downing & Downing, North America’s largest executive 
search and consulting firm specializing in providing human resource 
solutions for retail loss prevention, safety, and audit. During his 15-plus 
years with the firm, he was involved in conducting assessment interviews 
and career counseling with thousands of industry associates. Smith was 
also involved in conducting many industry organizational reviews dur­
ing his tenure. Previous to that, Smith spent 12 years in the retail loss 
prevention industry.  Smith was involved with selecting the right loss 
prevention candidate for years during his position as president of a lead­
ing loss prevention recruiting and consulting firm. He knows what top 
loss prevention executives are looking for and what they reject, and he 
identified the key areas of consideration when searching for candidates, 
beginning with the selection process. Employers must know what their 
needs are, specifically. Simply knowing you need to add head count in 
your department is not good enough. Every department within an orga-
nization needs specifics, and loss prevention is not any different. Identify 
whether you need the following:
•	 Investigators
•	 Communicators
•	 Analyzers
•	 A person with a specific profile

•	 Cultural fit
•	 A person who offsets your own weaknesses
•	 A person who complements your strengths
You can define whom you need through an organizational assess­
ment. Once you have determined the type of person you need, it is time 
to move on to identifying how you will attract that person. Simply post­
ing a job description might not be enough to get the ideal candidate. Your 
goal should always be to hire the best available candidate, not just a good 
candidate. You will want to use all the resources available to find the best 
person. Your main objective will be to conduct a thorough search because 
you owe it to yourself and the organization. Settling on the first person 
who looks good is the wrong approach. Your initial focus should be on 
identifying “A” players, both as candidates and as sources for referrals. 
Once you identify an “A” player then they will recommend “A” players 
to you. Reputation in the industry is also important to attract the good 
prospects. “A” players want to be affiliated with other “A” players who 
are reputable, not with people or organizations who have a poor reputa­
tion. Smith identified five areas that need to be tapped for proper recruit­
ing to occur:
	
1.	Networking
	
2.	Employee referrals
	
3.	Job boards
	
4.	Internal recruiters
	
5.	External recruiters
NETWORKING
Loss prevention professionals know other people in loss prevention who 
may be willing to fill your position. This is a good way to get candidates 
because you will most likely not be referred to someone who is not up to 
par. People making the recommendation to you do not want to be looked 
at negatively for sending less than quality candidates over to you; there-
fore, their own reputation is on the line. Because they have a stake in it, 
they will send you only people they know are good. The issue with only 
networking during the recruiting process is that the people with whom 
you are networking are limited in accessing talent. They will know only 
what surrounds them and nothing else. It is a good way to start, but it 
cannot be the only way.

219

EMPLOYEE REFERRALS
As with recommendations from networking individuals, employees 
put their reputation on the line,—even more so than networking people 
because they will deal with you and your complaints daily if the person 
is not any good. The employee referral may come from within your own 
department or outside of your department. This is a trusted way to get 
quality candidates because the stakes are high. Employees who refer some­
one else know they deal with the aftermath if the person they referred 
costs the organization unnecessary money or time. Unlike the networking 
referral, employees who refer will also have to answer to the organization 
when the cat is out of the bag that they sent in a lemon. This is also a good 
start, but the downfall with employee referrals, again, is that they do not 
have access to that many people, and if they are outside of the loss preven­
tion department they might not know the specifics of who is needed.
JOB BULLETIN BOARDS — E-RECRUITING
Most organizations today use e-recruiting. This is definitely one of the 
most widely used ways to recruit candidates for any business. There are 
even Web sites allocated to specifically posting loss prevention jobs, such 
as lpjobs.com. E-recruiting will reach the most people with the littlest 
effort. Your diamond is hiding among the hundred others you will prob­
ably never consider, but it will be work to uncover the diamond. Because 
e-recruiting reaches so many people, the response to job postings will be 
enormous. Even if your posting is very specific, such as a minimum of 5 
years’ multistore experience, many will test their luck to see if you might 
not notice they have only 5 months’ experience as a single-store loss pre-
vention person. Now it will be your job to weed through all the people 
you do not want to select the ones you will consider interviewing. Unlike 
networking and employee referrals, no one else has a stake in the process; 
therefore, you are relying on only your own skills to identify candidates.
INTERNAL RECRUITERS
A good rule of thumb is to start with the e-recruiting and let the organi-
zation’s internal recruiters narrow the scope. These groups of individu-
als find candidates every day for all departments, and they know what 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
220

they are doing. However, it is important to spend some time with them to 
make sure they know the specific expectations of loss prevention candi­
dates. They are trained to look for large gaps in employment, short stays 
at other employers, and other key determinants that tell you how this per­
son behaved in the past. Unfortunately, this is often where their expertise 
stops. Because we are a group of unique individuals whose careers focus 
on persuasion and influence, prospective candidates can snow unsuspect­
ing internal recruiters. I remember this happening when I was recruiting 
for a regional loss prevention position. The pool had been narrowed down 
to about five final candidates. At this point, only the internal recruiters—
no one in loss prevention—had spoken to any of the candidates. We also 
had a recap from the recruiter on his thoughts regarding each and every 
person. The final five were all qualified and could do the job according 
to the recruiter, and it was easy to tell which of the five he favored more. 
I spoke to one of the “favorites” during a phone interview. This is one 
individual who snowed the recruiter in some way. The individual was 
responsible for two flagship stores, extremely high volume, in a metropol­
itan area. This person spoke all the loss prevention jargon and knew what 
organizations were looking for. However, because the position entailed 
loss prevention responsibility for nearly 250 locations, I was more con­
cerned about time management and prioritization skills than anything 
else. I knew that the ideal candidate would need to know how to properly 
prioritize his or her time and indirectly influence a large group of people 
to produce the desired results. I also knew that a person who is respon­
sible for two locations, regardless of volume, may not have the experience 
necessary to manage such a high number of locations. This is where I 
focused the interview. I asked the candidate his approach to managing 
loss prevention for 250 locations and having positive results for the loca-
tions. This is the paraphrased answer I got:
I plan to get up real early and work really long days so I can get to all 
of them.
That took care of the entire interview for me. This person knew how 
to effectively manage two locations because he went from one store to 
another and had direct contact daily with both. This person had no idea 
how to manage a vast number of locations without having daily involve-
ment in any. The recruiter missed this for some reason. If you are using an 
internal recruiter, make sure the person is specifically trained on recruit-
ing for loss prevention and understands the business of loss prevention.

EXTERNAL RECRUITER
There is no startup time with external recruiters because they know the 
industry. They can easily sift through the minutiae and see where the 
cream rises to the top. They can also identify passive candidates and con­
nect the dots where others falter. Where they are most handy is in getting 
to the A players who are not currently looking for a job but who will listen 
to an opportunity. These are the people who are not surfing the job boards 
and are not known by your specific networking affiliate but who could be 
the best candidate. External recruiters are probably the easiest and quick­
est way to find the best pool of candidates, but as with the others the catch 
with this one is cost. The other four ways are relatively inexpensive, but 
external recruiters will definitely cost you. There are two different types 
of arrangements, contingent and retainer:
•	 Contingent arrangements: You do not pay the search firm anything 
unless you hire the person. The amount is based on a percentage 
of the salary. The current industry average is 20% of the first year’s 
salary. Within the contingent confines, there are also two more 
specific arrangements, which are exclusive and nonexclusive.
•	 Exclusive: You give your search to only one search firm and 
no others.
•	 Nonexclusive: You give your search to multiple firms for 
competition.
•	 Retainer agreements: The search firm manages the entire search 
to include all candidates from all resources. You will usually pay 
50% up front and 50% when it is completed. With the retainer 
agreement, the search firm wants to be guaranteed for its time 
because there is more work involved but also provides you with 
a guarantee as well. The current industry standard is that if the 
person does not work out within the first 90 days, the search firm 
will find a new replacement for free.
One point that Smith emphasized in this section is that you are not 
hiring just to hire. You are making a financial investment in someone. This 
is a total financial investment, including salary, bonus, car, training, ben-
efits, and cost of ineffectiveness of transitioning into the new position dur-
ing the learning curve. The financial obligation is about triple the salary.
Smith went on to discuss selecting the right candidate. The recruiting 
techniques will generate résumé flow, and that is what you need. The next 
step is to properly develop a screening process. It must be determined

222

who will weed through the résumés. It should not be just a human 
resources (HR) clerk. It should be a higher-level loss prevention person 
who has hired successfully before, partnering with a HR person who also 
has hired for LP before. There are not perfect candidates. You want some­
one who meets as many requirements as possible. The analogy Smith 
used is that it is like going fishing in a pond. At the end of the day, you 
have pulled out the best and can throw back the ones that are not good 
enough. The screening process objective is to narrow the search to three 
or four candidates. One point noteworthy for this part is that you do not 
want to let the speed of filling a position impact who you will hire. Many 
organizations, including loss prevention departments, fall victim to the 
speedy hire. This is most recognized during times when the projection 
for solid sales begins to decrease. If a department feels like a hiring freeze 
is approaching, the first person qualified will be grabbed so the position 
is not lost. The best approach is not to have a timeline. Only hire the best 
when you are convinced you have found the best available.
Part of the screening process is to do assessments such as the following:
•	 Psychological
•	 Personality
•	 Cultural
•	 Aptitude
Performing these types of assessments will help select the best. This 
will also eliminate the people who do not pass and cannot move further 
in the process. Next, you will need to conduct some initial employment 
reference checks. Employment reference checks can be one of the most 
effective ways of judging someone’s long-term success. You will also want 
to do some initial interviews. Make sure you have already established the 
interview process and that the panel of interviewers knows exactly what 
you are looking for. Ensure that all interviewers on the panel know they 
are there to judge personality and cultural fit, not technical competencies. 
When it comes to technical skills, people are more reluctant to lie about 
that. For instance, if you ask someone how to derive specific equations in 
Excel and they give some ridiculous answer, you know they are not famil-
iar with Excel in the way you need them to be. People are reluctant to lie 
about technical skills that are required because they will be called onto 
the carpet quickly about it. A candidate is less likely to lie about having 
computer skills required for a potential job because the individual knows 
he or she will not be able to perform the job once it starts. On the other 
hand, candidates often lie about getting along with people and about 

S electing the Best for Your Loss Prevention Department
223

their personal behavior. When candidates are asked if they are a “people 
person,” many will say yes because this topic is subject to interpretation 
and technical skills are not. They could interpret being a people person as 
their ability to verbally communicate in an appropriate manner, and your 
interpretation of a people person may be that someone who gets along 
with others is an extrovert. Personality will often come out during a face-
to-face interview. A wise person once told me that to truly understand 
candidates, take them to a restaurant for their interview. I was curious 
about picking a restaurant as the venue, and the person described the fol­
lowing scenario:
When you take people to a restaurant you can see how they truly behave if something is 
not right. Therefore, you want to make sure something is a little wrong with their meal. 
Maybe it is too cold or dry—something just needs to be wrong. Now you sit back and 
watch what they do. If they do nothing and just accept what is wrong, you know they do not 
like conflict and let things slide. If they are upset and approach the server in a rude manner, 
you know they have problems with self-control. If they complain about it but do nothing 
else, you know they are ineffective in addressing problems. What you want to happen is 
that they recognize something is incorrect and let you know there is something wrong. 
When the server comes back, in a very professional manner, they describe the problem: 
“Excuse me, I ordered a salad without blue cheese and this one has blue cheese.” You also 
want them to provide the server with the solution: “Can you please take this one back 
and bring one out that does not have blue cheese?” Now you know that they will attack a 
problem head on, inform you about it, and have the solution ready to go. I cannot say from 
personal experience if this works or not for getting the best candidate, but theoretically 
it seems like it might. 
Another great screening tool is to tour a few stores to see how they greet the store 
associates and if they help find service for customers. See if they see the same control 
deficiences that you see. Ask them what they normally would do on a store visit.
The interview process is the most ineffective way to hire someone if 
you judge someone only on the way they interviewed, according to Smith. 
When looking to hire someone, you must look at all the components. It is 
much better to know who that person worked for in the past and what the 
employer thought about the person. One question to ask yourself is if you 
are hiring for show or hiring for go. That means that some candidates will 
absolutely floor you with their professional appearance and demeanor, 
but that does not mean they will perform well if hired. The most impor-
tant factor cannot be that one person interviewed better than the other 
person. Part of the process is knowing the programs they have worked in 
and people they have worked for. If you need someone to be in charge of 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
224

a specific area, such as supply chain, ensure that the person has worked 
in some kind of supply chain capacity in the past. Do not base your entire 
opinion of the person on the interview; rather, use it as one component of 
making the choice.
For the interview process, questions and answers are often used. To 
some degree they work, but that is not how effective interviews are con­
ducted. Think back to past or present times of interviewing employees 
for dishonesty. There is a script, but you know what happens if all you 
do is read it in a question or answer format. The admission is much more 
difficult to get or may never come. The most effective interviewers use a 
conversational approach to reach the admission, and the same should be 
true for interviewing employment candidates. You want to get to know 
the person so he or she can open up to you. Smith believes that the inter­
view process is like unwrapping a gift. Your challenge is to properly 
unwrap the gift piece by piece so you can get to what you want on the 
inside. The key is to ask a few questions and get the person to talk so you 
can listen. At the end of the interview, you must do additional reference 
checks. You also want to do face-to-face interviews as opposed to only 
phone interviews.
As for the additional reference checks, you do not want to eliminate 
someone based on one bad reference. There are many people who will 
give unfavorable references for anyone who left the organization. You do 
not want to access a person’s background more than you do the person. 
One item you are trying to assess is where the interviewees are in their 
life. Those who are involved in personal issues are more likely to have 
performance issues at work. It’s not to say that every person is the same 
and handles stress in the same manner, but personal problems often com­
plicate any new endeavor.  You will most likely find out about the personal 
issues if you conduct the interview properly. Even if this person’s skill set 
far exceeds the other candidates’, personal issues coupled with starting a 
new job can be a recipe for disaster. Someone’s personal situation is the 
most accurate indicator of how he or she will perform in the immediate 
future. If there is nothing weighing on the person, all focus will be on the 
new job. If personal issues such as divorce or a death in the family are 
present, the new job will have to share time with the preexisting personal 
issues, which cannot be shed. You cannot have a person’s undivided atten-
tion even though the candidate might think he or she is able to give 100%. 
You need to figure out if the person is able to do the job and is willing to 
do the job.

Hiring a person for loss prevention can be difficult, but with some 
effort the payoff can be great. Take your time and use all the resources 
available to uncover the best talent available. Remember, as stated a few 
pages back, 
•	 don’t rush your decision because you foresee a hiring freeze, lest 
you be stuck with someone who is unqualified or doesn’t fit in,
•	 having a bad employee is worse than having no employee,
•	 don’t skip out on conducting the reference checks and doing your 
homework about individuals. 
An individual’s past is a predictor of your future. If they could not make it 
to work on time for the last 5 years, do not think they have had a miracu­
lous epiphany that makes them go to work on time in your organization? 
Use the skills you have learned as a trained interviewer on the person you 
want to hire and look for the red flags. Do not put all of your eggs in one 
basket because a person has a great-looking résumé. You want to make 
sure that you actually like the individual as a person and can work with 
the person.
Effectiveness
As with many jobs, some individuals shine while others are just getting 
by. To be effective as a loss prevention professional, it takes personality, 
knowledge, skills, and commitment. Unlike some other types of profes­
sions, those in loss prevention who are squeaking by stick out like a sore 
thumb because of their statistics and lack of accomplishments. Those who 
are shining have the numbers and accomplishments to show for it.
As I was just beginning my career in loss prevention, I was required 
to hire store detectives. The entire hiring process was new to me, let alone 
the fact that I had to make sure the new hires could catch shoplifters to 
keep the position. Because the store had good numbers going in, I was 
allowed to hire two part-time store detectives. I recruited at a local univer-
sity by placing ads on the job board. After many interviews, I selected two 
male students who were in their senior year of college. One of them was 
going into elementary education, and the other had an internship with the 
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) after he completed a few more classes. 
As much as I knew that stereotyping shoplifters did not work, I did not 
use that same knowledge when it came to who I hired. I thought for sure 
that the person going into the CIA would excel and would run circles

around the store detective planning on becoming an elementary school 
teacher. I could not have been more wrong.
I trained both of them the same way I was trained. I spent many hours 
walking the floor with them together and individually. After I turned 
them loose, I was amazed at what I saw. Within the first few days of being 
alone, the soon to be schoolteacher was competing with my numbers. 
Every morning when I came in and he had worked the night before, there 
would be incident reports on the desk. Some of the items that were taken 
were so small that I wondered how he was able to see the concealment. 
You must also remember that these were the days without cameras. The 
only tools we had were our eyes and our sense of wrongdoing. The nights 
that the CIA store detective worked, there were no incident reports on 
the desk in the morning. I could sense the frustration from the CIA store 
detective when we spoke. He was frustrated because he was not catch­
ing anyone. Because of the hours I had available, I could not overlap that 
much with either of them, but because the numbers were not good for one, 
I had to start overlapping at least 2 hours so I could see what the problem 
was. Together we were able to catch shoplifters, but by himself the CIA 
candidate did not work very well. The schoolteacher’s numbers continued 
to climb, which made the CIA detective even more frustrated. It did not 
seem to matter how much time I spent with him—his numbers did not 
come close to the schoolteacher’s numbers. This lasted about a year until 
they both graduated. The schoolteacher would come back and work dur­
ing holidays and some of the summer, but I never heard from the CIA 
person again.
As I began to analyze the differences between the two, I started to 
understand why one did better than the other. The schoolteacher had no 
expectations coming in other than that he wanted to do a good job and 
make some money to help pay for college. He was footing the bill him-
self, with no help from anyone. The CIA individual came in expecting to 
do well because he assumed his criminal justice degree would somehow 
help him catch shoplifters. He was not paying anything for college; rather, 
his parents were paying for everything. He took the job because it was 
related to his field and thought it would be fun. The schoolteacher was 
a very humble individual who was very friendly and genuine. The CIA 
store detective had a fairly large ego, was social but not overly friendly, 
and seemed to have an agenda. I remember him discussing the school-
teacher’s numbers with me and being disappointed that he was catch-
ing that many. He never saw the effort as joint and team related. He was 

S electing the Best for Your Loss Prevention Department
227

mostly disappointed at the fact that someone in a field such as elementary 
education could outdo him.
Because I was so new in the world of loss prevention and having 
direct reports, I did not address issues such as teamwork or the effort 
of catching shoplifters as collective as opposed to individual. I simply 
trained, retrained, and trained again in the hopes that he would come 
around. I also did not address the preconceived notion of who he thought 
he was and would be in this role. As the years went on and I continued to 
have direct reports in the same organization and different organizations, 
I thought about these two people and their behavior. I also realized where 
I went wrong in not addressing the behavior that helped contribute to the 
CIA detective being unsuccessful. I also watched others whom I worked 
with over the years exhibit some of the same behaviors as both the CIA 
detective and the schoolteacher. Loss prevention people who were more 
similar to the schoolteacher often were more successful than ones who 
were similar to the CIA detective.
PERSONALITY
People in retail loss prevention cannot reduce shrinkage alone; they 
must rely on those whom they work with to be involved. Because of this, 
personality plays a part in whether the person will be successful. Loss 
prevention people must be able to influence and persuade others to do 
what is necessary to prevent losses. They must also be able to do it well 
enough that the results can be sustained. If their efforts revolve around 
fear and intimidation, the results will not be sustained and other prob­
lems will arise. For someone to effectively influence or persuade others 
to do something, that person must be respected and trusted. To gain 
respect and trust from others there must be some sort of relationship 
between the people.
The loss prevention people who are effective in reducing shrink-
age take the time to build relationships, earn trust, and give respect 
to those whom they work with. They do not expect that people will 
respect and trust them because of their position; rather, they know that 
it will come over time and with effort. They know that they need not 
act as a know-it-all to boost their ego but project their level of compe-
tence through the training they conduct to make others loss preven-
tion conscious. They understand that the goal is to get the people to a 
level of commitment with loss prevention initiatives, not to make them 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
228
© 2011 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC
compliant to what they are told to do. They understand that they are 
one small part of the bigger equation and that their collective contri­
butions help better the organization. They will share their knowledge 
and information with anyone who is willing to listen and not hoard 
valuable information for the fear that someone might be able to move 
ahead of them with it. They conduct themselves with the utmost pro­
fessional behavior, which is reflected through their communication, 
appearance, and persona. They believe that all employees bring value 
to the organization and have something to contribute. They train oth­
ers in a manner that makes things right, not in a way that points out 
everything that is wrong. They celebrate what is right and good and 
find clever ways to correct the wrongs. They live their life as they do 
their work; there are no variations from doing the right thing all the 
time. They work hard because that is what they were hired to do, and 
they do not allow their personal agenda to drive their behavior. The 
loss prevention people who are effective are those who you want to sit 
in a room with to have a discussion, not those whom you cannot wait 
to leave the room.
KNOWLEDGE
Unfortunately, loss prevention is not a profession you can wing. You have 
to have knowledge to successfully do the job. Because many of us start out 
catching shoplifters, we gain the knowledge regarding human behavior 
rather quickly, which will be used throughout our careers for detecting 
dishonesty. We learn early on that anyone is capable of anything. Those 
who do not work in the profession will often dismiss suspicions based on 
who the person is, whereas we know that it makes no difference who it 
is because anyone can do it. We learn that people’s personal lives make a 
difference in their work decisions and that those decisions can negatively 
impact the organization. Those who are effective are always trying to gain 
new knowledge, understanding that it is a never-ending process.
Aside from human behavior, knowledge on organizational systems 
and policies also helps aid in the success. Those who are successful take 
the time to learn the systems such as the point-of-sale (POS) system. 
They understand that to quickly detect dishonesty they must know what 
is wrong and what is right. They will know the systems as well as the 
employees who run the registers.

They will also keep themselves abreast of any new information that 
has come out. For instance, if there is a change to the employee purchase of 
merchandise policy, such as a limitation or reduction in percentage, they 
will know that the policy changed. To keep this information organized, 
a binder of valuable information should be kept. The binder should have 
copies of documents that pertain to loss prevention as well as changes to 
policies that were issued. The binder is good to have when employees say 
they were not aware of that; then, the document can be pulled out and 
shown that it was indeed sent to the store.
The knowledge of effective loss prevention persons does not end 
within their own organization. They are also aware of issues affecting 
loss prevention outside of their own organization. They keep themselves 
apprised of any new legislation affecting their line of work and communi­
cate the information to the appropriate people.
SKILLS
Within the profession of loss prevention, certain skills need to be mas­
tered. Two of those skills are auditing and investigations. From store level 
to the director level, auditing and investigating will be the biggest portion 
of the job requirement. The goal of auditing is to uncover any fraudulent 
activity or correct training issues. To properly audit, one must understand 
all the questions on the audit and know how to get to the information. For 
beginners, it best to have a paper copy of the audit and how to get to all the 
information written underneath all the questions. If a question pertains 
to a specific policy, the effective loss prevention people will have a copy 
of the policy to refer to. One important part to auditing is the recap that 
is sent out to the necessary parties. Most executives will not go through 
an audit question by question; rather, they are looking for the high-level 
overview of what was found during the audit. Being able to properly write 
the audit recap is critical in being effective. Doing the audit is half the job; 
the other half is to effectively report the findings so others can take action. 
Those who try to rush the audit recap process will often come across as 
incompetent because others will recognize they did not take the time to 
review the entire audit. The effective individual will also take the time to 
explain the audit findings to the person who is responsible to fix it. If it 
is the store manager, they will be given a verbal recap of the audit and a 
printed version prior to the departure of the auditor. The effective person 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
230
© 2011 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC
will also help find solutions to issues that came up during the audit, not 
only present the opportunities. It must be certain that the person in charge 
fully understands what is required to correct the deficiencies.
The other skill to master is investigating. From finding the needle in 
the haystack to getting the person to admit to wrongdoing, investigations 
are a part of everyday life in loss prevention. It is not uncommon for loss 
prevention people to have better interview skills than law enforcement. 
The effective loss prevention person will take the time to develop their 
case. They will research any and all avenues where misappropriation 
could have taken place. They will be able to decipher a training issue from 
a dishonesty issue before they ever talk to the employee. They will be able 
to review documents during an investigation and know exactly what does 
not make sense even though the manager provides a logical explanation. 
They will discuss the person or persons involved, including their appli­
cation and work behavior with their direct supervisor. They will be able 
to predict the lies that will be told and already have a rebuttal waiting 
before the investigative interview begins. During the interview they will 
project a level of confidence unlike anything the employee has seen before 
because they have left no stone unturned. The denials from the intervie­
wee will be met with strict resistance, and the only conversation that will 
continue is the admission of guilt.
Effective persons will be able to extract all dishonesty that has hap­
pened at their organization through conversation with employees and 
management, not only the dishonesty detected through investigative 
techniques. They will be able to get employees to provide a statement that 
implicates them in wrongdoing and either provide a promissory note or 
hand off an airtight package to law enforcement for prosecution.
Being an effective communicator is also part of the role of effective 
loss prevention personnel. They are often asked to conduct training ses-
sions or present on a topic related to loss prevention. How they relay the 
message is as important as the message itself. They have to display con-
viction and passion for the topic in addition to showing their knowledge 
of the subject matter. Effective persons will leave the audience wanting to 
know more and excited about loss prevention.
Effective loss prevention people are well-rounded individuals who 
possess the necessary skills to do the job. They continue to sharpen their 
skills through individualized training and take responsibility for devel-
oping their own skills further.

COMMITMENT
People who work on a factory assembly line do the same thing every day. 
Their requirement is to attach one piece to another and to ensure it makes 
it to where it is supposed to go. Their commitment, or lack thereof, may be 
noticed during the workday. Loss prevention people are doing something 
different every day. Each day holds a new and daunting task to tackle 
to safeguard the assets of the organization. When loss prevention people 
“check out,” it is easy to notice. The effective person’s commitment to the 
job will be evident. Each case is evaluated carefully to ensure key learn­
ing points are extracted not only to rectify the immediate issues but also 
to prevent future incidents from occurring. Loss prevention people who 
are fully committed are never really off the clock. They think about their 
work every day, and most people around them will know more about the 
profession of loss prevention than any other topic. Effective people are 
proud to work in the field of loss prevention and will do what it takes to 
get the job done. Effective people will not have a scope that is narrow; their 
scope will be wide enough to influence all risks and threats that affect the 
organization they work for. Their level of commitment does not end at 
their day-to-day functions but continues in understanding the big picture 
of the organizational challenges. Effective persons will be involved with 
more than just their own job and will extend themselves further to learn 
all they can about loss prevention.
REVIEW THE APPLICATION AND 
ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS
Searching for the right person who has the personality, knowledge, skills, 
and commitment for loss prevention is very complex and demanding. Use 
the physical details of the application for employment to identify ques-
tions that should be asked during candidates’ interview. Review the appli-
cation that candidates fill out against the résumé. Believe it or not, I have 
seen applications that do not match the résumé information, even when 
candidates had access to the résumé while filling out the application. You 
might catch contradictions in educational information, the type of degree, 
or years attending a school. You might catch contradictions in the years 
that the candidate worked at previous employers. Look at every line and 
see if it makes sense.

Some very common-sense lines on the application for employment 
that should be filled out will really help you understand that level of 
commitment. Is the candidate willing to travel? Relocate? Does the candi­
date want full-time employment? All these questions are very important 
but often get glossed over and may result in a big surprise after hiring 
a regional manager who does not want to travel or expects 10% travel 
instead of the position requirement of 75% travel. Most applications have 
questions on eligibility to work in the United States. Most applications 
also ask the question, “Have you ever been convicted of a crime other 
than a minor traffic offense?” These are questions that might be left unan­
swered, and that is more a problem than answering yes. The truth about 
employment eligibility and background records can be evaluated; omis­
sions could mean that the candidate has something to hide and should be 
verbally addressed in an interview before employment.
Look at the work experience section of the application to evaluate the 
dates employed. Are there gaps in employment history? Those may be a 
sign of unemployment or a sign of institutionalization. Explore any gaps 
in the interview as well as omissions of information about the employ­
ers or reasons for leaving the last employer during the interview. Is there 
enough information about the educational institutions to actually verify 
the level attained? Perhaps the most important lines on the applications 
are the signature lines after the statement of accuracy and the drug-free 
workplace statement. Leaving these lines unsigned and undated could 
be a subconscious message that applicants are not comfortable with what 
they would fill in on the application. By all means, ask them to sign those 
lines when they are attending the interview and see how they react to 
that request. Another thing that makes me reconsider candidates is that 
errors and omissions on the applications speak to their level of detail and 
persistence. These are just a few things that I look for; I am sure there are 
more that I have missed.
Once you get to the interview, there are lawful inquiries and unlaw-
ful inquiries that the interviewer must be aware of.  Lawful inquiries that 
may be asked of a candidate include the following:

This is a fairly comprehensive list of what questions are allowable. During 
the interview a large part of the line of questioning should be directed at 
the skill level of the candidate on critical thinking and problem solving, 
teamwork, motivation, and leadership skills. If the questions do not sound 
right or seem risky, it is best to check with your associate relations depart­
ment or recruiter for advice.
GETTING TO THE NEXT LEVEL
Because retail loss prevention is so specific, the competition for high-
ranking positions is fierce. The competition is high not only within the 
industry but also in the organization. Also, because of the nature of the 
people who are in loss prevention, striving to be better than the next per­
son is never-ending. Again, with limited high-level positions, only so 
many people can move to the top. To get where you want to be, there are 
many things to consider. For some expertise in this area, I again solicited 
the knowledge of Gene Smith. Smith has made it to a level that many loss 
prevention people aspire to be, but it did not come easy. Smith has had 
contact with almost every high-ranked loss prevention executive in the 
nation and knows what it takes to move up in the industry. He provided a 
five-step process for loss prevention people to follow if they want to move 
up in the industry:
	
1.	Goal setting
	
2.	Self-discovery
	
3.	Find a mentor
	
4.	Implement career plan
	
5.	Readjustment
Goal Setting
Once you decide that loss prevention is your career, develop a career plan 
of how far you think you can go. The career plan that defines your goals 
needs to be done in a formal planning process, not a cliché. You will want 
to get job descriptions for the jobs you want to aspire to. The descriptions 
will give you a better understanding of whether you possess the basic 
skills required for the job. If you are lacking in some areas, the career plan 
should encompass gaining the knowledge you need for the position. The

career plan should also be broken down into reasonable amounts of time. 
Most career plans will have several years of achievements that need to be 
met. An example of a career plan is as follows:

This plan is inclusive and focuses on a very specific goal, which is to 
get promoted. Some people in the field of loss prevention are very con-
tent with their current position and just want to do the best they can with 
their existing role. If that is the case, the career development plan should 
focus on enhancing the current role and becoming the best. During the 
next phase, self-discovery, you will know if your career development 
plan is a realistic snapshot of what you can achieve or if it is a wishlist 
of items.

Self-Discovery
Looking deep down into one’s psyche can be a revelation like no other. 
Many of us want certain things in life, but they are not always achievable. 
College athletes may have the drive and desire to play professional sports, 
but their ability may not allow them to. A person with advanced degrees 
in business may want to become a chief executive officer for an organiza­
tion, but the person’s leadership skills may never allow that. It is no differ­
ent with the profession of loss prevention. For many, catching shoplifters 
is the beginning stage of developing an ability to grow with the profession 
of loss prevention. Some of us probably excelled in shoplifter apprehend­
ing, but that does not mean we are all cut out to become directors of loss 
prevention in the future. Your career may not blossom in the manner you 
anticipated for various reasons, even some that are out of your own con­
trol. It is no secret that being able to relocate in the field of loss prevention 
allows you to advance quicker than others who are not.
If you are in metropolitan areas such as New York, Chicago, and Los 
Angeles, relocating may not be necessary. There are many higher-level 
loss prevention positions available in large metropolitan areas where cor­
porate offices of retail businesses thrive. However, if you are in Omaha, 
Fargo, or Chattanooga, things might be different. It is not uncommon to 
have field people based in different parts of the country, but corporate 
positions, including director and vice president, usually require reloca­
tion to the corporate office
At present, the work–life balance is very important in corporate life. 
If family and friends are very important to a candidate for advancement, 
making a choice that is prudent for family and friends will be necessary. 
Weigh all the alternatives to transferring around for promotions, and 
involve family and friends to the extent that their opinions are valuable to 
the decision-making process.
Loss prevention professionals must understand if their skill set and 
personality will allow them to soar past all their competition. A good rule 
of thumb is to get a job description of where you want to go. Many organi-
zations today are looking for college degrees as a requirement for regional 
loss prevention manager positions and above. If you do not have a college 
degree, consider working for the degree at one of the community colleges 
with flexible hours and computer classes. Consider tuition reimbursement 
with negotiating employment packages to make it definitely achievable. 
Consider networking, and ask experts in the field of loss prevention what 
they did to be successful to get where they are. After they describe their 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
238
© 2011 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC
journey to you, think of ways to adopt some of their methods for success 
into your own development plan.
During the self-discovery process, one should assess their own 
strengths and weaknesses in order to determine which position is most 
suitable and to develop long term career goals accurately. A full under­
standing of where you are in your own skill sets, knowledge of the 
business, and overall standing in the community of loss prevention is 
paramount in moving ahead. Although this may be self-discovery, a clear 
understanding of what others think of you is important as well.
Find a Mentor
Every organization has a mentoring process. Finding the best mentors and 
being careful of the motives of the individual offering to mentor you are 
important. If the person you are considering to ask to be your mentor is 
anything less than admirable and of high integrity, keep up the search until 
you find the right person. Because loss prevention is so competitive, lead­
ers understand they can stand out in a crowd if they have developed a peer 
or subordinate to be ready to advance. Mentoring another is an accepted 
way for companies to polish and develop their managers with potential.
Selection Process
It may be easier to identify a mentor in your own organization because 
they are more accessible, but going outside of the organization can be 
advantageous. If selecting someone in your organization, make sure the 
person knows the culture and the organizational structure. Other assets 
to look for in the person you select for a mentor are the person’s business 
acumen. Is the individual able to navigate the office politics and still come 
across as approachable and open to discussion? It is not a bad thing to 
find a leader who is nurturing. Mentors should not be expected to develop 
you into an excellent specimen of a promotable superstar. They will not 
be doing all the work; you will. They are there to listen well and act as a 
sounding board to your thoughts about the business and your develop-
ment plans. They may give advice, but experiences prove those who listen 
best and let the mentee make some mistakes and take some risks are best 
and most appreciated.
When selecting your mentor, it could be someone you like as a per-
son and have some type of chemistry with. You will need to feel that this 
person has a vested interest in your success and is not just going through 

S electing the Best for Your Loss Prevention Department
239
© 2011 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC
the motions. This person will also need to ensure that he or she has the 
time to mentor you. One thing to remember is that great mentors love to 
be copied. They do not hoard their knowledge in fear that someone will 
surpass them. You are also looking for someone who loves to educate, 
teaches why things are done (the thought process behind the action), and 
uses logic to solve problems. This person will discuss possible solutions 
but will not give you the solution. By discussing the possible solutions 
and not giving away the answer, this person teaches you how to effec­
tively solve problems.
Just keep in mind the ideal person may not be in loss prevention. If 
you want to further develop your leadership skills, selecting a mentor out­
side of loss prevention but still in retail may be the way to go.
Implementing Your Career Plan
You have to invest in your career plan with sweat equity. You will want 
to volunteer to go the extra mile and take on some special projects. One 
alternative is to read business books and leadership books, even if you do 
not put that on your career development plan. The derived benefit will be 
understanding the bigger business picture. Many loss prevention people 
believe that just because they have the highest statistics in the department 
they should be promoted. This is in practice—usually not what happens.
Smith believes it is not important to be the best shoplifter apprehender; 
it is more important to be able to hire and lead the best shoplifter appre­
hender. He went on to say that some of the best coaches in professional 
sports were average players. It takes a lot more than technical skills to get 
ahead. It takes the ability to understand what is required for the job and 
the ability to communicate and persuade others. What many newly pro­
moted leaders find out once they achieve the dream of an executive-level 
position in the field of loss prevention is that technical skills are ironically 
enough required less and less. The loss prevention executives function-
ing in each organization are executives overseeing a specific department. 
They are not much different from the executives leading marketing, train-
ing and development, or operations. Their main function is to ensure the 
success of the department through the work of their subordinates. That 
being said, their ability to lead others surpasses their need for specific 
technical skills.
You always want to have an updated résumé available. You never know 
what phone call you will receive from a recruiter or old friend, when you 
will need to send one out right away. Your career development plan may 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
240
© 2011 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC
outline all of the things necessary for you to get where you want to go, but 
your current organization may not be able to accommodate the plan. If your 
career development plan is done effectively, it may lead you out of your 
current organization and into the arms of another organization that can 
embrace your end result quicker. Smith also believes that what separates 
“A” players from “B” players is that “A” players take ownership for their 
own personal development. They find out what is needed and go for it. 
They invest in their own career with time and money. If part of your career 
development plan calls for seminars on leadership and the company will 
not pay for it, the “A” players will pay for it themselves because they under­
stand that it is necessary.
Readjustment
As we discussed earlier, just because people want something does not 
mean they will get it. The last phase of moving ahead is the readjustment 
process. After you have completed the other four phases, you will need to 
readjust your goals to face reality.
You will readjust goals based upon the following:
•	 Results of self-discovery process
•	 Feedback from mentors
•	 Ability to effectively implement career plan
It is good to go through the readjustment process once every 3 years. 
Goals will also adjust due to the following:
•	 Personal reasons, within self
•	 Family
•	 Changes in organization
People who set out to become loss prevention executives when they 
were single may have to adjust their goals if they get married and start a 
family. At one time they were able to move around or make sacrifices to 
advance with no strings attached. Some husbands and wives will have 
to give their significant other a chance to advance if they have been sup-
ported along the way. This is especially true if both spouses have promis-
ing careers. I have been in this predicament personally, and I know that 
you absolutely cannot allow yourself to overshadow your spouse and put 
your spouse in a place where he or she just goes along to get along. I have 
a saying that I live by: I am not willing to jeopardize my spouse’s career 
to further my own. Countless marriages have been lost to career choices

with one of the people involved with the relationship. The reason for the 
demise is usually that one person did not consult the other and just did 
what suited them. Careers in loss prevention are no different. Individuals 
must weigh all aspects before they can have a clear understanding of how 
far they can go. Once all factors have been considered, you can have an 
updated version based on the compromises you had to make.
MANAGING LOSS PREVENTION PROFESSIONALS
Is managing loss prevention professionals any different from managing 
other employees? The answer is absolutely yes. Most of us are in this field 
because we want to help people and uphold the rules and regulations 
of the organizations, we want to fight for what is right and fair, and we 
want to know that our efforts are recognized through the reduction of 
losses and the removal of dishonest employees. Employees who work in 
a different capacity within the same organization as loss prevention peo­
ple probably think about the aforementioned items but are not employed 
there because of it. Therefore, when it comes to persons supervising a loss 
prevention professional, their ethics, morals, values, and integrity must 
be uncompromising. If the supervisor is willing to bend the rules just a 
little bit, it will immediately be noticed, and a strike will go against that 
person. Unlike the common employee, most loss prevention people will 
not retaliate against their supervisor with theft-related activity, but there 
are exceptions to that as well. Most will simply withhold effort or just 
leave the organization entirely, neither of which is good for the individual 
or the organization.
Many of us owe a lot to people in the field of loss prevention for whom 
we have worked in the past or present. Some have taught us how to catch 
shoplifters, and others were there when we completed our first internal 
investigative interview. Even bad supervisors can teach something, which 
is how not to be like them. Personally, I owe a great deal to loss prevention 
people for whom I have worked and for whom I am currently working. 
Each of the companies for whom I have worked and the individuals to 
whom I have reported have taught me something about loss prevention or 
business that has contributed to my success in this industry.
Millie’s Story
For me, it all started with a loss prevention professional named Ron Holiday. Ron hired 
me as a store detective in 1994. He placed an ad on my college job board, and I replied. I 

Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions﻿
242
© 2011 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC
used the part-time job as a co-op to earn credits for graduation. Ron figured out rather 
quickly that I am pretty competitive, so he used that knowledge to lead me. He would 
leave out his incident reports for all the shoplifters he caught before I arrived to work 
for me to see. This motivated me to want to “outdo” Ron and catch more than him. It 
was a successful night if I had more incident reports on the desk than he did. He would 
also tell me what a great job I was doing and how quickly I caught on to identifing and 
catching shoplifters. Our store became one of the top producers in external theft cases 
in the region, and we were competing with inner-city stores. I remember being so excited 
coming to work each day to see how many shoplifters I could catch and outdo my boss. 
Within the same year that Ron hired me, he also left the organization to take a higher 
position. He recommended me for his position, which I received shortly after his depar­
ture. I used the leadership knowledge that Ron showed me to hire and train my own store 
detectives. I too left incident reports out and had them competing against one another. I 
never lost contact with him and have always consulted him on career decisions that came 
up throughout the years. Ron is the person who started me in this business and showed 
me how to get people to want to work for you. He was never negative, and even when 
I needed correcting he did it in the most diplomatic way. I always wonder if it had been 
someone with poor leadership skills instead of Ron, if I would have stayed in loss preven­
tion. I guess I will never know the answer to that.
I stayed with Kmart about 4 years and then accepted a position with OfficeMax. 
The position I took was that of corporate loss prevention supervisor—a position unlike 
anything I have ever done. I would no longer be involved with catching shoplifters, nor 
would I see the inside of a store very often. The interview process to get the position at 
OfficeMax was nothing less than grueling. I was surprised when they called and offered me 
the position. I later found out that not many store-level loss prevention people transition 
directly into a corporate role without multistore experience. The person who hired me 
at OfficeMax was Will Powell. Will was a well-rounded business professional. He knew 
not only loss prevention but also the intricate workings of the business world. I caught on 
rather quickly to the technical aspects of the corporate world, but I was missing one big 
necessary component: polish. Polish is a term many management people use to describe 
those who have business acumen and communications skills and understand the nuances 
of office politics. I had the biggest problem getting the corporate office employees to do 
what was necessary, like use their badge and not tailgate into the building. Will watched 
my interactions with others and pulled me aside one day. This day changed the course of 
my corporate personality forever. He told me not to be “that bull in a china shop” and that 
corporate employees were not like “the store people.” He went on to say that the corpo-
rate people would tell you that you are the biggest idiot in the form of the friendliest e-mail. 
I was used to a small confined group that I had a lot of control over and did not understand 
how to get thousands on my page. Over the course of time, Will put the polishing touches 
on that were necessary.
After Will left the organization, I began reporting to Don Burkett. Don is a guy that 
you can rely upon for the facts; he is very meticulous and intense. He is probably the best 
systems person I have ever met in my career. Don also did not tolerate poor quality work. 
One of my responsibilities was to write and rewrite policies. I remember turning in some 

S electing the Best for Your Loss Prevention Department
243
© 2011 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC
of those policies, having them marked up in red ink, and returned to me at my cube. This 
was Don’s way of telling me to do it right the first time. After a few times of that, I repeat­
edly proofread my work before I turned it in. Don also taught me that you have to find 
the information you need, because someone is not always there to help. There were dif­
ferent projects I was working on but had little knowledge about. Instead of going to Don, 
I learned to problem-solve myself to get the answers I needed. This was a valuable lesson 
that had worked wonders over the years for my life and career.
I stayed with OfficeMax about 3 years and then accepted a position at my current orga­
nization. I started off as regional loss prevention manager; I did not come with much field 
experience but with a wealth of corporate experience. My learning to play nice with others 
during the OfficeMax years helped me become very successful in building good relation­
ships with my field partners into the future. As with corporate employees, field managers 
are indirectly influenced by loss prevention, and the relationship is one of the most impor­
tant components in making you successful in your position. I was able to get to know my 
new supervisor well over the years and really understand what he stood for.
Bob is one of the most upstanding human beings I have ever met. He attributes a 
portion of his uncompromising integrity to his father-in-law who taught him a valuable 
life lesson. Bob’s father-in-law cashed out at a bowling alley and went to his car. Upon 
entering the car, he noticed that the attendant had given him one dime too many. He 
was afraid that the attendant would be short and get in trouble so he walked back to the 
bowling alley, in the pouring rain, to return the dime. Bob witnessed this event and it set 
the tone of how he would look at life and honesty. Bob’s lesson was that no matter how 
small, doing the right thing is always right. This is how Bob leads his people today. Bob is 
the kind of person you can sit down and chit-chat with and talk about all the things you 
do not like. He will never pretend to go along with something that is wrong because oth­
ers expect it to be done. He does not necessarily agree with you, but he does give you 
the chance to state your case. And when he does not agree, he tells you how he would 
do it and you can decide for yourself if that is the route you want to take. The autonomy 
he gives his people allows them to achieve their very best. No one is afraid to take risks 
in his group, and he always supports initiatives. People are never shot down or discour­
aged, no matter how silly it may seem. Bob’s lesson to me is that loss prevention people 
must live their life like they live their career. It is not good practice to pretend to have 
uncompromising integrity whiile at work but, when you are in a setting that isn’t work 
related, your ethics are non-existent. They will be halted at the thumb of their supervi-
sor. Encouraging loss prevention people to take risks without the fear of failure will allow 
them to strive for greatness.
I have been very fortunate in my career all along the way. Each and every person who 
has supervised me has instilled one thing or another. Each is unique in his or her own way 
and had a strength I needed to develop. Each invested the time to develop me to exceed 
the role and further my career. I know not everyone will be this fortunate, but I am sure 
there are supervisors out there like Ron, Will, Don, and Bob. Take time to learn them and 
extract the good parts. No supervisor will have every leadership skill, technical knowl-
edge, or personality to suit everyone, but all may have one or two traits that prove to be 
beneficial for you.

CONCLUSIONS
This chapter has given you many fine processes and tips on hiring the 
very best loss prevention associate. You got the word from an expert 
in the business of people, at one time creating relationships and now 
strengthening those relationships by improving the quality of life 
for practitioners in the industry through his leadership of the Loss 
Prevention Foundation. It is very obvious that training and expectations 
have momentous effects on the newest and brightest talent coming into 
our industry. You may have heard that people do not quit jobs; they 
quit people—namely, their managers, because they were treated poorly, 
lied to, left to perform without proper training, and perceived that their 
leaders had poor integrity. Go back to Chapter 2 in this book and recall 
the culture of integrity, substituting us who are now the employee. It is 
all relative.

CONCLUSION
This book covered many different aspects of the retail loss prevention 
profession. Both the novice and professional practitioner will be able to 
gain some insight into the world of retail loss prevention and maybe even 
embark on a few functional areas they were not aware of. Retail loss pre­
vention is a highly specialized field that many do not even realize exists. 
As shoppers go through the mall or department stores, most are not 
thinking about what is happening behind the scenes. As shoppers are 
putting their merchandise in the cart and wondering how they are going 
to explain what they just spent to their significant other, loss prevention 
practitioners are thinking about how to keep costs low for them by elimi­
nating internal and external theft. Not all professions will allow people 
to change the way they think about society, but retail loss prevention is 
one that does. It is very hard to leave your work at work when every time 
you go to buy groceries, clothes, shoes, or anything else you think about 
your work. For the authors, it has been about 10 years or more since we 
caught a shoplifter, but we are still very aware that they may be around 
as we shop. One suspicious move or look from a fellow shopper still gets 
the adrenaline running and the flight-or-fight response activated. We also 
find ourselves watching employees when we are in the customer mode 
as they ring through transactions at the register or have conversations 
with people who come to visit them. The knowledge you gain as a loss 
prevention practitioner never allows you to discount your feeling about 
something being wrong. Your senses will forever be heightened, and your 
need to make things right never goes away.
A person who truly embraces the profession will become a business 
leader unlike any other. Many people believe that because we deal only 
with “loss prevention issues” we are not qualified to do anything else. 
They could not be more wrong. We, unlike most departments within an 
organization, deal with every aspect of the business. From a sales per-
spective, we will be the ones who understand why a particular store is or 
is not generating the expected revenue. We will be the ones who dig down 
deep enough to understand the underlying causes of performance, when 
others will simply repeat the same objective or terminate the individual. 
Our ability to understand human behavior is developed over time and 
will help to mold us for significant leadership positions. Loss prevention 

Conclusion

people learn to truly understand the “whys” behind every action and reac­
tion to rectify the causes of the problems. We do not sit back and deal with 
the symptoms of the problem; rather, we determine the root cause because 
we know that is where the issue starts. One of the recurring themes in this 
book was relationships because it is one of the most important functions 
of your jobs. Most loss prevention practitioners are not directly respon­
sible for stores or the people who supervise those stores. Because of this, 
our ability to influence and persuade others to do what is necessary relies 
on our ability to build meaningful relationships. If we can build trusting 
relationships, we can move people in the organization in the direction 
we want to go. Another theme discussed was expectations. If employees 
understand the direction they are going and they are told the truth about 
everything, they are less likely to become a loss prevention problem.
The strategy of setting integrity expectations immediately and con­
veying the message of intolerance for counterproductive behavior is a 
must. I cannot emphasize enough how important this tactic is for field 
managers, and they will reap the rewards of such a method. All are crys­
tal clear about what is expected and what is not. This method will allow 
employees to operate under an umbrella that promotes an atmosphere of 
trust, respect, and compliance for the rules and regulations of the organi­
zation. In turn, the results and efforts will be genuine and achieved with 
commitment, not just out of compliance.
As you can tell from all your reading, loss prevention starts from the 
inside out. If we take the time to delve deep into shrinkage and employee 
dishonesty, we will uncover the issues. Putting out fire after fire will not 
resolve your problems entirely. Putting out fires without dealing with the 
main cause of the problems will only prolong the issues. The book pro­
vided examples of building an audit process, how to investigate in retail 
loss prevention, and how to build a department and discussed the cur­
rent epidemic of organized retail crime. If you are reading this book, you 
are likely in this field, are interested in the field, are in retailing, or are a 
criminal wanting to understand how to avoid us. It is the authors’ hope 
that you take the areas that you need to learn about and read carefully. 
One resounding theme throughout this book is how strongly the culture 
of the company affects the success of your loss prevention program.
One additional point we would like to leave you with is this: if an 
organization is built on an ethical infrastructure that promotes integrity, 
loss prevention issues will be lessened. It is our job to help build that infra-
structure, influenced deeply by company culture, and to guide employ-
ees on how to remain honest and do the right thing. Most employees do

not become employed with the intention of stealing or defrauding their 
employer. Something happens along the way to change their motives. If 
we are watching closely, the change can be caught in time, and a bad deci-
sion can be stopped. It is all about the passion for doing what is right, even 
when no one is looking.

According to industry reports, roughly $37 billion in the retail sector is lost 
annually to shrinkage, 42% of which is the result of internal theft. Each year 
organizations spend millions of dollars on theft detection and prevention 
devices yet still incur losses at the hands of their own employees; this begs 
the question not of how theft occurs, but why.
Examining the Theft Triangle (opportunity, motivation, and insufficient 
deterrents), Retail Security and Loss Prevention Solutions investigates 
motivational factors that contribute to loss and describes philosophies that, 
if adopted, can change the entire spectrum of employee dishonesty. As the 
job title implies, a Loss Prevention professional’s goal is to stop the damage 
before it occurs. By changing the overall presentation of the business and 
contending with the factors preceding the crime, the crime itself can be 
avoided. To this end, the book discusses behaviors that precede a loss event, 
theoretical perspectives and research on employee deviance and motivation, 
and methods to control employee dishonesty through deterrents as well as 
ethical infrastructures. 
In addition to examining the internal threat, the book looks at shoplifting 
and external theft as well as emerging trends in organized retail crime. 
Detailing the intricacies of loss prevention and the myriad skills involved—
such as accounting, forensics, fraud detection, human behavior analysis, and 
interview/interrogation skills—the authors offer advice on how to select the 
right individuals for the job and how to build a Loss Prevention department. 
The book includes interviews with professionals in the field and examines 
real-life case studies discussing the problems and solutions for the future 
of loss prevention as a whole. As such, it will be a welcome reference for 
security and loss prevention professionals, criminal justice students, and law 
enforcement as to the motivations of criminals and the tactics used by them.
