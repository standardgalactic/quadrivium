Answers 1-110 
Question 1. A client disputes having signed a digital contract. 
The service provider needs to prove that the signature was 
indeed from the client and hasn’t been tampered with. Which of 
the following security concepts is the service provider relying 
on? 
(A)       Authentication 
(B)       Confidentiality 
(C)       Non-repudiation 
(D)       Access Control 
Explanation 1. Correct Answer: C. Non-repudiation. Non-
repudiation ensures that a party in a dispute cannot deny the 
authenticity of their actions. In this scenario, it would provide 
evidence that the client did sign the contract and that it hasn’t 
been tampered with post-signature. 
Option A is incorrect. Authentication confirms the identity of a 
user or system. While it plays a part in ensuring that the right 
person is accessing the system, it doesn’t directly provide 
evidence about the actions post-authentication, like signing a 
contract. 
Option B is incorrect. Confidentiality ensures that information 
is only accessible to those with the appropriate permissions. It 
doesn’t provide evidence of an action being taken by a specific 
entity. 
	
 
51

Option D is incorrect. Access Control determines who or what 
can view or use resources in a computing environment. It 
doesn’t ensure the validity of actions taken within the system. 
Question 2. Carlos, an IT consultant, advises a startup company 
on cybersecurity best practices. The company plans to launch 
several microsites under various subdomains. They want a 
solution that is cost-effective but also ensures that the sites are 
validated by a third-party. What type of certificate should Carlos 
recommend? 
(A)       A separate self-signed certificate for each microsite 
(B)       An individual third-party certificate for each subdomain 
(C)       A third-party wildcard certificate 
(D)       An EV certificate issued by an internal CA 
Explanation 2. Correct Answer: C. A third-party wildcard 
certificate. A third-party wildcard certificate allows an 
organization to secure multiple subdomains with a single 
certificate. It’s cost-effective as the company doesn’t need to 
purchase and manage separate certificates for each subdomain, 
and because it’s issued by a third-party Certificate Authority, it 
provides validation for external users. 
Option A is incorrect. Self-signed certificates won’t provide 
third-party validation, which could result in trust issues for 
external users. 
Option B is incorrect. While individual third-party certificates 
for each subdomain will provide third-party validation, this 
approach would not be as cost-effective as a wildcard 
certificate. 
	
 
52

Option D is incorrect. An EV certificate provides high 
assurance, but one issued by an internal CA will not be 
inherently trusted by external users. 
Question 3. A company wants to ensure that security incidents 
are detected and addressed as quickly as possible by on-duty 
personnel. Which of the following operational security controls 
would be BEST to implement for this purpose? 
(A)       Deploying a Network Intrusion Prevention System 
(NIPS) 
(B)       Establishing a 24/7 Security Operations Center 
(SOC) 
(C)       Creating a company-wide security policy 
(D)       Implementing end-to-end data encryption 
Explanation 3. Correct Answer: B. Establishing a 24/7 
Security Operations Center (SOC). A Security Operations 
Center (SOC) is an operational control that provides real-time 
monitoring, detection, and response to security incidents. With a 
24/7 SOC, the company ensures that there is always personnel 
available to handle security incidents as they occur. 
Option A is incorrect. Deploying a Network Intrusion 
Prevention System (NIPS) is a technical control. While it can 
prevent unauthorized activities on the network, it does not 
ensure that there is personnel available around the clock to 
address incidents. 
Option C is incorrect. Creating a company-wide security 
policy is a managerial control. It sets the guidelines and 
	
 
53

procedures for security but does not ensure continuous 
monitoring and immediate response to incidents. 
Option D is incorrect. Implementing end-to-end data 
encryption is a technical control that ensures data 
confidentiality. While it protects data, it does not ensure that 
incidents are detected and addressed by on-duty personnel in 
real-time. 
Question 4. During a routine check, the IT department 
discovered that several employees had left their computers on 
and unattended during lunch break. Which operational security 
control can help mitigate the risk associated with this behavior? 
(A)       Implementing biometric authentication 
(B)       Enforcing a strict password policy 
(C)       Deploying an automatic screen lock after inactivity 
(D)       Implementing a secure coding practice 
Explanation 4. Correct Answer: C. Deploying an automatic 
screen lock after inactivity. Deploying an automatic screen 
lock after a certain period of inactivity is an operational control. 
It ensures that unattended devices are protected from 
unauthorized access, thereby mitigating risks associated with 
employees leaving their computers on and unattended. 
Option A is incorrect. Implementing biometric authentication 
is a technical control. While it enhances security at the point of 
access, it doesn’t ensure that active sessions on unattended 
devices are secured against unauthorized access. 
	
 
54

Option B is incorrect. Enforcing a strict password policy is a 
managerial control that dictates the creation and use of strong 
passwords. While it enhances access security, it doesn’t secure 
active sessions on unattended devices. 
Option D is incorrect. Implementing a secure coding practice 
is a technical and sometimes managerial control. It ensures 
software is written to prevent vulnerabilities but doesn’t directly 
address the risk of unattended computers. 
Question 5. An art gallery wants to deploy a security solution to 
detect movement in an open courtyard that features several 
sculptures. This space has varying temperature conditions, 
which might cause false alarms in some motion detection 
technologies. Which type of sensor would be MOST 
appropriate to ensure consistent motion detection in such 
conditions? 
(A)       Thermal imaging sensors 
(B)       Pressure-sensitive mats 
(C)       Ultrasonic detectors 
(D)       Microwave motion detectors 
Explanation 5. Correct Answer: D. Microwave motion 
detectors. Microwave motion detectors are suitable for open 
areas and are less affected by temperature changes. They emit 
microwave beams to create an invisible detection zone and can 
consistently detect motion when an object interrupts this zone, 
irrespective of the ambient temperature. 
Option A is incorrect. Thermal imaging sensors detect 
variations in heat. While they can be effective, the varying 
	
 
55

temperature conditions in the courtyard may cause 
inconsistencies in detection. 
Option B is incorrect. Pressure-sensitive mats are designed to 
detect weight or pressure changes when stepped on. They would 
not be suitable for an open courtyard where movement needs to 
be detected across a larger area. 
Option C is incorrect. Ultrasonic detectors emit sound waves 
to detect motion. However, they might also be affected by 
external environmental factors and are not as suitable for open 
courtyards as microwave motion detectors. 
Question 6. A company’s primary security control for accessing 
secure server rooms is a biometric fingerprint scanner. 
However, the scanner occasionally malfunctions in high 
humidity. The security team is considering an alternative 
solution to grant access when the primary method fails. Which 
of the following would be the MOST appropriate compensating 
control? 
(A)       Implementing a security token-based authentication 
system 
(B)       Employing security guards at the main entrance 
(C)       Installing security cameras inside the server room 
(D)       Conducting regular server room audits 
Explanation 6. Correct Answer: A. Implementing a security 
token-based authentication system. A security token-based 
authentication system would act as an alternative method for 
verifying the identity of individuals when the primary control 
	
 
56

(biometric fingerprint scanner) fails. This serves as a direct 
compensating control for access. 
Option B is incorrect. While security guards at the main 
entrance can provide an added layer of security, they aren’t a 
direct compensating control for a malfunctioning biometric 
system in a specific location like the server room. 
Option C is incorrect. While security cameras provide 
surveillance, they don’t act as an alternative method for granting 
or denying access to the server room. 
Option D is incorrect. Conducting regular server room audits 
is a detective control. It won’t provide real-time access or 
compensate for the malfunctioning fingerprint scanner. 
Question 7. A financial institution wants to ensure that 
customers are aware of the bank’s policies on information 
sharing and how their personal data is used. Which of the 
following security controls would BEST communicate this to 
customers? 
(A)       Implementing end-to-end encryption for online 
transactions 
(B)       Publishing a privacy policy on the bank's website 
(C)       Conducting annual cybersecurity awareness training for 
employees 
(D)       Using multi-factor authentication for online banking 
Explanation 7. Correct Answer: B. Publishing a privacy 
policy on the bank’s website. A privacy policy serves as a 
directive control as it informs customers about the bank’s 
	
 
57

practices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of their 
personal data. By reading the policy, customers understand their 
rights and the bank’s responsibilities. 
Option A is incorrect. While end-to-end encryption ensures the 
confidentiality of online transactions, it doesn’t inform 
customers about the bank’s policies on information sharing or 
how their data is used. 
Option C is incorrect. Annual cybersecurity awareness training 
is aimed at employees, not customers. It wouldn’t directly 
communicate the bank’s information-sharing policies to its 
customers. 
Option D is incorrect. Using multi-factor authentication 
improves the security of online banking by requiring multiple 
forms of verification. However, it doesn’t communicate to 
customers how their personal data is used or the bank’s 
information-sharing policies. 
Question 8. A large financial organization wants to ensure that 
all employees understand the importance of cybersecurity and 
the role they play in safeguarding company assets. Which of the 
following managerial security controls will be MOST effective 
in achieving this? 
(A)       Installing a firewall at the network perimeter 
(B)       Regular security awareness training for employees 
(C)       Deploying an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
(D)       Encrypting all company data 
	
 
58

Explanation 8. Correct Answer: B. Regular security 
awareness training for employees. Security awareness training 
is a managerial control aiming to educate employees about 
security risks and the necessary precautions they need to take. 
By regularly training employees, the organization ensures that 
all staff are aware of potential threats and their roles in 
cybersecurity. 
Option A is incorrect. Installing a firewall is a technical control 
focused on preventing unauthorized access to or from a private 
network. While it protects the network, it doesn’t directly 
educate employees about their roles in cybersecurity. 
Option C is incorrect. Deploying an Intrusion Detection 
System (IDS) is a technical control. It monitors network traffic 
for suspicious activities but does not directly focus on educating 
employees. 
Option D is incorrect. Encrypting company data is a technical 
control. While it ensures the confidentiality of data, it doesn’t 
address the employees’ knowledge or awareness regarding 
cybersecurity. 
Question 9. A company has faced multiple instances of 
unauthorized individuals gaining access to their office premises. 
Which of the following preventive security controls would be 
MOST effective in preventing unauthorized physical access? 
(A)       Implementing a log monitoring solution for network 
traffic 
(B)       Installing video surveillance cameras at all entry and 
exit points 
	
 
59

(C)       Conducting regular security awareness training for 
employees 
(D)       Implementing a multi-factor authentication system for 
network access. 
Explanation 9. Correct Answer: B. Installing video 
surveillance cameras at all entry and exit points. Installing 
video surveillance cameras at all entry and exit points acts as a 
preventive control by deterring unauthorized individuals from 
attempting to gain access, given the increased risk of detection 
and recording. 
Option A is incorrect. Implementing a log monitoring solution 
is a detective control that provides insights into network 
activities but doesn’t prevent unauthorized physical access. 
Option C is incorrect. Conducting regular security awareness 
training is a preventive measure, but its main focus is on 
making employees aware of security risks and best practices, 
not directly preventing unauthorized physical access. 
Option D is incorrect. Implementing a multi-factor 
authentication system is a preventive control for unauthorized 
digital access but doesn’t address the prevention of 
unauthorized physical access. 
Question 10. TechVault, a company specializing in secure 
storage solutions, recently had an unauthorized intrusion where 
a burglar managed to bypass their motion sensors. In a bid to 
prevent future breaches, they are considering deploying a 
system that can detect weight changes in a restricted floor area 
	
 
60

to alert any unauthorized access. Which of the following would 
be BEST for this requirement? 
(A)       Ultrasonic motion detectors 
(B)       Pressure-sensitive floor mats 
(C)       CCTV cameras with facial recognition 
(D)       Glass break sensors 
Explanation 10. Correct Answer: B. Pressure-sensitive floor 
mats. Pressure-sensitive floor mats are designed to detect 
weight changes or pressure when stepped on. This makes them 
an effective solution for monitoring restricted areas and alerting 
unauthorized access based on weight detection. 
Option A is incorrect. Ultrasonic motion detectors use sound 
waves to detect motion in an area but do not measure weight or 
pressure. 
Option C is incorrect. CCTV cameras with facial recognition 
provide visual surveillance and can identify individuals, but 
they don’t detect weight changes on the floor. 
Option D is incorrect. Glass break sensors detect the sound of 
breaking glass and are primarily used for windows and glass 
doors, not for detecting pressure or weight changes on a floor. 
Question 11. A system administrator is setting up an 
authentication system for a new web application. Which of the 
following security controls falls under the technical category 
and ensures that users prove their identity before gaining 
access? 
(A)       Implementing a security awareness training program 
	
 
61

(B)       Conducting a background check for new employees 
(C)       Using multi-factor authentication 
(D)       Establishing a clean desk policy 
Explanation 11. Correct Answer: C. Using multi-factor 
authentication. Multi-factor authentication is a technical 
control that requires users to present two or more pieces of 
evidence (factors) before gaining access. It provides an 
additional layer of security to ensure that users are who they say 
they are. 
Option A is incorrect. Implementing a security awareness 
training program is an administrative control, as it involves 
educating employees on security best practices rather than using 
technical measures to enforce them. 
Option B is incorrect. Conducting a background check is an 
administrative control as it involves vetting potential employees 
before they’re hired. This process doesn’t directly enforce 
technical measures on systems or networks. 
Option D is incorrect. Establishing a clean desk policy is an 
administrative control. It sets a guideline for employees to keep 
their workspaces tidy and free of sensitive information, rather 
than enforcing technical measures. 
Question 12. An e-commerce company has experienced a 
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, which caused its 
website to become inaccessible for several hours. To mitigate 
the impact of such attacks in the future, which of the following 
would be the BEST corrective control to implement? 
	
 
62

(A)       Displaying a seal for third-party security certifications 
on the website 
(B)       Establishing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with 
DDoS protection 
(C)       Conducting routine vulnerability assessments on the 
website 
(D)       Implementing strong password policies for website 
administrators 
Explanation 12. Correct Answer: B. Establishing a Web 
Application Firewall (WAF) with DDoS protection. A Web 
Application Firewall (WAF) with DDoS protection can identify 
and filter out malicious traffic associated with DDoS attacks. As 
a corrective control, it can help in mitigating the impact and 
restoring normal service during and after an attack. 
Option A is incorrect. Displaying a seal for third-party security 
certifications on the website acts as a deterrent by showing 
visitors and potential attackers that the site adheres to security 
standards. However, it does not mitigate or correct the effects of 
a DDoS attack. 
Option C is incorrect. Conducting routine vulnerability 
assessments is a detective control that helps in identifying 
weaknesses. While it’s essential for overall security, it doesn’t 
directly correct or mitigate the effects of a DDoS attack. 
Option D is incorrect. Implementing strong password policies 
for website administrators is a preventive control. It ensures that 
administrators’ accounts are secure, but it does not address or 
correct the issues caused by a DDoS attack. 
	
 
63

Question 13. GreenTech Industries has a manufacturing facility 
located in a relatively secluded area. Recent incidents of theft 
and trespassing have alarmed the management. Which of the 
following would MOST effectively deter unauthorized 
nighttime access to the perimeter of the facility? 
(A)       Installing infrared sensors 
(B)       Using bright perimeter lighting 
(C)       Deploying additional security guards inside the facility 
(D)       Increasing the height of the facility walls 
Explanation 13. Correct Answer: B. Using bright perimeter 
lighting. Bright perimeter lighting acts as a strong deterrent for 
unauthorized individuals, as it reduces hiding spots, makes 
surveillance cameras more effective, and can make it easier for 
security personnel to spot potential threats. In secluded areas, 
proper lighting is particularly essential to illuminate dark spots 
and deter potential intruders. 
Option A is incorrect. While infrared sensors can detect 
movement, they do not act as a visible deterrent in the same 
way bright lighting does. 
Option C is incorrect. Deploying additional security guards 
inside the facility does not address the immediate concern of 
unauthorized nighttime access to the perimeter. 
Option D is incorrect. Increasing the height of the walls can 
act as a deterrent, but it doesn’t illuminate or expose potential 
intruders like bright lighting does. 
	
 
64

Question 14. While conducting a routine security review, Jake, 
a security specialist, discovers an unexpected piece of data 
placed in the organization’s financial system. Upon asking, he 
learns that this piece of data is intentionally placed and 
monitored to see if any unauthorized user or system interacts 
with it. What is this deceptive piece of data known as? 
(A)       Honeystring 
(B)       Honeytoken 
(C)       Canary token 
(D)       Security marker 
Explanation 14. Correct Answer: B. Honeytoken. 
Honeytokens are strategically placed deceptive pieces of data 
that have no actual value or real-world use but are closely 
monitored. Their sole purpose is to detect unauthorized 
interactions, as any access or use of a honeytoken is likely 
malicious or unauthorized. 
Option A is incorrect. There isn’t a commonly recognized 
security term known as “Honeystring” in the context described. 
Option C is incorrect. Canary tokens are a specific type of 
honeytoken and can serve the same purpose. However, given 
the choices provided and the context of the question, 
“Honeytoken” is the most accurate answer. 
Option D is incorrect. A security marker, in a general sense, 
can be any mark or indicator used for security purposes, but it 
isn’t specifically a deceptive piece of data placed to detect 
unauthorized access.

Question 15. An organization is deploying new IoT devices in 
its smart office. To ensure that only authorized devices can 
connect to the corporate network, each device will be given a 
unique key pair. Which of the following best describes the 
system authentication approach the organization is using? 
(A)       Shared secret authentication 
(B)       Public key infrastructure (PKI) 
(C)       Token-based authentication 
(D)       Username and password authentication 
Explanation 15. Correct Answer: B. Public key 
infrastructure (PKI). Public key infrastructure (PKI) is a 
combination of hardware, software, policies, and standards that 
work together to provide a framework for secure 
communications. One of the primary features of PKI is the use 
of a pair of keys (public and private) to authenticate entities. In 
the scenario, each IoT device is given a unique key pair, 
indicating the use of PKI for system authentication. 
Option A is incorrect. Shared secret authentication typically 
involves two parties having a shared secret that they use to 
authenticate one another. The scenario mentions a unique key 
pair for each device, which doesn’t align with the concept of a 
shared secret. 
Option C is incorrect. Token-based authentication typically 
involves using a hardware or software token that generates a 
time-sensitive code. The scenario is describing the use of key 
pairs, not tokens. 
	
 
66

Option D is incorrect. Username and password authentication 
is a method where entities provide a username and a secret 
password to verify their identity. The scenario does not mention 
the use of usernames or passwords. 
Question 16. In the new branch of BankSecure, the 
management has decided to install a security system at the main 
entrance that forces visitors to go through two separate 
authorization checks before entering the main premises. Which 
physical security measure should they consider? 
(A)       Turnstiles 
(B)       Security Guards 
(C)       Access Control Vestibule 
(D)       Keycard Readers 
Explanation 16. Correct Answer: C. Access Control 
Vestibule. An access control vestibule, often referred to as a 
mantrap, is a two-stage authentication system. It consists of two 
doors: a person enters the first door, undergoes an authorization 
check (like a badge reader or biometric scanner), and only after 
being approved can they proceed to the second door, where they 
undergo another authorization check before accessing the main 
premises. 
Option A is incorrect. Turnstiles control the flow of individuals 
into a location and can prevent tailgating to some extent, but 
they do not force a two-stage authorization check. 
Option B is incorrect. While security guards can perform 
authorization checks and control access, they alone do not 
	
 
67

provide a two-stage authorization system like an access control 
vestibule. 
Option D is incorrect. Keycard readers are a form of access 
control that checks the credentials of individuals, but on their 
own, they don’t ensure two separate authorization checks. 
Question 17. The IT department wants to monitor network 
traffic in real time to detect any anomalies or malicious 
activities. Which of the following security controls can 
accomplish this? 
(A)       Security policy documentation 
(B)       Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
(C)       Employee code of conduct 
(D)       Access Control Lists (ACL) 
Explanation 17.  Correct Answer: B. Intrusion Detection 
System (IDS). An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a 
technical control that monitors network traffic in real-time and 
alerts administrators to any suspicious or malicious activities 
based on predefined rules or heuristics. 
Option A is incorrect. Security policy documentation is an 
administrative control. It provides guidelines and procedures for 
maintaining security but does not actively monitor network 
traffic. 
Option C is incorrect. Employee code of conduct is an 
administrative control. It provides guidelines on how employees 
should behave in a professional setting but does not actively 
monitor network traffic. 
	
 
68

Option D is incorrect. Access Control Lists (ACL) are 
technical controls, but they are used to define permissions on 
who can access specific resources. They do not actively monitor 
network traffic in real-time for anomalies or malicious 
activities. 
Question 18. Jenna, a web administrator for a growing online 
retail business, is in the process of obtaining SSL certificates for 
the company’s domain. The company uses several subdomains 
for different services, such as shop.example.com, 
blog.example.com, and support.example.com. Instead of 
obtaining individual certificates for each subdomain, Jenna 
wants to use one certificate. What type of certificate should 
Jenna pursue? 
(A)       Extended Validation Certificate 
(B)       Wildcard Certificate 
(C)       Certificate with Subject Alternative Names (SAN) 
(D)       Code Signing Certificate 
Explanation 18. Correct Answer: B. Wildcard Certificate. A 
Wildcard Certificate is designed to secure a domain and its 
subdomains under the same top-level domain. For example, a 
wildcard certificate for *.example.com would secure 
shop.example.com, blog.example.com, and any other 
subdomain of example.com. 
Option A is incorrect. An Extended Validation Certificate 
provides the highest level of validation but does not necessarily 
cover multiple subdomains by default. 
	
 
69

Option C is incorrect. While a Certificate with Subject 
Alternative Names (SAN) can secure multiple domains and 
subdomains, it is not specifically tailored for all subdomains 
under a single domain as the Wildcard Certificate is. 
Option D is incorrect. A Code Signing Certificate is used to 
sign software code, ensuring its integrity and authenticity, not 
for securing domains or subdomains. 
Question 19. At a newly established museum, management 
wants to install sensors in the exhibit rooms to detect any 
unauthorized movement after hours. The rooms are often filled 
with a mix of air conditioning and external noise from the city. 
Which sensor would be BEST suited to detect movement in 
such conditions without being affected by the noise? 
(A)       Acoustic sensors 
(B)       Glass break detectors 
(C)       Ultrasonic sensors 
(D)       Thermal imaging cameras 
Explanation 19. Correct Answer: C. Ultrasonic sensors. 
Ultrasonic sensors emit high-frequency sound waves to detect 
motion. These sound waves are beyond the range of human 
hearing and won’t be affected by ambient noise, making them 
ideal for environments with varying noise conditions. When 
motion is detected, as indicated by changes in the reflected 
waves, an alarm is triggered. 
Option A is incorrect. Acoustic sensors detect specific sounds. 
The external noise from the city might cause false alarms or 
interfere with their detection capabilities. 
	
 
70

Option B is incorrect. Glass break detectors are designed to 
detect the sound or vibration of breaking glass. They aren’t 
designed primarily to detect movement. 
Option D is incorrect. Thermal imaging cameras detect heat 
signatures and would be more susceptible to variations in room 
temperature due to air conditioning, potentially leading to false 
detections. 
Question 20. A company is setting up a secure communication 
channel between its headquarters and a remote branch office. To 
ensure that data transmitted over this channel originates from a 
legitimate system at the branch office, the company is 
considering using digital certificates. Which authentication 
method for systems is the company contemplating? 
(A)       Kerberos authentication 
(B)       Password-based authentication 
(C)       Certificate-based authentication 
(D)       Biometric-based authentication 
Explanation 20.  Correct Answer: C. Certificate-based 
authentication. Certificate-based authentication uses digital 
certificates to verify the identity of systems or individuals. In 
the given scenario, the company wants to verify that data 
transmitted over the communication channel originates from a 
legitimate system, making digital certificates an appropriate 
choice. 
Option A is incorrect. Kerberos authentication is a ticket-based 
authentication protocol primarily used to authenticate users in a 
	
 
71

network, not specifically for system-to-system authentication 
using digital certificates. 
Option B is incorrect. Password-based authentication requires 
systems or users to provide a secret password to prove their 
identity. It doesn’t involve the use of digital certificates. 
Option D is incorrect. Biometric-based authentication involves 
using unique physical or behavioral attributes of a person for 
verification, such as fingerprints or facial patterns. It is not 
applicable to system-to-system authentication. 
Question 21. A financial institution has experienced an uptick 
in unauthorized transactions. They want to implement a control 
that will allow them to identify suspicious transactions in real-
time. Which of the following would be the BEST detective 
control for this scenario? 
(A)       Implementing a multi-factor authentication system for 
all users 
(B)       Establishing a Security Operations Center (SOC) to 
monitor network traffic 
(C)       Installing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) on 
their network 
(D)       Restricting transaction capabilities to only a few trusted 
IP addresses. 
Explanation 21. Correct Answer: C. Installing an Intrusion 
Detection System (IDS) on their network. An Intrusion 
Detection System (IDS) serves as a detective control by 
monitoring network traffic for suspicious activities and potential 
threats. In this context, it can be configured to detect patterns 
	
 
72

related to unauthorized transactions, thereby allowing timely 
intervention. 
Option A is incorrect. Implementing a multi-factor 
authentication system is a preventive control that provides an 
additional layer of security by requiring two or more 
verification methods. While it reduces the risk of unauthorized 
access, it does not detect suspicious transactions. 
Option B is incorrect. Establishing a Security Operations 
Center (SOC) is a broad approach to handle security events, and 
while it can include detective controls, merely setting up a SOC 
does not provide specific real-time detection of unauthorized 
transactions. 
Option D is incorrect. Restricting transaction capabilities to 
only a few trusted IP addresses is a preventive control that 
limits the sources of potential transactions. While it can reduce 
the number of unauthorized transactions, it does not detect 
them. 
Question 22. TechHaus has recently experienced multiple 
security breaches where unauthorized personnel have managed 
to infiltrate their server rooms after hours. To enhance security 
measures, the company decided to deploy a new system. Which 
of the following options would BEST detect human intruders 
based on their body heat even in complete darkness? 
(A)       Installing CCTV cameras with LED lights 
(B)       Using ultrasonic motion sensors 
(C)       Deploying infrared (IR) sensors 
(D)       Implementing RFID badge readers at the entrance 
	
 
73

Explanation 22. Correct Answer: C. Deploying infrared (IR) 
sensors. Infrared (IR) sensors detect infrared radiation, such as 
the heat emitted by the human body. This makes them 
particularly effective in detecting human intruders, even in 
complete darkness, based on the body heat they emit. 
Option A is incorrect. While CCTV cameras with LED lights 
can provide visual surveillance, they rely on light to produce 
images and may not detect intruders in complete darkness as 
efficiently as infrared sensors. 
Option B is incorrect. Ultrasonic motion sensors detect 
movement through sound waves, not body heat, making them 
less efficient in differentiating between a human intruder and 
other moving objects. 
Option D is incorrect. RFID badge readers control access at 
entry points but do not detect human intruders based on their 
body heat inside a facility. 
Question 23. After detecting an unauthorized intrusion into 
their network, a financial institution wants to implement a 
control that will restore compromised systems to a known good 
state. Which of the following would be the MOST appropriate 
corrective control? 
(A)       Implementing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) across 
the network 
(B)       Frequently updating firewall rules 
(C)       Restoring systems from verified backups 
(D)       Enabling multi-factor authentication for users 
	
 
74

Explanation 23. Correct Answer: C. Deploying infrared (IR) 
sensors. Infrared (IR) sensors detect infrared radiation, such as 
the heat emitted by the human body. This makes them 
particularly effective in detecting human intruders, even in 
complete darkness, based on the body heat they emit. 
Option A is incorrect. While CCTV cameras with LED lights 
can provide visual surveillance, they rely on light to produce 
images and may not detect intruders in complete darkness as 
efficiently as infrared sensors. 
Option B is incorrect. Ultrasonic motion sensors detect 
movement through sound waves, not body heat, making them 
less efficient in differentiating between a human intruder and 
other moving objects. 
Option D is incorrect. RFID badge readers control access at 
entry points but do not detect human intruders based on their 
body heat inside a facility. 
Question 24. After a recent security breach, Sarah, a 
cybersecurity analyst, is implementing additional measures to 
detect unauthorized activities. She decides to embed specific 
values in the database that serve no real purpose but are 
monitored for any unauthorized access or usage. These values 
are designed to raise alerts if they are ever accessed or used. 
What are these specific values commonly referred to as? 
(A)       Security flags 
(B)       Honeypots 
(C)       Honeytokens 
(D)       Audit trails 
	
 
75

Explanation 24. Correct Answer: C. Restoring systems from 
verified backups. Restoring systems from verified backups is a 
corrective control, as it can restore compromised systems to 
their last known good state. This action corrects the adverse 
effects of the intrusion and ensures that any malicious 
alterations are removed. 
Option A is incorrect. Implementing Intrusion Detection 
Systems (IDS) is a detective control. It monitors and detects 
malicious activities in the network but doesn’t correct the 
adverse impacts of an intrusion. 
Option B is incorrect. Frequently updating firewall rules is a 
preventive measure, aiming to block malicious traffic and 
prevent potential intrusions. While vital, it doesn’t correct the 
impacts of an already occurred breach. 
Option D is incorrect. Enabling multi-factor authentication is a 
preventive control, aiming to provide additional layers of 
verification. While it enhances security, it doesn’t correct the 
adverse impacts of an intrusion. 
Question 25. Bob receives an email prompting him to verify his 
identity by clicking on a link. The link directs him to a webpage 
where he has to provide his username, password, and answer a 
personal security question. What type of authentication method 
is being employed here? 
(A)       Biometric authentication 
(B)       Token-based authentication 
(C)       Two-factor authentication 
(D)       Single sign-on 
	
 
76

Explanation 25. Correct Answer: C. Two-factor 
authentication. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security 
process in which users provide two different authentication 
factors to verify their identity. In this scenario, Bob is providing 
something he knows (username and password) and also 
answering a personal security question, which is another form 
of “something he knows.” 
Option A is incorrect. Biometric authentication involves using 
unique physical or behavioral attributes of a person for 
verification, such as fingerprints or facial patterns. The scenario 
doesn’t mention any biometric data. 
Option B is incorrect. Token-based authentication typically 
involves using a hardware or software token that generates a 
time-sensitive code. This was not described in the scenario. 
Option D is incorrect. Single sign-on (SSO) allows a user to 
log in once and gain access to multiple systems without being 
prompted to log in again for each system. The scenario 
describes a two-factor authentication process, not SSO. 
Question 26. In an effort to minimize data breaches from 
malware, a company is deciding on a control to prevent 
malicious software from being executed on company devices. 
Which of the following would be the BEST preventive control? 
(A)       Deploying a Network Intrusion Detection System 
(NIDS) 
(B)       Regularly backing up critical data 
(C)       Installing an antivirus software with real-time 
	
 
77

scanning 
(D)       Performing a forensic analysis after a security incident 
Explanation 26. Correct Answer: C. Two-factor 
authentication. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security 
process in which users provide two different authentication 
factors to verify their identity. In this scenario, Bob is providing 
something he knows (username and password) and also 
answering a personal security question, which is another form 
of “something he knows.” 
Option A is incorrect. Biometric authentication involves using 
unique physical or behavioral attributes of a person for 
verification, such as fingerprints or facial patterns. The scenario 
doesn’t mention any biometric data. 
Option B is incorrect. Token-based authentication typically 
involves using a hardware or software token that generates a 
time-sensitive code. This was not described in the scenario. 
Option D is incorrect. Single sign-on (SSO) allows a user to 
log in once and gain access to multiple systems without being 
prompted to log in again for each system. The scenario 
describes a two-factor authentication process, not SSO. 
Question 27. After undergoing a major infrastructure upgrade, 
GlobalMed Corp experienced several unanticipated security 
issues. In retrospect, the IT manager realized they skipped an 
essential step in their change management process which could 
have predicted and mitigated these issues. What step did they 
most likely overlook? 
	
 
78

(A)       Procurement of new hardware 
(B)       Training of IT staff on the new systems 
(C)       Impact analysis 
(D)       Integration with legacy systems 
Explanation 27. Correct Answer: C. Impact analysis. An 
impact analysis is vital in the change management process as it 
evaluates the potential ramifications of a proposed change. By 
conducting this analysis, organizations can anticipate potential 
security challenges and mitigate them before implementing the 
change. 
Option A is incorrect. While procurement is essential, merely 
purchasing new hardware wouldn’t directly help in predicting or 
mitigating potential security issues stemming from an 
infrastructure upgrade. 
Option B is incorrect. Training IT staff is essential for effective 
implementation and operation, but it doesn’t directly address 
predicting and understanding potential security consequences of 
the upgrade. 
Option D is incorrect. Integration with legacy systems is a 
crucial consideration, especially for compatibility. However, the 
focus of the scenario is on predicting and understanding 
potential security issues, which is primarily addressed through 
an impact analysis. 
Question 28. MegaCorp recently introduced a new web 
application for its customers. Before its release, the software 
underwent rigorous testing in a controlled environment. When 
	
 
79

the application was deployed in production, several security 
vulnerabilities were reported. Which of the following reasons 
can explain the mismatch between the test results and actual 
vulnerabilities? 
(A)       The testing environment was an exact replica of the 
production environment 
(B)       Test results were not thoroughly reviewed 
(C)       The software was not tested for zero-day vulnerabilities 
(D)       Penetration testing was done post-production 
Explanation 28. Correct Answer: B. Test results were not 
thoroughly reviewed. Even if an application is tested 
rigorously, it is crucial to thoroughly review and interpret the 
test results to identify any potential security vulnerabilities. 
Failing to review or misinterpreting these results can lead to 
vulnerabilities going unnoticed and unresolved. 
Option A is incorrect. Having a testing environment that 
mirrors the production environment is a best practice. This 
ensures that the tests are representative of how the software will 
behave in production. 
Option C is incorrect. While zero-day vulnerabilities are a 
concern, by definition, they are unknown vulnerabilities. 
Testing specifically for them would be challenging. However, 
thorough testing and review processes can mitigate potential 
risks. 
Option D is incorrect. Penetration testing is an essential aspect 
of security testing, but doing it post-production doesn’t explain 
	
 
80

the mismatch between the test results and actual vulnerabilities 
if the initial test results were not reviewed correctly. 
Question 29. An online banking website employs a system that 
automatically logs out users after 10 minutes of inactivity to 
ensure that if a user forgets to log out, no one else can alter the 
user’s banking details. Which principle of the CIA triad is the 
banking website MOST directly addressing? 
(A)       Confidentiality 
(B)       Availability 
(C)       Authentication 
(D)       Integrity 
Explanation 29. Correct Answer: D. Integrity.  The integrity 
pillar of the CIA triad ensures the accuracy and reliability of 
data. By logging out users after a period of inactivity, the 
banking website aims to prevent unauthorized modifications 
(potentially by someone else who might gain access to the 
unattended session) to the user’s banking details, thereby 
maintaining the integrity of the data. 
Option A is incorrect. While logging out users does have a 
confidentiality aspect, the primary aim in this scenario is to 
prevent unauthorized changes rather than unauthorized viewing. 
Option B is incorrect. Availability ensures that data and 
systems are accessible to authorized users when they need it. 
This scenario doesn’t discuss providing or restricting access 
based on system uptime or accessibility. 
	
 
81

Option C is incorrect. Authentication ensures that users are 
who they claim to be. While the scenario does touch on security 
measures, the primary concern here is preventing unauthorized 
changes to data, which aligns with integrity, not authentication. 
Question 30. A company is located in an area prone to natural 
disasters such as earthquakes and floods. Which of the 
following physical security controls would be MOST effective 
in ensuring the safety of the company’s IT infrastructure? 
(A)       Using biometric authentication for server access 
(B)       Deploying a firewall to protect against cyber threats 
(C)       Establishing a raised floor system in the data center 
(D)       Conducting penetration testing on a regular basis 
Explanation 30. Correct Answer: C. Establishing a raised 
floor system in the data center. A raised floor system in a data 
center serves as a physical control by elevating equipment off 
the ground, helping to protect it from potential water damage in 
the event of flooding and providing some protection from other 
environmental risks. 
Option A is incorrect. Using biometric authentication is a 
technical control that enhances security by confirming users’ 
identities based on physical or behavioral attributes. While it 
strengthens access security, it doesn’t provide protection against 
natural disasters. 
Option B is incorrect. Deploying a firewall is a technical 
control that guards against unauthorized access to or from a 
private network. While it protects against cyber threats, it 
	
 
82

doesn’t offer protection against physical threats like natural 
disasters. 
Option D is incorrect. Conducting penetration testing is a 
technical and sometimes operational control that identifies 
vulnerabilities in an organization’s digital assets. While it 
enhances cyber security, it doesn’t protect infrastructure against 
physical threats. 
Question 31. TechBank has just opened a new branch in the 
city center. Due to its location, the management is concerned 
about potential vehicular attacks on the facility. Which of the 
following physical security measures can TechBank employ to 
specifically deter such attacks? 
(A)       Surveillance Cameras 
(B)       Bollards 
(C)       Access Badges 
(D)       Security Guards 
Explanation 31. Correct Answer: B. Bollards. Bollards are 
short, sturdy vertical posts that are typically used to control road 
traffic. In the context of physical security, they serve to prevent 
vehicles from entering areas where they are not allowed, 
thereby acting as a deterrent against potential vehicular attacks. 
Option A is incorrect. While surveillance cameras can monitor 
and record activities, they do not serve as a physical barrier 
against vehicular attacks. 
Option C is incorrect. Access badges control personnel access 
to facilities but do not deter vehicular attacks. 
	
 
83

Option D is incorrect. While security guards can respond to 
threats and control access, they are not a specific measure to 
deter vehicular attacks like bollards. 
Question 32. During a security assessment, Maria, a security 
consultant, identifies a self-signed certificate being used on a 
client’s public-facing web server. What is the PRIMARY 
security concern related to this finding? 
(A)       The web server might be vulnerable to Distributed 
Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks 
(B)       The certificate could be expired 
(C)       Users cannot validate the authenticity of the website 
easily 
(D)       The web server might not support modern encryption 
algorithms 
Explanation 32. Correct Answer: C. Users cannot validate 
the authenticity of the website easily. Self-signed certificates 
are not signed by a recognized Certificate Authority. As a result, 
when users connect to a website using a self-signed certificate, 
they typically receive a warning that the certificate is not 
trusted. This poses a risk as users cannot easily validate the 
authenticity of the website, making them more susceptible to 
man-in-the-middle attacks. 
Option A is incorrect. While DDoS attacks are a concern for 
public-facing web servers, they aren’t directly related to the use 
of self-signed certificates. 
Option B is incorrect. Any certificate, whether self-signed or 
CA-signed, can expire. However, expiration is not the primary 
	
 
84

concern related to the use of self-signed certificates on public-
facing servers. 
Option D is incorrect. The use of modern encryption 
algorithms is independent of whether a certificate is self-signed 
or not. 
Question 33. TechFin Bank is considering implementing a new 
software system for their transaction processing. Before rolling 
it out, the cybersecurity team insists on carrying out a specific 
type of analysis to understand how this change might affect the 
organization’s security posture. What is the team referring to? 
(A)       Risk appetite assessment 
(B)       Performance benchmarking 
(C)       Impact analysis 
(D)       Penetration testing 
Explanation 33. Correct Answer: C. Impact analysis. An 
impact analysis assesses the potential consequences of a change 
within an organization. In the context of TechFin Bank, the 
cybersecurity team would use this analysis to understand how 
the new software system might introduce new vulnerabilities, 
affect existing security measures, or otherwise impact the 
bank’s overall security. 
Option A is incorrect. Risk appetite assessment refers to 
determining the amount and type of risk an organization is 
willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives. It doesn’t focus on 
the consequences of a specific change. 
	
 
85

Option B is incorrect. Performance benchmarking focuses on 
comparing an organization’s performance metrics to industry 
standards or best practices, not assessing the potential security 
impact of a change. 
Option D is incorrect. While penetration testing is crucial to 
assess the vulnerabilities in a system, it doesn’t provide a 
holistic view of the potential impacts a change might have on an 
organization’s security posture. 
Question 34. To discourage potential cybercriminals from 
targeting their online storefront, an e-commerce company is 
considering various security measures. Which of the following 
would act MOST effectively as a deterrent control? 
(A)       Displaying a seal for third-party security 
certifications on the website 
(B)       Using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
(C)       Conducting monthly vulnerability assessments 
(D)       Storing customer data in encrypted databases 
Explanation 34. Correct Answer: A. Displaying a seal for 
third-party security certifications on the website. Displaying 
a seal for third-party security certifications on the website 
serves as a deterrent control. It sends a message to potential 
attackers that the site is recognized for its security measures, 
which can discourage them from attempting an attack. 
Option B is incorrect. Using a Web Application Firewall 
(WAF) is a preventive control. It filters, monitors, and blocks 
malicious web traffic. While it helps in defending against cyber 
threats, it doesn’t act as a visible deterrent to attackers. 
	
 
86

Option C is incorrect. Conducting monthly vulnerability 
assessments is a detective control. It identifies vulnerabilities to 
enhance the security posture but doesn’t act as a deterrent to 
potential attackers. 
Option D is incorrect. Storing customer data in encrypted 
databases is a preventive control that ensures unauthorized 
individuals cannot access or comprehend the stored data. It 
protects data but doesn’t deter potential cybercriminals. 
Question 35. The security team of a multinational company 
deployed a network of honeypots globally, making it appear as 
an interconnected and realistic environment. They aim to study 
coordinated multi-stage attacks. This deceptive setup is known 
as: 
(A)       Firewall Cluster 
(B)       Virtual LAN (VLAN) 
(C)       Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Prevention 
(D)       Honeynet 
Explanation 35. Correct Answer: D. Honeynet. A honeynet is 
essentially a network of honeypots. It is designed to be 
attractive to attackers, making them believe they are attacking a 
real network, while in reality, they are being observed, and their 
tactics and techniques are being analyzed. 
Option A is incorrect. A Firewall Cluster is a group of 
firewalls operating together to increase reliability and 
performance. It doesn’t serve as a decoy to attract attackers. 
	
 
87

Option B is incorrect. A Virtual LAN (VLAN) is a network 
protocol used to create logically segmented networks within a 
physical network, improving performance and security. It’s not 
a decoy system. 
Option C is incorrect. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) 
Prevention solutions focus on identifying and mitigating large-
scale attempts to disrupt network service availability. They do 
not present a deceptive environment for attackers. 
Question 36. ExamsDigest Corp, a technology company, 
recently conducted a security assessment to align with industry 
best practices. The company’s current security posture was 
compared to its desired future state, revealing discrepancies. 
Which of the following best describes the approach 
ExamsDigest Corp employed? 
(A)       Vulnerability Assessment 
(B)       Penetration Testing 
(C)       Gap Analysis 
(D)       Threat Modeling 
Explanation 36. Correct Answer: C. Gap Analysis. Gap 
analysis is a method of comparing the current state of 
something (such as security measures) with a future desired 
state to identify the discrepancies or “gaps”. In the scenario, 
ExamsDigest Corp compared their current security posture to a 
desired future state, which is consistent with the process of gap 
analysis. 
	
 
88

Option A is incorrect. A vulnerability assessment focuses on 
identifying, quantifying, and ranking vulnerabilities in a system, 
not comparing the current state with a desired future state. 
Option B is incorrect. Penetration testing is an authorized 
simulated cyberattack on a system to evaluate its security, not to 
compare its current state with a desired future state. 
Option D is incorrect. Threat modeling is the process of 
identifying potential threats to a system and determining the risk 
they pose, not comparing the current state with a desired future 
state. 
Question 37. A pharmaceutical company is concerned about 
competitors accessing their formula for a new drug. Which 
pillar of the CIA triad is MOST directly addressed by their 
concern? 
(A)       Availability 
(B)       Confidentiality 
(C)       Integrity 
(D)       Non-repudiation 
Explanation 37. Correct Answer: B. Confidentiality. The 
confidentiality pillar of the CIA triad ensures that information is 
accessible only to those with authorized access. In this scenario, 
the company wants to ensure that its drug formula remains 
secret and is not accessible to unauthorized individuals, 
particularly competitors. 
Option A is incorrect. Availability ensures that information is 
accessible to authorized users when needed. The concern here is 
	
 
89

not about access to the data but rather about preventing 
unauthorized access. 
Option C is incorrect. Integrity ensures the accuracy and 
reliability of data and systems. The scenario doesn’t mention 
concerns about the formula being altered, only about 
unauthorized access. 
Option D is incorrect. Non-repudiation is a concept ensuring 
that a party in a dispute cannot deny the authenticity of their 
actions. It’s not directly related to the company’s concern about 
the secrecy of their drug formula. 
Question 38. FinCorp, a financial institution, has recently 
adopted a new security framework. In this framework, every 
device and user inside the organization’s network is treated as if 
they were outside the perimeter, necessitating rigorous 
verification processes even for internal requests. Which security 
paradigm has FinCorp implemented? 
(A)       Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) 
(B)       Network Segmentation 
(C)       Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
(D)       Zero Trust 
Explanation 38.  Correct Answer: D. Zero Trust. Zero Trust 
is a security model that treats every access request with 
skepticism, regardless of its origin, be it from within or outside 
the organization’s traditional perimeter. It requires rigorous 
verification processes for every interaction. 
	
 
90

Option A is incorrect. A Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is a 
physical or logical subnetwork that exposes an organization’s 
external-facing services to a larger, untrusted network, usually 
the internet. 
Option B is incorrect. Network Segmentation divides a 
network into multiple segments or subnets, allowing 
administrators to control the flow of traffic between them. It 
does not inherently distrust all traffic like Zero Trust. 
Option C is incorrect. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a 
device or software application that monitors a network or 
systems for malicious activity or policy violations. It doesn’t 
define how trust is managed across interactions. 
Question 39. GreenValley Mall, located in a busy urban area, 
has recently faced security concerns due to the proximity of its 
main entrance to a major road. Which physical security 
enhancement can the mall management implement to create a 
protective barrier between the road and the entrance, ensuring 
pedestrian safety and preventing unauthorized vehicular access? 
(A)       Reinforced Walls 
(B)       Metal Detectors 
(C)       Bollards 
(D)       Perimeter Fencing 
Explanation 39. Correct Answer: C. Bollards. Bollards are 
robust vertical posts, usually made of steel or concrete, which 
can be placed at specific intervals to form a protective barrier. 
They can effectively prevent vehicles from accessing pedestrian 
	
 
91

areas or building entrances while allowing pedestrian 
movement. 
Option A is incorrect. While reinforced walls can offer 
protection against various threats, they would not be practical 
for separating a mall entrance from a road as they would block 
pedestrian access as well. 
Option B is incorrect. Metal detectors are used for detecting 
metal objects and weapons on individuals entering a facility, not 
for stopping vehicular access. 
Option D is incorrect. Perimeter fencing can deter 
unauthorized access, but it might not specifically prevent fast-
moving vehicular threats like bollards do. Furthermore, a fence 
might not be aesthetically pleasing or practical in front of a mall 
entrance. 
Question 40. A tech company, InnovateTech, has recently faced 
multiple incidents of unauthorized personnel trying to access 
their R&D labs. They wish to monitor and record all activities 
near the entrance of this sensitive area. Which physical security 
measure would be most effective for this requirement? 
(A)       RFID Badge Readers 
(B)       Biometric Scanners 
(C)       Video Surveillance Cameras 
(D)       Mantrap 
Explanation 40. Correct Answer: C. Video Surveillance 
Cameras. Video surveillance cameras provide a continuous 
visual monitoring capability and can record activities near 
	
 
92

specific areas. For the purpose of observing and recording 
incidents near the entrance of the R&D labs, video surveillance 
would be the most direct and effective solution. 
Option A is incorrect. While RFID badge readers can control 
access and log which badges are used at entrances, they do not 
visually monitor or record activities. 
Option B is incorrect. Biometric scanners are an authentication 
mechanism, and while they offer a high level of security for 
access control, they do not provide visual monitoring or 
recording capabilities. 
Option D is incorrect. A mantrap is a physical security access 
control system that prevents tailgating into secure areas. While 
it can enhance security at entrances, it does not visually record 
activities. 
Question 41. A cybersecurity analyst at XYZ Corp is looking to 
deploy a system that appears to be vulnerable and enticing to 
attackers. The main goal is to study the tactics, techniques, and 
procedures (TTPs) of potential adversaries, without them 
realizing that they’re interacting with a decoy. Which of the 
following would BEST meet this requirement? 
(A)       Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
(B)       Firewall 
(C)       Honeypot 
(D)       VPN Concentrator 
Explanation 41. Correct Answer: C. Honeypot. A honeypot is 
a security mechanism designed to lure attackers into interacting 
	
 
93

with a seemingly vulnerable system. Its primary purpose is not 
to block or prevent attacks but to log and study them. By 
analyzing the activities on the honeypot, security professionals 
can gain insights into the methods and motivations of the 
attackers. 
Option A is incorrect. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is 
designed to detect malicious activities on a network and alert 
administrators. While it can identify threats, it doesn’t actively 
lure attackers. 
Option B is incorrect. A firewall is designed to block or allow 
traffic based on specific rules. It doesn’t present itself as a 
vulnerable target to lure attackers. 
Option D is incorrect. A VPN Concentrator is a device that 
provides remote access to a network over a secure connection. 
Its primary purpose is to enable secure remote access, not to act 
as a decoy for attackers. 
Question 42. A multinational organization recently experienced 
a significant security breach. After investigating, it was 
determined that a change to the network infrastructure was 
made without undergoing the standard approval process. As a 
result, there was a misconfiguration which allowed 
unauthorized access. What security principle related to change 
management did the organization neglect? 
(A)       Configuration baseline reviews 
(B)       Least privilege enforcement 
(C)       Approval process adherence 
(D)       Patch management 
	
 
94

Explanation 42. Correct Answer: C. Approval process 
adherence. The approval process is a critical aspect of change 
management. Before any changes are made, especially to 
critical systems like network infrastructure, they need to 
undergo a rigorous approval process. This ensures that multiple 
experts evaluate the change for potential vulnerabilities or 
issues. In this scenario, skipping the approval process led to a 
significant security breach. 
Option A is incorrect. Configuration baseline reviews involve 
regularly checking and ensuring that systems are configured as 
per the organization’s approved baseline. While it’s important, 
the issue in the scenario was directly related to bypassing the 
approval process. 
Option B is incorrect. Least privilege enforcement means 
providing only the minimal necessary access to users to perform 
their tasks. This scenario doesn’t deal with access rights or 
privileges. 
Option D is incorrect. Patch management concerns the process 
of applying updates to software and systems. The breach in the 
question wasn’t related to missing patches but was due to 
bypassing the approval process. 
Question 43. After a series of cyber-attacks on a company’s 
infrastructure, the IT team decided to deploy a solution that 
would seem like a legitimate part of their network but is 
intentionally isolated and monitored. They intend to detect and 
analyze malicious activities in this isolated environment. What 
technology are they most likely implementing? 
	
 
95

(A)       Network segmentation 
(B)       Honeypot 
(C)       DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) 
(D)       Sandboxing 
Explanation 43. Correct Answer: B. Honeypot. A honeypot is 
intentionally set up to appear as a legitimate part of a network, 
but it is isolated and closely monitored. Its purpose is to attract 
attackers and observe their actions, thereby providing insights 
into potential threats and the methods employed by adversaries. 
Option A is incorrect. Network segmentation involves dividing 
a network into smaller sub-networks. While this can enhance 
security by limiting attackers’ access to specific segments, it 
doesn’t act as a decoy to attract attackers. 
Option C is incorrect. A DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) is a 
subnet that acts as a buffer between the internet and an 
organization’s internal network. While it can contain servers 
accessible to external users, its primary purpose is not to act as a 
decoy but to provide a layer of protection. 
Option D is incorrect. Sandboxing is a security mechanism 
that allows programs to run in a separate environment to 
prevent them from affecting the broader system. It’s used for 
testing and analyzing potentially malicious software, not for 
luring attackers. 
Question 44. Liam, the CTO of a medium-sized enterprise, 
noticed that several software applications were not updated 
regularly, leading to potential security vulnerabilities. Upon 
	
 
96

investigation, he realized that no specific team or individual was 
assigned as the owner of these applications. To enhance 
security, what should Liam emphasize? 
(A)       Immediate decommissioning of all unowned 
applications 
(B)       Assignment of clear ownership to all business 
applications 
(C)       Conducting monthly vulnerability assessments on all 
applications 
(D)       Outsourcing the management of these applications to 
third-party vendors 
Explanation 44. Correct Answer: B. Assignment of clear 
ownership to all business applications. Assigning clear 
ownership ensures that there’s a designated team or individual 
responsible for the upkeep, updates, and security of an 
application. When there’s clear ownership, the owner has the 
accountability to maintain and secure the application, reducing 
the risk of oversights like missing updates. 
Option A is incorrect. Immediate decommissioning may not be 
practical or feasible, especially if the applications are critical to 
business operations. 
Option C is incorrect. While monthly vulnerability 
assessments can help identify security issues, they don’t address 
the root cause of the problem highlighted in the scenario – the 
lack of ownership and accountability. 
Option D is incorrect. Outsourcing may shift the responsibility, 
but it doesn’t ensure that the applications will be better managed 
	
 
97

or more secure. Ownership clarity is paramount, whether the 
management is internal or outsourced. 
Question 45. TechSoft Corp, a mid-sized software development 
firm, is relocating its main office to a new building. The 
management is concerned about potential threats after hours, 
particularly due to the increasing reports of cyber-espionage. 
They are evaluating different security measures. Which option 
would provide an immediate physical presence and deterrence 
during non-business hours? 
(A)       CCTV with motion detection 
(B)       Retinal scan at all entrances 
(C)       Security guard presence 
(D)       Reinforced doors and windows 
Explanation 45. Correct Answer: C. Security guard 
presence. A security guard provides a visible deterrent and 
immediate physical presence. This human element is invaluable 
in situations where an immediate response to threats, deterrence 
of potential intruders, or evaluation of suspicious activities is 
required, especially during non-business hours. 
Option A is incorrect. While CCTV with motion detection can 
monitor and alert on movement, it doesn’t provide the 
immediate human response and deterrence a security guard 
does. 
Option B is incorrect. A retinal scan is an authentication 
mechanism for controlling access. While it offers high security, 
it doesn’t offer the visible deterrence or immediate response of a 
security guard. 
	
 
98

Option D is incorrect. Reinforced doors and windows enhance 
the physical security of a building, but they don’t provide an 
active and visible human deterrence like a security guard. 
Question 46. Alice, a system administrator for a startup, is 
preparing to deploy a new website for her company. To ensure 
secure communications between the users and the website, she 
plans to obtain a digital certificate for the site. Before doing so, 
which step must Alice first undertake to get a certificate from a 
Certificate Authority (CA)? 
(A)       Generate a public-private key pair 
(B)       Submit her passport copy to the CA 
(C)       Download the latest CA root certificate 
(D)       Encrypt the website with symmetric encryption 
Explanation 46. Correct Answer: A. Generate a public-
private key pair. Before Alice can request a digital certificate 
from a CA, she must first generate a public-private key pair. 
Once this is done, she creates a Certificate Signing Request 
(CSR) containing her public key and some additional 
information. The CSR is then submitted to the CA for signing. 
Option B is incorrect. CAs do not typically require a passport 
copy for standard SSL/TLS certificates. They might have 
identity verification processes, but it’s usually for extended 
validation certificates. 
Option C is incorrect. While it may be necessary to trust a CA 
by downloading its root certificate, this is not the step required 
before requesting a digital certificate. 
	
 
99

Option D is incorrect. Symmetric encryption is unrelated to the 
process of obtaining a digital certificate. 
Question 47. Julia, a security administrator, is concerned about 
potential unauthorized access to confidential project files stored 
on a company server. She decides to place a document within 
the project folders that seems enticing but is actually monitored 
for access. This strategy aims to detect if someone is accessing 
files without authorization. What is this document commonly 
known as? 
(A)       Salt file 
(B)       Honeyfile 
(C)       Log file 
(D)       Backup file 
Explanation 47. Correct Answer: B. Honeyfile. A honeyfile is 
a monitored file placed intentionally to act as a decoy. If 
accessed, it can provide an alert that someone might be 
accessing files without proper authorization, or it might be an 
indication of a potential insider threat. 
Option A is incorrect. A salt is random data that is used as an 
additional input to a one-way function that hashes data or 
passwords. It isn’t a decoy file. 
Option C is incorrect. A log file records events in an operating 
system or other software to aid in troubleshooting and activity 
monitoring, but it isn’t used as a deceptive measure. 
	
 
100

Option D is incorrect. A backup file is a copy of a file or 
database that can be used for data recovery. It’s not a decoy to 
detect unauthorized access. 
Question 48. After a recent incident of vandalism, a corporate 
building is considering implementing security controls that 
would dissuade potential perpetrators. Which of the following 
would serve BEST as a deterrent control? 
(A)       Encrypting all stored data 
(B)       Installing biometric access controls on all entrances 
(C)       Implementing regular data backups 
(D)       Placing visible security signage indicating 24/7 
surveillance 
Explanation 48. Correct Answer: D. Placing visible security 
signage indicating 24/7 surveillance. Visible security signage 
serves as a deterrent control as it discourages potential 
perpetrators by signaling the risk of detection and 
consequences, even if actual surveillance might not be active at 
all times. 
Option A is incorrect. Encrypting all stored data is a preventive 
control that ensures unauthorized individuals cannot access or 
understand the encrypted information. It doesn’t deter acts of 
physical vandalism. 
Option B is incorrect. Installing biometric access controls is a 
preventive control that restricts physical access based on unique 
biological attributes. While it prevents unauthorized access, it 
doesn’t act as a visible deterrent to vandalism or other potential 
threats. 
	
 
101

Option C is incorrect. Implementing regular data backups is a 
corrective control designed to restore data after a security 
incident. It doesn’t deter potential threats. 
Question 49. Alice wants to access a restricted online portal. 
The portal asks her to enter a unique username and a secret 
passphrase only she should know. This process helps the system 
ensure that Alice is who she claims to be. What security concept 
is the portal employing? 
(A)       Authorization 
(B)       Accounting 
(C)       Multifactor authentication 
(D)       Authentication 
Explanation 49. Correct Answer: D. Authentication. 
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, 
system, or application. In the described scenario, Alice is 
proving her identity to the system by providing a unique 
username and a passphrase, which are credentials that 
supposedly only she possesses. 
Option A is incorrect. Authorization determines what actions, 
resources, or services a verified identity is allowed to access or 
perform. It does not deal with verifying the identity itself. 
Option B is incorrect. Accounting involves tracking user 
activities and recording them for audit purposes. It does not 
directly verify a user’s identity. 
Option C is incorrect. Multifactor authentication requires two 
or more methods of verification from different categories of 
	
 
102

credentials. The scenario only mentioned a username and 
passphrase, which is a single-factor authentication method. 
Question 50. Sophia, the cybersecurity lead at XYZ Corp, is in 
the process of drafting a new security policy. During the 
drafting process, she primarily consults with her security team. 
However, upon implementation, several departments pushed 
back due to the policy interfering with their operations. Which 
best describes the misstep Sophia made during the policy 
creation process? 
(A)       Not using a standardized security framework 
(B)       Over-reliance on automated security solutions 
(C)       Not including key stakeholders in the policy drafting 
process 
(D)       Focusing too much on external threats rather than 
internal ones 
Explanation 50. Correct Answer: C. Not including key 
stakeholders in the policy drafting process. Stakeholders 
from different departments provide crucial insights into how 
security measures can impact various operations and processes 
within an organization. By including them in the policy drafting 
process, Sophia would have received feedback that could have 
helped shape a policy that not only maintains security but also 
aligns with the needs of different departments. 
Option A is incorrect. While using a standardized security 
framework can provide guidance, it doesn’t necessarily account 
for the unique operational needs of different departments within 
an organization. 
	
 
103

Option B is incorrect. The scenario doesn’t mention any 
reliance, over or otherwise, on automated security solutions. 
Option D is incorrect. While both external and internal threats 
are crucial considerations, the primary issue here was the lack 
of consultation with key stakeholders. 
Question 51. BioGen Inc., a biotechnology company, has 
implemented a layered security approach. They are considering 
adding a human element to their security measures for their 
research labs. Which of the following would best provide the 
ability to evaluate and respond to various security situations 
with human judgment? 
(A)       Installing biometric locks 
(B)       Employing security guards 
(C)       Implementing an access control vestibule 
(D)       Deploying AI-driven security cameras 
Explanation 51. Correct Answer: B. Employing security 
guards. Security guards provide the advantage of human 
judgment and can evaluate, respond, and adapt to a wide variety 
of security situations, making them ideal for adding a human 
element to a layered security approach. 
Option A is incorrect. While biometric locks can control access 
based on unique human features, they don’t provide the 
evaluation and response capabilities of a human guard. 
Option C is incorrect. An access control vestibule controls 
access into an area, often with two sets of doors, but it does not 
	
 
104

provide the evaluation, judgment, or immediate response that a 
security guard does. 
Option D is incorrect. While AI-driven security cameras can 
provide advanced monitoring and potentially detect suspicious 
activities, they don’t replace the judgment and immediate 
response capabilities of a human security guard. 
Question 52. While analyzing server logs, Mike, an IT security 
analyst, noticed that an unfamiliar document was frequently 
accessed. Upon investigation, he realized that this document 
was deliberately placed by the security team and had no real 
data but was closely monitored. The purpose of this file is 
MOST likely: 
(A)       To serve as a redundancy copy in case of data loss 
(B)       To act as a decoy to attract and detect unauthorized 
access 
(C)       To maintain a record of all user activities for auditing 
(D)       To be encrypted and sent to clients as a sample 
Explanation 52. Correct Answer: B. To act as a decoy to 
attract and detect unauthorized access. Honeyfiles serve as 
deceptive measures, attracting potential malicious actors or 
unauthorized users. If such files are accessed, it can be an 
indication of unauthorized or suspicious activities in the system. 
Option A is incorrect. Redundancy copies or backups are 
created to prevent data loss due to unforeseen issues, but they 
are not monitored as decoys. 
	
 
105

Option C is incorrect. User activity logs maintain records of 
actions taken within a system or application, which is different 
from a deceptive measure like a honeyfile. 
Option D is incorrect. Files encrypted for client samples serve 
a different purpose and are not typically used as decoys to 
detect unauthorized access. 
Question 53. DataCenter Inc. is located in a region prone to 
protests and vandalism. They wish to enhance their perimeter 
security to deter potential intruders and make it visibly clear 
that unauthorized access is restricted. Which of the following 
physical security measures would be the most effective first line 
of defense for the company? 
(A)       Sliding Doors 
(B)       Security Cameras 
(C)       High-security Fencing 
(D)       Proximity Card Readers 
Explanation 53. Correct Answer: C. High-security Fencing. 
High-security fencing is a primary physical barrier that serves to 
deter, delay, and detect intrusions. It provides a clear visual 
indicator that delineates private property and can be equipped 
with additional deterrents such as barbed wire or sensors. 
Especially in areas prone to vandalism or protests, a robust 
fence acts as an immediate barrier to unauthorized access. 
Option A is incorrect. Sliding doors are more applicable to 
internal security or entrance points and do not serve as a 
primary external barrier. 
	
 
106

Option B is incorrect. While security cameras monitor and 
record activities, they do not serve as a physical barrier to 
prevent or deter unauthorized access. 
Option D is incorrect. Proximity card readers are a form of 
access control that checks the credentials of individuals but do 
not serve as a primary deterrent against vandalism or protests. 
Question 54. SecureTech Corp, a company dealing with 
sensitive client data, is redesigning its main office entrance to 
enhance security. They want to ensure that only one person 
gains access at a time, even if multiple people try to enter using 
a single authorized access badge. Which of the following would 
best serve this purpose? 
(A)       CCTV Cameras 
(B)       Mantrap 
(C)       Biometric Scanners 
(D)       Motion Detectors 
Explanation 54. Correct Answer: B. Mantrap. A mantrap, 
also known as an access control vestibule, is a physical security 
access control system comprising a small space with two sets of 
interlocking doors. The first door must close before the second 
door opens, ensuring that only one person can pass through at a 
time. This design prevents tailgating or piggybacking, where 
unauthorized individuals attempt to enter a secure area by 
following closely behind an authorized individual. 
Option A is incorrect. While CCTV cameras monitor and 
record activities, they do not physically prevent multiple people 
from entering at once using a single access badge. 
	
 
107

Option C is incorrect. Biometric scanners provide a means of 
authenticating individuals based on unique physical or 
behavioral characteristics, but they do not prevent tailgating on 
their own. 
Option D is incorrect. Motion detectors can detect movement 
but do not restrict the entry of multiple individuals trying to use 
a single authorized access badge. 
Question 55. While setting up a new internal web application, 
Laura, a system administrator, decides to use a digital certificate 
for SSL/TLS encryption. Due to budget constraints, she can’t 
procure a certificate from a commercial Certificate Authority 
(CA). Which of the following would be a viable option for 
Laura to secure the application? 
(A)       Rely on plaintext HTTP for the application 
(B)       Obtain a certificate from a free Certificate Authority 
(C)       Generate a self-signed certificate 
(D)       Use a shared certificate from another application 
Explanation 55. Correct Answer: C. Generate a self-signed 
certificate. A self-signed certificate can be generated by Laura 
without the need for a Certificate Authority. While self-signed 
certificates can cause trust issues in public-facing applications 
(since they aren’t signed by a recognized CA), they can be 
appropriate for internal applications where users can be 
informed and trust can be established manually. 
Option A is incorrect. Relying on plaintext HTTP doesn’t 
provide any encryption or security for the application, leaving it 
vulnerable to various attacks. 
	
 
108

Option B is incorrect. While obtaining a certificate from a free 
Certificate Authority is a valid option, it wasn’t the best choice 
given the specific scenario which emphasizes not using a CA. 
Option D is incorrect. Using a shared certificate from another 
application can introduce security risks and is not a 
recommended practice. 
Question 56. A network administrator has received a new 
security patch for a mission-critical application. Which of the 
following is the BEST action to take before applying this patch 
in the live environment? 
(A)       Apply the patch immediately to ensure system security 
(B)       Notify all users about the upcoming downtime due to 
the patch 
(C)       Test the patch in a separate testing environment 
(D)       Take a backup of only the mission-critical application 
Explanation 56. Correct Answer: C. Test the patch in a 
separate testing environment. Testing any changes, including 
patches, in a separate environment before deploying them to 
production is essential to ensure there are no unintended 
technical implications. This is a key aspect of change 
management processes and helps prevent system outages or 
vulnerabilities from being introduced. 
Option A is incorrect. While applying patches is crucial for 
maintaining security, doing so immediately without proper 
testing can lead to unforeseen technical problems. 
	
 
109

Option B is incorrect. Notifying users is important, but it’s 
premature to notify them without first testing the patch. 
Option D is incorrect. Taking a backup is a good practice, but 
it is not a substitute for testing the patch first. 
Question 57. After implementing a major security update to its 
database system, TechCo experienced unexpected downtime 
and system incompatibilities. The CISO wants to ensure that 
such incidents can be quickly addressed in the future. Which of 
the following should TechCo have had in place before 
deploying the update to mitigate the impact of these kinds of 
incidents? 
(A)       A comprehensive list of all updates 
(B)       An automated system recovery tool 
(C)       A backout plan 
(D)       A detailed user manual for the update 
Explanation 57. Correct Answer: C. A backout plan. A 
backout plan is a pre-arranged strategy or set of procedures to 
reverse changes made to the system in case the changes have 
adverse effects. In scenarios like this, where a significant update 
causes unintended problems, a backout plan would allow the 
organization to revert the system to its previous stable state 
quickly. 
Option A is incorrect. While having a comprehensive list of all 
updates is good for documentation and auditing purposes, it 
would not directly help in mitigating the effects of an adverse 
update. 
	
 
110

Option B is incorrect. An automated system recovery tool 
might assist in reverting changes or recovering the system. 
However, a backout plan is more specific to undoing changes 
made during an update or change process, making it more 
suitable in this context. 
Option D is incorrect. A detailed user manual for the update is 
beneficial for training and troubleshooting, but it wouldn’t serve 
the direct purpose of reverting unintended adverse changes. 
Question 58. A financial institution processes thousands of 
credit card transactions daily. To ensure the security and 
integrity of these transactions, the security officer wants to 
employ a solution that will safely manage and store 
cryptographic keys. Which of the following would be the 
MOST suitable solution? 
(A)       Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 
(B)       Full Disk Encryption (FDE) 
(C)       Hardware Security Module (HSM) 
(D)       Software Key Repository 
Explanation 58. Correct Answer: C. Hardware Security 
Module (HSM). Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) are 
physical devices specifically designed to manage, process, and 
store cryptographic keys. They provide a high level of 
protection against both physical and logical attacks and are 
commonly used by financial institutions to ensure the security 
of high-value transactions. 
Option A is incorrect. While TPMs provide hardware-level 
security for individual devices, they are not designed for the 
	
 
111

high-capacity cryptographic needs of an institution processing 
numerous transactions. 
Option B is incorrect. Full Disk Encryption (FDE) secures data 
at rest on a hard drive but doesn’t specifically manage 
cryptographic keys used in transaction processing. 
Option D is incorrect. While a software key repository can 
store cryptographic keys, it lacks the same level of physical and 
logical protection provided by an HSM. 
Question 59. During the setup of a secure communication 
channel, Alice and Bob need to agree upon a shared secret key 
without sending the key directly to each other, as they fear 
eavesdropping. Which protocol would best facilitate this 
requirement? 
(A)       RSA 
(B)       HMAC 
(C)       Diffie-Hellman 
(D)       AES 
Explanation 59. Correct Answer: C. Diffie-Hellman. The 
Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol allows two parties to 
each generate public and private key pairs, exchange the public 
keys, and then derive a shared secret key. This secret key can 
then be used for symmetric encryption. The beauty of this 
protocol is that the shared secret can be derived without directly 
sending it over the communication channel, preventing 
eavesdroppers from obtaining the secret key directly. 
	
 
112

Option A is incorrect. RSA is an asymmetric encryption 
method, not a key exchange protocol. 
Option B is incorrect. HMAC is a specific type of message 
authentication code that involves hashing and is not used for 
key exchange. 
Option D is incorrect. AES is a symmetric encryption 
algorithm and does not offer a key exchange mechanism. 
Question 60. A company is developing a new video 
conferencing tool. They want to make sure that all video and 
audio data transmitted between participants are encrypted and 
protected from eavesdropping. Which type of encryption should 
the developers implement to achieve this? 
(A)       Endpoint Encryption 
(B)       Transport-layer Encryption 
(C)       Volume-level Encryption 
(D)       Database-level EncryptionAccess Control 
Explanation 60. Correct Answer: B. Transport-layer 
Encryption. Transport-layer Encryption is tailored for securing 
data while it’s in transit. By implementing this encryption, the 
company ensures that all video and audio data during the video 
conference are confidential, maintaining the privacy of the 
participants. 
Option A is incorrect. Endpoint Encryption is designed for data 
on specific devices like laptops or mobile phones, not for data 
being transmitted over networks. 
	
 
113

Option C is incorrect. Volume-level Encryption pertains to 
encrypting specific logical drives or volumes, not data in transit. 
Option D is incorrect. Database-level Encryption secures data 
within a database and is not specific to data transmission over 
networks. 
Question 61. After a significant cybersecurity incident, ABC 
Tech revamped its incident response procedures. However, the 
documentation was not updated to reflect these changes. During 
a subsequent minor incident, there was confusion regarding the 
steps to be followed. Which of the following is the MOST direct 
implication of not updating the incident response 
documentation? 
(A)       The company may have to invest in new cybersecurity 
tools 
(B)       Stakeholders might lose trust in the company’s ability to 
handle incidents 
(C)       Incident response might be inconsistent and less 
effective 
(D)       ABC Tech may have to hire external consultants for 
incident response 
Explanation 61. Correct Answer: C. Incident response 
might be inconsistent and less effective. Without up-to-date 
documentation reflecting the most recent incident response 
procedures, there’s a risk that the response will be inconsistent, 
leading to inefficiencies and potential oversights. 
	
 
114

Option A is incorrect. While new tools might be beneficial, the 
direct concern with outdated documentation is the effectiveness 
of the response. 
Option B is incorrect. While stakeholder trust is important, the 
immediate implication of outdated documentation is the quality 
of the incident response. 
Option D is incorrect. Hiring external consultants might be an 
option, but the direct consequence of outdated documentation is 
the potential ineffectiveness of the internal response process. 
Question 62. A financial organization is considering 
implementing a system that allows all users to view all 
transactions, but once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be 
altered or deleted. They want this transparency to foster trust 
among their users. Which of the following would best meet this 
requirement? 
(A)       Digital certificate 
(B)       Open public ledger 
(C)       Symmetric encryption 
(D)       Secure file transfer protocol 
Explanation 62. Correct Answer: B. Open public ledger. An 
open public ledger provides transparency by allowing all users 
to view all transactions. Moreover, once a transaction is added 
to the ledger, it becomes immutable, meaning it cannot be 
altered or deleted, ensuring data integrity and fostering trust 
among participants. 
	
 
115

Option A is incorrect. A digital certificate is used to verify the 
identity of an entity and bind a public key to it, but it doesn’t 
offer the transparency of transactions or their immutability. 
Option C is incorrect. Symmetric encryption is used to encrypt 
and decrypt data using a single secret key, but it doesn’t provide 
transaction transparency or immutability. 
Option D is incorrect. Secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) is a 
method to securely transfer files over a network, but it doesn’t 
maintain an open public ledger of transactions. 
Question 63. A company is implementing a system to ensure 
that code released to production is both unaltered and approved 
by a specific team member. Which of the following 
cryptographic techniques should they implement? 
(A)       Symmetric encryption of the code 
(B)       Hashing the code with SHA-256 
(C)       Encrypting the code with the team member's public key 
(D)       Digital signature by the team member 
Explanation 63. Correct Answer: D. Digital signature by the 
team member. Digital signatures provide both integrity and 
non-repudiation. By having the specific team member digitally 
sign the code, the company can ensure that the code has not 
been altered (integrity) and that it was approved by the 
designated individual (non-repudiation). 
Option A is incorrect. Symmetric encryption provides 
confidentiality, but it doesn’t provide the needed integrity and 
non-repudiation in this scenario. 
	
 
116

Option B is incorrect. Hashing the code provides a mechanism 
to check for alterations (integrity), but it does not provide non-
repudiation or evidence of the specific team member’s approval. 
Option C is incorrect. Encrypting with the team member’s 
public key doesn’t provide non-repudiation. Moreover, only the 
team member with the corresponding private key would be able 
to decrypt it, which might not be desirable for production 
releases. 
Question 64. Your company has recently deployed an update to 
its CRM application. Post-update, users are experiencing 
connectivity issues. As a security administrator, which of the 
following steps should you take FIRST to address the 
connectivity problem without causing data loss? 
(A)       Restart the application immediately 
(B)       Disconnect all users and then restart the application 
(C)       Validate the update's integrity and then restart the 
application 
(D)       Reinstall the previous version of the CRM application 
Explanation 64. Correct Answer: C. Validate the update’s 
integrity and then restart the application. Before making any 
changes, it’s essential to ensure the update’s integrity. This 
means confirming that the update was correctly applied and that 
there were no issues during its installation. Once the update’s 
integrity is confirmed, a restart can help apply any changes that 
may not have taken effect immediately. 
	
 
117

Option A is incorrect. Restarting the application immediately 
without validation might cause further complications if the 
update was not correctly applied. 
Option B is incorrect. While disconnecting users might be 
necessary at some point, doing so without validating the 
update’s integrity can result in further disruptions. 
Option D is incorrect. Reinstalling the previous version is a 
drastic step and might not be necessary if the update’s integrity 
can be validated and issues resolved with a restart. 
Question 65. TechDynamics, a growing tech startup, plans to 
scale its operations and serve a global clientele. Given that their 
client base operates in multiple time zones, when should 
TechDynamics schedule their system maintenance to ensure 
minimal disruption? 
(A)       During the busiest hours for their headquarters' local 
time 
(B)       Staggered based on the peak hours of their global clients 
(C)       Only when a system breakdown occurs 
(D)       Establish a consistent maintenance window during 
off-peak hours for the majority of their clientele 
Explanation 65. Correct Answer: D. Establish a consistent 
maintenance window during off-peak hours for the majority 
of their clientele. When serving a global clientele operating in 
various time zones, it’s crucial to establish a maintenance 
window during hours when the majority of clients are least 
active. This minimizes disruptions and ensures smooth 
operations for most clients. 
	
 
118

Option A is incorrect. Focusing only on the headquarters’ local 
time disregards the operational hours of global clients. This 
approach might cause disruptions for clients in other time 
zones. 
Option B is incorrect. While staggering maintenance based on 
peak hours of global clients seems logical, it could lead to a 
complex and hard-to-manage maintenance schedule, especially 
as the client base grows. 
Option C is incorrect. Waiting for a system breakdown to 
perform maintenance is reactive rather than proactive. This 
approach might lead to more extended and unpredictable 
downtimes, resulting in greater disruptions and potential 
security risks.  
Question 66. During an IT audit, a company’s encryption 
practices come under scrutiny. The IT auditor recommends 
increasing the encryption key length for certain applications to 
improve security. What is the PRIMARY reason to increase the 
encryption key length? 
(A)       To speed up encryption and decryption processes 
(B)       To ensure compatibility with older systems 
(C)       To reduce the possibility of a brute force attack 
(D)       To reduce the key management overhead 
Explanation 66. Correct Answer: C. To reduce the 
possibility of a brute force attack. Increasing the encryption 
key length primarily enhances the security of the encryption by 
making it more resistant to brute-force attacks. A brute force 
attack involves trying all possible key combinations, and a 
	
 
119

longer key length means exponentially more possible 
combinations, making the attack vastly more time-consuming 
and difficult. 
Option A is incorrect. Longer key lengths generally slow down 
the encryption and decryption processes, as more computational 
power is required. 
Option B is incorrect. Increasing key length might make the 
encryption incompatible with older systems that do not support 
the newer, longer key lengths. 
Option D is incorrect. Key management overhead typically 
increases with longer key lengths, as more data must be 
managed and kept secure. 
Question 67. Sarah is working on a project where she needs to 
validate the integrity and authenticity of assets over time, 
without a centralized authority. Which technology would be 
most appropriate for this use case? 
(A)       Digital signature 
(B)       Key escrow 
(C)       Blockchain 
(D)       Key management system 
Explanation 67. Correct Answer: C. Blockchain. Blockchain 
technology allows for the validation of the integrity and 
authenticity of assets over time in a decentralized manner. Each 
transaction or asset is verified by the network’s participants and 
added to the chain, ensuring its authenticity and making it 
tamper-evident. 
	
 
120

Option A is incorrect. While digital signatures can validate the 
authenticity and integrity of a message or document, they do not 
provide a decentralized ledger of assets over time. 
Option B is incorrect. Key escrow is a method where 
cryptographic keys are held in trust so that a third party can 
have access under certain conditions. It doesn’t help in 
validating the integrity and authenticity of assets over time 
without central authority. 
Option D is incorrect. A key management system manages the 
life cycle of cryptographic keys but does not inherently validate 
the integrity and authenticity of assets over time. 
Question 68. A graphic design company frequently works with 
large files such as videos and high-resolution images. These 
files are stored on a dedicated storage volume in their server. 
While they need to secure this data, they don’t want to encrypt 
individual files due to the volume of data and frequent access 
needs. Which encryption approach is most appropriate for this 
scenario? 
(A)       File-level Encryption 
(B)       Full-disk Encryption 
(C)       Transport-layer Encryption 
(D)       Volume-level Encryption 
Explanation 68. Correct Answer: D. Volume-level 
Encryption. Volume-level Encryption allows the encryption of 
a specific volume or logical drive. In this case, it would allow 
the company to encrypt the entire volume where these large 
files are stored without having to encrypt individual files. This 
	
 
121

ensures the entire volume’s contents are encrypted while 
providing seamless access when required. 
Option A is incorrect. File-level Encryption, while effective, 
would be tedious for encrypting numerous large files 
individually. 
Option B is incorrect. Full-disk Encryption would encrypt the 
entire disk, which may not be necessary if only a specific 
volume requires encryption. 
Option C is incorrect. Transport-layer Encryption pertains to 
data in transit and doesn’t address the need of encrypting stored 
data at the volume level. 
Question 69. An e-commerce company stores millions of 
customer transaction records in their primary database. They 
have decided to enhance their security posture by applying 
encryption to protect sensitive data. However, they don’t want 
to encrypt the entire server storage, just the data within the 
database. Which encryption approach should the company adopt 
to meet their objective? 
(A)       Full-disk Encryption 
(B)       File-level Encryption 
(C)       Volume-level Encryption 
(D)       Database-level Encryption 
Explanation 69. Correct Answer: D. Database-level 
Encryption. Database-level Encryption provides encryption 
	
 
122

specifically for data within a database. It ensures that the data 
remains encrypted even when backed up, replicated, or moved. 
This approach is ideal for the e-commerce company as it 
focuses on encrypting the sensitive transaction records without 
affecting other data on the server. 
Option A is incorrect. Full-disk Encryption would encrypt the 
entire server’s storage, which may not be required by the 
company. 
Option B is incorrect. File-level Encryption would require 
encrypting individual files, which may not be efficient for a 
database with millions of records. 
Option C is incorrect. Volume-level Encryption encrypts 
specific volumes or logical drives, not just the database data. 
Question 70. Your organization plans to upgrade its database 
system. To maintain security during this process, which of the 
following actions should be RESTRICTED until the upgrade is 
validated? 
(A)       Monitoring the database for any anomalies 
(B)       Allowing end-users to access the upgraded database 
(C)       Making regular backups of the database 
(D)       Reviewing the database system logs 
Explanation 70. Correct Answer: B. Allowing end-users to 
access the upgraded database. Until the upgraded system is 
validated and any potential issues are addressed, end-user 
access should be restricted. This ensures that any vulnerabilities 
	
 
123

or problems introduced by the upgrade don’t compromise data 
or allow unauthorized activities. 
Option A is incorrect. Monitoring the database is crucial to 
identify any potential security issues and should not be 
restricted. 
Option C is incorrect. Regular backups should continue, as 
they are part of a comprehensive disaster recovery and data 
protection strategy. 
Option D is incorrect. Reviewing logs is essential to monitor 
the system’s health and security; hence, it should not be 
restricted. 
Question 71. A journalist wants to send a confidential message 
to her editor without raising suspicion. Instead of sending a 
coded or encrypted text, she embeds the message within a 
harmless-looking photograph. What method is she employing to 
keep the message concealed? 
(A)       Digital signature 
(B)       Tunneling 
(C)       Steganography 
(D)       Chaining 
Explanation 71. Correct Answer: C. Steganography. 
Steganography is a technique used to conceal data within 
another piece of data. In this scenario, the journalist is 
embedding a confidential message within a photograph, making 
it look harmless and unsuspicious. 
	
 
124

Option A is incorrect. A digital signature is used to verify the 
authenticity and integrity of a message or document. It doesn’t 
hide information within another piece of data. 
Option B is incorrect. Tunneling is a method used to 
encapsulate one protocol within another, typically used in VPNs 
to transport data over a public network. 
Option D is incorrect. Chaining in the context of cryptography 
often refers to modes of operation like Cipher Block Chaining 
(CBC). It doesn’t involve hiding data within other data. 
Question 72. A security administrator needs to apply a 
configuration change to a critical service, requiring a service 
restart. Before initiating the restart, which of the following steps 
is MOST important to ensure continuous service availability? 
(A)       Implement automatic service restart on failure 
(B)       Announce the restart to all company employees 
(C)       Schedule the restart during off-peak hours 
(D)       Take a backup of the current service configuration 
Explanation 72. Correct Answer: A. Implement automatic 
service restart on failure. Having an automatic service restart 
on failure ensures that if any issues arise after applying the 
configuration change, the service will attempt to restart itself, 
ensuring minimal interruption to its availability. 
Option B is incorrect. While notifying company employees is 
good practice, it doesn’t directly ensure continuous service 
availability. 
	
 
125

Option C is incorrect. Scheduling during off-peak hours 
minimizes impact but doesn’t ensure the service will be 
available if issues arise post-restart. 
Option D is incorrect. While taking a backup of the 
configuration is crucial for rollback purposes, it doesn’t ensure 
the service will remain available immediately post-restart. 
Question 73. A security analyst at DataCorp is tasked with 
preventing unauthorized external applications from connecting 
to their server. Which approach should the analyst primarily rely 
on to achieve this? 
(A)       Implement an allow list for approved applications 
(B)       Monitor server CPU usage 
(C)       Regularly patch server software 
(D)       Encrypt data at rest on the server 
Explanation 73. Correct Answer: A. Implement an allow list 
for approved applications. By implementing an allow list, the 
analyst can specify which applications are authorized to connect 
to the server. Any application not on the list will be prevented 
from establishing a connection, effectively stopping 
unauthorized external applications. 
Option B is incorrect. While monitoring server CPU usage can 
provide insights into the server’s performance and potential 
anomalies, it doesn’t prevent unauthorized applications from 
connecting. 
Option C is incorrect. Regularly patching server software is a 
best practice for security to fix known vulnerabilities. However, 
	
 
126

patching doesn’t directly prevent specific external applications 
from connecting. 
Option D is incorrect. Encrypting data at rest helps protect 
stored data from unauthorized access but does not regulate 
which applications can connect to the server. 
Question 74. Alice needs to provide proof of the authenticity of 
a digital document she’s sending to Bob. Which of the 
following cryptographic elements should Alice use to 
accomplish this task and ensure Bob knows the document came 
from her? 
(A)       Encrypt the document with Bob's private key 
(B)       Encrypt the document with her public key 
(C)       Sign the document with her private key 
(D)       Sign the document with Bob's public key 
Explanation 74. Correct Answer: C. Sign the document with 
her private key. To prove authenticity, a digital signature is 
created using the sender’s private key. When Bob receives the 
document, he can verify the signature using Alice’s public key. 
This proves that the document was signed by Alice and has not 
been tampered with during transit. 
Option A is incorrect. Bob’s private key is known only to Bob 
and should never be used by anyone else, including for 
encryption. 
Option B is incorrect. Encrypting with Alice’s public key 
doesn’t prove authenticity. It would also mean only Alice’s 
private key could decrypt it, which isn’t the intent. 
	
 
127

Option D is incorrect. One does not sign documents with the 
recipient’s public key. Signatures are created using the sender’s 
private key. 
Question 75. Carla, a security analyst, receives an alert that one 
of the company’s server certificates may have been exposed in a 
recent data breach. What is the most immediate action Carla 
should take to ensure that the exposed certificate cannot be used 
maliciously? 
(A)       Request a new certificate from the CA 
(B)       Update the company firewall rules 
(C)       Add the certificate to the Certificate revocation list 
(CRL) 
(D)       Perform a vulnerability assessment on the server 
Explanation 75. Correct Answer: C. Add the certificate to 
the Certificate revocation list (CRL). If a certificate is 
believed to be compromised, the most immediate action is to 
revoke it. This is done by adding the certificate to the Certificate 
revocation list (CRL). Systems and applications that check the 
CRL before establishing secure communications will then know 
not to trust the compromised certificate. 
Option A is incorrect. While requesting a new certificate may 
be necessary after revoking the compromised one, the 
immediate action should be revoking the potentially 
compromised certificate. 
Option B is incorrect. Updating firewall rules, while essential 
for many security scenarios, doesn’t directly address the misuse 
of a potentially exposed certificate. 
	
 
128

Option D is incorrect. A vulnerability assessment is a broader 
action to identify weaknesses in the system. While valuable, it 
doesn’t directly address the issue of the compromised 
certificate. 
Question 76. A database administrator is concerned about 
identical hashes being produced for users who select the same 
password. To mitigate this risk, what cryptographic technique 
should the administrator implement? 
(A)       Digital signature 
(B)       Salting 
(C)       Key stretching 
(D)       Symmetric encryption 
Explanation 76. Correct Answer: B. Salting. Salting involves 
adding a random value to a password before hashing it. This 
ensures that even if two users have the same password, their 
hashes will be different because of the unique salts. This makes 
it difficult for attackers to use precomputed tables (like rainbow 
tables) to match hashes to possible plaintext passwords. 
Option A is incorrect. Digital signatures are primarily used to 
ensure the authenticity and integrity of a message or data, not 
for hashing passwords. 
Option C is incorrect. Key stretching involves repeating the 
hashing process multiple times to make brute-force attacks 
more challenging, but it doesn’t address the problem of identical 
hashes for identical passwords. 
	
 
129

Option D is incorrect. Symmetric encryption uses the same 
key for both encryption and decryption and isn’t related to the 
scenario of producing unique hashes for passwords. 
Question 77. An online retailer is considering various methods 
to protect its customers’ credit card information. Instead of 
storing the actual credit card numbers in their database, they opt 
for a solution that replaces the numbers with unrelated, random 
values. What is this method called? 
(A)       Symmetric encryption 
(B)       Digital watermarking 
(C)       Hashing 
(D)       Tokenization 
Explanation 77. Correct Answer: D. Tokenization. 
Tokenization is a method where sensitive data is replaced with 
non-sensitive substitutes, referred to as “tokens”. These tokens 
act as references to the original data but don’t contain the actual 
sensitive data, making it a preferred method for protecting 
credit card information in many retail environments. 
Option A is incorrect. Symmetric encryption is a method of 
encrypting data using a single key for both encryption and 
decryption. It changes the original data into a ciphered format 
but doesn’t replace it with random values as tokenization does. 
Option B is incorrect. Digital watermarking embeds data into a 
digital signal, primarily for asserting rights or ownership and 
not for replacing sensitive data with random values. 
	
 
130

Option C is incorrect. Hashing converts input data into a 
fixed-length string of characters, which is typically a hash 
code. It doesn’t produce a random value that can be used as 
a reference back to the original data.  
Question 78. During a scheduled maintenance window, a 
security administrator plans to apply a critical update to the 
company’s firewall. Which of the following actions is MOST 
crucial to ensure minimized downtime during this process? 
(A)       Notifying the firewall vendor about the update 
(B)       Disabling all firewall rules temporarily 
(C)       Creating a rollback plan in case of update failure 
(D)       Scheduling the update during peak business hours 
Explanation 78. Correct Answer: C. Creating a rollback 
plan in case of update failure. In change management 
processes, having a rollback plan ensures that if there are issues 
with the applied update, the system can be reverted to its 
previous state, thereby minimizing downtime. 
Option A is incorrect. While it might be useful to notify the 
firewall vendor, it is not the most crucial step to minimize 
downtime. 
Option B is incorrect. Disabling all firewall rules can introduce 
significant security risks and might not be related directly to the 
downtime. 
Option D is incorrect. Scheduling updates during peak 
business hours could result in maximum disruption and 
downtime. 
	
 
131

Question 79. A security administrator is considering a 
cryptographic solution for protecting data in transit between two 
servers located in the same data center. The primary goal is to 
ensure speed and efficiency in encryption and decryption 
processes. Which type of encryption would best meet this 
requirement? 
(A)       Asymmetric encryption using RSA 
(B)       Symmetric encryption using AES 
(C)       Hybrid encryption using a combination of RSA and 
AES 
(D)       Asymmetric encryption using ECC 
Explanation 79. Correct Answer: B. Symmetric encryption 
using AES. Symmetric encryption, such as AES, is typically 
faster and requires less computational resources than 
asymmetric encryption. This makes it suitable for scenarios 
where high-speed encryption and decryption are essential, like 
for data in transit between servers in a data center. 
Option A is incorrect. Asymmetric encryption using RSA is 
more computationally intensive than symmetric encryption and 
may not be the most efficient for the given scenario. 
Option C is incorrect. While hybrid encryption can provide a 
balance of security and speed, using only symmetric encryption 
(AES) is more efficient for the described use case. 
Option D is incorrect. ECC, like RSA, is an asymmetric 
encryption method, which means it will typically be slower than 
symmetric methods like AES. 
	
 
132

Question 80. A software developer wants to store user 
passwords in a way that even if the database is compromised, 
attackers would not be able to retrieve the original passwords. 
What technique should the developer use to achieve this? 
(A)       Symmetric encryption 
(B)       Digital signing 
(C)       Hashing 
(D)       Steganography 
Explanation 80. Correct Answer: C. Hashing. Hashing is a 
technique that takes an input (or ‘message’) and returns a fixed-
size string of bytes, usually in the form of a digest. The output 
should ideally be unique (within reason) for every different 
input. It’s often used for storing passwords because even a tiny 
change in input will produce a dramatically different output, and 
it’s computationally hard to reverse the process. 
Option A is incorrect. Symmetric encryption uses the same key 
for both encryption and decryption. If an attacker gains access 
to the encryption key, they can decrypt any encrypted data. 
Option B is incorrect. Digital signing is used to verify the 
integrity and authenticity of a message but does not hide the 
original content. 
Option D is incorrect. Steganography involves hiding 
information within other information, which isn’t related to 
securely storing passwords. 
Question 81. A software development company is working on a 
mobile banking application. They want to ensure that sensitive 
	
 
133

operations like cryptographic processes and biometric data 
validation are isolated from the main operating system to 
prevent potential tampering. Which tool should they consider 
implementing to achieve this objective? 
(A)       Hardware Security Module (HSM) 
(B)       Key Management System (KMS) 
(C)       Secure enclave 
(D)       Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 
Explanation 81. Correct Answer: C. Secure enclave. A 
secure enclave is a hardware-based isolated environment often 
found in modern CPUs, especially in mobile devices. It’s 
designed to run specific operations such as cryptographic 
processes and biometric data validation, ensuring that this data 
is kept isolated from the main operating system, making it 
resilient to tampering. 
Option A is incorrect. While an HSM is a dedicated hardware 
device that manages cryptographic keys, it doesn’t provide the 
isolated environment within a CPU for operations like the 
secure enclave does. 
Option B is incorrect. KMS is primarily focused on the 
management of cryptographic keys, not on creating isolated 
environments for operations. 
Option D is incorrect. TPM provides hardware-level security 
for individual devices, but it doesn’t create a segregated 
environment within the CPU for operations like the secure 
enclave.

Question 82. A web server hosting the company’s e-commerce 
site is set for an OS upgrade. The upgrade is expected to last 30 
minutes. What should be a primary consideration to minimize 
customer impact due to potential downtime? 
(A)       Implementing a load balancer 
(B)       Taking a backup of the e-commerce site 
(C)       Posting a maintenance notice a week in advance 
(D)       Upgrading the server's hardware 
Explanation 82. Correct Answer: A. Implementing a load 
balancer. A load balancer can redirect traffic to other servers 
while one is undergoing maintenance, ensuring that customers 
can still access the e-commerce site and minimizing the impact 
of downtime. Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across 
multiple servers, allowing one server to be taken offline without 
affecting the availability of the service. 
Option B is incorrect. While backups are crucial for disaster 
recovery, they don’t minimize immediate downtime during 
upgrades. 
Option C is incorrect. While informing customers is a good 
practice, it doesn’t prevent downtime. Some customers may still 
try to access the site during maintenance. 
Option D is incorrect. Upgrading the server’s hardware might 
improve performance but doesn’t directly minimize the 
downtime caused by an OS upgrade. 
Question 83. A project manager is working on a new product 
launch and has documents with sensitive financial projections 
	
 
135

on her local computer. She occasionally shares these documents 
with select board members via email. While she wants to keep 
the financial documents secure, she doesn’t want to encrypt all 
the data on her computer. Which encryption approach should 
she utilize? 
(A)       Full-disk Encryption 
(B)       Transport-layer Encryption 
(C)       File-level Encryption 
(D)       Partition Encryption 
Explanation 83. Correct Answer: C. File-level Encryption. 
File-level Encryption allows individual files or folders to be 
encrypted. In this scenario, the project manager can encrypt 
only the sensitive financial documents, allowing her to securely 
share them while keeping the rest of her data unencrypted. 
Option A is incorrect. Full-disk Encryption would encrypt the 
entire drive, which is more than what’s required. 
Option B is incorrect. Transport-layer Encryption protects data 
in transit, but does not specifically address encrypting 
individual files for storage and sharing. 
Option D is incorrect. Partition Encryption encrypts entire 
partitions or volumes, which isn’t necessary in this scenario. 
Question 84. A security analyst is evaluating security 
enhancements for a series of laptops that will store highly 
confidential data. The analyst wants to ensure that stored data 
remains encrypted and the integrity of the boot process is 
maintained. Which of the following would BEST meet this 
	
 
136

requirement? 
(A)       Installing antivirus software on each laptop 
(B)       Enabling a software-based full-disk encryption 
(C)       Implementing a BIOS password 
(D)       Utilizing a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 
Explanation 84. Correct Answer: D. Utilizing a Trusted 
Platform Module (TPM). A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 
is a specialized chip on an endpoint device that stores RSA 
encryption keys specific to the host system. It provides 
hardware-based security to enhance the security of the device 
by enabling features like hardware-based encryption and 
ensuring the integrity of the boot process, among other things. 
Option A is incorrect. While antivirus software is vital for 
protecting against malware, it does not directly address 
hardware-based encryption or boot process integrity. 
Option B is incorrect. Software-based full-disk encryption can 
ensure the confidentiality of data, but it does not offer 
hardware-level protection or boot process integrity like a TPM. 
Option C is incorrect. A BIOS password provides a layer of 
security, but it does not offer encryption for stored data or 
ensure boot process integrity. 
Question 85. A large e-commerce company is deploying a new 
online payment system. The Chief Information Security Officer 
(CISO) is concerned about the security of cryptographic keys 
and wants to ensure they are protected from potential theft or 
compromise. Which tool should the CISO implement to provide 
	
 
137

the HIGHEST level of security for these keys? 
(A)       Password vault 
(B)       Software-based key storage 
(C)       Hardware Security Module (HSM) 
(D)       Cloud-based encryption service 
Explanation 85. Correct Answer: C. Hardware Security 
Module (HSM). A Hardware Security Module (HSM) is a 
specialized device specifically designed to manage, protect, and 
securely store cryptographic keys. It is built to be tamper-
resistant and provides a high level of security, making it suitable 
for environments where the protection of cryptographic keys is 
of paramount importance, such as in an e-commerce payment 
system. 
Option A is incorrect. A password vault is designed primarily 
for storing and managing passwords, not cryptographic keys 
used in payment systems. 
Option B is incorrect. Software-based key storage solutions do 
not provide the same level of physical security that an HSM 
offers. 
Option D is incorrect. While cloud-based encryption services 
can provide encryption capabilities, they might not offer the 
same level of physical protection and control as an on-premises 
HSM. 
Question 86. Sarah, a security analyst, is concerned about 
potential man-in-the-middle attacks on the company’s internal 
portal. To mitigate this risk, she recommends obtaining a digital 
	
 
138

certificate from a trusted entity. Which of the following is 
responsible for issuing such certificates? 
(A)       Key distribution center 
(B)       Certificate authority (CA) 
(C)       Tokenization system 
(D)       Security incident event manager 
Explanation 86. Correct Answer: B. Certificate authority 
(CA). Certificate authorities (CAs) are trusted entities 
responsible for issuing, validating, and revoking digital 
certificates. These certificates are used to authenticate entities 
on the internet, such as websites, ensuring secure and 
authenticated communications, thus mitigating the risk of man-
in-the-middle attacks. 
Option A is incorrect. A Key distribution center (KDC) is a 
part of the Kerberos authentication protocol and is responsible 
for distributing session tickets and temporary session keys, not 
for issuing digital certificates. 
Option C is incorrect. Tokenization systems replace sensitive 
data with non-sensitive substitutes, known as tokens. They don’t 
issue digital certificates. 
Option D is incorrect. A Security incident event manager 
(SIEM) aggregates and analyzes log data from various sources, 
providing real-time analysis of security alerts, but does not issue 
certificates. 
Question 87. A financial institution is looking to adopt an 
encryption algorithm for its transactions that is considered to be 
	
 
139

very secure due to its longer key length, compared to older 
standards. Which encryption algorithm best fits this description? 
(A)       DES 
(B)       Blowfish 
(C)       RSA 
(D)       AES-256 
Explanation 87. Correct Answer: D. AES-256. AES-256, part 
of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) family, utilizes a 
256-bit key length. This extended key length provides a higher 
degree of security and is considered resistant to all known 
practical attacks when used properly. 
Option A is incorrect. DES (Data Encryption Standard) has a 
key length of only 56 bits and is considered to be insecure 
against sufficiently equipped attackers due to its shorter key 
length. 
Option B is incorrect. While Blowfish is a symmetric 
encryption algorithm, it’s older and not as universally 
recommended for secure transactions as AES. 
Option C is incorrect. RSA is an asymmetric encryption 
algorithm, not typically used directly for encrypting bulk 
transaction data. 
Question 88. Alice receives an email from Bob with an attached 
document. She wants to verify both the authenticity of the 
sender and the integrity of the attached document. Which of the 
following should Bob have used before sending the email? 
(A)       Encrypt the document with his private key 
	
 
140

(B)       Hash the document 
(C)       Encrypt the document with Alice's public key 
(D)       Sign the document with his private key 
Explanation 88. Correct Answer: D. Sign the document with 
his private key. Digital signatures are created by taking a hash 
of a message (or document) and then encrypting that hash with 
the sender’s private key. When Alice receives the email, she can 
decrypt the signature using Bob’s public key to retrieve the 
original hash and then compare it with her computed hash of the 
document. If they match, it confirms both the sender’s identity 
(authenticity) and that the document has not been altered 
(integrity). 
Option A is incorrect. Encrypting the entire document with his 
private key isn’t practical for verifying authenticity and 
integrity. Instead, the hash of the document is encrypted to 
create a signature. 
Option B is incorrect. Simply hashing the document will 
provide a way to check the document’s integrity but does not 
verify the authenticity of the sender. 
Option C is incorrect. Encrypting the document with Alice’s 
public key would make it confidential for Alice, but this doesn’t 
help in verifying authenticity or integrity. 
Question 89. During a critical financial quarter, GlobalFin Corp 
experienced unexpected outages during peak business hours due 
to system maintenance, impacting its operations significantly. 
To prevent such occurrences in the future, what should 
	
 
141

GlobalFin Corp implement regarding their maintenance 
activities? 
(A)       Conduct maintenance activities randomly to avoid 
predictability 
(B)       Implement maintenance activities during peak business 
hours 
(C)       Establish designated maintenance windows 
(D)       Reduce the frequency of maintenance activities 
Explanation 89. Correct Answer: C. Establish designated 
maintenance windows. Maintenance windows are specific time 
frames designated for system maintenance, ensuring that 
disruptions due to updates, patches, or other maintenance 
activities don’t occur during critical business hours. By setting 
these windows, usually during off-peak times, businesses can 
minimize operational disruptions. 
Option A is incorrect. Conducting maintenance activities 
randomly can lead to unpredictable outages, which can be 
disruptive to business operations and degrade trust among 
stakeholders. 
Option B is incorrect. Implementing maintenance activities 
during peak business hours is precisely what led to the 
disruption in the scenario. This approach would likely cause 
more operational problems, especially for businesses with 
critical operations during these hours. 
Option D is incorrect. Reducing the frequency of maintenance 
activities might decrease disruptions, but it could also lead to 
	
 
142

unpatched vulnerabilities, outdated software, or other security 
and operational issues. 
Question 90. A financial institution wants to securely transfer 
transaction data between its main office and a branch office. 
The data should be encrypted while in transit to prevent any 
interception and unauthorized access. Which encryption 
solution is most suitable for securing the data during transport? 
(A)       Database-level Encryption 
(B)       Full-disk Encryption 
(C)       Transport-layer Encryption 
(D)       File-level Encryption 
Explanation 90. Correct Answer: C. Transport-layer 
Encryption. Transport-layer Encryption is specifically designed 
to protect data while it is in transit over a network. It ensures 
that the data remains confidential and is not tampered with 
during transmission. For the financial institution, this approach 
would be most effective in securing the transaction data 
between offices. 
Option A is incorrect. Database-level Encryption is used to 
secure data stored within a database, not for data in transit. 
Option B is incorrect. Full-disk Encryption secures the entire 
storage of a device and is not specific to data being transferred 
over a network. 
Option D is incorrect. File-level Encryption encrypts 
individual files but may not ensure the confidentiality of the 
data while it’s being transmitted over a network. 
	
 
143

Question 91. After a recent software update, a company’s 
intranet portal has been inaccessible to a few employees. The IT 
team suspects it could be due to network filtering rules. What 
should the IT team review to confirm their suspicions? 
(A)       The content filtering policies 
(B)       The malware detection logs 
(C)       The allow list/deny list configurations 
(D)       The network bandwidth utilization graphs 
Explanation 91. Correct Answer: C. The allow list/deny list 
configurations. Network accessibility issues, especially after 
software or configuration changes, can often arise due to 
misconfigured allow lists or deny lists. Reviewing these 
configurations can help determine if specific IP addresses or 
domains have been incorrectly blocked or not allowed, causing 
the inaccessibility issues. 
Option A is incorrect. Content filtering policies primarily focus 
on blocking specific types of content (like social media or adult 
sites) rather than causing inaccessibility to specific users or 
departments. 
Option B is incorrect. Malware detection logs track potential 
security threats and not network access configurations. They 
wouldn’t typically cause a selective inaccessibility issue unless 
a specific user’s machine is quarantined. 
Option D is incorrect. While network bandwidth utilization 
graphs might show reduced traffic, they won’t provide details 
on specific allow/deny list configurations that might be causing 
the inaccessibility. 
	
 
144

Question 92. A user wants to send a confidential email to their 
colleague and ensure that only the intended recipient can read it. 
The user also wants to provide assurance to the recipient that 
the email was indeed sent by them. Which encryption method 
should the user employ to accomplish this? 
(A)       Use symmetric encryption with a shared key 
(B)       Use asymmetric encryption and encrypt the email with 
the recipient's public key 
(C)       Use asymmetric encryption, encrypt the email with the 
user's private key 
(D)       Use asymmetric encryption, first sign the email with 
the user's private key, then encrypt it with the recipient's 
public key 
Explanation 92. Correct Answer: D. Use asymmetric 
encryption, first sign the email with the user’s private key, 
then encrypt it with the recipient’s public key. 
Option D offers both confidentiality and non-repudiation. 
The email is encrypted with the recipient’s public key, ensuring 
only the recipient can decrypt it using their private key. Signing 
the email with the sender’s private key allows the recipient to 
verify the sender using the sender’s public key. 
Option A is incorrect. While symmetric encryption provides 
confidentiality, it doesn’t offer non-repudiation or sender 
verification. 
Option B is incorrect. Encrypting with the recipient’s public 
key provides confidentiality but lacks sender verification. 
	
 
145

Option C is incorrect. Encrypting an email with the user’s 
private key would offer sender verification but won’t provide 
confidentiality. 
Question 93. A user, Amy, wants to securely send a confidential 
document to her colleague, Bob. Amy decides to encrypt the 
document to ensure its confidentiality. Which of the following 
should Amy use to encrypt the document, ensuring only Bob 
can decrypt it? 
(A)       Amy's private key 
(B)       Amy's public key 
(C)       Bob's private key 
(D)       Bob's public key 
Explanation 93. Correct Answer: D. Bob’s public key. In 
asymmetric encryption, if a message is encrypted with an 
individual’s public key, only the corresponding private key can 
decrypt it. Therefore, to ensure Bob is the only person who can 
decrypt the document, Amy should encrypt it using Bob’s 
public key. 
Option A is incorrect. Encrypting with Amy’s private key 
would allow anyone with Amy’s public key to decrypt it, and it 
would also serve as a digital signature rather than ensuring 
confidentiality. 
Option B is incorrect. Using Amy’s public key would not 
make sense because then only Amy’s private key could decrypt 
it. 
	
 
146

Option C is incorrect. The private key should never be shared 
or used for encryption. Its main use is for decryption and 
signing. 
Question 94. A cybersecurity analyst is investigating a 
suspicious image file received via email. Upon closer 
examination, the analyst suspects that the image might be 
carrying hidden data because the file size is unusually large. 
Which technique might the sender have used to embed secret 
information within the image? 
(A)       Symmetric encryption 
(B)       Digital watermarking 
(C)       Steganography 
(D)       Hashing 
Explanation 94. Correct Answer: C. Steganography. 
Steganography is the practice of hiding information within 
another form of data. In this case, the analyst suspects that an 
image file is carrying hidden data due to its unusually large size, 
which is a common indicator of steganographic practices. 
Option A is incorrect. Symmetric encryption is used for 
encrypting data using a single key for both encryption and 
decryption. It doesn’t hide data within other data. 
Option B is incorrect. Digital watermarking embeds 
information into a digital signal, but it’s generally used to assert 
rights or ownership, not to hide data in the manner of 
steganography. 
	
 
147

Option D is incorrect. Hashing is the process of converting an 
input into a fixed-length string of bytes, generally used to verify 
data integrity. 
Question 95. A company is preparing to roll out a new 
infrastructure deployment for its internal network. They have a 
server that will store both highly confidential customer 
information and non-sensitive marketing material. The IT 
department wants to ensure that only the confidential data is 
encrypted, while the marketing data remains easily accessible. 
Which level of encryption would be most suitable for this 
scenario? 
(A)       File-level Encryption 
(B)       Full-disk Encryption 
(C)       Partition Encryption 
(D)       Transport-layer Encryption 
Explanation 95. Correct Answer: C. Partition Encryption. 
Partition Encryption allows specific partitions or volumes of a 
storage drive to be encrypted. By encrypting only the partition 
that contains confidential data, the company can ensure the 
security of sensitive information while leaving other partitions, 
such as the one with marketing material, unencrypted for easy 
access. 
Option A is incorrect. File-level Encryption would require 
each confidential file to be encrypted individually, which could 
be cumbersome. 
Option B is incorrect. Full-disk Encryption would encrypt the 
entire disk, including the non-sensitive marketing material. 
	
 
148

Option D is incorrect. Transport-layer Encryption protects data 
in transit, not data at rest on storage drives. 
Question 96. Sarah, a cybersecurity analyst, receives a report 
that a company laptop was stolen from an employee’s car. The 
laptop contained sensitive financial data. Sarah checked the 
company’s security configurations and found that the laptop 
was equipped with full-disk encryption. How does this impact 
the potential data breach situation? 
(A)       The data remains easily accessible, as only the boot 
sector was encrypted 
(B)       The data is protected, as the entire hard drive's 
contents are encrypted 
(C)       The data is partially encrypted, with only the user 
directories protected 
(D)       The data is vulnerable since full-disk encryption only 
applies when the laptop is connected to the company network 
Explanation 96. Correct Answer: B. The data is protected, 
as the entire hard drive’s contents are encrypted. Full-disk 
Encryption (FDE) encrypts the entirety of a hard drive, ensuring 
that all its contents, including system and user files, are 
unreadable without the appropriate decryption key or 
credentials. As such, even if the laptop is stolen, the data 
remains secured unless the attacker has the decryption key. 
Option A is incorrect. Full-disk Encryption does not encrypt 
only the boot sector; it encrypts the entire disk. 
Option C is incorrect. Full-disk Encryption doesn’t only 
encrypt user directories; it encrypts the whole disk. 
	
 
149

Option D is incorrect. Full-disk Encryption protects the data at 
all times, irrespective of the laptop’s connection to a network. 
Question 97. A university’s IT department provides access to its 
student records for training purposes to new hires. To protect 
student identities, they replace the real names and social 
security numbers with fictitious ones while maintaining the 
database’s original format. Which technique is the IT 
department utilizing? 
(A)       Digital signing 
(B)       Data masking 
(C)       Steganography 
(D)       Data deduplication 
Explanation 97. Correct Answer: B. Data masking. Data 
masking protects the data subject’s data privacy by obscuring 
specific data within a database, making the data unreadable and 
unusable, especially in non-production environments. It is 
commonly used for testing and development purposes. 
Option A is incorrect. Digital signing involves using a digital 
signature to prove the authenticity and integrity of data. 
Option C is incorrect. Steganography involves hiding 
information within other information, such as embedding text 
within images, making it undetectable. 
Option D is incorrect. Data deduplication is the process of 
eliminating duplicate copies of repeating data to save storage 
space. 
	
 
150

Question 98. A company is looking for a cryptographic solution 
that provides an immutable and transparent record of all 
transactions in a distributed ledger system. Which of the 
following would BEST meet this requirement? 
(A)       Symmetric key algorithm 
(B)       Public key infrastructure 
(C)       Blockchain 
(D)       Digital watermark 
Explanation 98. Correct Answer: C. Blockchain. Blockchain 
is a decentralized and distributed ledger technology that 
provides an immutable record of transactions. Each block 
contains a list of transactions and is linked to the previous 
block, creating a chain. The transparency and immutability of 
blockchain make it especially suitable for applications where an 
irrefutable record is essential. 
Option A is incorrect. Symmetric key algorithms are 
encryption methods where the same key is used for both 
encryption and decryption but don’t inherently provide an 
immutable record of transactions. 
Option B is incorrect. Public key infrastructure (PKI) is used 
for digital certificates and keys distribution but doesn’t offer an 
immutable record of transactions. 
Option D is incorrect. Digital watermarking embeds 
information into a digital signal, but it doesn’t provide an 
immutable record of transactions. 
	
 
151

Question 99. An IT manager is considering solutions to protect 
data stored on the laptops provided to remote employees. The 
primary concern is to ensure that the entire content of the 
laptop’s storage drive is unreadable if a laptop is lost or stolen. 
Which encryption level would best address this concern? 
(A)       File-level Encryption 
(B)       Transport-layer Encryption 
(C)       Full-disk Encryption 
(D)       Database-level Encryption 
Explanation 99. Correct Answer: C. Full-disk Encryption. 
Full-disk Encryption (FDE) encrypts the entire storage drive, 
making all data on the drive unreadable without the correct 
decryption key or credentials. This is especially useful for 
portable devices like laptops, which are more vulnerable to 
physical theft. 
Option A is incorrect. File-level Encryption encrypts 
individual files rather than the entire disk, so some data or 
system files might remain unencrypted. 
Option B is incorrect. Transport-layer Encryption protects data 
in transit, not data at rest on storage drives. 
Option D is incorrect. Database-level Encryption encrypts data 
within a database and does not apply to other files or data 
outside of that database. 
Question 100. The finance department at a large firm still relies 
on a legacy application for their quarterly reporting. This 
application is known to have some security flaws, but due to its 
	
 
152

critical nature, it cannot be easily replaced. How can the firm 
BEST mitigate the risks associated with this application? 
(A)       Train the finance team about the latest cybersecurity 
threats 
(B)       Run the legacy application on the latest hardware to 
improve performance 
(C)       Place the legacy application behind a web 
application firewall (WAF) 
(D)       Frequently change the passwords of users who have 
access to the application 
Explanation 100. Correct Answer: C. Place the legacy 
application behind a web application firewall (WAF). By 
placing the application behind a WAF, the firm can filter, 
monitor, and block malicious HTTP traffic targeting the 
application’s vulnerabilities, thereby offering a layer of 
protection against potential security flaws in the legacy 
application. 
Option A is incorrect. While training is essential, it doesn’t 
directly address the vulnerabilities in the legacy application. 
Option B is incorrect. Using the latest hardware might improve 
application performance but doesn’t mitigate the security risks 
associated with its vulnerabilities. 
Option D is incorrect. While frequent password changes can 
enhance security, they don’t address the inherent vulnerabilities 
in the legacy application. 
	
 
153

Question 101. A multinational corporation is concerned about 
the possibility of losing access to encrypted data due to the loss 
or compromise of private keys. They’ve approached a third-
party organization for a solution. Which of the following is a 
system that allows the third party to securely hold a copy of the 
corporation’s cryptographic keys to ensure data recoverability? 
(A)       Public Key Repository 
(B)       Key Generation Center 
(C)       Key Escrow 
(D)       Key Renewal Service 
Explanation 101. Correct Answer: C. Key Escrow. Key 
escrow is a system in which cryptographic keys are securely 
stored with a third party, so they can be retrieved in cases where 
the original keys are lost or compromised. This ensures data 
recoverability while maintaining security. 
Option A is incorrect. A Public Key Repository is where public 
keys are stored for retrieval, not for backup or recovery 
purposes. 
Option B is incorrect. Key Generation Center is responsible 
for creating cryptographic keys, not storing them for recovery 
purposes. 
Option D is incorrect. Key Renewal Service deals with 
replacing and updating cryptographic keys as they expire or 
need refreshing, not storing them for recovery. 
Question 102. A financial institution plans to provide access to 
its database for third-party developers to create new 
	
 
154

applications. However, they want to ensure that the developers 
do not see the actual data but instead work with a disguised 
version that retains the data’s original structure. What technique 
is the financial institution considering? 
(A)       Tokenization 
(B)       Data masking 
(C)       Encryption 
(D)       Digital watermarking 
Explanation 102. Correct Answer: B. Data masking. Data 
masking is a technique that obscures specific data within a 
database, making the data unreadable and unusable. The method 
is often employed in non-production environments to protect 
the data subject’s data privacy and data security. 
Option A is incorrect. Tokenization replaces sensitive data with 
random tokens, which act as references to the original data. 
Option C is incorrect. Encryption converts readable data into 
an unreadable format to protect its confidentiality. It requires a 
key to return the data to its original form. 
Option D is incorrect. Digital watermarking embeds data into a 
digital signal, primarily for asserting rights or ownership. 
Question 103. NexTech, a cloud-based software company, 
recently faced a security breach due to inconsistent practices 
among its system administrators. To avoid such inconsistencies 
in the future, what should NexTech emphasize in its operations? 
(A)       Rely on system administrators to develop their personal 
methods 
	
 
155

(B)       Mandate frequent system reboots 
(C)       Implement Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) 
for all technical operations 
(D)       Conduct random security audits without notifying 
administrators 
Explanation 103. Correct Answer: C. Implement Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) for all technical operations. 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) provide a consistent and 
documented process that employees can follow. By 
implementing SOPs, businesses ensure that tasks are performed 
uniformly, reducing the risk of errors and inconsistencies that 
might lead to security vulnerabilities. 
Option A is incorrect. Relying on individual system 
administrators to develop their personal methods can lead to 
inconsistent practices and operational inefficiencies, increasing 
the risk of security breaches. 
Option B is incorrect. Frequent system reboots, while they 
might be part of some SOPs, don’t address the root issue of 
inconsistency among system administrators. It’s the consistent 
method of operations that prevents errors, not just frequent 
restarts. 
Option D is incorrect. While security audits are essential, 
conducting them without notice doesn’t address the core issue 
of inconsistency in system administration practices. 
Question 104. After a series of system enhancements, a 
financial organization decided to use a manual method of 
	
 
156

documenting changes in separate files rather than implementing 
a version control system. During an audit, the cybersecurity 
team struggled to determine which version of a critical system 
file was the most recent and accurate. What is the PRIMARY 
risk of not implementing version control for such 
documentation? 
(A)       Increased storage requirements for multiple files 
(B)       Difficulty in collaborating between team members 
(C)       Lack of traceability and difficulty in reverting to a 
known stable state 
(D)       Greater need for training staff on manual documentation 
Explanation 104. Correct Answer: C. Lack of traceability 
and difficulty in reverting to a known stable state. Version 
control provides a clear history of changes, ensuring easy 
reversion to a known stable state, and identifying the latest 
version of a document or system file. In the absence of version 
control, identifying the most recent and accurate version can be 
challenging. 
Option A is incorrect. While storage might be a concern, the 
primary risk is the inability to trace changes and revert to a 
stable state. 
Option B is incorrect. Collaboration might be hindered, but the 
direct risk is associated with traceability and stability. 
Option D is incorrect. Training staff is always essential, but 
the immediate concern is the ability to trace and manage 
changes. 
	
 
157

Question 105. During a security audit, it was found that an 
application was using plain hashes for storing passwords. The 
security team recommended a method that involves using the 
original password along with a salt and then rehashing it 
multiple times. What is this method known as? 
(A)       Key clustering 
(B)       Rainbow table prevention 
(C)       Key rotation 
(D)       Key stretching 
Explanation 105. Correct Answer: D. Key stretching. Key 
stretching refers to the process of taking a password and, 
usually in combination with a salt, hashing it multiple times. 
This repeated hashing process makes brute-force attacks more 
time-consuming and difficult because the attacker has to not 
only guess the password but also apply the hashing function the 
same number of times the original process used. 
Option A is incorrect. Key clustering pertains to different keys 
producing the same ciphertext from the same plaintext, which is 
not relevant to the described scenario. 
Option B is incorrect. While using salts can prevent the 
effective use of rainbow tables, the act of rehashing passwords 
multiple times is not specifically called “rainbow table 
prevention.” 
Option C is incorrect. Key rotation involves periodically 
changing cryptographic keys. It does not relate to hashing 
passwords multiple times. 
	
 
158

Question 106. During a routine update, a web server 
application requires a restart. What should the administrator do 
FIRST to ensure client connections aren’t abruptly terminated 
during the restart? 
(A)       Redirect incoming traffic to a backup server 
(B)       Increase the server's memory 
(C)       Manually terminate all active client sessions 
(D)       Check for available patches for the application 
Explanation 106. Correct Answer: A. Redirect incoming 
traffic to a backup server. Redirecting incoming traffic 
ensures that clients are not abruptly disconnected and instead 
can continue their activities on a backup server while the 
primary server undergoes a restart. 
Option B is incorrect. Increasing server memory might 
improve performance but doesn’t address the immediate issue 
of the service restart. 
Option C is incorrect. Manually terminating client sessions 
would cause abrupt disconnections, which is what the 
administrator is trying to avoid. 
Option D is incorrect. While checking for patches is important, 
it doesn’t address the issue of ensuring client connections aren’t 
terminated during a service restart. 
Question 107. Carlos is responsible for managing IT services 
for a university. The university has numerous departments, each 
with its subdomain, like arts.university.com, 
science.university.com, and sports.university.com. Carlos wants 
	
 
159

a solution that ensures HTTPS security while being cost-
effective. However, he’s wary of potential risks. What might be 
a drawback of using a Wildcard Certificate for the university’s 
subdomains? 
(A)       It can secure only one subdomain 
(B)       If compromised, all subdomains are at risk 
(C)       It only validates the domain ownership, not the 
organization's identity 
(D)       It's the most expensive certificate available 
Explanation 107. Correct Answer: B. If compromised, all 
subdomains are at risk. The primary concern with a Wildcard 
Certificate is that if its private key is compromised, it 
jeopardizes the security of all associated subdomains. This 
poses a significant risk since the exposure of a single key could 
lead to potential attacks or misuse across all subdomains. 
Option A is incorrect. A Wildcard Certificate can secure 
multiple subdomains under a single domain. 
Option C is incorrect. While true for Domain Validated (DV) 
certificates, Wildcard Certificates can also be available with 
Organization Validation (OV), ensuring organizational identity. 
Option D is incorrect. Wildcard Certificates aren’t necessarily 
the most expensive. The cost varies based on the level of 
validation and the issuing authority. 
Question 108. Your organization is preparing to upgrade a 
database server that supports an e-commerce application. A 
review of the change management documentation has revealed 
	
 
160

that multiple applications rely on this particular database server 
for various functionalities. Which of the following steps should 
be taken FIRST to ensure a smooth upgrade process without 
disruptions? 
(A)       Upgrade the database server immediately to benefit 
from new features 
(B)       Perform a backup of the database server 
(C)       Identify and test all applications that have 
dependencies on the database server 
(D)       Inform users about potential downtime during the 
upgrade 
Explanation 108. Correct Answer: C. Identify and test all 
applications that have dependencies on the database server. 
Before making changes, especially to systems with multiple 
dependencies, it’s crucial to understand the full scope of 
potential impacts. By identifying and testing all dependent 
applications, you ensure that the upgrade won’t inadvertently 
disrupt other services or functionalities. 
Option A is incorrect. Upgrading immediately without 
considering dependencies can lead to unforeseen disruptions 
and complications. 
Option B is incorrect. While backing up the server is a good 
practice, understanding dependencies should come first to plan 
the upgrade effectively. 
Option D is incorrect. Informing users is essential, but 
understanding the upgrade’s potential impact should come first 
to provide accurate information.

Question 109. After a recent data breach, a multinational 
corporation is evaluating its cryptographic practices. The Chief 
Security Officer (CSO) determines that the manual management 
of cryptographic keys has become too complex due to the scale 
of the operations. Which tool would BEST address the CSO’s 
concern while ensuring robust security practices? 
(A)       Password Management System 
(B)       Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) 
(C)       Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 
(D)       Key Management System (KMS) 
Explanation 109. Correct Answer: D. Key Management 
System (KMS). A Key Management System (KMS) is 
specifically designed to handle the generation, distribution, 
rotation, and retirement of cryptographic keys in a centralized 
and automated manner. For large organizations, using a KMS 
streamlines and secures the complex task of key management. 
Option A is incorrect. While a Password Management System 
helps in handling and storing passwords, it does not provide 
comprehensive features needed for cryptographic key 
management. 
Option B is incorrect. SFTP is a protocol for securely 
transferring files over a network, not for managing 
cryptographic keys. 
Option C is incorrect. While TPM provides hardware-level 
security for individual devices, it is not meant for enterprise-
wide key management.

Question 110. During a quarterly review, the IT team at a 
logistics company decided to change the configuration of their 
load balancers to better distribute traffic among their servers. 
After the change, a series of technical issues emerged, affecting 
customer-facing applications. When troubleshooting the issue, it 
was discovered that the network diagrams had not been updated 
to reflect the new changes. What is the MAJOR consequence of 
not having updated diagrams in such a scenario? 
(A)       The servers might need a hardware upgrade 
(B)       The company might need to revert to the old load 
balancer configuration 
(C)       It increases the time and complexity of 
troubleshooting 
(D)       Customers might prefer other logistics companies 
Explanation 110. Correct Answer: C. It increases the time 
and complexity of troubleshooting. Accurate and up-to-date 
documentation, including network diagrams, is crucial for 
effective troubleshooting. Without it, IT teams can spend 
unnecessary time trying to understand the current state of the 
system, delaying the resolution of the issue. 
Option A is incorrect. While server upgrades might be 
necessary in some cases, it’s not a direct consequence of 
outdated diagrams. 
Option B is incorrect. Reverting to an old configuration might 
be a potential solution, but the primary issue is the increased 
troubleshooting complexity due to outdated documentation. 
	
 
163

Option D is incorrect. While the potential loss of customers 
can be an indirect consequence of prolonged technical issues, 
the immediate concern of outdated diagrams is the impact on 
troubleshooting.

                       Answers 111-220 
 
Question 111. A medium-sized company suffered a data breach. 
Investigations revealed that an attacker from a rival firm had 
exploited a misconfigured firewall to gain unauthorized access 
to the company’s database. Based on the attributes of the actor, 
how would this threat actor be best described? 
(A)       Internal actor leveraging physical access 
(B)       Internal actor abusing privileges 
(C)       External actor using social engineering 
(D)       External actor exploiting technical vulnerabilities 
Explanation 111. Correct Answer: D. External actor 
exploiting technical vulnerabilities. The attacker originated 
from outside the victim organization (a rival firm) and exploited 
a technical issue (misconfigured firewall) to gain access. This 
categorizes them as an external actor exploiting technical 
vulnerabilities. 
Option A is incorrect. The attacker was from a rival firm and 
did not utilize physical access within the victim organization. 
Therefore, this description doesn’t match the scenario. 
	
 
204

Option B is incorrect. The scenario doesn’t mention any 
internal actors or abuse of privileges. Instead, it describes an 
external attacker from a rival firm. 
Option C is incorrect. While the attacker was external, the 
scenario does not describe any use of social engineering tactics. 
Instead, the attacker exploited a technical vulnerability 
(misconfigured firewall). 
Question 112. Sophia, the CFO of a medium-sized company, 
received a call from an individual claiming to be from the IT 
department. The caller requested her login details for a “critical 
system update.” Suspecting something wasn’t right, Sophia 
hung up and contacted her IT department, which confirmed no 
such call was made by them. Which type of attack did Sophia 
most likely experience? 
(A)       Vishing 
(B)       Phishing 
(C)       SQL Injection 
(D)       Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
Explanation 112. Correct Answer: A. Vishing. Vishing, or 
voice phishing, is an attack where fraudsters use the telephone 
to mislead individuals into revealing personal information or 
login credentials. 
Option B is incorrect. Phishing is typically an attempt to 
obtain sensitive information through deceptive emails and 
websites, not voice calls. 
	
 
205

Option C is incorrect. SQL Injection is an attack type that tries 
to execute malicious SQL statements in a database. It is not 
related to voice calls. 
Option D is incorrect. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a 
type of attack where the attacker tricks the victim into 
submitting a malicious request. This is unrelated to voice call 
scenarios. 
Question 113. During an incident response, the IT team 
discovers malware that collects information about military 
projects. The malware sends the data to a server located in a 
foreign country. Which type of threat actor would MOST likely 
be involved in this type of cyber espionage? 
(A)       Disgruntled employee 
(B)       Nation-state 
(C)       Phishing scam artist 
(D)       Hacktivist 
Explanation 113. Correct Answer: B. Nation-state. Malware 
that specifically targets information about military projects and 
sends data to a foreign server is indicative of cyber espionage, a 
tactic commonly employed by nation-states. They have the 
motivation to gather intelligence and potentially disrupt or gain 
advantages over other nations, particularly concerning military 
or defense-related data. 
Option A is incorrect. While a disgruntled employee might 
have a motive to harm the company, they wouldn’t typically be 
involved in the collection of military project information for a 
foreign nation. 
	
 
206

Option C is incorrect. Phishing scam artists primarily focus on 
deceiving individuals into revealing personal or financial 
information. They typically don’t have interest or resources for 
collecting military-specific data for foreign espionage. 
Option D is incorrect. Hacktivists are typically motivated by 
ideological, environmental, or political causes. While they 
might disrupt services or leak information, targeting military 
projects for a foreign nation isn’t a typical characteristic of their 
activities. 
Question 114. A company’s website was temporarily defaced 
with a humorous meme, but no sensitive data was stolen or any 
significant damage done. The attacker left a message bragging 
about their first successful hack. Which type of threat actor is 
MOST likely responsible for this attack? 
(A)       Insider threat 
(B)       Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) 
(C)       Unskilled attacker 
(D)       Nation-state 
Explanation 114. Correct Answer: C. Unskilled attacker. 
Unskilled attackers, often referred to as “script kiddies”, 
typically utilize pre-made tools or scripts to carry out basic 
attacks. Their motivations are often more about bragging rights 
or minor mischief, such as defacing a website for fun or to 
prove they can, rather than executing a sophisticated or 
damaging attack. 
Option A is incorrect. Insider threats are individuals within an 
organization that may have specific motives related to personal 
	
 
207

grievances or financial gain. Their attacks would typically be 
more targeted and potentially more harmful than just defacing a 
website. 
Option B is incorrect. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are 
highly skilled and typically represent organized groups with 
specific, long-term objectives. Their attacks are sophisticated 
and stealthy, aiming for data theft or system compromise over 
an extended period. 
Option D is incorrect. Nation-states are motivated by political, 
military, or espionage objectives. A simple website defacement, 
especially one with a humorous meme, does not align with their 
typical motivations or methods. 
Question 115. A new technology firm recently launched a 
device that uses facial recognition for authentication. A 
cybersecurity researcher, without any malicious intent, 
demonstrated a method to bypass the facial recognition using a 
photograph. The researcher then approached the firm with the 
findings without publicizing it. What is the primary motivation 
behind the researcher’s action? 
(A)       Philosophical beliefs opposing facial recognition 
(B)       Financial gain by blackmailing the firm 
(C)       Ethical considerations for consumer security 
(D)       Aiming to damage the firm's market reputation 
Explanation 115. Correct Answer: C. Ethical considerations 
for consumer security. By responsibly disclosing the 
vulnerability to the firm without any malicious intent or 
	
 
208

publicizing it, the researcher showcased ethical motivations, 
aiming to improve consumer security. 
Option A is incorrect. The researcher did not express 
opposition to facial recognition technology but only highlighted 
a potential vulnerability. 
Option B is incorrect. There is no evidence that the researcher 
tried to blackmail the firm. Instead, they responsibly disclosed 
the vulnerability. 
Option D is incorrect. The researcher chose not to publicize 
the vulnerability, indicating they were not aiming to damage the 
firm’s reputation but to assist in improving security. 
Question 116. Mike, a network administrator, notices an 
unauthorized device connected directly to the company’s main 
network switch in the server room. This device is attempting to 
capture network traffic. What kind of attack is this unauthorized 
device likely conducting? 
(A)       Rogue access point 
(B)       VLAN hopping 
(C)       Port mirroring 
(D)       ARP poisoning 
Explanation 116. Correct Answer: C. Port mirroring. Port 
mirroring is a method used on a network switch to send a copy 
of network packets seen on one switch port (or an entire VLAN) 
to a network monitoring connection on another switch port. An 
attacker can use this method to capture and analyze the traffic 
without interfering with the flow of the original packets. 
	
 
209

Option A is incorrect. A rogue access point is a wireless access 
point installed on a network without the network administrator’s 
authorization. The scenario describes a wired connection, not a 
wireless one. 
Option B is incorrect. VLAN hopping is an attack method 
used to access data from different VLANs that would typically 
not be accessible. The scenario focuses on capturing network 
traffic, not crossing VLAN boundaries. 
Option D is incorrect. ARP poisoning is a type of attack in 
which an attacker sends false ARP messages to a local network. 
This is not directly related to the unauthorized device connected 
to the switch as described. 
Question 117. Alex, an employee at XYZ Corp, noticed an 
unfamiliar USB drive lying in the company parking lot. Out of 
curiosity, Alex plugged the device into his workstation. Almost 
immediately, his antivirus program detected malicious software 
trying to execute. What type of attack did Alex likely 
encounter? 
(A)       Man-in-the-Middle Attack 
(B)       Evil Twin 
(C)       Spear Phishing 
(D)       USB Drop Attack 
Explanation 117. Correct Answer: D. USB Drop Attack. A 
USB Drop Attack involves leaving malware-infected removable 
devices, such as USB drives, in places where they can be found 
and used by unsuspecting individuals. Once the device is 
	
 
210

plugged into a computer, it can potentially execute malicious 
software or scripts. 
Option A is incorrect. A Man-in-the-Middle Attack involves an 
attacker secretly intercepting and possibly altering the 
communication between two parties without them noticing. It is 
not related to USB devices. 
Option B is incorrect. Evil Twin refers to a rogue Wi-Fi access 
point that appears to be legitimate but is set up to eavesdrop on 
wireless communications. It doesn’t pertain to USB devices. 
Option C is incorrect. Spear Phishing is a targeted attempt to 
steal sensitive information through deceptive emails directed at 
specific individuals or companies. It is not associated with USB 
devices. 
Question 118. A company named TechFlow is planning to 
produce a new line of smart home devices. They have opted to 
use a single supplier for a crucial component in their devices. 
Which of the following represents the MOST significant 
security risk associated with this decision? 
(A)       It will be challenging to negotiate prices with just one 
supplier 
(B)       If the supplier's delivery timeline is delayed, product 
launch might be postponed 
(C)       A compromise at the supplier could lead to 
vulnerabilities in all devices 
(D)       TechFlow will need to rely on the supplier's warranty 
and return policies 
	
 
211

Explanation 118. Correct Answer: C. A compromise at the 
supplier could lead to vulnerabilities in all devices. Relying 
on a single supplier means that any security issues at that 
supplier’s end might translate directly into vulnerabilities in 
every device using that component. 
In a supply chain, the security of every entity is paramount. If 
one supplier gets compromised, and the company relies solely 
on that supplier for a crucial component, every product using 
that component might be vulnerable. This could have 
widespread implications for the security of the end-users and 
damage the company’s reputation. 
Option A is incorrect. Price negotiation is a business concern 
and not directly related to the security implications of using a 
single supplier. 
Option B is incorrect. While delivery delays can have business 
implications, they don’t represent a direct security risk. 
Option D is incorrect. Warranty and return policies are 
operational considerations but aren’t the primary security risks 
associated with relying on a single supplier. 
Question 119. A high-profile executive received an email 
containing personal photos and a message threatening to release 
the images to the public unless a significant sum of money was 
transferred to a specific cryptocurrency address. What 
motivation is most evident behind this threat? 
(A)       Espionage to gather competitive intelligence 
(B)       Service disruption to harm the reputation of the 
	
 
212

executive's company 
(C)       Blackmail to extract money by leveraging sensitive 
information 
(D)       Data exfiltration for selling on the dark web 
Explanation 119. Correct Answer: C. Blackmail to extract 
money by leveraging sensitive information. The direct threat 
of releasing personal photos in exchange for money is a classic 
indication of blackmail. The attacker is leveraging sensitive 
information (personal photos) to extort money. 
Option A is incorrect. There’s no mention of seeking company 
secrets or competitive intelligence. The focus of the attacker is 
on personal images of the executive. 
Option B is incorrect. While releasing the images might harm 
the executive’s reputation, there’s no direct intent shown to 
disrupt the company’s services or harm its operational standing. 
Option D is incorrect. The attacker is directly demanding 
money in exchange for not releasing the photos. This differs 
from data exfiltration where data might be sold or leveraged in 
other ways. 
Question 120. Jane, an accountant in a multinational 
corporation, received an email from what seemed to be the 
company’s IT department. The email had the company’s logo, 
colors, and font and urged Jane to click on a link to reset her 
password due to “suspicious activity.” However, upon close 
inspection, Jane noticed a minor spelling error in the domain 
name of the sender’s email address. What type of attack does 
	
 
213

this scenario describe? 
(A)       Spear Phishing 
(B)       Vishing 
(C)       Baiting 
(D)       Brand Impersonation 
Explanation 120. Correct Answer: D. Brand Impersonation. 
The attacker has mimicked the company’s branding in an 
attempt to deceive the recipient into thinking the 
communication is legitimate. 
Brand impersonation involves attackers mimicking or 
replicating the branding of a reputable company or organization 
in an attempt to trick users into thinking the communication is 
legitimate. This tactic is commonly used in phishing emails to 
mislead recipients into providing sensitive information or 
clicking on malicious links. 
Option A is incorrect. Spear Phishing is targeted phishing 
aimed specifically at one individual or a small group. While 
Jane might be specifically targeted, the defining feature of this 
attack is the impersonation of the company’s branding, making 
it brand impersonation. 
Option B is incorrect. Vishing involves voice communication 
or phone calls, and the scenario describes an email-based attack. 
Option C is incorrect. Baiting typically offers something 
enticing to lure victims. There’s no offer or lure in the described 
scenario. 
	
 
214

Question 121. During a routine scan, the security team at a 
graphic design firm discovers that an employee downloaded an 
image from an email and subsequently, unusual network traffic 
was detected originating from that employee’s workstation. The 
image appeared normal when opened. What type of attack 
might have been used in this situation? 
(A)       Image Steganography Malware 
(B)       Password Brute Force 
(C)       Phishing 
(D)       Port Scanning 
Explanation 121. Correct Answer: A. Image Steganography 
Malware. Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, 
message, image, or video within another file, message, image, 
or video. Image steganography specifically involves hiding 
malicious code within an image. When the image is downloaded 
or opened, the malicious code can be executed without the 
victim’s knowledge. 
Option B is incorrect. Password Brute Force is an attack 
method where an attacker attempts to guess a user’s password 
by systematically trying every possible combination of letters, 
numbers, and symbols until the correct password is discovered. 
Option C is incorrect. Phishing typically involves deceptive 
emails or messages attempting to trick recipients into divulging 
sensitive information. While images can be used in phishing 
attempts, the scenario described does not indicate an attempt to 
extract information from the employee. 
	
 
215

Option D is incorrect. Port Scanning is an attempt to discover 
open ports on a computer, which can reveal services running on 
those ports. It does not involve the use of images. 
Question 122. Acme Corp, a large organization, has recently 
entered into a contract with Zenith MSP for IT management and 
support. The CISO of Acme Corp is concerned about the 
security risks associated with this new relationship. Which of 
the following is the PRIMARY security concern when utilizing 
managed service providers (MSPs) in a supply chain? 
(A)       Increased costs due to the integration of new 
technologies 
(B)       Difficulty in ensuring consistent patch management 
(C)       Potential for unauthorized access to company 
resources 
(D)       Decreased IT staff morale due to outsourcing 
Explanation 122. Correct Answer: C. Potential for 
unauthorized access to company resources. Managed Service 
Providers usually have elevated privileges to provide their 
services, potentially making them a prime target for attackers. A 
breach at the MSP level can lead to unauthorized access to their 
client’s resources. 
When a company engages with an MSP, that provider typically 
has access to critical systems, data, and network infrastructure 
to deliver their services. If the MSP is compromised, this can 
lead to a cascading effect where client systems and data are also 
vulnerable. It is imperative for companies to ensure their MSPs 
have robust security postures to prevent unauthorized access. 
	
 
216

Option A is incorrect. While cost considerations are important 
in business decisions, they are not a direct security risk posed 
by MSPs in a supply chain. 
Option B is incorrect. Though ensuring consistent patch 
management is a legitimate concern, the primary risk is 
unauthorized access through the MSP, which might have 
extensive privileges. 
Option D is incorrect. While IT staff morale is a valid 
organizational concern when outsourcing, it is not the primary 
security risk associated with MSPs. 
Question 123. Mike, an employee at a tech company, receives 
an instant message from a coworker named Jessica. The 
message contains a link and claims to showcase a hilarious 
video. However, Mike knows Jessica is on vacation. He 
suspects the message might not genuinely be from her. What 
type of threat is Mike most likely encountering? 
(A)       Watering Hole Attack 
(B)       Man-in-the-Middle Attack 
(C)       IM Spoofing 
(D)       Side-channel Attack 
Explanation 123. Correct Answer: C. IM Spoofing. IM 
Spoofing occurs when an attacker sends messages to a system 
that appear to come from a trusted source, typically a known 
contact. By pretending to be someone the victim knows, the 
attacker can deceive the victim into opening a malicious link or 
sharing confidential information. 
	
 
217

Option A is incorrect. A Watering Hole Attack is where the 
attacker guesses or observes which websites the group often 
uses and infects one or more of them with malware. 
Option B is incorrect. A Man-in-the-Middle Attack involves 
the attacker secretly intercepting and relaying communication 
between two parties. The attacker makes independent 
connections with the victims and relays messages between 
them. 
Option D is incorrect. A Side-channel Attack is based on 
information gained from the implementation of a computer 
system, rather than weaknesses in the implemented algorithm 
itself. 
Question 124. During a political campaign, an anonymous 
group releases a series of articles containing fabricated data 
about a candidate’s past, intending to influence voters’ opinions. 
This is an example of: 
(A)       Impersonation 
(B)       SSmishing 
(C)       Disinformation 
(D)       Baiting 
Explanation 124. Correct Answer: C. Disinformation. The 
spread of deliberately false information to deceive or harm, 
especially in sensitive areas like politics, is classified as 
disinformation. 
Disinformation campaigns aim to deceive audiences by 
presenting false information as if it’s true. In political scenarios, 
	
 
218

this can have significant ramifications, affecting public opinion 
and the outcome of elections. 
Option A is incorrect. Impersonation involves pretending to be 
someone else to deceive, but the scenario doesn’t indicate that 
the anonymous group is impersonating anyone. 
Option B is incorrect. Smishing is a type of phishing attack 
that uses SMS. It doesn’t relate to spreading false information in 
articles. 
Option D is incorrect. Baiting involves enticing victims with 
something they want (like free software) to steal their personal 
information or to spread malware. It doesn’t involve the spread 
of false information as described in the scenario. 
Question 125. Sophia received an email from her bank asking 
her to urgently update her personal details due to a system 
upgrade. The email contains a link that redirects to a website 
that looks similar to her bank’s website. Which of the following 
should she do FIRST? 
(A)       Follow the link and promptly update her personal details 
to avoid any inconvenience 
(B)       Forward the email to her friends and family to ensure 
they are also aware of the bank's system upgrade 
(C)       Delete the email immediately without taking any action 
(D)       Contact her bank through official channels to verify 
the authenticity of the email 
Explanation 125. Correct Answer: D. Contact her bank 
through official channels to verify the authenticity of the 
	
 
219

email. Before taking action based on an unsolicited email, 
especially one that asks for personal information or credentials, 
it’s essential to verify its legitimacy directly with the institution 
or entity it claims to represent. 
Phishing attacks often use fear, urgency, or perceived authority 
to lure victims into providing sensitive data. The best defense 
against such attempts is to independently verify any unexpected 
or suspicious requests before taking action. 
Option A is incorrect. Directly responding to a potential 
phishing email by providing personal details is a common 
mistake, making the user vulnerable to fraud and identity theft. 
Option B is incorrect. Forwarding a potentially malicious 
email to others can further propagate the threat and possibly 
compromise their security as well. 
Option C is incorrect. While deleting the email might prevent 
Sophia from falling for the phishing attempt, it’s still a good 
practice to inform the bank about the suspicious email so they 
can take appropriate measures and warn other customers. 
Question 126. A user receives an SMS claiming to be from her 
bank, alerting her of unauthorized activity on her account. The 
message instructs the user to immediately click on a provided 
link and verify her account details. The user hasn’t noticed any 
irregularities with her bank account. Which type of attack is this 
SMS most likely part of? 
(A)       Smishing 
(B)       Vishing 
	
 
220

(C)       Bluejacking 
(D)       Bluesnarfing 
Explanation 126. Correct Answer: A. Smishing. Smishing is 
a type of phishing attack where malicious actors use SMS to 
deceive individuals into providing sensitive information, 
typically by impersonating trusted organizations or contacts. 
Option B is incorrect. Vishing refers to voice phishing, where 
attackers use voice calls instead of text or email to impersonate 
legitimate entities and scam victims. 
Option C is incorrect. Bluejacking involves sending 
unsolicited messages to Bluetooth-enabled devices. It doesn’t 
typically involve impersonating a legitimate entity for deceptive 
purposes. 
Option D is incorrect. Bluesnarfing is a type of unauthorized 
access to or theft of information from a Bluetooth device. It 
doesn’t involve deceptive SMS messages. 
Question 127. An e-commerce platform reported a series of 
breaches over the past month. With each breach, financial and 
personal data of thousands of users were exfiltrated. The 
perpetrators subsequently sold the data on the dark web. Which 
type of threat actor is MOST likely behind these breaches? 
(A)       Insider threat 
(B)       Hacktivist 
(C)       Organized crime syndicate 
(D)       Nation-state 
	
 
221

Explanation 127.  Correct Answer: C. Organized crime 
syndicate. Organized crime syndicates are primarily motivated 
by financial gains. The act of exfiltrating financial and personal 
data from an e-commerce platform, only to sell it on the dark 
web, aligns with the profit-driven motives of organized crime 
groups. 
Option A is incorrect. While insider threats can indeed pose 
significant risks, they are typically motivated by personal 
grievances, revenge, or opportunistic financial gains. The 
systematic breaches and subsequent sale of data on the dark 
web point more towards an organized group than an individual 
insider. 
Option B is incorrect. Hacktivists primarily target 
organizations to further or protest a political or social cause. 
The described actions, focused on profiting from stolen data, are 
not aligned with typical hacktivist motives. 
Option D is incorrect. While nation-states might engage in 
cyber espionage or cyber warfare for political or strategic 
reasons, they are not typically involved in the theft of financial 
data for direct monetary gain. 
Question 128. Alex, a new intern at an IT company, wanted to 
access the internal company portal. Instead of typing 
“companyportal.com,” he accidentally typed 
“comapnyportal.com” and ended up on a site that looked 
identical but asked him to download a security certificate. This 
scenario best describes which type of attack? 
(A)       Spear Phishing 
	
 
222

(B)       Watering Hole Attack 
(C)       Typosquatting 
(D)       Man-in-the-Middle 
Explanation 128. Correct Answer: C. Typosquatting. The 
attacker relies on typographical errors made by users when 
inputting a URL into a web browser, then potentially tries to 
exploit the user in some manner on the deceptive site. 
Typosquatting, also known as URL hijacking, involves attackers 
registering domains that are misspellings of popular websites. 
The intent is often to deceive users who mistype a URL, leading 
them to malicious websites. 
Option A is incorrect. Spear Phishing targets specific 
individuals or companies with tailored attempts to steal 
information. The described scenario revolves around the 
exploitation of typographical errors, not a targeted email attack. 
Option B is incorrect. A Watering Hole Attack involves 
compromising a specific website or service that the target 
frequently uses. It doesn’t rely on typographical errors. 
Option D is incorrect. A Man-in-the-Middle attack involves an 
attacker secretly intercepting and potentially altering 
communication between two parties. This is not described in the 
scenario. 
Question 129. A major pharmaceutical company recently 
announced an increase in drug prices. Following the 
announcement, their website was taken offline by a DDoS 
	
 
223

attack, with a message posted online by a group claiming 
responsibility and demanding affordable healthcare for all. 
Which type of threat actor is MOST likely behind this attack? 
(A)       Unskilled attacker 
(B)       Insider threat 
(C)       Hacktivist 
(D)       Nation-state 
Explanation 129. Correct Answer: C. Hacktivist. Hacktivists 
are typically driven by political, social, or ideological motives. 
They use cyber attacks as a means to promote or protest certain 
issues. In this scenario, the attack on the pharmaceutical 
company is a form of protest against their pricing policies, 
making it characteristic of hacktivist behavior. 
Option A is incorrect. Unskilled attackers generally conduct 
attacks for personal bragging rights or mischief. They are not 
usually driven by ideological motives like demanding 
affordable healthcare. 
Option B is incorrect. Insider threats stem from individuals 
within the organization, often driven by personal grievances or 
financial gain. The described scenario shows a motive tied to a 
broader social issue, not a personal or internal motive. 
Option D is incorrect. Nation-states conduct cyber operations 
for political, espionage, or military reasons. Protesting drug 
prices is not in line with their typical objectives. 
Question 130. A government agency experienced a cyber 
incident where its communication platforms were breached. The 
	
 
224

intruders were not interested in extracting sensitive data or 
causing disruptions but were observed to be silently monitoring 
diplomatic communications for an extended period. What was 
the likely motivation of the attackers? 
(A)       To gain financial benefits from insider trading 
(B)       Espionage to understand and anticipate diplomatic 
moves 
(C)       Disgruntlement of an internal employee 
(D)       An attempt to expand their cybercriminal network 
Explanation 130. Correct Answer: B. Espionage to 
understand and anticipate diplomatic moves. Silently 
monitoring diplomatic communications without exfiltrating data 
or causing disruptions indicates a motivation to understand, 
anticipate, and potentially manipulate governmental or 
diplomatic actions. This is a classic example of espionage. 
Option A is incorrect. While sensitive information might 
indeed be valuable for insider trading, the focus on diplomatic 
communications suggests a broader strategic intent rather than 
just financial gain. 
Option C is incorrect. A disgruntled employee might engage in 
sabotage or data leakage, but silently monitoring diplomatic 
communications indicates a higher level of strategy and 
sophistication usually beyond personal vendettas. 
Option D is incorrect. The attackers’ actions were specific to 
monitoring diplomatic channels and did not indicate an attempt 
to recruit more systems or individuals into a criminal network. 
	
 
225

Question 131. Employees at a renowned software development 
firm frequently visit an industry-related forum to discuss the 
latest trends and technologies. Over the past month, several 
employees reported malware infections shortly after accessing 
the forum. An investigation suggests the forum was 
compromised to target the company’s developers specifically. 
Which type of attack most accurately describes this scenario? 
(A)       Spear Phishing 
(B)       Watering Hole 
(C)       Drive-by Download 
(D)       Whaling 
Explanation 131. Correct Answer: B. Watering Hole. The 
attack focused on a particular site that employees at the targeted 
organization are known to visit, intending to compromise those 
specific individuals. 
A watering hole attack involves compromising a website or 
online resource frequented by members of a particular group or 
organization. Once compromised, attackers can use the site to 
deploy malware to the targeted individuals. 
Option A is incorrect. Spear phishing is a targeted phishing 
attempt, typically via email, aimed at a specific individual or 
organization. It does not involve compromising websites that 
targets frequent. 
Option C is incorrect. While a drive-by download might be the 
method used to deliver malware once the forum was 
compromised, the overall strategy of targeting a specific site 
	
 
226

known to be frequented by the victims defines it as a watering 
hole attack. 
Option D is incorrect. Whaling is a type of phishing attack 
aimed at high-profile targets like CEOs or CFOs. It doesn’t 
involve compromising websites. 
Question 132. A cybersecurity analyst has noticed a series of 
sophisticated attacks against critical infrastructure systems in 
their country. The attacks are highly coordinated, well-funded, 
and appear to have specific geopolitical objectives. Which type 
of threat actor is MOST likely responsible for these attacks? 
(A)       Organized crime syndicates 
(B)       Script kiddies 
(C)       Insider threat 
(D)       Nation-state 
Explanation 132. Correct Answer: D. Nation-state. 
Sophisticated, coordinated, and well-funded attacks against 
national critical infrastructure with clear geopolitical objectives 
align most closely with the characteristics and motivations of 
nation-state actors. They often have vast resources and specific 
political or strategic motives, targeting critical infrastructures to 
cause significant impact or gain a strategic advantage. 
Option A is incorrect. While organized crime syndicates might 
be well-funded and capable of launching sophisticated attacks, 
they are typically driven by financial motives rather than 
geopolitical objectives. 
	
 
227

Option B is incorrect. Script kiddies are amateur hackers who 
use pre-written scripts or tools to exploit vulnerabilities. They 
typically lack the sophistication and resources to launch 
coordinated attacks against critical infrastructure. 
Option C is incorrect. Insider threats come from individuals 
within the organization, like employees or contractors. While 
they can be harmful, the described scenario is more indicative 
of an external, nation-state actor with significant resources and 
geopolitical motives.  
Question 133. A small business detected unauthorized access to 
its website. The attacker used default login credentials to gain 
access. What level of sophistication and capability does this 
attack suggest about the threat actor? 
(A)       Script kiddie with basic skills 
(B)       Expert attacker leveraging advanced techniques 
(C)       Nation-state actor with strategic objectives 
(D)       Organized crime syndicate targeting high-value assets 
Explanation 133. Correct Answer: A. Script kiddie with 
basic skills. Using default login credentials for unauthorized 
access typically indicates a low level of sophistication, as this 
method is basic and requires little to no technical skill. Such 
attackers, often termed “script kiddies,” usually exploit known 
vulnerabilities with pre-existing tools or scripts without fully 
understanding them. 
Option B is incorrect. An expert attacker would likely utilize 
more advanced techniques and not rely solely on default 
credentials. 
	
 
228

Option C is incorrect. While nation-state actors have the 
capability for sophisticated attacks, the use of default login 
credentials as the primary method of unauthorized access 
doesn’t align with the complex methodologies usually 
employed by such actors. 
Option D is incorrect. Organized crime syndicates, especially 
those targeting high-value assets, would employ more 
sophisticated techniques than merely using default login 
credentials. 
Question 134. Tech Enterprises is planning to release a new 
product. As part of the product’s creation, they’ve sourced 
components from various vendors. The security team is tasked 
with assessing risks linked to the supply chain. Which of the 
following is the MOST concerning risk when sourcing 
components from multiple vendors? 
(A)       Difficulty in tracking product warranty details from 
multiple vendors 
(B)       Increased product assembly time due to varied vendor 
delivery timelines 
(C)       Potential for introduction of insecure or 
compromised components 
(D)       The need for multiple purchase orders, leading to 
increased paperwork 
Explanation 134. Correct Answer: C. Potential for 
introduction of insecure or compromised components. When 
components are sourced from multiple vendors, there is a 
heightened risk that one or more components might have 
	
 
229

vulnerabilities or could be compromised, thus impacting the 
security of the overall product. 
The integrity and security of components are vital in product 
development, especially when those components are part of the 
supply chain from various vendors. If one vendor has lax 
security measures or gets compromised, the components they 
supply can introduce vulnerabilities into the finished product, 
affecting its overall security posture and potentially leading to 
data breaches or other cyber threats. 
Option A is incorrect. While tracking warranties is an 
operational concern, it doesn’t pose a direct security risk when 
sourcing components from multiple vendors. 
Option B is incorrect. Product assembly time and vendor 
delivery timelines are logistical and operational concerns, not 
primary security risks associated with supply chain vendors. 
Option D is incorrect. Managing multiple purchase orders is a 
business process challenge, not a primary security concern. 
Question 135. An employee of XYZ Corp downloaded a 
seemingly benign PDF file from a vendor’s website. After 
opening the PDF, the company’s intrusion detection system 
(IDS) alerted the security team about suspicious activity 
originating from the employee’s computer. The PDF file most 
likely contained which of the following threats? 
(A)       Watering Hole Attack 
(B)       Malicious Macro 
	
 
230

(C)       SQL Injection 
(D)       Credential Harvesting 
Explanation 135. Correct Answer: B. Malicious Macro. 
Many document types, including PDFs, can contain macros. A 
malicious macro can execute unwanted actions, such as 
downloading and installing malware, when the document is 
opened. 
Option A is incorrect. A Watering Hole Attack is when an 
attacker guesses or observes which websites an organization 
often uses and infects them with malware, with the intent of 
compromising members of that organization. The scenario does 
not provide evidence pointing to this kind of attack. 
Option C is incorrect. SQL Injection is a type of attack that 
aims to execute malicious SQL statements in a database. This 
type of attack is unrelated to opening a PDF file. 
Option D is incorrect. A Drive-By Download involves 
automatically downloading software, often malicious, without 
user knowledge or consent, typically when a user visits a 
compromised website. The scenario specifically discusses a 
downloaded and then manually opened PDF. 
Question 136. John, a security analyst, noticed an increase in 
unauthorized devices connecting to the company’s wireless 
network. To identify the reason, he realized that the wireless 
access points were still using an old encryption standard. Which 
outdated encryption standard is likely in use that is known to be 
easily compromised? 
	
 
231

(A)       WPA3 
(B)       WEP 
(C)       WPA2-PSK 
(D)       AES 
Explanation 136. Correct Answer: B. WEP. Wired Equivalent 
Privacy (WEP) is an old and outdated encryption protocol for 
wireless networks. It has several known vulnerabilities and is 
considered insecure, making it easier for attackers to 
compromise. 
Option A is incorrect. WPA3 is a newer and more secure 
encryption protocol for wireless networks and is considered a 
significant improvement over previous standards. 
Option C is incorrect. WPA2-PSK (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 
with Pre-Shared Key) is more secure than WEP. While it can 
still be targeted, it is not as easily compromised as WEP. 
Option D is incorrect. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is 
an encryption standard and not a wireless encryption protocol. It 
is often used within WPA2 and WPA3 for securing wireless 
data. 
Question 137. Lucy, a security analyst, is informed that several 
employees have been receiving unauthorized file transfer 
requests via Bluetooth when they are in the company’s 
cafeteria. Which of the following attacks is MOST likely being 
attempted? 
(A)       Bluejacking 
(B)       ARP poisoning 
	
 
232

(C)       Bluesnarfing 
(D)       Evil Twin 
Explanation 137. Correct Answer: A. Bluejacking. 
Bluejacking is the sending of unsolicited messages or files over 
Bluetooth to Bluetooth-enabled devices such as mobile phones, 
laptops, or PDAs. It is often used as a prank or to advertise to 
nearby people. 
Bluejacking does not give attackers control over the victim’s 
device, but it can be used to send unwanted messages or files, 
which aligns with the scenario described. 
Option B is incorrect. ARP poisoning is a type of attack in 
which an attacker sends falsified ARP (Address Resolution 
Protocol) messages over a local area network. It’s unrelated to 
Bluetooth communications. 
Option C is incorrect. Bluesnarfing is the unauthorized access 
of information from a wireless device through a Bluetooth 
connection. Bluesnarfing goes beyond just sending unsolicited 
messages; it seeks to access personal data. 
Option D is incorrect. An Evil Twin attack involves creating a 
rogue Wi-Fi hotspot to masquerade as a legitimate one, to 
intercept or manipulate data traffic. It does not directly involve 
Bluetooth connections. 
Question 138. Country A and Country B are engaged in an 
ongoing territorial dispute. Suddenly, critical infrastructure 
facilities in Country B, such as power plants and transportation 
	
 
233

hubs, experience systematic cyberattacks. No ransom demand is 
made, and the attacks lead to significant disruption. What is the 
most probable motivation behind these cyberattacks? 
(A)       Financial gain from market disruptions 
(B)       Ethical hackers testing vulnerabilities 
(C)       Disruption due to philosophical disagreements with 
Country B's policies 
(D)       Acts of cyberwarfare to weaken Country B's position 
Explanation 138. Correct Answer: D. Acts of cyberwarfare 
to weaken Country B’s position. Given the context of the 
territorial dispute and the specific targeting of critical 
infrastructures without any ransom demand, it’s highly likely 
that these attacks were intended as acts of cyberwarfare by 
Country A or its sympathizers to exert pressure on Country B. 
Option A is incorrect. While market disruptions can be 
exploited for financial gains, the context of a territorial dispute 
and the nature of the attacks suggest a motive tied to 
geopolitical strategy rather than financial advantage. 
Option B is incorrect. Ethical hackers typically identify and 
report vulnerabilities rather than exploit them to cause 
widespread disruption. 
Option C is incorrect. The attacks were too specific and large-
scale to be the work of individuals or groups motivated solely 
by philosophical disagreements. 
Question 139. Maria receives a text message on her phone from 
an unknown number, stating that she has won a gift card worth 
	
 
234

$500 from a popular online store. The message includes a link 
asking her to click on it to claim her prize. Maria is unsure 
about the authenticity of the message. Which of the following is 
the BEST course of action for Maria? 
(A)       Click the link to check if the website looks genuine 
(B)       Forward the message to her friends to verify if they 
received a similar message 
(C)       Delete the message without clicking on any links 
(D)       Respond to the sender asking for more details about the 
offer 
Explanation 139. Correct Answer: C. Delete the message 
without clicking on any links. Messages from unknown 
sources, especially those that sound too good to be true, often 
signal a potential security threat. It’s safest to delete such 
messages without interacting with any links. 
Smishing is a type of phishing attack wherein attackers use 
SMS to deceive users into divulging personal information, 
visiting a malicious website, or downloading malware onto their 
smartphones. Users should always be cautious of unsolicited 
messages from unknown numbers. 
Option A is incorrect. Clicking the link, even out of curiosity, 
can lead to a malicious website or download malware onto 
Maria’s device. 
Option B is incorrect. While forwarding the message to friends 
might give her insight into its authenticity, it could also expose 
her friends to potential threats if the message is malicious. 
	
 
235

Option D is incorrect. Responding to the sender could give 
them more information about Maria or confirm that her number 
is active, leading to further targeted attacks. 
Question 140. A retail company recently suffered a breach 
where attackers encrypted all point-of-sale systems, rendering 
them unusable. A ransom note was then received, demanding 
payment in cryptocurrency to decrypt the systems. What 
motivation is most evident behind this attack? 
(A)       Protesting against the company's environmental policies 
(B)       Financial gain through ransom 
(C)       Espionage to understand the company's supply chain 
(D)       Seeking a reputation boost by showing off technical 
skills 
Explanation 140. Correct Answer: B. Financial gain through 
ransom. The attackers encrypted critical systems and then 
demanded a ransom to decrypt them. The primary motive in 
such ransomware attacks is to achieve financial gain by 
compelling the victim to pay to regain access to their systems. 
Option A is incorrect. There’s no mention or indication that the 
attackers were motivated by the company’s environmental or 
any other policies. 
Option C is incorrect. There’s no evidence suggesting the 
attackers were interested in the company’s supply chain or any 
other internal information. Their focus was on encryption and 
ransom. 
	
 
236

Option D is incorrect. While demonstrating technical skills 
might be a byproduct of the attack, the direct demand for 
payment indicates that financial gain, not notoriety, is the 
primary motive. 
Question 141. A company detected a DDoS attack that lasted 
for several weeks. The attackers used a botnet of millions of 
infected devices and frequently rotated attack vectors to bypass 
mitigation efforts. This prolonged and resource-intensive attack 
suggests which kind of threat actor’s resources and funding? 
(A)       Amateur hacker with minimal resources 
(B)       Cybersecurity researcher testing vulnerabilities 
(C)       Nation-state actor with strategic interests 
(D)       Organized crime syndicate with substantial funding 
Explanation 141. Correct Answer: D. Organized crime 
syndicate with substantial funding. The scale and duration of 
the DDoS attack, combined with the use of a massive botnet 
and frequent rotation of attack vectors, point to a threat actor 
with significant resources. While nation-states could conduct 
such attacks, DDoS campaigns are also a hallmark of well-
funded organized crime syndicates, especially when financial or 
strategic extortion could be a motive. 
Option A is incorrect. An amateur hacker with minimal 
resources would not have the capability to sustain a large-scale 
DDoS attack using a botnet of millions of devices over several 
weeks. 
	
 
237

Option B is incorrect. Cybersecurity researchers typically do 
not engage in malicious activities, and launching a prolonged 
DDoS attack would be unethical and illegal. 
Option C is incorrect. While a nation-state actor might have 
the resources to launch such an attack, DDoS attacks, especially 
those of extortion nature, are more commonly associated with 
organized crime syndicates. 
Question 142. In a routine security assessment, Claire found 
that a newly deployed database server within her organization is 
still using its default login credentials. Which of the following is 
the PRIMARY security risk associated with this finding? 
(A)       The database will not function optimally 
(B)       The server will need frequent patches 
(C)       Unauthorized individuals may easily gain access 
(D)       The server will consume more bandwidth 
Explanation 142. Correct Answer: C. Unauthorized 
individuals may easily gain access. Default credentials are 
often publicly known, and if they are not changed, malicious 
actors can easily use them to gain unauthorized access to 
systems. 
Default credentials, which may include usernames and 
passwords set by manufacturers for initial setup, are widely 
known and can be easily searched online. If not changed after 
deployment, they pose a significant security risk as they allow 
anyone with this knowledge to gain access to the system. 
	
 
238

Option A is incorrect. The use of default credentials doesn’t 
directly impact the optimal functioning of the database. 
Option B is incorrect. The use of default credentials doesn’t 
mean that the server will need frequent patches. However, patch 
management is a separate aspect of maintaining server security. 
Option D is incorrect. The use of default credentials doesn’t 
directly cause the server to consume more bandwidth. 
Question 143. During a major sports event, a broadcasting 
company’s streaming services were taken offline by a sudden 
surge in traffic. The attack continued for the duration of the 
event and then subsided. What was the most probable 
motivation behind this attack? 
(A)       Espionage to intercept sensitive communications 
(B)       To cause a service disruption during the sports event 
(C)       Data exfiltration for future ransom demands 
(D)       To gain unauthorized access and implant malware 
Explanation 143. Correct Answer: B. To cause a service 
disruption during the sports event. The surge in traffic 
specifically timed with the sports event and its subsequent 
subsiding after the event indicates a targeted intention to disrupt 
the service during the sports event. 
Option A is incorrect. There is no indication in the scenario 
that the attacker was interested in intercepting communications, 
especially since the target was a broadcasting company and not 
a diplomatic or governmental agency. 
	
 
239

Option C is incorrect. The scenario does not mention any 
exfiltration of data or follow-up ransom demands. The focus of 
the attacker was on disrupting the streaming service. 
Option D is incorrect. Although taking services offline can 
sometimes be a cover for more malicious activities, there’s no 
evidence in this scenario to suggest that malware was implanted 
or unauthorized access was achieved. 
Question 144. An employee receives a call from someone 
claiming to be from the IT department. The caller says there’s 
an urgent update required on the employee’s computer and asks 
for login credentials to perform the update remotely. The 
employee becomes suspicious because of which red flag 
regarding impersonation? 
(A)       The caller did not use technical jargon 
(B)       IT normally sends email notifications about updates 
(C)       The employee was not expecting any updates 
(D)       The caller's voice sounded unfamiliar 
Explanation 144. Correct Answer: B. IT normally sends 
email notifications about updates. If the organization’s 
standard procedure is to send email notifications about updates, 
an unsolicited call asking for credentials would be a clear red 
flag. 
Impersonation is a common tactic used in social engineering 
attacks where the attacker pretends to be someone the victim 
trusts. Recognizing deviations from standard procedures can 
help identify impersonation attempts. 
	
 
240

Option A is incorrect. The use or lack of technical jargon isn’t 
a reliable indicator of impersonation. Some genuine IT 
personnel might avoid jargon to make things clearer for non-
tech-savvy employees. 
Option C is incorrect. While unexpected updates can be 
suspicious, they aren’t necessarily indicative of impersonation 
on their own. Legitimate unexpected updates can occur. 
Option D is incorrect. An unfamiliar voice isn’t a reliable 
indicator since large organizations might have many IT 
personnel that an employee hasn’t interacted with. 
Question 145. During an e-commerce website audit, a security 
analyst discovers that if a user tries to purchase a product and 
simultaneously cancels the order, the product sometimes gets 
added to the user’s cart without deducting any funds. This 
vulnerability can potentially be exploited to obtain products for 
free. Which vulnerability type is the e-commerce website 
susceptible to? 
(A)       Directory Traversal 
(B)       Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) 
(C)       Race Condition 
(D)       Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
Explanation 145. Correct Answer: C. Race Condition. When 
an application’s unintended behavior is due to the timing of 
concurrent events or operations, it indicates a race condition. 
Here, the simultaneous purchase and cancellation result in a 
faulty outcome. 
	
 
241

A race condition occurs when an application’s behavior is 
dependent on the order or timing of uncontrollable events. If 
two operations, which aren’t meant to happen simultaneously, 
occur at the same time, it can lead to unpredictable and 
unintended outcomes, like the described scenario where a 
product is added without payment due to the concurrency of 
purchase and cancellation. 
Option A is incorrect. Directory Traversal vulnerabilities allow 
attackers to access files and directories that are stored outside 
the intended folder. This doesn’t align with the described 
scenario. 
Option B is incorrect. Insecure Direct Object References 
(IDOR) vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can access 
resources they’re not authorized for by manipulating input, such 
as URL or form parameters. It’s unrelated to the timing or 
concurrency of actions. 
Option D is incorrect. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request. It’s about 
unauthorized actions rather than issues arising from the timing 
of legitimate ones. 
Question 146. Maria, a network administrator, receives a report 
detailing several open service ports on critical company servers. 
She wants to verify the accuracy of the report. Which of the 
following tools would be BEST for Maria to use to validate the 
findings? 
(A)       Password cracker 
(B)       Port scanner 
	
 
242

(C)       IDS (Intrusion Detection System) 
(D)       Web application firewall 
Explanation 146. Correct Answer: B. Port scanner. A port 
scanner, such as Nmap, sends packets to specific ports on a 
network and then listens for responses. This allows the scanner 
to determine which ports are open and potentially identify the 
services running on those ports. 
Option A is incorrect. Password crackers are used to identify 
weak or easily guessable passwords. They don’t validate open 
service ports. 
Option C is incorrect. An IDS monitors network traffic for 
suspicious activity. While it can identify potential attacks, it 
doesn’t directly verify open service ports. 
Option D is incorrect. A web application firewall (WAF) 
protects web applications by monitoring, filtering, and blocking 
potentially harmful HTTP traffic. It doesn’t serve the purpose of 
validating open service ports. 
Question 147. John, a senior executive at XYZ Corp., gets a 
call from someone claiming to be from the bank’s fraud 
department. The caller asks John to confirm certain transactions 
by providing the OTP sent to his registered mobile number. 
What form of social engineering attack is John likely facing? 
(A)       Baiting 
(B)       Quizzing 
(C)       Vishing 
(D)       Pharming 
	
 
243

Explanation 147. Correct Answer: C. Vishing. Vishing, short 
for voice phishing, is the act of using the telephone to scam the 
user into surrendering private information that will be used for 
identity theft. 
Vishing attacks capitalize on trust, using voice calls to 
manipulate victims into divulging sensitive information. 
Attackers often pose as legitimate entities or departments, like a 
bank’s fraud department, to make their scam appear genuine. 
Option A is incorrect. Baiting involves luring a victim into 
downloading malicious software under the guise of a free or 
beneficial download. 
Option B is incorrect. Quizzing isn’t a recognized type of 
social engineering attack. 
Option D is incorrect. Pharming involves redirecting a 
website’s traffic to a bogus site, often to capture login 
credentials. 
Question 148. Jane, a security analyst, receives a report about 
network slowdowns happening at specific times of the day. 
After investigating, she discovers that a device is flooding the 
network with traffic, causing legitimate requests to be dropped. 
Which type of attack is this device likely performing? 
(A)       Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) 
(B)       ARP poisoning 
(C)       MAC flooding 
(D)       DNS amplification 
	
 
244

Explanation 148. Correct Answer: C. MAC flooding. MAC 
flooding is an attack that aims to flood the switch’s MAC table 
with fake MAC addresses until the table overflows. Once it 
overflows, the switch acts as a hub broadcasting packets to all 
machines in the network. This can cause significant slowdowns 
and disruptions. 
Option A is incorrect. A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) 
attack uses multiple compromised devices to flood a target with 
traffic, usually to overwhelm it and take it offline. The scenario 
describes an internal network slowdown, not an external attack 
on services. 
Option B is incorrect. ARP poisoning is an attack where false 
ARP messages are sent over a local area network. It’s used to 
link an attacker’s MAC address with the IP address of another 
host. While it can cause disruptions, the primary intent is not to 
flood the network. 
Option D is incorrect. DNS amplification is a type of DDoS 
attack where an attacker uses publically-accessible DNS servers 
to flood a target system with DNS response traffic. This does 
not fit the internal network flooding described in the scenario. 
Question 149. A software development team in a large 
corporation decided to use an unauthorized cloud-based tool to 
host and manage their source code. The team believed it would 
increase their productivity, even though it was not approved by 
the IT department. A few weeks later, unauthorized access to 
their project data was detected. Which threat actor concept 
BEST describes the situation? 
	
 
245

(A)       Insider threat 
(B)       Hacktivist 
(C)       Shadow IT 
(D)       Organized crime syndicate 
Explanation 149. Correct Answer: C. Shadow IT. Shadow IT 
refers to any IT systems or solutions used within an 
organization without organizational approval or oversight. This 
can introduce vulnerabilities, as the unauthorized systems might 
not meet the security standards set by the organization’s IT 
department. In this scenario, the software development team’s 
unauthorized use of a cloud tool exemplifies Shadow IT. 
Option A is incorrect. While the software development team 
acted without approval, their intention was to increase 
productivity, not to harm the organization. Therefore, this 
situation does not fit the typical definition of an “insider threat,” 
which usually has malicious intent. 
Option B is incorrect. Hacktivists are motivated by political or 
social causes. There’s no evidence in the scenario to suggest 
that political or social motivations were behind the team’s 
decision. 
Option D is incorrect. While the data was accessed without 
authorization, there’s no evidence to suggest that this was the 
work of an organized crime syndicate. The main issue at hand is 
the unauthorized use of IT resources, which is a hallmark of 
Shadow IT. 
	
 
246

Question 150. A software company recently discovered a 
vulnerability in its popular application, which allowed 
unauthorized access to users’ data. Before the company could 
release a patch, a group of hackers exploited the vulnerability 
but only to notify the users about it. They did not misuse any 
data. What is the most probable motivation behind this group’s 
action? 
(A)       Financial gain by selling the data 
(B)       Political beliefs against the software company's 
operations 
(C)       Ethical concerns about user privacy and security 
(D)       Desire to disrupt the software company's services 
Explanation 150. Correct Answer: C. Ethical concerns 
about user privacy and security. The hackers did not misuse 
the data but instead chose to inform the users about the 
vulnerability, suggesting their motivation was based on ethical 
considerations to ensure users are aware of potential threats to 
their privacy. 
Option A is incorrect. The hackers did not sell or misuse the 
data, which means financial gain wasn’t their primary objective. 
Option B is incorrect. There’s no indication that the hackers’ 
actions were driven by political beliefs against the software 
company. 
Option D is incorrect. While the hackers did exploit a 
vulnerability, they did not aim to disrupt the company’s services 
but to inform users about the vulnerability. 
	
 
247

Question 151. An environmental NGO’s website was hacked 
and replaced with a message decrying their recent campaign 
against deforestation, claiming they are spreading 
misinformation. The website was left with a manifesto 
promoting responsible forestry and sustainable logging 
practices. Which type of threat actor is MOST likely behind this 
incident? 
(A)       Ransomware gang 
(B)       Organized crime syndicate 
(C)       Hacktivist 
(D)       Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) 
Explanation 151. Correct Answer: C. Hacktivist. The attack 
seems to be motivated by ideological differences regarding 
deforestation and sustainable logging. Hacktivists typically 
conduct cyber actions to make political or social statements. 
The replacement of the NGO’s website with a manifesto 
supports the idea that this is an ideologically motivated attack, 
typical of hacktivists. 
Option A is incorrect. Ransomware gangs primarily focus on 
encrypting data and demanding payment for its release. There is 
no mention of a ransom or encrypted data in the described 
scenario. 
Option B is incorrect. Organized crime syndicates are usually 
motivated by financial gains. The attack on the NGO’s website 
seems to be ideologically driven, not profit-driven. 
Option D is incorrect. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are 
highly organized, often state-sponsored groups that conduct 
	
 
248

prolonged cyber-espionage campaigns. Their motivations are 
typically strategic, political, or espionage-driven. The described 
attack doesn’t fit the profile of an APT operation. 
Question 152. An IT security analyst at a multinational 
corporation receives an email from the “HR Department” 
requesting urgent verification of his personal details, including 
his home address and social security number. The email has the 
company’s logo but has several spelling errors. Which type of 
email-based threat is this email most likely representing? 
(A)       Business Email Compromise (BEC) 
(B)       Email bombing 
(C)       Email forwarding 
(D)       Phishing 
Explanation 152. Correct Answer: D. Phishing. Phishing 
emails aim to deceive recipients into sharing personal or 
sensitive data by impersonating a trusted source. The email’s 
dubious quality, such as spelling errors, combined with the 
request for personal details, is indicative of a typical phishing 
attempt. 
Option A is incorrect. While BEC is a type of targeted scam 
using email, it usually involves impersonating executives or 
high-ranking officials within an organization to initiate 
unauthorized fund transfers. The described scenario does not 
align with that. 
Option B is incorrect. Email bombing involves sending large 
volumes of emails to a single recipient, typically to overwhelm 
	
 
249

the system or hide other malicious activities. This scenario does 
not describe such an attack. 
Option C is incorrect. Email forwarding refers to the 
automated redirection of email from one address to another. It is 
not a direct threat in itself but can be misused. The described 
scenario does not align with that. 
Question 153. After being fired from his position as a senior 
network administrator at XYZ Corp, John discovered a 
backdoor into the company’s main server that he had previously 
set up. He then initiated a series of Distributed Denial of 
Service (DDoS) attacks over a month. What is the most 
probable motivation behind John’s actions? 
(A)       Ethical concerns about the company's data handling 
(B)       Financial gain by selling access to the backdoor 
(C)       Desire to research and find vulnerabilities for personal 
growth 
(D)       Revenge against the company for his termination 
Explanation 153. Correct Answer: D. Revenge against the 
company for his termination. Given that John acted after 
being fired and initiated disruptive attacks, it’s evident that his 
actions were motivated by a desire for revenge against his 
former employer. 
Option A is incorrect. There’s no indication in the scenario that 
John had ethical concerns regarding the company’s data 
practices. 
	
 
250

Option B is incorrect. The scenario doesn’t mention John 
selling access to the backdoor, only that he initiated DDoS 
attacks. 
Option C is incorrect. John’s actions after termination seem 
malicious rather than a pursuit of knowledge or research. 
Question 154. A financial institution recently discovered that a 
large number of confidential customer records were being 
accessed and copied during off-business hours. Upon 
investigation, it was found that the access came from an 
authenticated user within the company, who had recently been 
passed over for a promotion. Which type of threat actor is 
MOST likely responsible for this security incident? 
(A)       Hacktivist 
(B)       Insider threat 
(C)       Nation-state 
(D)       Organized crime syndicate 
Explanation 154. Correct Answer: B. Insider threat. The 
evidence suggests the activities were conducted by an 
authenticated user within the organization, who might have a 
motive (having been passed over for a promotion). Insider 
threats are risks from individuals within the organization such 
as employees, contractors, or business associates, who have 
inside information concerning the organization’s security 
practices, data, and computer systems. 
Option A is incorrect. Hacktivists are typically motivated by 
political or social causes and will target organizations to 
promote or protest a specific issue. They are not usually 
	
 
251

motivated by personal grievances like being passed over for 
promotions. 
Option C is incorrect. Nation-states are driven by political, 
espionage, or military objectives. Accessing customer records of 
a financial institution for personal reasons doesn’t align with 
their typical motivations. 
Option D is incorrect. While organized crime syndicates might 
have an interest in customer records for financial gains, the 
inside access and the motive related to a missed promotion 
strongly suggest an insider threat. 
Question 155. The finance department of a global corporation 
found a series of unauthorized transactions originating from an 
employee’s workstation. Investigations revealed that the 
employee had been bypassing company policies to make 
unauthorized investments using company funds. Based on the 
attributes of the actor, how can this threat actor be best 
categorized? 
(A)       External actor leveraging malware 
(B)       External actor exploiting vulnerabilities 
(C)       Internal actor with direct access 
(D)       Internal actor with indirect access 
Explanation 155. Correct Answer: C. Internal actor with 
direct access. The threat originated from an employee’s 
workstation within the organization, making it an internal threat. 
Since the employee used their own workstation and credentials 
to make unauthorized transactions, they had direct access, 
categorizing them as an internal actor with direct access. 
	
 
252

Option A is incorrect. There’s no mention of malware being 
used in this scenario, and the unauthorized transactions came 
from an employee’s workstation, indicating an internal rather 
than external threat. 
Option B is incorrect. The scenario doesn’t describe an 
external actor exploiting vulnerabilities. Instead, it describes an 
employee making unauthorized transactions from within the 
organization. 
Option D is incorrect. The employee in this scenario had direct 
access to the company’s resources, as they used their own 
workstation and credentials. Thus, they aren’t categorized as 
having indirect access. 
Question 156. While conducting a security assessment, Lucy 
found that a specific application crashes when she inputs a 
string that is much longer than what the input field is designed 
to handle. This could potentially allow her to execute arbitrary 
code in the application’s context. What vulnerability is Lucy 
likely trying to exploit? 
(A)       SQL Injection 
(B)       Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
(C)       Buffer Overflow 
(D)       Directory Traversal 
Explanation 156. Correct Answer: C. Buffer Overflow. 
Buffer overflow vulnerabilities occur when data written to a 
buffer exceeds that buffer’s boundaries, potentially overwriting 
adjacent memory locations. If exploited successfully, it can lead 
to arbitrary code execution. 
	
 
253

Buffer overflow is a condition where an application writes more 
data to a buffer than it can hold, causing the excess data to 
overflow into adjacent memory spaces. When this happens, 
attackers can overwrite specific parts of the memory, which 
may lead to arbitrary code execution, application crashes, or 
data corruption. 
Option A is incorrect. SQL Injection involves injecting 
malicious SQL statements into an entry field for execution, 
aiming to manipulate a database. It doesn’t relate to buffer 
boundaries or memory overflows. 
Option B is incorrect. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allows 
attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by 
other users. While this is an input validation flaw like a buffer 
overflow, XSS specifically targets script execution within web 
browsers and does not involve overflowing buffer boundaries. 
Option D is incorrect. Directory Traversal attacks aim to 
access files and directories stored outside the web root folder. 
They don’t involve overflowing buffer boundaries or memory 
overflows. 
Question 157. XYZ Corp is implementing a new vulnerability 
scanning solution. The security team wants a solution that does 
not require any software to be installed on the target machines 
but can still identify vulnerabilities. Which type of vulnerability 
scanning solution should they choose? 
(A)       Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) 
(B)       Agentless Vulnerability Scanner 
	
 
254

(C)       Client-based Vulnerability Scanner 
(D)       Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) 
Explanation 157. Correct Answer: B. Agentless 
Vulnerability Scanner. An agentless vulnerability scanner does 
not require any software (agent) to be installed on the target 
systems. Instead, it remotely scans the systems and identifies 
vulnerabilities by checking against a database of known 
vulnerabilities. 
Option A is incorrect. Host-based Intrusion Detection System 
(HIDS) monitors the internal workings of a computing system, 
not for vulnerabilities but for signs of unauthorized or malicious 
activity. 
Option C is incorrect. Client-based Vulnerability Scanner 
requires an agent or software component to be installed on the 
target system to perform the vulnerability assessment. 
Option D is incorrect. Host-based Intrusion Prevention System 
(HIPS) is designed to detect and prevent malicious activity on a 
particular device, not to scan for vulnerabilities. 
Question 158. A healthcare institution suffered a breach where 
medical records of high-profile patients were extracted. The 
data was not sold or publicly disclosed. Instead, certain 
individuals were approached with their personal health 
information and were extorted for money. What is the primary 
motivation behind this cyber attack? 
(A)       Political activism to expose vulnerabilities in healthcare 
(B)       Personal animosity targeting the healthcare institution 
	
 
255

(C)       Financial gain through targeted extortion 
(D)       Spreading malware and expanding the botnet 
Explanation 158. Correct Answer: C. Financial gain 
through targeted extortion. Approaching specific individuals 
with their personal health data for the purpose of extortion 
indicates a clear motivation of financial gain. 
Option A is incorrect. While political activists might expose 
vulnerabilities in sectors like healthcare, they generally do so to 
raise awareness rather than for personal financial gain. 
Option B is incorrect. There’s no evidence from the given 
scenario to suggest that the attack was fueled by personal 
animosity towards the institution. 
Option D is incorrect. The attackers’ actions did not revolve 
around spreading malware or increasing a botnet’s size but 
rather focused on individual extortion based on exfiltrated data. 
Question 159. During a major international sporting event, a 
group of unidentified hackers simultaneously launched 
cyberattacks against multiple infrastructures in the host city, 
including transportation networks, power grids, and 
telecommunication systems. There was no ransom demand or 
any clear financial motive behind the attacks. What is the most 
probable motivation behind these actions? 
(A)       Financial gain from selling stolen data 
(B)       Ethical concerns about the environmental impact of the 
sporting event 
(C)       Revenge against a particular athlete or team 
	
 
256

(D)       Desire to create disruption and chaos during the 
event 
Explanation 159. Correct Answer: D. Desire to create 
disruption and chaos during the event. Given the wide array 
of targets and the timing of the attacks during a major event 
without a clear financial motive, it’s evident that the main goal 
of the hackers was to create widespread disruption and chaos. 
Option A is incorrect. There’s no indication in the scenario that 
data was stolen or sold, and no clear financial motive was 
presented. 
Option B is incorrect. While ethical concerns might be a 
possible reason for some attacks, the scale and targets of these 
attacks suggest a broader motive of causing disruption. 
Option C is incorrect. The scenario doesn’t specify any 
particular focus on an athlete or team; the attacks were 
widespread, impacting the entire event. 
Question 160. A medium-sized financial firm has noticed a 
series of unauthorized transactions moving funds from 
legitimate accounts to overseas locations. After investigating, it 
was found that a group was responsible for exploiting 
vulnerabilities in the firm’s transaction system. Which of the 
following motivations is most likely driving this group’s 
actions? 
(A)       Seeking notoriety within the hacker community 
(B)       Financial gain from unauthorized transactions 
(C)       Demonstrating political beliefs against financial 
	
 
257

institutions 
(D)       Espionage to uncover the firm's investment strategies 
Explanation 160. Correct Answer: B. Financial gain from 
unauthorized transactions. The unauthorized transactions 
moving funds to overseas locations indicate a direct attempt to 
illicitly acquire funds, pointing towards a motivation of 
financial gain. 
Option A is incorrect. There’s no evidence to suggest the 
group’s actions are driven by a desire for recognition or 
notoriety. The focus is on moving funds. 
Option C is incorrect. While some groups might target 
financial institutions to make a political statement, the 
unauthorized transactions to overseas accounts suggest a 
financial motive, not a political one. 
Option D is incorrect. There’s no indication the group is 
interested in the firm’s investment strategies. The activity is 
focused on moving money, not gathering intelligence. 
Question 161. An organization’s e-commerce platform 
experienced a data breach where attackers exploited a known 
vulnerability. Post-incident analysis revealed that a patch was 
available for this vulnerability two months before the breach but 
was not applied. Which of the following would have been the 
MOST effective measure to prevent this breach? 
(A)       Implementing stronger user authentication methods 
(B)       Increasing network monitoring for signs of malicious 
activity 
	
 
258

(C)       Applying the available patch in a timely manner 
(D)       Migrating to a different e-commerce platform 
Explanation 161. Correct Answer: C. Applying the available 
patch in a timely manner. Patches are developed by software 
vendors to address known vulnerabilities in their software. 
Timely application of these patches is crucial to ensuring that 
systems are protected against known threats. In this scenario, 
applying the available patch would have directly addressed the 
vulnerability that was exploited. 
Option A is incorrect. While implementing stronger user 
authentication methods can enhance security, it wouldn’t 
directly mitigate a vulnerability in the software that could be 
exploited without authentication. 
Option B is incorrect. Increasing network monitoring can help 
detect malicious activity, but it doesn’t prevent the exploitation 
of a known software vulnerability. 
Option D is incorrect. Migrating to a different platform is a 
drastic measure that might introduce new vulnerabilities and 
would not ensure security unless accompanied by good patch 
management practices. 
Question 162. Sophia, a network administrator, is reviewing the 
logs from the company’s Intrusion Detection System (IDS). She 
notices an increased amount of outbound traffic to an unfamiliar 
IP address. Upon deeper analysis, she found that the traffic 
consists of sensitive data being transferred. What type of 
malicious code might be responsible for this? 
	
 
259

(A)       Ransomware 
(B)       Adware 
(C)       Data Exfiltration Malware 
(D)       Keylogger 
Explanation 162. Correct Answer: C. Data Exfiltration 
Malware. Data Exfiltration Malware is designed to extract and 
transfer sensitive data from the target system to a location 
controlled by the attacker. The fact that sensitive data is being 
transferred to an unfamiliar IP address points to this type of 
malicious code. 
Option A is incorrect. Ransomware is a type of malware that 
encrypts the victim’s files and demands a ransom to restore 
access. While it might involve data theft, it’s primarily known 
for encryption and ransom demands, not for transferring data 
outward. 
Option B is incorrect. Adware is a type of software that 
displays unwanted ads on a user’s computer. While it might be 
intrusive and unwanted, it doesn’t typically exfiltrate data. 
Option D is incorrect. A Keylogger is designed to record 
keystrokes on a computer and may capture sensitive data like 
passwords. However, the primary behavior of a keylogger is 
capturing keystrokes, not transferring large amounts of data 
outward. 
Question 163. During a security assessment of an application, 
Ryan found that he was able to input larger-than-expected data 
into a field. Upon doing so, he noticed the application became 
	
 
260

unresponsive and eventually crashed. What type of vulnerability 
might Ryan have uncovered? 
(A)       Input Validation Error 
(B)       Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
(C)       Buffer Overflow 
(D)       Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) 
Explanation 163. Correct Answer: C. Buffer Overflow. 
Buffer overflow vulnerabilities occur when an application 
allows more input data than it can securely handle in its 
allocated buffer space, leading to overwritten adjacent memory. 
This can lead to application crashes, or potentially, arbitrary 
code execution by an attacker. 
Option A is incorrect. While input validation error can lead to 
various vulnerabilities, it is a broad category. In the given 
scenario, the direct consequence of entering larger than 
expected data is an application crash, which points directly to a 
buffer overflow. 
Option B is incorrect. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into 
web pages viewed by other users. It doesn’t cause application 
crashes due to oversized input. 
Option D is incorrect. Insecure Direct Object Reference 
(IDOR) vulnerabilities occur when an application provides 
direct access to objects based on user input. It does not cause 
crashes due to excessive data input.

Question 164. Jake recently ran an old game on his computer 
that he received from a friend. Shortly after, he discovered that 
some of his documents were duplicated with slight 
modifications, and his system’s performance was deteriorating. 
Which kind of malware most likely caused these issues? 
(A)       Adware 
(B)       Trojan 
(C)       Worm 
(D)       Virus 
Explanation 164. Correct Answer: D. Virus. Viruses are 
malicious programs that attach to clean files and can replicate, 
leading to multiple instances of themselves. They can modify or 
corrupt these files and can degrade system performance as they 
propagate. 
Option A is incorrect. Adware primarily focuses on delivering 
unwanted advertisements to the user. While it can be annoying, 
it doesn’t typically duplicate or modify documents. 
Option B is incorrect. Trojans are malicious software that 
disguises themselves as legitimate programs. While they can 
perform a variety of malicious actions, they don’t self-replicate 
or modify files in the manner described. 
Option C is incorrect. Worms are self-replicating malware that 
spread across networks. While they can cause performance 
issues, they don’t typically attach to files and modify them as 
viruses do.

Question 165. The IT department of an e-commerce company 
is configuring access controls for a new online product 
inventory system. They want the sales team to update the 
inventory levels and product details but don’t want them to 
access financial data stored in the same system. Which access 
control principle is the IT department applying? 
(A)       Least Privilege 
(B)       Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 
(C)       Mandatory Access Control (MAC) 
(D)       User-Based Access Control (UBAC) 
Explanation 165. Correct Answer: B. Role-Based Access 
Control (RBAC). Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) assigns 
permissions based on roles within an organization. Individuals 
are then assigned roles, and the permissions associated with that 
role determine what they can and cannot access. In this 
scenario, the sales team would be given a role that allows them 
to update inventory but restricts access to financial data. 
Option A is incorrect. While the principle of Least Privilege 
dictates that users should only be given the minimal necessary 
access to perform their tasks, the scenario specifically focuses 
on roles (sales team) and the permissions associated with that 
role, which aligns more with RBAC. 
Option C is incorrect. Mandatory Access Control (MAC) uses 
labels (e.g., classification levels) to determine access. It’s more 
rigid than RBAC and isn’t described in the given scenario. 
Option D is incorrect. User-Based Access Control (UBAC) 
assigns permissions directly to each user, rather than based on 
	
 
263

their role. The scenario emphasizes role-based permissions, 
making RBAC the appropriate choice. 
Question 166. The IT team at a manufacturing company is 
deploying an IoT-based monitoring system for their machinery. 
They want to ensure that these IoT devices, if compromised, 
cannot adversely affect their main corporate network. What 
should they implement to achieve this? 
(A)       Install antivirus software on all IoT devices 
(B)       Regularly patch and update the IoT device firmware 
(C)       Place the IoT devices on a dedicated VLAN 
(D)       Enable multi-factor authentication for IoT devices 
Explanation 166. Correct Answer: C. Place the IoT devices 
on a dedicated VLAN. Placing the IoT devices on a dedicated 
VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) provides network 
isolation, ensuring that the devices are segregated from the main 
corporate network. This strategy ensures that if an IoT device is 
compromised, it doesn’t pose a direct threat to the core 
corporate network systems. 
Option A is incorrect. Many IoT devices may not support 
traditional antivirus software, and even if they do, this doesn’t 
achieve the network isolation desired. 
Option B is incorrect. While regularly patching and updating 
device firmware is crucial for security, it doesn’t provide 
network isolation from the main corporate network. 
	
 
264

Option D is incorrect. Enabling multi-factor authentication can 
enhance the security of devices but doesn’t provide the network 
isolation specified in the scenario. 
Question 167. A cloud-based collaboration tool used by a 
company displays a warning to a user stating, “You are logged 
in from two locations.” However, the user has only one active 
session on their workstation. What should be the primary 
concern for the security team? 
(A)       The user might be using multiple devices 
(B)       There's a potential misconfiguration in the tool's settings 
(C)       The collaboration tool is facing an outage 
(D)       There might be unauthorized access to the user's 
account 
Explanation 167. Correct Answer: D. There might be 
unauthorized access to the user’s account. Warnings of 
concurrent sessions, especially when the user is certain they’re 
using only one device, are red flags for potential unauthorized 
access. The security team should treat this as a priority and 
investigate for signs of a breach. 
Option A is incorrect. While users often use multiple devices, 
the scenario mentions the user is certain they have only one 
active session, making this option unlikely. 
Option B is incorrect. While misconfigurations can cause 
various issues, they don’t typically manifest as false concurrent 
session warnings. 
	
 
265

Option C is incorrect. An outage in the collaboration tool 
would not typically cause a false warning of multiple active 
sessions. 
Question 168. The IT department of a software development 
company wants to ensure that only company-approved 
development tools can be executed in their development 
environment, preventing any unauthorized or potentially 
harmful software from running. What should the IT department 
employ to achieve this? 
(A)       Implement network segmentation 
(B)       Conduct regular vulnerability assessments 
(C)       Install a stateful firewall 
(D)       Establish an application allow list 
Explanation 168. Correct Answer: D. Establish an 
application allow list. Establishing an application allow list 
would ensure that only specific, pre-approved applications can 
run in the development environment. This would prevent any 
unauthorized or potentially malicious software from being 
executed, aligning directly with the company’s goal. 
Option A is incorrect. While network segmentation can isolate 
different parts of the network and limit the spread of potential 
threats, it does not prevent unauthorized applications from 
running within a segment. 
Option B is incorrect. Regular vulnerability assessments 
identify weaknesses in systems, but they don’t proactively 
prevent specific applications from running. 
	
 
266

Option C is incorrect. A stateful firewall monitors the state of 
active connections and can block or allow traffic based on 
stateful parameters, but it doesn’t regulate which applications 
can be executed on a workstation. 
Question 169. A large law firm has a centralized document 
repository where lawyers store client information, legal drafts, 
and other sensitive data. A new paralegal, Jenna, joins the firm 
and needs to be able to view client documents but should not be 
able to modify or delete them. Which type of permission should 
be granted to Jenna? 
(A)       Read-Only 
(B)       Full Control 
(C)       Modify 
(D)       Execute 
Explanation 169. Correct Answer: A. Read-Only. The Read-
Only permission allows users to view and open files or 
resources but does not allow them to modify, delete, or execute 
them. In this scenario, granting Jenna Read-Only access ensures 
she can view client documents without making any alterations 
or deletions. 
Option B is incorrect. Full Control would give Jenna the 
ability to modify, delete, and even change the permissions of the 
documents, which exceeds the necessary permissions for her 
role. 
Option C is incorrect. The Modify permission allows a user to 
make changes to documents, which is not appropriate for Jenna 
based on the scenario’s requirements. 
	
 
267

Option D is incorrect. Execute permission is typically related 
to running programs or scripts and is not relevant to Jenna’s 
need to view documents. 
Question 170. A company is developing a new web application 
that will be processing highly sensitive user data. They want to 
ensure that if the web server is compromised, attackers cannot 
directly access the database or other critical infrastructure. 
Which of the following is the BEST strategy to achieve this 
objective? 
(A)       Use strong authentication methods for the web 
application 
(B)       Encrypt the user data at rest and in transit 
(C)       Place the web server and the database server in 
separate network segments 
(D)       Implement real-time monitoring of the web server 
Explanation 170. Correct Answer: C. Place the web server 
and the database server in separate network segments. By 
placing the web server and the database server in separate 
network segments, the company can achieve isolation. This 
means that even if the web server is compromised, attackers 
would still have to breach additional security measures to access 
the database server or other critical parts of the infrastructure. 
Option A is incorrect. While using strong authentication 
methods is important, it doesn’t provide isolation between the 
web server and other critical components. 
	
 
268

Option B is incorrect. Encrypting user data is essential for data 
protection, but it doesn’t provide network-based isolation 
between the web server and other systems. 
Option D is incorrect. Real-time monitoring can provide alerts 
on suspicious activities, but it doesn’t provide the desired 
isolation. 
Question 171. An IT technician is performing a routine security 
audit of a company’s server room. She discovers a server with 
outdated firmware that hasn’t been updated for two years. What 
potential vulnerability does the outdated firmware expose the 
server to? 
(A)       SQL Injection 
(B)       Physical tampering 
(C)       Unpatched exploits 
(D)       Credential stuffing 
Explanation 171. Correct Answer: C. Unpatched exploits. 
Firmware, like software, receives updates to fix known 
vulnerabilities. If firmware is outdated, it can leave systems 
susceptible to known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. 
Firmware serves as the foundational software for hardware 
devices. When firmware is not updated regularly, it may contain 
vulnerabilities that were patched in later versions. These 
vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited by attackers, putting 
the device and connected systems at risk. 
Option A is incorrect. SQL Injection is a vulnerability 
associated with databases and web applications, not firmware. 
	
 
269

Option B is incorrect. Physical tampering pertains to someone 
physically accessing and altering a device. While firmware 
vulnerabilities can sometimes lead to physical tampering 
(through boot-level attacks), the direct link between outdated 
firmware and physical tampering is not as strong as the link to 
unpatched exploits. 
Option D is incorrect. Credential stuffing is an attack method 
that involves using known username-password pairs to gain 
unauthorized access. It isn’t directly related to firmware 
vulnerabilities. 
Question 172. The IT department of a large organization 
receives reports from employees that they are unable to access 
certain resources on the network. Upon investigation, the IT 
department discovers that the Access Control List (ACL) 
settings have been recently modified. Which of the following 
would be the PRIMARY reason to review and modify the ACL 
settings? 
(A)       To balance the network load 
(B)       To update the organization's firewall rules. 
(C)       To ensure appropriate access rights to resources 
(D)       To update the organization's password policy 
Explanation 172. Correct Answer: C. To ensure appropriate 
access rights to resources. ACLs are essential tools in 
determining who has access to which resources within a 
network or system. Regularly reviewing and modifying the 
ACL settings ensures that users have the appropriate access 
rights, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring that 
authorized users can access the resources they need. 
	
 
270

Option A is incorrect. While network load balancing is crucial, 
it is not directly related to ACLs. ACLs focus on access control, 
not traffic distribution. 
Option B is incorrect. Firewall rules are different from ACLs. 
While they can work together, firewall rules primarily focus on 
allowing or blocking network traffic, while ACLs determine 
access permissions to resources. 
Option D is incorrect. While updating the organization’s 
password policy is a vital security measure, it is not related to 
ACLs, which control access to resources based on user or group 
permissions. 
Question 173. You are a security consultant for a company that 
uses a cloud-based infrastructure. During a security review, you 
discover that there are no boundaries defined between the 
company’s development, testing, and production environments 
in the cloud. This can lead to unintended interactions and data 
leaks. What kind of vulnerability is this scenario illustrating? 
(A)       Insecure API endpoints 
(B)       Weak encryption methods 
(C)       Lack of resource isolation 
(D)       Insufficient backup strategies 
Explanation 173. Correct Answer: C. Lack of resource 
isolation. Cloud-specific vulnerabilities can arise due to the 
shared nature of the cloud infrastructure. In this scenario, not 
having boundaries or isolation between different environments 
like development, testing, and production can lead to 
vulnerabilities. If there is no proper resource isolation, 
	
 
271

malicious code introduced in the development environment 
could make its way to production or confidential production 
data might be exposed in testing, leading to potential data 
breaches. 
Option A is incorrect. Insecure API endpoints would pertain to 
vulnerabilities where APIs used to manage and interact with 
cloud services are not properly secured. 
Option B is incorrect. Weak encryption methods refer to the 
use of outdated or vulnerable encryption algorithms, which 
would not directly relate to the mixing of environments. 
Option D is incorrect. Insufficient backup strategies would 
relate to not having adequate data backup and recovery 
mechanisms, which is a different concern from resource 
isolation. 
Question 174. During a routine security audit, a company 
discovered an unauthorized wireless access point using the 
same SSID as the company’s official wireless network. 
Additionally, this rogue access point was configured without 
any encryption. What type of wireless attack is this scenario 
most indicative of? 
(A)       War Driving 
(B)       Wireless Phishing 
(C)       Bluejacking 
(D)       Evil Twin 
Explanation 174. Correct Answer: D. Evil Twin. An “Evil 
Twin” attack involves setting up a rogue wireless access point 
	
 
272

that mimics a legitimate access point. By doing so, an attacker 
can intercept, monitor, and manipulate the traffic of users who 
mistakenly connect to the rogue access point. 
Option A is incorrect. War Driving involves driving around 
areas to discover wireless networks and possibly exploit them. 
It doesn’t necessarily involve creating rogue access points. 
Option B is incorrect. Wireless Phishing is not a standard term 
in wireless network security. Phishing generally involves 
tricking users into revealing sensitive information through 
deceptive websites or emails. 
Option C is incorrect. Bluejacking involves sending 
unsolicited messages to Bluetooth-enabled devices. It’s not 
related to wireless networks (Wi-Fi). 
Question 175. A system administrator notices that an 
unauthorized user was able to obtain elevated privileges on a 
server, even though the default account settings were configured 
correctly. Upon investigation, it was found that the server’s 
operating system had not been updated for several months. 
What type of vulnerability was likely exploited? 
(A)       Application Misconfiguration 
(B)       OS Patch Management Issue 
(C)       Weak Encryption Algorithm 
(D)       Password Reuse Attack 
Explanation 175. Correct Answer: B. OS Patch 
Management Issue. When operating systems are not regularly 
updated, they become vulnerable to known exploits that have 
	
 
273

since been patched by vendors. An attacker can take advantage 
of these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized elevated privileges. 
Operating system-based vulnerabilities often arise due to missed 
patches or updates. Keeping the OS updated is crucial because 
vendors frequently release patches to address known 
vulnerabilities. In this case, the lapse in updating the operating 
system opened a window for attackers to exploit and obtain 
elevated privileges. 
Option A is incorrect. Application Misconfiguration pertains to 
incorrect settings or configurations in software applications, not 
operating systems. The scenario does not suggest any issues 
with application settings. 
Option C is incorrect. Weak Encryption Algorithm refers to 
encryption that can be easily decrypted or broken due to flaws 
in the algorithm itself. The scenario doesn’t mention encryption 
or decryption problems. 
Option D is incorrect. Password Reuse Attack involves an 
attacker using previously breached passwords to access 
different accounts. The scenario doesn’t indicate password-
related issues. 
Question 176. A security analyst discovers that an external IP 
address has been repeatedly trying every possible combination 
of characters to gain access to the company’s VPN portal for the 
past two days. Which type of password attack is this MOST 
likely describing? 
(A)       Password Spraying 
	
 
274

(B)       Dictionary Attack 
(C)       Rainbow Table Attack 
(D)       Brute Force Attack 
Explanation 176. Correct Answer: D. Brute Force Attack. A 
Brute Force Attack involves systematically trying every 
possible combination of characters until the correct one is 
found. The scenario specifies that every possible combination of 
characters is being tried on the VPN portal, indicating a brute 
force attack. 
Option A is incorrect. Password Spraying involves trying a 
few commonly used passwords across multiple accounts, rather 
than all possible combinations on one account. 
Option B is incorrect. A Dictionary Attack uses a list of 
common or previously used passwords to attempt access. It 
doesn’t involve trying every possible combination. 
Option C is incorrect. A Rainbow Table Attack uses 
precomputed tables for reversing cryptographic hash functions. 
This scenario doesn’t mention hash values or the use of such 
tables. 
Question 177. Jane, an employee at XYZ Corp, recently 
noticed that her browser homepage changed unexpectedly, and 
she’s receiving an increasing number of targeted 
advertisements. Additionally, there’s a new toolbar in her 
browser that she doesn’t remember installing. Based on these 
symptoms, which type of malware is most likely affecting 
Jane’s computer? 
	
 
275

(A)       Ransomware 
(B)       Worm 
(C)       Spyware 
(D)       Botnet 
Explanation 177. Correct Answer: C. Spyware. Spyware is a 
type of malware that covertly collects information from a user’s 
system. Changes to browser settings, such as a new homepage 
or a new toolbar, combined with targeted advertisements, are 
common indicators that spyware might be present on a system. 
Option A is incorrect. Ransomware is malware that encrypts a 
user’s files and demands payment for their release. The 
described symptoms do not align with ransomware behavior. 
Option B is incorrect. Worms are a type of malware that self-
replicate and spread across networks. They typically don’t 
modify browser settings or show targeted advertisements. 
Option D is incorrect. A botnet involves a collection of 
internet-connected devices, which may have been infected with 
malware, being used to perform coordinated tasks. It doesn’t 
directly result in the browser-based symptoms described. 
Question 178. A software developer at XYZ Corp included a 
piece of code in the company’s software that would corrupt the 
application’s databases if his name was ever removed from the 
list of contributors in the application credits. Months after he 
left the company, the application databases were corrupted after 
an update. What type of malware was responsible for this 
action? 
	
 
276

(A)       Trojan 
(B)       Spyware 
(C)       Adware 
(D)      Logic bomb 
Explanation 178. Correct Answer: D. Logic bomb. A logic 
bomb is a type of malware that is triggered by a specific event 
or condition. In this case, the software developer’s name being 
removed from the contributors triggered the malicious code. 
Option A is incorrect. A Trojan disguises itself as legitimate 
software but performs malicious activities once installed. The 
scenario does not describe behavior characteristic of a Trojan. 
Option B is incorrect. Spyware is designed to collect and send 
information, typically without the user’s knowledge. It does not 
corrupt databases based on specific triggers. 
Option C is incorrect. Adware delivers unwanted 
advertisements to the user. It does not take malicious actions 
based on specific events. 
Question 179. A popular online shopping platform noticed that 
some product reviews contained a strange link which, when 
clicked, led users to a site that resembled the platform but 
harvested login credentials. What vulnerability in the review 
system might have allowed attackers to post such links? 
(A)       Session Hijacking 
(B)       Cross-site scripting (XSS) 
(C)       Password Spraying 
(D)       Credential Stuffing 
	
 
277

Explanation 179. Correct Answer: B. Cross-site scripting 
(XSS). XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious 
scripts into web content. If the platform’s review system does 
not properly sanitize input, it could permit attackers to embed 
malicious links that lead to phishing sites. 
Cross-site scripting attacks exploit vulnerabilities in web 
applications to insert malicious scripts. In this case, the ability 
to post malicious links within product reviews is an indication 
of an XSS vulnerability. When unsuspecting users click on these 
links, they are redirected to phishing sites designed to steal their 
credentials. 
Option A is incorrect. Session Hijacking involves taking over 
an active user session. It doesn’t involve posting malicious links 
in website content. 
Option C is incorrect. Password Spraying involves attempting 
to authenticate against many user accounts with a few 
commonly used passwords. It doesn’t involve embedding 
malicious links in website content. 
Option D is incorrect. Credential Stuffing attacks involve 
automated attempts to gain access using large sets of valid 
usernames and passwords. It isn’t related to the insertion of 
malicious links in web content. 
Question 180. During a routine security review, a security 
analyst discovers multiple failed login attempts to a secure 
server room’s electronic access control system, all within a 
short time span. The access logs show a sequential pattern of 
	
 
278

access codes being tried. What type of physical attack is likely 
being attempted? 
(A)       Tailgating 
(B)       Phishing 
(C)       Brute force 
(D)       Social engineering 
Explanation 180. Correct Answer: C. Brute force. A brute 
force attack involves trying every possible combination in an 
attempt to find the correct one. The sequential pattern of access 
codes being tried in the logs suggests that the attacker is 
systematically going through all potential combinations. 
Option A is incorrect. Tailgating involves an attacker 
following an authorized person into a secure area without the 
proper credentials. It doesn’t involve multiple electronic access 
code attempts. 
Option B is incorrect. Phishing is a type of social engineering 
attack that typically involves tricking someone into divulging 
their credentials or other sensitive information. It doesn’t 
involve direct physical access attempts. 
Option D is incorrect. While social engineering does involve 
manipulating individuals to gain unauthorized access, it is not 
specific to a brute force attack on an electronic system. 
Question 181. A multinational corporation communicates 
sensitive information between its branches using encryption. An 
internal audit reveals that the encryption algorithms being used 
are those that were deprecated several years ago. Which of the 
	
 
279

following cryptographic vulnerabilities is the organization most 
exposed to? 
(A)       Key generation flaw 
(B)       Weak algorithms susceptible to attacks 
(C)       Inadequate public key infrastructure 
(D)       Mismanagement of cryptographic keys 
Explanation 181. Correct Answer: B. Weak algorithms 
susceptible to attacks. When an organization is found to be 
using deprecated or older encryption algorithms, it means they 
are relying on cryptographic methods that might have known 
vulnerabilities or could be easier to break due to advancements 
in computing and cryptanalysis. Over time, certain algorithms 
are found to have weaknesses and are replaced with more robust 
ones. 
Option A is incorrect. The scenario does not specify issues 
with key generation but rather focuses on the use of outdated 
encryption algorithms. 
Option C is incorrect. There’s no information in the scenario 
suggesting problems with the organization’s public key 
infrastructure. 
Option D is incorrect. While key management is crucial, the 
primary issue presented in the scenario revolves around the 
usage of weak or outdated algorithms. 
Question 182. During a routine audit of the corporate servers, 
the system administrator discovers that a week’s worth of 
security logs are missing from one of the key application 
	
 
280

servers. Which of the following is the MOST likely reason for 
this occurrence? 
(A)       The logging service experienced a malfunction 
(B)       There was insufficient storage space for the logs 
(C)       A malware attack aimed to erase traces of intrusion 
(D)       The time zone setting was incorrectly configured 
Explanation 182. Correct Answer: C. A malware attack 
aimed to erase traces of intrusion. One of the primary tactics 
attackers use after gaining unauthorized access is to cover their 
tracks. Deleting or altering logs is a common method used to 
avoid detection and prevent any trace of malicious activity. 
Option A is incorrect. While it’s possible for the logging 
service to malfunction, it’s less likely for it to result in a specific 
week’s worth of logs being missing, without affecting other 
time periods. 
Option B is incorrect. Insufficient storage space can cause 
newer logs to overwrite older ones, but it would typically not 
result in a discrete chunk of logs, such as an entire week, to be 
missing. 
Option D is incorrect. A misconfigured time zone setting 
might cause timestamp discrepancies in logs, but it wouldn’t 
cause logs to be missing. 
Question 183. The content filtering logs at a retail company 
display multiple instances of blocked access to a file download 
URL ending with “.exe”. The source IP address belongs to a 
point of sale (POS) terminal. What should be the primary 
	
 
281

concern for the security team? 
(A)       The POS terminal might have outdated software 
(B)       There's a possible misconfiguration in the content 
filtering rules 
(C)       The POS terminal might be compromised and trying 
to download malicious executables 
(D)       The company's internet speed is too slow 
Explanation 183. Correct Answer: C. The POS terminal 
might be compromised and trying to download malicious 
executables. POS terminals shouldn’t be downloading 
executable files from the internet, especially without 
administrative oversight. Multiple attempts to download “.exe” 
files could indicate that the POS terminal is compromised and 
that malicious software is attempting to download further 
payloads. 
Option A is incorrect. While outdated software is a security 
concern, it wouldn’t manifest as multiple blocked attempts to 
download executables. 
Option B is incorrect. Misconfigurations in content filtering 
rules might block legitimate content, but the specific action of a 
POS terminal trying to download executable files is suspicious 
regardless of content filtering rules. 
Option D is incorrect. The company’s internet speed has no 
relevance to the specific content being blocked by the filtering 
system 
	
 
282

Question 184. Kara, a financial analyst, began to notice unusual 
account activity tied to her credentials. She is sure she hasn’t 
initiated these transactions. Upon further investigation, IT 
discovered a program on her computer that was recording her 
keystrokes. What type of malware was found on Kara’s 
computer? 
(A)       Ransomware 
(B)       Keylogger 
(C)       Adware 
(D)       Rootkit 
Explanation 184. Correct Answer: B. Keylogger. A keylogger 
is a type of malicious software designed to capture and record 
the keystrokes of a user without their knowledge, often leading 
to unauthorized access to sensitive information such as 
usernames, passwords, and other confidential details. 
Option A is incorrect. Ransomware is malware that encrypts a 
user’s data and demands payment for its decryption. It doesn’t 
record keystrokes. 
Option C is incorrect. Adware delivers unwanted ads to the 
user. It doesn’t record keystrokes. 
Option D is incorrect. A rootkit provides stealthy access to a 
computer, allowing an attacker to maintain privileged access 
without detection. It doesn’t specifically record keystrokes. 
Question 185. A finance department employee, Maya, is 
transferred to the HR department. The IT department is 
considering her access requirements. Which of the following 
	
 
283

actions aligns best with the principle of least privilege? 
(A)       Retain Maya's access to the finance system and grant 
additional access to the HR system 
(B)       Remove all previous access rights and provide her 
access solely to the HR system 
(C)       Grant Maya administrative rights to ease her transition 
between departments 
(D)       Limit Maya's access to read-only for both finance and 
HR systems for a transitional period 
Explanation 185. Correct Answer: B. Remove all previous 
access rights and provide her access solely to the HR system. 
When an employee transitions from one department to another, 
their access requirements change. To uphold the principle of 
least privilege, it’s essential to re-evaluate and adjust access 
rights. Maya no longer requires access to the finance system and 
should only have access to the resources necessary for her new 
role in HR. 
Option A is incorrect. Retaining access to the finance system 
when Maya no longer works in that department is unnecessary 
and could be a security risk. 
Option C is incorrect. Granting administrative rights is 
excessive and would provide Maya with more access than 
necessary for her new role. 
Option D is incorrect. While read-only access limits potential 
damage, providing access to both systems is unnecessary if 
Maya’s new role only requires access to the HR system.

Question 186. During a security audit, a company realized that 
a malicious actor was able to situate themselves on the network 
path, capturing TLS handshake messages between clients and 
the server. The attacker’s goal is to weaken the encryption by 
influencing the cipher suite negotiation process. What type of 
network attack does this scenario depict? 
(A)       ARP Poisoning 
(B)       Downgrade Attack 
(C)       SYN Flood 
(D)       Ping of Death 
Explanation 186. Correct Answer: B. Downgrade Attack. A 
Downgrade Attack occurs when an attacker interferes with the 
setup process (e.g., TLS handshake) to force two entities to 
settle on a less secure communication mode or encryption 
standard. In this case, by capturing and potentially altering the 
TLS handshake messages, the attacker is trying to make the 
client and server use a weaker cipher suite. 
Option A is incorrect. ARP Poisoning is a type of attack where 
an attacker sends falsified ARP messages over a local area 
network to link the attacker’s MAC address with the IP address 
of another node (such as the default gateway). This is a way to 
facilitate on-path attacks, but the scenario describes influencing 
the cipher suite negotiation, which is a Downgrade Attack. 
Option C is incorrect. SYN Flood is a form of denial-of-
service attack in which an attacker sends a sequence of SYN 
requests to a target’s system in an attempt to consume server 
resources. It does not relate to capturing TLS handshake 
messages. 
	
 
285

Option D is incorrect. Ping of Death is an old attack where 
malicious parties send malformed or oversized ping packets to 
crash the target system. It doesn’t involve capturing or 
influencing the TLS handshake process. 
Question 187. A developer has implemented a new feature on a 
company’s website that allows users to search for products by 
their names. Within a few days, the IT team noticed abnormal 
activities where entire tables from the database were being 
dumped. Which vulnerability might the new feature have 
introduced? 
(A)       Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
(B)       Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) 
(C)       Structured Query Language injection (SQLi) 
(D)       Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
Explanation 187. Correct Answer: C. Structured Query 
Language injection (SQLi). SQLi attacks occur when an 
attacker can insert or “inject” SQL code into a query. If user 
input is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL 
statements, attackers can exploit this to manipulate the queries, 
which can lead to unauthorized viewing of data, corrupting or 
deleting data, and other malicious activities. 
Structured Query Language injection, or SQLi, is a code 
injection technique that attackers use to run malicious SQL 
statements on a database. Given that entire tables from the 
database were dumped after implementing a search feature, it’s 
a clear indication that the feature did not properly sanitize user 
input, allowing for SQLi. 
	
 
286

Option A is incorrect. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks inject 
malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users. It doesn’t 
lead to dumping of database tables as described in the scenario. 
Option B is incorrect. Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) 
attacks overwhelm a target with traffic, causing service 
interruptions. It’s not related to the extraction of database 
information. 
Option D is incorrect. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
tricks victims into submitting malicious requests. It doesn’t 
result in the dumping of database tables. 
Question 188. During a routine security assessment, Jake, a 
penetration tester, discovers that by modifying a configuration 
file located in a public directory, he can assign himself 
administrative privileges in the application. What type of 
vulnerability is Jake exploiting? 
(A)       Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
(B)       Privilege Escalation 
(C)       SQL Injection 
(D)       Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) 
Explanation 188. Correct Answer: B. Privilege Escalation. 
Privilege escalation occurs when a user increases their 
privileges beyond what was originally granted to them, allowing 
them to perform actions that they should not be allowed to. In 
this scenario, Jake is elevating his privileges in the application 
by modifying a configuration file, indicating a privilege 
escalation vulnerability. 
	
 
287

Option A is incorrect. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) involves an 
attacker injecting malicious scripts into web content viewed by 
other users. This scenario does not relate to injecting scripts. 
Option C is incorrect. SQL Injection vulnerabilities allow 
attackers to manipulate or query a database directly through 
input fields. The scenario does not indicate any interaction with 
a database. 
Option D is incorrect. Insecure Direct Object Reference 
(IDOR) vulnerabilities occur when an application allows access 
to objects based on user-supplied input. While the scenario 
involves accessing a file, it is the act of elevating privileges that 
is the primary concern. 
Question 189. An organization’s security team discovered that 
an attacker had gained unauthorized access to a server. Upon 
investigating, they found a software tool that allowed the 
attacker to mask processes, files, and system data, effectively 
remaining hidden while maintaining privileged access. What 
type of malware was implanted by the attacker? 
(A)       Trojan 
(B)       Worm 
(C)       Logic Bomb 
(D)       Rootkit 
Explanation 189. Correct Answer: D. Rootkit. A rootkit is 
malware that provides stealthy access to a computer and hides 
its presence from standard detection methods. It can mask files, 
processes, and other system data. 
	
 
288

Option A is incorrect. A Trojan disguises itself as legitimate 
software but performs malicious activities once installed. It does 
not inherently hide processes or files. 
Option B is incorrect. Worms are malware that can replicate 
themselves to spread to other systems. They don’t typically hide 
their activities at the system level. 
Option C is incorrect. A logic bomb is set to execute its 
malicious activity when a specific event or condition occurs. It 
doesn’t focus on hiding system data or processes. 
Question 190. The IT team of XYZ Corp received an alert that 
an employee’s account was used to access the company’s portal 
from Paris at 2:00 PM and then from Tokyo at 2:30 PM. The 
employee is currently on a business trip to Paris. What could 
this alert be indicating? 
(A)      The employee quickly traveled from Paris to Tokyo 
(B)       The company's time zone settings are misconfigured 
(C)       There's a possible VPN misconfiguration on the 
employee's computer 
(D)       The employee's account might have been 
compromised 
Explanation 190. Correct Answer: D. The employee’s 
account might have been compromised. Impossible travel, in 
this context, refers to the improbable nature of someone being 
in two distant geographical locations within a short time frame. 
Given the close time proximity of both access attempts, it’s 
highly improbable that the employee traveled from Paris to 
	
 
289

Tokyo in half an hour. This is a common indicator of account 
compromise. 
Option A is incorrect. It’s virtually impossible for someone to 
travel from Paris to Tokyo in just 30 minutes. 
Option B is incorrect. Time zone misconfigurations might 
cause timestamp discrepancies, but they wouldn’t cause the 
appearance of logins from two distant cities within such a short 
time frame. 
Option C is incorrect. Even if there’s a VPN misconfiguration, 
it would not explain the access from two very different 
geographical locations in such a short span of time. 
Question 191. An organization recently deployed a cloud-based 
database to support its new application. A few weeks later, 
unauthorized access to the database was detected. An 
investigation revealed that the database was accessible without 
a password. Which of the following misconfigurations is 
primarily responsible for the security breach? 
(A)       Default configurations left unchanged 
(B)       Insufficient network segmentation 
(C)       Encryption not enabled at rest 
(D)       Lack of intrusion detection system 
Explanation 191. Correct Answer: A. Default configurations 
left unchanged. The scenario describes a situation where a 
cloud-based database was accessible without a password. This 
is a common oversight when default configurations, which may 
	
 
290

have no password or a widely known default password, are left 
unchanged upon deployment. 
Option B is incorrect. While network segmentation is crucial 
for security, the primary issue in this scenario is the database’s 
lack of password protection, not its network placement. 
Option C is incorrect. Though encryption at rest is a best 
practice for data protection, the immediate issue here is 
unauthorized access due to a lack of password, not data 
exposure from the database’s stored data. 
Option D is incorrect. An intrusion detection system (IDS) 
might have detected the unauthorized access sooner, but the 
core vulnerability was the unchanged default configurations. 
Question 192. A user reports that whenever they try to visit 
their online banking website, they are redirected to a website 
that looks identical but has a slightly different URL. The fake 
website asks for additional personal details that the bank never 
requested before. Which type of DNS attack is the user likely 
encountering? 
(A)       DNS Tunneling 
(B)       DNS Fast Flux 
(C)       DNS Cache Poisoning 
(D)       Domain Hijacking 
Explanation 192. Correct Answer: C. DNS Cache Poisoning. 
DNS Cache Poisoning, also known as DNS spoofing, involves 
corrupting the DNS cache data in DNS resolvers to redirect 
	
 
291

users to malicious websites instead of the actual intended 
websites. 
Option A is incorrect. DNS Tunneling is a technique where 
non-DNS traffic is encapsulated in DNS protocols. It’s a way to 
bypass network security but doesn’t usually lead to the 
described redirection scenario. 
Option B is incorrect. DNS Fast Flux involves rapidly 
changing the IP address associated with a domain name to hide 
the malicious server behind it. It is used to prevent the 
malicious domain from being taken down but doesn’t cause 
redirection to a similar-looking site. 
Option D is incorrect. Domain Hijacking involves an attacker 
taking control of a domain by altering its registration data 
without the owner’s permission. While this could lead to a 
similar outcome, the scenario describes a situation where only 
certain users are redirected, not all visitors to the domain. 
Question 193. Alex recently purchased a new laptop. Upon first 
startup, he noticed multiple pre-installed software applications, 
most of which he didn’t recognize or find necessary. The 
laptop’s performance was slower than expected given its 
hardware specifications. Which type of software is most likely 
causing this performance degradation? 
(A)       Ransomware 
(B)       Bloatware 
(C)       Spyware 
(D)       Adware 
	
 
292

Explanation 193. Correct Answer: B. Bloatware. Bloatware 
refers to unnecessary software applications that come pre-
installed on new computers. These applications often consume 
system resources, leading to reduced performance. 
Manufacturers sometimes pre-install these applications for 
promotional purposes or due to partnerships with software 
providers. 
Option A is incorrect. Ransomware encrypts a user’s files and 
demands payment for their decryption. It doesn’t come pre-
installed on new computers. 
Option C is incorrect. Spyware covertly collects information 
from a system without the user’s knowledge. It doesn’t typically 
come pre-installed on new devices as bloatware does. 
Option D is incorrect. Adware automatically displays or 
downloads advertising material on a computer. While it might 
be annoying, it’s not typically pre-installed software that comes 
with new computers aimed at degrading performance. 
Question 194. The IT department of a large corporation is 
performing a vulnerability assessment on its virtualized 
infrastructure. They come across a potential threat where a user 
from within a VM can interact and possibly compromise the 
host system. What is this type of vulnerability commonly 
referred to as? 
(A)       VM cloning 
(B)       VM snapshotting 
(C)       VM escape 
(D)       VM migration 
	
 
293

Explanation 194. Correct Answer: C. VM escape. A VM 
escape occurs when an attacker runs code on a VM that allows 
them to break out of the VM’s isolated environment and gain 
access to the host system. 
A virtual machine (VM) escape refers to the exploitation of a 
vulnerability in the virtualization software, allowing an attacker 
who has control over a VM to break out of its isolated 
environment and gain access to the host system. This can lead to 
the potential compromise of other VMs running on the same 
host or the underlying infrastructure. 
Option A is incorrect. VM cloning is the process of creating an 
exact copy of a VM. It does not involve breaking out of the 
VM’s isolated environment. 
Option B is incorrect. VM snapshotting involves creating a 
point-in-time copy of a VM, which can be used for backup or 
recovery purposes. It is not related to escaping from a VM. 
Option D is incorrect. VM migration refers to the process of 
moving a VM from one host to another, often for load balancing 
or hardware maintenance. It does not involve escaping from the 
VM’s isolated environment. 
Question 195. A renowned technology company recently 
released a new line of routers. After a short period, security 
researchers discovered that some of these routers contain 
malicious chips embedded during the manufacturing process. 
This incident most likely represents a vulnerability related to 
which supply chain aspect? 
	
 
294

(A)       Outsourced software development risks 
(B)       Service provider's outdated security practices 
(C)       Hardware provider's embedded compromise 
(D)       Inadequate vendor background checks 
Explanation 195. Correct Answer: C. Hardware provider’s 
embedded compromise. Supply chain vulnerabilities in the 
context of hardware providers can involve the introduction of 
malicious components or chips during the manufacturing 
process. In this scenario, the presence of malicious chips in the 
routers is a direct reflection of a vulnerability due to a 
compromised hardware provider. 
Option A is incorrect. The scenario revolves around a 
hardware compromise, not software development outsourcing. 
Option B is incorrect. While it’s essential for service providers 
to employ up-to-date security practices, the vulnerability in this 
scenario is attributed to a hardware compromise and not 
outdated security practices. 
Option D is incorrect. Although vendor background checks are 
important, this scenario emphasizes a vulnerability stemming 
from the hardware manufacturing process, not the vetting 
process of vendors. 
Question 196. A large news website was rendered unavailable 
during a major news event. Network logs show an 
overwhelming amount of traffic from IoT devices. Which type 
of DDoS attack leveraged IoT devices is this indicative of? 
(A)       Reflected Attack 
	
 
295

(B)       Botnet Attack 
(C)       Amplification Attack 
(D)       Teardrop Attack 
Explanation 196. Correct Answer: B. Botnet Attack. Botnets, 
which are networks of compromised devices (including IoT 
devices), are often used to conduct large-scale DDoS attacks by 
directing the combined bandwidth of the devices towards a 
target. 
Option A is incorrect. In a reflected attack, an attacker sends 
traffic to a third party, disguising it as if it came from the victim, 
which then reflects the traffic to the victim. It doesn’t primarily 
involve IoT devices. 
Option C is incorrect. An amplification attack leverages 
vulnerable network services to amplify the amount of traffic 
sent to a victim. The primary focus isn’t the use of IoT devices. 
Option D is incorrect. A teardrop attack involves sending 
mangled IP fragments with overlapping and oversized payloads 
to crash a target system. It doesn’t specifically utilize IoT 
devices. 
Question 197. A web application requires users to authenticate 
using a token sent to their email. Alex, a security analyst, 
observes that once logged in, if he presents the same token 
again, he is granted access without any restrictions. What type 
of vulnerability does this situation depict? 
(A)       Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
(B)       Replay Attack 
	
 
296

(C)       Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack 
(D)       Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
Explanation 197. Correct Answer: B. Replay Attack. A 
replay attack, also known as playback attack, occurs when an 
attacker intercepts data and then retransmits it. In this scenario, 
Alex was able to reuse the authentication token to gain access, 
indicating that the system does not have mechanisms in place to 
prevent replayed tokens from being accepted multiple times. 
Option A is incorrect. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is 
an attack where an attacker tricks the victim into performing 
unwanted actions on a web application where they’re 
authenticated. It doesn’t involve reusing authentication tokens. 
Option C is incorrect. While a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) 
Attack can involve intercepting data between two parties, the 
described scenario doesn’t involve an attacker modifying or 
relaying the information in real-time. 
Option D is incorrect. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into 
web pages. The scenario doesn’t indicate any script injection. 
Question 198. Liam, a security analyst, is investigating a 
potential breach. He discovers that a malicious actor sent 
requests to the server by altering HTTP headers to impersonate 
another user, thereby gaining unauthorized access. Which type 
of application attack is this? 
(A)       Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
(B)       Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
	
 
297

(C)       HTTP Header Forgery 
(D)       Session Hijacking 
Explanation 198. Correct Answer: C. HTTP Header 
Forgery. HTTP Header Forgery involves manipulating HTTP 
headers in a request to impersonate, spoof, or deceive systems, 
often for bypassing security controls or impersonating other 
users. In the described scenario, the malicious actor altered 
HTTP headers to impersonate another user, indicating an HTTP 
Header Forgery attack. 
Option A is incorrect. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
involves tricking a user into executing actions on a web 
application where they’re authenticated, without their 
knowledge. While it involves forgery, it doesn’t involve directly 
manipulating HTTP headers as described. 
Option B is incorrect. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) involves 
injecting malicious scripts into web content viewed by other 
users. The scenario does not pertain to injecting scripts. 
Option D is incorrect. Session Hijacking involves taking over 
a user’s session to perform unauthorized actions. It doesn’t 
specifically involve the manipulation of HTTP headers. 
Question 199. A company’s network administrator notices that 
several switches in the network infrastructure are no longer 
receiving firmware updates from the manufacturer. These 
devices are no longer sold or supported. What vulnerability do 
these switches introduce to the network? 
(A)       Physical hardware tampering 
	
 
298

(B)       Lack of redundancy 
(C)       Increased susceptibility to new threats 
(D)       Wireless interference 
Explanation 199. Correct Answer: C. Increased 
susceptibility to new threats. End-of-life hardware often does 
not receive security updates or patches, making them more 
vulnerable to new and evolving threats over time.  
End-of-life (EOL) hardware refers to devices that are no longer 
supported by their manufacturers. This lack of support means 
that the devices won’t receive any further security updates, 
patches, or technical support. Consequently, these devices 
become more susceptible to new threats and vulnerabilities, 
posing a security risk to the network. 
Option A is incorrect. End-of-life status doesn’t inherently 
make a device more vulnerable to physical tampering. However, 
without ongoing updates, they might be susceptible to firmware 
or software-based attacks, which could lead to physical 
tampering in some scenarios. 
Option B is incorrect. Lack of redundancy refers to a single 
point of failure in a system or network. It is not directly related 
to the vulnerabilities associated with EOL hardware. 
Option D is incorrect. Wireless interference is related to the 
disruption of wireless signals and is not a direct consequence of 
EOL hardware. 
	
 
299

Question 200. While reviewing web server logs, Sarah, a 
security analyst, notices a pattern of requests containing “..
%2F..” in the URLs. She suspects this might be an attempt to 
exploit a vulnerability. Which type of application attack is likely 
being attempted? 
(A)       Command Injection 
(B)       Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
(C)       Directory Traversal 
(D)       Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
Explanation 200. Correct Answer: C. Directory Traversal. 
Directory traversal (also known as path traversal) involves 
manipulating variables referencing files with “..” sequences and 
its variations (like “..%2F..”, which URL-decodes to “../..”) to 
navigate outside of the intended directory. This can allow an 
attacker to access restricted files on the web server. The pattern 
Sarah observed in the logs indicates a directory traversal attack 
attempt. 
Option A is incorrect. Command injection attacks involve 
executing arbitrary commands on the server via application 
vulnerabilities. The specific pattern observed in the logs does 
not suggest command execution. 
Option B is incorrect. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks 
involve injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by 
other users. The pattern observed doesn’t pertain to script 
injection. 
Option D is incorrect. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
tricks victims into submitting a malicious request. It does not 
	
 
300

involve directory or path manipulation as described in the 
scenario. 
Question 201. A security analyst is reviewing network logs and 
notices that an attacker positioned in between the user and the 
target website is intercepting and potentially modifying the 
user’s communications before passing them on to the intended 
destination. This malicious activity occurs transparently, with 
neither the user nor the target website being aware. What type 
of network attack is being described? 
(A)       Replay Attack 
(B)       Smurf Attack 
(C)       On-path Attack 
(D)       Spoofing Attack 
Explanation 201. Correct Answer: C. On-path Attack. An 
On-path Attack, also known as a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) 
attack, involves an attacker intercepting communications 
between two parties, potentially modifying the communication, 
and then relaying it to the intended recipient. Both the source 
and the destination are unaware of the attacker’s presence. 
Option A is incorrect. A Replay Attack involves capturing 
legitimate data packets and retransmitting them at a later time to 
create an unauthorized effect. It doesn’t involve active 
interception and modification in real-time. 
Option B is incorrect. A Smurf Attack is a type of denial-of-
service attack that uses ICMP Echo (ping) traffic to flood a 
target system. It has no relation to intercepting and modifying 
user communications. 
	
 
301

Option D is incorrect. Spoofing Attack involves pretending to 
be something or someone else. While on-path attacks might 
involve some elements of spoofing, the specific action 
described in the scenario is more aligned with an on-path attack. 
Question 202. A financial firm outsources its payment 
processing to a third-party service provider. After a series of 
fraudulent transactions, it was discovered that the service 
provider was not employing the latest encryption standards 
when transmitting data. Which vulnerability related to supply 
chain does this scenario highlight? 
(A)       Inadequate vendor background checks 
(B)       Service provider's outdated security practices 
(C)       Deficient hardware components from a supplier 
(D)       Software with embedded backdoors 
Explanation 202. Correct Answer: B. Service provider’s 
outdated security practices. Supply chain vulnerabilities 
encompass risks originating from third-party vendors and 
service providers. In this scenario, the third-party service 
provider’s failure to use current encryption standards for 
transmitting data exemplifies a vulnerability that arises due to 
outdated security practices by the service provider. 
Option A is incorrect. While vendor background checks are 
essential, the scenario does not specifically point towards a 
problem with the vendor’s background. It focuses on their 
encryption practices. 
Option C is incorrect. The scenario doesn’t mention hardware 
components or any issues related to them. 
	
 
302

Option D is incorrect. The issue here pertains to encryption 
standards, not to software with embedded backdoors. 
Question 203. Julia, a cybersecurity analyst, notices a recently 
installed application named “PhotoEditorPro.exe” on a 
corporate workstation. Upon further inspection, she identifies 
that this application is silently exfiltrating sensitive company 
data to an external IP address. Which type of malware is Julia 
most likely observing? 
(A)       Worm 
(B)       Ransomware 
(C)       Trojan 
(D)       Adware 
Explanation 203. Correct Answer: C. Trojan. A Trojan is a 
type of malware that disguises itself as a legitimate software or 
application. Unlike viruses, Trojans don’t replicate themselves, 
but they can be just as destructive if not more so. In this case, 
the “PhotoEditorPro.exe” appears to be a legitimate photo 
editing application but is actually being used to transmit 
sensitive data to an external source. 
Option A is incorrect. Worms are malware programs that 
replicate themselves to spread to other devices. They don’t 
typically disguise themselves as legitimate applications. 
Option B is incorrect. Ransomware encrypts the victim’s data 
and demands a ransom to decrypt it. It doesn’t disguise itself as 
legitimate software. 
	
 
303

Option D is incorrect. Adware is software that displays 
unwanted advertisements. It doesn’t typically exfiltrate data or 
disguise itself as legitimate software. 
Question 204. A company’s IT department notices a sharp 
increase in account lockouts over the past two days, especially 
during non-business hours. While some accounts are from 
various departments, a majority are from the finance team. 
Which of the following is the MOST plausible explanation for 
these lockouts? 
(A)       Scheduled maintenance by the IT department 
(B)       Employees are sharing passwords within the finance 
team 
(C)       An attacker is trying to gain unauthorized access 
(D)       A recent password policy change requiring more 
frequent changes 
Explanation 204. Correct Answer: C. An attacker is trying 
to gain unauthorized access. A sudden increase in account 
lockouts, especially during non-business hours, indicates 
suspicious activity. The targeted nature of the lockouts, 
especially on sensitive departments like finance, suggests an 
attacker might be attempting unauthorized access. 
Option A is incorrect. Scheduled maintenance would typically 
be communicated in advance, and it’s unlikely to cause a sharp 
increase in account lockouts. 
Option B is incorrect. While employees sharing passwords is a 
security concern, it would not typically result in a surge of 
account lockouts, especially during non-business hours. 
	
 
304

Option D is incorrect. A password policy change might result 
in some increased lockouts, but the targeted nature of the 
lockouts (majority from finance) and their occurrence during 
non-business hours make this option less likely. 
Question 205. Sarah, a software developer at a tech company, 
decided to gain root access to her company-issued mobile 
device to customize its features. Soon after, the IT department 
detected unauthorized data transmissions from her device. 
Which mobile vulnerability is most likely associated with her 
actions? 
(A)       Side loading of applications 
(B)       Inconsistent OS updates 
(C)       Mobile device jailbreaking 
(D)       Use of open Wi-Fi networks 
Explanation 205. Correct Answer: C. Mobile device 
jailbreaking. Jailbreaking is the process of removing the 
restrictions imposed by the manufacturer on certain devices, 
thereby allowing root access. With this root access, users can 
install and customize software that hasn’t been approved by the 
device’s manufacturer or carrier. However, jailbreaking can 
expose the device to various security vulnerabilities, as 
indicated by unauthorized data transmissions. 
Option A is incorrect. Side loading refers to the installation of 
applications from sources other than the official app store. 
While side loading can pose security risks, Sarah’s actions 
specifically relate to gaining root access, which points to 
jailbreaking. 
	
 
305

Option B is incorrect. Inconsistent OS updates refer to the 
presence of various versions of an OS across different devices. 
Sarah’s actions are related to obtaining root access, not 
inconsistent updates. 
Option D is incorrect. Using open Wi-Fi networks can expose 
mobile devices to threats, but Sarah’s vulnerability arose from 
gaining root access, not from her choice of Wi-Fi networks. 
Question 206. After a recent cyber attack on a corporation’s 
central database, the IT department has been tasked with 
enhancing the security of their network infrastructure. Which of 
the following would be the BEST technique to ensure that 
different departments, like HR and Finance, cannot access each 
other’s sensitive data? 
(A)       Implement network segmentation based on 
departments 
(B)       Upgrade the bandwidth of the entire network 
(C)       Use a single strong password for all departments 
(D)       Move all department data to the cloud 
Explanation 206. Correct Answer: A. Implement network 
segmentation based on departments. Network segmentation 
divides a network into multiple segments or subnets, each 
acting as its own small network. This limits access between 
segments and can protect sensitive data by ensuring that only 
those within a segment can access its resources. 
Option B is incorrect. While upgrading the bandwidth may 
improve network speeds, it does not address the security 
concern of segregating departmental data. 
	
 
306

Option C is incorrect. Using a single strong password for all 
departments does not prevent one department from accessing 
another’s data. It also introduces a single point of failure. 
Option D is incorrect. Moving data to the cloud can offer some 
security benefits, but without proper access controls and 
segmentation, different departments could still access each 
other’s data. 
Question 207. During an organization’s security review, the 
cybersecurity analyst noticed that there were multiple failed 
login attempts for different user accounts, each with a few 
commonly used passwords. What type of password attack does 
this scenario BEST describe? 
(A)       Brute Force Attack 
(B)       Dictionary Attack 
(C)       Credential Stuffing 
(D)       Password Spraying 
Explanation 207. Correct Answer: D. Password Spraying. 
Password Spraying is an attack method where the attacker tries 
a few commonly used passwords against multiple user accounts, 
rather than trying many passwords against a single account. The 
scenario described shows multiple user accounts with common 
passwords being targeted, aligning with this method. 
Option A is incorrect. A Brute Force Attack involves trying all 
possible password combinations for a particular account. The 
scenario describes trying common passwords on multiple 
accounts, not exhaustive combinations on one. 
	
 
307

Option B is incorrect. A Dictionary Attack involves trying a 
list of probable passwords, often extracted from dictionaries or 
common password lists, against a single account. The scenario 
emphasizes multiple accounts. 
Option C is incorrect. Credential Stuffing involves using 
previously leaked username and password pairs to gain 
unauthorized access. The emphasis is on using known 
credentials, not common passwords. 
Question 208. The IT team at TechnoCorp has noticed a 
consistent pattern over the last week where a particular server’s 
CPU usage spikes to 100% between 2:00 AM and 4:00 AM, a 
time when there’s typically minimal user activity. What could 
be the MOST probable reason for this? 
(A)       The server is automatically updating its software 
(B)       An employee is running a heavy computational task 
(C)       The server is undergoing a DDoS attack 
(D)       Malware is performing cryptomining activities 
Explanation 208. Correct Answer: D. Malware is 
performing cryptomining activities. Cryptomining malware 
often causes significant resource consumption, especially CPU 
usage. Attackers frequently schedule such activities during off-
peak hours to reduce the chance of detection. Given the 
consistent pattern of high CPU usage during off-hours, 
cryptomining malware is a probable cause. 
	
 
308

Option A is incorrect. While software updates can cause 
resource consumption, they typically don’t result in consistent, 
prolonged 100% CPU usage over multiple days. 
Option B is incorrect. Though it’s possible an employee might 
be running a heavy task, the consistent pattern during odd hours 
makes it less likely compared to malicious activities. 
Option C is incorrect. While a DDoS attack can cause resource 
consumption, it wouldn’t specifically target CPU usage 
consistently during the same timeframe every night. 
Question 209. An organization’s IT department noticed a rapid 
increase in network traffic over the past 24 hours. 
Simultaneously, many employees reported that their systems 
have been slow and that they received a file named 
“updatePatch.exe” from coworkers via email, even though the 
coworkers did not intentionally send any files. What type of 
malware is most likely responsible for this behavior? 
(A)       Trojan 
(B)       Ransomware 
(C)       Adware 
(D)       Worm 
Explanation 209. Correct Answer: D. Worm. Worms are a 
type of malware that self-replicates and spreads to other 
devices. The rapid increase in network traffic and the 
distribution of a file to various users without the sender’s 
knowledge is characteristic of worm behavior. They can 
consume bandwidth and system resources, causing systems to 
slow down. 
	
 
309

Option A is incorrect. A Trojan disguises itself as legitimate 
software but does not replicate itself or send itself via email like 
worms do. 
Option B is incorrect. Ransomware encrypts files on a victim’s 
computer and demands a ransom for the decryption key. It 
doesn’t self-replicate and spread like a worm. 
Option C is incorrect. Adware primarily serves unwanted ads 
to users and doesn’t replicate itself to spread to other systems. 
Question 210. During a routine check, an IT technician notices 
several files on a company server have been renamed with a 
“.locked” extension and there’s a new file named 
“README_TO_RECOVER_FILES.txt” present in the root 
directory. Based on these indicators, which type of malicious 
activity is most likely in progress? 
(A)       Worm propagation 
(B)       Trojan horse execution 
(C)       Ransomware attack 
(D)       Logic bomb activation 
Explanation 210. Correct Answer: C. Ransomware attack. 
Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts a 
victim’s files, rendering them inaccessible. The attacker then 
demands a ransom from the victim in return for the decryption 
key. The renaming of files with a specific extension (like 
“.locked”) and the presence of a ransom note (like 
“README_TO_RECOVER_FILES.txt”) are typical indicators 
of a ransomware attack. 
	
 
310

Option A is incorrect. Worm propagation refers to the spread 
of a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself 
to spread to other computers. It doesn’t typically rename files or 
leave readable messages. 
Option B is incorrect. A Trojan horse is malicious software 
that deceives users about its true intent. While it can deliver a 
ransomware payload, the described indicators more directly 
suggest ransomware activity. 
Option D is incorrect. A logic bomb is a piece of code that 
executes a malicious function when certain conditions are met, 
but it doesn’t necessarily leave the described file traces. 
Question 211. An organization is choosing a hash function for 
digital signatures. They want to ensure that it is resistant to 
scenarios where an attacker might produce two different 
messages having the same hash. Which type of attack are they 
trying to defend against? 
(A)       Side-channel Attack 
(B)       Replay Attack 
(C)       Birthday Attack 
(D)       Ciphertext-only Attack 
Explanation 211. Correct Answer: C. Birthday Attack. In a 
Birthday Attack, attackers exploit the mathematics behind the 
birthday problem in probability theory, aiming to find two 
different inputs that produce the same output, or hash. When 
selecting a hash function for digital signatures, it’s crucial to 
pick one that is resistant to Birthday Attacks to maintain the 
integrity of the signatures. 
	
 
311

Option A is incorrect. A Side-channel Attack involves 
obtaining information from the physical implementation of a 
cryptographic system rather than exploiting a theoretical 
weakness in algorithms or protocols. It’s unrelated to producing 
two messages with the same hash. 
Option B is incorrect. A Replay Attack involves intercepting 
data (like a login session) and then resending or replaying it to 
gain unauthorized access. It does not focus on matching hash 
values. 
Option D is incorrect. In a Ciphertext-only Attack, the attacker 
has the ciphertext and tries to derive the plaintext without 
knowing the key. The scenario does not describe this type of 
attack. 
Question 212. An IT security team received reports that a new, 
previously unknown vulnerability was being actively exploited 
in the wild. The software vendor has not yet provided a patch 
for the vulnerability. What is the most accurate term for this 
vulnerability? 
(A)       Legacy vulnerability 
(B)       Zero-day vulnerability 
(C)       Patched vulnerability 
(D)       Known vulnerability 
Explanation 212. Correct Answer: B. Zero-day 
vulnerability. A zero-day vulnerability refers to a flaw in 
software, hardware, or firmware that is unknown to the vendor. 
This type of vulnerability is a risk because there is no fix or 
	
 
312

patch for it at the time of discovery, and it may already be 
actively exploited by malicious actors. 
Option A is incorrect. A legacy vulnerability typically refers to 
a vulnerability in older software or systems that might not be 
supported anymore, not necessarily an unknown and unpatched 
flaw. 
Option C is incorrect. A patched vulnerability implies that 
there’s already a fix available for the flaw. In the scenario 
provided, no patch has been released yet. 
Option D is incorrect. While the vulnerability may become 
known to some entities, such as the security team in this 
scenario, it remains unknown to the software vendor. Thus, 
“known vulnerability” is not the most accurate descriptor in this 
context. 
Question 213. A company has recently deployed a new e-
commerce application. The security team wants to ensure they 
can detect any unauthorized or malicious activities on the 
application. Which of the following would be the MOST 
effective way to achieve this goal? 
(A)       Conduct a penetration test on the application 
(B)       Install a firewall in front of the application 
(C)       Implement continuous monitoring of the 
application's logs and activities 
(D)       Provide training to users about secure browsing habits 
Explanation 213. Correct Answer: C. Implement continuous 
monitoring of the application’s logs and activities. 
	
 
313

Continuous monitoring of an application’s logs and activities 
allows the security team to detect and respond to any suspicious 
or unauthorized behavior in real-time. This ensures that 
potential threats can be identified and addressed promptly, 
enhancing the security posture of the application. 
Option A is incorrect. While a penetration test can identify 
vulnerabilities in an application, it does not offer continuous 
monitoring or detection capabilities for ongoing malicious 
activities. 
Option B is incorrect. While a firewall can provide a layer of 
security by filtering malicious traffic, it doesn’t offer the 
granular insights or real-time monitoring needed to detect all 
unauthorized activities within an application. 
Option D is incorrect. Training users about secure browsing 
habits is important but would not directly help in monitoring or 
detecting malicious activities on the e-commerce application. 
Question 214. Ella, a security analyst, is reviewing the logs of a 
web application and notices that an attacker attempted to use the 
following input in a login form: ' OR '1'='1' --. This input was 
used in an effort to manipulate the application’s backend 
database. What type of injection attack is this an example of? 
(A)       XML Injection 
(B)       Command Injection 
(C)       SQL Injection 
(D)       LDAP Injection 
	
 
314

Explanation 214. Correct Answer: C. SQL Injection. The 
input ' OR '1'='1' -- is a classic example of an SQL injection 
attack. Attackers use this technique to manipulate SQL queries 
in applications that do not properly validate user input, 
potentially allowing unauthorized access or data retrieval. 
Option A is incorrect. XML Injection targets applications that 
parse XML input. The payload mentioned in the scenario is not 
related to XML structures. 
Option B is incorrect. Command Injection is when an attacker 
attempts to execute arbitrary commands on a host operating 
system. The given input is not an OS command. 
Option D is incorrect. LDAP Injection targets applications that 
construct LDAP statements based on user input. The given 
payload is not structured for LDAP queries. 
Question 215. A medium-sized company has just deployed a 
new file server for the HR department. They want to ensure that 
only HR employees can view and edit HR-specific documents, 
while the IT department should only be able to perform system 
maintenance tasks. What should the company implement to 
achieve this requirement? 
(A)       Install a firewall between the HR and IT departments 
(B)       Implement an Access Control List (ACL) for the file 
server 
(C)       Enforce a strong password policy for the HR department 
(D)       Enable full disk encryption on the file server 
	
 
315

Explanation 215. Correct Answer: B. Implement an Access 
Control List (ACL) for the file server. Access Control Lists 
(ACLs) define who can access a resource and what they can do 
with it once accessed. By setting up an ACL for the file server, 
the company can precisely define the permissions for HR and IT 
departments, ensuring that only authorized users have the right 
level of access to the data. 
Option A is incorrect. Installing a firewall would limit network 
traffic between departments but would not provide granular 
access control to files on the server. 
Option C is incorrect. While a strong password policy is 
essential for security, it doesn’t differentiate access between HR 
and IT or control what users can do once they access the server. 
Option D is incorrect. Full disk encryption protects data at rest, 
but it does not provide differentiated access to specific files or 
directories based on user roles. 
Question 216. A e-commerce website suddenly experiences a 
sharp increase in traffic, causing the website to become slow 
and occasionally inaccessible. The IT team observes that a large 
number of requests are originating from multiple IP addresses 
spread across various countries. What type of network attack is 
the e-commerce website likely experiencing? 
(A)       Man-in-the-middle attack 
(B)       DNS spoofing 
(C)       Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack 
(D)       ARP poisoning 
	
 
316

Explanation 216. Correct Answer: C. Distributed denial-of-
service (DDoS) attack. In a DDoS attack, the attacker uses 
multiple systems, often compromised ones from different 
locations, to flood a target system with requests, making the 
target slow or inaccessible. 
Option A is incorrect. A man-in-the-middle attack involves an 
attacker secretly intercepting and possibly altering the 
communication between two parties. It doesn’t lead to website 
inaccessibility due to high traffic. 
Option B is incorrect. DNS spoofing is when an attacker 
introduces corrupt DNS cache information to redirect traffic to a 
different IP address, usually under the attacker’s control. It 
doesn’t cause increased traffic from various countries. 
Option D is incorrect. ARP poisoning is a technique by which 
an attacker sends fake ARP messages onto a local area network. 
This is usually used to link an attacker’s MAC address with the 
IP address of another host, causing any traffic meant for that IP 
address to be sent to the attacker instead. 
Question 217. A security auditor found that a website’s login 
form returns detailed error messages like “Incorrect column 
name” or “Table not found.” Which type of vulnerability could 
attackers potentially exploit using this information? 
(A)       Brute Force Attack 
(B)       Structured Query Language injection (SQLi) 
(C)       Man-in-the-Middle Attack 
(D)       Session Hijacking 
	
 
317

Explanation 217. Correct Answer: B. Structured Query 
Language injection (SQLi). When websites provide detailed 
database error messages, it can give attackers clues about the 
database structure, making it easier for them to craft successful 
SQL injection attacks. 
By returning detailed database error messages, the website 
inadvertently provides attackers with valuable insights into the 
database structure and potential points of vulnerability. This can 
be used to refine and enhance SQLi attacks, enabling attackers 
to potentially access, modify, or delete data. 
Option A is incorrect. A Brute Force Attack involves trying 
many passwords or passphrases to guess the right one. Detailed 
error messages from a database are not typically used in brute 
force attacks. 
Option C is incorrect. Man-in-the-Middle Attack intercepts 
and possibly alters the communication between two parties. 
Database error messages are not directly related to this type of 
attack. 
Option D is incorrect. Session Hijacking involves taking over 
an active user session. Detailed database error messages don’t 
play a direct role in this type of attack. 
Question 218. An employee at a large corporation has recently 
installed an app on his company-issued mobile device from a 
website instead of the approved app store. The app claimed to 
help boost productivity, but soon after, sensitive data from the 
mobile device was found to be transmitted to an unknown 
	
 
318

server. What mobile vulnerability was exploited? 
(A)       Inadequate password policies 
(B)       Open Wi-Fi connection 
(C)       Mobile device side loading 
(D)       Lack of mobile device encryption 
Explanation 218. Correct Answer: C. Mobile device side 
loading. Side loading refers to the practice of installing apps on 
a mobile device from sources other than the approved app store. 
This can expose the device to apps that have not been vetted for 
security, leading to potential data compromise, as described in 
the scenario. 
Option A is incorrect. While inadequate password policies can 
expose a device to unauthorized access, the scenario specifically 
mentions an app installed from an unapproved source, which 
points to side loading. 
Option B is incorrect. An open Wi-Fi connection can expose 
mobile devices to threats, but the main issue described in the 
scenario revolves around the installation of an app from an 
unapproved source. 
Option D is incorrect. While mobile device encryption is 
essential to protect data, the issue in the scenario is related to 
side loading, not the encryption status of the device. 
Question 219. The IT department of XYZ Corp noticed that 
server logs are recording user login attempts during non-
business hours, specifically between 2:00 AM and 3:00 AM, a 
time when no scheduled tasks or backups are set to run. Which 
	
 
319

of the following is the MOST plausible explanation for this 
unusual activity? 
(A)       The company's employees are working overtime 
(B)       There might be a time zone misconfiguration on the 
server 
(C)       An unauthorized user is trying to gain access to the 
server 
(D)       The server is automatically installing security patches 
Explanation 219. Correct Answer: C. An unauthorized user 
is trying to gain access to the server. Out-of-cycle logging that 
occurs during unusual hours, especially when no scheduled 
tasks are set, can be a significant indicator of malicious activity. 
In this scenario, the logging of user login attempts during non-
business hours suggests an unauthorized user might be 
attempting access. 
Option A is incorrect. While employees might occasionally 
work overtime, regular login attempts specifically between 2:00 
AM and 3:00 AM are suspicious. 
Option B is incorrect. A time zone misconfiguration might 
cause time discrepancies in logs, but it wouldn’t result in 
repeated login attempts. 
Option D is incorrect. Automatic security patch installations 
wouldn’t result in user login attempts. 
Question 220. An employee notices a stranger standing 
unusually close to her with an unfamiliar device while she uses 
her RFID badge to enter the office building. A few days later, 
	
 
320

her colleague’s badge suddenly stops working, even though it 
was not reported lost or damaged. What type of attack should 
the security team suspect? 
(A)       Brute force attack on the access control system 
(B)       RFID cloning 
(C)       Tailgating 
(D)       RFID jamming 
Explanation 220. Correct Answer: B. RFID cloning. RFID 
cloning involves making an unauthorized copy of an RFID 
badge or tag by capturing its signal. The stranger standing 
unusually close with a device might have been capturing the 
RFID signal to clone it. 
Option A is incorrect. While a brute force attack on an access 
control system involves trying multiple combinations to gain 
access, the scenario does not describe multiple access attempts 
or any involvement with the system itself. 
Option C is incorrect. Tailgating involves following an 
authorized individual into a secure area without the proper 
credentials. The scenario describes a potential RFID capture, 
not someone following another person. 
Option D is incorrect. RFID jamming would involve 
interfering with the RFID signal to prevent it from working, not 
copying the RFID details for unauthorized use.

Question 221. The networking team at SecureNet Corp. is 
setting up a new branch office. They want to ensure secure 
connectivity between the branch office and the main office. 
Which of the following would BEST provide this? 
(A)       Establishing a clear line of sight for wireless antennas 
between the two locations 
(B)       Implementing a Virtual Private Network (VPN) 
between the two sites 
(C)       Increasing bandwidth on the public internet connection 
at both locations 
(D)       Using multi-factor authentication for all user accounts 
in both locations 
Explanation 221. Correct Answer: B. Implementing a 
Virtual Private Network (VPN) between the two sites. VPNs 
provide secure, encrypted connections over potentially insecure 
networks, such as the internet, making them ideal for securely 
connecting remote locations. 
Option A is incorrect. While a clear line of sight might 
facilitate wireless communication, it doesn’t inherently provide 
secure connectivity. 
Option C is incorrect. Increasing bandwidth enhances data 
transfer rates but doesn’t inherently secure the connection 
between sites. 
	
 
355

Option D is incorrect. Multi-factor authentication is a robust 
security measure for user access but doesn’t secure network 
connectivity between sites. 
Question 222. A rapidly growing e-commerce company has 
recently experienced an increase in cross-site scripting (XSS) 
and SQL injection attacks. The company wants to deploy a 
solution that specifically protects against these threats at the 
application layer. Which type of firewall would be most 
appropriate? 
(A)       Stateful Packet Inspection Firewall 
(B)       Proxy Firewall 
(C)       Network Layer Firewall 
(D)       Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
Explanation 222. Correct Answer: D. Web Application 
Firewall (WAF). A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is 
specifically designed to protect web applications by monitoring, 
filtering, and blocking potentially harmful HTTP traffic. This 
includes protection against threats like XSS and SQL injection 
attacks that are common against web applications. 
Option A is incorrect. While a Stateful Packet Inspection 
Firewall can monitor the state of active connections and make 
decisions based on the context of the traffic, it doesn’t 
specifically address application layer vulnerabilities like XSS 
and SQL injection. 
Option B is incorrect. Although a Proxy Firewall can provide 
some application layer filtering, its primary purpose is not 
	
 
356

tailored to protect against specific web application 
vulnerabilities. 
Option C is incorrect. A Network Layer Firewall primarily 
operates at the network layer and won’t provide specialized 
protection against application layer threats. 
Question 223. SecureNet, a cybersecurity firm, is implementing 
an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for its enterprise client. 
Where should the IDS be placed for optimal detection of 
malicious activities? 
(A)       Before the perimeter firewall to capture all inbound 
traffic 
(B)       Between the perimeter firewall and the internal 
network to monitor the filtered traffic 
(C)       Inside the DMZ to monitor only external service 
requests 
(D)       Adjacent to each workstation for personalized security 
Explanation 223. Correct Answer: B. Between the perimeter 
firewall and the internal network to monitor the filtered 
traffic. By placing the IDS between the firewall and the internal 
network, it can monitor traffic that has passed through the 
firewall’s filters. This position provides a balance between 
capturing potential threats and reducing false positives from 
benign external traffic. 
Option A is incorrect. While placing the IDS before the 
firewall will capture all inbound traffic, it may result in a high 
number of false positives since a lot of benign traffic might 
trigger alarms. 
	
 
357

Option C is incorrect. Placing the IDS only in the DMZ would 
limit its visibility to only external service requests and not the 
overall internal traffic which might have potential threats. 
Option D is incorrect. While personal IDS on each workstation 
provides granular monitoring, it does not provide a holistic view 
of network activities and can be resource-intensive. 
Question 224. An online gaming platform experiences latency 
issues during multiplayer sessions, affecting the gameplay 
experience of its users. The company wants to ensure real-time 
responsiveness for its players worldwide. Which of the 
following solutions would BEST mitigate these latency issues? 
(A)       Implementing a Content Delivery Network (CDN) 
(B)       Introducing stricter user authentication methods 
(C)       Deploying a centralized database server 
(D)       Reducing the game's graphical fidelity 
Explanation 224. Correct Answer: A. Implementing a 
Content Delivery Network (CDN). A CDN involves 
distributing the hosting of content to multiple locations around 
the world. For online gaming, this means players can connect to 
a server closer to their geographic location, thereby reducing 
latency and improving responsiveness. 
Option B is incorrect. While strong authentication methods are 
crucial for security, they don’t address latency or improve the 
real-time responsiveness of the gaming platform. 
	
 
358

Option C is incorrect. Centralizing the database server might 
actually increase latency for users who are far from the central 
location. 
Option D is incorrect. Reducing graphical fidelity can improve 
game performance on the client side, but it doesn’t address 
network latency or the real-time responsiveness of multiplayer 
sessions. 
Question 225. The software development team at ABC Corp. 
has created a unique application that utilizes innovative 
algorithms. The company wants to ensure that competitors 
cannot legally copy or replicate their application’s functionality. 
Which of the following would be the MOST suitable method to 
protect this intellectual property? 
(A)       Copyright the user interface design 
(B)       Apply for a patent for the innovative algorithms 
(C)       Store the application code in an encrypted vault 
(D)       Ensure all users sign an acceptable use policy (AUP) 
Explanation 225. Correct Answer: B. Apply for a patent for 
the innovative algorithms. Patents provide legal protection for 
inventions, allowing the inventor or patent holder the exclusive 
right to the patented process, design, or invention for a certain 
period. In this case, patenting the algorithms would prevent 
competitors from legally replicating the application’s unique 
functionality. 
Option A is incorrect. Copyrighting the user interface design 
would only protect the visual appearance and elements of the 
	
 
359

application, not its unique functionality or underlying 
algorithms. 
Option C is incorrect. While storing the application code in an 
encrypted vault protects it from unauthorized access, it does not 
provide legal protection against replication by competitors if 
they develop similar functionality independently. 
Option D is incorrect. An acceptable use policy (AUP) defines 
how users are allowed to use the software or system, but it 
doesn’t offer protection against competitors copying the 
application’s unique functionality. 
Question 226. A company is evaluating its data storage options. 
They need a solution that provides them with the highest level 
of control over their hardware, software, and network 
configurations, allowing for customized security controls and 
measures. Which deployment model would best suit their 
needs? 
(A)       Cloud-based Infrastructure 
(B)       Hybrid Infrastructure 
(C)       On-premises Infrastructure 
(D)       Community Cloud 
Explanation 226. Correct Answer: C. On-premises 
Infrastructure. On-premises infrastructure allows 
organizations to have complete control over their hardware, 
software, and network configurations. This gives them the 
freedom to customize security controls and measures tailored to 
their specific needs. 
	
 
360

Option A is incorrect. Cloud-based infrastructures are hosted 
by third-party providers, which means organizations might not 
have the same level of control or customization over their 
resources. 
Option B is incorrect. Hybrid infrastructure combines on-
premises and cloud resources. While it offers more control than 
purely cloud-based solutions, it still doesn’t provide the total 
control that on-premises infrastructure does. 
Option D is incorrect. A community cloud is shared by several 
organizations with similar requirements. While it offers some 
level of control, it doesn’t provide the complete customization 
and control that an on-premises infrastructure does. 
Question 227. An organization is evaluating different security 
solutions for their new branch office. They want to ensure that 
the chosen solution can be rapidly deployed with minimal 
configuration. Which of the following options BEST fulfills this 
requirement? 
(A)       A customized Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) 
tailored to the organization's unique needs 
(B)       A zero-touch provisioning firewall 
(C)       An open-source firewall with extensive manual settings 
(D)       A security information and event management (SIEM) 
solution requiring manual log source integration 
Explanation 227. Correct Answer: B. A zero-touch 
provisioning firewall. Zero-touch provisioning allows devices 
to be provisioned and configured automatically, ensuring rapid 
deployment with minimal manual intervention. 
	
 
361

Option A is incorrect. While a customized IPS might be 
tailored for the organization’s needs, it often requires a lot of 
configuration and isn’t the fastest to deploy. 
Option C is incorrect. Open-source firewalls that require 
extensive manual settings are not considered rapid to deploy as 
they necessitate more time for configuration. 
Option D is incorrect. A SIEM solution that requires manual 
log source integration would not be the quickest to deploy due 
to the manual steps involved. 
Question 228. In a microservices architecture, each service 
should be designed with a specific principle to ensure it 
performs a specific task and interacts with other services 
through well-defined interfaces. What principle is this referring 
to? 
(A)       Principle of Least Privilege 
(B)       Single Responsibility Principle 
(C)       Open-Closed Principle 
(D)       Zero Trust Model 
Explanation 228. Correct Answer: B. Single Responsibility 
Principle. The Single Responsibility Principle dictates that a 
class or module (or in the context of microservices, a service) 
should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only 
have one job or responsibility. In microservices, this ensures 
that each service does one thing and does it well, and interacts 
with others through clear interfaces. 
	
 
362

Option A is incorrect. The Principle of Least Privilege is about 
ensuring that users or services have only the permissions they 
need to perform their tasks and nothing more. It’s not 
specifically about the design of the service itself. 
Option C is incorrect. The Open-Closed Principle is a design 
principle stating that software entities should be open for 
extension but closed for modification. While relevant for 
software design, it’s not the primary principle guiding the 
design of individual microservices. 
Option D is incorrect. The Zero Trust Model is a security 
concept where no one, whether inside or outside the 
organization, is trusted by default. It’s not a principle specific to 
microservice design. 
Question 229. An organization that processes classified 
information is implementing a network infrastructure to ensure 
the highest level of data security. The CISO recommends using 
a network configuration that ensures the system remains 
completely disconnected from unsecured networks and any 
external connections. Which of the following describes this type 
of configuration? 
(A)       DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) 
(B)       VPN (Virtual Private Network) 
(C)       VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) 
(D)       Air-gapped network 
Explanation 229. Correct Answer: D. Air-gapped network. 
An air-gapped network is a network that is physically isolated 
from unsecured networks. Computers on an air-gapped network 
	
 
363

cannot communicate with non-air-gapped computers and aren’t 
connected to external networks or the internet, ensuring the 
highest level of data security. 
Option A is incorrect. A DMZ is a buffer zone between a 
private network and external networks (typically the internet). 
It’s designed to provide an additional layer of security but does 
not guarantee complete isolation. 
Option B is incorrect. VPNs are used to establish secure 
connections over an unsecured network, such as the internet. 
They encrypt the data being transferred but don’t physically 
isolate a network. 
Option C is incorrect. A VLAN is a logically segmented 
network within a physical network. It allows for the separation 
of broadcast domains in a Layer 2 network, but it doesn’t 
provide complete physical isolation from other networks. 
Question 230. A large financial institution is planning to 
upgrade its IT infrastructure to allow for a more efficient use of 
hardware resources, faster deployment of applications, and 
reduced server provisioning times. While evaluating different 
technologies, which of the following would directly address 
these needs? 
(A)       Network Segmentation 
(B)       Intrusion Detection System 
(C)       Virtualization 
(D)       Multi-Factor Authentication 
	
 
364

Explanation 230. Correct Answer: C. Virtualization. 
Virtualization allows multiple virtual machines to run on a 
single physical host, maximizing the use of hardware resources. 
It enables rapid provisioning and deployment of new servers 
and applications, addressing the requirements of the financial 
institution. 
Option A is incorrect. Network segmentation divides a 
network into smaller subnetworks, primarily for security and 
performance reasons. While it’s a best practice, it doesn’t 
address the efficient use of hardware or rapid deployment of 
applications. 
Option B is incorrect. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
monitors and detects malicious activities in a network. While 
crucial for security, it doesn’t cater to hardware resource 
efficiency or faster server provisioning. 
Option D is incorrect. Multi-Factor Authentication is a security 
process in which a user provides multiple methods of 
identification to authenticate their identity. It doesn’t impact 
hardware resource efficiency or application deployment times. 
Question 231. A financial institution wants to enhance the 
security of its wired network. The goal is to ensure that only 
authorized devices can connect to the network, and the 
authentication process should be based on credentials or digital 
certificates. Which of the following protocols would best serve 
this purpose? 
(A)       SNMPv3 
(B)       SSL/TLS 
	
 
365

(C)       802.1X EAP 
(D)       DHCP 
Explanation 231. Correct Answer: C. 802.1X EAP. 802.1X 
Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides port-based 
network access control and is used on wired networks to ensure 
that only authenticated devices can connect. It supports multiple 
authentication methods including credentials, digital 
certificates, and smart cards. 
Option A is incorrect. SNMPv3 (Simple Network Management 
Protocol version 3) is used for network management and 
monitoring, not for port-based network access control. 
Option B is incorrect. SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/
Transport Layer Security) is a protocol used for securing data 
transmission on the internet, not for port-based network access 
control. 
Option D is incorrect. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration 
Protocol) assigns IP addresses to devices on a network but 
doesn’t deal with port-based authentication. 
Question 232. TechBlitz Inc. recently underwent an IT audit, 
and one of the suggestions was to reduce the attack surface. 
Which of the following measures would be MOST effective in 
accomplishing this? 
(A)       Increasing the password length requirement for all users 
(B)       Implementing regular vulnerability assessments 
(C)       Deactivating unused services and ports on servers 
	
 
366

(D)       Implementing a strict BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) 
policy 
Explanation 232. Correct Answer: C. Deactivating unused 
services and ports on servers. Reducing the number of active 
services and ports directly diminishes the number of potential 
entry points for attackers, thus reducing the attack surface. 
Option A is incorrect. While increasing password length 
improves security against brute-force attacks, it doesn’t directly 
affect the attack surface. 
Option B is incorrect. Regular vulnerability assessments 
identify potential security gaps, but simply identifying doesn’t 
reduce the attack surface unless actions are taken based on 
findings. 
Option D is incorrect. A strict BYOD policy can enhance 
security, but it’s focused more on the types of devices and how 
they connect rather than reducing the number of potential attack 
points. 
Question 233. SafeMed, a medical facility, uses a life-saving 
medical device with embedded software. Recently, a security 
vulnerability was found in the software, but due to the device’s 
FDA regulatory status and the software’s design, it cannot be 
patched immediately. How should SafeMed address the security 
concerns related to this device? 
(A)       Disconnect the device from all networks and only use it 
in standalone mode 
(B)       Inform patients about the vulnerability and let them 
	
 
367

decide whether to use the device 
(C)       Implement network segmentation and strictly 
control access to the device 
(D)       Return the device to the manufacturer for a full refund 
Explanation 233. Correct Answer: C. Implement network 
segmentation and strictly control access to the device. By 
implementing network segmentation, SafeMed can isolate the 
vulnerable device from other parts of the network, reducing the 
risk of potential exploitation. Strictly controlling access ensures 
only authorized personnel can use or interact with the device. 
Option A is incorrect. Completely disconnecting the device 
might limit its functionality, especially if it needs network 
access for updates, data transfer, or other essential operations. 
Option B is incorrect. While transparency is important, simply 
informing patients without taking protective measures may not 
be enough to ensure safety and could lead to panic or 
misinformation. 
Option D is incorrect. Returning the device might not be 
feasible, especially if there are no immediate replacements 
available, and it is vital for patient care. 
Question 234. A smart city project is deploying various IoT 
sensors across the city to gather data on traffic patterns, 
weather, pollution levels, and more. Which of the following is 
the MOST critical security consideration when deploying these 
sensors? 
(A)       Ensuring high data transfer speeds to cater to the 
	
 
368

volume of data from the IoT sensors 
(B)       Limiting the IoT devices to communicate only with 
specific, pre-defined servers 
(C)       Installing physical locks on IoT devices to prevent theft 
(D)       Allowing IoT devices to connect to any available 
network for data redundancy 
Explanation 234. Correct Answer: B. Limiting the IoT 
devices to communicate only with specific, pre-defined 
servers. By restricting IoT devices to communicate only with 
specific, trusted servers, unauthorized access and data 
tampering risks can be minimized. This measure ensures that 
data is only sent to and received from legitimate sources. 
Option A is incorrect. While data transfer speeds are important 
for performance and real-time analytics, from a security 
standpoint, the integrity and confidentiality of the data is more 
crucial. 
Option C is incorrect. While physical security is an essential 
aspect, especially in a public setting, the most significant risks 
with IoT often pertain to data security and unauthorized access. 
Option D is incorrect. Allowing IoT devices to connect to any 
available network can introduce significant security 
vulnerabilities, such as man-in-the-middle attacks, 
eavesdropping, or unauthorized data tampering. 
Question 235. A multinational corporation is looking to replace 
its current firewalls at all its global branches. The IT director 
wants a solution that can perform stateful inspection of packets, 
	
 
369

application-level filtering, and integrate threat intelligence feeds 
for updated threat awareness. Which of the following would be 
the most suitable solution? 
(A)       Stateful Packet Inspection Firewall 
(B)       Proxy Server 
(C)       Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
(D)       Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) 
Explanation 235. Correct Answer: D. Next-Generation 
Firewall (NGFW). Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs) are 
designed to offer traditional firewall capabilities such as stateful 
inspection but also come with advanced features like 
application-level filtering and the ability to integrate with threat 
intelligence feeds. This makes NGFWs suitable for modern, 
complex environments that demand multi-layered security 
features. 
Option A is incorrect. While a Stateful Packet Inspection 
Firewall can monitor the state of active connections and analyze 
the packets, it doesn’t offer advanced features like application-
level filtering or the integration of threat intelligence feeds that 
a NGFW does. 
Option B is incorrect. A Proxy Server controls and filters 
requests from clients to servers, typically for web access. It 
doesn’t possess the comprehensive security functionalities of a 
NGFW. 
Option C is incorrect. A Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
specifically protects web applications from targeted attacks. 
	
 
370

While valuable, it doesn’t offer the breadth of features and 
integrations that a NGFW does. 
Question 236. A multinational organization with multiple 
branch offices is looking to simplify their WAN connectivity 
and reduce costs while ensuring that their inter-office data 
transfers remain secure. Which technology would best fit their 
needs? 
(A)       VLAN 
(B)       MPLS 
(C)       SD-WAN 
(D)       DMZ 
Explanation 236. Correct Answer: C. SD-WAN. Software-
defined wide area network (SD-WAN) offers enterprises the 
ability to leverage any combination of transport services, 
including MPLS, LTE, and broadband internet services, to 
securely connect users to applications. SD-WAN can reduce 
costs by enabling the use of lower-cost internet connections and 
can also simplify WAN management. 
Option A is incorrect. VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is 
used to segment a local network into different broadcast 
domains, but it does not facilitate WAN connectivity or reduce 
WAN costs. 
Option B is incorrect. MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) 
is a type of WAN technology that can be expensive. While it 
provides reliable and fast connections, it doesn’t offer the cost-
saving benefits or flexibility of SD-WAN. 
	
 
371

Option D is incorrect. DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) is a buffer 
zone between an organization’s internal network and the 
external, untrusted networks. It is not related to WAN 
connectivity or cost reduction. 
Question 237. A financial company wants to improve its web 
browsing security by intercepting and inspecting web traffic to 
prevent users from accessing malicious sites or downloading 
malware. They are looking for a solution that can act as an 
intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from 
other servers. What should the company implement? 
(A)       Network IDS 
(B)       VPN Concentrator 
(C)       Proxy server 
(D)       Jump server 
Explanation 237. Correct Answer: C. Proxy server. A Proxy 
server serves as an intermediary between the user’s computer 
and the internet. It intercepts web requests and can provide 
functions such as filtering web content, caching web requests, 
and inspecting traffic for security reasons. 
Option A is incorrect. A Network Intrusion Detection System 
(IDS) monitors and detects malicious activities on a network but 
does not function as an intermediary for web requests. 
Option B is incorrect. A VPN Concentrator provides secure 
remote access to an organization’s network but doesn’t act as an 
intermediary for web browsing requests. 
	
 
372

Option D is incorrect. A Jump server is used for secure and 
auditable access to internal servers but isn’t designed for 
intercepting web traffic. 
Question 238. In an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) model, 
which of the following tasks is typically the responsibility of the 
cloud customer in a standard Cloud Responsibility Matrix? 
(A)       Physical security of data centers 
(B)       Patching of host operating systems 
(C)       Network infrastructure maintenance 
(D)       Patching of guest operating systems 
Explanation 238. Correct Answer: D. Patching of guest 
operating systems. In an IaaS model, the customer is typically 
responsible for managing their own virtual machines, which 
includes patching the guest operating systems. The cloud 
provider is generally responsible for the physical infrastructure, 
network, and the host operating system. 
Option A is incorrect. Physical security of data centers is the 
responsibility of the cloud provider. The customer does not have 
control over the physical infrastructure in a cloud environment. 
Option B is incorrect. Patching of host operating systems is the 
cloud provider’s responsibility. They manage the underlying 
infrastructure, including the host systems. 
Option C is incorrect. Maintenance of network infrastructure 
is typically handled by the cloud provider, ensuring connectivity 
and uptime for the resources they offer. 
	
 
373

Question 239. In a cloud environment, which of the following 
matrices defines the shared responsibilities between the cloud 
provider and the customer for specific cloud service models? 
(A)       Shared Accountability Matrix 
(B)       Cloud Resource Allocation Table 
(C)       Cloud Security Posture Matrix 
(D)       Cloud Responsibility Matrix 
Explanation 239. Correct Answer: D. Cloud Responsibility 
Matrix. The Cloud Responsibility Matrix defines the shared 
responsibilities between the cloud provider and the customer in 
a cloud environment, delineating what security measures the 
provider will handle and which ones are the responsibility of the 
customer. 
Option A is incorrect. While the term “Shared Accountability 
Matrix” may sound relevant, there’s no standard matrix in cloud 
computing with this name. Shared responsibility is the concept, 
but the actual term used in the context of cloud security is the 
“Cloud Responsibility Matrix.” 
Option B is incorrect. A “Cloud Resource Allocation Table” is 
not a standard term associated with delineating responsibilities 
in the cloud. It sounds more related to how resources, such as 
compute or storage, might be allocated. 
Option C is incorrect. “Cloud Security Posture Matrix” is not a 
recognized term for defining shared responsibilities in cloud 
environments. Instead, it sounds more like a potential term for 
an organization’s stance or positioning regarding cloud security. 
	
 
374

Question 240. A financial organization collects and stores 
personally identifiable information (PII) of its customers. The 
company operates within jurisdictions that have strict 
regulations concerning the storage, transmission, and processing 
of such data. Which of the following strategies would be MOST 
appropriate for the company to ensure compliance with these 
regulations? 
(A)       Use open source encryption algorithms without 
validation 
(B)       Only store customer data in physical, on-site servers 
(C)       Implement data classification and labeling 
procedures 
(D)       Limit the number of administrators with access to the 
data 
Explanation 240. Correct Answer: C. Implement data 
classification and labeling procedures. By implementing data 
classification and labeling procedures, the organization can 
clearly identify which data is regulated, ensuring appropriate 
controls, access rights, and protective measures are in place. 
This aids in achieving compliance by setting clear guidelines on 
data handling based on the classification. 
Option A is incorrect. While encryption is essential for 
protecting sensitive data, using open source algorithms without 
validation might not ensure that the data is protected to the 
standards required by regulations. 
Option B is incorrect. Storing customer data only on physical, 
on-site servers doesn’t necessarily guarantee compliance. 
	
 
375

Regulations often require specific controls regardless of where 
the data is stored. 
Option D is incorrect. While limiting administrative access can 
reduce the risk of insider threats, it doesn’t directly ensure that 
the regulated data is handled in compliance with legal 
requirements. 
Question 241. During an annual review, a company discovered 
that one of its critical systems had several unscheduled 
downtimes over the year. The CTO has recommended a move 
towards high availability architecture to address this. What is 
the PRIMARY concern when implementing high availability? 
(A)       Ensuring that there are no single points of failure 
(B)       Ensuring that the system is patched regularly 
(C)       Implementing multi-factor authentication 
(D)       Storing backups in multiple geographical locations 
Explanation 241. Correct Answer: A. Ensuring that there 
are no single points of failure. In a high availability (HA) 
system, eliminating single points of failure is of utmost 
importance. By ensuring redundancy at every potential failure 
point, the system can remain operational even if a component 
fails. 
Option B is incorrect. While patching is important for security, 
it is not the primary concern when implementing high 
availability. 
	
 
376

Option C is incorrect. Multi-factor authentication is essential 
for secure access but does not directly relate to high availability 
architecture. 
Option D is incorrect. Having backups in various geographical 
locations is more relevant to disaster recovery than to high 
availability. 
Question 242. After a recent service outage, a hospital’s IT 
team is reviewing the availability of its patient record system. 
They want to ensure the system remains operational, even in the 
event of hardware failures. Which of the following 
considerations is MOST relevant to this requirement? 
(A)       Implementing database mirroring 
(B)       Regularly updating the system's antivirus definitions 
(C)       Using strong encryption for data at rest 
(D)       Conducting penetration testing on the system 
Explanation 242. Correct Answer: A. Implementing 
database mirroring. Database mirroring is a solution for 
increasing the availability of a SQL Server database. Mirroring 
is implemented on a per-database basis and works only with 
databases that use the full recovery model. This ensures that in 
the event of a hardware failure, there’s a mirrored copy of the 
data available. 
Option B is incorrect. While updating antivirus definitions is 
crucial for preventing malware infections, it is not directly 
	
 
377

related to ensuring high availability in the face of hardware 
failures. 
Option C is incorrect. Encryption is vital for data security but 
doesn’t directly address the high availability needs of a system. 
Option D is incorrect. Penetration testing identifies 
vulnerabilities in the system but doesn’t provide a solution for 
high availability in case of hardware failures. 
Question 243. An enterprise wants to configure its firewall so 
that if a malfunction occurs, the firewall should automatically 
allow traffic to ensure business continuity. Which failure mode 
should be implemented? 
(A)       Fail-safe 
(B)       Fail-over 
(C)       Fail-closed 
(D)       Fail-open 
Explanation 243. Correct Answer: D. Fail-open. In a fail-
open mode, when the system or device fails, it defaults to an 
“open” state, allowing traffic to pass through. This mode 
prioritizes availability over strict security. 
Option A is incorrect. “Fail-safe” is a term that typically refers 
to a system’s ability to default to a safe condition in case of a 
failure. However, in the context of firewalls and access control 
systems, “fail-open” or “fail-closed” are the preferred terms. 
Option B is incorrect. “Fail-over” refers to switching to a 
backup system or component in the event of a failure. It doesn’t 
	
 
378

describe the behavior of allowing or denying traffic during a 
failure. 
Option C is incorrect. Fail-closed means that when a 
malfunction occurs, the system would block all traffic by 
default, which is the opposite of what the enterprise wants. 
Question 244. An organization with a single physical network 
infrastructure wants to separate the traffic of its finance 
department from that of the HR department. They do not want 
to set up entirely new physical networks but want to ensure that 
data packets from one department do not mix with the other’s. 
What should the organization implement? 
(A)       Air-gapped network 
(B)       DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) 
(C)       VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) 
(D)       VPN (Virtual Private Network) 
Explanation 244. Correct Answer: C. VLAN (Virtual Local 
Area Network). A VLAN allows a network administrator to 
create a logical network within a physical network. This logical 
segmentation can separate the traffic of different departments, 
ensuring that data packets from one VLAN do not mix with 
another, effectively isolating them. 
Option A is incorrect. An air-gapped network is a physically 
isolated network and would require setting up a new physical 
network. 
	
 
379

Option B is incorrect. A DMZ is a buffer zone between a 
private network and external networks. It doesn’t help in 
segmenting traffic within the internal network. 
Option D is incorrect. A VPN is used to create secure 
connections over an unsecured network. It does not logically 
segment traffic within a single physical network. 
Question 245. A large organization is considering deploying a 
solution that will allow employees to securely access company 
resources remotely using their personal devices. The 
organization wants a solution that can provide strong 
authentication and ensure that the data remains confidential 
during transit. Which technology should be adopted? 
(A)       Kerberos 
(B)       Remote Desktop Services (RDS) 
(C)       Remote Access VPN 
(D)       SNMP 
Explanation 245. Correct Answer: C. Remote Access VPN. 
Remote Access VPN provides a secure connection from a 
remote device to an organization’s internal network. It uses 
encryption to ensure data confidentiality and can also be set up 
with strong authentication methods. 
Option A is incorrect. Kerberos is an authentication protocol 
that uses tickets to allow nodes to prove their identity in a 
network. While it provides strong authentication, it doesn’t 
inherently provide a solution for remote access with encrypted 
communication. 
	
 
380

Option B is incorrect. Remote Desktop Services (RDS) allows 
users to access a remote desktop or application. While it can be 
secured, it doesn’t always ensure encryption during transit, 
especially if not paired with another technology like VPN. 
Option D is incorrect. SNMP (Simple Network Management 
Protocol) is used for managing and monitoring network devices. 
It isn’t related to providing secure remote access for users. 
Question 246. An e-commerce company wants to ensure that 
their customers’ credit card data remains confidential while in 
transit over the internet. They are seeking a protocol that can 
help in securing their website’s communication. Which protocol 
would best fit this requirement? 
(A)       IPSec 
(B)       SSH 
(C)       TLS 
(D)       ICMP 
Explanation 246. Correct Answer: C. TLS. Transport Layer 
Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol that ensures data 
confidentiality and integrity over the internet. Websites use TLS 
to secure all communications between their servers and web 
browsers, making it suitable for e-commerce platforms to secure 
sensitive customer data. 
Option A is incorrect. IPSec is a suite of protocols that secures 
IP communications by encrypting and authenticating all IP 
packets. It is more commonly used for VPNs rather than 
securing web communications. 
	
 
381

Option B is incorrect. SSH (Secure Shell) is primarily used for 
secure remote access to systems, not for securing web-based 
communications. 
Option D is incorrect. ICMP (Internet Control Message 
Protocol) is used by network devices to send error messages and 
operational information, not for securing data in transit. 
Question 247. A rapidly growing e-commerce platform has 
been facing intermittent downtimes, especially during sale 
events. To ensure high availability and even distribution of 
traffic among servers, the company is considering deploying a 
specific type of network appliance. Which of the following 
should the company deploy? 
(A)       Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
(B)       VPN concentrator 
(C)       Load balancer 
(D)       Proxy server 
Explanation 247. Correct Answer: C. Load balancer. A load 
balancer is designed to distribute incoming network traffic 
across multiple servers to ensure that no single server is 
overwhelmed with too much traffic. This helps in ensuring high 
availability and optimizing resource utilization. 
Option A is incorrect. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is 
primarily used for detecting malicious activities in the network, 
not for distributing traffic among servers. 
	
 
382

Option B is incorrect. A VPN concentrator is used to create 
and manage VPN connections, not for balancing load among 
servers. 
Option D is incorrect. While a proxy server can distribute 
client requests to different servers, its primary role is to act as 
an intermediary, not to ensure high availability or evenly 
distribute traffic. 
Question 248. An organization is transitioning its IT 
infrastructure to be cloud-centric and aims to adopt a zero-trust 
network approach. They are looking for a solution that 
integrates cloud security, zero-trust access, and WAN 
capabilities, ensuring employees have consistent secure access 
regardless of their location. Which of the following best 
addresses their needs? 
(A)       Remote Desktop Services (RDS) 
(B)       Secure access service edge (SASE) 
(C)       Content Delivery Network (CDN) 
(D)      Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) 
Explanation 248. Correct Answer: B. Secure access service 
edge (SASE). SASE integrates multiple network and security 
functions traditionally delivered in separate point solutions. This 
includes capabilities such as Secure Web Gateway (SWG), 
Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), Firewall-as-a-Service 
(FWaaS), and Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), all delivered 
from a globally distributed set of cloud-native platforms. 
Option A is incorrect. Remote Desktop Services (RDS) 
enables users to connect to a graphical interface of a remote 
	
 
383

computer, but it doesn’t inherently combine cloud security, 
zero-trust access, and WAN capabilities like SASE. 
Option C is incorrect. A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is 
designed to deliver web content and web applications to users 
based on their geographical location. It doesn’t provide 
integrated cloud security and WAN capabilities. 
Option D is incorrect. A Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) 
segments a physical network into multiple isolated networks. It 
doesn’t offer the combined benefits of cloud security, zero-trust 
access, and WAN capabilities like SASE. 
Question 249. A medium-sized e-commerce company recently 
experienced a data breach due to an external attack. Post-
incident analysis revealed that while there were indications of 
the attack in their network traffic, no alarms were raised at the 
time of the attack. The company now wants to implement a 
solution to actively monitor and take action against malicious 
network traffic. Which of the following should they deploy? 
(A)       Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
(B)       Network Access Control (NAC) 
(C)       Proxy server 
(D)       Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) 
Explanation 249. Correct Answer: D. Intrusion Prevention 
System (IPS). An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) not only 
detects malicious network activities but also takes active steps 
to prevent or block them, which is ideal for a company looking 
to bolster its defenses against real-time threats. 
	
 
384

Option A is incorrect. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
will detect and alert on malicious activity but does not take 
active steps to prevent the threat. 
Option B is incorrect. Network Access Control (NAC) is 
primarily used for controlling network access based on policies, 
not for active monitoring and prevention of malicious network 
traffic. 
Option C is incorrect. A Proxy server acts as an intermediary 
for requests from clients seeking resources but is not 
specifically designed to detect or prevent intrusions. 
Question 250. GreenTech, a data center company, is planning to 
expand its operations in a region known for frequent power 
outages. To maintain security posture and ensure continuity of 
operations, which of the following should be their PRIMARY 
consideration regarding power? 
(A)       Using power-efficient servers to reduce electricity costs 
(B)       Setting up solar panels to promote green energy 
(C)       Investing in redundant power supplies and 
uninterruptible power systems (UPS) 
(D)       Running operations only during peak daylight hours to 
ensure natural lighting 
Explanation 250. Correct Answer: C. Investing in 
redundant power supplies and uninterruptible power 
systems (UPS). Given the frequent power outages in the region, 
having redundant power supplies and UPS ensures that 
operations continue smoothly without abrupt interruptions, 
	
 
385

which can lead to system crashes, data corruption, or security 
breaches. 
Option A is incorrect. While power-efficient servers can 
reduce costs, they do not address the primary concern of power 
outages and maintaining operations. 
Option B is incorrect. Solar panels promote green energy but 
might not provide consistent and immediate power backup 
during outages, especially during nighttime or cloudy days. 
Option D is incorrect. Limiting operations to daylight hours is 
not a practical solution for a data center, as it restricts 
operational capacity and doesn’t directly address the issue of 
power outages. 
Question 251. A startup company anticipates rapid growth in its 
user base over the next year. They are considering an 
architectural model for their application that can handle the 
projected growth without performance issues. Which of the 
following would be the BEST design consideration for this 
situation? 
(A)       Implementing strict password policies 
(B)       Using a monolithic application design 
(C)       Integrating a DDoS protection mechanism 
(D)       Adopting a microservices architecture 
Explanation 251. Correct Answer: D. Adopting a 
microservices architecture. Microservices architecture breaks 
down an application into small, independent services that run as 
	
 
386

separate processes. This allows for better scalability as each 
service can be scaled individually based on the demand. 
Option A is incorrect. While strict password policies are good 
for security, they don’t directly address the scalability concerns 
of the application architecture. 
Option B is incorrect. Monolithic designs are often harder to 
scale as changes or scaling in one area can affect the entire 
application. 
Option C is incorrect. While DDoS protection is essential for 
defending against certain types of cyberattacks, it doesn’t 
address the scalability of the application’s core architecture. 
Question 252. A healthcare provider is updating its network 
infrastructure. Due to the sensitive nature of the medical data 
they handle, they want to ensure that any anomalies or 
malicious activities in the network are immediately detected and 
alerted. Which system should they primarily consider? 
(A)       Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) 
(B)       Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
(C)       DHCP server 
(D)       VPN concentrator 
Explanation 252. Correct Answer: B. Intrusion Detection 
System (IDS). An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) actively 
monitors network traffic for any signs of malicious activities or 
policy violations and alerts the administrators. It is suitable for 
organizations that want to ensure anomalies are promptly 
detected. 
	
 
387

Option A is incorrect. An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) 
does actively monitor and detect malicious traffic but also takes 
measures to prevent it. While an IPS could be beneficial for the 
healthcare provider, the primary requirement mentioned was for 
detection and alerting, which is the primary function of an IDS. 
Option C is incorrect. A DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration 
Protocol) server assigns IP addresses to devices in a network. It 
does not monitor or alert on malicious network activities. 
Option D is incorrect. A VPN concentrator is used to create 
and manage VPN connections, providing secure access to a 
network, but it doesn’t primarily detect intrusions. 
Question 253. The IT security team at a large corporation is 
evaluating monitoring tools for network traffic. They need a 
solution that can inspect network packets without introducing 
any potential latency or altering the network flow. Which type 
of device attribute should they consider? 
(A)       Active IDS 
(B)       Passive firewall 
(C)       Active firewall 
(D)       Passive IDS 
Explanation 253. Correct Answer: D. Passive IDS. Passive 
IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is designed to monitor and 
analyze network traffic without influencing the traffic flow or 
causing potential latency. It observes traffic in real-time but 
doesn’t take active actions on its own. 
	
 
388

Option A is incorrect. An Active IDS can detect potential 
security breaches and take action, which may introduce latency 
or alter the traffic flow. 
Option B is incorrect. While the term “passive firewall” is not 
standard, traditional firewalls can actively block or allow traffic, 
which can introduce changes to the network flow. 
Option C is incorrect. An Active firewall actively filters 
network traffic based on configured policies, potentially 
affecting the network flow. 
Question 254. A developer at your company is excited about 
the scalability benefits of serverless architecture and has 
deployed a new service using it. However, you notice an 
increased bill due to the service even when it’s not in use. 
Which of the following could be a contributing factor? 
(A)       The serverless functions are continuously triggered 
by unintended events 
(B)       The server hardware is outdated 
(C)       The load balancer is misconfigured 
(D)       The organization lacks a Content Delivery Network 
(CDN) 
Explanation 254. Correct Answer: A. The serverless 
functions are continuously triggered by unintended events. 
Serverless architectures charge based on the number of function 
invocations and the execution time. If there are unintended 
events, such as rogue requests or misconfigured triggers, 
continuously invoking the serverless functions, it could lead to 
unexpected costs. 
	
 
389

Option B is incorrect. In a serverless architecture, the 
responsibility of server hardware management lies with the 
service provider. The customer is abstracted from the hardware 
details. 
Option C is incorrect. A misconfigured load balancer might 
affect availability or performance but is not directly related to 
unexpected cost hikes in a serverless deployment. 
Option D is incorrect. While CDNs are valuable for optimizing 
content delivery, they are not directly related to the cost 
implications of unintended function invocations in a serverless 
architecture. 
Question 255. After a recent security breach, CyberCorp is 
reviewing its software vendors for their responsiveness to 
vulnerabilities. Which of the following metrics would BEST 
assist CyberCorp in determining the timeliness and efficiency of 
security patches from a vendor? 
(A)       The frequency of software updates released by the 
vendor 
(B)       The vendor's quarterly financial reports 
(C)       Time between vulnerability disclosure and patch 
release by the vendor 
(D)       The number of features added by the vendor in the last 
software update 
Explanation 255. Correct Answer: C. Time between 
vulnerability disclosure and patch release by the vendor. The 
time taken by a vendor to release a security patch after a 
vulnerability is disclosed is a direct measure of their 
	
 
390

responsiveness to security threats. A shorter duration indicates a 
higher prioritization of security concerns. 
Option A is incorrect. Frequency of software updates does not 
necessarily correlate with timely security patches. A vendor 
might release frequent updates but still be slow in addressing 
security issues. 
Option B is incorrect. A vendor’s quarterly financial reports 
might indicate the financial health of the company but does not 
directly reflect their responsiveness to security vulnerabilities. 
Option D is incorrect. The number of features added in a 
software update does not indicate the timeliness or effectiveness 
of security patches. 
Question 256. XYZ Corp. has recently developed a new 
manufacturing process that reduces production costs by 50%. 
This process is not yet patented and is considered a trade secret. 
The company wants to ensure that employees do not disclose 
this process to competitors. Which of the following would be 
the MOST effective strategy to achieve this? 
(A)       Providing employees with a bonus for keeping the 
process confidential 
(B)       Conducting random checks of employee 
communications 
(C)       Implementing a mandatory non-disclosure 
agreement (NDA) for all employees 
(D)       Hosting quarterly seminars to educate employees about 
the value of the trade secret 
	
 
391

Explanation 256. Correct Answer: C. Implementing a 
mandatory non-disclosure agreement (NDA) for all 
employees. An NDA is a legally binding contract that prohibits 
employees from disclosing confidential information, like trade 
secrets. If an employee breaches the NDA, the company has 
legal grounds to seek damages or other remedies. 
Option A is incorrect. While bonuses might provide an 
incentive for employees, it doesn’t provide a binding legal 
framework to protect the trade secret. 
Option B is incorrect. Random checks can deter some 
employees but might not be effective across the board and could 
also lead to trust issues within the organization. 
Option D is incorrect. While education is essential and can 
instill a sense of responsibility, it doesn’t provide a legal means 
to protect the trade secret as an NDA does. 
Question 257. A large e-commerce platform is facing 
challenges during peak sale periods, where the influx of users 
causes slowdowns and occasional outages. Which of the 
following solutions would BEST improve scalability during 
these high-demand times? 
(A)       Implement a centralized logging system 
(B)       Employ auto-scaling cloud solutions 
(C)       Increase the frequency of data backups 
(D)       Mandate regular security training for employees 
Explanation 257. Correct Answer: B. Employ auto-scaling 
cloud solutions. 
	
 
392

Auto-scaling in cloud solutions automatically adjusts the 
number of computational resources based on the actual demand. 
During peak periods, resources can be automatically increased 
to handle the demand, ensuring the system remains scalable and 
responsive. 
Option A is incorrect. A centralized logging system is 
beneficial for monitoring and troubleshooting, but it does not 
directly address scalability during peak times. 
Option C is incorrect. Increasing the frequency of data 
backups is a good practice for data integrity and recovery but 
does not handle scalability concerns directly. 
Option D is incorrect. Regular security training is crucial for a 
company’s cybersecurity posture, but it does not address the 
architectural scalability of the platform. 
Question 258. An e-commerce company is preparing for an 
upcoming Black Friday sale, expecting a surge in web traffic. 
To ensure their systems remain responsive during the sale, 
which of the following would be the MOST effective strategy to 
implement? 
(A)       Increasing password complexity for all users 
(B)       Limiting the number of products on sale 
(C)       Implementing a content delivery network (CDN) 
(D)       Conducting a yearly security audit 
Explanation 258. Correct Answer: C. Implementing a 
content delivery network (CDN). CDNs distribute the traffic 
load among multiple servers, often geographically dispersed. 
	
 
393

This not only speeds up content delivery to users but also helps 
in handling traffic surges, ensuring the system remains 
responsive during high-demand periods such as Black Friday 
sales. 
Option A is incorrect. Increasing password complexity can 
enhance security but does not directly impact system 
responsiveness during high traffic periods. 
Option B is incorrect. Limiting the number of products on sale 
may reduce server load, but it might also decrease potential 
revenue and is not a direct method for improving system 
responsiveness. 
Option D is incorrect. While yearly security audits are 
essential for identifying vulnerabilities, they don’t directly 
address system responsiveness during high traffic periods. 
Question 259. A multinational corporation has data centers 
located in different countries. Due to regulatory constraints, 
remote access to these data centers is highly restricted. The 
company’s IT administrators need a centralized way to access 
all data centers securely without directly accessing them from 
their workstations. Which solution should the company 
consider? 
(A)       Setting up a DMZ 
(B)       Implementing a Jump server 
(C)       Deploying an Active Directory 
(D)       Using a local Proxy 
	
 
394

Explanation 259. Correct Answer: B. Implementing a Jump 
server. A Jump server, also known as a bastion host, acts as an 
intermediary server allowing users to connect to it before 
accessing another server or network. It provides a controlled 
means of access between two networks, such as an internal 
network and an external network. 
Option A is incorrect. A DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) is a 
physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an 
organization’s external-facing services to an untrusted network, 
usually the internet. It doesn’t provide a consolidated access 
point like a Jump server. 
Option C is incorrect. Active Directory is a directory service 
for Windows domain networks. It’s not designed to provide 
controlled remote access to multiple data centers. 
Option D is incorrect. A local Proxy might be used to control 
internet access or cache web content but doesn’t act as a 
centralized access point for data centers like a Jump server. 
Question 260. Acme Corp is restructuring its internal network 
to improve its security posture. They aim to separate areas with 
different levels of trust. Which of the following approaches 
would BEST achieve this objective? 
(A)       Implementing VLANs based on organizational 
departments 
(B)       Setting up a perimeter firewall to segment external and 
internal traffic 
(C)       Designing network zones based on data sensitivity 
	
 
395

and access requirements 
(D)       Using a single, flat network for simplicity 
Explanation 260. Correct Answer: C. Designing network 
zones based on data sensitivity and access requirements. 
Zoning based on data sensitivity and access requirements 
ensures that segments of the network with varying trust levels 
are isolated. This reduces the risk of a breach in one zone 
affecting another. 
Option A is incorrect. While VLANs can segment traffic, 
doing so based purely on organizational departments may not 
align with varying trust and data sensitivity requirements. 
Option B is incorrect. While perimeter firewalls are crucial for 
security, they primarily separate internal from external traffic 
and don’t segment areas of varying trust within the internal 
network. 
Option D is incorrect. A single, flat network doesn’t provide 
segmentation, making it vulnerable to lateral movement if a 
threat actor gains access. 
Question 261. Your organization is implementing Infrastructure 
as Code (IaC) to deploy and manage its cloud infrastructure. As 
part of a security review, what is a primary concern regarding 
the use of IaC scripts? 
(A)       Lack of graphical interface for infrastructure 
visualization 
(B)       Hardcoding sensitive data within the scripts 
	
 
396

(C)       Inability to scale the infrastructure dynamically 
(D)       Incompatibility with non-cloud environments 
Explanation 261. Correct Answer: B. Hardcoding sensitive 
data within the scripts. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts are 
meant to automate infrastructure deployment. If sensitive data 
such as passwords or API keys are hardcoded into these scripts, 
they could be exposed, leading to potential security breaches. 
It’s essential to use secure methods, like secrets management or 
encrypted variables, to handle sensitive data. 
Option A is incorrect. While IaC focuses on code-driven 
infrastructure management, many tools provide ways to 
visualize the infrastructure or are compatible with tools that do. 
Option C is incorrect. One of the benefits of IaC is the ability 
to scale infrastructure dynamically. It allows for automated 
scaling based on the script or configuration files. 
Option D is incorrect. IaC can be used in various 
environments, not just cloud. It depends on the tool and the 
platform it supports. 
Question 262. A cloud-based SaaS company wants to ensure its 
infrastructure can handle a potential influx of a large number of 
users in the future. Which of the following approaches would 
BEST meet this scalability consideration? 
(A)       Implement a horizontal scaling strategy 
(B)       Introduce multi-factor authentication 
(C)       Deploy deep packet inspection tools 
(D)       Implement a centralized logging system 
	
 
397

Explanation 262. Correct Answer: A. Implement a 
horizontal scaling strategy. Horizontal scaling involves adding 
more machines or nodes to a system to handle increased load, 
which can be especially effective in a cloud environment. It 
allows the infrastructure to accommodate more users by 
distributing the load among multiple servers. 
Option B is incorrect. Multi-factor authentication is essential 
for security, but it does not address the scalability of the 
infrastructure to handle a large number of users. 
Option C is incorrect. Deep packet inspection tools are used 
for analyzing network traffic for security and management 
purposes, but they don’t directly enhance the scalability of an 
infrastructure. 
Option D is incorrect. Centralized logging systems help 
consolidate and analyze logs from various sources, but they do 
not address the scalability needs of the infrastructure itself. 
Question 263. A software development company is looking to 
migrate its legacy applications to a more modern infrastructure. 
They want to ensure the applications can be deployed 
consistently across multiple environments without the 
challenges of varying dependencies and configurations. Which 
approach would best achieve this goal? 
(A)       Virtual Machine Deployment 
(B)       Bare-Metal Deployment 
(C)       Containerization 
(D)       Serverless Computing 
	
 
398

Explanation 263. Correct Answer: C. Containerization 
Containerization encapsulates an application and its 
dependencies into a ‘container.’ This allows the application to 
be consistently deployed across different environments 
regardless of variations in configurations or dependencies. 
Option A is incorrect. While virtual machines provide an 
isolated environment for applications, they include the overhead 
of an entire guest OS and don’t directly address the challenge of 
application dependencies varying across environments. 
Option B is incorrect. Bare-metal deployment involves 
installing applications directly on hardware without 
virtualization or containers. This method does not inherently 
ensure consistent deployment across multiple environments. 
Option D is incorrect. Serverless computing abstracts the 
infrastructure away from the developer, focusing on individual 
functions. While it provides scalability and simplicity, it doesn’t 
directly address consistent deployment across environments due 
to dependencies and configurations. 
Question 264. A large enterprise is considering a transition to a 
more flexible and programmable network architecture. They 
want to centralize the control plane, allowing for automated, 
programmable network configurations and rapid provisioning. 
Which network architecture model should they consider? 
(A)       VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) 
(B)       MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) 
(C)       VPN (Virtual Private Network) 
(D)       SDN (Software-Defined Networking) 
	
 
399

Explanation 264. Correct Answer: D. SDN (Software-
Defined Networking). Software-Defined Networking (SDN) 
centralizes the control plane, decoupling it from the data plane. 
This allows for a more flexible and programmable network, 
enabling automated configurations, and rapid provisioning. 
Option A is incorrect. A VLAN is used to create logical 
networks within a physical network but doesn’t provide 
centralized control or programmability across the entire 
network. 
Option B is incorrect. MPLS is a type of data-carrying 
technique for high-performance telecommunications networks. 
It doesn’t centralize network control or enhance 
programmability as SDN does. 
Option C is incorrect. A VPN is designed to provide a secure 
tunnel between networks over potentially insecure mediums like 
the internet. It does not offer the centralized, programmable 
configuration benefits of SDN. 
Question 265. A global corporation has undergone several IT 
incidents in the past year, including outages due to natural 
disasters and cyber attacks. The CEO wants to ensure the 
organization’s IT infrastructure can withstand or rapidly recover 
from disruptive events. Which of the following best 
encapsulates this requirement? 
(A)       Adopting a Zero Trust Architecture 
(B)       Implementing a strict password policy 
(C)       Establishing a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) with 
	
 
400

emphasis on resilience 
(D)       Regularly updating firewall rules 
Explanation 265. Correct Answer: C. Establishing a 
Business Continuity Plan (BCP) with emphasis on resilience. 
Resilience in this context refers to the ability of the IT 
infrastructure to rapidly recover and continue functioning even 
after disruptive events. A Business Continuity Plan with a focus 
on resilience would help the organization prepare for, respond 
to, and recover from both natural and man-made incidents. 
Option A is incorrect. Zero Trust Architecture emphasizes not 
trusting any user or system, both inside and outside the 
perimeter, but it doesn’t address resilience against disruptive 
events directly. 
Option B is incorrect. While password policies are essential 
for security, they are not centered around ensuring resilience 
against disruptive events. 
Option D is incorrect. Updating firewall rules is crucial for 
keeping out unwanted traffic and potential threats but doesn’t 
directly address the resilience of an IT infrastructure against 
major disruptive events. 
Question 266. A medical company has recently deployed a 
device to monitor patient heart rates in real time. This device 
uses a real-time operating system (RTOS) to guarantee 
immediate response times. The security team is concerned about 
potential risks. Which of the following would be a KEY 
	
 
401

recommendation to enhance the security of such devices? 
(A)       Ensure real-time data analysis capabilities 
(B)       Integrate the device with the corporate cloud for 
backups 
(C)       Implement strict network segmentation for the 
device 
(D)       Increase the storage capacity of the device 
Explanation 266. Correct Answer: C. Implement strict 
network segmentation for the device. To protect RTOS 
devices, which often prioritize performance over security, it’s 
crucial to minimize their exposure to potential threats. By 
segmenting the network, you can isolate the device from other 
systems and reduce the risk of a security incident. 
Option A is incorrect. Real-time data analysis is more about 
performance and functionality than security. 
Option B is incorrect. Integrating the device with the corporate 
cloud could introduce more security concerns, especially if the 
cloud environment is not secured properly. 
Option D is incorrect. Storage capacity is a matter of device 
functionality, not a direct security enhancement for an RTOS 
device. 
Question 267. A small business wants to deploy a single 
network security device that can handle multiple security 
functions such as firewall protection, intrusion detection, anti-
malware, and content filtering. Which of the following would 
be the most suitable solution? 
	
 
402

(A)       Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) 
(B)       Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
(C)       Unified Threat Management (UTM) 
(D)       Proxy Server 
Explanation 267. Correct Answer: C. Unified Threat 
Management (UTM). Unified Threat Management (UTM) 
devices are designed to combine multiple security features into 
a single appliance. This makes them ideal for smaller 
organizations that require a comprehensive range of security 
functions but might not have the resources to deploy and 
manage multiple standalone devices. 
Option A is incorrect. While NIDS can identify and notify of 
potential malicious activities, it does not offer the 
comprehensive multi-feature capabilities found in a UTM. 
Option B is incorrect. A Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
specifically protects web applications from certain types of 
attacks like XSS and SQL injection. It does not encompass the 
broader range of security functions that a UTM does. 
Option D is incorrect. A Proxy Server primarily controls 
internet access and might provide some caching and content 
filtering capabilities, but it doesn’t offer the wide range of 
security functions that a UTM does. 
Question 268. An e-commerce company is experiencing attacks 
that specifically target the shopping cart feature of its web 
application. They want to implement a firewall that can 
understand web application-specific commands and provide 
	
 
403

protection. Which type of firewall should they consider? 
(A)       Layer 4 Firewall 
(B)       Layer 2 Firewall 
(C)       Layer 7 Firewall 
(D)       Packet Filtering Firewall 
Explanation 268. Correct Answer: C. Layer 7 Firewall. 
Layer 7 firewalls, often known as Application Layer firewalls, 
can understand and filter traffic based on application-specific 
data, commands, or functions. They operate at the highest layer 
in the OSI model and can make decisions based on the actual 
content of the traffic. 
Option A is incorrect. Layer 4 firewalls, also known as 
transport layer firewalls, primarily deal with data based on port 
numbers and protocol. They wouldn’t be as effective in filtering 
application-specific commands as a Layer 7 firewall. 
Option B is incorrect. Layer 2 firewalls operate at the data link 
layer, primarily dealing with MAC addresses. They aren’t 
equipped to analyze application-specific content. 
Option D is incorrect. Packet Filtering Firewalls operate 
primarily at the network layer, making decisions based on 
source/destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocol 
types, not application-specific content. 
Question 269. A financial organization’s high-security data 
center has an authentication system for its main entry. If the 
system encounters an unexpected error, the organization wants 
to ensure that no one can gain access to the data center until the 
	
 
404

system is fixed. Which configuration should the authentication 
system be set to? 
(A)       Fail-open 
(B)       Fail-closed 
(C)       Fail-secure 
(D)       Fail-passive 
Explanation 269. Correct Answer: B. Fail-closed. Fail-
closed, also known as fail-secure, is a mode where if a system 
fails, it denies all requests by default, effectively “closing” 
access. In high-security environments, it’s often preferred to 
prevent any unauthorized access during system failures. 
Option A is incorrect. Fail-open is the opposite of what the 
organization wants. In a fail-open scenario, if the system fails, it 
would allow all requests by default. 
Option C is incorrect. While “fail-secure” is another term for 
“fail-closed”, the use of both terms in the options can confuse 
the test-taker. In this context, option B is the more appropriate 
choice. 
Option D is incorrect. Fail-passive isn’t a standard term in the 
context of authentication failure modes. Fail-open and fail-
closed (or fail-secure) are the primary recognized terms. 
Question 270. A multinational company wants to allow its 
remote employees to securely access the corporate intranet over 
the Internet. The company’s primary concern is to ensure data 
confidentiality and integrity during transit. Which solution 
should the company implement? 
	
 
405

(A)       VLAN 
(B)       VPN 
(C)       NAC 
(D)       DMZ 
Explanation 270. Correct Answer: B. VPN. A Virtual Private 
Network (VPN) allows remote users to establish a secure 
connection to an organization’s internal network over the public 
internet. It encrypts the data in transit, ensuring both 
confidentiality and integrity. 
Option A is incorrect. A VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) 
is used to segment network traffic within a local network, but it 
does not provide encryption or a method for secure remote 
access. 
Option C is incorrect. NAC (Network Access Control) is a 
security solution that enforces policy on devices attempting to 
access network resources, but it doesn’t inherently provide 
encrypted communication over the internet. 
Option D is incorrect. DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) is a network 
segment that acts as a buffer between an organization’s internal 
network and untrusted external networks. It doesn’t provide 
encrypted communication for remote users. 
Question 271. After conducting a business impact analysis, a 
local library determined that they could afford several days of 
downtime without a significant impact on their operations. They 
want a disaster recovery solution that offers a balance between 
cost and recovery capabilities. Which site consideration is the 
	
 
406

most suitable for the library’s needs? 
(A)       Mobile site with a full set of IT equipment 
(B)       Hot site with daily data replication 
(C)       Cold site 
(D)       Warm site with weekly backups 
Explanation 271. Correct Answer: C. Cold site. A cold site is 
an offsite facility that is pre-configured to accept equipment and 
data backups but doesn’t have any of its own. Given the 
library’s tolerance for several days of downtime, a cold site 
would be a cost-effective solution that aligns with their recovery 
capabilities. 
Option A is incorrect. A mobile site with a full set of IT 
equipment would be more suitable for immediate recovery 
needs and might be overkill for a library that can tolerate 
several days of downtime. 
Option B is incorrect. A hot site with daily data replication 
would be more suited for businesses with a low tolerance for 
downtime and would likely be more expensive than the library’s 
budget allows. 
Option D is incorrect. Even though a warm site with weekly 
backups might seem like a viable option, a cold site would still 
be more cost-effective for the library given their tolerance for 
downtime. 
Question 272. An online payment gateway is evaluating 
methods to enhance the security of its payment processing 
system. They want a solution that replaces sensitive cardholder 
	
 
407

data with a unique identifier that has no intrinsic value by itself. 
Which method should they implement? 
(A)       Hashing the card data 
(B)       Encrypting the card data 
(C)       Masking the card data 
(D)       Tokenizing the card data 
Explanation 272. Correct Answer: D. Tokenizing the card 
data. Tokenization involves replacing sensitive data with a non-
sensitive equivalent, referred to as a token, that has no extrinsic 
or exploitable meaning or value. 
Option A is incorrect. Hashing would produce a fixed-size 
string, which cannot be reversed to its original value, but it 
doesn’t create a “token” that can be swapped back for the 
original data. 
Option B is incorrect. Encryption translates data into another 
form, or code, so that only people with access to a secret key or 
password can read it. It does not replace the data with a unique 
identifier with no intrinsic value. 
Option C is incorrect. Masking involves hiding parts of data, 
such as showing only the last four digits of a credit card 
number. It doesn’t replace the data with a unique identifier. 
Question 273. A software company is developing a new cloud-
based application where clients can store and manage their 
customer contact details. The stored data does not include 
financial or medical information but does contain phone 
numbers and email addresses. How should this information be 
	
 
408

classified? 
(A)       Public 
(B)       Restricted 
(C)       Sensitive 
(D)       Classified 
Explanation 273. Correct Answer: C. Sensitive. Phone 
numbers and email addresses are considered Personally 
Identifiable Information (PII) and should be classified as 
sensitive since unauthorized access could lead to privacy 
violations or misuse. 
Option A is incorrect. Public classification is for data that is 
intended for general access and holds no confidential 
information. 
Option B is incorrect. Restricted typically applies to data that 
is more confidential than sensitive data, such as financial or 
strategic data. 
Option D is incorrect. Classified is a more general term and 
can encompass various levels of data classification, including 
Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential, typically used in 
government sectors. 
Question 274. Cybertech Corp. is reviewing its backup 
protocols to enhance security. They decided that before 
transferring backups to an offsite location, the data should be 
rendered unreadable to unauthorized individuals. Which backup 
strategy will ensure this requirement is met? 
(A)       Use deduplication before storing backups 
	
 
409

(B)       Store backups in proprietary formats 
(C)       Encrypt backups before transfer 
(D)       Compress backups using standard tools 
Explanation 274. Correct Answer: C. Encrypt backups 
before transfer. Encryption transforms data into a format that 
can only be read by someone who possesses the decryption key. 
By encrypting backups before transferring, Cybertech Corp. 
ensures that even if unauthorized individuals access the backup 
data, they won’t be able to understand its contents. 
Option A is incorrect. Deduplication reduces the storage space 
required for backups by eliminating redundant data but doesn’t 
make data unreadable to unauthorized individuals. 
Option B is incorrect. Using proprietary formats may obscure 
the data for some unauthorized users, but it does not provide the 
robust protection encryption does. 
Option D is incorrect. Compressing backups using standard 
tools optimizes storage but does not ensure data confidentiality. 
Question 275. After a major power outage, TechWave Corp. 
wants to ensure their primary data center’s operations can be 
swiftly and seamlessly shifted to another facility. The company 
wants this process to be automated and immediate to prevent 
any service interruption. What type of test should TechWave 
Corp. conduct to validate this functionality? 
(A)       Conduct a vulnerability assessment on both data centers 
(B)       Execute a failover test 
	
 
410

(C)       Engage in a tabletop exercise 
(D)       Perform a routine backup test 
Explanation 275. Correct Answer: B. Execute a failover test. 
A failover test involves simulating a failure in the primary 
system to ensure that the backup system can seamlessly take 
over without any service interruption. It helps in verifying the 
resilience and recovery capabilities of an organization’s 
infrastructure. 
Option A is incorrect. A vulnerability assessment identifies 
potential weaknesses in systems but does not test the seamless 
transition between primary and backup systems. 
Option C is incorrect. A tabletop exercise is a discussion-based 
session and does not involve the live testing of systems or 
processes. 
Option D is incorrect. A routine backup test ensures that 
backups can be restored successfully but does not test the 
immediate switchover capability between systems. 
Question 276. A pharmaceutical company is working on a new 
drug formula that promises to revolutionize the treatment of a 
particular disease. The R&D team has detailed documentation 
on the components, procedures, and results of the drug trials. 
How should this documentation be classified to ensure that only 
the right people within the company have access? 
(A)       Unclassified 
(B)       Public 
	
 
411

(C)       Confidential 
(D)       Sensitive 
Explanation 276. Correct Answer: C. Confidential. This drug 
formula and its documentation represent valuable intellectual 
property for the pharmaceutical company. To protect against 
theft, corporate espionage, or accidental disclosure, it should be 
classified as confidential to ensure limited, controlled access. 
Option A is incorrect. Unclassified data doesn’t require any 
special protection or confidentiality and is inappropriate for 
valuable intellectual property. 
Option B is incorrect. Public classification would make the 
information accessible to everyone, which is not suitable for 
proprietary drug formulas. 
Option D is incorrect. While the drug formula is sensitive 
information, the “Confidential” classification offers stricter 
controls and is more suitable for such valuable intellectual 
property. 
Question 277. A software development company maintains a 
shared code repository. The company wants to ensure that only 
developers can make changes to the code, but testers should be 
able to view the code without modifying it. Which approach 
should be implemented? 
(A)       Assign all employees read-only permissions 
(B)       Provide testers with administrative rights 
(C)       Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) 
(D)       Use data encryption on the repository 
	
 
412

Explanation 277. Correct Answer: C. Implement role-based 
access controls (RBAC). RBAC assigns permissions based on 
roles within an organization. Developers can be given a role that 
allows them to modify code, while testers are given a role that 
only allows them to read the code. 
Option A is incorrect. Assigning read-only permissions to all 
employees will prevent developers from making necessary 
changes to the code. 
Option B is incorrect. Providing testers with administrative 
rights would give them more access than necessary, potentially 
allowing them to modify the code. 
Option D is incorrect. While data encryption ensures the 
confidentiality of the data, it does not address the need for 
specific permission levels for different user roles. 
Question 278. A software development company has just 
expanded its team and wants to ensure that in the event of a 
disaster, they can resume operations within a day. However, 
they have a limited budget for disaster recovery. Which of the 
following disaster recovery site types would be the most 
suitable for the company’s needs? 
(A)       Hot site with hourly data replication 
(B)       Cold site with monthly data backups 
(C)       Warm site with daily backups 
(D)       Offsite tape backups 
Explanation 278. Correct Answer: C. Warm site with daily 
backups. For the software development company’s need to 
	
 
413

resume operations within a day, a warm site with daily backups 
would be ideal. The warm site has equipment and some level of 
data ready, which would facilitate a faster recovery compared to 
a cold site or just offsite backups. 
Option A is incorrect. A hot site with hourly data replication 
might provide the quickest recovery, but it’s also the most 
expensive option which may not align with the company’s 
budget constraints. 
Option B is incorrect. A cold site with monthly data backups 
would be cost-effective but might not allow for operations to 
resume within a day due to the time needed to set up equipment 
and restore the latest data. 
Option D is incorrect. Offsite tape backups alone would not 
provide the infrastructure or equipment needed for quick 
recovery. It would also take considerable time to restore 
operations just from tape backups. 
Question 279. A financial institution wants to ensure that if a 
cyber attacker gains unauthorized access to one section of their 
network, the attacker cannot easily move laterally to more 
sensitive parts of the network. Which method can help achieve 
this objective? 
(A)       Deploying a honeypot in every segment 
(B)       Implementing network segmentation 
(C)       Applying encryption on all data traffic 
(D)       Enabling two-factor authentication for all users 
	
 
414

Explanation 279. Correct Answer: B. Implementing 
network segmentation. Network segmentation divides a 
network into multiple segments or subnets. Each segment 
operates independently and can have its own security and access 
controls. This means that if an attacker compromises one 
segment, they won’t necessarily have access to other segments. 
Option A is incorrect. A honeypot is a decoy system to attract 
potential attackers, but it doesn’t prevent lateral movement 
within the network once an attacker has access. 
Option C is incorrect. While encrypting data traffic ensures 
confidentiality, it doesn’t prevent lateral movement within the 
network. 
Option D is incorrect. Two-factor authentication strengthens 
access controls but doesn’t inherently stop lateral movement 
within a network if an attacker gains access. 
Question 280. DataFin, a financial analytics firm, experienced a 
minor fire incident in one of its server rooms. Fortunately, they 
had backups stored in another wing of the building, allowing for 
quick data recovery. However, management realizes that in a 
major disaster, both primary and backup data might be 
destroyed. To address this, which backup strategy should 
DataFin consider? 
(A)       Mirror Backup 
(B)       Local Storage Backup 
(C)       Incremental Backup 
(D)       Offsite Backup 
	
 
415

Explanation 280. Correct Answer: D. Offsite Backup. Offsite 
Backup involves storing backup data in a different geographical 
location from the primary data. This ensures that even if a 
disaster impacts the primary location, the backup remains safe 
and can be used for recovery. 
Option A is incorrect. Mirror Backup refers to a backup that is 
an exact copy of the source data. It doesn’t specify the 
geographic location of the backup. 
Option B is incorrect. Local Storage Backup typically means 
backups are stored within the same physical premises or close 
vicinity of the primary data, which wouldn’t address DataFin’s 
concern of potential data loss in a major disaster. 
Option C is incorrect. Incremental Backup involves backing 
up only the data that has changed since the last backup, 
regardless of where it’s stored. It doesn’t address the concern of 
geographic separation. 
Question 281. A healthcare organization with patients 
worldwide is planning to set up a backup site for its medical 
data repository. They have been advised to consider geographic 
dispersion as part of their disaster recovery plan. Which of the 
following reasons is the LEAST valid for geographic dispersion 
in this scenario? 
(A)       Mitigate risks of regional natural disasters 
(B)       Offer redundancy in case of local power outages 
(C)       Benefit from varying peak load times in different 
regions 
(D)       Ensure faster access speeds for global patients 
	
 
416

Explanation 281. Correct Answer: D. Ensure faster access 
speeds for global patients. Geographic dispersion’s primary 
goal in a disaster recovery context is resilience and redundancy, 
not necessarily optimizing access speeds. While having servers 
in different locations can enhance speed for local users, in the 
context of a backup site for disaster recovery, the primary focus 
is on availability and redundancy, not speed. 
Option A is incorrect. Geographic dispersion can help mitigate 
risks associated with regional natural disasters by ensuring that 
backup sites aren’t impacted by the same disaster that affects 
the primary site. 
Option B is incorrect. Regional power outages can be 
mitigated by having backup sites in different locations. 
Option C is incorrect. Geographic dispersion can allow 
organizations to manage and distribute load more effectively by 
leveraging off-peak times in different regions. 
Question 282. A multinational corporation is expanding its 
operations in various countries. The company has decided to 
restrict access to its internal network based on geolocation to 
ensure that only employees from specific countries can access 
certain data. Which of the following would be the MOST 
appropriate solution to implement this requirement? 
(A)       Deploy a VPN with multi-factor authentication 
(B)       Use MAC address filtering on all company devices 
(C)       Implement a geolocation-based access control system 
(D)       Set up region-specific SSIDs for the company's Wi-Fi 
network 
	
 
417

Explanation 282. Correct Answer: C. Implement a 
geolocation-based access control system. Geolocation-based 
access control systems determine users’ physical locations and 
can grant or deny access based on predefined geographic 
boundaries. This solution is most fitting for restricting access 
based on country-specific requirements. 
Option A is incorrect. While a VPN with multi-factor 
authentication improves security, it doesn’t inherently restrict 
access based on geolocation. 
Option B is incorrect. MAC address filtering restricts access 
based on device hardware addresses and not on geolocation. 
Option D is incorrect. Region-specific SSIDs might limit Wi-
Fi access in certain areas, but they don’t enforce geolocation-
based restrictions on a broader scale. 
Question 283. DigitalFront, an e-commerce company, is 
expecting a surge in traffic during their upcoming annual sale 
event. They want to ensure that their website and applications 
can handle the anticipated increase in user activity without any 
performance degradation. Which of the following steps is 
MOST relevant to achieving this goal? 
(A)       Increasing the frequency of security audits 
(B)       Implementing capacity planning specifically focused 
on technology 
(C)       Adopting multi-factor authentication for all users 
(D)       Investing in advanced threat intelligence solutions 
	
 
418

Explanation 283. Correct Answer: B. Implementing 
capacity planning specifically focused on technology. 
Capacity planning with a focus on technology ensures that all 
technological resources, such as servers, bandwidth, storage, 
and software, are adequately prepared to handle the expected 
increase in load or traffic, ensuring smooth performance during 
peak periods. 
Option A is incorrect. Security audits are important for 
identifying vulnerabilities, but they don’t address the direct 
need for scaling technology resources to manage increased 
traffic. 
Option C is incorrect. Multi-factor authentication improves 
security for users but does not aid in handling a surge in website 
traffic or user activity. 
Option D is incorrect. Advanced threat intelligence solutions 
provide insights into potential threats, but they don’t address 
technology scaling to accommodate increased traffic. 
Question 284. DeltaTech, a financial institution, operates its 
primary site on a UNIX-based platform. For disaster recovery 
purposes, they are considering setting up a backup site on a 
different platform. Which of the following is NOT a primary 
benefit of introducing platform diversity in this case? 
(A)       It reduces the organization's learning curve by using 
familiar technologies 
(B)       It provides resilience against attacks targeting UNIX-
based systems 
(C)       It ensures that platform-specific outages don't affect 
	
 
419

both primary and backup sites 
(D)       It diversifies the attack surface, reducing the impact of 
specific platform vulnerabilities 
Explanation 284. Correct Answer: A. It reduces the 
organization’s learning curve by using familiar technologies. 
Introducing a new platform usually increases the learning curve 
as staff need to be trained on the new system. The primary 
benefits of platform diversity are resilience, redundancy, and 
diversifying the attack surface. 
Option B is incorrect. This is one of the benefits of platform 
diversity. If a vulnerability or threat targets UNIX-based 
systems, having a backup on a different platform ensures that 
the backup isn’t compromised by the same threat. 
Option C is incorrect. This is a benefit of platform diversity. 
Platform-specific outages or issues would only affect systems 
on that platform, so having a backup on a different platform 
adds resilience. 
Option D is incorrect. This is one of the benefits of platform 
diversity. By using different platforms, the organization reduces 
the risk associated with vulnerabilities specific to a single 
platform. 
Question 285. After a recent system upgrade, CloudTech Corp. 
decided to validate the efficiency and reliability of its new data 
processing system. To do this, they run the new system 
alongside the old one and compare the outcomes. This way, they 
aim to ensure that the new system is both robust and capable of 
	
 
420

handling the current workload. What kind of testing is 
CloudTech Corp. utilizing? 
(A)       Load Testing 
(B)       Failover Testing 
(C)       Parallel Processing Testing 
(D)       Simulation Testing 
Explanation 285. Correct Answer: C. Parallel Processing 
Testing. Parallel Processing Testing involves running two 
systems simultaneously (typically the new one and the old one) 
to compare the outcomes. This kind of testing ensures that a 
new system is as effective and reliable as the previous one. 
Option A is incorrect. Load Testing checks the system’s ability 
to handle the expected volume of transactions and to see if it 
can maintain acceptable response times. 
Option B is incorrect. Failover Testing is done to ensure that a 
system can switch to a backup or secondary system in the case 
of a failure, rather than comparing two systems for consistency. 
Option D is incorrect. Simulation Testing involves creating a 
model of the system under test and stimulating it with virtual 
users or devices to understand its behavior under various 
conditions. 
Question 286. TechSolutions Inc., a rapidly growing startup, is 
expanding its workforce to meet its customer demands. As part 
of this expansion, they need to ensure their IT infrastructure can 
accommodate the influx of new employees without 
compromising performance or security. Which of the following 
	
 
421

should be TechSolutions’ primary focus during this expansion 
phase? 
(A)       Adopting a Zero Trust Network Architecture 
(B)       Increasing the frequency of vulnerability assessments 
(C)       Implementing capacity planning 
(D)       Deploying additional firewalls and intrusion detection 
systems 
Explanation 286. Correct Answer: C. Implementing 
capacity planning. Capacity planning ensures that an 
organization’s infrastructure, technology, and people are scaled 
appropriately to meet growth and performance needs. In the 
scenario, with an influx of new employees, ensuring that the IT 
infrastructure can handle the increased demand is crucial. 
Option A is incorrect. While adopting a Zero Trust Network 
Architecture might enhance security, it doesn’t address the need 
to scale resources to accommodate new employees. 
Option B is incorrect. Vulnerability assessments are crucial for 
security, but they don’t directly address the infrastructure’s 
ability to handle growth. 
Option D is incorrect. While firewalls and IDS can improve 
security, they don’t directly address the organization’s capacity 
to handle more employees 
Question 287. StreamNet, a popular online streaming service, is 
planning to launch in three new countries. They anticipate a 
substantial increase in users and concurrent streams. To ensure 
that the service remains uninterrupted and provides a seamless 
	
 
422

experience to new users, which action related to capacity 
planning should StreamNet prioritize? 
(A)       Investing in content encryption and DRM 
(B)       Increasing marketing and promotional activities in the 
new countries 
(C)       Implementing stronger user authentication methods 
(D)       Expanding and optimizing their infrastructure to 
handle the projected growth 
Explanation 287. Correct Answer: D. Expanding and 
optimizing their infrastructure to handle the projected 
growth. Infrastructure capacity planning will allow StreamNet 
to predict the necessary resources required and make the needed 
upgrades or adjustments to their servers, networks, storage, and 
other infrastructure components. This ensures a smooth user 
experience even with the influx of new users. 
Option A is incorrect. While content encryption and DRM 
(Digital Rights Management) are essential for protecting 
content, they don’t address the infrastructure capacity needed to 
handle more users. 
Option B is incorrect. Marketing and promotional activities 
can attract users but don’t directly impact the infrastructure’s 
capacity to support those users. 
Option C is incorrect. Stronger authentication methods can 
improve security but don’t address the capacity or scalability of 
the infrastructure. 
	
 
423

Question 288. GlobalTech is implementing a disaster recovery 
plan and wants to ensure continuous availability with no data 
loss. They have decided to use replication as a backup strategy. 
Which of the following replication techniques should 
GlobalTech implement to achieve their objective? 
(A)       Periodic replication scheduled daily 
(B)       Asynchronous replication with hourly synchronization 
(C)       Synchronous replication 
(D)       Snapshot replication every 30 minutes 
Explanation 288. Correct Answer: C. Synchronous 
replication. Synchronous replication ensures that data is written 
to the primary and secondary locations simultaneously, ensuring 
no data loss and continuous availability. This method is suitable 
for GlobalTech’s requirement of no data loss. 
Option A is incorrect. Periodic replication scheduled daily 
could result in up to a day’s worth of data loss in the event of a 
disaster. 
Option B is incorrect. Asynchronous replication with hourly 
synchronization could lead to an hour’s worth of data loss if an 
incident occurs just before synchronization. 
Option D is incorrect. Snapshot replication every 30 minutes 
could result in 30 minutes of data loss in the event of an 
incident. 
Question 289. A software company has developed a new 
product. They want to release a user manual that details how to 
use the software, its features, and basic troubleshooting steps. 
	
 
424

What should be the classification of this user manual? 
(A)       Confidential 
(B)       Restricted 
(C)       Public 
(D)       Internal 
Explanation 289. Correct Answer: C. Public. A user manual 
is intended for all users of the software and should be easily 
accessible. It doesn’t contain sensitive or proprietary 
information about the software’s underlying code or algorithms. 
Hence, it should be classified as “Public.” 
Option A is incorrect. “Confidential” classification is too 
restrictive for a document meant to be distributed with every 
software copy and to guide users. 
Option B is incorrect. “Restricted” would limit the distribution 
of the manual unnecessarily, making it harder for users to access 
the information they need. 
Option D is incorrect. “Internal” classification would suggest 
the manual is only for internal company use, whereas it’s 
intended for all users of the software. 
Question 290. A global finance firm has recently faced 
downtime due to unexpected disasters in its main operational 
region. The firm wishes to have a backup site that would allow 
them to continue their operations with minimal downtime and 
no data loss. Which type of backup site would be the most 
appropriate for the firm? 
(A)       Cold site 
	
 
425

(B)       Warm site 
(C)       Hot site 
(D)       Mobile site 
Explanation 290. Correct Answer: C. Hot site. A hot site is a 
fully operational offsite data center configured and ready to 
continue operations immediately after a disaster. It has all the 
necessary equipment and up-to-date data backups, making it 
ideal for scenarios where minimal downtime and no data loss 
are essential. 
Option A is incorrect. A cold site is a backup facility with 
space and infrastructure but without updated equipment or data. 
It requires time to set up and is not suitable for immediate 
recovery. 
Option B is incorrect. A warm site is a middle ground between 
a cold and hot site. It has some equipment and backups but will 
require more time to get fully operational compared to a hot 
site. 
Option D is incorrect. A mobile site is usually a portable setup, 
often on a truck, that can be deployed to various locations. It 
might not be equipped for large-scale operations like a global 
finance firm would require. 
Question 291. An international bank is setting up a new online 
portal for its customers to access their financial statements. 
Which measure should the bank implement to ensure that 
financial data in transit between the customer’s browser and the 
bank’s servers is kept confidential? 
	
 
426

(A)       Use file-level encryption for all financial statements 
(B)       Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
(C)       Use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer 
Security (TLS) for the portal 
(D)       Store all financial data in an encrypted database 
Explanation 291. Correct Answer: C. Use Secure Sockets 
Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) for the 
portal. SSL/TLS is designed to secure data in transit. By 
encrypting the data between the customer’s browser and the 
bank’s servers, it ensures the data’s confidentiality while in 
transit. 
Option A is incorrect. File-level encryption is great for data at 
rest but doesn’t secure data in transit between a client and 
server. 
Option B is incorrect. While a WAF can provide protection 
against web application attacks, it does not inherently encrypt 
data in transit. 
Option D is incorrect. Storing financial data in an encrypted 
database safeguards the data at rest but doesn’t ensure the 
confidentiality of data in transit to the client. 
Question 292. A global e-commerce website wants to allow its 
customer service representatives to assist clients with order 
issues without exposing the full credit card details of the clients. 
Which method should the IT department employ to achieve 
this? 
(A)       Replace all digits of the credit card number with random 
	
 
427

characters 
(B)       Display only the last four digits of the credit card 
number while masking the rest 
(C)       Encrypt the credit card number with a symmetric key 
(D)       Use a hash function to represent the credit card number 
Explanation 292. Correct Answer: B. Display only the last 
four digits of the credit card number while masking the rest. 
Displaying only the last four digits and masking the rest ensures 
that customer service representatives have enough information 
to assist customers without being exposed to the entire credit 
card number. 
Option A is incorrect. Replacing all digits with random 
characters would render the information useless for customer 
service representatives as they would not have any reference 
point. 
Option C is incorrect. Encrypting the card number can protect 
the data, but the customer service representatives would need a 
way to decrypt it to access even partial information, defeating 
the purpose of not exposing them to the full details. 
Option D is incorrect. Hashing the number would not allow 
any portion of the original data, like the last four digits, to be 
viewed, making it ineffective for this use case. 
Question 293. XYZ Corp recently faced a ransomware attack 
that encrypted critical data files. The company’s IT team was 
unable to decrypt the files but had a recent backup available. 
However, when they tried to restore the data, they found out the 
	
 
428

backup was corrupted. Which of the following best practices 
would have helped XYZ Corp in ensuring the integrity of their 
backups? 
(A)       Regularly testing backup restoration processes 
(B)       Storing backups in the same directory as original files 
(C)       Increasing the frequency of backups to every hour 
(D)       Encrypting backups with a strong encryption algorithm 
Explanation 293. Correct Answer: A. Regularly testing 
backup restoration processes. By regularly testing the 
restoration process from backups, organizations can identify and 
correct any issues with the backup files or processes before they 
are needed in a critical recovery situation. 
Option B is incorrect. Storing backups in the same directory as 
the original files increases the risk of both the original and 
backup files being compromised or corrupted simultaneously. 
Option C is incorrect. While increasing the frequency of 
backups can reduce data loss, it doesn’t address the integrity or 
validity of the backups themselves. 
Option D is incorrect. While encrypting backups provides 
security against unauthorized access, it doesn’t ensure the 
integrity or usability of the backup. 
Question 294. A financial institution is updating its 
infrastructure to ensure that customer financial data is kept 
secure from both internal and external threats. Which of the 
following would be the MOST effective measure to protect 
customer financial data from being accessed by unauthorized 
	
 
429

internal users? 
(A)       Deploying perimeter firewalls around the institution's 
network 
(B)       Implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) for all 
customer accounts 
(C)       Enforcing strict access controls based on the 
principle of least privilege 
(D)       Conducting yearly cybersecurity awareness training for 
all employees 
Explanation 294. Correct Answer: C. Enforcing strict access 
controls based on the principle of least privilege. The 
principle of least privilege (PoLP) ensures that users are given 
only the permissions they need to perform their job functions, 
nothing more. By enforcing strict access controls using this 
principle, the financial institution can minimize the risk of 
unauthorized internal users accessing sensitive financial data. 
Option A is incorrect. Perimeter firewalls are more focused on 
preventing external threats and don’t specifically address 
unauthorized internal access. 
Option B is incorrect. Implementing 2FA is primarily for 
authenticating users and doesn’t prevent unauthorized internal 
users from accessing data if they are already authenticated. 
Option D is incorrect. While cybersecurity awareness training 
is crucial, it’s not the most effective specific measure to prevent 
unauthorized internal access to financial data. 
	
 
430

Question 295. A company’s proprietary algorithm is being 
targeted by competitors aiming to replicate its functionality. To 
safeguard its intellectual property without changing the 
algorithm’s behavior, the company wants a method that 
disguises the original code structure. What should they 
implement? 
(A)       Data masking on the algorithm’s output 
(B)       Obfuscation on the algorithm's code 
(C)       Encryption of the algorithm's storage location 
(D)       Implementing a hashing mechanism within the 
algorithm 
Explanation 295. Correct Answer: B. Obfuscation on the 
algorithm’s code. Obfuscating the algorithm’s code will make 
it more challenging to understand, reverse engineer, or replicate, 
without altering its behavior or results. 
Option A is incorrect. Data masking on the algorithm’s output 
would only hide or change certain parts of the output. It doesn’t 
protect or disguise the algorithm’s actual code or logic. 
Option C is incorrect. Encrypting the algorithm’s storage 
location protects the stored data from unauthorized access, but 
once accessed (e.g., for legitimate use), the original code 
structure would still be visible. 
Option D is incorrect. Implementing a hashing mechanism 
within the algorithm might change its behavior and doesn’t 
obscure the algorithm’s logic or structure. 
	
 
431

Question 296. A multinational e-commerce company is 
expanding its infrastructure to handle increasing traffic. The 
primary goal is to distribute the incoming web traffic across 
multiple servers to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed. 
Which method should the company use? 
(A)       Deploy a web application firewall 
(B)       Implement server clustering 
(C)       Use hardware-based firewalls 
(D)       Set up a load balancer 
Explanation 296. Correct Answer: D. Set up a load balancer. 
Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple 
servers to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed, which 
enhances the availability and fault tolerance of applications. 
Option A is incorrect. While a web application firewall can 
protect against web-based threats, it doesn’t distribute incoming 
traffic across servers. 
Option B is incorrect. Server clustering primarily focuses on 
providing redundancy and failover capabilities rather than 
distributing incoming traffic. 
Option C is incorrect. Hardware-based firewalls are primarily 
used to filter traffic and protect networks from external threats, 
not to distribute incoming web traffic. 
Question 297. A law firm is transitioning to a digital storage 
system and wants to ensure that client records and case files are 
protected from unauthorized access. Which of the following 
would be the BEST strategy to ensure the confidentiality of 
	
 
432

legal information stored digitally? 
(A)       Conducting regular penetration testing on the digital 
storage system 
(B)       Encrypting the client records and case files 
(C)       Applying watermarks to digital documents 
(D)       Limiting physical access to the server room 
Explanation 297. Correct Answer: B. Encrypting the client 
records and case files. Encryption is the process of converting 
information into an unreadable format unless one has the 
appropriate decryption key. By encrypting legal documents, 
unauthorized individuals, even if they gain access to the storage 
system, won’t be able to comprehend the content of the 
documents. 
Option A is incorrect. While regular penetration testing is 
essential to identify vulnerabilities in a system, it does not 
directly protect the confidentiality of stored legal information. 
Option C is incorrect. Watermarking documents can deter 
copying or unauthorized distribution, but it doesn’t prevent 
unauthorized access or reading of the documents. 
Option D is incorrect. Limiting physical access to the server 
room can prevent unauthorized physical access, but it does not 
safeguard against digital breaches or protect the content of the 
files. 
Question 298. A healthcare provider stores vast amounts of 
patient data on its servers. While they have strong perimeter 
defenses, they want an additional layer of security to ensure 
	
 
433

patient data remains confidential even in the event of 
unauthorized access. Which of the following would be the 
MOST effective solution for this requirement? 
(A)       Use hash algorithms on all patient data 
(B)       Implement data deduplication techniques 
(C)       Encrypt the stored patient data 
(D)       Use a web application firewall (WAF) 
Explanation 298. Correct Answer: C. Encrypt the stored 
patient data. Encrypting patient data ensures that even if 
malicious actors gain access to the data, they won’t be able to 
understand or utilize it without the proper decryption key. 
Option A is incorrect. Hashing is primarily used for verifying 
data integrity or storing passwords securely. Hashing would not 
allow the healthcare provider to retrieve and use the patient data 
when needed. 
Option B is incorrect. Data deduplication is about reducing 
storage requirements by removing duplicate data; it doesn’t 
provide confidentiality. 
Option D is incorrect. While a WAF provides protection 
against web-based threats, it doesn’t ensure the confidentiality 
of stored data in the event of unauthorized access. 
Question 299. After a major outage, CloudTech Services is 
reviewing their disaster recovery strategy. The company found 
out that after restoring from backup, several applications did not 
function properly due to configuration discrepancies. What 
would be the best approach to ensure a successful recovery in 
	
 
434

the future? 
(A)       Prioritize applications for backup based on their 
importance 
(B)       Implement differential backups in addition to full 
backups 
(C)       Regularly conduct a full system recovery in a test 
environment 
(D)       Use a third-party backup solution instead of an in-house 
solution 
Explanation 299. Correct Answer: C. Regularly conduct a 
full system recovery in a test environment. By conducting a 
full system recovery in a test environment, CloudTech can 
simulate a real-world recovery scenario. This helps in 
identifying any discrepancies, configuration issues, or 
application dependencies that might be missed during regular 
backups, ensuring a successful recovery when it’s critically 
needed. 
Option A is incorrect. Prioritizing applications for backup 
based on their importance doesn’t address the configuration 
discrepancies or interdependencies between applications. 
Option B is incorrect. Implementing differential backups, 
while beneficial in capturing changes, does not address the 
configuration discrepancies found during the recovery. 
Option D is incorrect. Using a third-party solution instead of 
an in-house solution does not inherently guarantee a successful 
recovery or address the specific issue of configuration 
discrepancies.

Question 300. A financial institution is implementing a system 
where customers can verify the integrity of their monthly 
statements without having access to the original data. Which of 
the following techniques would be MOST appropriate for this 
task? 
(A)       Encrypting the statements using AES 
(B)       Compressing the statements to reduce file size 
(C)       Hashing the statements and providing the hash value 
to the customers 
(D)       Tokenizing sensitive data within the statements 
Explanation 300. Correct Answer: C. Hashing the 
statements and providing the hash value to the customers. 
Hashing can be used to ensure data integrity. Customers can 
hash the statement they receive and compare it with the 
provided hash value to verify that the data hasn’t been altered. 
Option A is incorrect. While AES is a strong encryption 
method, encrypting the statements won’t allow customers to 
verify the integrity of their statements. It ensures confidentiality 
more than integrity. 
Option B is incorrect. Compressing the statements merely 
reduces the file size for ease of storage or transmission; it 
doesn’t help in verifying data integrity. 
Option D is incorrect. Tokenization replaces sensitive data 
with non-sensitive placeholders. It doesn’t offer a way to verify 
the integrity of the entire statement. 
	
 
436

Question 301. An organization has decided to focus on securing 
its database servers where customer details and transaction 
records are stored. This data is not being actively accessed or 
processed. Which type of security measure would be MOST 
appropriate for this type of data? 
(A)       VLData Loss Prevention (DLP) for emailAN 
(B)       Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
(C)       Full Disk Encryption (FDE) 
(D)       Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for network traffic 
Explanation 301. Correct Answer: C. Full Disk Encryption 
(FDE). Data at rest refers to data that is not actively moving 
through the network, such as data stored on hard drives. Full 
Disk Encryption (FDE) is a security measure specifically 
designed to protect data at rest by encrypting the entire hard 
drive. 
Option A is incorrect. DLP for email primarily focuses on 
preventing unauthorized data transfers via email and is more 
suited for data in transit rather than data at rest. 
Option B is incorrect. WAF protects web applications from 
various online threats and is not specifically tailored to protect 
data at rest. 
Option D is incorrect. An IDS for network traffic mainly 
focuses on monitoring and detecting malicious activity in 
network traffic, which pertains to data in transit and not data at 
rest.

Question 302. A multinational company is considering using a 
cloud storage provider based in a foreign country to store 
customer data. The company’s home country has strict data 
protection laws that require customer data to remain within its 
borders. Which of the following considerations is MOST 
critical for the company when choosing the cloud storage 
provider? 
(A)       The speed of data access from the foreign-based cloud 
storage 
(B)       The encryption standards used by the foreign cloud 
provider 
(C)       Whether the foreign cloud provider offers data 
storage exclusively within the company's home country 
(D)       The reputation and customer reviews of the foreign 
cloud provider 
Explanation 302. Correct Answer: C. Whether the foreign 
cloud provider offers data storage exclusively within the 
company’s home country. Data sovereignty refers to the 
concept that digital data is subject to the laws of the country in 
which it is located. If a company’s home country has regulations 
that require customer data to stay within its borders, it’s 
essential to ensure that the cloud provider offers storage that 
complies with this requirement. 
Option A is incorrect. While speed of data access is important, 
it doesn’t address the data sovereignty concern. 
Option B is incorrect. While encryption is essential for 
security, it doesn’t guarantee compliance with data sovereignty 
laws. 
	
 
438

Option D is incorrect. Reputation is important, but it doesn’t 
directly address the specific requirement of data sovereignty. 
Question 303. After an annual review, BestTech Co. realized 
that their IT team was unfamiliar with the protocols to follow 
during a data breach. To ensure the team understands the steps 
and decision points without launching a live drill, what should 
the company implement? 
(A)       Upgrade their firewall systems 
(B)       Engage in a tabletop exercise 
(C)       Conduct a red team exercise 
(D)       Implement multi-factor authentication for all users 
Explanation 303. Correct Answer: B. Engage in a tabletop 
exercise. Tabletop exercises allow teams to discuss and review 
specific scenarios, such as a data breach, and ensure everyone 
understands their roles and the processes to follow. It’s a cost-
effective way to familiarize the team with response procedures. 
Option A is incorrect. Upgrading firewall systems may 
enhance the company’s security posture but doesn’t familiarize 
the IT team with data breach response protocols. 
Option C is incorrect. A red team exercise is a live simulated 
attack to evaluate the organization’s security posture and does 
not focus on walking the team through the response steps in a 
controlled environment. 
Option D is incorrect. Multi-factor authentication is a security 
measure to validate users’ identities but does not address the 
team’s unfamiliarity with data breach response protocols.

Question 304. SecureData Inc., a financial firm, recently 
experienced a system crash and needed to restore their database. 
While they had a full backup from the previous week, they 
realized that several days of transactions were missing. To 
prevent such data loss in the future, which backup strategy 
involving recording transactions can SecureData implement? 
(A)       Implement differential backups 
(B)       Use snapshot backups every hour 
(C)       Enable database journaling 
(D)       Configure RAID 5 for their storage 
Explanation 304. Correct Answer: C. Enable database 
journaling. Journaling involves keeping a log or ‘journal’ of 
every transaction or change that happens. If there’s a crash, the 
system can be restored to the last backup and then use the 
journal to replay each transaction, thus preventing data loss. 
Option A is incorrect. Differential backups capture changes 
since the last full backup, but they don’t record every 
transaction in real-time like journaling. 
Option B is incorrect. While hourly snapshot backups would 
reduce the potential data loss window, they still don’t capture 
every transaction in real-time. 
Option D is incorrect. RAID 5 offers redundancy and can 
protect against a disk failure, but it doesn’t capture and record 
every database transaction like journaling. 
Question 305. SecureNet Inc. recently upgraded their security 
infrastructure. To validate how the new system would respond 
	
 
440

in real-world scenarios without exposing it to actual risks, they 
decide to imitate certain cyber threats in a controlled 
environment. Which type of test is SecureNet Inc. planning to 
conduct? 
(A)       Penetration Testing 
(B)       Simulation Testing 
(C)       Vulnerability Assessment 
(D)       Failover Testing. 
Explanation 305. Correct Answer: B. Simulation Testing. 
Simulation testing involves creating a model of the system 
under test and then stimulating it with virtual users or devices to 
understand its behavior under various conditions. In the context 
of cybersecurity, this means imitating cyber threats in a 
controlled environment to assess how security infrastructure 
responds. 
Option A is incorrect. Penetration Testing involves ethical 
hackers attempting to breach an organization’s defenses, which 
involves actual risks, rather than just a simulation. 
Option C is incorrect. A Vulnerability Assessment identifies, 
quantifies, and prioritizes vulnerabilities in a system but doesn’t 
necessarily imitate threats in a controlled environment. 
Option D is incorrect. Failover Testing ensures that a system 
can switch to a backup or secondary system in case of a failure, 
and does not focus on simulating threats. 
Question 306. ZenTech, a multinational corporation, recently 
adopted a multi-cloud strategy, deploying workloads across 
	
 
441

multiple cloud service providers. What is a primary security 
benefit of this approach? 
(A)       Centralized management of all cloud resources 
(B)       Automatic encryption of data in transit between clouds 
(C)       Mitigation against a single point of failure 
(D)       Reduction in the cost of cloud storage solutions 
Explanation 306. Correct Answer: C. Mitigation against a 
single point of failure. Using a multi-cloud strategy distributes 
workloads across various cloud providers, which reduces the 
risk associated with outages or security breaches in any one 
provider. This diversification ensures that a failure or 
compromise in one cloud environment doesn’t jeopardize the 
entire infrastructure. 
Option A is incorrect. Multi-cloud strategies can sometimes 
complicate management due to the need to interface with 
different platforms and providers. Centralization isn’t the 
primary benefit in this context. 
Option B is incorrect. While encryption is crucial, adopting a 
multi-cloud approach doesn’t automatically encrypt data in 
transit between different cloud environments. This would 
require specific configurations and solutions. 
Option D is incorrect. While cost optimization can be a factor 
in adopting a multi-cloud strategy, the primary security 
advantage is not related to cost reduction. 
Question 307. GlobalBank has implemented a backup strategy 
where only the changes made since the last full backup are 
	
 
442

recorded. Considering the need to optimize storage and reduce 
backup times, the IT team performs this type of backup every 
day. What backup frequency and type is GlobalBank utilizing? 
(A)       Incremental Backup daily 
(B)       Differential Backup weekly 
(C)       Full Backup bi-weekly 
(D)       Snapshot Backup daily 
Explanation 307. Correct Answer: A. Incremental Backup 
daily. GlobalBank captures only the changes made since the last 
full backup, which is characteristic of incremental backups. 
Furthermore, they perform this type of backup every day, 
indicating a daily frequency. 
Option B is incorrect. Differential backups capture the changes 
made since the last full backup but would cumulatively grow in 
size each time until the next full backup, unlike the incremental 
which resets with each backup. 
Option C is incorrect. A full backup would involve backing up 
all the data, regardless of changes, and the scenario does not 
mention a bi-weekly frequency. 
Option D is incorrect. Snapshot backups capture the state of a 
system at a particular point in time, but the scenario specifically 
mentions capturing changes since the last full backup. 
Question 308. A defense contractor is working on a new missile 
system. While the detailed schematics and operational details 
are classified, they have an overview document that only a 
select group of partners and stakeholders can view. How should 
	
 
443

this overview document be classified? 
(A)       Public 
(B)       Restricted 
(C)       Confidential 
(D)       Top Secret 
Explanation 308. Correct Answer: B. Restricted. 
“Restricted” classification is used when access to the document 
or data needs to be limited to a particular group of individuals. 
In this scenario, only a select group of partners and stakeholders 
are allowed to view the overview document, making 
“Restricted” the most appropriate classification. 
Option A is incorrect. “Public” classification would allow 
anyone to access the document, which is not suitable for this 
scenario. 
Option C is incorrect. While “Confidential” classification 
would provide a level of protection, it doesn’t specifically 
restrict access to a defined group as “Restricted” does. 
Option D is incorrect. “Top Secret” is a high-level 
classification that would be more appropriate for the detailed 
schematics and operational details rather than an overview 
document. 
Question 309. A tech startup is developing a mobile application 
that offers exclusive content only to users within a specific 
country due to licensing agreements. Which method should the 
startup use to ensure that only users within that country can 
access the content? 
	
 
444

(A)       Integrate a time-based one-time password (TOTP) 
system 
(B)       Use geolocation-based access controls 
(C)       Enable biometric authentication 
(D)       Implement IP whitelisting 
Explanation 309. Correct Answer: B. Use geolocation-based 
access controls. Geolocation-based access controls can identify 
a user’s geographic location and allow or deny access based on 
predefined geographic boundaries, making it the most suitable 
solution for the startup’s requirement. 
Option A is incorrect. TOTP systems provide a second factor 
of authentication based on time, not geographic location. 
Option C is incorrect. Biometric authentication verifies the 
identity of a user based on physical or behavioral characteristics 
but does not restrict access based on geography. 
Option D is incorrect. IP whitelisting allows access only to 
specific IP addresses. While it can offer a level of geographic 
restriction, it’s not as precise as geolocation-based controls and 
may inadvertently block or allow users. 
Question 310. MetroTech recently experienced an incident 
where an employee mistakenly deleted a portion of their 
database. The IT team was able to restore the data using a 
backup snapshot taken 24 hours prior. However, some data loss 
still occurred. Which of the following recommendations would 
minimize data loss in a similar situation in the future? 
(A)       Configure backup snapshots to be taken on a weekly 
	
 
445

basis 
(B)       Employ a differential backup solution in addition to 
snapshots 
(C)       Increase the storage capacity for backups 
(D)       Use an hourly snapshot backup schedule 
Explanation 310. Correct Answer: D. Use an hourly 
snapshot backup schedule. Increasing the frequency of 
snapshot backups, such as taking them every hour, will ensure 
that the maximum amount of data that can be lost is limited to 
that hour’s worth. This minimizes the potential for data loss 
compared to a 24-hour window. 
Option A is incorrect. Taking weekly snapshots would actually 
increase the potential data loss window, not decrease it. 
Option B is incorrect. While differential backups capture data 
changes since the last full backup, they don’t necessarily reduce 
the time window for potential data loss like increasing snapshot 
frequency would. 
Option C is incorrect. Increasing storage capacity allows for 
more backups or longer retention but does not in itself reduce 
the time window for potential data loss.

 Answers 311-460 
Question 311. A financial institution is shutting down one of its 
data centers. Given the highly sensitive nature of the data 
stored, the company wants to ensure that there is no possibility 
of data retrieval from the storage devices. Which of the 
following methods would be the MOST effective in 
guaranteeing the destruction of data? 
(A)       Overwriting with zeros 
(B)       Standard Disk Format 
	
 
504

(C)       Physical Destruction 
(D)       Running a Disk Cleanup utility 
Explanation 311. Correct Answer: C. Physical Destruction. 
Physical destruction, such as shredding or incinerating the 
storage devices, ensures complete destruction of the media, 
making data retrieval impossible, regardless of the tools or 
techniques employed. 
Option A is incorrect. Overwriting with zeros is a method of 
data sanitization, but advanced techniques might still retrieve 
some portions of the data. 
Option B is incorrect. A standard disk format often does not 
remove data entirely, and traces can remain that could be 
recovered with specialized software. 
Option D is incorrect. Disk Cleanup utilities are designed to 
free up space by removing temporary and unnecessary files but 
not to securely erase sensitive data. 
Question 312. A financial application allows users to transfer 
money to other accounts by entering the account number and 
the amount to transfer. During a security audit, it was observed 
that malicious users could enter SQL code into the account 
number field to manipulate the application’s database. Which 
security technique should the development team implement to 
address this vulnerability? 
(A)       Code obfuscation 
(B)       Input validation 
	
 
505

(C)       Encryption at rest 
(D)       Session timeout 
Explanation 312. Correct Answer: B. Input validation. Input 
validation ensures that only valid and expected data is accepted 
by an application. By validating and sanitizing user input, the 
application can prevent malicious data, such as SQL code, from 
being processed and executed, thus mitigating the risk of SQL 
injection attacks. 
Option A is incorrect. Code obfuscation makes it more difficult 
for attackers to understand the application’s code but does not 
prevent them from injecting malicious input. 
Option C is incorrect. Encryption at rest protects stored data, 
but it doesn’t prevent SQL injection attacks which exploit the 
application’s input handling. 
Option D is incorrect. Session timeout limits the duration of a 
user’s session, but it does not validate or sanitize user input. 
Question 313. After a series of cyberattacks, BetaTech, a 
financial institution, decided to standardize the configurations 
across its entire server fleet. They’ve established a secure 
baseline configuration for their servers. What should be the 
NEXT step in ensuring the servers conform to this new 
baseline? 
(A)       Frequently conduct vulnerability scanning on all servers 
(B)       Introduce biometric authentication for server access 
(C)       Deploy the secure baseline across all servers 
(D)       Monitor network traffic to detect anomalies 
	
 
506

Explanation 313. Correct Answer: C. Deploy the secure 
baseline across all servers. After establishing a secure 
baseline, the immediate next step is to deploy or apply this 
baseline to the servers. This ensures that all servers start from a 
standardized and secure configuration. 
Option A is incorrect. While vulnerability scanning is crucial, 
it is more of a continuous process to identify potential 
vulnerabilities and doesn’t directly apply the secure baseline to 
the servers. 
Option B is incorrect. Biometric authentication, though a 
valuable security measure, does not address the deployment of 
the established secure baseline on servers. 
Option D is incorrect. Monitoring network traffic is essential 
for detecting potential threats, but it does not directly ensure the 
deployment of the secure baseline on servers. 
Question 314. An energy company is looking to enhance the 
security of its ICS/SCADA systems. They have realized that 
default configurations might have vulnerabilities. Which of the 
following is the BEST initial step to take in securing their ICS/
SCADA systems? 
(A)       Connect the ICS/SCADA systems to the internet for 
remote monitoring 
(B)       Use commercial off-the-shelf software to add a layer of 
security 
(C)       Implement a secure baseline configuration tailored 
to the ICS/SCADA environment 
	
 
507

(D)       Increase the number of users with administrative 
privileges to ensure rapid response to issues 
Explanation 314. Correct Answer: C. Implement a secure 
baseline configuration tailored to the ICS/SCADA 
environment. Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and 
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems 
are critical in managing industrial processes. Implementing a 
secure baseline configuration tailored to these systems ensures 
that unnecessary services and potential vulnerabilities are 
minimized. 
Option A is incorrect. Connecting ICS/SCADA systems 
directly to the internet exposes them to a wide range of threats 
and potential cyber-attacks. 
Option B is incorrect. While commercial off-the-shelf software 
can be beneficial, it’s not the best initial step. Secure baselines 
tailored to the ICS/SCADA environment are more effective. 
Option D is incorrect. Increasing the number of users with 
administrative privileges contradicts the principle of least 
privilege and can introduce more security vulnerabilities. 
Question 315. A multinational company is planning to issue 
company-owned mobile devices to its executives. Given the 
sensitivity of the data the executives handle, what hardening 
measure would be MOST effective to ensure the security of 
these mobile devices? 
(A)       Regularly updating the company's social media profiles 
to mention the security measures taken 
	
 
508

(B)       Implementing biometric authentication in addition 
to strong passcodes 
(C)       Turning off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi when not in use 
(D)       Setting the devices to display brighter screen colors 
Explanation 315. Correct Answer: B. Implementing 
biometric authentication in addition to strong passcodes. 
Biometric authentication (like fingerprint or facial recognition) 
combined with strong passcodes provides a robust multi-factor 
authentication mechanism, making unauthorized access to the 
device significantly more challenging. 
Option A is incorrect. Publicly announcing security measures 
on social media does not harden the device. Moreover, 
divulging too much about security practices could expose the 
organization to targeted attacks. 
Option C is incorrect. While turning off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi 
can reduce certain attack vectors, it’s not as comprehensive a 
security measure as implementing strong multi-factor 
authentication. 
Option D is incorrect. Screen colors have no direct correlation 
to the security hardening of a device. 
Question 316. A large e-commerce company wants to ensure 
that their newly developed application is free from any code 
vulnerabilities before it is deployed to the production 
environment. They want to catch any software flaws, especially 
those that might lead to potential security risks. Which of the 
following methodologies should they employ? 
	
 
509

(A)       Runtime application self-protection (RASP) 
(B)       Penetration testing on the live application 
(C)       Static code analysis 
(D)       User acceptance testing (UAT) 
Explanation 316. Correct Answer: C. Static code analysis. 
Static code analysis involves analyzing the application’s code 
without executing it, focusing on detecting vulnerabilities, 
coding flaws, or other potential security threats, making it an 
appropriate methodology for the scenario presented. 
Option A is incorrect. Runtime application self-protection 
(RASP) is about real-time application monitoring and 
protection, which would not be the primary choice for pre-
deployment vulnerability checks. 
Option B is incorrect. Penetration testing on the live 
application involves testing the application once it is live or 
running, which might not be suitable when looking to identify 
vulnerabilities in the pre-deployment phase. 
Option D is incorrect. User acceptance testing (UAT) focuses 
on determining if the software meets the business needs and 
functions correctly for the end-users. It does not emphasize 
finding security vulnerabilities. 
Question 317. Jenny, the new CIO of a multinational firm, 
wants to ensure that every software and hardware asset in the 
organization has a clearly defined owner responsible for its 
security and maintenance. Which of the following is the MOST 
effective way to achieve this? 
	
 
510

(A)       Deploy an automated asset discovery tool and assign 
assets to departments based on their location 
(B)       Mandate that every department head is the default 
owner of all assets within their department 
(C)       Conduct regular audits and require individual users to 
claim ownership of their assets 
(D)       Introduce an Asset Management System where 
assets are logged with defined ownership as they are 
procured or assigned 
Explanation 317. Correct Answer: D. Introduce an Asset 
Management System where assets are logged with defined 
ownership as they are procured or assigned. An Asset 
Management System provides a structured way to log, track, 
and manage assets throughout their lifecycle, including defining 
and recording asset ownership. This ensures clarity and 
accountability regarding asset responsibility. 
Option A is incorrect. While automated discovery tools are 
helpful, assigning assets based solely on location does not 
necessarily reflect the actual usage or responsibility for the 
asset. 
Option B is incorrect. While department heads should be 
aware of assets within their departments, they may not always 
be the best individuals to take ownership, especially for specific 
or specialized assets. 
Option C is incorrect. Regular audits are crucial, but relying 
solely on users to claim ownership might not capture all assets, 
and it’s a reactive rather than proactive approach. 
	
 
511

Question 318. An audit report indicates that several network 
switches in a data center lack security configurations, making 
them potential targets for attackers. Which of the following 
hardening techniques would BEST reduce the risk associated 
with these switches? 
(A)       Configuring port mirroring to monitor network traffic 
(B)       Disabling unused switch ports 
(C)       Implementing load balancing across the switches 
(D)       Increasing the MAC address table size for performance 
Explanation 318. Correct Answer: B. Disabling unused 
switch ports. By disabling unused switch ports, you minimize 
potential points of entry for unauthorized devices or attackers. 
This is a basic step in network switch hardening. 
Option A is incorrect. Port mirroring is used for monitoring 
and isn’t directly a hardening technique. While monitoring is 
crucial for security, it doesn’t necessarily prevent unauthorized 
access. 
Option C is incorrect. Load balancing is primarily about 
distributing network traffic efficiently across multiple paths or 
resources, and it doesn’t inherently harden the switches. 
Option D is incorrect. Increasing the MAC address table size 
might improve switch performance in certain scenarios, but it 
does not harden the switch against potential security threats. 
Question 319. DeltaSoft has released a new web application. 
The security team is tasked with observing the application’s 
behavior and responses when it is running to identify potential 
	
 
512

vulnerabilities. Which method is most appropriate for this 
purpose? 
(A)       Static Analysis 
(B)       Fuzz Testing 
(C)       Whitebox Testing 
(D)       Dynamic Analysis 
Explanation 319. Correct Answer: D. Dynamic Analysis. 
Dynamic analysis focuses on examining an application during 
its execution, or runtime. By observing the application’s 
behavior and responses, security teams can identify 
vulnerabilities that might not be evident in the static code. 
Option A is incorrect. Static analysis evaluates an application’s 
code without executing the application. It does not focus on 
observing the application’s behavior during runtime. 
Option B is incorrect. Fuzz testing involves submitting random 
inputs to an application to observe its behavior and detect 
vulnerabilities, but it’s just one subset of dynamic analysis. 
Option C is incorrect. Whitebox testing involves 
understanding the internal structures and workings of an 
application while testing, which can be part of static or dynamic 
testing, but on its own, it does not specifically focus on runtime 
behavior observation. 
Question 320. A security analyst at ZetaTech is looking to 
gather information about emerging threats and vulnerabilities 
relevant to their industry. Which of the following would be the 
MOST suitable method to obtain real-time, continuously 
	
 
513

updated data on potential security issues? 
(A)       Relying solely on automated internal vulnerability 
scanners 
(B)       Periodic manual penetration testing 
(C)       Subscribing to an OSINT threat feed 
(D)       Regularly checking the company's firewall logs 
Explanation 320. Correct Answer: C. Subscribing to an 
OSINT threat feed. An OSINT (Open-source intelligence) 
threat feed provides real-time information and is continuously 
updated with data on potential security issues sourced from 
publicly available information. 
Option A is incorrect. While automated internal vulnerability 
scanners are valuable for identifying vulnerabilities within the 
organization’s infrastructure, they don’t provide continuous 
real-time data about external emerging threats. 
Option B is incorrect. Manual penetration testing is periodic 
and doesn’t offer continuous updates on emerging threats from 
the broader industry. 
Option C is incorrect. Regularly checking the company’s 
firewall logs will give insight into potential malicious activities 
targeting the company, but it won’t offer broad, updated data on 
industry-wide threats. 
Question 321. A medium-sized enterprise is preparing to 
upgrade its office workstations. The IT department is 
considering purchasing devices from a lesser-known, but 
cheaper, vendor. Which of the following should be the 
	
 
514

PRIMARY consideration before finalizing the acquisition? 
(A)       Whether the vendor offers a longer warranty period 
(B)       The aesthetics and design of the workstations 
(C)       The vendor's adherence to industry security 
standards and practices 
(D)       The amount of training required for IT staff to support 
the new devices 
Explanation 321. Correct Answer: C. The vendor’s 
adherence to industry security standards and practices. 
Ensuring that the vendor adheres to industry security standards 
and practices is critical for maintaining a secure environment. 
Devices that don’t meet security standards could introduce 
vulnerabilities into the organization. 
Option A is incorrect. While a longer warranty period might be 
attractive, it should not be the primary concern over security 
considerations. 
Option B is incorrect. Aesthetics and design, while potentially 
important for branding or user satisfaction, are not as critical as 
security considerations. 
Option D is incorrect. Training the IT staff is important, but it 
shouldn’t take precedence over ensuring the devices themselves 
are secure. 
Question 322. ClearView Industries wants to give their 
employees the flexibility to choose their own devices for work 
while retaining control over the device configurations and 
applications. Which deployment model would be the MOST 
	
 
515

appropriate for ClearView’s objectives? 
(A)       Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) 
(B)       Choose Your Own Device (CYOD) 
(C)       Corporate-owned, Personally Enabled (COPE) 
(D)       Fixed Device Deployment (FDD) 
Explanation 322. Correct Answer: B. Choose Your Own 
Device (CYOD). In the CYOD model, employees are allowed 
to choose a device from a list of approved devices. The 
organization retains control over the device configurations and 
applications, ensuring a blend of user preference and corporate 
security. 
Option A is incorrect. BYOD allows employees to bring their 
personal devices to work, which means the organization has less 
control over the configurations and applications. 
Option C is incorrect. While COPE provides devices owned 
by the corporation and allows personal use, it does not 
necessarily offer employees the choice of which device they get. 
Option D is incorrect. Fixed Device Deployment (FDD) is not 
a standard deployment model in the context of mobile solutions, 
and it does not reflect the flexibility of device choice. 
Question 323. A recently hired security analyst at CyberTech 
Inc. wants to get a better understanding of the organization’s 
network infrastructure. Which of the following activities would 
provide a LIST of servers, workstations, printers, switches, and 
routers currently active in the network? 
(A)       Vulnerability Scanning 
	
 
516

(B)       Intrusion Detection 
(C)       Network Enumeration 
(D)       Penetration Testing 
Explanation 323. Correct Answer: C. Network 
Enumeration. Network enumeration is the process of 
identifying devices on a network. Through enumeration, an 
analyst can gather information about network devices, their 
types, and other attributes, thereby getting a clearer picture of 
the network’s infrastructure. 
Option A is incorrect. Vulnerability scanning aims to identify 
vulnerabilities in network devices and systems, not necessarily 
to list all active devices. 
Option B is incorrect. Intrusion detection focuses on 
monitoring network traffic for malicious activities and potential 
security breaches. 
Option D is incorrect. Penetration testing aims to exploit 
vulnerabilities in a network to determine its security posture, 
not to list all active devices. 
Question 324. A network engineer is preparing a new batch of 
routers for deployment in a large organization. Which of the 
following steps should the engineer prioritize to ensure that the 
routers are securely configured from the start? 
(A)       Configure the routers to use DHCP to dynamically 
assign IP addresses to connected devices 
(B)       Change the default administrative credentials on the 
routers 
	
 
517

(C)       Update the routers' firmware to the latest, most feature-
rich version, regardless of its security posture 
(D)       Customize the routers' LED colors for easy 
identification in the server room 
Explanation 324. Correct Answer: B. Change the default 
administrative credentials on the routers. Routers often come 
with default credentials that are widely known and can be easily 
exploited by attackers. Changing these credentials is essential 
for establishing a secure baseline. 
Option A is incorrect. While DHCP is commonly used in many 
networks, enabling it is not necessarily a secure baseline action. 
Additionally, DHCP on routers can be exploited if not securely 
configured. 
Option C is incorrect. Blindly updating to the latest firmware 
without considering its security posture can introduce 
vulnerabilities. It’s important to ensure that the firmware is both 
updated and secure. 
Option D is incorrect. Customizing LED colors relates to 
physical identification and does not inherently improve the 
security configuration of a router. 
Question 325. A university is looking to revamp its wireless 
network to provide secure access for students and faculty. The 
IT department wants an authentication method that leverages a 
centralized server to validate user credentials and can integrate 
with their existing directory service. Which authentication 
protocol should they consider?

(A)       Pre-shared Key (PSK) 
(B)       Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol (LEAP) 
(C)       Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer 
Security (EAP-TLS) 
(D)       Shared Secret Challenge 
Explanation 325. Correct Answer: C. Extensible 
Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP-
TLS). EAP-TLS provides strong security by using digital 
certificates to authenticate both the client and the server. It 
operates in conjunction with a RADIUS server, allowing for 
centralized management of user credentials and seamless 
integration with existing directory services. 
Option A is incorrect. Pre-shared Key (PSK) does not involve 
a centralized server for authentication. Instead, a single shared 
key is used for all devices, which may not be scalable or secure 
for a large university setting. 
Option B is incorrect. While LEAP provides centralized 
authentication via a RADIUS server, it has known 
vulnerabilities and may not offer the level of security the 
university is looking for. 
Option D is incorrect. Shared Secret Challenge is not a 
standard wireless authentication protocol. In practice, 
challenges based on shared secrets (like PSK) can be vulnerable 
if the secret becomes known. 
Question 326. TechHive Corp. is planning to sell some of its 
old servers. Before selling, they want to ensure that no 
	
 
519

retrievable personal or business data remains on the hard drives. 
Which of the following methods should TechHive use to ensure 
the drives are clean and the data cannot be recovered? 
(A)       Simple Format 
(B)       Magnetic Wiping 
(C)       Physical Destruction 
(D)       Standard Defragmentation 
Explanation 326. Correct Answer: B. Magnetic Wiping. 
Magnetic wiping, also known as degaussing, uses magnetic 
fields to permanently erase data from storage devices. It makes 
the data irretrievable, ensuring that personal and business data 
cannot be recovered even with advanced tools. 
Option A is incorrect. A simple format often leaves traces of 
data, which can potentially be recovered using specialized 
software. 
Option C is incorrect. While physical destruction ensures data 
cannot be retrieved, it would make the servers unusable for 
resale purposes. 
Option D is incorrect. Defragmentation is a process to 
optimize and organize the data on a drive, but it does not erase 
data. 
Question 327. The network administrator of a rapidly growing 
tech firm is concerned about the potential vulnerabilities of the 
company’s switches. Which of the following measures is MOST 
effective in hardening these network switches against possible 
attacks? 
	
 
520

(A)       Assigning static IP addresses to all connected devices 
(B)       Implementing strong password policies for switch 
access 
(C)       Upgrading the switches to support 10Gbps for future 
expansion 
(D)       Customizing the switch LED colors for easy 
identification 
Explanation 327. Correct Answer: B. Implementing strong 
password policies for switch access. Hardening switches 
involves reducing their vulnerability to unauthorized access and 
potential misuse. Implementing strong password policies 
ensures that only authorized personnel can access and configure 
the switches. 
Option A is incorrect. While assigning static IP addresses 
might help in network management, it does not inherently 
harden a switch against potential attacks. 
Option C is incorrect. Upgrading the speed capabilities of 
switches, such as supporting 10Gbps, is a performance 
enhancement and not directly related to hardening or security. 
Option D is incorrect. Customizing LED colors is related to 
physical identification and does not improve the security 
posture of the switch. 
Question 328. A robotics company is developing an 
autonomous vehicle that relies on a Real-Time Operating 
System (RTOS) to manage its operations. The development 
team wants to ensure that the vehicle’s RTOS has a solid 
	
 
521

security posture. What should the team prioritize when 
establishing a secure baseline for this RTOS? 
(A)       Installing a robust antivirus software 
(B)       Enabling all features for maximum functionality 
(C)       Regularly backing up the RTOS data to the cloud 
(D)       Minimizing the number of services and open ports 
Explanation 328. Correct Answer: D. Minimizing the 
number of services and open ports. Reducing the number of 
services and open ports reduces the attack surface on the RTOS, 
making it more challenging for attackers to find vulnerabilities. 
Option A is incorrect. While antivirus software is essential for 
many systems, an RTOS, especially one for an autonomous 
vehicle, would prioritize reducing the attack surface and 
ensuring real-time performance rather than relying on 
traditional antivirus solutions. 
Option B is incorrect. Enabling all features may introduce 
unnecessary vulnerabilities. It’s best to enable only required 
functionalities to maintain security. 
Option C is incorrect. While backups are crucial for data 
integrity and recovery, the primary concern for an RTOS, 
especially in autonomous vehicles, would be real-time 
performance and reducing potential vulnerabilities. 
Question 329. After deploying wireless access points in a large 
manufacturing facility, employees report inconsistent wireless 
connectivity in some areas. What tool would be most effective 
for the IT team to use to visualize areas of weak wireless signal 
	
 
522

strength? 
(A)       Network bandwidth monitor 
(B)       Protocol analyzer 
(C)       Heat map software 
(D)       Intrusion detection system 
Explanation 329. Correct Answer: C. Heat map software. 
Heat map software allows IT professionals to visually see areas 
of strong and weak wireless signal strength, making it easier to 
adjust placements or add additional access points as needed. 
Option A is incorrect. A network bandwidth monitor is used to 
measure the amount of data being sent over a network, not to 
visualize wireless signal strength. 
Option B is incorrect. A protocol analyzer is used to capture 
and analyze network traffic, not to visually display wireless 
coverage. 
Option D is incorrect. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is 
designed to detect unauthorized access or malicious activities 
on a network. It does not show areas of weak wireless signal 
strength. 
Question 330. Sarah, an end-user, downloads a software update 
from a website. Before installing, she wants to make sure the 
software hasn’t been modified maliciously and that it originates 
from a trusted source. What should Sarah check to validate this? 
(A)       The SSL certificate of the website 
(B)       The application's code signing certificate 
	
 
523

(C)       The application's open-source repositories 
(D)       The software's user reviews 
Explanation 330. Correct Answer: B. The application’s code 
signing certificate. By checking the application’s code signing 
certificate, Sarah can validate that the software was indeed 
issued by a trusted entity and hasn’t been altered since it was 
signed. A valid code signing certificate gives users confidence 
in the authenticity and integrity of the software. 
Option A is incorrect. While the SSL certificate of a website 
ensures secure data transmission between the server and the 
browser, it doesn’t guarantee the integrity or authenticity of the 
software being downloaded. 
Option C is incorrect. Open-source repositories may contain 
the source code of a software, but checking these repositories 
doesn’t necessarily validate the integrity of the compiled 
software version Sarah has downloaded. 
Option D is incorrect. User reviews can provide insights into 
the software’s functionality and user experience, but they cannot 
be relied upon to confirm software authenticity or integrity. 
Question 331. A local coffee shop offers free Wi-Fi to its 
customers. Recently, there have been reports of man-in-the-
middle attacks on the network. The owner decides to upgrade 
the wireless security and wants to implement a cryptographic 
protocol to secure data transmissions. Which protocol would 
provide a balance between security and performance for the 
public Wi-Fi users? 
	
 
524

(A)       Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 
(B)       Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) 
(C)       RC4 Stream Cipher 
(D)       Open Wireless 
Explanation 331. Correct Answer: A. Advanced Encryption 
Standard (AES). AES offers a good balance between security 
and performance. It is a modern encryption standard that 
provides strong security without causing significant 
performance overhead, making it suitable for a public Wi-Fi 
setting where both security and user experience are important. 
Option B is incorrect. WEP is an outdated encryption protocol 
with known vulnerabilities. It is insecure and can be easily 
cracked, making it unsuitable for securing a public Wi-Fi 
network. 
Option C is incorrect. RC4 is a stream cipher that was used in 
older wireless protocols like WEP. It has been found to be 
vulnerable to various attacks and is no longer considered secure 
for wireless networks. 
Option D is incorrect. An open wireless network does not 
implement any encryption, leaving data transmissions 
vulnerable to eavesdropping and other attacks. It would not 
provide the desired security for the coffee shop’s Wi-Fi users. 
Question 332. A software development company has decided to 
host their applications in a multi-cloud environment. Before 
deploying, they are looking to enhance the security of their 
cloud-based resources. Which of the following is the BEST 
	
 
525

practice for hardening their cloud infrastructure? 
(A)       Ensure that all cloud storage buckets or containers are 
publicly accessible for easier data sharing 
(B)       Apply consistent security configurations and policies 
across all cloud providers 
(C)       Use the same SSH key pairs across all cloud instances 
for uniformity 
(D)       Limit the use of Identity and Access Management 
(IAM) roles to senior staff only 
Explanation 332. Correct Answer: B. Apply consistent 
security configurations and policies across all cloud 
providers. Maintaining consistent security configurations and 
policies across all cloud providers ensures that there are no 
weak links in the multi-cloud setup and reduces the complexity 
of managing multiple sets of policies. 
Option A is incorrect. Making all cloud storage buckets or 
containers publicly accessible can expose sensitive data and is a 
common misconfiguration that leads to data breaches. 
Option C is incorrect. Using the same SSH key pairs across all 
instances can be risky. If an attacker obtains the SSH key, they 
can gain unauthorized access to all instances that use that key. 
Option D is incorrect. While it’s important to limit access 
based on the principle of least privilege, IAM roles should be 
appropriately assigned to staff based on their responsibilities 
and not just their seniority. This ensures that users have the 
necessary permissions to do their jobs without unnecessary 
access to sensitive resources. 
	
 
526

Question 333. After running a vulnerability scan on the 
company’s infrastructure, a security analyst notices a reported 
vulnerability on a server. However, after manual verification, 
the analyst determines that the vulnerability doesn’t actually 
exist on the server. What is this situation best described as? 
(A)       A false negative 
(B)       A true positive 
(C)       A false positive 
(D)       A confirmation bias 
Explanation 333. Correct Answer: C. A false positive. A false 
positive in vulnerability management occurs when a system 
incorrectly flags a threat or vulnerability that isn’t truly present. 
This can lead to wasted resources on investigating and 
attempting to remediate a non-existent issue. 
Option A is incorrect. A false negative would mean that the 
vulnerability exists, but the system failed to detect it, which is 
the opposite of the scenario described. 
Option B is incorrect. A true positive means that the 
vulnerability was correctly identified and truly exists, which 
isn’t the case here. 
Option D is incorrect. Confirmation bias is a cognitive bias 
where one favors information that confirms their existing 
beliefs. It’s not relevant to the scenario of incorrectly detected 
vulnerabilities. 
Question 334. An e-commerce platform recently suffered a data 
breach where attackers exploited cookies to impersonate user 
	
 
527

sessions. A security analyst is tasked with recommending 
measures to secure user cookies. Which of the following 
measures will ensure that cookies are transmitted securely 
between the user’s browser and the server? 
(A)       Storing cookies in the database 
(B)       Implementing the "Secure" attribute for cookies 
(C)       Increasing the cookie expiration time 
(D)       Base64 encoding the cookie content 
Explanation 334. Correct Answer: B. Implementing the 
“Secure” attribute for cookies. The “Secure” attribute ensures 
that a cookie is only sent over secure, encrypted HTTPS 
connections. By implementing this attribute, the cookie won’t 
be transmitted over unencrypted HTTP connections, reducing 
the risk of interception by malicious actors. 
Option A is incorrect. Storing cookies in the database doesn’t 
necessarily secure the transmission of cookies between the 
client and server. It’s more about storage security rather than 
transmission security. 
Option C is incorrect. Increasing the cookie expiration time 
can actually increase the window of opportunity for an attacker 
to exploit a cookie, making it a less secure practice. 
Option D is incorrect. Base64 encoding is not encryption; it’s 
just a way to represent binary data in an ASCII string format. 
Encoding can be easily reversed, offering little to no security. 
Question 335. A security analyst is reviewing a vulnerability 
report and sees a reference to CVE-2023-12345 with a CVSS 
	
 
528

score of 9.5. Which of the following conclusions can the analyst 
draw based on this information? 
(A)       The vulnerability was first identified in the year 2023 
(B)       The vulnerability is of low severity 
(C)       The vulnerability affects only software produced in 
2023 
(D)       CVE-2023-12345 is the software vendor's internal code 
for the vulnerability 
Explanation 335. Correct Answer: A. The vulnerability was 
first identified in the year 2023. The CVE identifier’s format 
begins with the year the vulnerability was made public, so 
CVE-2023-12345 indicates a vulnerability identified in 2023. 
Option B is incorrect. CVSS scores range from 0 to 10, with 
higher scores indicating higher severity. A score of 9.5 is 
considered critical severity, not low. 
Option C is incorrect. The year in a CVE identifier refers to 
when the vulnerability was published, not the year the software 
was produced. 
Option D is incorrect. The CVE system is a standard method 
for identifying vulnerabilities and doesn’t represent a software 
vendor’s internal coding. 
Question 336. AlphaTech is seeking a comprehensive source of 
intelligence about the latest cyber threats targeting its specific 
industry. While OSINT provides valuable data, the company is 
considering investing in a more specialized solution. Which of 
the following would best address AlphaTech’s needs? 
	
 
529

(A)       Implementing internal honeypots to trap attackers 
(B)       Subscribing to a third-party threat intelligence feed 
(C)       Regularly attending cyber security conferences 
(D)       Using open-source vulnerability scanners 
Explanation 336. Correct Answer: B. Subscribing to a third-
party threat intelligence feed. A third-party threat intelligence 
feed, especially one tailored for a specific industry, provides 
specialized, often real-time information about cyber threats, 
offering insights beyond what’s available in the public domain. 
Option A is incorrect. While honeypots can help understand 
the tactics of attackers targeting the organization, they don’t 
provide comprehensive intelligence about industry-wide threats. 
Option C is incorrect. Attending cyber security conferences 
can offer insights and updates, but it’s not a continuous or real-
time source of threat intelligence. 
Option D is incorrect. Open-source vulnerability scanners help 
identify vulnerabilities within an organization’s infrastructure 
but don’t offer specialized intelligence about industry-specific 
cyber threats. 
Question 337. ABC Corp recently adopted a Bring Your Own 
Device (BYOD) policy. The IT department is concerned about 
the potential risks associated with personal devices accessing 
the corporate network. Which of the following solutions would 
be MOST effective for enforcing security policies on these 
personal mobile devices? 
(A)       Installing antivirus software on each device 
	
 
530

(B)       Establishing a separate guest Wi-Fi network for mobile 
devices 
(C)       Using Mobile Device Management (MDM) to enforce 
security policies 
(D)       Mandating that employees use strong passwords on 
their personal devices 
Explanation 337. Correct Answer: C. Using Mobile Device 
Management (MDM) to enforce security policies. MDM 
solutions provide centralized control to enforce security 
policies, manage device features, and ensure that personal 
devices meet the organization’s security standards before 
accessing corporate resources. 
Option A is incorrect. While installing antivirus software is a 
good security measure, it doesn’t provide the comprehensive 
policy enforcement capabilities that MDM does. 
Option B is incorrect. A separate guest Wi-Fi may restrict 
access to the internal network, but it doesn’t manage or enforce 
security policies on the devices themselves. 
Option D is incorrect. While using strong passwords is 
essential, it’s just one aspect of device security. MDM offers 
broader policy enforcement capabilities. 
Question 338. David, an IT administrator, noticed an unusually 
high data usage on several company-owned mobile devices 
even when they are connected to the corporate Wi-Fi. He 
suspects these devices might be using cellular data in the 
background. Which of the following solutions should David 
	
 
531

implement to ensure that company devices use only the 
corporate Wi-Fi for data transactions when they’re in the office? 
(A)       Enable Airplane mode on all devices 
(B)       Set up a Wi-Fi whitelist 
(C)       Implement a mobile device management (MDM) 
policy to prioritize Wi-Fi 
(D)       Disable cellular antennas in the office area 
Explanation 338. Correct Answer: C. Implement a mobile 
device management (MDM) policy to prioritize Wi-Fi. An 
MDM solution allows administrators to enforce policies on 
mobile devices. By implementing a policy that prioritizes Wi-Fi 
connections, David can ensure that company devices will use 
the corporate Wi-Fi network when available, thus reducing 
cellular data usage. 
Option A is incorrect. While enabling Airplane mode would 
cut off cellular data, it would also disable all other forms of 
communication including Wi-Fi, making the device unusable 
for its intended purposes. 
Option B is incorrect. Setting up a Wi-Fi whitelist does not 
prevent a device from using cellular data. It only restricts which 
Wi-Fi networks a device can connect to. 
Option D is incorrect. Disabling cellular antennas is a drastic 
measure that could affect other devices and services in the 
vicinity. It’s also impractical and potentially illegal depending 
on local regulations. 
	
 
532

Question 339. A security team recently upgraded their intrusion 
detection system (IDS). Since the upgrade, the system hasn’t 
flagged any intrusions, even though intrusion attempts are a 
regular occurrence. What is this situation best characterized as? 
(A)       A true negative 
(B)       A false negative 
(C)       A true positive 
(D)       A confirmation feedback 
Explanation 339. Correct Answer: B. A false negative. A 
false negative occurs when a system fails to detect a threat or 
vulnerability that is actually present. In this scenario, the IDS 
isn’t detecting real intrusion attempts, which could lead to 
undetected breaches. 
Option A is incorrect. A true negative would mean that the 
system correctly identified that there were no intrusions when 
there truly weren’t any. This isn’t the scenario described as 
intrusion attempts are expected. 
Option C is incorrect. A true positive means that the threat or 
vulnerability was correctly identified and truly exists. Since no 
intrusions are being detected, this isn’t a true positive. 
Option D is incorrect. “Confirmation feedback” isn’t a 
standard term related to vulnerability detection and doesn’t 
apply to the described scenario. 
Question 340. XYZ Corporation is planning to deploy a new 
wireless infrastructure in their newly acquired office building. 
The IT manager wants to ensure optimal wireless coverage 
	
 
533

throughout the premises. Which of the following should the IT 
team prioritize before installing the wireless access points? 
(A)       Purchase the most expensive wireless access points to 
ensure maximum range 
(B)       Conduct a site survey to determine the best locations 
for access points 
(C)       Deploy all access points near windows to enhance 
signal strength 
(D)       Ensure all users have 5GHz capable devices 
Explanation 340. Correct Answer: B. Conduct a site survey 
to determine the best locations for access points. A site 
survey will help identify the optimal placements for access 
points to achieve consistent and robust wireless coverage across 
the entire premises. 
Option A is incorrect. While quality equipment is essential, the 
costliest access points might not always guarantee the best 
results. Placement and environment play crucial roles in 
wireless performance. 
Option C is incorrect. Deploying access points near windows 
can cause signal leakage, potentially making the signal available 
outside the intended area and presenting a security risk. 
Option D is incorrect. While ensuring users have 5GHz 
capable devices is a good practice, it doesn’t relate directly to 
the optimal installation of wireless access points. 
Question 341. XYZ Company uses MDM to manage company-
owned and employee-owned mobile devices. An employee 
	
 
534

reported losing their personal phone over the weekend. What 
MDM feature should the IT department use to ensure that 
sensitive company data on the lost phone isn’t accessed? 
(A)       Monitor the device's location 
(B)       Force update the device's apps 
(C)       Remote wipe the device 
(D)       Change the user's email password 
Explanation 341. Correct Answer: C. Remote wipe the 
device. Using the remote wipe feature, the IT department can 
erase all data, including company data, from the lost device, 
ensuring that sensitive information doesn’t fall into the wrong 
hands. 
Option A is incorrect. Monitoring the device’s location might 
help in finding it but doesn’t prevent unauthorized access to the 
data on the device. 
Option B is incorrect. Force updating the device’s apps might 
address vulnerabilities in the apps but doesn’t directly protect 
the company data on the device. 
Option D is incorrect. Changing the user’s email password can 
prevent unauthorized access to the user’s email, but it doesn’t 
secure other sensitive company data that might be on the device. 
Question 342. After a series of cyber incidents, AlphaTech 
Corp. wants to take proactive measures to identify 
vulnerabilities in their network. They aim to obtain a 
comprehensive report of potential weaknesses without 
exploiting them. Which of the following would best meet this 
	
 
535

objective? 
(A)       Penetration test 
(B)       Vulnerability scan 
(C)       Red team assessment 
(D)       Port security 
Explanation 342. Correct Answer: B. Vulnerability scan. A 
vulnerability scan is designed to inspect systems, networks, and 
applications to identify potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities. 
Unlike some of the other options, it doesn’t attempt to exploit 
these vulnerabilities; it merely identifies and reports them. 
Option A is incorrect. A penetration test goes a step further 
than a vulnerability scan. While it identifies vulnerabilities, it 
also attempts to exploit them to understand the potential impact 
of a breach. 
Option C is incorrect. A red team assessment is a goal-based 
assessment where a simulated adversary (the red team) tries to 
achieve specific objectives. It often involves exploitation, which 
goes beyond the mere identification of vulnerabilities. 
Option D is incorrect. Port security is a feature at the data link 
layer to control MAC address-based access on a port-by-port 
basis. It doesn’t offer a comprehensive vulnerability report. 
Question 343. GammaTech is in the final stages of deploying a 
new application. Before the deployment, the security team 
wants to examine the application’s code without executing it to 
identify any potential vulnerabilities. Which vulnerability 
identification method should the team employ? 
	
 
536

(A)       Penetration Testing 
(B)       Dynamic Analysis 
(C)       Static Analysis 
(D)       Fuzz Testing 
Explanation 343. Correct Answer: C. Static Analysis. Static 
analysis involves examining an application’s code, bytecode, or 
binary code without executing it to identify vulnerabilities. This 
method allows security teams to find potential security issues in 
the codebase before the application runs. 
Option A is incorrect. Penetration testing involves actively 
trying to exploit vulnerabilities in a system or application. It 
does not focus on code examination without execution. 
Option B is incorrect. Dynamic analysis examines an 
application during its runtime, observing its behavior to identify 
vulnerabilities. 
Option D is incorrect. Fuzz testing, or fuzzing, involves 
providing a program with a series of random inputs to see if any 
of them cause crashes or other unexpected behavior, helping 
identify vulnerabilities. 
Question 344. During a routine vulnerability assessment, 
TechInc discovers a weakness in their system that, if exploited, 
would allow an attacker to modify existing user accounts, 
including privileges. Which classification best describes this 
vulnerability? 
(A)       Elevation of privilege vulnerability 
(B)       Disclosure vulnerability 
	
 
537

(C)       Replay vulnerability 
(D)       Remote code execution vulnerability 
Explanation 344. Correct Answer: A. Elevation of privilege 
vulnerability. Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities allow 
attackers to increase their privileges within a system, often 
giving them more access than intended. The scenario describes 
a situation where user accounts and their privileges can be 
modified, aligning with this classification. 
Option B is incorrect. Disclosure vulnerabilities involve 
unauthorized access to information but not the modification of 
user privileges or data. 
Option C is incorrect. Replay vulnerabilities occur when 
attackers capture and later retransmit valid data transmissions to 
fool a system, which is not described in the given scenario. 
Option D is incorrect. Remote code execution vulnerabilities 
allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands or code on a 
target system. While these can be severe, the given scenario 
specifically describes privilege changes, not arbitrary code 
execution. 
Question 345. A healthcare organization uses embedded 
systems in various medical devices. They are aware of the 
potential threats these systems can pose if not properly secured. 
Which of the following is NOT a recommended practice when 
hardening embedded systems in this context? 
(A)       Regularly patching and updating the firmware of the 
devices 
	
 
538

(B)       Allowing unrestricted access to the devices for ease of 
use by the medical staff 
(C)       Disabling unnecessary services and features not 
required for the device's primary function 
(D)       Changing default credentials and using strong, unique 
passwords for device access 
Explanation 345. Correct Answer: B. Allowing unrestricted 
access to the devices for ease of use by the medical staff. 
Unrestricted access can lead to unintentional or deliberate 
misconfigurations or misuse of the device, compromising its 
security. 
Option A is incorrect. Regularly patching and updating 
firmware is a critical aspect of maintaining the security of 
embedded systems, especially with the evolving nature of 
threats. 
Option C is incorrect. Disabling unnecessary services and 
features reduces the attack surface and is a fundamental 
principle of system hardening. 
Option D is incorrect. Changing default credentials and 
ensuring strong, unique passwords are in place is essential to 
prevent unauthorized access. 
Question 346. TechSoft Corp. is implementing a new asset-
tracking system to monitor its vast array of computing 
resources. Which of the following should be the PRIMARY 
reason for maintaining an up-to-date hardware and software 
inventory? 
	
 
539

(A)       To ensure software licenses are renewed on time 
(B)       To identify and respond to unauthorized devices or 
software promptly 
(C)       To aid in the procurement of new hardware and software 
(D)       To provide employees with an understanding of 
available resources 
Explanation 346. Correct Answer: B. To identify and 
respond to unauthorized devices or software promptly. 
While all the options have valid reasons for maintaining an 
inventory, from a security standpoint, identifying unauthorized 
devices or software promptly is crucial. Unauthorized devices 
or software can pose a significant security risk, including 
potential data breaches or malware infections. 
Option A is incorrect. While renewing software licenses is 
important, it’s not the primary security reason for maintaining 
an inventory. 
Option C is incorrect. Procurement decisions benefit from 
inventory data but do not directly impact immediate security 
concerns in the way that identifying unauthorized assets does. 
Option D is incorrect. While providing employees with 
resource understanding is beneficial, it isn’t as crucial for 
security as promptly identifying unauthorized assets. 
Question 347. An enterprise is deploying IoT-based security 
cameras across multiple office locations. As the lead security 
professional, what recommendation would you prioritize to 
establish a secure baseline for these devices? 
	
 
540

(A)       Setting the devices to public mode so all employees can 
access the feed for transparency 
(B)       Regularly updating the device firmware to patch 
known vulnerabilities 
(C)       Enabling Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) to ensure 
easy connectivity for all devices on the network 
(D)       Using the same password for all cameras for ease of 
management 
Explanation 347. Correct Answer: B. Regularly updating 
the device firmware to patch known vulnerabilities. Regular 
firmware updates ensure that the IoT devices are protected 
against identified vulnerabilities, helping maintain their security 
posture. 
Option A is incorrect. Setting devices to a public mode can 
lead to potential breaches of privacy and unauthorized access. 
Option C is incorrect. UPnP can introduce vulnerabilities by 
automatically opening ports and allowing devices to set their 
configurations, potentially leading to security risks. 
Option D is incorrect. Using the same password for all devices 
creates a single point of failure. If one device’s password is 
compromised, all devices become vulnerable. 
Question 348. A medium-sized enterprise is concerned about 
the security of its office workstations after a series of malware 
infections. As a security analyst, which of the following 
recommendations would BEST improve the security baseline of 
the workstations?

(A)       Install multiple antivirus solutions to ensure maximum 
detection 
(B)       Set up screensavers with cyber hygiene tips to educate 
users 
(C)       Disable unnecessary services and ports on the 
workstations 
(D)       Frequently change the desktop wallpaper to prevent 
monotony 
Explanation 348. Correct Answer: C. Disable unnecessary 
services and ports on the workstations. By disabling 
unnecessary services and ports, you reduce the number of 
potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities, thus improving the 
security baseline of the workstations. 
Option A is incorrect. Installing multiple antivirus solutions 
can lead to conflicts and may degrade system performance. It’s 
better to have one robust, updated antivirus solution. 
Option B is incorrect. While cyber hygiene tips can be 
informative, they don’t directly contribute to the technical 
security baseline of a workstation. 
Option D is incorrect. Changing the desktop wallpaper does 
nothing for security. Its primary purpose is aesthetics. 
Question 349. AlphaCorp is migrating to cloud infrastructure 
and wants to ensure all virtual machines (VMs) are securely 
configured from the onset. Before deploying multiple VM 
instances, what should AlphaCorp do to ensure each VM starts 
from a secure configuration? 
	
 
542

(A)       Use the default VM templates provided by the cloud 
provider 
(B)       Establish a secure baseline for VM configurations 
and use it for deployment 
(C)       Regularly backup all VMs 
(D)       Use multi-factor authentication for cloud access 
Explanation 349. Correct Answer: B. Establish a secure 
baseline for VM configurations and use it for deployment. 
Establishing a secure baseline for VM configurations ensures 
that each VM is deployed with a set of standard security 
settings, reducing vulnerabilities from default configurations or 
potential misconfigurations. 
Option A is incorrect. Relying solely on default VM templates 
provided by cloud providers may not meet the specific security 
requirements of an organization. Customizing and creating a 
secure baseline is more effective. 
Option C is incorrect. While regular backups are essential for 
data recovery, they do not directly ensure that VMs start from a 
secure configuration. 
Option D is incorrect. Multi-factor authentication is a crucial 
security measure for accessing cloud resources, but it doesn’t 
ensure that VMs are deployed with secure configurations. 
Question 350. A multinational company is deploying a new set 
of servers in its data centers across various countries. Which of 
the following steps should be taken FIRST to ensure the servers 
are secured against potential threats? 
	
 
543

(A)       Set up a monitoring system to alert the IT team of any 
irregular activities 
(B)       Deploy all the software applications the company might 
need in the future 
(C)       Use the server's default configuration to ensure 
manufacturer's best practices are maintained 
(D)       Disable any unused services and ports on the server 
Explanation 350. Correct Answer: D. Disable any unused 
services and ports on the server. When setting up a new 
server, it’s crucial to minimize its attack surface. Disabling 
unused services and ports ensures that only necessary services 
run on the server, reducing potential vulnerabilities. 
Option A is incorrect. While monitoring is vital for security, 
before setting up a monitoring system, it’s more crucial to 
harden the server to minimize vulnerabilities. Monitoring 
should complement hardening measures. 
Option B is incorrect. Deploying all the software applications 
the company might need in the future can introduce unnecessary 
vulnerabilities and overhead. It’s better to install only what’s 
needed and keep the server lean. 
Option C is incorrect. Relying on a server’s default 
configuration can be risky, as it might not be tailored for an 
organization’s specific needs and could have open ports or 
services that are unnecessary. 
Question 351. While analyzing a vulnerability in a company’s 
web application, the security team refers to a specific CVE to 
	
 
544

understand the vulnerability’s details. They further assess its 
CVSS score to decide on the remediation urgency. Which of the 
following best describes the purpose of the CVE and CVSS in 
this context? 
(A)       CVE provides a severity score, while CVSS gives a 
unique identifier for the vulnerability 
(B)       CVE and CVSS both offer a scoring mechanism to rank 
vulnerabilities 
(C)       CVE provides a unique identifier, while CVSS offers 
a standardized severity score 
(D)       CVE and CVSS are regulatory requirements for all 
software applications 
Explanation 351. Correct Answer: C. CVE provides a 
unique identifier, while CVSS offers a standardized severity 
score. CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) offers a 
standardized identifier for vulnerabilities, ensuring clear 
communication and reference. CVSS (Common Vulnerability 
Scoring System) provides a standardized method for rating the 
severity of vulnerabilities, enabling organizations to prioritize 
remediation. 
Option A is incorrect. It’s the opposite. CVE gives a unique 
identifier, while CVSS provides a severity score. 
Option B is incorrect. Only CVSS offers a scoring mechanism 
to rank vulnerabilities. CVE offers unique identifiers. 
Option D is incorrect. While using CVE and CVSS can be 
considered best practices, they aren’t regulatory requirements 
for all software applications. 
	
 
545

Question 352. The network administrator at a university wants 
to ensure that when students log onto the campus wireless 
network, their credentials are verified by the university’s central 
authentication server. Additionally, the administrator wants to 
make sure that the data between the wireless access point and 
the central server is encrypted. Which solution should the 
administrator implement? 
(A)       WPA3 with SAE 
(B)       WPA2-Personal with AES 
(C)       WPA2-Enterprise with RADIUS 
(D)       Open wireless with VPN 
Explanation 352. Correct Answer: C. WPA2-Enterprise 
with RADIUS. WPA2-Enterprise provides a more robust 
authentication method suitable for larger organizations like 
universities. By using RADIUS, the university can centralize 
the authentication process, ensuring students’ credentials are 
verified against the central server. RADIUS also encrypts the 
data between the wireless access point and the central server, 
providing an additional layer of security. 
Option A is incorrect. WPA3 with SAE is primarily used for 
secure handshakes between devices and does not directly relate 
to centralized authentication against a server like RADIUS. 
Option B is incorrect. WPA2-Personal with AES is designed 
for personal or small office use where a pre-shared key is used. 
It doesn’t support centralized authentication like RADIUS. 
Option D is incorrect. While a VPN can encrypt data between 
a device and a network, it doesn’t centralize wireless 
	
 
546

authentication in the way that RADIUS does with WPA2-
Enterprise. 
Question 353. As part of the company’s vulnerability 
management initiative, the security team has decided to conduct 
a series of penetration tests. Which of the following is the 
PRIMARY reason for incorporating penetration testing as a 
threat identification method? 
(A)       To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements 
(B)       To validate the efficiency of security awareness training 
(C)       To actively exploit vulnerabilities and assess 
potential impact 
(D)       To identify misconfigurations in the SIEM system 
Explanation 353. Correct Answer: C. To actively exploit 
vulnerabilities and assess potential impact. Penetration 
testing is a method used to actively exploit vulnerabilities in an 
environment. Its primary purpose is to determine the potential 
impact and risk of those vulnerabilities in a real-world scenario, 
thereby allowing the organization to understand and prioritize 
remediation efforts. 
Option A is incorrect. While some regulations might require 
penetration testing, the primary goal of the test is not just for 
compliance but to understand vulnerabilities’ potential impact. 
Option B is incorrect. Although penetration testing can 
sometimes be used to gauge the effectiveness of security 
training (for instance, in social engineering tests), it’s not the 
primary reason for conducting these tests. 
	
 
547

Option D is incorrect. SIEM systems are used for logging and 
event management. While a pen test might uncover 
misconfigurations in various systems, its primary purpose is not 
to focus on the SIEM. 
Question 354. An organization has recently received a new 
software patch for its critical infrastructure. Before deploying it 
to production, the security team wants to understand its 
behavior and ensure it doesn’t contain any malicious code. 
Which of the following methods would be MOST effective for 
safely executing and observing the patch’s behavior? 
(A)       Deploying the patch during a maintenance window 
(B)       Running the patch within a sandbox environment 
(C)       Conducting a code review of the patch 
(D)       Installing the patch on a virtual machine 
Explanation 354. Correct Answer: B. Running the patch 
within a sandbox environment. Running the patch within a 
sandbox environment allows the security team to execute and 
observe the software’s behavior in an isolated environment, 
ensuring it doesn’t interfere with or harm the actual production 
environment. 
Option A is incorrect. Deploying the patch during a 
maintenance window reduces operational disruptions but 
doesn’t allow for safe observation of the patch’s behavior. 
Option C is incorrect. While a code review can identify 
potential security concerns in the patch, it may not reveal the 
actual behavior when executed. 
	
 
548

Option D is incorrect. Installing the patch on a virtual machine 
is a form of isolation, but a sandbox provides a more controlled 
and restrictive environment specifically designed for observing 
software behavior. 
Question 355. GreenTech Inc. is selling a set of old servers to 
another company. Before the transaction, they want to ensure 
the data on these servers is irretrievable and they can prove that 
due diligence was performed. What should GreenTech seek to 
assure the buyer of proper data destruction? 
(A)       A receipt of sale for the servers 
(B)       A detailed log of the server's usage 
(C)       A certificate of data sanitization 
(D)       A user manual of the servers 
Explanation 355. Correct Answer: C. A certificate of data 
sanitization. A certificate of data sanitization from a reputable 
entity provides assurance that all data on the servers was 
securely and completely wiped. Such certificates confirm that 
specific techniques were used to ensure data is irretrievable, 
giving confidence to the buyer. 
Option A is incorrect. A receipt of sale only proves the 
transaction took place but does not address data sanitization or 
destruction. 
Option B is incorrect. A log of the server’s usage might detail 
its operational history but does not provide assurance of data 
destruction. 
	
 
549

Option D is incorrect. A user manual provides instructions on 
how to use the server but does not address the state or security 
of the data it once held. 
Question 356. Jane, the CISO at a financial institution, is 
overseeing the decommissioning of several old servers. She is 
aware that while some data must be destroyed, other data must 
be retained due to industry regulations. Which principle should 
Jane primarily focus on to ensure compliance? 
(A)       Minimum necessary principle 
(B)       Principle of least privilege 
(C)       Data retention policy 
(D)       Mandatory vacation policy 
Explanation 356. Correct Answer: C. Data retention policy. 
A data retention policy specifically defines how long data 
should be retained and the manner of its storage based on 
business needs, regulatory requirements, and other factors. In 
the context of decommissioning servers, adhering to this policy 
will ensure that Jane complies with regulations related to data 
retention. 
Option A is incorrect. The minimum necessary principle 
pertains to healthcare and refers to only using, disclosing, or 
requesting the amount of information necessary to accomplish a 
specific task. 
Option B is incorrect. The principle of least privilege pertains 
to access controls and means giving users the minimum levels 
of access necessary to perform their jobs. 
	
 
550

Option D is incorrect. A mandatory vacation policy pertains to 
ensuring employees take time off so that potential fraudulent 
activities might be detected in their absence. It doesn’t directly 
address data retention. 
Question 357. CyberFirm, a leading software development 
company, recently updated their server OS due to new features 
and patches. Given that they have already established and 
deployed a secure baseline in the past, what should CyberFirm 
do NEXT to ensure continued security? 
(A)       Conduct a complete system reboot for all servers 
(B)       Re-deploy the same baseline without any modifications 
(C)       Update the secure baseline to include new 
configurations and then deploy it 
(D)       Implement a new firewall rule for the servers 
Explanation 357. Correct Answer: C. Update the secure 
baseline to include new configurations and then deploy it. 
When there are significant updates or changes to systems, it’s 
crucial to review and update the secure baseline accordingly, 
ensuring it remains relevant and effective for the current 
environment. After updating the baseline, it should then be re-
deployed. 
Option A is incorrect. A complete system reboot does not 
address the maintenance of the secure baseline after an OS 
update. 
Option B is incorrect. Simply re-deploying the same baseline 
without adjustments might miss out on specific configurations 
or considerations needed due to the OS update. 
	
 
551

Option D is incorrect. While firewall rules are essential for 
security, they don’t directly address the maintenance and 
updating of a secure baseline. 
Question 358. MatrixCorp recently adopted a mobile strategy 
where employees are provided with company-owned devices. 
These devices are also allowed for personal use, but the 
organization retains the ability to manage and monitor them. 
Which deployment model is MatrixCorp using? 
(A)       Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) 
(B)       Choose Your Own Device (CYOD) 
(C)       Corporate-owned, Personally Enabled (COPE) 
(D)       Public Device Deployment (PDD) 
Explanation 358. Correct Answer: C. Corporate-owned, 
Personally Enabled (COPE). The COPE model involves 
organizations providing employees with company-owned 
devices that they can also use for personal tasks. However, the 
company retains full control, management, and monitoring 
capabilities over these devices. 
Option A is incorrect. In the BYOD model, employees use 
their personal devices for work, not company-provided ones. 
Option B is incorrect. CYOD allows employees to select a 
device from a list of company-approved devices, but the 
emphasis is on choice rather than personal use of corporate-
owned devices. 
	
 
552

Option D is incorrect. Public Device Deployment (PDD) is not 
a recognized deployment model in the context of mobile 
solutions. 
Question 359. A company has recently upgraded its wireless 
infrastructure and wants to ensure that the data transmitted over 
its wireless network is protected using the most recent and 
secure encryption standards. Which of the following should the 
company configure on its wireless access points? 
(A)       WEP 
(B)       WPA 
(C)       WPA2 
(D)       WPA3 
Explanation 359. Correct Answer: D. WPA3. WPA3 is the 
latest iteration of Wi-Fi Protected Access, designed to improve 
upon the security features of WPA2. It offers enhanced 
protections against brute-force attacks, superior encryption 
methods, and a more secure handshake process. 
Option A is incorrect. WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is an 
outdated and insecure protocol that can be easily cracked. It 
should not be used for securing wireless networks. 
Option B is incorrect. While WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) 
was a significant improvement over WEP, it has been surpassed 
by both WPA2 and WPA3 in terms of security features. 
Option C is incorrect. WPA2 has been a strong standard for 
many years but has vulnerabilities that WPA3 addresses, 
making WPA3 the more secure option. 
	
 
553

Question 360. A security analyst is exploring ways to 
proactively identify vulnerabilities within the organization’s 
infrastructure. Which of the following provides the BEST 
method for the analyst to receive real-time threat intelligence 
from the dark web? 
(A)       Utilizing a vulnerability scanner on the organization's 
internal network 
(B)       Subscribing to a dark web threat intelligence feed 
(C)       Conducting regular penetration tests on external-facing 
systems 
(D)       Reviewing daily reports from the organization's SIEM 
system 
Explanation 360. Correct Answer: B. Subscribing to a dark 
web threat intelligence feed. Threat intelligence feeds, 
especially those focusing on the dark web, provide real-time 
information about emerging threats and vulnerabilities. This 
proactive approach allows analysts to be aware of potential 
threats even before they may affect the organization. 
Option A is incorrect. While vulnerability scanners are 
effective at identifying known vulnerabilities within a network, 
they don’t provide real-time threat intelligence from external 
sources like the dark web. 
Option C is incorrect. Penetration tests are indeed useful for 
identifying vulnerabilities in systems and applications. 
However, they don’t specifically provide threat intelligence 
from the dark web. 
	
 
554

Option D is incorrect. SIEM systems aggregate and analyze 
log data from various sources to identify and respond to security 
incidents. While they can alert to current threats within the 
environment, they don’t offer real-time dark web threat 
intelligence. 
Question 361. XYZ Corp is designing their new web 
application infrastructure. They want to ensure that all web 
traffic to and from their application is encrypted. In addition to 
selecting HTTPS as the protocol, which default port should they 
configure for this encrypted traffic? 
(A)       21 
(B)       80 
(C)       443 
(D)       25 
Explanation 361. Correct Answer: C. 443. Port 443 is the 
default port used for HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS) traffic. It 
ensures that web traffic is encrypted and provides a secure 
communication channel between the client and the server. 
Option A is incorrect. Port 21 is the default port for FTP (File 
Transfer Protocol), which is used for transferring files, not 
encrypted web traffic. 
Option B is incorrect. Port 80 is the default port for HTTP, 
which is unencrypted. 
Option D is incorrect. Port 25 is the default port for SMTP 
(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), which is used for email 
transmission, not encrypted web traffic. 
	
 
555

Question 362. TechWorld Corp is concerned about 
cybercriminals sending emails that appear to come from its 
domain to deceive its clients. The company wants to implement 
a solution that would allow receiving email servers to validate 
that an email claiming to come from TechWorld Corp’s domain 
indeed originates from an approved server. Which of the 
following should the company implement? 
(A)       SMTP authentication 
(B)       DKIM 
(C)       POP3 over SSL 
(D)       S/MIME 
Explanation 362. Correct Answer: B. DKIM. DomainKeys 
Identified Mail (DKIM) is a method used to authenticate the 
origin and integrity of an email. With DKIM, a digital signature 
is added to the headers of outgoing emails. Receiving email 
servers then use this signature to validate the email by checking 
it against the sending domain’s public key, which is published in 
the DNS records. 
Option A is incorrect. SMTP authentication ensures that users 
provide valid credentials before they can send emails through a 
server, but it doesn’t validate the domain of the sender to the 
receiver. 
Option C is incorrect. POP3 over SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) 
is about securely retrieving email messages from a server. It 
doesn’t provide a way to authenticate the sender’s domain. 
Option D is incorrect. S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet 
Mail Extensions) is used to encrypt and sign email messages. 
	
 
556

While it ensures the integrity and confidentiality of the email 
content, it does not validate the sender’s domain to the recipient. 
Question 363. After a security incident, a forensic investigation 
revealed that a compromised internal workstation was 
communicating with a known malicious IP address. To prevent 
further communication, the security team decided to take 
immediate action. Which of the following is the BEST 
immediate action to ensure the workstation cannot communicate 
with that IP? 
(A)       Implement a block rule on the web filter for the IP 
address 
(B)       Disable the network port of the compromised 
workstation 
(C)       Use a honeypot to divert the traffic from the malicious 
(D)       Update the firewall's firmware 
Explanation 363. Correct Answer: A. Implement a block 
rule on the web filter for the IP address. By implementing a 
block rule specifically for the known malicious IP address on 
the web filter, any attempt to communicate with that IP would 
be stopped, effectively preventing further malicious 
communications. 
Option B is incorrect. Disabling the network port of the 
compromised workstation would disconnect the machine from 
the network, but it wouldn’t specifically prevent communication 
with the malicious IP if the port were to be re-enabled. 
	
 
557

Option C is incorrect. While honeypots can be used to divert 
or study attacker behavior, they are not the most direct way to 
block communication with a known malicious IP address. 
Option D is incorrect. Updating the firewall’s firmware is a 
general maintenance task and does not specifically address 
blocking communications with the known malicious IP. 
Question 364. Amy, a network administrator, is researching 
tools to assist with automating the evaluation of her 
organization’s systems against a specific security baseline. She 
comes across SCAP and wants to implement it. Which of the 
following BEST describes the primary function of the Security 
Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)? 
(A)       To facilitate the real-time transfer of threat intelligence 
feeds 
(B)       To provide an interface for user authentication against 
Active Directory 
(C)       To allow for automated vulnerability management 
and policy compliance evaluation 
(D)       To offer encrypted communication channels for remote 
system management 
Explanation 364. Correct Answer: C. To allow for 
automated vulnerability management and policy compliance 
evaluation. SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) is a 
suite of open standards that enhances the ability of 
organizations to automate vulnerability management, 
measurement, and policy compliance evaluation on systems. 
	
 
558

Option A is incorrect. While threat intelligence is crucial for 
security, SCAP is not designed primarily for real-time threat 
intelligence feed transfers. 
Option B is incorrect. SCAP does not directly deal with user 
authentication against any directory services. 
Option D is incorrect. SCAP’s primary function isn’t to offer 
encrypted communication channels for remote system 
management. Other protocols and tools serve this purpose. 
Question 365. A pharmaceutical company is working on a new 
drug formula that promises to revolutionize the treatment of a 
particular disease. The R&D team has detailed documentation 
on the components, procedures, and results of the drug trials. 
How should this documentation be classified to ensure that only 
the right people within the company have access? 
(A)       Implement a Domain Name System (DNS) firewall 
(B)       Employ URL scanning to identify and block 
malicious URLs 
(C)       Rely on manual reporting of suspicious URLs by 
employees 
(D)       Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to redirect all 
employee web traffic 
Explanation 365. Correct Answer: B. Employ URL scanning 
to identify and block malicious URLs. URL scanning can 
identify potentially malicious sites by examining the complete 
URL and comparing it with known malicious URLs or patterns. 
This method can block access to URLs that are designed to look 
similar to legitimate ones. 
	
 
559

Option A is incorrect. While a DNS firewall can help block 
access to malicious domains, URL scanning provides more 
granular control by examining the full URL, not just the 
domain. 
Option C is incorrect. Relying solely on manual reporting by 
employees may not be as efficient or effective as an automated 
URL scanning solution. It would also place undue responsibility 
on employees to recognize and report every malicious URL. 
Option D is incorrect. Using a VPN simply changes the route 
of the traffic and provides encrypted communication. It does not 
inherently offer URL scanning or filtering capabilities. 
Question 366. A financial institution wants to ensure that any 
unauthorized access to customer data triggers an immediate 
alert to the security team. Which of the following approaches 
would be the MOST effective in achieving this requirement? 
(A)       Configure alerts for any modification to database 
records 
(B)       Set up alerts for successful logins during off-business 
hours 
(C)       Establish alerting thresholds based on anomalous 
user behavior 
(D)       Send daily reports of all access attempts to the security 
team for review 
Explanation 366. Correct Answer: C. Establish alerting 
thresholds based on anomalous user behavior. By setting 
alerting thresholds based on anomalous behavior, the system 
can detect unauthorized access based on patterns that deviate 
	
 
560

from typical user behavior, providing timely alerts for potential 
breaches. 
Option A is incorrect. Configuring alerts for any modification 
to database records may generate a high number of false 
positives, especially in a dynamic environment like a financial 
institution where legitimate changes occur regularly. 
Option B is incorrect. While setting up alerts for off-hours 
access can catch some unauthorized attempts, it might miss 
breaches occurring during business hours. 
Option D is incorrect. Daily reports may delay the detection 
and response to unauthorized access, as it doesn’t offer real-
time alerting. 
Question 367. A marketing team is collaborating on a new 
campaign and requires access to a shared folder. However, they 
shouldn’t be able to modify files created by others. How should 
permissions be set on this shared folder? 
(A)       Assign the marketing team full control 
(B)       Allow the marketing team read-only access 
(C)       Assign the marketing team write-only access 
(D)       Assign the marketing team modify permission but 
deny the delete permission 
Explanation 367. Correct Answer: D. Assign the marketing 
team modify permission but deny the delete permission. By 
providing modify permissions but denying delete permissions, 
team members can create and edit their own files, but they 
won’t be able to delete or modify files created by others. 
	
 
561

Option A is incorrect. Full control would allow team members 
to modify or delete any file, which is not desired. 
Option B is incorrect. Read-only access would prevent team 
members from creating or editing any files. 
Option C is incorrect. Write-only access would prevent team 
members from viewing existing files in the folder. 
Question 368. Alice, a cybersecurity analyst, is tasked with 
identifying potential weaknesses in a newly deployed web 
application’s infrastructure before it goes live. She wants a tool 
that can proactively discover and report on system 
vulnerabilities, missing patches, and misconfigurations. Which 
of the following should Alice utilize for this purpose? 
(A)       Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
(B)       Network sniffer 
(C)       Vulnerability scanner 
(D)       Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) 
system.  
Explanation 368. Correct Answer: C. Vulnerability scanner. 
Vulnerability scanners are designed to discover and report 
potential vulnerabilities in systems by probing and analyzing 
them. They can detect issues such as missing patches, 
misconfigurations, and known software flaws. 
Option A is incorrect. An IDS detects and alerts on potential 
malicious activities based on specific signatures or heuristics 
but does not proactively scan for vulnerabilities. 
	
 
562

Option B is incorrect. A network sniffer captures and analyzes 
network traffic but does not perform vulnerability assessments 
on infrastructure components. 
Option D is incorrect. While a SIEM system can aggregate and 
analyze log and event data from various sources, it does not 
proactively scan for vulnerabilities like a vulnerability scanner. 
Question 369. Globex Industries is expanding its data centers 
across multiple geographic locations. The IT team wants to have

of all data center infrastructures. Which of the following 
solutions would be the MOST effective for this purpose? 
(A)       Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools 
(B)       Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection 
(C)       Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) 
(D)       Infrastructure Management Platform (IMP) 
Explanation 369. Correct Answer: D. Infrastructure 
Management Platform (IMP). IMPs provide centralized 
control and monitoring for infrastructure across multiple sites. 
They deliver insights into infrastructure health, outages, and 
metrics, ensuring that the IT team can address issues promptly. 
Option A is incorrect. DLP tools focus on preventing 
unauthorized data transfers and exfiltrations, not on monitoring 
infrastructure health and status. 
Option B is incorrect. DDoS protection tools safeguard against 
denial-of-service attacks but aren’t designed to monitor the 
overall health or metrics of data center infrastructures. 
	
 
563

Option C is incorrect. While SIEM solutions centralize log 
data and provide insights into security events, they are not 
designed primarily to monitor data center infrastructure health 
across multiple locations. 
Question 370. The IT department of XYZ Corp is keen on 
preventing users from changing specific system settings, such as 
altering the firewall configurations. The majority of their 
infrastructure is based on Windows operating systems. Which of 
the following would be the most effective way to achieve this? 
(A)       Use SELinux to enforce strict access controls 
(B)       Utilize Group Policy to set and enforce policies 
related to system settings 
(C)       Deploy a third-party software solution to lock system 
settings 
(D)       Implement a user training program to guide users on 
system settings best practices 
Explanation 370. Correct Answer: B. Utilize Group Policy to 
set and enforce policies related to system settings. Group 
Policy provides centralized management and configuration of 
operating systems, applications, and users’ settings in an Active 
Directory environment. This can be used to enforce specific 
policies related to system settings in a Windows environment. 
Option A is incorrect. SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is 
primarily used in Linux environments to enforce mandatory 
access controls. It wouldn’t be appropriate for a primarily 
Windows-based infrastructure. 
	
 
564

Option C is incorrect. While third-party solutions may exist, 
leveraging built-in features like Group Policy is often more 
streamlined, cost-effective, and efficient. 
Option D is incorrect. While user training is essential, relying 
solely on training without implementing technical controls is 
not effective in preventing users from altering system settings. 
Question 371. A company plans to upgrade its email server to 
ensure that email transmission between their mail server and 
client applications is encrypted. Which of the following 
protocols would be the most appropriate for this purpose? 
(A)       HTTP 
(B)       FTP 
(C)       IMAP over SSL/TLS 
(D)       SNMP 
Explanation 371. Correct Answer: C. IMAP over SSL/TLS. 
IMAP over SSL/TLS (commonly known as IMAPS) is a 
protocol used by email clients to retrieve messages from a mail 
server over a secure channel. The use of SSL/TLS provides 
encryption for the transmitted data, ensuring confidentiality of 
the email transmission. 
Option A is incorrect. HTTP is a protocol for transferring web 
content and does not provide encryption by default. 
Furthermore, it’s not designed for email transmission. 
Option B is incorrect. FTP is a protocol for transferring files 
and does not provide secure email transmission capabilities. 
	
 
565

Option C is incorrect. SNMP (Simple Network Management 
Protocol) is used for network management and monitoring, not 
for email transmission. 
Question 372. Lisa, a security administrator, is using a popular 
benchmark to ensure the web servers in her organization are 
configured securely. She wants to make sure that unnecessary 
services are disabled, and appropriate permissions are set. 
Which of the following organizations is MOST likely the source 
of the benchmark she is using? 
(A)       PCI DSS 
(B)       OWASP 
(C)       CIS 
(D)       GDPR 
Explanation 372. Correct Answer: C. CIS. The Center for 
Internet Security (CIS) is known for its CIS Benchmarks, which 
provide prescriptive guidance for configuring systems securely. 
Option A is incorrect. PCI DSS is a set of security standards 
designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, 
or transmit credit card information maintain a secure 
environment. 
Option B is incorrect. OWASP (Open Web Application 
Security Project) is known for its top ten list of web application 
vulnerabilities and not for system configuration benchmarks. 
Option D is incorrect. GDPR (General Data Protection 
Regulation) is a regulation that requires businesses to protect 
	
 
566

the personal data and privacy of EU citizens. It doesn’t provide 
benchmarks for secure system configurations. 
Question 373. The IT department at TechCorp Ltd has been 
instructed to ensure that critical system files remain unchanged 
to avoid potential security breaches. They want to implement a 
system that can provide alerts whenever there is an 
unauthorized change to these files. Which of the following 
would best serve this purpose? 
(A)       Data Loss Prevention (DLP) 
(B)       Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
(C)       File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) 
(D)       Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) 
Explanation 373. Correct Answer: C. File Integrity 
Monitoring (FIM). File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) tools 
monitor and detect changes in files that may indicate a breach, 
malware infection, or other unauthorized activity. By tracking 
and reporting on file change patterns, FIM helps ensure the 
integrity and confidentiality of data. 
Option A is incorrect. Data Loss Prevention (DLP) focuses on 
preventing unauthorized data transfers or leaks from the 
organization, not on monitoring file changes. 
Option B is incorrect. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
primarily detects unauthorized access or attacks on a network. 
While it can identify some unauthorized file changes, it isn’t 
specifically designed for file integrity monitoring. 
	
 
567

Option D is incorrect. Remote Monitoring and Management 
(RMM) tools primarily allow IT professionals to monitor and 
manage endpoints, networks, and computers remotely. They 
don’t specifically focus on file integrity. 
Question 374. ABC Tech has a mixed environment with both 
Linux and Windows servers. They want to ensure that processes 
running on their Linux servers only have access to specific 
resources and are restricted from performing certain actions. 
Which of the following tools would be most appropriate for this 
task? 
(A)       Use Group Policy on their Windows servers and apply it 
to Linux servers 
(B)       Implement a strict user training regimen to inform users 
about security best practices 
(C)       Enable Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) in 
enforcing mode 
(D)       Limit user access to Linux servers 
Explanation 374. Correct Answer: C. Enable Security-
Enhanced Linux (SELinux) in enforcing mode. SELinux 
provides mandatory access controls by limiting the actions a 
process can perform to only those defined in its policy, ensuring 
it only has access to specific resources. By setting SELinux in 
enforcing mode, these policies are actively enforced. 
Option A is incorrect. Group Policy is specific to Windows and 
cannot be applied directly to Linux servers. 
	
 
568

Option B is incorrect. While user training is a good security 
practice, it does not provide the technical control required to 
restrict processes on Linux servers. 
Option D is incorrect. Limiting user access to Linux servers 
does not directly control the actions of processes running on 
those servers. 
Question 375. Sarah, a security administrator, is implementing 
a monitoring solution for her organization’s server 
infrastructure. She wants a solution that does not require any 
additional software to be installed on the servers themselves. 
Which type of monitoring approach should Sarah choose? 
(A)       Agent-based monitoring 
(B)       Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
(C)       Agentless monitoring 
(D)       Network-based Application Performance Monitoring 
(APM) 
Explanation 375. Correct Answer: C. Agentless monitoring. 
Agentless monitoring solutions do not require any software 
agents to be installed on the servers they monitor. They 
typically rely on standard protocols and interfaces to collect 
performance and other data. 
Option A is incorrect. Agent-based monitoring requires the 
installation of software agents on each server or device that is to 
be monitored. 
	
 
569

Option B is incorrect. While an Intrusion Detection System 
(IDS) is a security tool, it is not specifically designed for 
agentless infrastructure monitoring. 
Option D is incorrect. Network-based Application 
Performance Monitoring (APM) is focused on monitoring 
application performance on the network, not on agentless server 
monitoring. 
Question 376. PharmaCorp, a pharmaceutical company, wants 
to ensure that its researchers cannot transfer proprietary 
formulas and research data to external storage devices or cloud 
storage. The company needs a solution to prevent such transfers 
while allowing other types of data to be transferred. What 
should they implement? 
(A)       Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
(B)       Data Encryption Tool 
(C)       Data Loss Prevention (DLP) 
(D)       Virtual Private Network (VPN) 
Explanation 376. Correct Answer: C. Data Loss Prevention 
(DLP). Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is designed to detect 
potential data breach attempts and prevent the unauthorized 
transfer of sensitive data. By setting up rules and criteria in a 
DLP solution, PharmaCorp can restrict the transfer of 
proprietary information while allowing other data to be 
transferred as needed. 
Option A is incorrect. A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is 
used to protect web applications by filtering and monitoring 
	
 
570

HTTP traffic. It does not handle data transfers to external 
storage or cloud storage specifically. 
Option B is incorrect. A Data Encryption Tool encrypts data to 
protect it from unauthorized access. While it adds a layer of 
security, it doesn’t prevent the transfer of data to external 
devices or cloud storage. 
Option D is incorrect. A Virtual Private Network (VPN) 
provides a secure tunnel for data transmission between two 
endpoints. It does not prevent or monitor the type of data being 
transferred. 
Question 377. CyberFirm has been facing issues with phishing 
campaigns where attackers spoof their domain to send 
fraudulent emails. They already implemented DKIM to sign 
their emails but want an additional measure to specify which 
mail servers are authorized to send emails on behalf of their 
domain. Which security measure should CyberFirm adopt? 
(A)       SPF 
(B)       PGP 
(C)       SSL certificate 
(D)       IMAP 
Explanation 377. Correct Answer: A. SPF. Sender Policy 
Framework (SPF) is designed to prevent email spoofing. It 
allows domain owners to specify which mail servers are 
authorized to send emails on behalf of their domain. Receiving 
servers can then verify the sending server against the SPF 
record in the domain’s DNS. 
	
 
571

Option B is incorrect. PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is used for 
encrypting and decrypting texts, emails, files, directories, and 
whole disk partitions, but it doesn’t define authorized mail 
servers for a domain. 
Option C is incorrect. An SSL certificate provides a secure 
connection between a user’s web browser and a website, 
ensuring data confidentiality. It’s not specifically designed to 
validate the sending mail servers of a domain. 
Option D is incorrect. IMAP (Internet Message Access 
Protocol) is a protocol used by email clients to retrieve 
messages from a mail server. It doesn’t help in specifying 
authorized mail servers for a domain. 
Question 378. A school wants to prevent its students from 
accessing inappropriate websites during class hours. The IT 
department decides to implement a solution that blocks requests 
to specific domain names associated with inappropriate content. 
Which of the following security solutions would best address 
this need? 
(A)       Firewall filtering based on IP addresses 
(B)       Intrusion Detection System monitoring 
(C)       Virtual Private Network (VPN) enforcement 
(D)       DNS filtering with a blacklist 
Explanation 378. Correct Answer: D. DNS filtering with a 
blacklist. DNS filtering is a technique that can be used to 
prevent users from accessing specific websites by blocking 
requests to certain domain names. A blacklist can be created to 
list the domain names associated with inappropriate content, 
	
 
572

and when users try to access these sites, the DNS filter will not 
resolve the domain name, thereby preventing access. 
Option A is incorrect. While firewalls can block traffic based 
on IP addresses, this method is not as effective for blocking 
specific domain names, especially when a domain can have 
multiple IP addresses or if the IPs can change. 
Option B is incorrect. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are 
primarily used for detecting and alerting on malicious activities 
but not for blocking access to specific domain names. 
Option C is incorrect. VPNs are used to create a secure 
communication channel and are not inherently designed to 
block domain name resolutions. 
Question 379. A large financial institution recently experienced 
a security breach where an attacker was able to bypass its 
intrusion detection system (IDS). Upon investigation, the 
security team found out that the attacker utilized a zero-day 
exploit. In the aftermath, what should the institution do to 
enhance the capability of its IDS? 
(A)       Switch from a signature-based IDS to a behavior-
based IDS 
(B)       Disable the IDS and rely solely on firewall rules 
(C)       Update the IDS with the latest threat intelligence feeds 
and signatures 
(D)       Reduce the frequency of IDS signature updates 
Explanation 379. Correct Answer: A. Switch from a 
signature-based IDS to a behavior-based IDS. Behavior-
	
 
573

based IDS (or anomaly-based IDS) monitors network traffic and 
compares it against an established baseline, allowing it to 
potentially detect zero-day exploits and other novel attacks that 
signature-based systems might miss. 
Option B is incorrect. Relying solely on firewall rules without 
IDS would lessen the security depth and expose the institution 
to more risks. 
Option C is incorrect. While updating the IDS with the latest 
signatures is important, it wouldn’t necessarily detect zero-day 
exploits until a signature for that exploit has been created and 
disseminated. 
Option D is incorrect. Reducing the frequency of IDS 
signature updates would make the system even more vulnerable 
to recent threats. 
Question 380. A security analyst at CyberSecure Corp. reviews 
a vulnerability report concerning an application that could allow 
attackers to upload malicious scripts. Once these scripts are 
executed, they can grant attackers complete control over the 
application. How should this vulnerability be primarily 
classified? 
(A)       Integrity vulnerability 
(B)       Availability vulnerability 
(C)       Remote code execution vulnerability 
(D)       Disclosure vulnerability 
Explanation 380. Correct Answer: C. Remote code 
execution vulnerability. Remote code execution (RCE) 
	
 
574

vulnerabilities allow attackers to run arbitrary commands or 
scripts on a targeted system. In the scenario, the application 
vulnerability grants attackers the ability to upload and execute 
malicious scripts, which aligns with this classification. 
Option A is incorrect. While the vulnerability can affect the 
integrity of the application, the primary concern here is the 
ability of attackers to execute code remotely, making it an RCE 
vulnerability. 
Option B is incorrect. Availability vulnerabilities primarily 
concern the disruption of services or systems, preventing 
authorized users from accessing them. The scenario doesn’t 
indicate any disruption of availability. 
Option D is incorrect. Disclosure vulnerabilities involve 
unauthorized viewing or accessing of information. The 
described vulnerability goes beyond mere disclosure, allowing 
execution of malicious scripts. 
Question 381. After a recent security incident in the 
organization, the IT team noticed that several legitimate 
activities were being flagged by the intrusion detection system, 
resulting in a high number of false positives. What is the MOST 
appropriate action to improve the system’s accuracy and reduce 
unnecessary alerts? 
(A)       Disable the intrusion detection system for a week to 
observe regular network traffic patterns 
(B)       Set up a stricter firewall rule to block all external traffic 
(C)       Implement alert tuning to refine the system's 
	
 
575

detection criteria 
(D)       Encourage employees to reduce their internet usage 
Explanation 381. Correct Answer: C. Implement alert 
tuning to refine the system’s detection criteria. Alert tuning 
involves adjusting the detection rules or criteria of a system to 
better differentiate between legitimate and malicious activities, 
thereby reducing false positives. 
Option A is incorrect. Disabling the intrusion detection system 
can expose the organization to real threats, making it a risky 
approach. 
Option B is incorrect. Setting up stricter firewall rules doesn’t 
directly address the issue of false positives from the intrusion 
detection system and could block legitimate business 
operations. 
Option D is incorrect. Reducing internet usage does not 
necessarily correlate with a decrease in false positives. The 
issue lies with the system’s criteria, not the amount of traffic. 
Question 382. ABC Corp has recently faced a security breach 
due to a contractor connecting an infected laptop to the 
corporate network. Management wants to implement a solution 
that would ensure that any device connecting to the corporate 
network meets the company’s security standards, including up-
to-date antivirus definitions. Which solution should ABC Corp 
consider? 
(A)       Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
(B)       Virtual Private Network (VPN) 
	
 
576

(C)       Network Access Control (NAC) 
(D)       Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
Explanation 382. Correct Answer: C. Network Access 
Control (NAC). Network Access Control (NAC) allows 
organizations to set policies for device connectivity to corporate 
networks. NAC can assess the security posture of a device 
before it connects to ensure it meets predefined criteria, such as 
updated antivirus definitions, required patches, etc. 
Option A is incorrect. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
monitors network traffic for suspicious activities and issues 
alerts but does not evaluate device security postures before 
allowing network access. 
Option B is incorrect. A Virtual Private Network (VPN) allows 
secure remote access to a network but does not inherently 
evaluate the security posture of devices. 
Option D is incorrect. A Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
focuses on protecting web applications by monitoring and 
filtering HTTP traffic. It is not used for evaluating device 
security postures. 
Question 383. Global Corp received a report that some of its 
customers received phishing emails that seemed to originate 
from the company’s domain. The IT team checked and 
confirmed that SPF and DKIM configurations were correctly 
set. What additional email security measure can Global Corp 
implement to provide clear policies on how the emails should 
be treated if they don’t align with SPF and DKIM? 
	
 
577

(A)       Enabling TLS encryption 
(B)       Implementing DMARC policies 
(C)       Setting up a new SMTP server 
(D)       Increasing email retention period 
Explanation 383. Correct Answer: B. Implementing 
DMARC policies. By implementing DMARC policies, Global 
Corp can define how email receivers should handle emails from 
its domain that don’t align with the specified SPF and DKIM 
records. DMARC can be set to monitor, quarantine, or reject 
emails that fail these checks, providing more robust protection 
against email spoofing and phishing. 
Option A is incorrect. While TLS encryption is essential for 
protecting the content of email in transit, it doesn’t address the 
issue of spoofing or provide guidelines on how to handle emails 
that don’t match SPF and DKIM. 
Option C is incorrect. Setting up a new SMTP server can help 
with sending emails, but it doesn’t inherently protect against 
email spoofing or provide guidance for emails that don’t align 
with SPF and DKIM. 
Option D is incorrect. Increasing the email retention period 
affects how long emails are stored but doesn’t offer protection 
against spoofing or guidance for handling misaligned emails. 
Question 384. A financial firm has just experienced a cyber 
attack, and the IT team identified a piece of malware that 
evaded their traditional antivirus solutions. The CISO now 
wants to not only detect but also be able to analyze and respond 
	
 
578

to such advanced threats in real-time. Which solution should the 
firm consider implementing? 
(A)       Vulnerability Scanner 
(B)       Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) 
(C)       Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) 
(D)       Patch Management System 
Explanation 384. Correct Answer: C. Endpoint Detection 
and Response (EDR). Endpoint Detection and Response 
(EDR) provides real-time monitoring and analysis of endpoint 
events, allowing an organization to detect, investigate, and 
respond to potential security threats. EDR tools can identify 
behaviors that might indicate advanced threats that evade 
traditional antivirus solutions. 
Option A is incorrect. Vulnerability Scanners are used to 
identify vulnerabilities in a system or network but do not 
provide real-time monitoring and response capabilities for 
threats. 
Option B is incorrect. Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) 
monitor network traffic to prevent potential threats, but they 
might not provide in-depth analysis and response at the 
endpoint level like EDR solutions do. 
Option D is incorrect. Patch Management Systems are used to 
manage the distribution and installation of software updates but 
do not offer real-time threat detection and response. 
Question 385. After the recent cyber-attack on Acme Corp, the 
IT security team decided to enhance their proactive defense 
	
 
579

mechanism. They want to start with identifying unpatched and 
vulnerable systems on their network. Which of the following 
scanning activities would BEST assist them in this endeavor? 
(A)       Conducting a passive scan during business hours 
(B)       Implementing a full open port scan on all systems 
(C)       Running a credentialed vulnerability scan on their 
network 
(D)       Scanning the external perimeter for domain name 
resolutions 
Explanation 385. Correct Answer: C. Running a 
credentialed vulnerability scan on their network. A 
credentialed vulnerability scan uses valid user credentials to 
access and scan the target system, allowing for a deeper and 
more comprehensive check for vulnerabilities, including 
unpatched systems. 
Option A is incorrect. A passive scan is non-intrusive and only 
monitors network traffic, limiting its capability to identify 
unpatched systems actively. 
Option B is incorrect. While a full open port scan can identify 
open ports, it doesn’t necessarily identify unpatched systems or 
specific vulnerabilities. 
Option D is incorrect. Scanning the external perimeter for 
domain name resolutions can help in gathering information 
about domain names but won’t directly assist in identifying 
unpatched systems. 
	
 
580

Question 386. A software developer in a company notices that a 
legitimate software tool they use is repeatedly flagged and 
quarantined by the company’s security solution. Which of the 
following is the BEST action the cybersecurity team can take to 
address this without compromising security? 
(A)       Turn off the antivirus solution 
(B)       Whitelist the software tool in the antivirus settings 
(C)       Decrease the security level of the antivirus 
(D)       Install a different antivirus solution 
Explanation 386. Correct Answer: B. Whitelist the software 
tool in the antivirus settings. Whitelisting allows the 
cybersecurity team to specify software or applications that are 
considered safe and should not be flagged or quarantined by the 
antivirus solution. 
Option A is incorrect. Turning off the antivirus solution would 
leave the system vulnerable to malware and other malicious 
threats. 
Option C is incorrect. Decreasing the security level of the 
antivirus might reduce its effectiveness in detecting and 
blocking genuine threats. 
Option D is incorrect. Simply installing a different antivirus 
solution does not guarantee that the tool won’t be flagged again, 
and frequent switches can also be costly and time-consuming. 
Question 387. AlphaTech, a growing SaaS company, has 
multiple applications deployed across different cloud providers. 
The security team struggles to manage and analyze logs from 
	
 
581

these disparate sources. Which solution would BEST help 
AlphaTech centralize their logs for a more streamlined analysis? 
(A)       Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) 
(B)       Log Aggregation Tool 
(C)       Data Loss Prevention (DLP) software 
(D)       Vulnerability Scanner 
Explanation 387. Correct Answer: B. Log Aggregation Tool. 
Log aggregation tools are specifically designed to gather, 
centralize, and manage logs from various sources, making it 
easier to analyze and correlate events. 
Option A is incorrect. While a NIDS can help detect malicious 
activity on a network, it doesn’t centralize logs from different 
application sources. 
Option C is incorrect. DLP software focuses on preventing 
unauthorized data transfers and does not serve the purpose of 
centralizing logs. 
Option D is incorrect. Vulnerability Scanners are designed to 
identify vulnerabilities in a system but don’t aggregate logs 
from various sources. 
Question 388. BetaTech, a tech manufacturing firm, wants to 
ensure that a potential compromise of its IoT devices will not 
endanger its primary manufacturing control systems. Which of 
the following approaches would be most effective in achieving 
this? 
(A)       Using a single robust firewall for the entire network 
(B)       Periodic password changes for IoT devices 
	
 
582

(C)       Segmenting the IoT devices from the manufacturing 
control systems 
(D)       Enabling automatic updates for all IoT devices 
Explanation 388. Correct Answer: C. Segmenting the IoT 
devices from the manufacturing control systems. By 
segmenting the IoT devices from the primary manufacturing 
control systems, BetaTech ensures that a compromise of the IoT 
devices doesn’t immediately put the control systems at risk. 
Segmentation acts as a barrier to restrict the potential spread of 
malicious activity. 
Option A is incorrect. While a robust firewall is crucial for 
network security, it does not replace the need for segmentation, 
especially with varied devices and risk profiles. 
Option B is incorrect. Although periodic password changes 
can enhance the security of IoT devices, it does not prevent a 
compromised IoT device from affecting other parts of the 
network. 
Option D is incorrect. Automatic updates can fix known 
vulnerabilities in IoT devices, but they don’t provide the 
isolation that segmentation offers to prevent a compromise from 
affecting other network segments. 
Question 389. A global manufacturing company wants to 
ensure its employees worldwide do not access websites 
promoting hate speech, gambling, or explicit content during 
working hours. To meet this requirement, which web filtering 
technique would be the most efficient? 
	
 
583

(A)       Deploy a centralized proxy with location-based filtering 
(B)       Use a blacklist of specific URLs known to contain such 
content 
(C)       Implement content categorization and block 
undesired categories 
(D)       Monitor internet usage logs and reprimand violators 
Explanation 389. Correct Answer: C. Implement content 
categorization and block undesired categories. Content 
categorization is a technique where websites are categorized 
based on their content type, such as “gaming,” “social media,” 
“news,” etc. By using this technique, organizations can block 
entire categories of content, such as “hate speech” or 
“gambling,” ensuring broad coverage without the need to 
identify every problematic URL individually. 
Option A is incorrect. While centralized proxies can help 
manage internet access, location-based filtering focuses more 
on geographic locations rather than content categories. 
Option B is incorrect. Relying solely on a blacklist can be 
inefficient, as it requires constant updates to catch every 
possible harmful URL, and it might not cover newly created 
sites quickly enough. 
Option D is incorrect. Simply monitoring internet usage logs 
and reprimanding violators is reactive and does not proactively 
prevent access to undesired content. 
Question 390. TechCo, a medium-sized enterprise, is planning 
to implement a solution to monitor, control, and restrict web 
	
 
584

access for its employees to improve productivity and enhance 
security. They also want to cache frequently accessed web 
content to reduce bandwidth consumption. Which solution 
would BEST fit TechCo’s requirements? 
(A)       Deploy a decentralized proxy on each departmental 
network 
(B)       Set up a DNS-based filtering service 
(C)       Use a centralized proxy with caching capabilities 
(D)       Recommend browser extensions for web filtering to all 
employees 
Explanation 390. Correct Answer: C. Use a centralized 
proxy with caching capabilities. A centralized proxy allows 
organizations to filter, monitor, and control web access from a 
central point. Additionally, proxies with caching capabilities can 
store frequently accessed web content, reducing the need for 
repeated downloads and thus saving bandwidth. 
Option A is incorrect. A decentralized approach would make it 
challenging to consistently apply and enforce policies across the 
enterprise. It may also lead to inefficiencies in bandwidth usage 
as content caching would not be centralized. 
Option B is incorrect. While a DNS-based filtering service can 
help in blocking access to certain malicious or inappropriate 
sites, it does not offer the centralized control or caching 
capabilities that a proxy does. 
Option D is incorrect. Relying on browser extensions is a 
decentralized method that depends on user compliance and may 
not provide centralized control or caching capabilities.

Question 391. An organization is planning to deploy a new web 
application that will be accessible from both the internal 
network and the internet. The application will communicate 
exclusively over HTTPS. The security administrator is asked to 
configure the firewall to allow the necessary traffic. Which of 
the following should the administrator configure? 
(A)       Allow port 21 and block all others 
(B)       Allow port 443 and block all others 
(C)       Allow port 80 and block all others 
(D)       Allow port 23 and block all others 
Explanation 391. Correct Answer: B. Allow port 443 and 
block all others. HTTPS primarily uses port 443 for secure 
communication. Thus, allowing port 443 and blocking all others 
would ensure the secure operation of the web application. 
Option A is incorrect. Port 21 is used for FTP (File Transfer 
Protocol), which is not relevant to HTTPS communication. 
Option C is incorrect. While port 80 is used for HTTP, it does 
not provide the encryption that HTTPS does on port 443. 
Option D is incorrect. Port 23 is used for Telnet, which is 
unrelated to secure web communication. 
Question 392. The company’s security administrator observes 
that there are multiple unauthorized access attempts originating 
from IP addresses in a specific range. The administrator wants 
to prevent these IP addresses from accessing the corporate 
network temporarily. Which of the following firewall 
configurations would BEST address this requirement? 
	
 
586

(A)       Configure an implicit deny rule for the specific IP 
range 
(B)       Set up a honeypot for the specific IP range 
(C)       Allow the IP range but set a bandwidth limit 
(D)       Add the IP range to a whitelist 
Explanation 392. Correct Answer: A. Configure an implicit 
deny rule for the specific IP range. By configuring an implicit 
deny rule for that specific IP range, the firewall will block any 
traffic from those addresses, preventing them from accessing 
the network. 
Option B is incorrect. While a honeypot can be used to 
monitor and analyze attacker behavior, it does not block the 
access of the specified IP range to the corporate network. 
Option C is incorrect. Allowing the IP range and setting a 
bandwidth limit would not prevent access; it would only restrict 
the amount of data they could send/receive. 
Option D is incorrect. Adding the IP range to a whitelist would 
grant them access, which is opposite to the required action. 
Question 393. The IT department of Globex Corp is concerned 
about the increasing number of malicious websites being 
accessed from company laptops while employees are working 
remotely. They want to ensure that the web filter policies set in 
the corporate network are enforced even when devices are 
offsite. What would be the BEST solution to address this 
concern? 
(A)       Implement a cloud-based web filtering solution 
	
 
587

(B)       Use a VPN to force all remote traffic through the 
corporate network 
(C)       Deploy an agent-based web filter on all company 
laptops 
(D)       Periodically send reminders to employees about 
acceptable web usage 
Explanation 393. Correct Answer: C. Deploy an agent-based 
web filter on all company laptops. Agent-based web filters 
can enforce web filtering policies on a device regardless of its 
location. This ensures that the policies apply consistently 
whether the device is on or off the corporate network. 
Option A is incorrect. While cloud-based solutions can offer 
offsite filtering, they might not be as consistent as an agent-
based solution that directly enforces corporate policies on the 
device itself. 
Option B is incorrect. Using a VPN would force all traffic 
through the corporate network, which could cause latency and 
might not be feasible for all remote work scenarios. 
Option D is incorrect. Sending reminders is a passive approach 
and may not effectively prevent access to malicious websites. 
Question 394.Lisa, a cybersecurity analyst, is setting up a 
centralized system to correlate logs from multiple sources, 
detect malicious activities in real-time, and produce 
comprehensive security reports. Which tool should Lisa 
consider for this purpose? 
(A)       Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) 
	
 
588

(B)       Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
(C)       Vulnerability Scanner 
(D)       Security Information and Event Management 
(SIEM) 
Explanation 394. Correct Answer: D. Security Information 
and Event Management (SIEM). SIEM tools are designed to 
aggregate, correlate, and analyze logs and events from various 
sources in an organization. They help in detecting and 
responding to security incidents in real-time and generating 
detailed security reports. 
Option A is incorrect. While NIDS monitors and analyzes 
network traffic for signs of malicious activities, it doesn’t 
provide centralized logging and reporting functionalities like a 
SIEM. 
Option B is incorrect. A Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
protects web applications from web-based attacks. It does not 
offer the centralized log correlation and analysis features of a 
SIEM. 
Option C is incorrect. A Vulnerability Scanner identifies 
vulnerabilities in systems and applications but doesn’t aggregate 
and analyze logs from various sources. 
Question 395. Lucy, the IT security manager of a financial 
company, receives an automated alert that an employee 
attempted to email a document containing social security 
numbers to an external email address. Which of the following 
tools most likely generated this alert? 
	
 
589

(A)       Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) 
(B)       Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solution 
(C)       Vulnerability Scanner 
(D)       Packet Analyzer 
Explanation 395. Correct Answer: B. Data Loss Prevention 
(DLP) solution. DLP solutions are specifically designed to 
monitor and control data transfers across an organization’s 
network. In this case, the DLP detected sensitive data—social 
security numbers—being sent outside of the organization and 
alerted Lucy. 
Option A is incorrect. NIDS detects and alerts on malicious 
activity on a network, but it doesn’t typically scan for specific 
data types being transferred. 
Option C is incorrect. Vulnerability scanners identify and 
report on vulnerabilities in a system but don’t monitor data 
transfers. 
Option D is incorrect. While packet analyzers can capture and 
analyze network traffic, they don’t inherently generate alerts 
based on the specific content of data being transferred. 
Question 396. An online banking platform wants to improve its 
customer verification process when users open a new account. 
Which of the following identity proofing methods would be the 
MOST secure for this purpose? 
(A)       Asking users to select a security question and answer 
from a list 
(B)       Requiring users to upload a photo of a government-
	
 
590

issued ID and a selfie 
(C)       Sending a verification code to the user's email address 
(D)       Prompting users to provide their favorite color 
Explanation 396. Correct Answer: B. Requiring users to 
upload a photo of a government-issued ID and a selfie. This 
method provides a high level of assurance by comparing a 
user’s live image (selfie) with a government-issued ID. The 
combination ensures the person is who they claim to be. 
Option A is incorrect. Security questions, especially from a 
pre-defined list, can be easily guessed or obtained by attackers. 
Option C is incorrect. Verification codes via email can 
enhance identity proofing but aren’t as robust as checking 
against a government ID and selfie. 
Option D is incorrect. Personal preferences, like favorite 
colors, are weak indicators of identity and can be easily 
guessed. 
Question 397. A company has recently noticed an increased 
number of employees accessing social media sites during work 
hours, leading to decreased productivity. To counter this, the 
security administrator decides to limit access to these websites 
during peak working hours. Which firewall rule modification 
should the administrator make? 
(A)       Implement an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to 
block social media content 
(B)       Change the firewall rule to deny access to known 
social media IP addresses between 9 AM and 5 PM 
	
 
591

(C)       Use the firewall's URL filtering capability to blacklist 
social media URLs 
(D)       Increase the firewall's bandwidth to accommodate the 
excess traffic 
Explanation 397. Correct Answer: B. Change the firewall 
rule to deny access to known social media IP addresses 
between 9 AM and 5 PM. Implementing a time-based rule that 
denies access to specific IP addresses (or ranges) associated 
with social media can be an effective way to restrict access 
during specified hours. 
Option A is incorrect. An IPS is designed to detect and prevent 
malicious activities based on signatures. Blocking social media 
content is not typically its primary function. 
Option C is incorrect. URL filtering would block access to the 
URLs entirely. The requirement is to block them only during 
specific hours. 
Option D is incorrect. Increasing the firewall’s bandwidth 
doesn’t address the problem of employees accessing social 
media during work hours. 
Question 398. A company wants to host a public-facing website 
but ensure that even if the website gets compromised, attackers 
cannot gain access to sensitive internal data. Which of the 
following is the BEST configuration to achieve this? 
(A)       Place the web server on the internal network and strictly 
monitor the traffic 
(B)       Place the web server in the DMZ with a firewall in 
	
 
592

front of it and another firewall between the DMZ and the 
internal network 
(C)       Directly connect the web server to the internet without a 
firewall and move sensitive data off the server 
(D)       Place the web server in the DMZ and connect it directly 
to the internal network without a firewall 
Explanation 398. Correct Answer: B. Place the web server 
in the DMZ with a firewall in front of it and another firewall 
between the DMZ and the internal network. By placing the 
web server in a DMZ, and having two firewalls (one facing the 
internet and another facing the internal network), the company 
can ensure that even if the public-facing web server is 
compromised, the attacker would still need to bypass another 
firewall to reach the internal network. 
Option A is incorrect. Placing a public-facing web server on 
the internal network, even with monitoring, exposes the 
network to unnecessary risks. 
Option C is incorrect. Connecting a server directly to the 
internet without any form of firewall is highly risky, even if 
sensitive data is moved. 
Option D is incorrect. Without a firewall between the DMZ 
and the internal network, it becomes much easier for a 
compromised server in the DMZ to impact or access the internal 
network. 
Question 399. A Security Analyst at BetaTech is reviewing the 
monitoring tools deployed across the organization. She wants to 
	
 
593

ensure that every tool can detect unauthorized changes made to 
system files and configurations. Which of the following tools is 
BEST suited for this purpose? 
(A)       Network protocol analyzer 
(B)       File integrity monitoring (FIM) system 
(C)       Bandwidth monitoring tool 
(D)       Passive vulnerability scanner 
Explanation 399. Correct Answer: B. File integrity 
monitoring (FIM) system. File integrity monitoring systems 
are designed to detect and alert when unauthorized changes are 
made to system files and configurations, ensuring the integrity 
of these critical components. 
Option A is incorrect. While network protocol analyzers can 
capture and analyze network traffic, they are not specifically 
designed to monitor changes to system files and configurations. 
Option C is incorrect. Bandwidth monitoring tools primarily 
track network usage and bandwidth consumption, not 
modifications to system files. 
Option D is incorrect. Passive vulnerability scanners monitor 
network traffic to detect vulnerabilities but do not actively track 
changes to system files. 
Question 400. A company has noticed an increase in malware 
infections over the past month. After investigating, it was 
determined that the infections were caused by employees 
visiting websites that were newly registered but had malicious 
intent. Which of the following would be the BEST approach to 
	
 
594

mitigate this threat? 
(A)       Implement a block rule to deny access to all websites 
(B)       Use a web filter that incorporates domain reputation 
checks and blocks domains registered recently 
(C)       Set the web filter to block all websites not categorized 
as "Business" 
(D)       Enforce multi-factor authentication for all internet-
based applications 
Explanation 400. Correct Answer: B. Use a web filter that 
incorporates domain reputation checks and blocks domains 
registered recently. Reputation-based web filters can evaluate 
the trustworthiness of domains. One common heuristic is to be 
suspicious of newly registered domains, as cybercriminals often 
use these for phishing or malware distribution. 
Option A is incorrect. Blocking access to all websites is an 
extreme measure that would hinder business operations and 
employee productivity. 
Option C is incorrect. Simply blocking websites not 
categorized as “Business” does not specifically target the threat 
of newly registered malicious domains. Additionally, some 
business-relevant websites might not be categorized properly. 
Option D is incorrect. While multi-factor authentication can 
enhance security, it does not address the threat of employees 
visiting malicious websites. 
Question 401. At AlphaTech, the security team is assessing 
vulnerabilities in a newly deployed cloud infrastructure. While 
	
 
595

analyzing potential risks, they consider factors such as the 
physical location of data centers, local laws and regulations, and 
natural disaster frequencies. What are these considerations 
known as in the context of vulnerability management? 
(A)       Asset valuation factors 
(B)       Risk response variables 
(C)       Threat intelligence variables 
(D)       Environmental variables 
Explanation 401. Correct Answer: D. Environmental 
variables. Environmental variables in vulnerability 
management refer to external factors that can influence or affect 
the security posture of an organization. These can include 
physical location, local laws and regulations, and the potential 
for natural disasters. 
Option A is incorrect. Asset valuation factors primarily deal 
with determining the value of an asset to the organization and 
don’t typically consider external factors like local laws or 
natural disaster frequencies. 
Option B is incorrect. Risk response variables pertain to the 
organization’s strategies and actions to respond to identified 
risks rather than the external factors influencing risk. 
Option C is incorrect. Threat intelligence variables revolve 
around information regarding potential threats or threat actors. 
They don’t typically encompass physical environment 
considerations like those described in the scenario. 
	
 
596

Question 402. Caroline, a security analyst, receives an alert that 
an unfamiliar file has been detected on a mission-critical server. 
She suspects it might be malware. What is the BEST immediate 
action Caroline should take regarding this potential threat? 
(A)       Delete the file immediately to prevent further damage 
(B)       Quarantine the file to prevent it from executing or 
spreading 
(C)       Make a copy of the file for further analysis 
(D)       Notify all employees about the suspicious file 
Explanation 402. Correct Answer: B. Quarantine the file to 
prevent it from executing or spreading. Quarantining 
suspicious files isolates them, preventing potential execution or 
spread while allowing further investigation without immediate 
deletion. 
Option A is incorrect. While deleting the file seems proactive, 
it removes the chance for further analysis and can affect 
forensic investigations. 
Option C is incorrect. Making a copy is important for analysis, 
but the immediate priority should be to prevent potential 
execution or spread of the suspicious file. Quarantine first, then 
analyze. 
Option D is incorrect. Notifying all employees about a specific 
suspicious file may cause panic or confusion. It’s more 
appropriate to manage the incident first and then communicate 
relevant information in a structured manner. 
	
 
597

Question 403. Jennifer, an IT administrator, is asked to onboard 
a new remote employee for a sales role. Which of the following 
is the BEST approach for provisioning the user account? 
(A)       Assign the new user the same access privileges as the 
CEO because they might require all resources 
(B)       Provide the new user with administrative rights to 
ensure they can install and configure any needed software 
(C)       Use the access privileges from a template of a 
salesperson to provide the required resources 
(D)       Allow the new user to decide and self-select the 
necessary access based on their job role 
Explanation 403. Correct Answer: C. Use the access 
privileges from a template of a salesperson to provide the 
required resources. Provisioning users based on role templates 
ensures that users have just the access they need, adhering to the 
principle of least privilege. 
Option A is incorrect. This goes against the principle of least 
privilege and can introduce significant security risks. 
Option B is incorrect. Giving administrative rights to 
employees without a proper need can expose the organization to 
unnecessary risks. 
Option D is incorrect. Users should not self-select access 
rights as they might not be aware of potential security 
implications. 
Question 404. AlphaTech, a leading IT company, recently 
identified a critical vulnerability in its primary software product. 
	
 
598

They have developed a patch to address the vulnerability. 
Before distributing the patch to its customers, which of the 
following should AlphaTech ideally perform? 
(A)       Deploy the patch on all company systems 
(B)       Notify the media about the vulnerability 
(C)       Test the patch in a controlled environment 
(D)       Offer compensation to affected customers 
Explanation 404. Correct Answer: C. Test the patch in a 
controlled environment. Before deploying or distributing a 
patch, especially for a critical vulnerability, it’s essential to test 
it in a controlled environment. This ensures that the patch 
doesn’t introduce new issues and that it effectively addresses 
the vulnerability. 
Option A is incorrect. Deploying the patch immediately on all 
company systems without testing it could lead to unforeseen 
issues or even exacerbate the problem. 
Option B is incorrect. Notifying the media about the 
vulnerability, especially before it’s been effectively addressed 
and without a coordinated disclosure plan, can lead to panic and 
potential exploitation by malicious actors. 
Option D is incorrect. Offering compensation is reactive and 
doesn’t directly address the vulnerability. The primary goal after 
identifying a vulnerability should be to address and mitigate it. 
Question 405. After a major security incident, DeltaTech 
implemented several security patches to address vulnerabilities 
in their infrastructure. To ensure the effectiveness of these 
	
 
599

patches, what should be DeltaTech’s primary next step? 
(A)       Deploy additional firewalls at the network perimeter 
(B)       Provide cybersecurity training to all employees 
(C)       Rescan the systems to check if vulnerabilities are 
effectively addressed 
(D)       Change all user passwords across the organization 
Explanation 405. Correct Answer: C. Rescan the systems to 
check if vulnerabilities are effectively addressed. After 
implementing security patches, it’s essential to rescan the 
systems to ensure that the identified vulnerabilities have been 
effectively addressed and the patches have been implemented 
correctly. 
Option A is incorrect. While firewalls are crucial for security, 
deploying them is not directly related to validating the 
effectiveness of newly implemented patches. 
Option B is incorrect. Cybersecurity training for employees is 
vital, but it doesn’t directly validate the success of the applied 
patches. 
Option D is incorrect. Changing user passwords can be a 
necessary step after a breach, but it doesn’t validate if the 
patches have successfully addressed vulnerabilities. 
Question 406. An e-commerce company is rolling out a new 
web application to facilitate online payments. The IT 
department wants to be immediately notified of any application 
errors or unauthorized modifications to the application’s 
codebase. Which of the following tools should they implement? 
	
 
600

(A)       Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
(B)       Application Performance Monitoring (APM) 
(C)       Domain Name System (DNS) monitoring tool 
(D)       Network flow analyzer 
Explanation 406. Correct Answer: B. Application 
Performance Monitoring (APM). APM tools are designed to 
monitor the performance of applications and can detect 
application errors, anomalies, and unauthorized code changes, 
thereby ensuring application stability and security. 
Option A is incorrect. While a WAF protects web applications 
from various cyber threats by filtering and monitoring HTTP 
traffic, it doesn’t typically monitor for application errors or 
unauthorized code changes. 
Option C is incorrect. DNS monitoring tools focus on ensuring 
the availability and integrity of DNS services and do not 
monitor application performance or codebase changes. 
Option D is incorrect. Network flow analyzers examine data 
flows on the network but do not specifically monitor application 
performance or codebase modifications. 
Question 407. Paul, a network administrator, has configured 
various networking devices in his organization to send alerts in 
the event of specific failures. After a switch experienced a 
power supply failure, Paul received an immediate notification. 
Which of the following did Paul most likely utilize to receive 
this notification? 
(A)       Syslog server 
	
 
601

(B)       Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) 
traps 
(C)       Packet sniffer 
(D)       Firewall logs  
Explanation 407. Correct Answer: B. Simple Network 
Management Protocol (SNMP) traps. SNMP traps are 
unsolicited alert messages sent by a device to notify an SNMP 
management station of specific events. In this case, the switch 
sent an SNMP trap to Paul when it detected the power supply 
failure. 
Option A is incorrect. While a Syslog server can be used to 
collect logs from various devices, it doesn’t proactively send 
alerts based on specific events like an SNMP trap does. 
Option C is incorrect. A packet sniffer captures and analyzes 
network traffic but doesn’t actively alert administrators to 
specific device events. 
Option D is incorrect. Firewall logs are specific to firewalls 
and track traffic that passes through the firewall, but they don’t 
typically send unsolicited alerts about network device health. 
Question 408. DeltaCorp, a retail company, has assessed that a 
security breach might result in a loss of $1 million in sales. The 
company has determined that they can tolerate a loss of up to 
$500,000, but anything beyond that would severely impact 
operations. To cover the potential financial loss beyond their 
tolerance level, they decide to purchase cybersecurity insurance. 
Which of the following terms best describes the $500,000 
	
 
602

figure? 
(A)       Risk appetite 
(B)       Risk threshold 
(C)       Risk capacity 
(D)       Risk assessment 
Explanation 408. Correct Answer: B. Risk threshold. The 
risk threshold is the specific level of risk an organization is 
willing to accept. In this case, DeltaCorp is willing to accept 
potential losses up to $500,000, marking that as their threshold. 
Option A is incorrect. Risk appetite is a broader term that 
reflects the general level of risk an organization is willing to 
accept in pursuit of its objectives. It’s more about strategic 
intent than specific figures. 
Option C is incorrect. Risk capacity refers to the total amount 
of risk an organization can absorb without significantly 
impacting its strategic objectives or viability. It’s a broader 
measure than the specific tolerance threshold. 
Option D is incorrect. Risk assessment is the process of 
identifying, analyzing, and evaluating risks. It’s not a specific 
figure or threshold. 
Question 409. Samantha, a security analyst, has been tasked 
with creating a monthly report for senior management detailing 
the security posture of the company. Which of the following is 
the MOST important element to include to ensure the report 
effectively communicates the company’s current security status? 
(A)       Detailed technical logs of all security incidents 
	
 
603

(B)       Graphical representation of incidents by category 
(C)       A complete list of all users and their access levels 
(D)       Copies of recent phishing emails for demonstration 
Explanation 409. Correct Answer: B. Graphical 
representation of incidents by category. A graphical 
representation by category allows senior management to quickly 
understand the types and frequency of security incidents, which 
can help in decision-making and resource allocation. 
Option A is incorrect. While technical logs are crucial for 
incident analysis, they may be too detailed and technical for a 
senior management report. 
Option C is incorrect. While it’s essential to manage user 
access levels, a complete list of all users and their access might 
be excessive for a monthly senior management report focused 
on the company’s security posture. 
Option D is incorrect. While examples of phishing emails can 
be educational, they are not crucial for a monthly report meant 
to provide an overview of the company’s security status. 
Question 410. After a recent security incident, Sarah, a network 
security analyst, wants to analyze the flow data of network 
traffic to identify patterns and potential threats. She wants to 
collect metadata about IP traffic flow and gather details like IP 
addresses, ports, and protocols used. Which tool should Sarah 
employ to obtain this information? 
(A)       Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
(B)       Syslog server 
	
 
604

(C)       NetFlow collector 
(D)       Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) traps 
Explanation 410. Correct Answer: C. NetFlow collector. 
NetFlow is a network protocol developed by Cisco for 
collecting IP traffic information and monitoring network traffic. 
A NetFlow collector can provide insights into traffic flow 
patterns and volume, making it suitable for Sarah’s 
requirements. 
Option A is incorrect. While an IDS can provide alerts on 
malicious activities based on specific signatures or heuristics, it 
does not provide detailed flow data analysis like NetFlow. 
Option B is incorrect. A Syslog server is mainly used for 
collecting and storing log data from various devices. It does not 
focus on detailed network traffic flow like NetFlow. 
Option D is incorrect. SNMP traps are for sending unsolicited 
alert messages from a device to a management station regarding 
specific events. They don’t provide traffic flow analysis. 
Question 411. A security analyst has been tasked with 
investigating a possible data breach. While reviewing the 
network logs, the analyst noticed an unusual increase in 
outbound traffic to an unfamiliar IP address during non-business 
hours. The traffic appears to be encrypted and is associated with 
a known server containing sensitive data. Which of the 
following is the MOST likely explanation for this behavior? 
(A)       The server is downloading patches 
(B)       An employee is accessing the server remotely 
	
 
605

(C)       A backup of the server is being performed 
(D)       Data exfiltration is occurring 
Explanation 411. Correct Answer: D. Data exfiltration is 
occurring. Given that the traffic is encrypted, associated with a 
sensitive server, and is being sent to an unfamiliar IP during 
non-business hours, the most likely scenario is that 
unauthorized data is being taken out of the network, which is 
known as data exfiltration. 
Option A is incorrect. While servers do download patches, 
these are usually inbound traffic from a known update source, 
not outbound to unfamiliar IPs. 
Option B is incorrect. While employees might access servers 
remotely, the traffic being encrypted and sent during non-
business hours to an unfamiliar IP makes this less likely. 
Option C is incorrect. Backups generally don’t result in 
encrypted outbound traffic to unfamiliar IP addresses, especially 
during non-business hours. 
Question 412. ExamsDigest Enterprises wants to streamline 
their permission assignments. They decide that rather than 
assigning permissions to each user individually, they will group 
users based on departmental roles and then assign permissions 
to these groups. For example, all members of the “Marketing” 
role would have access to the marketing database. Which access 
control method is ExamsDigest Enterprises employing? 
(A)       Rule-based access control 
(B)       Mandatory Access Control (MAC) 
	
 
606

(C)       Discretionary Access Control (DAC) 
(D)       Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 
Explanation 412. Correct Answer: D. Role-Based Access 
Control (RBAC). RBAC involves grouping users based on 
roles (in this case, departments like “Marketing”) and then 
assigning permissions to these roles. Individuals are then placed 
into these roles, which determines their access. The scenario 
described by ExamsDigest Enterprises is a clear example of 
implementing RBAC. 
Option A is incorrect. Rule-based access control often deals 
with predefined rules for access, commonly used in firewalls or 
routers, and is not about grouping users based on roles. 
Option B is incorrect. MAC is more about classifying 
information and having users with the appropriate clearance 
levels. It doesn’t deal with departmental roles like the scenario 
mentioned. 
Option C is incorrect. DAC allows resource owners to grant or 
deny permissions. It does not inherently involve assigning 
permissions based on roles or job functions. 
Question 413. BetaTech is implementing a new authentication 
mechanism for its data center technicians. Instead of using key 
cards, technicians will now have to look into a device that maps 
a specific pattern to authenticate their identity. Which of the 
following is BetaTech likely implementing? 
(A)       Password system 
(B)       Retina scanning 
	
 
607

(C)       Hardware token 
(D)       Knowledge-based questions 
Explanation 413. Correct Answer: B. Retina scanning. 
Retina scanning is a biometric method that analyzes the unique 
patterns of a person’s retina to authenticate their identity. It’s 
categorized under the “something you are” factor as it relies on 
a unique physical characteristic. 
Option A is incorrect. A password system pertains to the 
“something you know” factor since users need to remember 
their passwords to authenticate. 
Option C is incorrect. A hardware token represents the 
“something you have” factor, as it’s a device the user needs to 
possess. 
Option D is incorrect. Knowledge-based questions, such as 
“What’s the name of your first pet?”, fall under the “something 
you know” factor. 
Question 414. A global financial company experiences sporadic 
cyber attacks on its infrastructure. The company notices that 
attacks that occur during non-business hours often result in 
more significant damage due to delayed responses. Which of the 
following measures would BEST decrease the reaction time to 
these off-hour attacks? 
(A)       Train the security staff to handle larger volumes of 
incidents during business hours 
	
 
608

(B)       Implement an automated intrusion detection and 
response system 
(C)       Increase the number of security staff during non-
business hours 
(D)       Send email notifications to security personnel when 
attacks are detected 
Explanation 414. Correct Answer: B. Implement an 
automated intrusion detection and response system. By 
implementing an automated intrusion detection and response 
system, the company can ensure that attacks are detected and 
responded to in real-time, regardless of when they occur. This 
drastically reduces the reaction time compared to manual 
interventions. 
Option A is incorrect. Training staff to handle more incidents 
during business hours doesn’t address the issue of delayed 
responses during non-business hours. 
Option C is incorrect. Increasing staff during non-business 
hours may help, but it might not be as efficient or cost-effective 
as automation, and there’s still potential for human delay. 
Option D is incorrect. Sending email notifications might still 
lead to delays, especially if staff is not checking emails 
promptly during off-hours. 
Question 415. A digital forensics investigator has just 
concluded an investigation regarding a potential insider threat. 
Before presenting the findings to the organization’s board, 
which of the following should the investigator ensure about the 
	
 
609

forensic report? 
(A)       The report includes technical jargon to showcase the 
depth of the investigation 
(B)       The report emphasizes the investigator's credentials and 
experience 
(C)       The report provides a clear, concise summary of 
findings without unnecessary technical details 
(D)       The report contains detailed logs of every action taken 
by the investigator 
Explanation 415. Correct Answer: C. The report provides a 
clear, concise summary of findings without unnecessary 
technical details. A forensic report’s primary purpose is to 
convey the results of an investigation in a clear and 
understandable manner, especially to non-technical 
stakeholders. By avoiding unnecessary technical jargon and 
providing a concise summary, it ensures that the report’s 
findings are accessible to all intended readers. 
Option A is incorrect. While the depth of an investigation is 
important, inundating a report with technical jargon can make it 
difficult for non-technical individuals, such as board members, 
to understand the findings. 
Option B is incorrect. While the investigator’s credentials and 
experience might be important, they should not be the emphasis 
of the report. The focus should remain on the investigation’s 
findings and their implications. 
Option D is incorrect. While maintaining a detailed log of 
every action taken is crucial for the investigator’s records and 
	
 
610

ensuring the integrity of the investigation, including every detail 
in the report can be overwhelming and detract from its main 
findings. 
Question 416. MegaCorp is transitioning to a cloud-based 
infrastructure and wants to allow its employees to access 
multiple cloud services without re-entering their credentials 
every time. They currently have an on-premises LDAP directory 
in place. Which approach should MegaCorp take to provide a 
seamless authentication experience? 
(A)       MegaCorp should abandon their LDAP directory and 
create individual accounts for each cloud service 
(B)       Integrate their LDAP with a Single Sign-On (SSO) 
solution that supports cloud services 
(C)       Store passwords in a plaintext file for users to access 
and login to cloud services manually 
(D)       Force users to change passwords every day to enhance 
security across all cloud platforms 
Explanation 416. Correct Answer: B. Integrate their LDAP 
with a Single Sign-On (SSO) solution that supports cloud 
services. By integrating the on-premises LDAP with an SSO 
solution, MegaCorp can leverage its existing user directory to 
authenticate and provide access to multiple cloud services 
without requiring users to log in separately for each service. 
Option A is incorrect. Abandoning the existing LDAP 
directory would negate the benefits of central management and 
create administrative overhead. 
	
 
611

Option C is incorrect. Storing passwords in plaintext is a 
significant security risk and goes against best practices. 
Option D is incorrect. Forcing users to change passwords daily 
is impractical, could result in weaker passwords, and doesn’t 
provide a seamless authentication experience. 
Question 417. At ExamsDigest, employees can access the 
company’s cloud-based storage system. However, access to 
certain files within the storage is determined by the employee’s 
department, job title, and years of service. For instance, senior 
managers in the finance department with more than five years 
of service can view the company’s financial forecasts. Which 
access control model is ExamsDigest using? 
(A)       Rule-Based Access Control (RAC) 
(B)       Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 
(C)       Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) 
(D)       Discretionary Access Control (DAC) 
Explanation 417. Correct Answer: C. Attribute-Based 
Access Control (ABAC). Attribute-Based Access Control 
(ABAC) determines access based on attributes of the user, 
resource, and environment. In the scenario, the employee’s 
department, job title, and years of service are the attributes that 
determine their access to specific files. 
Option A is incorrect. RAC works based on predefined rules, 
typically without involving multiple user attributes like 
department or job title. 
	
 
612

Option B is incorrect. While RBAC is close in functionality, it 
assigns permissions based on roles (like “manager” or “clerk”), 
not on a combination of attributes. 
Option D is incorrect. DAC allows resource owners to specify 
who can access their resources based on their discretion. It 
doesn’t involve a combination of attributes to determine access. 
Question 418. You are an IT security professional for a large 
corporation. After receiving reports about some users being 
unable to access external websites, you decided to review the 
firewall logs. Which of the following would be a PRIMARY 
indicator in the logs that a rule is blocking outbound traffic? 
(A)       Multiple entries of the same external IP address being 
ALLOWED 
(B)       Timestamps showing large gaps between entries 
(C)       Entries showing DROP/REJECT action for 
outbound traffic to port 80 and 443 
(D)       Logs showing inbound traffic from multiple unknown 
external IP addresses 
Explanation 418. Correct Answer: C. Entries showing 
DROP/REJECT action for outbound traffic to port 80 and 
443. Port 80 and 443 are standard ports for HTTP and HTTPS 
respectively, which are commonly used for accessing websites. 
If users are unable to access external websites, it would make 
sense to check for DROP or REJECT actions for these ports in 
the firewall logs. 
	
 
613

Option A is incorrect. If an external IP address is being 
ALLOWED multiple times, it wouldn’t be the cause of users 
being unable to access websites. 
Option B is incorrect. Large gaps between timestamps in logs 
can indicate various issues, but they aren’t a direct indicator of a 
specific rule blocking outbound traffic. 
Option D is incorrect. While inbound traffic from unknown IP 
addresses might be of concern, it doesn’t specifically indicate an 
outbound traffic rule blocking users from accessing websites. 
Question 419. DeltaCorp has a password policy in place which 
mandates users to change their passwords every 30 days. 
However, some users complain that this results in them 
choosing simpler passwords or writing them down to remember 
them. How can DeltaCorp maintain security while addressing 
these concerns? 
(A)       Reduce the password change frequency but 
introduce more complexity requirements 
(B)       Eliminate password changes and rely solely on two-
factor authentication 
(C)       Ask users to change passwords every week to improve 
security 
(D)       Allow users to reuse any of their last three passwords to 
ease the transition 
Explanation 419. Correct Answer: A. Reduce the password 
change frequency but introduce more complexity 
requirements. By reducing the frequency of password changes, 
users are less burdened with the task of remembering new 
	
 
614

passwords frequently. Adding complexity requirements can 
compensate for the longer duration by ensuring that passwords 
are strong. 
Option B is incorrect. Relying solely on two-factor 
authentication (2FA) without any password requirements can 
introduce risks if the 2FA method is compromised. Additionally, 
2FA can be inconvenient for users if not implemented correctly. 
Option C is incorrect. Asking users to change passwords even 
more frequently would exacerbate the issue and likely lead to 
even weaker password practices. 
Option D is incorrect. Allowing users to reuse recent 
passwords undermines the purpose of having them change 
passwords in the first place and reduces overall security. 
Question 420. During a review of IDS logs, a security specialist 
notices a series of alerts indicating that a single external IP has 
been sending payloads that exploit a known vulnerability. 
However, the internal system to which these payloads are sent is 
patched and is not vulnerable to the exploit. Which of the 
following describes this type of IDS alert? 
(A)       False positive 
(B)       False negative 
(C)       True positive 
(D)       True negative 
Explanation 420. Correct Answer: C. True positive. A true 
positive means the IDS correctly identified malicious or 
anomalous traffic. In this case, even though the internal system 
	
 
615

isn’t vulnerable, the IDS correctly flagged the traffic because 
it’s genuinely malicious. 
Option A is incorrect. A false positive would mean the IDS 
incorrectly flagged benign traffic as malicious, which is not the 
case here. 
Option B is incorrect. A false negative means the IDS failed to 
identify malicious or anomalous traffic, but in this scenario, the 
IDS did correctly identify the malicious traffic. 
Option D is incorrect. A true negative means the IDS correctly 
identified benign traffic as benign. The traffic in this scenario 
was malicious, so this doesn’t apply. 
Question 421. A popular social media platform allows third-
party applications to access user data and post on behalf of 
users. To avoid sharing user passwords with third-party 
applications and provide limited, scoped access, which 
authentication method should the platform use? 
(A)       Embed user passwords in the application's code 
(B)       Use basic authentication with username and password 
for every request 
(C)       Implement Single Sign-On (SSO) using OAuth to 
provide token-based access 
(D)       Rely solely on CAPTCHA for third-party app 
authentication 
Explanation 421. Correct Answer: C. Implement Single 
Sign-On (SSO) using OAuth to provide token-based access. 
OAuth provides token-based access and lets third-party 
	
 
616

applications operate on behalf of users without exposing user 
passwords. OAuth tokens can also be scoped to limit the range 
of actions a third-party application can perform. 
Option A is incorrect. Embedding passwords in application 
code is insecure and goes against best practices. 
Option B is incorrect. Basic authentication exposes user 
credentials and doesn’t offer the scoped access OAuth provides. 
Option D is incorrect. CAPTCHA is designed to differentiate 
between human and automated access but doesn’t handle 
authentication or authorization. 
Question 422. An IT department in a large corporation spends 
several hours each day manually deploying patches and updates 
to thousands of workstations. Which of the following solutions 
would BEST enhance the efficiency of this process and save 
time for the IT team? 
(A)       Disable automatic updates and conduct monthly 
patching sessions 
(B)       Implement an automated patch management system 
(C)       Designate a dedicated team for patching that operates in 
shifts 
(D)       Educate users to install updates on their own 
Explanation 422. Correct Answer: B. Implement an 
automated patch management system. By implementing an 
automated patch management system, the IT department can 
streamline the deployment of patches and updates across all 
	
 
617

workstations, ensuring consistency, reducing manual efforts, 
and saving valuable time. 
Option A is incorrect. Disabling automatic updates and 
conducting monthly patching sessions does not address the 
inefficiency of manual patching and might expose the systems 
to vulnerabilities for a longer time. 
Option C is incorrect. While designating a dedicated team 
might distribute the workload, it doesn’t eliminate the 
inefficiencies associated with manual patching. 
Option D is incorrect. Relying on users to install updates 
introduces inconsistency, potential delays, and additional risks, 
as not all users might have the technical knowledge or 
remember to update regularly. 
Question 423. An international company, GlobalTech, is using 
several web applications hosted by different vendors. To ensure 
their employees can access these applications without having to 
remember multiple sets of credentials, they want to implement a 
solution that can securely exchange user authentication 
information between the company and the service providers. 
What should GlobalTech implement? 
(A)       Integrate each application with an independent LDAP 
server 
(B)       Implement SSO using Security Assertions Markup 
Language (SAML) 
(C)       Embed encrypted user credentials within the URL of 
each application 
	
 
618

(D)       Rely on public API keys shared between the company 
and each vendor 
Explanation 423. Correct Answer: B. Implement SSO using 
Security Assertions Markup Language (SAML). SAML is an 
XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and 
authorization data between parties. It’s designed to facilitate 
single sign-on for web applications. By implementing SSO with 
SAML, GlobalTech can allow its employees to authenticate 
once and gain access to multiple applications without re-
authenticating. 
Option A is incorrect. Having independent LDAP servers for 
each application defeats the purpose of SSO and complicates 
user management. 
Option C is incorrect. Embedding encrypted user credentials 
in URLs is insecure and not a recommended practice. 
Option D is incorrect. API keys are used for system-to-system 
communication and not for user authentication. Moreover, 
public API keys shouldn’t be shared recklessly.  
Question 424. A company wants to implement a solution that 
verifies the software integrity of remote servers before allowing 
them to connect to the primary network. Which of the following 
solutions BEST achieves this objective through attestation? 
(A)       Host-based firewall 
(B)       Whitelisting application 
(C)       Remote attestation 
(D)       VPN tunneling 
	
 
619

Explanation 424. Correct Answer: C. Remote attestation. 
Remote attestation is a process where a device (like a server) 
proves to a remote entity (like a network controller) that it is 
running genuine, unmodified software. It allows for the 
verification of the software integrity of remote devices before 
they connect to a primary network. 
Option A is incorrect. A host-based firewall is used to control 
inbound and outbound network traffic to and from a device 
based on a set of configurable rules. It does not verify the 
software integrity of the device itself. 
Option B is incorrect. A whitelisting application only allows 
specified software to run on a system. While it can enhance 
security by ensuring only approved software runs, it does not 
attest to the state or integrity of the device or its software when 
connecting to another network. 
Option D is incorrect. VPN tunneling encrypts the connection 
between two points over the internet. While it ensures secure 
communication, it doesn’t verify the software integrity of 
devices. 
Question 425. TechCorp is collaborating with SoftTech, a 
business partner. To streamline collaboration without managing 
multiple accounts, TechCorp wants its employees to use their 
existing credentials to access SoftTech’s online project 
management system. Which of the following approaches would 
BEST enable this functionality? 
(A)       TechCorp should create new accounts for its employees 
on SoftTech's system 
	
 
620

(B)       SoftTech should allow anonymous access for 
TechCorp's employees 
(C)       TechCorp should implement federation between its 
identity provider and SoftTech's service provider 
(D)       SoftTech should reset all passwords and provide them to 
TechCorp's employees 
Explanation 425. Correct Answer: C. TechCorp should 
implement federation between its identity provider and 
SoftTech’s service provider. Federation allows two 
organizations to trust each other’s identity systems. TechCorp’s 
employees can use their existing credentials to access services 
on SoftTech’s system without the need to create new accounts. 
Option A is incorrect. Creating new accounts for every user in 
a collaborating organization isn’t scalable and negates the 
advantages of federation. 
Option B is incorrect. Allowing anonymous access would 
compromise security and wouldn’t guarantee identity 
verification. 
Option D is incorrect. Resetting all passwords and providing 
them anew is not a practical or secure approach to collaboration 
between two organizations. 
Question 426. An organization recently experienced a malware 
infection on one of its workstations. A security analyst has been 
tasked with reviewing the endpoint logs of the infected system 
to gather more information about the incident. Which of the 
following entries in the endpoint logs would be MOST 
	
 
621

indicative of the initial malware infection point? 
(A)       Logs indicating successful user login and logout events 
(B)       Entries showing periodic system health-check status as 
"OK" 
(C)       Logs documenting a recently installed and executed 
unknown .exe file from a temporary directory 
(D)       Entries detailing network connectivity checks to the 
domain controller 
Explanation 426. Correct Answer: C. Logs documenting a 
recently installed and executed unknown .exe file from a 
temporary directory. Endpoint logs that document the 
installation and execution of an unknown .exe file, especially 
from a temporary directory, are strong indicators of potentially 
malicious activity. Such logs can pinpoint the initial infection 
point of malware on a system. 
Option A is incorrect. User login and logout events are routine 
logs and do not provide specific information about malware 
infections unless associated with other suspicious activities. 
Option B is incorrect. System health-check status entries are 
meant to provide general information about the system’s health 
and do not specify actions or changes made on the system 
related to malware. 
Option D is incorrect. Network connectivity checks to domain 
controllers are routine in many network environments and don’t 
directly indicate malware activity. 
	
 
622

Question 427. GammaTech has a new remote access policy for 
its employees. Whenever an employee attempts to access the 
corporate network from an unfamiliar location, the system 
requests additional verification before granting access. Which 
factor of authentication is being emphasized in this policy? 
(A)       Knowledge-based questions the employee answers 
(B)       A fingerprint scan from the employee 
(C)       The physical coordinates of the employee's access 
point 
(D)       An SMS code sent to the employee's phone 
Explanation 427. Correct Answer: C. The physical 
coordinates of the employee’s access point. By verifying the 
location or coordinates of an access point, GammaTech is 
utilizing the “somewhere you are” factor in multifactor 
authentication. This emphasizes the geographic location of the 
user. 
Option A is incorrect. Knowledge-based questions fall under 
the “something you know” factor since users answer based on 
information they recall. 
Option B is incorrect. A fingerprint scan pertains to the 
“something you are” factor as it’s a biometric, a unique physical 
characteristic of the individual. 
Option D is incorrect. An SMS code sent to a phone belongs to 
the “something you have” factor, as it’s sent to a device in the 
user’s possession. 
	
 
623

Question 428. AlphaTech’s IT department is rolling out a new 
authentication protocol for remote workers. As part of the 
multifactor authentication process, employees are required to 
provide information that is memorized and cannot be physically 
taken from them. Which of the following represents this type of 
authentication factor? 
(A)       Fingerprint 
(B)       Smart card 
(C)       PIN 
(D)       USB security key 
Explanation 428. Correct Answer: C. PIN. A Personal 
Identification Number (PIN) represents the “something you 
know” factor in multifactor authentication. This type of 
information is memorized by the user and is not a physical item 
that can be taken or a biological trait. 
Option A is incorrect. A fingerprint represents the “something 
you are” factor, which pertains to biometrics. 
Option B is incorrect. A smart card represents the “something 
you have” factor, as it’s a physical item that a user possesses. 
Option D is incorrect. A USB security key also falls under the 
“something you have” factor. It’s a physical device rather than 
memorized information. 
Question 429. A company has set up its firewall to allow web 
traffic through port 80 and port 443, while denying all other 
traffic by default. This setup is an example of which type of 
access control? 
	
 
624

(A)       Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 
(B)       Mandatory Access Control (MAC) 
(C)       Discretionary Access Control (DAC) 
(D)       Rule-Based Access Control (RAC)  
Explanation 429. Correct Answer: D. Rule-Based Access 
Control (RAC). Rule-Based Access Control (RAC) operates 
based on predefined rules set by administrators. In the scenario 
described, the firewall is using rules to allow traffic on certain 
ports (80 and 443) while denying all others, making this a clear 
example of RAC. 
Option A is incorrect. RBAC assigns permissions based on 
roles within an organization. Firewall rules are not typically 
assigned based on user roles. 
Option B is incorrect. MAC involves classifying information 
and matching user clearance levels to these classifications. It is 
unrelated to firewall rule settings. 
Option C is incorrect. DAC allows resource owners to specify 
who can access their resources. Firewall rule settings don’t 
operate based on individual discretion. 
Question 430. The security team at WidgetCorp is trying to 
identify potential insider threats. They have set up a SIEM 
solution with a custom dashboard showing unusual activities. 
Which of the following dashboard views would be MOST 
effective for quickly identifying an employee uploading large 
amounts of proprietary data to an external cloud storage 
service? 
	
 
625

(A)       Display of users who logged in during off-hours 
(B)       Graph of highest network bandwidth users 
(C)       List of most frequently used applications 
(D)       Visualization of failed login attempts 
Explanation 430. Correct Answer: B. Graph of highest 
network bandwidth users. When an employee uploads large 
amounts of data to an external service, it typically results in a 
significant spike in network bandwidth. Therefore, a dashboard 
view that visually displays the highest network bandwidth users 
can quickly alert the security team to potential data exfiltration 
activities. 
Option A is incorrect. While logging in during off-hours can 
be suspicious, it doesn’t directly correlate to data upload 
activities. 
Option C is incorrect. A list of the most frequently used 
applications might help in determining the common tools used 
within the organization, but it doesn’t specifically point to data 
upload actions. 
Option D is incorrect. Visualization of failed login attempts 
could show potential brute-force or unauthorized access 
attempts, but it doesn’t directly indicate data uploading 
activities. 
Question 431. Sarah is a project manager and is working on a 
document that she owns. She wants to grant specific 
permissions to certain team members, allowing some to edit and 
others only to view the document. Which of the following 
	
 
626

access control models would BEST allow Sarah to accomplish 
this? 
(A)       Mandatory Access Control (MAC) 
(B)       Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 
(C)       Discretionary Access Control (DAC) 
(D)       Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) 
Explanation 431. Correct Answer: C. Discretionary Access 
Control (DAC). DAC allows the owner of the resource (in this 
case, Sarah) to specify who can access it and what permissions 
they have (e.g., read, write, execute). This flexibility is what 
Sarah needs to grant specific permissions to individual team 
members based on her discretion. 
Option A is incorrect. Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is 
based on classifications and clearance levels. It wouldn’t be 
suitable for Sarah’s needs in this scenario. 
Option B is incorrect. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 
assigns permissions based on roles in the organization. It 
wouldn’t allow Sarah the fine-grained control she needs over 
individual permissions. 
Option D is incorrect. Attribute-Based Access Control 
(ABAC) bases access on attributes of the user, environment, 
and resource itself. While flexible, it’s not centered around the 
owner’s discretion in the same way DAC is. 
Question 432. CyberSec Corp’s CISO wants to determine if 
there have been any anomalies in user behavior over the past 
month. Specifically, they’re concerned about unauthorized data 
	
 
627

transfers outside of regular business hours. Which of the 
following automated reports would be MOST useful in this 
investigation? 
(A)       After-hours network activity reports 
(B)       User password change frequency reports 
(C)       Hardware inventory audit reports 
(D)       Software licensing compliance reports 
Explanation 432. Correct Answer: A. After-hours network 
activity reports. For the specific concern of unauthorized data 
transfers outside of regular business hours, the after-hours 
network activity reports would be most useful. These reports 
would provide details on network activities, including data 
transfers, that took place outside typical working hours. 
Option B is incorrect. While user password change frequency 
reports might indicate if users are frequently changing 
passwords, which could be a sign of suspicious activity, it 
wouldn’t directly address the concern of data transfers outside 
of regular hours. 
Option C is incorrect. Hardware inventory audit reports would 
provide information about the hardware assets of the company 
but wouldn’t give insights into data transfer activities. 
Option D is incorrect. Software licensing compliance reports 
would detail the compliance status of software licenses, which 
isn’t relevant to the concern about unauthorized data transfers 
after hours. 
	
 
628

Question 433. After detecting suspicious activity on a network, 
a digital forensic analyst is dispatched to acquire data from a 
potential compromised system. The analyst decides to capture 
an image of the affected system’s memory. This technique of 
capturing volatile data is particularly beneficial because: 
(A)       It helps identify deleted files 
(B)       It can capture data in real-time operations 
(C)       It provides information on patch levels 
(D)       It offers insights into firewall configurations  
Explanation 433. Correct Answer: B. It can capture data in 
real-time operations. Memory acquisition allows forensic 
analysts to capture data in its current state, including data about 
running processes, open network connections, and contents of 
the system’s RAM. This can provide insights into malware or 
unauthorized activities that occurred in real-time. 
Option A is incorrect. While memory acquisition can 
sometimes provide information about recently accessed files, 
identifying deleted files is typically done through disk imaging 
and not memory acquisition. 
Option C is incorrect. Information about patch levels is usually 
gleaned from system configurations and logs, not directly from 
memory acquisition. 
Option D is incorrect. Firewall configurations are typically 
found in system configurations and logs, not directly from a 
memory acquisition. 
	
 
629

Question 434. During a suspected security incident involving 
unauthorized access to sensitive data, Jake, an IT administrator, 
immediately disconnected the affected server from the network. 
Later, a digital forensic expert criticized Jake’s action. Which of 
the following is the MOST likely reason for the criticism? 
(A)       Jake should have left the server connected to capture 
more evidence from the attacker 
(B)       Jake should have immediately informed the company's 
legal department 
(C)       Jake should have taken an image of the server's 
memory before disconnecting it 
(D)       Jake should have updated the server's software to 
prevent further unauthorized access 
Explanation 434. Correct Answer: C. Jake should have 
taken an image of the server’s memory before disconnecting 
it. Preserving the current state of a system, especially its volatile 
memory, is crucial during a digital forensic investigation. 
Volatile memory can contain critical evidence about an incident, 
but this evidence is lost once the system is powered off or 
restarted. 
Option A is incorrect. While sometimes monitoring an attacker 
can be valuable, it’s often more critical to prioritize the safety of 
data and systems over collecting additional evidence. 
Option B is incorrect. Although informing the legal 
department is an important step in many incident response 
processes, preserving the integrity and state of potential 
evidence comes first. 
	
 
630

Option D is incorrect. While updating the server’s software 
might be a future step to prevent incidents, the immediate 
priority during a suspected security incident is to preserve 
evidence. 
Question 435. A large enterprise is deploying a new automation 
system that will allow various teams, including development, 
operations, and QA, to provision and configure their own 
environments. The security team is concerned about potential 
misconfigurations or excessive permissions being granted. 
Which solution can be used within the automation to ensure 
security standards are met without limiting the agility of the 
teams? 
(A)       Implementing a zero-trust model for all teams 
(B)       Manually reviewing all requests before provisioning 
(C)       Setting up guard rails within the automation scripts 
to define boundaries and prevent misconfigurations 
(D)       Disabling the automation system for all teams except 
the security team 
Explanation 435. Correct Answer: C. Setting up guard rails 
within the automation scripts to define boundaries and 
prevent misconfigurations. Guard rails in automation scripts 
act as safeguards, ensuring that certain actions, configurations, 
or provisions stay within defined security and operational 
boundaries without impeding the benefits of automation. 
Option A is incorrect. While a zero-trust model is beneficial 
for security, it does not directly address the challenge of 
misconfigurations in automation processes. 
	
 
631

Option B is incorrect. Manually reviewing all requests negates 
the efficiency benefits of automation and slows down the 
provisioning process. 
Option D is incorrect. Disabling the automation system for all 
teams except the security team defeats the purpose of having an 
automation system for diverse teams and reduces agility. 
Question 436. After a security breach, Jake, a digital forensics 
investigator, arrives at the scene to collect a hard drive for 
examination. He labels the hard drive, records its serial number, 
photographs the scene, and ensures the hard drive is transported 
securely to the forensics lab. These steps are crucial to: 
(A)       Preserve the data's integrity on the hard drive 
(B)       Maintain the chain of custody 
(C)       Decrypt the data on the hard drive 
(D)       Implement a legal hold on the data 
Explanation 436. Correct Answer: B. Maintain the chain of 
custody. Maintaining a chain of custody is crucial to ensure that 
evidence is authentic and unchanged. This involves 
documenting each step of the evidence handling process, from 
collection to analysis, ensuring its validity in legal proceedings. 
Option A is incorrect. While preserving the data’s integrity is 
crucial in forensics, the specific steps mentioned are primarily 
for maintaining the chain of custody. 
Option C is incorrect. Decrypting the data focuses on making 
encrypted data readable. The steps Jake took are related to 
documenting evidence handling, not decryption. 
	
 
632

Option D is incorrect. Implementing a legal hold ensures that 
specific data is preserved for legal reasons. The steps mentioned 
by Jake focus on documenting how the evidence was handled 
and preserved, not on a directive to retain it for legal purposes. 
Question 437. After deploying a new version of your 
company’s internal application, several users reported issues 
with accessing specific features. To investigate the root cause, 
you decided to review the application logs. What entry in the 
logs would most directly indicate a software bug or error related 
to the recent deployment? 
(A)       Entries showing successful user authentication 
timestamps 
(B)       Entries detailing the number of transactions completed 
by the application 
(C)       Entries with "ERROR" or "EXCEPTION" related 
to the specific feature being accessed 
(D)       Entries showing routine data backup operations 
Explanation 437. Correct Answer: C. Entries with 
“ERROR” or “EXCEPTION” related to the specific feature 
being accessed. In the context of application logs, entries 
labeled as “ERROR” or “EXCEPTION” generally indicate that 
the application encountered a problem. If these entries are 
related to the feature users are having trouble with, it points 
towards a software bug or issue related to the deployment. 
Option A is incorrect. Successful user authentication entries 
would indicate that users are able to log into the application 
successfully, but they don’t provide insights into feature-
specific issues. 
	
 
633

Option B is incorrect. While the number of transactions could 
provide performance metrics or usage patterns, it doesn’t 
directly indicate a software bug or deployment-related issue. 
Option D is incorrect. Routine data backup operations are 
unrelated to application feature functionalities and won’t help in 
identifying deployment-related errors. 
Question 438. After a major data breach in XYZ Corporation, 
the management decided to understand the primary reason 
behind the incident to prevent such occurrences in the future. 
Which of the following approaches should the incident response 
team prioritize to determine the fundamental cause of the 
breach? 
(A)       Perform vulnerability scanning on all servers 
(B)       Review firewall logs for the past week 
(C)       Conduct a root cause analysis 
(D)       Upgrade all security software 
Explanation 438. Correct Answer: C. Conduct a root cause 
analysis. Root cause analysis (RCA) is a systematic process for 
identifying the origin of problems or faults and deciding on the 
most suitable approach to take to prevent recurrence. In the 
context of a security incident, RCA helps in determining the 
primary reason behind the breach. 
Option A is incorrect. While vulnerability scanning is essential 
for understanding potential weaknesses in servers, it does not 
directly identify the fundamental cause of a past incident. 
	
 
634

Option B is incorrect. Firewall logs can provide insights about 
traffic patterns and potential attacks but may not directly reveal 
the root cause of a breach. 
Option D is incorrect. Upgrading security software is a 
reactive measure and does not ensure understanding or 
addressing the core reason for a breach. 
Question 439. A cloud infrastructure team frequently receives 
performance alerts from various resources in the environment. 
They want to ensure that relevant teams are immediately 
informed and can act upon any resource that crosses a 
performance threshold. What is the BEST way to accomplish 
this? 
(A)       Conduct a weekly meeting to review all performance 
alerts 
(B)       Automate ticket creation for any resource that 
crosses the performance threshold and assign it to the 
relevant team 
(C)       Send all performance alerts to the cloud infrastructure 
team's email for review 
(D)       Disable performance monitoring to reduce alert fatigue 
Explanation 439. Correct Answer: B. Automate ticket 
creation for any resource that crosses the performance 
threshold and assign it to the relevant team. Automating the 
ticket creation process ensures that alerts are not overlooked and 
that the appropriate teams are informed in real-time, allowing 
for prompt resolution. 
	
 
635

Option A is incorrect. Conducting a weekly review does not 
allow for immediate action upon critical performance issues. 
Option C is incorrect. Sending all alerts to the team’s email 
might lead to alert fatigue and the possibility of overlooking 
critical alerts among less important ones. 
Option D is incorrect. Disabling performance monitoring 
would prevent the team from receiving important alerts and is 
not a practical solution. 
Question 440. A development team is working on a mission-
critical application for a financial institution. The team wants to 
ensure that any code changes do not introduce vulnerabilities or 
break existing functionalities. What is the BEST automation 
approach to achieve this objective? 
(A)       Manually review the code changes once a month 
(B)       Use continuous integration tools to automatically 
compile and test code changes against known vulnerabilities 
and functional tests 
(C)       Rely on users to report any issues after the application is 
deployed 
(D)       Implement a firewall to block potential attacks on the 
application  
Explanation 440. Correct Answer: B. Use continuous 
integration tools to automatically compile and test code 
changes against known vulnerabilities and functional tests. 
Continuous integration tools can be set up to automatically test 
code changes as they are committed. This ensures that 
	
 
636

vulnerabilities and functional issues are detected early in the 
development process. 
Option A is incorrect. Manually reviewing code changes once 
a month does not provide immediate feedback to developers and 
could delay the identification of vulnerabilities or functional 
issues. 
Option C is incorrect. Relying on users to report issues is 
reactive and could expose the financial institution to risks if 
vulnerabilities are exploited. 
Option D is incorrect. While firewalls are important for 
security, they don’t address the need to test code changes for 
vulnerabilities or functional issues. 
Question 441. Acme Corp. is in the early stages of a potential 
lawsuit, and their legal department has just issued a notice for e-
discovery related to email communications of a former 
executive. As an IT security professional, which of the 
following should be your FIRST action? 
(A)       Start a full backup of the company's email server 
(B)       Identify and isolate the email accounts related to the 
former executive 
(C)       Immediately delete all emails that are more than two 
years old 
(D)       Inform the media about the upcoming lawsuit 
Explanation 441. Correct Answer: B. Identify and isolate 
the email accounts related to the former executive. In the 
context of e-discovery, it’s crucial to locate and preserve 
	
 
637

electronically stored information (ESI) that could be relevant to 
the lawsuit. The first step would be to identify and isolate the 
specific email accounts or data sources relevant to the request to 
ensure they are not tampered with or deleted. 
Option A is incorrect. While backups are essential, a blanket 
backup of the email server may not specifically cater to the e-
discovery request. Focusing on the particular data in question is 
more pertinent. 
Option C is incorrect. Deleting potential evidence, especially 
after a notice for e-discovery, could lead to legal penalties and is 
not a recommended action. 
Option D is incorrect. Informing the media is not a primary 
step in the e-discovery process and can have detrimental effects 
on the company’s reputation. 
Question 442. OmegaHealth, a large healthcare provider, is 
integrating automation into its operations. When a new 
healthcare worker is hired, they require access to multiple 
systems. Why would OmegaHealth automate the user 
provisioning process across these systems? 
(A)       To enforce a uniform password for all healthcare 
workers. 
(B)       To save time by ensuring consistent and 
simultaneous account creation across all necessary 
platforms 
(C)       To prevent the new hires from accessing any system 
until their probation period ends 
	
 
638

(D)       To reduce the software licenses needed by delaying 
account activation 
Explanation 442. Correct Answer: B. To save time by 
ensuring consistent and simultaneous account creation 
across all necessary platforms. Automating user provisioning, 
especially in an environment where access to multiple systems 
is needed, can dramatically save time and reduce human errors. 
With automation, accounts can be created consistently and 
simultaneously across all required platforms. 
Option A is incorrect. Enforcing a uniform password for all 
users is a poor security practice. Automation should focus on 
efficiency and security, not creating potential vulnerabilities. 
Option C is incorrect. Automating user provisioning doesn’t 
inherently prevent new hires from accessing systems. The 
automation should be designed to provision based on specific 
rules and roles. 
Option D is incorrect. Automation in user provisioning is 
about streamlining the creation and management of accounts, 
not about reducing software licenses or delaying activations. 
Question 443. During a regular review of system logs, Alex, a 
security analyst, noticed an unusual pattern of network traffic 
originating from a single IP address. Instead of waiting for an 
automated system to flag this as suspicious, he decides to 
manually dive deeper into the data to identify any potential 
threats. What is Alex engaging in? 
(A)       Incident management 
	
 
639

(B)       Threat modeling 
(C)       Threat hunting 
(D)       Security monitoring 
Explanation 443. Correct Answer: C. Threat hunting. Threat 
hunting is a proactive approach where security professionals or 
analysts actively and manually search for signs of malicious 
activities within their network or systems, especially those 
threats that haven’t been automatically detected by traditional 
security tools. 
Option A is incorrect. Incident management refers to the 
process followed when managing and responding to a security 
incident. In this scenario, Alex is taking a proactive approach to 
find potential threats, not responding to an identified incident. 
Option B is incorrect. Threat modeling involves identifying 
potential threats and designing countermeasures to prevent or 
mitigate the impact of those threats. It’s more about planning 
than actively searching for threats. 
Option D is incorrect. Security monitoring is the process of 
continuously monitoring and analyzing an organization’s 
security events. While Alex is reviewing logs, which is part of 
monitoring, the manual and proactive deep dive he is taking is 
more in line with threat hunting. 
Question 444 OmegaTech’s security team noticed an increase 
in account compromises. An internal investigation revealed that 
many employees have been using the same passwords across 
different company systems and applications. Which password 
	
 
640

best practice can OmegaTech enforce to mitigate this issue? 
(A)       Encouraging users to change their passwords every 
month 
(B)       Implementing an account lockout policy after three 
failed login attempts 
(C)       Prohibiting password reuse for at least the last five 
password changes 
(D)       Mandating that passwords contain only alphabetical 
characters for simplicity 
Explanation 444. Correct Answer: C. Prohibiting password 
reuse for at least the last five password changes. By 
prohibiting password reuse for a number of iterations, you 
discourage users from cycling between a small set of passwords 
and, therefore, increase the overall security of user accounts. 
Option A is incorrect. While frequent password changes can 
enhance security, they don’t directly address the issue of 
password reuse across different systems and applications. 
Option B is incorrect. While an account lockout policy can 
deter brute-force attacks, it doesn’t prevent users from reusing 
the same passwords across different platforms. 
Option D is incorrect. Restricting passwords to only 
alphabetical characters reduces complexity and weakens the 
security of the password. 
Question 445. AlphaCorp’s IT department is reviewing 
password policies and wants to adopt a strategy that enhances 
security. Which of the following password strategies would be 
	
 
641

the MOST secure? 
(A)       Passwords should be at least 6 characters long, with no 
other requirements 
(B)       Passwords should be at least 10 characters long and 
include both uppercase and lowercase letters 
(C)       Passwords should be at least 8 characters long and 
include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and 
special characters 
(D)       Passwords should be at least 4 characters long and 
include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters 
Explanation 445. Correct Answer: C. Passwords should be 
at least 8 characters long and include uppercase letters, 
lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This 
option provides a balanced combination of length and 
complexity, making it more resistant to brute-force and 
dictionary attacks. 
Option A is incorrect. A 6-character password without any 
complexity requirements is easier to crack with modern 
computational capabilities. 
Option B is incorrect. While having a 10-character length is 
beneficial, it lacks the additional complexity of numbers and 
special characters which can further bolster security. 
Option D is incorrect. The length is too short, and even with a 
mix of uppercase and lowercase, it does not provide the 
recommended security for passwords. 
	
 
642

Question 446. A security analyst is reviewing the IPS logs and 
discovers multiple alerts originating from a single IP address 
attempting to access various company servers. The analyst is 
trying to determine the type of attack. Which of the following 
log entries BEST indicates a port scanning activity? 
(A)       Multiple consecutive connection attempts to different 
ports on a single server in a short time frame 
(B)       Repeated connection attempts to port 80 of a web server 
every 3 seconds 
(C)       Numerous failed login attempts to an FTP server from 
the same IP address 
(D)       Consistent pings to the network gateway every 5 
seconds 
Explanation 446. Correct Answer: A. Multiple consecutive 
connection attempts to different ports on a single server in a 
short time frame. Port scanning is an activity where an attacker 
probes a server or host to determine what services are running. 
Rapid connection attempts to various ports indicate that the 
attacker is trying to discover open ports and the services 
running on them. 
Option B is incorrect. While repeated connection attempts to a 
single port could be suspicious, it doesn’t indicate port 
scanning. This could be indicative of a DoS attack. 
Option C is incorrect. Multiple failed login attempts indicate a 
possible brute force attack on the FTP server, not port scanning. 
	
 
643

Option D is incorrect. Regular pings to the network gateway 
might be indicative of network mapping or checking 
connectivity but doesn’t suggest port scanning activity. 
Question 447. As part of a cloud infrastructure project, 
AlphaTech plans to deploy multiple virtualized resources for its 
new application. The deployment includes databases, web 
servers, and load balancers. What is the PRIMARY benefit of 
using automation scripts in the resource provisioning process 
for this project? 
(A)       It enables AlphaTech to use a single operating system 
for all resources 
(B)       It guarantees 100% uptime for all virtualized resources 
(C)       It ensures standardized, repeatable, and rapid 
deployments across the infrastructure 
(D)       It prevents unauthorized users from accessing the cloud 
infrastructure 
Explanation 447. Correct Answer: C. It ensures 
standardized, repeatable, and rapid deployments across the 
infrastructure. Automation in resource provisioning provides 
consistency in deployments, allowing for standardized 
configurations, rapid scaling, and the ability to repeat 
deployments without human error. 
Option A is incorrect. While automation can deploy similar or 
consistent environments, it does not inherently enforce a single 
operating system. 
Option B is incorrect. Automation can increase efficiency and 
reduce human errors, but it cannot guarantee 100% uptime, as 
	
 
644

there are other factors involved, like hardware failures or 
network issues. 
Option D is incorrect. While automation can implement 
security configurations, it does not, by itself, prevent 
unauthorized access. Security measures need to be designed and 
implemented separately. 
Question 448. DeltaTech, a progressive tech firm, is aiming to 
improve its security posture by eliminating the vulnerabilities 
associated with password use. They are considering deploying a 
passwordless authentication system. Which of the following 
represents the PRIMARY advantage of such a system? 
(A)       It allows users to choose any password complexity 
(B)       It eliminates the need for remembering passwords 
(C)       It guarantees protection against all cyber threats 
(D)       It ensures compatibility with all legacy systems 
Explanation 448. Correct Answer: B. It eliminates the need 
for remembering passwords. Passwordless authentication 
methods, such as biometrics, hardware tokens, or mobile app 
confirmations, remove the need for users to remember and input 
passwords. This can reduce risks associated with weak or reused 
passwords and enhance user convenience. 
Option A is incorrect. Passwordless systems remove the 
concept of a traditional password altogether, so there’s no 
“password complexity” to choose. 
Option C is incorrect. While passwordless authentication can 
significantly enhance security, especially against threats like 
	
 
645

password spraying or credential stuffing, it doesn’t guarantee 
protection against all cyber threats. 
Option D is incorrect. Passwordless authentication methods 
might not be compatible with all legacy systems without 
modifications or updates. 
Question 449. OmegaTech recently introduced an additional 
layer of security for its remote server access. Along with their 
usual passwords, employees now need to use a physical device 
they have with them to gain access. Which of the following 
represents this “something you have” factor in multifactor 
authentication? 
(A)       Password hint 
(B)       Facial recognition 
(C)       Hardware token 
(D)       Voice recognition 
Explanation 449. Correct Answer: C. Hardware token. 
Hardware tokens are devices that generate security codes for 
authentication purposes. Users are required to have this physical 
device on-hand, making it an example of the “something you 
have” factor in multifactor authentication. 
Option A is incorrect. A password hint is related to “something 
you know” factor. Moreover, it’s not an authentication factor 
but rather an aid for recalling a password. 
Option B is incorrect. Facial recognition pertains to the 
“something you are” factor, which refers to biometric methods 
of authentication. 
	
 
646

Option D is incorrect. Voice recognition, similar to facial 
recognition, falls under the “something you are” factor, as it 
uses biometric identification. 
Question 450. A large corporation is investigating a potential 
insider threat incident. A security analyst is tasked with 
examining the OS-specific security logs of a Windows server 
where sensitive documents are stored. Which of the following 
entries in the logs would MOST likely indicate unauthorized 
access attempts? 
(A)       Logs displaying Windows Update successful 
installations 
(B)       Entries showing a large number of failed login 
attempts followed by a successful login from a user outside 
of regular business hours 
(C)       Logs indicating scheduled disk defragmentation tasks 
(D)       Entries detailing successful printer connections and 
print jobs 
Explanation 450. Correct Answer: B. Entries showing a 
large number of failed login attempts followed by a 
successful login from a user outside of regular business 
hours. A sequence of failed login attempts followed by a 
successful login, especially outside of regular business hours, 
can be a strong indicator of a brute-force attack or unauthorized 
access attempt on a system. 
Option A is incorrect. Successful installations of Windows 
Updates are routine maintenance activities and do not directly 
imply unauthorized access. 
	
 
647

Option C is incorrect. Disk defragmentation tasks are part of 
regular system maintenance and are not indicative of 
unauthorized access. 
Option D is incorrect. While monitoring printer connections 
and print jobs can be relevant in certain security investigations, 
they are not direct indicators of unauthorized server access. 
Question 451. ThetaTech, a financial institution, wants to 
upgrade its authentication system for high-net-worth customers 
accessing their accounts online. Besides the traditional 
password, they want to include a method that captures unique 
physical or behavioral characteristics. Which type of 
authentication method should ThetaTech consider? 
(A)       Token-based authentication 
(B)       Geolocation tracking 
(C)       Biometrics 
(D)       Smart card 
Explanation 451. Correct Answer: C. Biometrics. Biometrics 
authentication involves recognizing an individual based on their 
unique physical or behavioral characteristics, such as 
fingerprints, retina scans, or voice recognition. 
Option A is incorrect. Token-based authentication provides 
users with a device or software token that generates a time-
sensitive code. It doesn’t capture physical or behavioral 
characteristics. 
	
 
648

Option B is incorrect. Geolocation tracking determines a 
user’s location but doesn’t involve capturing unique physical or 
behavioral traits. 
Option D is incorrect. A smart card is a physical card that 
contains electronic information. It can be used for 
authentication, but it does not inherently capture unique 
physical or behavioral characteristics. 
Question 452. The cybersecurity team of XYZ Corp. plans to 
assess their organization’s preparedness for a potential data 
breach. They aim to evaluate the effectiveness of their response 
strategy without performing any real actions. Which of the 
following methods would BEST help them achieve this goal? 
(A)       Live fire exercise 
(B)       System hardening test 
(C)       Red team/blue team exercise 
(D)       Tabletop exercise 
Explanation 452. Correct Answer: D. Tabletop exercise. A 
tabletop exercise is a discussion-based session where team 
members meet in an informal, classroom setting to discuss their 
roles during an emergency and their responses to a particular 
emergency situation. It allows for an assessment of an incident 
response strategy without performing any actual tasks. 
Option A is incorrect. A live fire exercise is a real-world test, 
often unannounced, and could impact actual operations. 
	
 
649

Option B is incorrect. System hardening test focuses on 
making a system more secure against attacks and does not 
evaluate incident response. 
Option C is incorrect. Red team/blue team exercises involve 
simulating real-world cyber attacks to test an organization’s 
defense and response capabilities, which is more hands-on than 
what is described. 
Question 453. In preparation for a potential lawsuit, Meg, a 
cybersecurity analyst, has been asked to ensure that specific 
digital evidence remains intact and is not altered or deleted. 
What measure should Meg implement to ensure this 
requirement? 
(A)       Encrypt the evidence 
(B)       Initiate a legal hold 
(C)       Perform a full disk wipe 
(D)       Conduct a vulnerability assessment 
Explanation 453. Correct Answer: B. Initiate a legal hold. A 
legal hold ensures that specific data that could be relevant to a 
legal case is preserved and not altered or deleted until the hold 
is lifted. In this situation, Meg would initiate a legal hold to 
keep the digital evidence intact for the potential lawsuit. 
Option A is incorrect. Encrypting the evidence can ensure its 
confidentiality, but it does not prevent deletion or guarantee its 
preservation for legal reasons. 
	
 
650

Option C is incorrect. Performing a full disk wipe would 
eliminate all data on a disk, which is contrary to the requirement 
of preserving specific digital evidence. 
Option D is incorrect. Conducting a vulnerability assessment 
is about identifying weaknesses in a system, not about 
preserving digital evidence for legal purposes. 
Question 454. A financial company is designing a new system 
that needs to ensure data is accessed based on classifications 
and clearance levels of the users. Which of the following access 
control models BEST fits this requirement? 
(A)       Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 
(B)       Discretionary Access Control (DAC) 
(C)       Mandatory Access Control (MAC) 
(D)       Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) 
Explanation 454. Correct Answer: C. Mandatory Access 
Control (MAC). MAC is based on the classification of 
information and the clearance level of users. In a MAC model, 
the operating system constrains the ability of a subject or 
initiator to access or perform some sort of operation on an 
object or target. In this scenario, where data is classified and 
users are given clearance levels, MAC is the most suitable 
model. 
Option A is incorrect. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 
assigns permissions to specific roles in an organization. Users 
are then assigned to roles. While useful in many contexts, it 
doesn’t focus on classifications and clearance levels. 
	
 
651

Option B is incorrect. Discretionary Access Control (DAC) 
allows the owner of the resource to specify who can access it. 
It’s more flexible but less restrictive than MAC. 
Option D is incorrect. Attribute-Based Access Control 
(ABAC) uses policies to determine access, based on attributes 
of users, the environment, and the resource itself. While it can 
be used in scenarios with classifications and clearances, it’s not 
as strictly based on these factors as MAC. 
Question 455. The incident response team at XYZ Corp 
received a report that an attacker successfully exploited a 
vulnerable web application in their environment. To identify 
which server might have been compromised, the team decided 
to cross-reference recent vulnerability scan results. Which of the 
following information from the vulnerability scan would be 
MOST helpful in pinpointing the potentially compromised 
server? 
(A)       The timestamp of when the scan was conducted 
(B)       The software version of the scanning tool 
(C)       List of hosts with the specific vulnerability related to 
the exploit 
(D)       The total number of vulnerabilities identified during the 
scan 
Explanation 455. Correct Answer: C. List of hosts with the 
specific vulnerability related to the exploit. In the given 
scenario, to determine which server may have been 
compromised, the team should focus on those hosts identified in 
the vulnerability scan as having the specific vulnerability that 
matches the exploit used by the attacker. 
	
 
652

Option A is incorrect. While the timestamp might indicate 
when the scan was done, it wouldn’t provide specifics about 
which servers had the vulnerability related to the reported 
exploit. 
Option B is incorrect. Knowing the software version of the 
scanning tool wouldn’t assist in identifying the potentially 
compromised server. 
Option D is incorrect. The total number of vulnerabilities 
identified doesn’t help pinpoint a specific server; it only 
provides a high-level overview of the security posture. 
Question 456. Epsilon Inc. recently hired Jenny as a junior 
network administrator. To ensure security, they give Jenny only 
the access permissions necessary to complete her specific tasks, 
such as monitoring network traffic, but not modifying firewall 
rules. This approach of granting Jenny’s permissions aligns with 
which security principle? 
(A)       Mandatory Access Control (MAC) 
(B)       Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 
(C)       Time-of-Day Restrictions 
(D)       Least Privilege 
Explanation 456. Correct Answer: D. Least Privilege. The 
principle of Least Privilege dictates that users should be granted 
the minimum levels of access – or the least amount of privileges 
– necessary to complete their job functions. In Jenny’s case, 
she’s only granted the permissions necessary for her role, which 
aligns with this principle. 
	
 
653

Option A is incorrect. MAC involves classifying information 
and matching user clearance levels to these classifications. 
Jenny’s access isn’t based on classifications. 
Option B is incorrect. RBAC assigns permissions based on 
roles within an organization. While Jenny’s permissions may be 
aligned with her role, the scenario specifically emphasizes 
granting the minimal necessary access, which is a characteristic 
of Least Privilege. 
Option C is incorrect. Time-of-Day Restrictions determine 
access based on the current time and have no direct relation to 
the principle of Least Privilege. 
Question 457. A company is attempting to verify the legitimacy 
of an email sent from a senior executive to a number of 
employees. The email requests the recipients to click on a link 
and enter their credentials for a “system upgrade.” The security 
team wants to ascertain if the email genuinely came from the 
executive. Which of the following metadata from the email 
would be MOST beneficial in this investigation? 
(A)       The email's subject line 
(B)       The email's send time and date 
(C)       The originating IP address in the email headers 
(D)       The size of the email in bytes 
Explanation 457. Correct Answer: C. The originating IP 
address in the email headers. Email headers often contain 
metadata about the originating IP address of the email. This can 
help investigators determine if the email was sent from an 
	
 
654

expected location or if it originated from an unfamiliar or 
suspicious IP, indicating a possible phishing attempt. 
Option A is incorrect. The subject line of an email is not 
typically indicative of its authenticity. 
Option B is incorrect. While knowing the send time and date 
may provide some context, it won’t necessarily verify the 
legitimacy of the email sender. 
Option D is incorrect. The size of the email in bytes doesn’t 
offer significant value in determining the authenticity of the 
email’s origin. 
Question 458. A cloud-based e-commerce company wants to 
ensure that its inventory system automatically updates the stock 
levels on its website and third-party sales platforms whenever a 
sale occurs. What should the company leverage to achieve this 
real-time synchronization? 
(A)       Regularly backup the inventory system and restore it on 
the website and sales platforms 
(B)       Rely on customers to report discrepancies in stock levels 
(C)       Use Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to 
integrate the inventory system with the website and third-
party platforms 
(D)       Conduct daily stock audits and manually update all 
platforms 
Explanation 458. Correct Answer: C. Use Application 
Programming Interfaces (APIs) to integrate the inventory 
system with the website and third-party platforms. Using 
	
 
655

APIs ensures real-time data synchronization between systems. 
Whenever a sale occurs, the inventory system can automatically 
update stock levels across all platforms. 
Option A is incorrect. Backing up and restoring the inventory 
system is a reactive and inefficient approach. It won’t provide 
real-time stock updates. 
Option B is incorrect. Relying on customers to report stock 
discrepancies is not proactive and could lead to negative 
customer experiences and potential lost sales. 
Option D is incorrect. Manual updates are time-consuming and 
prone to human error, and they don’t support real-time stock 
level synchronization. 
Question 459. After a series of phishing attacks, the IT 
department of BetaTech Corp noticed that several employees 
were using easily guessable passwords. The security team 
decided to recommend the use of password managers to assist 
employees in creating and remembering strong passwords. 
Which of the following is a PRIMARY benefit of using 
password managers in this context? 
(A)       Password managers automatically update the operating 
system 
(B)       Password managers can generate and store complex 
passwords 
(C)       Password managers always prevent phishing attacks 
(D)       Password managers allow the reuse of strong passwords 
across multiple platforms 
	
 
656

Explanation 459. Correct Answer: B. Password managers 
can generate and store complex passwords. Password 
managers can automatically generate complex passwords that 
meet a variety of criteria (e.g., length, use of special characters, 
avoidance of easily guessable terms) and store them securely. 
This helps users maintain strong, unique passwords for every 
service they use without needing to remember each one. 
Option A is incorrect. Password managers are designed for 
generating, retrieving, and storing complex passwords, not for 
updating the operating system. 
Option C is incorrect. While password managers can help 
reduce the risk of successful phishing attacks by storing 
passwords securely and autofilling them on recognized 
websites, they don’t always prevent phishing attacks, especially 
if a user is deceived into entering credentials on a fake website. 
Option D is incorrect. One of the primary benefits of password 
managers is to ensure that users have unique passwords for each 
application or service. Reusing passwords, even if strong, across 
multiple platforms poses a security risk. 
Question 460. A company’s online retail website faces DDoS 
attacks that cause significant downtime. Their current setup 
relies on manual verification of traffic spikes before mitigation 
efforts are deployed. What change could BEST enhance the 
company’s reaction time to such attacks in the future? 
(A)       Educate users to report slow website loading times 
(B)       Manually back up the website data every hour 
(C)       Deploy a web application firewall with automated 
	
 
657

DDoS mitigation features 
(D)       Increase the website's bandwidth to handle traffic spikes 
Explanation 460. Correct Answer: C. Deploy a web 
application firewall with automated DDoS mitigation 
features. Deploying a web application firewall (WAF) with 
automated DDoS mitigation can instantly detect and mitigate 
attack traffic, significantly improving reaction time to attacks 
compared to waiting for manual verification. 
Option A is incorrect. Relying on users to report slow loading 
times is reactive and does not guarantee a swift response to 
DDoS attacks. 
Option B is incorrect. Backing up website data is important for 
recovery, but it doesn’t prevent or mitigate active DDoS attacks 
or improve reaction time. 
Option D is incorrect. Merely increasing bandwidth might not 
be sufficient against DDoS attacks. An attacker can still 
overwhelm the increased capacity, and it doesn’t address the 
need for swift detection and mitigation.

Question 461. RedFlare Solutions, a financial firm, is storing 
sensitive client data in a database. The Chief Information 
Security Officer (CISO) insists that the data should be 
unreadable even if it’s intercepted during transmission or if the 
storage is compromised. Which encryption standard would best 
serve this requirement? 
(A)       Symmetric encryption using a shared key 
(B)       Hashing the data with a one-way function 
(C)       Encrypting the entire database using transparent 
data encryption 
(D)       Storing the data in a proprietary format 
Explanation 461. Correct Answer: C. Encrypting the entire 
database using transparent data encryption. Transparent data 
encryption (TDE) encrypts the entire database, ensuring that 
data remains encrypted both at rest and during transmission. It 
	
 
689

renders the data unreadable without the appropriate encryption 
keys. 
Option A is incorrect. Symmetric encryption can make data 
unreadable, but it may pose challenges in key management and 
distribution, especially if the key is compromised. 
Option B is incorrect. Hashing data makes it unreadable, but 
it’s a one-way function. Once data is hashed, it cannot be 
retrieved or decrypted, making it unsuitable for encrypting 
stored data that needs to be accessed and read. 
Option D is incorrect. Simply storing data in a proprietary 
format doesn’t mean it’s encrypted or unreadable. If someone 
understands or reverse engineers the format, the data can be 
read. 
Question 462. GlobalTech, a software development company, is 
entering into a partnership with WebSolutions, a web hosting 
provider. They aim to create a standard set of terms governing

most suitable for establishing these foundational terms for 
future transactions? 
(A)       Memorandum of understanding (MOU) 
(B)       Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) 
(C)       Licensing agreement 
(D)       Master service agreement (MSA) 
Explanation 462. Correct Answer: D. Master service 
agreement (MSA). A Master service agreement (MSA) is 
	
 
690

designed to define a broad framework covering the terms and 
conditions of business transactions between parties. It sets out 
general terms so that specific details can be negotiated in 
subsequent contracts. Given that GlobalTech and WebSolutions 
intend to outline foundational terms for their ongoing 
transactions, an MSA is the most fitting choice. 
Option A is incorrect. An MOU establishes mutual intentions 
but typically doesn’t detail specific transaction terms. 
Option B is incorrect. An NDA focuses on maintaining 
confidentiality and doesn’t establish transactional terms. 
Option C is incorrect. A licensing agreement concerns the 
rights to use, distribute, or reproduce specific software or 
intellectual property.  
Question 463. TechCorp is implementing a new cloud-based 
solution. The security team has been tasked with analyzing the 
risks associated with this project. They’ve decided to categorize

High, and Critical. Which type of risk analysis is TechCorp’s 
security team employing? 
(A)       Quantitative 
(B)       Statistical 
(C)       Qualitative 
(D)       Financial 
Explanation 463. Correct Answer: C. Qualitative. Qualitative 
risk analysis involves assessing risks based on descriptive 
	
 
691

categories or rankings, such as Low, Medium, High, and 
Critical, instead of using numeric values. 
Option A is incorrect. Quantitative risk analysis involves using 
numerical values, often in the form of monetary figures or 
percentages, to evaluate risks. 
Option B is incorrect. Statistical risk analysis uses statistical 
methods, often paired with quantitative data, to predict future 
risks. It doesn’t categorize risks in the manner described. 
Option D is incorrect. Financial risk analysis specifically 
evaluates risks in terms of potential financial losses and is a 
subset of quantitative risk analysis. 
Question 464. SecureBank is in the process of selecting a 
vendor for their new online transaction system. The bank is

steps is the most relevant to the bank’s concerns? 
(A)       Checking the vendor's sales growth over the last five 
years 
(B)       Conducting due diligence regarding the vendor's 
security practices 
(C)       Comparing the visual appeal of the vendor's user 
interface to competitors 
(D)       Evaluating the vendor's marketing strategies 
Explanation 464. Correct Answer: B. Conducting due 
diligence regarding the vendor’s security practices. 
	
 
692

Conducting due diligence regarding the vendor’s security 
practices ensures that the bank has a comprehensive 
understanding of the vendor’s security posture and past 
performance, aligning with the bank’s concerns for a robust and 
secure online transaction system. 
Option A is incorrect. While a vendor’s sales growth might 
indicate business success, it does not provide insight into their 
security measures. 
Option C is incorrect. The visual appeal of a user interface 
does not provide information on the security measures or 
practices of a vendor. 
Option D is incorrect. Evaluating marketing strategies 
provides no direct insight into the security practices of a vendor.

Policy. A Disaster Recovery Policy details the strategy and 
procedures for recovering IT systems, applications, and data 
	
 
693

after a catastrophic event. Defining Recovery Time Objectives 
(RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) like in this 
scenario are essential components of this policy. 
Option A is incorrect. Data Retention Policy is about how long 
data should be stored and when it should be discarded, not how 
to recover it post-disaster. 
Option B is incorrect. An Incident Response Policy is centered 
around how to handle and respond to security incidents. While 
related, it does not provide the specifics on recovery objectives 
and timelines. 
Option D is incorrect. Password Policy sets the standards for 
password creation and management. It doesn’t have any direct 
relevance to disaster recovery processes. 
Question 466. CyberSecure Inc. is evaluating the financial 
impact of a potential security breach on its main server. The 
company has estimated that a breach of this server would lead 
to a direct financial loss of $500,000 due to data recovery, legal 
fees, and fines. Which of the following best represents this 
estimation? 
(A)       Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO) 
(B)       Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) 
(C)       Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) 
(D)       Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) 
Explanation 466. Correct Answer: C. Single Loss 
Expectancy (SLE). The Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) 
represents the expected monetary loss every time a risk occurs. 
	
 
694

In this case, the company is estimating the direct financial loss 
from a single breach event. 
Option A is incorrect. The Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO) 
represents how often the event is expected to occur in a year, 
not the cost of a single event. 
Option B is incorrect. Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) refers to 
the complete cost of owning a particular asset or solution over 
its lifecycle, not the cost of a single event. 
Option D is incorrect. The Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) 
is a calculated value that represents the expected annual loss, 
based on the SLE and the ARO. 
Question 467. SecureWeb LLC, a web hosting company, has 
experienced two server breaches over the past five years. They 
are currently analyzing the risks associated with their 
infrastructure. Which of the following best represents the 
Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO) for the server breaches? 
(A)       0.2 
(B)       0.4 
(C)       2 
(D)       5  
Explanation 467. Correct Answer: B. 0.4. The Annualized 
Rate of Occurrence (ARO) is a measure of how often an event 
is expected to occur on an annual basis. Given that there have 
been two breaches over five years, the ARO would be 2 
breaches divided by 5 years, which is 0.4. 
	
 
695

Option A is incorrect. While it’s close, the calculation for ARO 
should be the number of occurrences (2) divided by the number 
of years (5), which is 0.4, not 0.2. 
Option C is incorrect. This would indicate two breaches every 
year, which is not the case presented. 
Option D is incorrect. This would suggest that the breaches 
happen five times a year, which is inconsistent with the 
scenario. 
Question 468. An e-commerce company recently faced a DDoS 
attack that rendered its website unavailable for several hours. 
While reflecting on the incident, the CISO emphasized the 
importance of having a detailed plan that includes identification, 
containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned. Which 
policy primarily encompasses these stages for handling security 
incidents? 
(A)       Change Management Policy 
(B)       Incident Response Policy 
(C)       Disaster Recovery Policy 
(D)       Remote Access Policy 
Explanation 468. Correct Answer: B. Incident Response 
Policy. An Incident Response Policy outlines the procedures 
and guidelines for effectively responding to and managing 
security incidents. It includes various stages like identification, 
containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned to 
ensure a systematic approach to handling security threats. 
	
 
696

Option A is incorrect. A Change Management Policy focuses 
on procedures and guidelines for making changes in the IT 
environment to ensure stability and security. It does not deal 
with responding to security incidents directly. 
Option C is incorrect. The Disaster Recovery Policy pertains 
to recovering IT systems, applications, and data after a 
catastrophic event, rather than the steps for managing security 
incidents. 
Option D is incorrect. Remote Access Policy details the 
guidelines for accessing the organization’s network from remote 
locations. It doesn’t provide a structured methodology for 
handling security incidents. 
Question 469. AlphaCorp is in the final stages of selecting a 
cybersecurity consultant. One of the shortlisted firms, 
SecureWorld, recently hired AlphaCorp’s former CISO as a 
senior consultant. Given this situation, what should be 
AlphaCorp’s immediate concern during vendor selection? 
(A)       The expertise the former CISO brings to SecureWorld 
(B)       The possibility that SecureWorld could offer a 
discounted price 
(C)       Potential conflict of interest due to prior associations 
(D)       SecureWorld's global presence and reputation 
Explanation 469. Correct Answer: C. Potential conflict of 
interest due to prior associations. Having the former CISO of 
AlphaCorp in a senior role at SecureWorld might raise concerns 
about potential conflicts of interest. It’s essential to ensure that 
	
 
697

decisions are made objectively, and there’s no bias due to prior 
associations. 
Option A is incorrect. While the expertise of the former CISO 
is valuable, it’s not the primary concern in this context of 
potential conflict of interest. 
Option B is incorrect. Pricing and discounts are not the 
primary concern related to potential conflicts of interest in 
vendor selection. 
Option D is incorrect. While global presence and reputation 
are essential factors for vendor selection, they do not directly 
address the issue of potential conflict of interest arising from the 
former CISO’s position. 
Question 470. WebServ Corp., a web hosting company, has 
been analyzing the reliability of its servers. They found that one 
of their server models, on average, tends to fail once every 2000 
hours and then gets promptly repaired. Which of the following 
metrics is WebServ Corp. evaluating? 
(A)       Recovery Time Objective (RTO) 
(B)       Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) 
(C)       Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) 
(D)       Recovery Point Objective (RPO) 
Explanation 470. Correct Answer: C. Mean Time Between 
Failures (MTBF). MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) is a 
measure of how reliable hardware or a system is. It’s the 
average time that passes from one failure to the next. For 
	
 
698

WebServ Corp., the 2000-hour duration between failures 
reflects the MTBF. 
Option A is incorrect. Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the 
targeted time and service level within which a business process 
must be restored after an interruption to avoid unacceptable 
losses. 
Option B is incorrect. Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) 
represents the average time needed to fix a failed component. 
Option D is incorrect. Recovery Point Objective (RPO) 
measures the amount of data that can be lost, in terms of time, 
without causing harm to the business continuity. 
Question 471. TechFusion Inc. is a well-established technology 
company that has been in the market for over 15 years. 
Recently, the board of directors decided that the company will 
pursue aggressive growth strategies by entering new, untested 
markets and launching cutting-edge products, even if these 
strategies come with significant risks. How would you classify 
TechFusion Inc.’s risk appetite? 
(A)       Conservative 
(B)       Expansionary 
(C)       Neutral 
(D)       Risk-averse 
Explanation 471. Correct Answer: B. Expansionary. 
Expansionary risk appetite is characterized by an entity’s 
willingness to accept a higher level of risk in pursuit of higher 
rewards. Given that TechFusion Inc. is looking to enter new 
	
 
699

markets and launch cutting-edge products, which inherently 
come with significant risks, their risk appetite can be classified 
as expansionary. 
Option A is incorrect. A conservative risk appetite means an 
organization is very cautious and avoids taking significant risks, 
which is the opposite of TechFusion Inc.’s approach. 
Option C is incorrect. Neutral risk appetite means an 
organization neither seeks to take on nor avoid risk, maintaining 
its current risk position. 
Option D is incorrect. Risk-averse is similar to conservative, 
where an organization is very cautious about taking on new 
risks. It doesn’t capture the aggressive growth strategy 
described. 
Question 472. After a significant merger between two large 
corporations, a comprehensive risk assessment was conducted 
to identify potential security gaps within the combined 
infrastructure. This assessment was exclusive to the merger and 
was not planned to be repeated in the future. What type of risk 
assessment was this? 
(A)       Recurring 
(B)       Continuous 
(C)       One-time 
(D)       Dynamic 
Explanation 472. Correct Answer: C. One-time. A one-time 
risk assessment is a unique assessment carried out for a specific 
	
 
700

purpose or event, such as a merger, and is not repeated regularly 
like other types of assessments. 
Option A is incorrect. Recurring risk assessments are 
conducted at regular intervals, such as annually or biannually. 
Option B is incorrect. Continuous risk assessments involve 
ongoing monitoring of risks and do not refer to a single, specific 
assessment. 
Option D is incorrect. Dynamic assessments continuously 
adapt to changing environments or factors, but this term does 
not denote a single, specific assessment. 
Question 473. AcmeTech, a software development firm, 
recently experienced a major data breach that was traced back 
to a vulnerability in their custom-built application. Post-incident 
analysis revealed that the vulnerability had been introduced 
during the coding phase and was never detected during testing. 
To avoid such vulnerabilities in the future, which policy should 
AcmeTech emphasize to ensure secure practices are maintained 
throughout the development process? 
(A)       Incident Response Policy 
(B)       Change Management Policy 
(C)       Business Continuity Policy 
(D)       Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Policy 
Explanation 473. Correct Answer: D. Software Development 
Lifecycle (SDLC) Policy. The Software Development Lifecycle 
(SDLC) Policy provides guidelines and standards for each 
phase of the software development process, ensuring that 
	
 
701

security is integrated at every step, from requirement gathering 
to deployment and maintenance. 
Option A is incorrect. While an Incident Response Policy 
provides a structured approach to manage and respond to 
security incidents, it does not focus on the software 
development process. 
Option B is incorrect. The Change Management Policy deals 
with procedures for implementing changes in the IT 
environment but doesn’t specifically cater to the development of 
software applications. 
Option C is incorrect. A Business Continuity Policy focuses 
on maintaining business operations during and after a disruption 
and doesn’t address the specifics of software development. 
Question 474. An organization is conducting a risk assessment 
for its cloud infrastructure. The assessment has determined that 
the likelihood of a data breach through an insecure API is 
“High.” What factors may have contributed to this likelihood 
rating? 
(A)       The API has been thoroughly tested and has a known 
secure configuration 
(B)       There are few records of this kind of breach in the 
industry 
(C)       The API is publicly accessible and has had several 
vulnerabilities reported in the past six months 
(D)       The cloud provider offers a guaranteed SLA against any 
form of security breach 
	
 
702

Explanation 474. Correct Answer: C. The API is publicly 
accessible and has had several vulnerabilities reported in 
the past six months. A publicly accessible API with a history 
of recent vulnerabilities significantly increases the likelihood of 
a breach, making this scenario the best fit for a “High” 
likelihood rating. 
Option A is incorrect. A thoroughly tested and known secure 
configuration would likely reduce the likelihood rating. 
Option B is incorrect. Few records of similar breaches would 
also likely reduce the assessed likelihood. 
Option D is incorrect. A guaranteed SLA might offer remedies 
post-breach, but it does not inherently reduce the likelihood of a 
breach occurring. 
Question 475. SecureNet Ltd. wants to protect user accounts 
from brute force attacks. They want to implement a measure 
where, after a certain number of failed login attempts, the 
account would become temporarily inaccessible. Which 
standard best suits this requirement? 
(A)       Password minimum length 
(B)       Account lockout threshold 
(C)       Mandatory password resets 
(D)       Two-factor authentication 
Explanation 475. Correct Answer: B. Account lockout 
threshold. The account lockout threshold defines the number of 
consecutive failed login attempts after which a user account is 
locked out, preventing further attempts for a specified duration. 
	
 
703

This measure directly deters brute force attacks by making 
rapid, repeated login attempts unfeasible. 
Option A is incorrect. Password minimum length dictates how 
long a password must be, which can deter certain brute force 
attempts but doesn’t address the rapid, repeated attempts 
characteristic of such attacks. 
Option C is incorrect. Mandatory password resets force users 
to change their passwords at regular intervals. While this might 
protect against the use of older stolen credentials, it doesn’t 
prevent brute force attacks. 
Option D is incorrect. Two-factor authentication requires two 
forms of identification to access an account. Although it 
significantly enhances security, it doesn’t limit login attempts 
based on failed attempts. 
Question 476. After a recent security breach, CyberSolutions 
Inc. evaluated their response metrics and determined that, on 
average, it took 4 hours from identifying a security breach to 
having it completely resolved. Which metric best describes this 
4-hour timeframe? 
(A)       Recovery Time Objective (RTO) 
(B)       Recovery Point Objective (RPO) 
(C)       Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) 
(D)       Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) 
Explanation 476. Correct Answer: D. Mean Time To Repair 
(MTTR). MTTR (Mean Time To Repair) is a basic measure of 
the maintainability of repairable items. It represents the average 
	
 
704

time required to repair a failed component or device. For 
CyberSolutions Inc., the 4-hour duration from identifying to 
resolving the breach reflects the MTTR. 
Option A is incorrect. Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the 
targeted duration of time within which a business process must 
be restored after a disaster to avoid unacceptable consequences. 
Option B is incorrect. Recovery Point Objective (RPO) 
represents the maximum acceptable amount of data loss 
measured in time. 
Option C is incorrect. Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) 
is the predicted elapsed time between inherent failures of a 
mechanical or electronic system, during normal system 
operation. 
Question 477. SecureCom, a telecommunications company, is 
planning to expand its infrastructure across Country A. The 
nation recently updated its telecommunications regulations and 
mandates strict guidelines for all external communications. 
Which of the following should be SecureCom’s primary focus 
as it begins its expansion? 
(A)       Increasing advertising budget to gain a stronger market 
presence in Country A 
(B)       Ensuring its infrastructure meets the national 
standards for secure and encrypted communications 
(C)       Collaborating with local tech companies to better 
understand the culture of Country A 
(D)       Launching new products tailored to the preferences of 
Country A's residents 
	
 
705

Explanation 477. Correct Answer: B. Ensuring its 
infrastructure meets the national standards for secure and 
encrypted communications. Telecommunication companies, 
by their nature, handle vast amounts of data and communication 
traffic. As such, when a nation mandates specific security 
guidelines for external communications, companies like 
SecureCom must ensure their infrastructure complies with those 
guidelines to avoid legal and financial repercussions. 
Option A is incorrect. While advertising is essential for market 
growth, the primary concern when expanding infrastructure in a 
country with strict telecommunications regulations should be 
compliance. 
Option C is incorrect. Collaborating with local tech companies 
can offer insights into the local market, but regulatory 
compliance should remain the primary focus, especially given 
the updated regulations. 
Option D is incorrect. Launching tailored products is a sound 
business strategy, but without ensuring compliance with 
national regulations, the company might face significant 
challenges. 
Question 478. During an audit review at NetSecure Corp., the 
external auditors observed that the company is willing to take 
risks that can potentially result in a 10% decrease in their annual 
profits, but no more than that. The auditors want to document 
this finding in their report. Which term should they use to 
describe NetSecure Corp.’s stance? 
(A)       Risk Avoidance 
	
 
706

(B)       Risk Transfer 
(C)       Risk Tolerance 
(D)       Risk Assessment 
Explanation 478. Correct Answer: C. Risk Tolerance. Risk 
tolerance represents the maximum amount of risk an entity is 
willing to accept or tolerate. NetSecure Corp.’s acceptance of 
risks that can result in up to a 10% decrease in annual profits 
represents their risk tolerance level. 
Option A is incorrect. Risk avoidance means completely 
sidestepping any activities that have associated risks. The 
scenario indicates that the company is willing to take risks, but 
within certain limits. 
Option B is incorrect. Risk transfer involves offloading certain 
risks to other parties, typically through insurance or other 
contractual methods. The scenario doesn’t provide information 
about transferring risks. 
Option D is incorrect. Risk assessment is the overall process of 
identifying, analyzing, and evaluating risks. The scenario is 
more focused on the company’s willingness to accept a specific 
level of risk rather than assessing it. 
Question 479. TechGuard Corp. conducts a risk assessment 
every six months to identify new vulnerabilities and ensure that 
previous risk-mitigation strategies remain effective. This type of 
risk assessment is best described as: 
(A)       Periodic 
(B)       Ad hoc 
	
 
707

(C)       Continuous 
(D)       Recurring 
Explanation 479. Correct Answer: D. Recurring. Recurring 
risk assessments are those that are conducted at regular 
intervals, such as quarterly, biannually, or annually, to 
continually identify, review, and address vulnerabilities and 
threats. 
Option A is incorrect. While “periodic” might sound similar to 
“recurring”, in the context of risk assessments, the term 
“recurring” more accurately describes assessments that are 
conducted regularly at defined intervals. 
Option B is incorrect. Ad hoc risk assessments are done in 
response to a specific event or situation and are not planned in 
advance. 
Option C is incorrect. Continuous risk assessments involve 
constant or ongoing monitoring of risks, rather than taking place 
at set intervals. 
Question 480. CyberFleet Inc., a software development 
company, has just heard of a newly discovered vulnerability in a 
third-party library they heavily rely upon. The security team 
quickly gathers to understand and analyze the potential risks 
associated with this vulnerability. This spontaneous assessment 
is best described as: 
(A)       Routine 
(B)       Ad hoc 
	
 
708

(C)       Scheduled 
(D)       Benchmark   
Explanation 480. Correct Answer: B. Ad hoc. An ad hoc risk 
assessment is done in response to a specific event or situation 
and is not planned in advance. 
Option A is incorrect. Routine assessments, similar to periodic 
ones, are performed at regular intervals and are not typically in 
response to sudden events. 
Option C is incorrect. Scheduled risk assessments are planned 
and occur at predetermined times or intervals. 
Option D is incorrect. Benchmark assessments are evaluations 
that compare an organization’s processes or performance 
against a set standard or best practices in the industry. 
Question 481. TechFlow Corp. is undergoing a risk analysis for 
its online platform. If a critical vulnerability were exploited, the 
company would have to pay $10,000 in repair costs, $5,000 in 
compensation to customers, and a $15,000 fine to regulatory 
bodies. What would be the Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) for 
this vulnerability? 
(A)       $10,000 
(B)       $20,000 
(C)       $30,000 
(D)       $50,000 
Explanation 481. Correct Answer: C. $30,000. Single Loss 
Expectancy (SLE) is the cost of a single event or incident. In 
	
 
709

this scenario, adding up the repair costs, compensations, and 
fines gives: $10,000 + $5,000 + $15,000 = $30,000. 
Option A is incorrect. This only accounts for the repair costs. 
Option B is incorrect. This only considers the repair costs and 
compensations but omits the fines. 
Option D is incorrect. This value exceeds the combined costs 
from the vulnerability being exploited. 
Question 482. GlobalTech, a multinational corporation, is 
negotiating a cloud storage contract with CloudCorp. 
GlobalTech wants to ensure that data retrieval times remain 
under 2 seconds 99.9% of the time. Which component should be 
explicitly defined in their agreement to set this expectation? 
(A)       Pricing model 
(B)       Data sovereignty clauses 
(C)       Service-level agreement (SLA) 
(D)       Termination clauses 
Explanation 482. Correct Answer: C. Service-level 
agreement (SLA). Service-level agreements (SLAs) are 
designed to define specific metrics, responsibilities, and 
expectations to ensure that both parties understand and agree to 
the performance benchmarks and consequences if those 
benchmarks are not achieved. In this scenario, the SLA would 
specify the expected data retrieval times. 
	
 
710

Option A is incorrect. While pricing is an essential aspect of 
any contract, it does not specify performance expectations like 
data retrieval times. 
Option B is incorrect. Data sovereignty clauses pertain to the 
legal aspects of where data is stored and processed, not to 
performance metrics. 
Option D is incorrect. Termination clauses deal with the 
conditions under which the agreement might be terminated, not 
with performance expectations. 
Question 483. A software development company is evaluating 
the risks associated with a newly discovered vulnerability in its 
application. After reviewing logs and simulating potential 
attacks, the security team estimates that there is a 0.25 
probability of the vulnerability being exploited in the next year. 
What does this probability indicate? 
(A)       The vulnerability has a 1 in 4 chance of being 
exploited in the next year 
(B)       The vulnerability will certainly be exploited four times 
in the next year 
(C)       The vulnerability has been exploited 25 times in the past 
year 
(D)       Every fourth customer will exploit the vulnerability. 
Explanation 483. Correct Answer: A. The vulnerability has 
a 1 in 4 chance of being exploited in the next year. A 
probability of 0.25 indicates a 25% chance, or a 1 in 4 
likelihood, of an event occurring. 
	
 
711

Option B is incorrect. A probability value doesn’t predict a 
definite number of occurrences, just the likelihood of an 
occurrence. 
Option C is incorrect. The probability figure given is an 
estimate of future risk, not a tally of past events. 
Option D is incorrect. The probability provided is not about 
customers but about the chance of the vulnerability being 
exploited. 
Question 484. A global e-commerce company maintains a risk 
register to keep track of identified risks and to monitor specific 
metrics that might indicate an increased risk level. Recently, 
there has been a 20% increase in abandoned shopping carts on 
their platform. How should this metric be categorized in the 
context of the risk register? 
(A)       Risk Appetite 
(B)       Risk Mitigation Strategy 
(C)       Key Risk Indicator (KRI) 
(D)       Risk Tolerance Threshold 
Explanation 484. Correct Answer: C. Key Risk Indicator 
(KRI). Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) are metrics used to measure 
and provide an early signal of increasing risk exposures in 
various areas of an organization. In this scenario, the 20% 
increase in abandoned shopping carts can serve as a KRI, 
signaling potential issues like site performance, security 
concerns, or user experience that may need to be addressed. 
	
 
712

Option A is incorrect. Risk appetite refers to the amount of risk 
an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives. 
The increase in abandoned carts doesn’t measure this. 
Option B is incorrect. A risk mitigation strategy describes 
actions an organization plans to take to address risks. The 
metric provided is a measure, not an action or strategy. 
Option D is incorrect. Risk tolerance threshold indicates the 
amount of risk an organization is willing to tolerate. The 
scenario describes a metric that might indicate an issue, not a 
predefined threshold. 
Question 485. A financial institution has reported that they 
experience an average of 3 phishing attacks every year that 
attempt to compromise their user data. Based on this data, what 
is the Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO) for these phishing 
attacks? 
(A)       0.33 
(B)       1 
(C)       3 
(D)       12 
Explanation 485. Correct Answer: C. 3. The Annualized Rate 
of Occurrence (ARO) represents the expected frequency of a 
specific event or risk occurring each year. Given that the 
financial institution experiences 3 phishing attacks every year, 
the ARO is 3. 
	
 
713

Option A is incorrect. An ARO of 0.33 would indicate that the 
event happens approximately once every three years, not thrice 
in a year. 
Option B is incorrect. An ARO of 1 would suggest the event 
happens once a year, which is not consistent with the scenario. 
Option D is incorrect. This would indicate the event occurs 12 
times a year or once a month, which is not the case based on the 
information provided. 
Question 486. During a board meeting at DataFlow Corp., the 
CEO emphasizes that while they are willing to take certain risks 
for innovation, there’s a limit to the amount of risk they are 
willing to take, especially concerning potential financial losses. 
To ensure that risks stay below this level, what should be 
defined in the risk register? 
(A)       Risk Owner Assignment 
(B)       Key Risk Indicator (KRI) 
(C)       Risk Impact Analysis 
(D)       Risk Threshold 
Explanation 486. Correct Answer: D. Risk Threshold. The 
risk threshold indicates the maximum level of risk an 
organization is willing to tolerate or accept. Setting a clear risk 
threshold ensures that any risks that surpass this level are given 
priority for management or mitigation. 
Option A is incorrect. While assigning a Risk Owner is crucial 
for accountability, it doesn’t define the maximum level of risk 
an organization is willing to tolerate. 
	
 
714

Option B is incorrect. A Key Risk Indicator (KRI) provides 
early signals of increasing risk exposures. While they are 
essential for monitoring risks, they don’t establish the maximum 
tolerable risk level. 
Option C is incorrect. Risk Impact Analysis assesses the 
potential consequences of a given risk but doesn’t set a level 
indicating the maximum risk the organization is prepared to 
accept. 
Question 487. XYZ Corporation recently implemented a 
security solution that constantly evaluates the company’s threat 
landscape, monitoring for emerging risks and immediately 
alerting the security team of any changes. This assessment 
model allows the team to rapidly adapt their security posture in 
response to live threats. What type of risk assessment is XYZ 
Corporation utilizing? 
(A)       One-time 
(B)       Periodic 
(C)       Dynamic 
(D)       Continuous 
Explanation 487. Correct Answer: D. Continuous. 
Continuous risk assessments involve ongoing and real-time 
monitoring of risks, enabling an organization to instantly react 
to emerging threats and vulnerabilities. 
Option A is incorrect. A one-time risk assessment is specific to 
a single event or purpose and is not intended to be repeated 
regularly. 
	
 
715

Option B is incorrect. Periodic risk assessments are carried out 
at scheduled intervals, such as annually or biannually, and are 
not ongoing. 
Option C is incorrect. Dynamic assessments can adapt to 
changing environments or factors, but “dynamic” doesn’t 
specifically denote ongoing, real-time assessment like 
“continuous” does. 
Question 488. Your organization is considering a partnership 
with TechVendor Inc., a software solution provider. Before 
finalizing the agreement, you wish to ensure their application’s 
security. What would be the most direct method to assess the 
robustness of their system against potential cyber threats? 
(A)       Conducting an internal security awareness training 
(B)       Reviewing their past audit reports 
(C)       Implementing strict firewall rules 
(D)       Performing a penetration test on their application. 
Explanation 488. Correct Answer: D. Performing a 
penetration test on their application. Penetration testing is a 
proactive method used to evaluate the security of an application 
by simulating an attack from malicious outsiders or insiders. It 
provides a direct measure of the vulnerabilities present in the 
application that could potentially be exploited by an attacker. 
Option A is incorrect. While security awareness training is 
crucial for educating staff about security best practices, it does 
not directly assess the security of an external vendor’s 
application. 
	
 
716

Option B is incorrect. Past audit reports can provide valuable 
insights into a vendor’s security posture, but they do not offer 
real-time assessment like penetration testing. 
Option C is incorrect. Implementing firewall rules is a 
protective measure, but it does not evaluate the current security 
of the vendor’s application. 
Question 489. MedGuard, a health tech company, has 
developed an AI-driven software that predicts potential health 
risks based on patient data. Before launching in the U.S. market, 
which of the following industry external considerations should 
be the company’s primary focus? 
(A)       Integrating with popular fitness tracking apps in the 
U.S. 
(B)       Ensuring compliance with the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 
(C)       Surveying U.S. doctors about software interface 
preferences 
(D)       Collaborating with U.S. pharmaceutical companies for 
promotional deals 
Explanation 489. Correct Answer: B. Ensuring compliance 
with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act (HIPAA). HIPAA is a U.S. law designed to provide privacy 
standards to protect patients’ medical records and other health 
information. For MedGuard, which deals with patient data, 
ensuring HIPAA compliance is paramount before launching 
their software in the U.S. market. 
	
 
717

Option A is incorrect. While integration with fitness tracking 
apps may enhance the software’s functionality, the primary 
concern when dealing with patient data in the U.S. is 
compliance with HIPAA. 
Option C is incorrect. Although feedback from doctors might 
help improve the software’s user interface, the primary industry 
external consideration should be regulatory compliance, 
especially when handling sensitive health information. 
Option D is incorrect. While partnerships with pharmaceutical 
companies might be beneficial for marketing or business 
growth, the primary industry consideration for a health tech 
company dealing with patient data is ensuring compliance with 
relevant regulations. 
Question 490. During a company’s onboarding process, new 
employees are required to read and acknowledge understanding 
of various company policies. The HR department wants to 
ensure that employees are aware of their responsibilities when it 
comes to the use of company devices and internet resources. 
Which policy should be included in the onboarding packet to 
address this? 
(A)       Password Complexity Policy 
(B)       Data Classification Policy 
(C)       Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) 
(D)       Vendor Management Policy 
Explanation 490. Correct Answer: C. Acceptable Use Policy 
(AUP). The Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) outlines the do’s and 
don’ts for employees regarding the use of company devices, 
	
 
718

networks, and other IT resources. Including this in the 
onboarding packet will ensure that new hires are aware of their 
responsibilities. 
Option A is incorrect. While important, the Password 
Complexity Policy primarily deals with the requirements for 
creating and managing passwords, not the overall acceptable 
use of IT resources. 
Option B is incorrect. A Data Classification Policy focuses on 
the categorization of data based on its sensitivity. It doesn’t 
provide guidelines on the acceptable use of IT resources. 
Option D is incorrect. The Vendor Management Policy 
governs the relationship and security expectations between the 
company and its vendors, not the acceptable use of company IT 
resources by employees. 
Question 491. XYZ Corp is in the process of defining clear 
roles and responsibilities for their IT assets. During a meeting, 
the team discussed the primary individual who will have the 
responsibility for the data within a specific IT system and also 
be the main point of contact for any decisions related to it. 
Which of the following roles best describes this individual? 
(A)       System administrator 
(B)       Data custodian 
(C)       System owner 
(D)       End-user 
Explanation 491. Correct Answer: C. System owner. The 
system owner, sometimes known as the data owner, is typically 
	
 
719

responsible for the data within a specific IT system. They have 
the primary responsibility for ensuring the confidentiality, 
integrity, and availability of the data and act as the main point of 
contact for decisions related to that system. 
Option A is incorrect. A system administrator is responsible 
for the daily management, operations, and support of IT systems 
but doesn’t usually make high-level decisions about the data 
contained within them. 
Option B is incorrect. A data custodian is typically responsible 
for implementing the controls and processes as defined by the 
data owner. They may handle the practical aspects of data 
management, but they don’t usually make overarching decisions 
about the data. 
Option D is incorrect. An end-user utilizes the data or system 
for their job function but doesn’t typically have decision-
making responsibilities regarding the data’s overall 
management and protection. 
Question 492. As the Chief Security Officer (CSO) of 
AlphaTech, you are in the process of finalizing a partnership 
agreement with a third-party provider. To ensure ongoing 
security compliance and transparency, you want to reserve the 
right for your organization to inspect the vendor’s operations 
and security measures in the future. Which clause should you 
ensure is included in the contract? 
(A)       Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) 
(B)       Service level agreement (SLA) 
	
 
720

(C)       Termination clause 
(D)       Right-to-audit clause 
Explanation 492. Correct Answer: D. Right-to-audit clause. 
The right-to-audit clause allows an organization to review or 
audit a vendor’s procedures, systems, records, and practices to 
ensure they comply with agreed-upon security and privacy 
requirements. 
Option A is incorrect. While an NDA is essential to protect 
confidential information, it doesn’t give an organization the 
right to audit a vendor’s practices. 
Option B is incorrect. An SLA sets expectations around the 
quality and availability of services provided, but it doesn’t 
pertain to the right to audit. 
Option C is incorrect. A termination clause defines the 
conditions under which a partnership can be ended, but it 
doesn’t grant audit rights. 
Question 493. CyberGuard LLC, a cybersecurity firm, is in a 
stable position in its industry with consistent returns. The 
leadership decides not to pursue aggressive growth strategies 
but instead chooses to maintain its current market share and 
operational scale. They are open to minor risks but avoid major 
disruptions. How can one best describe CyberGuard LLC’s risk 
appetite? 
(A)       Expansionary 
(B)       Neutral 
	
 
721

(C)       Conservative 
(D)       Aggressive 
Explanation 493. Correct Answer: B. Neutral. A neutral risk 
appetite means an organization is neither aggressively pursuing 
risks for high rewards nor entirely avoiding them. Given that 
CyberGuard LLC is looking to maintain its current position and 
is open to minor risks, their risk appetite can be classified as 
neutral. 
Option A is incorrect. Expansionary risk appetite denotes an 
organization’s willingness to accept higher risks to achieve 
potentially higher rewards, which doesn’t align with 
CyberGuard LLC’s strategy. 
Option C is incorrect. While CyberGuard LLC is cautious, 
their stance is not entirely against taking risks. A conservative 
appetite would imply they avoid most risks, but they are open to 
minor ones. 
Option D is incorrect. Aggressive would imply a strong 
willingness to take on significant risks, which is not the stance 
described for CyberGuard LLC. 
Question 494. Two university research departments, UniAlpha 
and UniBeta, decide to collaborate on a project exploring 
quantum computing’s security implications. They need an 
agreement to express mutual intentions without enforcing 
legally binding obligations. Which document is most suitable 
for their needs? 
(A)       Service-level agreement (SLA) 
	
 
722

(B)       Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) 
(C)       Memorandum of understanding (MOU) 
(D)       Licensing agreement 
Explanation 494. Correct Answer: C. Memorandum of 
understanding (MOU). A Memorandum of Understanding 
(MOU) serves as a formal agreement between parties to signal 
mutual intentions without necessarily introducing legally 
binding terms. Given that UniAlpha and UniBeta want to 
signify their shared intentions on a collaborative research 
project, an MOU is the most appropriate choice. 
Option A is incorrect. An SLA is typically between a service 
provider and a customer and details the level of service 
expected. 
Option B is incorrect. An NDA focuses on the confidentiality 
of information shared between parties. 
Option D is incorrect. A licensing agreement concerns the 
rights to use, distribute, or reproduce software or intellectual 
property. 
Question 495. TechFirm is preparing to embark on a new 
project with a client, focusing on implementing a cybersecurity 
infrastructure overhaul. They wish to lay out the specific tasks, 
deliverables, timelines, and resources required for this project. 
Which type of agreement would best capture these details? 
(A)       Memorandum of understanding (MOU) 
(B)       Joint venture agreement 
	
 
723

(C)       Master service agreement (MSA) 
(D)       Work order (WO)/statement of work (SOW) 
Explanation 495. Correct Answer: D. Work order (WO)/
statement of work (SOW). A Work order (WO) or statement of 
work (SOW) is tailored to outline the specifics of a particular 
job or project. It often includes details such as tasks, 
deliverables, schedules, and necessary resources. Given that 
TechFirm seeks to describe the details of their cybersecurity 
overhaul project, the WO/SOW is the most appropriate choice. 
Option A is incorrect. An MOU is a more general agreement 
signifying mutual intentions, but it doesn’t delve into specific 
tasks or deliverables of a particular project. 
Option B is incorrect. A joint venture agreement is mainly 
concerned with the creation of a new entity or project involving 
multiple parties, highlighting their roles and responsibilities. 
Option C is incorrect. A Master service agreement (MSA) 
provides a broad framework covering the terms and conditions 
of business transactions between parties. It doesn’t specify 
details of individual projects. 
Question 496. AcmeBank recently performed a business impact 
analysis for its online banking system. The result indicated that 
the bank could tolerate a maximum downtime of 4 hours for the 
system before incurring significant financial losses and 
customer dissatisfaction. Which concept best describes this 4-
hour period? 
(A)       Recovery Point Objective (RPO) 
	
 
724

(B)       Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) 
(C)       Recovery Time Objective (RTO) 
(D)       Time To Restore (TTR) 
Explanation 496. Correct Answer: C. Recovery Time 
Objective (RTO). The Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the 
targeted duration of time within which a business process must 
be restored after a disruption in order to avoid unacceptable 
consequences. In this scenario, AcmeBank’s RTO for its online 
banking system is 4 hours. 
Option A is incorrect. Recovery Point Objective (RPO) 
describes the maximum age of files that an organization must 
recover from backup storage for normal operations to resume 
after a disaster. It doesn’t refer to the time duration. 
Option B is incorrect. Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) 
is the longest period of time that a business process can be 
down before causing irreparable harm to the business. While 
related, the question specifically describes the RTO. 
Option D is incorrect. Time To Restore (TTR) is often a metric 
to measure the time it takes to restore a particular process or 
system. However, the scenario directly describes an RTO. 
Question 497. DigitalZone Corp, a marketing company, 
collects personal data from users and determines how and why 
that data will be processed. At the same time, they engage an 
external company, CloudSolutions, to store and manage this 
data. In this scenario, what role does DigitalZone Corp play in 
relation to data protection regulations? 
	
 
725

(A)       Processor 
(B)       Data subject 
(C)       Controller 
(D)       Third-party provider 
Explanation 497. Correct Answer: C. Controller. DigitalZone 
Corp makes decisions about how and why the data is processed, 
which means they play the role of the controller in the context 
of data protection regulations. 
Option A is incorrect. The processor is the entity that processes 
personal data on behalf of the controller. In this scenario, 
CloudSolutions acts as the processor as they are storing and 
managing the data for DigitalZone Corp. 
Option B is incorrect. The data subject is the individual whose 
personal data is being collected. It’s not an entity that makes 
decisions about the data or processes it. 
Option D is incorrect. While CloudSolutions could be 
considered a third-party provider, this term is broader and does 
not specifically refer to an entity’s role in data protection terms 
as a controller or processor. 
Question 498. TechFirm Inc. has decided to engage in a new 
business venture. Before they move forward, the security team 
conducts several brainstorming sessions, interviews, and 
reviews historical data to generate a list of potential security 
threats that the new venture could face. This activity is a 
primary component of which step in the risk management 
process? 
	
 
726

(A)       Risk assessment 
(B)       Risk response 
(C)       Risk monitoring 
(D)       Risk identification 
Explanation 498. Correct Answer: D. Risk identification. 
Risk identification is the initial process of detecting and 
describing risks that could potentially affect the achievement of 
objectives. 
Option A is incorrect. Risk assessment encompasses the 
overall process of identifying, analyzing, and evaluating risks, 
but the specific activity mentioned is related to risk 
identification. 
Option B is incorrect. Risk response involves deciding on the 
most suitable approach to address identified risks, whether it’s 
accepting, avoiding, transferring, or mitigating them. 
Option C is incorrect. Risk monitoring is about tracking 
identified risks, monitoring residual risks, and identifying new 
risks. The specific activity of brainstorming and gathering data 
about risks falls under risk identification. 
Question 499. A healthcare organization uses a software 
platform to manage patient records. A recent vulnerability 
assessment identified a potential exploit where an unauthorized 
individual might gain access to 30% of stored patient data. 
Which of the following BEST describes this scenario? 
(A)       The threat likelihood is 30% 
(B)       The vulnerability has a 30% rate of occurrence 
	
 
727

(C)       The exposure factor of the vulnerability is 30% 
(D)       30% of the patients have been impacted 
Explanation 499. Correct Answer: C. The exposure factor of 
the vulnerability is 30%. The exposure factor is a measure of 
the magnitude of loss or percentage of asset value that a realized 
threat would destroy or damage. In this case, the vulnerability 
could lead to 30% of patient data being accessed. 
Option A is incorrect. Likelihood refers to the probability of an 
event happening, not the potential impact or amount of data that 
might be exposed. 
Option B is incorrect. The rate of occurrence (ARO) is a 
measure of how often a specific event will occur, not the 
potential impact or amount of data that might be exposed. 
Option D is incorrect. The scenario does not indicate that 30% 
of patients have already been impacted, only that their data 
might be accessed if the vulnerability is exploited. 
Question 500. XYZ Corporation recently faced a major power 
outage that affected their primary data center. During the 
incident, it was found that there was no clear guidance on the 
steps to maintain or quickly restore business operations. To 
address this, which of the following policies should XYZ 
Corporation prioritize implementing? 
(A)       Data Classification Policy 
(B)       Business Continuity Policy 
(C)       Acceptable Use Policy 
(D)       Network Segmentation Strategy 
	
 
728

Explanation 500. Correct Answer: B. Business Continuity 
Policy. A Business Continuity Policy outlines the processes and 
procedures an organization should follow to ensure that 
essential functions can continue during and after a disaster. It 
provides a roadmap for maintaining and quickly restoring 
business operations. 
Option A is incorrect. The Data Classification Policy is 
concerned with categorizing data based on its sensitivity but 
doesn’t address continuity of business operations during 
disruptions. 
Option C is incorrect. The Acceptable Use Policy specifies 
how the organization’s IT resources and networks can be used 
by employees. It doesn’t provide guidance on restoring business 
operations during a disaster. 
Option D is incorrect. While Network Segmentation Strategy 
is crucial for security, dividing the network into segments does 
not specifically address business continuity during major 
disruptions. 
Question 501. AlphaTech wants to ensure that its remote 
employees follow best security practices when working from 
home. The security team has been tasked with drafting a set of 
guidelines for remote work. What should be the primary focus 
of these guidelines? 
(A)       Outlining punitive measures for non-compliance 
(B)       Stating the company's legal position on remote work 
(C)       Recommending security measures for home 
networks and devices 
	
 
729

(D)       Dictating the exact software and hardware specifications 
for remote workers 
Explanation 501. Correct Answer: C. Recommending 
security measures for home networks and devices. 
Guidelines aim to provide advice and recommendations. In the 
context of remote work, they would suggest best security 
practices for securing home networks and devices without being 
overly prescriptive. 
Option A is incorrect. Punitive measures and compliance 
repercussions are typically outlined in policies or procedures, 
not guidelines. 
Option B is incorrect. The company’s legal position on remote 
work would be part of a policy or a legal document rather than a 
set of guidelines. 
Option D is incorrect. Dictating exact software and hardware 
specifications would be more in line with standards rather than 
guidelines. Guidelines would provide broader 
recommendations. 
Question 502. Lisa, a security manager, is reviewing the 
company’s existing policies and realizes that there isn’t a 
comprehensive document detailing the organization’s stance, 
expectations, and commitment to protecting its information 
assets. Which of the following should Lisa prioritize creating to 
address this gap? 
(A)       Incident Response Plan 
(B)       Information Security Policy 
	
 
730

(C)       Acceptable Use Policy 
(D)       Data Backup Strategy 
Explanation 502. Correct Answer: B. Information Security 
Policy. An Information Security Policy is a foundational 
document that provides a framework for information security 
throughout the organization. It encompasses the organization’s 
vision, principles, and responsibilities regarding the protection 
of its data and IT assets. 
Option A is incorrect. An Incident Response Plan focuses on 
the steps to be taken after a security incident has occurred. It 
does not detail the overall stance of an organization on 
information security. 
Option C is incorrect. An Acceptable Use Policy provides 
guidelines on how employees should use company resources, 
but it doesn’t provide a comprehensive overview of an 
organization’s commitment to protecting its information assets. 
Option D is incorrect. While a Data Backup Strategy is crucial 
for data availability and recovery, it does not convey the broader 
perspective and commitment of the organization to information 
security. 
Question 503. TechFusion and CodeRush, two independent 
software development companies, are collaborating on a project 
that is expected to define industry standards for a new coding 
language. While both parties have an understanding of shared 
responsibilities, they have not yet established legally binding 
obligations. Which type of agreement best suits their current 
	
 
731

collaborative understanding? 
(A)       Service-level agreement (SLA) 
(B)       Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) 
(C)       Memorandum of agreement (MOA) 
(D)       Licensing agreement 
Explanation 503. Correct Answer: C. Memorandum of 
agreement (MOA). A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) 
outlines mutual understandings and responsibilities between 
two or more parties and does not necessarily contain legally 
binding obligations. In this scenario, TechFusion and CodeRush 
have a shared understanding but have not reached legally 
binding terms, making an MOA the most appropriate choice. 
Option A is incorrect. An SLA specifies performance metrics 
and expectations between a service provider and a customer. It 
doesn’t necessarily suit a collaborative project aiming to define 
industry standards. 
Option B is incorrect. An NDA pertains to the confidentiality 
of information and would not define mutual understandings or 
responsibilities related to project collaboration. 
Option D is incorrect. A licensing agreement typically deals 
with the rights to use, distribute, or reproduce software or 
intellectual property. 
Question 504. As part of improving their security posture, 
TechHive Inc. decided to review their existing password 
policies. The current policy requires employees to use at least 
one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character. 
	
 
732

However, they found that users mostly only make minimal 
changes to their passwords during resets. Which standard 
should be integrated into their policy to ensure passwords are 
more complex and unique over time? 
(A)       Password history retention 
(B)       Password expiration period 
(C)       Account lockout duration 
(D)       Maximum password age 
Explanation 504. Correct Answer: A. Password history 
retention. Password history retention ensures that users cannot 
reuse a certain number of previous passwords, forcing them to 
come up with unique passwords rather than making only minor 
changes to their current ones. 
Option B is incorrect. The password expiration period dictates 
how long a password is valid before prompting the user for a 
change. While it can make users change passwords frequently, it 
doesn’t prevent them from making minimal changes. 
Option C is incorrect. Account lockout duration specifies the 
time an account remains locked after a predefined number of 
incorrect login attempts. It doesn’t ensure password complexity 
or uniqueness over time. 
Option D is incorrect. Maximum password age defines how 
long a password can be used before it must be changed. Like 
Option B, it doesn’t prevent users from making minimal 
changes to their passwords. 
	
 
733

Question 505. CyberTech Inc., a cybersecurity consulting 
company, is in discussions with a potential client, MedCorp, to 
assist in developing a new secure medical records system. 
MedCorp will be sharing sensitive patient data with CyberTech 
as part of the process. Which agreement should be in place 
before the sharing of such information to ensure confidentiality? 
(A)       Memorandum of understanding (MOU) 
(B)       Service-level agreement (SLA) 
(C)       Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) 
(D)       Work order (WO)/statement of work (SOW) 
Explanation 505. Correct Answer: C. Non-disclosure 
agreement (NDA). An NDA (Non-disclosure agreement) is 
specifically designed to safeguard confidential information that 
is shared between two parties. It ensures that the receiving party 
doesn’t disclose or misuse the information provided. Given the 
sensitive nature of the patient data that MedCorp will share, an 
NDA is crucial. 
Option A is incorrect. An MOU signifies mutual intentions and 
understanding between parties but doesn’t specifically cater to 
the confidentiality of shared information. 
Option B is incorrect. A service-level agreement (SLA) is 
primarily about the level of service to be provided, detailing 
performance metrics, and penalties for non-compliance. It 
doesn’t inherently focus on data confidentiality. 
Option D is incorrect. A Work order (WO) or statement of 
work (SOW) details the specifics of a project, from tasks to 
	
 
734

milestones, but doesn’t directly address the confidentiality of 
shared data. 
Question 506. AlphaTech is conducting a risk analysis on their 
new online payment gateway. They’ve calculated the Annual 
Rate of Occurrence (ARO) for a specific vulnerability as 2, and 
the Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) as $50,000. How much 
should AlphaTech anticipate losing annually due to this 
vulnerability? 
(A)       $10,000 
(B)       $100,000 
(C)       $25,000 
(D)       $1,000,000 
Explanation 506. Correct Answer: B. $100,000. The 
Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) is calculated by 
multiplying the Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO) by the 
Single Loss Expectancy (SLE). In this scenario, ALE = 2 x 
$50,000 = $100,000. 
Option A is incorrect. This does not correctly apply the 
formula for ALE. 
Option C is incorrect. This is half of the Single Loss 
Expectancy and does not represent an annual loss. 
Option D is incorrect. This amount is significantly higher than 
the calculated ALE. 
Question 507. WhiteCape Healthcare, an international 
healthcare provider, has a large patient database that includes 
	
 
735

many EU citizens. They’re about to implement a new system to 
improve data access for physicians. Which of the following 
regulatory requirements should they pay particular attention to 
when granting physicians access to EU patient data? 
(A)       Ensure data is only accessed for tax reporting purposes 
(B)       Acquire explicit consent from patients before sharing 
data 
(C)       Encrypt all data using a proprietary algorithm 
(D)       Store data in a physical server located within the EU 
Explanation 507. Correct Answer: B. Acquire explicit 
consent from patients before sharing data. Under the GDPR, 
explicit consent from individuals is required before processing 
or sharing their personal data. This means that EU citizens 
should have given their clear permission for their data to be 
accessed and shared. 
Option A is incorrect. Accessing data for tax reporting 
purposes is not directly related to the GDPR’s requirement for 
handling EU citizens’ personal healthcare data. 
Option C is incorrect. While encryption is a good practice for 
data protection, GDPR does not mandate using a proprietary 
algorithm. Moreover, encryption alone doesn’t address the 
consent requirement. 
Option D is incorrect. While the GDPR does have provisions 
about data transfer outside the EU, simply storing data in a 
physical server within the EU does not bypass the need for 
explicit patient consent when sharing their data.

Question 508. WebFlix, a popular online movie streaming 
service, experienced a data center outage due to a natural 
disaster. They had backups in place and restored their systems 
using data from 6 hours prior to the outage. This resulted in the 
loss of some user interactions, like ratings and watchlists from 
the last 6 hours. What term describes the 6-hour gap between 
the last backup and the time of the outage? 
(A)       Recovery Time Objective (RTO) 
(B)       Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) 
(C)       Recovery Duration Period (RDP) 
(D)       Recovery Point Objective (RPO) 
Explanation 508. Correct Answer: D. Recovery Point 
Objective (RPO). The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the 
maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. For 
WebFlix, this means they could afford to lose up to 6 hours of 
data (user interactions in this case) in the event of a disaster. 
Option A is incorrect. Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the 
maximum acceptable amount of time that a system can be down 
after a disruption. 
Option B is incorrect. Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) 
represents the total amount of time a system can afford to be 
non-operational without incurring significant risks or significant 
losses. 
Option C is incorrect. Recovery Duration Period (RDP) is not 
a standard term in business continuity and disaster recovery 
planning.

Question 509. As a security consultant, you are hired by a 
multinational corporation to assess the security posture of their 
potential vendors. One of the vendors appears promising, but 
your client wants to ensure that the vendor periodically 
examines and strengthens its own internal procedures and 
security controls. What should you advise your client to request 
from this vendor? 
(A)       The vendor's business continuity plan 
(B)       A list of the vendor's clients 
(C)       Evidence of internal audits 
(D)       The vendor's company mission statement 
Explanation 509. Correct Answer: C. Evidence of internal 
audits. Requesting evidence of internal audits would allow the 
client to review the vendor’s commitment to maintaining and 
improving its internal procedures and security controls. 
Option A is incorrect. While a business continuity plan is 
essential, it primarily outlines how disruptions will be managed 
and does not necessarily provide evidence of the vendor’s 
internal control practices. 
Option B is incorrect. Knowing the vendor’s clients can 
provide some context, but it does not directly provide evidence 
of the vendor’s internal control practices or security measures. 
Option D is incorrect. The company’s mission statement 
provides an overview of the company’s goals and values but 
doesn’t provide specific evidence of its internal control 
practices.

Question 510. GlobalFin, a fintech company, has developed a 
new mobile banking application. To avoid any legal 
complications, which of the following legal external 
considerations should GlobalFin pay the most attention to 
before launching the application worldwide? 
(A)       Ensuring the app meets global data privacy laws 
(B)       Confirming the color scheme aligns with branding 
regulations in all countries 
(C)       Securing copyrights for all images used in the app 
(D)       Making sure the app's name isn't offensive in any 
language 
Explanation 510. Correct Answer: A. Ensuring the app 
meets global data privacy laws. For a mobile banking 
application, ensuring compliance with global data privacy laws 
is paramount. Different regions have varying requirements and 
regulations about how user data should be handled, stored, and 
processed. 
Option B is incorrect. While branding and color schemes are 
important for marketing, they are not typically subjects of strict 
legal regulation like data privacy laws. 
Option C is incorrect. While securing copyrights is important, 
the primary legal concern for a banking application would be 
related to data privacy and security, given the sensitive nature of 
financial data. 
Option D is incorrect. Although it’s good practice to ensure an 
app’s name is culturally sensitive, the primary legal concern for 
a banking app would be data privacy and security regulations.

Question 511. MedTech, a medical device manufacturer, did 
not adhere to the required standards for device security and 
patient data protection. Which of the following repercussions 
might be the MOST critical for MedTech’s ongoing operations? 
(A)       Increased public relations campaigns 
(B)       Short-term stock price fluctuations 
(C)       Offering discounts on their devices 
(D)       Loss of license to manufacture and distribute 
Explanation 511. Correct Answer: D. Loss of license to 
manufacture and distribute. For a medical device 
manufacturer, maintaining adherence to industry-specific 
standards is crucial. Non-compliance, especially when it 
involves patient data protection, can lead to the company losing 
its license to operate. 
Option A is incorrect. While public relations campaigns might 
be employed to manage reputation, it’s not a direct consequence 
of non-compliance. 
Option B is incorrect. Stock price fluctuations could occur due 
to many factors, but it’s not the most critical consequence 
concerning the company’s ability to operate. 
Option C is incorrect. Offering discounts might be a strategy 
to regain customer trust, but it’s not a direct result of non-
compliance nor is it as critical as the potential loss of a license. 
Question 512. Your organization has been repeatedly ignoring 
the security guidelines set forth by a global standards 
organization, despite having pledged adherence. Given the 
	
 
740

repetitive nature of these violations, the organization is now 
facing disciplinary measures. Which of the following is the 
MOST likely immediate consequence of these actions? 
(A)       Immediate revocation of business licenses 
(B)       Sanctions imposed by the global standards 
organization 
(C)       Forcible shutdown of all online operations for a 
determined period 
(D)      Mandatory public apology to stakeholders 
Explanation 512. Correct Answer: B. Sanctions imposed by 
the global standards organization. Sanctions are penalties or 
other means of enforcement used to provide incentives for 
obedience with the law, or with rules and regulations. In this 
scenario, the global standards organization can impose sanctions 
for the failure to adhere to their guidelines. 
Option A is incorrect. Revocation of business licenses is 
typically a drastic measure and might be taken by a local or 
national regulatory body, not a standards organization. 
Option C is incorrect. While some sanctions might involve 
restrictions, forcibly shutting down all online operations would 
be an extreme and less likely measure for non-compliance with 
guidelines from a standards organization. 
Option D is incorrect. A public apology, while potentially 
useful for public relations, is not a direct consequence or 
sanction imposed by most standards organizations. 
	
 
741

Question 513. HealthCareNow, a large hospital chain, wants to 
ensure its newly implemented electronic health record (EHR) 
system adheres to national standards. Which type of audit would 
be most appropriate to confirm that HealthCareNow is in 
compliance with national regulations regarding patient data? 
(A)       Self-assessment using internal standards 
(B)       Third-party risk assessment 
(C)       External regulatory audit 
(D)       Informal peer review 
Explanation 513. Correct Answer: C. External regulatory 
audit. External regulatory audits are conducted by external 
entities to ensure that organizations are complying with industry 
or national regulations. For HealthCareNow, an external 
regulatory audit will confirm that its EHR system complies with 
national standards related to patient data. 
Option A is incorrect. While self-assessments are beneficial for 
internal reviews, they might not carry the same weight or depth 
of scrutiny that external regulatory audits possess. 
Option B is incorrect. Third-party risk assessments focus on 
evaluating the security risks associated with external partners 
and vendors, not on confirming compliance with national 
regulations. 
Option D is incorrect. An informal peer review might offer 
insights and suggestions but lacks the formal structure and 
regulatory emphasis of an external audit. 
	
 
742

Question 514. In preparation for an upcoming audit, AlphaTech 
Corporation hires a team to evaluate their security measures. 
The team is spotted attempting to bypass security barriers, 
unlock doors without keys, and trying to access restricted floors 
by pretending to be maintenance staff. What type of testing is 
AlphaTech Corporation undergoing? 
(A)       Network vulnerability scanning 
(B)       Physical penetration testing 
(C)       OS fingerprinting 
(D)       Source code review 
Explanation 514. Correct Answer: B. Physical penetration 
testing. Physical penetration testing involves hands-on 
techniques to breach physical barriers, such as locks, security 
checkpoints, or restricted areas, to assess the efficacy of 
physical security controls. 
Option A is incorrect. Network vulnerability scanning is about 
identifying vulnerabilities in networked systems through 
automated tools, not physical barriers. 
Option C is incorrect. OS fingerprinting identifies the 
operating system of a remote computer. It doesn’t involve 
physically trying to access restricted areas. 
Option D is incorrect. Source code review evaluates the source 
code of applications for vulnerabilities and doesn’t concern 
physical access controls. 
Question 515. Emily, a cybersecurity analyst, has been tasked 
with gathering preliminary information about a target 
	
 
743

organization without directly interacting with its systems. She 
decides to collect data from third-party sources, search engines, 
public records, and other online platforms without sending any 
packets to the target. Which phase of penetration testing is 
Emily currently engaged in? 
(A)       Active reconnaissance 
(B)       Passive reconnaissance 
(C)       Vulnerability scanning 
(D)       Threat hunting  
Explanation 515. Correct Answer: B. Passive 
reconnaissance. Passive reconnaissance is the initial phase in 
which the penetration tester collects information about the target 
without directly engaging with or alerting the target. Emily’s 
approach of gathering data from third-party sources without 
sending packets or interacting directly with the target’s systems 
is in line with the characteristics of passive reconnaissance. 
Option A is incorrect. Active reconnaissance involves directly 
interacting with the target systems, often sending packets or 
probes, which can potentially be detected by the target. 
Option C is incorrect. Vulnerability scanning is a step further 
where specific tools are used to identify vulnerabilities in a 
system. It is more direct than passive reconnaissance. 
Option D is incorrect. Threat hunting is a proactive approach 
to finding malicious activities within a system rather than 
gathering information about a target system. 
	
 
744

Question 516. As part of an initial penetration testing phase, 
Jackson is using tools that directly probe and interact with the 
target system’s network to discover open ports, services, and 
other potential access points. While this approach is more direct 
and could be detected by the target’s security systems, it 
provides detailed and actionable insights. Which type of 
reconnaissance is Jackson performing? 
(A)       Threat analysis 
(B)       Passive reconnaissance 
(C)       Active reconnaissance 
(D)       Social engineering 
Explanation 516. Correct Answer: C. Active reconnaissance. 
Active reconnaissance involves directly interacting with the 
target systems to gain more detailed and actionable information. 
In this phase, tools and techniques that can be detected by the 
target’s security measures, such as port scanning, are often used. 
Jackson’s approach matches the characteristics of active 
reconnaissance. 
Option A is incorrect. Threat analysis is the process of 
identifying, assessing, and prioritizing threats against a system 
or organization. 
Option B is incorrect. Passive reconnaissance is about 
collecting data without direct interaction with the target 
systems, typically using third-party sources, public records, and 
other non-intrusive methods. 
Option D is incorrect. Social engineering involves 
manipulating individuals to reveal confidential information or 
	
 
745

perform certain actions, and it is not directly related to network 
probing or service discovery. 
Question 517. TechFirm, a leading technology conglomerate, 
recently conducted a security exercise. The goal was for the 
internal security team to defend against a series of simulated 
attacks from an external red team. While the red team launched 
attacks, the internal team’s objective was to detect, respond, and 
mitigate those threats. What type of penetration testing is 
TechFirm employing for its internal security team? 
(A)       Offensive penetration testing 
(B)       Passive penetration testing 
(C)       Defensive penetration testing 
(D)       Black box testing 
Explanation 517. Correct Answer: C. Defensive penetration 
testing. Defensive penetration testing is designed to test the 
organization’s capability to defend its systems and networks 
against attacks. It typically involves an internal security team 
(often called the blue team) that defends against simulated 
attacks. 
Option A is incorrect. Offensive penetration testing involves 
actively trying to exploit vulnerabilities, not defending against 
them. 
Option B is incorrect. Passive penetration testing refers to 
gathering information without actively interacting with the 
target systems. It’s not focused on defending against active 
threats. 
	
 
746

Option D is incorrect. Black box testing is a method where the 
tester has no knowledge of the internal workings of the system 
they are testing. It doesn’t describe a defensive posture. 
Question 518. Emily, an executive assistant, receives a phone 
call from an individual claiming to be a new employee in the IT 
department. The caller says they’re conducting a routine check 
and needs Emily to confirm her username and password for 
system verification. How should Emily respond? 
(A)       Politely decline and report the call to the IT 
department 
(B)       Provide the caller with the username but not the 
password 
(C)       Ask the caller to email the request, so there's a written 
record 
(D)       Hang up without saying anything 
Explanation 518. Correct Answer: A. Politely decline and 
report the call to the IT department. This is a classic example 
of a vishing (voice phishing) attempt, a form of social 
engineering. The best practice in such scenarios is to never 
provide sensitive information over the phone, especially when 
the call is unsolicited. Reporting the attempt to the IT 
department can help the company be aware and potentially 
prevent further attempts. 
Option B is incorrect. Even if Emily provides only her 
username, it could still be used maliciously in combination with 
other attacks. 
	
 
747

Option C is incorrect. Written records can be helpful, but it’s 
crucial not to entertain or validate unsolicited requests, whether 
via email or phone. 
Option D is incorrect. While hanging up stops the immediate 
threat, it’s essential to report such incidents for broader 
organizational awareness and protection. 
Question 519. XYZ Corp, a manufacturer of smart home 
devices, failed to implement standard security practices in their 
products. A popular tech review site publishes an in-depth 
review detailing these vulnerabilities. Which of the following 
outcomes is XYZ Corp MOST likely to face as an immediate 
result? 
(A)       An award for innovation in smart home technologies 
(B)       Reputational damage leading to decreased sales 
(C)       An increased partnership with tech retailers 
(D)       A surge in the employee recruitment rate  
Explanation 519. Correct Answer: B. Reputational damage 
leading to decreased sales. Negative reviews, especially those 
highlighting security vulnerabilities, can lead to a loss of trust 
among consumers, potentially resulting in decreased sales due 
to reputational damage. 
Option A is incorrect. Receiving an award for innovation is 
unlikely in the face of publicized security vulnerabilities. 
Option C is incorrect. Partnerships with tech retailers might be 
jeopardized, or at least put on hold, given the negative publicity 
around the product’s security flaws. 
	
 
748

Option D is incorrect. A negative review, especially one that 
underscores security vulnerabilities, is unlikely to boost 
recruitment. Potential employees may be wary of joining a 
company with a tarnished reputation. 
Question 520. SoftTech Inc., a software company, is 
considering expanding its operations to Europe. They will be 
collecting and processing personal data of EU citizens. Which 
of the following legal implications is MOST critical for 
SoftTech Inc. to consider? 
(A)       The need to register with each country's software 
association 
(B)       Compliance with the General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) 
(C)       Ensuring software patent rights in each European 
country 
(D)       The European standard for software coding 
Explanation 520. Correct Answer: B. Compliance with the 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). When dealing 
with personal data of EU citizens, companies must comply with 
the GDPR, which outlines strict requirements on data protection 
and privacy. Non-compliance can lead to hefty fines and legal 
repercussions. 
Option A is incorrect. Registering with each country’s software 
association is not related to the privacy and legal implications of 
processing personal data. 
	
 
749

Option C is incorrect. While software patent rights are 
essential, they don’t directly address the privacy concerns of 
processing personal data of EU citizens. 
Option D is incorrect. There is no “European standard for 
software coding” that relates to the privacy of personal data. 
The critical concern is data protection and privacy regulations 
like the GDPR. 
Question 521. DataGuard Corp. operates in the European 
Union and has recently suffered a major data breach affecting 
the personal data of thousands of users. They failed to comply 
with some key provisions of the General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR). Which of the following is the MOST likely 
immediate consequence of their non-compliance? 
(A)       They will be forced to shut down operations until 
compliance is achieved 
(B)       DataGuard's executive team will face immediate 
imprisonment 
(C)       The company will be required to issue a public apology 
(D)       DataGuard Corp. will face substantial fines for their 
non-compliance 
Explanation 521. Correct Answer: D. DataGuard Corp. will 
face substantial fines for their non-compliance. The GDPR 
provisions can levy hefty fines on organizations that do not 
comply with its requirements, especially in the case of data 
breaches. The fines can be up to 4% of the annual global 
turnover or €20 million, whichever is higher. 
	
 
750

Option A is incorrect. While the GDPR can impose operational 
restrictions, it does not directly mandate shutdowns of 
companies due to non-compliance. 
Option B is incorrect. GDPR does not call for the 
imprisonment of executive teams. However, non-compliance 
can lead to severe fines. 
Option C is incorrect. While issuing a public apology might be 
a good PR move, it is not a direct consequence enforced by 
GDPR. 
Question 522. SafeNet, a financial institution, decided to 
undertake a comprehensive security assessment. They brought 
together their internal security team and an external group of 
ethical hackers. Their objective was for these teams to 
collaboratively assess vulnerabilities, perform real-time attack 
simulations, and evaluate defense mechanisms. What form of 
penetration testing is SafeNet utilizing? 
(A)       Black box testing 
(B)       Integrated penetration testing 
(C)       Defensive penetration testing 
(D)       Red team assessment 
Explanation 522. Correct Answer: B. Integrated penetration 
testing. Integrated penetration testing, often associated with 
purple teaming, involves the combined efforts of both offensive 
and defensive teams to provide a holistic assessment of an 
organization’s security posture. 
	
 
751

Option A is incorrect. Black box testing is a method where the 
tester doesn’t have prior knowledge of the system’s architecture 
or underlying code. It doesn’t emphasize the collaborative 
nature between offensive and defensive teams. 
Option C is incorrect. Defensive penetration testing focuses on 
evaluating the defensive capabilities of an organization against 
potential attacks, without necessarily implying collaboration 
with an offensive team. 
Option D is incorrect. Red team assessment involves 
simulating real-world cyber-attacks to test an organization’s 
security posture, but it doesn’t inherently suggest a joint effort 
with a defensive team. 
Question 523. AlphaTech, a leading tech manufacturer, is 
considering a penetration test to identify vulnerabilities in their 
new product’s firmware. They provide the testers with firmware 
source code, architecture diagrams, and other internal details to 
ensure a thorough evaluation. What kind of penetration test is 
AlphaTech commissioning? 
(A)       Zero-knowledge testing 
(B)       Open box testing 
(C)       Opaque testing 
(D)       Blind testing 
Explanation 523. Correct Answer: B. Open box testing. 
Open box testing, similar to white box testing, is where the 
tester is given complete transparency and full details about the 
system internals, making it easier to identify vulnerabilities that 
might be missed in other forms of testing. 
	
 
752

Option A is incorrect. Zero-knowledge testing is another term 
for black box testing, where testers have no knowledge of the 
system internals. 
Option C is incorrect. Opaque testing is not a recognized term 
in penetration testing methodologies and is intended as a 
distractor. 
Option D is incorrect. Blind testing is a scenario where the 
testers have limited knowledge about the target system. 
Question 524. John, a citizen of a country that strictly follows 
the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), used a global 
online shopping platform for a year. He decided to stop using 
the platform and requested the deletion of all his personal data. 
What is the online platform’s primary obligation concerning 
John’s request under the “Right to be Forgotten” principle? 
(A)       Retain the data but ensure that John's data is never used 
for marketing purposes 
(B)       Delete all personal data about John unless there's a 
legal reason to keep it 
(C)       Anonymize John's data and notify him of the 
completion 
(D)       Move John's data to a secure, encrypted server where it 
won't be accessed 
Explanation 524. Correct Answer: B. Delete all personal 
data about John unless there’s a legal reason to keep it. The 
“Right to be Forgotten” under GDPR allows citizens to ask 
organizations to delete their personal data unless the 
	
 
753

organization has a legitimate reason (e.g., legal obligations) to 
retain the data. 
Option A is incorrect. Merely refraining from using John’s data 
for marketing does not satisfy the “Right to be Forgotten.” 
Option C is incorrect. Anonymization does not equate to the 
removal of data, and GDPR’s “Right to be Forgotten” 
specifically refers to the deletion of data. 
Option D is incorrect. Simply moving the data to a secure 
server doesn’t align with the principles of the “Right to be 
Forgotten.” The data needs to be deleted unless there’s a valid 
reason to retain it. 
Question 525. WebMasters LLC, a popular web hosting 
company, wants to ensure the robust security of their hosted 
websites. They initiate a security challenge, inviting ethical 
hackers worldwide to find vulnerabilities without giving any 
details about their servers, databases, or applications. Which 
penetration testing method is WebMasters LLC utilizing? 
(A)       External testing 
(B)       Grey box testing 
(C)       Active testing 
(D)       Black box testing 
Explanation 525. Correct Answer: D. Black box testing. In 
black box testing, the testers are not provided with any 
knowledge about the system’s internals and have to identify 
vulnerabilities based purely on their own discoveries. 
	
 
754

WebMasters LLC’s approach, where they don’t disclose any 
specifics to the ethical hackers, resonates with this method. 
Option A is incorrect. While the challenge by WebMasters 
LLC can be externally focused, external testing alone doesn’t 
define the level of knowledge provided to the testers. 
Option B is incorrect. In grey box testing, testers would have 
some knowledge about the target, which is not the case here. 
Option C is incorrect. Active testing simply means testers are 
directly interacting with the system, but it doesn’t specify the 
amount of knowledge they have about its internals. 
Question 526. After a series of high-profile data breaches in the 
industry, OnlineRetail Corp., an e-commerce platform, wishes 
to undergo an external review to validate the security of its 
operations and provide a comprehensive report to its 
shareholders. Which type of assessment will provide a detailed 
and formalized examination of their security posture? 
(A)       External examination of IT controls and operations 
(B)       Internal review of security protocols 
(C)       External regulatory audit on financial statements 
(D)       Informal feedback from industry peers 
Explanation 526. Correct Answer: A. External examination 
of IT controls and operations. An external examination of IT 
controls and operations provides a deep and structured 
assessment of an organization’s security posture and IT 
operations. Conducted by external experts, it can provide 
	
 
755

formalized, comprehensive findings to reassure shareholders of 
the company’s security measures. 
Option B is incorrect. An internal review is conducted by the 
organization’s own personnel and may lack the independent 
perspective and comprehensive scope of an external 
examination. 
Option C is incorrect. An external regulatory audit on financial 
statements focuses on financial reporting and not on the security 
of IT operations. 
Option D is incorrect. Informal feedback, while potentially 
useful, does not offer the structured, comprehensive, and 
independent insights that an external examination provides. 
Question 527. WebFirm, a web development company, did not 
comply with the data handling and protection clauses outlined 
in their contract with RetailMax, an e-commerce company. As a 
result, RetailMax’s customer data was exposed in a data breach. 
Which of the following is the MOST probable contractual 
impact on WebFirm due to this incident? 
(A)       WebFirm will receive bonuses for early project 
completion 
(B)       WebFirm will be required to provide additional services 
at no cost 
(C)       RetailMax will terminate the contract and may seek 
damages 
(D)       RetailMax will extend the project timeline 
	
 
756

Explanation 527.  Correct Answer: C. RetailMax will 
terminate the contract and may seek damages. A data breach, 
especially one that results from non-compliance with 
contractual clauses related to data protection, can lead to the 
termination of the contract. Additionally, the affected party, in 
this case, RetailMax, might also seek damages from WebFirm 
for the breach. 
Option A is incorrect. Bonuses for early project completion are 
unrelated to non-compliance with data protection clauses. 
Option B is incorrect. While some contracts might stipulate 
penalties such as providing additional services for breaches, in a 
significant incident like a data breach, termination is more 
probable. 
Option D is incorrect. Extending the project timeline is not a 
typical response to a breach of data protection clauses in a 
contract. 
Question 528. SafeNet Banking Corporation is keen on gaining 
a competitive edge in the market by demonstrating its 
commitment to cybersecurity. They want an official attestation 
that their cybersecurity measures are robust and compliant with 
industry standards. What should SafeNet opt for to obtain this 
attestation? 
(A)       Feedback from customers on the bank's app security 
(B)       Internal IT team's report on cybersecurity practices 
(C)       External independent third-party audit 
(D)       Informal evaluation by a cybersecurity consultancy 
	
 
757

Explanation 528. Correct Answer: C. External independent 
third-party audit. An external independent third-party audit 
can provide an official attestation regarding SafeNet Banking 
Corporation’s adherence to industry standards in cybersecurity. 
By having an external entity evaluate their practices, SafeNet 
can assure stakeholders of its commitment to cybersecurity. 
Option A is incorrect. While feedback from customers is 
valuable, it is not an official or comprehensive assessment of 
the bank’s entire cybersecurity practices. 
Option B is incorrect. An internal IT team’s report might lack 
the external perspective and official attestation that a third-party 
audit can provide. 
Option D is incorrect. An informal evaluation, even by a 
cybersecurity consultancy, might not be as rigorous or 
recognized as an official third-party audit. 
Question 529. XYZ Corp., a multinational company, recently 
underwent a security audit. The Chief Information Security 
Officer (CISO) needs to report the findings of the audit to the 
company’s internal stakeholders as well as to a governmental 
regulatory agency. Which of the following represents the correct 
type of compliance reporting for each recipient? 
(A)       Internal report for the regulatory agency and external 
report for internal stakeholders 
(B)       External report for both the regulatory agency and 
internal stakeholders 
(C)       Internal report for internal stakeholders and 
external report for the regulatory agency 
	
 
758

(D)       No report is required for internal stakeholders, only an 
external report for the regulatory agency 
Explanation 529. Correct Answer: C. Internal report for 
internal stakeholders and external report for the regulatory 
agency. Internal compliance reports are typically designed for 
consumption within the organization and may contain details 
that are not shared externally. External compliance reports, on 
the other hand, are designed for entities outside of the 
organization, such as regulators or other third parties, and would 
contain information that is relevant and necessary for those 
entities to review. 
Option A is incorrect. It is not standard to provide an internal 
report for an external entity or an external report for internal 
stakeholders. 
Option B is incorrect. While it’s conceivable to use the same 
report for both internal and external entities, it’s more common 
to tailor reports to the specific audience. An internal report may 
contain more detailed or sensitive information not suitable for 
an external audience. 
Option D is incorrect. It is crucial for internal stakeholders to 
be aware of the audit findings to make informed decisions and 
plan remediation actions. 
Question 530. SoftTech Solutions is a software development 
company that has decided to conduct a penetration test on their 
new web application. The testers are provided with user 
credentials, network topology diagrams, and some proprietary 
	
 
759

software code snippets. Which type of penetration testing is 
SoftTech Solutions employing? 
(A)       Black box testing 
(B)       Double-blind testing 
(C)       Known environment testing 
(D)       Zero-knowledge testing 
Explanation 530. Correct Answer: C. Known environment 
testing. Known environment testing is a type of penetration 
testing where the testers are given certain information about the 
target’s environment. This can include user credentials, network 
diagrams, and more, to mimic a potential insider threat or a 
threat actor who has gained certain internal information. 
Option A is incorrect. In black box testing, testers are given no 
prior knowledge about the system. 
Option B is incorrect. In double-blind testing, neither the 
attackers nor the defenders have prior knowledge of the 
impending test. 
Option D is incorrect. Zero-knowledge testing is another term 
for black box testing, where the testers have no knowledge of 
the system internals. 
Question 531. A medium-sized organization recently had a 
third-party auditor review their information security controls. 
After the review, the auditor provided a formal statement that 
verified the effectiveness of the controls in place. What is this 
formal statement referred to as? 
(A)       Certification 
	
 
760

(B)       Accreditation 
(C)       Attestation 
(D)       Assurance 
Explanation 531. Correct Answer: C. Attestation. An 
attestation is a formal statement or declaration by a subject 
matter expert, like an auditor, attesting that specific criteria are 
met. In this case, the auditor is attesting to the effectiveness of 
the information security controls. 
Option A is incorrect. Certification is the process of providing 
someone or something with an official document attesting to a 
status or level of achievement, which may or may not involve 
testing against certain standards. 
Option B is incorrect. Accreditation is the formal recognition 
that a body or individual is competent to perform specific tasks, 
usually granted by a higher authority or body. 
Option D is incorrect. Assurance refers to the measures taken 
to gain confidence in the security of a system, but it’s not a 
formal declaration like an attestation. 
Question 532. CyberLock Inc. is assessing the security postures 
of its third-party vendors to determine potential risks. The 
cybersecurity team wants to gather foundational security 
information from each vendor to evaluate their security maturity 
and practices. What would be the most cost-effective and 
efficient way to collect this data from a large number of 
vendors? 
(A)       Conduct a penetration test for each vendor 
	
 
761

(B)       Send out security questionnaires to each vendor 
(C)       Visit each vendor's site for an in-person assessment 
(D)       Review the annual financial reports of each vendor  
Explanation 532. Correct Answer: B. Send out security 
questionnaires to each vendor. Security questionnaires are 
commonly used to gather foundational security information 
from third-party vendors. They are cost-effective and can 
efficiently collect standardized data from a large number of 
vendors to evaluate their security posture and practices. 
Option A is incorrect. Conducting a penetration test for each 
vendor would be resource-intensive, costly, and may not 
provide the foundational information about the vendor’s 
security practices. 
Option C is incorrect. Visiting each vendor’s site for an in-
person assessment would be time-consuming, costly, and 
logistically challenging, especially when dealing with a large 
number of vendors. 
Option D is incorrect. Annual financial reports provide 
financial data and do not offer in-depth details on a vendor’s 
security posture or practices. 
Question 533. TechGuard Inc. and CloudSecure are two 
cybersecurity firms that are considering a collaboration on a 
new cloud security project. Both companies have proprietary 
technologies and methodologies they will bring into the 
partnership. Before embarking on the collaborative venture, 
which agreement should they finalize to define the terms of 
	
 
762

their partnership, roles, and shared responsibilities? 
(A)       Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) 
(B)       Service-level agreement (SLA) 
(C)       Business partners agreement (BPA) 
(D)       Memorandum of understanding (MOU)  
Explanation 533. Correct Answer: C. Business partners 
agreement (BPA). A Business partners agreement (BPA) 
outlines the specifics of the partnership between entities, 
detailing roles, responsibilities, financial arrangements, and 
other key terms of the relationship. Given that TechGuard Inc. 
and CloudSecure are forming a partnership with shared roles 
and responsibilities, a BPA is the most fitting. 
Option A is incorrect. An NDA focuses specifically on the 
confidentiality of shared information and not on the broader 
terms of a partnership. 
Option B is incorrect. A service-level agreement (SLA) centers 
on the standards and quality of service to be provided, detailing 
performance metrics, and does not focus on partnership 
specifics. 
Option D is incorrect. An MOU signifies mutual intentions 
and understanding between parties but may not provide detailed 
terms and conditions of a business partnership like a BPA does. 
Question 534. XYZ Ltd. wants to evaluate if their current 
security measures are consistent with industry-specific 
regulations they are required to follow. The evaluation should 
be done by their own IT department before inviting external 
	
 
763

auditors. Which approach should XYZ Ltd. adopt? 
(A)       Third-party vulnerability scanning 
(B)       Internal compliance assessment 
(C)       External attestation 
(D)       Vendor risk assessment 
Explanation 534. Correct Answer: B. Internal compliance 
assessment. An internal compliance assessment is conducted by 
an organization’s internal teams to evaluate if their operations, 
processes, and configurations are in alignment with required 
compliance standards or regulations. This helps in proactively 
identifying and rectifying non-compliance before an external 
audit. 
Option A is incorrect. Third-party vulnerability scanning 
focuses on identifying vulnerabilities and doesn’t necessarily 
check for compliance with industry-specific regulations. 
Option C is incorrect. External attestation is a formal 
statement from an external party verifying specific criteria. This 
would not be done by the company’s internal IT department. 
Option D is incorrect. Vendor risk assessment focuses on 
assessing the security risks associated with third-party vendors 
and doesn’t evaluate an organization’s internal compliance with 
regulations. 
Question 535. A cybersecurity firm has been hired by 
TechGiant Corp. to perform penetration testing on their 
infrastructure. Before the testing begins, the CEO of TechGiant 
Corp. wants to ensure that certain critical systems are not 
	
 
764

targeted, and that the testing will not disrupt their ongoing 
operations. What should be established to define the scope and 
boundaries of the test? 
(A)       Service-level agreement (SLA) 
(B)       Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) 
(C)       Rules of engagement (ROE) 
(D)       Memorandum of understanding (MOU) 
Explanation 535. Correct Answer: C. Rules of engagement 
(ROE). The Rules of Engagement (ROE) document defines the 
scope, boundaries, methods, and other critical guidelines for a 
penetration test. It ensures that both the testing team and the 
organization understand and agree on what can and cannot be 
done during the testing. 
Option A is incorrect. A Service-level agreement (SLA) 
primarily deals with the levels of service expected, such as 
uptime, response times, etc. It doesn’t define the boundaries of a 
penetration test. 
Option B is incorrect. A Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) is 
about keeping information confidential and wouldn’t define the 
scope of a penetration test. 
Option D is incorrect. A Memorandum of understanding 
(MOU) is a general agreement between parties, but it doesn’t 
detail the specific scope and rules of a penetration test like the 
ROE would. 
Question 536. As part of the annual security training, the IT 
department of XYZ Corp decides to launch a simulated 
	
 
765

phishing campaign. The aim is to assess employees’ ability to 
identify and report phishing emails. Which of the following 
would be the MOST effective first step in ensuring the success 
of this campaign? 
(A)       Informing all employees about the campaign a week 
prior 
(B)       Creating a realistic phishing email that closely 
resembles common threats 
(C)       Offering rewards to employees who click on the 
simulated phishing links 
(D)       Reviewing the results of the previous year’s campaign 
Explanation 536. Correct Answer: B. Creating a realistic 
phishing email that closely resembles common threats. For 
the phishing campaign to effectively assess employees’ ability 
to recognize phishing threats, the simulated phishing email must 
be as realistic as possible. By making it closely resemble 
common threats, the IT department can gain a more accurate 
measure of the employees’ awareness and response. 
Option A is incorrect. Informing all employees about the 
campaign beforehand would defeat the purpose of the test, as 
they would be expecting a phishing email and thus be more 
likely to recognize and report it. 
Option C is incorrect. Offering rewards to employees who 
click on the simulated phishing links would encourage risky 
behavior and is counterproductive to the goal of increasing 
security awareness. 
	
 
766

Option D is incorrect. While reviewing results from previous 
campaigns can provide insights, it would not be the most 
effective first step in ensuring the success of the current 
campaign. 
Question 537. A healthcare provider wants to evaluate the 
security of their patient portal. They inform the penetration 
testers about the technologies used, such as the programming 
languages and databases. However, specifics about the security 
measures in place, including intrusion detection systems, are 
kept secret. What kind of penetration test are they aiming for? 
(A)       White box testing 
(B)       External testing 
(C)       Grey box testing 
(D)       Active testing  
Explanation 537. Correct Answer: C. Grey box testing. Grey 
box testing implies that testers have some knowledge about the 
target but not all details. Here, the healthcare provider gives 
details about the technologies used but keeps information about 
the security measures a secret. This partial disclosure aligns 
with grey box testing methodology. 
Option A is incorrect. In white box testing, testers would have 
a complete overview of the system, including its code, 
configurations, and security measures. 
Option B is incorrect. External testing primarily focuses on the 
system’s exterior defenses, like firewall configurations, without 
consideration of what details are shared with the testers. 
	
 
767

Option D is incorrect. Active testing means testers are directly 
interacting with the system and is not indicative of the level of 
knowledge they possess about the system’s internals. 
Question 538. TechFirm Inc. collects personal data from its 
users and decides on the purposes and means of processing this 
data. They also outsource data storage to CloudData, a third-
party company. In the context of data privacy regulations, how 
would TechFirm and CloudData be classified respectively? 
(A)       TechFirm: Processor; CloudData: Controller 
(B)       TechFirm: Controller; CloudData: Processor 
(C)       Both TechFirm and CloudData: Processors 
(D)       Both TechFirm and CloudData: Controllers 
Explanation 538. Correct Answer: B. TechFirm: Controller; 
CloudData: Processor. TechFirm Inc., which decides on the 
purposes and means of processing personal data, is the 
“Controller”. CloudData, which is responsible for processing 
data on behalf of TechFirm (without deciding on its use), is the 
“Processor”. 
Option A is incorrect. The roles are reversed in this option. 
TechFirm is the one making decisions on data use, so it’s the 
Controller. 
Option C is incorrect. Both entities have different roles in this 
scenario. TechFirm is not just processing; it’s deciding on how 
the data should be used, making it a Controller. 
	
 
768

Option D is incorrect. CloudData does not decide on the 
purpose and means of the data processing. It simply processes 
data on behalf of TechFirm, making it a Processor. 
Question 539. Sarah, a sales manager at TechWorld Inc., 
receives an email from her bank urging her to update her 
account details due to a recent security breach. The email 
provides a link to a website that looks almost identical to her 
bank’s official site. However, she notices a slight misspelling in 
the URL. What should Sarah do next? 
(A)       Forward the email to her colleagues as a warning 
(B)       Click the link and update her details as the bank's site is 
probably just undergoing updates 
(C)       Delete the email without taking any action 
(D)       Report the email to her company's IT department 
and avoid clicking any links  
Explanation 539. Correct Answer: D. Report the email to 
her company’s IT department and avoid clicking any links. 
Sarah likely received a phishing email, a common tactic used by 
attackers to deceive users into providing sensitive information. 
The best course of action is to report the suspicious email to the 
IT department so they can take necessary precautions and notify 
other employees. 
Option A is incorrect. While Sarah has the right instinct to 
warn others, forwarding potentially malicious emails can lead to 
more risks. It’s better to alert the IT department. 
	
 
769

Option B is incorrect. Clicking on links in suspicious emails, 
especially with a misspelled URL, can lead to compromised 
personal and company data. 
Option C is incorrect. Simply deleting the email doesn’t 
address the broader risk to the organization. Reporting such 
incidents helps the company bolster its defenses. 
Question 540. WebSoft Inc., a leading software company, 
recently launched a new web application. Before making it live, 
they engaged a security firm to challenge the application, find 
vulnerabilities, and exploit them as real hackers would. This 
aggressive testing is done to ensure maximum security. What 
kind of penetration testing is WebSoft Inc. opting for? 
(A)       White box testing 
(B)       Defensive penetration testing 
(C)       Offensive penetration testing 
(D)       Gray box testing 
Explanation 540. Correct Answer: C. Offensive penetration 
testing. Offensive penetration testing is an aggressive form of 
testing where the tester actively attempts to find and exploit 
vulnerabilities in the target system or application, much like a 
real attacker. 
Option A is incorrect. White box testing, also known as clear 
box testing, involves having full visibility and knowledge of the 
internal workings of the application being tested. The focus is 
more on the methodology and not the aggressive nature of the 
testing. 
	
 
770

Option B is incorrect. There is no specific testing method 
called “defensive penetration testing.” Defensive strategies are 
typically associated with blue team activities that focus on 
defending systems, not aggressively testing them. 
Option D is incorrect. Gray box testing is a combination of 
both white box and black box testing methods. Testers have 
some knowledge of the internal workings but not complete 
information. The emphasis here is on the level of knowledge of 
the system and not on the aggressive nature of the testing.

specific, pre-defined servers 
(C)       Installing physical locks on IoT devices to prevent theft 
(D)       Allowing IoT devices to connect to any available 
network for data redundancy 
Explanation 1. Correct Answer: B. Limiting the IoT devices 
to communicate only with specific, pre-defined servers. By 
restricting IoT devices to communicate only with specific, 
trusted servers, unauthorized access and data tampering risks 
can be minimized. This measure ensures that data is only sent to 
and received from legitimate sources. 
Option A is incorrect. While data transfer speeds are important 
for performance and real-time analytics, from a security 
standpoint, the integrity and confidentiality of the data is more 
crucial. 
Option C is incorrect. While physical security is an essential 
aspect, especially in a public setting, the most significant risks 
with IoT often pertain to data security and unauthorized access. 
Option D is incorrect. Allowing IoT devices to connect to any 
available network can introduce significant security 
	
 
809

vulnerabilities, such as man-in-the-middle attacks, 
eavesdropping, or unauthorized data tampering. 
Question 2. TechFirm Inc. has decided to engage in a new 
business venture. Before they move forward, the security team 
conducts several brainstorming sessions, interviews, and 
reviews historical data to generate a list of potential security 
threats that the new venture could face. This activity is a 
primary component of which step in the risk management 
process? 
 (A)      Risk assessment 
 (B)      Risk response 
 (C)      Risk monitoring 
 (D)      Risk identification 
Explanation 2. Correct Answer: D. Risk identification. Risk 
identification is the initial process of detecting and describing 
risks that could potentially affect the achievement of objectives. 
Option A is incorrect. Risk assessment encompasses the 
overall process of identifying, analyzing, and evaluating risks, 
but the specific activity mentioned is related to risk 
identification. 
Option B is incorrect. Risk response involves deciding on the 
most suitable approach to address identified risks, whether it’s 
accepting, avoiding, transferring, or mitigating them. 
Option C is incorrect. Risk monitoring is about tracking 
identified risks, monitoring residual risks, and identifying new 
	
 
810

risks. The specific activity of brainstorming and gathering data 
about risks falls under risk identification. 
Question 3. A large financial organization wants to ensure that 
all employees understand the importance of cybersecurity and 
the role they play in safeguarding company assets. Which of the 
following managerial security controls will be MOST effective 
in achieving this? 
 (A)      Installing a firewall at the network perimeter 
 (B)      Regular security awareness training for employees 
 (C)      Deploying an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
 (D       Encrypting all company data 
Explanation 3. Correct Answer: B. Regular security 
awareness training for employees. Security awareness training 
is a managerial control aiming to educate employees about 
security risks and the necessary precautions they need to take. 
By regularly training employees, the organization ensures that 
all staff are aware of potential threats and their roles in 
cybersecurity. 
Option A is incorrect. Installing a firewall is a technical control 
focused on preventing unauthorized access to or from a private 
network. While it protects the network, it doesn’t directly 
educate employees about their roles in cybersecurity. 
Option C is incorrect. Deploying an Intrusion Detection 
System (IDS) is a technical control. It monitors network traffic 
for suspicious activities but does not directly focus on educating 
employees. 
	
 
811

Option D is incorrect. Encrypting company data is a technical 
control. While it ensures the confidentiality of data, it doesn’t 
address the employees’ knowledge or awareness regarding 
cybersecurity. 
Question 4. A major pharmaceutical company recently 
announced an increase in drug prices. Following the 
announcement, their website was taken offline by a DDoS 
attack, with a message posted online by a group claiming 
responsibility and demanding affordable healthcare for all. 
Which type of threat actor is MOST likely behind this attack? 
 (A)   	
Unskilled attacker 
 (B)   	
Insider threat 
 (C)   	
Hacktivist 
 (D)   	
Nation-state 
Explanation 4. Correct Answer: C. Hacktivist. Hacktivists 
are typically driven by political, social, or ideological motives. 
They use cyber attacks as a means to promote or protest certain 
issues. In this scenario, the attack on the pharmaceutical 
company is a form of protest against their pricing policies, 
making it characteristic of hacktivist behavior. 
Option A is incorrect. Unskilled attackers generally conduct 
attacks for personal bragging rights or mischief. They are not 
usually driven by ideological motives like demanding 
affordable healthcare. 
Option B is incorrect. Insider threats stem from individuals 
within the organization, often driven by personal grievances or 
	
 
812

financial gain. The described scenario shows a motive tied to a 
broader social issue, not a personal or internal motive. 
Option D is incorrect. Nation-states conduct cyber operations 
for political, espionage, or military reasons. Protesting drug 
prices is not in line with their typical objectives. 
Question 5. After deploying wireless access points in a large 
manufacturing facility, employees report inconsistent wireless 
connectivity in some areas. What tool would be most effective 
for the IT team to use to visualize areas of weak wireless signal 
strength? 
(A)       Network bandwidth monitor 
(B)       Protocol analyzer 
(C)       Heat map software 
(D)       Intrusion detection system 
Explanation 5. Correct Answer: C. Heat map software. Heat 
map software allows IT professionals to visually see areas of 
strong and weak wireless signal strength, making it easier to 
adjust placements or add additional access points as needed. 
Option A is incorrect. A network bandwidth monitor is used to 
measure the amount of data being sent over a network, not to 
visualize wireless signal strength. 
Option B is incorrect. A protocol analyzer is used to capture 
and analyze network traffic, not to visually display wireless 
coverage. 
	
 
813

Option D is incorrect. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is 
designed to detect unauthorized access or malicious activities 
on a network. It does not show areas of weak wireless signal 
strength. 
Question 6. In an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) model, 
which of the following tasks is typically the responsibility of the 
cloud customer in a standard Cloud Responsibility Matrix? 
 (A)   	
Physical security of data centers 
 (B)   	
Patching of host operating systems 
 (C)   	
Network infrastructure maintenance 
 (D)   	
Patching of guest operating systems 
Explanation 6. Correct Answer: D. Patching of guest 
operating systems. In an IaaS model, the customer is typically 
responsible for managing their own virtual machines, which 
includes patching the guest operating systems. The cloud 
provider is generally responsible for the physical infrastructure, 
network, and the host operating system. 
Option A is incorrect. Physical security of data centers is the 
responsibility of the cloud provider. The customer does not have 
control over the physical infrastructure in a cloud environment. 
Option B is incorrect. Patching of host operating systems is the 
cloud provider’s responsibility. They manage the underlying 
infrastructure, including the host systems. 
Option C is incorrect. Maintenance of network infrastructure 
is typically handled by the cloud provider, ensuring connectivity 
and uptime for the resources they offer. 
	
 
814

Question 7. A company’s website was temporarily defaced with 
a humorous meme, but no sensitive data was stolen or any 
significant damage done. The attacker left a message bragging 
about their first successful hack. Which type of threat actor is 
MOST likely responsible for this attack? 
 (A)   	
Insider threat 
 (B)   	
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) 
 (C)   	
Unskilled attacker 
 (D)   	
Nation-state 
Explanation 7. Correct Answer: C. Unskilled attacker. 
Unskilled attackers, often referred to as “script kiddies”, 
typically utilize pre-made tools or scripts to carry out basic 
attacks. Their motivations are often more about bragging rights 
or minor mischief, such as defacing a website for fun or to 
prove they can, rather than executing a sophisticated or 
damaging attack. 
Option A is incorrect. Insider threats are individuals within an 
organization that may have specific motives related to personal 
grievances or financial gain. Their attacks would typically be 
more targeted and potentially more harmful than just defacing a 
website. 
Option B is incorrect. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are 
highly skilled and typically represent organized groups with 
specific, long-term objectives. Their attacks are sophisticated 
and stealthy, aiming for data theft or system compromise over 
an extended period. 
	
 
815

Option D is incorrect. Nation-states are motivated by political, 
military, or espionage objectives. A simple website defacement, 
especially one with a humorous meme, does not align with their 
typical motivations or methods. 
Question 8. A financial institution recently discovered that a 
large number of confidential customer records were being 
accessed and copied during off-business hours. Upon 
investigation, it was found that the access came from an 
authenticated user within the company, who had recently been 
passed over for a promotion. Which type of threat actor is 
MOST likely responsible for this security incident? 
(A)       Hacktivist 
(B)       Insider threat 
(C)       Nation-state 
(D)       Organized crime syndicate 
Explanation 8. Correct Answer: B. Insider threat. The 
evidence suggests the activities were conducted by an 
authenticated user within the organization, who might have a 
motive (having been passed over for a promotion). Insider 
threats are risks from individuals within the organization such 
as employees, contractors, or business associates, who have 
inside information concerning the organization’s security 
practices, data, and computer systems. 
Option A is incorrect. Hacktivists are typically motivated by 
political or social causes and will target organizations to 
promote or protest a specific issue. They are not usually 
motivated by personal grievances like being passed over for 
promotions. 
	
 
816

Option C is incorrect. Nation-states are driven by political, 
espionage, or military objectives. Accessing customer records of 
a financial institution for personal reasons doesn’t align with 
their typical motivations. 
Option D is incorrect. While organized crime syndicates might 
have an interest in customer records for financial gains, the 
inside access and the motive related to a missed promotion 
strongly suggest an insider threat. 
Question 9. A company is evaluating its data storage options. 
They need a solution that provides them with the highest level 
of control over their hardware, software, and network 
configurations, allowing for customized security controls and 
measures. Which deployment model would best suit their 
needs? 
 (A)   	
Cloud-based Infrastructure 
 (B)   	
Hybrid Infrastructure 
 (C)   	
On-premises Infrastructure 
 (D)   	
Community Cloud 
Explanation 9. Correct Answer: C. On-premises 
Infrastructure. On-premises infrastructure allows 
organizations to have complete control over their hardware, 
software, and network configurations. This gives them the 
freedom to customize security controls and measures tailored to 
their specific needs. 
Option A is incorrect. Cloud-based infrastructures are hosted 
by third-party providers, which means organizations might not 
	
 
817

have the same level of control or customization over their 
resources. 
Option B is incorrect. Hybrid infrastructure combines on-
premises and cloud resources. While it offers more control than 
purely cloud-based solutions, it still doesn’t provide the total 
control that on-premises infrastructure does. 
Option D is incorrect. A community cloud is shared by several 
organizations with similar requirements. While it offers some 
level of control, it doesn’t provide the complete customization 
and control that an on-premises infrastructure does. 
Question 10. A new technology firm recently launched a device 
that uses facial recognition for authentication. A cybersecurity 
researcher, without any malicious intent, demonstrated a 
method to bypass the facial recognition using a photograph. The 
researcher then approached the firm with the findings without 
publicizing it. What is the primary motivation behind the 
researcher’s action? 
(A)       Philosophical beliefs opposing facial recognition 
(B)       Financial gain by blackmailing the firm 
(C)       Ethical considerations for consumer security 
(D)       Aiming to damage the firm's market reputation 
Explanation 10. Correct Answer: C. Ethical considerations 
for consumer security. By responsibly disclosing the 
vulnerability to the firm without any malicious intent or 
publicizing it, the researcher showcased ethical motivations, 
aiming to improve consumer security. 
	
 
818

Option A is incorrect. The researcher did not express 
opposition to facial recognition technology but only highlighted 
a potential vulnerability. 
Option B is incorrect. There is no evidence that the researcher 
tried to blackmail the firm. Instead, they responsibly disclosed 
the vulnerability. 
Option D is incorrect. The researcher chose not to publicize 
the vulnerability, indicating they were not aiming to damage the 
firm’s reputation but to assist in improving security. 
Question 11. ABC Corp recently adopted a Bring Your Own 
Device (BYOD) policy. The IT department is concerned about 
the potential risks associated with personal devices accessing 
the corporate network. Which of the following solutions would 
be MOST effective for enforcing security policies on these 
personal mobile devices? 
(A)       Installing antivirus software on each device 
(B)       Establishing a separate guest Wi-Fi network for mobile 
devices 
(C)       Using Mobile Device Management (MDM) to enforce 
security policies 
(D)       Mandating that employees use strong passwords on 
their personal devices 
Explanation 11. Correct Answer: C. Using Mobile Device 
Management (MDM) to enforce security policies. MDM 
solutions provide centralized control to enforce security 
policies, manage device features, and ensure that personal 
	
 
819

devices meet the organization’s security standards before 
accessing corporate resources. 
Option A is incorrect. While installing antivirus software is a 
good security measure, it doesn’t provide the comprehensive 
policy enforcement capabilities that MDM does. 
Option B is incorrect. A separate guest Wi-Fi may restrict 
access to the internal network, but it doesn’t manage or enforce 
security policies on the devices themselves. 
Option D is incorrect. While using strong passwords is 
essential, it’s just one aspect of device security. MDM offers 
broader policy enforcement capabilities. 
Question 12. AcmeTech, a software development firm, recently 
experienced a major data breach that was traced back to a 
vulnerability in their custom-built application. Post-incident 
analysis revealed that the vulnerability had been introduced 
during the coding phase and was never detected during testing. 
To avoid such vulnerabilities in the future, which policy should 
AcmeTech emphasize to ensure secure practices are maintained 
throughout the development process? 
(A)       Incident Response Policy 
(B)       Change Management Policy 
(C)       Business Continuity Policy 
(D)       Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Policy 
Explanation 12. Correct Answer: D. Software Development 
Lifecycle (SDLC) Policy. The Software Development Lifecycle 
(SDLC) Policy provides guidelines and standards for each 
	
 
820

phase of the software development process, ensuring that 
security is integrated at every step, from requirement gathering 
to deployment and maintenance. 
Option A is incorrect. While an Incident Response Policy 
provides a structured approach to manage and respond to 
security incidents, it does not focus on the software 
development process. 
Option B is incorrect. The Change Management Policy deals 
with procedures for implementing changes in the IT 
environment but doesn’t specifically cater to the development of 
software applications. 
Option C is incorrect. A Business Continuity Policy focuses 
on maintaining business operations during and after a disruption 
and doesn’t address the specifics of software development. 
Question 13. A high-profile executive received an email 
containing personal photos and a message threatening to release 
the images to the public unless a significant sum of money was 
transferred to a specific cryptocurrency address. What 
motivation is most evident behind this threat? 
 (A)   	
Espionage to gather competitive intelligence 
 (B)   	
Service disruption to harm the reputation of the 
executive's company 
 (C)   	
Blackmail to extract money by leveraging sensitive 
information 
 (D)   	
Data exfiltration for selling on the dark web  
	
 
821

Explanation 13. Correct Answer: C. Blackmail to extract 
money by leveraging sensitive information. The direct threat 
of releasing personal photos in exchange for money is a classic 
indication of blackmail. The attacker is leveraging sensitive 
information (personal photos) to extort money. 
Option A is incorrect. There’s no mention of seeking company 
secrets or competitive intelligence. The focus of the attacker is 
on personal images of the executive. 
Option B is incorrect. While releasing the images might harm 
the executive’s reputation, there’s no direct intent shown to 
disrupt the company’s services or harm its operational standing. 
Option D is incorrect. The attacker is directly demanding 
money in exchange for not releasing the photos. This differs 
from data exfiltration where data might be sold or leveraged in 
other ways. 
Question 14. A software development team in a large 
corporation decided to use an unauthorized cloud-based tool to 
host and manage their source code. The team believed it would 
increase their productivity, even though it was not approved by 
the IT department. A few weeks later, unauthorized access to 
their project data was detected. Which threat actor concept 
BEST describes the situation? 
(A)       Insider threat 
(B)       Hacktivist 
(C)       Shadow IT 
(D)       Organized crime syndicate  
	
 
822

Explanation 14. Correct Answer: C. Shadow IT. Shadow IT 
refers to any IT systems or solutions used within an 
organization without organizational approval or oversight. This 
can introduce vulnerabilities, as the unauthorized systems might 
not meet the security standards set by the organization’s IT 
department. In this scenario, the software development team’s 
unauthorized use of a cloud tool exemplifies Shadow IT. 
Option A is incorrect. While the software development team 
acted without approval, their intention was to increase 
productivity, not to harm the organization. Therefore, this 
situation does not fit the typical definition of an “insider threat,” 
which usually has malicious intent. 
Option B is incorrect. Hacktivists are motivated by political or 
social causes. There’s no evidence in the scenario to suggest 
that political or social motivations were behind the team’s 
decision. 
Option D is incorrect. While the data was accessed without 
authorization, there’s no evidence to suggest that this was the 
work of an organized crime syndicate. The main issue at hand is 
the unauthorized use of IT resources, which is a hallmark of 
Shadow IT. 
Question 15. A financial institution has experienced an uptick 
in unauthorized transactions. They want to implement a control 
that will allow them to identify suspicious transactions in real-
time. Which of the following would be the BEST detective 
control for this scenario? 
 (A)   	
Implementing a multi-factor authentication system for 
	
 
823

all users 
 (B)   	
Establishing a Security Operations Center (SOC) to 
monitor network traffic 
 (C)   	
Installing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) on 
their network 
 (D)   	
Restricting transaction capabilities to only a few 
trusted IP addresses.  
Explanation 15. Correct Answer: C. Installing an Intrusion 
Detection System (IDS) on their network. An Intrusion 
Detection System (IDS) serves as a detective control by 
monitoring network traffic for suspicious activities and potential 
threats. In this context, it can be configured to detect patterns 
related to unauthorized transactions, thereby allowing timely 
intervention. 
Option A is incorrect. Implementing a multi-factor 
authentication system is a preventive control that provides an 
additional layer of security by requiring two or more 
verification methods. While it reduces the risk of unauthorized 
access, it does not detect suspicious transactions. 
Option B is incorrect. Establishing a Security Operations 
Center (SOC) is a broad approach to handle security events, and 
while it can include detective controls, merely setting up a SOC 
does not provide specific real-time detection of unauthorized 
transactions. 
Option D is incorrect. Restricting transaction capabilities to 
only a few trusted IP addresses is a preventive control that 
limits the sources of potential transactions. While it can reduce 
	
 
824

the number of unauthorized transactions, it does not detect 
them. 
Question 16. MegaTech Inc. is in the process of outlining a 
strategy to ensure that after any disaster, critical applications 
can be restored to a working state within 4 hours. The 
organization also wants to make sure that the data loss does not 
exceed 1 hour. Which of the following policies is most relevant 
to achieving this objective? 
 (A)   	
Data Retention Policy 
 (B)   	
Incident Response Policy 
 (C)   	
Disaster Recovery Policy 
 (D)   	
Password Policy 
Explanation 16. Correct Answer: C. Disaster Recovery 
Policy. A Disaster Recovery Policy details the strategy and 
procedures for recovering IT systems, applications, and data 
after a catastrophic event. Defining Recovery Time Objectives 
(RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) like in this 
scenario are essential components of this policy. 
Option A is incorrect. Data Retention Policy is about how long 
data should be stored and when it should be discarded, not how 
to recover it post-disaster. 
Option B is incorrect. An Incident Response Policy is centered 
around how to handle and respond to security incidents. While 
related, it does not provide the specifics on recovery objectives 
and timelines. 
	
 
825

Option D is incorrect. Password Policy sets the standards for 
password creation and management. It doesn’t have any direct 
relevance to disaster recovery processes. 
Question 17. A large financial institution is planning to upgrade 
its IT infrastructure to allow for a more efficient use of 
hardware resources, faster deployment of applications, and 
reduced server provisioning times. While evaluating different 
technologies, which of the following would directly address 
these needs? 
 (A)   	
Network Segmentation 
 (B)   	
Intrusion Detection System 
 (C)   	
Virtualization 
 (D)   	
Multi-Factor Authentication 
Explanation 17. Correct Answer: C. Virtualization. 
Virtualization allows multiple virtual machines to run on a 
single physical host, maximizing the use of hardware resources. 
It enables rapid provisioning and deployment of new servers 
and applications, addressing the requirements of the financial 
institution. 
Option A is incorrect. Network segmentation divides a 
network into smaller subnetworks, primarily for security and 
performance reasons. While it’s a best practice, it doesn’t 
address the efficient use of hardware or rapid deployment of 
applications. 
Option B is incorrect. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
monitors and detects malicious activities in a network. While 
	
 
826

crucial for security, it doesn’t cater to hardware resource 
efficiency or faster server provisioning. 
Option D is incorrect. Multi-Factor Authentication is a security 
process in which a user provides multiple methods of 
identification to authenticate their identity. It doesn’t impact 
hardware resource efficiency or application deployment times. 
Question 18. Bob receives an email prompting him to verify his 
identity by clicking on a link. The link directs him to a webpage 
where he has to provide his username, password, and answer a 
personal security question. What type of authentication method 
is being employed here? 
 (A)   	
Biometric authentication 
 (B)   	
Token-based authentication 
 (C)   	
Two-factor authentication 
 (D)   	
Single sign-on 
Explanation 18. Correct Answer: C. Two-factor 
authentication. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security 
process in which users provide two different authentication 
factors to verify their identity. In this scenario, Bob is providing 
something he knows (username and password) and also 
answering a personal security question, which is another form 
of “something he knows.” 
Option A is incorrect. Biometric authentication involves using 
unique physical or behavioral attributes of a person for 
verification, such as fingerprints or facial patterns. The scenario 
doesn’t mention any biometric data. 
	
 
827

Option B is incorrect. Token-based authentication typically 
involves using a hardware or software token that generates a 
time-sensitive code. This was not described in the scenario. 
Option D is incorrect. Single sign-on (SSO) allows a user to 
log in once and gain access to multiple systems without being 
prompted to log in again for each system. The scenario 
describes a two-factor authentication process, not SSO. 
Question 19. An online banking website employs a system that 
automatically logs out users after 10 minutes of inactivity to 
ensure that if a user forgets to log out, no one else can alter the 
user’s banking details. Which principle of the CIA triad is the 
banking website MOST directly addressing? 
 (A)   	
Confidentiality 
 (B)   	
Availability 
 (C)   	
Authentication 
 (D)   	
Integrity 
Explanation 19. Correct Answer: D. Integrity.  The integrity 
pillar of the CIA triad ensures the accuracy and reliability of 
data. By logging out users after a period of inactivity, the 
banking website aims to prevent unauthorized modifications 
(potentially by someone else who might gain access to the 
unattended session) to the user’s banking details, thereby 
maintaining the integrity of the data. 
Option A is incorrect. While logging out users does have a 
confidentiality aspect, the primary aim in this scenario is to 
prevent unauthorized changes rather than unauthorized viewing. 
	
 
828

Option B is incorrect. Availability ensures that data and 
systems are accessible to authorized users when they need it. 
This scenario doesn’t discuss providing or restricting access 
based on system uptime or accessibility. 
Option C is incorrect. Authentication ensures that users are 
who they claim to be. While the scenario does touch on security 
measures, the primary concern here is preventing unauthorized 
changes to data, which aligns with integrity, not authentication. 
Question 20. A software development company is looking to 
migrate its legacy applications to a more modern infrastructure. 
They want to ensure the applications can be deployed 
consistently across multiple environments without the 
challenges of varying dependencies and configurations. Which 
approach would best achieve this goal? 
 (A)   	
Virtual Machine Deployment 
 (B)   	
Bare-Metal Deployment 
 (C)   	
Containerization 
 (D)   	
Serverless Computing 
Explanation 20. Correct Answer: C. Containerization 
Containerization encapsulates an application and its 
dependencies into a ‘container.’ This allows the application to 
be consistently deployed across different environments 
regardless of variations in configurations or dependencies. 
Option A is incorrect. While virtual machines provide an 
isolated environment for applications, they include the overhead 
of an entire guest OS and don’t directly address the challenge of 
application dependencies varying across environments. 
	
 
829

Option B is incorrect. Bare-metal deployment involves 
installing applications directly on hardware without 
virtualization or containers. This method does not inherently 
ensure consistent deployment across multiple environments. 
Option D is incorrect. Serverless computing abstracts the 
infrastructure away from the developer, focusing on individual 
functions. While it provides scalability and simplicity, it doesn’t 
directly address consistent deployment across environments due 
to dependencies and configurations. 
Question 21. Your organization is implementing Infrastructure 
as Code (IaC) to deploy and manage its cloud infrastructure. As 
part of a security review, what is a primary concern regarding 
the use of IaC scripts? 
 (A)   	
Lack of graphical interface for infrastructure 
visualization 
 (B)   	
Hardcoding sensitive data within the scripts 
 (C)   	
Inability to scale the infrastructure dynamically 
 (D)   	
Incompatibility with non-cloud environments 
Explanation 21. Correct Answer: B. Hardcoding sensitive 
data within the scripts. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts are 
meant to automate infrastructure deployment. If sensitive data 
such as passwords or API keys are hardcoded into these scripts, 
they could be exposed, leading to potential security breaches. 
It’s essential to use secure methods, like secrets management or 
encrypted variables, to handle sensitive data. 
	
 
830

Option A is incorrect. While IaC focuses on code-driven 
infrastructure management, many tools provide ways to 
visualize the infrastructure or are compatible with tools that do. 
Option C is incorrect. One of the benefits of IaC is the ability 
to scale infrastructure dynamically. It allows for automated 
scaling based on the script or configuration files. 
Option D is incorrect. IaC can be used in various 
environments, not just cloud. It depends on the tool and the 
platform it supports. 
Question 22. A pharmaceutical company is concerned about 
competitors accessing their formula for a new drug. Which 
pillar of the CIA triad is MOST directly addressed by their 
concern? 
 (A)   	
Availability 
 (B)   	
Confidentiality 
 (C)   	
Integrity 
 (D)   	
Non-repudiation 
Explanation 22. Correct Answer: B. Confidentiality. The 
confidentiality pillar of the CIA triad ensures that information is 
accessible only to those with authorized access. In this scenario, 
the company wants to ensure that its drug formula remains 
secret and is not accessible to unauthorized individuals, 
particularly competitors. 
Option A is incorrect. Availability ensures that information is 
accessible to authorized users when needed. The concern here is 
	
 
831

not about access to the data but rather about preventing 
unauthorized access. 
Option C is incorrect. Integrity ensures the accuracy and 
reliability of data and systems. The scenario doesn’t mention 
concerns about the formula being altered, only about 
unauthorized access. 
Option D is incorrect. Non-repudiation is a concept ensuring 
that a party in a dispute cannot deny the authenticity of their 
actions. It’s not directly related to the company’s concern about 
the secrecy of their drug formula. 
Question 23. An online gaming platform experiences latency 
issues during multiplayer sessions, affecting the gameplay 
experience of its users. The company wants to ensure real-time 
responsiveness for its players worldwide. Which of the 
following solutions would BEST mitigate these latency issues? 
 (A)   	
Implementing a Content Delivery Network (CDN) 
 (B)   	
Introducing stricter user authentication methods 
 (C)   	
Deploying a centralized database server 
 (D)   	
Reducing the game's graphical fidelity 
Explanation 23. Correct Answer: A. Implementing a 
Content Delivery Network (CDN). A CDN involves 
distributing the hosting of content to multiple locations around 
the world. For online gaming, this means players can connect to 
a server closer to their geographic location, thereby reducing 
latency and improving responsiveness. 
	
 
832

Option B is incorrect. While strong authentication methods are 
crucial for security, they don’t address latency or improve the 
real-time responsiveness of the gaming platform. 
Option C is incorrect. Centralizing the database server might 
actually increase latency for users who are far from the central 
location. 
Option D is incorrect. Reducing graphical fidelity can improve 
game performance on the client side, but it doesn’t address 
network latency or the real-time responsiveness of multiplayer 
sessions. 
Question 24. A startup company anticipates rapid growth in its 
user base over the next year. They are considering an 
architectural model for their application that can handle the 
projected growth without performance issues. Which of the 
following would be the BEST design consideration for this 
situation? 
 (A)   	
Implementing strict password policies 
 (B)   	
Using a monolithic application design 
 (C)   	
Integrating a DDoS protection mechanism 
 (D)   	
Adopting a microservices architecture 
Explanation 24. Correct Answer: D. Adopting a 
microservices architecture. Microservices architecture breaks 
down an application into small, independent services that run as 
separate processes. This allows for better scalability as each 
service can be scaled individually based on the demand. 
	
 
833

Option A is incorrect. While strict password policies are good 
for security, they don’t directly address the scalability concerns 
of the application architecture. 
Option B is incorrect. Monolithic designs are often harder to 
scale as changes or scaling in one area can affect the entire 
application. 
Option C is incorrect. While DDoS protection is essential for 
defending against certain types of cyberattacks, it doesn’t 
address the scalability of the application’s core architecture. 
Question 25. MedGuard, a health tech company, has developed 
an AI-driven software that predicts potential health risks based 
on patient data. Before launching in the U.S. market, which of 
the following industry external considerations should be the 
company’s primary focus? 
 (A)   	
Integrating with popular fitness tracking apps in the 
U.S. 
 (B)   	
Ensuring compliance with the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 
 (C)   	
Surveying U.S. doctors about software interface 
preferences 
 (D)   	
Collaborating with U.S. pharmaceutical companies 
for promotional deals  
Explanation 25. Correct Answer: B. Ensuring compliance 
with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act (HIPAA). HIPAA is a U.S. law designed to provide privacy 
standards to protect patients’ medical records and other health 
information. For MedGuard, which deals with patient data, 
	
 
834

ensuring HIPAA compliance is paramount before launching 
their software in the U.S. market. 
Option A is incorrect. While integration with fitness tracking 
apps may enhance the software’s functionality, the primary 
concern when dealing with patient data in the U.S. is 
compliance with HIPAA. 
Option C is incorrect. Although feedback from doctors might 
help improve the software’s user interface, the primary industry 
external consideration should be regulatory compliance, 
especially when handling sensitive health information. 
Option D is incorrect. While partnerships with pharmaceutical 
companies might be beneficial for marketing or business 
growth, the primary industry consideration for a health tech 
company dealing with patient data is ensuring compliance with 
relevant regulations. 
Question 26. An e-commerce company has experienced a 
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, which caused its 
website to become inaccessible for several hours. To mitigate 
the impact of such attacks in the future, which of the following 
would be the BEST corrective control to implement? 
 (A)   	
Displaying a seal for third-party security certifications 
on the website 
 (B)   	
Establishing a Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
with DDoS protection 
 (C)   	
Conducting routine vulnerability assessments on the 
website 
	
 
835

 (D)   	
Implementing strong password policies for website 
administrators 
Explanation 26. Correct Answer: B. Establishing a Web 
Application Firewall (WAF) with DDoS protection. A Web 
Application Firewall (WAF) with DDoS protection can identify 
and filter out malicious traffic associated with DDoS attacks. As 
a corrective control, it can help in mitigating the impact and 
restoring normal service during and after an attack. 
Option A is incorrect. Displaying a seal for third-party security 
certifications on the website acts as a deterrent by showing 
visitors and potential attackers that the site adheres to security 
standards. However, it does not mitigate or correct the effects of 
a DDoS attack. 
Option C is incorrect. Conducting routine vulnerability 
assessments is a detective control that helps in identifying 
weaknesses. While it’s essential for overall security, it doesn’t 
directly correct or mitigate the effects of a DDoS attack. 
Option D is incorrect. Implementing strong password policies 
for website administrators is a preventive control. It ensures that 
administrators’ accounts are secure, but it does not address or 
correct the issues caused by a DDoS attack. 
Question 27. A healthcare organization uses embedded systems 
in various medical devices. They are aware of the potential 
threats these systems can pose if not properly secured. Which of 
the following is NOT a recommended practice when hardening 
embedded systems in this context? 
	
 
836

 (A)   	
Regularly patching and updating the firmware of the 
devices 
 (B)   	
Allowing unrestricted access to the devices for ease 
of use by the medical staff 
 (C)   	
Disabling unnecessary services and features not 
required for the device's primary function 
 (D)   	
Changing default credentials and using strong, unique 
passwords for device access 
Explanation 27. Correct Answer: B. Allowing unrestricted 
access to the devices for ease of use by the medical staff. 
Unrestricted access can lead to unintentional or deliberate 
misconfigurations or misuse of the device, compromising its 
security. 
Option A is incorrect. Regularly patching and updating 
firmware is a critical aspect of maintaining the security of 
embedded systems, especially with the evolving nature of 
threats. 
Option C is incorrect. Disabling unnecessary services and 
features reduces the attack surface and is a fundamental 
principle of system hardening. 
Option D is incorrect. Changing default credentials and 
ensuring strong, unique passwords are in place is essential to 
prevent unauthorized access. 
Question 28. A financial institution wants to ensure that 
customers are aware of the bank’s policies on information 
sharing and how their personal data is used. Which of the 
	
 
837

following security controls would BEST communicate this to 
customers? 
 (A)   	
Implementing end-to-end encryption for online 
transactions 
 (B)   	
Publishing a privacy policy on the bank's website 
 (C)   	
Conducting annual cybersecurity awareness training 
for employees 
 (D)   	
Using multi-factor authentication for online banking 
Explanation 28. Correct Answer: B. Publishing a privacy 
policy on the bank’s website. A privacy policy serves as a 
directive control as it informs customers about the bank’s 
practices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of their 
personal data. By reading the policy, customers understand their 
rights and the bank’s responsibilities. 
Option A is incorrect. While end-to-end encryption ensures the 
confidentiality of online transactions, it doesn’t inform 
customers about the bank’s policies on information sharing or 
how their data is used. 
Option C is incorrect. Annual cybersecurity awareness training 
is aimed at employees, not customers. It wouldn’t directly 
communicate the bank’s information-sharing policies to its 
customers. 
Option D is incorrect. Using multi-factor authentication 
improves the security of online banking by requiring multiple 
forms of verification. However, it doesn’t communicate to 
customers how their personal data is used or the bank’s 
information-sharing policies. 
	
 
838

Question 29. A company detected a DDoS attack that lasted for 
several weeks. The attackers used a botnet of millions of 
infected devices and frequently rotated attack vectors to bypass 
mitigation efforts. This prolonged and resource-intensive attack 
suggests which kind of threat actor’s resources and funding? 
 (A)   	
Amateur hacker with minimal resources 
 (B)   	
Cybersecurity researcher testing vulnerabilities 
 (C)   	
Nation-state actor with strategic interests 
 (D)   	
Organized crime syndicate with substantial 
funding 
Explanation 29. Correct Answer: D. Organized crime 
syndicate with substantial funding. The scale and duration of 
the DDoS attack, combined with the use of a massive botnet 
and frequent rotation of attack vectors, point to a threat actor 
with significant resources. While nation-states could conduct 
such attacks, DDoS campaigns are also a hallmark of well-
funded organized crime syndicates, especially when financial or 
strategic extortion could be a motive. 
Option A is incorrect. An amateur hacker with minimal 
resources would not have the capability to sustain a large-scale 
DDoS attack using a botnet of millions of devices over several 
weeks. 
Option B is incorrect. Cybersecurity researchers typically do 
not engage in malicious activities, and launching a prolonged 
DDoS attack would be unethical and illegal. 
Option C is incorrect. While a nation-state actor might have 
the resources to launch such an attack, DDoS attacks, especially 
	
 
839

those of extortion nature, are more commonly associated with 
organized crime syndicates. 
Question 30. AlphaCorp is migrating to cloud infrastructure 
and wants to ensure all virtual machines (VMs) are securely 
configured from the onset. Before deploying multiple VM 
instances, what should AlphaCorp do to ensure each VM starts 
from a secure configuration? 
 (A)   	
Use the default VM templates provided by the cloud 
provider 
 (B)   	
Establish a secure baseline for VM configurations 
and use it for deployment 
 (C)   	
Regularly backup all VMs 
 (D)   	
Use multi-factor authentication for cloud access 
Explanation 30. Correct Answer: B. Establish a secure 
baseline for VM configurations and use it for deployment. 
Establishing a secure baseline for VM configurations ensures 
that each VM is deployed with a set of standard security 
settings, reducing vulnerabilities from default configurations or 
potential misconfigurations. 
Option A is incorrect. Relying solely on default VM templates 
provided by cloud providers may not meet the specific security 
requirements of an organization. Customizing and creating a 
secure baseline is more effective. 
Option C is incorrect. While regular backups are essential for 
data recovery, they do not directly ensure that VMs start from a 
secure configuration. 
	
 
840

Option D is incorrect. Multi-factor authentication is a crucial 
security measure for accessing cloud resources, but it doesn’t 
ensure that VMs are deployed with secure configurations. 
Question 31. SecureNet Ltd. wants to protect user accounts 
from brute force attacks. They want to implement a measure 
where, after a certain number of failed login attempts, the 
account would become temporarily inaccessible. Which 
standard best suits this requirement? 
 (A)   	
Password minimum length 
 (B)   	
Account lockout threshold 
 (C)   	
Mandatory password resets 
 (D)   	
Two-factor authentication 
Explanation 31. Correct Answer: B. Account lockout 
threshold. The account lockout threshold defines the number of 
consecutive failed login attempts after which a user account is 
locked out, preventing further attempts for a specified duration. 
This measure directly deters brute force attacks by making 
rapid, repeated login attempts unfeasible. 
Option A is incorrect. Password minimum length dictates how 
long a password must be, which can deter certain brute force 
attempts but doesn’t address the rapid, repeated attempts 
characteristic of such attacks. 
Option C is incorrect. Mandatory password resets force users 
to change their passwords at regular intervals. While this might 
protect against the use of older stolen credentials, it doesn’t 
prevent brute force attacks. 
	
 
841

Option D is incorrect. Two-factor authentication requires two 
forms of identification to access an account. Although it 
significantly enhances security, it doesn’t limit login attempts 
based on failed attempts. 
Question 32. An energy company is looking to enhance the 
security of its ICS/SCADA systems. They have realized that 
default configurations might have vulnerabilities. Which of the 
following is the BEST initial step to take in securing their ICS/
SCADA systems? 
 (A)   	
Connect the ICS/SCADA systems to the internet for 
remote monitoring 
 (B)   	
Use commercial off-the-shelf software to add a layer 
of security 
 (C)   	
Implement a secure baseline configuration tailored 
to the ICS/SCADA environment 
 (D)   	
Increase the number of users with administrative 
privileges to ensure rapid response to issues 
Explanation 32. Correct Answer: C. Implement a secure 
baseline configuration tailored to the ICS/SCADA 
environment. Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and 
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems 
are critical in managing industrial processes. Implementing a 
secure baseline configuration tailored to these systems ensures 
that unnecessary services and potential vulnerabilities are 
minimized. 
Option A is incorrect. Connecting ICS/SCADA systems 
directly to the internet exposes them to a wide range of threats 
and potential cyber-attacks. 
	
 
842

Option B is incorrect. While commercial off-the-shelf software 
can be beneficial, it’s not the best initial step. Secure baselines 
tailored to the ICS/SCADA environment are more effective. 
Option D is incorrect. Increasing the number of users with 
administrative privileges contradicts the principle of least 
privilege and can introduce more security vulnerabilities. 
Question 33. The IT department wants to monitor network 
traffic in real time to detect any anomalies or malicious 
activities. Which of the following security controls can 
accomplish this? 
 (A)   	
Security policy documentation 
 (B)   	
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
 (C)   	
Employee code of conduct 
 (D)   	
Access Control Lists (ACL) 
Explanation 33.  Correct Answer: B. Intrusion Detection 
System (IDS). An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a 
technical control that monitors network traffic in real-time and 
alerts administrators to any suspicious or malicious activities 
based on predefined rules or heuristics. 
Option A is incorrect. Security policy documentation is an 
administrative control. It provides guidelines and procedures for 
maintaining security but does not actively monitor network 
traffic. 
Option C is incorrect. Employee code of conduct is an 
administrative control. It provides guidelines on how employees 
	
 
843

should behave in a professional setting but does not actively 
monitor network traffic. 
Option D is incorrect. Access Control Lists (ACL) are 
technical controls, but they are used to define permissions on 
who can access specific resources. They do not actively monitor 
network traffic in real-time for anomalies or malicious 
activities. 
Question 34. A company is located in an area prone to natural 
disasters such as earthquakes and floods. Which of the 
following physical security controls would be MOST effective 
in ensuring the safety of the company’s IT infrastructure? 
 (A)   	
Using biometric authentication for server access 
 (B)   	
Deploying a firewall to protect against cyber threats 
 (C)   	
Establishing a raised floor system in the data 
center 
 (D)   	
Conducting penetration testing on a regular basis 
Explanation 34. Correct Answer: C. Establishing a raised 
floor system in the data center. A raised floor system in a data 
center serves as a physical control by elevating equipment off 
the ground, helping to protect it from potential water damage in 
the event of flooding and providing some protection from other 
environmental risks. 
Option A is incorrect. Using biometric authentication is a 
technical control that enhances security by confirming users’ 
identities based on physical or behavioral attributes. While it 
strengthens access security, it doesn’t provide protection against 
natural disasters. 
	
 
844

Option B is incorrect. Deploying a firewall is a technical 
control that guards against unauthorized access to or from a 
private network. While it protects against cyber threats, it 
doesn’t offer protection against physical threats like natural 
disasters. 
Option D is incorrect. Conducting penetration testing is a 
technical and sometimes operational control that identifies 
vulnerabilities in an organization’s digital assets. While it 
enhances cyber security, it doesn’t protect infrastructure against 
physical threats. 
Question 35. A network engineer is preparing a new batch of 
routers for deployment in a large organization. Which of the 
following steps should the engineer prioritize to ensure that the 
routers are securely configured from the start? 
 (A)   	
Configure the routers to use DHCP to dynamically 
assign IP addresses to connected devices 
 (B)   	
Change the default administrative credentials on 
the routers 
 (C)   	
Update the routers' firmware to the latest, most 
feature-rich version, regardless of its security posture 
 (D)   	
Customize the routers' LED colors for easy 
identification in the server room 
Explanation 35. Correct Answer: B. Change the default 
administrative credentials on the routers. Routers often come 
with default credentials that are widely known and can be easily 
exploited by attackers. Changing these credentials is essential 
for establishing a secure baseline. 
	
 
845

Option A is incorrect. While DHCP is commonly used in many 
networks, enabling it is not necessarily a secure baseline action. 
Additionally, DHCP on routers can be exploited if not securely 
configured. 
Option C is incorrect. Blindly updating to the latest firmware 
without considering its security posture can introduce 
vulnerabilities. It’s important to ensure that the firmware is both 
updated and secure. 
Option D is incorrect. Customizing LED colors relates to 
physical identification and does not inherently improve the 
security configuration of a router. 
Question 36. SecureCom, a telecommunications company, is 
planning to expand its infrastructure across Country A. The 
nation recently updated its telecommunications regulations and 
mandates strict guidelines for all external communications. 
Which of the following should be SecureCom’s primary focus 
as it begins its expansion? 
 (A)   	
Increasing advertising budget to gain a stronger 
market presence in Country A 
 (B)   	
Ensuring its infrastructure meets the national 
standards for secure and encrypted communications 
 (C)   	
Collaborating with local tech companies to better 
understand the culture of Country A 
 (D)   	
Launching new products tailored to the preferences of 
Country A's residents 
Explanation 36. Correct Answer: B. Ensuring its 
infrastructure meets the national standards for secure and 
	
 
846

encrypted communications. Telecommunication companies, 
by their nature, handle vast amounts of data and communication 
traffic. As such, when a nation mandates specific security 
guidelines for external communications, companies like 
SecureCom must ensure their infrastructure complies with those 
guidelines to avoid legal and financial repercussions. 
Option A is incorrect. While advertising is essential for market 
growth, the primary concern when expanding infrastructure in a 
country with strict telecommunications regulations should be 
compliance. 
Option C is incorrect. Collaborating with local tech companies 
can offer insights into the local market, but regulatory 
compliance should remain the primary focus, especially given 
the updated regulations. 
Option D is incorrect. Launching tailored products is a sound 
business strategy, but without ensuring compliance with 
national regulations, the company might face significant 
challenges. 
Question 37. A medical company has recently deployed a 
device to monitor patient heart rates in real time. This device 
uses a real-time operating system (RTOS) to guarantee 
immediate response times. The security team is concerned about 
potential risks. Which of the following would be a KEY 
recommendation to enhance the security of such devices? 
 (A)   	
Ensure real-time data analysis capabilities 
 (B)   	
Integrate the device with the corporate cloud for 
backups 
	
 
847

 (C)   	
Implement strict network segmentation for the 
device 
 (D)   	
Increase the storage capacity of the device 
Explanation 37. Correct Answer: C. Implement strict 
network segmentation for the device. To protect RTOS 
devices, which often prioritize performance over security, it’s 
crucial to minimize their exposure to potential threats. By 
segmenting the network, you can isolate the device from other 
systems and reduce the risk of a security incident. 
Option A is incorrect. Real-time data analysis is more about 
performance and functionality than security. 
Option B is incorrect. Integrating the device with the corporate 
cloud could introduce more security concerns, especially if the 
cloud environment is not secured properly. 
Option D is incorrect. Storage capacity is a matter of device 
functionality, not a direct security enhancement for an RTOS 
device. 
Question 38. DigitalZone Corp, a marketing company, collects 
personal data from users and determines how and why that data 
will be processed. At the same time, they engage an external 
company, CloudSolutions, to store and manage this data. In this 
scenario, what role does DigitalZone Corp play in relation to 
data protection regulations? 
 (A)   	
Processor 
 (B)   	
Data subject 
	
 
848

 (C)   	
Controller 
 (D)   	
Third-party provider 
Explanation 38. Correct Answer: C. Controller. DigitalZone 
Corp makes decisions about how and why the data is processed, 
which means they play the role of the controller in the context 
of data protection regulations. 
Option A is incorrect. The processor is the entity that processes 
personal data on behalf of the controller. In this scenario, 
CloudSolutions acts as the processor as they are storing and 
managing the data for DigitalZone Corp. 
Option B is incorrect. The data subject is the individual whose 
personal data is being collected. It’s not an entity that makes 
decisions about the data or processes it. 
Option D is incorrect. While CloudSolutions could be 
considered a third-party provider, this term is broader and does 
not specifically refer to an entity’s role in data protection terms 
as a controller or processor. 
Question 39. During an annual review, a company discovered 
that one of its critical systems had several unscheduled 
downtimes over the year. The CTO has recommended a move 
towards high availability architecture to address this. What is 
the PRIMARY concern when implementing high availability? 
(A)       Ensuring that there are no single points of failure 
(B)       Ensuring that the system is patched regularly 
(C)       Implementing multi-factor authentication 
(D)       Storing backups in multiple geographical locations 
	
 
849

Explanation 39. Correct Answer: A. Ensuring that there are 
no single points of failure. In a high availability (HA) system, 
eliminating single points of failure is of utmost importance. By 
ensuring redundancy at every potential failure point, the system 
can remain operational even if a component fails. 
Option B is incorrect. While patching is important for security, 
it is not the primary concern when implementing high 
availability. 
Option C is incorrect. Multi-factor authentication is essential 
for secure access but does not directly relate to high availability 
architecture. 
Option D is incorrect. Having backups in various geographical 
locations is more relevant to disaster recovery than to high 
availability. 
Question 40. In a cloud environment, which of the following 
matrices defines the shared responsibilities between the cloud 
provider and the customer for specific cloud service models? 
 (A)   	
Shared Accountability Matrix 
 (B)   	
Cloud Resource Allocation Table 
 (C)   	
Cloud Security Posture Matrix 
 (D)   	
Cloud Responsibility Matrix 
Explanation 40. Correct Answer: D. Cloud Responsibility 
Matrix. The Cloud Responsibility Matrix defines the shared 
responsibilities between the cloud provider and the customer in 
a cloud environment, delineating what security measures the 
	
 
850

provider will handle and which ones are the responsibility of the 
customer. 
Option A is incorrect. While the term “Shared Accountability 
Matrix” may sound relevant, there’s no standard matrix in cloud 
computing with this name. Shared responsibility is the concept, 
but the actual term used in the context of cloud security is the 
“Cloud Responsibility Matrix.” 
Option B is incorrect. A “Cloud Resource Allocation Table” is 
not a standard term associated with delineating responsibilities 
in the cloud. It sounds more related to how resources, such as 
compute or storage, might be allocated. 
Option C is incorrect. “Cloud Security Posture Matrix” is not a 
recognized term for defining shared responsibilities in cloud 
environments. Instead, it sounds more like a potential term for 
an organization’s stance or positioning regarding cloud security. 
Question 41. A multinational company is planning to issue 
company-owned mobile devices to its executives. Given the 
sensitivity of the data the executives handle, what hardening 
measure would be MOST effective to ensure the security of 
these mobile devices? 
(A)       Regularly updating the company's social media profiles 
to mention the security measures taken 
(B)       Implementing biometric authentication in addition 
to strong passcodes 
(C)       Turning off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi when not in use 
(D)       Setting the devices to display brighter screen colors 
	
 
851

Explanation 41. Correct Answer: B. Implementing 
biometric authentication in addition to strong passcodes. 
Biometric authentication (like fingerprint or facial recognition) 
combined with strong passcodes provides a robust multi-factor 
authentication mechanism, making unauthorized access to the 
device significantly more challenging. 
Option A is incorrect. Publicly announcing security measures 
on social media does not harden the device. Moreover, 
divulging too much about security practices could expose the 
organization to targeted attacks. 
Option C is incorrect. While turning off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi 
can reduce certain attack vectors, it’s not as comprehensive a 
security measure as implementing strong multi-factor 
authentication. 
Option D is incorrect. Screen colors have no direct correlation 
to the security hardening of a device. 
Question 42. A multinational company is deploying a new set 
of servers in its data centers across various countries. Which of 
the following steps should be taken FIRST to ensure the servers 
are secured against potential threats? 
 (A)   	
Set up a monitoring system to alert the IT team of any 
irregular activities 
 (B)   	
Deploy all the software applications the company 
might need in the future 
 (C)   	
Use the server's default configuration to ensure 
manufacturer's best practices are maintained 
	
 
852

 (D)   	
Disable any unused services and ports on the 
server 
Explanation 42. Correct Answer: D. Disable any unused 
services and ports on the server. When setting up a new 
server, it’s crucial to minimize its attack surface. Disabling 
unused services and ports ensures that only necessary services 
run on the server, reducing potential vulnerabilities. 
Option A is incorrect. While monitoring is vital for security, 
before setting up a monitoring system, it’s more crucial to 
harden the server to minimize vulnerabilities. Monitoring 
should complement hardening measures. 
Option B is incorrect. Deploying all the software applications 
the company might need in the future can introduce unnecessary 
vulnerabilities and overhead. It’s better to install only what’s 
needed and keep the server lean. 
Option C is incorrect. Relying on a server’s default 
configuration can be risky, as it might not be tailored for an 
organization’s specific needs and could have open ports or 
services that are unnecessary. 
Question 43. During an incident response, the IT team 
discovers malware that collects information about military 
projects. The malware sends the data to a server located in a 
foreign country. Which type of threat actor would MOST likely 
be involved in this type of cyber espionage? 
 (A)   	
Disgruntled employee 
 (B)   	
Nation-state 
	
 
853

 (C)   	
Phishing scam artist 
 (D)   	
Hacktivist 
Explanation 43. Correct Answer: B. Nation-state. Malware 
that specifically targets information about military projects and 
sends data to a foreign server is indicative of cyber espionage, a 
tactic commonly employed by nation-states. They have the 
motivation to gather intelligence and potentially disrupt or gain 
advantages over other nations, particularly concerning military 
or defense-related data. 
Option A is incorrect. While a disgruntled employee might 
have a motive to harm the company, they wouldn’t typically be 
involved in the collection of military project information for a 
foreign nation. 
Option C is incorrect. Phishing scam artists primarily focus on 
deceiving individuals into revealing personal or financial 
information. They typically don’t have interest or resources for 
collecting military-specific data for foreign espionage. 
Option D is incorrect. Hacktivists are typically motivated by 
ideological, environmental, or political causes. While they 
might disrupt services or leak information, targeting military 
projects for a foreign nation isn’t a typical characteristic of their 
activities. 
Question 44. A large e-commerce platform is facing challenges 
during peak sale periods, where the influx of users causes 
slowdowns and occasional outages. Which of the following 
solutions would BEST improve scalability during these high-
	
 
854

demand times? 
 (A)   	
Implement a centralized logging system 
 (B)   	
Employ auto-scaling cloud solutions 
 (C)   	
Increase the frequency of data backups 
 (D)   	
Mandate regular security training for employees 
Explanation 44. Correct Answer: B. Employ auto-scaling 
cloud solutions. Auto-scaling in cloud solutions automatically 
adjusts the number of computational resources based on the 
actual demand. During peak periods, resources can be 
automatically increased to handle the demand, ensuring the 
system remains scalable and responsive. 
Option A is incorrect. A centralized logging system is 
beneficial for monitoring and troubleshooting, but it does not 
directly address scalability during peak times. 
Option C is incorrect. Increasing the frequency of data 
backups is a good practice for data integrity and recovery but 
does not handle scalability concerns directly. 
Option D is incorrect. Regular security training is crucial for a 
company’s cybersecurity posture, but it does not address the 
architectural scalability of the platform. 
Question 45. A large enterprise is considering a transition to a 
more flexible and programmable network architecture. They 
want to centralize the control plane, allowing for automated, 
programmable network configurations and rapid provisioning. 
Which network architecture model should they consider? 
 (A)   	
VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) 
	
 
855

 (B)   	
MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) 
 (C)   	
VPN (Virtual Private Network) 
 (D)   	
SDN (Software-Defined Networking) 
Explanation 45. Correct Answer: D. SDN (Software-Defined 
Networking). Software-Defined Networking (SDN) centralizes 
the control plane, decoupling it from the data plane. This allows 
for a more flexible and programmable network, enabling 
automated configurations, and rapid provisioning. 
Option A is incorrect. A VLAN is used to create logical 
networks within a physical network but doesn’t provide 
centralized control or programmability across the entire 
network. 
Option B is incorrect. MPLS is a type of data-carrying 
technique for high-performance telecommunications networks. 
It doesn’t centralize network control or enhance 
programmability as SDN does. 
Option C is incorrect. A VPN is designed to provide a secure 
tunnel between networks over potentially insecure mediums like 
the internet. It does not offer the centralized, programmable 
configuration benefits of SDN. 
Question 46. An audit report indicates that several network 
switches in a data center lack security configurations, making 
them potential targets for attackers. Which of the following 
hardening techniques would BEST reduce the risk associated 
with these switches? 
 (A)   	
Configuring port mirroring to monitor network traffic 
	
 
856

 (B)   	
Disabling unused switch ports 
 (C)   	
Implementing load balancing across the switches 
 (D)   	
Increasing the MAC address table size for 
performance 
Explanation 46. Correct Answer: B. Disabling unused 
switch ports. By disabling unused switch ports, you minimize 
potential points of entry for unauthorized devices or attackers. 
This is a basic step in network switch hardening. 
Option A is incorrect. Port mirroring is used for monitoring 
and isn’t directly a hardening technique. While monitoring is 
crucial for security, it doesn’t necessarily prevent unauthorized 
access. 
Option C is incorrect. Load balancing is primarily about 
distributing network traffic efficiently across multiple paths or 
resources, and it doesn’t inherently harden the switches. 
Option D is incorrect. Increasing the MAC address table size 
might improve switch performance in certain scenarios, but it 
does not harden the switch against potential security threats. 
Question 47. An e-commerce platform reported a series of 
breaches over the past month. With each breach, financial and 
personal data of thousands of users were exfiltrated. The 
perpetrators subsequently sold the data on the dark web. Which 
type of threat actor is MOST likely behind these breaches? 
 (A)   	
Insider threat 
 (B)   	
Hacktivist 
	
 
857

 (C)   	
Organized crime syndicate 
 (D)   	
Nation-state 
Explanation 47.  Correct Answer: C. Organized crime 
syndicate. Organized crime syndicates are primarily motivated 
by financial gains. The act of exfiltrating financial and personal 
data from an e-commerce platform, only to sell it on the dark 
web, aligns with the profit-driven motives of organized crime 
groups. 
Option A is incorrect. While insider threats can indeed pose 
significant risks, they are typically motivated by personal 
grievances, revenge, or opportunistic financial gains. The 
systematic breaches and subsequent sale of data on the dark 
web point more towards an organized group than an individual 
insider. 
Option B is incorrect. Hacktivists primarily target 
organizations to further or protest a political or social cause. 
The described actions, focused on profiting from stolen data, are 
not aligned with typical hacktivist motives. 
Option D is incorrect. While nation-states might engage in 
cyber espionage or cyber warfare for political or strategic 
reasons, they are not typically involved in the theft of financial 
data for direct monetary gain. 
Question 48. A company’s primary security control for 
accessing secure server rooms is a biometric fingerprint scanner. 
However, the scanner occasionally malfunctions in high 
humidity. The security team is considering an alternative 
	
 
858

solution to grant access when the primary method fails. Which 
of the following would be the MOST appropriate compensating 
control? 
 (A)   	
Implementing a security token-based 
authentication system 
 (B)   	
Employing security guards at the main entrance 
 (C)   	
Installing security cameras inside the server room 
 (D)   	
Conducting regular server room audits 
Explanation 48. Correct Answer: A. Implementing a 
security token-based authentication system. A security token-
based authentication system would act as an alternative method 
for verifying the identity of individuals when the primary 
control (biometric fingerprint scanner) fails. This serves as a 
direct compensating control for access. 
Option B is incorrect. While security guards at the main 
entrance can provide an added layer of security, they aren’t a 
direct compensating control for a malfunctioning biometric 
system in a specific location like the server room. 
Option C is incorrect. While security cameras provide 
surveillance, they don’t act as an alternative method for granting 
or denying access to the server room. 
Option D is incorrect. Conducting regular server room audits 
is a detective control. It won’t provide real-time access or 
compensate for the malfunctioning fingerprint scanner. 
Question 49. A medium-sized financial firm has noticed a 
series of unauthorized transactions moving funds from 
	
 
859

legitimate accounts to overseas locations. After investigating, it 
was found that a group was responsible for exploiting 
vulnerabilities in the firm’s transaction system. Which of the 
following motivations is most likely driving this group’s 
actions? 
 (A)   	
Seeking notoriety within the hacker community 
 (B)   	
Financial gain from unauthorized transactions 
 (C)   	
Demonstrating political beliefs against financial 
institutions 
 (D)   	
Espionage to uncover the firm's investment strategies 
Explanation 49. Correct Answer: B. Financial gain from 
unauthorized transactions. The unauthorized transactions 
moving funds to overseas locations indicate a direct attempt to 
illicitly acquire funds, pointing towards a motivation of 
financial gain. 
Option A is incorrect. There’s no evidence to suggest the 
group’s actions are driven by a desire for recognition or 
notoriety. The focus is on moving funds. 
Option C is incorrect. While some groups might target 
financial institutions to make a political statement, the 
unauthorized transactions to overseas accounts suggest a 
financial motive, not a political one. 
Option D is incorrect. There’s no indication the group is 
interested in the firm’s investment strategies. The activity is 
focused on moving money, not gathering intelligence.

Question 50. TechGuard Corp. conducts a risk assessment 
every six months to identify new vulnerabilities and ensure that 
previous risk-mitigation strategies remain effective. This type of 
risk assessment is best described as: 
 (A)   	
Periodic 
 (B)   	
Ad hoc 
 (C)   	
Continuous 
 (D)   	
Recurring 
Explanation 50. Correct Answer: D. Recurring. Recurring 
risk assessments are those that are conducted at regular 
intervals, such as quarterly, biannually, or annually, to 
continually identify, review, and address vulnerabilities and 
threats. 
Option A is incorrect. While “periodic” might sound similar to 
“recurring”, in the context of risk assessments, the term 
“recurring” more accurately describes assessments that are 
conducted regularly at defined intervals. 
Option B is incorrect. Ad hoc risk assessments are done in 
response to a specific event or situation and are not planned in 
advance. 
Option C is incorrect. Continuous risk assessments involve 
constant or ongoing monitoring of risks, rather than taking place 
at set intervals. 
Question 51. An e-commerce company recently faced a DDoS 
attack that rendered its website unavailable for several hours. 
While reflecting on the incident, the CISO emphasized the 
	
 
861

importance of having a detailed plan that includes identification, 
containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned. Which 
policy primarily encompasses these stages for handling security 
incidents? 
 (A)   	
Change Management Policy 
 (B)    	
Incident Response Policy 
 (C)         Disaster Recovery Policy 
 (D)   	
Remote Access Policy 
Explanation 51. Correct Answer: B. Incident Response 
Policy. An Incident Response Policy outlines the procedures 
and guidelines for effectively responding to and managing 
security incidents. It includes various stages like identification, 
containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned to 
ensure a systematic approach to handling security threats. 
Option A is incorrect. A Change Management Policy focuses 
on procedures and guidelines for making changes in the IT 
environment to ensure stability and security. It does not deal 
with responding to security incidents directly. 
Option C is incorrect. The Disaster Recovery Policy pertains 
to recovering IT systems, applications, and data after a 
catastrophic event, rather than the steps for managing security 
incidents. 
Option D is incorrect. Remote Access Policy details the 
guidelines for accessing the organization’s network from remote 
locations. It doesn’t provide a structured methodology for 
handling security incidents. 
	
 
862

Question 52. MatrixCorp recently adopted a mobile strategy 
where employees are provided with company-owned devices. 
These devices are also allowed for personal use, but the 
organization retains the ability to manage and monitor them. 
Which deployment model is MatrixCorp using? 
 (A)   	
Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) 
 (B)   	
Choose Your Own Device (CYOD) 
 (C)   	
Corporate-owned, Personally Enabled (COPE) 
 (D)   	
Public Device Deployment (PDD) 
Explanation 52. Correct Answer: C. Corporate-owned, 
Personally Enabled (COPE). The COPE model involves 
organizations providing employees with company-owned 
devices that they can also use for personal tasks. However, the 
company retains full control, management, and monitoring 
capabilities over these devices. 
Option A is incorrect. In the BYOD model, employees use 
their personal devices for work, not company-provided ones. 
Option B is incorrect. CYOD allows employees to select a 
device from a list of company-approved devices, but the 
emphasis is on choice rather than personal use of corporate-
owned devices. 
Option D is incorrect. Public Device Deployment (PDD) is not 
a recognized deployment model in the context of mobile 
solutions. 
Question 53. The network administrator of a rapidly growing 
tech firm is concerned about the potential vulnerabilities of the 
	
 
863

company’s switches. Which of the following measures is MOST 
effective in hardening these network switches against possible 
attacks? 
 (A)   	
Assigning static IP addresses to all connected devices 
 (B)   	
Implementing strong password policies for switch 
access 
 (C)   	
Upgrading the switches to support 10Gbps for future 
expansion 
 (D)   	
Customizing the switch LED colors for easy 
identification 
Explanation 53. Correct Answer: B. Implementing strong 
password policies for switch access. Hardening switches 
involves reducing their vulnerability to unauthorized access and 
potential misuse. Implementing strong password policies 
ensures that only authorized personnel can access and configure 
the switches. 
Option A is incorrect. While assigning static IP addresses 
might help in network management, it does not inherently 
harden a switch against potential attacks. 
Option C is incorrect. Upgrading the speed capabilities of 
switches, such as supporting 10Gbps, is a performance 
enhancement and not directly related to hardening or security. 
Option D is incorrect. Customizing LED colors is related to 
physical identification and does not improve the security 
posture of the switch. 
	
 
864

Question 54. A developer at your company is excited about the 
scalability benefits of serverless architecture and has deployed a 
new service using it. However, you notice an increased bill due 
to the service even when it’s not in use. Which of the following 
could be a contributing factor? 
 (A)   	
The serverless functions are continuously triggered 
by unintended events 
 (B)   	
The server hardware is outdated 
 (C)   	
The load balancer is misconfigured 
 (D)   	
The organization lacks a Content Delivery Network 
(CDN) 
Explanation 54. Correct Answer: A. The serverless functions 
are continuously triggered by unintended events. Serverless 
architectures charge based on the number of function 
invocations and the execution time. If there are unintended 
events, such as rogue requests or misconfigured triggers, 
continuously invoking the serverless functions, it could lead to 
unexpected costs. 
Option B is incorrect. In a serverless architecture, the 
responsibility of server hardware management lies with the 
service provider. The customer is abstracted from the hardware 
details. 
Option C is incorrect. A misconfigured load balancer might 
affect availability or performance but is not directly related to 
unexpected cost hikes in a serverless deployment. 
Option D is incorrect. While CDNs are valuable for optimizing 
content delivery, they are not directly related to the cost 
	
 
865

implications of unintended function invocations in a serverless 
architecture. 
Question 55. AlphaTech wants to ensure that its remote 
employees follow best security practices when working from 
home. The security team has been tasked with drafting a set of 
guidelines for remote work. What should be the primary focus 
of these guidelines? 
(A)       Outlining punitive measures for non-compliance 
(B)       Stating the company's legal position on remote work 
(C)       Recommending security measures for home 
networks and devices 
(D)       Dictating the exact software and hardware specifications 
for remote workers 
Explanation 55. Correct Answer: C. Recommending 
security measures for home networks and devices. 
Guidelines aim to provide advice and recommendations. In the 
context of remote work, they would suggest best security 
practices for securing home networks and devices without being 
overly prescriptive. 
Option A is incorrect. Punitive measures and compliance 
repercussions are typically outlined in policies or procedures, 
not guidelines. 
Option B is incorrect. The company’s legal position on remote 
work would be part of a policy or a legal document rather than a 
set of guidelines. 
	
 
866

Option D is incorrect. Dictating exact software and hardware 
specifications would be more in line with standards rather than 
guidelines. Guidelines would provide broader 
recommendations. 
Question 56. Lisa, a security manager, is reviewing the 
company’s existing policies and realizes that there isn’t a 
comprehensive document detailing the organization’s stance, 
expectations, and commitment to protecting its information 
assets. Which of the following should Lisa prioritize creating to 
address this gap? 
 (A)   	
Incident Response Plan 
 (B)   	
Information Security Policy 
 (C)   	
Acceptable Use Policy 
 (D)   	
Data Backup Strategy 
Explanation 56. Correct Answer: B. Information Security 
Policy. An Information Security Policy is a foundational 
document that provides a framework for information security 
throughout the organization. It encompasses the organization’s 
vision, principles, and responsibilities regarding the protection 
of its data and IT assets. 
Option A is incorrect. An Incident Response Plan focuses on 
the steps to be taken after a security incident has occurred. It 
does not detail the overall stance of an organization on 
information security. 
Option C is incorrect. An Acceptable Use Policy provides 
guidelines on how employees should use company resources, 
	
 
867

but it doesn’t provide a comprehensive overview of an 
organization’s commitment to protecting its information assets. 
Option D is incorrect. While a Data Backup Strategy is crucial 
for data availability and recovery, it does not convey the broader 
perspective and commitment of the organization to information 
security. 
Question 57. GlobalFin, a fintech company, has developed a 
new mobile banking application. To avoid any legal 
complications, which of the following legal external 
considerations should GlobalFin pay the most attention to 
before launching the application worldwide? 
 (A)   	
Ensuring the app meets global data privacy laws 
 (B)   	
Confirming the color scheme aligns with branding 
regulations in all countries 
 (C)   	
Securing copyrights for all images used in the app 
 (D)   	
Making sure the app's name isn't offensive in any 
language 
Explanation 57. Correct Answer: A. Ensuring the app meets 
global data privacy laws. For a mobile banking application, 
ensuring compliance with global data privacy laws is 
paramount. Different regions have varying requirements and 
regulations about how user data should be handled, stored, and 
processed. 
Option B is incorrect. While branding and color schemes are 
important for marketing, they are not typically subjects of strict 
legal regulation like data privacy laws. 
	
 
868

Option C is incorrect. While securing copyrights is important, 
the primary legal concern for a banking application would be 
related to data privacy and security, given the sensitive nature of 
financial data. 
Option D is incorrect. Although it’s good practice to ensure an 
app’s name is culturally sensitive, the primary legal concern for 
a banking app would be data privacy and security regulations. 
Question 58. In a microservices architecture, each service 
should be designed with a specific principle to ensure it 
performs a specific task and interacts with other services 
through well-defined interfaces. What principle is this referring 
to? 
 (A)   	
Principle of Least Privilege 
 (B)   	
Single Responsibility Principle 
 (C)   	
Open-Closed Principle 
 (D)   	
Zero Trust Model 
Explanation 58. Correct Answer: B. Single Responsibility 
Principle. The Single Responsibility Principle dictates that a 
class or module (or in the context of microservices, a service) 
should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only 
have one job or responsibility. In microservices, this ensures 
that each service does one thing and does it well, and interacts 
with others through clear interfaces. 
Option A is incorrect. The Principle of Least Privilege is about 
ensuring that users or services have only the permissions they 
need to perform their tasks and nothing more. It’s not 
specifically about the design of the service itself. 
	
 
869

Option C is incorrect. The Open-Closed Principle is a design 
principle stating that software entities should be open for 
extension but closed for modification. While relevant for 
software design, it’s not the primary principle guiding the 
design of individual microservices. 
Option D is incorrect. The Zero Trust Model is a security 
concept where no one, whether inside or outside the 
organization, is trusted by default. It’s not a principle specific to 
microservice design. 
Question 59. XYZ Corp is in the process of defining clear roles 
and responsibilities for their IT assets. During a meeting, the 
team discussed the primary individual who will have the 
responsibility for the data within a specific IT system and also 
be the main point of contact for any decisions related to it. 
Which of the following roles best describes this individual? 
 (A)   	
System administrator 
 (B)   	
Data custodian 
 (C)   	
System owner 
 (D)   	
End-user 
Explanation 59. Correct Answer: C. System owner. The 
system owner, sometimes known as the data owner, is typically 
responsible for the data within a specific IT system. They have 
the primary responsibility for ensuring the confidentiality, 
integrity, and availability of the data and act as the main point of 
contact for decisions related to that system. 
Option A is incorrect. A system administrator is responsible 
for the daily management, operations, and support of IT systems 
	
 
870

but doesn’t usually make high-level decisions about the data 
contained within them. 
Option B is incorrect. A data custodian is typically responsible 
for implementing the controls and processes as defined by the 
data owner. They may handle the practical aspects of data 
management, but they don’t usually make overarching decisions 
about the data. 
Option D is incorrect. An end-user utilizes the data or system 
for their job function but doesn’t typically have decision-
making responsibilities regarding the data’s overall 
management and protection. 
Question 60. An organization with a single physical network 
infrastructure wants to separate the traffic of its finance 
department from that of the HR department. They do not want 
to set up entirely new physical networks but want to ensure that 
data packets from one department do not mix with the other’s. 
What should the organization implement? 
 (A)   	
Air-gapped network 
 (B)   	
DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) 
 (C)   	
VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) 
 (D)   	
VPN (Virtual Private Network) 
Explanation 60. Correct Answer: C. VLAN (Virtual Local 
Area Network). A VLAN allows a network administrator to 
create a logical network within a physical network. This logical 
segmentation can separate the traffic of different departments, 
ensuring that data packets from one VLAN do not mix with 
another, effectively isolating them. 
	
 
871

Option A is incorrect. An air-gapped network is a physically 
isolated network and would require setting up a new physical 
network. 
Option B is incorrect. A DMZ is a buffer zone between a 
private network and external networks. It doesn’t help in 
segmenting traffic within the internal network. 
Option D is incorrect. A VPN is used to create secure 
connections over an unsecured network. It does not logically 
segment traffic within a single physical network. 
Question 61. A medium-sized company suffered a data breach. 
Investigations revealed that an attacker from a rival firm had 
exploited a misconfigured firewall to gain unauthorized access 
to the company’s database. Based on the attributes of the actor, 
how would this threat actor be best described? 
 (A)   	
Internal actor leveraging physical access 
 (B)   	
Internal actor abusing privileges 
 (C)   	
External actor using social engineering 
 (D)   	
External actor exploiting technical vulnerabilities 
Explanation 61. Correct Answer: D. External actor 
exploiting technical vulnerabilities. The attacker originated 
from outside the victim organization (a rival firm) and exploited 
a technical issue (misconfigured firewall) to gain access. This 
categorizes them as an external actor exploiting technical 
vulnerabilities. 
	
 
872

Option A is incorrect. The attacker was from a rival firm and 
did not utilize physical access within the victim organization. 
Therefore, this description doesn’t match the scenario. 
Option B is incorrect. The scenario doesn’t mention any 
internal actors or abuse of privileges. Instead, it describes an 
external attacker from a rival firm. 
Option C is incorrect. While the attacker was external, the 
scenario does not describe any use of social engineering tactics. 
Instead, the attacker exploited a technical vulnerability 
(misconfigured firewall). 
Question 62. A global corporation has undergone several IT 
incidents in the past year, including outages due to natural 
disasters and cyber attacks. The CEO wants to ensure the 
organization’s IT infrastructure can withstand or rapidly recover 
from disruptive events. Which of the following best 
encapsulates this requirement? 
 (A)   	
Adopting a Zero Trust Architecture 
 (B)   	
Implementing a strict password policy 
 (C)   	
Establishing a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) 
with emphasis on resilience 
 (D)   	
Regularly updating firewall rules 
Explanation 62. Correct Answer: C. Establishing a Business 
Continuity Plan (BCP) with emphasis on resilience. 
Resilience in this context refers to the ability of the IT 
infrastructure to rapidly recover and continue functioning even 
after disruptive events. A Business Continuity Plan with a focus 
	
 
873

on resilience would help the organization prepare for, respond 
to, and recover from both natural and man-made incidents. 
Option A is incorrect. Zero Trust Architecture emphasizes not 
trusting any user or system, both inside and outside the 
perimeter, but it doesn’t address resilience against disruptive 
events directly. 
Option B is incorrect. While password policies are essential 
for security, they are not centered around ensuring resilience 
against disruptive events. 
Option D is incorrect. Updating firewall rules is crucial for 
keeping out unwanted traffic and potential threats but doesn’t 
directly address the resilience of an IT infrastructure against 
major disruptive events. 
Question 63. A company has faced multiple instances of 
unauthorized individuals gaining access to their office premises. 
Which of the following preventive security controls would be 
MOST effective in preventing unauthorized physical access? 
 (A)   	
Implementing a log monitoring solution for network 
traffic 
 (B)   	
Installing video surveillance cameras at all entry 
and exit points 
 (C)   	
Conducting regular security awareness training for 
employees 
 (D)   	
Implementing a multi-factor authentication system for 
network access. 
	
 
874

Explanation 63. Correct Answer: B. Installing video 
surveillance cameras at all entry and exit points. Installing 
video surveillance cameras at all entry and exit points acts as a 
preventive control by deterring unauthorized individuals from 
attempting to gain access, given the increased risk of detection 
and recording. 
Option A is incorrect. Implementing a log monitoring solution 
is a detective control that provides insights into network 
activities but doesn’t prevent unauthorized physical access. 
Option C is incorrect. Conducting regular security awareness 
training is a preventive measure, but its main focus is on 
making employees aware of security risks and best practices, 
not directly preventing unauthorized physical access. 
Option D is incorrect. Implementing a multi-factor 
authentication system is a preventive control for unauthorized 
digital access but doesn’t address the prevention of 
unauthorized physical access. 
Question 64. After detecting an unauthorized intrusion into 
their network, a financial institution wants to implement a 
control that will restore compromised systems to a known good 
state. Which of the following would be the MOST appropriate 
corrective control? 
 (A)   	
Implementing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) 
across the network 
 (B)   	
Frequently updating firewall rules 
 (C)   	
Restoring systems from verified backups 
 (D)   	
Enabling multi-factor authentication for users 
	
 
875

Explanation 64. Correct Answer: C. Deploying infrared (IR) 
sensors. Infrared (IR) sensors detect infrared radiation, such as 
the heat emitted by the human body. This makes them 
particularly effective in detecting human intruders, even in 
complete darkness, based on the body heat they emit. 
Option A is incorrect. While CCTV cameras with LED lights 
can provide visual surveillance, they rely on light to produce 
images and may not detect intruders in complete darkness as 
efficiently as infrared sensors. 
Option B is incorrect. Ultrasonic motion sensors detect 
movement through sound waves, not body heat, making them 
less efficient in differentiating between a human intruder and 
other moving objects. 
Option D is incorrect. RFID badge readers control access at 
entry points but do not detect human intruders based on their 
body heat inside a facility. 
Question 65. An organization that processes classified 
information is implementing a network infrastructure to ensure 
the highest level of data security. The CISO recommends using 
a network configuration that ensures the system remains 
completely disconnected from unsecured networks and any 
external connections. Which of the following describes this type 
of configuration? 
 (A)   	
DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) 
 (B)   	
VPN (Virtual Private Network) 
 (C)   	
VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) 
 (D)   	
Air-gapped network 
	
 
876

Explanation 65. Correct Answer: D. Air-gapped network. 
An air-gapped network is a network that is physically isolated 
from unsecured networks. Computers on an air-gapped network 
cannot communicate with non-air-gapped computers and aren’t 
connected to external networks or the internet, ensuring the 
highest level of data security. 
Option A is incorrect. A DMZ is a buffer zone between a 
private network and external networks (typically the internet). 
It’s designed to provide an additional layer of security but does 
not guarantee complete isolation. 
Option B is incorrect. VPNs are used to establish secure 
connections over an unsecured network, such as the internet. 
They encrypt the data being transferred but don’t physically 
isolate a network. 
Option C is incorrect. A VLAN is a logically segmented 
network within a physical network. It allows for the separation 
of broadcast domains in a Layer 2 network, but it doesn’t 
provide complete physical isolation from other networks. 
Question 66. A small business detected unauthorized access to 
its website. The attacker used default login credentials to gain 
access. What level of sophistication and capability does this 
attack suggest about the threat actor? 
 (A)   	
Script kiddie with basic skills 
 (B)	         Expert attacker leveraging advanced techniques 
 (C)   	
Nation-state actor with strategic objectives 
 (D)   	
Organized crime syndicate targeting high-value assets 
	
 
877

Explanation 66. Correct Answer: A. Script kiddie with basic 
skills. Using default login credentials for unauthorized access 
typically indicates a low level of sophistication, as this method 
is basic and requires little to no technical skill. Such attackers, 
often termed “script kiddies,” usually exploit known 
vulnerabilities with pre-existing tools or scripts without fully 
understanding them. 
Option B is incorrect. An expert attacker would likely utilize 
more advanced techniques and not rely solely on default 
credentials. 
Option C is incorrect. While nation-state actors have the 
capability for sophisticated attacks, the use of default login 
credentials as the primary method of unauthorized access 
doesn’t align with the complex methodologies usually 
employed by such actors. 
Option D is incorrect. Organized crime syndicates, especially 
those targeting high-value assets, would employ more 
sophisticated techniques than merely using default login 
credentials. 
Question 67. To discourage potential cybercriminals from 
targeting their online storefront, an e-commerce company is 
considering various security measures. Which of the following 
would act MOST effectively as a deterrent control? 
 (A)   	
Displaying a seal for third-party security 
certifications on the website 
 (B)   	
Using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
	
 
878

 (C)   	
Conducting monthly vulnerability assessments 
 (D)   	
Storing customer data in encrypted databases 
Explanation 67. Correct Answer: A. Displaying a seal for 
third-party security certifications on the website. Displaying 
a seal for third-party security certifications on the website 
serves as a deterrent control. It sends a message to potential 
attackers that the site is recognized for its security measures, 
which can discourage them from attempting an attack. 
Option B is incorrect. Using a Web Application Firewall 
(WAF) is a preventive control. It filters, monitors, and blocks 
malicious web traffic. While it helps in defending against cyber 
threats, it doesn’t act as a visible deterrent to attackers. 
Option C is incorrect. Conducting monthly vulnerability 
assessments is a detective control. It identifies vulnerabilities to 
enhance the security posture but doesn’t act as a deterrent to 
potential attackers. 
Option D is incorrect. Storing customer data in encrypted 
databases is a preventive control that ensures unauthorized 
individuals cannot access or comprehend the stored data. It 
protects data but doesn’t deter potential cybercriminals. 
Question 68. A system administrator is setting up an 
authentication system for a new web application. Which of the 
following security controls falls under the technical category 
and ensures that users prove their identity before gaining 
access? 
 (A)   	
Implementing a security awareness training program 
	
 
879

 (B)   	
Conducting a background check for new employees 
 (C)   	
Using multi-factor authentication 
 (D)   	
Establishing a clean desk policy 
Explanation 68. Correct Answer: C. Using multi-factor 
authentication. Multi-factor authentication is a technical 
control that requires users to present two or more pieces of 
evidence (factors) before gaining access. It provides an 
additional layer of security to ensure that users are who they say 
they are. 
Option A is incorrect. Implementing a security awareness 
training program is an administrative control, as it involves 
educating employees on security best practices rather than using 
technical measures to enforce them. 
Option B is incorrect. Conducting a background check is an 
administrative control as it involves vetting potential employees 
before they’re hired. This process doesn’t directly enforce 
technical measures on systems or networks. 
Option D is incorrect. Establishing a clean desk policy is an 
administrative control. It sets a guideline for employees to keep 
their workspaces tidy and free of sensitive information, rather 
than enforcing technical measures. 
Question 69. CyberFirm, a leading software development 
company, recently updated their server OS due to new features 
and patches. Given that they have already established and 
deployed a secure baseline in the past, what should CyberFirm 
do NEXT to ensure continued security? 
	
 
880

 (A)   	
Conduct a complete system reboot for all servers 
 (B)   	
Re-deploy the same baseline without any 
modifications 
 (C)   	
Update the secure baseline to include new 
configurations and then deploy it 
 (D)   	
Implement a new firewall rule for the servers 
Explanation 69. Correct Answer: C. Update the secure 
baseline to include new configurations and then deploy it. 
When there are significant updates or changes to systems, it’s 
crucial to review and update the secure baseline accordingly, 
ensuring it remains relevant and effective for the current 
environment. After updating the baseline, it should then be re-
deployed. 
Option A is incorrect. A complete system reboot does not 
address the maintenance of the secure baseline after an OS 
update. 
Option B is incorrect. Simply re-deploying the same baseline 
without adjustments might miss out on specific configurations 
or considerations needed due to the OS update. 
Option D is incorrect. While firewall rules are essential for 
security, they don’t directly address the maintenance and 
updating of a secure baseline. 
Question 70. A cybersecurity analyst has noticed a series of 
sophisticated attacks against critical infrastructure systems in 
their country. The attacks are highly coordinated, well-funded, 
and appear to have specific geopolitical objectives. Which type 
	
 
881

of threat actor is MOST likely responsible for these attacks? 
 (A)   	
Organized crime syndicates 
 (B)   	
Script kiddies 
 (C)   	
Insider threat 
 (D)   	
Nation-state 
Explanation 70. Correct Answer: D. Nation-state. 
Sophisticated, coordinated, and well-funded attacks against 
national critical infrastructure with clear geopolitical objectives 
align most closely with the characteristics and motivations of 
nation-state actors. They often have vast resources and specific 
political or strategic motives, targeting critical infrastructures to 
cause significant impact or gain a strategic advantage. 
Option A is incorrect. While organized crime syndicates might 
be well-funded and capable of launching sophisticated attacks, 
they are typically driven by financial motives rather than 
geopolitical objectives. 
Option B is incorrect. Script kiddies are amateur hackers who 
use pre-written scripts or tools to exploit vulnerabilities. They 
typically lack the sophistication and resources to launch 
coordinated attacks against critical infrastructure. 
Option C is incorrect. Insider threats come from individuals 
within the organization, like employees or contractors. While 
they can be harmful, the described scenario is more indicative 
of an external, nation-state actor with significant resources and 
geopolitical motives. 
	
 
882

Question 71. An e-commerce company is preparing for an 
upcoming Black Friday sale, expecting a surge in web traffic. 
To ensure their systems remain responsive during the sale, 
which of the following would be the MOST effective strategy to 
implement? 
 (A)   	
Increasing password complexity for all users 
 (B)   	
Limiting the number of products on sale 
 (C)   	
Implementing a content delivery network (CDN) 
 (D)   	
Conducting a yearly security audit 
Explanation 71. Correct Answer: C. Implementing a content 
delivery network (CDN). CDNs distribute the traffic load 
among multiple servers, often geographically dispersed. This 
not only speeds up content delivery to users but also helps in 
handling traffic surges, ensuring the system remains responsive 
during high-demand periods such as Black Friday sales. 
Option A is incorrect. Increasing password complexity can 
enhance security but does not directly impact system 
responsiveness during high traffic periods. 
Option B is incorrect. Limiting the number of products on sale 
may reduce server load, but it might also decrease potential 
revenue and is not a direct method for improving system 
responsiveness. 
Option D is incorrect. While yearly security audits are 
essential for identifying vulnerabilities, they don’t directly 
address system responsiveness during high traffic periods. 
	
 
883

Question 72. Alice wants to access a restricted online portal. 
The portal asks her to enter a unique username and a secret 
passphrase only she should know. This process helps the system 
ensure that Alice is who she claims to be. What security concept 
is the portal employing? 
 (A)   	
Authorization 
 (B)   	
Accounting 
 (C)   	
Multifactor authentication 
 (D)   	
Authentication 
Explanation 72. Correct Answer: D. Authentication. 
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, 
system, or application. In the described scenario, Alice is 
proving her identity to the system by providing a unique 
username and a passphrase, which are credentials that 
supposedly only she possesses. 
Option A is incorrect. Authorization determines what actions, 
resources, or services a verified identity is allowed to access or 
perform. It does not deal with verifying the identity itself. 
Option B is incorrect. Accounting involves tracking user 
activities and recording them for audit purposes. It does not 
directly verify a user’s identity. 
Option C is incorrect. Multifactor authentication requires two 
or more methods of verification from different categories of 
credentials. The scenario only mentioned a username and 
passphrase, which is a single-factor authentication method. 
	
 
884

Question 73. During a routine check, the IT department 
discovered that several employees had left their computers on 
and unattended during lunch break. Which operational security 
control can help mitigate the risk associated with this behavior? 
(A)       Implementing biometric authentication 
(B)       Enforcing a strict password policy 
(C)       Deploying an automatic screen lock after inactivity 
(D)       Implementing a secure coding practice 
Explanation 73. Correct Answer: C. Deploying an automatic 
screen lock after inactivity. Deploying an automatic screen 
lock after a certain period of inactivity is an operational control. 
It ensures that unattended devices are protected from 
unauthorized access, thereby mitigating risks associated with 
employees leaving their computers on and unattended. 
Option A is incorrect. Implementing biometric authentication 
is a technical control. While it enhances security at the point of 
access, it doesn’t ensure that active sessions on unattended 
devices are secured against unauthorized access. 
Option B is incorrect. Enforcing a strict password policy is a 
managerial control that dictates the creation and use of strong 
passwords. While it enhances access security, it doesn’t secure 
active sessions on unattended devices. 
Option D is incorrect. Implementing a secure coding practice 
is a technical and sometimes managerial control. It ensures 
software is written to prevent vulnerabilities but doesn’t directly 
address the risk of unattended computers. 
	
 
885

Question 74. A retail company recently suffered a breach where 
attackers encrypted all point-of-sale systems, rendering them 
unusable. A ransom note was then received, demanding 
payment in cryptocurrency to decrypt the systems. What 
motivation is most evident behind this attack? 
 (A)   	
Protesting against the company's environmental 
policies 
 (B)   	
Financial gain through ransom 
 (C)   	
Espionage to understand the company's supply chain 
 (D)   	
Seeking a reputation boost by showing off technical 
skills 
Explanation 74. Correct Answer: B. Financial gain through 
ransom. The attackers encrypted critical systems and then 
demanded a ransom to decrypt them. The primary motive in 
such ransomware attacks is to achieve financial gain by 
compelling the victim to pay to regain access to their systems. 
Option A is incorrect. There’s no mention or indication that the 
attackers were motivated by the company’s environmental or 
any other policies. 
Option C is incorrect. There’s no evidence suggesting the 
attackers were interested in the company’s supply chain or any 
other internal information. Their focus was on encryption and 
ransom. 
Option D is incorrect. While demonstrating technical skills 
might be a byproduct of the attack, the direct demand for 
payment indicates that financial gain, not notoriety, is the 
primary motive. 
	
 
886

Question 75. In an effort to minimize data breaches from 
malware, a company is deciding on a control to prevent 
malicious software from being executed on company devices. 
Which of the following would be the BEST preventive control? 
 (A)   	
Deploying a Network Intrusion Detection System 
(NIDS) 
 (B)   	
Regularly backing up critical data 
 (C)   	
Installing an antivirus software with real-time 
scanning 
 (D)   	
Performing a forensic analysis after a security 
incident 
Explanation 75. Correct Answer: C. Two-factor 
authentication. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security 
process in which users provide two different authentication 
factors to verify their identity. In this scenario, Bob is providing 
something he knows (username and password) and also 
answering a personal security question, which is another form 
of “something he knows.” 
Option A is incorrect. Biometric authentication involves using 
unique physical or behavioral attributes of a person for 
verification, such as fingerprints or facial patterns. The scenario 
doesn’t mention any biometric data. 
Option B is incorrect. Token-based authentication typically 
involves using a hardware or software token that generates a 
time-sensitive code. This was not described in the scenario. 
Option D is incorrect. Single sign-on (SSO) allows a user to 
log in once and gain access to multiple systems without being 
	
 
887

prompted to log in again for each system. The scenario 
describes a two-factor authentication process, not SSO. 
Question 76. After a recent service outage, a hospital’s IT team 
is reviewing the availability of its patient record system. They 
want to ensure the system remains operational, even in the event 
of hardware failures. Which of the following considerations is 
MOST relevant to this requirement? 
 (A)   	
Implementing database mirroring 
 (B)   	
Regularly updating the system's antivirus definitions 
 (C)   	
Using strong encryption for data at rest 
 (D)   	
Conducting penetration testing on the system 
Explanation 76. Correct Answer: A. Implementing database 
mirroring. Database mirroring is a solution for increasing the 
availability of a SQL Server database. Mirroring is implemented 
on a per-database basis and works only with databases that use 
the full recovery model. This ensures that in the event of a 
hardware failure, there’s a mirrored copy of the data available. 
Option B is incorrect. While updating antivirus definitions is 
crucial for preventing malware infections, it is not directly 
related to ensuring high availability in the face of hardware 
failures. 
Option C is incorrect. Encryption is vital for data security but 
doesn’t directly address the high availability needs of a system. 
Option D is incorrect. Penetration testing identifies 
vulnerabilities in the system but doesn’t provide a solution for 
high availability in case of hardware failures. 
	
 
888

Question 77. An environmental NGO’s website was hacked and 
replaced with a message decrying their recent campaign against 
deforestation, claiming they are spreading misinformation. The 
website was left with a manifesto promoting responsible 
forestry and sustainable logging practices. Which type of threat 
actor is MOST likely behind this incident? 
 (A)   	
Ransomware gang 
 (B)   	
Organized crime syndicate 
 (C)   	
Hacktivist 
 (D)   	
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) 
Explanation 77. Correct Answer: C. Hacktivist. The attack 
seems to be motivated by ideological differences regarding 
deforestation and sustainable logging. Hacktivists typically 
conduct cyber actions to make political or social statements. 
The replacement of the NGO’s website with a manifesto 
supports the idea that this is an ideologically motivated attack, 
typical of hacktivists. 
Option A is incorrect. Ransomware gangs primarily focus on 
encrypting data and demanding payment for its release. There is 
no mention of a ransom or encrypted data in the described 
scenario. 
Option B is incorrect. Organized crime syndicates are usually 
motivated by financial gains. The attack on the NGO’s website 
seems to be ideologically driven, not profit-driven. 
Option D is incorrect. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are 
highly organized, often state-sponsored groups that conduct 
prolonged cyber-espionage campaigns. Their motivations are 
	
 
889

typically strategic, political, or espionage-driven. The described 
attack doesn’t fit the profile of an APT operation. 
Question 78. A government agency experienced a cyber 
incident where its communication platforms were breached. The 
intruders were not interested in extracting sensitive data or 
causing disruptions but were observed to be silently monitoring 
diplomatic communications for an extended period. What was 
the likely motivation of the attackers? 
 (A)   	
To gain financial benefits from insider trading 
 (B)   	
Espionage to understand and anticipate diplomatic 
moves 
 (C)   	
Disgruntlement of an internal employee 
 (D)   	
An attempt to expand their cybercriminal network 
Explanation 78. Correct Answer: B. Espionage to 
understand and anticipate diplomatic moves. Silently 
monitoring diplomatic communications without exfiltrating data 
or causing disruptions indicates a motivation to understand, 
anticipate, and potentially manipulate governmental or 
diplomatic actions. This is a classic example of espionage. 
Option A is incorrect. While sensitive information might 
indeed be valuable for insider trading, the focus on diplomatic 
communications suggests a broader strategic intent rather than 
just financial gain. 
Option C is incorrect. A disgruntled employee might engage in 
sabotage or data leakage, but silently monitoring diplomatic 
communications indicates a higher level of strategy and 
sophistication usually beyond personal vendettas. 
	
 
890

Option D is incorrect. The attackers’ actions were specific to 
monitoring diplomatic channels and did not indicate an attempt 
to recruit more systems or individuals into a criminal network. 
Question 79. During a company’s onboarding process, new 
employees are required to read and acknowledge understanding 
of various company policies. The HR department wants to 
ensure that employees are aware of their responsibilities when it 
comes to the use of company devices and internet resources. 
Which policy should be included in the onboarding packet to 
address this? 
 (A)   	
Password Complexity Policy 
 (B)   	
Data Classification Policy 
 (C)   	
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) 
 (D)   	
Vendor Management Policy 
Explanation 79. Correct Answer: C. Acceptable Use Policy 
(AUP). The Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) outlines the do’s and 
don’ts for employees regarding the use of company devices, 
networks, and other IT resources. Including this in the 
onboarding packet will ensure that new hires are aware of their 
responsibilities. 
Option A is incorrect. While important, the Password 
Complexity Policy primarily deals with the requirements for 
creating and managing passwords, not the overall acceptable 
use of IT resources. 
Option B is incorrect. A Data Classification Policy focuses on 
the categorization of data based on its sensitivity. It doesn’t 
provide guidelines on the acceptable use of IT resources. 
	
 
891

Option D is incorrect. The Vendor Management Policy 
governs the relationship and security expectations between the 
company and its vendors, not the acceptable use of company IT 
resources by employees. 
Question 80. WhiteCape Healthcare, an international healthcare 
provider, has a large patient database that includes many EU 
citizens. They’re about to implement a new system to improve 
data access for physicians. Which of the following regulatory 
requirements should they pay particular attention to when 
granting physicians access to EU patient data? 
(A)       Ensure data is only accessed for tax reporting purposes 
(B)       Acquire explicit consent from patients before sharing 
data 
(C)       Encrypt all data using a proprietary algorithm 
(D)       Store data in a physical server located within the EU 
Explanation 80. Correct Answer: B. Acquire explicit consent 
from patients before sharing data. Under the GDPR, explicit 
consent from individuals is required before processing or 
sharing their personal data. This means that EU citizens should 
have given their clear permission for their data to be accessed 
and shared. 
Option A is incorrect. Accessing data for tax reporting 
purposes is not directly related to the GDPR’s requirement for 
handling EU citizens’ personal healthcare data. 
Option C is incorrect. While encryption is a good practice for 
data protection, GDPR does not mandate using a proprietary 
	
 
892

algorithm. Moreover, encryption alone doesn’t address the 
consent requirement. 
Option D is incorrect. While the GDPR does have provisions 
about data transfer outside the EU, simply storing data in a 
physical server within the EU does not bypass the need for 
explicit patient consent when sharing their data. 
Question 81. An enterprise is deploying IoT-based security 
cameras across multiple office locations. As the lead security 
professional, what recommendation would you prioritize to 
establish a secure baseline for these devices? 
 (A)   	
Setting the devices to public mode so all employees 
can access the feed for transparency 
 (B)   	
Regularly updating the device firmware to patch 
known vulnerabilities 
 (C)   	
Enabling Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) to ensure 
easy connectivity for all devices on the network 
 (D)   	
Using the same password for all cameras for ease of 
management 
Explanation 81. Correct Answer: B. Regularly updating the 
device firmware to patch known vulnerabilities. Regular 
firmware updates ensure that the IoT devices are protected 
against identified vulnerabilities, helping maintain their security 
posture. 
Option A is incorrect. Setting devices to a public mode can 
lead to potential breaches of privacy and unauthorized access. 
	
 
893

Option C is incorrect. UPnP can introduce vulnerabilities by 
automatically opening ports and allowing devices to set their 
configurations, potentially leading to security risks. 
Option D is incorrect. Using the same password for all devices 
creates a single point of failure. If one device’s password is 
compromised, all devices become vulnerable. 
Question 82. A robotics company is developing an autonomous 
vehicle that relies on a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) to 
manage its operations. The development team wants to ensure 
that the vehicle’s RTOS has a solid security posture. What 
should the team prioritize when establishing a secure baseline 
for this RTOS? 
 (A)   	
Installing a robust antivirus software 
 (B)   	
Enabling all features for maximum functionality 
 (C)   	
Regularly backing up the RTOS data to the cloud 
 (D)   	
Minimizing the number of services and open ports 
Explanation 82. Correct Answer: D. Minimizing the number 
of services and open ports. Reducing the number of services 
and open ports reduces the attack surface on the RTOS, making 
it more challenging for attackers to find vulnerabilities. 
Option A is incorrect. While antivirus software is essential for 
many systems, an RTOS, especially one for an autonomous 
vehicle, would prioritize reducing the attack surface and 
ensuring real-time performance rather than relying on 
traditional antivirus solutions. 
	
 
894

Option B is incorrect. Enabling all features may introduce 
unnecessary vulnerabilities. It’s best to enable only required 
functionalities to maintain security. 
Option C is incorrect. While backups are crucial for data 
integrity and recovery, the primary concern for an RTOS, 
especially in autonomous vehicles, would be real-time 
performance and reducing potential vulnerabilities. 
Question 83. After a recent incident of vandalism, a corporate 
building is considering implementing security controls that 
would dissuade potential perpetrators. Which of the following 
would serve BEST as a deterrent control? 
 (A)   	
Encrypting all stored data 
 (B)   	
Installing biometric access controls on all entrances 
 (C)   	
Implementing regular data backups 
 (D)   	
Placing visible security signage indicating 24/7 
surveillance 
Explanation 83. Correct Answer: D. Placing visible security 
signage indicating 24/7 surveillance. Visible security signage 
serves as a deterrent control as it discourages potential 
perpetrators by signaling the risk of detection and 
consequences, even if actual surveillance might not be active at 
all times. 
Option A is incorrect. Encrypting all stored data is a preventive 
control that ensures unauthorized individuals cannot access or 
understand the encrypted information. It doesn’t deter acts of 
physical vandalism. 
	
 
895

Option B is incorrect. Installing biometric access controls is a 
preventive control that restricts physical access based on unique 
biological attributes. While it prevents unauthorized access, it 
doesn’t act as a visible deterrent to vandalism or other potential 
threats. 
Option C is incorrect. Implementing regular data backups is a 
corrective control designed to restore data after a security 
incident. It doesn’t deter potential threats. 
Question 84. The finance department of a global corporation 
found a series of unauthorized transactions originating from an 
employee’s workstation. Investigations revealed that the 
employee had been bypassing company policies to make 
unauthorized investments using company funds. Based on the 
attributes of the actor, how can this threat actor be best 
categorized? 
 (A)   	
External actor leveraging malware 
 (B)   	
External actor exploiting vulnerabilities 
 (C)   	
Internal actor with direct access 
 (D)   	
Internal actor with indirect access 
Explanation 84. Correct Answer: C. Internal actor with 
direct access. The threat originated from an employee’s 
workstation within the organization, making it an internal threat. 
Since the employee used their own workstation and credentials 
to make unauthorized transactions, they had direct access, 
categorizing them as an internal actor with direct access. 
Option A is incorrect. There’s no mention of malware being 
used in this scenario, and the unauthorized transactions came 
	
 
896

from an employee’s workstation, indicating an internal rather 
than external threat. 
Option B is incorrect. The scenario doesn’t describe an 
external actor exploiting vulnerabilities. Instead, it describes an 
employee making unauthorized transactions from within the 
organization. 
Option D is incorrect. The employee in this scenario had direct 
access to the company’s resources, as they used their own 
workstation and credentials. Thus, they aren’t categorized as 
having indirect access. 
Question 85. After a series of cyberattacks, BetaTech, a 
financial institution, decided to standardize the configurations 
across its entire server fleet. They’ve established a secure 
baseline configuration for their servers. What should be the 
NEXT step in ensuring the servers conform to this new 
baseline? 
 (A)  	
 Frequently conduct vulnerability scanning on all 
servers 
 (B)   	
Introduce biometric authentication for server access 
 (C)   	
Deploy the secure baseline across all servers 
 (D)   	
Monitor network traffic to detect anomalies 
Explanation 85. Correct Answer: C. Deploy the secure 
baseline across all servers. After establishing a secure 
baseline, the immediate next step is to deploy or apply this 
baseline to the servers. This ensures that all servers start from a 
standardized and secure configuration. 
	
 
897

Option A is incorrect. While vulnerability scanning is crucial, 
it is more of a continuous process to identify potential 
vulnerabilities and doesn’t directly apply the secure baseline to 
the servers. 
Option B is incorrect. Biometric authentication, though a 
valuable security measure, does not address the deployment of 
the established secure baseline on servers. 
Option D is incorrect. Monitoring network traffic is essential 
for detecting potential threats, but it does not directly ensure the 
deployment of the secure baseline on servers. 
Question 86. ClearView Industries wants to give their 
employees the flexibility to choose their own devices for work 
while retaining control over the device configurations and 
applications. Which deployment model would be the MOST 
appropriate for ClearView’s objectives? 
 (A)   	
Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) 
 (B)   	
Choose Your Own Device (CYOD) 
 (C)   	
Corporate-owned, Personally Enabled (COPE) 
 (D)   	
Fixed Device Deployment (FDD) 
Explanation 86. Correct Answer: B. Choose Your Own 
Device (CYOD). In the CYOD model, employees are allowed 
to choose a device from a list of approved devices. The 
organization retains control over the device configurations and 
applications, ensuring a blend of user preference and corporate 
security. 
	
 
898

Option A is incorrect. BYOD allows employees to bring their 
personal devices to work, which means the organization has less 
control over the configurations and applications. 
Option C is incorrect. While COPE provides devices owned 
by the corporation and allows personal use, it does not 
necessarily offer employees the choice of which device they get. 
Option D is incorrect. Fixed Device Deployment (FDD) is not 
a standard deployment model in the context of mobile solutions, 
and it does not reflect the flexibility of device choice. 
Question 87. XYZ Company uses MDM to manage company-
owned and employee-owned mobile devices. An employee 
reported losing their personal phone over the weekend. What 
MDM feature should the IT department use to ensure that 
sensitive company data on the lost phone isn’t accessed? 
 (A)   	
Monitor the device's location 
 (B)   	
Force update the device's apps 
 (C)   	
Remote wipe the device 
 (D)   	
Change the user's email password 
Explanation 87. Correct Answer: C. Remote wipe the 
device. Using the remote wipe feature, the IT department can 
erase all data, including company data, from the lost device, 
ensuring that sensitive information doesn’t fall into the wrong 
hands. 
Option A is incorrect. Monitoring the device’s location might 
help in finding it but doesn’t prevent unauthorized access to the 
data on the device. 
	
 
899

Option B is incorrect. Force updating the device’s apps might 
address vulnerabilities in the apps but doesn’t directly protect 
the company data on the device. 
Option D is incorrect. Changing the user’s email password can 
prevent unauthorized access to the user’s email, but it doesn’t 
secure other sensitive company data that might be on the device. 
Question 88. During a major sports event, a broadcasting 
company’s streaming services were taken offline by a sudden 
surge in traffic. The attack continued for the duration of the 
event and then subsided. What was the most probable 
motivation behind this attack? 
(A)       Espionage to intercept sensitive communications 
(B)       To cause a service disruption during the sports event 
(C)       Data exfiltration for future ransom demands 
(D)       To gain unauthorized access and implant malware 
Explanation 88. Correct Answer: B. To cause a service 
disruption during the sports event. The surge in traffic 
specifically timed with the sports event and its subsequent 
subsiding after the event indicates a targeted intention to disrupt 
the service during the sports event. 
Option A is incorrect. There is no indication in the scenario 
that the attacker was interested in intercepting communications, 
especially since the target was a broadcasting company and not 
a diplomatic or governmental agency. 
	
 
900

Option C is incorrect. The scenario does not mention any 
exfiltration of data or follow-up ransom demands. The focus of 
the attacker was on disrupting the streaming service. 
Option D is incorrect. Although taking services offline can 
sometimes be a cover for more malicious activities, there’s no 
evidence in this scenario to suggest that malware was implanted 
or unauthorized access was achieved. 
Question 89. A software development company has decided to 
host their applications in a multi-cloud environment. Before 
deploying, they are looking to enhance the security of their 
cloud-based resources. Which of the following is the BEST 
practice for hardening their cloud infrastructure? 
 (A)   	
Ensure that all cloud storage buckets or containers are 
publicly accessible for easier data sharing 
 (B)   	
Apply consistent security configurations and 
policies across all cloud providers 
 (C)   	
Use the same SSH key pairs across all cloud instances 
for uniformity 
 (D)   	
Limit the use of Identity and Access Management 
(IAM) roles to senior staff only 
Explanation 89. Correct Answer: B. Apply consistent 
security configurations and policies across all cloud 
providers. Maintaining consistent security configurations and 
policies across all cloud providers ensures that there are no 
weak links in the multi-cloud setup and reduces the complexity 
of managing multiple sets of policies. 
	
 
901

Option A is incorrect. Making all cloud storage buckets or 
containers publicly accessible can expose sensitive data and is a 
common misconfiguration that leads to data breaches. 
Option C is incorrect. Using the same SSH key pairs across all 
instances can be risky. If an attacker obtains the SSH key, they 
can gain unauthorized access to all instances that use that key. 
Option D is incorrect. While it’s important to limit access 
based on the principle of least privilege, IAM roles should be 
appropriately assigned to staff based on their responsibilities 
and not just their seniority. This ensures that users have the 
necessary permissions to do their jobs without unnecessary 
access to sensitive resources. 
Question 90. RedFlare Solutions, a financial firm, is storing 
sensitive client data in a database. The Chief Information 
Security Officer (CISO) insists that the data should be 
unreadable even if it’s intercepted during transmission or if the 
storage is compromised. Which encryption standard would best 
serve this requirement? 
(A)       Symmetric encryption using a shared key 
(B)       Hashing the data with a one-way function 
(C)       Encrypting the entire database using transparent 
data encryption 
(D)       Storing the data in a proprietary format 
Explanation 90. Correct Answer: C. Encrypting the entire 
database using transparent data encryption. Transparent data 
encryption (TDE) encrypts the entire database, ensuring that 
data remains encrypted both at rest and during transmission. It 
	
 
902

renders the data unreadable without the appropriate encryption 
keys. 
Option A is incorrect. Symmetric encryption can make data 
unreadable, but it may pose challenges in key management and 
distribution, especially if the key is compromised. 
Option B is incorrect. Hashing data makes it unreadable, but 
it’s a one-way function. Once data is hashed, it cannot be 
retrieved or decrypted, making it unsuitable for encrypting 
stored data that needs to be accessed and read. 
Option D is incorrect. Simply storing data in a proprietary 
format doesn’t mean it’s encrypted or unreadable. If someone 
understands or reverse engineers the format, the data can be 
read. 
Question 91. XYZ Corporation is planning to deploy a new 
wireless infrastructure in their newly acquired office building. 
The IT manager wants to ensure optimal wireless coverage 
throughout the premises. Which of the following should the IT 
team prioritize before installing the wireless access points? 
 (A)   	
Purchase the most expensive wireless access points to 
ensure maximum range 
 (B)   	
Conduct a site survey to determine the best 
locations for access points 
 (C)   	
Deploy all access points near windows to enhance 
signal strength 
 (D)   	
Ensure all users have 5GHz capable devices 
	
 
903

Explanation 91. Correct Answer: B. Conduct a site survey to 
determine the best locations for access points. A site survey 
will help identify the optimal placements for access points to 
achieve consistent and robust wireless coverage across the 
entire premises. 
Option A is incorrect. While quality equipment is essential, the 
costliest access points might not always guarantee the best 
results. Placement and environment play crucial roles in 
wireless performance. 
Option C is incorrect. Deploying access points near windows 
can cause signal leakage, potentially making the signal available 
outside the intended area and presenting a security risk. 
Option D is incorrect. While ensuring users have 5GHz 
capable devices is a good practice, it doesn’t relate directly to 
the optimal installation of wireless access points. 
Question 92. A client disputes having signed a digital contract. 
The service provider needs to prove that the signature was 
indeed from the client and hasn’t been tampered with. Which of 
the following security concepts is the service provider relying 
on? 
 (A)   	
Authentication 
 (B)   	
Confidentiality 
 (C)   	
Non-repudiation 
 (D)   	
Access Control 
Explanation 92. Correct Answer: C. Non-repudiation. Non-
repudiation ensures that a party in a dispute cannot deny the 
	
 
904

authenticity of their actions. In this scenario, it would provide 
evidence that the client did sign the contract and that it hasn’t 
been tampered with post-signature. 
Option A is incorrect. Authentication confirms the identity of a 
user or system. While it plays a part in ensuring that the right 
person is accessing the system, it doesn’t directly provide 
evidence about the actions post-authentication, like signing a 
contract. 
Option B is incorrect. Confidentiality ensures that information 
is only accessible to those with the appropriate permissions. It 
doesn’t provide evidence of an action being taken by a specific 
entity. 
Option D is incorrect. Access Control determines who or what 
can view or use resources in a computing environment. It 
doesn’t ensure the validity of actions taken within the system. 
Question 93. A software company recently discovered a 
vulnerability in its popular application, which allowed 
unauthorized access to users’ data. Before the company could 
release a patch, a group of hackers exploited the vulnerability 
but only to notify the users about it. They did not misuse any 
data. What is the most probable motivation behind this group’s 
action? 
 (A)   	
Financial gain by selling the data 
 (B)   	
Political beliefs against the software company's 
operations 
 (C)   	
Ethical concerns about user privacy and security 
 (D)   	
Desire to disrupt the software company's services 
	
 
905

Explanation 93. Correct Answer: C. Ethical concerns about 
user privacy and security. The hackers did not misuse the data 
but instead chose to inform the users about the vulnerability, 
suggesting their motivation was based on ethical considerations 
to ensure users are aware of potential threats to their privacy. 
Option A is incorrect. The hackers did not sell or misuse the 
data, which means financial gain wasn’t their primary objective. 
Option B is incorrect. There’s no indication that the hackers’ 
actions were driven by political beliefs against the software 
company. 
Option D is incorrect. While the hackers did exploit a 
vulnerability, they did not aim to disrupt the company’s services 
but to inform users about the vulnerability. 
Question 94. A healthcare institution suffered a breach where 
medical records of high-profile patients were extracted. The 
data was not sold or publicly disclosed. Instead, certain 
individuals were approached with their personal health 
information and were extorted for money. What is the primary 
motivation behind this cyber attack? 
(A)       Political activism to expose vulnerabilities in healthcare 
(B)       Personal animosity targeting the healthcare institution 
(C)       Financial gain through targeted extortion 
(D)       Spreading malware and expanding the botnet 
Explanation 94. Correct Answer: C. Financial gain through 
targeted extortion. Approaching specific individuals with their 
	
 
906

personal health data for the purpose of extortion indicates a 
clear motivation of financial gain. 
Option A is incorrect. While political activists might expose 
vulnerabilities in sectors like healthcare, they generally do so to 
raise awareness rather than for personal financial gain. 
Option B is incorrect. There’s no evidence from the given 
scenario to suggest that the attack was fueled by personal 
animosity towards the institution. 
Option D is incorrect. The attackers’ actions did not revolve 
around spreading malware or increasing a botnet’s size but 
rather focused on individual extortion based on exfiltrated data. 
Question 95. A company wants to ensure that security incidents 
are detected and addressed as quickly as possible by on-duty 
personnel. Which of the following operational security controls 
would be BEST to implement for this purpose? 
 (A)   	
Deploying a Network Intrusion Prevention System 
(NIPS) 
 (B)   	
Establishing a 24/7 Security Operations Center 
(SOC) 
 (C)   	
Creating a company-wide security policy 
 (D)   	
Implementing end-to-end data encryption 
Explanation 95. Correct Answer: B. Establishing a 24/7 
Security Operations Center (SOC). A Security Operations 
Center (SOC) is an operational control that provides real-time 
monitoring, detection, and response to security incidents. With a 
	
 
907

24/7 SOC, the company ensures that there is always personnel 
available to handle security incidents as they occur. 
Option A is incorrect. Deploying a Network Intrusion 
Prevention System (NIPS) is a technical control. While it can 
prevent unauthorized activities on the network, it does not 
ensure that there is personnel available around the clock to 
address incidents. 
Option C is incorrect. Creating a company-wide security 
policy is a managerial control. It sets the guidelines and 
procedures for security but does not ensure continuous 
monitoring and immediate response to incidents. 
Option D is incorrect. Implementing end-to-end data 
encryption is a technical control that ensures data 
confidentiality. While it protects data, it does not ensure that 
incidents are detected and addressed by on-duty personnel in 
real-time. 
Question 96. As part of improving their security posture, 
TechHive Inc. decided to review their existing password 
policies. The current policy requires employees to use at least 
one uppercase letter, one number, and one special character. 
However, they found that users mostly only make minimal 
changes to their passwords during resets. Which standard 
should be integrated into their policy to ensure passwords are 
more complex and unique over time? 
 (A)   	
Password history retention 
 (B)   	
Password expiration period 
	
 
908

 (C)   	
Account lockout duration 
 (D)   	
Maximum password age 
Explanation 96. Correct Answer: A. Password history 
retention. Password history retention ensures that users cannot 
reuse a certain number of previous passwords, forcing them to 
come up with unique passwords rather than making only minor 
changes to their current ones. 
Option B is incorrect. The password expiration period dictates 
how long a password is valid before prompting the user for a 
change. While it can make users change passwords frequently, it 
doesn’t prevent them from making minimal changes. 
Option C is incorrect. Account lockout duration specifies the 
time an account remains locked after a predefined number of 
incorrect login attempts. It doesn’t ensure password complexity 
or uniqueness over time. 
Option D is incorrect. Maximum password age defines how 
long a password can be used before it must be changed. Like 
Option B, it doesn’t prevent users from making minimal 
changes to their passwords. 
Question 97. A medium-sized enterprise is concerned about the 
security of its office workstations after a series of malware 
infections. As a security analyst, which of the following 
recommendations would BEST improve the security baseline of 
the workstations? 
 (A) 	  Install multiple antivirus solutions to ensure maximum 
detection 
	
 
909

 (B)   	
Set up screensavers with cyber hygiene tips to educate 
users 
 (C)   	
Disable unnecessary services and ports on the 
workstations 
 (D)   	
Frequently change the desktop wallpaper to prevent 
monotony 
Explanation 97. Correct Answer: C. Disable unnecessary 
services and ports on the workstations. By disabling 
unnecessary services and ports, you reduce the number of 
potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities, thus improving the 
security baseline of the workstations. 
Option A is incorrect. Installing multiple antivirus solutions 
can lead to conflicts and may degrade system performance. It’s 
better to have one robust, updated antivirus solution. 
Option B is incorrect. While cyber hygiene tips can be 
informative, they don’t directly contribute to the technical 
security baseline of a workstation. 
Option D is incorrect. Changing the desktop wallpaper does 
nothing for security. Its primary purpose is aesthetics. 
Question 98. After a significant merger between two large 
corporations, a comprehensive risk assessment was conducted 
to identify potential security gaps within the combined 
infrastructure. This assessment was exclusive to the merger and 
was not planned to be repeated in the future. What type of risk 
assessment was this? 
 (A)   	
Recurring 
	
 
910

 (B)   	
Continuous 
 (C)   	
One-time 
 (D)   	
Dynamic 
Explanation 98. Correct Answer: C. One-time. A one-time 
risk assessment is a unique assessment carried out for a specific 
purpose or event, such as a merger, and is not repeated regularly 
like other types of assessments. 
Option A is incorrect. Recurring risk assessments are 
conducted at regular intervals, such as annually or biannually. 
Option B is incorrect. Continuous risk assessments involve 
ongoing monitoring of risks and do not refer to a single, specific 
assessment. 
Option D is incorrect. Dynamic assessments continuously 
adapt to changing environments or factors, but this term does 
not denote a single, specific assessment. 
Question 99. XYZ Corporation recently faced a major power 
outage that affected their primary data center. During the 
incident, it was found that there was no clear guidance on the 
steps to maintain or quickly restore business operations. To 
address this, which of the following policies should XYZ 
Corporation prioritize implementing? 
 (A)   	
Data Classification Policy 
 (B)   	
Business Continuity Policy 
 (C)   	
Acceptable Use Policy 
 (D)   	
Network Segmentation Strategy 
	
 
911

Explanation 99. Correct Answer: B. Business Continuity 
Policy. A Business Continuity Policy outlines the processes and 
procedures an organization should follow to ensure that 
essential functions can continue during and after a disaster. It 
provides a roadmap for maintaining and quickly restoring 
business operations. 
Option A is incorrect. The Data Classification Policy is 
concerned with categorizing data based on its sensitivity but 
doesn’t address continuity of business operations during 
disruptions. 
Option C is incorrect. The Acceptable Use Policy specifies 
how the organization’s IT resources and networks can be used 
by employees. It doesn’t provide guidance on restoring business 
operations during a disaster. 
Option D is incorrect. While Network Segmentation Strategy 
is crucial for security, dividing the network into segments does 
not specifically address business continuity during major 
disruptions. 
Question 100. CyberFleet Inc., a software development 
company, has just heard of a newly discovered vulnerability in a 
third-party library they heavily rely upon. The security team 
quickly gathers to understand and analyze the potential risks 
associated with this vulnerability. This spontaneous assessment 
is best described as: 
 (A)   	
Routine 
 (B)   	
Ad hoc 
	
 
912

 (C)   	
Scheduled 
 (D)   	
Benchmark 
Explanation 100. Correct Answer: B. Ad hoc. An ad hoc risk 
assessment is done in response to a specific event or situation 
and is not planned in advance. 
Option A is incorrect. Routine assessments, similar to periodic 
ones, are performed at regular intervals and are not typically in 
response to sudden events. 
Option C is incorrect. Scheduled risk assessments are planned 
and occur at predetermined times or intervals. 
Option D is incorrect. Benchmark assessments are evaluations 
that compare an organization’s processes or performance 
against a set standard or best practices in the industry.

Question 101. XYZ Corp is implementing a new vulnerability 
scanning solution. The security team wants a solution that does 
not require any software to be installed on the target machines 
but can still identify vulnerabilities. Which type of vulnerability 
scanning solution should they choose? 
 (A)   	
Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) 
 (B)   	
Agentless Vulnerability Scanner 
	
 
950

 (C)   	
Client-based Vulnerability Scanner 
 (D)   	
Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) 
Explanation 101. Correct Answer: B. Agentless 
Vulnerability Scanner. An agentless vulnerability scanner does 
not require any software (agent) to be installed on the target 
systems. Instead, it remotely scans the systems and identifies 
vulnerabilities by checking against a database of known 
vulnerabilities. 
Option A is incorrect. Host-based Intrusion Detection System 
(HIDS) monitors the internal workings of a computing system, 
not for vulnerabilities but for signs of unauthorized or malicious 
activity. 
Option C is incorrect. Client-based Vulnerability Scanner 
requires an agent or software component to be installed on the 
target system to perform the vulnerability assessment. 
Option D is incorrect. Host-based Intrusion Prevention System 
(HIPS) is designed to detect and prevent malicious activity on a 
particular device, not to scan for vulnerabilities. 
Question 102. FinCorp, a financial institution, has recently 
adopted a new security framework. In this framework, every 
device and user inside the organization’s network is treated as if 
they were outside the perimeter, necessitating rigorous 
verification processes even for internal requests. Which security 
paradigm has FinCorp implemented? 
 (A)   	
Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) 
 (B)   	
Network Segmentation 
	
 
951

 (C)   	
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
 (D)   	
Zero Trust 
Explanation 102.  Correct Answer: D. Zero Trust. Zero Trust 
is a security model that treats every access request with 
skepticism, regardless of its origin, be it from within or outside 
the organization’s traditional perimeter. It requires rigorous 
verification processes for every interaction. 
Option A is incorrect. A Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is a 
physical or logical subnetwork that exposes an organization’s 
external-facing services to a larger, untrusted network, usually 
the internet. 
Option B is incorrect. Network Segmentation divides a 
network into multiple segments or subnets, allowing 
administrators to control the flow of traffic between them. It 
does not inherently distrust all traffic like Zero Trust. 
Option C is incorrect. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a 
device or software application that monitors a network or 
systems for malicious activity or policy violations. It doesn’t 
define how trust is managed across interactions. 
Question 103. An art gallery wants to deploy a security solution 
to detect movement in an open courtyard that features several 
sculptures. This space has varying temperature conditions, 
which might cause false alarms in some motion detection 
technologies. Which type of sensor would be MOST 
appropriate to ensure consistent motion detection in such 
conditions? 
	
 
952

 (A)  	
 Thermal imaging sensors 
 (B)   	
Pressure-sensitive mats 
 (C)   	
Ultrasonic detectors 
 (D)   	
Microwave motion detectors 
Explanation 103. Correct Answer: D. Microwave motion 
detectors. Microwave motion detectors are suitable for open 
areas and are less affected by temperature changes. They emit 
microwave beams to create an invisible detection zone and can 
consistently detect motion when an object interrupts this zone, 
irrespective of the ambient temperature. 
Option A is incorrect. Thermal imaging sensors detect 
variations in heat. While they can be effective, the varying 
temperature conditions in the courtyard may cause 
inconsistencies in detection. 
Option B is incorrect. Pressure-sensitive mats are designed to 
detect weight or pressure changes when stepped on. They would 
not be suitable for an open courtyard where movement needs to 
be detected across a larger area. 
Option C is incorrect. Ultrasonic detectors emit sound waves 
to detect motion. However, they might also be affected by 
external environmental factors and are not as suitable for open 
courtyards as microwave motion detectors. 
Question 104. SecureNet, a cybersecurity firm, is implementing 
an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for its enterprise client. 
Where should the IDS be placed for optimal detection of 
malicious activities? 
	
 
953

 (A)   	
Before the perimeter firewall to capture all inbound 
traffic 
 (B)   	
Between the perimeter firewall and the internal 
network to monitor the filtered traffic 
 (C)   	
Inside the DMZ to monitor only external service 
requests 
 (D)   	
Adjacent to each workstation for personalized 
security 
Explanation 104. Correct Answer: B. Between the perimeter 
firewall and the internal network to monitor the filtered 
traffic. By placing the IDS between the firewall and the internal 
network, it can monitor traffic that has passed through the 
firewall’s filters. This position provides a balance between 
capturing potential threats and reducing false positives from 
benign external traffic. 
Option A is incorrect. While placing the IDS before the 
firewall will capture all inbound traffic, it may result in a high 
number of false positives since a lot of benign traffic might 
trigger alarms. 
Option C is incorrect. Placing the IDS only in the DMZ would 
limit its visibility to only external service requests and not the 
overall internal traffic which might have potential threats. 
Option D is incorrect. While personal IDS on each workstation 
provides granular monitoring, it does not provide a holistic view 
of network activities and can be resource-intensive.

Question 105. AcmeBank recently performed a business impact 
analysis for its online banking system. The result indicated that 
the bank could tolerate a maximum downtime of 4 hours for the 
system before incurring significant financial losses and 
customer dissatisfaction. Which concept best describes this 4-
hour period? 
 (A)   	
Recovery Point Objective (RPO) 
 (B)   	
Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) 
 (C)   	
Recovery Time Objective (RTO) 
 (D)   	
Time To Restore (TTR) 
Explanation 105. Correct Answer: C. Recovery Time 
Objective (RTO). The Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the 
targeted duration of time within which a business process must 
be restored after a disruption in order to avoid unacceptable 
consequences. In this scenario, AcmeBank’s RTO for its online 
banking system is 4 hours. 
Option A is incorrect. Recovery Point Objective (RPO) 
describes the maximum age of files that an organization must 
recover from backup storage for normal operations to resume 
after a disaster. It doesn’t refer to the time duration. 
Option B is incorrect. Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) 
is the longest period of time that a business process can be 
down before causing irreparable harm to the business. While 
related, the question specifically describes the RTO. 
Option D is incorrect. Time To Restore (TTR) is often a metric 
to measure the time it takes to restore a particular process or 
system. However, the scenario directly describes an RTO.

Explanation 106. Correct Answer: C. Proxy server. A Proxy 
server serves as an intermediary between the user’s computer 
and the internet. It intercepts web requests and can provide 
functions such as filtering web content, caching web requests, 
and inspecting traffic for security reasons. 
Option A is incorrect. A Network Intrusion Detection System 
(IDS) monitors and detects malicious activities on a network but 
does not function as an intermediary for web requests. 
Option B is incorrect. A VPN Concentrator provides secure 
remote access to an organization’s network but doesn’t act as an 
intermediary for web browsing requests. 
Option D is incorrect. A Jump server is used for secure and 
auditable access to internal servers but isn’t designed for 
intercepting web traffic. 
Question 107. A user receives an SMS claiming to be from her 
bank, alerting her of unauthorized activity on her account. The 
	
 
956

message instructs the user to immediately click on a provided 
link and verify her account details. The user hasn’t noticed any 
irregularities with her bank account. Which type of attack is this 
SMS most likely part of? 
 (A)   	
Smishing 
 (B)   	
Vishing 
 (C) 	  Bluejacking 
 (D)   	
Bluesnarfing 
Explanation 107. Correct Answer: A. Smishing. Smishing is 
a type of phishing attack where malicious actors use SMS to 
deceive individuals into providing sensitive information, 
typically by impersonating trusted organizations or contacts. 
Option B is incorrect. Vishing refers to voice phishing, where 
attackers use voice calls instead of text or email to impersonate 
legitimate entities and scam victims. 
Option C is incorrect. Bluejacking involves sending 
unsolicited messages to Bluetooth-enabled devices. It doesn’t 
typically involve impersonating a legitimate entity for deceptive 
purposes. 
Option D is incorrect. Bluesnarfing is a type of unauthorized 
access to or theft of information from a Bluetooth device. It 
doesn’t involve deceptive SMS messages. 
Question 108. Jane, a security analyst, receives a report about 
network slowdowns happening at specific times of the day. 
After investigating, she discovers that a device is flooding the 
network with traffic, causing legitimate requests to be dropped. 
	
 
957

Which type of attack is this device likely performing? 
 (A)   	
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) 
 (B)   	
ARP poisoning 
 (C)   	
MAC flooding 
 (D)   	
DNS amplification 
Explanation 108. Correct Answer: C. MAC flooding. MAC 
flooding is an attack that aims to flood the switch’s MAC table 
with fake MAC addresses until the table overflows. Once it 
overflows, the switch acts as a hub broadcasting packets to all 
machines in the network. This can cause significant slowdowns 
and disruptions. 
Option A is incorrect. A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) 
attack uses multiple compromised devices to flood a target with 
traffic, usually to overwhelm it and take it offline. The scenario 
describes an internal network slowdown, not an external attack 
on services. 
Option B is incorrect. ARP poisoning is an attack where false 
ARP messages are sent over a local area network. It’s used to 
link an attacker’s MAC address with the IP address of another 
host. While it can cause disruptions, the primary intent is not to 
flood the network. 
Option D is incorrect. DNS amplification is a type of DDoS 
attack where an attacker uses publically-accessible DNS servers 
to flood a target system with DNS response traffic. This does 
not fit the internal network flooding described in the scenario.

Question 109. During a major international sporting event, a 
group of unidentified hackers simultaneously launched 
cyberattacks against multiple infrastructures in the host city, 
including transportation networks, power grids, and 
telecommunication systems. There was no ransom demand or 
any clear financial motive behind the attacks. What is the most 
probable motivation behind these actions? 
 (A)   	
Financial gain from selling stolen data 
 (B)   	
Ethical concerns about the environmental impact of 
the sporting event 
 (C)   	
Revenge against a particular athlete or team 
 (D)   	
Desire to create disruption and chaos during the 
event 
Explanation 109. Correct Answer: D. Desire to create 
disruption and chaos during the event. Given the wide array 
of targets and the timing of the attacks during a major event 
without a clear financial motive, it’s evident that the main goal 
of the hackers was to create widespread disruption and chaos. 
Option A is incorrect. There’s no indication in the scenario that 
data was stolen or sold, and no clear financial motive was 
presented. 
Option B is incorrect. While ethical concerns might be a 
possible reason for some attacks, the scale and targets of these 
attacks suggest a broader motive of causing disruption. 
Option C is incorrect. The scenario doesn’t specify any 
particular focus on an athlete or team; the attacks were 
widespread, impacting the entire event.

Question 110. A local coffee shop offers free Wi-Fi to its 
customers. Recently, there have been reports of man-in-the-
middle attacks on the network. The owner decides to upgrade 
the wireless security and wants to implement a cryptographic 
protocol to secure data transmissions. Which protocol would 
provide a balance between security and performance for the 
public Wi-Fi users? 
 (A)   	
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 
 (B)   	
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) 
 (C)   	
RC4 Stream Cipher 
 (D)   	
Open Wireless 
Explanation 110. Correct Answer: A. Advanced Encryption 
Standard (AES). AES offers a good balance between security 
and performance. It is a modern encryption standard that 
provides strong security without causing significant 
performance overhead, making it suitable for a public Wi-Fi 
setting where both security and user experience are important. 
Option B is incorrect. WEP is an outdated encryption protocol 
with known vulnerabilities. It is insecure and can be easily 
cracked, making it unsuitable for securing a public Wi-Fi 
network. 
Option C is incorrect. RC4 is a stream cipher that was used in 
older wireless protocols like WEP. It has been found to be 
vulnerable to various attacks and is no longer considered secure 
for wireless networks. 
Option D is incorrect. An open wireless network does not 
implement any encryption, leaving data transmissions 
	
 
960

vulnerable to eavesdropping and other attacks. It would not 
provide the desired security for the coffee shop’s Wi-Fi users. 
Question 111. TechHive Corp. is planning to sell some of its 
old servers. Before selling, they want to ensure that no 
retrievable personal or business data remains on the hard drives. 
Which of the following methods should TechHive use to ensure 
the drives are clean and the data cannot be recovered? 
 (A)   	
Simple Format 
 (B)   	
Magnetic Wiping 
 (C)   	
Physical Destruction 
 (D)   	
Standard Defragmentation 
Explanation 111. Correct Answer: B. Magnetic Wiping. 
Magnetic wiping, also known as degaussing, uses magnetic 
fields to permanently erase data from storage devices. It makes 
the data irretrievable, ensuring that personal and business data 
cannot be recovered even with advanced tools. 
Option A is incorrect. A simple format often leaves traces of 
data, which can potentially be recovered using specialized 
software. 
Option C is incorrect. While physical destruction ensures data 
cannot be retrieved, it would make the servers unusable for 
resale purposes. 
Option D is incorrect. Defragmentation is a process to 
optimize and organize the data on a drive, but it does not erase 
data. 
	
 
961

Question 112. A financial institution has reported that they 
experience an average of 3 phishing attacks every year that 
attempt to compromise their user data. Based on this data, what 
is the Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO) for these phishing 
attacks? 
 (A)   	
0.33 
 (B)   	
1 
 (C)  	
 3 
 (D)   	
12 
Explanation 112. Correct Answer: C. 3. The Annualized Rate 
of Occurrence (ARO) represents the expected frequency of a 
specific event or risk occurring each year. Given that the 
financial institution experiences 3 phishing attacks every year, 
the ARO is 3. 
Option A is incorrect. An ARO of 0.33 would indicate that the 
event happens approximately once every three years, not thrice 
in a year. 
Option B is incorrect. An ARO of 1 would suggest the event 
happens once a year, which is not consistent with the scenario. 
Option D is incorrect. This would indicate the event occurs 12 
times a year or once a month, which is not the case based on the 
information provided. 
Question 113. TechFlow Corp. is undergoing a risk analysis for 
its online platform. If a critical vulnerability were exploited, the 
company would have to pay $10,000 in repair costs, $5,000 in 
compensation to customers, and a $15,000 fine to regulatory 
	
 
962

bodies. What would be the Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) for 
this vulnerability? 
 (A)   	
$10,000 
 (B)   	
$20,000 
 (C)	        $30,000 
 (D)   	
$50,000 
Explanation 113. Correct Answer: C. $30,000. Single Loss 
Expectancy (SLE) is the cost of a single event or incident. In 
this scenario, adding up the repair costs, compensations, and 
fines gives: $10,000 + $5,000 + $15,000 = $30,000. 
Option A is incorrect. This only accounts for the repair costs. 
Option B is incorrect. This only considers the repair costs and 
compensations but omits the fines. 
Option D is incorrect. This value exceeds the combined costs 
from the vulnerability being exploited. 
Question 114. Country A and Country B are engaged in an 
ongoing territorial dispute. Suddenly, critical infrastructure 
facilities in Country B, such as power plants and transportation 
hubs, experience systematic cyberattacks. No ransom demand is 
made, and the attacks lead to significant disruption. What is the 
most probable motivation behind these cyberattacks? 
 (A)   	
Financial gain from market disruptions 
 (B)   	
Ethical hackers testing vulnerabilities 
 (C)   	
Disruption due to philosophical disagreements with 
Country B's policies 
	
 
963

 (D)   	
Acts of cyberwarfare to weaken Country B's 
position 
Explanation 114. Correct Answer: D. Acts of cyberwarfare 
to weaken Country B’s position. Given the context of the 
territorial dispute and the specific targeting of critical 
infrastructures without any ransom demand, it’s highly likely 
that these attacks were intended as acts of cyberwarfare by 
Country A or its sympathizers to exert pressure on Country B. 
Option A is incorrect. While market disruptions can be 
exploited for financial gains, the context of a territorial dispute 
and the nature of the attacks suggest a motive tied to 
geopolitical strategy rather than financial advantage. 
Option B is incorrect. Ethical hackers typically identify and 
report vulnerabilities rather than exploit them to cause 
widespread disruption. 
Option C is incorrect. The attacks were too specific and large-
scale to be the work of individuals or groups motivated solely 
by philosophical disagreements. 
Question 115. The IT security team at a large corporation is 
evaluating monitoring tools for network traffic. They need a 
solution that can inspect network packets without introducing 
any potential latency or altering the network flow. Which type 
of device attribute should they consider? 
 (A)   	
Active IDS 
 (B)   	
Passive firewall 
	
 
964

 (C)   	
Active firewall 
 (D)   	
Passive IDS 
Explanation 115. Correct Answer: D. Passive IDS. Passive 
IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is designed to monitor and 
analyze network traffic without influencing the traffic flow or 
causing potential latency. It observes traffic in real-time but 
doesn’t take active actions on its own. 
Option A is incorrect. An Active IDS can detect potential 
security breaches and take action, which may introduce latency 
or alter the traffic flow. 
Option B is incorrect. While the term “passive firewall” is not 
standard, traditional firewalls can actively block or allow traffic, 
which can introduce changes to the network flow. 
Option C is incorrect. An Active firewall actively filters 
network traffic based on configured policies, potentially 
affecting the network flow. 
Question 116. In a routine security assessment, Claire found 
that a newly deployed database server within her organization is 
still using its default login credentials. Which of the following is 
the PRIMARY security risk associated with this finding? 
 (A)   	
The database will not function optimally 
 (B)   	
The server will need frequent patches 
 (C)   	
Unauthorized individuals may easily gain access 
 (D)   	
The server will consume more bandwidth 
	
 
965

Explanation 116. Correct Answer: C. Unauthorized 
individuals may easily gain access. Default credentials are 
often publicly known, and if they are not changed, malicious 
actors can easily use them to gain unauthorized access to 
systems. 
Default credentials, which may include usernames and 
passwords set by manufacturers for initial setup, are widely 
known and can be easily searched online. If not changed after 
deployment, they pose a significant security risk as they allow 
anyone with this knowledge to gain access to the system. 
Option A is incorrect. The use of default credentials doesn’t 
directly impact the optimal functioning of the database. 
Option B is incorrect. The use of default credentials doesn’t 
mean that the server will need frequent patches. However, patch 
management is a separate aspect of maintaining server security. 
Option D is incorrect. The use of default credentials doesn’t 
directly cause the server to consume more bandwidth. 
Question 117. Mike, a network administrator, notices an 
unauthorized device connected directly to the company’s main 
network switch in the server room. This device is attempting to 
capture network traffic. What kind of attack is this unauthorized 
device likely conducting? 
 (A)   	
Rogue access point 
 (B)   	
VLAN hopping 
 (C)   	
Port mirroring 
 (D)   	
ARP poisoning 
	
 
966

Explanation 117. Correct Answer: C. Port mirroring. Port 
mirroring is a method used on a network switch to send a copy 
of network packets seen on one switch port (or an entire VLAN) 
to a network monitoring connection on another switch port. An 
attacker can use this method to capture and analyze the traffic 
without interfering with the flow of the original packets. 
Option A is incorrect. A rogue access point is a wireless access 
point installed on a network without the network administrator’s 
authorization. The scenario describes a wired connection, not a 
wireless one. 
Option B is incorrect. VLAN hopping is an attack method 
used to access data from different VLANs that would typically 
not be accessible. The scenario focuses on capturing network 
traffic, not crossing VLAN boundaries. 
Option D is incorrect. ARP poisoning is a type of attack in 
which an attacker sends false ARP messages to a local network. 
This is not directly related to the unauthorized device connected 
to the switch as described. 
Question 118. GreenValley Mall, located in a busy urban area, 
has recently faced security concerns due to the proximity of its 
main entrance to a major road. Which physical security 
enhancement can the mall management implement to create a 
protective barrier between the road and the entrance, ensuring 
pedestrian safety and preventing unauthorized vehicular access? 
 (A)   	
Reinforced Walls 
 (B)   	
Metal Detectors 
	
 
967

 (C)   	
Bollards 
 (D)   	
Perimeter Fencing 
Explanation 118. Correct Answer: C. Bollards. Bollards are 
robust vertical posts, usually made of steel or concrete, which 
can be placed at specific intervals to form a protective barrier. 
They can effectively prevent vehicles from accessing pedestrian 
areas or building entrances while allowing pedestrian 
movement. 
Option A is incorrect. While reinforced walls can offer 
protection against various threats, they would not be practical 
for separating a mall entrance from a road as they would block 
pedestrian access as well. 
Option B is incorrect. Metal detectors are used for detecting 
metal objects and weapons on individuals entering a facility, not 
for stopping vehicular access. 
Option D is incorrect. Perimeter fencing can deter 
unauthorized access, but it might not specifically prevent fast-
moving vehicular threats like bollards do. Furthermore, a fence 
might not be aesthetically pleasing or practical in front of a mall 
entrance. 
Question 119. TechCorp is implementing a new cloud-based 
solution. The security team has been tasked with analyzing the 
risks associated with this project. They’ve decided to categorize 
the risks based on their potential impact levels: Low, Medium, 
High, and Critical. Which type of risk analysis is TechCorp’s 
security team employing? 
	
 
968

 (A)   	
Quantitative 
 (B)   	
Statistical 
 (C)   	
Qualitative 
 (D)   	
Financial 
Explanation 119. Correct Answer: C. Qualitative. Qualitative 
risk analysis involves assessing risks based on descriptive 
categories or rankings, such as Low, Medium, High, and 
Critical, instead of using numeric values. 
Option A is incorrect. Quantitative risk analysis involves using 
numerical values, often in the form of monetary figures or 
percentages, to evaluate risks. 
Option B is incorrect. Statistical risk analysis uses statistical 
methods, often paired with quantitative data, to predict future 
risks. It doesn’t categorize risks in the manner described. 
Option D is incorrect. Financial risk analysis specifically 
evaluates risks in terms of potential financial losses and is a 
subset of quantitative risk analysis. 
Question 120. TechBlitz Inc. recently underwent an IT audit, 
and one of the suggestions was to reduce the attack surface. 
Which of the following measures would be MOST effective in 
accomplishing this? 
 (A)   	
Increasing the password length requirement for all 
users 
 (B)   	
Implementing regular vulnerability assessments 
 (C)   	
Deactivating unused services and ports on servers 
	
 
969

 (D)   	
Implementing a strict BYOD (Bring Your Own 
Device) policy 
Explanation 120. Correct Answer: C. Deactivating unused 
services and ports on servers. Reducing the number of active 
services and ports directly diminishes the number of potential 
entry points for attackers, thus reducing the attack surface. 
Option A is incorrect. While increasing password length 
improves security against brute-force attacks, it doesn’t directly 
affect the attack surface. 
Option B is incorrect. Regular vulnerability assessments 
identify potential security gaps, but simply identifying doesn’t 
reduce the attack surface unless actions are taken based on 
findings. 
Option D is incorrect. A strict BYOD policy can enhance 
security, but it’s focused more on the types of devices and how 
they connect rather than reducing the number of potential attack 
points. 
Question 121. GreenTech, a data center company, is planning to 
expand its operations in a region known for frequent power 
outages. To maintain security posture and ensure continuity of 
operations, which of the following should be their PRIMARY 
consideration regarding power? 
 (A)       Using power-efficient servers to reduce electricity costs 
 (B)   	
Setting up solar panels to promote green energy 
 (C)  	
 Investing in redundant power supplies and 
uninterruptible power systems (UPS) 
	
 
970

 (D)   	
Running operations only during peak daylight hours 
to ensure natural lighting 
Explanation 121. Correct Answer: C. Investing in 
redundant power supplies and uninterruptible power 
systems (UPS). Given the frequent power outages in the region, 
having redundant power supplies and UPS ensures that 
operations continue smoothly without abrupt interruptions, 
which can lead to system crashes, data corruption, or security 
breaches. 
Option A is incorrect. While power-efficient servers can 
reduce costs, they do not address the primary concern of power 
outages and maintaining operations. 
Option B is incorrect. Solar panels promote green energy but 
might not provide consistent and immediate power backup 
during outages, especially during nighttime or cloudy days. 
Option D is incorrect. Limiting operations to daylight hours is 
not a practical solution for a data center, as it restricts 
operational capacity and doesn’t directly address the issue of 
power outages. 
Question 122. WebFlix, a popular online movie streaming 
service, experienced a data center outage due to a natural 
disaster. They had backups in place and restored their systems 
using data from 6 hours prior to the outage. This resulted in the 
loss of some user interactions, like ratings and watchlists from 
the last 6 hours. What term describes the 6-hour gap between 
the last backup and the time of the outage? 
	
 
971

 (A)   	
Recovery Time Objective (RTO) 
 (B)       Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) 
 (C)   	
Recovery Duration Period (RDP) 
 (D)   	
Recovery Point Objective (RPO) 
Explanation 122. Correct Answer: D. Recovery Point 
Objective (RPO). The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the 
maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. For 
WebFlix, this means they could afford to lose up to 6 hours of 
data (user interactions in this case) in the event of a disaster. 
Option A is incorrect. Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the 
maximum acceptable amount of time that a system can be down 
after a disruption. 
Option B is incorrect. Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) 
represents the total amount of time a system can afford to be 
non-operational without incurring significant risks or significant 
losses. 
Option C is incorrect. Recovery Duration Period (RDP) is not 
a standard term in business continuity and disaster recovery 
planning. 
Question 123. Jane, the CISO at a financial institution, is 
overseeing the decommissioning of several old servers. She is 
aware that while some data must be destroyed, other data must 
be retained due to industry regulations. Which principle should 
Jane primarily focus on to ensure compliance? 
 (A)   	
Minimum necessary principle 
 (B)   	
Principle of least privilege 
	
 
972

 (C)   	
Data retention policy 
 (D)   	
Mandatory vacation policy 
Explanation 123. Correct Answer: C. Data retention policy. 
A data retention policy specifically defines how long data 
should be retained and the manner of its storage based on 
business needs, regulatory requirements, and other factors. In 
the context of decommissioning servers, adhering to this policy 
will ensure that Jane complies with regulations related to data 
retention. 
Option A is incorrect. The minimum necessary principle 
pertains to healthcare and refers to only using, disclosing, or 
requesting the amount of information necessary to accomplish a 
specific task. 
Option B is incorrect. The principle of least privilege pertains 
to access controls and means giving users the minimum levels 
of access necessary to perform their jobs. 
Option D is incorrect. A mandatory vacation policy pertains to 
ensuring employees take time off so that potential fraudulent 
activities might be detected in their absence. It doesn’t directly 
address data retention. 
Question 124. A medium-sized e-commerce company recently 
experienced a data breach due to an external attack. Post-
incident analysis revealed that while there were indications of 
the attack in their network traffic, no alarms were raised at the 
time of the attack. The company now wants to implement a 
solution to actively monitor and take action against malicious 
	
 
973

network traffic. Which of the following should they deploy? 
 (A)   	
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
 (B)   	
Network Access Control (NAC) 
 (C)   	
Proxy server 
 (D)  	
 Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) 
Explanation 124. Correct Answer: D. Intrusion Prevention 
System (IPS). An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) not only 
detects malicious network activities but also takes active steps 
to prevent or block them, which is ideal for a company looking 
to bolster its defenses against real-time threats. 
Option A is incorrect. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
will detect and alert on malicious activity but does not take 
active steps to prevent the threat. 
Option B is incorrect. Network Access Control (NAC) is 
primarily used for controlling network access based on policies, 
not for active monitoring and prevention of malicious network 
traffic. 
Option C is incorrect. A Proxy server acts as an intermediary 
for requests from clients seeking resources but is not 
specifically designed to detect or prevent intrusions. 
Question 125. A cybersecurity analyst at XYZ Corp is looking 
to deploy a system that appears to be vulnerable and enticing to 
attackers. The main goal is to study the tactics, techniques, and 
procedures (TTPs) of potential adversaries, without them 
realizing that they’re interacting with a decoy. Which of the 
following would BEST meet this requirement? 
	
 
974

 (A)   	
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
 (B)   	
Firewall 
 (C)   	
Honeypot 
 (D)   	
VPN Concentrator 
Explanation 125. Correct Answer: C. Honeypot. A honeypot 
is a security mechanism designed to lure attackers into 
interacting with a seemingly vulnerable system. Its primary 
purpose is not to block or prevent attacks but to log and study 
them. By analyzing the activities on the honeypot, security 
professionals can gain insights into the methods and 
motivations of the attackers. 
Option A is incorrect. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is 
designed to detect malicious activities on a network and alert 
administrators. While it can identify threats, it doesn’t actively 
lure attackers. 
Option B is incorrect. A firewall is designed to block or allow 
traffic based on specific rules. It doesn’t present itself as a 
vulnerable target to lure attackers. 
Option D is incorrect. A VPN Concentrator is a device that 
provides remote access to a network over a secure connection. 
Its primary purpose is to enable secure remote access, not to act 
as a decoy for attackers. 
Question 126. The networking team at SecureNet Corp. is 
setting up a new branch office. They want to ensure secure 
connectivity between the branch office and the main office. 
Which of the following would BEST provide this? 
	
 
975

 (A)   	
Establishing a clear line of sight for wireless antennas 
between the two locations 
 (B)   	
Implementing a Virtual Private Network (VPN) 
between the two sites 
 (C)   	
Increasing bandwidth on the public internet 
connection at both locations 
 (D)   	
Using multi-factor authentication for all user accounts 
in both locations 
Explanation 126. Correct Answer: B. Implementing a 
Virtual Private Network (VPN) between the two sites. VPNs 
provide secure, encrypted connections over potentially insecure 
networks, such as the internet, making them ideal for securely 
connecting remote locations. 
Option A is incorrect. While a clear line of sight might 
facilitate wireless communication, it doesn’t inherently provide 
secure connectivity. 
Option C is incorrect. Increasing bandwidth enhances data 
transfer rates but doesn’t inherently secure the connection 
between sites. 
Option D is incorrect. Multi-factor authentication is a robust 
security measure for user access but doesn’t secure network 
connectivity between sites. 
Question 127. TechVault, a company specializing in secure 
storage solutions, recently had an unauthorized intrusion where 
a burglar managed to bypass their motion sensors. In a bid to 
prevent future breaches, they are considering deploying a 
	
 
976

system that can detect weight changes in a restricted floor area 
to alert any unauthorized access. Which of the following would 
be BEST for this requirement? 
 (A)   	
Ultrasonic motion detectors 
 (B)   	
Pressure-sensitive floor mats 
 (C)   	
CCTV cameras with facial recognition 
 (D)   	
Glass break sensors 
Explanation 127. Correct Answer: B. Pressure-sensitive 
floor mats. Pressure-sensitive floor mats are designed to detect 
weight changes or pressure when stepped on. This makes them 
an effective solution for monitoring restricted areas and alerting 
unauthorized access based on weight detection. 
Option A is incorrect. Ultrasonic motion detectors use sound 
waves to detect motion in an area but do not measure weight or 
pressure. 
Option C is incorrect. CCTV cameras with facial recognition 
provide visual surveillance and can identify individuals, but 
they don’t detect weight changes on the floor. 
Option D is incorrect. Glass break sensors detect the sound of 
breaking glass and are primarily used for windows and glass 
doors, not for detecting pressure or weight changes on a floor. 
Question 128. SafeMed, a medical facility, uses a life-saving 
medical device with embedded software. Recently, a security 
vulnerability was found in the software, but due to the device’s 
FDA regulatory status and the software’s design, it cannot be 
patched immediately. How should SafeMed address the security 
	
 
977

concerns related to this device? 
 (A)   	
Disconnect the device from all networks and only use 
it in standalone mode 
 (B)   	
Inform patients about the vulnerability and let them 
decide whether to use the device 
 (C) 	  Implement network segmentation and strictly control 
access to the device 
 (D)   	
Return the device to the manufacturer for a full refund 
Explanation 128. Correct Answer: C. Implement network 
segmentation and strictly control access to the device. By 
implementing network segmentation, SafeMed can isolate the 
vulnerable device from other parts of the network, reducing the 
risk of potential exploitation. Strictly controlling access ensures 
only authorized personnel can use or interact with the device. 
Option A is incorrect. Completely disconnecting the device 
might limit its functionality, especially if it needs network 
access for updates, data transfer, or other essential operations. 
Option B is incorrect. While transparency is important, simply 
informing patients without taking protective measures may not 
be enough to ensure safety and could lead to panic or 
misinformation. 
Option D is incorrect. Returning the device might not be 
feasible, especially if there are no immediate replacements 
available, and it is vital for patient care. 
Question 129. The network administrator at a university wants 
to ensure that when students log onto the campus wireless 
	
 
978

network, their credentials are verified by the university’s central 
authentication server. Additionally, the administrator wants to 
make sure that the data between the wireless access point and 
the central server is encrypted. Which solution should the 
administrator implement? 
 (A)   	
WPA3 with SAE 
 (B)   	
WPA2-Personal with AES 
 (C)   	
WPA2-Enterprise with RADIUS 
 (D)   	
Open wireless with VPN 
Explanation 129. Correct Answer: C. WPA2-Enterprise 
with RADIUS. WPA2-Enterprise provides a more robust 
authentication method suitable for larger organizations like 
universities. By using RADIUS, the university can centralize 
the authentication process, ensuring students’ credentials are 
verified against the central server. RADIUS also encrypts the 
data between the wireless access point and the central server, 
providing an additional layer of security. 
Option A is incorrect. WPA3 with SAE is primarily used for 
secure handshakes between devices and does not directly relate 
to centralized authentication against a server like RADIUS. 
Option B is incorrect. WPA2-Personal with AES is designed 
for personal or small office use where a pre-shared key is used. 
It doesn’t support centralized authentication like RADIUS. 
Option D is incorrect. While a VPN can encrypt data between 
a device and a network, it doesn’t centralize wireless 
authentication in the way that RADIUS does with WPA2-
Enterprise.

Question 130. TechHaus has recently experienced multiple 
security breaches where unauthorized personnel have managed 
to infiltrate their server rooms after hours. To enhance security 
measures, the company decided to deploy a new system. Which 
of the following options would BEST detect human intruders 
based on their body heat even in complete darkness? 
 (A)   	
Installing CCTV cameras with LED lights 
 (B)   	
Using ultrasonic motion sensors 
 (C)          Deploying infrared (IR) sensors 
 (D)   	
Implementing RFID badge readers at the entrance 
Explanation 130. Correct Answer: C. Deploying infrared 
(IR) sensors. Infrared (IR) sensors detect infrared radiation, 
such as the heat emitted by the human body. This makes them 
particularly effective in detecting human intruders, even in 
complete darkness, based on the body heat they emit. 
Option A is incorrect. While CCTV cameras with LED lights 
can provide visual surveillance, they rely on light to produce 
images and may not detect intruders in complete darkness as 
efficiently as infrared sensors. 
Option B is incorrect. Ultrasonic motion sensors detect 
movement through sound waves, not body heat, making them 
less efficient in differentiating between a human intruder and 
other moving objects. 
Option D is incorrect. RFID badge readers control access at 
entry points but do not detect human intruders based on their 
body heat inside a facility.

Question 131. SecureTech Corp, a company dealing with 
sensitive client data, is redesigning its main office entrance to 
enhance security. They want to ensure that only one person 
gains access at a time, even if multiple people try to enter using 
a single authorized access badge. Which of the following would 
best serve this purpose? 
 (A)   	
CCTV Cameras 
 (B)   	
Mantrap 
 (C)   	
Biometric Scanners 
 (D)   	
Motion Detectors 
Explanation 131. Correct Answer: B. Mantrap. A mantrap, 
also known as an access control vestibule, is a physical security 
access control system comprising a small space with two sets of 
interlocking doors. The first door must close before the second 
door opens, ensuring that only one person can pass through at a 
time. This design prevents tailgating or piggybacking, where 
unauthorized individuals attempt to enter a secure area by 
following closely behind an authorized individual. 
Option A is incorrect. While CCTV cameras monitor and 
record activities, they do not physically prevent multiple people 
from entering at once using a single access badge. 
Option C is incorrect. Biometric scanners provide a means of 
authenticating individuals based on unique physical or 
behavioral characteristics, but they do not prevent tailgating on 
their own. 
	
 
981

Option D is incorrect. Motion detectors can detect movement 
but do not restrict the entry of multiple individuals trying to use 
a single authorized access badge. 
Question 132. An enterprise wants to configure its firewall so 
that if a malfunction occurs, the firewall should automatically 
allow traffic to ensure business continuity. Which failure mode 
should be implemented? 
 (A)   	
Fail-safe 
 (B)   	
Fail-over 
 (C)   	
Fail-closed 
 (D)   	
Fail-open 
Explanation 132. Correct Answer: D. Fail-open. In a fail-
open mode, when the system or device fails, it defaults to an 
“open” state, allowing traffic to pass through. This mode 
prioritizes availability over strict security. 
Option A is incorrect. “Fail-safe” is a term that typically refers 
to a system’s ability to default to a safe condition in case of a 
failure. However, in the context of firewalls and access control 
systems, “fail-open” or “fail-closed” are the preferred terms. 
Option B is incorrect. “Fail-over” refers to switching to a 
backup system or component in the event of a failure. It doesn’t 
describe the behavior of allowing or denying traffic during a 
failure. 
Option C is incorrect. Fail-closed means that when a 
malfunction occurs, the system would block all traffic by 
default, which is the opposite of what the enterprise wants. 
	
 
982

Question 133. During a board meeting at DataFlow Corp., the 
CEO emphasizes that while they are willing to take certain risks 
for innovation, there’s a limit to the amount of risk they are 
willing to take, especially concerning potential financial losses. 
To ensure that risks stay below this level, what should be 
defined in the risk register? 
 (A)   	
Risk Owner Assignment 
 (B)   	
Key Risk Indicator (KRI) 
 (C)   	
Risk Impact Analysis 
 (D)       Risk Threshold 
Explanation 133. Correct Answer: D. Risk Threshold. The 
risk threshold indicates the maximum level of risk an 
organization is willing to tolerate or accept. Setting a clear risk 
threshold ensures that any risks that surpass this level are given 
priority for management or mitigation. 
Option A is incorrect. While assigning a Risk Owner is crucial 
for accountability, it doesn’t define the maximum level of risk 
an organization is willing to tolerate. 
Option B is incorrect. A Key Risk Indicator (KRI) provides 
early signals of increasing risk exposures. While they are 
essential for monitoring risks, they don’t establish the maximum 
tolerable risk level. 
Option C is incorrect. Risk Impact Analysis assesses the 
potential consequences of a given risk but doesn’t set a level 
indicating the maximum risk the organization is prepared to 
accept. 
	
 
983

Question 134. A healthcare provider is updating its network 
infrastructure. Due to the sensitive nature of the medical data 
they handle, they want to ensure that any anomalies or 
malicious activities in the network are immediately detected and 
alerted. Which system should they primarily consider? 
 (A)   	
Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) 
 (B)  	
 Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
 (C)   	
DHCP server 
 (D)   	
VPN concentrator 
Explanation 134. Correct Answer: B. Intrusion Detection 
System (IDS). An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) actively 
monitors network traffic for any signs of malicious activities or 
policy violations and alerts the administrators. It is suitable for 
organizations that want to ensure anomalies are promptly 
detected. 
Option A is incorrect. An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) 
does actively monitor and detect malicious traffic but also takes 
measures to prevent it. While an IPS could be beneficial for the 
healthcare provider, the primary requirement mentioned was for 
detection and alerting, which is the primary function of an IDS. 
Option C is incorrect. A DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration 
Protocol) server assigns IP addresses to devices in a network. It 
does not monitor or alert on malicious network activities. 
Option D is incorrect. A VPN concentrator is used to create 
and manage VPN connections, providing secure access to a 
network, but it doesn’t primarily detect intrusions. 
	
 
984

Question 135. BioGen Inc., a biotechnology company, has 
implemented a layered security approach. They are considering 
adding a human element to their security measures for their 
research labs. Which of the following would best provide the 
ability to evaluate and respond to various security situations 
with human judgment? 
 (A)   	
Installing biometric locks 
 (B)   	
Employing security guards 
 (C)   	
Implementing an access control vestibule 
 (D)   	
Deploying AI-driven security cameras 
Explanation 135. Correct Answer: B. Employing security 
guards. Security guards provide the advantage of human 
judgment and can evaluate, respond, and adapt to a wide variety 
of security situations, making them ideal for adding a human 
element to a layered security approach. 
Option A is incorrect. While biometric locks can control access 
based on unique human features, they don’t provide the 
evaluation and response capabilities of a human guard. 
Option C is incorrect. An access control vestibule controls 
access into an area, often with two sets of doors, but it does not 
provide the evaluation, judgment, or immediate response that a 
security guard does. 
Option D is incorrect. While AI-driven security cameras can 
provide advanced monitoring and potentially detect suspicious 
activities, they don’t replace the judgment and immediate 
response capabilities of a human security guard. 
	
 
985

Question 136. ExamsDigest Corp, a technology company, 
recently conducted a security assessment to align with industry 
best practices. The company’s current security posture was 
compared to its desired future state, revealing discrepancies. 
Which of the following best describes the approach 
ExamsDigest Corp employed? 
 (A)   	
Vulnerability Assessment 
 (B)   	
Penetration Testing 
 (C)   	
Gap Analysis 
 (D)   	
Threat Modeling 
Explanation 136. Correct Answer: C. Gap Analysis. Gap 
analysis is a method of comparing the current state of 
something (such as security measures) with a future desired 
state to identify the discrepancies or “gaps”. In the scenario, 
ExamsDigest Corp compared their current security posture to a 
desired future state, which is consistent with the process of gap 
analysis. 
Option A is incorrect. A vulnerability assessment focuses on 
identifying, quantifying, and ranking vulnerabilities in a system, 
not comparing the current state with a desired future state. 
Option B is incorrect. Penetration testing is an authorized 
simulated cyberattack on a system to evaluate its security, not to 
compare its current state with a desired future state. 
Option D is incorrect. Threat modeling is the process of 
identifying potential threats to a system and determining the risk 
they pose, not comparing the current state with a desired future 
state.

Question 137. Sophia, the CFO of a medium-sized company, 
received a call from an individual claiming to be from the IT 
department. The caller requested her login details for a “critical 
system update.” Suspecting something wasn’t right, Sophia 
hung up and contacted her IT department, which confirmed no 
such call was made by them. Which type of attack did Sophia 
most likely experience? 
 (A)   	
Vishing 
 (B)   	
Phishing 
 (C)   	
SQL Injection 
 (D)   	
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
Explanation 137. Correct Answer: A. Vishing. Vishing, or 
voice phishing, is an attack where fraudsters use the telephone 
to mislead individuals into revealing personal information or 
login credentials. 
Option B is incorrect. Phishing is typically an attempt to 
obtain sensitive information through deceptive emails and 
websites, not voice calls. 
Option C is incorrect. SQL Injection is an attack type that tries 
to execute malicious SQL statements in a database. It is not 
related to voice calls. 
Option D is incorrect. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a 
type of attack where the attacker tricks the victim into 
submitting a malicious request. This is unrelated to voice call 
scenarios. 
	
 
987

Question 138. A medium-sized enterprise is preparing to 
upgrade its office workstations. The IT department is 
considering purchasing devices from a lesser-known, but 
cheaper, vendor. Which of the following should be the 
PRIMARY consideration before finalizing the acquisition? 
 (A)   	
Whether the vendor offers a longer warranty period 
 (B)   	
The aesthetics and design of the workstations 
 (C)  	
 The vendor's adherence to industry security 
standards and practices 
 (D)   	
The amount of training required for IT staff to support 
the new devices 
Explanation 138. Correct Answer: C. The vendor’s 
adherence to industry security standards and practices. 
Ensuring that the vendor adheres to industry security standards 
and practices is critical for maintaining a secure environment. 
Devices that don’t meet security standards could introduce 
vulnerabilities into the organization. 
Option A is incorrect. While a longer warranty period might be 
attractive, it should not be the primary concern over security 
considerations. 
Option B is incorrect. Aesthetics and design, while potentially 
important for branding or user satisfaction, are not as critical as 
security considerations. 
Option D is incorrect. Training the IT staff is important, but it 
shouldn’t take precedence over ensuring the devices themselves 
are secure. 
	
 
988

Question 139. An employee of XYZ Corp downloaded a 
seemingly benign PDF file from a vendor’s website. After 
opening the PDF, the company’s intrusion detection system 
(IDS) alerted the security team about suspicious activity 
originating from the employee’s computer. The PDF file most 
likely contained which of the following threats? 
 (A)   	
Watering Hole Attack 
 (B)   	
Malicious Macro 
 (C)   	
SQL Injection 
 (D)   	
Credential Harvesting 
Explanation 139. Correct Answer: B. Malicious Macro. 
Many document types, including PDFs, can contain macros. A 
malicious macro can execute unwanted actions, such as 
downloading and installing malware, when the document is 
opened. 
Option A is incorrect. A Watering Hole Attack is when an 
attacker guesses or observes which websites an organization 
often uses and infects them with malware, with the intent of 
compromising members of that organization. The scenario does 
not provide evidence pointing to this kind of attack. 
Option C is incorrect. SQL Injection is a type of attack that 
aims to execute malicious SQL statements in a database. This 
type of attack is unrelated to opening a PDF file. 
Option D is incorrect. A Drive-By Download involves 
automatically downloading software, often malicious, without 
user knowledge or consent, typically when a user visits a 
	
 
989

compromised website. The scenario specifically discusses a 
downloaded and then manually opened PDF. 
Question 140. A rapidly growing e-commerce platform has 
been facing intermittent downtimes, especially during sale 
events. To ensure high availability and even distribution of 
traffic among servers, the company is considering deploying a 
specific type of network appliance. Which of the following 
should the company deploy? 
 (A)   	
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
 (B)   	
VPN concentrator 
 (C)   	
Load balancer 
 (D)          Proxy server 
Explanation 140. Correct Answer: C. Load balancer. A load 
balancer is designed to distribute incoming network traffic 
across multiple servers to ensure that no single server is 
overwhelmed with too much traffic. This helps in ensuring high 
availability and optimizing resource utilization. 
Option A is incorrect. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is 
primarily used for detecting malicious activities in the network, 
not for distributing traffic among servers. 
Option B is incorrect. A VPN concentrator is used to create 
and manage VPN connections, not for balancing load among 
servers. 
Option D is incorrect. While a proxy server can distribute 
client requests to different servers, its primary role is to act as 
	
 
990

an intermediary, not to ensure high availability or evenly 
distribute traffic. 
Question 141. TechFusion Inc. is a well-established technology 
company that has been in the market for over 15 years. 
Recently, the board of directors decided that the company will 
pursue aggressive growth strategies by entering new, untested 
markets and launching cutting-edge products, even if these 
strategies come with significant risks. How would you classify 
TechFusion Inc.’s risk appetite? 
 (A)   	
Conservative 
 (B)   	
Expansionary 
 (C)   	
Neutral 
 (D)   	
Risk-averse 
Explanation 141. Correct Answer: B. Expansionary. 
Expansionary risk appetite is characterized by an entity’s 
willingness to accept a higher level of risk in pursuit of higher 
rewards. Given that TechFusion Inc. is looking to enter new 
markets and launch cutting-edge products, which inherently 
come with significant risks, their risk appetite can be classified 
as expansionary. 
Option A is incorrect. A conservative risk appetite means an 
organization is very cautious and avoids taking significant risks, 
which is the opposite of TechFusion Inc.’s approach. 
Option C is incorrect. Neutral risk appetite means an 
organization neither seeks to take on nor avoid risk, maintaining 
its current risk position. 
	
 
991

Option D is incorrect. Risk-averse is similar to conservative, 
where an organization is very cautious about taking on new 
risks. It doesn’t capture the aggressive growth strategy 
described. 
Question 142. Alex, an employee at XYZ Corp, noticed an 
unfamiliar USB drive lying in the company parking lot. Out of 
curiosity, Alex plugged the device into his workstation. Almost 
immediately, his antivirus program detected malicious software 
trying to execute. What type of attack did Alex likely  
encounter? 
 (A)         Man-in-the-Middle Attack 
 (B)   	
Evil Twin 
 (C)   	
Spear Phishing 
 (D)   	
USB Drop Attack 
Explanation 142. Correct Answer: D. USB Drop Attack. A 
USB Drop Attack involves leaving malware-infected removable 
devices, such as USB drives, in places where they can be found 
and used by unsuspecting individuals. Once the device is 
plugged into a computer, it can potentially execute malicious 
software or scripts. 
Option A is incorrect. A Man-in-the-Middle Attack involves an 
attacker secretly intercepting and possibly altering the 
communication between two parties without them noticing. It is 
not related to USB devices. 
Option B is incorrect. Evil Twin refers to a rogue Wi-Fi access 
point that appears to be legitimate but is set up to eavesdrop on 
wireless communications. It doesn’t pertain to USB devices. 
	
 
992

Option C is incorrect. Spear Phishing is a targeted attempt to 
steal sensitive information through deceptive emails directed at 
specific individuals or companies. It is not associated with USB 
devices. 
Question 143. A rapidly growing e-commerce company has 
recently experienced an increase in cross-site scripting (XSS) 
and SQL injection attacks. The company wants to deploy a 
solution that specifically protects against these threats at the 
application layer. Which type of firewall would be most 
appropriate? 
 (A)   	
Stateful Packet Inspection Firewall 
 (B)   	
Proxy Firewall 
 (C)   	
Network Layer Firewall 
 (D)   	
Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
Explanation 143. Correct Answer: D. Web Application 
Firewall (WAF). A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is 
specifically designed to protect web applications by monitoring, 
filtering, and blocking potentially harmful HTTP traffic. This 
includes protection against threats like XSS and SQL injection 
attacks that are common against web applications. 
Option A is incorrect. While a Stateful Packet Inspection 
Firewall can monitor the state of active connections and make 
decisions based on the context of the traffic, it doesn’t 
specifically address application layer vulnerabilities like XSS 
and SQL injection. 
Option B is incorrect. Although a Proxy Firewall can provide 
some application layer filtering, its primary purpose is not 
	
 
993

tailored to protect against specific web application 
vulnerabilities. 
Option C is incorrect. A Network Layer Firewall primarily 
operates at the network layer and won’t provide specialized 
protection against application layer threats. 
Question 144. A financial institution wants to enhance the 
security of its wired network. The goal is to ensure that only 
authorized devices can connect to the network, and the 
authentication process should be based on credentials or digital 
certificates. Which of the following protocols would best serve 
this purpose? 
 (A)   	
SNMPv3 
 (B)   	
SSL/TLS 
 (C)   	
802.1X EAP 
 (D)   	
DHCP 
Explanation 144. Correct Answer: C. 802.1X EAP. 802.1X 
Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides port-based 
network access control and is used on wired networks to ensure 
that only authenticated devices can connect. It supports multiple 
authentication methods including credentials, digital 
certificates, and smart cards. 
Option A is incorrect. SNMPv3 (Simple Network Management 
Protocol version 3) is used for network management and 
monitoring, not for port-based network access control. 
Option B is incorrect. SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/
Transport Layer Security) is a protocol used for securing data 
	
 
994

transmission on the internet, not for port-based network access 
control. 
Option D is incorrect. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration 
Protocol) assigns IP addresses to devices on a network but 
doesn’t deal with port-based authentication. 
Question 145. An organization is evaluating different security 
solutions for their new branch office. They want to ensure that 
the chosen solution can be rapidly deployed with minimal 
configuration. Which of the following options BEST fulfills this 
requirement? 
 (A)   	
A customized Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) 
tailored to the organization's unique needs 
 (B)   	
A zero-touch provisioning firewall 
 (C)   	
An open-source firewall with extensive manual 
settings 
 (D)   	
A security information and event management 
(SIEM) solution requiring manual log source integration 
Explanation 145. Correct Answer: B. A zero-touch 
provisioning firewall. Zero-touch provisioning allows devices 
to be provisioned and configured automatically, ensuring rapid 
deployment with minimal manual intervention. 
Option A is incorrect. While a customized IPS might be 
tailored for the organization’s needs, it often requires a lot of 
configuration and isn’t the fastest to deploy. 
	
 
995

Option C is incorrect. Open-source firewalls that require 
extensive manual settings are not considered rapid to deploy as 
they necessitate more time for configuration. 
Option D is incorrect. A SIEM solution that requires manual 
log source integration would not be the quickest to deploy due 
to the manual steps involved. 
Question 146. A company named TechFlow is planning to 
produce a new line of smart home devices. They have opted to 
use a single supplier for a crucial component in their devices. 
Which of the following represents the MOST significant 
security risk associated with this decision? 
 (A)   	
It will be challenging to negotiate prices with just one 
supplier 
 (B)   	
If the supplier's delivery timeline is delayed, product 
launch might be postponed 
 (C)   	
A compromise at the supplier could lead to 
vulnerabilities in all devices 
 (D)   	
TechFlow will need to rely on the supplier's warranty 
and return policies 
Explanation 146. Correct Answer: C. A compromise at the 
supplier could lead to vulnerabilities in all devices. Relying 
on a single supplier means that any security issues at that 
supplier’s end might translate directly into vulnerabilities in 
every device using that component. 
In a supply chain, the security of every entity is paramount. If 
one supplier gets compromised, and the company relies solely 
on that supplier for a crucial component, every product using 
	
 
996

that component might be vulnerable. This could have 
widespread implications for the security of the end-users and 
damage the company’s reputation. 
Option A is incorrect. Price negotiation is a business concern 
and not directly related to the security implications of using a 
single supplier. 
Option B is incorrect. While delivery delays can have business 
implications, they don’t represent a direct security risk. 
Option D is incorrect. Warranty and return policies are 
operational considerations but aren’t the primary security risks 
associated with relying on a single supplier. 
Question 147. The security team of a multinational company 
deployed a network of honeypots globally, making it appear as 
an interconnected and realistic environment. They aim to study 
coordinated multi-stage attacks. This deceptive setup is known 
as: 
 (A)   	
Firewall Cluster 
 (B)   	
Virtual LAN (VLAN) 
 (C)   	
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Prevention 
 (D)   	
Honeynet 
Explanation 147. Correct Answer: D. Honeynet. A honeynet 
is essentially a network of honeypots. It is designed to be 
attractive to attackers, making them believe they are attacking a 
real network, while in reality, they are being observed, and their 
tactics and techniques are being analyzed. 
	
 
997

Option A is incorrect. A Firewall Cluster is a group of 
firewalls operating together to increase reliability and 
performance. It doesn’t serve as a decoy to attract attackers. 
Option B is incorrect. A Virtual LAN (VLAN) is a network 
protocol used to create logically segmented networks within a 
physical network, improving performance and security. It’s not 
a decoy system. 
Option C is incorrect. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) 
Prevention solutions focus on identifying and mitigating large-
scale attempts to disrupt network service availability. They do 
not present a deceptive environment for attackers. 
Question 148. David, an IT administrator, noticed an unusually 
high data usage on several company-owned mobile devices 
even when they are connected to the corporate Wi-Fi. He 
suspects these devices might be using cellular data in the 
background. Which of the following solutions should David 
implement to ensure that company devices use only the 
corporate Wi-Fi for data transactions when they’re in the office? 
 (A)   	
Enable Airplane mode on all devices 
 (B)   	
Set up a Wi-Fi whitelist 
 (C) 	  Implement a mobile device management (MDM) 
policy to prioritize Wi-Fi 
 (D)   	
Disable cellular antennas in the office area 
Explanation 148. Correct Answer: C. Implement a mobile 
device management (MDM) policy to prioritize Wi-Fi. An 
MDM solution allows administrators to enforce policies on 
mobile devices. By implementing a policy that prioritizes Wi-Fi 
	
 
998

connections, David can ensure that company devices will use 
the corporate Wi-Fi network when available, thus reducing 
cellular data usage. 
Option A is incorrect. While enabling Airplane mode would 
cut off cellular data, it would also disable all other forms of 
communication including Wi-Fi, making the device unusable 
for its intended purposes. 
Option B is incorrect. Setting up a Wi-Fi whitelist does not 
prevent a device from using cellular data. It only restricts which 
Wi-Fi networks a device can connect to. 
Option D is incorrect. Disabling cellular antennas is a drastic 
measure that could affect other devices and services in the 
vicinity. It’s also impractical and potentially illegal depending 
on local regulations. 
Question 149. A university is looking to revamp its wireless 
network to provide secure access for students and faculty. The 
IT department wants an authentication method that leverages a 
centralized server to validate user credentials and can integrate 
with their existing directory service. Which authentication 
protocol should they consider? 
 (A)   	
Pre-shared Key (PSK) 
 (B)   	
Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol 
(LEAP) 
 (C)  	
 Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport 
Layer Security (EAP-TLS) 
 (D)   	
Shared Secret Challenge 
	
 
999

Explanation 149. Correct Answer: C. Extensible 
Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP-
TLS). EAP-TLS provides strong security by using digital 
certificates to authenticate both the client and the server. It 
operates in conjunction with a RADIUS server, allowing for 
centralized management of user credentials and seamless 
integration with existing directory services. 
Option A is incorrect. Pre-shared Key (PSK) does not involve 
a centralized server for authentication. Instead, a single shared 
key is used for all devices, which may not be scalable or secure 
for a large university setting. 
Option B is incorrect. While LEAP provides centralized 
authentication via a RADIUS server, it has known 
vulnerabilities and may not offer the level of security the 
university is looking for. 
Option D is incorrect. Shared Secret Challenge is not a 
standard wireless authentication protocol. In practice, 
challenges based on shared secrets (like PSK) can be vulnerable 
if the secret becomes known. 
Question 150. A university is looking to revamp its wireless 
network to provide secure access for students and faculty. The 
IT department wants an authentication method that leverages a 
centralized server to validate user credentials and can integrate 
with their existing directory service. Which authentication 
protocol should they consider? 
 (A)   	
Pre-shared Key (PSK) 
 (B)   	
Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol 
	
 
1000

(LEAP) 
 (C)  	
 Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport 
Layer Security (EAP-TLS) 
 (D)   	
Shared Secret Challenge 
Explanation 150. Correct Answer: C. Extensible 
Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP-
TLS). EAP-TLS provides strong security by using digital 
certificates to authenticate both the client and the server. It 
operates in conjunction with a RADIUS server, allowing for 
centralized management of user credentials and seamless 
integration with existing directory services. 
Option A is incorrect. Pre-shared Key (PSK) does not involve 
a centralized server for authentication. Instead, a single shared 
key is used for all devices, which may not be scalable or secure 
for a large university setting. 
Option B is incorrect. While LEAP provides centralized 
authentication via a RADIUS server, it has known 
vulnerabilities and may not offer the level of security the 
university is looking for. 
Option D is incorrect. Shared Secret Challenge is not a 
standard wireless authentication protocol. In practice, 
challenges based on shared secrets (like PSK) can be vulnerable 
if the secret becomes known. 
Question 151. CyberGuard LLC, a cybersecurity firm, is in a 
stable position in its industry with consistent returns. The 
leadership decides not to pursue aggressive growth strategies 
	
 
1001

but instead chooses to maintain its current market share and 
operational scale. They are open to minor risks but avoid major 
disruptions. How can one best describe CyberGuard LLC’s risk 
appetite? 
 (A)   	
Expansionary 
 (B)   	
Neutral 
 (C)   	
Conservative 
 (D)   	
Aggressive 
Explanation 151. Correct Answer: B. Neutral. A neutral risk 
appetite means an organization is neither aggressively pursuing 
risks for high rewards nor entirely avoiding them. Given that 
CyberGuard LLC is looking to maintain its current position and 
is open to minor risks, their risk appetite can be classified as 
neutral. 
Option A is incorrect. Expansionary risk appetite denotes an 
organization’s willingness to accept higher risks to achieve 
potentially higher rewards, which doesn’t align with 
CyberGuard LLC’s strategy. 
Option C is incorrect. While CyberGuard LLC is cautious, 
their stance is not entirely against taking risks. A conservative 
appetite would imply they avoid most risks, but they are open to 
minor ones. 
Option D is incorrect. Aggressive would imply a strong 
willingness to take on significant risks, which is not the stance 
described for CyberGuard LLC. 
	
 
1002

Question 152. After a series of cyber-attacks on a company’s 
infrastructure, the IT team decided to deploy a solution that 
would seem like a legitimate part of their network but is 
intentionally isolated and monitored. They intend to detect and 
analyze malicious activities in this isolated environment. What 
technology are they most likely implementing? 
 (A)   	
Network segmentation 
 (B)   	
Honeypot 
 (C)   	
DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) 
 (D)   	
Sandboxing 
Explanation 152. Correct Answer: B. Honeypot. A honeypot 
is intentionally set up to appear as a legitimate part of a 
network, but it is isolated and closely monitored. Its purpose is 
to attract attackers and observe their actions, thereby providing 
insights into potential threats and the methods employed by 
adversaries. 
Option A is incorrect. Network segmentation involves dividing 
a network into smaller sub-networks. While this can enhance 
security by limiting attackers’ access to specific segments, it 
doesn’t act as a decoy to attract attackers. 
Option C is incorrect. A DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) is a 
subnet that acts as a buffer between the internet and an 
organization’s internal network. While it can contain servers 
accessible to external users, its primary purpose is not to act as a 
decoy but to provide a layer of protection. 
Option D is incorrect. Sandboxing is a security mechanism 
that allows programs to run in a separate environment to 
	
 
1003

prevent them from affecting the broader system. It’s used for 
testing and analyzing potentially malicious software, not for 
luring attackers. 
Question 153. Your organization is considering a partnership 
with TechVendor Inc., a software solution provider. Before 
finalizing the agreement, you wish to ensure their application’s 
security. What would be the most direct method to assess the 
robustness of their system against potential cyber threats? 
 (A)   	
Conducting an internal security awareness training 
 (B)   	
Reviewing their past audit reports 
 (C)   	
Implementing strict firewall rules 
 (D)   	
Performing a penetration test on their application. 
Explanation 153. Correct Answer: D. Performing a 
penetration test on their application. Penetration testing is a 
proactive method used to evaluate the security of an application 
by simulating an attack from malicious outsiders or insiders. It 
provides a direct measure of the vulnerabilities present in the 
application that could potentially be exploited by an attacker. 
Option A is incorrect. While security awareness training is 
crucial for educating staff about security best practices, it does 
not directly assess the security of an external vendor’s 
application. 
Option B is incorrect. Past audit reports can provide valuable 
insights into a vendor’s security posture, but they do not offer 
real-time assessment like penetration testing. 
	
 
1004

Option C is incorrect. Implementing firewall rules is a 
protective measure, but it does not evaluate the current security 
of the vendor’s application. 
Question 154. An e-commerce platform recently suffered a data 
breach where attackers exploited cookies to impersonate user 
sessions. A security analyst is tasked with recommending 
measures to secure user cookies. Which of the following 
measures will ensure that cookies are transmitted securely 
between the user’s browser and the server? 
 (A)   	
Storing cookies in the database 
 (B)   	
Implementing the "Secure" attribute for cookies 
 (C)   	
Increasing the cookie expiration time 
 (D)   	
Base64 encoding the cookie content 
Explanation 154. Correct Answer: B. Implementing the 
“Secure” attribute for cookies. The “Secure” attribute ensures 
that a cookie is only sent over secure, encrypted HTTPS 
connections. By implementing this attribute, the cookie won’t 
be transmitted over unencrypted HTTP connections, reducing 
the risk of interception by malicious actors. 
Option A is incorrect. Storing cookies in the database doesn’t 
necessarily secure the transmission of cookies between the 
client and server. It’s more about storage security rather than 
transmission security. 
Option C is incorrect. Increasing the cookie expiration time 
can actually increase the window of opportunity for an attacker 
to exploit a cookie, making it a less secure practice. 
	
 
1005

Option D is incorrect. Base64 encoding is not encryption; it’s 
just a way to represent binary data in an ASCII string format. 
Encoding can be easily reversed, offering little to no security. 
Question 155. An organization has recently received a new 
software patch for its critical infrastructure. Before deploying it 
to production, the security team wants to understand its 
behavior and ensure it doesn’t contain any malicious code. 
Which of the following methods would be MOST effective for 
safely executing and observing the patch’s behavior? 
 (A)   	
Deploying the patch during a maintenance window 
 (B)       Running the patch within a sandbox environment 
 (C)   	
Conducting a code review of the patch 
 (D)   	
Installing the patch on a virtual machine 
Explanation 155. Correct Answer: B. Running the patch 
within a sandbox environment. Running the patch within a 
sandbox environment allows the security team to execute and 
observe the software’s behavior in an isolated environment, 
ensuring it doesn’t interfere with or harm the actual production 
environment. 
Option A is incorrect. Deploying the patch during a 
maintenance window reduces operational disruptions but 
doesn’t allow for safe observation of the patch’s behavior. 
Option C is incorrect. While a code review can identify 
potential security concerns in the patch, it may not reveal the 
actual behavior when executed. 
	
 
1006

Option D is incorrect. Installing the patch on a virtual machine 
is a form of isolation, but a sandbox provides a more controlled 
and restrictive environment specifically designed for observing 
software behavior. 
Question 156. A recently hired security analyst at CyberTech 
Inc. wants to get a better understanding of the organization’s 
network infrastructure. Which of the following activities would 
provide a LIST of servers, workstations, printers, switches, and 
routers currently active in the network? 
 (A)   	
Vulnerability Scanning 
 (B)   	
Intrusion Detection 
 (C)   	
Network Enumeration 
 (D)   	
Penetration Testing 
Explanation 156. Correct Answer: C. Network 
Enumeration. Network enumeration is the process of 
identifying devices on a network. Through enumeration, an 
analyst can gather information about network devices, their 
types, and other attributes, thereby getting a clearer picture of 
the network’s infrastructure. 
Option A is incorrect. Vulnerability scanning aims to identify 
vulnerabilities in network devices and systems, not necessarily 
to list all active devices. 
Option B is incorrect. Intrusion detection focuses on 
monitoring network traffic for malicious activities and potential 
security breaches. 
	
 
1007

Option D is incorrect. Penetration testing aims to exploit 
vulnerabilities in a network to determine its security posture, 
not to list all active devices. 
Question 157. Tech Enterprises is planning to release a new 
product. As part of the product’s creation, they’ve sourced 
components from various vendors. The security team is tasked 
with assessing risks linked to the supply chain. Which of the 
following is the MOST concerning risk when sourcing 
components from multiple vendors? 
 (A)   	
Difficulty in tracking product warranty details from 
multiple vendors 
 (B)   	
Increased product assembly time due to varied vendor 
delivery timelines 
 (C)   	
Potential for introduction of insecure or 
compromised components 
 (D)   	
The need for multiple purchase orders, leading to 
increased paperwork 
Explanation 157. Correct Answer: C. Potential for 
introduction of insecure or compromised components. When 
components are sourced from multiple vendors, there is a 
heightened risk that one or more components might have 
vulnerabilities or could be compromised, thus impacting the 
security of the overall product. 
The integrity and security of components are vital in product 
development, especially when those components are part of the 
supply chain from various vendors. If one vendor has lax 
security measures or gets compromised, the components they 
supply can introduce vulnerabilities into the finished product, 
	
 
1008

affecting its overall security posture and potentially leading to 
data breaches or other cyber threats. 
Option A is incorrect. While tracking warranties is an 
operational concern, it doesn’t pose a direct security risk when 
sourcing components from multiple vendors. 
Option B is incorrect. Product assembly time and vendor 
delivery timelines are logistical and operational concerns, not 
primary security risks associated with supply chain vendors. 
Option D is incorrect. Managing multiple purchase orders is a 
business process challenge, not a primary security concern. 
Question 158. John, a security analyst, noticed an increase in 
unauthorized devices connecting to the company’s wireless 
network. To identify the reason, he realized that the wireless 
access points were still using an old encryption standard. Which 
outdated encryption standard is likely in use that is known to be 
easily compromised? 
 (A)   	
WPA3 
 (B)   	
WEP 
 (C)   	
WPA2-PSK 
 (D)   	
AES 
Explanation 158. Correct Answer: B. WEP. Wired Equivalent 
Privacy (WEP) is an old and outdated encryption protocol for 
wireless networks. It has several known vulnerabilities and is 
considered insecure, making it easier for attackers to 
compromise. 
	
 
1009

Option A is incorrect. WPA3 is a newer and more secure 
encryption protocol for wireless networks and is considered a 
significant improvement over previous standards. 
Option C is incorrect. WPA2-PSK (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 
with Pre-Shared Key) is more secure than WEP. While it can 
still be targeted, it is not as easily compromised as WEP. 
Option D is incorrect. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is 
an encryption standard and not a wireless encryption protocol. It 
is often used within WPA2 and WPA3 for securing wireless 
data. 
Question 159. After being fired from his position as a senior 
network administrator at XYZ Corp, John discovered a 
backdoor into the company’s main server that he had previously 
set up. He then initiated a series of Distributed Denial of 
Service (DDoS) attacks over a month. What is the most 
probable motivation behind John’s actions? 
 (A)   	
Ethical concerns about the company's data handling 
 (B)   	
Financial gain by selling access to the backdoor 
 (C)   	
Desire to research and find vulnerabilities for personal 
growth 
 (D)  	
 Revenge against the company for his termination 
Explanation 159. Correct Answer: D. Revenge against the 
company for his termination. Given that John acted after 
being fired and initiated disruptive attacks, it’s evident that his 
actions were motivated by a desire for revenge against his 
former employer. 
	
 
1010

Option A is incorrect. There’s no indication in the scenario that 
John had ethical concerns regarding the company’s data 
practices. 
Option B is incorrect. The scenario doesn’t mention John 
selling access to the backdoor, only that he initiated DDoS 
attacks. 
Option C is incorrect. John’s actions after termination seem 
malicious rather than a pursuit of knowledge or research. 
Question 160. TechBank has just opened a new branch in the 
city center. Due to its location, the management is concerned 
about potential vehicular attacks on the facility. Which of the 
following physical security measures can TechBank employ to 
specifically deter such attacks? 
 (A)   	
Surveillance Cameras 
 (B)   	
Bollards 
 (C)   	
Access Badges 
 (D)   	
Security Guards 
Explanation 160. Correct Answer: B. Bollards. Bollards are 
short, sturdy vertical posts that are typically used to control road 
traffic. In the context of physical security, they serve to prevent 
vehicles from entering areas where they are not allowed, 
thereby acting as a deterrent against potential vehicular attacks. 
Option A is incorrect. While surveillance cameras can monitor 
and record activities, they do not serve as a physical barrier 
against vehicular attacks. 
	
 
1011

Option C is incorrect. Access badges control personnel access 
to facilities but do not deter vehicular attacks. 
Option D is incorrect. While security guards can respond to 
threats and control access, they are not a specific measure to 
deter vehicular attacks like bollards. 
Question 161. A financial organization’s high-security data 
center has an authentication system for its main entry. If the 
system encounters an unexpected error, the organization wants 
to ensure that no one can gain access to the data center until the 
system is fixed. Which configuration should the authentication 
system be set to? 
 (A)   	
Fail-open 
 (B)   	
Fail-closed 
 (C)   	
Fail-secure 
 (D)   	
Fail-passive 
Explanation 161. Correct Answer: B. Fail-closed. Fail-
closed, also known as fail-secure, is a mode where if a system 
fails, it denies all requests by default, effectively “closing” 
access. In high-security environments, it’s often preferred to 
prevent any unauthorized access during system failures. 
Option A is incorrect. Fail-open is the opposite of what the 
organization wants. In a fail-open scenario, if the system fails, it 
would allow all requests by default. 
Option C is incorrect. While “fail-secure” is another term for 
“fail-closed”, the use of both terms in the options can confuse 
	
 
1012

the test-taker. In this context, option B is the more appropriate 
choice. 
Option D is incorrect. Fail-passive isn’t a standard term in the 
context of authentication failure modes. Fail-open and fail-
closed (or fail-secure) are the primary recognized terms. 
Question 162. CyberSecure Inc. is evaluating the financial 
impact of a potential security breach on its main server. The 
company has estimated that a breach of this server would lead 
to a direct financial loss of $500,000 due to data recovery, legal 
fees, and fines. Which of the following best represents this 
estimation? 
 (A)   	
Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO) 
 (B)   	
Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) 
 (C)   	
Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) 
 (D)   	
Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) 
Explanation 162. Correct Answer: C. Single Loss 
Expectancy (SLE). The Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) 
represents the expected monetary loss every time a risk occurs. 
In this case, the company is estimating the direct financial loss 
from a single breach event. 
Option A is incorrect. The Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO) 
represents how often the event is expected to occur in a year, 
not the cost of a single event. 
Option B is incorrect. Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) refers to 
the complete cost of owning a particular asset or solution over 
its lifecycle, not the cost of a single event. 
	
 
1013

Option D is incorrect. The Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) 
is a calculated value that represents the expected annual loss, 
based on the SLE and the ARO. 
Question 163. A large e-commerce company wants to ensure 
that their newly developed application is free from any code 
vulnerabilities before it is deployed to the production 
environment. They want to catch any software flaws, especially 
those that might lead to potential security risks. Which of the 
following methodologies should they employ? 
 (A)   	
Runtime application self-protection (RASP) 
 (B)   	
Penetration testing on the live application 
 (C)   	
Static code analysis 
 (D)   	
User acceptance testing (UAT) 
Explanation 163. Correct Answer: C. Static code analysis. 
Static code analysis involves analyzing the application’s code 
without executing it, focusing on detecting vulnerabilities, 
coding flaws, or other potential security threats, making it an 
appropriate methodology for the scenario presented. 
Option A is incorrect. Runtime application self-protection 
(RASP) is about real-time application monitoring and 
protection, which would not be the primary choice for pre-
deployment vulnerability checks. 
Option B is incorrect. Penetration testing on the live 
application involves testing the application once it is live or 
running, which might not be suitable when looking to identify 
vulnerabilities in the pre-deployment phase. 
	
 
1014

Option D is incorrect. User acceptance testing (UAT) focuses 
on determining if the software meets the business needs and 
functions correctly for the end-users. It does not emphasize 
finding security vulnerabilities. 
Question 164. In the new branch of BankSecure, the 
management has decided to install a security system at the main 
entrance that forces visitors to go through two separate 
authorization checks before entering the main premises. Which 
physical security measure should they consider? 
 (A)   	
Turnstiles 
 (B)   	
Security Guards 
 (C)   	
Access Control Vestibule 
 (D)   	
Keycard Readers 
Explanation 164. Correct Answer: C. Access Control 
Vestibule. An access control vestibule, often referred to as a 
mantrap, is a two-stage authentication system. It consists of two 
doors: a person enters the first door, undergoes an authorization 
check (like a badge reader or biometric scanner), and only after 
being approved can they proceed to the second door, where they 
undergo another authorization check before accessing the main 
premises. 
Option A is incorrect. Turnstiles control the flow of individuals 
into a location and can prevent tailgating to some extent, but 
they do not force a two-stage authorization check. 
Option B is incorrect. While security guards can perform 
authorization checks and control access, they alone do not 
	
 
1015

provide a two-stage authorization system like an access control 
vestibule. 
Option D is incorrect. Keycard readers are a form of access 
control that checks the credentials of individuals, but on their 
own, they don’t ensure two separate authorization checks. 
Question 165. XYZ Corporation recently implemented a 
security solution that constantly evaluates the company’s threat 
landscape, monitoring for emerging risks and immediately 
alerting the security team of any changes. This assessment 
model allows the team to rapidly adapt their security posture in 
response to live threats. What type of risk assessment is XYZ 
Corporation utilizing? 
 (A)   	
One-time 
 (B)   	
Periodic 
 (C)   	
Dynamic 
 (D)   	
Continuous 
Explanation 165. Correct Answer: D. Continuous. 
Continuous risk assessments involve ongoing and real-time 
monitoring of risks, enabling an organization to instantly react 
to emerging threats and vulnerabilities. 
Option A is incorrect. A one-time risk assessment is specific to 
a single event or purpose and is not intended to be repeated 
regularly. 
Option B is incorrect. Periodic risk assessments are carried out 
at scheduled intervals, such as annually or biannually, and are 
not ongoing. 
	
 
1016

Option C is incorrect. Dynamic assessments can adapt to 
changing environments or factors, but “dynamic” doesn’t 
specifically denote ongoing, real-time assessment like 
“continuous” does. 
Question 166. A software development company is evaluating 
the risks associated with a newly discovered vulnerability in its 
application. After reviewing logs and simulating potential 
attacks, the security team estimates that there is a 0.25 
probability of the vulnerability being exploited in the next year. 
What does this probability indicate? 
 (A)  	
 The vulnerability has a 1 in 4 chance of being 
exploited in the next year 
 (B)   	
The vulnerability will certainly be exploited four 
times in the next year 
 (C)   	
The vulnerability has been exploited 25 times in the 
past year 
 (D)   	
Every fourth customer will exploit the vulnerability. 
Explanation 166. Correct Answer: A. The vulnerability has 
a 1 in 4 chance of being exploited in the next year. A 
probability of 0.25 indicates a 25% chance, or a 1 in 4 
likelihood, of an event occurring. 
Option B is incorrect. A probability value doesn’t predict a 
definite number of occurrences, just the likelihood of an 
occurrence. 
Option C is incorrect. The probability figure given is an 
estimate of future risk, not a tally of past events. 
	
 
1017

Option D is incorrect. The probability provided is not about 
customers but about the chance of the vulnerability being 
exploited. 
Question 167. During a routine scan, the security team at a 
graphic design firm discovers that an employee downloaded an 
image from an email and subsequently, unusual network traffic 
was detected originating from that employee’s workstation. The 
image appeared normal when opened. What type of attack 
might have been used in this situation? 
 (A)   	
Image Steganography Malware 
 (B)   	
Password Brute Force 
 (C)   	
Phishing 
 (D)   	
Port Scanning 
Explanation 167. Correct Answer: A. Image Steganography 
Malware. Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, 
message, image, or video within another file, message, image, 
or video. Image steganography specifically involves hiding 
malicious code within an image. When the image is downloaded 
or opened, the malicious code can be executed without the 
victim’s knowledge. 
Option B is incorrect. Password Brute Force is an attack 
method where an attacker attempts to guess a user’s password 
by systematically trying every possible combination of letters, 
numbers, and symbols until the correct password is discovered. 
Option C is incorrect. Phishing typically involves deceptive 
emails or messages attempting to trick recipients into divulging 
sensitive information. While images can be used in phishing 
	
 
1018

attempts, the scenario described does not indicate an attempt to 
extract information from the employee. 
Option D is incorrect. Port Scanning is an attempt to discover 
open ports on a computer, which can reveal services running on 
those ports. It does not involve the use of images. 
Question 168. TechSoft Corp. is implementing a new asset-
tracking system to monitor its vast array of computing 
resources. Which of the following should be the PRIMARY 
reason for maintaining an up-to-date hardware and software 
inventory? 
 (A)   	
To ensure software licenses are renewed on time 
 (B)   	
To identify and respond to unauthorized devices or 
software promptly 
 (C)   	
To aid in the procurement of new hardware and 
software 
 (D)   	
To provide employees with an understanding of 
available resources 
Explanation 168. Correct Answer: B. To identify and 
respond to unauthorized devices or software promptly. 
While all the options have valid reasons for maintaining an 
inventory, from a security standpoint, identifying unauthorized 
devices or software promptly is crucial. Unauthorized devices 
or software can pose a significant security risk, including 
potential data breaches or malware infections. 
Option A is incorrect. While renewing software licenses is 
important, it’s not the primary security reason for maintaining 
an inventory. 
	
 
1019

Option C is incorrect. Procurement decisions benefit from 
inventory data but do not directly impact immediate security 
concerns in the way that identifying unauthorized assets does. 
Option D is incorrect. While providing employees with 
resource understanding is beneficial, it isn’t as crucial for 
security as promptly identifying unauthorized assets. 
Question 169. Acme Corp, a large organization, has recently 
entered into a contract with Zenith MSP for IT management and 
support. The CISO of Acme Corp is concerned about the 
security risks associated with this new relationship. Which of 
the following is the PRIMARY security concern when utilizing 
managed service providers (MSPs) in a supply chain? 
 (A)   	
Increased costs due to the integration of new 
technologies 
 (B)   	
Difficulty in ensuring consistent patch management 
 (C)   	
Potential for unauthorized access to company 
resources 
 (D)   	
Decreased IT staff morale due to outsourcing 
Explanation 169. Correct Answer: C. Potential for 
unauthorized access to company resources. Managed Service 
Providers usually have elevated privileges to provide their 
services, potentially making them a prime target for attackers. A 
breach at the MSP level can lead to unauthorized access to their 
client’s resources. 
When a company engages with an MSP, that provider typically 
has access to critical systems, data, and network infrastructure 
to deliver their services. If the MSP is compromised, this can 
	
 
1020

lead to a cascading effect where client systems and data are also 
vulnerable. It is imperative for companies to ensure their MSPs 
have robust security postures to prevent unauthorized access. 
Option A is incorrect. While cost considerations are important 
in business decisions, they are not a direct security risk posed 
by MSPs in a supply chain. 
Option B is incorrect. Though ensuring consistent patch 
management is a legitimate concern, the primary risk is 
unauthorized access through the MSP, which might have 
extensive privileges. 
Option D is incorrect. While IT staff morale is a valid 
organizational concern when outsourcing, it is not the primary 
security risk associated with MSPs. 
Question 170. Mike, an employee at a tech company, receives 
an instant message from a coworker named Jessica. The 
message contains a link and claims to showcase a hilarious 
video. However, Mike knows Jessica is on vacation. He 
suspects the message might not genuinely be from her. What 
type of threat is Mike most likely encountering? 
 (A)   	
Watering Hole Attack 
 (B)   	
Man-in-the-Middle Attack 
 (C)   	
IM Spoofing 
 (D)   	
Side-channel Attack 
Explanation 170. Correct Answer: C. IM Spoofing. IM 
Spoofing occurs when an attacker sends messages to a system 
that appear to come from a trusted source, typically a known 
	
 
1021

contact. By pretending to be someone the victim knows, the 
attacker can deceive the victim into opening a malicious link or 
sharing confidential information. 
Option A is incorrect. A Watering Hole Attack is where the 
attacker guesses or observes which websites the group often 
uses and infects one or more of them with malware. 
Option B is incorrect. A Man-in-the-Middle Attack involves 
the attacker secretly intercepting and relaying communication 
between two parties. The attacker makes independent 
connections with the victims and relays messages between 
them. 
Option D is incorrect. A Side-channel Attack is based on 
information gained from the implementation of a computer 
system, rather than weaknesses in the implemented algorithm 
itself. 
Question 171. At a newly established museum, management 
wants to install sensors in the exhibit rooms to detect any 
unauthorized movement after hours. The rooms are often filled 
with a mix of air conditioning and external noise from the city. 
Which sensor would be BEST suited to detect movement in 
such conditions without being affected by the noise? 
 (A)   	
Acoustic sensors 
 (B)   	
Glass break detectors 
 (C)   	
Ultrasonic sensors 
 (D)   	
Thermal imaging cameras 
	
 
1022

Explanation 171. Correct Answer: C. Ultrasonic sensors. 
Ultrasonic sensors emit high-frequency sound waves to detect 
motion. These sound waves are beyond the range of human 
hearing and won’t be affected by ambient noise, making them 
ideal for environments with varying noise conditions. When 
motion is detected, as indicated by changes in the reflected 
waves, an alarm is triggered. 
Option A is incorrect. Acoustic sensors detect specific sounds. 
The external noise from the city might cause false alarms or 
interfere with their detection capabilities. 
Option B is incorrect. Glass break detectors are designed to 
detect the sound or vibration of breaking glass. They aren’t 
designed primarily to detect movement. 
Option D is incorrect. Thermal imaging cameras detect heat 
signatures and would be more susceptible to variations in room 
temperature due to air conditioning, potentially leading to false 
detections. 
Question 172. A global e-commerce company maintains a risk 
register to keep track of identified risks and to monitor specific 
metrics that might indicate an increased risk level. Recently, 
there has been a 20% increase in abandoned shopping carts on 
their platform. How should this metric be categorized in the 
context of the risk register? 
 (A)   	
Risk Appetite 
 (B)   	
Risk Mitigation Strategy 
 (C) 	        Key Risk Indicator (KRI) 
 (D)   	
Risk Tolerance Threshold 
	
 
1023

Explanation 172. Correct Answer: C. Key Risk Indicator 
(KRI). Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) are metrics used to measure 
and provide an early signal of increasing risk exposures in 
various areas of an organization. In this scenario, the 20% 
increase in abandoned shopping carts can serve as a KRI, 
signaling potential issues like site performance, security 
concerns, or user experience that may need to be addressed. 
Option A is incorrect. Risk appetite refers to the amount of risk 
an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives. 
The increase in abandoned carts doesn’t measure this. 
Option B is incorrect. A risk mitigation strategy describes 
actions an organization plans to take to address risks. The 
metric provided is a measure, not an action or strategy. 
Option D is incorrect. Risk tolerance threshold indicates the 
amount of risk an organization is willing to tolerate. The 
scenario describes a metric that might indicate an issue, not a 
predefined threshold. 
Question 173. An IT security analyst at a multinational 
corporation receives an email from the “HR Department” 
requesting urgent verification of his personal details, including 
his home address and social security number. The email has the 
company’s logo but has several spelling errors. Which type of 
email-based threat is this email most likely representing? 
 (A)   	
Business Email Compromise (BEC) 
 (B)   	
Email bombing 
 (C)   	
Email forwarding 
 (D)   	
Phishing 
	
 
1024

Explanation 173. Correct Answer: D. Phishing. Phishing 
emails aim to deceive recipients into sharing personal or 
sensitive data by impersonating a trusted source. The email’s 
dubious quality, such as spelling errors, combined with the 
request for personal details, is indicative of a typical phishing 
attempt. 
Option A is incorrect. While BEC is a type of targeted scam 
using email, it usually involves impersonating executives or 
high-ranking officials within an organization to initiate 
unauthorized fund transfers. The described scenario does not 
align with that. 
Option B is incorrect. Email bombing involves sending large 
volumes of emails to a single recipient, typically to overwhelm 
the system or hide other malicious activities. This scenario does 
not describe such an attack. 
Option C is incorrect. Email forwarding refers to the 
automated redirection of email from one address to another. It is 
not a direct threat in itself but can be misused. The described 
scenario does not align with that. 
Question 174. TechSoft Corp, a mid-sized software 
development firm, is relocating its main office to a new 
building. The management is concerned about potential threats 
after hours, particularly due to the increasing reports of cyber-
espionage. They are evaluating different security measures. 
Which option would provide an immediate physical presence 
and deterrence during non-business hours? 
 (A)   	
CCTV with motion detection 
	
 
1025

 (B)   	
Retinal scan at all entrances 
 (C)   	
Security guard presence 
 (D)   	
Reinforced doors and windows 
Explanation 174. Correct Answer: C. Security guard 
presence. A security guard provides a visible deterrent and 
immediate physical presence. This human element is invaluable 
in situations where an immediate response to threats, deterrence 
of potential intruders, or evaluation of suspicious activities is 
required, especially during non-business hours. 
Option A is incorrect. While CCTV with motion detection can 
monitor and alert on movement, it doesn’t provide the 
immediate human response and deterrence a security guard 
does. 
Option B is incorrect. A retinal scan is an authentication 
mechanism for controlling access. While it offers high security, 
it doesn’t offer the visible deterrence or immediate response of a 
security guard. 
Option D is incorrect. Reinforced doors and windows enhance 
the physical security of a building, but they don’t provide an 
active and visible human deterrence like a security guard. 
Question 175. A multinational corporation has data centers 
located in different countries. Due to regulatory constraints, 
remote access to these data centers is highly restricted. The 
company’s IT administrators need a centralized way to access 
all data centers securely without directly accessing them from 
their workstations. Which solution should the company 
	
 
1026

consider? 
 (A)   	
Setting up a DMZ 
 (B)  	
 Implementing a Jump server 
 (C)   	
Deploying an Active Directory 
 (D)   	
Using a local Proxy 
Explanation 176. Correct Answer: B. Implementing a Jump 
server. A Jump server, also known as a bastion host, acts as an 
intermediary server allowing users to connect to it before 
accessing another server or network. It provides a controlled 
means of access between two networks, such as an internal 
network and an external network. 
Option A is incorrect. A DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) is a 
physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an 
organization’s external-facing services to an untrusted network, 
usually the internet. It doesn’t provide a consolidated access 
point like a Jump server. 
Option C is incorrect. Active Directory is a directory service 
for Windows domain networks. It’s not designed to provide 
controlled remote access to multiple data centers. 
Option D is incorrect. A local Proxy might be used to control 
internet access or cache web content but doesn’t act as a 
centralized access point for data centers like a Jump server. 
Question 176. GammaTech is in the final stages of deploying a 
new application. Before the deployment, the security team 
wants to examine the application’s code without executing it to 
identify any potential vulnerabilities. Which vulnerability 
	
 
1027

identification method should the team employ? 
 (A)   	
Penetration Testing 
 (B)   	
Dynamic Analysis 
 (C)   	
Static Analysis 
 (D)   	
Fuzz Testing 
Explanation 176. Correct Answer: C. Static Analysis. Static 
analysis involves examining an application’s code, bytecode, or 
binary code without executing it to identify vulnerabilities. This 
method allows security teams to find potential security issues in 
the codebase before the application runs. 
Option A is incorrect. Penetration testing involves actively 
trying to exploit vulnerabilities in a system or application. It 
does not focus on code examination without execution. 
Option B is incorrect. Dynamic analysis examines an 
application during its runtime, observing its behavior to identify 
vulnerabilities. 
Option D is incorrect. Fuzz testing, or fuzzing, involves 
providing a program with a series of random inputs to see if any 
of them cause crashes or other unexpected behavior, helping 
identify vulnerabilities. 
Question 177. A cloud-based SaaS company wants to ensure its 
infrastructure can handle a potential influx of a large number of 
users in the future. Which of the following approaches would 
BEST meet this scalability consideration? 
 (A)  	
Implement a horizontal scaling strategy 
 (B)   	
Introduce multi-factor authentication 
	
 
1028

 (C)   	
Deploy deep packet inspection tools 
 (D)   	
Implement a centralized logging system 
Explanation 177. Correct Answer: A. Implement a 
horizontal scaling strategy. Horizontal scaling involves adding 
more machines or nodes to a system to handle increased load, 
which can be especially effective in a cloud environment. It 
allows the infrastructure to accommodate more users by 
distributing the load among multiple servers. 
Option B is incorrect. Multi-factor authentication is essential 
for security, but it does not address the scalability of the 
infrastructure to handle a large number of users. 
Option C is incorrect. Deep packet inspection tools are used 
for analyzing network traffic for security and management 
purposes, but they don’t directly enhance the scalability of an 
infrastructure. 
Option D is incorrect. Centralized logging systems help 
consolidate and analyze logs from various sources, but they do 
not address the scalability needs of the infrastructure itself. 
Question 178. WebServ Corp., a web hosting company, has 
been analyzing the reliability of its servers. They found that one 
of their server models, on average, tends to fail once every 2000 
hours and then gets promptly repaired. Which of the following 
metrics is WebServ Corp. evaluating? 
 (A)   	
Recovery Time Objective (RTO) 
 (B)   	
Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) 
	
 
1029

 (C)  	
 Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) 
 (D)   	
Recovery Point Objective (RPO) 
Explanation 178. Correct Answer: C. Mean Time Between 
Failures (MTBF). MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) is a 
measure of how reliable hardware or a system is. It’s the 
average time that passes from one failure to the next. For 
WebServ Corp., the 2000-hour duration between failures 
reflects the MTBF. 
Option A is incorrect. Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the 
targeted time and service level within which a business process 
must be restored after an interruption to avoid unacceptable 
losses. 
Option B is incorrect. Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) 
represents the average time needed to fix a failed component. 
Option D is incorrect. Recovery Point Objective (RPO) 
measures the amount of data that can be lost, in terms of time, 
without causing harm to the business continuity. 
Question 179. Sarah, an end-user, downloads a software update 
from a website. Before installing, she wants to make sure the 
software hasn’t been modified maliciously and that it originates 
from a trusted source. What should Sarah check to validate this? 
 (A)   	
The SSL certificate of the website 
 (B)  	
 The application's code signing certificate 
 (C)   	
The application's open-source repositories 
 (D)   	
The software's user reviews 
	
 
1030

Explanation 179. Correct Answer: B. The application’s code 
signing certificate. By checking the application’s code signing 
certificate, Sarah can validate that the software was indeed 
issued by a trusted entity and hasn’t been altered since it was 
signed. A valid code signing certificate gives users confidence 
in the authenticity and integrity of the software. 
Option A is incorrect. While the SSL certificate of a website 
ensures secure data transmission between the server and the 
browser, it doesn’t guarantee the integrity or authenticity of the 
software being downloaded. 
Option C is incorrect. Open-source repositories may contain 
the source code of a software, but checking these repositories 
doesn’t necessarily validate the integrity of the compiled 
software version Sarah has downloaded. 
Option D is incorrect. User reviews can provide insights into 
the software’s functionality and user experience, but they cannot 
be relied upon to confirm software authenticity or integrity. 
Question 180. An organization is conducting a risk assessment 
for its cloud infrastructure. The assessment has determined that 
the likelihood of a data breach through an insecure API is 
“High.” What factors may have contributed to this likelihood 
rating? 
 (A)   	
The API has been thoroughly tested and has a known 
secure configuration 
 (B)   	
There are few records of this kind of breach in the 
industry 
 (C)	   The API is publicly accessible and has had several 
	
 
1031

vulnerabilities reported in the past six months 
 (D)   	
The cloud provider offers a guaranteed SLA against 
any form of security breach 
Explanation 180. Correct Answer: C. The API is publicly 
accessible and has had several vulnerabilities reported in 
the past six months. A publicly accessible API with a history 
of recent vulnerabilities significantly increases the likelihood of 
a breach, making this scenario the best fit for a “High” 
likelihood rating. 
Option A is incorrect. A thoroughly tested and known secure 
configuration would likely reduce the likelihood rating. 
Option B is incorrect. Few records of similar breaches would 
also likely reduce the assessed likelihood. 
Option D is incorrect. A guaranteed SLA might offer remedies 
post-breach, but it does not inherently reduce the likelihood of a 
breach occurring. 
Question 181. Jenny, the new CIO of a multinational firm, 
wants to ensure that every software and hardware asset in the 
organization has a clearly defined owner responsible for its 
security and maintenance. Which of the following is the MOST 
effective way to achieve this? 
 (A)   	
Deploy an automated asset discovery tool and assign 
assets to departments based on their location 
 (B)   	
Mandate that every department head is the default 
owner of all assets within their department 
 (C)   	
Conduct regular audits and require individual users to 
	
 
1032

claim ownership of their assets 
 (D)  	
 Introduce an Asset Management System where 
assets are logged with defined ownership as they are 
procured or assigned 
Explanation 181. Correct Answer: D. Introduce an Asset 
Management System where assets are logged with defined 
ownership as they are procured or assigned. An Asset 
Management System provides a structured way to log, track, 
and manage assets throughout their lifecycle, including defining 
and recording asset ownership. This ensures clarity and 
accountability regarding asset responsibility. 
Option A is incorrect. While automated discovery tools are 
helpful, assigning assets based solely on location does not 
necessarily reflect the actual usage or responsibility for the 
asset. 
Option B is incorrect. While department heads should be 
aware of assets within their departments, they may not always 
be the best individuals to take ownership, especially for specific 
or specialized assets. 
Option C is incorrect. Regular audits are crucial, but relying 
solely on users to claim ownership might not capture all assets, 
and it’s a reactive rather than proactive approach. 
Question 182. An organization is deploying new IoT devices in 
its smart office. To ensure that only authorized devices can 
connect to the corporate network, each device will be given a 
unique key pair. Which of the following best describes the 
	
 
1033

system authentication approach the organization is using? 
(A)   	
Shared secret authentication 
 (B)   	
Public key infrastructure (PKI) 
 (C)   	
Token-based authentication 
 (D)   	
Username and password authentication 
Explanation 182. Correct Answer: B. Public key 
infrastructure (PKI). Public key infrastructure (PKI) is a 
combination of hardware, software, policies, and standards that 
work together to provide a framework for secure 
communications. One of the primary features of PKI is the use 
of a pair of keys (public and private) to authenticate entities. In 
the scenario, each IoT device is given a unique key pair, 
indicating the use of PKI for system authentication. 
Option A is incorrect. Shared secret authentication typically 
involves two parties having a shared secret that they use to 
authenticate one another. The scenario mentions a unique key 
pair for each device, which doesn’t align with the concept of a 
shared secret. 
Option C is incorrect. Token-based authentication typically 
involves using a hardware or software token that generates a 
time-sensitive code. The scenario is describing the use of key 
pairs, not tokens. 
Option D is incorrect. Username and password authentication 
is a method where entities provide a username and a secret 
password to verify their identity. The scenario does not mention 
the use of usernames or passwords. 
	
 
1034

Question 183. After a recent security breach, CyberCorp is 
reviewing its software vendors for their responsiveness to 
vulnerabilities. Which of the following metrics would BEST 
assist CyberCorp in determining the timeliness and efficiency of 
security patches from a vendor? 
 (A)       The frequency of software updates released by the 
vendor 
 (B)   	
The vendor's quarterly financial reports 
 (C)  	
 Time between vulnerability disclosure and patch 
release by the vendor 
 (D)   	
The number of features added by the vendor in the 
last software update 
Explanation 183. Correct Answer: C. Time between 
vulnerability disclosure and patch release by the vendor. The 
time taken by a vendor to release a security patch after a 
vulnerability is disclosed is a direct measure of their 
responsiveness to security threats. A shorter duration indicates a 
higher prioritization of security concerns. 
Option A is incorrect. Frequency of software updates does not 
necessarily correlate with timely security patches. A vendor 
might release frequent updates but still be slow in addressing 
security issues. 
Option B is incorrect. A vendor’s quarterly financial reports 
might indicate the financial health of the company but does not 
directly reflect their responsiveness to security vulnerabilities. 
	
 
1035

Option D is incorrect. The number of features added in a 
software update does not indicate the timeliness or effectiveness 
of security patches. 
Question 184. A company is setting up a secure communication 
channel between its headquarters and a remote branch office. To 
ensure that data transmitted over this channel originates from a 
legitimate system at the branch office, the company is 
considering using digital certificates. Which authentication 
method for systems is the company contemplating? 
 (A)   	
Kerberos authentication 
 (B)   	
Password-based authentication 
 (C)   	
Certificate-based authentication 
 (D)   	
Biometric-based authentication 
Explanation 184.  Correct Answer: C. Certificate-based 
authentication. Certificate-based authentication uses digital 
certificates to verify the identity of systems or individuals. In 
the given scenario, the company wants to verify that data 
transmitted over the communication channel originates from a 
legitimate system, making digital certificates an appropriate 
choice. 
Option A is incorrect. Kerberos authentication is a ticket-based 
authentication protocol primarily used to authenticate users in a 
network, not specifically for system-to-system authentication 
using digital certificates. 
Option B is incorrect. Password-based authentication requires 
systems or users to provide a secret password to prove their 
identity. It doesn’t involve the use of digital certificates. 
	
 
1036

Option D is incorrect. Biometric-based authentication involves 
using unique physical or behavioral attributes of a person for 
verification, such as fingerprints or facial patterns. It is not 
applicable to system-to-system authentication. 
Question 185. After a series of cyber incidents, AlphaTech 
Corp. wants to take proactive measures to identify 
vulnerabilities in their network. They aim to obtain a 
comprehensive report of potential weaknesses without 
exploiting them. Which of the following would best meet this 
objective? 
 (A)   	
Penetration test 
 (B)   	
Vulnerability scan 
 (C)   	
Red team assessment 
 (D)   	
Port security 
Explanation 185. Correct Answer: B. Vulnerability scan. A 
vulnerability scan is designed to inspect systems, networks, and 
applications to identify potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities. 
Unlike some of the other options, it doesn’t attempt to exploit 
these vulnerabilities; it merely identifies and reports them. 
Option A is incorrect. A penetration test goes a step further 
than a vulnerability scan. While it identifies vulnerabilities, it 
also attempts to exploit them to understand the potential impact 
of a breach. 
Option C is incorrect. A red team assessment is a goal-based 
assessment where a simulated adversary (the red team) tries to 
achieve specific objectives. It often involves exploitation, which 
goes beyond the mere identification of vulnerabilities. 
	
 
1037

Option D is incorrect. Port security is a feature at the data link 
layer to control MAC address-based access on a port-by-port 
basis. It doesn’t offer a comprehensive vulnerability report. 
Question 186. Lucy, a security analyst, is informed that several 
employees have been receiving unauthorized file transfer 
requests via Bluetooth when they are in the company’s 
cafeteria. Which of the following attacks is MOST likely being 
attempted? 
 (A)   	
Bluejacking 
 (B)   	
ARP poisoning 
 (C)   	
Bluesnarfing 
 (D)   	
Evil Twin 
Explanation 186. Correct Answer: A. Bluejacking. 
Bluejacking is the sending of unsolicited messages or files over 
Bluetooth to Bluetooth-enabled devices such as mobile phones, 
laptops, or PDAs. It is often used as a prank or to advertise to 
nearby people. 
Bluejacking does not give attackers control over the victim’s 
device, but it can be used to send unwanted messages or files, 
which aligns with the scenario described. 
Option B is incorrect. ARP poisoning is a type of attack in 
which an attacker sends falsified ARP (Address Resolution 
Protocol) messages over a local area network. It’s unrelated to 
Bluetooth communications. 
Option C is incorrect. Bluesnarfing is the unauthorized access 
of information from a wireless device through a Bluetooth 
	
 
1038

connection. Bluesnarfing goes beyond just sending unsolicited 
messages; it seeks to access personal data. 
Option D is incorrect. An Evil Twin attack involves creating a 
rogue Wi-Fi hotspot to masquerade as a legitimate one, to 
intercept or manipulate data traffic. It does not directly involve 
Bluetooth connections. 
Question 187. A small business wants to deploy a single 
network security device that can handle multiple security 
functions such as firewall protection, intrusion detection, anti-
malware, and content filtering. Which of the following would 
be the most suitable solution? 
 (A)   	
Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) 
 (B)   	
Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
 (C)   	
Unified Threat Management (UTM) 
 (D)   	
Proxy Server 
Explanation 187. Correct Answer: C. Unified Threat 
Management (UTM). Unified Threat Management (UTM) 
devices are designed to combine multiple security features into 
a single appliance. This makes them ideal for smaller 
organizations that require a comprehensive range of security 
functions but might not have the resources to deploy and 
manage multiple standalone devices. 
Option A is incorrect. While NIDS can identify and notify of 
potential malicious activities, it does not offer the 
comprehensive multi-feature capabilities found in a UTM. 
	
 
1039

Option B is incorrect. A Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
specifically protects web applications from certain types of 
attacks like XSS and SQL injection. It does not encompass the 
broader range of security functions that a UTM does. 
Option D is incorrect. A Proxy Server primarily controls 
internet access and might provide some caching and content 
filtering capabilities, but it doesn’t offer the wide range of 
security functions that a UTM does. 
Question 188. During an audit review at NetSecure Corp., the 
external auditors observed that the company is willing to take 
risks that can potentially result in a 10% decrease in their annual 
profits, but no more than that. The auditors want to document 
this finding in their report. Which term should they use to 
describe NetSecure Corp.’s stance? 
 (A)   	
Risk Avoidance 
 (B)   	
Risk Transfer 
 (C)         Risk Tolerance 
 (D)   	
Risk Assessment 
Explanation 188. Correct Answer: C. Risk Tolerance. Risk 
tolerance represents the maximum amount of risk an entity is 
willing to accept or tolerate. NetSecure Corp.’s acceptance of 
risks that can result in up to a 10% decrease in annual profits 
represents their risk tolerance level. 
Option A is incorrect. Risk avoidance means completely 
sidestepping any activities that have associated risks. The 
scenario indicates that the company is willing to take risks, but 
within certain limits. 
	
 
1040

Option B is incorrect. Risk transfer involves offloading certain 
risks to other parties, typically through insurance or other 
contractual methods. The scenario doesn’t provide information 
about transferring risks. 
Option D is incorrect. Risk assessment is the overall process of 
identifying, analyzing, and evaluating risks. The scenario is 
more focused on the company’s willingness to accept a specific 
level of risk rather than assessing it. 
Question 189. SecureWeb LLC, a web hosting company, has 
experienced two server breaches over the past five years. They 
are currently analyzing the risks associated with their 
infrastructure. Which of the following best represents the 
Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO) for the server breaches? 
 (A)   	
0.2 
 (B)  	
 0.4 
 (C)   	
2 
 (D)   	
5 
Explanation 189. Correct Answer: B. 0.4. The Annualized 
Rate of Occurrence (ARO) is a measure of how often an event 
is expected to occur on an annual basis. Given that there have 
been two breaches over five years, the ARO would be 2 
breaches divided by 5 years, which is 0.4. 
Option A is incorrect. While it’s close, the calculation for ARO 
should be the number of occurrences (2) divided by the number 
of years (5), which is 0.4, not 0.2. 
	
 
1041

Option C is incorrect. This would indicate two breaches every 
year, which is not the case presented. 
Option D is incorrect. This would suggest that the breaches 
happen five times a year, which is inconsistent with the 
scenario. 
Question 190. DataCenter Inc. is located in a region prone to 
protests and vandalism. They wish to enhance their perimeter 
security to deter potential intruders and make it visibly clear 
that unauthorized access is restricted. Which of the following 
physical security measures would be the most effective first line 
of defense for the company? 
 (A)   	
Sliding Doors 
 (B)   	
Security Cameras 
 (C)   	
High-security Fencing 
 (D)   	
Proximity Card Readers 
Explanation 190. Correct Answer: C. High-security Fencing. 
High-security fencing is a primary physical barrier that serves to 
deter, delay, and detect intrusions. It provides a clear visual 
indicator that delineates private property and can be equipped 
with additional deterrents such as barbed wire or sensors. 
Especially in areas prone to vandalism or protests, a robust 
fence acts as an immediate barrier to unauthorized access. 
Option A is incorrect. Sliding doors are more applicable to 
internal security or entrance points and do not serve as a 
primary external barrier. 
	
 
1042

Option B is incorrect. While security cameras monitor and 
record activities, they do not serve as a physical barrier to 
prevent or deter unauthorized access. 
Option D is incorrect. Proximity card readers are a form of 
access control that checks the credentials of individuals but do 
not serve as a primary deterrent against vandalism or protests. 
Question 191. A financial institution is shutting down one of its 
data centers. Given the highly sensitive nature of the data 
stored, the company wants to ensure that there is no possibility 
of data retrieval from the storage devices. Which of the 
following methods would be the MOST effective in 
guaranteeing the destruction of data? 
 (A)   	
Overwriting with zeros 
 (B)   	
Standard Disk Format 
 (C)   	
Physical Destruction 
 (D)   	
Running a Disk Cleanup utility 
Explanation 191. Correct Answer: C. Physical Destruction. 
Physical destruction, such as shredding or incinerating the 
storage devices, ensures complete destruction of the media, 
making data retrieval impossible, regardless of the tools or 
techniques employed. 
Option A is incorrect. Overwriting with zeros is a method of 
data sanitization, but advanced techniques might still retrieve 
some portions of the data. 
	
 
1043

Option B is incorrect. A standard disk format often does not 
remove data entirely, and traces can remain that could be 
recovered with specialized software. 
Option D is incorrect. Disk Cleanup utilities are designed to 
free up space by removing temporary and unnecessary files but 
not to securely erase sensitive data. 
Question 192. Maria, a network administrator, receives a report 
detailing several open service ports on critical company servers. 
She wants to verify the accuracy of the report. Which of the 
following tools would be BEST for Maria to use to validate the 
findings? 
 (A)   	
Password cracker 
 (B)   	
Port scanner 
 (C)   	
IDS (Intrusion Detection System) 
 (D)   	
Web application firewall 
Explanation 192. Correct Answer: B. Port scanner. A port 
scanner, such as Nmap, sends packets to specific ports on a 
network and then listens for responses. This allows the scanner 
to determine which ports are open and potentially identify the 
services running on those ports. 
Option A is incorrect. Password crackers are used to identify 
weak or easily guessable passwords. They don’t validate open 
service ports. 
Option C is incorrect. An IDS monitors network traffic for 
suspicious activity. While it can identify potential attacks, it 
doesn’t directly verify open service ports. 
	
 
1044

Option D is incorrect. A web application firewall (WAF) 
protects web applications by monitoring, filtering, and blocking 
potentially harmful HTTP traffic. It doesn’t serve the purpose of 
validating open service ports. 
Question 193. Acme Corp is restructuring its internal network 
to improve its security posture. They aim to separate areas with 
different levels of trust. Which of the following approaches 
would BEST achieve this objective? 
 (A)   	
Implementing VLANs based on organizational 
departments 
 (B)   	
Setting up a perimeter firewall to segment external 
and internal traffic 
 (C) 	  Designing network zones based on data sensitivity and 
access requirements 
 (D)   	
Using a single, flat network for simplicity 
Explanation 193. Correct Answer: C. Designing network 
zones based on data sensitivity and access requirements. 
Zoning based on data sensitivity and access requirements 
ensures that segments of the network with varying trust levels 
are isolated. This reduces the risk of a breach in one zone 
affecting another. 
Option A is incorrect. While VLANs can segment traffic, 
doing so based purely on organizational departments may not 
align with varying trust and data sensitivity requirements. 
Option B is incorrect. While perimeter firewalls are crucial for 
security, they primarily separate internal from external traffic 
	
 
1045

and don’t segment areas of varying trust within the internal 
network. 
Option D is incorrect. A single, flat network doesn’t provide 
segmentation, making it vulnerable to lateral movement if a 
threat actor gains access. 
Question 194. A company has recently upgraded its wireless 
infrastructure and wants to ensure that the data transmitted over 
its wireless network is protected using the most recent and 
secure encryption standards. Which of the following should the 
company configure on its wireless access points? 
 (A)   	
WEP 
 (B)   	
WPA 
 (C)   	
WPA2 
 (D)   	
WPA3 
Explanation 194. Correct Answer: D. WPA3. WPA3 is the 
latest iteration of Wi-Fi Protected Access, designed to improve 
upon the security features of WPA2. It offers enhanced 
protections against brute-force attacks, superior encryption 
methods, and a more secure handshake process. 
Option A is incorrect. WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is an 
outdated and insecure protocol that can be easily cracked. It 
should not be used for securing wireless networks. 
Option B is incorrect. While WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) 
was a significant improvement over WEP, it has been surpassed 
by both WPA2 and WPA3 in terms of security features. 
	
 
1046

Option C is incorrect. WPA2 has been a strong standard for 
many years but has vulnerabilities that WPA3 addresses, 
making WPA3 the more secure option. 
Question 195. AlphaTech is conducting a risk analysis on their 
new online payment gateway. They’ve calculated the Annual 
Rate of Occurrence (ARO) for a specific vulnerability as 2, and 
the Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) as $50,000. How much 
should AlphaTech anticipate losing annually due to this 
vulnerability? 
 (A)   	
$10,000 
 (B)  	
 $100,000 
 (C)   	
$25,000 
 (D)   	
$1,000,000 
Explanation 195. Correct Answer: B. $100,000. The 
Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) is calculated by 
multiplying the Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO) by the 
Single Loss Expectancy (SLE). In this scenario, ALE = 2 x 
$50,000 = $100,000. 
Option A is incorrect. This does not correctly apply the 
formula for ALE. 
Option C is incorrect. This is half of the Single Loss 
Expectancy and does not represent an annual loss. 
Option D is incorrect. This amount is significantly higher than 
the calculated ALE.

Question 196. After a recent security breach, CyberSolutions 
Inc. evaluated their response metrics and determined that, on 
average, it took 4 hours from identifying a security breach to 
having it completely resolved. Which metric best describes this 
4-hour timeframe? 
 (A)   	
Recovery Time Objective (RTO) 
 (B)   	
Recovery Point Objective (RPO) 
 (C)       Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) 
 (D) 	  Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) 
Explanation 196. Correct Answer: D. Mean Time To Repair 
(MTTR). MTTR (Mean Time To Repair) is a basic measure of 
the maintainability of repairable items. It represents the average 
time required to repair a failed component or device. For 
CyberSolutions Inc., the 4-hour duration from identifying to 
resolving the breach reflects the MTTR. 
Option A is incorrect. Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the 
targeted duration of time within which a business process must 
be restored after a disaster to avoid unacceptable consequences. 
Option B is incorrect. Recovery Point Objective (RPO) 
represents the maximum acceptable amount of data loss 
measured in time. 
Option C is incorrect. Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) 
is the predicted elapsed time between inherent failures of a 
mechanical or electronic system, during normal system 
operation.

Question 197. A financial application allows users to transfer 
money to other accounts by entering the account number and 
the amount to transfer. During a security audit, it was observed 
that malicious users could enter SQL code into the account 
number field to manipulate the application’s database. Which 
security technique should the development team implement to 
address this vulnerability? 
 (A)   	
Code obfuscation 
 (B)   	
Input validation 
 (C)   	
Encryption at rest 
 (D)   	
Session timeout 
Explanation 197. Correct Answer: B. Input validation. Input 
validation ensures that only valid and expected data is accepted 
by an application. By validating and sanitizing user input, the 
application can prevent malicious data, such as SQL code, from 
being processed and executed, thus mitigating the risk of SQL 
injection attacks. 
Option A is incorrect. Code obfuscation makes it more difficult 
for attackers to understand the application’s code but does not 
prevent them from injecting malicious input. 
Option C is incorrect. Encryption at rest protects stored data, 
but it doesn’t prevent SQL injection attacks which exploit the 
application’s input handling. 
Option D is incorrect. Session timeout limits the duration of a 
user’s session, but it does not validate or sanitize user input.

Question 198. GreenTech Inc. is selling a set of old servers to 
another company. Before the transaction, they want to ensure 
the data on these servers is irretrievable and they can prove that 
due diligence was performed. What should GreenTech seek to 
assure the buyer of proper data destruction? 
 (A)   	
A receipt of sale for the servers 
 (B)   	
A detailed log of the server's usage 
 (C) 	        A certificate of data sanitization 
 (D)   	
A user manual of the servers 
Explanation 198. Correct Answer: C. A certificate of data 
sanitization. A certificate of data sanitization from a reputable 
entity provides assurance that all data on the servers was 
securely and completely wiped. Such certificates confirm that 
specific techniques were used to ensure data is irretrievable, 
giving confidence to the buyer. 
Option A is incorrect. A receipt of sale only proves the 
transaction took place but does not address data sanitization or 
destruction. 
Option B is incorrect. A log of the server’s usage might detail 
its operational history but does not provide assurance of data 
destruction. 
Option D is incorrect. A user manual provides instructions on 
how to use the server but does not address the state or security 
of the data it once held. 
Question 199. A healthcare organization uses a software 
platform to manage patient records. A recent vulnerability 
	
 
1050

assessment identified a potential exploit where an unauthorized 
individual might gain access to 30% of stored patient data. 
Which of the following BEST describes this scenario? 
 (A)   	
The threat likelihood is 30% 
 (B)   	
The vulnerability has a 30% rate of occurrence 
 (C)   	
The exposure factor of the vulnerability is 30% 
 (D)   	
30% of the patients have been impacted 
Explanation 199. Correct Answer: C. The exposure factor of 
the vulnerability is 30%. The exposure factor is a measure of 
the magnitude of loss or percentage of asset value that a realized 
threat would destroy or damage. In this case, the vulnerability 
could lead to 30% of patient data being accessed. 
Option A is incorrect. Likelihood refers to the probability of an 
event happening, not the potential impact or amount of data that 
might be exposed. 
Option B is incorrect. The rate of occurrence (ARO) is a 
measure of how often a specific event will occur, not the 
potential impact or amount of data that might be exposed. 
Option D is incorrect. The scenario does not indicate that 30% 
of patients have already been impacted, only that their data 
might be accessed if the vulnerability is exploited. 
Question 200. GreenTech Industries has a manufacturing 
facility located in a relatively secluded area. Recent incidents of 
theft and trespassing have alarmed the management. Which of 
the following would MOST effectively deter unauthorized 
nighttime access to the perimeter of the facility? 
	
 
1051

 (A)  	
 Installing infrared sensors 
 (B)   	
Using bright perimeter lighting 
 (C)   	
Deploying additional security guards inside the 
facility 
 (D)   	
Increasing the height of the facility walls 
Explanation 200. Correct Answer: B. Using bright 
perimeter lighting. Bright perimeter lighting acts as a strong 
deterrent for unauthorized individuals, as it reduces hiding 
spots, makes surveillance cameras more effective, and can make 
it easier for security personnel to spot potential threats. In 
secluded areas, proper lighting is particularly essential to 
illuminate dark spots and deter potential intruders. 
Option A is incorrect. While infrared sensors can detect 
movement, they do not act as a visible deterrent in the same 
way bright lighting does. 
Option C is incorrect. Deploying additional security guards 
inside the facility does not address the immediate concern of 
unauthorized nighttime access to the perimeter. 
Option D is incorrect. Increasing the height of the walls can 
act as a deterrent, but it doesn’t illuminate or expose potential 
intruders like bright lighting does.

Question 201. An international bank is setting up a new online 
portal for its customers to access their financial statements. 
Which measure should the bank implement to ensure that 
financial data in transit between the customer’s browser and the 
bank’s servers is kept confidential? 
 (A)   	
Use file-level encryption for all financial statements 
 (B)   	
Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
	
 
1090

 (C)   	
Use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport 
Layer Security (TLS) for the portal 
 (D)   	
Store all financial data in an encrypted database 
Explanation 201. Correct Answer: C. Use Secure Sockets 
Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) for the 
portal. SSL/TLS is designed to secure data in transit. By 
encrypting the data between the customer’s browser and the 
bank’s servers, it ensures the data’s confidentiality while in 
transit. 
Option A is incorrect. File-level encryption is great for data at 
rest but doesn’t secure data in transit between a client and 
server. 
Option B is incorrect. While a WAF can provide protection 
against web application attacks, it does not inherently encrypt 
data in transit. 
Option D is incorrect. Storing financial data in an encrypted 
database safeguards the data at rest but doesn’t ensure the 
confidentiality of data in transit to the client. 
Question 202. A multinational organization with multiple 
branch offices is looking to simplify their WAN connectivity 
and reduce costs while ensuring that their inter-office data 
transfers remain secure. Which technology would best fit their 
needs? 
(A)   	
VLAN 
 (B)   	
MPLS 
	
 
1091

 (C)   	
SD-WAN 
 (D)   	
DMZ 
Explanation 202. Correct Answer: C. SD-WAN. Software-
defined wide area network (SD-WAN) offers enterprises the 
ability to leverage any combination of transport services, 
including MPLS, LTE, and broadband internet services, to 
securely connect users to applications. SD-WAN can reduce 
costs by enabling the use of lower-cost internet connections and 
can also simplify WAN management. 
Option A is incorrect. VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is 
used to segment a local network into different broadcast 
domains, but it does not facilitate WAN connectivity or reduce 
WAN costs. 
Option B is incorrect. MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) 
is a type of WAN technology that can be expensive. While it 
provides reliable and fast connections, it doesn’t offer the cost-
saving benefits or flexibility of SD-WAN. 
Option D is incorrect. DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) is a buffer 
zone between an organization’s internal network and the 
external, untrusted networks. It is not related to WAN 
connectivity or cost reduction. 
Question 203. While setting up a new internal web application, 
Laura, a system administrator, decides to use a digital certificate 
for SSL/TLS encryption. Due to budget constraints, she can’t 
procure a certificate from a commercial Certificate Authority 
(CA). Which of the following would be a viable option for 
	
 
1092

Laura to secure the application? 
 (A)   	
Rely on plaintext HTTP for the application 
 (B)   	
Obtain a certificate from a free Certificate Authority 
 (C)   	
Generate a self-signed certificate 
 (D)       Use a shared certificate from another application 
Explanation 203. Correct Answer: C. Generate a self-signed 
certificate. A self-signed certificate can be generated by Laura 
without the need for a Certificate Authority. While self-signed 
certificates can cause trust issues in public-facing applications 
(since they aren’t signed by a recognized CA), they can be 
appropriate for internal applications where users can be 
informed and trust can be established manually. 
Option A is incorrect. Relying on plaintext HTTP doesn’t 
provide any encryption or security for the application, leaving it 
vulnerable to various attacks. 
Option B is incorrect. While obtaining a certificate from a free 
Certificate Authority is a valid option, it wasn’t the best choice 
given the specific scenario which emphasizes not using a CA. 
Option D is incorrect. Using a shared certificate from another 
application can introduce security risks and is not a 
recommended practice. 
Question 204. A renowned technology company recently 
released a new line of routers. After a short period, security 
researchers discovered that some of these routers contain 
malicious chips embedded during the manufacturing process. 
This incident most likely represents a vulnerability related to  
	
 
1093

which supply chain aspect? 
 (A)   	
Outsourced software development risks 
 (B)   	
Service provider's outdated security practices 
 (C)  	
 Hardware provider's embedded compromise 
 (D)   	
Inadequate vendor background checks 
Explanation 204. Correct Answer: C. Hardware provider’s 
embedded compromise. Supply chain vulnerabilities in the 
context of hardware providers can involve the introduction of 
malicious components or chips during the manufacturing 
process. In this scenario, the presence of malicious chips in the 
routers is a direct reflection of a vulnerability due to a 
compromised hardware provider. 
Option A is incorrect. The scenario revolves around a 
hardware compromise, not software development outsourcing. 
Option B is incorrect. While it’s essential for service providers 
to employ up-to-date security practices, the vulnerability in this 
scenario is attributed to a hardware compromise and not 
outdated security practices. 
Option D is incorrect. Although vendor background checks are 
important, this scenario emphasizes a vulnerability stemming 
from the hardware manufacturing process, not the vetting 
process of vendors. 
Question 205. A multinational corporation is expanding its 
operations in various countries. The company has decided to 
restrict access to its internal network based on geolocation to 
ensure that only employees from specific countries can access 
	
 
1094

certain data. Which of the following would be the MOST 
appropriate solution to implement this requirement? 
 (A)   	
Deploy a VPN with multi-factor authentication 
 (B)   	
Use MAC address filtering on all company devices 
 (C)  	
 Implement a geolocation-based access control 
system 
 (D)   	
Set up region-specific SSIDs for the company's Wi-Fi 
network 
Explanation 205. Correct Answer: C. Implement a 
geolocation-based access control system. Geolocation-based 
access control systems determine users’ physical locations and 
can grant or deny access based on predefined geographic 
boundaries. This solution is most fitting for restricting access 
based on country-specific requirements. 
Option A is incorrect. While a VPN with multi-factor 
authentication improves security, it doesn’t inherently restrict 
access based on geolocation. 
Option B is incorrect. MAC address filtering restricts access 
based on device hardware addresses and not on geolocation. 
Option D is incorrect. Region-specific SSIDs might limit Wi-
Fi access in certain areas, but they don’t enforce geolocation-
based restrictions on a broader scale. 
Question 206. TechGuard Inc. and CloudSecure are two 
cybersecurity firms that are considering a collaboration on a 
new cloud security project. Both companies have proprietary 
technologies and methodologies they will bring into the 
	
 
1095

partnership. Before embarking on the collaborative venture, 
which agreement should they finalize to define the terms of 
their partnership, roles, and shared responsibilities? 
 (A)       Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) 
 (B)   	
Service-level agreement (SLA) 
 (C)  	
 Business partners agreement (BPA) 
 (D)   	
Memorandum of understanding (MOU) 
Explanation 206. Correct Answer: C. Business partners 
agreement (BPA). A Business partners agreement (BPA) 
outlines the specifics of the partnership between entities, 
detailing roles, responsibilities, financial arrangements, and 
other key terms of the relationship. Given that TechGuard Inc. 
and CloudSecure are forming a partnership with shared roles 
and responsibilities, a BPA is the most fitting. 
Option A is incorrect. An NDA focuses specifically on the 
confidentiality of shared information and not on the broader 
terms of a partnership. 
Option B is incorrect. A service-level agreement (SLA) centers 
on the standards and quality of service to be provided, detailing 
performance metrics, and does not focus on partnership 
specifics. 
Option D is incorrect. An MOU signifies mutual intentions 
and understanding between parties but may not provide detailed 
terms and conditions of a business partnership like a BPA does. 
Question 207. A security team recently upgraded their intrusion 
detection system (IDS). Since the upgrade, the system hasn’t 
	
 
1096

flagged any intrusions, even though intrusion attempts are a 
regular occurrence. What is this situation best characterized as? 
 (A)   	
A true negative 
 (B)   	
A false negative 
 (C)   	
A true positive 
 (D)   	
A confirmation feedback 
Explanation 207. Correct Answer: B. A false negative. A 
false negative occurs when a system fails to detect a threat or 
vulnerability that is actually present. In this scenario, the IDS 
isn’t detecting real intrusion attempts, which could lead to 
undetected breaches. 
Option A is incorrect. A true negative would mean that the 
system correctly identified that there were no intrusions when 
there truly weren’t any. This isn’t the scenario described as 
intrusion attempts are expected. 
Option C is incorrect. A true positive means that the threat or 
vulnerability was correctly identified and truly exists. Since no 
intrusions are being detected, this isn’t a true positive. 
Option D is incorrect. “Confirmation feedback” isn’t a 
standard term related to vulnerability detection and doesn’t 
apply to the described scenario. 
Question 208. CyberTech Inc., a cybersecurity consulting 
company, is in discussions with a potential client, MedCorp, to 
assist in developing a new secure medical records system. 
MedCorp will be sharing sensitive patient data with CyberTech 
as part of the process. Which agreement should be in place 
	
 
1097

before the sharing of such information to ensure confidentiality? 
 (A)   	
Memorandum of understanding (MOU) 
 (B)   	
Service-level agreement (SLA) 
 (C) 	  Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) 
 (D)   	
Work order (WO)/statement of work (SOW) 
Explanation 208. Correct Answer: C. Non-disclosure 
agreement (NDA). An NDA (Non-disclosure agreement) is 
specifically designed to safeguard confidential information that 
is shared between two parties. It ensures that the receiving party 
doesn’t disclose or misuse the information provided. Given the 
sensitive nature of the patient data that MedCorp will share, an 
NDA is crucial. 
Option A is incorrect. An MOU signifies mutual intentions and 
understanding between parties but doesn’t specifically cater to 
the confidentiality of shared information. 
Option B is incorrect. A service-level agreement (SLA) is 
primarily about the level of service to be provided, detailing 
performance metrics, and penalties for non-compliance. It 
doesn’t inherently focus on data confidentiality. 
Option D is incorrect. A Work order (WO) or statement of 
work (SOW) details the specifics of a project, from tasks to 
milestones, but doesn’t directly address the confidentiality of 
shared data. 
Question 209. While analyzing server logs, Mike, an IT 
security analyst, noticed that an unfamiliar document was 
frequently accessed. Upon investigation, he realized that this 
	
 
1098

document was deliberately placed by the security team and had 
no real data but was closely monitored. The purpose of this file 
is MOST likely: 
 (A)   	
To serve as a redundancy copy in case of data loss 
 (B)   	
To act as a decoy to attract and detect 
unauthorized access 
 (C)   	
To maintain a record of all user activities for auditing 
 (D)   	
To be encrypted and sent to clients as a sample 
Explanation 209. Correct Answer: B. To act as a decoy to 
attract and detect unauthorized access. Honeyfiles serve as 
deceptive measures, attracting potential malicious actors or 
unauthorized users. If such files are accessed, it can be an 
indication of unauthorized or suspicious activities in the system. 
Option A is incorrect. Redundancy copies or backups are 
created to prevent data loss due to unforeseen issues, but they 
are not monitored as decoys. 
Option C is incorrect. User activity logs maintain records of 
actions taken within a system or application, which is different 
from a deceptive measure like a honeyfile. 
Option D is incorrect. Files encrypted for client samples serve 
a different purpose and are not typically used as decoys to 
detect unauthorized access. 
Question 210. After implementing a major security update to its 
database system, TechCo experienced unexpected downtime 
and system incompatibilities. The CISO wants to ensure that 
such incidents can be quickly addressed in the future. Which of 
	
 
1099

the following should TechCo have had in place before 
deploying the update to mitigate the impact of these kinds of 
incidents? 
 (A)   	
A comprehensive list of all updates 
 (B)   	
An automated system recovery tool 
 (C)   	
A backout plan 
 (D)   	
A detailed user manual for the update 
Explanation 210. Correct Answer: C. A backout plan. A 
backout plan is a pre-arranged strategy or set of procedures to 
reverse changes made to the system in case the changes have 
adverse effects. In scenarios like this, where a significant update 
causes unintended problems, a backout plan would allow the 
organization to revert the system to its previous stable state 
quickly. 
Option A is incorrect. While having a comprehensive list of all 
updates is good for documentation and auditing purposes, it 
would not directly help in mitigating the effects of an adverse 
update. 
Option B is incorrect. An automated system recovery tool 
might assist in reverting changes or recovering the system. 
However, a backout plan is more specific to undoing changes 
made during an update or change process, making it more 
suitable in this context. 
Option D is incorrect. A detailed user manual for the update is 
beneficial for training and troubleshooting, but it wouldn’t serve 
the direct purpose of reverting unintended adverse changes.

Question 211. TechFirm is preparing to embark on a new 
project with a client, focusing on implementing a cybersecurity 
infrastructure overhaul. They wish to lay out the specific tasks, 
deliverables, timelines, and resources required for this project. 
Which type of agreement would best capture these details? 
 (A)   	
Memorandum of understanding (MOU) 
 (B)   	
Joint venture agreement 
 (C)   	
Master service agreement (MSA) 
 (D)       Work order (WO)/statement of work (SOW) 
Explanation 211. Correct Answer: D. Work order (WO)/
statement of work (SOW). A Work order (WO) or statement of 
work (SOW) is tailored to outline the specifics of a particular 
job or project. It often includes details such as tasks, 
deliverables, schedules, and necessary resources. Given that 
TechFirm seeks to describe the details of their cybersecurity 
overhaul project, the WO/SOW is the most appropriate choice. 
Option A is incorrect. An MOU is a more general agreement 
signifying mutual intentions, but it doesn’t delve into specific 
tasks or deliverables of a particular project. 
Option B is incorrect. A joint venture agreement is mainly 
concerned with the creation of a new entity or project involving 
multiple parties, highlighting their roles and responsibilities. 
Option C is incorrect. A Master service agreement (MSA) 
provides a broad framework covering the terms and conditions 
of business transactions between parties. It doesn’t specify 
details of individual projects. 
	
 
1101

Question 212. The IT department of a large corporation is 
performing a vulnerability assessment on its virtualized 
infrastructure. They come across a potential threat where a user 
from within a VM can interact and possibly compromise the 
host system. What is this type of vulnerability commonly 
referred to as? 
 (A)   	
VM cloning 
 (B)   	
VM snapshotting 
 (C)   	
VM escape 
 (D)   	
VM migration 
Explanation 212. Correct Answer: C. VM escape. A VM 
escape occurs when an attacker runs code on a VM that allows 
them to break out of the VM’s isolated environment and gain 
access to the host system. 
A virtual machine (VM) escape refers to the exploitation of a 
vulnerability in the virtualization software, allowing an attacker 
who has control over a VM to break out of its isolated 
environment and gain access to the host system. This can lead to 
the potential compromise of other VMs running on the same 
host or the underlying infrastructure. 
Option A is incorrect. VM cloning is the process of creating an 
exact copy of a VM. It does not involve breaking out of the 
VM’s isolated environment. 
Option B is incorrect. VM snapshotting involves creating a 
point-in-time copy of a VM, which can be used for backup or 
recovery purposes. It is not related to escaping from a VM. 
	
 
1102

Option D is incorrect. VM migration refers to the process of 
moving a VM from one host to another, often for load balancing 
or hardware maintenance. It does not involve escaping from the 
VM’s isolated environment. 
Question 213. A large organization is considering deploying a 
solution that will allow employees to securely access company 
resources remotely using their personal devices. The 
organization wants a solution that can provide strong 
authentication and ensure that the data remains confidential 
during transit. Which technology should be adopted? 
 (A)   	
Kerberos 
 (B)   	
Remote Desktop Services (RDS) 
 (C)   	
Remote Access VPN 
 (D)   	
SNMP 
Explanation 213. Correct Answer: C. Remote Access VPN. 
Remote Access VPN provides a secure connection from a 
remote device to an organization’s internal network. It uses 
encryption to ensure data confidentiality and can also be set up 
with strong authentication methods. 
Option A is incorrect. Kerberos is an authentication protocol 
that uses tickets to allow nodes to prove their identity in a 
network. While it provides strong authentication, it doesn’t 
inherently provide a solution for remote access with encrypted 
communication. 
Option B is incorrect. Remote Desktop Services (RDS) allows 
users to access a remote desktop or application. While it can be 
	
 
1103

secured, it doesn’t always ensure encryption during transit, 
especially if not paired with another technology like VPN. 
Option D is incorrect. SNMP (Simple Network Management 
Protocol) is used for managing and monitoring network devices. 
It isn’t related to providing secure remote access for users. 
Question 214. A security analyst at ZetaTech is looking to 
gather information about emerging threats and vulnerabilities 
relevant to their industry. Which of the following would be the 
MOST suitable method to obtain real-time, continuously 
updated data on potential security issues? 
 (A)   	
Relying solely on automated internal vulnerability 
scanners 
 (B)   	
Periodic manual penetration testing 
 (C)  	
 Subscribing to an OSINT threat feed 
 (D)   	
Regularly checking the company's firewall logs 
Explanation 214. Correct Answer: C. Subscribing to an 
OSINT threat feed. An OSINT (Open-source intelligence) 
threat feed provides real-time information and is continuously 
updated with data on potential security issues sourced from 
publicly available information. 
Option A is incorrect. While automated internal vulnerability 
scanners are valuable for identifying vulnerabilities within the 
organization’s infrastructure, they don’t provide continuous 
real-time data about external emerging threats. 
	
 
1104

Option B is incorrect. Manual penetration testing is periodic 
and doesn’t offer continuous updates on emerging threats from 
the broader industry. 
Option C is incorrect. Regularly checking the company’s 
firewall logs will give insight into potential malicious activities 
targeting the company, but it won’t offer broad, updated data on 
industry-wide threats. 
Question 215. While conducting a security assessment, Lucy 
found that a specific application crashes when she inputs a 
string that is much longer than what the input field is designed 
to handle. This could potentially allow her to execute arbitrary 
code in the application’s context. What vulnerability is Lucy 
likely trying to exploit? 
 (A)   	
SQL Injection 
 (B)   	
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
 (C)   	
Buffer Overflow 
 (D)   	
Directory Traversal 
Explanation 215. Correct Answer: C. Buffer Overflow. 
Buffer overflow vulnerabilities occur when data written to a 
buffer exceeds that buffer’s boundaries, potentially overwriting 
adjacent memory locations. If exploited successfully, it can lead 
to arbitrary code execution. 
Buffer overflow is a condition where an application writes more 
data to a buffer than it can hold, causing the excess data to 
overflow into adjacent memory spaces. When this happens, 
attackers can overwrite specific parts of the memory, which 
	
 
1105

may lead to arbitrary code execution, application crashes, or 
data corruption. 
Option A is incorrect. SQL Injection involves injecting 
malicious SQL statements into an entry field for execution, 
aiming to manipulate a database. It doesn’t relate to buffer 
boundaries or memory overflows. 
Option B is incorrect. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allows 
attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by 
other users. While this is an input validation flaw like a buffer 
overflow, XSS specifically targets script execution within web 
browsers and does not involve overflowing buffer boundaries. 
Option D is incorrect. Directory Traversal attacks aim to 
access files and directories stored outside the web root folder. 
They don’t involve overflowing buffer boundaries or memory 
overflows. 
Question 216. WebFirm, a web development company, did not 
comply with the data handling and protection clauses outlined 
in their contract with RetailMax, an e-commerce company. As a 
result, RetailMax’s customer data was exposed in a data breach. 
Which of the following is the MOST probable contractual 
impact on WebFirm due to this incident? 
(A)   	
WebFirm will receive bonuses for early project 
completion 
 (B)   	
WebFirm will be required to provide additional 
services at no cost 
 (C)   	
RetailMax will terminate the contract and may 
	
 
1106

seek damages 
 (D)   	
RetailMax will extend the project timeline 
Explanation 216.  Correct Answer: C. RetailMax will 
terminate the contract and may seek damages. A data breach, 
especially one that results from non-compliance with 
contractual clauses related to data protection, can lead to the 
termination of the contract. Additionally, the affected party, in 
this case, RetailMax, might also seek damages from WebFirm 
for the breach. 
Option A is incorrect. Bonuses for early project completion are 
unrelated to non-compliance with data protection clauses. 
Option B is incorrect. While some contracts might stipulate 
penalties such as providing additional services for breaches, in a 
significant incident like a data breach, termination is more 
probable. 
Option D is incorrect. Extending the project timeline is not a 
typical response to a breach of data protection clauses in a 
contract. 
Question 217. During a political campaign, an anonymous 
group releases a series of articles containing fabricated data 
about a candidate’s past, intending to influence voters’ opinions. 
This is an example of: 
(A)   	
Impersonation 
 (B)   	
SSmishing 
 (C)   	
Disinformation 
 (D)   	
Baiting 
	
 
1107

Explanation 217. Correct Answer: C. Disinformation. The 
spread of deliberately false information to deceive or harm, 
especially in sensitive areas like politics, is classified as 
disinformation. 
Disinformation campaigns aim to deceive audiences by 
presenting false information as if it’s true. In political scenarios, 
this can have significant ramifications, affecting public opinion 
and the outcome of elections. 
Option A is incorrect. Impersonation involves pretending to be 
someone else to deceive, but the scenario doesn’t indicate that 
the anonymous group is impersonating anyone. 
Option B is incorrect. Smishing is a type of phishing attack 
that uses SMS. It doesn’t relate to spreading false information in 
articles. 
Option D is incorrect. Baiting involves enticing victims with 
something they want (like free software) to steal their personal 
information or to spread malware. It doesn’t involve the spread 
of false information as described in the scenario. 
Question 218. A multinational company is considering using a 
cloud storage provider based in a foreign country to store 
customer data. The company’s home country has strict data 
protection laws that require customer data to remain within its 
borders. Which of the following considerations is MOST 
critical for the company when choosing the cloud storage 
provider? 
 (A)   	
The speed of data access from the foreign-based cloud 
	
 
1108

storage 
 (B)   	
The encryption standards used by the foreign cloud 
provider 
 (C)   	
Whether the foreign cloud provider offers data 
storage exclusively within the company's home country 
 (D)   	
The reputation and customer reviews of the foreign 
cloud provider 
Explanation 218. Correct Answer: C. Whether the foreign 
cloud provider offers data storage exclusively within the 
company’s home country. Data sovereignty refers to the 
concept that digital data is subject to the laws of the country in 
which it is located. If a company’s home country has regulations 
that require customer data to stay within its borders, it’s 
essential to ensure that the cloud provider offers storage that 
complies with this requirement. 
Option A is incorrect. While speed of data access is important, 
it doesn’t address the data sovereignty concern. 
Option B is incorrect. While encryption is essential for 
security, it doesn’t guarantee compliance with data sovereignty 
laws. 
Option D is incorrect. Reputation is important, but it doesn’t 
directly address the specific requirement of data sovereignty. 
Question 219. BetaTech, a tech manufacturing firm, wants to 
ensure that a potential compromise of its IoT devices will not 
endanger its primary manufacturing control systems. Which of 
the following approaches would be most effective in achieving 
	
 
1109

this? 
 (A)   	
Using a single robust firewall for the entire network 
 (B)   	
Periodic password changes for IoT devices 
 (C) 	  Segmenting the IoT devices from the manufacturing 
control systems 
 (D)   	
Enabling automatic updates for all IoT devices 
Explanation 219. Correct Answer: C. Segmenting the IoT 
devices from the manufacturing control systems. By 
segmenting the IoT devices from the primary manufacturing 
control systems, BetaTech ensures that a compromise of the IoT 
devices doesn’t immediately put the control systems at risk. 
Segmentation acts as a barrier to restrict the potential spread of 
malicious activity. 
Option A is incorrect. While a robust firewall is crucial for 
network security, it does not replace the need for segmentation, 
especially with varied devices and risk profiles. 
Option B is incorrect. Although periodic password changes 
can enhance the security of IoT devices, it does not prevent a 
compromised IoT device from affecting other parts of the 
network. 
Option D is incorrect. Automatic updates can fix known 
vulnerabilities in IoT devices, but they don’t provide the 
isolation that segmentation offers to prevent a compromise from 
affecting other network segments. 
Question 220. A software company is developing a new cloud-
based application where clients can store and manage their 
	
 
1110

customer contact details. The stored data does not include 
financial or medical information but does contain phone 
numbers and email addresses. How should this information be 
classified? 
(A)       Public 
(B)       Restricted 
(C)       Sensitive 
(D)       Classified 
Explanation 220. Correct Answer: C. Sensitive. Phone 
numbers and email addresses are considered Personally 
Identifiable Information (PII) and should be classified as 
sensitive since unauthorized access could lead to privacy 
violations or misuse. 
Option A is incorrect. Public classification is for data that is 
intended for general access and holds no confidential 
information. 
Option B is incorrect. Restricted typically applies to data that 
is more confidential than sensitive data, such as financial or 
strategic data. 
Option D is incorrect. Classified is a more general term and 
can encompass various levels of data classification, including 
Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential, typically used in 
government sectors. 
Question 221. A multinational company wants to allow its 
remote employees to securely access the corporate intranet over 
the Internet. The company’s primary concern is to ensure data 
	
 
1111

confidentiality and integrity during transit. Which solution 
should the company implement? 
(A)       VLAN 
(B)       VPN 
(C)       NAC 
(D)       DMZ 
Explanation 221. Correct Answer: B. VPN. A Virtual Private 
Network (VPN) allows remote users to establish a secure 
connection to an organization’s internal network over the public 
internet. It encrypts the data in transit, ensuring both 
confidentiality and integrity. 
Option A is incorrect. A VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) 
is used to segment network traffic within a local network, but it 
does not provide encryption or a method for secure remote 
access. 
Option C is incorrect. NAC (Network Access Control) is a 
security solution that enforces policy on devices attempting to 
access network resources, but it doesn’t inherently provide 
encrypted communication over the internet. 
Option D is incorrect. DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) is a network 
segment that acts as a buffer between an organization’s internal 
network and untrusted external networks. It doesn’t provide 
encrypted communication for remote users. 
Question 222. A financial firm outsources its payment 
processing to a third-party service provider. After a series of 
fraudulent transactions, it was discovered that the service 
	
 
1112

provider was not employing the latest encryption standards 
when transmitting data. Which vulnerability related to supply 
chain does this scenario highlight? 
(A)       Inadequate vendor background checks 
(B)       Service provider's outdated security practices 
(C)       Deficient hardware components from a supplier 
(D)       Software with embedded backdoors 
Explanation 222. Correct Answer: B. Service provider’s 
outdated security practices. Supply chain vulnerabilities 
encompass risks originating from third-party vendors and 
service providers. In this scenario, the third-party service 
provider’s failure to use current encryption standards for 
transmitting data exemplifies a vulnerability that arises due to 
outdated security practices by the service provider. 
Option A is incorrect. While vendor background checks are 
essential, the scenario does not specifically point towards a 
problem with the vendor’s background. It focuses on their 
encryption practices. 
Option C is incorrect. The scenario doesn’t mention hardware 
components or any issues related to them. 
Option D is incorrect. The issue here pertains to encryption 
standards, not to software with embedded backdoors. 
Question 223. A popular online shopping platform noticed that 
some product reviews contained a strange link which, when 
clicked, led users to a site that resembled the platform but 
harvested login credentials. What vulnerability in the review 
	
 
1113

system might have allowed attackers to post such links? 
(A)       Session Hijacking 
(B)       Cross-site scripting (XSS) 
(C)       Password Spraying 
(D)       Credential Stuffing 
Explanation 223. Correct Answer: B. Cross-site scripting 
(XSS). XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious 
scripts into web content. If the platform’s review system does 
not properly sanitize input, it could permit attackers to embed 
malicious links that lead to phishing sites. 
Cross-site scripting attacks exploit vulnerabilities in web 
applications to insert malicious scripts. In this case, the ability 
to post malicious links within product reviews is an indication 
of an XSS vulnerability. When unsuspecting users click on these 
links, they are redirected to phishing sites designed to steal their 
credentials. 
Option A is incorrect. Session Hijacking involves taking over 
an active user session. It doesn’t involve posting malicious links 
in website content. 
Option C is incorrect. Password Spraying involves attempting 
to authenticate against many user accounts with a few 
commonly used passwords. It doesn’t involve embedding 
malicious links in website content. 
Option D is incorrect. Credential Stuffing attacks involve 
automated attempts to gain access using large sets of valid 
	
 
1114

usernames and passwords. It isn’t related to the insertion of 
malicious links in web content. 
Question 224. An organization has decided to focus on securing 
its database servers where customer details and transaction 
records are stored. This data is not being actively accessed or 
processed. Which type of security measure would be MOST 
appropriate for this type of data? 
(A)       VLData Loss Prevention (DLP) for emailAN 
(B)       Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
(C)       Full Disk Encryption (FDE) 
(D)       Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for network traffic 
Explanation 224. Correct Answer: C. Full Disk Encryption 
(FDE). Data at rest refers to data that is not actively moving 
through the network, such as data stored on hard drives. Full 
Disk Encryption (FDE) is a security measure specifically 
designed to protect data at rest by encrypting the entire hard 
drive. 
Option A is incorrect. DLP for email primarily focuses on 
preventing unauthorized data transfers via email and is more 
suited for data in transit rather than data at rest. 
Option B is incorrect. WAF protects web applications from 
various online threats and is not specifically tailored to protect 
data at rest. 
Option D is incorrect. An IDS for network traffic mainly 
focuses on monitoring and detecting malicious activity in 
	
 
1115

network traffic, which pertains to data in transit and not data at 
rest. 
Question 225. XYZ Corp. has recently developed a new 
manufacturing process that reduces production costs by 50%. 
This process is not yet patented and is considered a trade secret. 
The company wants to ensure that employees do not disclose 
this process to competitors. Which of the following would be 
the MOST effective strategy to achieve this? 
(A)       Providing employees with a bonus for keeping the 
process confidential 
(B)       Conducting random checks of employee 
communications 
(C)       Implementing a mandatory non-disclosure 
agreement (NDA) for all employees 
(D)       Hosting quarterly seminars to educate employees about 
the value of the trade secret 
Explanation 225. Correct Answer: C. Implementing a 
mandatory non-disclosure agreement (NDA) for all 
employees. An NDA is a legally binding contract that prohibits 
employees from disclosing confidential information, like trade 
secrets. If an employee breaches the NDA, the company has 
legal grounds to seek damages or other remedies. 
Option A is incorrect. While bonuses might provide an 
incentive for employees, it doesn’t provide a binding legal 
framework to protect the trade secret. 
	
 
1116

Option B is incorrect. Random checks can deter some 
employees but might not be effective across the board and could 
also lead to trust issues within the organization. 
Option D is incorrect. While education is essential and can 
instill a sense of responsibility, it doesn’t provide a legal means 
to protect the trade secret as an NDA does. 
Question 226. While analyzing a vulnerability in a company’s 
web application, the security team refers to a specific CVE to 
understand the vulnerability’s details. They further assess its 
CVSS score to decide on the remediation urgency. Which of the 
following best describes the purpose of the CVE and CVSS in 
this context? 
(A)       CVE provides a severity score, while CVSS gives a 
unique identifier for the vulnerability 
(B)       CVE and CVSS both offer a scoring mechanism to rank 
vulnerabilities 
(C)       CVE provides a unique identifier, while CVSS offers 
a standardized severity score 
(D)       CVE and CVSS are regulatory requirements for all 
software applications 
Explanation 226. Correct Answer: C. CVE provides a 
unique identifier, while CVSS offers a standardized severity 
score. CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) offers a 
standardized identifier for vulnerabilities, ensuring clear 
communication and reference. CVSS (Common Vulnerability 
Scoring System) provides a standardized method for rating the 
severity of vulnerabilities, enabling organizations to prioritize 
remediation. 
	
 
1117

Option A is incorrect. It’s the opposite. CVE gives a unique 
identifier, while CVSS provides a severity score. 
Option B is incorrect. Only CVSS offers a scoring mechanism 
to rank vulnerabilities. CVE offers unique identifiers. 
Option D is incorrect. While using CVE and CVSS can be 
considered best practices, they aren’t regulatory requirements 
for all software applications. 
Question 227. During a security assessment, Maria, a security 
consultant, identifies a self-signed certificate being used on a 
client’s public-facing web server. What is the PRIMARY 
security concern related to this finding? 
(A)       The web server might be vulnerable to Distributed 
Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks 
(B)       The certificate could be expired 
(C)       Users cannot validate the authenticity of the website 
easily 
(D)       The web server might not support modern encryption 
algorithms 
Explanation 227. Correct Answer: C. Users cannot validate 
the authenticity of the website easily. Self-signed certificates 
are not signed by a recognized Certificate Authority. As a result, 
when users connect to a website using a self-signed certificate, 
they typically receive a warning that the certificate is not 
trusted. This poses a risk as users cannot easily validate the 
authenticity of the website, making them more susceptible to 
man-in-the-middle attacks. 
	
 
1118

Option A is incorrect. While DDoS attacks are a concern for 
public-facing web servers, they aren’t directly related to the use 
of self-signed certificates. 
Option B is incorrect. Any certificate, whether self-signed or 
CA-signed, can expire. However, expiration is not the primary 
concern related to the use of self-signed certificates on public-
facing servers. 
Option D is incorrect. The use of modern encryption 
algorithms is independent of whether a certificate is self-signed 
or not. 
Question 228. Julia, a security administrator, is concerned 
about potential unauthorized access to confidential project files 
stored on a company server. She decides to place a document 
within the project folders that seems enticing but is actually 
monitored for access. This strategy aims to detect if someone is 
accessing files without authorization. What is this document 
commonly known as? 
(A)       Salt file 
(B)       Honeyfile 
(C)       Log file 
(D)       Backup file 
Explanation 228. Correct Answer: B. Honeyfile. A honeyfile 
is a monitored file placed intentionally to act as a decoy. If 
accessed, it can provide an alert that someone might be 
accessing files without proper authorization, or it might be an 
indication of a potential insider threat. 
	
 
1119

Option A is incorrect. A salt is random data that is used as an 
additional input to a one-way function that hashes data or 
passwords. It isn’t a decoy file. 
Option C is incorrect. A log file records events in an operating 
system or other software to aid in troubleshooting and activity 
monitoring, but it isn’t used as a deceptive measure. 
Option D is incorrect. A backup file is a copy of a file or 
database that can be used for data recovery. It’s not a decoy to 
detect unauthorized access. 
Question 229. A security auditor found that a website’s login 
form returns detailed error messages like “Incorrect column 
name” or “Table not found.” Which type of vulnerability could 
attackers potentially exploit using this information? 
(A)       Brute Force Attack 
(B)       Structured Query Language injection (SQLi) 
(C)       Man-in-the-Middle Attack 
(D)       Session Hijacking 
Explanation 229. Correct Answer: B. Structured Query 
Language injection (SQLi). When websites provide detailed 
database error messages, it can give attackers clues about the 
database structure, making it easier for them to craft successful 
SQL injection attacks. 
By returning detailed database error messages, the website 
inadvertently provides attackers with valuable insights into the 
database structure and potential points of vulnerability. This can 
	
 
1120

be used to refine and enhance SQLi attacks, enabling attackers 
to potentially access, modify, or delete data. 
Option A is incorrect. A Brute Force Attack involves trying 
many passwords or passphrases to guess the right one. Detailed 
error messages from a database are not typically used in brute 
force attacks. 
Option C is incorrect. Man-in-the-Middle Attack intercepts 
and possibly alters the communication between two parties. 
Database error messages are not directly related to this type of 
attack. 
Option D is incorrect. Session Hijacking involves taking over 
an active user session. Detailed database error messages don’t 
play a direct role in this type of attack. 
Question 230. A law firm is transitioning to a digital storage 
system and wants to ensure that client records and case files are 
protected from unauthorized access. Which of the following 
would be the BEST strategy to ensure the confidentiality of 
legal information stored digitally? 
(A)       Conducting regular penetration testing on the digital 
storage system 
(B)       Encrypting the client records and case files 
(C)       Applying watermarks to digital documents 
(D)       Limiting physical access to the server room 
Explanation 230. Correct Answer: B. Encrypting the client 
records and case files. Encryption is the process of converting 
information into an unreadable format unless one has the 
	
 
1121

appropriate decryption key. By encrypting legal documents, 
unauthorized individuals, even if they gain access to the storage 
system, won’t be able to comprehend the content of the 
documents. 
Option A is incorrect. While regular penetration testing is 
essential to identify vulnerabilities in a system, it does not 
directly protect the confidentiality of stored legal information. 
Option C is incorrect. Watermarking documents can deter 
copying or unauthorized distribution, but it doesn’t prevent 
unauthorized access or reading of the documents. 
Option D is incorrect. Limiting physical access to the server 
room can prevent unauthorized physical access, but it does not 
safeguard against digital breaches or protect the content of the 
files. 
Question 231. While conducting a routine security review, 
Jake, a security specialist, discovers an unexpected piece of data 
placed in the organization’s financial system. Upon asking, he 
learns that this piece of data is intentionally placed and 
monitored to see if any unauthorized user or system interacts 
with it. What is this deceptive piece of data known as? 
(A)       Honeystring 
(B)       Honeytoken 
(C)       Canary token 
(D)       Security marker 
Explanation 231. Correct Answer: B. Honeytoken. 
Honeytokens are strategically placed deceptive pieces of data 
	
 
1122

that have no actual value or real-world use but are closely 
monitored. Their sole purpose is to detect unauthorized 
interactions, as any access or use of a honeytoken is likely 
malicious or unauthorized. 
Option A is incorrect. There isn’t a commonly recognized 
security term known as “Honeystring” in the context described. 
Option C is incorrect. Canary tokens are a specific type of 
honeytoken and can serve the same purpose. However, given 
the choices provided and the context of the question, 
“Honeytoken” is the most accurate answer. 
Option D is incorrect. A security marker, in a general sense, 
can be any mark or indicator used for security purposes, but it 
isn’t specifically a deceptive piece of data placed to detect 
unauthorized access. 
Question 232. You are a security consultant for a company that 
uses a cloud-based infrastructure. During a security review, you 
discover that there are no boundaries defined between the 
company’s development, testing, and production environments 
in the cloud. This can lead to unintended interactions and data 
leaks. What kind of vulnerability is this scenario illustrating? 
(A)       Insecure API endpoints 
(B)       Weak encryption methods 
(C)       Lack of resource isolation 
(D)       Insufficient backup strategies 
Explanation 232. Correct Answer: C. Lack of resource 
isolation. Cloud-specific vulnerabilities can arise due to the 
	
 
1123

shared nature of the cloud infrastructure. In this scenario, not 
having boundaries or isolation between different environments 
like development, testing, and production can lead to 
vulnerabilities. If there is no proper resource isolation, 
malicious code introduced in the development environment 
could make its way to production or confidential production 
data might be exposed in testing, leading to potential data 
breaches. 
Option A is incorrect. Insecure API endpoints would pertain to 
vulnerabilities where APIs used to manage and interact with 
cloud services are not properly secured. 
Option B is incorrect. Weak encryption methods refer to the 
use of outdated or vulnerable encryption algorithms, which 
would not directly relate to the mixing of environments. 
Option D is incorrect. Insufficient backup strategies would 
relate to not having adequate data backup and recovery 
mechanisms, which is a different concern from resource 
isolation. 
Question 233. AlphaCorp is in the final stages of selecting a 
cybersecurity consultant. One of the shortlisted firms, 
SecureWorld, recently hired AlphaCorp’s former CISO as a 
senior consultant. Given this situation, what should be 
AlphaCorp’s immediate concern during vendor selection? 
(A)       The expertise the former CISO brings to SecureWorld 
(B)       The possibility that SecureWorld could offer a 
discounted price 
	
 
1124

(C)       Potential conflict of interest due to prior associations 
(D)       SecureWorld's global presence and reputation 
Explanation 233. Correct Answer: C. Potential conflict of 
interest due to prior associations. Having the former CISO of 
AlphaCorp in a senior role at SecureWorld might raise concerns 
about potential conflicts of interest. It’s essential to ensure that 
decisions are made objectively, and there’s no bias due to prior 
associations. 
Option A is incorrect. While the expertise of the former CISO 
is valuable, it’s not the primary concern in this context of 
potential conflict of interest. 
Option B is incorrect. Pricing and discounts are not the 
primary concern related to potential conflicts of interest in 
vendor selection. 
Option D is incorrect. While global presence and reputation 
are essential factors for vendor selection, they do not directly 
address the issue of potential conflict of interest arising from the 
former CISO’s position. 
Question 234. An IT technician is performing a routine security 
audit of a company’s server room. She discovers a server with 
outdated firmware that hasn’t been updated for two years. What 
potential vulnerability does the outdated firmware expose the 
server to? 
(A)       SQL Injection 
(B)       Physical tampering 
	
 
1125

(C)       Unpatched exploits 
(D)       Credential stuffing 
Explanation 234. Correct Answer: C. Unpatched exploits. 
Firmware, like software, receives updates to fix known 
vulnerabilities. If firmware is outdated, it can leave systems 
susceptible to known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. 
Firmware serves as the foundational software for hardware 
devices. When firmware is not updated regularly, it may contain 
vulnerabilities that were patched in later versions. These 
vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited by attackers, putting 
the device and connected systems at risk. 
Option A is incorrect. SQL Injection is a vulnerability 
associated with databases and web applications, not firmware. 
Option B is incorrect. Physical tampering pertains to someone 
physically accessing and altering a device. While firmware 
vulnerabilities can sometimes lead to physical tampering 
(through boot-level attacks), the direct link between outdated 
firmware and physical tampering is not as strong as the link to 
unpatched exploits. 
Option D is incorrect. Credential stuffing is an attack method 
that involves using known username-password pairs to gain 
unauthorized access. It isn’t directly related to firmware 
vulnerabilities. 
Question 235. As part of the company’s vulnerability 
management initiative, the security team has decided to conduct 
	
 
1126

a series of penetration tests. Which of the following is the 
PRIMARY reason for incorporating penetration testing as a 
threat identification method? 
(A)       To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements 
(B)       To validate the efficiency of security awareness training 
(C)       To actively exploit vulnerabilities and assess 
potential impact 
(D)       To identify misconfigurations in the SIEM system 
Explanation 235. Correct Answer: C. To actively exploit 
vulnerabilities and assess potential impact. Penetration 
testing is a method used to actively exploit vulnerabilities in an 
environment. Its primary purpose is to determine the potential 
impact and risk of those vulnerabilities in a real-world scenario, 
thereby allowing the organization to understand and prioritize 
remediation efforts. 
Option A is incorrect. While some regulations might require 
penetration testing, the primary goal of the test is not just for 
compliance but to understand vulnerabilities’ potential impact. 
Option B is incorrect. Although penetration testing can 
sometimes be used to gauge the effectiveness of security 
training (for instance, in social engineering tests), it’s not the 
primary reason for conducting these tests. 
Option D is incorrect. SIEM systems are used for logging and 
event management. While a pen test might uncover 
misconfigurations in various systems, its primary purpose is not 
to focus on the SIEM. 
	
 
1127

Question 236. Globex Industries is expanding its data centers 
across multiple geographic locations. The IT team wants to have 
a centralized system to get real-time status, outages, and metrics 
of all data center infrastructures. Which of the following 
solutions would be the MOST effective for this purpose? 
(A)       Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools 
(B)       Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection 
(C)       Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) 
(D)       Infrastructure Management Platform (IMP) 
Explanation 236. Correct Answer: D. Infrastructure 
Management Platform (IMP). IMPs provide centralized 
control and monitoring for infrastructure across multiple sites. 
They deliver insights into infrastructure health, outages, and 
metrics, ensuring that the IT team can address issues promptly. 
Option A is incorrect. DLP tools focus on preventing 
unauthorized data transfers and exfiltrations, not on monitoring 
infrastructure health and status. 
Option B is incorrect. DDoS protection tools safeguard against 
denial-of-service attacks but aren’t designed to monitor the 
overall health or metrics of data center infrastructures. 
Option C is incorrect. While SIEM solutions centralize log 
data and provide insights into security events, they are not 
designed primarily to monitor data center infrastructure health 
across multiple locations. 
Question 237. After undergoing a major infrastructure upgrade, 
GlobalMed Corp experienced several unanticipated security 
	
 
1128

issues. In retrospect, the IT manager realized they skipped an 
essential step in their change management process which could 
have predicted and mitigated these issues. What step did they 
most likely overlook? 
(A)       Procurement of new hardware 
(B)       Training of IT staff on the new systems 
(C)       Impact analysis 
(D)       Integration with legacy systems 
Explanation 237. Correct Answer: C. Impact analysis. An 
impact analysis is vital in the change management process as it 
evaluates the potential ramifications of a proposed change. By 
conducting this analysis, organizations can anticipate potential 
security challenges and mitigate them before implementing the 
change. 
Option A is incorrect. While procurement is essential, merely 
purchasing new hardware wouldn’t directly help in predicting or 
mitigating potential security issues stemming from an 
infrastructure upgrade. 
Option B is incorrect. Training IT staff is essential for effective 
implementation and operation, but it doesn’t directly address 
predicting and understanding potential security consequences of 
the upgrade. 
Option D is incorrect. Integration with legacy systems is a 
crucial consideration, especially for compatibility. However, the 
focus of the scenario is on predicting and understanding 
potential security issues, which is primarily addressed through 
an impact analysis.

Question 238. Sarah, a software developer at a tech company, 
decided to gain root access to her company-issued mobile 
device to customize its features. Soon after, the IT department 
detected unauthorized data transmissions from her device. 
Which mobile vulnerability is most likely associated with her 
actions? 
(A)       Side loading of applications 
(B)       Inconsistent OS updates 
(C)       Mobile device jailbreaking 
(D)       Use of open Wi-Fi networks 
Explanation 238. Correct Answer: C. Mobile device 
jailbreaking. Jailbreaking is the process of removing the 
restrictions imposed by the manufacturer on certain devices, 
thereby allowing root access. With this root access, users can 
install and customize software that hasn’t been approved by the 
device’s manufacturer or carrier. However, jailbreaking can 
expose the device to various security vulnerabilities, as 
indicated by unauthorized data transmissions. 
Option A is incorrect. Side loading refers to the installation of 
applications from sources other than the official app store. 
While side loading can pose security risks, Sarah’s actions 
specifically relate to gaining root access, which points to 
jailbreaking. 
Option B is incorrect. Inconsistent OS updates refer to the 
presence of various versions of an OS across different devices. 
Sarah’s actions are related to obtaining root access, not 
inconsistent updates. 
	
 
1130

Option D is incorrect. Using open Wi-Fi networks can expose 
mobile devices to threats, but Sarah’s vulnerability arose from 
gaining root access, not from her choice of Wi-Fi networks. 
Question 239. Jenna, a web administrator for a growing online 
retail business, is in the process of obtaining SSL certificates for 
the company’s domain. The company uses several subdomains 
for different services, such as shop.example.com, 
blog.example.com, and support.example.com. Instead of 
obtaining individual certificates for each subdomain, Jenna 
wants to use one certificate. What type of certificate should 
Jenna pursue? 
(A)       Extended Validation Certificate 
(B)       Wildcard Certificate 
(C)       Certificate with Subject Alternative Names (SAN) 
(D)       Code Signing Certificate 
Explanation 239. Correct Answer: B. Wildcard Certificate. 
A Wildcard Certificate is designed to secure a domain and its 
subdomains under the same top-level domain. For example, a 
wildcard certificate for *.example.com would secure 
shop.example.com, blog.example.com, and any other 
subdomain of example.com. 
Option A is incorrect. An Extended Validation Certificate 
provides the highest level of validation but does not necessarily 
cover multiple subdomains by default. 
Option C is incorrect. While a Certificate with Subject 
Alternative Names (SAN) can secure multiple domains and 
	
 
1131

subdomains, it is not specifically tailored for all subdomains 
under a single domain as the Wildcard Certificate is. 
Option D is incorrect. A Code Signing Certificate is used to 
sign software code, ensuring its integrity and authenticity, not 
for securing domains or subdomains. 
Question 240. CyberLock Inc. is assessing the security postures 
of its third-party vendors to determine potential risks. The 
cybersecurity team wants to gather foundational security 
information from each vendor to evaluate their security maturity 
and practices. What would be the most cost-effective and 
efficient way to collect this data from a large number of 
vendors? 
(A)       Conduct a penetration test for each vendor 
(B)       Send out security questionnaires to each vendor 
(C)       Visit each vendor's site for an in-person assessment 
(D)       Review the annual financial reports of each vendor  
Explanation 240. Correct Answer: B. Send out security 
questionnaires to each vendor. Security questionnaires are 
commonly used to gather foundational security information 
from third-party vendors. They are cost-effective and can 
efficiently collect standardized data from a large number of 
vendors to evaluate their security posture and practices. 
Option A is incorrect. Conducting a penetration test for each 
vendor would be resource-intensive, costly, and may not 
provide the foundational information about the vendor’s 
security practices. 
	
 
1132

Option C is incorrect. Visiting each vendor’s site for an in-
person assessment would be time-consuming, costly, and 
logistically challenging, especially when dealing with a large 
number of vendors. 
Option D is incorrect. Annual financial reports provide 
financial data and do not offer in-depth details on a vendor’s 
security posture or practices. 
Question 241. A developer has implemented a new feature on a 
company’s website that allows users to search for products by 
their names. Within a few days, the IT team noticed abnormal 
activities where entire tables from the database were being 
dumped. Which vulnerability might the new feature have 
introduced? 
(A)       Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
(B)       Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) 
(C)       Structured Query Language injection (SQLi) 
(D)       Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
Explanation 241. Correct Answer: C. Structured Query 
Language injection (SQLi). SQLi attacks occur when an 
attacker can insert or “inject” SQL code into a query. If user 
input is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL 
statements, attackers can exploit this to manipulate the queries, 
which can lead to unauthorized viewing of data, corrupting or 
deleting data, and other malicious activities. 
Structured Query Language injection, or SQLi, is a code 
injection technique that attackers use to run malicious SQL 
statements on a database. Given that entire tables from the 
	
 
1133

database were dumped after implementing a search feature, it’s 
a clear indication that the feature did not properly sanitize user 
input, allowing for SQLi. 
Option A is incorrect. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks inject 
malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users. It doesn’t 
lead to dumping of database tables as described in the scenario. 
Option B is incorrect. Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) 
attacks overwhelm a target with traffic, causing service 
interruptions. It’s not related to the extraction of database 
information. 
Option D is incorrect. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
tricks victims into submitting malicious requests. It doesn’t 
result in the dumping of database tables. 
Question 242. DeltaSoft has released a new web application. 
The security team is tasked with observing the application’s 
behavior and responses when it is running to identify potential 
vulnerabilities. Which method is most appropriate for this 
purpose? 
(A)       Static Analysis 
(B)       Fuzz Testing 
(C)       Whitebox Testing 
(D)       Dynamic Analysis 
Explanation 242. Correct Answer: D. Dynamic Analysis. 
Dynamic analysis focuses on examining an application during 
its execution, or runtime. By observing the application’s 
	
 
1134

behavior and responses, security teams can identify 
vulnerabilities that might not be evident in the static code. 
Option A is incorrect. Static analysis evaluates an application’s 
code without executing the application. It does not focus on 
observing the application’s behavior during runtime. 
Option B is incorrect. Fuzz testing involves submitting random 
inputs to an application to observe its behavior and detect 
vulnerabilities, but it’s just one subset of dynamic analysis. 
Option C is incorrect. Whitebox testing involves 
understanding the internal structures and workings of an 
application while testing, which can be part of static or dynamic 
testing, but on its own, it does not specifically focus on runtime 
behavior observation. 
Question 243. GlobalTech, a multinational corporation, is 
negotiating a cloud storage contract with CloudCorp. 
GlobalTech wants to ensure that data retrieval times remain 
under 2 seconds 99.9% of the time. Which component should be 
explicitly defined in their agreement to set this expectation? 
(A)       Pricing model 
(B)       Data sovereignty clauses 
(C)       Service-level agreement (SLA) 
(D)       Termination clauses 
Explanation 243. Correct Answer: C. Service-level 
agreement (SLA). Service-level agreements (SLAs) are 
designed to define specific metrics, responsibilities, and 
expectations to ensure that both parties understand and agree to 
	
 
1135

the performance benchmarks and consequences if those 
benchmarks are not achieved. In this scenario, the SLA would 
specify the expected data retrieval times. 
Option A is incorrect. While pricing is an essential aspect of 
any contract, it does not specify performance expectations like 
data retrieval times. 
Option B is incorrect. Data sovereignty clauses pertain to the 
legal aspects of where data is stored and processed, not to 
performance metrics. 
Option D is incorrect. Termination clauses deal with the 
conditions under which the agreement might be terminated, not 
with performance expectations. 
Question 244. SoftTech Inc., a software company, is 
considering expanding its operations to Europe. They will be 
collecting and processing personal data of EU citizens. Which 
of the following legal implications is MOST critical for 
SoftTech Inc. to consider? 
 (A)       The need to register with each country's software 
association 
(B)       Compliance with the General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) 
(C)       Ensuring software patent rights in each European 
country 
(D)       The European standard for software coding 
Explanation 244. Correct Answer: B. Compliance with the 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). When dealing 
	
 
1136

with personal data of EU citizens, companies must comply with 
the GDPR, which outlines strict requirements on data protection 
and privacy. Non-compliance can lead to hefty fines and legal 
repercussions. 
Option A is incorrect. Registering with each country’s software 
association is not related to the privacy and legal implications of 
processing personal data. 
Option C is incorrect. While software patent rights are 
essential, they don’t directly address the privacy concerns of 
processing personal data of EU citizens. 
Option D is incorrect. There is no “European standard for 
software coding” that relates to the privacy of personal data. 
The critical concern is data protection and privacy regulations 
like the GDPR. 
Question 245. A multinational organization recently 
experienced a significant security breach. After investigating, it 
was determined that a change to the network infrastructure was 
made without undergoing the standard approval process. As a 
result, there was a misconfiguration which allowed 
unauthorized access. What security principle related to change 
management did the organization neglect? 
(A)       Configuration baseline reviews 
(B)       Least privilege enforcement 
(C)       Approval process adherence 
(D)       Patch management 
	
 
1137

Explanation 245. Correct Answer: C. Approval process 
adherence. The approval process is a critical aspect of change 
management. Before any changes are made, especially to 
critical systems like network infrastructure, they need to 
undergo a rigorous approval process. This ensures that multiple 
experts evaluate the change for potential vulnerabilities or 
issues. In this scenario, skipping the approval process led to a 
significant security breach. 
Option A is incorrect. Configuration baseline reviews involve 
regularly checking and ensuring that systems are configured as 
per the organization’s approved baseline. While it’s important, 
the issue in the scenario was directly related to bypassing the 
approval process. 
Option B is incorrect. Least privilege enforcement means 
providing only the minimal necessary access to users to perform 
their tasks. This scenario doesn’t deal with access rights or 
privileges. 
Option D is incorrect. Patch management concerns the process 
of applying updates to software and systems. The breach in the 
question wasn’t related to missing patches but was due to 
bypassing the approval process. 
Question 246. Carlos, an IT consultant, advises a startup 
company on cybersecurity best practices. The company plans to 
launch several microsites under various subdomains. They want 
a solution that is cost-effective but also ensures that the sites are 
validated by a third-party. What type of certificate should Carlos 
recommend? 
	
 
1138

(A)       A separate self-signed certificate for each microsite 
(B)       An individual third-party certificate for each subdomain 
(C)       A third-party wildcard certificate 
(D)       An EV certificate issued by an internal CA 
Explanation 246. Correct Answer: C. A third-party wildcard 
certificate. A third-party wildcard certificate allows an 
organization to secure multiple subdomains with a single 
certificate. It’s cost-effective as the company doesn’t need to 
purchase and manage separate certificates for each subdomain, 
and because it’s issued by a third-party Certificate Authority, it 
provides validation for external users. 
Option A is incorrect. Self-signed certificates won’t provide 
third-party validation, which could result in trust issues for 
external users. 
Option B is incorrect. While individual third-party certificates 
for each subdomain will provide third-party validation, this 
approach would not be as cost-effective as a wildcard 
certificate. 
Option D is incorrect. An EV certificate provides high 
assurance, but one issued by an internal CA will not be 
inherently trusted by external users. 
Question 247. Two university research departments, UniAlpha 
and UniBeta, decide to collaborate on a project exploring 
quantum computing’s security implications. They need an 
agreement to express mutual intentions without enforcing 
legally binding obligations. Which document is most suitable 
	
 
1139

for their needs? 
(A)       Service-level agreement (SLA) 
(B)       Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) 
(C)       Memorandum of understanding (MOU) 
(D)       Licensing agreement 
Explanation 247. Correct Answer: C. Memorandum of 
understanding (MOU). A Memorandum of Understanding 
(MOU) serves as a formal agreement between parties to signal 
mutual intentions without necessarily introducing legally 
binding terms. Given that UniAlpha and UniBeta want to 
signify their shared intentions on a collaborative research 
project, an MOU is the most appropriate choice. 
Option A is incorrect. An SLA is typically between a service 
provider and a customer and details the level of service 
expected. 
Option B is incorrect. An NDA focuses on the confidentiality 
of information shared between parties. 
Option D is incorrect. A licensing agreement concerns the 
rights to use, distribute, or reproduce software or intellectual 
property. 
Question 248. A system administrator notices that an 
unauthorized user was able to obtain elevated privileges on a 
server, even though the default account settings were configured 
correctly. Upon investigation, it was found that the server’s 
operating system had not been updated for several months. 
What type of vulnerability was likely exploited? 
	
 
1140

(A)       Application Misconfiguration 
(B)       OS Patch Management Issue 
(C)       Weak Encryption Algorithm 
(D)       Password Reuse Attack 
Explanation 248. Correct Answer: B. OS Patch 
Management Issue. When operating systems are not regularly 
updated, they become vulnerable to known exploits that have 
since been patched by vendors. An attacker can take advantage 
of these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized elevated privileges. 
Operating system-based vulnerabilities often arise due to missed 
patches or updates. Keeping the OS updated is crucial because 
vendors frequently release patches to address known 
vulnerabilities. In this case, the lapse in updating the operating 
system opened a window for attackers to exploit and obtain 
elevated privileges. 
Option A is incorrect. Application Misconfiguration pertains to 
incorrect settings or configurations in software applications, not 
operating systems. The scenario does not suggest any issues 
with application settings. 
Option C is incorrect. Weak Encryption Algorithm refers to 
encryption that can be easily decrypted or broken due to flaws 
in the algorithm itself. The scenario doesn’t mention encryption 
or decryption problems. 
Option D is incorrect. Password Reuse Attack involves an 
attacker using previously breached passwords to access 
	
 
1141

different accounts. The scenario doesn’t indicate password-
related issues. 
Question 249. Jane, an accountant in a multinational 
corporation, received an email from what seemed to be the 
company’s IT department. The email had the company’s logo, 
colors, and font and urged Jane to click on a link to reset her 
password due to “suspicious activity.” However, upon close 
inspection, Jane noticed a minor spelling error in the domain 
name of the sender’s email address. What type of attack does 
this scenario describe? 
(A)       Spear Phishing 
(B)       Vishing 
(C)       Baiting 
(D)       Brand Impersonation 
Explanation 249. Correct Answer: D. Brand Impersonation. 
The attacker has mimicked the company’s branding in an 
attempt to deceive the recipient into thinking the 
communication is legitimate. 
Brand impersonation involves attackers mimicking or 
replicating the branding of a reputable company or organization 
in an attempt to trick users into thinking the communication is 
legitimate. This tactic is commonly used in phishing emails to 
mislead recipients into providing sensitive information or 
clicking on malicious links. 
Option A is incorrect. Spear Phishing is targeted phishing 
aimed specifically at one individual or a small group. While 
Jane might be specifically targeted, the defining feature of this 
	
 
1142

attack is the impersonation of the company’s branding, making 
it brand impersonation. 
Option B is incorrect. Vishing involves voice communication 
or phone calls, and the scenario describes an email-based attack. 
Option C is incorrect. Baiting typically offers something 
enticing to lure victims. There’s no offer or lure in the described 
scenario. 
Question 250. As the Chief Security Officer (CSO) of 
AlphaTech, you are in the process of finalizing a partnership 
agreement with a third-party provider. To ensure ongoing 
security compliance and transparency, you want to reserve the 
right for your organization to inspect the vendor’s operations 
and security measures in the future. Which clause should you 
ensure is included in the contract? 
(A)       Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) 
(B)       Service level agreement (SLA) 
(C)       Termination clause 
(D)       Right-to-audit clause 
Explanation 250. Correct Answer: D. Right-to-audit clause. 
The right-to-audit clause allows an organization to review or 
audit a vendor’s procedures, systems, records, and practices to 
ensure they comply with agreed-upon security and privacy 
requirements. 
Option A is incorrect. While an NDA is essential to protect 
confidential information, it doesn’t give an organization the 
right to audit a vendor’s practices. 
	
 
1143

Option B is incorrect. An SLA sets expectations around the 
quality and availability of services provided, but it doesn’t 
pertain to the right to audit. 
Option C is incorrect. A termination clause defines the 
conditions under which a partnership can be ended, but it 
doesn’t grant audit rights. 
Question 251. After a major security incident, DeltaTech 
implemented several security patches to address vulnerabilities 
in their infrastructure. To ensure the effectiveness of these 
patches, what should be DeltaTech’s primary next step? 
(A)       Deploy additional firewalls at the network perimeter 
(B)       Provide cybersecurity training to all employees 
(C)       Rescan the systems to check if vulnerabilities are 
effectively addressed 
(D)       Change all user passwords across the organization 
Explanation 251. Correct Answer: C. Rescan the systems to 
check if vulnerabilities are effectively addressed. After 
implementing security patches, it’s essential to rescan the 
systems to ensure that the identified vulnerabilities have been 
effectively addressed and the patches have been implemented 
correctly. 
Option A is incorrect. While firewalls are crucial for security, 
deploying them is not directly related to validating the 
effectiveness of newly implemented patches. 
	
 
1144

Option B is incorrect. Cybersecurity training for employees is 
vital, but it doesn’t directly validate the success of the applied 
patches. 
Option D is incorrect. Changing user passwords can be a 
necessary step after a breach, but it doesn’t validate if the 
patches have successfully addressed vulnerabilities. 
Question 252. A Security Analyst at BetaTech is reviewing the 
monitoring tools deployed across the organization. She wants to 
ensure that every tool can detect unauthorized changes made to 
system files and configurations. Which of the following tools is 
BEST suited for this purpose? 
(A)       Network protocol analyzer 
(B)       File integrity monitoring (FIM) system 
(C)       Bandwidth monitoring tool 
(D)       Passive vulnerability scanner 
Explanation 252. Correct Answer: B. File integrity 
monitoring (FIM) system. File integrity monitoring systems 
are designed to detect and alert when unauthorized changes are 
made to system files and configurations, ensuring the integrity 
of these critical components. 
Option A is incorrect. While network protocol analyzers can 
capture and analyze network traffic, they are not specifically 
designed to monitor changes to system files and configurations. 
Option C is incorrect. Bandwidth monitoring tools primarily 
track network usage and bandwidth consumption, not 
modifications to system files. 
	
 
1145

Option D is incorrect. Passive vulnerability scanners monitor 
network traffic to detect vulnerabilities but do not actively track 
changes to system files. 
Question 253. An e-commerce company wants to ensure that 
their customers’ credit card data remains confidential while in 
transit over the internet. They are seeking a protocol that can 
help in securing their website’s communication. Which protocol 
would best fit this requirement? 
(A)       IPSec 
(B)       SSH 
(C)       TLS 
(D)       ICMP 
Explanation 253. Correct Answer: C. TLS. Transport Layer 
Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol that ensures data 
confidentiality and integrity over the internet. Websites use TLS 
to secure all communications between their servers and web 
browsers, making it suitable for e-commerce platforms to secure 
sensitive customer data. 
Option A is incorrect. IPSec is a suite of protocols that secures 
IP communications by encrypting and authenticating all IP 
packets. It is more commonly used for VPNs rather than 
securing web communications. 
Option B is incorrect. SSH (Secure Shell) is primarily used for 
secure remote access to systems, not for securing web-based 
communications. 
	
 
1146

Option D is incorrect. ICMP (Internet Control Message 
Protocol) is used by network devices to send error messages and 
operational information, not for securing data in transit. 
Question 254. After a recent security breach, Sarah, a 
cybersecurity analyst, is implementing additional measures to 
detect unauthorized activities. She decides to embed specific 
values in the database that serve no real purpose but are 
monitored for any unauthorized access or usage. These values 
are designed to raise alerts if they are ever accessed or used. 
What are these specific values commonly referred to as? 
(A)       Security flags 
(B)       Honeypots 
(C)       Honeytokens 
(D)       Audit trails 
Explanation 254. Correct Answer: C. Restoring systems 
from verified backups. Restoring systems from verified 
backups is a corrective control, as it can restore compromised 
systems to their last known good state. This action corrects the 
adverse effects of the intrusion and ensures that any malicious 
alterations are removed. 
Option A is incorrect. Implementing Intrusion Detection 
Systems (IDS) is a detective control. It monitors and detects 
malicious activities in the network but doesn’t correct the 
adverse impacts of an intrusion. 
Option B is incorrect. Frequently updating firewall rules is a 
preventive measure, aiming to block malicious traffic and 
	
 
1147

prevent potential intrusions. While vital, it doesn’t correct the 
impacts of an already occurred breach. 
Option D is incorrect. Enabling multi-factor authentication is a 
preventive control, aiming to provide additional layers of 
verification. While it enhances security, it doesn’t correct the 
adverse impacts of an intrusion. 
Question 255. Maria receives a text message on her phone from 
an unknown number, stating that she has won a gift card worth 
$500 from a popular online store. The message includes a link 
asking her to click on it to claim her prize. Maria is unsure 
about the authenticity of the message. Which of the following is 
the BEST course of action for Maria? 
(A)       Click the link to check if the website looks genuine 
(B)       Forward the message to her friends to verify if they 
received a similar message 
(C)       Delete the message without clicking on any links 
(D)       Respond to the sender asking for more details about the 
offer 
Explanation 255. Correct Answer: C. Delete the message 
without clicking on any links. Messages from unknown 
sources, especially those that sound too good to be true, often 
signal a potential security threat. It’s safest to delete such 
messages without interacting with any links. 
Smishing is a type of phishing attack wherein attackers use 
SMS to deceive users into divulging personal information, 
visiting a malicious website, or downloading malware onto their 
	
 
1148

smartphones. Users should always be cautious of unsolicited 
messages from unknown numbers. 
Option A is incorrect. Clicking the link, even out of curiosity, 
can lead to a malicious website or download malware onto 
Maria’s device. 
Option B is incorrect. While forwarding the message to friends 
might give her insight into its authenticity, it could also expose 
her friends to potential threats if the message is malicious. 
Option D is incorrect. Responding to the sender could give 
them more information about Maria or confirm that her number 
is active, leading to further targeted attacks. 
Question 256. At AlphaTech, the security team is assessing 
vulnerabilities in a newly deployed cloud infrastructure. While 
analyzing potential risks, they consider factors such as the 
physical location of data centers, local laws and regulations, and 
natural disaster frequencies. What are these considerations 
known as in the context of vulnerability management? 
(A)       Asset valuation factors 
(B)       Risk response variables 
(C)       Threat intelligence variables 
(D)       Environmental variables 
Explanation 256. Correct Answer: D. Environmental 
variables. Environmental variables in vulnerability 
management refer to external factors that can influence or affect 
the security posture of an organization. These can include 
	
 
1149

physical location, local laws and regulations, and the potential 
for natural disasters. 
Option A is incorrect. Asset valuation factors primarily deal 
with determining the value of an asset to the organization and 
don’t typically consider external factors like local laws or 
natural disaster frequencies. 
Option B is incorrect. Risk response variables pertain to the 
organization’s strategies and actions to respond to identified 
risks rather than the external factors influencing risk. 
Option C is incorrect. Threat intelligence variables revolve 
around information regarding potential threats or threat actors. 
They don’t typically encompass physical environment 
considerations like those described in the scenario. 
Question 257. During an e-commerce website audit, a security 
analyst discovers that if a user tries to purchase a product and 
simultaneously cancels the order, the product sometimes gets 
added to the user’s cart without deducting any funds. This 
vulnerability can potentially be exploited to obtain products for 
free. Which vulnerability type is the e-commerce website 
susceptible to? 
(A)       Directory Traversal 
(B)       Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) 
(C)       Race Condition 
(D)       Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
Explanation 257. Correct Answer: C. Race Condition. When 
an application’s unintended behavior is due to the timing of 
	
 
1150

concurrent events or operations, it indicates a race condition. 
Here, the simultaneous purchase and cancellation result in a 
faulty outcome. 
A race condition occurs when an application’s behavior is 
dependent on the order or timing of uncontrollable events. If 
two operations, which aren’t meant to happen simultaneously, 
occur at the same time, it can lead to unpredictable and 
unintended outcomes, like the described scenario where a 
product is added without payment due to the concurrency of 
purchase and cancellation. 
Option A is incorrect. Directory Traversal vulnerabilities allow 
attackers to access files and directories that are stored outside 
the intended folder. This doesn’t align with the described 
scenario. 
Option B is incorrect. Insecure Direct Object References 
(IDOR) vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can access 
resources they’re not authorized for by manipulating input, such 
as URL or form parameters. It’s unrelated to the timing or 
concurrency of actions. 
Option D is incorrect. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request. It’s about 
unauthorized actions rather than issues arising from the timing 
of legitimate ones. 
Question 258. XYZ Corp., a multinational company, recently 
underwent a security audit. The Chief Information Security 
Officer (CISO) needs to report the findings of the audit to the 
	
 
1151

company’s internal stakeholders as well as to a governmental 
regulatory agency. Which of the following represents the correct 
type of compliance reporting for each recipient? 
(A)       Internal report for the regulatory agency and external 
report for internal stakeholders 
(B)       External report for both the regulatory agency and 
internal stakeholders 
(C)       Internal report for internal stakeholders and 
external report for the regulatory agency 
(D)       No report is required for internal stakeholders, only an 
external report for the regulatory agency 
Explanation 258. Correct Answer: C. Internal report for 
internal stakeholders and external report for the regulatory 
agency. Internal compliance reports are typically designed for 
consumption within the organization and may contain details 
that are not shared externally. External compliance reports, on 
the other hand, are designed for entities outside of the 
organization, such as regulators or other third parties, and would 
contain information that is relevant and necessary for those 
entities to review. 
Option A is incorrect. It is not standard to provide an internal 
report for an external entity or an external report for internal 
stakeholders. 
Option B is incorrect. While it’s conceivable to use the same 
report for both internal and external entities, it’s more common 
to tailor reports to the specific audience. An internal report may 
contain more detailed or sensitive information not suitable for 
an external audience. 
	
 
1152

Option D is incorrect. It is crucial for internal stakeholders to 
be aware of the audit findings to make informed decisions and 
plan remediation actions. 
Question 259. During a critical financial quarter, GlobalFin 
Corp experienced unexpected outages during peak business 
hours due to system maintenance, impacting its operations 
significantly. To prevent such occurrences in the future, what 
should GlobalFin Corp implement regarding their maintenance 
activities? 
(A)       Conduct maintenance activities randomly to avoid 
predictability 
(B)       Implement maintenance activities during peak business 
hours 
(C)       Establish designated maintenance windows 
(D)       Reduce the frequency of maintenance activities 
Explanation 259. Correct Answer: C. Establish designated 
maintenance windows. Maintenance windows are specific time 
frames designated for system maintenance, ensuring that 
disruptions due to updates, patches, or other maintenance 
activities don’t occur during critical business hours. By setting 
these windows, usually during off-peak times, businesses can 
minimize operational disruptions. 
Option A is incorrect. Conducting maintenance activities 
randomly can lead to unpredictable outages, which can be 
disruptive to business operations and degrade trust among 
stakeholders. 
	
 
1153

Option B is incorrect. Implementing maintenance activities 
during peak business hours is precisely what led to the 
disruption in the scenario. This approach would likely cause 
more operational problems, especially for businesses with 
critical operations during these hours. 
Option D is incorrect. Reducing the frequency of maintenance 
activities might decrease disruptions, but it could also lead to 
unpatched vulnerabilities, outdated software, or other security 
and operational issues. 
Question 260. Alex, a new intern at an IT company, wanted to 
access the internal company portal. Instead of typing 
“companyportal.com,” he accidentally typed 
“comapnyportal.com” and ended up on a site that looked 
identical but asked him to download a security certificate. This 
scenario best describes which type of attack? 
(A)       Spear Phishing 
(B)       Watering Hole Attack 
(C)       Typosquatting 
(D)       Man-in-the-Middle 
Explanation 260. Correct Answer: C. Typosquatting. The 
attacker relies on typographical errors made by users when 
inputting a URL into a web browser, then potentially tries to 
exploit the user in some manner on the deceptive site. 
Typosquatting, also known as URL hijacking, involves attackers 
registering domains that are misspellings of popular websites. 
The intent is often to deceive users who mistype a URL, leading 
them to malicious websites. 
	
 
1154

Option A is incorrect. Spear Phishing targets specific 
individuals or companies with tailored attempts to steal 
information. The described scenario revolves around the 
exploitation of typographical errors, not a targeted email attack. 
Option B is incorrect. A Watering Hole Attack involves 
compromising a specific website or service that the target 
frequently uses. It doesn’t rely on typographical errors. 
Option D is incorrect. A Man-in-the-Middle attack involves an 
attacker secretly intercepting and potentially altering 
communication between two parties. This is not described in the 
scenario. 
Question 261. DataGuard Corp. operates in the European 
Union and has recently suffered a major data breach affecting 
the personal data of thousands of users. They failed to comply 
with some key provisions of the General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR). Which of the following is the MOST likely 
immediate consequence of their non-compliance? 
(A)       They will be forced to shut down operations until 
compliance is achieved 
(B)       DataGuard's executive team will face immediate 
imprisonment 
(C)       The company will be required to issue a public apology 
(D)       DataGuard Corp. will face substantial fines for their 
non-compliance 
Explanation 261. Correct Answer: D. DataGuard Corp. will 
face substantial fines for their non-compliance. The GDPR 
provisions can levy hefty fines on organizations that do not 
	
 
1155

comply with its requirements, especially in the case of data 
breaches. The fines can be up to 4% of the annual global 
turnover or €20 million, whichever is higher. 
Option A is incorrect. While the GDPR can impose operational 
restrictions, it does not directly mandate shutdowns of 
companies due to non-compliance. 
Option B is incorrect. GDPR does not call for the 
imprisonment of executive teams. However, non-compliance 
can lead to severe fines. 
Option C is incorrect. While issuing a public apology might be 
a good PR move, it is not a direct consequence enforced by 
GDPR. 
Question 262. A pharmaceutical company is working on a new 
drug formula that promises to revolutionize the treatment of a 
particular disease. The R&D team has detailed documentation 
on the components, procedures, and results of the drug trials. 
How should this documentation be classified to ensure that only 
the right people within the company have access? 
(A)       Unclassified 
(B)       Public 
(C)       Confidential 
(D)       Sensitive 
Explanation 262. Correct Answer: C. Confidential. This drug 
formula and its documentation represent valuable intellectual 
property for the pharmaceutical company. To protect against 
	
 
1156

theft, corporate espionage, or accidental disclosure, it should be 
classified as confidential to ensure limited, controlled access. 
Option A is incorrect. Unclassified data doesn’t require any 
special protection or confidentiality and is inappropriate for 
valuable intellectual property. 
Option B is incorrect. Public classification would make the 
information accessible to everyone, which is not suitable for 
proprietary drug formulas. 
Option D is incorrect. While the drug formula is sensitive 
information, the “Confidential” classification offers stricter 
controls and is more suitable for such valuable intellectual 
property. 
Question 263. After a recent software update, a company’s 
intranet portal has been inaccessible to a few employees. The IT 
team suspects it could be due to network filtering rules. What 
should the IT team review to confirm their suspicions? 
(A)       The content filtering policies 
(B)       The malware detection logs 
(C)       The allow list/deny list configurations 
(D)       The network bandwidth utilization graphs 
Explanation 263. Correct Answer: C. The allow list/deny list 
configurations. Network accessibility issues, especially after 
software or configuration changes, can often arise due to 
misconfigured allow lists or deny lists. Reviewing these 
configurations can help determine if specific IP addresses or 
	
 
1157

domains have been incorrectly blocked or not allowed, causing 
the inaccessibility issues. 
Option A is incorrect. Content filtering policies primarily focus 
on blocking specific types of content (like social media or adult 
sites) rather than causing inaccessibility to specific users or 
departments. 
Option B is incorrect. Malware detection logs track potential 
security threats and not network access configurations. They 
wouldn’t typically cause a selective inaccessibility issue unless 
a specific user’s machine is quarantined. 
Option D is incorrect. While network bandwidth utilization 
graphs might show reduced traffic, they won’t provide details 
on specific allow/deny list configurations that might be causing 
the inaccessibility. 
Question 264. MegaCorp recently introduced a new web 
application for its customers. Before its release, the software 
underwent rigorous testing in a controlled environment. When 
the application was deployed in production, several security 
vulnerabilities were reported. Which of the following reasons 
can explain the mismatch between the test results and actual 
vulnerabilities? 
(A)       The testing environment was an exact replica of the 
production environment 
(B)       Test results were not thoroughly reviewed 
(C)       The software was not tested for zero-day vulnerabilities 
(D)       Penetration testing was done post-production 
	
 
1158

Explanation 264. Correct Answer: B. Test results were not 
thoroughly reviewed. Even if an application is tested 
rigorously, it is crucial to thoroughly review and interpret the 
test results to identify any potential security vulnerabilities. 
Failing to review or misinterpreting these results can lead to 
vulnerabilities going unnoticed and unresolved. 
Option A is incorrect. Having a testing environment that 
mirrors the production environment is a best practice. This 
ensures that the tests are representative of how the software will 
behave in production. 
Option C is incorrect. While zero-day vulnerabilities are a 
concern, by definition, they are unknown vulnerabilities. 
Testing specifically for them would be challenging. However, 
thorough testing and review processes can mitigate potential 
risks. 
Option D is incorrect. Penetration testing is an essential aspect 
of security testing, but doing it post-production doesn’t explain 
the mismatch between the test results and actual vulnerabilities 
if the initial test results were not reviewed correctly. 
Question 265. NexTech, a cloud-based software company, 
recently faced a security breach due to inconsistent practices 
among its system administrators. To avoid such inconsistencies 
in the future, what should NexTech emphasize in its operations? 
(A)       Rely on system administrators to develop their personal 
methods 
(B)       Mandate frequent system reboots 
(C)       Implement Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) 
	
 
1159

for all technical operations 
(D)       Conduct random security audits without notifying 
administrators 
Explanation 265. Correct Answer: C. Implement Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) for all technical operations. 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) provide a consistent and 
documented process that employees can follow. By 
implementing SOPs, businesses ensure that tasks are performed 
uniformly, reducing the risk of errors and inconsistencies that 
might lead to security vulnerabilities. 
Option A is incorrect. Relying on individual system 
administrators to develop their personal methods can lead to 
inconsistent practices and operational inefficiencies, increasing 
the risk of security breaches. 
Option B is incorrect. Frequent system reboots, while they 
might be part of some SOPs, don’t address the root issue of 
inconsistency among system administrators. It’s the consistent 
method of operations that prevents errors, not just frequent 
restarts. 
Option D is incorrect. While security audits are essential, 
conducting them without notice doesn’t address the core issue 
of inconsistency in system administration practices. 
Question 266. After running a vulnerability scan on the 
company’s infrastructure, a security analyst notices a reported 
vulnerability on a server. However, after manual verification, 
the analyst determines that the vulnerability doesn’t actually 
	
 
1160

exist on the server. What is this situation best described as? 
(A)       A false negative 
(B)       A true positive 
(C)       A false positive 
(D)       A confirmation bias 
Explanation 266. Correct Answer: C. A false positive. A false 
positive in vulnerability management occurs when a system 
incorrectly flags a threat or vulnerability that isn’t truly present. 
This can lead to wasted resources on investigating and 
attempting to remediate a non-existent issue. 
Option A is incorrect. A false negative would mean that the 
vulnerability exists, but the system failed to detect it, which is 
the opposite of the scenario described. 
Option B is incorrect. A true positive means that the 
vulnerability was correctly identified and truly exists, which 
isn’t the case here. 
Option D is incorrect. Confirmation bias is a cognitive bias 
where one favors information that confirms their existing 
beliefs. It’s not relevant to the scenario of incorrectly detected 
vulnerabilities. 
Question 267. Your organization has been repeatedly ignoring 
the security guidelines set forth by a global standards 
organization, despite having pledged adherence. Given the 
repetitive nature of these violations, the organization is now 
facing disciplinary measures. Which of the following is the 
MOST likely immediate consequence of these actions? 
	
 
1161

(A)       Immediate revocation of business licenses 
(B)       Sanctions imposed by the global standards 
organization 
(C)       Forcible shutdown of all online operations for a 
determined period 
(D)      Mandatory public apology to stakeholders 
Explanation 267. Correct Answer: B. Sanctions imposed by 
the global standards organization. Sanctions are penalties or 
other means of enforcement used to provide incentives for 
obedience with the law, or with rules and regulations. In this 
scenario, the global standards organization can impose sanctions 
for the failure to adhere to their guidelines. 
Option A is incorrect. Revocation of business licenses is 
typically a drastic measure and might be taken by a local or 
national regulatory body, not a standards organization. 
Option C is incorrect. While some sanctions might involve 
restrictions, forcibly shutting down all online operations would 
be an extreme and less likely measure for non-compliance with 
guidelines from a standards organization. 
Option D is incorrect. A public apology, while potentially 
useful for public relations, is not a direct consequence or 
sanction imposed by most standards organizations. 
Question 268. Sophia, the cybersecurity lead at XYZ Corp, is 
in the process of drafting a new security policy. During the 
drafting process, she primarily consults with her security team. 
However, upon implementation, several departments pushed 
	
 
1162

back due to the policy interfering with their operations. Which 
best describes the misstep Sophia made during the policy 
creation process? 
(A)       Not using a standardized security framework 
(B)       Over-reliance on automated security solutions 
(C)       Not including key stakeholders in the policy drafting 
process 
(D)       Focusing too much on external threats rather than 
internal ones 
Explanation 268. Correct Answer: C. Not including key 
stakeholders in the policy drafting process. Stakeholders 
from different departments provide crucial insights into how 
security measures can impact various operations and processes 
within an organization. By including them in the policy drafting 
process, Sophia would have received feedback that could have 
helped shape a policy that not only maintains security but also 
aligns with the needs of different departments. 
Option A is incorrect. While using a standardized security 
framework can provide guidance, it doesn’t necessarily account 
for the unique operational needs of different departments within 
an organization. 
Option B is incorrect. The scenario doesn’t mention any 
reliance, over or otherwise, on automated security solutions. 
Option D is incorrect. While both external and internal threats 
are crucial considerations, the primary issue here was the lack 
of consultation with key stakeholders. 
	
 
1163

Question 269. A company’s network administrator notices that 
several switches in the network infrastructure are no longer 
receiving firmware updates from the manufacturer. These 
devices are no longer sold or supported. What vulnerability do 
these switches introduce to the network? 
(A)       Physical hardware tampering 
(B)       Lack of redundancy 
(C)       Increased susceptibility to new threats 
(D)       Wireless interference 
Explanation 269. Correct Answer: C. Increased 
susceptibility to new threats. End-of-life hardware often does 
not receive security updates or patches, making them more 
vulnerable to new and evolving threats over time.  
End-of-life (EOL) hardware refers to devices that are no longer 
supported by their manufacturers. This lack of support means 
that the devices won’t receive any further security updates, 
patches, or technical support. Consequently, these devices 
become more susceptible to new threats and vulnerabilities, 
posing a security risk to the network. 
Option A is incorrect. End-of-life status doesn’t inherently 
make a device more vulnerable to physical tampering. However, 
without ongoing updates, they might be susceptible to firmware 
or software-based attacks, which could lead to physical 
tampering in some scenarios. 
Option B is incorrect. Lack of redundancy refers to a single 
point of failure in a system or network. It is not directly related 
to the vulnerabilities associated with EOL hardware. 
	
 
1164

Option D is incorrect. Wireless interference is related to the 
disruption of wireless signals and is not a direct consequence of 
EOL hardware. 
Question 270. Liam, the CTO of a medium-sized enterprise, 
noticed that several software applications were not updated 
regularly, leading to potential security vulnerabilities. Upon 
investigation, he realized that no specific team or individual was 
assigned as the owner of these applications. To enhance 
security, what should Liam emphasize? 
(A)       Immediate decommissioning of all unowned 
applications 
(B)       Assignment of clear ownership to all business 
applications 
(C)       Conducting monthly vulnerability assessments on all 
applications 
(D)       Outsourcing the management of these applications to 
third-party vendors 
Explanation 270. Correct Answer: B. Assignment of clear 
ownership to all business applications. Assigning clear 
ownership ensures that there’s a designated team or individual 
responsible for the upkeep, updates, and security of an 
application. When there’s clear ownership, the owner has the 
accountability to maintain and secure the application, reducing 
the risk of oversights like missing updates. 
Option A is incorrect. Immediate decommissioning may not be 
practical or feasible, especially if the applications are critical to 
business operations. 
	
 
1165

Option C is incorrect. While monthly vulnerability 
assessments can help identify security issues, they don’t address 
the root cause of the problem highlighted in the scenario – the 
lack of ownership and accountability. 
Option D is incorrect. Outsourcing may shift the responsibility, 
but it doesn’t ensure that the applications will be better managed 
or more secure. Ownership clarity is paramount, whether the 
management is internal or outsourced. 
Question 271. Sophia received an email from her bank asking 
her to urgently update her personal details due to a system 
upgrade. The email contains a link that redirects to a website 
that looks similar to her bank’s website. Which of the following 
should she do FIRST? 
(A)       Follow the link and promptly update her personal details 
to avoid any inconvenience 
(B)       Forward the email to her friends and family to ensure 
they are also aware of the bank's system upgrade 
(C)       Delete the email immediately without taking any action 
(D)       Contact her bank through official channels to verify 
the authenticity of the email 
Explanation 271. Correct Answer: D. Contact her bank 
through official channels to verify the authenticity of the 
email. Before taking action based on an unsolicited email, 
especially one that asks for personal information or credentials, 
it’s essential to verify its legitimacy directly with the institution 
or entity it claims to represent. 
	
 
1166

Phishing attacks often use fear, urgency, or perceived authority 
to lure victims into providing sensitive data. The best defense 
against such attempts is to independently verify any unexpected 
or suspicious requests before taking action. 
Option A is incorrect. Directly responding to a potential 
phishing email by providing personal details is a common 
mistake, making the user vulnerable to fraud and identity theft. 
Option B is incorrect. Forwarding a potentially malicious 
email to others can further propagate the threat and possibly 
compromise their security as well. 
Option C is incorrect. While deleting the email might prevent 
Sophia from falling for the phishing attempt, it’s still a good 
practice to inform the bank about the suspicious email so they 
can take appropriate measures and warn other customers. 
Question 272. AlphaTech, a growing SaaS company, has 
multiple applications deployed across different cloud providers. 
The security team struggles to manage and analyze logs from 
these disparate sources. Which solution would BEST help 
AlphaTech centralize their logs for a more streamlined analysis? 
(A)       Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) 
(B)       Log Aggregation Tool 
(C)       Data Loss Prevention (DLP) software 
(D)       Vulnerability Scanner 
Explanation 272. Correct Answer: B. Log Aggregation Tool. 
Log aggregation tools are specifically designed to gather, 
	
 
1167

centralize, and manage logs from various sources, making it 
easier to analyze and correlate events. 
Option A is incorrect. While a NIDS can help detect malicious 
activity on a network, it doesn’t centralize logs from different 
application sources. 
Option C is incorrect. DLP software focuses on preventing 
unauthorized data transfers and does not serve the purpose of 
centralizing logs. 
Option D is incorrect. Vulnerability Scanners are designed to 
identify vulnerabilities in a system but don’t aggregate logs 
from various sources. 
Question 273. AlphaTech is seeking a comprehensive source of 
intelligence about the latest cyber threats targeting its specific 
industry. While OSINT provides valuable data, the company is 
considering investing in a more specialized solution. Which of 
the following would best address AlphaTech’s needs? 
(A)       Implementing internal honeypots to trap attackers 
(B)       Subscribing to a third-party threat intelligence feed 
(C)       Regularly attending cyber security conferences 
(D)       Using open-source vulnerability scanners 
Explanation 273. Correct Answer: B. Subscribing to a third-
party threat intelligence feed. A third-party threat intelligence 
feed, especially one tailored for a specific industry, provides 
specialized, often real-time information about cyber threats, 
offering insights beyond what’s available in the public domain. 
	
 
1168

Option A is incorrect. While honeypots can help understand 
the tactics of attackers targeting the organization, they don’t 
provide comprehensive intelligence about industry-wide threats. 
Option C is incorrect. Attending cyber security conferences 
can offer insights and updates, but it’s not a continuous or real-
time source of threat intelligence. 
Option D is incorrect. Open-source vulnerability scanners help 
identify vulnerabilities within an organization’s infrastructure 
but don’t offer specialized intelligence about industry-specific 
cyber threats. 
Question 274. An employee receives a call from someone 
claiming to be from the IT department. The caller says there’s 
an urgent update required on the employee’s computer and asks 
for login credentials to perform the update remotely. The 
employee becomes suspicious because of which red flag 
regarding impersonation? 
(A)       The caller did not use technical jargon 
(B)       IT normally sends email notifications about updates 
(C)       The employee was not expecting any updates 
(D)       The caller's voice sounded unfamiliar 
Explanation 274. Correct Answer: B. IT normally sends 
email notifications about updates. If the organization’s 
standard procedure is to send email notifications about updates, 
an unsolicited call asking for credentials would be a clear red 
flag. 
	
 
1169

Impersonation is a common tactic used in social engineering 
attacks where the attacker pretends to be someone the victim 
trusts. Recognizing deviations from standard procedures can 
help identify impersonation attempts. 
Option A is incorrect. The use or lack of technical jargon isn’t 
a reliable indicator of impersonation. Some genuine IT 
personnel might avoid jargon to make things clearer for non-
tech-savvy employees. 
Option C is incorrect. While unexpected updates can be 
suspicious, they aren’t necessarily indicative of impersonation 
on their own. Legitimate unexpected updates can occur. 
Option D is incorrect. An unfamiliar voice isn’t a reliable 
indicator since large organizations might have many IT 
personnel that an employee hasn’t interacted with. 
Question 275. As a security consultant, you are hired by a 
multinational corporation to assess the security posture of their 
potential vendors. One of the vendors appears promising, but 
your client wants to ensure that the vendor periodically 
examines and strengthens its own internal procedures and 
security controls. What should you advise your client to request 
from this vendor? 
 (A)       The vendor's business continuity plan 
 (B)       A list of the vendor's clients 
(C)       Evidence of internal audits 
(D)       The vendor's company mission statement 
	
 
1170

Explanation 275. Correct Answer: C. Evidence of internal 
audits. Requesting evidence of internal audits would allow the 
client to review the vendor’s commitment to maintaining and 
improving its internal procedures and security controls. 
Option A is incorrect. While a business continuity plan is 
essential, it primarily outlines how disruptions will be managed 
and does not necessarily provide evidence of the vendor’s 
internal control practices. 
Option B is incorrect. Knowing the vendor’s clients can 
provide some context, but it does not directly provide evidence 
of the vendor’s internal control practices or security measures. 
Option D is incorrect. The company’s mission statement 
provides an overview of the company’s goals and values but 
doesn’t provide specific evidence of its internal control 
practices. 
Question 276. TechDynamics, a growing tech startup, plans to 
scale its operations and serve a global clientele. Given that their 
client base operates in multiple time zones, when should 
TechDynamics schedule their system maintenance to ensure 
minimal disruption? 
(A)       During the busiest hours for their headquarters' local 
time 
(B)       Staggered based on the peak hours of their global clients 
(C)       Only when a system breakdown occurs 
(D)       Establish a consistent maintenance window during 
off-peak hours for the majority of their clientele 
	
 
1171

Explanation 276. Correct Answer: D. Establish a consistent 
maintenance window during off-peak hours for the majority 
of their clientele. When serving a global clientele operating in 
various time zones, it’s crucial to establish a maintenance 
window during hours when the majority of clients are least 
active. This minimizes disruptions and ensures smooth 
operations for most clients. 
Option A is incorrect. Focusing only on the headquarters’ local 
time disregards the operational hours of global clients. This 
approach might cause disruptions for clients in other time 
zones. 
Option B is incorrect. While staggering maintenance based on 
peak hours of global clients seems logical, it could lead to a 
complex and hard-to-manage maintenance schedule, especially 
as the client base grows. 
Option C is incorrect. Waiting for a system breakdown to 
perform maintenance is reactive rather than proactive. This 
approach might lead to more extended and unpredictable 
downtimes, resulting in greater disruptions and potential 
security risks.  
Question 277. A defense contractor is working on a new missile 
system. While the detailed schematics and operational details 
are classified, they have an overview document that only a 
select group of partners and stakeholders can view. How should 
this overview document be classified? 
(A)       Public 
(B)       Restricted 
	
 
1172

(C)       Confidential 
(D)       Top Secret 
Explanation 277. Correct Answer: B. Restricted. 
“Restricted” classification is used when access to the document 
or data needs to be limited to a particular group of individuals. 
In this scenario, only a select group of partners and stakeholders 
are allowed to view the overview document, making 
“Restricted” the most appropriate classification. 
Option A is incorrect. “Public” classification would allow 
anyone to access the document, which is not suitable for this 
scenario. 
Option C is incorrect. While “Confidential” classification 
would provide a level of protection, it doesn’t specifically 
restrict access to a defined group as “Restricted” does. 
Option D is incorrect. “Top Secret” is a high-level 
classification that would be more appropriate for the detailed 
schematics and operational details rather than an overview 
document. 
Question 278. TechFusion and CodeRush, two independent 
software development companies, are collaborating on a project 
that is expected to define industry standards for a new coding 
language. While both parties have an understanding of shared 
responsibilities, they have not yet established legally binding 
obligations. Which type of agreement best suits their current 
collaborative understanding? 
(A)       Service-level agreement (SLA) 
	
 
1173

(B)       Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) 
(C)       Memorandum of agreement (MOA) 
(D)       Licensing agreement 
Explanation 278. Correct Answer: C. Memorandum of 
agreement (MOA). A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) 
outlines mutual understandings and responsibilities between 
two or more parties and does not necessarily contain legally 
binding obligations. In this scenario, TechFusion and CodeRush 
have a shared understanding but have not reached legally 
binding terms, making an MOA the most appropriate choice. 
Option A is incorrect. An SLA specifies performance metrics 
and expectations between a service provider and a customer. It 
doesn’t necessarily suit a collaborative project aiming to define 
industry standards. 
Option B is incorrect. An NDA pertains to the confidentiality 
of information and would not define mutual understandings or 
responsibilities related to project collaboration. 
Option D is incorrect. A licensing agreement typically deals 
with the rights to use, distribute, or reproduce software or 
intellectual property. 
Question 279. A security analyst at CyberSecure Corp. reviews 
a vulnerability report concerning an application that could allow 
attackers to upload malicious scripts. Once these scripts are 
executed, they can grant attackers complete control over the 
application. How should this vulnerability be primarily 
classified?

(A)       Integrity vulnerability 
(B)       Availability vulnerability 
(C)       Remote code execution vulnerability 
(D)       Disclosure vulnerability 
Explanation 279. Correct Answer: C. Remote code 
execution vulnerability. Remote code execution (RCE) 
vulnerabilities allow attackers to run arbitrary commands or 
scripts on a targeted system. In the scenario, the application 
vulnerability grants attackers the ability to upload and execute 
malicious scripts, which aligns with this classification. 
Option A is incorrect. While the vulnerability can affect the 
integrity of the application, the primary concern here is the 
ability of attackers to execute code remotely, making it an RCE 
vulnerability. 
Option B is incorrect. Availability vulnerabilities primarily 
concern the disruption of services or systems, preventing 
authorized users from accessing them. The scenario doesn’t 
indicate any disruption of availability. 
Option D is incorrect. Disclosure vulnerabilities involve 
unauthorized viewing or accessing of information. The 
described vulnerability goes beyond mere disclosure, allowing 
execution of malicious scripts. 
Question 280. A financial institution is updating its 
infrastructure to ensure that customer financial data is kept 
secure from both internal and external threats. Which of the 
following would be the MOST effective measure to protect 
	
 
1175

customer financial data from being accessed by unauthorized 
internal users? 
(A)       Deploying perimeter firewalls around the institution's 
network 
(B)       Implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) for all 
customer accounts 
(C)       Enforcing strict access controls based on the 
principle of least privilege 
(D)       Conducting yearly cybersecurity awareness training for 
all employees 
Explanation 280. Correct Answer: C. Enforcing strict access 
controls based on the principle of least privilege. The 
principle of least privilege (PoLP) ensures that users are given 
only the permissions they need to perform their job functions, 
nothing more. By enforcing strict access controls using this 
principle, the financial institution can minimize the risk of 
unauthorized internal users accessing sensitive financial data. 
Option A is incorrect. Perimeter firewalls are more focused on 
preventing external threats and don’t specifically address 
unauthorized internal access. 
Option B is incorrect. Implementing 2FA is primarily for 
authenticating users and doesn’t prevent unauthorized internal 
users from accessing data if they are already authenticated. 
Option D is incorrect. While cybersecurity awareness training 
is crucial, it’s not the most effective specific measure to prevent 
unauthorized internal access to financial data.

Question 281. Alice, a system administrator for a startup, is 
preparing to deploy a new website for her company. To ensure 
secure communications between the users and the website, she 
plans to obtain a digital certificate for the site. Before doing so, 
which step must Alice first undertake to get a certificate from a 
Certificate Authority (CA)? 
(A)       Generate a public-private key pair 
(B)       Submit her passport copy to the CA 
(C)       Download the latest CA root certificate 
(D)       Encrypt the website with symmetric encryption 
Explanation 281. Correct Answer: A. Generate a public-
private key pair. Before Alice can request a digital certificate 
from a CA, she must first generate a public-private key pair. 
Once this is done, she creates a Certificate Signing Request 
(CSR) containing her public key and some additional 
information. The CSR is then submitted to the CA for signing. 
Option B is incorrect. CAs do not typically require a passport 
copy for standard SSL/TLS certificates. They might have 
identity verification processes, but it’s usually for extended 
validation certificates. 
Option C is incorrect. While it may be necessary to trust a CA 
by downloading its root certificate, this is not the step required 
before requesting a digital certificate. 
Option D is incorrect. Symmetric encryption is unrelated to the 
process of obtaining a digital certificate.

Question 282. TechFin Bank is considering implementing a 
new software system for their transaction processing. Before 
rolling it out, the cybersecurity team insists on carrying out a 
specific type of analysis to understand how this change might 
affect the organization’s security posture. What is the team 
referring to? 
(A)       Risk appetite assessment 
(B)       Performance benchmarking 
(C)       Impact analysis 
(D)       Penetration testing 
Explanation 282. Correct Answer: C. Impact analysis. An 
impact analysis assesses the potential consequences of a change 
within an organization. In the context of TechFin Bank, the 
cybersecurity team would use this analysis to understand how 
the new software system might introduce new vulnerabilities, 
affect existing security measures, or otherwise impact the 
bank’s overall security. 
Option A is incorrect. Risk appetite assessment refers to 
determining the amount and type of risk an organization is 
willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives. It doesn’t focus on 
the consequences of a specific change. 
Option B is incorrect. Performance benchmarking focuses on 
comparing an organization’s performance metrics to industry 
standards or best practices, not assessing the potential security 
impact of a change. 
Option D is incorrect. While penetration testing is crucial to 
assess the vulnerabilities in a system, it doesn’t provide a 
	
 
1178

holistic view of the potential impacts a change might have on an 
organization’s security posture. 
Question 283. The software development team at ABC Corp. 
has created a unique application that utilizes innovative 
algorithms. The company wants to ensure that competitors 
cannot legally copy or replicate their application’s functionality. 
Which of the following would be the MOST suitable method to 
protect this intellectual property? 
(A)       Copyright the user interface design 
(B)       Apply for a patent for the innovative algorithms 
(C)       Store the application code in an encrypted vault 
(D)       Ensure all users sign an acceptable use policy (AUP) 
Explanation 283. Correct Answer: B. Apply for a patent for 
the innovative algorithms. Patents provide legal protection for 
inventions, allowing the inventor or patent holder the exclusive 
right to the patented process, design, or invention for a certain 
period. In this case, patenting the algorithms would prevent 
competitors from legally replicating the application’s unique 
functionality. 
Option A is incorrect. Copyrighting the user interface design 
would only protect the visual appearance and elements of the 
application, not its unique functionality or underlying 
algorithms. 
Option C is incorrect. While storing the application code in an 
encrypted vault protects it from unauthorized access, it does not 
provide legal protection against replication by competitors if 
they develop similar functionality independently. 
	
 
1179

Option D is incorrect. An acceptable use policy (AUP) defines 
how users are allowed to use the software or system, but it 
doesn’t offer protection against competitors copying the 
application’s unique functionality. 
Question 284. SecureBank is in the process of selecting a 
vendor for their new online transaction system. The bank is 
keen on ensuring the selected vendor has robust security 
measures and a track record of maintaining those measures. As 
part of the vendor selection process, which of the following 
steps is the most relevant to the bank’s concerns? 
(A)       Checking the vendor's sales growth over the last five 
years 
(B)       Conducting due diligence regarding the vendor's 
security practices 
(C)       Comparing the visual appeal of the vendor's user 
interface to competitors 
(D)       Evaluating the vendor's marketing strategies 
Explanation 284. Correct Answer: B. Conducting due 
diligence regarding the vendor’s security practices. 
Conducting due diligence regarding the vendor’s security 
practices ensures that the bank has a comprehensive 
understanding of the vendor’s security posture and past 
performance, aligning with the bank’s concerns for a robust and 
secure online transaction system. 
Option A is incorrect. While a vendor’s sales growth might 
indicate business success, it does not provide insight into their 
security measures. 
	
 
1180

Option C is incorrect. The visual appeal of a user interface 
does not provide information on the security measures or 
practices of a vendor. 
Option D is incorrect. Evaluating marketing strategies 
provides no direct insight into the security practices of a vendor. 
Question 285. XYZ Corp, a manufacturer of smart home 
devices, failed to implement standard security practices in their 
products. A popular tech review site publishes an in-depth 
review detailing these vulnerabilities. Which of the following 
outcomes is XYZ Corp MOST likely to face as an immediate 
result? 
(A)       An award for innovation in smart home technologies 
(B)       Reputational damage leading to decreased sales 
(C)       An increased partnership with tech retailers 
(D)       A surge in the employee recruitment rate  
Explanation 285. Correct Answer: B. Reputational damage 
leading to decreased sales. Negative reviews, especially those 
highlighting security vulnerabilities, can lead to a loss of trust 
among consumers, potentially resulting in decreased sales due 
to reputational damage. 
Option A is incorrect. Receiving an award for innovation is 
unlikely in the face of publicized security vulnerabilities. 
Option C is incorrect. Partnerships with tech retailers might be 
jeopardized, or at least put on hold, given the negative publicity 
around the product’s security flaws. 
	
 
1181

Option D is incorrect. A negative review, especially one that 
underscores security vulnerabilities, is unlikely to boost 
recruitment. Potential employees may be wary of joining a 
company with a tarnished reputation. 
Question 286. An e-commerce company is experiencing attacks 
that specifically target the shopping cart feature of its web 
application. They want to implement a firewall that can 
understand web application-specific commands and provide 
protection. Which type of firewall should they consider? 
(A)       Layer 4 Firewall 
(B)       Layer 2 Firewall 
(C)       Layer 7 Firewall 
(D)       Packet Filtering Firewall 
Explanation 286. Correct Answer: C. Layer 7 Firewall. 
Layer 7 firewalls, often known as Application Layer firewalls, 
can understand and filter traffic based on application-specific 
data, commands, or functions. They operate at the highest layer 
in the OSI model and can make decisions based on the actual 
content of the traffic. 
Option A is incorrect. Layer 4 firewalls, also known as 
transport layer firewalls, primarily deal with data based on port 
numbers and protocol. They wouldn’t be as effective in filtering 
application-specific commands as a Layer 7 firewall. 
Option B is incorrect. Layer 2 firewalls operate at the data link 
layer, primarily dealing with MAC addresses. They aren’t 
equipped to analyze application-specific content. 
	
 
1182

Option D is incorrect. Packet Filtering Firewalls operate 
primarily at the network layer, making decisions based on 
source/destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocol 
types, not application-specific content. 
Question 287. John, a senior executive at XYZ Corp., gets a 
call from someone claiming to be from the bank’s fraud 
department. The caller asks John to confirm certain transactions 
by providing the OTP sent to his registered mobile number. 
What form of social engineering attack is John likely facing? 
(A)       Baiting 
(B)       Quizzing 
(C)       Vishing 
(D)       Pharming 
Explanation 287. Correct Answer: C. Vishing. Vishing, short 
for voice phishing, is the act of using the telephone to scam the 
user into surrendering private information that will be used for 
identity theft. 
Vishing attacks capitalize on trust, using voice calls to 
manipulate victims into divulging sensitive information. 
Attackers often pose as legitimate entities or departments, like a 
bank’s fraud department, to make their scam appear genuine. 
Option A is incorrect. Baiting involves luring a victim into 
downloading malicious software under the guise of a free or 
beneficial download. 
Option B is incorrect. Quizzing isn’t a recognized type of 
social engineering attack. 
	
 
1183

Option D is incorrect. Pharming involves redirecting a 
website’s traffic to a bogus site, often to capture login 
credentials. 
Question 288. DeltaCorp, a retail company, has assessed that a 
security breach might result in a loss of $1 million in sales. The 
company has determined that they can tolerate a loss of up to 
$500,000, but anything beyond that would severely impact 
operations. To cover the potential financial loss beyond their 
tolerance level, they decide to purchase cybersecurity insurance. 
Which of the following terms best describes the $500,000 
figure? 
(A)       Risk appetite 
(B)       Risk threshold 
(C)       Risk capacity 
(D)       Risk assessment 
Explanation 288. Correct Answer: B. Risk threshold. The 
risk threshold is the specific level of risk an organization is 
willing to accept. In this case, DeltaCorp is willing to accept 
potential losses up to $500,000, marking that as their threshold. 
Option A is incorrect. Risk appetite is a broader term that 
reflects the general level of risk an organization is willing to 
accept in pursuit of its objectives. It’s more about strategic 
intent than specific figures. 
Option C is incorrect. Risk capacity refers to the total amount 
of risk an organization can absorb without significantly 
impacting its strategic objectives or viability. It’s a broader 
measure than the specific tolerance threshold. 
	
 
1184

Option D is incorrect. Risk assessment is the process of 
identifying, analyzing, and evaluating risks. It’s not a specific 
figure or threshold. 
Question 289. A financial organization collects and stores 
personally identifiable information (PII) of its customers. The 
company operates within jurisdictions that have strict 
regulations concerning the storage, transmission, and processing 
of such data. Which of the following strategies would be MOST 
appropriate for the company to ensure compliance with these 
regulations? 
(A)       Use open source encryption algorithms without 
validation 
(B)       Only store customer data in physical, on-site servers 
(C)       Implement data classification and labeling 
procedures 
(D)       Limit the number of administrators with access to the 
data 
Explanation 289. Correct Answer: C. Implement data 
classification and labeling procedures. By implementing data 
classification and labeling procedures, the organization can 
clearly identify which data is regulated, ensuring appropriate 
controls, access rights, and protective measures are in place. 
This aids in achieving compliance by setting clear guidelines on 
data handling based on the classification. 
Option A is incorrect. While encryption is essential for 
protecting sensitive data, using open source algorithms without 
validation might not ensure that the data is protected to the 
standards required by regulations. 
	
 
1185

Option B is incorrect. Storing customer data only on physical, 
on-site servers doesn’t necessarily guarantee compliance. 
Regulations often require specific controls regardless of where 
the data is stored. 
Option D is incorrect. While limiting administrative access can 
reduce the risk of insider threats, it doesn’t directly ensure that 
the regulated data is handled in compliance with legal 
requirements. 
Question 290. An organization is transitioning its IT 
infrastructure to be cloud-centric and aims to adopt a zero-trust 
network approach. They are looking for a solution that 
integrates cloud security, zero-trust access, and WAN 
capabilities, ensuring employees have consistent secure access 
regardless of their location. Which of the following best 
addresses their needs? 
(A)       Remote Desktop Services (RDS) 
(B)       Secure access service edge (SASE) 
(C)       Content Delivery Network (CDN) 
(D)      Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) 
Explanation 290. Correct Answer: B. Secure access service 
edge (SASE). SASE integrates multiple network and security 
functions traditionally delivered in separate point solutions. This 
includes capabilities such as Secure Web Gateway (SWG), 
Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), Firewall-as-a-Service 
(FWaaS), and Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), all delivered 
from a globally distributed set of cloud-native platforms. 
	
 
1186

Option A is incorrect. Remote Desktop Services (RDS) 
enables users to connect to a graphical interface of a remote 
computer, but it doesn’t inherently combine cloud security, 
zero-trust access, and WAN capabilities like SASE. 
Option C is incorrect. A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is 
designed to deliver web content and web applications to users 
based on their geographical location. It doesn’t provide 
integrated cloud security and WAN capabilities. 
Option D is incorrect. A Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) 
segments a physical network into multiple isolated networks. It 
doesn’t offer the combined benefits of cloud security, zero-trust 
access, and WAN capabilities like SASE. 
Question 291. MedTech, a medical device manufacturer, did 
not adhere to the required standards for device security and 
patient data protection. Which of the following repercussions 
might be the MOST critical for MedTech’s ongoing operations? 
(A)       Increased public relations campaigns 
(B)       Short-term stock price fluctuations 
(C)       Offering discounts on their devices 
(D)       Loss of license to manufacture and distribute 
Explanation 291. Correct Answer: D. Loss of license to 
manufacture and distribute. For a medical device 
manufacturer, maintaining adherence to industry-specific 
standards is crucial. Non-compliance, especially when it 
involves patient data protection, can lead to the company losing 
its license to operate. 
	
 
1187

Option A is incorrect. While public relations campaigns might 
be employed to manage reputation, it’s not a direct consequence 
of non-compliance. 
Option B is incorrect. Stock price fluctuations could occur due 
to many factors, but it’s not the most critical consequence 
concerning the company’s ability to operate. 
Option C is incorrect. Offering discounts might be a strategy 
to regain customer trust, but it’s not a direct result of non-
compliance nor is it as critical as the potential loss of a license. 
Question 292. A multinational corporation is looking to replace 
its current firewalls at all its global branches. The IT director 
wants a solution that can perform stateful inspection of packets, 
application-level filtering, and integrate threat intelligence feeds 
for updated threat awareness. Which of the following would be 
the most suitable solution? 
 (A)       Stateful Packet Inspection Firewall 
(B)       Proxy Server 
(C)       Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
(D)       Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) 
Explanation 292. Correct Answer: D. Next-Generation 
Firewall (NGFW). Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs) are 
designed to offer traditional firewall capabilities such as stateful 
inspection but also come with advanced features like 
application-level filtering and the ability to integrate with threat 
intelligence feeds. This makes NGFWs suitable for modern, 
complex environments that demand multi-layered security 
features. 
	
 
1188

Option A is incorrect. While a Stateful Packet Inspection 
Firewall can monitor the state of active connections and analyze 
the packets, it doesn’t offer advanced features like application-
level filtering or the integration of threat intelligence feeds that 
a NGFW does. 
Option B is incorrect. A Proxy Server controls and filters 
requests from clients to servers, typically for web access. It 
doesn’t possess the comprehensive security functionalities of a 
NGFW. 
Option C is incorrect. A Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
specifically protects web applications from targeted attacks. 
While valuable, it doesn’t offer the breadth of features and 
integrations that a NGFW does. 
Question 293. A security analyst is reviewing a vulnerability 
report and sees a reference to CVE-2023-12345 with a CVSS 
score of 9.5. Which of the following conclusions can the analyst 
draw based on this information? 
(A)       The vulnerability was first identified in the year 2023 
(B)       The vulnerability is of low severity 
(C)       The vulnerability affects only software produced in 
2023 
(D)       CVE-2023-12345 is the software vendor's internal code 
for the vulnerability 
Explanation 293. Correct Answer: A. The vulnerability was 
first identified in the year 2023. The CVE identifier’s format 
begins with the year the vulnerability was made public, so 
CVE-2023-12345 indicates a vulnerability identified in 2023. 
	
 
1189

Option B is incorrect. CVSS scores range from 0 to 10, with 
higher scores indicating higher severity. A score of 9.5 is 
considered critical severity, not low. 
Option C is incorrect. The year in a CVE identifier refers to 
when the vulnerability was published, not the year the software 
was produced. 
Option D is incorrect. The CVE system is a standard method 
for identifying vulnerabilities and doesn’t represent a software 
vendor’s internal coding. 
Question 294. GlobalTech, a software development company, is 
entering into a partnership with WebSolutions, a web hosting 
provider. They aim to create a standard set of terms governing 
their ongoing business transactions, including payment terms, 
delivery protocols, and warranties. Which type of agreement is 
most suitable for establishing these foundational terms for 
future transactions? 
(A)       Memorandum of understanding (MOU) 
(B)       Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) 
(C)       Licensing agreement 
(D)       Master service agreement (MSA) 
Explanation 294. Correct Answer: D. Master service 
agreement (MSA). A Master service agreement (MSA) is 
designed to define a broad framework covering the terms and 
conditions of business transactions between parties. It sets out 
general terms so that specific details can be negotiated in 
subsequent contracts. Given that GlobalTech and WebSolutions 
	
 
1190

intend to outline foundational terms for their ongoing 
transactions, an MSA is the most fitting choice. 
Option A is incorrect. An MOU establishes mutual intentions 
but typically doesn’t detail specific transaction terms. 
Option B is incorrect. An NDA focuses on maintaining 
confidentiality and doesn’t establish transactional terms. 
Option C is incorrect. A licensing agreement concerns the 
rights to use, distribute, or reproduce specific software or 
intellectual property  
Question 295. AlphaTech, a leading IT company, recently 
identified a critical vulnerability in its primary software product. 
They have developed a patch to address the vulnerability. 
Before distributing the patch to its customers, which of the 
following should AlphaTech ideally perform? 
(A)       Deploy the patch on all company systems 
(B)       Notify the media about the vulnerability 
(C)       Test the patch in a controlled environment 
(D)       Offer compensation to affected customers 
Explanation 295. Correct Answer: C. Test the patch in a 
controlled environment. Before deploying or distributing a 
patch, especially for a critical vulnerability, it’s essential to test 
it in a controlled environment. This ensures that the patch 
doesn’t introduce new issues and that it effectively addresses 
the vulnerability. 
	
 
1191

Option A is incorrect. Deploying the patch immediately on all 
company systems without testing it could lead to unforeseen 
issues or even exacerbate the problem. 
Option B is incorrect. Notifying the media about the 
vulnerability, especially before it’s been effectively addressed 
and without a coordinated disclosure plan, can lead to panic and 
potential exploitation by malicious actors. 
Option D is incorrect. Offering compensation is reactive and 
doesn’t directly address the vulnerability. The primary goal after 
identifying a vulnerability should be to address and mitigate it. 
Question 296. Employees at a renowned software development 
firm frequently visit an industry-related forum to discuss the 
latest trends and technologies. Over the past month, several 
employees reported malware infections shortly after accessing 
the forum. An investigation suggests the forum was 
compromised to target the company’s developers specifically. 
Which type of attack most accurately describes this scenario? 
(A)       Spear Phishing 
(B)       Watering Hole 
(C)       Drive-by Download 
(D)       Whaling 
Explanation 296. Correct Answer: B. Watering Hole. The 
attack focused on a particular site that employees at the targeted 
organization are known to visit, intending to compromise those 
specific individuals. 
	
 
1192

A watering hole attack involves compromising a website or 
online resource frequented by members of a particular group or 
organization. Once compromised, attackers can use the site to 
deploy malware to the targeted individuals. 
Option A is incorrect. Spear phishing is a targeted phishing 
attempt, typically via email, aimed at a specific individual or 
organization. It does not involve compromising websites that 
targets frequent. 
Option C is incorrect. While a drive-by download might be the 
method used to deliver malware once the forum was 
compromised, the overall strategy of targeting a specific site 
known to be frequented by the victims defines it as a watering 
hole attack. 
Option D is incorrect. Whaling is a type of phishing attack 
aimed at high-profile targets like CEOs or CFOs. It doesn’t 
involve compromising websites. 
Question 297. A cybersecurity firm has been hired by 
TechGiant Corp. to perform penetration testing on their 
infrastructure. Before the testing begins, the CEO of TechGiant 
Corp. wants to ensure that certain critical systems are not 
targeted, and that the testing will not disrupt their ongoing 
operations. What should be established to define the scope and 
boundaries of the test? 
(A)       Service-level agreement (SLA) 
(B)       Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) 
(C)       Rules of engagement (ROE) 
(D)       Memorandum of understanding (MOU) 
	
 
1193

Explanation 297. Correct Answer: C. Rules of engagement 
(ROE). The Rules of Engagement (ROE) document defines the 
scope, boundaries, methods, and other critical guidelines for a 
penetration test. It ensures that both the testing team and the 
organization understand and agree on what can and cannot be 
done during the testing. 
Option A is incorrect. A Service-level agreement (SLA) 
primarily deals with the levels of service expected, such as 
uptime, response times, etc. It doesn’t define the boundaries of a 
penetration test. 
Option B is incorrect. A Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) is 
about keeping information confidential and wouldn’t define the 
scope of a penetration test. 
Option D is incorrect. A Memorandum of understanding 
(MOU) is a general agreement between parties, but it doesn’t 
detail the specific scope and rules of a penetration test like the 
ROE would. 
Question 298. During a routine vulnerability assessment, 
TechInc discovers a weakness in their system that, if exploited, 
would allow an attacker to modify existing user accounts, 
including privileges. Which classification best describes this 
vulnerability? 
(A)       Elevation of privilege vulnerability 
(B)       Disclosure vulnerability 
(C)       Replay vulnerability 
(D)       Remote code execution vulnerability 
	
 
1194

Explanation 298. Correct Answer: A. Elevation of privilege 
vulnerability. Elevation of privilege vulnerabilities allow 
attackers to increase their privileges within a system, often 
giving them more access than intended. The scenario describes 
a situation where user accounts and their privileges can be 
modified, aligning with this classification. 
Option B is incorrect. Disclosure vulnerabilities involve 
unauthorized access to information but not the modification of 
user privileges or data. 
Option C is incorrect. Replay vulnerabilities occur when 
attackers capture and later retransmit valid data transmissions to 
fool a system, which is not described in the given scenario. 
Option D is incorrect. Remote code execution vulnerabilities 
allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands or code on a 
target system. While these can be severe, the given scenario 
specifically describes privilege changes, not arbitrary code 
execution. 
Question 299. An e-commerce company is rolling out a new 
web application to facilitate online payments. The IT 
department wants to be immediately notified of any application 
errors or unauthorized modifications to the application’s 
codebase. Which of the following tools should they implement? 
(A)       Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
(B)       Application Performance Monitoring (APM) 
(C)       Domain Name System (DNS) monitoring tool 
(D)       Network flow analyzer 
	
 
1195

Explanation 299. Correct Answer: B. Application 
Performance Monitoring (APM). APM tools are designed to 
monitor the performance of applications and can detect 
application errors, anomalies, and unauthorized code changes, 
thereby ensuring application stability and security. 
Option A is incorrect. While a WAF protects web applications 
from various cyber threats by filtering and monitoring HTTP 
traffic, it doesn’t typically monitor for application errors or 
unauthorized code changes. 
Option C is incorrect. DNS monitoring tools focus on ensuring 
the availability and integrity of DNS services and do not 
monitor application performance or codebase changes. 
Option D is incorrect. Network flow analyzers examine data 
flows on the network but do not specifically monitor application 
performance or codebase modifications. 
Question 300. A security analyst is exploring ways to 
proactively identify vulnerabilities within the organization’s 
infrastructure. Which of the following provides the BEST 
method for the analyst to receive real-time threat intelligence 
from the dark web? 
(A)       Utilizing a vulnerability scanner on the organization's 
internal network 
(B)       Subscribing to a dark web threat intelligence feed 
(C)       Conducting regular penetration tests on external-facing 
systems 
(D)       Reviewing daily reports from the organization's SIEM

Explanation 300. Correct Answer: B. Subscribing to a dark 
web threat intelligence feed. Threat intelligence feeds, 
especially those focusing on the dark web, provide real-time 
information about emerging threats and vulnerabilities. This 
proactive approach allows analysts to be aware of potential 
threats even before they may affect the organization. 
Option A is incorrect. While vulnerability scanners are 
effective at identifying known vulnerabilities within a network, 
they don’t provide real-time threat intelligence from external 
sources like the dark web. 
Option C is incorrect. Penetration tests are indeed useful for 
identifying vulnerabilities in systems and applications. 
However, they don’t specifically provide threat intelligence 
from the dark web. 
Option D is incorrect. SIEM systems aggregate and analyze 
log data from various sources to identify and respond to security 
incidents. While they can alert to current threats within the 
environment, they don’t offer real-time dark web threat 
intelligence.

Question 301. A financial institution is implementing a system 
where customers can verify the integrity of their monthly 
statements without having access to the original data. Which of 
the following techniques would be MOST appropriate for this 
task? 
(A)       Encrypting the statements using AES 
(B)       Compressing the statements to reduce file size 
(C)       Hashing the statements and providing the hash value

Hashing can be used to ensure data integrity. Customers can 
hash the statement they receive and compare it with the 
provided hash value to verify that the data hasn’t been altered. 
Option A is incorrect. While AES is a strong encryption 
method, encrypting the statements won’t allow customers to 
verify the integrity of their statements. It ensures confidentiality 
more than integrity.

participants. 
Option A is incorrect. Endpoint Encryption is designed for data 
on specific devices like laptops or mobile phones, not for data 
being transmitted over networks. 
Option C is incorrect. Volume-level Encryption pertains to 
encrypting specific logical drives or volumes, not data in transit. 
Option D is incorrect. Database-level Encryption secures data 
within a database and is not specific to data transmission over 
networks. 
Question 303. A global finance firm has recently faced 
downtime due to unexpected disasters in its main operational 
region. The firm wishes to have a backup site that would allow 
them to continue their operations with minimal downtime and 
no data loss. Which type of backup site would be the most 
appropriate for the firm? 
(A)       Cold site 
(B)       Warm site 
	
 
1236

(C)       Hot site 
(D)       Mobile site 
Explanation 303. Correct Answer: C. Hot site. A hot site is a 
fully operational offsite data center configured and ready to 
continue operations immediately after a disaster. It has all the 
necessary equipment and up-to-date data backups, making it 
ideal for scenarios where minimal downtime and no data loss 
are essential. 
Option A is incorrect. A cold site is a backup facility with 
space and infrastructure but without updated equipment or data. 
It requires time to set up and is not suitable for immediate 
recovery. 
Option B is incorrect. A warm site is a middle ground between 
a cold and hot site. It has some equipment and backups but will 
require more time to get fully operational compared to a hot 
site. 
Option D is incorrect. A mobile site is usually a portable setup, 
often on a truck, that can be deployed to various locations. It 
might not be equipped for large-scale operations like a global 
finance firm would require. 
Question 304. During a routine update, a web server 
application requires a restart. What should the administrator do 
FIRST to ensure client connections aren’t abruptly terminated 
during the restart? 
(A)       Redirect incoming traffic to a backup server 
(B)       Increase the server's memory 
	
 
1237

(C)       Manually terminate all active client sessions 
(D)       Check for available patches for the application 
Explanation 304. Correct Answer: A. Redirect incoming 
traffic to a backup server. Redirecting incoming traffic 
ensures that clients are not abruptly disconnected and instead 
can continue their activities on a backup server while the 
primary server undergoes a restart. 
Option B is incorrect. Increasing server memory might 
improve performance but doesn’t address the immediate issue 
of the service restart. 
Option C is incorrect. Manually terminating client sessions 
would cause abrupt disconnections, which is what the 
administrator is trying to avoid. 
Option D is incorrect. While checking for patches is important, 
it doesn’t address the issue of ensuring client connections aren’t 
terminated during a service restart. 
Question 305. Kara, a financial analyst, began to notice unusual 
account activity tied to her credentials. She is sure she hasn’t 
initiated these transactions. Upon further investigation, IT 
discovered a program on her computer that was recording her 
keystrokes. What type of malware was found on Kara’s 
computer? 
(A)       Ransomware 
(B)       Keylogger 
(C)       Adware 
(D)       Rootkit 
	
 
1238

Explanation 305. Correct Answer: B. Keylogger. A keylogger 
is a type of malicious software designed to capture and record 
the keystrokes of a user without their knowledge, often leading 
to unauthorized access to sensitive information such as 
usernames, passwords, and other confidential details. 
Option A is incorrect. Ransomware is malware that encrypts a 
user’s data and demands payment for its decryption. It doesn’t 
record keystrokes. 
Option C is incorrect. Adware delivers unwanted ads to the 
user. It doesn’t record keystrokes. 
Option D is incorrect. A rootkit provides stealthy access to a 
computer, allowing an attacker to maintain privileged access 
without detection. It doesn’t specifically record keystrokes. 
Question 306. Your company has recently deployed an update 
to its CRM application. Post-update, users are experiencing 
connectivity issues. As a security administrator, which of the 
following steps should you take FIRST to address the 
connectivity problem without causing data loss? 
(A)       Restart the application immediately 
(B)       Disconnect all users and then restart the application 
(C)       Validate the update's integrity and then restart the 
application 
(D)       Reinstall the previous version of the CRM application 
Explanation 306. Correct Answer: C. Validate the update’s 
integrity and then restart the application. Before making any 
changes, it’s essential to ensure the update’s integrity. This 
	
 
1239

means confirming that the update was correctly applied and that 
there were no issues during its installation. Once the update’s 
integrity is confirmed, a restart can help apply any changes that 
may not have taken effect immediately. 
Option A is incorrect. Restarting the application immediately 
without validation might cause further complications if the 
update was not correctly applied. 
Option B is incorrect. While disconnecting users might be 
necessary at some point, doing so without validating the 
update’s integrity can result in further disruptions. 
Option D is incorrect. Reinstalling the previous version is a 
drastic step and might not be necessary if the update’s integrity 
can be validated and issues resolved with a restart. 
Question 307. A software company has developed a new 
product. They want to release a user manual that details how to 
use the software, its features, and basic troubleshooting steps. 
What should be the classification of this user manual? 
(A)       Confidential 
(B)       Restricted 
(C)       Public 
(D)       Internal 
Explanation 307. Correct Answer: C. Public. A user manual 
is intended for all users of the software and should be easily 
accessible. It doesn’t contain sensitive or proprietary 
information about the software’s underlying code or algorithms. 
Hence, it should be classified as “Public.” 
	
 
1240

Option A is incorrect. “Confidential” classification is too 
restrictive for a document meant to be distributed with every 
software copy and to guide users. 
Option B is incorrect. “Restricted” would limit the distribution 
of the manual unnecessarily, making it harder for users to access 
the information they need. 
Option D is incorrect. “Internal” classification would suggest 
the manual is only for internal company use, whereas it’s 
intended for all users of the software. 
Question 308. Jake recently ran an old game on his computer 
that he received from a friend. Shortly after, he discovered that 
some of his documents were duplicated with slight 
modifications, and his system’s performance was deteriorating. 
Which kind of malware most likely caused these issues? 
(A)       Adware 
(B)       Trojan 
(C)       Worm 
(D)       Virus 
Explanation 308. Correct Answer: D. Virus. Viruses are 
malicious programs that attach to clean files and can replicate, 
leading to multiple instances of themselves. They can modify or 
corrupt these files and can degrade system performance as they 
propagate. 
Option A is incorrect. Adware primarily focuses on delivering 
unwanted advertisements to the user. While it can be annoying, 
it doesn’t typically duplicate or modify documents. 
	
 
1241

Option B is incorrect. Trojans are malicious software that 
disguises themselves as legitimate programs. While they can 
perform a variety of malicious actions, they don’t self-replicate 
or modify files in the manner described. 
Option C is incorrect. Worms are self-replicating malware that 
spread across networks. While they can cause performance 
issues, they don’t typically attach to files and modify them as 
viruses do. 
Question 309. Caroline, a security analyst, receives an alert that 
an unfamiliar file has been detected on a mission-critical server. 
She suspects it might be malware. What is the BEST immediate 
action Caroline should take regarding this potential threat? 
(A)       Delete the file immediately to prevent further damage 
(B)       Quarantine the file to prevent it from executing or 
spreading 
(C)       Make a copy of the file for further analysis 
(D)       Notify all employees about the suspicious file 
Explanation 309. Correct Answer: B. Quarantine the file to 
prevent it from executing or spreading. Quarantining 
suspicious files isolates them, preventing potential execution or 
spread while allowing further investigation without immediate 
deletion. 
Option A is incorrect. While deleting the file seems proactive, 
it removes the chance for further analysis and can affect 
forensic investigations. 
	
 
1242

Option C is incorrect. Making a copy is important for analysis, 
but the immediate priority should be to prevent potential 
execution or spread of the suspicious file. Quarantine first, then 
analyze. 
Option D is incorrect. Notifying all employees about a specific 
suspicious file may cause panic or confusion. It’s more 
appropriate to manage the incident first and then communicate 
relevant information in a structured manner. 
Question 310. Alex recently purchased a new laptop. Upon first 
startup, he noticed multiple pre-installed software applications, 
most of which he didn’t recognize or find necessary. The 
laptop’s performance was slower than expected given its 
hardware specifications. Which type of software is most likely 
causing this performance degradation? 
(A)       Ransomware 
(B)       Bloatware 
(C)       Spyware 
(D)       Adware 
Explanation 310. Correct Answer: B. Bloatware. Bloatware 
refers to unnecessary software applications that come pre-
installed on new computers. These applications often consume 
system resources, leading to reduced performance. 
Manufacturers sometimes pre-install these applications for 
promotional purposes or due to partnerships with software 
providers. 
	
 
1243

Option A is incorrect. Ransomware encrypts a user’s files and 
demands payment for their decryption. It doesn’t come pre-
installed on new computers. 
Option C is incorrect. Spyware covertly collects information 
from a system without the user’s knowledge. It doesn’t typically 
come pre-installed on new devices as bloatware does. 
Option D is incorrect. Adware automatically displays or 
downloads advertising material on a computer. While it might 
be annoying, it’s not typically pre-installed software that comes 
with new computers aimed at degrading performance. 
Question 311. Julia, a cybersecurity analyst, notices a recently 
installed application named “PhotoEditorPro.exe” on a 
corporate workstation. Upon further inspection, she identifies 
that this application is silently exfiltrating sensitive company 
data to an external IP address. Which type of malware is Julia 
most likely observing? 
(A)       Worm 
(B)       Ransomware 
(C)       Trojan 
(D)       Adware 
Explanation 311. Correct Answer: C. Trojan. A Trojan is a 
type of malware that disguises itself as a legitimate software or 
application. Unlike viruses, Trojans don’t replicate themselves, 
but they can be just as destructive if not more so. In this case, 
the “PhotoEditorPro.exe” appears to be a legitimate photo 
editing application but is actually being used to transmit 
sensitive data to an external source. 
	
 
1244

Option A is incorrect. Worms are malware programs that 
replicate themselves to spread to other devices. They don’t 
typically disguise themselves as legitimate applications. 
Option B is incorrect. Ransomware encrypts the victim’s data 
and demands a ransom to decrypt it. It doesn’t disguise itself as 
legitimate software. 
Option D is incorrect. Adware is software that displays 
unwanted advertisements. It doesn’t typically exfiltrate data or 
disguise itself as legitimate software. 
Question 312. Jane, an employee at XYZ Corp, recently 
noticed that her browser homepage changed unexpectedly, and 
she’s receiving an increasing number of targeted 
advertisements. Additionally, there’s a new toolbar in her 
browser that she doesn’t remember installing. Based on these 
symptoms, which type of malware is most likely affecting 
Jane’s computer? 
(A)       Ransomware 
(B)       Worm 
(C)       Spyware 
(D)       Botnet 
Explanation 312. Correct Answer: C. Spyware. Spyware is a 
type of malware that covertly collects information from a user’s 
system. Changes to browser settings, such as a new homepage 
or a new toolbar, combined with targeted advertisements, are 
common indicators that spyware might be present on a system. 
	
 
1245

Option A is incorrect. Ransomware is malware that encrypts a 
user’s files and demands payment for their release. The 
described symptoms do not align with ransomware behavior. 
Option B is incorrect. Worms are a type of malware that self-
replicate and spread across networks. They typically don’t 
modify browser settings or show targeted advertisements. 
Option D is incorrect. A botnet involves a collection of 
internet-connected devices, which may have been infected with 
malware, being used to perform coordinated tasks. It doesn’t 
directly result in the browser-based symptoms described. 
Question 313. A web server hosting the company’s e-commerce 
site is set for an OS upgrade. The upgrade is expected to last 30 
minutes. What should be a primary consideration to minimize 
customer impact due to potential downtime? 
(A)       Implementing a load balancer 
(B)       Taking a backup of the e-commerce site 
(C)       Posting a maintenance notice a week in advance 
(D)       Upgrading the server's hardware 
Explanation 313. Correct Answer: A. Implementing a load 
balancer. A load balancer can redirect traffic to other servers 
while one is undergoing maintenance, ensuring that customers 
can still access the e-commerce site and minimizing the impact 
of downtime. Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across 
multiple servers, allowing one server to be taken offline without 
affecting the availability of the service. 
	
 
1246

Option B is incorrect. While backups are crucial for disaster 
recovery, they don’t minimize immediate downtime during 
upgrades. 
Option C is incorrect. While informing customers is a good 
practice, it doesn’t prevent downtime. Some customers may still 
try to access the site during maintenance. 
Option D is incorrect. Upgrading the server’s hardware might 
improve performance but doesn’t directly minimize the 
downtime caused by an OS upgrade. 
Question 314. After a significant cybersecurity incident, ABC 
Tech revamped its incident response procedures. However, the 
documentation was not updated to reflect these changes. During 
a subsequent minor incident, there was confusion regarding the 
steps to be followed. Which of the following is the MOST direct 
implication of not updating the incident response 
documentation? 
(A)       The company may have to invest in new cybersecurity 
tools 
(B)       Stakeholders might lose trust in the company’s ability to 
handle incidents 
(C)       Incident response might be inconsistent and less 
effective 
(D)       ABC Tech may have to hire external consultants for 
incident response 
Explanation 314. Correct Answer: C. Incident response 
might be inconsistent and less effective. Without up-to-date 
documentation reflecting the most recent incident response 
	
 
1247

procedures, there’s a risk that the response will be inconsistent, 
leading to inefficiencies and potential oversights. 
Option A is incorrect. While new tools might be beneficial, the 
direct concern with outdated documentation is the effectiveness 
of the response. 
Option B is incorrect. While stakeholder trust is important, the 
immediate implication of outdated documentation is the quality 
of the incident response. 
Option D is incorrect. Hiring external consultants might be an 
option, but the direct consequence of outdated documentation is 
the potential ineffectiveness of the internal response process. 
Question 315. A network administrator has received a new 
security patch for a mission-critical application. Which of the 
following is the BEST action to take before applying this patch 
in the live environment? 
(A)       Apply the patch immediately to ensure system security 
(B)       Notify all users about the upcoming downtime due to 
the patch 
(C)       Test the patch in a separate testing environment 
(D)       Take a backup of only the mission-critical application 
Explanation 315. Correct Answer: C. Test the patch in a 
separate testing environment. Testing any changes, including 
patches, in a separate environment before deploying them to 
production is essential to ensure there are no unintended 
technical implications. This is a key aspect of change 
	
 
1248

management processes and helps prevent system outages or 
vulnerabilities from being introduced. 
Option A is incorrect. While applying patches is crucial for 
maintaining security, doing so immediately without proper 
testing can lead to unforeseen technical problems. 
Option B is incorrect. Notifying users is important, but it’s 
premature to notify them without first testing the patch. 
Option D is incorrect. Taking a backup is a good practice, but 
it is not a substitute for testing the patch first. 
Question 316. During a routine security audit, a company 
discovered an unauthorized wireless access point using the 
same SSID as the company’s official wireless network. 
Additionally, this rogue access point was configured without 
any encryption. What type of wireless attack is this scenario 
most indicative of? 
(A)       War Driving 
(B)       Wireless Phishing 
(C)       Bluejacking 
(D)       Evil Twin 
Explanation 316. Correct Answer: D. Evil Twin. An “Evil 
Twin” attack involves setting up a rogue wireless access point 
that mimics a legitimate access point. By doing so, an attacker 
can intercept, monitor, and manipulate the traffic of users who 
mistakenly connect to the rogue access point. 
	
 
1249

Option A is incorrect. War Driving involves driving around 
areas to discover wireless networks and possibly exploit them. 
It doesn’t necessarily involve creating rogue access points. 
Option B is incorrect. Wireless Phishing is not a standard term 
in wireless network security. Phishing generally involves 
tricking users into revealing sensitive information through 
deceptive websites or emails. 
Option C is incorrect. Bluejacking involves sending 
unsolicited messages to Bluetooth-enabled devices. It’s not 
related to wireless networks (Wi-Fi). 
Question 317. An IT manager is considering solutions to 
protect data stored on the laptops provided to remote 
employees. The primary concern is to ensure that the entire 
content of the laptop’s storage drive is unreadable if a laptop is 
lost or stolen. Which encryption level would best address this 
concern? 
(A)       File-level Encryption 
(B)       Transport-layer Encryption 
(C)       Full-disk Encryption 
(D)       Database-level Encryption 
Explanation 317. Correct Answer: C. Full-disk Encryption. 
Full-disk Encryption (FDE) encrypts the entire storage drive, 
making all data on the drive unreadable without the correct 
decryption key or credentials. This is especially useful for 
portable devices like laptops, which are more vulnerable to 
physical theft. 
	
 
1250

Option A is incorrect. File-level Encryption encrypts 
individual files rather than the entire disk, so some data or 
system files might remain unencrypted. 
Option B is incorrect. Transport-layer Encryption protects data 
in transit, not data at rest on storage drives. 
Option D is incorrect. Database-level Encryption encrypts data 
within a database and does not apply to other files or data 
outside of that database. 
Question 318. An e-commerce website suddenly experiences a 
sharp increase in traffic, causing the website to become slow 
and occasionally inaccessible. The IT team observes that a large 
number of requests are originating from multiple IP addresses 
spread across various countries. What type of network attack is 
the e-commerce website likely experiencing? 
(A)       Man-in-the-middle attack 
(B)       DNS spoofing 
(C)       Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack 
(D)       ARP poisoning 
Explanation 318. Correct Answer: C. Distributed denial-of-
service (DDoS) attack. In a DDoS attack, the attacker uses 
multiple systems, often compromised ones from different 
locations, to flood a target system with requests, making the 
target slow or inaccessible. 
Option A is incorrect. A man-in-the-middle attack involves an 
attacker secretly intercepting and possibly altering the 
	
 
1251

communication between two parties. It doesn’t lead to website 
inaccessibility due to high traffic. 
Option B is incorrect. DNS spoofing is when an attacker 
introduces corrupt DNS cache information to redirect traffic to a 
different IP address, usually under the attacker’s control. It 
doesn’t cause increased traffic from various countries. 
Option D is incorrect. ARP poisoning is a technique by which 
an attacker sends fake ARP messages onto a local area network. 
This is usually used to link an attacker’s MAC address with the 
IP address of another host, causing any traffic meant for that IP 
address to be sent to the attacker instead. 
Question 319. During a scheduled maintenance window, a 
security administrator plans to apply a critical update to the 
company’s firewall. Which of the following actions is MOST 
crucial to ensure minimized downtime during this process? 
(A)       Notifying the firewall vendor about the update 
(B)       Disabling all firewall rules temporarily 
(C)       Creating a rollback plan in case of update failure 
(D)       Scheduling the update during peak business hours 
Explanation 319. Correct Answer: C. Creating a rollback 
plan in case of update failure. In change management 
processes, having a rollback plan ensures that if there are issues 
with the applied update, the system can be reverted to its 
previous state, thereby minimizing downtime. 
	
 
1252

Option A is incorrect. While it might be useful to notify the 
firewall vendor, it is not the most crucial step to minimize 
downtime. 
Option B is incorrect. Disabling all firewall rules can introduce 
significant security risks and might not be related directly to the 
downtime. 
Option D is incorrect. Scheduling updates during peak 
business hours could result in maximum disruption and 
downtime. 
Question 320. A global e-commerce website wants to allow its 
customer service representatives to assist clients with order 
issues without exposing the full credit card details of the clients. 
Which method should the IT department employ to achieve 
this? 
(A)       Replace all digits of the credit card number with random 
characters 
(B)       Display only the last four digits of the credit card 
number while masking the rest 
(C)       Encrypt the credit card number with a symmetric key 
(D)       Use a hash function to represent the credit card number 
Explanation 320. Correct Answer: B. Display only the last 
four digits of the credit card number while masking the rest. 
Displaying only the last four digits and masking the rest ensures 
that customer service representatives have enough information 
to assist customers without being exposed to the entire credit 
card number. 
	
 
1253

Option A is incorrect. Replacing all digits with random 
characters would render the information useless for customer 
service representatives as they would not have any reference 
point. 
Option C is incorrect. Encrypting the card number can protect 
the data, but the customer service representatives would need a 
way to decrypt it to access even partial information, defeating 
the purpose of not exposing them to the full details. 
Option D is incorrect. Hashing the number would not allow 
any portion of the original data, like the last four digits, to be 
viewed, making it ineffective for this use case. 
Question 321. A security analyst at DataCorp is tasked with 
preventing unauthorized external applications from connecting 
to their server. Which approach should the analyst primarily rely 
on to achieve this? 
(A)       Implement an allow list for approved applications 
(B)       Monitor server CPU usage 
(C)       Regularly patch server software 
(D)       Encrypt data at rest on the server 
Explanation 321. Correct Answer: A. Implement an allow 
list for approved applications. By implementing an allow list, 
the analyst can specify which applications are authorized to 
connect to the server. Any application not on the list will be 
prevented from establishing a connection, effectively stopping 
unauthorized external applications. 
	
 
1254

Option B is incorrect. While monitoring server CPU usage can 
provide insights into the server’s performance and potential 
anomalies, it doesn’t prevent unauthorized applications from 
connecting. 
Option C is incorrect. Regularly patching server software is a 
best practice for security to fix known vulnerabilities. However, 
patching doesn’t directly prevent specific external applications 
from connecting. 
Option D is incorrect. Encrypting data at rest helps protect 
stored data from unauthorized access but does not regulate 
which applications can connect to the server. 
Question 322. Your organization plans to upgrade its database 
system. To maintain security during this process, which of the 
following actions should be RESTRICTED until the upgrade is 
validated? 
(A)       Monitoring the database for any anomalies 
(B)       Allowing end-users to access the upgraded database 
(C)       Making regular backups of the database 
(D)       Reviewing the database system logs 
Explanation 322. Correct Answer: B. Allowing end-users to 
access the upgraded database. Until the upgraded system is 
validated and any potential issues are addressed, end-user 
access should be restricted. This ensures that any vulnerabilities 
or problems introduced by the upgrade don’t compromise data 
or allow unauthorized activities. 
	
 
1255

Option A is incorrect. Monitoring the database is crucial to 
identify any potential security issues and should not be 
restricted. 
Option C is incorrect. Regular backups should continue, as 
they are part of a comprehensive disaster recovery and data 
protection strategy. 
Option D is incorrect. Reviewing logs is essential to monitor 
the system’s health and security; hence, it should not be 
restricted. 
Question 323. After a series of system enhancements, a 
financial organization decided to use a manual method of 
documenting changes in separate files rather than implementing 
a version control system. During an audit, the cybersecurity 
team struggled to determine which version of a critical system 
file was the most recent and accurate. What is the PRIMARY 
risk of not implementing version control for such 
documentation? 
(A)       Increased storage requirements for multiple files 
(B)       Difficulty in collaborating between team members 
(C)       Lack of traceability and difficulty in reverting to a 
known stable state 
(D)       Greater need for training staff on manual documentation 
Explanation 323. Correct Answer: C. Lack of traceability 
and difficulty in reverting to a known stable state. Version 
control provides a clear history of changes, ensuring easy 
reversion to a known stable state, and identifying the latest 
version of a document or system file. In the absence of version 
	
 
1256

control, identifying the most recent and accurate version can be 
challenging. 
Option A is incorrect. While storage might be a concern, the 
primary risk is the inability to trace changes and revert to a 
stable state. 
Option B is incorrect. Collaboration might be hindered, but the 
direct risk is associated with traceability and stability. 
Option D is incorrect. Training staff is always essential, but 
the immediate concern is the ability to trace and manage 
changes. 
Question 324. Your organization is preparing to upgrade a 
database server that supports an e-commerce application. A 
review of the change management documentation has revealed 
that multiple applications rely on this particular database server 
for various functionalities. Which of the following steps should 
be taken FIRST to ensure a smooth upgrade process without 
disruptions? 
(A)       Upgrade the database server immediately to benefit 
from new features 
(B)       Perform a backup of the database server 
(C)       Identify and test all applications that have 
dependencies on the database server 
(D)       Inform users about potential downtime during the 
upgrade 
Explanation 324. Correct Answer: C. Identify and test all 
applications that have dependencies on the database server. 
	
 
1257

Before making changes, especially to systems with multiple 
dependencies, it’s crucial to understand the full scope of 
potential impacts. By identifying and testing all dependent 
applications, you ensure that the upgrade won’t inadvertently 
disrupt other services or functionalities. 
Option A is incorrect. Upgrading immediately without 
considering dependencies can lead to unforeseen disruptions 
and complications. 
Option B is incorrect. While backing up the server is a good 
practice, understanding dependencies should come first to plan 
the upgrade effectively. 
Option D is incorrect. Informing users is essential, but 
understanding the upgrade’s potential impact should come first 
to provide accurate information. 
Question 325. A multinational corporation is concerned about 
the possibility of losing access to encrypted data due to the loss 
or compromise of private keys. They’ve approached a third-
party organization for a solution. Which of the following is a 
system that allows the third party to securely hold a copy of the 
corporation’s cryptographic keys to ensure data recoverability? 
(A)       Public Key Repository 
(B)       Key Generation Center 
(C)       Key Escrow 
(D)       Key Renewal Service 
Explanation 325. Correct Answer: C. Key Escrow. Key 
escrow is a system in which cryptographic keys are securely 
	
 
1258

stored with a third party, so they can be retrieved in cases where 
the original keys are lost or compromised. This ensures data 
recoverability while maintaining security. 
Option A is incorrect. A Public Key Repository is where public 
keys are stored for retrieval, not for backup or recovery 
purposes. 
Option B is incorrect. Key Generation Center is responsible 
for creating cryptographic keys, not storing them for recovery 
purposes. 
Option D is incorrect. Key Renewal Service deals with 
replacing and updating cryptographic keys as they expire or 
need refreshing, not storing them for recovery. 
Question 326. A software developer at XYZ Corp included a 
piece of code in the company’s software that would corrupt the 
application’s databases if his name was ever removed from the 
list of contributors in the application credits. Months after he 
left the company, the application databases were corrupted after 
an update. What type of malware was responsible for this 
action? 
(A)       Trojan 
(B)       Spyware 
(C)       Adware 
(D)      Logic bomb 
Explanation 326. Correct Answer: D. Logic bomb. A logic 
bomb is a type of malware that is triggered by a specific event 
	
 
1259

or condition. In this case, the software developer’s name being 
removed from the contributors triggered the malicious code. 
Option A is incorrect. A Trojan disguises itself as legitimate 
software but performs malicious activities once installed. The 
scenario does not describe behavior characteristic of a Trojan. 
Option B is incorrect. Spyware is designed to collect and send 
information, typically without the user’s knowledge. It does not 
corrupt databases based on specific triggers. 
Option C is incorrect. Adware delivers unwanted 
advertisements to the user. It does not take malicious actions 
based on specific events. 
Question 327. An employee notices a stranger standing 
unusually close to her with an unfamiliar device while she uses 
her RFID badge to enter the office building. A few days later, 
her colleague’s badge suddenly stops working, even though it 
was not reported lost or damaged. What type of attack should 
the security team suspect? 
(A)       Brute force attack on the access control system 
(B)       RFID cloning 
(C)       Tailgating 
(D)       RFID jamming 
Explanation 327. Correct Answer: B. RFID cloning. RFID 
cloning involves making an unauthorized copy of an RFID 
badge or tag by capturing its signal. The stranger standing 
unusually close with a device might have been capturing the 
RFID signal to clone it. 
	
 
1260

Option A is incorrect. While a brute force attack on an access 
control system involves trying multiple combinations to gain 
access, the scenario does not describe multiple access attempts 
or any involvement with the system itself. 
Option C is incorrect. Tailgating involves following an 
authorized individual into a secure area without the proper 
credentials. The scenario describes a potential RFID capture, 
not someone following another person. 
Option D is incorrect. RFID jamming would involve 
interfering with the RFID signal to prevent it from working, not 
copying the RFID details for unauthorized use. 
Question 328. An employee at a large corporation has recently 
installed an app on his company-issued mobile device from a 
website instead of the approved app store. The app claimed to 
help boost productivity, but soon after, sensitive data from the 
mobile device was found to be transmitted to an unknown 
server. What mobile vulnerability was exploited? 
(A)       Inadequate password policies 
(B)       Open Wi-Fi connection 
(C)       Mobile device side loading 
(D)       Lack of mobile device encryption 
Explanation 328. Correct Answer: C. Mobile device side 
loading. Side loading refers to the practice of installing apps on 
a mobile device from sources other than the approved app store. 
This can expose the device to apps that have not been vetted for 
security, leading to potential data compromise, as described in 
the scenario. 
	
 
1261

Option A is incorrect. While inadequate password policies can 
expose a device to unauthorized access, the scenario specifically 
mentions an app installed from an unapproved source, which 
points to side loading. 
Option B is incorrect. An open Wi-Fi connection can expose 
mobile devices to threats, but the main issue described in the 
scenario revolves around the installation of an app from an 
unapproved source. 
Option D is incorrect. While mobile device encryption is 
essential to protect data, the issue in the scenario is related to 
side loading, not the encryption status of the device. 
Question 329. A user reports that whenever they try to visit 
their online banking website, they are redirected to a website 
that looks identical but has a slightly different URL. The fake 
website asks for additional personal details that the bank never 
requested before. Which type of DNS attack is the user likely 
encountering? 
(A)       DNS Tunneling 
(B)       DNS Fast Flux 
(C)       DNS Cache Poisoning 
(D)       Domain Hijacking 
Explanation 329. Correct Answer: C. DNS Cache Poisoning. 
DNS Cache Poisoning, also known as DNS spoofing, involves 
corrupting the DNS cache data in DNS resolvers to redirect 
users to malicious websites instead of the actual intended 
websites. 
	
 
1262

Option A is incorrect. DNS Tunneling is a technique where 
non-DNS traffic is encapsulated in DNS protocols. It’s a way to 
bypass network security but doesn’t usually lead to the 
described redirection scenario. 
Option B is incorrect. DNS Fast Flux involves rapidly 
changing the IP address associated with a domain name to hide 
the malicious server behind it. It is used to prevent the 
malicious domain from being taken down but doesn’t cause 
redirection to a similar-looking site. 
Option D is incorrect. Domain Hijacking involves an attacker 
taking control of a domain by altering its registration data 
without the owner’s permission. While this could lead to a 
similar outcome, the scenario describes a situation where only 
certain users are redirected, not all visitors to the domain. 
Question 330. An IT security team received reports that a new, 
previously unknown vulnerability was being actively exploited 
in the wild. The software vendor has not yet provided a patch 
for the vulnerability. What is the most accurate term for this 
vulnerability? 
(A)       Legacy vulnerability 
(B)       Zero-day vulnerability 
(C)       Patched vulnerability 
(D)       Known vulnerability 
Explanation 330. Correct Answer: B. Zero-day 
vulnerability. A zero-day vulnerability refers to a flaw in 
software, hardware, or firmware that is unknown to the vendor. 
This type of vulnerability is a risk because there is no fix or 
	
 
1263

patch for it at the time of discovery, and it may already be 
actively exploited by malicious actors. 
Option A is incorrect. A legacy vulnerability typically refers to 
a vulnerability in older software or systems that might not be 
supported anymore, not necessarily an unknown and unpatched 
flaw. 
Option C is incorrect. A patched vulnerability implies that 
there’s already a fix available for the flaw. In the scenario 
provided, no patch has been released yet. 
Option D is incorrect. While the vulnerability may become 
known to some entities, such as the security team in this 
scenario, it remains unknown to the software vendor. Thus, 
“known vulnerability” is not the most accurate descriptor in this 
context. 
Question 331. An online payment gateway is evaluating 
methods to enhance the security of its payment processing 
system. They want a solution that replaces sensitive cardholder 
data with a unique identifier that has no intrinsic value by itself. 
Which method should they implement? 
(A)       Hashing the card data 
(B)       Encrypting the card data 
(C)       Masking the card data 
(D)       Tokenizing the card data 
Explanation 331. Correct Answer: D. Tokenizing the card 
data. Tokenization involves replacing sensitive data with a non-
	
 
1264

sensitive equivalent, referred to as a token, that has no extrinsic 
or exploitable meaning or value. 
Option A is incorrect. Hashing would produce a fixed-size 
string, which cannot be reversed to its original value, but it 
doesn’t create a “token” that can be swapped back for the 
original data. 
Option B is incorrect. Encryption translates data into another 
form, or code, so that only people with access to a secret key or 
password can read it. It does not replace the data with a unique 
identifier with no intrinsic value. 
Option C is incorrect. Masking involves hiding parts of data, 
such as showing only the last four digits of a credit card 
number. It doesn’t replace the data with a unique identifier. 
Question 332. A multinational corporation communicates 
sensitive information between its branches using encryption. An 
internal audit reveals that the encryption algorithms being used 
are those that were deprecated several years ago. Which of the 
following cryptographic vulnerabilities is the organization most 
exposed to? 
(A)       Key generation flaw 
(B)       Weak algorithms susceptible to attacks 
(C)       Inadequate public key infrastructure 
(D)       Mismanagement of cryptographic keys 
Explanation 332. Correct Answer: B. Weak algorithms 
susceptible to attacks. When an organization is found to be 
using deprecated or older encryption algorithms, it means they 
	
 
1265

are relying on cryptographic methods that might have known 
vulnerabilities or could be easier to break due to advancements 
in computing and cryptanalysis. Over time, certain algorithms 
are found to have weaknesses and are replaced with more robust 
ones. 
Option A is incorrect. The scenario does not specify issues 
with key generation but rather focuses on the use of outdated 
encryption algorithms. 
Option C is incorrect. There’s no information in the scenario 
suggesting problems with the organization’s public key 
infrastructure. 
Option D is incorrect. While key management is crucial, the 
primary issue presented in the scenario revolves around the 
usage of weak or outdated algorithms. 
Question 333. During a quarterly review, the IT team at a 
logistics company decided to change the configuration of their 
load balancers to better distribute traffic among their servers. 
After the change, a series of technical issues emerged, affecting 
customer-facing applications. When troubleshooting the issue, it 
was discovered that the network diagrams had not been updated 
to reflect the new changes. What is the MAJOR consequence of 
not having updated diagrams in such a scenario? 
(A)       The servers might need a hardware upgrade 
(B)       The company might need to revert to the old load 
balancer configuration 
(C)       It increases the time and complexity of 
	
 
1266

troubleshooting 
(D)       Customers might prefer other logistics companies 
Explanation 333. Correct Answer: C. It increases the time 
and complexity of troubleshooting. Accurate and up-to-date 
documentation, including network diagrams, is crucial for 
effective troubleshooting. Without it, IT teams can spend 
unnecessary time trying to understand the current state of the 
system, delaying the resolution of the issue. 
Option A is incorrect. While server upgrades might be 
necessary in some cases, it’s not a direct consequence of 
outdated diagrams. 
Option B is incorrect. Reverting to an old configuration might 
be a potential solution, but the primary issue is the increased 
troubleshooting complexity due to outdated documentation. 
Option D is incorrect. While the potential loss of customers 
can be an indirect consequence of prolonged technical issues, 
the immediate concern of outdated diagrams is the impact on 
troubleshooting. 
Question 334. An online banking website employs a system 
that automatically logs out users after 10 minutes of inactivity 
to ensure that if a user forgets to log out, no one else can alter 
the user’s banking details. Which principle of the CIA triad is 
the banking website MOST directly addressing? 
(A)       Confidentiality 
(B)       Availability 
	
 
1267

(C)       Authentication 
(D)       Integrity 
Explanation 334. Correct Answer: D. Integrity.  The integrity 
pillar of the CIA triad ensures the accuracy and reliability of 
data. By logging out users after a period of inactivity, the 
banking website aims to prevent unauthorized modifications 
(potentially by someone else who might gain access to the 
unattended session) to the user’s banking details, thereby 
maintaining the integrity of the data. 
Option A is incorrect. While logging out users does have a 
confidentiality aspect, the primary aim in this scenario is to 
prevent unauthorized changes rather than unauthorized viewing. 
Option B is incorrect. Availability ensures that data and 
systems are accessible to authorized users when they need it. 
This scenario doesn’t discuss providing or restricting access 
based on system uptime or accessibility. 
Option C is incorrect. Authentication ensures that users are 
who they claim to be. While the scenario does touch on security 
measures, the primary concern here is preventing unauthorized 
changes to data, which aligns with integrity, not authentication. 
Question 335. A user, Amy, wants to securely send a 
confidential document to her colleague, Bob. Amy decides to 
encrypt the document to ensure its confidentiality. Which of the 
following should Amy use to encrypt the document, ensuring 
only Bob can decrypt it? 
(A)       Amy's private key 
	
 
1268

(B)       Amy's public key 
(C)       Bob's private key 
(D)       Bob's public key 
Explanation 335. Correct Answer: D. Bob’s public key. In 
asymmetric encryption, if a message is encrypted with an 
individual’s public key, only the corresponding private key can 
decrypt it. Therefore, to ensure Bob is the only person who can 
decrypt the document, Amy should encrypt it using Bob’s 
public key. 
Option A is incorrect. Encrypting with Amy’s private key 
would allow anyone with Amy’s public key to decrypt it, and it 
would also serve as a digital signature rather than ensuring 
confidentiality. 
Option B is incorrect. Using Amy’s public key would not 
make sense because then only Amy’s private key could decrypt 
it. 
Option C is incorrect. The private key should never be shared 
or used for encryption. Its main use is for decryption and 
signing. 
Question 336. A tech startup is developing a mobile application 
that offers exclusive content only to users within a specific 
country due to licensing agreements. Which method should the 
startup use to ensure that only users within that country can 
access the content? 
(A)       Integrate a time-based one-time password (TOTP) 
system 
	
 
1269

(B)       Use geolocation-based access controls 
(C)       Enable biometric authentication 
(D)       Implement IP whitelisting 
Explanation 336. Correct Answer: B. Use geolocation-based 
access controls. Geolocation-based access controls can identify 
a user’s geographic location and allow or deny access based on 
predefined geographic boundaries, making it the most suitable 
solution for the startup’s requirement. 
Option A is incorrect. TOTP systems provide a second factor 
of authentication based on time, not geographic location. 
Option C is incorrect. Biometric authentication verifies the 
identity of a user based on physical or behavioral characteristics 
but does not restrict access based on geography. 
Option D is incorrect. IP whitelisting allows access only to 
specific IP addresses. While it can offer a level of geographic 
restriction, it’s not as precise as geolocation-based controls and 
may inadvertently block or allow users. 
Question 337. An organization’s IT department noticed a rapid 
increase in network traffic over the past 24 hours. 
Simultaneously, many employees reported that their systems 
have been slow and that they received a file named 
“updatePatch.exe” from coworkers via email, even though the 
coworkers did not intentionally send any files. What type of 
malware is most likely responsible for this behavior? 
(A)       Trojan 
(B)       Ransomware 
	
 
1270

(C)       Adware 
(D)       Worm 
Explanation 337. Correct Answer: D. Worm. Worms are a 
type of malware that self-replicates and spreads to other 
devices. The rapid increase in network traffic and the 
distribution of a file to various users without the sender’s 
knowledge is characteristic of worm behavior. They can 
consume bandwidth and system resources, causing systems to 
slow down. 
Option A is incorrect. A Trojan disguises itself as legitimate 
software but does not replicate itself or send itself via email like 
worms do. 
Option B is incorrect. Ransomware encrypts files on a victim’s 
computer and demands a ransom for the decryption key. It 
doesn’t self-replicate and spread like a worm. 
Option C is incorrect. Adware primarily serves unwanted ads 
to users and doesn’t replicate itself to spread to other systems. 
Question 338. A software development company maintains a 
shared code repository. The company wants to ensure that only 
developers can make changes to the code, but testers should be 
able to view the code without modifying it. Which approach 
should be implemented? 
(A)       Assign all employees read-only permissions 
(B)       Provide testers with administrative rights 
(C)       Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) 
(D)       Use data encryption on the repository 
	
 
1271

Explanation 338. Correct Answer: C. Implement role-based 
access controls (RBAC). RBAC assigns permissions based on 
roles within an organization. Developers can be given a role that 
allows them to modify code, while testers are given a role that 
only allows them to read the code. 
Option A is incorrect. Assigning read-only permissions to all 
employees will prevent developers from making necessary 
changes to the code. 
Option B is incorrect. Providing testers with administrative 
rights would give them more access than necessary, potentially 
allowing them to modify the code. 
Option D is incorrect. While data encryption ensures the 
confidentiality of the data, it does not address the need for 
specific permission levels for different user roles. 
Question 339. An organization recently deployed a cloud-based 
database to support its new application. A few weeks later, 
unauthorized access to the database was detected. An 
investigation revealed that the database was accessible without 
a password. Which of the following misconfigurations is 
primarily responsible for the security breach? 
(A)       Default configurations left unchanged 
(B)       Insufficient network segmentation 
(C)       Encryption not enabled at rest 
(D)       Lack of intrusion detection system 
Explanation 339. Correct Answer: A. Default configurations 
left unchanged. The scenario describes a situation where a 
	
 
1272

cloud-based database was accessible without a password. This 
is a common oversight when default configurations, which may 
have no password or a widely known default password, are left 
unchanged upon deployment. 
Option B is incorrect. While network segmentation is crucial 
for security, the primary issue in this scenario is the database’s 
lack of password protection, not its network placement. 
Option C is incorrect. Though encryption at rest is a best 
practice for data protection, the immediate issue here is 
unauthorized access due to a lack of password, not data 
exposure from the database’s stored data. 
Option D is incorrect. An intrusion detection system (IDS) 
might have detected the unauthorized access sooner, but the 
core vulnerability was the unchanged default configurations. 
Question 340. During a routine security review, a security 
analyst discovers multiple failed login attempts to a secure 
server room’s electronic access control system, all within a 
short time span. The access logs show a sequential pattern of 
access codes being tried. What type of physical attack is likely 
being attempted? 
(A)       Tailgating 
(B)       Phishing 
(C)       Brute force 
(D)       Social engineering 
Explanation 340. Correct Answer: C. Brute force. A brute 
force attack involves trying every possible combination in an 
	
 
1273

attempt to find the correct one. The sequential pattern of access 
codes being tried in the logs suggests that the attacker is 
systematically going through all potential combinations. 
Option A is incorrect. Tailgating involves an attacker 
following an authorized person into a secure area without the 
proper credentials. It doesn’t involve multiple electronic access 
code attempts. 
Option B is incorrect. Phishing is a type of social engineering 
attack that typically involves tricking someone into divulging 
their credentials or other sensitive information. It doesn’t 
involve direct physical access attempts. 
Option D is incorrect. While social engineering does involve 
manipulating individuals to gain unauthorized access, it is not 
specific to a brute force attack on an electronic system. 
Question 341. A multinational e-commerce company is 
expanding its infrastructure to handle increasing traffic. The 
primary goal is to distribute the incoming web traffic across 
multiple servers to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed. 
Which method should the company use? 
(A)       Deploy a web application firewall 
(B)       Implement server clustering 
(C)       Use hardware-based firewalls 
(D)       Set up a load balancer 
Explanation 341. Correct Answer: D. Set up a load balancer. 
Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple 
	
 
1274

servers to ensure that no single server is overwhelmed, which 
enhances the availability and fault tolerance of applications. 
Option A is incorrect. While a web application firewall can 
protect against web-based threats, it doesn’t distribute incoming 
traffic across servers. 
Option B is incorrect. Server clustering primarily focuses on 
providing redundancy and failover capabilities rather than 
distributing incoming traffic. 
Option C is incorrect. Hardware-based firewalls are primarily 
used to filter traffic and protect networks from external threats, 
not to distribute incoming web traffic. 
Question 342. Alice needs to provide proof of the authenticity 
of a digital document she’s sending to Bob. Which of the 
following cryptographic elements should Alice use to 
accomplish this task and ensure Bob knows the document came 
from her? 
(A)       Encrypt the document with Bob's private key 
(B)       Encrypt the document with her public key 
(C)       Sign the document with her private key 
(D)       Sign the document with Bob's public key 
Explanation 342. Correct Answer: C. Sign the document 
with her private key. To prove authenticity, a digital signature 
is created using the sender’s private key. When Bob receives the 
document, he can verify the signature using Alice’s public key. 
This proves that the document was signed by Alice and has not 
been tampered with during transit. 
	
 
1275

Option A is incorrect. Bob’s private key is known only to Bob 
and should never be used by anyone else, including for 
encryption. 
Option B is incorrect. Encrypting with Alice’s public key 
doesn’t prove authenticity. It would also mean only Alice’s 
private key could decrypt it, which isn’t the intent. 
Option D is incorrect. One does not sign documents with the 
recipient’s public key. Signatures are created using the sender’s 
private key. 
Question 343. Sarah, a cybersecurity analyst, receives a report 
that a company laptop was stolen from an employee’s car. The 
laptop contained sensitive financial data. Sarah checked the 
company’s security configurations and found that the laptop 
was equipped with full-disk encryption. How does this impact 
the potential data breach situation? 
(A)       The data remains easily accessible, as only the boot 
sector was encrypted 
(B)       The data is protected, as the entire hard drive's 
contents are encrypted 
(C)       The data is partially encrypted, with only the user 
directories protected 
(D)       The data is vulnerable since full-disk encryption only 
applies when the laptop is connected to the company network 
Explanation 343. Correct Answer: B. The data is protected, 
as the entire hard drive’s contents are encrypted. Full-disk 
Encryption (FDE) encrypts the entirety of a hard drive, ensuring 
that all its contents, including system and user files, are 
	
 
1276

unreadable without the appropriate decryption key or 
credentials. As such, even if the laptop is stolen, the data 
remains secured unless the attacker has the decryption key. 
Option A is incorrect. Full-disk Encryption does not encrypt 
only the boot sector; it encrypts the entire disk. 
Option C is incorrect. Full-disk Encryption doesn’t only 
encrypt user directories; it encrypts the whole disk. 
Option D is incorrect. Full-disk Encryption protects the data at 
all times, irrespective of the laptop’s connection to a network. 
Question 344. A large news website was rendered unavailable 
during a major news event. Network logs show an 
overwhelming amount of traffic from IoT devices. Which type 
of DDoS attack leveraged IoT devices is this indicative of? 
(A)       Reflected Attack 
(B)       Botnet Attack 
(C)       Amplification Attack 
(D)       Teardrop Attack 
Explanation 344. Correct Answer: B. Botnet Attack. Botnets, 
which are networks of compromised devices (including IoT 
devices), are often used to conduct large-scale DDoS attacks by 
directing the combined bandwidth of the devices towards a 
target. 
Option A is incorrect. In a reflected attack, an attacker sends 
traffic to a third party, disguising it as if it came from the victim, 
	
 
1277

which then reflects the traffic to the victim. It doesn’t primarily 
involve IoT devices. 
Option C is incorrect. An amplification attack leverages 
vulnerable network services to amplify the amount of traffic 
sent to a victim. The primary focus isn’t the use of IoT devices. 
Option D is incorrect. A teardrop attack involves sending 
mangled IP fragments with overlapping and oversized payloads 
to crash a target system. It doesn’t specifically utilize IoT 
devices. 
Question 345. A security administrator needs to apply a 
configuration change to a critical service, requiring a service 
restart. Before initiating the restart, which of the following steps 
is MOST important to ensure continuous service availability? 
(A)       Implement automatic service restart on failure 
(B)       Announce the restart to all company employees 
(C)       Schedule the restart during off-peak hours 
(D)       Take a backup of the current service configuration 
Explanation 345. Correct Answer: A. Implement automatic 
service restart on failure. Having an automatic service restart 
on failure ensures that if any issues arise after applying the 
configuration change, the service will attempt to restart itself, 
ensuring minimal interruption to its availability. 
Option B is incorrect. While notifying company employees is 
good practice, it doesn’t directly ensure continuous service 
availability. 
	
 
1278

Option C is incorrect. Scheduling during off-peak hours 
minimizes impact but doesn’t ensure the service will be 
available if issues arise post-restart. 
Option D is incorrect. While taking a backup of the 
configuration is crucial for rollback purposes, it doesn’t ensure 
the service will remain available immediately post-restart. 
Question 346. The finance department at a large firm still relies 
on a legacy application for their quarterly reporting. This 
application is known to have some security flaws, but due to its 
critical nature, it cannot be easily replaced. How can the firm 
BEST mitigate the risks associated with this application? 
(A)       Train the finance team about the latest cybersecurity 
threats 
(B)       Run the legacy application on the latest hardware to 
improve performance 
(C)       Place the legacy application behind a web 
application firewall (WAF) 
(D)       Frequently change the passwords of users who have 
access to the application 
Explanation 346. Correct Answer: C. Place the legacy 
application behind a web application firewall (WAF). By 
placing the application behind a WAF, the firm can filter, 
monitor, and block malicious HTTP traffic targeting the 
application’s vulnerabilities, thereby offering a layer of 
protection against potential security flaws in the legacy 
application. 
	
 
1279

Option A is incorrect. While training is essential, it doesn’t 
directly address the vulnerabilities in the legacy application. 
Option B is incorrect. Using the latest hardware might improve 
application performance but doesn’t mitigate the security risks 
associated with its vulnerabilities. 
Option D is incorrect. While frequent password changes can 
enhance security, they don’t address the inherent vulnerabilities 
in the legacy application. 
Question 347. A company is preparing to roll out a new 
infrastructure deployment for its internal network. They have a 
server that will store both highly confidential customer 
information and non-sensitive marketing material. The IT 
department wants to ensure that only the confidential data is 
encrypted, while the marketing data remains easily accessible. 
Which level of encryption would be most suitable for this 
scenario? 
(A)       File-level Encryption 
(B)       Full-disk Encryption 
(C)       Partition Encryption 
(D)       Transport-layer Encryption 
Explanation 347. Correct Answer: C. Partition Encryption. 
Partition Encryption allows specific partitions or volumes of a 
storage drive to be encrypted. By encrypting only the partition 
that contains confidential data, the company can ensure the 
security of sensitive information while leaving other partitions, 
such as the one with marketing material, unencrypted for easy 
access. 
	
 
1280

Option A is incorrect. File-level Encryption would require 
each confidential file to be encrypted individually, which could 
be cumbersome. 
Option B is incorrect. Full-disk Encryption would encrypt the 
entire disk, including the non-sensitive marketing material. 
Option D is incorrect. Transport-layer Encryption protects data 
in transit, not data at rest on storage drives  
Question 348. An organization’s security team discovered that 
an attacker had gained unauthorized access to a server. Upon 
investigating, they found a software tool that allowed the 
attacker to mask processes, files, and system data, effectively 
remaining hidden while maintaining privileged access. What 
type of malware was implanted by the attacker? 
(A)       Trojan 
(B)       Worm 
(C)       Logic Bomb 
(D)       Rootkit 
Explanation 348. Correct Answer: D. Rootkit. A rootkit is 
malware that provides stealthy access to a computer and hides 
its presence from standard detection methods. It can mask files, 
processes, and other system data. 
Option A is incorrect. A Trojan disguises itself as legitimate 
software but performs malicious activities once installed. It does 
not inherently hide processes or files. 
	
 
1281

Option B is incorrect. Worms are malware that can replicate 
themselves to spread to other systems. They don’t typically hide 
their activities at the system level. 
Option C is incorrect. A logic bomb is set to execute its 
malicious activity when a specific event or condition occurs. It 
doesn’t focus on hiding system data or processes. 
Question 349. As part of an initial penetration testing phase, 
Jackson is using tools that directly probe and interact with the 
target system’s network to discover open ports, services, and 
other potential access points. While this approach is more direct 
and could be detected by the target’s security systems, it 
provides detailed and actionable insights. Which type of 
reconnaissance is Jackson performing? 
(A)       Threat analysis 
(B)       Passive reconnaissance 
(C)       Active reconnaissance 
(D)       Social engineering 
Explanation 349. Correct Answer: C. Active reconnaissance. 
Active reconnaissance involves directly interacting with the 
target systems to gain more detailed and actionable information. 
In this phase, tools and techniques that can be detected by the 
target’s security measures, such as port scanning, are often used. 
Jackson’s approach matches the characteristics of active 
reconnaissance. 
Option A is incorrect. Threat analysis is the process of 
identifying, assessing, and prioritizing threats against a system 
or organization. 
	
 
1282

Option B is incorrect. Passive reconnaissance is about 
collecting data without direct interaction with the target 
systems, typically using third-party sources, public records, and 
other non-intrusive methods. 
Option D is incorrect. Social engineering involves 
manipulating individuals to reveal confidential information or 
perform certain actions, and it is not directly related to network 
probing or service discovery. 
Question 350. HealthCareNow, a large hospital chain, wants to 
ensure its newly implemented electronic health record (EHR) 
system adheres to national standards. Which type of audit would 
be most appropriate to confirm that HealthCareNow is in 
compliance with national regulations regarding patient data? 
(A)       Self-assessment using internal standards 
(B)       Third-party risk assessment 
(C)       External regulatory audit 
(D)       Informal peer review 
Explanation 350. Correct Answer: C. External regulatory 
audit. External regulatory audits are conducted by external 
entities to ensure that organizations are complying with industry 
or national regulations. For HealthCareNow, an external 
regulatory audit will confirm that its EHR system complies with 
national standards related to patient data. 
Option A is incorrect. While self-assessments are beneficial for 
internal reviews, they might not carry the same weight or depth 
of scrutiny that external regulatory audits possess. 
	
 
1283

Option B is incorrect. Third-party risk assessments focus on 
evaluating the security risks associated with external partners 
and vendors, not on confirming compliance with national 
regulations. 
Option D is incorrect. An informal peer review might offer 
insights and suggestions but lacks the formal structure and 
regulatory emphasis of an external audit. 
Question 351. A healthcare provider stores vast amounts of 
patient data on its servers. While they have strong perimeter 
defenses, they want an additional layer of security to ensure 
patient data remains confidential even in the event of 
unauthorized access. Which of the following would be the 
MOST effective solution for this requirement? 
(A)       Use hash algorithms on all patient data 
(B)       Implement data deduplication techniques 
(C)       Encrypt the stored patient data 
(D)       Use a web application firewall (WAF) 
Explanation 351. Correct Answer: C. Encrypt the stored 
patient data. Encrypting patient data ensures that even if 
malicious actors gain access to the data, they won’t be able to 
understand or utilize it without the proper decryption key. 
Option A is incorrect. Hashing is primarily used for verifying 
data integrity or storing passwords securely. Hashing would not 
allow the healthcare provider to retrieve and use the patient data 
when needed. 
	
 
1284

Option B is incorrect. Data deduplication is about reducing 
storage requirements by removing duplicate data; it doesn’t 
provide confidentiality. 
Option D is incorrect. While a WAF provides protection 
against web-based threats, it doesn’t ensure the confidentiality 
of stored data in the event of unauthorized access. 
Question 352. John, a citizen of a country that strictly follows 
the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), used a global 
online shopping platform for a year. He decided to stop using 
the platform and requested the deletion of all his personal data. 
What is the online platform’s primary obligation concerning 
John’s request under the “Right to be Forgotten” principle? 
(A)       Retain the data but ensure that John's data is never used 
for marketing purposes 
(B)       Delete all personal data about John unless there's a 
legal reason to keep it 
(C)       Anonymize John's data and notify him of the 
completion 
(D)       Move John's data to a secure, encrypted server where it 
won't be accessed 
Explanation 352. Correct Answer: B. Delete all personal 
data about John unless there’s a legal reason to keep it. The 
“Right to be Forgotten” under GDPR allows citizens to ask 
organizations to delete their personal data unless the 
organization has a legitimate reason (e.g., legal obligations) to 
retain the data. 
	
 
1285

Option A is incorrect. Merely refraining from using John’s data 
for marketing does not satisfy the “Right to be Forgotten.” 
Option C is incorrect. Anonymization does not equate to the 
removal of data, and GDPR’s “Right to be Forgotten” 
specifically refers to the deletion of data. 
Option D is incorrect. Simply moving the data to a secure 
server doesn’t align with the principles of the “Right to be 
Forgotten.” The data needs to be deleted unless there’s a valid 
reason to retain it. 
Question 353. TechFirm, a leading technology conglomerate, 
recently conducted a security exercise. The goal was for the 
internal security team to defend against a series of simulated 
attacks from an external red team. While the red team launched 
attacks, the internal team’s objective was to detect, respond, and 
mitigate those threats. What type of penetration testing is 
TechFirm employing for its internal security team? 
(A)       Offensive penetration testing 
(B)       Passive penetration testing 
(C)       Defensive penetration testing 
(D)       Black box testing 
Explanation 353. Correct Answer: C. Defensive penetration 
testing. Defensive penetration testing is designed to test the 
organization’s capability to defend its systems and networks 
against attacks. It typically involves an internal security team 
(often called the blue team) that defends against simulated 
attacks. 
	
 
1286

Option A is incorrect. Offensive penetration testing involves 
actively trying to exploit vulnerabilities, not defending against 
them. 
Option B is incorrect. Passive penetration testing refers to 
gathering information without actively interacting with the 
target systems. It’s not focused on defending against active 
threats. 
Option D is incorrect. Black box testing is a method where the 
tester has no knowledge of the internal workings of the system 
they are testing. It doesn’t describe a defensive posture. 
Question 354. During a security assessment of an application, 
Ryan found that he was able to input larger-than-expected data 
into a field. Upon doing so, he noticed the application became 
unresponsive and eventually crashed. What type of vulnerability 
might Ryan have uncovered? 
(A)       Input Validation Error 
(B)       Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
(C)       Buffer Overflow 
(D)       Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) 
Explanation 354. Correct Answer: C. Buffer Overflow. 
Buffer overflow vulnerabilities occur when an application 
allows more input data than it can securely handle in its 
allocated buffer space, leading to overwritten adjacent memory. 
This can lead to application crashes, or potentially, arbitrary 
code execution by an attacker. 
	
 
1287

Option A is incorrect. While input validation error can lead to 
various vulnerabilities, it is a broad category. In the given 
scenario, the direct consequence of entering larger than 
expected data is an application crash, which points directly to a 
buffer overflow. 
Option B is incorrect. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into 
web pages viewed by other users. It doesn’t cause application 
crashes due to oversized input. 
Option D is incorrect. Insecure Direct Object Reference 
(IDOR) vulnerabilities occur when an application provides 
direct access to objects based on user input. It does not cause 
crashes due to excessive data input. 
Question 355. A financial institution wants to ensure that if a 
cyber attacker gains unauthorized access to one section of their 
network, the attacker cannot easily move laterally to more 
sensitive parts of the network. Which method can help achieve 
this objective? 
(A)       Deploying a honeypot in every segment 
(B)       Implementing network segmentation 
(C)       Applying encryption on all data traffic 
(D)       Enabling two-factor authentication for all users 
Explanation 355. Correct Answer: B. Implementing 
network segmentation. Network segmentation divides a 
network into multiple segments or subnets. Each segment 
operates independently and can have its own security and access 
	
 
1288

controls. This means that if an attacker compromises one 
segment, they won’t necessarily have access to other segments. 
Option A is incorrect. A honeypot is a decoy system to attract 
potential attackers, but it doesn’t prevent lateral movement 
within the network once an attacker has access. 
Option C is incorrect. While encrypting data traffic ensures 
confidentiality, it doesn’t prevent lateral movement within the 
network. 
Option D is incorrect. Two-factor authentication strengthens 
access controls but doesn’t inherently stop lateral movement 
within a network if an attacker gains access. 
Question 356. Emily, an executive assistant, receives a phone 
call from an individual claiming to be a new employee in the IT 
department. The caller says they’re conducting a routine check 
and needs Emily to confirm her username and password for 
system verification. How should Emily respond? 
(A)       Politely decline and report the call to the IT 
department 
(B)       Provide the caller with the username but not the 
password 
(C)       Ask the caller to email the request, so there's a written 
record 
(D)       Hang up without saying anything 
Explanation 356. Correct Answer: A. Politely decline and 
report the call to the IT department. This is a classic example 
of a vishing (voice phishing) attempt, a form of social 
	
 
1289

engineering. The best practice in such scenarios is to never 
provide sensitive information over the phone, especially when 
the call is unsolicited. Reporting the attempt to the IT 
department can help the company be aware and potentially 
prevent further attempts. 
Option B is incorrect. Even if Emily provides only her 
username, it could still be used maliciously in combination with 
other attacks. 
Option C is incorrect. Written records can be helpful, but it’s 
crucial not to entertain or validate unsolicited requests, whether 
via email or phone. 
Option D is incorrect. While hanging up stops the immediate 
threat, it’s essential to report such incidents for broader 
organizational awareness and protection. 
Question 357. SafeNet, a financial institution, decided to 
undertake a comprehensive security assessment. They brought 
together their internal security team and an external group of 
ethical hackers. Their objective was for these teams to 
collaboratively assess vulnerabilities, perform real-time attack 
simulations, and evaluate defense mechanisms. What form of 
penetration testing is SafeNet utilizing? 
(A)       Black box testing 
(B)       Integrated penetration testing 
(C)       Defensive penetration testing 
(D)       Red team assessment 
	
 
1290

Explanation 357. Correct Answer: B. Integrated penetration 
testing. Integrated penetration testing, often associated with 
purple teaming, involves the combined efforts of both offensive 
and defensive teams to provide a holistic assessment of an 
organization’s security posture. 
Option A is incorrect. Black box testing is a method where the 
tester doesn’t have prior knowledge of the system’s architecture 
or underlying code. It doesn’t emphasize the collaborative 
nature between offensive and defensive teams. 
Option C is incorrect. Defensive penetration testing focuses on 
evaluating the defensive capabilities of an organization against 
potential attacks, without necessarily implying collaboration 
with an offensive team. 
Option D is incorrect. Red team assessment involves 
simulating real-world cyber-attacks to test an organization’s 
security posture, but it doesn’t inherently suggest a joint effort 
with a defensive team. 
Question 358. A company’s proprietary algorithm is being 
targeted by competitors aiming to replicate its functionality. To 
safeguard its intellectual property without changing the 
algorithm’s behavior, the company wants a method that 
disguises the original code structure. What should they 
implement? 
(A)       Data masking on the algorithm’s output 
(B)       Obfuscation on the algorithm's code 
(C)       Encryption of the algorithm's storage location 
	
 
1291

(D)       Implementing a hashing mechanism within the 
algorithm 
Explanation 358. Correct Answer: B. Obfuscation on the 
algorithm’s code. Obfuscating the algorithm’s code will make 
it more challenging to understand, reverse engineer, or replicate, 
without altering its behavior or results. 
Option A is incorrect. Data masking on the algorithm’s output 
would only hide or change certain parts of the output. It doesn’t 
protect or disguise the algorithm’s actual code or logic. 
Option C is incorrect. Encrypting the algorithm’s storage 
location protects the stored data from unauthorized access, but 
once accessed (e.g., for legitimate use), the original code 
structure would still be visible. 
Option D is incorrect. Implementing a hashing mechanism 
within the algorithm might change its behavior and doesn’t 
obscure the algorithm’s logic or structure. 
Question 359. AlphaTech, a leading tech manufacturer, is 
considering a penetration test to identify vulnerabilities in their 
new product’s firmware. They provide the testers with firmware 
source code, architecture diagrams, and other internal details to 
ensure a thorough evaluation. What kind of penetration test is 
AlphaTech commissioning? 
(A)       Zero-knowledge testing 
(B)       Open box testing 
(C)       Opaque testing 
(D)       Blind testing 
	
 
1292

Explanation 359. Correct Answer: B. Open box testing. 
Open box testing, similar to white box testing, is where the 
tester is given complete transparency and full details about the 
system internals, making it easier to identify vulnerabilities that 
might be missed in other forms of testing. 
Option A is incorrect. Zero-knowledge testing is another term 
for black box testing, where testers have no knowledge of the 
system internals. 
Option C is incorrect. Opaque testing is not a recognized term 
in penetration testing methodologies and is intended as a 
distractor. 
Option D is incorrect. Blind testing is a scenario where the 
testers have limited knowledge about the target system. 
Question 360. Lisa, a cybersecurity analyst, is setting up a 
centralized system to correlate logs from multiple sources, 
detect malicious activities in real-time, and produce 
comprehensive security reports. Which tool should Lisa 
consider for this purpose? 
(A)       Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) 
(B)       Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
(C)       Vulnerability Scanner 
(D)       Security Information and Event Management 
(SIEM) 
Explanation 360. Correct Answer: D. Security Information 
and Event Management (SIEM). SIEM tools are designed to 
aggregate, correlate, and analyze logs and events from various 
	
 
1293

sources in an organization. They help in detecting and 
responding to security incidents in real-time and generating 
detailed security reports. 
Option A is incorrect. While NIDS monitors and analyzes 
network traffic for signs of malicious activities, it doesn’t 
provide centralized logging and reporting functionalities like a 
SIEM. 
Option B is incorrect. A Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
protects web applications from web-based attacks. It does not 
offer the centralized log correlation and analysis features of a 
SIEM. 
Option C is incorrect. A Vulnerability Scanner identifies 
vulnerabilities in systems and applications but doesn’t aggregate 
and analyze logs from various sources. 
Question 361. WebMasters LLC, a popular web hosting 
company, wants to ensure the robust security of their hosted 
websites. They initiate a security challenge, inviting ethical 
hackers worldwide to find vulnerabilities without giving any 
details about their servers, databases, or applications. Which 
penetration testing method is WebMasters LLC utilizing? 
(A)       External testing 
(B)       Grey box testing 
(C)       Active testing 
(D)       Black box testing 
Explanation 361. Correct Answer: D. Black box testing. In 
black box testing, the testers are not provided with any 
	
 
1294

knowledge about the system’s internals and have to identify 
vulnerabilities based purely on their own discoveries. 
WebMasters LLC’s approach, where they don’t disclose any 
specifics to the ethical hackers, resonates with this method. 
Option A is incorrect. While the challenge by WebMasters 
LLC can be externally focused, external testing alone doesn’t 
define the level of knowledge provided to the testers. 
Option B is incorrect. In grey box testing, testers would have 
some knowledge about the target, which is not the case here. 
Option C is incorrect. Active testing simply means testers are 
directly interacting with the system, but it doesn’t specify the 
amount of knowledge they have about its internals. 
Question 362. After an annual review, BestTech Co. realized 
that their IT team was unfamiliar with the protocols to follow 
during a data breach. To ensure the team understands the steps 
and decision points without launching a live drill, what should 
the company implement? 
(A)       Upgrade their firewall systems 
(B)       Engage in a tabletop exercise 
(C)       Conduct a red team exercise 
(D)       Implement multi-factor authentication for all users 
Explanation 62. Correct Answer: B. Engage in a tabletop 
exercise. Tabletop exercises allow teams to discuss and review 
specific scenarios, such as a data breach, and ensure everyone 
understands their roles and the processes to follow. It’s a cost-
effective way to familiarize the team with response procedures. 
	
 
1295

Option A is incorrect. Upgrading firewall systems may 
enhance the company’s security posture but doesn’t familiarize 
the IT team with data breach response protocols. 
Option C is incorrect. A red team exercise is a live simulated 
attack to evaluate the organization’s security posture and does 
not focus on walking the team through the response steps in a 
controlled environment. 
Option D is incorrect. Multi-factor authentication is a security 
measure to validate users’ identities but does not address the 
team’s unfamiliarity with data breach response protocols. 
Question 363. A medium-sized organization recently had a 
third-party auditor review their information security controls. 
After the review, the auditor provided a formal statement that 
verified the effectiveness of the controls in place. What is this 
formal statement referred to as? 
(A)       Certification 
(B)       Accreditation 
(C)       Attestation 
(D)       Assurance 
Explanation 363. Correct Answer: C. Attestation. An 
attestation is a formal statement or declaration by a subject 
matter expert, like an auditor, attesting that specific criteria are 
met. In this case, the auditor is attesting to the effectiveness of 
the information security controls. 
Option A is incorrect. Certification is the process of providing 
someone or something with an official document attesting to a 
	
 
1296

status or level of achievement, which may or may not involve 
testing against certain standards. 
Option B is incorrect. Accreditation is the formal recognition 
that a body or individual is competent to perform specific tasks, 
usually granted by a higher authority or body. 
Option D is incorrect. Assurance refers to the measures taken 
to gain confidence in the security of a system, but it’s not a 
formal declaration like an attestation. 
Question 364. In preparation for an upcoming audit, AlphaTech 
Corporation hires a team to evaluate their security measures. 
The team is spotted attempting to bypass security barriers, 
unlock doors without keys, and trying to access restricted floors 
by pretending to be maintenance staff. What type of testing is 
AlphaTech Corporation undergoing? 
(A)       Network vulnerability scanning 
(B)       Physical penetration testing 
(C)       OS fingerprinting 
(D)       Source code review 
Explanation 364. Correct Answer: B. Physical penetration 
testing. Physical penetration testing involves hands-on 
techniques to breach physical barriers, such as locks, security 
checkpoints, or restricted areas, to assess the efficacy of 
physical security controls. 
Option A is incorrect. Network vulnerability scanning is about 
identifying vulnerabilities in networked systems through 
automated tools, not physical barriers. 
	
 
1297

Option C is incorrect. OS fingerprinting identifies the 
operating system of a remote computer. It doesn’t involve 
physically trying to access restricted areas. 
Option D is incorrect. Source code review evaluates the source 
code of applications for vulnerabilities and doesn’t concern 
physical access controls. 
Question 365.. WebSoft Inc., a leading software company, 
recently launched a new web application. Before making it live, 
they engaged a security firm to challenge the application, find 
vulnerabilities, and exploit them as real hackers would. This 
aggressive testing is done to ensure maximum security. What 
kind of penetration testing is WebSoft Inc. opting for? 
(A)       White box testing 
(B)       Defensive penetration testing 
(C)       Offensive penetration testing 
(D)       Gray box testing 
Explanation 365. Correct Answer: C. Offensive penetration 
testing. Offensive penetration testing is an aggressive form of 
testing where the tester actively attempts to find and exploit 
vulnerabilities in the target system or application, much like a 
real attacker. 
Option A is incorrect. White box testing, also known as clear 
box testing, involves having full visibility and knowledge of the 
internal workings of the application being tested. The focus is 
more on the methodology and not the aggressive nature of the 
testing. 
	
 
1298

Option B is incorrect. There is no specific testing method 
called “defensive penetration testing.” Defensive strategies are 
typically associated with blue team activities that focus on 
defending systems, not aggressively testing them. 
Option D is incorrect. Gray box testing is a combination of 
both white box and black box testing methods. Testers have 
some knowledge of the internal workings but not complete 
information. The emphasis here is on the level of knowledge of 
the system and not on the aggressive nature of the testing. 
Question 366. After a series of high-profile data breaches in the 
industry, OnlineRetail Corp., an e-commerce platform, wishes 
to undergo an external review to validate the security of its 
operations and provide a comprehensive report to its 
shareholders. Which type of assessment will provide a detailed 
and formalized examination of their security posture? 
(A)       External examination of IT controls and operations 
(B)       Internal review of security protocols 
(C)       External regulatory audit on financial statements 
(D)       Informal feedback from industry peers 
Explanation 366. Correct Answer: A. External examination 
of IT controls and operations. An external examination of IT 
controls and operations provides a deep and structured 
assessment of an organization’s security posture and IT 
operations. Conducted by external experts, it can provide 
formalized, comprehensive findings to reassure shareholders of 
the company’s security measures. 
	
 
1299

Option B is incorrect. An internal review is conducted by the 
organization’s own personnel and may lack the independent 
perspective and comprehensive scope of an external 
examination. 
Option C is incorrect. An external regulatory audit on financial 
statements focuses on financial reporting and not on the security 
of IT operations. 
Option D is incorrect. Informal feedback, while potentially 
useful, does not offer the structured, comprehensive, and 
independent insights that an external examination provides. 
Question 367. XYZ Ltd. wants to evaluate if their current 
security measures are consistent with industry-specific 
regulations they are required to follow. The evaluation should 
be done by their own IT department before inviting external 
auditors. Which approach should XYZ Ltd. adopt? 
(A)       Third-party vulnerability scanning 
(B)       Internal compliance assessment 
(C)       External attestation 
(D)       Vendor risk assessment 
Explanation 367. Correct Answer: B. Internal compliance 
assessment. An internal compliance assessment is conducted by 
an organization’s internal teams to evaluate if their operations, 
processes, and configurations are in alignment with required 
compliance standards or regulations. This helps in proactively 
identifying and rectifying non-compliance before an external 
audit. 
	
 
1300

Option A is incorrect. Third-party vulnerability scanning 
focuses on identifying vulnerabilities and doesn’t necessarily 
check for compliance with industry-specific regulations. 
Option C is incorrect. External attestation is a formal 
statement from an external party verifying specific criteria. This 
would not be done by the company’s internal IT department. 
Option D is incorrect. Vendor risk assessment focuses on 
assessing the security risks associated with third-party vendors 
and doesn’t evaluate an organization’s internal compliance with 
regulations. 
Question 368. SafeNet Banking Corporation is keen on gaining 
a competitive edge in the market by demonstrating its 
commitment to cybersecurity. They want an official attestation 
that their cybersecurity measures are robust and compliant with 
industry standards. What should SafeNet opt for to obtain this 
attestation? 
(A)       Feedback from customers on the bank's app security 
(B)       Internal IT team's report on cybersecurity practices 
(C)       External independent third-party audit 
(D)       Informal evaluation by a cybersecurity consultancy 
Explanation 368. Correct Answer: C. External independent 
third-party audit. An external independent third-party audit 
can provide an official attestation regarding SafeNet Banking 
Corporation’s adherence to industry standards in cybersecurity. 
By having an external entity evaluate their practices, SafeNet 
can assure stakeholders of its commitment to cybersecurity. 
	
 
1301

Option A is incorrect. While feedback from customers is 
valuable, it is not an official or comprehensive assessment of 
the bank’s entire cybersecurity practices. 
Option B is incorrect. An internal IT team’s report might lack 
the external perspective and official attestation that a third-party 
audit can provide. 
Option D is incorrect. An informal evaluation, even by a 
cybersecurity consultancy, might not be as rigorous or 
recognized as an official third-party audit. 
Question 369. The company’s security administrator observes 
that there are multiple unauthorized access attempts originating 
from IP addresses in a specific range. The administrator wants 
to prevent these IP addresses from accessing the corporate 
network temporarily. Which of the following firewall 
configurations would BEST address this requirement? 
(A)       Configure an implicit deny rule for the specific IP 
range 
(B)       Set up a honeypot for the specific IP range 
(C)       Allow the IP range but set a bandwidth limit 
(D)       Add the IP range to a whitelist 
Explanation 369. Correct Answer: A. Configure an implicit 
deny rule for the specific IP range. By configuring an implicit 
deny rule for that specific IP range, the firewall will block any 
traffic from those addresses, preventing them from accessing 
the network. 
	
 
1302

Option B is incorrect. While a honeypot can be used to 
monitor and analyze attacker behavior, it does not block the 
access of the specified IP range to the corporate network. 
Option C is incorrect. Allowing the IP range and setting a 
bandwidth limit would not prevent access; it would only restrict 
the amount of data they could send/receive. 
Option D is incorrect. Adding the IP range to a whitelist would 
grant them access, which is opposite to the required action. 
Question 370. Lisa, a security administrator, is using a popular 
benchmark to ensure the web servers in her organization are 
configured securely. She wants to make sure that unnecessary 
services are disabled, and appropriate permissions are set. 
Which of the following organizations is MOST likely the source 
of the benchmark she is using? 
(A)       PCI DSS 
(B)       OWASP 
(C)       CIS 
(D)       GDPR 
Explanation 370. Correct Answer: C. CIS. The Center for 
Internet Security (CIS) is known for its CIS Benchmarks, which 
provide prescriptive guidance for configuring systems securely. 
Option A is incorrect. PCI DSS is a set of security standards 
designed to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, 
or transmit credit card information maintain a secure 
environment. 
	
 
1303

Option B is incorrect. OWASP (Open Web Application 
Security Project) is known for its top ten list of web application 
vulnerabilities and not for system configuration benchmarks. 
Option D is incorrect. GDPR (General Data Protection 
Regulation) is a regulation that requires businesses to protect 
the personal data and privacy of EU citizens. It doesn’t provide 
benchmarks for secure system configurations. 
Question 371. ZenTech, a multinational corporation, recently 
adopted a multi-cloud strategy, deploying workloads across 
multiple cloud service providers. What is a primary security 
benefit of this approach? 
(A)       Centralized management of all cloud resources 
(B)       Automatic encryption of data in transit between clouds 
(C)       Mitigation against a single point of failure 
(D)       Reduction in the cost of cloud storage solutions 
Explanation 371. Correct Answer: C. Mitigation against a 
single point of failure. Using a multi-cloud strategy distributes 
workloads across various cloud providers, which reduces the 
risk associated with outages or security breaches in any one 
provider. This diversification ensures that a failure or 
compromise in one cloud environment doesn’t jeopardize the 
entire infrastructure. 
Option A is incorrect. Multi-cloud strategies can sometimes 
complicate management due to the need to interface with 
different platforms and providers. Centralization isn’t the 
primary benefit in this context. 
	
 
1304

Option B is incorrect. While encryption is crucial, adopting a 
multi-cloud approach doesn’t automatically encrypt data in 
transit between different cloud environments. This would 
require specific configurations and solutions. 
Option D is incorrect. While cost optimization can be a factor 
in adopting a multi-cloud strategy, the primary security 
advantage is not related to cost reduction. 
Question 372. A company wants to host a public-facing website 
but ensure that even if the website gets compromised, attackers 
cannot gain access to sensitive internal data. Which of the 
following is the BEST configuration to achieve this? 
(A)       Place the web server on the internal network and strictly 
monitor the traffic 
(B)       Place the web server in the DMZ with a firewall in 
front of it and another firewall between the DMZ and the 
internal network 
(C)       Directly connect the web server to the internet without a 
firewall and move sensitive data off the server 
(D)       Place the web server in the DMZ and connect it directly 
to the internal network without a firewall 
Explanation 372. Correct Answer: B. Place the web server 
in the DMZ with a firewall in front of it and another firewall 
between the DMZ and the internal network. By placing the 
web server in a DMZ, and having two firewalls (one facing the 
internet and another facing the internal network), the company 
can ensure that even if the public-facing web server is 
compromised, the attacker would still need to bypass another 
firewall to reach the internal network. 
	
 
1305

Option A is incorrect. Placing a public-facing web server on 
the internal network, even with monitoring, exposes the 
network to unnecessary risks. 
Option C is incorrect. Connecting a server directly to the 
internet without any form of firewall is highly risky, even if 
sensitive data is moved. 
Option D is incorrect. Without a firewall between the DMZ 
and the internal network, it becomes much easier for a 
compromised server in the DMZ to impact or access the internal 
network. 
Question 373. TechFirm Inc. collects personal data from its 
users and decides on the purposes and means of processing this 
data. They also outsource data storage to CloudData, a third-
party company. In the context of data privacy regulations, how 
would TechFirm and CloudData be classified respectively? 
((A)       TechFirm: Processor; CloudData: Controller 
(B)       TechFirm: Controller; CloudData: Processor 
(C)       Both TechFirm and CloudData: Processors 
(D)       Both TechFirm and CloudData: Controllers 
Explanation 373. Correct Answer: B. TechFirm: Controller; 
CloudData: Processor. TechFirm Inc., which decides on the 
purposes and means of processing personal data, is the 
“Controller”. CloudData, which is responsible for processing 
data on behalf of TechFirm (without deciding on its use), is the 
“Processor”. 
	
 
1306

Option A is incorrect. The roles are reversed in this option. 
TechFirm is the one making decisions on data use, so it’s the 
Controller. 
Option C is incorrect. Both entities have different roles in this 
scenario. TechFirm is not just processing; it’s deciding on how 
the data should be used, making it a Controller. 
Option D is incorrect. CloudData does not decide on the 
purpose and means of the data processing. It simply processes 
data on behalf of TechFirm, making it a Processor. 
Question 374. The IT department of Globex Corp is concerned 
about the increasing number of malicious websites being 
accessed from company laptops while employees are working 
remotely. They want to ensure that the web filter policies set in 
the corporate network are enforced even when devices are 
offsite. What would be the BEST solution to address this 
concern? 
(A)       Implement a cloud-based web filtering solution 
(B)       Use a VPN to force all remote traffic through the 
corporate network 
(C)       Deploy an agent-based web filter on all company 
laptops 
(D)       Periodically send reminders to employees about 
acceptable web usage 
Explanation 374. Correct Answer: C. Deploy an agent-based 
web filter on all company laptops. Agent-based web filters 
can enforce web filtering policies on a device regardless of its 
	
 
1307

location. This ensures that the policies apply consistently 
whether the device is on or off the corporate network. 
Option A is incorrect. While cloud-based solutions can offer 
offsite filtering, they might not be as consistent as an agent-
based solution that directly enforces corporate policies on the 
device itself. 
Option B is incorrect. Using a VPN would force all traffic 
through the corporate network, which could cause latency and 
might not be feasible for all remote work scenarios. 
Option D is incorrect. Sending reminders is a passive approach 
and may not effectively prevent access to malicious websites. 
Question 375. SoftTech Solutions is a software development 
company that has decided to conduct a penetration test on their 
new web application. The testers are provided with user 
credentials, network topology diagrams, and some proprietary 
software code snippets. Which type of penetration testing is 
SoftTech Solutions employing? 
(A)       Black box testing 
(B)       Double-blind testing 
(C)       Known environment testing 
(D)       Zero-knowledge testing 
Explanation 375. Correct Answer: C. Known environment 
testing. Known environment testing is a type of penetration 
testing where the testers are given certain information about the 
target’s environment. This can include user credentials, network 
	
 
1308

diagrams, and more, to mimic a potential insider threat or a 
threat actor who has gained certain internal information. 
Option A is incorrect. In black box testing, testers are given no 
prior knowledge about the system. 
Option B is incorrect. In double-blind testing, neither the 
attackers nor the defenders have prior knowledge of the 
impending test. 
Option D is incorrect. Zero-knowledge testing is another term 
for black box testing, where the testers have no knowledge of 
the system internals. 
Question 376. DeltaTech, a financial institution, operates its 
primary site on a UNIX-based platform. For disaster recovery 
purposes, they are considering setting up a backup site on a 
different platform. Which of the following is NOT a primary 
benefit of introducing platform diversity in this case? 
(A)       It reduces the organization's learning curve by using 
familiar technologies 
(B)       It provides resilience against attacks targeting UNIX-
based systems 
(C)       It ensures that platform-specific outages don't affect 
both primary and backup sites 
(D)       It diversifies the attack surface, reducing the impact of 
specific platform vulnerabilities 
Explanation 376. Correct Answer: A. It reduces the 
organization’s learning curve by using familiar technologies. 
Introducing a new platform usually increases the learning curve 
	
 
1309

as staff need to be trained on the new system. The primary 
benefits of platform diversity are resilience, redundancy, and 
diversifying the attack surface. 
Option B is incorrect. This is one of the benefits of platform 
diversity. If a vulnerability or threat targets UNIX-based 
systems, having a backup on a different platform ensures that 
the backup isn’t compromised by the same threat. 
Option C is incorrect. This is a benefit of platform diversity. 
Platform-specific outages or issues would only affect systems 
on that platform, so having a backup on a different platform 
adds resilience. 
Question 377. After a recent security incident, Sarah, a network 
security analyst, wants to analyze the flow data of network 
traffic to identify patterns and potential threats. She wants to 
collect metadata about IP traffic flow and gather details like IP 
addresses, ports, and protocols used. Which tool should Sarah 
employ to obtain this information? 
(A)       Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
(B)       Syslog server 
(C)       NetFlow collector 
(D)       Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) traps 
Explanation 377. Correct Answer: C. NetFlow collector. 
NetFlow is a network protocol developed by Cisco for 
collecting IP traffic information and monitoring network traffic. 
A NetFlow collector can provide insights into traffic flow 
patterns and volume, making it suitable for Sarah’s 
requirements. 
	
 
1310

Option A is incorrect. While an IDS can provide alerts on 
malicious activities based on specific signatures or heuristics, it 
does not provide detailed flow data analysis like NetFlow. 
Option B is incorrect. A Syslog server is mainly used for 
collecting and storing log data from various devices. It does not 
focus on detailed network traffic flow like NetFlow. 
Option D is incorrect. SNMP traps are for sending unsolicited 
alert messages from a device to a management station regarding 
specific events. They don’t provide traffic flow analysis. 
Question 378. A large financial institution recently experienced 
a security breach where an attacker was able to bypass its 
intrusion detection system (IDS). Upon investigation, the 
security team found out that the attacker utilized a zero-day 
exploit. In the aftermath, what should the institution do to 
enhance the capability of its IDS? 
(A)       Switch from a signature-based IDS to a behavior-
based IDS 
(B)       Disable the IDS and rely solely on firewall rules 
(C)       Update the IDS with the latest threat intelligence feeds 
and signatures 
(D)       Reduce the frequency of IDS signature updates 
Explanation 378. Correct Answer: A. Switch from a 
signature-based IDS to a behavior-based IDS. Behavior-
based IDS (or anomaly-based IDS) monitors network traffic and 
compares it against an established baseline, allowing it to 
potentially detect zero-day exploits and other novel attacks that 
signature-based systems might miss. 
	
 
1311

Option B is incorrect. Relying solely on firewall rules without 
IDS would lessen the security depth and expose the institution 
to more risks. 
Option C is incorrect. While updating the IDS with the latest 
signatures is important, it wouldn’t necessarily detect zero-day 
exploits until a signature for that exploit has been created and 
disseminated. 
Option D is incorrect. Reducing the frequency of IDS 
signature updates would make the system even more vulnerable 
to recent threats. 
Question 379. After a major power outage, TechWave Corp. 
wants to ensure their primary data center’s operations can be 
swiftly and seamlessly shifted to another facility. The company 
wants this process to be automated and immediate to prevent 
any service interruption. What type of test should TechWave 
Corp. conduct to validate this functionality? 
(A)       Conduct a vulnerability assessment on both data centers 
(B)       Execute a failover test 
(C)       Engage in a tabletop exercise 
(D)       Perform a routine backup test 
Explanation 379. Correct Answer: B. Execute a failover test. 
A failover test involves simulating a failure in the primary 
system to ensure that the backup system can seamlessly take 
over without any service interruption. It helps in verifying the 
resilience and recovery capabilities of an organization’s 
infrastructure. 
	
 
1312

Option A is incorrect. A vulnerability assessment identifies 
potential weaknesses in systems but does not test the seamless 
transition between primary and backup systems. 
Option C is incorrect. A tabletop exercise is a discussion-based 
session and does not involve the live testing of systems or 
processes. 
Option D is incorrect. A routine backup test ensures that 
backups can be restored successfully but does not test the 
immediate switchover capability between systems. 
Question 380. Sarah, a security administrator, is implementing 
a monitoring solution for her organization’s server 
infrastructure. She wants a solution that does not require any 
additional software to be installed on the servers themselves. 
Which type of monitoring approach should Sarah choose? 
(A)       Agent-based monitoring 
(B)       Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
(C)       Agentless monitoring 
(D)       Network-based Application Performance Monitoring 
(APM) 
Explanation 380. Correct Answer: C. Agentless monitoring. 
Agentless monitoring solutions do not require any software 
agents to be installed on the servers they monitor. They 
typically rely on standard protocols and interfaces to collect 
performance and other data. 
	
 
1313

Option A is incorrect. Agent-based monitoring requires the 
installation of software agents on each server or device that is to 
be monitored. 
Option B is incorrect. While an Intrusion Detection System 
(IDS) is a security tool, it is not specifically designed for 
agentless infrastructure monitoring. 
Option D is incorrect. Network-based Application 
Performance Monitoring (APM) is focused on monitoring 
application performance on the network, not on agentless server 
monitoring. 
Question 381. Alice, a cybersecurity analyst, is tasked with 
identifying potential weaknesses in a newly deployed web 
application’s infrastructure before it goes live. She wants a tool 
that can proactively discover and report on system 
vulnerabilities, missing patches, and misconfigurations. Which 
of the following should Alice utilize for this purpose? 
(A)       Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
(B)       Network sniffer 
(C)       Vulnerability scanner 
(D)       Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) 
system.  
Explanation 381. Correct Answer: C. Vulnerability scanner. 
Vulnerability scanners are designed to discover and report 
potential vulnerabilities in systems by probing and analyzing 
them. They can detect issues such as missing patches, 
misconfigurations, and known software flaws. 
	
 
1314

Option A is incorrect. An IDS detects and alerts on potential 
malicious activities based on specific signatures or heuristics 
but does not proactively scan for vulnerabilities. 
Option B is incorrect. A network sniffer captures and analyzes 
network traffic but does not perform vulnerability assessments 
on infrastructure components. 
Option D is incorrect. While a SIEM system can aggregate and 
analyze log and event data from various sources, it does not 
proactively scan for vulnerabilities like a vulnerability scanner  
Question 382. After conducting a business impact analysis, a 
local library determined that they could afford several days of 
downtime without a significant impact on their operations. They 
want a disaster recovery solution that offers a balance between 
cost and recovery capabilities. Which site consideration is the 
most suitable for the library’s needs? 
(A)       Mobile site with a full set of IT equipment 
(B)       Hot site with daily data replication 
(C)       Cold site 
(D)       Warm site with weekly backups 
Explanation 382. Correct Answer: C. Cold site. A cold site is 
an offsite facility that is pre-configured to accept equipment and 
data backups but doesn’t have any of its own. Given the 
library’s tolerance for several days of downtime, a cold site 
would be a cost-effective solution that aligns with their recovery 
capabilities. 
	
 
1315

Option A is incorrect. A mobile site with a full set of IT 
equipment would be more suitable for immediate recovery 
needs and might be overkill for a library that can tolerate 
several days of downtime. 
Option B is incorrect. A hot site with daily data replication 
would be more suited for businesses with a low tolerance for 
downtime and would likely be more expensive than the library’s 
budget allows. 
Option D is incorrect. Even though a warm site with weekly 
backups might seem like a viable option, a cold site would still 
be more cost-effective for the library given their tolerance for 
downtime. 
Question 383. After a recent security incident in the 
organization, the IT team noticed that several legitimate 
activities were being flagged by the intrusion detection system, 
resulting in a high number of false positives. What is the MOST 
appropriate action to improve the system’s accuracy and reduce 
unnecessary alerts? 
(A)       Disable the intrusion detection system for a week to 
observe regular network traffic patterns 
(B)       Set up a stricter firewall rule to block all external traffic 
(C)       Implement alert tuning to refine the system's 
detection criteria 
(D)       Encourage employees to reduce their internet usage 
Explanation 383. Correct Answer: C. Implement alert 
tuning to refine the system’s detection criteria. Alert tuning 
involves adjusting the detection rules or criteria of a system to 
	
 
1316

better differentiate between legitimate and malicious activities, 
thereby reducing false positives. 
Option A is incorrect. Disabling the intrusion detection system 
can expose the organization to real threats, making it a risky 
approach. 
Option B is incorrect. Setting up stricter firewall rules doesn’t 
directly address the issue of false positives from the intrusion 
detection system and could block legitimate business 
operations. 
Option D is incorrect. Reducing internet usage does not 
necessarily correlate with a decrease in false positives. The 
issue lies with the system’s criteria, not the amount of traffic. 
Question 384. Amy, a network administrator, is researching 
tools to assist with automating the evaluation of her 
organization’s systems against a specific security baseline. She 
comes across SCAP and wants to implement it. Which of the 
following BEST describes the primary function of the Security 
Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)? 
Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)? 
(A)       To facilitate the real-time transfer of threat intelligence 
feeds 
(B)       To provide an interface for user authentication against 
Active Directory 
(C)       To allow for automated vulnerability management 
and policy compliance evaluation 
(D)       To offer encrypted communication channels for remote 
system management 
	
 
1317

Explanation 384. Correct Answer: C. To allow for 
automated vulnerability management and policy compliance 
evaluation. SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) is a 
suite of open standards that enhances the ability of 
organizations to automate vulnerability management, 
measurement, and policy compliance evaluation on systems. 
Option A is incorrect. While threat intelligence is crucial for 
security, SCAP is not designed primarily for real-time threat 
intelligence feed transfers. 
Option B is incorrect. SCAP does not directly deal with user 
authentication against any directory services. 
Option D is incorrect. SCAP’s primary function isn’t to offer 
encrypted communication channels for remote system 
management. Other protocols and tools serve this purpose. 
Question 385. A financial institution wants to ensure that any 
unauthorized access to customer data triggers an immediate 
alert to the security team. Which of the following approaches 
would be the MOST effective in achieving this requirement? 
(A)       Configure alerts for any modification to database 
records 
(B)       Set up alerts for successful logins during off-business 
hours 
(C)       Establish alerting thresholds based on anomalous 
user behavior 
(D)       Send daily reports of all access attempts to the security 
team for review 
	
 
1318

Explanation 385. Correct Answer: C. Establish alerting 
thresholds based on anomalous user behavior. By setting 
alerting thresholds based on anomalous behavior, the system 
can detect unauthorized access based on patterns that deviate 
from typical user behavior, providing timely alerts for potential 
breaches. 
Option A is incorrect. Configuring alerts for any modification 
to database records may generate a high number of false 
positives, especially in a dynamic environment like a financial 
institution where legitimate changes occur regularly. 
Option B is incorrect. While setting up alerts for off-hours 
access can catch some unauthorized attempts, it might miss 
breaches occurring during business hours. 
Option D is incorrect. Daily reports may delay the detection 
and response to unauthorized access, as it doesn’t offer real-
time alerting. 
Question 386. After the recent cyber-attack on Acme Corp, the 
IT security team decided to enhance their proactive defense 
mechanism. They want to start with identifying unpatched and 
vulnerable systems on their network. Which of the following 
scanning activities would BEST assist them in this endeavor? 
(A)       Conducting a passive scan during business hours 
(B)       Implementing a full open port scan on all systems 
(C)       Running a credentialed vulnerability scan on their 
network 
(D)       Scanning the external perimeter for domain name 
resolutions 
	
 
1319

Explanation 386. Correct Answer: C. Running a 
credentialed vulnerability scan on their network. A 
credentialed vulnerability scan uses valid user credentials to 
access and scan the target system, allowing for a deeper and 
more comprehensive check for vulnerabilities, including 
unpatched systems. 
Option A is incorrect. A passive scan is non-intrusive and only 
monitors network traffic, limiting its capability to identify 
unpatched systems actively. 
Option B is incorrect. While a full open port scan can identify 
open ports, it doesn’t necessarily identify unpatched systems or 
specific vulnerabilities. 
Option D is incorrect. Scanning the external perimeter for 
domain name resolutions can help in gathering information 
about domain names but won’t directly assist in identifying 
unpatched systems. 
Question 387. A healthcare provider wants to evaluate the 
security of their patient portal. They inform the penetration 
testers about the technologies used, such as the programming 
languages and databases. However, specifics about the security 
measures in place, including intrusion detection systems, are 
kept secret. What kind of penetration test are they aiming for? 
(A)       White box testing 
(B)       External testing 
(C)       Grey box testing 
(D)       Active testing  
	
 
1320

Explanation 387. Correct Answer: C. Grey box testing. Grey 
box testing implies that testers have some knowledge about the 
target but not all details. Here, the healthcare provider gives 
details about the technologies used but keeps information about 
the security measures a secret. This partial disclosure aligns 
with grey box testing methodology. 
Option A is incorrect. In white box testing, testers would have 
a complete overview of the system, including its code, 
configurations, and security measures. 
Option B is incorrect. External testing primarily focuses on the 
system’s exterior defenses, like firewall configurations, without 
consideration of what details are shared with the testers. 
Option D is incorrect. Active testing means testers are directly 
interacting with the system and is not indicative of the level of 
knowledge they possess about the system’s internals. 
Question 388. Sarah, a sales manager at TechWorld Inc., 
receives an email from her bank urging her to update her 
account details due to a recent security breach. The email 
provides a link to a website that looks almost identical to her 
bank’s official site. However, she notices a slight misspelling in 
the URL. What should Sarah do next? 
(A)       Forward the email to her colleagues as a warning 
(B)       Click the link and update her details as the bank's site is 
probably just undergoing updates 
(C)       Delete the email without taking any action 
(D)       Report the email to her company's IT department 
and avoid clicking any links  
	
 
1321

Explanation 388. Correct Answer: D. Report the email to 
her company’s IT department and avoid clicking any links. 
Sarah likely received a phishing email, a common tactic used by 
attackers to deceive users into providing sensitive information. 
The best course of action is to report the suspicious email to the 
IT department so they can take necessary precautions and notify 
other employees. 
Option A is incorrect. While Sarah has the right instinct to 
warn others, forwarding potentially malicious emails can lead to 
more risks. It’s better to alert the IT department. 
Option B is incorrect. Clicking on links in suspicious emails, 
especially with a misspelled URL, can lead to compromised 
personal and company data. 
Option C is incorrect. Simply deleting the email doesn’t 
address the broader risk to the organization. Reporting such 
incidents helps the company bolster its defenses. 
Question 389. Paul, a network administrator, has configured 
various networking devices in his organization to send alerts in 
the event of specific failures. After a switch experienced a 
power supply failure, Paul received an immediate notification. 
Which of the following did Paul most likely utilize to receive 
this notification? 
(A)       Syslog server 
(B)       Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) 
traps 
(C)       Packet sniffer 
(D)       Firewall logs  
	
 
1322

Explanation 389. Correct Answer: B. Simple Network 
Management Protocol (SNMP) traps. SNMP traps are 
unsolicited alert messages sent by a device to notify an SNMP 
management station of specific events. In this case, the switch 
sent an SNMP trap to Paul when it detected the power supply 
failure. 
Option A is incorrect. While a Syslog server can be used to 
collect logs from various devices, it doesn’t proactively send 
alerts based on specific events like an SNMP trap does. 
Option C is incorrect. A packet sniffer captures and analyzes 
network traffic but doesn’t actively alert administrators to 
specific device events. 
Option D is incorrect. Firewall logs are specific to firewalls 
and track traffic that passes through the firewall, but they don’t 
typically send unsolicited alerts about network device health. 
Question 390. Samantha, a security analyst, has been tasked 
with creating a monthly report for senior management detailing 
the security posture of the company. Which of the following is 
the MOST important element to include to ensure the report 
effectively communicates the company’s current security status? 
(A)       Detailed technical logs of all security incidents 
(B)       Graphical representation of incidents by category 
(C)       A complete list of all users and their access levels 
(D)       Copies of recent phishing emails for demonstration 
Explanation 390. Correct Answer: B. Graphical 
representation of incidents by category. A graphical 
	
 
1323

representation by category allows senior management to quickly 
understand the types and frequency of security incidents, which 
can help in decision-making and resource allocation. 
Option A is incorrect. While technical logs are crucial for 
incident analysis, they may be too detailed and technical for a 
senior management report. 
Option C is incorrect. While it’s essential to manage user 
access levels, a complete list of all users and their access might 
be excessive for a monthly senior management report focused 
on the company’s security posture. 
Option D is incorrect. While examples of phishing emails can 
be educational, they are not crucial for a monthly report meant 
to provide an overview of the company’s security status. 
Question 391. A software developer in a company notices that a 
legitimate software tool they use is repeatedly flagged and 
quarantined by the company’s security solution. Which of the 
following is the BEST action the cybersecurity team can take to 
address this without compromising security? 
(A)       Turn off the antivirus solution 
(B)       Whitelist the software tool in the antivirus settings 
(C)       Decrease the security level of the antivirus 
(D)       Install a different antivirus solution 
Explanation 391. Correct Answer: B. Whitelist the software 
tool in the antivirus settings. Whitelisting allows the 
cybersecurity team to specify software or applications that are 
	
 
1324

considered safe and should not be flagged or quarantined by the 
antivirus solution. 
Option A is incorrect. Turning off the antivirus solution would 
leave the system vulnerable to malware and other malicious 
threats. 
Option C is incorrect. Decreasing the security level of the 
antivirus might reduce its effectiveness in detecting and 
blocking genuine threats. 
Option D is incorrect. Simply installing a different antivirus 
solution does not guarantee that the tool won’t be flagged again, 
and frequent switches can also be costly and time-consuming. 
Question 392. Lucy, the IT security manager of a financial 
company, receives an automated alert that an employee 
attempted to email a document containing social security 
numbers to an external email address. Which of the following 
tools most likely generated this alert? 
(A)       Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) 
(B)       Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solution 
(C)       Vulnerability Scanner 
(D)       Packet Analyzer 
Explanation 392. Correct Answer: B. Data Loss Prevention 
(DLP) solution. DLP solutions are specifically designed to 
monitor and control data transfers across an organization’s 
network. In this case, the DLP detected sensitive data—social 
security numbers—being sent outside of the organization and 
alerted Lucy. 
	
 
1325

Option A is incorrect. NIDS detects and alerts on malicious 
activity on a network, but it doesn’t typically scan for specific 
data types being transferred. 
Option C is incorrect. Vulnerability scanners identify and 
report on vulnerabilities in a system but don’t monitor data 
transfers. 
Option D is incorrect. While packet analyzers can capture and 
analyze network traffic, they don’t inherently generate alerts 
based on the specific content of data being transferred. 
Question 393. A healthcare organization with patients 
worldwide is planning to set up a backup site for its medical 
data repository. They have been advised to consider geographic 
dispersion as part of their disaster recovery plan. Which of the 
following reasons is the LEAST valid for geographic dispersion 
in this scenario? 
(A)       Mitigate risks of regional natural disasters 
(B)       Offer redundancy in case of local power outages 
(C)       Benefit from varying peak load times in different 
regions 
(D)       Ensure faster access speeds for global patients 
Explanation 393. Correct Answer: D. Ensure faster access 
speeds for global patients. Geographic dispersion’s primary 
goal in a disaster recovery context is resilience and redundancy, 
not necessarily optimizing access speeds. While having servers 
in different locations can enhance speed for local users, in the 
context of a backup site for disaster recovery, the primary focus 
is on availability and redundancy, not speed. 
	
 
1326

Option A is incorrect. Geographic dispersion can help mitigate 
risks associated with regional natural disasters by ensuring that 
backup sites aren’t impacted by the same disaster that affects 
the primary site. 
Option B is incorrect. Regional power outages can be 
mitigated by having backup sites in different locations. 
Option C is incorrect. Geographic dispersion can allow 
organizations to manage and distribute load more effectively by 
leveraging off-peak times in different regions. 
Question 394. TechCo, a medium-sized enterprise, is planning 
to implement a solution to monitor, control, and restrict web 
access for its employees to improve productivity and enhance 
security. They also want to cache frequently accessed web 
content to reduce bandwidth consumption. Which solution 
would BEST fit TechCo’s requirements? 
(A)       Deploy a decentralized proxy on each departmental 
network 
(B)       Set up a DNS-based filtering service 
(C)       Use a centralized proxy with caching capabilities 
(D)       Recommend browser extensions for web filtering to all 
employees 
Explanation 394. Correct Answer: C. Use a centralized 
proxy with caching capabilities. A centralized proxy allows 
organizations to filter, monitor, and control web access from a 
central point. Additionally, proxies with caching capabilities can 
store frequently accessed web content, reducing the need for 
repeated downloads and thus saving bandwidth. 
	
 
1327

Option A is incorrect. A decentralized approach would make it 
challenging to consistently apply and enforce policies across the 
enterprise. It may also lead to inefficiencies in bandwidth usage 
as content caching would not be centralized. 
Option B is incorrect. While a DNS-based filtering service can 
help in blocking access to certain malicious or inappropriate 
sites, it does not offer the centralized control or caching 
capabilities that a proxy does. 
Option D is incorrect. Relying on browser extensions is a 
decentralized method that depends on user compliance and may 
not provide centralized control or caching capabilities. 
Question 395. A software development company has just 
expanded its team and wants to ensure that in the event of a 
disaster, they can resume operations within a day. However, 
they have a limited budget for disaster recovery. Which of the 
following disaster recovery site types would be the most 
suitable for the company’s needs? 
(A)       Hot site with hourly data replication 
(B)       Cold site with monthly data backups 
(C)       Warm site with daily backups 
(D)       Offsite tape backups 
Explanation 395. Correct Answer: C. Warm site with daily 
backups. For the software development company’s need to 
resume operations within a day, a warm site with daily backups 
would be ideal. The warm site has equipment and some level of 
data ready, which would facilitate a faster recovery compared to 
a cold site or just offsite backups. 
	
 
1328

Option A is incorrect. A hot site with hourly data replication 
might provide the quickest recovery, but it’s also the most 
expensive option which may not align with the company’s 
budget constraints. 
Option B is incorrect. A cold site with monthly data backups 
would be cost-effective but might not allow for operations to 
resume within a day due to the time needed to set up equipment 
and restore the latest data. 
Option D is incorrect. Offsite tape backups alone would not 
provide the infrastructure or equipment needed for quick 
recovery. It would also take considerable time to restore 
operations just from tape backups. 
Question 396. A company has recently noticed an increased 
number of employees accessing social media sites during work 
hours, leading to decreased productivity. To counter this, the 
security administrator decides to limit access to these websites 
during peak working hours. Which firewall rule modification 
should the administrator make? 
(A)       Implement an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule to 
block social media content 
(B)       Change the firewall rule to deny access to known 
social media IP addresses between 9 AM and 5 PM 
(C)       Use the firewall's URL filtering capability to blacklist 
social media URLs 
(D)       Increase the firewall's bandwidth to accommodate the 
excess traffic 
	
 
1329

Explanation 396. Correct Answer: B. Change the firewall 
rule to deny access to known social media IP addresses 
between 9 AM and 5 PM. Implementing a time-based rule that 
denies access to specific IP addresses (or ranges) associated 
with social media can be an effective way to restrict access 
during specified hours. 
Option A is incorrect. An IPS is designed to detect and prevent 
malicious activities based on signatures. Blocking social media 
content is not typically its primary function. 
Option C is incorrect. URL filtering would block access to the 
URLs entirely. The requirement is to block them only during 
specific hours. 
Option D is incorrect. Increasing the firewall’s bandwidth 
doesn’t address the problem of employees accessing social 
media during work hours. 
Question 397. As part of the annual security training, the IT 
department of XYZ Corp decides to launch a simulated 
phishing campaign. The aim is to assess employees’ ability to 
identify and report phishing emails. Which of the following 
would be the MOST effective first step in ensuring the success 
of this campaign? 
(A)       Informing all employees about the campaign a week 
prior 
(B)       Creating a realistic phishing email that closely 
resembles common threats 
(C)       Offering rewards to employees who click on the 
	
 
1330

simulated phishing links 
(D)       Reviewing the results of the previous year’s campaign 
Explanation 397. Correct Answer: B. Creating a realistic 
phishing email that closely resembles common threats. For 
the phishing campaign to effectively assess employees’ ability 
to recognize phishing threats, the simulated phishing email must 
be as realistic as possible. By making it closely resemble 
common threats, the IT department can gain a more accurate 
measure of the employees’ awareness and response. 
Option A is incorrect. Informing all employees about the 
campaign beforehand would defeat the purpose of the test, as 
they would be expecting a phishing email and thus be more 
likely to recognize and report it. 
Option C is incorrect. Offering rewards to employees who 
click on the simulated phishing links would encourage risky 
behavior and is counterproductive to the goal of increasing 
security awareness. 
Option D is incorrect. While reviewing results from previous 
campaigns can provide insights, it would not be the most 
effective first step in ensuring the success of the current 
campaign. 
Question 398. An organization is planning to deploy a new web 
application that will be accessible from both the internal 
network and the internet. The application will communicate 
exclusively over HTTPS. The security administrator is asked to 
configure the firewall to allow the necessary traffic. Which of 
	
 
1331

the following should the administrator configure? 
(A)       Allow port 21 and block all others 
(B)       Allow port 443 and block all others 
(C)       Allow port 80 and block all others 
(D)       Allow port 23 and block all others 
Explanation 398. Correct Answer: B. Allow port 443 and 
block all others. HTTPS primarily uses port 443 for secure 
communication. Thus, allowing port 443 and blocking all others 
would ensure the secure operation of the web application. 
Option A is incorrect. Port 21 is used for FTP (File Transfer 
Protocol), which is not relevant to HTTPS communication. 
Option C is incorrect. While port 80 is used for HTTP, it does 
not provide the encryption that HTTPS does on port 443. 
Option D is incorrect. Port 23 is used for Telnet, which is 
unrelated to secure web communication. 
Question 399. The IT department of XYZ Corp is keen on 
preventing users from changing specific system settings, such as 
altering the firewall configurations. The majority of their 
infrastructure is based on Windows operating systems. Which of 
the following would be the most effective way to achieve this? 
(A)       Use SELinux to enforce strict access controls 
(B)       Utilize Group Policy to set and enforce policies 
related to system settings 
(C)       Deploy a third-party software solution to lock system 
settings 
	
 
1332

(D)       Implement a user training program to guide users on 
system settings best practices 
Explanation 399. Correct Answer: B. Utilize Group Policy to 
set and enforce policies related to system settings. Group 
Policy provides centralized management and configuration of 
operating systems, applications, and users’ settings in an Active 
Directory environment. This can be used to enforce specific 
policies related to system settings in a Windows environment. 
Option A is incorrect. SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) is 
primarily used in Linux environments to enforce mandatory 
access controls. It wouldn’t be appropriate for a primarily 
Windows-based infrastructure. 
Option C is incorrect. While third-party solutions may exist, 
leveraging built-in features like Group Policy is often more 
streamlined, cost-effective, and efficient. 
Option D is incorrect. While user training is essential, relying 
solely on training without implementing technical controls is 
not effective in preventing users from altering system settings. 
Question 400. During a routine check, an IT technician notices 
several files on a company server have been renamed with a 
“.locked” extension and there’s a new file named 
“README_TO_RECOVER_FILES.txt” present in the root 
directory. Based on these indicators, which type of malicious 
activity is most likely in progress? 
(A)       Worm propagation 
(B)       Trojan horse execution 
	
 
1333

(C)       Ransomware attack 
(D)       Logic bomb activation 
Explanation 400. Correct Answer: C. Ransomware attack. 
Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts a 
victim’s files, rendering them inaccessible. The attacker then 
demands a ransom from the victim in return for the decryption 
key. The renaming of files with a specific extension (like 
“.locked”) and the presence of a ransom note (like 
“README_TO_RECOVER_FILES.txt”) are typical indicators 
of a ransomware attack. 
Option A is incorrect. Worm propagation refers to the spread 
of a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself 
to spread to other computers. It doesn’t typically rename files or 
leave readable messages. 
Option B is incorrect. A Trojan horse is malicious software 
that deceives users about its true intent. While it can deliver a 
ransomware payload, the described indicators more directly 
suggest ransomware activity. 
Option D is incorrect. A logic bomb is a piece of code that 
executes a malicious function when certain conditions are met, 
but it doesn’t necessarily leave the described file traces.

Answers 401-500 
Question 401. The IT department at TechCorp Ltd has been 
instructed to ensure that critical system files remain unchanged 
to avoid potential security breaches. They want to implement a 
system that can provide alerts whenever there is an 
unauthorized change to these files. Which of the following 
would best serve this purpose? 
(A)       Data Loss Prevention (DLP) 
(B)       Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
	
 
1371

(C)       File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) 
(D)       Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) 
Explanation 401. Correct Answer: C. File Integrity 
Monitoring (FIM). File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) tools 
monitor and detect changes in files that may indicate a breach, 
malware infection, or other unauthorized activity. By tracking 
and reporting on file change patterns, FIM helps ensure the 
integrity and confidentiality of data. 
Option A is incorrect. Data Loss Prevention (DLP) focuses on 
preventing unauthorized data transfers or leaks from the 
organization, not on monitoring file changes. 
Option B is incorrect. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
primarily detects unauthorized access or attacks on a network. 
While it can identify some unauthorized file changes, it isn’t 
specifically designed for file integrity monitoring. 
Option D is incorrect. Remote Monitoring and Management 
(RMM) tools primarily allow IT professionals to monitor and 
manage endpoints, networks, and computers remotely. They 
don’t specifically focus on file integrity. 
Question 402. Cybertech Corp. is reviewing its backup 
protocols to enhance security. They decided that before 
transferring backups to an offsite location, the data should be 
rendered unreadable to unauthorized individuals. Which backup 
strategy will ensure this requirement is met? 
(A)       Use deduplication before storing backups 
(B)       Store backups in proprietary formats 
	
 
1372

(C)       Encrypt backups before transfer 
(D)       Compress backups using standard tools 
Explanation 402. Correct Answer: C. Encrypt backups 
before transfer. Encryption transforms data into a format that 
can only be read by someone who possesses the decryption key. 
By encrypting backups before transferring, Cybertech Corp. 
ensures that even if unauthorized individuals access the backup 
data, they won’t be able to understand its contents. 
Option A is incorrect. Deduplication reduces the storage space 
required for backups by eliminating redundant data but doesn’t 
make data unreadable to unauthorized individuals. 
Option B is incorrect. Using proprietary formats may obscure 
the data for some unauthorized users, but it does not provide the 
robust protection encryption does. 
Option D is incorrect. Compressing backups using standard 
tools optimizes storage but does not ensure data confidentiality. 
Question 403. XYZ Corp is designing their new web 
application infrastructure. They want to ensure that all web 
traffic to and from their application is encrypted. In addition to 
selecting HTTPS as the protocol, which default port should they 
configure for this encrypted traffic? 
(A)       21 
(B)       80 
(C)       443 
(D)       25 
	
 
1373

Explanation 403. Correct Answer: C. 443. Port 443 is the 
default port used for HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS) traffic. It 
ensures that web traffic is encrypted and provides a secure 
communication channel between the client and the server. 
Option A is incorrect. Port 21 is the default port for FTP (File 
Transfer Protocol), which is used for transferring files, not 
encrypted web traffic. 
Option B is incorrect. Port 80 is the default port for HTTP, 
which is unencrypted. 
Option D is incorrect. Port 25 is the default port for SMTP 
(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), which is used for email 
transmission, not encrypted web traffic. 
Question 404. A company is developing a new web application 
that will be processing highly sensitive user data. They want to 
ensure that if the web server is compromised, attackers cannot 
directly access the database or other critical infrastructure. 
Which of the following is the BEST strategy to achieve this 
objective? 
(A)       Use strong authentication methods for the web 
application 
(B)       Encrypt the user data at rest and in transit 
(C)       Place the web server and the database server in 
separate network segments 
(D)       Implement real-time monitoring of the web server 
Explanation 404. Correct Answer: C. Place the web server 
and the database server in separate network segments. By 
	
 
1374

placing the web server and the database server in separate 
network segments, the company can achieve isolation. This 
means that even if the web server is compromised, attackers 
would still have to breach additional security measures to access 
the database server or other critical parts of the infrastructure. 
Option A is incorrect. While using strong authentication 
methods is important, it doesn’t provide isolation between the 
web server and other critical components. 
Option B is incorrect. Encrypting user data is essential for data 
protection, but it doesn’t provide network-based isolation 
between the web server and other systems. 
Option D is incorrect. Real-time monitoring can provide alerts 
on suspicious activities, but it doesn’t provide the desired 
isolation. 
Question 405. After a major outage, CloudTech Services is 
reviewing their disaster recovery strategy. The company found 
out that after restoring from backup, several applications did not 
function properly due to configuration discrepancies. What 
would be the best approach to ensure a successful recovery in 
the future? 
(A)       Prioritize applications for backup based on their 
importance 
(B)       Implement differential backups in addition to full 
backups 
(C)       Regularly conduct a full system recovery in a test 
environment 
	
 
1375

(D)       Use a third-party backup solution instead of an in-house 
solution 
Explanation 405. Correct Answer: C. Regularly conduct a 
full system recovery in a test environment. By conducting a 
full system recovery in a test environment, CloudTech can 
simulate a real-world recovery scenario. This helps in 
identifying any discrepancies, configuration issues, or 
application dependencies that might be missed during regular 
backups, ensuring a successful recovery when it’s critically 
needed. 
Option A is incorrect. Prioritizing applications for backup 
based on their importance doesn’t address the configuration 
discrepancies or interdependencies between applications. 
Option B is incorrect. Implementing differential backups, 
while beneficial in capturing changes, does not address the 
configuration discrepancies found during the recovery. 
Option D is incorrect. Using a third-party solution instead of 
an in-house solution does not inherently guarantee a successful 
recovery or address the specific issue of configuration 
discrepancies. 
Question 406. GlobalBank has implemented a backup strategy 
where only the changes made since the last full backup are 
recorded. Considering the need to optimize storage and reduce 
backup times, the IT team performs this type of backup every 
day. What backup frequency and type is GlobalBank utilizing? 
(A)       Incremental Backup daily 
	
 
1376

(B)       Differential Backup weekly 
(C)       Full Backup bi-weekly 
(D)       Snapshot Backup daily 
Explanation 406. Correct Answer: A. Incremental Backup 
daily. GlobalBank captures only the changes made since the last 
full backup, which is characteristic of incremental backups. 
Furthermore, they perform this type of backup every day, 
indicating a daily frequency. 
Option B is incorrect. Differential backups capture the changes 
made since the last full backup but would cumulatively grow in 
size each time until the next full backup, unlike the incremental 
which resets with each backup. 
Option C is incorrect. A full backup would involve backing up 
all the data, regardless of changes, and the scenario does not 
mention a bi-weekly frequency. 
Option D is incorrect. Snapshot backups capture the state of a 
system at a particular point in time, but the scenario specifically 
mentions capturing changes since the last full backup. 
Question 407. A company has recently deployed a new e-
commerce application. The security team wants to ensure they 
can detect any unauthorized or malicious activities on the 
application. Which of the following would be the MOST 
effective way to achieve this goal? 
(A)       Conduct a penetration test on the application 
(B)       Install a firewall in front of the application 
(C)       Implement continuous monitoring of the 
	
 
1377

application's logs and activities 
(D)       Provide training to users about secure browsing habits 
Explanation 407. Correct Answer: C. Implement continuous 
monitoring of the application’s logs and activities. 
Continuous monitoring of an application’s logs and activities 
allows the security team to detect and respond to any suspicious 
or unauthorized behavior in real-time. This ensures that 
potential threats can be identified and addressed promptly, 
enhancing the security posture of the application. 
Option A is incorrect. While a penetration test can identify 
vulnerabilities in an application, it does not offer continuous 
monitoring or detection capabilities for ongoing malicious 
activities. 
Option B is incorrect. While a firewall can provide a layer of 
security by filtering malicious traffic, it doesn’t offer the 
granular insights or real-time monitoring needed to detect all 
unauthorized activities within an application. 
Option D is incorrect. Training users about secure browsing 
habits is important but would not directly help in monitoring or 
detecting malicious activities on the e-commerce application. 
Question 408. Sophia, a network administrator, is reviewing the 
logs from the company’s Intrusion Detection System (IDS). She 
notices an increased amount of outbound traffic to an unfamiliar 
IP address. Upon deeper analysis, she found that the traffic 
consists of sensitive data being transferred. What type of 
malicious code might be responsible for this? 
	
 
1378

(A)       Ransomware 
(B)       Adware 
(C)       Data Exfiltration Malware 
(D)       Keylogger 
Explanation 408. Correct Answer: C. Data Exfiltration 
Malware. Data Exfiltration Malware is designed to extract and 
transfer sensitive data from the target system to a location 
controlled by the attacker. The fact that sensitive data is being 
transferred to an unfamiliar IP address points to this type of 
malicious code. 
Option A is incorrect. Ransomware is a type of malware that 
encrypts the victim’s files and demands a ransom to restore 
access. While it might involve data theft, it’s primarily known 
for encryption and ransom demands, not for transferring data 
outward. 
Option B is incorrect. Adware is a type of software that 
displays unwanted ads on a user’s computer. While it might be 
intrusive and unwanted, it doesn’t typically exfiltrate data. 
Option D is incorrect. A Keylogger is designed to record 
keystrokes on a computer and may capture sensitive data like 
passwords. However, the primary behavior of a keylogger is 
capturing keystrokes, not transferring large amounts of data 
outward. 
Question 409. ExamsDigest Enterprises wants to streamline 
their permission assignments. They decide that rather than 
assigning permissions to each user individually, they will group 
	
 
1379

users based on departmental roles and then assign permissions 
to these groups. For example, all members of the “Marketing” 
role would have access to the marketing database. Which access 
control method is ExamsDigest Enterprises employing? 
(A)       Rule-based access control 
(B)       Mandatory Access Control (MAC) 
(C)       Discretionary Access Control (DAC) 
(D)       Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 
Explanation 409. Correct Answer: D. Role-Based Access 
Control (RBAC). RBAC involves grouping users based on 
roles (in this case, departments like “Marketing”) and then 
assigning permissions to these roles. Individuals are then placed 
into these roles, which determines their access. The scenario 
described by ExamsDigest Enterprises is a clear example of 
implementing RBAC. 
Option A is incorrect. Rule-based access control often deals 
with predefined rules for access, commonly used in firewalls or 
routers, and is not about grouping users based on roles. 
Option B is incorrect. MAC is more about classifying 
information and having users with the appropriate clearance 
levels. It doesn’t deal with departmental roles like the scenario 
mentioned. 
Option C is incorrect. DAC allows resource owners to grant or 
deny permissions. It does not inherently involve assigning 
permissions based on roles or job functions. 
	
 
1380

Question 410. A security administrator is considering a 
cryptographic solution for protecting data in transit between two 
servers located in the same data center. The primary goal is to 
ensure speed and efficiency in encryption and decryption 
processes. Which type of encryption would best meet this 
requirement? 
(A)       Asymmetric encryption using RSA 
(B)       Symmetric encryption using AES 
(C)       Hybrid encryption using a combination of RSA and 
AES 
(D)       Asymmetric encryption using ECC 
Explanation 410. Correct Answer: B. Symmetric encryption 
using AES. Symmetric encryption, such as AES, is typically 
faster and requires less computational resources than 
asymmetric encryption. This makes it suitable for scenarios 
where high-speed encryption and decryption are essential, like 
for data in transit between servers in a data center. 
Option A is incorrect. Asymmetric encryption using RSA is 
more computationally intensive than symmetric encryption and 
may not be the most efficient for the given scenario. 
Option C is incorrect. While hybrid encryption can provide a 
balance of security and speed, using only symmetric encryption 
(AES) is more efficient for the described use case. 
Option D is incorrect. ECC, like RSA, is an asymmetric 
encryption method, which means it will typically be slower than 
symmetric methods like AES.

Question 411. A large e-commerce company is deploying a new 
online payment system. The Chief Information Security Officer 
(CISO) is concerned about the security of cryptographic keys 
and wants to ensure they are protected from potential theft or 
compromise. Which tool should the CISO implement to provide 
the HIGHEST level of security for these keys? 
(A)       Password vault 
(B)       Software-based key storage 
(C)       Hardware Security Module (HSM) 
(D)       Cloud-based encryption service 
Explanation 411. Correct Answer: C. Hardware Security 
Module (HSM). A Hardware Security Module (HSM) is a 
specialized device specifically designed to manage, protect, and 
securely store cryptographic keys. It is built to be tamper-
resistant and provides a high level of security, making it suitable 
for environments where the protection of cryptographic keys is 
of paramount importance, such as in an e-commerce payment 
system. 
Option A is incorrect. A password vault is designed primarily 
for storing and managing passwords, not cryptographic keys 
used in payment systems. 
Option B is incorrect. Software-based key storage solutions do 
not provide the same level of physical security that an HSM 
offers. 
Option D is incorrect. While cloud-based encryption services 
can provide encryption capabilities, they might not offer the 
	
 
1382

same level of physical protection and control as an on-premises 
HSM. 
Question 412. During a security audit, a company realized that 
a malicious actor was able to situate themselves on the network 
path, capturing TLS handshake messages between clients and 
the server. The attacker’s goal is to weaken the encryption by 
influencing the cipher suite negotiation process. What type of 
network attack does this scenario depict? 
(A)       ARP Poisoning 
(B)       Downgrade Attack 
(C)       SYN Flood 
(D)       Ping of Death 
Explanation 412. Correct Answer: B. Downgrade Attack. A 
Downgrade Attack occurs when an attacker interferes with the 
setup process (e.g., TLS handshake) to force two entities to 
settle on a less secure communication mode or encryption 
standard. In this case, by capturing and potentially altering the 
TLS handshake messages, the attacker is trying to make the 
client and server use a weaker cipher suite. 
Option A is incorrect. ARP Poisoning is a type of attack where 
an attacker sends falsified ARP messages over a local area 
network to link the attacker’s MAC address with the IP address 
of another node (such as the default gateway). This is a way to 
facilitate on-path attacks, but the scenario describes influencing 
the cipher suite negotiation, which is a Downgrade Attack. 
Option C is incorrect. SYN Flood is a form of denial-of-
service attack in which an attacker sends a sequence of SYN 
	
 
1383

requests to a target’s system in an attempt to consume server 
resources. It does not relate to capturing TLS handshake 
messages. 
Option D is incorrect. Ping of Death is an old attack where 
malicious parties send malformed or oversized ping packets to 
crash the target system. It doesn’t involve capturing or 
influencing the TLS handshake process. 
Question 413. A software developer wants to store user 
passwords in a way that even if the database is compromised, 
attackers would not be able to retrieve the original passwords. 
What technique should the developer use to achieve this? 
(A)       Symmetric encryption 
(B)       Digital signing 
(C)       Hashing 
(D)       Steganography 
Explanation 413. Correct Answer: C. Hashing. Hashing is a 
technique that takes an input (or ‘message’) and returns a fixed-
size string of bytes, usually in the form of a digest. The output 
should ideally be unique (within reason) for every different 
input. It’s often used for storing passwords because even a tiny 
change in input will produce a dramatically different output, and 
it’s computationally hard to reverse the process. 
Option A is incorrect. Symmetric encryption uses the same key 
for both encryption and decryption. If an attacker gains access 
to the encryption key, they can decrypt any encrypted data. 
	
 
1384

Option B is incorrect. Digital signing is used to verify the 
integrity and authenticity of a message but does not hide the 
original content. 
Option D is incorrect. Steganography involves hiding 
information within other information, which isn’t related to 
securely storing passwords. 
Question 414. A company’s IT department notices a sharp 
increase in account lockouts over the past two days, especially 
during non-business hours. While some accounts are from 
various departments, a majority are from the finance team. 
Which of the following is the MOST plausible explanation for 
these lockouts? 
(A)       Scheduled maintenance by the IT department 
(B)       Employees are sharing passwords within the finance 
team 
(C)       An attacker is trying to gain unauthorized access 
(D)       A recent password policy change requiring more 
frequent changes 
Explanation 414. Correct Answer: C. An attacker is trying 
to gain unauthorized access. A sudden increase in account 
lockouts, especially during non-business hours, indicates 
suspicious activity. The targeted nature of the lockouts, 
especially on sensitive departments like finance, suggests an 
attacker might be attempting unauthorized access. 
Option A is incorrect. Scheduled maintenance would typically 
be communicated in advance, and it’s unlikely to cause a sharp 
increase in account lockouts. 
	
 
1385

Option B is incorrect. While employees sharing passwords is a 
security concern, it would not typically result in a surge of 
account lockouts, especially during non-business hours. 
Option D is incorrect. A password policy change might result 
in some increased lockouts, but the targeted nature of the 
lockouts (majority from finance) and their occurrence during 
non-business hours make this option less likely. 
Question 415. Carlos is responsible for managing IT services 
for a university. The university has numerous departments, each 
with its subdomain, like arts.university.com, 
science.university.com, and sports.university.com. Carlos wants 
a solution that ensures HTTPS security while being cost-
effective. However, he’s wary of potential risks. What might be 
a drawback of using a Wildcard Certificate for the university’s 
subdomains? 
(A)       It can secure only one subdomain 
(B)       If compromised, all subdomains are at risk 
(C)       It only validates the domain ownership, not the 
organization's identity 
(D)       It's the most expensive certificate available 
Explanation 415. Correct Answer: B. If compromised, all 
subdomains are at risk. The primary concern with a Wildcard 
Certificate is that if its private key is compromised, it 
jeopardizes the security of all associated subdomains. This 
poses a significant risk since the exposure of a single key could 
lead to potential attacks or misuse across all subdomains. 
	
 
1386

Option A is incorrect. A Wildcard Certificate can secure 
multiple subdomains under a single domain. 
Option C is incorrect. While true for Domain Validated (DV) 
certificates, Wildcard Certificates can also be available with 
Organization Validation (OV), ensuring organizational identity. 
Option D is incorrect. Wildcard Certificates aren’t necessarily 
the most expensive. The cost varies based on the level of 
validation and the issuing authority. 
Question 416. SecureData Inc., a financial firm, recently 
experienced a system crash and needed to restore their database. 
While they had a full backup from the previous week, they 
realized that several days of transactions were missing. To 
prevent such data loss in the future, which backup strategy 
involving recording transactions can SecureData implement? 
(A)       Implement differential backups 
(B)       Use snapshot backups every hour 
(C)       Enable database journaling 
(D)       Configure RAID 5 for their storage 
Explanation 416. Correct Answer: C. Enable database 
journaling. Journaling involves keeping a log or ‘journal’ of 
every transaction or change that happens. If there’s a crash, the 
system can be restored to the last backup and then use the 
journal to replay each transaction, thus preventing data loss. 
Option A is incorrect. Differential backups capture changes 
since the last full backup, but they don’t record every 
transaction in real-time like journaling. 
	
 
1387

Option B is incorrect. While hourly snapshot backups would 
reduce the potential data loss window, they still don’t capture 
every transaction in real-time. 
Option D is incorrect. RAID 5 offers redundancy and can 
protect against a disk failure, but it doesn’t capture and record 
every database transaction like journaling. 
Question 417. A company has set up its firewall to allow web 
traffic through port 80 and port 443, while denying all other 
traffic by default. This setup is an example of which type of 
access control? 
(A)       Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 
(B)       Mandatory Access Control (MAC) 
(C)       Discretionary Access Control (DAC) 
(D)       Rule-Based Access Control (RAC)  
Explanation 417. Correct Answer: D. Rule-Based Access 
Control (RAC). Rule-Based Access Control (RAC) operates 
based on predefined rules set by administrators. In the scenario 
described, the firewall is using rules to allow traffic on certain 
ports (80 and 443) while denying all others, making this a clear 
example of RAC. 
Option A is incorrect. RBAC assigns permissions based on 
roles within an organization. Firewall rules are not typically 
assigned based on user roles. 
Option B is incorrect. MAC involves classifying information 
and matching user clearance levels to these classifications. It is 
unrelated to firewall rule settings. 
	
 
1388

Option C is incorrect. DAC allows resource owners to specify 
who can access their resources. Firewall rule settings don’t 
operate based on individual discretion. 
Question 418. During a routine security assessment, Jake, a 
penetration tester, discovers that by modifying a configuration 
file located in a public directory, he can assign himself 
administrative privileges in the application. What type of 
vulnerability is Jake exploiting? 
(A)       Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
(B)       Privilege Escalation 
(C)       SQL Injection 
(D)       Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) 
Explanation 418. Correct Answer: B. Privilege Escalation. 
Privilege escalation occurs when a user increases their 
privileges beyond what was originally granted to them, allowing 
them to perform actions that they should not be allowed to. In 
this scenario, Jake is elevating his privileges in the application 
by modifying a configuration file, indicating a privilege 
escalation vulnerability. 
Option A is incorrect. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) involves an 
attacker injecting malicious scripts into web content viewed by 
other users. This scenario does not relate to injecting scripts. 
Option C is incorrect. SQL Injection vulnerabilities allow 
attackers to manipulate or query a database directly through 
input fields. The scenario does not indicate any interaction with 
a database. 
	
 
1389

Option D is incorrect. Insecure Direct Object Reference 
(IDOR) vulnerabilities occur when an application allows access 
to objects based on user-supplied input. While the scenario 
involves accessing a file, it is the act of elevating privileges that 
is the primary concern. 
Question 419. A school wants to prevent its students from 
accessing inappropriate websites during class hours. The IT 
department decides to implement a solution that blocks requests 
to specific domain names associated with inappropriate content. 
Which of the following security solutions would best address 
this need? 
(A)       Firewall filtering based on IP addresses 
(B)       Intrusion Detection System monitoring 
(C)       Virtual Private Network (VPN) enforcement 
(D)       DNS filtering with a blacklist 
Explanation 419. Correct Answer: D. DNS filtering with a 
blacklist. DNS filtering is a technique that can be used to 
prevent users from accessing specific websites by blocking 
requests to certain domain names. A blacklist can be created to 
list the domain names associated with inappropriate content, 
and when users try to access these sites, the DNS filter will not 
resolve the domain name, thereby preventing access. 
Option A is incorrect. While firewalls can block traffic based 
on IP addresses, this method is not as effective for blocking 
specific domain names, especially when a domain can have 
multiple IP addresses or if the IPs can change. 
	
 
1390

Option B is incorrect. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are 
primarily used for detecting and alerting on malicious activities 
but not for blocking access to specific domain names. 
Option C is incorrect. VPNs are used to create a secure 
communication channel and are not inherently designed to 
block domain name resolutions. 
Question 420. A financial firm has just experienced a cyber 
attack, and the IT team identified a piece of malware that 
evaded their traditional antivirus solutions. The CISO now 
wants to not only detect but also be able to analyze and respond 
to such advanced threats in real-time. Which solution should the 
firm consider implementing? 
(A)       Vulnerability Scanner 
(B)       Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) 
(C)       Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) 
(D)       Patch Management System 
Explanation 420. Correct Answer: C. Endpoint Detection 
and Response (EDR). Endpoint Detection and Response 
(EDR) provides real-time monitoring and analysis of endpoint 
events, allowing an organization to detect, investigate, and 
respond to potential security threats. EDR tools can identify 
behaviors that might indicate advanced threats that evade 
traditional antivirus solutions. 
Option A is incorrect. Vulnerability Scanners are used to 
identify vulnerabilities in a system or network but do not 
provide real-time monitoring and response capabilities for 
threats. 
	
 
1391

Option B is incorrect. Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) 
monitor network traffic to prevent potential threats, but they 
might not provide in-depth analysis and response at the 
endpoint level like EDR solutions do. 
Option D is incorrect. Patch Management Systems are used to 
manage the distribution and installation of software updates but 
do not offer real-time threat detection and response. 
Question 421. During a routine audit of the corporate servers, 
the system administrator discovers that a week’s worth of 
security logs are missing from one of the key application 
servers. Which of the following is the MOST likely reason for 
this occurrence? 
(A)       The logging service experienced a malfunction 
(B)       There was insufficient storage space for the logs 
(C)       A malware attack aimed to erase traces of intrusion 
(D)       The time zone setting was incorrectly configured 
Explanation 421. Correct Answer: C. A malware attack 
aimed to erase traces of intrusion. One of the primary tactics 
attackers use after gaining unauthorized access is to cover their 
tracks. Deleting or altering logs is a common method used to 
avoid detection and prevent any trace of malicious activity. 
Option A is incorrect. While it’s possible for the logging 
service to malfunction, it’s less likely for it to result in a specific 
week’s worth of logs being missing, without affecting other 
time periods. 
	
 
1392

Option B is incorrect. Insufficient storage space can cause 
newer logs to overwrite older ones, but it would typically not 
result in a discrete chunk of logs, such as an entire week, to be 
missing. 
Option D is incorrect. A misconfigured time zone setting 
might cause timestamp discrepancies in logs, but it wouldn’t 
cause logs to be missing. 
Question 422. A financial company is designing a new system 
that needs to ensure data is accessed based on classifications 
and clearance levels of the users. Which of the following access 
control models BEST fits this requirement? 
(A)       Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 
(B)       Discretionary Access Control (DAC) 
(C)       Mandatory Access Control (MAC) 
(D)       Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) 
Explanation 422. Correct Answer: C. Mandatory Access 
Control (MAC). MAC is based on the classification of 
information and the clearance level of users. In a MAC model, 
the operating system constrains the ability of a subject or 
initiator to access or perform some sort of operation on an 
object or target. In this scenario, where data is classified and 
users are given clearance levels, MAC is the most suitable 
model. 
Option A is incorrect. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 
assigns permissions to specific roles in an organization. Users 
are then assigned to roles. While useful in many contexts, it 
doesn’t focus on classifications and clearance levels. 
	
 
1393

Option B is incorrect. Discretionary Access Control (DAC) 
allows the owner of the resource to specify who can access it. 
It’s more flexible but less restrictive than MAC. 
Option D is incorrect. Attribute-Based Access Control 
(ABAC) uses policies to determine access, based on attributes 
of users, the environment, and the resource itself. While it can 
be used in scenarios with classifications and clearances, it’s not 
as strictly based on these factors as MAC. 
Question 423. TechSolutions Inc., a rapidly growing startup, is 
expanding its workforce to meet its customer demands. As part 
of this expansion, they need to ensure their IT infrastructure can 
accommodate the influx of new employees without 
compromising performance or security. Which of the following 
should be TechSolutions’ primary focus during this expansion 
phase? 
(A)       Adopting a Zero Trust Network Architecture 
(B)       Increasing the frequency of vulnerability assessments 
(C)       Implementing capacity planning 
(D)       Deploying additional firewalls and intrusion detection 
systems 
Explanation 423. Correct Answer: C. Implementing 
capacity planning. Capacity planning ensures that an 
organization’s infrastructure, technology, and people are scaled 
appropriately to meet growth and performance needs. In the 
scenario, with an influx of new employees, ensuring that the IT 
infrastructure can handle the increased demand is crucial. 
	
 
1394

Option A is incorrect. While adopting a Zero Trust Network 
Architecture might enhance security, it doesn’t address the need 
to scale resources to accommodate new employees. 
Option B is incorrect. Vulnerability assessments are crucial for 
security, but they don’t directly address the infrastructure’s 
ability to handle growth. 
Option D is incorrect. While firewalls and IDS can improve 
security, they don’t directly address the organization’s capacity 
to handle more employees 
Question 424. Emily, a cybersecurity analyst, has been tasked 
with gathering preliminary information about a target 
organization without directly interacting with its systems. She 
decides to collect data from third-party sources, search engines, 
public records, and other online platforms without sending any 
packets to the target. Which phase of penetration testing is 
Emily currently engaged in? 
(A)       Active reconnaissance 
(B)       Passive reconnaissance 
(C)       Vulnerability scanning 
(D)       Threat hunting  
Explanation 424. Correct Answer: B. Passive 
reconnaissance. Passive reconnaissance is the initial phase in 
which the penetration tester collects information about the target 
without directly engaging with or alerting the target. Emily’s 
approach of gathering data from third-party sources without 
sending packets or interacting directly with the target’s systems 
is in line with the characteristics of passive reconnaissance. 
	
 
1395

Option A is incorrect. Active reconnaissance involves directly 
interacting with the target systems, often sending packets or 
probes, which can potentially be detected by the target. 
Option C is incorrect. Vulnerability scanning is a step further 
where specific tools are used to identify vulnerabilities in a 
system. It is more direct than passive reconnaissance. 
Option D is incorrect. Threat hunting is a proactive approach 
to finding malicious activities within a system rather than 
gathering information about a target system. 
Question 425. During the setup of a secure communication 
channel, Alice and Bob need to agree upon a shared secret key 
without sending the key directly to each other, as they fear 
eavesdropping. Which protocol would best facilitate this 
requirement? 
(A)       RSA 
(B)       HMAC 
(C)       Diffie-Hellman 
(D)       AES 
Explanation 425. Correct Answer: C. Diffie-Hellman. The 
Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol allows two parties to 
each generate public and private key pairs, exchange the public 
keys, and then derive a shared secret key. This secret key can 
then be used for symmetric encryption. The beauty of this 
protocol is that the shared secret can be derived without directly 
sending it over the communication channel, preventing 
eavesdroppers from obtaining the secret key directly. 
	
 
1396

Option A is incorrect. RSA is an asymmetric encryption 
method, not a key exchange protocol. 
Option B is incorrect. HMAC is a specific type of message 
authentication code that involves hashing and is not used for 
key exchange. 
Option D is incorrect. AES is a symmetric encryption 
algorithm and does not offer a key exchange mechanism. 
Question 426. A company plans to upgrade its email server to 
ensure that email transmission between their mail server and 
client applications is encrypted. Which of the following 
protocols would be the most appropriate for this purpose? 
(A)       HTTP 
(B)       FTP 
(C)       IMAP over SSL/TLS 
(D)       SNMP 
Explanation 426. Correct Answer: C. IMAP over SSL/TLS. 
IMAP over SSL/TLS (commonly known as IMAPS) is a 
protocol used by email clients to retrieve messages from a mail 
server over a secure channel. The use of SSL/TLS provides 
encryption for the transmitted data, ensuring confidentiality of 
the email transmission. 
Option A is incorrect. HTTP is a protocol for transferring web 
content and does not provide encryption by default. 
Furthermore, it’s not designed for email transmission. 
	
 
1397

Option B is incorrect. FTP is a protocol for transferring files 
and does not provide secure email transmission capabilities. 
Option C is incorrect. SNMP (Simple Network Management 
Protocol) is used for network management and monitoring, not 
for email transmission. 
Question 427. A medium-sized company has just deployed a 
new file server for the HR department. They want to ensure that 
only HR employees can view and edit HR-specific documents, 
while the IT department should only be able to perform system 
maintenance tasks. What should the company implement to 
achieve this requirement? 
(A)       Install a firewall between the HR and IT departments 
(B)       Implement an Access Control List (ACL) for the file 
server 
(C)       Enforce a strong password policy for the HR department 
(D)       Enable full disk encryption on the file server 
Explanation 427. Correct Answer: B. Implement an Access 
Control List (ACL) for the file server. Access Control Lists 
(ACLs) define who can access a resource and what they can do 
with it once accessed. By setting up an ACL for the file server, 
the company can precisely define the permissions for HR and IT 
departments, ensuring that only authorized users have the right 
level of access to the data. 
Option A is incorrect. Installing a firewall would limit network 
traffic between departments but would not provide granular 
access control to files on the server. 
	
 
1398

Option C is incorrect. While a strong password policy is 
essential for security, it doesn’t differentiate access between HR 
and IT or control what users can do once they access the server. 
Option D is incorrect. Full disk encryption protects data at rest, 
but it does not provide differentiated access to specific files or 
directories based on user roles. 
Question 428. Carla, a security analyst, receives an alert that 
one of the company’s server certificates may have been exposed 
in a recent data breach. What is the most immediate action Carla 
should take to ensure that the exposed certificate cannot be used 
maliciously? 
(A)       Request a new certificate from the CA 
(B)       Update the company firewall rules 
(C)       Add the certificate to the Certificate revocation list 
(CRL) 
(D)       Perform a vulnerability assessment on the server 
Explanation 428. Correct Answer: C. Add the certificate to 
the Certificate revocation list (CRL). If a certificate is 
believed to be compromised, the most immediate action is to 
revoke it. This is done by adding the certificate to the Certificate 
revocation list (CRL). Systems and applications that check the 
CRL before establishing secure communications will then know 
not to trust the compromised certificate. 
Option A is incorrect. While requesting a new certificate may 
be necessary after revoking the compromised one, the 
immediate action should be revoking the potentially 
compromised certificate. 
	
 
1399

Option B is incorrect. Updating firewall rules, while essential 
for many security scenarios, doesn’t directly address the misuse 
of a potentially exposed certificate. 
Option D is incorrect. A vulnerability assessment is a broader 
action to identify weaknesses in the system. While valuable, it 
doesn’t directly address the issue of the compromised 
certificate. 
Question 429. DataFin, a financial analytics firm, experienced a 
minor fire incident in one of its server rooms. Fortunately, they 
had backups stored in another wing of the building, allowing for 
quick data recovery. However, management realizes that in a 
major disaster, both primary and backup data might be 
destroyed. To address this, which backup strategy should 
DataFin consider? 
(A)       Mirror Backup 
(B)       Local Storage Backup 
(C)       Incremental Backup 
(D)       Offsite Backup 
Explanation 429. Correct Answer: D. Offsite Backup. Offsite 
Backup involves storing backup data in a different geographical 
location from the primary data. This ensures that even if a 
disaster impacts the primary location, the backup remains safe 
and can be used for recovery. 
Option A is incorrect. Mirror Backup refers to a backup that is 
an exact copy of the source data. It doesn’t specify the 
geographic location of the backup. 
	
 
1400

Option B is incorrect. Local Storage Backup typically means 
backups are stored within the same physical premises or close 
vicinity of the primary data, which wouldn’t address DataFin’s 
concern of potential data loss in a major disaster. 
Option C is incorrect. Incremental Backup involves backing 
up only the data that has changed since the last backup, 
regardless of where it’s stored. It doesn’t address the concern of 
geographic separation. 
Question 430. An online retailer is considering various methods 
to protect its customers’ credit card information. Instead of 
storing the actual credit card numbers in their database, they opt 
for a solution that replaces the numbers with unrelated, random 
values. What is this method called? 
(A)       Symmetric encryption 
(B)       Digital watermarking 
(C)       Hashing 
(D)       Tokenization 
Explanation 430. Correct Answer: D. Tokenization. 
Tokenization is a method where sensitive data is replaced with 
non-sensitive substitutes, referred to as “tokens”. These tokens 
act as references to the original data but don’t contain the actual 
sensitive data, making it a preferred method for protecting 
credit card information in many retail environments. 
Option A is incorrect. Symmetric encryption is a method of 
encrypting data using a single key for both encryption and 
decryption. It changes the original data into a ciphered format 
but doesn’t replace it with random values as tokenization does. 
	
 
1401

Option B is incorrect. Digital watermarking embeds data into a 
digital signal, primarily for asserting rights or ownership and 
not for replacing sensitive data with random values. 
Option C is incorrect. Hashing converts input data into a 
fixed-length string of characters, which is typically a hash 
code. It doesn’t produce a random value that can be used as 
a reference back to the original data.  
Question 431. The IT team at TechnoCorp has noticed a 
consistent pattern over the last week where a particular server’s 
CPU usage spikes to 100% between 2:00 AM and 4:00 AM, a 
time when there’s typically minimal user activity. What could 
be the MOST probable reason for this? 
(A)       The server is automatically updating its software 
(B)       An employee is running a heavy computational task 
(C)       The server is undergoing a DDoS attack 
(D)       Malware is performing cryptomining activities 
Explanation 431. Correct Answer: D. Malware is 
performing cryptomining activities. Cryptomining malware 
often causes significant resource consumption, especially CPU 
usage. Attackers frequently schedule such activities during off-
peak hours to reduce the chance of detection. Given the 
consistent pattern of high CPU usage during off-hours, 
cryptomining malware is a probable cause. 
Option A is incorrect. While software updates can cause 
resource consumption, they typically don’t result in consistent, 
prolonged 100% CPU usage over multiple days. 
	
 
1402

Option B is incorrect. Though it’s possible an employee might 
be running a heavy task, the consistent pattern during odd hours 
makes it less likely compared to malicious activities. 
Option C is incorrect. While a DDoS attack can cause resource 
consumption, it wouldn’t specifically target CPU usage 
consistently during the same timeframe every night. 
Question 432. A journalist wants to send a confidential message 
to her editor without raising suspicion. Instead of sending a 
coded or encrypted text, she embeds the message within a 
harmless-looking photograph. What method is she employing to 
keep the message concealed? 
(A)       Digital signature 
(B)       Tunneling 
(C)       Steganography 
(D)       Chaining 
Explanation 432. Correct Answer: C. Steganography. 
Steganography is a technique used to conceal data within 
another piece of data. In this scenario, the journalist is 
embedding a confidential message within a photograph, making 
it look harmless and unsuspicious. 
Option A is incorrect. A digital signature is used to verify the 
authenticity and integrity of a message or document. It doesn’t 
hide information within another piece of data. 
Option B is incorrect. Tunneling is a method used to 
encapsulate one protocol within another, typically used in VPNs 
to transport data over a public network. 
	
 
1403

Option D is incorrect. Chaining in the context of cryptography 
often refers to modes of operation like Cipher Block Chaining 
(CBC). It doesn’t involve hiding data within other data. 
Question 433. Ella, a security analyst, is reviewing the logs of a 
web application and notices that an attacker attempted to use the 
following input in a login form: ' OR '1'='1' --. This input was 
used in an effort to manipulate the application’s backend 
database. What type of injection attack is this an example of? 
(A)       XML Injection 
(B)       Command Injection 
(C)       SQL Injection 
(D)       LDAP Injection 
Explanation 433. Correct Answer: C. SQL Injection. The 
input ' OR '1'='1' -- is a classic example of an SQL injection 
attack. Attackers use this technique to manipulate SQL queries 
in applications that do not properly validate user input, 
potentially allowing unauthorized access or data retrieval. 
Option A is incorrect. XML Injection targets applications that 
parse XML input. The payload mentioned in the scenario is not 
related to XML structures. 
Option B is incorrect. Command Injection is when an attacker 
attempts to execute arbitrary commands on a host operating 
system. The given input is not an OS command. 
Option D is incorrect. LDAP Injection targets applications that 
construct LDAP statements based on user input. The given 
payload is not structured for LDAP queries. 
	
 
1404

Question 434. During a security audit, it was found that an 
application was using plain hashes for storing passwords. The 
security team recommended a method that involves using the 
original password along with a salt and then rehashing it 
multiple times. What is this method known as? 
(A)       Key clustering 
(B)       Rainbow table prevention 
(C)       Key rotation 
(D)       Key stretching 
Explanation 434. Correct Answer: D. Key stretching. Key 
stretching refers to the process of taking a password and, 
usually in combination with a salt, hashing it multiple times. 
This repeated hashing process makes brute-force attacks more 
time-consuming and difficult because the attacker has to not 
only guess the password but also apply the hashing function the 
same number of times the original process used. 
Option A is incorrect. Key clustering pertains to different keys 
producing the same ciphertext from the same plaintext, which is 
not relevant to the described scenario. 
Option B is incorrect. While using salts can prevent the 
effective use of rainbow tables, the act of rehashing passwords 
multiple times is not specifically called “rainbow table 
prevention.” 
Option C is incorrect. Key rotation involves periodically 
changing cryptographic keys. It does not relate to hashing 
passwords multiple times. 
	
 
1405

Question 435. A university’s IT department provides access to 
its student records for training purposes to new hires. To protect 
student identities, they replace the real names and social 
security numbers with fictitious ones while maintaining the 
database’s original format. Which technique is the IT 
department utilizing? 
(A)       Digital signing 
(B)       Data masking 
(C)       Steganography 
(D)       Data deduplication 
Explanation 435. Correct Answer: B. Data masking. Data 
masking protects the data subject’s data privacy by obscuring 
specific data within a database, making the data unreadable and 
unusable, especially in non-production environments. It is 
commonly used for testing and development purposes. 
Option A is incorrect. Digital signing involves using a digital 
signature to prove the authenticity and integrity of data. 
Option C is incorrect. Steganography involves hiding 
information within other information, such as embedding text 
within images, making it undetectable. 
Option D is incorrect. Data deduplication is the process of 
eliminating duplicate copies of repeating data to save storage 
space. 
Question 436. StreamNet, a popular online streaming service, is 
planning to launch in three new countries. They anticipate a 
substantial increase in users and concurrent streams. To ensure 
	
 
1406

that the service remains uninterrupted and provides a seamless 
experience to new users, which action related to capacity 
planning should StreamNet prioritize? 
(A)       Investing in content encryption and DRM 
(B)       Increasing marketing and promotional activities in the 
new countries 
(C)       Implementing stronger user authentication methods 
(D)       Expanding and optimizing their infrastructure to 
handle the projected growth 
Explanation 436. Correct Answer: D. Expanding and 
optimizing their infrastructure to handle the projected 
growth. Infrastructure capacity planning will allow StreamNet 
to predict the necessary resources required and make the needed 
upgrades or adjustments to their servers, networks, storage, and 
other infrastructure components. This ensures a smooth user 
experience even with the influx of new users. 
Option A is incorrect. While content encryption and DRM 
(Digital Rights Management) are essential for protecting 
content, they don’t address the infrastructure capacity needed to 
handle more users. 
Option B is incorrect. Marketing and promotional activities 
can attract users but don’t directly impact the infrastructure’s 
capacity to support those users. 
Option C is incorrect. Stronger authentication methods can 
improve security but don’t address the capacity or scalability of 
the infrastructure.

Question 437. The IT department of an e-commerce company 
is configuring access controls for a new online product 
inventory system. They want the sales team to update the 
inventory levels and product details but don’t want them to 
access financial data stored in the same system. Which access 
control principle is the IT department applying? 
(A)       Least Privilege 
(B)       Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 
(C)       Mandatory Access Control (MAC) 
(D)       User-Based Access Control (UBAC) 
Explanation 437. Correct Answer: B. Role-Based Access 
Control (RBAC). Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) assigns 
permissions based on roles within an organization. Individuals 
are then assigned roles, and the permissions associated with that 
role determine what they can and cannot access. In this 
scenario, the sales team would be given a role that allows them 
to update inventory but restricts access to financial data. 
Option A is incorrect. While the principle of Least Privilege 
dictates that users should only be given the minimal necessary 
access to perform their tasks, the scenario specifically focuses 
on roles (sales team) and the permissions associated with that 
role, which aligns more with RBAC. 
Option C is incorrect. Mandatory Access Control (MAC) uses 
labels (e.g., classification levels) to determine access. It’s more 
rigid than RBAC and isn’t described in the given scenario. 
Option D is incorrect. User-Based Access Control (UBAC) 
assigns permissions directly to each user, rather than based on 
	
 
1408

their role. The scenario emphasizes role-based permissions, 
making RBAC the appropriate choice. 
Question 438. The IT department of XYZ Corp noticed that 
server logs are recording user login attempts during non-
business hours, specifically between 2:00 AM and 3:00 AM, a 
time when no scheduled tasks or backups are set to run. Which 
of the following is the MOST plausible explanation for this 
unusual activity? 
(A)       The company's employees are working overtime 
(B)       There might be a time zone misconfiguration on the 
server 
(C)       An unauthorized user is trying to gain access to the 
server 
(D)       The server is automatically installing security patches 
Explanation 438. Correct Answer: C. An unauthorized user 
is trying to gain access to the server. Out-of-cycle logging that 
occurs during unusual hours, especially when no scheduled 
tasks are set, can be a significant indicator of malicious activity. 
In this scenario, the logging of user login attempts during non-
business hours suggests an unauthorized user might be 
attempting access. 
Option A is incorrect. While employees might occasionally 
work overtime, regular login attempts specifically between 2:00 
AM and 3:00 AM are suspicious. 
Option B is incorrect. A time zone misconfiguration might 
cause time discrepancies in logs, but it wouldn’t result in 
repeated login attempts. 
	
 
1409

Option D is incorrect. Automatic security patch installations 
wouldn’t result in user login attempts. 
Question 439. A financial institution processes thousands of 
credit card transactions daily. To ensure the security and 
integrity of these transactions, the security officer wants to 
employ a solution that will safely manage and store 
cryptographic keys. Which of the following would be the 
MOST suitable solution? 
(A)       Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 
(B)       Full Disk Encryption (FDE) 
(C)       Hardware Security Module (HSM) 
(D)       Software Key Repository 
Explanation 439. Correct Answer: C. Hardware Security 
Module (HSM). Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) are 
physical devices specifically designed to manage, process, and 
store cryptographic keys. They provide a high level of 
protection against both physical and logical attacks and are 
commonly used by financial institutions to ensure the security 
of high-value transactions. 
Option A is incorrect. While TPMs provide hardware-level 
security for individual devices, they are not designed for the 
high-capacity cryptographic needs of an institution processing 
numerous transactions. 
Option B is incorrect. Full Disk Encryption (FDE) secures data 
at rest on a hard drive but doesn’t specifically manage 
cryptographic keys used in transaction processing. 
	
 
1410

Option D is incorrect. While a software key repository can 
store cryptographic keys, it lacks the same level of physical and 
logical protection provided by an HSM. 
Question 440. XYZ Corp recently faced a ransomware attack 
that encrypted critical data files. The company’s IT team was 
unable to decrypt the files but had a recent backup available. 
However, when they tried to restore the data, they found out the 
backup was corrupted. Which of the following best practices 
would have helped XYZ Corp in ensuring the integrity of their 
backups? 
(A)       Regularly testing backup restoration processes 
(B)       Storing backups in the same directory as original files 
(C)       Increasing the frequency of backups to every hour 
(D)       Encrypting backups with a strong encryption algorithm 
Explanation 440. Correct Answer: A. Regularly testing 
backup restoration processes. By regularly testing the 
restoration process from backups, organizations can identify and 
correct any issues with the backup files or processes before they 
are needed in a critical recovery situation. 
Option B is incorrect. Storing backups in the same directory as 
the original files increases the risk of both the original and 
backup files being compromised or corrupted simultaneously. 
Option C is incorrect. While increasing the frequency of 
backups can reduce data loss, it doesn’t address the integrity or 
validity of the backups themselves. 
	
 
1411

Option D is incorrect. While encrypting backups provides 
security against unauthorized access, it doesn’t ensure the 
integrity or usability of the backup. 
Question 441. An e-commerce company stores millions of 
customer transaction records in their primary database. They 
have decided to enhance their security posture by applying 
encryption to protect sensitive data. However, they don’t want 
to encrypt the entire server storage, just the data within the 
database. Which encryption approach should the company adopt 
to meet their objective? 
(A)       Full-disk Encryption 
(B)       File-level Encryption 
(C)       Volume-level Encryption 
(D)       Database-level Encryption 
Explanation 441. Correct Answer: D. Database-level 
Encryption. Database-level Encryption provides encryption 
specifically for data within a database. It ensures that the data 
remains encrypted even when backed up, replicated, or moved. 
This approach is ideal for the e-commerce company as it 
focuses on encrypting the sensitive transaction records without 
affecting other data on the server. 
Option A is incorrect. Full-disk Encryption would encrypt the 
entire server’s storage, which may not be required by the 
company. 
Option B is incorrect. File-level Encryption would require 
encrypting individual files, which may not be efficient for a 
database with millions of records. 
	
 
1412

Option C is incorrect. Volume-level Encryption encrypts 
specific volumes or logical drives, not just the database data. 
Question 442. A database administrator is concerned about 
identical hashes being produced for users who select the same 
password. To mitigate this risk, what cryptographic technique 
should the administrator implement? 
(A)       Digital signature 
(B)       Salting 
(C)       Key stretching 
(D)       Symmetric encryption 
Explanation 442. Correct Answer: B. Salting. Salting 
involves adding a random value to a password before hashing it. 
This ensures that even if two users have the same password, 
their hashes will be different because of the unique salts. This 
makes it difficult for attackers to use precomputed tables (like 
rainbow tables) to match hashes to possible plaintext passwords. 
Option A is incorrect. Digital signatures are primarily used to 
ensure the authenticity and integrity of a message or data, not 
for hashing passwords. 
Option C is incorrect. Key stretching involves repeating the 
hashing process multiple times to make brute-force attacks 
more challenging, but it doesn’t address the problem of identical 
hashes for identical passwords. 
Option D is incorrect. Symmetric encryption uses the same 
key for both encryption and decryption and isn’t related to the 
scenario of producing unique hashes for passwords. 
	
 
1413

Question 443. After a recent data breach, a multinational 
corporation is evaluating its cryptographic practices. The Chief 
Security Officer (CSO) determines that the manual management 
of cryptographic keys has become too complex due to the scale 
of the operations. Which tool would BEST address the CSO’s 
concern while ensuring robust security practices? 
(A)       Password Management System 
(B)       Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) 
(C)       Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 
(D)       Key Management System (KMS) 
Explanation 443. Correct Answer: D. Key Management 
System (KMS). A Key Management System (KMS) is 
specifically designed to handle the generation, distribution, 
rotation, and retirement of cryptographic keys in a centralized 
and automated manner. For large organizations, using a KMS 
streamlines and secures the complex task of key management. 
Option A is incorrect. While a Password Management System 
helps in handling and storing passwords, it does not provide 
comprehensive features needed for cryptographic key 
management. 
Option B is incorrect. SFTP is a protocol for securely 
transferring files over a network, not for managing 
cryptographic keys. 
Option C is incorrect. While TPM provides hardware-level 
security for individual devices, it is not meant for enterprise-
wide key management. 
	
 
1414

Question 444. After a security incident, a forensic investigation 
revealed that a compromised internal workstation was 
communicating with a known malicious IP address. To prevent 
further communication, the security team decided to take 
immediate action. Which of the following is the BEST 
immediate action to ensure the workstation cannot communicate 
with that IP? 
(A)       Implement a block rule on the web filter for the IP 
address 
(B)       Disable the network port of the compromised 
workstation 
(C)       Use a honeypot to divert the traffic from the malicious 
(D)       Update the firewall's firmware 
Explanation 444. Correct Answer: A. Implement a block 
rule on the web filter for the IP address. By implementing a 
block rule specifically for the known malicious IP address on 
the web filter, any attempt to communicate with that IP would 
be stopped, effectively preventing further malicious 
communications. 
Option B is incorrect. Disabling the network port of the 
compromised workstation would disconnect the machine from 
the network, but it wouldn’t specifically prevent communication 
with the malicious IP if the port were to be re-enabled. 
Option C is incorrect. While honeypots can be used to divert 
or study attacker behavior, they are not the most direct way to 
block communication with a known malicious IP address. 
	
 
1415

Option D is incorrect. Updating the firewall’s firmware is a 
general maintenance task and does not specifically address 
blocking communications with the known malicious IP. 
Question 445. Jennifer, an IT administrator, is asked to onboard 
a new remote employee for a sales role. Which of the following 
is the BEST approach for provisioning the user account? 
(A)       Assign the new user the same access privileges as the 
CEO because they might require all resources 
(B)       Provide the new user with administrative rights to 
ensure they can install and configure any needed software 
(C)       Use the access privileges from a template of a 
salesperson to provide the required resources 
(D)       Allow the new user to decide and self-select the 
necessary access based on their job role 
Explanation 445. Correct Answer: C. Use the access 
privileges from a template of a salesperson to provide the 
required resources. Provisioning users based on role templates 
ensures that users have just the access they need, adhering to the 
principle of least privilege. 
Option A is incorrect. This goes against the principle of least 
privilege and can introduce significant security risks. 
Option B is incorrect. Giving administrative rights to 
employees without a proper need can expose the organization to 
unnecessary risks. 
	
 
1416

Option D is incorrect. Users should not self-select access 
rights as they might not be aware of potential security 
implications. 
Question 446. The IT department of a large organization 
receives reports from employees that they are unable to access 
certain resources on the network. Upon investigation, the IT 
department discovers that the Access Control List (ACL) 
settings have been recently modified. Which of the following 
would be the PRIMARY reason to review and modify the ACL 
settings? 
(A)       To balance the network load 
(B)       To update the organization's firewall rules. 
(C)       To ensure appropriate access rights to resources 
(D)       To update the organization's password policy 
Explanation 446. Correct Answer: C. To ensure appropriate 
access rights to resources. ACLs are essential tools in 
determining who has access to which resources within a 
network or system. Regularly reviewing and modifying the 
ACL settings ensures that users have the appropriate access 
rights, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring that 
authorized users can access the resources they need. 
Option A is incorrect. While network load balancing is crucial, 
it is not directly related to ACLs. ACLs focus on access control, 
not traffic distribution. 
Option B is incorrect. Firewall rules are different from ACLs. 
While they can work together, firewall rules primarily focus on 
	
 
1417

allowing or blocking network traffic, while ACLs determine 
access permissions to resources. 
Option D is incorrect. While updating the organization’s 
password policy is a vital security measure, it is not related to 
ACLs, which control access to resources based on user or group 
permissions. 
Question 447. TechWorld Corp is concerned about 
cybercriminals sending emails that appear to come from its 
domain to deceive its clients. The company wants to implement 
a solution that would allow receiving email servers to validate 
that an email claiming to come from TechWorld Corp’s domain 
indeed originates from an approved server. Which of the 
following should the company implement? 
(A)       SMTP authentication 
(B)       DKIM 
(C)       POP3 over SSL 
(D)       S/MIME 
Explanation 447. Correct Answer: B. DKIM. DomainKeys 
Identified Mail (DKIM) is a method used to authenticate the 
origin and integrity of an email. With DKIM, a digital signature 
is added to the headers of outgoing emails. Receiving email 
servers then use this signature to validate the email by checking 
it against the sending domain’s public key, which is published in 
the DNS records. 
Option A is incorrect. SMTP authentication ensures that users 
provide valid credentials before they can send emails through a 
	
 
1418

server, but it doesn’t validate the domain of the sender to the 
receiver. 
Option C is incorrect. POP3 over SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) 
is about securely retrieving email messages from a server. It 
doesn’t provide a way to authenticate the sender’s domain. 
Option D is incorrect. S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet 
Mail Extensions) is used to encrypt and sign email messages. 
While it ensures the integrity and confidentiality of the email 
content, it does not validate the sender’s domain to the recipient. 
Question 448. A cloud-based collaboration tool used by a 
company displays a warning to a user stating, “You are logged 
in from two locations.” However, the user has only one active 
session on their workstation. What should be the primary 
concern for the security team? 
(A)       The user might be using multiple devices 
(B)       There's a potential misconfiguration in the tool's settings 
(C)       The collaboration tool is facing an outage 
(D)       There might be unauthorized access to the user's 
account 
Explanation 448. Correct Answer: D. There might be 
unauthorized access to the user’s account. Warnings of 
concurrent sessions, especially when the user is certain they’re 
using only one device, are red flags for potential unauthorized 
access. The security team should treat this as a priority and 
investigate for signs of a breach. 
	
 
1419

Option A is incorrect. While users often use multiple devices, 
the scenario mentions the user is certain they have only one 
active session, making this option unlikely. 
Option B is incorrect. While misconfigurations can cause 
various issues, they don’t typically manifest as false concurrent 
session warnings. 
Option C is incorrect. An outage in the collaboration tool 
would not typically cause a false warning of multiple active 
sessions. 
Question 449. A company is looking for a cryptographic 
solution that provides an immutable and transparent record of 
all transactions in a distributed ledger system. Which of the 
following would BEST meet this requirement? 
(A)       Symmetric key algorithm 
(B)       Public key infrastructure 
(C)       Blockchain 
(D)       Digital watermark 
Explanation 449. Correct Answer: C. Blockchain. 
Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger technology 
that provides an immutable record of transactions. Each block 
contains a list of transactions and is linked to the previous 
block, creating a chain. The transparency and immutability of 
blockchain make it especially suitable for applications where an 
irrefutable record is essential. 
Option A is incorrect. Symmetric key algorithms are 
encryption methods where the same key is used for both 
	
 
1420

encryption and decryption but don’t inherently provide an 
immutable record of transactions. 
Option B is incorrect. Public key infrastructure (PKI) is used 
for digital certificates and keys distribution but doesn’t offer an 
immutable record of transactions. 
Option D is incorrect. Digital watermarking embeds 
information into a digital signal, but it doesn’t provide an 
immutable record of transactions. 
Question 450. TechCorp is collaborating with SoftTech, a 
business partner. To streamline collaboration without managing 
multiple accounts, TechCorp wants its employees to use their 
existing credentials to access SoftTech’s online project 
management system. Which of the following approaches would 
BEST enable this functionality? 
(A)       TechCorp should create new accounts for its employees 
on SoftTech's system 
(B)       SoftTech should allow anonymous access for 
TechCorp's employees 
(C)       TechCorp should implement federation between its 
identity provider and SoftTech's service provider 
(D)       SoftTech should reset all passwords and provide them to 
TechCorp's employees 
Explanation 450. Correct Answer: C. TechCorp should 
implement federation between its identity provider and 
SoftTech’s service provider. Federation allows two 
organizations to trust each other’s identity systems. TechCorp’s 
	
 
1421

employees can use their existing credentials to access services 
on SoftTech’s system without the need to create new accounts. 
Option A is incorrect. Creating new accounts for every user in 
a collaborating organization isn’t scalable and negates the 
advantages of federation. 
Option B is incorrect. Allowing anonymous access would 
compromise security and wouldn’t guarantee identity 
verification. 
Option D is incorrect. Resetting all passwords and providing 
them anew is not a practical or secure approach to collaboration 
between two organizations. 
Question 451. GlobalTech is implementing a disaster recovery 
plan and wants to ensure continuous availability with no data 
loss. They have decided to use replication as a backup strategy. 
Which of the following replication techniques should 
GlobalTech implement to achieve their objective? 
(A)       Periodic replication scheduled daily 
(B)       Asynchronous replication with hourly synchronization 
(C)       Synchronous replication 
(D)       Snapshot replication every 30 minutes 
Explanation 451. Correct Answer: C. Synchronous 
replication. Synchronous replication ensures that data is written 
to the primary and secondary locations simultaneously, ensuring 
no data loss and continuous availability. This method is suitable 
for GlobalTech’s requirement of no data loss. 
	
 
1422

Option A is incorrect. Periodic replication scheduled daily 
could result in up to a day’s worth of data loss in the event of a 
disaster. 
Option B is incorrect. Asynchronous replication with hourly 
synchronization could lead to an hour’s worth of data loss if an 
incident occurs just before synchronization. 
Option D is incorrect. Snapshot replication every 30 minutes 
could result in 30 minutes of data loss in the event of an 
incident. 
Question 452. An e-commerce website suddenly experiences a 
sharp increase in traffic, causing the website to become slow 
and occasionally inaccessible. The IT team observes that a large 
number of requests are originating from multiple IP addresses 
spread across various countries. What type of network attack is 
the e-commerce website likely experiencing? 
(A)       Man-in-the-middle attack 
(B)       DNS spoofing 
(C)       Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack 
(D)       ARP poisoning 
Explanation 452. Correct Answer: C. Distributed denial-of-
service (DDoS) attack. In a DDoS attack, the attacker uses 
multiple systems, often compromised ones from different 
locations, to flood a target system with requests, making the 
target slow or inaccessible. 
Option A is incorrect. A man-in-the-middle attack involves an 
attacker secretly intercepting and possibly altering the 
	
 
1423

communication between two parties. It doesn’t lead to website 
inaccessibility due to high traffic. 
Option B is incorrect. DNS spoofing is when an attacker 
introduces corrupt DNS cache information to redirect traffic to a 
different IP address, usually under the attacker’s control. It 
doesn’t cause increased traffic from various countries. 
Option D is incorrect. ARP poisoning is a technique by which 
an attacker sends fake ARP messages onto a local area network. 
This is usually used to link an attacker’s MAC address with the 
IP address of another host, causing any traffic meant for that IP 
address to be sent to the attacker instead. 
Question 453. A software development company is working on 
a mobile banking application. They want to ensure that sensitive 
operations like cryptographic processes and biometric data 
validation are isolated from the main operating system to 
prevent potential tampering. Which tool should they consider 
implementing to achieve this objective? 
(A)       Hardware Security Module (HSM) 
(B)       Key Management System (KMS) 
(C)       Secure enclave 
(D)       Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 
Explanation 453. Correct Answer: C. Secure enclave. A 
secure enclave is a hardware-based isolated environment often 
found in modern CPUs, especially in mobile devices. It’s 
designed to run specific operations such as cryptographic 
processes and biometric data validation, ensuring that this data 
	
 
1424

is kept isolated from the main operating system, making it 
resilient to tampering. 
Option A is incorrect. While an HSM is a dedicated hardware 
device that manages cryptographic keys, it doesn’t provide the 
isolated environment within a CPU for operations like the 
secure enclave does. 
Option B is incorrect. KMS is primarily focused on the 
management of cryptographic keys, not on creating isolated 
environments for operations. 
Option D is incorrect. TPM provides hardware-level security 
for individual devices, but it doesn’t create a segregated 
environment within the CPU for operations like the secure 
enclave. 
Question 454. A popular social media platform allows third-
party applications to access user data and post on behalf of 
users. To avoid sharing user passwords with third-party 
applications and provide limited, scoped access, which 
authentication method should the platform use? 
(A)       Embed user passwords in the application's code 
(B)       Use basic authentication with username and password 
for every request 
(C)       Implement Single Sign-On (SSO) using OAuth to 
provide token-based access 
(D)       Rely solely on CAPTCHA for third-party app 
authentication 
	
 
1425

Explanation 454. Correct Answer: C. Implement Single 
Sign-On (SSO) using OAuth to provide token-based access. 
OAuth provides token-based access and lets third-party 
applications operate on behalf of users without exposing user 
passwords. OAuth tokens can also be scoped to limit the range 
of actions a third-party application can perform. 
Option A is incorrect. Embedding passwords in application 
code is insecure and goes against best practices. 
Option B is incorrect. Basic authentication exposes user 
credentials and doesn’t offer the scoped access OAuth provides. 
Option D is incorrect. CAPTCHA is designed to differentiate 
between human and automated access but doesn’t handle 
authentication or authorization. 
Question 455. A company has noticed an increase in malware 
infections over the past month. After investigating, it was 
determined that the infections were caused by employees 
visiting websites that were newly registered but had malicious 
intent. Which of the following would be the BEST approach to 
mitigate this threat? 
(A)       Implement a block rule to deny access to all websites 
(B)       Use a web filter that incorporates domain reputation 
checks and blocks domains registered recently 
(C)       Set the web filter to block all websites not categorized 
as "Business" 
(D)       Enforce multi-factor authentication for all internet-
based applications 
	
 
1426

Explanation 455. Correct Answer: B. Use a web filter that 
incorporates domain reputation checks and blocks domains 
registered recently. Reputation-based web filters can evaluate 
the trustworthiness of domains. One common heuristic is to be 
suspicious of newly registered domains, as cybercriminals often 
use these for phishing or malware distribution. 
Option A is incorrect. Blocking access to all websites is an 
extreme measure that would hinder business operations and 
employee productivity. 
Option C is incorrect. Simply blocking websites not 
categorized as “Business” does not specifically target the threat 
of newly registered malicious domains. Additionally, some 
business-relevant websites might not be categorized properly. 
Option D is incorrect. While multi-factor authentication can 
enhance security, it does not address the threat of employees 
visiting malicious websites. 
.Question 456. MetroTech recently experienced an incident 
where an employee mistakenly deleted a portion of their 
database. The IT team was able to restore the data using a 
backup snapshot taken 24 hours prior. However, some data loss 
still occurred. Which of the following recommendations would 
minimize data loss in a similar situation in the future? 
(A)       Configure backup snapshots to be taken on a weekly 
basis 
(B)       Employ a differential backup solution in addition to 
snapshots 
	
 
1427

(C)       Increase the storage capacity for backups 
(D)       Use an hourly snapshot backup schedule 
Explanation 456. Correct Answer: D. Use an hourly 
snapshot backup schedule. Increasing the frequency of 
snapshot backups, such as taking them every hour, will ensure 
that the maximum amount of data that can be lost is limited to 
that hour’s worth. This minimizes the potential for data loss 
compared to a 24-hour window. 
Option A is incorrect. Taking weekly snapshots would actually 
increase the potential data loss window, not decrease it. 
Option B is incorrect. While differential backups capture data 
changes since the last full backup, they don’t necessarily reduce 
the time window for potential data loss like increasing snapshot 
frequency would. 
Option C is incorrect. Increasing storage capacity allows for 
more backups or longer retention but does not in itself reduce 
the time window for potential data loss. 
Question 457. Alice receives an email from Bob with an 
attached document. She wants to verify both the authenticity of 
the sender and the integrity of the attached document. Which of 
the following should Bob have used before sending the email? 
(A)       Encrypt the document with his private key 
(B)       Hash the document 
(C)       Encrypt the document with Alice's public key 
(D)       Sign the document with his private key 
	
 
1428

Explanation 457. Correct Answer: D. Sign the document 
with his private key. Digital signatures are created by taking a 
hash of a message (or document) and then encrypting that hash 
with the sender’s private key. When Alice receives the email, 
she can decrypt the signature using Bob’s public key to retrieve 
the original hash and then compare it with her computed hash of 
the document. If they match, it confirms both the sender’s 
identity (authenticity) and that the document has not been 
altered (integrity). 
Option A is incorrect. Encrypting the entire document with his 
private key isn’t practical for verifying authenticity and 
integrity. Instead, the hash of the document is encrypted to 
create a signature. 
Option B is incorrect. Simply hashing the document will 
provide a way to check the document’s integrity but does not 
verify the authenticity of the sender. 
Option C is incorrect. Encrypting the document with Alice’s 
public key would make it confidential for Alice, but this doesn’t 
help in verifying authenticity or integrity. 
Question 458. An international company, GlobalTech, is using 
several web applications hosted by different vendors. To ensure 
their employees can access these applications without having to 
remember multiple sets of credentials, they want to implement a 
solution that can securely exchange user authentication 
information between the company and the service providers. 
What should GlobalTech implement? 
(A)       Integrate each application with an independent LDAP 
	
 
1429

server 
(B)       Implement SSO using Security Assertions Markup 
Language (SAML) 
(C)       Embed encrypted user credentials within the URL of 
each application 
(D)       Rely on public API keys shared between the company 
and each vendor 
Explanation 458. Correct Answer: B. Implement SSO using 
Security Assertions Markup Language (SAML). SAML is an 
XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and 
authorization data between parties. It’s designed to facilitate 
single sign-on for web applications. By implementing SSO with 
SAML, GlobalTech can allow its employees to authenticate 
once and gain access to multiple applications without re-
authenticating. 
Option A is incorrect. Having independent LDAP servers for 
each application defeats the purpose of SSO and complicates 
user management. 
Option C is incorrect. Embedding encrypted user credentials 
in URLs is insecure and not a recommended practice. 
Option D is incorrect. API keys are used for system-to-system 
communication and not for user authentication. Moreover, 
public API keys shouldn’t be shared recklessly.  
Question 459. A user wants to send a confidential email to their 
colleague and ensure that only the intended recipient can read it. 
The user also wants to provide assurance to the recipient that 
	
 
1430

the email was indeed sent by them. Which encryption method 
should the user employ to accomplish this? 
(A)       Use symmetric encryption with a shared key 
(B)       Use asymmetric encryption and encrypt the email with 
the recipient's public key 
(C)       Use asymmetric encryption, encrypt the email with the 
user's private key 
(D)       Use asymmetric encryption, first sign the email with 
the user's private key, then encrypt it with the recipient's 
public key 
Explanation 459. Correct Answer: D. Use asymmetric 
encryption, first sign the email with the user’s private key, 
then encrypt it with the recipient’s public key. 
Option D offers both confidentiality and non-repudiation. 
The email is encrypted with the recipient’s public key, ensuring 
only the recipient can decrypt it using their private key. Signing 
the email with the sender’s private key allows the recipient to 
verify the sender using the sender’s public key. 
Option A is incorrect. While symmetric encryption provides 
confidentiality, it doesn’t offer non-repudiation or sender 
verification. 
Option B is incorrect. Encrypting with the recipient’s public 
key provides confidentiality but lacks sender verification. 
Option C is incorrect. Encrypting an email with the user’s 
private key would offer sender verification but won’t provide 
confidentiality.

Question 460. DigitalFront, an e-commerce company, is 
expecting a surge in traffic during their upcoming annual sale 
event. They want to ensure that their website and applications 
can handle the anticipated increase in user activity without any 
performance degradation. Which of the following steps is 
MOST relevant to achieving this goal? 
(A)       Increasing the frequency of security audits 
(B)       Implementing capacity planning specifically focused 
on technology 
(C)       Adopting multi-factor authentication for all users 
(D)       Investing in advanced threat intelligence solutions 
Explanation 460. Correct Answer: B. Implementing 
capacity planning specifically focused on technology. 
Capacity planning with a focus on technology ensures that all 
technological resources, such as servers, bandwidth, storage, 
and software, are adequately prepared to handle the expected 
increase in load or traffic, ensuring smooth performance during 
peak periods. 
Option A is incorrect. Security audits are important for 
identifying vulnerabilities, but they don’t address the direct 
need for scaling technology resources to manage increased 
traffic. 
Option C is incorrect. Multi-factor authentication improves 
security for users but does not aid in handling a surge in website 
traffic or user activity. 
	
 
1432

Option D is incorrect. Advanced threat intelligence solutions 
provide insights into potential threats, but they don’t address 
technology scaling to accommodate increased traffic. 
Question 461. Sarah, a security analyst, is concerned about 
potential man-in-the-middle attacks on the company’s internal 
portal. To mitigate this risk, she recommends obtaining a digital 
certificate from a trusted entity. Which of the following is 
responsible for issuing such certificates? 
(A)       Key distribution center 
(B)       Certificate authority (CA) 
(C)       Tokenization system 
(D)       Security incident event manager 
Explanation 461. Correct Answer: B. Certificate authority 
(CA). Certificate authorities (CAs) are trusted entities 
responsible for issuing, validating, and revoking digital 
certificates. These certificates are used to authenticate entities 
on the internet, such as websites, ensuring secure and 
authenticated communications, thus mitigating the risk of man-
in-the-middle attacks. 
Option A is incorrect. A Key distribution center (KDC) is a 
part of the Kerberos authentication protocol and is responsible 
for distributing session tickets and temporary session keys, not 
for issuing digital certificates. 
Option C is incorrect. Tokenization systems replace sensitive 
data with non-sensitive substitutes, known as tokens. They don’t 
issue digital certificates. 
	
 
1433

Option D is incorrect. A Security incident event manager 
(SIEM) aggregates and analyzes log data from various sources, 
providing real-time analysis of security alerts, but does not issue 
certificates. 
Question 462. A security analyst discovers that an external IP 
address has been repeatedly trying every possible combination 
of characters to gain access to the company’s VPN portal for the 
past two days. Which type of password attack is this MOST 
likely describing? 
(A)       Password Spraying 
(B)       Dictionary Attack 
(C)       Rainbow Table Attack 
(D)       Brute Force Attack 
Explanation 462. Correct Answer: D. Brute Force Attack. A 
Brute Force Attack involves systematically trying every 
possible combination of characters until the correct one is 
found. The scenario specifies that every possible combination of 
characters is being tried on the VPN portal, indicating a brute 
force attack. 
Option A is incorrect. Password Spraying involves trying a 
few commonly used passwords across multiple accounts, rather 
than all possible combinations on one account. 
Option B is incorrect. A Dictionary Attack uses a list of 
common or previously used passwords to attempt access. It 
doesn’t involve trying every possible combination. 
	
 
1434

Option C is incorrect. A Rainbow Table Attack uses 
precomputed tables for reversing cryptographic hash functions. 
This scenario doesn’t mention hash values or the use of such 
tables. 
Question 463. A graphic design company frequently works with 
large files such as videos and high-resolution images. These 
files are stored on a dedicated storage volume in their server. 
While they need to secure this data, they don’t want to encrypt 
individual files due to the volume of data and frequent access 
needs. Which encryption approach is most appropriate for this 
scenario? 
(A)       File-level Encryption 
(B)       Full-disk Encryption 
(C)       Transport-layer Encryption 
(D)       Volume-level Encryption 
Explanation 463. Correct Answer: D. Volume-level 
Encryption. Volume-level Encryption allows the encryption of 
a specific volume or logical drive. In this case, it would allow 
the company to encrypt the entire volume where these large 
files are stored without having to encrypt individual files. This 
ensures the entire volume’s contents are encrypted while 
providing seamless access when required. 
Option A is incorrect. File-level Encryption, while effective, 
would be tedious for encrypting numerous large files 
individually. 
	
 
1435

Option B is incorrect. Full-disk Encryption would encrypt the 
entire disk, which may not be necessary if only a specific 
volume requires encryption. 
Option C is incorrect. Transport-layer Encryption pertains to 
data in transit and doesn’t address the need of encrypting stored 
data at the volume level. 
Question 464. Sarah is a project manager and is working on a 
document that she owns. She wants to grant specific 
permissions to certain team members, allowing some to edit and 
others only to view the document. Which of the following 
access control models would BEST allow Sarah to accomplish 
this? 
(A)       Mandatory Access Control (MAC) 
(B)       Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 
(C)       Discretionary Access Control (DAC) 
(D)       Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) 
Explanation 464. Correct Answer: C. Discretionary Access 
Control (DAC). DAC allows the owner of the resource (in this 
case, Sarah) to specify who can access it and what permissions 
they have (e.g., read, write, execute). This flexibility is what 
Sarah needs to grant specific permissions to individual team 
members based on her discretion. 
Option A is incorrect. Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is 
based on classifications and clearance levels. It wouldn’t be 
suitable for Sarah’s needs in this scenario. 
	
 
1436

Option B is incorrect. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 
assigns permissions based on roles in the organization. It 
wouldn’t allow Sarah the fine-grained control she needs over 
individual permissions. 
Option D is incorrect. Attribute-Based Access Control 
(ABAC) bases access on attributes of the user, environment, 
and resource itself. While flexible, it’s not centered around the 
owner’s discretion in the same way DAC is. 
Question 465. MegaCorp is transitioning to a cloud-based 
infrastructure and wants to allow its employees to access 
multiple cloud services without re-entering their credentials 
every time. They currently have an on-premises LDAP directory 
in place. Which approach should MegaCorp take to provide a 
seamless authentication experience? 
(A)       MegaCorp should abandon their LDAP directory and 
create individual accounts for each cloud service 
(B)       Integrate their LDAP with a Single Sign-On (SSO) 
solution that supports cloud services 
(C)       Store passwords in a plaintext file for users to access 
and login to cloud services manually 
(D)       Force users to change passwords every day to enhance 
security across all cloud platforms 
Explanation 465. Correct Answer: B. Integrate their LDAP 
with a Single Sign-On (SSO) solution that supports cloud 
services. By integrating the on-premises LDAP with an SSO 
solution, MegaCorp can leverage its existing user directory to 
authenticate and provide access to multiple cloud services 
without requiring users to log in separately for each service. 
	
 
1437

Option A is incorrect. Abandoning the existing LDAP 
directory would negate the benefits of central management and 
create administrative overhead. 
Option C is incorrect. Storing passwords in plaintext is a 
significant security risk and goes against best practices. 
Option D is incorrect. Forcing users to change passwords daily 
is impractical, could result in weaker passwords, and doesn’t 
provide a seamless authentication experience. 
Question 466. A global manufacturing company wants to 
ensure its employees worldwide do not access websites 
promoting hate speech, gambling, or explicit content during 
working hours. To meet this requirement, which web filtering 
technique would be the most efficient? 
(A)       Deploy a centralized proxy with location-based filtering 
(B)       Use a blacklist of specific URLs known to contain such 
content 
(C)       Implement content categorization and block 
undesired categories 
(D)       Monitor internet usage logs and reprimand violators 
Explanation 466. Correct Answer: C. Implement content 
categorization and block undesired categories. Content 
categorization is a technique where websites are categorized 
based on their content type, such as “gaming,” “social media,” 
“news,” etc. By using this technique, organizations can block 
entire categories of content, such as “hate speech” or 
“gambling,” ensuring broad coverage without the need to 
identify every problematic URL individually. 
	
 
1438

Option A is incorrect. While centralized proxies can help 
manage internet access, location-based filtering focuses more 
on geographic locations rather than content categories. 
Option B is incorrect. Relying solely on a blacklist can be 
inefficient, as it requires constant updates to catch every 
possible harmful URL, and it might not cover newly created 
sites quickly enough. 
Option D is incorrect. Simply monitoring internet usage logs 
and reprimanding violators is reactive and does not proactively 
prevent access to undesired content. 
Question 467. During an IT audit, a company’s encryption 
practices come under scrutiny. The IT auditor recommends 
increasing the encryption key length for certain applications to 
improve security. What is the PRIMARY reason to increase the 
encryption key length? 
(A)       To speed up encryption and decryption processes 
(B)       To ensure compatibility with older systems 
(C)       To reduce the possibility of a brute force attack 
(D)       To reduce the key management overhead 
Explanation 467. Correct Answer: C. To reduce the 
possibility of a brute force attack. Increasing the encryption 
key length primarily enhances the security of the encryption by 
making it more resistant to brute-force attacks. A brute force 
attack involves trying all possible key combinations, and a 
longer key length means exponentially more possible 
combinations, making the attack vastly more time-consuming 
and difficult. 
	
 
1439

Option A is incorrect. Longer key lengths generally slow down 
the encryption and decryption processes, as more computational 
power is required. 
Option B is incorrect. Increasing key length might make the 
encryption incompatible with older systems that do not support 
the newer, longer key lengths. 
Option D is incorrect. Key management overhead typically 
increases with longer key lengths, as more data must be 
managed and kept secure. 
Question 468. PharmaCorp, a pharmaceutical company, wants 
to ensure that its researchers cannot transfer proprietary 
formulas and research data to external storage devices or cloud 
storage. The company needs a solution to prevent such transfers 
while allowing other types of data to be transferred. What 
should they implement? 
(A)       Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
(B)       Data Encryption Tool 
(C)       Data Loss Prevention (DLP) 
(D)       Virtual Private Network (VPN) 
Explanation 468. Correct Answer: C. Data Loss Prevention 
(DLP). Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is designed to detect 
potential data breach attempts and prevent the unauthorized 
transfer of sensitive data. By setting up rules and criteria in a 
DLP solution, PharmaCorp can restrict the transfer of 
proprietary information while allowing other data to be 
transferred as needed. 
	
 
1440

Option A is incorrect. A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is 
used to protect web applications by filtering and monitoring 
HTTP traffic. It does not handle data transfers to external 
storage or cloud storage specifically. 
Option B is incorrect. A Data Encryption Tool encrypts data to 
protect it from unauthorized access. While it adds a layer of 
security, it doesn’t prevent the transfer of data to external 
devices or cloud storage. 
Option D is incorrect. A Virtual Private Network (VPN) 
provides a secure tunnel for data transmission between two 
endpoints. It does not prevent or monitor the type of data being 
transferred. 
Question 469. An online banking platform wants to improve its 
customer verification process when users open a new account. 
Which of the following identity proofing methods would be the 
MOST secure for this purpose? 
(A)       Asking users to select a security question and answer 
from a list 
(B)       Requiring users to upload a photo of a government-
issued ID and a selfie 
(C)       Sending a verification code to the user's email address 
(D)       Prompting users to provide their favorite color 
Explanation 469. Correct Answer: B. Requiring users to 
upload a photo of a government-issued ID and a selfie. This 
method provides a high level of assurance by comparing a 
user’s live image (selfie) with a government-issued ID. The 
combination ensures the person is who they claim to be. 
	
 
1441

Option A is incorrect. Security questions, especially from a 
pre-defined list, can be easily guessed or obtained by attackers. 
Option C is incorrect. Verification codes via email can 
enhance identity proofing but aren’t as robust as checking 
against a government ID and selfie. 
Option D is incorrect. Personal preferences, like favorite 
colors, are weak indicators of identity and can be easily 
guessed. 
Question 470. Sarah is working on a project where she needs to 
validate the integrity and authenticity of assets over time, 
without a centralized authority. Which technology would be 
most appropriate for this use case? 
(A)       Digital signature 
(B)       Key escrow 
(C)       Blockchain 
(D)       Key management system 
Explanation 470. Correct Answer: C. Blockchain. 
Blockchain technology allows for the validation of the integrity 
and authenticity of assets over time in a decentralized manner. 
Each transaction or asset is verified by the network’s 
participants and added to the chain, ensuring its authenticity and 
making it tamper-evident. 
Option A is incorrect. While digital signatures can validate the 
authenticity and integrity of a message or document, they do not 
provide a decentralized ledger of assets over time. 
	
 
1442

Option B is incorrect. Key escrow is a method where 
cryptographic keys are held in trust so that a third party can 
have access under certain conditions. It doesn’t help in 
validating the integrity and authenticity of assets over time 
without central authority. 
Option D is incorrect. A key management system manages the 
life cycle of cryptographic keys but does not inherently validate 
the integrity and authenticity of assets over time. 
Question 471. After a recent cyber attack on a corporation’s 
central database, the IT department has been tasked with 
enhancing the security of their network infrastructure. Which of 
the following would be the BEST technique to ensure that 
different departments, like HR and Finance, cannot access each 
other’s sensitive data? 
(A)       Implement network segmentation based on 
departments 
(B)       Upgrade the bandwidth of the entire network 
(C)       Use a single strong password for all departments 
(D)       Move all department data to the cloud 
Explanation 471. Correct Answer: A. Implement network 
segmentation based on departments. Network segmentation 
divides a network into multiple segments or subnets, each 
acting as its own small network. This limits access between 
segments and can protect sensitive data by ensuring that only 
those within a segment can access its resources. 
	
 
1443

Option B is incorrect. While upgrading the bandwidth may 
improve network speeds, it does not address the security 
concern of segregating departmental data. 
Option C is incorrect. Using a single strong password for all 
departments does not prevent one department from accessing 
another’s data. It also introduces a single point of failure. 
Option D is incorrect. Moving data to the cloud can offer some 
security benefits, but without proper access controls and 
segmentation, different departments could still access each 
other’s data. 
Question 472. A finance department employee, Maya, is 
transferred to the HR department. The IT department is 
considering her access requirements. Which of the following 
actions aligns best with the principle of least privilege? 
(A)       Retain Maya's access to the finance system and grant 
additional access to the HR system 
(B)       Remove all previous access rights and provide her 
access solely to the HR system 
(C)       Grant Maya administrative rights to ease her transition 
between departments 
(D)       Limit Maya's access to read-only for both finance and 
HR systems for a transitional period 
Explanation 472. Correct Answer: B. Remove all previous 
access rights and provide her access solely to the HR system. 
When an employee transitions from one department to another, 
their access requirements change. To uphold the principle of 
least privilege, it’s essential to re-evaluate and adjust access 
	
 
1444

rights. Maya no longer requires access to the finance system and 
should only have access to the resources necessary for her new 
role in HR. 
Option A is incorrect. Retaining access to the finance system 
when Maya no longer works in that department is unnecessary 
and could be a security risk. 
Option C is incorrect. Granting administrative rights is 
excessive and would provide Maya with more access than 
necessary for her new role. 
Option D is incorrect. While read-only access limits potential 
damage, providing access to both systems is unnecessary if 
Maya’s new role only requires access to the HR system. 
Question 473. A financial institution, BankCorp, has recently 
experienced a surge in phishing attacks targeting its employees. 
These attacks often involve URLs that look similar to legitimate 
ones but have slight variations. To reduce the risk of employees 
accidentally accessing these malicious sites, which measure 
should BankCorp implement? 
(A)       Implement a Domain Name System (DNS) firewall 
(B)       Employ URL scanning to identify and block 
malicious URLs 
(C)       Rely on manual reporting of suspicious URLs by 
employees 
(D)      Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to redirect all 
employee web traffic 
	
 
1445

Explanation 473. Correct Answer: B. Employ URL scanning 
to identify and block malicious URLs. URL scanning can 
identify potentially malicious sites by examining the complete 
URL and comparing it with known malicious URLs or patterns. 
This method can block access to URLs that are designed to look 
similar to legitimate ones. 
Option A is incorrect. While a DNS firewall can help block 
access to malicious domains, URL scanning provides more 
granular control by examining the full URL, not just the 
domain. 
Option C is incorrect. Relying solely on manual reporting by 
employees may not be as efficient or effective as an automated 
URL scanning solution. It would also place undue responsibility 
on employees to recognize and report every malicious URL. 
Option D is incorrect. Using a VPN simply changes the route 
of the traffic and provides encrypted communication. It does not 
inherently offer URL scanning or filtering capabilities. 
Question 474. The IT team at a manufacturing company is 
deploying an IoT-based monitoring system for their machinery. 
They want to ensure that these IoT devices, if compromised, 
cannot adversely affect their main corporate network. What 
should they implement to achieve this? 
(A)       Install antivirus software on all IoT devices 
(B)       Regularly patch and update the IoT device firmware 
(C)       Place the IoT devices on a dedicated VLAN 
(D)       Enable multi-factor authentication for IoT devices 
	
 
1446

Explanation 474. Correct Answer: C. Place the IoT devices 
on a dedicated VLAN. Placing the IoT devices on a dedicated 
VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) provides network 
isolation, ensuring that the devices are segregated from the main 
corporate network. This strategy ensures that if an IoT device is 
compromised, it doesn’t pose a direct threat to the core 
corporate network systems. 
Option A is incorrect. Many IoT devices may not support 
traditional antivirus software, and even if they do, this doesn’t 
achieve the network isolation desired. 
Option B is incorrect. While regularly patching and updating 
device firmware is crucial for security, it doesn’t provide 
network isolation from the main corporate network. 
Option D is incorrect. Enabling multi-factor authentication can 
enhance the security of devices but doesn’t provide the network 
isolation specified in the scenario. 
Question 475. The content filtering logs at a retail company 
display multiple instances of blocked access to a file download 
URL ending with “.exe”. The source IP address belongs to a 
point of sale (POS) terminal. What should be the primary 
concern for the security team? 
(A)       The POS terminal might have outdated software 
(B)       There's a possible misconfiguration in the content 
filtering rules 
(C)       The POS terminal might be compromised and trying 
to download malicious executables 
(D)       The company's internet speed is too slow 
	
 
1447

Explanation 475. Correct Answer: C. The POS terminal 
might be compromised and trying to download malicious 
executables. POS terminals shouldn’t be downloading 
executable files from the internet, especially without 
administrative oversight. Multiple attempts to download “.exe” 
files could indicate that the POS terminal is compromised and 
that malicious software is attempting to download further 
payloads. 
Option A is incorrect. While outdated software is a security 
concern, it wouldn’t manifest as multiple blocked attempts to 
download executables. 
Option B is incorrect. Misconfigurations in content filtering 
rules might block legitimate content, but the specific action of a 
POS terminal trying to download executable files is suspicious 
regardless of content filtering rules. 
Option D is incorrect. The company’s internet speed has no 
relevance to the specific content being blocked by the filtering 
system 
Question 476. A company wants to implement a solution that 
verifies the software integrity of remote servers before allowing 
them to connect to the primary network. Which of the following 
solutions BEST achieves this objective through attestation? 
(A)       Host-based firewall 
(B)       Whitelisting application 
(C)       Remote attestation 
(D)       VPN tunneling 
	
 
1448

Explanation 476. Correct Answer: C. Remote attestation. 
Remote attestation is a process where a device (like a server) 
proves to a remote entity (like a network controller) that it is 
running genuine, unmodified software. It allows for the 
verification of the software integrity of remote devices before 
they connect to a primary network. 
Option A is incorrect. A host-based firewall is used to control 
inbound and outbound network traffic to and from a device 
based on a set of configurable rules. It does not verify the 
software integrity of the device itself. 
Option B is incorrect. A whitelisting application only allows 
specified software to run on a system. While it can enhance 
security by ensuring only approved software runs, it does not 
attest to the state or integrity of the device or its software when 
connecting to another network. 
Option D is incorrect. VPN tunneling encrypts the connection 
between two points over the internet. While it ensures secure 
communication, it doesn’t verify the software integrity of 
devices. 
Question 477. ABC Tech has a mixed environment with both 
Linux and Windows servers. They want to ensure that processes 
running on their Linux servers only have access to specific 
resources and are restricted from performing certain actions. 
Which of the following tools would be most appropriate for this 
task? 
(A)       Use Group Policy on their Windows servers and apply it 
to Linux servers 
	
 
1449

(B)       Implement a strict user training regimen to inform users 
about security best practices 
(C)       Enable Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) in 
enforcing mode 
(D)       Limit user access to Linux servers 
Explanation 477. Correct Answer: C. Enable Security-
Enhanced Linux (SELinux) in enforcing mode. SELinux 
provides mandatory access controls by limiting the actions a 
process can perform to only those defined in its policy, ensuring 
it only has access to specific resources. By setting SELinux in 
enforcing mode, these policies are actively enforced. 
Option A is incorrect. Group Policy is specific to Windows and 
cannot be applied directly to Linux servers. 
Option B is incorrect. While user training is a good security 
practice, it does not provide the technical control required to 
restrict processes on Linux servers. 
Option D is incorrect. Limiting user access to Linux servers 
does not directly control the actions of processes running on 
those servers. 
Question 478. Liam, a security analyst, is investigating a 
potential breach. He discovers that a malicious actor sent 
requests to the server by altering HTTP headers to impersonate 
another user, thereby gaining unauthorized access. Which type 
of application attack is this? 
(A)       Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
(B)       Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
	
 
1450

(C)       HTTP Header Forgery 
(D)       Session Hijacking 
Explanation 478. Correct Answer: C. HTTP Header 
Forgery. HTTP Header Forgery involves manipulating HTTP 
headers in a request to impersonate, spoof, or deceive systems, 
often for bypassing security controls or impersonating other 
users. In the described scenario, the malicious actor altered 
HTTP headers to impersonate another user, indicating an HTTP 
Header Forgery attack. 
Option A is incorrect. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
involves tricking a user into executing actions on a web 
application where they’re authenticated, without their 
knowledge. While it involves forgery, it doesn’t involve directly 
manipulating HTTP headers as described. 
Option B is incorrect. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) involves 
injecting malicious scripts into web content viewed by other 
users. The scenario does not pertain to injecting scripts. 
Option D is incorrect. Session Hijacking involves taking over 
a user’s session to perform unauthorized actions. It doesn’t 
specifically involve the manipulation of HTTP headers. 
Question 479. ABC Corp has recently faced a security breach 
due to a contractor connecting an infected laptop to the 
corporate network. Management wants to implement a solution 
that would ensure that any device connecting to the corporate 
network meets the company’s security standards, including up-
to-date antivirus definitions. Which solution should ABC Corp 
	
 
1451

consider? 
(A)       Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
(B)       Virtual Private Network (VPN) 
(C)       Network Access Control (NAC) 
(D)       Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
Explanation 479. Correct Answer: C. Network Access 
Control (NAC). Network Access Control (NAC) allows 
organizations to set policies for device connectivity to corporate 
networks. NAC can assess the security posture of a device 
before it connects to ensure it meets predefined criteria, such as 
updated antivirus definitions, required patches, etc. 
Option A is incorrect. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
monitors network traffic for suspicious activities and issues 
alerts but does not evaluate device security postures before 
allowing network access. 
Option B is incorrect. A Virtual Private Network (VPN) allows 
secure remote access to a network but does not inherently 
evaluate the security posture of devices. 
Option D is incorrect. A Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
focuses on protecting web applications by monitoring and 
filtering HTTP traffic. It is not used for evaluating device 
security postures. 
Question 480. CyberFirm has been facing issues with phishing 
campaigns where attackers spoof their domain to send 
fraudulent emails. They already implemented DKIM to sign 
their emails but want an additional measure to specify which 
	
 
1452

mail servers are authorized to send emails on behalf of their 
domain. Which security measure should CyberFirm adopt? 
(A)       SPF 
(B)       PGP 
(C)       SSL certificate 
(D)       IMAP 
Explanation 480. Correct Answer: A. SPF. Sender Policy 
Framework (SPF) is designed to prevent email spoofing. It 
allows domain owners to specify which mail servers are 
authorized to send emails on behalf of their domain. Receiving 
servers can then verify the sending server against the SPF 
record in the domain’s DNS. 
Option B is incorrect. PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is used for 
encrypting and decrypting texts, emails, files, directories, and 
whole disk partitions, but it doesn’t define authorized mail 
servers for a domain. 
Option C is incorrect. An SSL certificate provides a secure 
connection between a user’s web browser and a website, 
ensuring data confidentiality. It’s not specifically designed to 
validate the sending mail servers of a domain. 
Option D is incorrect. IMAP (Internet Message Access 
Protocol) is a protocol used by email clients to retrieve 
messages from a mail server. It doesn’t help in specifying 
authorized mail servers for a domain. 
Question 481. A web application requires users to authenticate 
using a token sent to their email. Alex, a security analyst, 
	
 
1453

observes that once logged in, if he presents the same token 
again, he is granted access without any restrictions. What type 
of vulnerability does this situation depict? 
(A)       Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
(B)       Replay Attack 
(C)       Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack 
(D)       Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
Explanation 481. Correct Answer: B. Replay Attack. A 
replay attack, also known as playback attack, occurs when an 
attacker intercepts data and then retransmits it. In this scenario, 
Alex was able to reuse the authentication token to gain access, 
indicating that the system does not have mechanisms in place to 
prevent replayed tokens from being accepted multiple times. 
Option A is incorrect. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is 
an attack where an attacker tricks the victim into performing 
unwanted actions on a web application where they’re 
authenticated. It doesn’t involve reusing authentication tokens. 
Option C is incorrect. While a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) 
Attack can involve intercepting data between two parties, the 
described scenario doesn’t involve an attacker modifying or 
relaying the information in real-time. 
Option D is incorrect. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into 
web pages. The scenario doesn’t indicate any script injection  
Question 482. A large law firm has a centralized document 
repository where lawyers store client information, legal drafts, 
	
 
1454

and other sensitive data. A new paralegal, Jenna, joins the firm 
and needs to be able to view client documents but should not be 
able to modify or delete them. Which type of permission should 
be granted to Jenna? 
(A)       Read-Only 
(B)       Full Control 
(C)       Modify 
(D)       Execute 
Explanation 482. Correct Answer: A. Read-Only. The Read-
Only permission allows users to view and open files or 
resources but does not allow them to modify, delete, or execute 
them. In this scenario, granting Jenna Read-Only access ensures 
she can view client documents without making any alterations 
or deletions. 
Option B is incorrect. Full Control would give Jenna the 
ability to modify, delete, and even change the permissions of the 
documents, which exceeds the necessary permissions for her 
role. 
Option C is incorrect. The Modify permission allows a user to 
make changes to documents, which is not appropriate for Jenna 
based on the scenario’s requirements. 
Option D is incorrect. Execute permission is typically related 
to running programs or scripts and is not relevant to Jenna’s 
need to view documents. 
Question 483. The IT department of a software development 
company wants to ensure that only company-approved 
	
 
1455

development tools can be executed in their development 
environment, preventing any unauthorized or potentially 
harmful software from running. What should the IT department 
employ to achieve this? 
(A)       Implement network segmentation 
(B)       Conduct regular vulnerability assessments 
(C)       Install a stateful firewall 
(D)       Establish an application allow list 
Explanation 483. Correct Answer: D. Establish an 
application allow list. Establishing an application allow list 
would ensure that only specific, pre-approved applications can 
run in the development environment. This would prevent any 
unauthorized or potentially malicious software from being 
executed, aligning directly with the company’s goal. 
Option A is incorrect. While network segmentation can isolate 
different parts of the network and limit the spread of potential 
threats, it does not prevent unauthorized applications from 
running within a segment. 
Option B is incorrect. Regular vulnerability assessments 
identify weaknesses in systems, but they don’t proactively 
prevent specific applications from running. 
Option C is incorrect. A stateful firewall monitors the state of 
active connections and can block or allow traffic based on 
stateful parameters, but it doesn’t regulate which applications 
can be executed on a workstation. 
	
 
1456

Question 484. A company is implementing a system to ensure 
that code released to production is both unaltered and approved 
by a specific team member. Which of the following 
cryptographic techniques should they implement? 
(A)       Symmetric encryption of the code 
(B)       Hashing the code with SHA-256 
(C)       Encrypting the code with the team member's public key 
(D)       Digital signature by the team member 
Explanation 484. Correct Answer: D. Digital signature by 
the team member. Digital signatures provide both integrity and 
non-repudiation. By having the specific team member digitally 
sign the code, the company can ensure that the code has not 
been altered (integrity) and that it was approved by the 
designated individual (non-repudiation). 
Option A is incorrect. Symmetric encryption provides 
confidentiality, but it doesn’t provide the needed integrity and 
non-repudiation in this scenario. 
Option B is incorrect. Hashing the code provides a mechanism 
to check for alterations (integrity), but it does not provide non-
repudiation or evidence of the specific team member’s approval. 
Option C is incorrect. Encrypting with the team member’s 
public key doesn’t provide non-repudiation. Moreover, only the 
team member with the corresponding private key would be able 
to decrypt it, which might not be desirable for production 
releases. 
	
 
1457

Question 485. During an organization’s security review, the 
cybersecurity analyst noticed that there were multiple failed 
login attempts for different user accounts, each with a few 
commonly used passwords. What type of password attack does 
this scenario BEST describe? 
(A)       Brute Force Attack 
(B)       Dictionary Attack 
(C)       Credential Stuffing 
(D)       Password Spraying 
Explanation 485. Correct Answer: D. Password Spraying. 
Password Spraying is an attack method where the attacker tries 
a few commonly used passwords against multiple user accounts, 
rather than trying many passwords against a single account. The 
scenario described shows multiple user accounts with common 
passwords being targeted, aligning with this method. 
Option A is incorrect. A Brute Force Attack involves trying all 
possible password combinations for a particular account. The 
scenario describes trying common passwords on multiple 
accounts, not exhaustive combinations on one. 
Option B is incorrect. A Dictionary Attack involves trying a 
list of probable passwords, often extracted from dictionaries or 
common password lists, against a single account. The scenario 
emphasizes multiple accounts. 
Option C is incorrect. Credential Stuffing involves using 
previously leaked username and password pairs to gain 
unauthorized access. The emphasis is on using known 
credentials, not common passwords.

Question 486. A project manager is working on a new product 
launch and has documents with sensitive financial projections 
on her local computer. She occasionally shares these documents 
with select board members via email. While she wants to keep 
the financial documents secure, she doesn’t want to encrypt all 
the data on her computer. Which encryption approach should 
she utilize? 
(A)       Full-disk Encryption 
(B)       Transport-layer Encryption 
(C)       File-level Encryption 
(D)       Partition Encryption 
Explanation 486. Correct Answer: C. File-level Encryption. 
File-level Encryption allows individual files or folders to be 
encrypted. In this scenario, the project manager can encrypt 
only the sensitive financial documents, allowing her to securely 
share them while keeping the rest of her data unencrypted. 
Option A is incorrect. Full-disk Encryption would encrypt the 
entire drive, which is more than what’s required. 
Option B is incorrect. Transport-layer Encryption protects data 
in transit, but does not specifically address encrypting 
individual files for storage and sharing. 
Option D is incorrect. Partition Encryption encrypts entire 
partitions or volumes, which isn’t necessary in this scenario. 
Question 487. A financial institution is looking to adopt an 
encryption algorithm for its transactions that is considered to be 
very secure due to its longer key length, compared to older 
	
 
1459

standards. Which encryption algorithm best fits this description? 
(A)       DES 
(B)       Blowfish 
(C)       RSA 
(D)       AES-256 
Explanation 487. Correct Answer: D. AES-256. AES-256, 
part of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) family, 
utilizes a 256-bit key length. This extended key length provides 
a higher degree of security and is considered resistant to all 
known practical attacks when used properly. 
Option A is incorrect. DES (Data Encryption Standard) has a 
key length of only 56 bits and is considered to be insecure 
against sufficiently equipped attackers due to its shorter key 
length. 
Option B is incorrect. While Blowfish is a symmetric 
encryption algorithm, it’s older and not as universally 
recommended for secure transactions as AES. 
Option C is incorrect. RSA is an asymmetric encryption 
algorithm, not typically used directly for encrypting bulk 
transaction data. 
Question 488. The IT team of XYZ Corp received an alert that 
an employee’s account was used to access the company’s portal 
from Paris at 2:00 PM and then from Tokyo at 2:30 PM. The 
employee is currently on a business trip to Paris. What could 
this alert be indicating? 
(A)      The employee quickly traveled from Paris to Tokyo 
	
 
1460

(B)       The company's time zone settings are misconfigured 
(C)       There's a possible VPN misconfiguration on the 
employee's computer 
(D)       The employee's account might have been 
compromised 
Explanation 488. Correct Answer: D. The employee’s 
account might have been compromised. Impossible travel, in 
this context, refers to the improbable nature of someone being 
in two distant geographical locations within a short time frame. 
Given the close time proximity of both access attempts, it’s 
highly improbable that the employee traveled from Paris to 
Tokyo in half an hour. This is a common indicator of account 
compromise. 
Option A is incorrect. It’s virtually impossible for someone to 
travel from Paris to Tokyo in just 30 minutes. 
Option B is incorrect. Time zone misconfigurations might 
cause timestamp discrepancies, but they wouldn’t cause the 
appearance of logins from two distant cities within such a short 
time frame. 
Option C is incorrect. Even if there’s a VPN misconfiguration, 
it would not explain the access from two very different 
geographical locations in such a short span of time. 
Question 489. Global Corp received a report that some of its 
customers received phishing emails that seemed to originate 
from the company’s domain. The IT team checked and 
confirmed that SPF and DKIM configurations were correctly 
	
 
1461

set. What additional email security measure can Global Corp 
implement to provide clear policies on how the emails should 
be treated if they don’t align with SPF and DKIM? 
(A)       Enabling TLS encryption 
(B)       Implementing DMARC policies 
(C)       Setting up a new SMTP server 
(D)       Increasing email retention period 
Explanation 489. Correct Answer: B. Implementing 
DMARC policies. By implementing DMARC policies, Global 
Corp can define how email receivers should handle emails from 
its domain that don’t align with the specified SPF and DKIM 
records. DMARC can be set to monitor, quarantine, or reject 
emails that fail these checks, providing more robust protection 
against email spoofing and phishing. 
Option A is incorrect. While TLS encryption is essential for 
protecting the content of email in transit, it doesn’t address the 
issue of spoofing or provide guidelines on how to handle emails 
that don’t match SPF and DKIM. 
Option C is incorrect. Setting up a new SMTP server can help 
with sending emails, but it doesn’t inherently protect against 
email spoofing or provide guidance for emails that don’t align 
with SPF and DKIM. 
Option D is incorrect. Increasing the email retention period 
affects how long emails are stored but doesn’t offer protection 
against spoofing or guidance for handling misaligned emails. 
	
 
1462

Question 490. A financial institution plans to provide access to 
its database for third-party developers to create new 
applications. However, they want to ensure that the developers 
do not see the actual data but instead work with a disguised 
version that retains the data’s original structure. What technique 
is the financial institution considering? 
(A)       Tokenization 
(B)       Data masking 
(C)       Encryption 
(D)       Digital watermarking 
Explanation 490. Correct Answer: B. Data masking. Data 
masking is a technique that obscures specific data within a 
database, making the data unreadable and unusable. The method 
is often employed in non-production environments to protect 
the data subject’s data privacy and data security. 
Option A is incorrect. Tokenization replaces sensitive data with 
random tokens, which act as references to the original data. 
Option C is incorrect. Encryption converts readable data into 
an unreadable format to protect its confidentiality. It requires a 
key to return the data to its original form. 
Option D is incorrect. Digital watermarking embeds data into a 
digital signal, primarily for asserting rights or ownership. 
Question 491. While reviewing web server logs, Sarah, a 
security analyst, notices a pattern of requests containing “..
%2F..” in the URLs. She suspects this might be an attempt to 
exploit a vulnerability. Which type of application attack is likely 
	
 
1463

being attempted? 
(A)       Command Injection 
(B)       Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
(C)       Directory Traversal 
(D)       Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
Explanation 491. Correct Answer: C. Directory Traversal. 
Directory traversal (also known as path traversal) involves 
manipulating variables referencing files with “..” sequences and 
its variations (like “..%2F..”, which URL-decodes to “../..”) to 
navigate outside of the intended directory. This can allow an 
attacker to access restricted files on the web server. The pattern 
Sarah observed in the logs indicates a directory traversal attack 
attempt. 
Option A is incorrect. Command injection attacks involve 
executing arbitrary commands on the server via application 
vulnerabilities. The specific pattern observed in the logs does 
not suggest command execution. 
Option B is incorrect. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks 
involve injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by 
other users. The pattern observed doesn’t pertain to script 
injection. 
Option D is incorrect. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
tricks victims into submitting a malicious request. It does not 
involve directory or path manipulation as described in the 
scenario. 
	
 
1464

Question 492. A financial firm outsources its payment 
processing to a third-party service provider. After a series of 
fraudulent transactions, it was discovered that the service 
provider was not employing the latest encryption standards 
when transmitting data. Which vulnerability related to supply 
chain does this scenario highlight? 
(A)       Inadequate vendor background checks 
(B)       Service provider's outdated security practices 
(C)       Deficient hardware components from a supplier 
(D)       Software with embedded backdoors 
Explanation 492. Correct Answer: B. Service provider’s 
outdated security practices. Supply chain vulnerabilities 
encompass risks originating from third-party vendors and 
service providers. In this scenario, the third-party service 
provider’s failure to use current encryption standards for 
transmitting data exemplifies a vulnerability that arises due to 
outdated security practices by the service provider. 
Option A is incorrect. While vendor background checks are 
essential, the scenario does not specifically point towards a 
problem with the vendor’s background. It focuses on their 
encryption practices. 
Option C is incorrect. The scenario doesn’t mention hardware 
components or any issues related to them. 
Option D is incorrect. The issue here pertains to encryption 
standards, not to software with embedded backdoors. 
	
 
1465

Question 493. A security analyst is evaluating security 
enhancements for a series of laptops that will store highly 
confidential data. The analyst wants to ensure that stored data 
remains encrypted and the integrity of the boot process is 
maintained. Which of the following would BEST meet this 
requirement? 
(A)       Installing antivirus software on each laptop 
(B)       Enabling a software-based full-disk encryption 
(C)       Implementing a BIOS password 
(D)       Utilizing a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 
Explanation 493. Correct Answer: D. Utilizing a Trusted 
Platform Module (TPM). A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 
is a specialized chip on an endpoint device that stores RSA 
encryption keys specific to the host system. It provides 
hardware-based security to enhance the security of the device 
by enabling features like hardware-based encryption and 
ensuring the integrity of the boot process, among other things. 
Option A is incorrect. While antivirus software is vital for 
protecting against malware, it does not directly address 
hardware-based encryption or boot process integrity. 
Option B is incorrect. Software-based full-disk encryption can 
ensure the confidentiality of data, but it does not offer 
hardware-level protection or boot process integrity like a TPM. 
Option C is incorrect. A BIOS password provides a layer of 
security, but it does not offer encryption for stored data or 
ensure boot process integrity. 
	
 
1466

Question 494. An organization is choosing a hash function for 
digital signatures. They want to ensure that it is resistant to 
scenarios where an attacker might produce two different 
messages having the same hash. Which type of attack are they 
trying to defend against? 
(A)       Side-channel Attack 
(B)       Replay Attack 
(C)       Birthday Attack 
(D)       Ciphertext-only Attack 
Explanation 494. Correct Answer: C. Birthday Attack. In a 
Birthday Attack, attackers exploit the mathematics behind the 
birthday problem in probability theory, aiming to find two 
different inputs that produce the same output, or hash. When 
selecting a hash function for digital signatures, it’s crucial to 
pick one that is resistant to Birthday Attacks to maintain the 
integrity of the signatures. 
Option A is incorrect. A Side-channel Attack involves 
obtaining information from the physical implementation of a 
cryptographic system rather than exploiting a theoretical 
weakness in algorithms or protocols. It’s unrelated to producing 
two messages with the same hash. 
Option B is incorrect. A Replay Attack involves intercepting 
data (like a login session) and then resending or replaying it to 
gain unauthorized access. It does not focus on matching hash 
values. 
Option D is incorrect. In a Ciphertext-only Attack, the attacker 
has the ciphertext and tries to derive the plaintext without 
	
 
1467

knowing the key. The scenario does not describe this type of 
attack. 
Question 495. At ExamsDigest, employees can access the 
company’s cloud-based storage system. However, access to 
certain files within the storage is determined by the employee’s 
department, job title, and years of service. For instance, senior 
managers in the finance department with more than five years 
of service can view the company’s financial forecasts. Which 
access control model is ExamsDigest using? 
(A)       Rule-Based Access Control (RAC) 
(B)       Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 
(C)       Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) 
(D)       Discretionary Access Control (DAC) 
Explanation 495. Correct Answer: C. Attribute-Based 
Access Control (ABAC). Attribute-Based Access Control 
(ABAC) determines access based on attributes of the user, 
resource, and environment. In the scenario, the employee’s 
department, job title, and years of service are the attributes that 
determine their access to specific files. 
Option A is incorrect. RAC works based on predefined rules, 
typically without involving multiple user attributes like 
department or job title. 
Option B is incorrect. While RBAC is close in functionality, it 
assigns permissions based on roles (like “manager” or “clerk”), 
not on a combination of attributes. 
	
 
1468

Option D is incorrect. DAC allows resource owners to specify 
who can access their resources based on their discretion. It 
doesn’t involve a combination of attributes to determine access. 
Question 496. After a recent system upgrade, CloudTech Corp. 
decided to validate the efficiency and reliability of its new data 
processing system. To do this, they run the new system 
alongside the old one and compare the outcomes. This way, they 
aim to ensure that the new system is both robust and capable of 
handling the current workload. What kind of testing is 
CloudTech Corp. utilizing? 
(A)       Load Testing 
(B)       Failover Testing 
(C)       Parallel Processing Testing 
(D)       Simulation Testing 
Explanation 496. Correct Answer: C. Parallel Processing 
Testing. Parallel Processing Testing involves running two 
systems simultaneously (typically the new one and the old one) 
to compare the outcomes. This kind of testing ensures that a 
new system is as effective and reliable as the previous one. 
Option A is incorrect. Load Testing checks the system’s ability 
to handle the expected volume of transactions and to see if it 
can maintain acceptable response times. 
Option B is incorrect. Failover Testing is done to ensure that a 
system can switch to a backup or secondary system in the case 
of a failure, rather than comparing two systems for consistency. 
	
 
1469

Option D is incorrect. Simulation Testing involves creating a 
model of the system under test and stimulating it with virtual 
users or devices to understand its behavior under various 
conditions. 
Question 497. SecureNet Inc. recently upgraded their security 
infrastructure. To validate how the new system would respond 
in real-world scenarios without exposing it to actual risks, they 
decide to imitate certain cyber threats in a controlled 
environment. Which type of test is SecureNet Inc. planning to 
conduct? 
(A)       Penetration Testing 
(B)       Simulation Testing 
(C)       Vulnerability Assessment 
(D)       Failover Testing. 
Explanation 497. Correct Answer: B. Simulation Testing. 
Simulation testing involves creating a model of the system 
under test and then stimulating it with virtual users or devices to 
understand its behavior under various conditions. In the context 
of cybersecurity, this means imitating cyber threats in a 
controlled environment to assess how security infrastructure 
responds. 
Option A is incorrect. Penetration Testing involves ethical 
hackers attempting to breach an organization’s defenses, which 
involves actual risks, rather than just a simulation. 
Option C is incorrect. A Vulnerability Assessment identifies, 
quantifies, and prioritizes vulnerabilities in a system but doesn’t 
necessarily imitate threats in a controlled environment. 
	
 
1470

Option D is incorrect. Failover Testing ensures that a system 
can switch to a backup or secondary system in case of a failure, 
and does not focus on simulating threats. 
Question 498. A marketing team is collaborating on a new 
campaign and requires access to a shared folder. However, they 
shouldn’t be able to modify files created by others. How should 
permissions be set on this shared folder? 
(A)       Assign the marketing team full control 
(B)       Allow the marketing team read-only access 
(C)       Assign the marketing team write-only access 
(D)       Assign the marketing team modify permission but 
deny the delete permission 
Explanation 498. Correct Answer: D. Assign the marketing 
team modify permission but deny the delete permission. By 
providing modify permissions but denying delete permissions, 
team members can create and edit their own files, but they 
won’t be able to delete or modify files created by others. 
Option A is incorrect. Full control would allow team members 
to modify or delete any file, which is not desired. 
Option B is incorrect. Read-only access would prevent team 
members from creating or editing any files. 
Option C is incorrect. Write-only access would prevent team 
members from viewing existing files in the folder. 
Question 499. An organization’s e-commerce platform 
experienced a data breach where attackers exploited a known 
	
 
1471

vulnerability. Post-incident analysis revealed that a patch was 
available for this vulnerability two months before the breach but 
was not applied. Which of the following would have been the 
MOST effective measure to prevent this breach? 
(A)       Implementing stronger user authentication methods 
(B)       Increasing network monitoring for signs of malicious 
activity 
(C)       Applying the available patch in a timely manner 
(D)       Migrating to a different e-commerce platform 
Explanation 499. Correct Answer: C. Applying the available 
patch in a timely manner. Patches are developed by software 
vendors to address known vulnerabilities in their software. 
Timely application of these patches is crucial to ensuring that 
systems are protected against known threats. In this scenario, 
applying the available patch would have directly addressed the 
vulnerability that was exploited. 
Option A is incorrect. While implementing stronger user 
authentication methods can enhance security, it wouldn’t 
directly mitigate a vulnerability in the software that could be 
exploited without authentication. 
Option B is incorrect. Increasing network monitoring can help 
detect malicious activity, but it doesn’t prevent the exploitation 
of a known software vulnerability. 
Option D is incorrect. Migrating to a different platform is a 
drastic measure that might introduce new vulnerabilities and 
would not ensure security unless accompanied by good patch 
management practices.

Question 500. A security analyst is reviewing network logs and 
notices that an attacker positioned in between the user and the 
target website is intercepting and potentially modifying the 
user’s communications before passing them on to the intended 
destination. This malicious activity occurs transparently, with 
neither the user nor the target website being aware. What type 
of network attack is being described? 
(A)       Replay Attack 
(B)       Smurf Attack 
(C)       On-path Attack 
(D)       Spoofing Attack 
Explanation 500. Correct Answer: C. On-path Attack. An 
On-path Attack, also known as a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) 
attack, involves an attacker intercepting communications 
between two parties, potentially modifying the communication, 
and then relaying it to the intended recipient. Both the source 
and the destination are unaware of the attacker’s presence. 
Option A is incorrect. A Replay Attack involves capturing 
legitimate data packets and retransmitting them at a later time to 
create an unauthorized effect. It doesn’t involve active 
interception and modification in real-time. 
Option B is incorrect. A Smurf Attack is a type of denial-of-
service attack that uses ICMP Echo (ping) traffic to flood a 
target system. It has no relation to intercepting and modifying 
user communications. 
Option D is incorrect. Spoofing Attack involves pretending to 
be something or someone else. While on-path attacks might 
	
 
1473

involve some elements of spoofing, the specific action 
described in the scenario is more aligned with an on-path attack. 
EXAM SIMULATOR #6

Answers 501-600 
Question 501. A company’s website was temporarily defaced 
with a humorous meme, but no sensitive data was stolen or any 
significant damage done. The attacker left a message bragging 
about their first successful hack. Which type of threat actor is 
MOST likely responsible for this attack? 
(A)       Insider threat 
(B)       Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) 
(C)       Unskilled attacker 
(D)       Nation-state 
Explanation 501. Correct Answer: C. Unskilled attacker. 
Unskilled attackers, often referred to as “script kiddies”, 
typically utilize pre-made tools or scripts to carry out basic 
attacks. Their motivations are often more about bragging rights 
or minor mischief, such as defacing a website for fun or to 
prove they can, rather than executing a sophisticated or 
damaging attack. 
Option A is incorrect. Insider threats are individuals within an 
organization that may have specific motives related to personal 
grievances or financial gain. Their attacks would typically be 
more targeted and potentially more harmful than just defacing a 
website. 
Option B is incorrect. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are 
highly skilled and typically represent organized groups with 
specific, long-term objectives. Their attacks are sophisticated 
	
 
1513

and stealthy, aiming for data theft or system compromise over 
an extended period. 
Option D is incorrect. Nation-states are motivated by political, 
military, or espionage objectives. A simple website defacement, 
especially one with a humorous meme, does not align with their 
typical motivations or methods.

their network 
(D)       Restricting transaction capabilities to only a few trusted 
IP addresses. 
Explanation 502. Correct Answer: C. Installing an Intrusion 
Detection System (IDS) on their network. An Intrusion 
Detection System (IDS) serves as a detective control by 
monitoring network traffic for suspicious activities and potential 
threats. In this context, it can be configured to detect patterns 
related to unauthorized transactions, thereby allowing timely 
intervention. 
	
 
1514

Option A is incorrect. Implementing a multi-factor 
authentication system is a preventive control that provides an 
additional layer of security by requiring two or more 
verification methods. While it reduces the risk of unauthorized 
access, it does not detect suspicious transactions. 
Option B is incorrect. Establishing a Security Operations 
Center (SOC) is a broad approach to handle security events, and 
while it can include detective controls, merely setting up a SOC 
does not provide specific real-time detection of unauthorized 
transactions. 
Option D is incorrect. Restricting transaction capabilities to 
only a few trusted IP addresses is a preventive control that 
limits the sources of potential transactions. While it can reduce 
the number of unauthorized transactions, it does not detect 
them. 
Question 503. GammaTech has a new remote access policy for 
its employees. Whenever an employee attempts to access the 
corporate network from an unfamiliar location, the system 
requests additional verification before granting access. Which 
factor of authentication is being emphasized in this policy? 
(A)       Knowledge-based questions the employee answers 
(B)       A fingerprint scan from the employee 
(C)       The physical coordinates of the employee's access 
point 
(D)       An SMS code sent to the employee's phone 
Explanation 503. Correct Answer: C. The physical 
coordinates of the employee’s access point. By verifying the 
	
 
1515

location or coordinates of an access point, GammaTech is 
utilizing the “somewhere you are” factor in multifactor 
authentication. This emphasizes the geographic location of the 
user. 
Option A is incorrect. Knowledge-based questions fall under 
the “something you know” factor since users answer based on 
information they recall. 
Option B is incorrect. A fingerprint scan pertains to the 
“something you are” factor as it’s a biometric, a unique physical 
characteristic of the individual. 
Option D is incorrect. An SMS code sent to a phone belongs to 
the “something you have” factor, as it’s sent to a device in the 
user’s possession. 
Question 504. The cybersecurity team of XYZ Corp. plans to 
assess their organization’s preparedness for a potential data 
breach. They aim to evaluate the effectiveness of their response 
strategy without performing any real actions. Which of the 
following methods would BEST help them achieve this goal? 
(A)       Live fire exercise 
(B)       System hardening test 
(C)       Red team/blue team exercise 
(D)       Tabletop exercise 
Explanation 504. Correct Answer: D. Tabletop exercise. A 
tabletop exercise is a discussion-based session where team 
members meet in an informal, classroom setting to discuss their 
roles during an emergency and their responses to a particular 
	
 
1516

emergency situation. It allows for an assessment of an incident 
response strategy without performing any actual tasks. 
Option A is incorrect. A live fire exercise is a real-world test, 
often unannounced, and could impact actual operations. 
Option B is incorrect. System hardening test focuses on 
making a system more secure against attacks and does not 
evaluate incident response. 
Option C is incorrect. Red team/blue team exercises involve 
simulating real-world cyber attacks to test an organization’s 
defense and response capabilities, which is more hands-on than 
what is described. 
Question 505. A company is attempting to verify the legitimacy 
of an email sent from a senior executive to a number of 
employees. The email requests the recipients to click on a link 
and enter their credentials for a “system upgrade.” The security 
team wants to ascertain if the email genuinely came from the 
executive. Which of the following metadata from the email 
would be MOST beneficial in this investigation? 
(A)       The email's subject line 
(B)       The email's send time and date 
(C)       The originating IP address in the email headers 
(D)       The size of the email in bytes 
Explanation 505. Correct Answer: C. The originating IP 
address in the email headers. Email headers often contain 
metadata about the originating IP address of the email. This can 
help investigators determine if the email was sent from an 
	
 
1517

expected location or if it originated from an unfamiliar or 
suspicious IP, indicating a possible phishing attempt. 
Option A is incorrect. The subject line of an email is not 
typically indicative of its authenticity. 
Option B is incorrect. While knowing the send time and date 
may provide some context, it won’t necessarily verify the 
legitimacy of the email sender. 
Option D is incorrect. The size of the email in bytes doesn’t 
offer significant value in determining the authenticity of the 
email’s origin. 
Question 506. An online banking website employs a system 
that automatically logs out users after 10 minutes of inactivity 
to ensure that if a user forgets to log out, no one else can alter 
the user’s banking details. Which principle of the CIA triad is 
the banking website MOST directly addressing? 
(A)       Confidentiality 
(B)       Availability 
(C)       Authentication 
(D)       Integrity 
Explanation 506. Correct Answer: D. Integrity.  The integrity 
pillar of the CIA triad ensures the accuracy and reliability of 
data. By logging out users after a period of inactivity, the 
banking website aims to prevent unauthorized modifications 
(potentially by someone else who might gain access to the 
unattended session) to the user’s banking details, thereby 
maintaining the integrity of the data. 
	
 
1518

Option A is incorrect. While logging out users does have a 
confidentiality aspect, the primary aim in this scenario is to 
prevent unauthorized changes rather than unauthorized viewing. 
Option B is incorrect. Availability ensures that data and 
systems are accessible to authorized users when they need it. 
This scenario doesn’t discuss providing or restricting access 
based on system uptime or accessibility. 
Option C is incorrect. Authentication ensures that users are 
who they claim to be. While the scenario does touch on security 
measures, the primary concern here is preventing unauthorized 
changes to data, which aligns with integrity, not authentication  
Question 507. An IT department in a large corporation spends 
several hours each day manually deploying patches and updates 
to thousands of workstations. Which of the following solutions 
would BEST enhance the efficiency of this process and save 
time for the IT team? 
(A)       Disable automatic updates and conduct monthly 
patching sessions 
(B)       Implement an automated patch management system 
(C)       Designate a dedicated team for patching that operates in 
shifts 
(D)       Educate users to install updates on their own 
Explanation 507. Correct Answer: B. Implement an 
automated patch management system. By implementing an 
automated patch management system, the IT department can 
streamline the deployment of patches and updates across all 
	
 
1519

workstations, ensuring consistency, reducing manual efforts, 
and saving valuable time. 
Option A is incorrect. Disabling automatic updates and 
conducting monthly patching sessions does not address the 
inefficiency of manual patching and might expose the systems 
to vulnerabilities for a longer time. 
Option C is incorrect. While designating a dedicated team 
might distribute the workload, it doesn’t eliminate the 
inefficiencies associated with manual patching. 
Option D is incorrect. Relying on users to install updates 
introduces inconsistency, potential delays, and additional risks, 
as not all users might have the technical knowledge or 
remember to update regularly. 
Question 508. Epsilon Inc. recently hired Jenny as a junior 
network administrator. To ensure security, they give Jenny only 
the access permissions necessary to complete her specific tasks, 
such as monitoring network traffic, but not modifying firewall 
rules. This approach of granting Jenny’s permissions aligns with 
which security principle? 
(A)       Mandatory Access Control (MAC) 
(B)       Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 
(C)       Time-of-Day Restrictions 
(D)       Least Privilege 
Explanation 508. Correct Answer: D. Least Privilege. The 
principle of Least Privilege dictates that users should be granted 
the minimum levels of access – or the least amount of privileges 
	
 
1520

– necessary to complete their job functions. In Jenny’s case, 
she’s only granted the permissions necessary for her role, which 
aligns with this principle. 
Option A is incorrect. MAC involves classifying information 
and matching user clearance levels to these classifications. 
Jenny’s access isn’t based on classifications. 
Option B is incorrect. RBAC assigns permissions based on 
roles within an organization. While Jenny’s permissions may be 
aligned with her role, the scenario specifically emphasizes 
granting the minimal necessary access, which is a characteristic 
of Least Privilege. 
Option C is incorrect. Time-of-Day Restrictions determine 
access based on the current time and have no direct relation to 
the principle of Least Privilege. 
Question 509. As part of a cloud infrastructure project, 
AlphaTech plans to deploy multiple virtualized resources for its 
new application. The deployment includes databases, web 
servers, and load balancers. What is the PRIMARY benefit of 
using automation scripts in the resource provisioning process 
for this project? 
(A)       It enables AlphaTech to use a single operating system 
for all resources 
(B)       It guarantees 100% uptime for all virtualized resources 
(C)       It ensures standardized, repeatable, and rapid 
deployments across the infrastructure 
(D)       It prevents unauthorized users from accessing the cloud 
infrastructure 
	
 
1521

Explanation 509. Correct Answer: C. It ensures 
standardized, repeatable, and rapid deployments across the 
infrastructure. Automation in resource provisioning provides 
consistency in deployments, allowing for standardized 
configurations, rapid scaling, and the ability to repeat 
deployments without human error. 
Option A is incorrect. While automation can deploy similar or 
consistent environments, it does not inherently enforce a single 
operating system. 
Option B is incorrect. Automation can increase efficiency and 
reduce human errors, but it cannot guarantee 100% uptime, as 
there are other factors involved, like hardware failures or 
network issues. 
Option D is incorrect. While automation can implement 
security configurations, it does not, by itself, prevent 
unauthorized access. Security measures need to be designed and 
implemented separately. 
Question 510. CyberSec Corp’s CISO wants to determine if 
there have been any anomalies in user behavior over the past 
month. Specifically, they’re concerned about unauthorized data 
transfers outside of regular business hours. Which of the 
following automated reports would be MOST useful in this 
investigation? 
(A)       After-hours network activity reports 
(B)       User password change frequency reports 
(C)       Hardware inventory audit reports 
(D)       Software licensing compliance reports 
	
 
1522

Explanation 510. Correct Answer: A. After-hours network 
activity reports. For the specific concern of unauthorized data 
transfers outside of regular business hours, the after-hours 
network activity reports would be most useful. These reports 
would provide details on network activities, including data 
transfers, that took place outside typical working hours. 
Option B is incorrect. While user password change frequency 
reports might indicate if users are frequently changing 
passwords, which could be a sign of suspicious activity, it 
wouldn’t directly address the concern of data transfers outside 
of regular hours. 
Option C is incorrect. Hardware inventory audit reports would 
provide information about the hardware assets of the company 
but wouldn’t give insights into data transfer activities. 
Option D is incorrect. Software licensing compliance reports 
would detail the compliance status of software licenses, which 
isn’t relevant to the concern about unauthorized data transfers 
after hours. 
Question 511. During a review of IDS logs, a security specialist 
notices a series of alerts indicating that a single external IP has 
been sending payloads that exploit a known vulnerability. 
However, the internal system to which these payloads are sent is 
patched and is not vulnerable to the exploit. Which of the 
following describes this type of IDS alert? 
(A)       False positive 
(B)       False negative 
	
 
1523

(C)       True positive 
(D)       True negative 
Explanation 511. Correct Answer: C. True positive. A true 
positive means the IDS correctly identified malicious or 
anomalous traffic. In this case, even though the internal system 
isn’t vulnerable, the IDS correctly flagged the traffic because 
it’s genuinely malicious. 
Option A is incorrect. A false positive would mean the IDS 
incorrectly flagged benign traffic as malicious, which is not the 
case here. 
Option B is incorrect. A false negative means the IDS failed to 
identify malicious or anomalous traffic, but in this scenario, the 
IDS did correctly identify the malicious traffic. 
Option D is incorrect. A true negative means the IDS correctly 
identified benign traffic as benign. The traffic in this scenario 
was malicious, so this doesn’t apply. 
Question 512. An organization recently experienced a malware 
infection on one of its workstations. A security analyst has been 
tasked with reviewing the endpoint logs of the infected system 
to gather more information about the incident. Which of the 
following entries in the endpoint logs would be MOST 
indicative of the initial malware infection point? 
(A)       Logs indicating successful user login and logout events 
(B)       Entries showing periodic system health-check status as 
"OK" 
(C)       Logs documenting a recently installed and executed 
	
 
1524

unknown .exe file from a temporary directory 
(D)       Entries detailing network connectivity checks to the 
domain controller 
Explanation 512. Correct Answer: C. Logs documenting a 
recently installed and executed unknown .exe file from a 
temporary directory. Endpoint logs that document the 
installation and execution of an unknown .exe file, especially 
from a temporary directory, are strong indicators of potentially 
malicious activity. Such logs can pinpoint the initial infection 
point of malware on a system. 
Option A is incorrect. User login and logout events are routine 
logs and do not provide specific information about malware 
infections unless associated with other suspicious activities. 
Option B is incorrect. System health-check status entries are 
meant to provide general information about the system’s health 
and do not specify actions or changes made on the system 
related to malware. 
Option D is incorrect. Network connectivity checks to domain 
controllers are routine in many network environments and don’t 
directly indicate malware activity. 
Question 513. A security analyst is reviewing the IPS logs and 
discovers multiple alerts originating from a single IP address 
attempting to access various company servers. The analyst is 
trying to determine the type of attack. Which of the following 
log entries BEST indicates a port scanning activity? 
(A)       Multiple consecutive connection attempts to different 
	
 
1525

ports on a single server in a short time frame 
(B)       Repeated connection attempts to port 80 of a web server 
every 3 seconds 
(C)       Numerous failed login attempts to an FTP server from 
the same IP address 
(D)       Consistent pings to the network gateway every 5 
seconds 
Explanation 513. Correct Answer: A. Multiple consecutive 
connection attempts to different ports on a single server in a 
short time frame. Port scanning is an activity where an attacker 
probes a server or host to determine what services are running. 
Rapid connection attempts to various ports indicate that the 
attacker is trying to discover open ports and the services 
running on them. 
Option B is incorrect. While repeated connection attempts to a 
single port could be suspicious, it doesn’t indicate port 
scanning. This could be indicative of a DoS attack. 
Option C is incorrect. Multiple failed login attempts indicate a 
possible brute force attack on the FTP server, not port scanning. 
Option D is incorrect. Regular pings to the network gateway 
might be indicative of network mapping or checking 
connectivity but doesn’t suggest port scanning activity. 
Question 514. A global financial company experiences sporadic 
cyber attacks on its infrastructure. The company notices that 
attacks that occur during non-business hours often result in 
more significant damage due to delayed responses. Which of the 
	
 
1526

following measures would BEST decrease the reaction time to 
these off-hour attacks? 
(A)       Multiple consecutive connection attempts to different 
ports on a single server in a short time frame 
(B)       Repeated connection attempts to port 80 of a web server 
every 3 seconds 
(C)       Numerous failed login attempts to an FTP server from 
the same IP address 
(D)       Consistent pings to the network gateway every 5 
seconds 
Explanation 514. Correct Answer: A. Multiple consecutive 
connection attempts to different ports on a single server in a 
short time frame. Port scanning is an activity where an attacker 
probes a server or host to determine what services are running. 
Rapid connection attempts to various ports indicate that the 
attacker is trying to discover open ports and the services 
running on them. 
Option B is incorrect. While repeated connection attempts to a 
single port could be suspicious, it doesn’t indicate port 
scanning. This could be indicative of a DoS attack. 
Option C is incorrect. Multiple failed login attempts indicate a 
possible brute force attack on the FTP server, not port scanning. 
Option D is incorrect. Regular pings to the network gateway 
might be indicative of network mapping or checking 
connectivity but doesn’t suggest port scanning activity.

Question 515. GreenTech, a data center company, is planning to 
expand its operations in a region known for frequent power 
outages. To maintain security posture and ensure continuity of 
operations, which of the following should be their PRIMARY 
consideration regarding power? 
(A)       Using power-efficient servers to reduce electricity costs 
(B)       Setting up solar panels to promote green energy 
(C)       Investing in redundant power supplies and 
uninterruptible power systems (UPS) 
(D)       Running operations only during peak daylight hours to 
ensure natural lighting 
Explanation 515. Correct Answer: C. Investing in 
redundant power supplies and uninterruptible power 
systems (UPS). Given the frequent power outages in the region, 
having redundant power supplies and UPS ensures that 
operations continue smoothly without abrupt interruptions, 
which can lead to system crashes, data corruption, or security 
breaches. 
Option A is incorrect. While power-efficient servers can 
reduce costs, they do not address the primary concern of power 
outages and maintaining operations. 
Option B is incorrect. Solar panels promote green energy but 
might not provide consistent and immediate power backup 
during outages, especially during nighttime or cloudy days. 
Option D is incorrect. Limiting operations to daylight hours is 
not a practical solution for a data center, as it restricts 
	
 
1528

operational capacity and doesn’t directly address the issue of 
power outages. 
Question 516. A medium-sized enterprise is concerned about 
the security of its office workstations after a series of malware 
infections. As a security analyst, which of the following 
recommendations would BEST improve the security baseline of 
the workstations? 
(A)       Install multiple antivirus solutions to ensure maximum 
detection 
(B)       Set up screensavers with cyber hygiene tips to educate 
users 
(C)       Disable unnecessary services and ports on the 
workstations 
(D)       Frequently change the desktop wallpaper to prevent 
monotony 
Explanation 516. Correct Answer: C. Disable unnecessary 
services and ports on the workstations. By disabling 
unnecessary services and ports, you reduce the number of 
potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities, thus improving the 
security baseline of the workstations. 
Option A is incorrect. Installing multiple antivirus solutions 
can lead to conflicts and may degrade system performance. It’s 
better to have one robust, updated antivirus solution. 
Option B is incorrect. While cyber hygiene tips can be 
informative, they don’t directly contribute to the technical 
security baseline of a workstation. 
	
 
1529

Option D is incorrect. Changing the desktop wallpaper does 
nothing for security. Its primary purpose is aesthetics. 
Question 517. A large financial institution is planning to 
upgrade its IT infrastructure to allow for a more efficient use of 
hardware resources, faster deployment of applications, and 
reduced server provisioning times. While evaluating different 
technologies, which of the following would directly address 
these needs? 
(A)       Network Segmentation 
(B)       Intrusion Detection System 
(C)       Virtualization 
(D)       Multi-Factor Authentication 
Explanation 517. Correct Answer: C. Virtualization. 
Virtualization allows multiple virtual machines to run on a 
single physical host, maximizing the use of hardware resources. 
It enables rapid provisioning and deployment of new servers 
and applications, addressing the requirements of the financial 
institution. 
Option A is incorrect. Network segmentation divides a 
network into smaller subnetworks, primarily for security and 
performance reasons. While it’s a best practice, it doesn’t 
address the efficient use of hardware or rapid deployment of 
applications. 
Option B is incorrect. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
monitors and detects malicious activities in a network. While 
crucial for security, it doesn’t cater to hardware resource 
efficiency or faster server provisioning. 
	
 
1530

Option D is incorrect. Multi-Factor Authentication is a security 
process in which a user provides multiple methods of 
identification to authenticate their identity. It doesn’t impact 
hardware resource efficiency or application deployment times. 
Question 518. The security team of a multinational company 
deployed a network of honeypots globally, making it appear as 
an interconnected and realistic environment. They aim to study 
coordinated multi-stage attacks. This deceptive setup is known 
as: 
(A)       Firewall Cluster 
(B)       Virtual LAN (VLAN) 
(C)       Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Prevention 
(D)       Honeynet 
Explanation 518. Correct Answer: D. Honeynet. A honeynet 
is essentially a network of honeypots. It is designed to be 
attractive to attackers, making them believe they are attacking a 
real network, while in reality, they are being observed, and their 
tactics and techniques are being analyzed. 
Option A is incorrect. A Firewall Cluster is a group of 
firewalls operating together to increase reliability and 
performance. It doesn’t serve as a decoy to attract attackers. 
Option B is incorrect. A Virtual LAN (VLAN) is a network 
protocol used to create logically segmented networks within a 
physical network, improving performance and security. It’s not 
a decoy system. 
	
 
1531

Option C is incorrect. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) 
Prevention solutions focus on identifying and mitigating large-
scale attempts to disrupt network service availability. They do 
not present a deceptive environment for attackers. 
Question 519. Sophia, the CFO of a medium-sized company, 
received a call from an individual claiming to be from the IT 
department. The caller requested her login details for a “critical 
system update.” Suspecting something wasn’t right, Sophia 
hung up and contacted her IT department, which confirmed no 
such call was made by them. Which type of attack did Sophia 
most likely experience? 
(A)       Vishing 
(B)       Phishing 
(C)       SQL Injection 
(D)       Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
Explanation 519. Correct Answer: A. Vishing. Vishing, or 
voice phishing, is an attack where fraudsters use the telephone 
to mislead individuals into revealing personal information or 
login credentials. 
Option B is incorrect. Phishing is typically an attempt to 
obtain sensitive information through deceptive emails and 
websites, not voice calls. 
Option C is incorrect. SQL Injection is an attack type that tries 
to execute malicious SQL statements in a database. It is not 
related to voice calls. 
	
 
1532

Option D is incorrect. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a 
type of attack where the attacker tricks the victim into 
submitting a malicious request. This is unrelated to voice call 
scenarios. 
Question 520. Sophia received an email from her bank asking 
her to urgently update her personal details due to a system 
upgrade. The email contains a link that redirects to a website 
that looks similar to her bank’s website. Which of the following 
should she do FIRST? 
(A)       Follow the link and promptly update her personal details 
to avoid any inconvenience 
(B)       Forward the email to her friends and family to ensure 
they are also aware of the bank's system upgrade 
(C)       Delete the email immediately without taking any action 
(D)       Contact her bank through official channels to verify 
the authenticity of the email 
Explanation 520. Correct Answer: D. Contact her bank 
through official channels to verify the authenticity of the 
email. Before taking action based on an unsolicited email, 
especially one that asks for personal information or credentials, 
it’s essential to verify its legitimacy directly with the institution 
or entity it claims to represent. 
Phishing attacks often use fear, urgency, or perceived authority 
to lure victims into providing sensitive data. The best defense 
against such attempts is to independently verify any unexpected 
or suspicious requests before taking action. 
	
 
1533

Option A is incorrect. Directly responding to a potential 
phishing email by providing personal details is a common 
mistake, making the user vulnerable to fraud and identity theft. 
Option B is incorrect. Forwarding a potentially malicious 
email to others can further propagate the threat and possibly 
compromise their security as well. 
Option C is incorrect. While deleting the email might prevent 
Sophia from falling for the phishing attempt, it’s still a good 
practice to inform the bank about the suspicious email so they 
can take appropriate measures and warn other customers. 
Question 521. Tech Enterprises is planning to release a new 
product. As part of the product’s creation, they’ve sourced 
components from various vendors. The security team is tasked 
with assessing risks linked to the supply chain. Which of the 
following is the MOST concerning risk when sourcing 
components from multiple vendors? 
(A)       Difficulty in tracking product warranty details from 
multiple vendors 
(B)       Increased product assembly time due to varied vendor 
delivery timelines 
(C)       Potential for introduction of insecure or 
compromised components 
(D)       The need for multiple purchase orders, leading to 
increased paperwork 
Explanation 521. Correct Answer: C. Potential for 
introduction of insecure or compromised components. When 
components are sourced from multiple vendors, there is a 
	
 
1534

heightened risk that one or more components might have 
vulnerabilities or could be compromised, thus impacting the 
security of the overall product. 
The integrity and security of components are vital in product 
development, especially when those components are part of the 
supply chain from various vendors. If one vendor has lax 
security measures or gets compromised, the components they 
supply can introduce vulnerabilities into the finished product, 
affecting its overall security posture and potentially leading to 
data breaches or other cyber threats. 
Option A is incorrect. While tracking warranties is an 
operational concern, it doesn’t pose a direct security risk when 
sourcing components from multiple vendors. 
Option B is incorrect. Product assembly time and vendor 
delivery timelines are logistical and operational concerns, not 
primary security risks associated with supply chain vendors. 
Option D is incorrect. Managing multiple purchase orders is a 
business process challenge, not a primary security concern. 
Question 522. ThetaTech, a financial institution, wants to 
upgrade its authentication system for high-net-worth customers 
accessing their accounts online. Besides the traditional 
password, they want to include a method that captures unique 
physical or behavioral characteristics. Which type of 
authentication method should ThetaTech consider? 
(A)       Token-based authentication 
(B)       Geolocation tracking 
	
 
1535

(C)       Biometrics 
(D)       Smart card 
Explanation 522. Correct Answer: C. Biometrics. Biometrics 
authentication involves recognizing an individual based on their 
unique physical or behavioral characteristics, such as 
fingerprints, retina scans, or voice recognition. 
Option A is incorrect. Token-based authentication provides 
users with a device or software token that generates a time-
sensitive code. It doesn’t capture physical or behavioral 
characteristics. 
Option B is incorrect. Geolocation tracking determines a 
user’s location but doesn’t involve capturing unique physical or 
behavioral traits. 
Option D is incorrect. A smart card is a physical card that 
contains electronic information. It can be used for 
authentication, but it does not inherently capture unique 
physical or behavioral characteristics. 
Question 523. A software development team in a large 
corporation decided to use an unauthorized cloud-based tool to 
host and manage their source code. The team believed it would 
increase their productivity, even though it was not approved by 
the IT department. A few weeks later, unauthorized access to 
their project data was detected. Which threat actor concept 
BEST describes the situation? 
(A)       Insider threat 
(B)       Hacktivist 
	
 
1536

(C)       Shadow IT 
(D)       Organized crime syndicate 
Explanation 523. Correct Answer: C. Shadow IT. Shadow IT 
refers to any IT systems or solutions used within an 
organization without organizational approval or oversight. This 
can introduce vulnerabilities, as the unauthorized systems might 
not meet the security standards set by the organization’s IT 
department. In this scenario, the software development team’s 
unauthorized use of a cloud tool exemplifies Shadow IT. 
Option A is incorrect. While the software development team 
acted without approval, their intention was to increase 
productivity, not to harm the organization. Therefore, this 
situation does not fit the typical definition of an “insider threat,” 
which usually has malicious intent. 
Option B is incorrect. Hacktivists are motivated by political or 
social causes. There’s no evidence in the scenario to suggest 
that political or social motivations were behind the team’s 
decision. 
Option D is incorrect. While the data was accessed without 
authorization, there’s no evidence to suggest that this was the 
work of an organized crime syndicate. The main issue at hand is 
the unauthorized use of IT resources, which is a hallmark of 
Shadow IT. 
Question 524. TechHaus has recently experienced multiple 
security breaches where unauthorized personnel have managed 
to infiltrate their server rooms after hours. To enhance security 
	
 
1537

measures, the company decided to deploy a new system. Which 
of the following options would BEST detect human intruders 
based on their body heat even in complete darkness? 
(A)       Installing CCTV cameras with LED lights 
(B)       Using ultrasonic motion sensors 
(C)       Deploying infrared (IR) sensors 
(D)       Implementing RFID badge readers at the entrance 
Explanation 524. Correct Answer: C. Deploying infrared 
(IR) sensors. Infrared (IR) sensors detect infrared radiation, 
such as the heat emitted by the human body. This makes them 
particularly effective in detecting human intruders, even in 
complete darkness, based on the body heat they emit. 
Option A is incorrect. While CCTV cameras with LED lights 
can provide visual surveillance, they rely on light to produce 
images and may not detect intruders in complete darkness as 
efficiently as infrared sensors. 
Option B is incorrect. Ultrasonic motion sensors detect 
movement through sound waves, not body heat, making them 
less efficient in differentiating between a human intruder and 
other moving objects. 
Option D is incorrect. RFID badge readers control access at 
entry points but do not detect human intruders based on their 
body heat inside a facility. 
Question 525. After a series of phishing attacks, the IT 
department of BetaTech Corp noticed that several employees 
were using easily guessable passwords. The security team 
	
 
1538

decided to recommend the use of password managers to assist 
employees in creating and remembering strong passwords. 
Which of the following is a PRIMARY benefit of using 
password managers in this context? 
(A)       Password managers automatically update the operating 
system 
(B)       Password managers can generate and store complex 
passwords 
(C)       Password managers always prevent phishing attacks 
(D)       Password managers allow the reuse of strong passwords 
across multiple platforms 
Explanation 525. Correct Answer: B. Password managers 
can generate and store complex passwords. Password 
managers can automatically generate complex passwords that 
meet a variety of criteria (e.g., length, use of special characters, 
avoidance of easily guessable terms) and store them securely. 
This helps users maintain strong, unique passwords for every 
service they use without needing to remember each one. 
Option A is incorrect. Password managers are designed for 
generating, retrieving, and storing complex passwords, not for 
updating the operating system. 
Option C is incorrect. While password managers can help 
reduce the risk of successful phishing attacks by storing 
passwords securely and autofilling them on recognized 
websites, they don’t always prevent phishing attacks, especially 
if a user is deceived into entering credentials on a fake website. 
	
 
1539

Option D is incorrect. One of the primary benefits of password 
managers is to ensure that users have unique passwords for each 
application or service. Reusing passwords, even if strong, across 
multiple platforms poses a security risk. 
Question 526. During a routine scan, the security team at a 
graphic design firm discovers that an employee downloaded an 
image from an email and subsequently, unusual network traffic 
was detected originating from that employee’s workstation. The 
image appeared normal when opened. What type of attack 
might have been used in this situation? 
(A)       Image Steganography Malware 
(B)       Password Brute Force 
(C)       Phishing 
(D)       Port Scanning 
Explanation 526. Correct Answer: A. Image Steganography 
Malware. Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, 
message, image, or video within another file, message, image, 
or video. Image steganography specifically involves hiding 
malicious code within an image. When the image is downloaded 
or opened, the malicious code can be executed without the 
victim’s knowledge. 
Option B is incorrect. Password Brute Force is an attack 
method where an attacker attempts to guess a user’s password 
by systematically trying every possible combination of letters, 
numbers, and symbols until the correct password is discovered. 
Option C is incorrect. Phishing typically involves deceptive 
emails or messages attempting to trick recipients into divulging 
	
 
1540

sensitive information. While images can be used in phishing 
attempts, the scenario described does not indicate an attempt to 
extract information from the employee. 
Option D is incorrect. Port Scanning is an attempt to discover 
open ports on a computer, which can reveal services running on 
those ports. It does not involve the use of images. 
Question 527. Acme Corp. is in the early stages of a potential 
lawsuit, and their legal department has just issued a notice for e-
discovery related to email communications of a former 
executive. As an IT security professional, which of the 
following should be your FIRST action? 
(A)       Start a full backup of the company's email server 
(B)       Identify and isolate the email accounts related to the 
former executive 
(C)       Immediately delete all emails that are more than two 
years old 
(D)       Inform the media about the upcoming lawsuit 
Explanation 527. Correct Answer: B. Identify and isolate 
the email accounts related to the former executive. In the 
context of e-discovery, it’s crucial to locate and preserve 
electronically stored information (ESI) that could be relevant to 
the lawsuit. The first step would be to identify and isolate the 
specific email accounts or data sources relevant to the request to 
ensure they are not tampered with or deleted. 
Option A is incorrect. While backups are essential, a blanket 
backup of the email server may not specifically cater to the e-
	
 
1541

discovery request. Focusing on the particular data in question is 
more pertinent. 
Option C is incorrect. Deleting potential evidence, especially 
after a notice for e-discovery, could lead to legal penalties and is 
not a recommended action. 
Option D is incorrect. Informing the media is not a primary 
step in the e-discovery process and can have detrimental effects 
on the company’s reputation. 
Question 528. A cloud-based e-commerce company wants to 
ensure that its inventory system automatically updates the stock 
levels on its website and third-party sales platforms whenever a 
sale occurs. What should the company leverage to achieve this 
real-time synchronization? 
(A)       Regularly backup the inventory system and restore it on 
the website and sales platforms 
(B)       Rely on customers to report discrepancies in stock levels 
(C)       Use Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to 
integrate the inventory system with the website and third-
party platforms 
(D)       Conduct daily stock audits and manually update all 
platforms 
Explanation 528. Correct Answer: C. Use Application 
Programming Interfaces (APIs) to integrate the inventory 
system with the website and third-party platforms. Using 
APIs ensures real-time data synchronization between systems. 
Whenever a sale occurs, the inventory system can automatically 
update stock levels across all platforms. 
	
 
1542

Option A is incorrect. Backing up and restoring the inventory 
system is a reactive and inefficient approach. It won’t provide 
real-time stock updates. 
Option B is incorrect. Relying on customers to report stock 
discrepancies is not proactive and could lead to negative 
customer experiences and potential lost sales. 
Option D is incorrect. Manual updates are time-consuming and 
prone to human error, and they don’t support real-time stock 
level synchronization. 
Question 529. A financial organization’s high-security data 
center has an authentication system for its main entry. If the 
system encounters an unexpected error, the organization wants 
to ensure that no one can gain access to the data center until the 
system is fixed. Which configuration should the authentication 
system be set to? 
(A)       Fail-open 
(B)       Fail-closed 
(C)       Fail-secure 
(D)       Fail-passive 
Explanation 529. Correct Answer: B. Fail-closed. Fail-
closed, also known as fail-secure, is a mode where if a system 
fails, it denies all requests by default, effectively “closing” 
access. In high-security environments, it’s often preferred to 
prevent any unauthorized access during system failures. 
	
 
1543

Option A is incorrect. Fail-open is the opposite of what the 
organization wants. In a fail-open scenario, if the system fails, it 
would allow all requests by default. 
Option C is incorrect. While “fail-secure” is another term for 
“fail-closed”, the use of both terms in the options can confuse 
the test-taker. In this context, option B is the more appropriate 
choice. 
Option D is incorrect. Fail-passive isn’t a standard term in the 
context of authentication failure modes. Fail-open and fail-
closed (or fail-secure) are the primary recognized terms. 
Question 530. Jane, a security analyst, receives a report about 
network slowdowns happening at specific times of the day. 
After investigating, she discovers that a device is flooding the 
network with traffic, causing legitimate requests to be dropped. 
Which type of attack is this device likely performing? 
(A)       Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) 
(B)       ARP poisoning 
(C)       MAC flooding 
(D)       DNS amplification 
Explanation 530. Correct Answer: C. MAC flooding. MAC 
flooding is an attack that aims to flood the switch’s MAC table 
with fake MAC addresses until the table overflows. Once it 
overflows, the switch acts as a hub broadcasting packets to all 
machines in the network. This can cause significant slowdowns 
and disruptions. 
	
 
1544

Option A is incorrect. A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) 
attack uses multiple compromised devices to flood a target with 
traffic, usually to overwhelm it and take it offline. The scenario 
describes an internal network slowdown, not an external attack 
on services. 
Option B is incorrect. ARP poisoning is an attack where false 
ARP messages are sent over a local area network. It’s used to 
link an attacker’s MAC address with the IP address of another 
host. While it can cause disruptions, the primary intent is not to 
flood the network. 
Option D is incorrect. DNS amplification is a type of DDoS 
attack where an attacker uses publically-accessible DNS servers 
to flood a target system with DNS response traffic. This does 
not fit the internal network flooding described in the scenario. 
Question 531. A medium-sized financial firm has noticed a 
series of unauthorized transactions moving funds from 
legitimate accounts to overseas locations. After investigating, it 
was found that a group was responsible for exploiting 
vulnerabilities in the firm’s transaction system. Which of the 
following motivations is most likely driving this group’s 
actions? 
(A)       Seeking notoriety within the hacker community 
(B)       Financial gain from unauthorized transactions 
(C)       Demonstrating political beliefs against financial 
institutions 
(D)       Espionage to uncover the firm's investment strategies 
	
 
1545

Explanation 530. Correct Answer: B. Financial gain from 
unauthorized transactions. The unauthorized transactions 
moving funds to overseas locations indicate a direct attempt to 
illicitly acquire funds, pointing towards a motivation of 
financial gain. 
Option A is incorrect. There’s no evidence to suggest the 
group’s actions are driven by a desire for recognition or 
notoriety. The focus is on moving funds. 
Option C is incorrect. While some groups might target 
financial institutions to make a political statement, the 
unauthorized transactions to overseas accounts suggest a 
financial motive, not a political one. 
Option D is incorrect. There’s no indication the group is 
interested in the firm’s investment strategies. The activity is 
focused on moving money, not gathering intelligence. 
Question 532. Country A and Country B are engaged in an 
ongoing territorial dispute. Suddenly, critical infrastructure 
facilities in Country B, such as power plants and transportation 
hubs, experience systematic cyberattacks. No ransom demand is 
made, and the attacks lead to significant disruption. What is the 
most probable motivation behind these cyberattacks? 
(A)       Financial gain from market disruptions 
(B)       Ethical hackers testing vulnerabilities 
(C)       Disruption due to philosophical disagreements with 
Country B's policies 
(D)       Acts of cyberwarfare to weaken Country B's position 
	
 
1546

Explanation 532. Correct Answer: D. Acts of cyberwarfare 
to weaken Country B’s position. Given the context of the 
territorial dispute and the specific targeting of critical 
infrastructures without any ransom demand, it’s highly likely 
that these attacks were intended as acts of cyberwarfare by 
Country A or its sympathizers to exert pressure on Country B. 
Option A is incorrect. While market disruptions can be 
exploited for financial gains, the context of a territorial dispute 
and the nature of the attacks suggest a motive tied to 
geopolitical strategy rather than financial advantage. 
Option B is incorrect. Ethical hackers typically identify and 
report vulnerabilities rather than exploit them to cause 
widespread disruption. 
Option C is incorrect. The attacks were too specific and large-
scale to be the work of individuals or groups motivated solely 
by philosophical disagreements. 
Question 533. Alex, an employee at XYZ Corp, noticed an 
unfamiliar USB drive lying in the company parking lot. Out of 
curiosity, Alex plugged the device into his workstation. Almost 
immediately, his antivirus program detected malicious software 
trying to execute. What type of attack did Alex likely 
encounter? 
(A)       Man-in-the-Middle Attack 
(B)       Evil Twin 
(C)       Spear Phishing 
(D)       USB Drop Attack 
	
 
1547

Explanation 533. Correct Answer: D. USB Drop Attack. A 
USB Drop Attack involves leaving malware-infected removable 
devices, such as USB drives, in places where they can be found 
and used by unsuspecting individuals. Once the device is 
plugged into a computer, it can potentially execute malicious 
software or scripts. 
Option A is incorrect. A Man-in-the-Middle Attack involves an 
attacker secretly intercepting and possibly altering the 
communication between two parties without them noticing. It is 
not related to USB devices. 
Option B is incorrect. Evil Twin refers to a rogue Wi-Fi access 
point that appears to be legitimate but is set up to eavesdrop on 
wireless communications. It doesn’t pertain to USB devices. 
Option C is incorrect. Spear Phishing is a targeted attempt to 
steal sensitive information through deceptive emails directed at 
specific individuals or companies. It is not associated with USB 
devices. 
Question 534. A company is setting up a secure communication 
channel between its headquarters and a remote branch office. To 
ensure that data transmitted over this channel originates from a 
legitimate system at the branch office, the company is 
considering using digital certificates. Which authentication 
method for systems is the company contemplating? 
(A)       Kerberos authentication 
(B)       Password-based authentication 
(C)       Certificate-based authentication 
(D)       Biometric-based authentication 
	
 
1548

Explanation 534.  Correct Answer: C. Certificate-based 
authentication. Certificate-based authentication uses digital 
certificates to verify the identity of systems or individuals. In 
the given scenario, the company wants to verify that data 
transmitted over the communication channel originates from a 
legitimate system, making digital certificates an appropriate 
choice. 
Option A is incorrect. Kerberos authentication is a ticket-based 
authentication protocol primarily used to authenticate users in a 
network, not specifically for system-to-system authentication 
using digital certificates. 
Option B is incorrect. Password-based authentication requires 
systems or users to provide a secret password to prove their 
identity. It doesn’t involve the use of digital certificates. 
Option D is incorrect. Biometric-based authentication involves 
using unique physical or behavioral attributes of a person for 
verification, such as fingerprints or facial patterns. It is not 
applicable to system-to-system authentication. 
Question 535. BioGen Inc., a biotechnology company, has 
implemented a layered security approach. They are considering 
adding a human element to their security measures for their 
research labs. Which of the following would best provide the 
ability to evaluate and respond to various security situations 
with human judgment? 
(A)       Installing biometric locks 
(B)       Employing security guards 
	
 
1549

(C)       Implementing an access control vestibule 
(D)       Deploying AI-driven security cameras 
Explanation 535. Correct Answer: B. Employing security 
guards. Security guards provide the advantage of human 
judgment and can evaluate, respond, and adapt to a wide variety 
of security situations, making them ideal for adding a human 
element to a layered security approach. 
Option A is incorrect. While biometric locks can control access 
based on unique human features, they don’t provide the 
evaluation and response capabilities of a human guard. 
Option C is incorrect. An access control vestibule controls 
access into an area, often with two sets of doors, but it does not 
provide the evaluation, judgment, or immediate response that a 
security guard does. 
Option D is incorrect. While AI-driven security cameras can 
provide advanced monitoring and potentially detect suspicious 
activities, they don’t replace the judgment and immediate 
response capabilities of a human security guard. 
Question 536. An environmental NGO’s website was hacked 
and replaced with a message decrying their recent campaign 
against deforestation, claiming they are spreading 
misinformation. The website was left with a manifesto 
promoting responsible forestry and sustainable logging 
practices. Which type of threat actor is MOST likely behind this 
incident? 
(A)       Ransomware gang 
	
 
1550

(B)       Organized crime syndicate 
(C)       Hacktivist 
(D)       Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) 
Explanation 536. Correct Answer: C. Hacktivist. The attack 
seems to be motivated by ideological differences regarding 
deforestation and sustainable logging. Hacktivists typically 
conduct cyber actions to make political or social statements. 
The replacement of the NGO’s website with a manifesto 
supports the idea that this is an ideologically motivated attack, 
typical of hacktivists. 
Option A is incorrect. Ransomware gangs primarily focus on 
encrypting data and demanding payment for its release. There is 
no mention of a ransom or encrypted data in the described 
scenario. 
Option B is incorrect. Organized crime syndicates are usually 
motivated by financial gains. The attack on the NGO’s website 
seems to be ideologically driven, not profit-driven. 
Option D is incorrect. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are 
highly organized, often state-sponsored groups that conduct 
prolonged cyber-espionage campaigns. Their motivations are 
typically strategic, political, or espionage-driven. The described 
attack doesn’t fit the profile of an APT operation. 
Question 537. After a major data breach in XYZ Corporation, 
the management decided to understand the primary reason 
behind the incident to prevent such occurrences in the future. 
Which of the following approaches should the incident response 
	
 
1551

team prioritize to determine the fundamental cause of the 
breach? 
(A)       Perform vulnerability scanning on all servers 
(B)       Review firewall logs for the past week 
(C)       Conduct a root cause analysis 
(D)       Upgrade all security software 
Explanation 537. Correct Answer: C. Conduct a root cause 
analysis. Root cause analysis (RCA) is a systematic process for 
identifying the origin of problems or faults and deciding on the 
most suitable approach to take to prevent recurrence. In the 
context of a security incident, RCA helps in determining the 
primary reason behind the breach. 
Option A is incorrect. While vulnerability scanning is essential 
for understanding potential weaknesses in servers, it does not 
directly identify the fundamental cause of a past incident. 
Option B is incorrect. Firewall logs can provide insights about 
traffic patterns and potential attacks but may not directly reveal 
the root cause of a breach. 
Option D is incorrect. Upgrading security software is a 
reactive measure and does not ensure understanding or 
addressing the core reason for a breach. 
Question 538. AlphaCorp is migrating to cloud infrastructure 
and wants to ensure all virtual machines (VMs) are securely 
configured from the onset. Before deploying multiple VM 
instances, what should AlphaCorp do to ensure each VM starts 
from a secure configuration? 
	
 
1552

(A)       Use the default VM templates provided by the cloud 
provider 
(B)       Establish a secure baseline for VM configurations 
and use it for deployment 
(C)       Regularly backup all VMs 
(D)       Use multi-factor authentication for cloud access 
Explanation 538. Correct Answer: B. Establish a secure 
baseline for VM configurations and use it for deployment. 
Establishing a secure baseline for VM configurations ensures 
that each VM is deployed with a set of standard security 
settings, reducing vulnerabilities from default configurations or 
potential misconfigurations. 
Option A is incorrect. Relying solely on default VM templates 
provided by cloud providers may not meet the specific security 
requirements of an organization. Customizing and creating a 
secure baseline is more effective. 
Option C is incorrect. While regular backups are essential for 
data recovery, they do not directly ensure that VMs start from a 
secure configuration. 
Option D is incorrect. Multi-factor authentication is a crucial 
security measure for accessing cloud resources, but it doesn’t 
ensure that VMs are deployed with secure configurations. 
Question 539. An employee receives a call from someone 
claiming to be from the IT department. The caller says there’s 
an urgent update required on the employee’s computer and asks 
for login credentials to perform the update remotely. The 
	
 
1553

employee becomes suspicious because of which red flag 
regarding impersonation? 
(A)       The caller did not use technical jargon 
(B)       IT normally sends email notifications about updates 
(C)       The employee was not expecting any updates 
(D)       The caller's voice sounded unfamiliar 
Explanation 539. Correct Answer: B. IT normally sends 
email notifications about updates. If the organization’s 
standard procedure is to send email notifications about updates, 
an unsolicited call asking for credentials would be a clear red 
flag. 
Impersonation is a common tactic used in social engineering 
attacks where the attacker pretends to be someone the victim 
trusts. Recognizing deviations from standard procedures can 
help identify impersonation attempts. 
Option A is incorrect. The use or lack of technical jargon isn’t 
a reliable indicator of impersonation. Some genuine IT 
personnel might avoid jargon to make things clearer for non-
tech-savvy employees. 
Option C is incorrect. While unexpected updates can be 
suspicious, they aren’t necessarily indicative of impersonation 
on their own. Legitimate unexpected updates can occur. 
Option D is incorrect. An unfamiliar voice isn’t a reliable 
indicator since large organizations might have many IT 
personnel that an employee hasn’t interacted with. 
	
 
1554

Question 540. An organization with a single physical network 
infrastructure wants to separate the traffic of its finance 
department from that of the HR department. They do not want 
to set up entirely new physical networks but want to ensure that 
data packets from one department do not mix with the other’s. 
What should the organization implement? 
(A)       Air-gapped network 
(B)       DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) 
(C)       VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) 
(D)       VPN (Virtual Private Network) 
Explanation 540. Correct Answer: C. VLAN (Virtual Local 
Area Network). A VLAN allows a network administrator to 
create a logical network within a physical network. This logical 
segmentation can separate the traffic of different departments, 
ensuring that data packets from one VLAN do not mix with 
another, effectively isolating them. 
Option A is incorrect. An air-gapped network is a physically 
isolated network and would require setting up a new physical 
network. 
Option B is incorrect. A DMZ is a buffer zone between a 
private network and external networks. It doesn’t help in 
segmenting traffic within the internal network. 
Option D is incorrect. A VPN is used to create secure 
connections over an unsecured network. It does not logically 
segment traffic within a single physical network. 
	
 
1555

Question 541. After detecting suspicious activity on a network, 
a digital forensic analyst is dispatched to acquire data from a 
potential compromised system. The analyst decides to capture 
an image of the affected system’s memory. This technique of 
capturing volatile data is particularly beneficial because: 
(A)       It helps identify deleted files 
(B)       It can capture data in real-time operations 
(C)       It provides information on patch levels 
(D)       It offers insights into firewall configurations  
Explanation 541. Correct Answer: B. It can capture data in 
real-time operations. Memory acquisition allows forensic 
analysts to capture data in its current state, including data about 
running processes, open network connections, and contents of 
the system’s RAM. This can provide insights into malware or 
unauthorized activities that occurred in real-time. 
Option A is incorrect. While memory acquisition can 
sometimes provide information about recently accessed files, 
identifying deleted files is typically done through disk imaging 
and not memory acquisition. 
Option C is incorrect. Information about patch levels is usually 
gleaned from system configurations and logs, not directly from 
memory acquisition. 
Option D is incorrect. Firewall configurations are typically 
found in system configurations and logs, not directly from a 
memory acquisition. 
	
 
1556

Question 542. A company has faced multiple instances of 
unauthorized individuals gaining access to their office premises. 
Which of the following preventive security controls would be 
MOST effective in preventing unauthorized physical access? 
(A)       Implementing a log monitoring solution for network 
traffic 
(B)       Installing video surveillance cameras at all entry and 
exit points 
(C)       Conducting regular security awareness training for 
employees 
(D)       Implementing a multi-factor authentication system for 
network access. 
Explanation 542. Correct Answer: B. Installing video 
surveillance cameras at all entry and exit points. Installing 
video surveillance cameras at all entry and exit points acts as a 
preventive control by deterring unauthorized individuals from 
attempting to gain access, given the increased risk of detection 
and recording. 
Option A is incorrect. Implementing a log monitoring solution 
is a detective control that provides insights into network 
activities but doesn’t prevent unauthorized physical access. 
Option C is incorrect. Conducting regular security awareness 
training is a preventive measure, but its main focus is on 
making employees aware of security risks and best practices, 
not directly preventing unauthorized physical access. 
Option D is incorrect. Implementing a multi-factor 
authentication system is a preventive control for unauthorized 
	
 
1557

digital access but doesn’t address the prevention of 
unauthorized physical access. 
Question 543. A software development company is looking to 
migrate its legacy applications to a more modern infrastructure. 
They want to ensure the applications can be deployed 
consistently across multiple environments without the 
challenges of varying dependencies and configurations. Which 
approach would best achieve this goal? 
(A)       Virtual Machine Deployment 
(B)       Bare-Metal Deployment 
(C)       Containerization 
(D)       Serverless Computing 
Explanation 543. Correct Answer: C. Containerization 
Containerization encapsulates an application and its 
dependencies into a ‘container.’ This allows the application to 
be consistently deployed across different environments 
regardless of variations in configurations or dependencies. 
Option A is incorrect. While virtual machines provide an 
isolated environment for applications, they include the overhead 
of an entire guest OS and don’t directly address the challenge of 
application dependencies varying across environments. 
Option B is incorrect. Bare-metal deployment involves 
installing applications directly on hardware without 
virtualization or containers. This method does not inherently 
ensure consistent deployment across multiple environments. 
	
 
1558

Option D is incorrect. Serverless computing abstracts the 
infrastructure away from the developer, focusing on individual 
functions. While it provides scalability and simplicity, it doesn’t 
directly address consistent deployment across environments due 
to dependencies and configurations. 
Question 544. While conducting a security assessment, Lucy 
found that a specific application crashes when she inputs a 
string that is much longer than what the input field is designed 
to handle. This could potentially allow her to execute arbitrary 
code in the application’s context. What vulnerability is Lucy 
likely trying to exploit? 
(A)       SQL Injection 
(B)       Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
(C)       Buffer Overflow 
(D)       Directory Traversal 
Explanation 544. Correct Answer: C. Buffer Overflow. 
Buffer overflow vulnerabilities occur when data written to a 
buffer exceeds that buffer’s boundaries, potentially overwriting 
adjacent memory locations. If exploited successfully, it can lead 
to arbitrary code execution. 
Buffer overflow is a condition where an application writes more 
data to a buffer than it can hold, causing the excess data to 
overflow into adjacent memory spaces. When this happens, 
attackers can overwrite specific parts of the memory, which 
may lead to arbitrary code execution, application crashes, or 
data corruption. 
	
 
1559

Option A is incorrect. SQL Injection involves injecting 
malicious SQL statements into an entry field for execution, 
aiming to manipulate a database. It doesn’t relate to buffer 
boundaries or memory overflows. 
Option B is incorrect. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allows 
attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by 
other users. While this is an input validation flaw like a buffer 
overflow, XSS specifically targets script execution within web 
browsers and does not involve overflowing buffer boundaries. 
Option D is incorrect. Directory Traversal attacks aim to 
access files and directories stored outside the web root folder. 
They don’t involve overflowing buffer boundaries or memory 
overflows. 
Question 545. A major pharmaceutical company recently 
announced an increase in drug prices. Following the 
announcement, their website was taken offline by a DDoS 
attack, with a message posted online by a group claiming 
responsibility and demanding affordable healthcare for all. 
Which type of threat actor is MOST likely behind this attack? 
(A)       Unskilled attacker 
(B)       Insider threat 
(C)       Hacktivist 
(D)       Nation-state 
Explanation 545. Correct Answer: C. Hacktivist. Hacktivists 
are typically driven by political, social, or ideological motives. 
They use cyber attacks as a means to promote or protest certain 
issues. In this scenario, the attack on the pharmaceutical 
	
 
1560

company is a form of protest against their pricing policies, 
making it characteristic of hacktivist behavior. 
Option A is incorrect. Unskilled attackers generally conduct 
attacks for personal bragging rights or mischief. They are not 
usually driven by ideological motives like demanding 
affordable healthcare. 
Option B is incorrect. Insider threats stem from individuals 
within the organization, often driven by personal grievances or 
financial gain. The described scenario shows a motive tied to a 
broader social issue, not a personal or internal motive. 
Option D is incorrect. Nation-states conduct cyber operations 
for political, espionage, or military reasons. Protesting drug 
prices is not in line with their typical objectives. 
Question 546. After a security breach, Jake, a digital forensics 
investigator, arrives at the scene to collect a hard drive for 
examination. He labels the hard drive, records its serial number, 
photographs the scene, and ensures the hard drive is transported 
securely to the forensics lab. These steps are crucial to: 
(A)       Preserve the data's integrity on the hard drive 
(B)       Maintain the chain of custody 
(C)       Decrypt the data on the hard drive 
(D)       Implement a legal hold on the data 
Explanation 546. Correct Answer: B. Maintain the chain of 
custody. Maintaining a chain of custody is crucial to ensure that 
evidence is authentic and unchanged. This involves 
	
 
1561

documenting each step of the evidence handling process, from 
collection to analysis, ensuring its validity in legal proceedings. 
Option A is incorrect. While preserving the data’s integrity is 
crucial in forensics, the specific steps mentioned are primarily 
for maintaining the chain of custody. 
Option C is incorrect. Decrypting the data focuses on making 
encrypted data readable. The steps Jake took are related to 
documenting evidence handling, not decryption. 
Option D is incorrect. Implementing a legal hold ensures that 
specific data is preserved for legal reasons. The steps mentioned 
by Jake focus on documenting how the evidence was handled 
and preserved, not on a directive to retain it for legal purposes. 
Question 547. A security analyst has been tasked with 
investigating a possible data breach. While reviewing the 
network logs, the analyst noticed an unusual increase in 
outbound traffic to an unfamiliar IP address during non-business 
hours. The traffic appears to be encrypted and is associated with 
a known server containing sensitive data. Which of the 
following is the MOST likely explanation for this behavior? 
(A)       The server is downloading patches 
(B)       An employee is accessing the server remotely 
(C)       A backup of the server is being performed 
(D)       Data exfiltration is occurring 
Explanation 547. Correct Answer: D. Data exfiltration is 
occurring. Given that the traffic is encrypted, associated with a 
sensitive server, and is being sent to an unfamiliar IP during 
	
 
1562

non-business hours, the most likely scenario is that 
unauthorized data is being taken out of the network, which is 
known as data exfiltration. 
Option A is incorrect. While servers do download patches, 
these are usually inbound traffic from a known update source, 
not outbound to unfamiliar IPs. 
Option B is incorrect. While employees might access servers 
remotely, the traffic being encrypted and sent during non-
business hours to an unfamiliar IP makes this less likely. 
Option C is incorrect. Backups generally don’t result in 
encrypted outbound traffic to unfamiliar IP addresses, especially 
during non-business hours. 
Question 548. XYZ Corporation recently faced a major power 
outage that affected their primary data center. During the 
incident, it was found that there was no clear guidance on the 
steps to maintain or quickly restore business operations. To 
address this, which of the following policies should XYZ 
Corporation prioritize implementing? 
(A)       Data Classification Policy 
(B)       Business Continuity Policy 
(C)       Acceptable Use Policy 
(D)       Network Segmentation Strategy 
Explanation 548. Correct Answer: B. Business Continuity 
Policy. A Business Continuity Policy outlines the processes and 
procedures an organization should follow to ensure that 
essential functions can continue during and after a disaster. It 
	
 
1563

provides a roadmap for maintaining and quickly restoring 
business operations. 
Option A is incorrect. The Data Classification Policy is 
concerned with categorizing data based on its sensitivity but 
doesn’t address continuity of business operations during 
disruptions. 
Option C is incorrect. The Acceptable Use Policy specifies 
how the organization’s IT resources and networks can be used 
by employees. It doesn’t provide guidance on restoring business 
operations during a disaster. 
Option D is incorrect. While Network Segmentation Strategy 
is crucial for security, dividing the network into segments does 
not specifically address business continuity during major 
disruptions. 
Question 549. During a suspected security incident involving 
unauthorized access to sensitive data, Jake, an IT administrator, 
immediately disconnected the affected server from the network. 
Later, a digital forensic expert criticized Jake’s action. Which of 
the following is the MOST likely reason for the criticism? 
(A)       Jake should have left the server connected to capture 
more evidence from the attacker 
(B)       Jake should have immediately informed the company's 
legal department 
(C)       Jake should have taken an image of the server's 
memory before disconnecting it 
(D)       Jake should have updated the server's software to 
prevent further unauthorized access 
	
 
1564

Explanation 549. Correct Answer: C. Jake should have 
taken an image of the server’s memory before disconnecting 
it. Preserving the current state of a system, especially its volatile 
memory, is crucial during a digital forensic investigation. 
Volatile memory can contain critical evidence about an incident, 
but this evidence is lost once the system is powered off or 
restarted. 
Option A is incorrect. While sometimes monitoring an attacker 
can be valuable, it’s often more critical to prioritize the safety of 
data and systems over collecting additional evidence. 
Option B is incorrect. Although informing the legal 
department is an important step in many incident response 
processes, preserving the integrity and state of potential 
evidence comes first. 
Option D is incorrect. While updating the server’s software 
might be a future step to prevent incidents, the immediate 
priority during a suspected security incident is to preserve 
evidence. 
Question 550. ExamsDigest Corp, a technology company, 
recently conducted a security assessment to align with industry 
best practices. The company’s current security posture was 
compared to its desired future state, revealing discrepancies. 
Which of the following best describes the approach 
ExamsDigest Corp employed? 
(A)       Vulnerability Assessment 
(B)       Penetration Testing 
	
 
1565

(C)       Gap Analysis 
(D)       Threat Modeling 
Explanation 550. Correct Answer: C. Gap Analysis. Gap 
analysis is a method of comparing the current state of 
something (such as security measures) with a future desired 
state to identify the discrepancies or “gaps”. In the scenario, 
ExamsDigest Corp compared their current security posture to a 
desired future state, which is consistent with the process of gap 
analysis. 
Option A is incorrect. A vulnerability assessment focuses on 
identifying, quantifying, and ranking vulnerabilities in a system, 
not comparing the current state with a desired future state. 
Option B is incorrect. Penetration testing is an authorized 
simulated cyberattack on a system to evaluate its security, not to 
compare its current state with a desired future state. 
Option D is incorrect. Threat modeling is the process of 
identifying potential threats to a system and determining the risk 
they pose, not comparing the current state with a desired future 
state. 
Question 551. During an annual review, a company discovered 
that one of its critical systems had several unscheduled 
downtimes over the year. The CTO has recommended a move 
towards high availability architecture to address this. What is 
the PRIMARY concern when implementing high availability? 
(A)       Ensuring that there are no single points of failure 
(B)       Ensuring that the system is patched regularly 
	
 
1566

(C)       Implementing multi-factor authentication 
(D)       Storing backups in multiple geographical locations 
Explanation 551. Correct Answer: A. Ensuring that there 
are no single points of failure. In a high availability (HA) 
system, eliminating single points of failure is of utmost 
importance. By ensuring redundancy at every potential failure 
point, the system can remain operational even if a component 
fails. 
Option B is incorrect. While patching is important for security, 
it is not the primary concern when implementing high 
availability. 
Option C is incorrect. Multi-factor authentication is essential 
for secure access but does not directly relate to high availability 
architecture. 
Option D is incorrect. Having backups in various geographical 
locations is more relevant to disaster recovery than to high 
availability. 
Question 552. A government agency experienced a cyber 
incident where its communication platforms were breached. The 
intruders were not interested in extracting sensitive data or 
causing disruptions but were observed to be silently monitoring 
diplomatic communications for an extended period. What was 
the likely motivation of the attackers? 
(A)       To gain financial benefits from insider trading 
(B)       Espionage to understand and anticipate diplomatic 
moves 
	
 
1567

(C)       Disgruntlement of an internal employee 
(D)       An attempt to expand their cybercriminal network 
Explanation 552. Correct Answer: B. Espionage to 
understand and anticipate diplomatic moves. Silently 
monitoring diplomatic communications without exfiltrating data 
or causing disruptions indicates a motivation to understand, 
anticipate, and potentially manipulate governmental or 
diplomatic actions. This is a classic example of espionage. 
Option A is incorrect. While sensitive information might 
indeed be valuable for insider trading, the focus on diplomatic 
communications suggests a broader strategic intent rather than 
just financial gain. 
Option C is incorrect. A disgruntled employee might engage in 
sabotage or data leakage, but silently monitoring diplomatic 
communications indicates a higher level of strategy and 
sophistication usually beyond personal vendettas. 
Option D is incorrect. The attackers’ actions were specific to 
monitoring diplomatic channels and did not indicate an attempt 
to recruit more systems or individuals into a criminal network. 
Question 553. AlphaTech’s IT department is rolling out a new 
authentication protocol for remote workers. As part of the 
multifactor authentication process, employees are required to 
provide information that is memorized and cannot be physically 
taken from them. Which of the following represents this type of 
authentication factor? 
(A)       Fingerprint 
	
 
1568

(B)       Smart card 
(C)       PIN 
(D)       USB security key 
Explanation 553. Correct Answer: C. PIN. A Personal 
Identification Number (PIN) represents the “something you 
know” factor in multifactor authentication. This type of 
information is memorized by the user and is not a physical item 
that can be taken or a biological trait. 
Option A is incorrect. A fingerprint represents the “something 
you are” factor, which pertains to biometrics. 
Option B is incorrect. A smart card represents the “something 
you have” factor, as it’s a physical item that a user possesses. 
Option D is incorrect. A USB security key also falls under the 
“something you have” factor. It’s a physical device rather than 
memorized information. 
Question 554. An IT department in a large corporation spends 
several hours each day manually deploying patches and updates 
to thousands of workstations. Which of the following solutions 
would BEST enhance the efficiency of this process and save 
time for the IT team? 
(A)       Disable automatic updates and conduct monthly 
patching sessions 
(B)       Implement an automated patch management system 
(C)       Designate a dedicated team for patching that operates in 
shifts 
(D)       Educate users to install updates on their own 
	
 
1569

Explanation 554. Correct Answer: B. Implement an 
automated patch management system. By implementing an 
automated patch management system, the IT department can 
streamline the deployment of patches and updates across all 
workstations, ensuring consistency, reducing manual efforts, 
and saving valuable time. 
Option A is incorrect. Disabling automatic updates and 
conducting monthly patching sessions does not address the 
inefficiency of manual patching and might expose the systems 
to vulnerabilities for a longer time. 
Option C is incorrect. While designating a dedicated team 
might distribute the workload, it doesn’t eliminate the 
inefficiencies associated with manual patching. 
Option D is incorrect. Relying on users to install updates 
introduces inconsistency, potential delays, and additional risks, 
as not all users might have the technical knowledge or 
remember to update regularly. 
Question 555. A large e-commerce platform is facing 
challenges during peak sale periods, where the influx of users 
causes slowdowns and occasional outages. Which of the 
following solutions would BEST improve scalability during 
these high-demand times? 
(A)       Implement a centralized logging system 
(B)       Employ auto-scaling cloud solutions 
(C)       Increase the frequency of data backups 
(D)       Mandate regular security training for employees 
	
 
1570

Explanation 555. Correct Answer: B. Employ auto-scaling 
cloud solutions. Auto-scaling in cloud solutions automatically 
adjusts the number of computational resources based on the 
actual demand. During peak periods, resources can be 
automatically increased to handle the demand, ensuring the 
system remains scalable and responsive. 
Option A is incorrect. A centralized logging system is 
beneficial for monitoring and troubleshooting, but it does not 
directly address scalability during peak times. 
Option C is incorrect. Increasing the frequency of data 
backups is a good practice for data integrity and recovery but 
does not handle scalability concerns directly. 
Option D is incorrect. Regular security training is crucial for a 
company’s cybersecurity posture, but it does not address the 
architectural scalability of the platform. 
Question 556. Alex, a new intern at an IT company, wanted to 
access the internal company portal. Instead of typing 
“companyportal.com,” he accidentally typed 
“comapnyportal.com” and ended up on a site that looked 
identical but asked him to download a security certificate. This 
scenario best describes which type of attack? 
(A)       Spear Phishing 
(B)       Watering Hole Attack 
(C)       Typosquatting 
(D)       Man-in-the-Middle 
	
 
1571

Explanation 556. Correct Answer: C. Typosquatting. The 
attacker relies on typographical errors made by users when 
inputting a URL into a web browser, then potentially tries to 
exploit the user in some manner on the deceptive site. 
Typosquatting, also known as URL hijacking, involves attackers 
registering domains that are misspellings of popular websites. 
The intent is often to deceive users who mistype a URL, leading 
them to malicious websites. 
Option A is incorrect. Spear Phishing targets specific 
individuals or companies with tailored attempts to steal 
information. The described scenario revolves around the 
exploitation of typographical errors, not a targeted email attack. 
Option B is incorrect. A Watering Hole Attack involves 
compromising a specific website or service that the target 
frequently uses. It doesn’t rely on typographical errors. 
Option D is incorrect. A Man-in-the-Middle attack involves an 
attacker secretly intercepting and potentially altering 
communication between two parties. This is not described in the 
scenario. 
Question 557. A cloud infrastructure team frequently receives 
performance alerts from various resources in the environment. 
They want to ensure that relevant teams are immediately 
informed and can act upon any resource that crosses a 
performance threshold. What is the BEST way to accomplish 
this? 
(A)       Conduct a weekly meeting to review all performance 
	
 
1572

alerts 
(B)       Automate ticket creation for any resource that 
crosses the performance threshold and assign it to the 
relevant team 
(C)       Send all performance alerts to the cloud infrastructure 
team's email for review 
(D)       Disable performance monitoring to reduce alert fatigue 
Explanation 557. Correct Answer: B. Automate ticket 
creation for any resource that crosses the performance 
threshold and assign it to the relevant team. Automating the 
ticket creation process ensures that alerts are not overlooked and 
that the appropriate teams are informed in real-time, allowing 
for prompt resolution. 
Option A is incorrect. Conducting a weekly review does not 
allow for immediate action upon critical performance issues. 
Option C is incorrect. Sending all alerts to the team’s email 
might lead to alert fatigue and the possibility of overlooking 
critical alerts among less important ones. 
Option D is incorrect. Disabling performance monitoring 
would prevent the team from receiving important alerts and is 
not a practical solution. 
Question 558. A large corporation is investigating a potential 
insider threat incident. A security analyst is tasked with 
examining the OS-specific security logs of a Windows server 
where sensitive documents are stored. Which of the following 
entries in the logs would MOST likely indicate unauthorized 
	
 
1573

access attempts? 
(A)       Logs displaying Windows Update successful 
installations 
(B)       Entries showing a large number of failed login 
attempts followed by a successful login from a user outside 
of regular business hours 
(C)       Logs indicating scheduled disk defragmentation tasks 
(D)       Entries detailing successful printer connections and 
print jobs 
Explanation 558. Correct Answer: B. Entries showing a 
large number of failed login attempts followed by a 
successful login from a user outside of regular business 
hours. A sequence of failed login attempts followed by a 
successful login, especially outside of regular business hours, 
can be a strong indicator of a brute-force attack or unauthorized 
access attempt on a system. 
Option A is incorrect. Successful installations of Windows 
Updates are routine maintenance activities and do not directly 
imply unauthorized access. 
Option C is incorrect. Disk defragmentation tasks are part of 
regular system maintenance and are not indicative of 
unauthorized access. 
Option D is incorrect. While monitoring printer connections 
and print jobs can be relevant in certain security investigations, 
they are not direct indicators of unauthorized server access. 
	
 
1574

Question 559. A company wants to ensure that security 
incidents are detected and addressed as quickly as possible by 
on-duty personnel. Which of the following operational security 
controls would be BEST to implement for this purpose? 
(A)       Deploying a Network Intrusion Prevention System 
(NIPS) 
(B)       Establishing a 24/7 Security Operations Center 
(SOC) 
(C)       Creating a company-wide security policy 
(D)       Implementing end-to-end data encryption 
Explanation 559. Correct Answer: B. Establishing a 24/7 
Security Operations Center (SOC). A Security Operations 
Center (SOC) is an operational control that provides real-time 
monitoring, detection, and response to security incidents. With a 
24/7 SOC, the company ensures that there is always personnel 
available to handle security incidents as they occur. 
Option A is incorrect. Deploying a Network Intrusion 
Prevention System (NIPS) is a technical control. While it can 
prevent unauthorized activities on the network, it does not 
ensure that there is personnel available around the clock to 
address incidents. 
Option C is incorrect. Creating a company-wide security 
policy is a managerial control. It sets the guidelines and 
procedures for security but does not ensure continuous 
monitoring and immediate response to incidents. 
Option D is incorrect. Implementing end-to-end data 
encryption is a technical control that ensures data 
	
 
1575

confidentiality. While it protects data, it does not ensure that 
incidents are detected and addressed by on-duty personnel in 
real-time. 
Question 560. AlphaCorp’s IT department is reviewing 
password policies and wants to adopt a strategy that enhances 
security. Which of the following password strategies would be 
the MOST secure? 
(A)       Passwords should be at least 6 characters long, with no 
other requirements 
(B)       Passwords should be at least 10 characters long and 
include both uppercase and lowercase letters 
(C)       Passwords should be at least 8 characters long and 
include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and 
special characters 
(D)       Passwords should be at least 4 characters long and 
include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters 
Explanation 560. Correct Answer: C. Passwords should be 
at least 8 characters long and include uppercase letters, 
lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This 
option provides a balanced combination of length and 
complexity, making it more resistant to brute-force and 
dictionary attacks. 
Option A is incorrect. A 6-character password without any 
complexity requirements is easier to crack with modern 
computational capabilities. 
	
 
1576

Option B is incorrect. While having a 10-character length is 
beneficial, it lacks the additional complexity of numbers and 
special characters which can further bolster security. 
Option D is incorrect. The length is too short, and even with a 
mix of uppercase and lowercase, it does not provide the 
recommended security for passwords. 
Question 561. SecureTech Corp, a company dealing with 
sensitive client data, is redesigning its main office entrance to 
enhance security. They want to ensure that only one person 
gains access at a time, even if multiple people try to enter using 
a single authorized access badge. Which of the following would 
best serve this purpose? 
(A)       CCTV Cameras 
(B)       Mantrap 
(C)       Biometric Scanners 
(D)       Motion Detectors 
Explanation 561. Correct Answer: B. Mantrap. A mantrap, 
also known as an access control vestibule, is a physical security 
access control system comprising a small space with two sets of 
interlocking doors. The first door must close before the second 
door opens, ensuring that only one person can pass through at a 
time. This design prevents tailgating or piggybacking, where 
unauthorized individuals attempt to enter a secure area by 
following closely behind an authorized individual. 
Option A is incorrect. While CCTV cameras monitor and 
record activities, they do not physically prevent multiple people 
from entering at once using a single access badge. 
	
 
1577

Option C is incorrect. Biometric scanners provide a means of 
authenticating individuals based on unique physical or 
behavioral characteristics, but they do not prevent tailgating on 
their own. 
Option D is incorrect. Motion detectors can detect movement 
but do not restrict the entry of multiple individuals trying to use 
a single authorized access badge. 
Question 562. After a recent incident of vandalism, a corporate 
building is considering implementing security controls that 
would dissuade potential perpetrators. Which of the following 
would serve BEST as a deterrent control? 
(A)       Encrypting all stored data 
(B)       Installing biometric access controls on all entrances 
(C)       Implementing regular data backups 
(D)       Placing visible security signage indicating 24/7 
surveillance 
Explanation 562. Correct Answer: D. Placing visible 
security signage indicating 24/7 surveillance. Visible security 
signage serves as a deterrent control as it discourages potential 
perpetrators by signaling the risk of detection and 
consequences, even if actual surveillance might not be active at 
all times. 
Option A is incorrect. Encrypting all stored data is a preventive 
control that ensures unauthorized individuals cannot access or 
understand the encrypted information. It doesn’t deter acts of 
physical vandalism. 
	
 
1578

Option B is incorrect. Installing biometric access controls is a 
preventive control that restricts physical access based on unique 
biological attributes. While it prevents unauthorized access, it 
doesn’t act as a visible deterrent to vandalism or other potential 
threats. 
Option C is incorrect. Implementing regular data backups is a 
corrective control designed to restore data after a security 
incident. It doesn’t deter potential threats. 
Question 563. After deploying a new version of your 
company’s internal application, several users reported issues 
with accessing specific features. To investigate the root cause, 
you decided to review the application logs. What entry in the 
logs would most directly indicate a software bug or error related 
to the recent deployment? 
(A)       Entries showing successful user authentication 
timestamps 
(B)       Entries detailing the number of transactions completed 
by the application 
(C)       Entries with "ERROR" or "EXCEPTION" related 
to the specific feature being accessed 
(D)       Entries showing routine data backup operations 
Explanation 563. Correct Answer: C. Entries with 
“ERROR” or “EXCEPTION” related to the specific feature 
being accessed. In the context of application logs, entries 
labeled as “ERROR” or “EXCEPTION” generally indicate that 
the application encountered a problem. If these entries are 
related to the feature users are having trouble with, it points 
towards a software bug or issue related to the deployment. 
	
 
1579

Option A is incorrect. Successful user authentication entries 
would indicate that users are able to log into the application 
successfully, but they don’t provide insights into feature-
specific issues. 
Option B is incorrect. While the number of transactions could 
provide performance metrics or usage patterns, it doesn’t 
directly indicate a software bug or deployment-related issue. 
Option D is incorrect. Routine data backup operations are 
unrelated to application feature functionalities and won’t help in 
identifying deployment-related errors. 
Question 564. OmegaTech recently introduced an additional 
layer of security for its remote server access. Along with their 
usual passwords, employees now need to use a physical device 
they have with them to gain access. Which of the following 
represents this “something you have” factor in multifactor 
authentication? 
(A)       Password hint 
(B)       Facial recognition 
(C)       Hardware token 
(D)       Voice recognition 
Explanation 564. Correct Answer: C. Hardware token. 
Hardware tokens are devices that generate security codes for 
authentication purposes. Users are required to have this physical 
device on-hand, making it an example of the “something you 
have” factor in multifactor authentication. 
	
 
1580

Option A is incorrect. A password hint is related to “something 
you know” factor. Moreover, it’s not an authentication factor 
but rather an aid for recalling a password. 
Option B is incorrect. Facial recognition pertains to the 
“something you are” factor, which refers to biometric methods 
of authentication. 
Option D is incorrect. Voice recognition, similar to facial 
recognition, falls under the “something you are” factor, as it 
uses biometric identification. 
Question 565. A system administrator is setting up an 
authentication system for a new web application. Which of the 
following security controls falls under the technical category 
and ensures that users prove their identity before gaining 
access? 
(A)       Implementing a security awareness training program 
(B)       Conducting a background check for new employees 
(C)       Using multi-factor authentication 
(D)       Establishing a clean desk policy 
Explanation 565. Correct Answer: C. Using multi-factor 
authentication. Multi-factor authentication is a technical 
control that requires users to present two or more pieces of 
evidence (factors) before gaining access. It provides an 
additional layer of security to ensure that users are who they say 
they are. 
Option A is incorrect. Implementing a security awareness 
training program is an administrative control, as it involves 
	
 
1581

educating employees on security best practices rather than using 
technical measures to enforce them. 
Option B is incorrect. Conducting a background check is an 
administrative control as it involves vetting potential employees 
before they’re hired. This process doesn’t directly enforce 
technical measures on systems or networks. 
Option D is incorrect. Establishing a clean desk policy is an 
administrative control. It sets a guideline for employees to keep 
their workspaces tidy and free of sensitive information, rather 
than enforcing technical measures. 
Question 566. BetaTech is implementing a new authentication 
mechanism for its data center technicians. Instead of using key 
cards, technicians will now have to look into a device that maps 
a specific pattern to authenticate their identity. Which of the 
following is BetaTech likely implementing? 
(A)       Password system 
(B)       Retina scanning 
(C)       Hardware token 
(D)       Knowledge-based questions 
Explanation 566. Correct Answer: B. Retina scanning. 
Retina scanning is a biometric method that analyzes the unique 
patterns of a person’s retina to authenticate their identity. It’s 
categorized under the “something you are” factor as it relies on 
a unique physical characteristic. 
	
 
1582

Option A is incorrect. A password system pertains to the 
“something you know” factor since users need to remember 
their passwords to authenticate. 
Option C is incorrect. A hardware token represents the 
“something you have” factor, as it’s a device the user needs to 
possess. 
Option D is incorrect. Knowledge-based questions, such as 
“What’s the name of your first pet?”, fall under the “something 
you know” factor. 
Question 567. DataCenter Inc. is located in a region prone to 
protests and vandalism. They wish to enhance their perimeter 
security to deter potential intruders and make it visibly clear 
that unauthorized access is restricted. Which of the following 
physical security measures would be the most effective first line 
of defense for the company? 
(A)       Sliding Doors 
(B)       Security Cameras 
(C)       High-security Fencing 
(D)       Proximity Card Readers 
Explanation 567. Correct Answer: C. High-security Fencing. 
High-security fencing is a primary physical barrier that serves to 
deter, delay, and detect intrusions. It provides a clear visual 
indicator that delineates private property and can be equipped 
with additional deterrents such as barbed wire or sensors. 
Especially in areas prone to vandalism or protests, a robust 
fence acts as an immediate barrier to unauthorized access. 
	
 
1583

Option A is incorrect. Sliding doors are more applicable to 
internal security or entrance points and do not serve as a 
primary external barrier. 
Option B is incorrect. While security cameras monitor and 
record activities, they do not serve as a physical barrier to 
prevent or deter unauthorized access. 
Option D is incorrect. Proximity card readers are a form of 
access control that checks the credentials of individuals but do 
not serve as a primary deterrent against vandalism or protests. 
Question 568. Alice wants to access a restricted online portal. 
The portal asks her to enter a unique username and a secret 
passphrase only she should know. This process helps the system 
ensure that Alice is who she claims to be. What security concept 
is the portal employing? 
(A)       Authorization 
(B)       Accounting 
(C)       Multifactor authentication 
(D)       Authentication 
Explanation 568. Correct Answer: D. Authentication. 
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, 
system, or application. In the described scenario, Alice is 
proving her identity to the system by providing a unique 
username and a passphrase, which are credentials that 
supposedly only she possesses. 
	
 
1584

Option A is incorrect. Authorization determines what actions, 
resources, or services a verified identity is allowed to access or 
perform. It does not deal with verifying the identity itself. 
Option B is incorrect. Accounting involves tracking user 
activities and recording them for audit purposes. It does not 
directly verify a user’s identity. 
Option C is incorrect. Multifactor authentication requires two 
or more methods of verification from different categories of 
credentials. The scenario only mentioned a username and 
passphrase, which is a single-factor authentication method. 
Question 569. Employees at a renowned software development 
firm frequently visit an industry-related forum to discuss the 
latest trends and technologies. Over the past month, several 
employees reported malware infections shortly after accessing 
the forum. An investigation suggests the forum was 
compromised to target the company’s developers specifically. 
Which type of attack most accurately describes this scenario? 
(A)       Spear Phishing 
(B)       Watering Hole 
(C)       Drive-by Download 
(D)       Whaling 
Explanation 569. Correct Answer: B. Watering Hole. The 
attack focused on a particular site that employees at the targeted 
organization are known to visit, intending to compromise those 
specific individuals. 
	
 
1585

A watering hole attack involves compromising a website or 
online resource frequented by members of a particular group or 
organization. Once compromised, attackers can use the site to 
deploy malware to the targeted individuals. 
Option A is incorrect. Spear phishing is a targeted phishing 
attempt, typically via email, aimed at a specific individual or 
organization. It does not involve compromising websites that 
targets frequent. 
Option C is incorrect. While a drive-by download might be the 
method used to deliver malware once the forum was 
compromised, the overall strategy of targeting a specific site 
known to be frequented by the victims defines it as a watering 
hole attack. 
Option D is incorrect. Whaling is a type of phishing attack 
aimed at high-profile targets like CEOs or CFOs. It doesn’t 
involve compromising websites. 
Question 570. A cybersecurity analyst at XYZ Corp is looking 
to deploy a system that appears to be vulnerable and enticing to 
attackers. The main goal is to study the tactics, techniques, and 
procedures (TTPs) of potential adversaries, without them 
realizing that they’re interacting with a decoy. Which of the 
following would BEST meet this requirement? 
(A)       Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
(B)       Firewall 
(C)       Honeypot 
(D)       VPN Concentrator 
	
 
1586

Explanation 570. Correct Answer: C. Honeypot. A honeypot 
is a security mechanism designed to lure attackers into 
interacting with a seemingly vulnerable system. Its primary 
purpose is not to block or prevent attacks but to log and study 
them. By analyzing the activities on the honeypot, security 
professionals can gain insights into the methods and 
motivations of the attackers. 
Option A is incorrect. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is 
designed to detect malicious activities on a network and alert 
administrators. While it can identify threats, it doesn’t actively 
lure attackers. 
Option B is incorrect. A firewall is designed to block or allow 
traffic based on specific rules. It doesn’t present itself as a 
vulnerable target to lure attackers. 
Option D is incorrect. A VPN Concentrator is a device that 
provides remote access to a network over a secure connection. 
Its primary purpose is to enable secure remote access, not to act 
as a decoy for attackers. 
Question 571. A large financial organization wants to ensure 
that all employees understand the importance of cybersecurity 
and the role they play in safeguarding company assets. Which 
of the following managerial security controls will be MOST 
effective in achieving this? 
(A)       Installing a firewall at the network perimeter 
(B)       Regular security awareness training for employees 
(C)       Deploying an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
(D)       Encrypting all company data 
	
 
1587

Explanation 571. Correct Answer: B. Regular security 
awareness training for employees. Security awareness training 
is a managerial control aiming to educate employees about 
security risks and the necessary precautions they need to take. 
By regularly training employees, the organization ensures that 
all staff are aware of potential threats and their roles in 
cybersecurity. 
Option A is incorrect. Installing a firewall is a technical control 
focused on preventing unauthorized access to or from a private 
network. While it protects the network, it doesn’t directly 
educate employees about their roles in cybersecurity. 
Option C is incorrect. Deploying an Intrusion Detection 
System (IDS) is a technical control. It monitors network traffic 
for suspicious activities but does not directly focus on educating 
employees. 
Option D is incorrect. Encrypting company data is a technical 
control. While it ensures the confidentiality of data, it doesn’t 
address the employees’ knowledge or awareness regarding 
cybersecurity. 
Question 572. You are an IT security professional for a large 
corporation. After receiving reports about some users being 
unable to access external websites, you decided to review the 
firewall logs. Which of the following would be a PRIMARY 
indicator in the logs that a rule is blocking outbound traffic? 
(A)       Multiple entries of the same external IP address being 
ALLOWED 
(B)       Timestamps showing large gaps between entries 
	
 
1588

(C)       Entries showing DROP/REJECT action for 
outbound traffic to port 80 and 443 
(D)       Logs showing inbound traffic from multiple unknown 
external IP addresses 
Explanation 572. Correct Answer: C. Entries showing 
DROP/REJECT action for outbound traffic to port 80 and 
443. Port 80 and 443 are standard ports for HTTP and HTTPS 
respectively, which are commonly used for accessing websites. 
If users are unable to access external websites, it would make 
sense to check for DROP or REJECT actions for these ports in 
the firewall logs. 
Option A is incorrect. If an external IP address is being 
ALLOWED multiple times, it wouldn’t be the cause of users 
being unable to access websites. 
Option B is incorrect. Large gaps between timestamps in logs 
can indicate various issues, but they aren’t a direct indicator of a 
specific rule blocking outbound traffic. 
Option D is incorrect. While inbound traffic from unknown IP 
addresses might be of concern, it doesn’t specifically indicate an 
outbound traffic rule blocking users from accessing websites  
Question 573. A digital forensics investigator has just 
concluded an investigation regarding a potential insider threat. 
Before presenting the findings to the organization’s board, 
which of the following should the investigator ensure about the 
forensic report? 
(A)       The report includes technical jargon to showcase the 
	
 
1589

depth of the investigation 
(B)       The report emphasizes the investigator's credentials and 
experience 
(C)       The report provides a clear, concise summary of 
findings without unnecessary technical details 
(D)       The report contains detailed logs of every action taken 
by the investigator 
Explanation 573. Correct Answer: C. The report provides a 
clear, concise summary of findings without unnecessary 
technical details. A forensic report’s primary purpose is to 
convey the results of an investigation in a clear and 
understandable manner, especially to non-technical 
stakeholders. By avoiding unnecessary technical jargon and 
providing a concise summary, it ensures that the report’s 
findings are accessible to all intended readers. 
Option A is incorrect. While the depth of an investigation is 
important, inundating a report with technical jargon can make it 
difficult for non-technical individuals, such as board members, 
to understand the findings. 
Option B is incorrect. While the investigator’s credentials and 
experience might be important, they should not be the emphasis 
of the report. The focus should remain on the investigation’s 
findings and their implications. 
Option D is incorrect. While maintaining a detailed log of 
every action taken is crucial for the investigator’s records and 
ensuring the integrity of the investigation, including every detail 
	
 
1590

in the report can be overwhelming and detract from its main 
findings. 
Question 574. The security team at WidgetCorp is trying to 
identify potential insider threats. They have set up a SIEM 
solution with a custom dashboard showing unusual activities. 
Which of the following dashboard views would be MOST 
effective for quickly identifying an employee uploading large 
amounts of proprietary data to an external cloud storage 
service? 
(A)       Display of users who logged in during off-hours 
(B)       Graph of highest network bandwidth users 
(C)       List of most frequently used applications 
(D)       Visualization of failed login attempts 
Explanation 574. Correct Answer: B. Graph of highest 
network bandwidth users. When an employee uploads large 
amounts of data to an external service, it typically results in a 
significant spike in network bandwidth. Therefore, a dashboard 
view that visually displays the highest network bandwidth users 
can quickly alert the security team to potential data exfiltration 
activities. 
Option A is incorrect. While logging in during off-hours can 
be suspicious, it doesn’t directly correlate to data upload 
activities. 
Option C is incorrect. A list of the most frequently used 
applications might help in determining the common tools used 
within the organization, but it doesn’t specifically point to data 
upload actions. 
	
 
1591

Option D is incorrect. Visualization of failed login attempts 
could show potential brute-force or unauthorized access 
attempts, but it doesn’t directly indicate data uploading 
activities. 
Question 575. During a regular review of system logs, Alex, a 
security analyst, noticed an unusual pattern of network traffic 
originating from a single IP address. Instead of waiting for an 
automated system to flag this as suspicious, he decides to 
manually dive deeper into the data to identify any potential 
threats. What is Alex engaging in? 
(A)       Incident management 
(B)       Threat modeling 
(C)       Threat hunting 
(D)       Security monitoring 
Explanation 575. Correct Answer: C. Threat hunting. Threat 
hunting is a proactive approach where security professionals or 
analysts actively and manually search for signs of malicious 
activities within their network or systems, especially those 
threats that haven’t been automatically detected by traditional 
security tools. 
Option A is incorrect. Incident management refers to the 
process followed when managing and responding to a security 
incident. In this scenario, Alex is taking a proactive approach to 
find potential threats, not responding to an identified incident. 
Option B is incorrect. Threat modeling involves identifying 
potential threats and designing countermeasures to prevent or 
	
 
1592

mitigate the impact of those threats. It’s more about planning 
than actively searching for threats. 
Option D is incorrect. Security monitoring is the process of 
continuously monitoring and analyzing an organization’s 
security events. While Alex is reviewing logs, which is part of 
monitoring, the manual and proactive deep dive he is taking is 
more in line with threat hunting. 
Question 576. OmegaTech’s security team noticed an increase 
in account compromises. An internal investigation revealed that 
many employees have been using the same passwords across 
different company systems and applications. Which password 
best practice can OmegaTech enforce to mitigate this issue? 
(A)       Encouraging users to change their passwords every 
month 
(B)       Implementing an account lockout policy after three 
failed login attempts 
(C)       Prohibiting password reuse for at least the last five 
password changes 
(D)       Mandating that passwords contain only alphabetical 
characters for simplicity 
Explanation 576. Correct Answer: C. Prohibiting password 
reuse for at least the last five password changes. By 
prohibiting password reuse for a number of iterations, you 
discourage users from cycling between a small set of passwords 
and, therefore, increase the overall security of user accounts. 
	
 
1593

Option A is incorrect. While frequent password changes can 
enhance security, they don’t directly address the issue of 
password reuse across different systems and applications. 
Option B is incorrect. While an account lockout policy can 
deter brute-force attacks, it doesn’t prevent users from reusing 
the same passwords across different platforms. 
Option D is incorrect. Restricting passwords to only 
alphabetical characters reduces complexity and weakens the 
security of the password. 
Question 577. A medium-sized company suffered a data breach. 
Investigations revealed that an attacker from a rival firm had 
exploited a misconfigured firewall to gain unauthorized access 
to the company’s database. Based on the attributes of the actor, 
how would this threat actor be best described? 
(A)       Internal actor leveraging physical access 
(B)       Internal actor abusing privileges 
(C)       External actor using social engineering 
(D)       External actor exploiting technical vulnerabilities 
Explanation 577. Correct Answer: D. External actor 
exploiting technical vulnerabilities. The attacker originated 
from outside the victim organization (a rival firm) and exploited 
a technical issue (misconfigured firewall) to gain access. This 
categorizes them as an external actor exploiting technical 
vulnerabilities. 
	
 
1594

Option A is incorrect. The attacker was from a rival firm and 
did not utilize physical access within the victim organization. 
Therefore, this description doesn’t match the scenario. 
Option B is incorrect. The scenario doesn’t mention any 
internal actors or abuse of privileges. Instead, it describes an 
external attacker from a rival firm. 
Option C is incorrect. While the attacker was external, the 
scenario does not describe any use of social engineering tactics. 
Instead, the attacker exploited a technical vulnerability 
(misconfigured firewall). 
Question 578. In a microservices architecture, each service 
should be designed with a specific principle to ensure it 
performs a specific task and interacts with other services 
through well-defined interfaces. What principle is this referring 
to? 
(A)       Principle of Least Privilege 
(B)       Single Responsibility Principle 
(C)       Open-Closed Principle 
(D)       Zero Trust Model 
Explanation 578. Correct Answer: B. Single Responsibility 
Principle. The Single Responsibility Principle dictates that a 
class or module (or in the context of microservices, a service) 
should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only 
have one job or responsibility. In microservices, this ensures 
that each service does one thing and does it well, and interacts 
with others through clear interfaces. 
	
 
1595

Option A is incorrect. The Principle of Least Privilege is about 
ensuring that users or services have only the permissions they 
need to perform their tasks and nothing more. It’s not 
specifically about the design of the service itself. 
Option C is incorrect. The Open-Closed Principle is a design 
principle stating that software entities should be open for 
extension but closed for modification. While relevant for 
software design, it’s not the primary principle guiding the 
design of individual microservices. 
Option D is incorrect. The Zero Trust Model is a security 
concept where no one, whether inside or outside the 
organization, is trusted by default. It’s not a principle specific to 
microservice design. 
Question 579. A company’s online retail website faces DDoS 
attacks that cause significant downtime. Their current setup 
relies on manual verification of traffic spikes before mitigation 
efforts are deployed. What change could BEST enhance the 
company’s reaction time to such attacks in the future? 
(A)       Educate users to report slow website loading times 
(B)       Manually back up the website data every hour 
(C)       Deploy a web application firewall with automated 
DDoS mitigation features 
(D)       Increase the website's bandwidth to handle traffic spikes 
Explanation 579. Correct Answer: C. Deploy a web 
application firewall with automated DDoS mitigation 
features. Deploying a web application firewall (WAF) with 
automated DDoS mitigation can instantly detect and mitigate 
	
 
1596

attack traffic, significantly improving reaction time to attacks 
compared to waiting for manual verification. 
Option A is incorrect. Relying on users to report slow loading 
times is reactive and does not guarantee a swift response to 
DDoS attacks. 
Option B is incorrect. Backing up website data is important for 
recovery, but it doesn’t prevent or mitigate active DDoS attacks 
or improve reaction time. 
Option D is incorrect. Merely increasing bandwidth might not 
be sufficient against DDoS attacks. An attacker can still 
overwhelm the increased capacity, and it doesn’t address the 
need for swift detection and mitigation. 
Question 580. A large enterprise is deploying a new automation 
system that will allow various teams, including development, 
operations, and QA, to provision and configure their own 
environments. The security team is concerned about potential 
misconfigurations or excessive permissions being granted. 
Which solution can be used within the automation to ensure 
security standards are met without limiting the agility of the 
teams? 
(A)       Implementing a zero-trust model for all teams 
(B)       Manually reviewing all requests before provisioning 
(C)       Setting up guard rails within the automation scripts 
to define boundaries and prevent misconfigurations 
(D)       Disabling the automation system for all teams except 
the security team 
	
 
1597

Explanation 580. Correct Answer: C. Setting up guard rails 
within the automation scripts to define boundaries and 
prevent misconfigurations. Guard rails in automation scripts 
act as safeguards, ensuring that certain actions, configurations, 
or provisions stay within defined security and operational 
boundaries without impeding the benefits of automation. 
Option A is incorrect. While a zero-trust model is beneficial 
for security, it does not directly address the challenge of 
misconfigurations in automation processes. 
Option B is incorrect. Manually reviewing all requests negates 
the efficiency benefits of automation and slows down the 
provisioning process. 
Option D is incorrect. Disabling the automation system for all 
teams except the security team defeats the purpose of having an 
automation system for diverse teams and reduces agility. 
Question 581. SecureNet, a cybersecurity firm, is implementing 
an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for its enterprise client. 
Where should the IDS be placed for optimal detection of 
malicious activities? 
(A)       Before the perimeter firewall to capture all inbound 
traffic 
(B)       Between the perimeter firewall and the internal 
network to monitor the filtered traffic 
(C)       Inside the DMZ to monitor only external service 
requests 
(D)       Adjacent to each workstation for personalized security 
	
 
1598

Explanation 581. Correct Answer: B. Between the perimeter 
firewall and the internal network to monitor the filtered 
traffic. By placing the IDS between the firewall and the internal 
network, it can monitor traffic that has passed through the 
firewall’s filters. This position provides a balance between 
capturing potential threats and reducing false positives from 
benign external traffic. 
Option A is incorrect. While placing the IDS before the 
firewall will capture all inbound traffic, it may result in a high 
number of false positives since a lot of benign traffic might 
trigger alarms. 
Option C is incorrect. Placing the IDS only in the DMZ would 
limit its visibility to only external service requests and not the 
overall internal traffic which might have potential threats. 
Option D is incorrect. While personal IDS on each workstation 
provides granular monitoring, it does not provide a holistic view 
of network activities and can be resource-intensive. 
Question 582. AlphaTech wants to ensure that its remote 
employees follow best security practices when working from 
home. The security team has been tasked with drafting a set of 
guidelines for remote work. What should be the primary focus 
of these guidelines? 
(A)       Outlining punitive measures for non-compliance 
(B)       Stating the company's legal position on remote work 
(C)       Recommending security measures for home 
networks and devices 
	
 
1599

(D)       Dictating the exact software and hardware specifications 
for remote workers 
Explanation 582. Correct Answer: C. Recommending 
security measures for home networks and devices. 
Guidelines aim to provide advice and recommendations. In the 
context of remote work, they would suggest best security 
practices for securing home networks and devices without being 
overly prescriptive. 
Option A is incorrect. Punitive measures and compliance 
repercussions are typically outlined in policies or procedures, 
not guidelines. 
Option B is incorrect. The company’s legal position on remote 
work would be part of a policy or a legal document rather than a 
set of guidelines. 
Option D is incorrect. Dictating exact software and hardware 
specifications would be more in line with standards rather than 
guidelines. Guidelines would provide broader 
recommendations. 
Question 583. The incident response team at XYZ Corp 
received a report that an attacker successfully exploited a 
vulnerable web application in their environment. To identify 
which server might have been compromised, the team decided 
to cross-reference recent vulnerability scan results. Which of the 
following information from the vulnerability scan would be 
MOST helpful in pinpointing the potentially compromised 
server? 
	
 
1600

(A)       The timestamp of when the scan was conducted 
(B)       The software version of the scanning tool 
(C)       List of hosts with the specific vulnerability related to 
the exploit 
(D)       The total number of vulnerabilities identified during the 
scan 
Explanation 583. Correct Answer: C. List of hosts with the 
specific vulnerability related to the exploit. In the given 
scenario, to determine which server may have been 
compromised, the team should focus on those hosts identified in 
the vulnerability scan as having the specific vulnerability that 
matches the exploit used by the attacker. 
Option A is incorrect. While the timestamp might indicate 
when the scan was done, it wouldn’t provide specifics about 
which servers had the vulnerability related to the reported 
exploit. 
Option B is incorrect. Knowing the software version of the 
scanning tool wouldn’t assist in identifying the potentially 
compromised server. 
Option D is incorrect. The total number of vulnerabilities 
identified doesn’t help pinpoint a specific server; it only 
provides a high-level overview of the security posture. 
Question 584. While conducting a routine security review, 
Jake, a security specialist, discovers an unexpected piece of data 
placed in the organization’s financial system. Upon asking, he 
learns that this piece of data is intentionally placed and 
	
 
1601

monitored to see if any unauthorized user or system interacts 
with it. What is this deceptive piece of data known as? 
(A)       Honeystring 
(B)       Honeytoken 
(C)       Canary token 
(D)       Security marker 
Explanation 584. Correct Answer: B. Honeytoken. 
Honeytokens are strategically placed deceptive pieces of data 
that have no actual value or real-world use but are closely 
monitored. Their sole purpose is to detect unauthorized 
interactions, as any access or use of a honeytoken is likely 
malicious or unauthorized. 
Option A is incorrect. There isn’t a commonly recognized 
security term known as “Honeystring” in the context described. 
Option C is incorrect. Canary tokens are a specific type of 
honeytoken and can serve the same purpose. However, given 
the choices provided and the context of the question, 
“Honeytoken” is the most accurate answer. 
Option D is incorrect. A security marker, in a general sense, 
can be any mark or indicator used for security purposes, but it 
isn’t specifically a deceptive piece of data placed to detect 
unauthorized access. 
Question 585. DeltaCorp has a password policy in place which 
mandates users to change their passwords every 30 days. 
However, some users complain that this results in them 
choosing simpler passwords or writing them down to remember 
	
 
1602

them. How can DeltaCorp maintain security while addressing 
these concerns? 
(A)       Reduce the password change frequency but 
introduce more complexity requirements 
(B)       Eliminate password changes and rely solely on two-
factor authentication 
(C)       Ask users to change passwords every week to improve 
security 
(D)       Allow users to reuse any of their last three passwords to 
ease the transition 
Explanation 585. Correct Answer: A. Reduce the password 
change frequency but introduce more complexity 
requirements. By reducing the frequency of password changes, 
users are less burdened with the task of remembering new 
passwords frequently. Adding complexity requirements can 
compensate for the longer duration by ensuring that passwords 
are strong. 
Option B is incorrect. Relying solely on two-factor 
authentication (2FA) without any password requirements can 
introduce risks if the 2FA method is compromised. Additionally, 
2FA can be inconvenient for users if not implemented correctly. 
Option C is incorrect. Asking users to change passwords even 
more frequently would exacerbate the issue and likely lead to 
even weaker password practices. 
Option D is incorrect. Allowing users to reuse recent 
passwords undermines the purpose of having them change 
passwords in the first place and reduces overall security. 
	
 
1603

Question 586. A software company recently discovered a 
vulnerability in its popular application, which allowed 
unauthorized access to users’ data. Before the company could 
release a patch, a group of hackers exploited the vulnerability 
but only to notify the users about it. They did not misuse any 
data. What is the most probable motivation behind this group’s 
action? 
(A)       Financial gain by selling the data 
(B)       Political beliefs against the software company's 
operations 
(C)       Ethical concerns about user privacy and security 
(D)       Desire to disrupt the software company's services 
Explanation 586. Correct Answer: C. Ethical concerns 
about user privacy and security. The hackers did not misuse 
the data but instead chose to inform the users about the 
vulnerability, suggesting their motivation was based on ethical 
considerations to ensure users are aware of potential threats to 
their privacy. 
Option A is incorrect. The hackers did not sell or misuse the 
data, which means financial gain wasn’t their primary objective. 
Option B is incorrect. There’s no indication that the hackers’ 
actions were driven by political beliefs against the software 
company. 
Option D is incorrect. While the hackers did exploit a 
vulnerability, they did not aim to disrupt the company’s services 
but to inform users about the vulnerability.

Question 587. In a routine security assessment, Claire found 
that a newly deployed database server within her organization is 
still using its default login credentials. Which of the following is 
the PRIMARY security risk associated with this finding? 
(A)       The database will not function optimally 
(B)       The server will need frequent patches 
(C)       Unauthorized individuals may easily gain access 
(D)       The server will consume more bandwidth 
Explanation 587. Correct Answer: C. Unauthorized 
individuals may easily gain access. Default credentials are 
often publicly known, and if they are not changed, malicious 
actors can easily use them to gain unauthorized access to 
systems. 
Default credentials, which may include usernames and 
passwords set by manufacturers for initial setup, are widely 
known and can be easily searched online. If not changed after 
deployment, they pose a significant security risk as they allow 
anyone with this knowledge to gain access to the system. 
Option A is incorrect. The use of default credentials doesn’t 
directly impact the optimal functioning of the database. 
Option B is incorrect. The use of default credentials doesn’t 
mean that the server will need frequent patches. However, patch 
management is a separate aspect of maintaining server security. 
Option D is incorrect. The use of default credentials doesn’t 
directly cause the server to consume more bandwidth.

Question 588. DeltaTech, a progressive tech firm, is aiming to 
improve its security posture by eliminating the vulnerabilities 
associated with password use. They are considering deploying a 
passwordless authentication system. Which of the following 
represents the PRIMARY advantage of such a system? 
(A)       It allows users to choose any password complexity 
(B)       It eliminates the need for remembering passwords 
(C)       It guarantees protection against all cyber threats 
(D)       It ensures compatibility with all legacy systems 
Explanation 588. Correct Answer: B. It eliminates the need 
for remembering passwords. Passwordless authentication 
methods, such as biometrics, hardware tokens, or mobile app 
confirmations, remove the need for users to remember and input 
passwords. This can reduce risks associated with weak or reused 
passwords and enhance user convenience. 
Option A is incorrect. Passwordless systems remove the 
concept of a traditional password altogether, so there’s no 
“password complexity” to choose. 
Option C is incorrect. While passwordless authentication can 
significantly enhance security, especially against threats like 
password spraying or credential stuffing, it doesn’t guarantee 
protection against all cyber threats. 
Option D is incorrect. Passwordless authentication methods 
might not be compatible with all legacy systems without 
modifications or updates.

Question 589. A financial institution recently discovered that a 
large number of confidential customer records were being 
accessed and copied during off-business hours. Upon 
investigation, it was found that the access came from an 
authenticated user within the company, who had recently been 
passed over for a promotion. Which type of threat actor is 
MOST likely responsible for this security incident? 
(A)       Hacktivist 
(B)       Insider threat 
(C)       Nation-state 
(D)       Organized crime syndicate 
Explanation 589. Correct Answer: B. Insider threat. The 
evidence suggests the activities were conducted by an 
authenticated user within the organization, who might have a 
motive (having been passed over for a promotion). Insider 
threats are risks from individuals within the organization such 
as employees, contractors, or business associates, who have 
inside information concerning the organization’s security 
practices, data, and computer systems. 
Option A is incorrect. Hacktivists are typically motivated by 
political or social causes and will target organizations to 
promote or protest a specific issue. They are not usually 
motivated by personal grievances like being passed over for 
promotions. 
Option C is incorrect. Nation-states are driven by political, 
espionage, or military objectives. Accessing customer records of 
a financial institution for personal reasons doesn’t align with 
their typical motivations. 
	
 
1607

Option D is incorrect. While organized crime syndicates might 
have an interest in customer records for financial gains, the 
inside access and the motive related to a missed promotion 
strongly suggest an insider threat. 
Question 590. A financial institution wants to ensure that 
customers are aware of the bank’s policies on information 
sharing and how their personal data is used. Which of the 
following security controls would BEST communicate this to 
customers? 
(A)       Implementing end-to-end encryption for online 
transactions 
(B)       Publishing a privacy policy on the bank's website 
(C)       Conducting annual cybersecurity awareness training for 
employees 
(D)       Using multi-factor authentication for online banking 
Explanation 590. Correct Answer: B. Publishing a privacy 
policy on the bank’s website. A privacy policy serves as a 
directive control as it informs customers about the bank’s 
practices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of their 
personal data. By reading the policy, customers understand their 
rights and the bank’s responsibilities. 
Option A is incorrect. While end-to-end encryption ensures the 
confidentiality of online transactions, it doesn’t inform 
customers about the bank’s policies on information sharing or 
how their data is used. 
Option C is incorrect. Annual cybersecurity awareness training 
is aimed at employees, not customers. It wouldn’t directly 
	
 
1608

communicate the bank’s information-sharing policies to its 
customers. 
Option D is incorrect. Using multi-factor authentication 
improves the security of online banking by requiring multiple 
forms of verification. However, it doesn’t communicate to 
customers how their personal data is used or the bank’s 
information-sharing policies. 
Question 591. OmegaHealth, a large healthcare provider, is 
integrating automation into its operations. When a new 
healthcare worker is hired, they require access to multiple 
systems. Why would OmegaHealth automate the user 
provisioning process across these systems? 
(A)       To enforce a uniform password for all healthcare 
workers. 
(B)       To save time by ensuring consistent and 
simultaneous account creation across all necessary 
platforms 
(C)       To prevent the new hires from accessing any system 
until their probation period ends 
(D)       To reduce the software licenses needed by delaying 
account activation 
Explanation 591. Correct Answer: B. To save time by 
ensuring consistent and simultaneous account creation 
across all necessary platforms. Automating user provisioning, 
especially in an environment where access to multiple systems 
is needed, can dramatically save time and reduce human errors. 
With automation, accounts can be created consistently and 
simultaneously across all required platforms. 
	
 
1609

Option A is incorrect. Enforcing a uniform password for all 
users is a poor security practice. Automation should focus on 
efficiency and security, not creating potential vulnerabilities. 
Option C is incorrect. Automating user provisioning doesn’t 
inherently prevent new hires from accessing systems. The 
automation should be designed to provision based on specific 
rules and roles. 
Option D is incorrect. Automation in user provisioning is 
about streamlining the creation and management of accounts, 
not about reducing software licenses or delaying activations. 
Question 592. After detecting an unauthorized intrusion into 
their network, a financial institution wants to implement a 
control that will restore compromised systems to a known good 
state. Which of the following would be the MOST appropriate 
corrective control? 
(A)       Implementing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) across 
the network 
(B)       Frequently updating firewall rules 
(C)       Restoring systems from verified backups 
(D)       Enabling multi-factor authentication for users 
Explanation 592. Correct Answer: C. Deploying infrared 
(IR) sensors. Infrared (IR) sensors detect infrared radiation, 
such as the heat emitted by the human body. This makes them 
particularly effective in detecting human intruders, even in 
complete darkness, based on the body heat they emit. 
	
 
1610

Option A is incorrect. While CCTV cameras with LED lights 
can provide visual surveillance, they rely on light to produce 
images and may not detect intruders in complete darkness as 
efficiently as infrared sensors. 
Option B is incorrect. Ultrasonic motion sensors detect 
movement through sound waves, not body heat, making them 
less efficient in differentiating between a human intruder and 
other moving objects. 
Option D is incorrect. RFID badge readers control access at 
entry points but do not detect human intruders based on their 
body heat inside a facility. 
Question 593. Maria receives a text message on her phone from 
an unknown number, stating that she has won a gift card worth 
$500 from a popular online store. The message includes a link 
asking her to click on it to claim her prize. Maria is unsure 
about the authenticity of the message. Which of the following is 
the BEST course of action for Maria? 
(A)       Click the link to check if the website looks genuine 
(B)       Forward the message to her friends to verify if they 
received a similar message 
(C)       Delete the message without clicking on any links 
(D)       Respond to the sender asking for more details about the 
offer 
Explanation 593. Correct Answer: C. Delete the message 
without clicking on any links. Messages from unknown 
sources, especially those that sound too good to be true, often 
	
 
1611

signal a potential security threat. It’s safest to delete such 
messages without interacting with any links. 
Smishing is a type of phishing attack wherein attackers use 
SMS to deceive users into divulging personal information, 
visiting a malicious website, or downloading malware onto their 
smartphones. Users should always be cautious of unsolicited 
messages from unknown numbers. 
Option A is incorrect. Clicking the link, even out of curiosity, 
can lead to a malicious website or download malware onto 
Maria’s device. 
Option B is incorrect. While forwarding the message to friends 
might give her insight into its authenticity, it could also expose 
her friends to potential threats if the message is malicious. 
Option D is incorrect. Responding to the sender could give 
them more information about Maria or confirm that her number 
is active, leading to further targeted attacks. 
Question 594. In preparation for a potential lawsuit, Meg, a 
cybersecurity analyst, has been asked to ensure that specific 
digital evidence remains intact and is not altered or deleted. 
What measure should Meg implement to ensure this 
requirement? 
(A)       Encrypt the evidence 
(B)       Initiate a legal hold 
(C)       Perform a full disk wipe 
(D)       Conduct a vulnerability assessment 
	
 
1612

Explanation 594. Correct Answer: B. Initiate a legal hold. A 
legal hold ensures that specific data that could be relevant to a 
legal case is preserved and not altered or deleted until the hold 
is lifted. In this situation, Meg would initiate a legal hold to 
keep the digital evidence intact for the potential lawsuit. 
Option A is incorrect. Encrypting the evidence can ensure its 
confidentiality, but it does not prevent deletion or guarantee its 
preservation for legal reasons. 
Option C is incorrect. Performing a full disk wipe would 
eliminate all data on a disk, which is contrary to the requirement 
of preserving specific digital evidence. 
Option D is incorrect. Conducting a vulnerability assessment 
is about identifying weaknesses in a system, not about 
preserving digital evidence for legal purposes. 
Question 595. In an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) model, 
which of the following tasks is typically the responsibility of the 
cloud customer in a standard Cloud Responsibility Matrix? 
(A)       Physical security of data centers 
(B)       Patching of host operating systems 
(C)       Network infrastructure maintenance 
(D)       Patching of guest operating systems 
Explanation 595. Correct Answer: D. Patching of guest 
operating systems. In an IaaS model, the customer is typically 
responsible for managing their own virtual machines, which 
includes patching the guest operating systems. The cloud 
	
 
1613

provider is generally responsible for the physical infrastructure, 
network, and the host operating system. 
Option A is incorrect. Physical security of data centers is the 
responsibility of the cloud provider. The customer does not have 
control over the physical infrastructure in a cloud environment. 
Option B is incorrect. Patching of host operating systems is the 
cloud provider’s responsibility. They manage the underlying 
infrastructure, including the host systems. 
Option C is incorrect. Maintenance of network infrastructure 
is typically handled by the cloud provider, ensuring connectivity 
and uptime for the resources they offer. 
Question 596. A company detected a DDoS attack that lasted 
for several weeks. The attackers used a botnet of millions of 
infected devices and frequently rotated attack vectors to bypass 
mitigation efforts. This prolonged and resource-intensive attack 
suggests which kind of threat actor’s resources and funding? 
(A)       Amateur hacker with minimal resources 
(B)       Cybersecurity researcher testing vulnerabilities 
(C)       Nation-state actor with strategic interests 
(D)       Organized crime syndicate with substantial funding 
Explanation 596. Correct Answer: D. Organized crime 
syndicate with substantial funding. The scale and duration of 
the DDoS attack, combined with the use of a massive botnet 
and frequent rotation of attack vectors, point to a threat actor 
with significant resources. While nation-states could conduct 
such attacks, DDoS campaigns are also a hallmark of well-
	
 
1614

funded organized crime syndicates, especially when financial or 
strategic extortion could be a motive. 
Option A is incorrect. An amateur hacker with minimal 
resources would not have the capability to sustain a large-scale 
DDoS attack using a botnet of millions of devices over several 
weeks. 
Option B is incorrect. Cybersecurity researchers typically do 
not engage in malicious activities, and launching a prolonged 
DDoS attack would be unethical and illegal. 
Option C is incorrect. While a nation-state actor might have 
the resources to launch such an attack, DDoS attacks, especially 
those of extortion nature, are more commonly associated with 
organized crime syndicates. 
Question 597. An art gallery wants to deploy a security solution 
to detect movement in an open courtyard that features several 
sculptures. This space has varying temperature conditions, 
which might cause false alarms in some motion detection 
technologies. Which type of sensor would be MOST 
appropriate to ensure consistent motion detection in such 
conditions? 
(A)       Thermal imaging sensors 
(B)       Pressure-sensitive mats 
(C)       Ultrasonic detectors 
(D)       Microwave motion detectors 
Explanation 597. Correct Answer: D. Microwave motion 
detectors. Microwave motion detectors are suitable for open 
	
 
1615

areas and are less affected by temperature changes. They emit 
microwave beams to create an invisible detection zone and can 
consistently detect motion when an object interrupts this zone, 
irrespective of the ambient temperature. 
Option A is incorrect. Thermal imaging sensors detect 
variations in heat. While they can be effective, the varying 
temperature conditions in the courtyard may cause 
inconsistencies in detection. 
Option B is incorrect. Pressure-sensitive mats are designed to 
detect weight or pressure changes when stepped on. They would 
not be suitable for an open courtyard where movement needs to 
be detected across a larger area. 
Option C is incorrect. Ultrasonic detectors emit sound waves 
to detect motion. However, they might also be affected by 
external environmental factors and are not as suitable for open 
courtyards as microwave motion detectors. 
Question 598. TechBlitz Inc. recently underwent an IT audit, 
and one of the suggestions was to reduce the attack surface. 
Which of the following measures would be MOST effective in 
accomplishing this? 
(A)       Increasing the password length requirement for all users 
(B)       Implementing regular vulnerability assessments 
(C)       Deactivating unused services and ports on servers 
(D)       Implementing a strict BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) 
policy 
	
 
1616

Explanation 598. Correct Answer: C. Deactivating unused 
services and ports on servers. Reducing the number of active 
services and ports directly diminishes the number of potential 
entry points for attackers, thus reducing the attack surface. 
Option A is incorrect. While increasing password length 
improves security against brute-force attacks, it doesn’t directly 
affect the attack surface. 
Option B is incorrect. Regular vulnerability assessments 
identify potential security gaps, but simply identifying doesn’t 
reduce the attack surface unless actions are taken based on 
findings. 
Option D is incorrect. A strict BYOD policy can enhance 
security, but it’s focused more on the types of devices and how 
they connect rather than reducing the number of potential attack 
points. 
Question 599. A user receives an SMS claiming to be from her 
bank, alerting her of unauthorized activity on her account. The 
message instructs the user to immediately click on a provided 
link and verify her account details. The user hasn’t noticed any 
irregularities with her bank account. Which type of attack is this 
SMS most likely part of? 
(A)       Smishing 
(B)       Vishing 
(C)       Bluejacking 
(D)       Bluesnarfing 
	
 
1617

Explanation 599. Correct Answer: A. Smishing. Smishing is 
a type of phishing attack where malicious actors use SMS to 
deceive individuals into providing sensitive information, 
typically by impersonating trusted organizations or contacts. 
Option B is incorrect. Vishing refers to voice phishing, where 
attackers use voice calls instead of text or email to impersonate 
legitimate entities and scam victims. 
Option C is incorrect. Bluejacking involves sending 
unsolicited messages to Bluetooth-enabled devices. It doesn’t 
typically involve impersonating a legitimate entity for deceptive 
purposes. 
Option D is incorrect. Bluesnarfing is a type of unauthorized 
access to or theft of information from a Bluetooth device. It 
doesn’t involve deceptive SMS messages. 
Question 600. After a recent security breach, CyberCorp is 
reviewing its software vendors for their responsiveness to 
vulnerabilities. Which of the following metrics would BEST 
assist CyberCorp in determining the timeliness and efficiency of 
security patches from a vendor? 
(A)       The frequency of software updates released by the 
vendor 
(B)       The vendor's quarterly financial reports 
(C)       Time between vulnerability disclosure and patch 
release by the vendor 
(D)       The number of features added by the vendor in the last 
software update 
	
 
1618

Explanation 600. Correct Answer: C. Time between 
vulnerability disclosure and patch release by the vendor. The 
time taken by a vendor to release a security patch after a 
vulnerability is disclosed is a direct measure of their 
responsiveness to security threats. A shorter duration indicates a 
higher prioritization of security concerns. 
Option A is incorrect. Frequency of software updates does not 
necessarily correlate with timely security patches. A vendor 
might release frequent updates but still be slow in addressing 
security issues. 
Option B is incorrect. A vendor’s quarterly financial reports 
might indicate the financial health of the company but does not 
directly reflect their responsiveness to security vulnerabilities. 
Option D is incorrect. The number of features added in a 
software update does not indicate the timeliness or effectiveness 
of security patches.
